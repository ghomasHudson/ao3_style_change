“Oh my, are you looking for a travel recommendation for you and… what’s her name again?” Sherlock cocked an eyebrow. Mycroft wasn’t the only one who could play this little game. “I dare say, I can’t imagine you’d be able get the time off for a proper getaway. I mean, both your plates must be quite full with all the important matters to which you alone can attend. At least that’s the impression I got, big brother.”
There before him stood Sherlock, a frown firmly set on his face, in a pair of pale blue swim trunks covered in orange birds. John failed to keep a snort of laughter from escaping his lips.
“I see Sherlock has spoken of me. Pray tell Mr. Watson, what else has Sherlock told you of our family?” Mycroft’s voice calming, taking on a soothing quality.
“Good. And anyway if someone really needed help and had any brains, they’d have knocked or made their presence known. Someone else being in here shouldn’t be a deterrent. I come in all the time when there are other people in here.”
– I need –”
No, Sherlock was the luckiest man alive. He didn’t deserve John, he never deserved John. He could live a thousand lifetimes and never deserve John.
“But you were here, and I think just seeing that you were did him a lot of good.” Leah said reassuringly.
would say something? Why didn’t
“For all the he good it does me.” Sherlock grumbled, more to himself than Molly. “I keep hitting brick walls.”
Mrs. Holmes just looked at John, and he had been on the receiving end of enough Holmes looks to know exactly what it meant, he was being an idiot. “The way you two look at each other…” She sighed. “Reminds me of Richard and me when we first met. We couldn’t get enough of each other, still can’t as a matter of fact. And you and Sherlock are just like that; don’t think I didn’t see you two holding hands the entire time in there.”
It was the same thing every day, Moriarty taunted, Sherlock refused to listen, and John and Sherlock got hit.
Eventually their laughter faded away, and they were left facing each other. Wait, when did Sherlock move seats? John could have sworn he was just on the couch.
As Sherlock leaned over John’s shoulder to get a better look at the document on the laptop’s screen, he could hear John hold his breath, he could feel him shiver. Shit, he’d made John uncomfortable... again. “Looks… uh… yeah, looks good. Should be… um… should be very helpful. Nice of you make it, thoughtful.”
“I’m sure. But really John, I’d rather not talk about my brother right now.”
I really hope you enjoy this last chapter of 'Breaking The Grip'
“A good confused or bad confused?”
They lay like that for a while, John lazily running his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, Sherlock listening to John’s strong steady heartbeat, allowing it to calm him. John’s hand eventually slowed, and Sherlock was just about to check to see if he had fallen asleep, when John spoke.
“Oh you left me quite sore. Pleasantly sore, I should add,” Sherlock smirked, “but there’s still an extensive list of other things we can do.”
“Of course I do. I love you too, Sherlock, one hundred percent.” John breathed, kissing Sherlock deeply, slowly, so, very, very slowly.
“Alright, yeah, that was me. The three of us actually.” Sebastian actually puffed up his chest. God, Sherlock was right, this guy was a moron. “Holmes shot his mouth off, got all full of himself, so we decided to teach him a lesson.”
“We can delete it, if you want.” Sherlock suggested. It was the simplest solution; he didn’t know why he hadn’t thought of it sooner.
“I am,” John laughed. “Hillbrook wasn’t that big of a school. At some point, we would have met.”
“Be that as it may, it’s still going. They’ll see something is off, and then they’ll know the truth.” Mrs. Holmes reassured Sherlock, rubbing comforting circles across his back.
As John lay on the thin mattress in his cell that evening – or morning, John couldn’t tell – he turned over everything that happened, everything he learned. Sherlock hadn’t give up on him yet, Sherlock was still looking. The thought emboldened him. John had to remain strong; he had to keep fighting this, because Sherlock deserved a proper thank you, and John meant to be the one to deliver it.
“I don’t know, I can think of at least two.” Possibly – hopefully – three, John thought to himself.
“You’re right, there isn’t. I just wouldn’t think a suit would be all that comfortable with the bandages and everything, it is rather formfitting.” Though John couldn’t help noticing that even with the bandages and leg brace, Sherlock looked good in a suit. “And I’m going to assume your doctor already gave you the final check before you got dressed. Getting into that couldn’t have been easy, and I’d hate for you to go through that again.”
Running into everyone's favorite Consulting Detective was bound to happen sooner or later, let's just hope it doesn't complicate things for poor John TOO much.
“A lapse in judgment, it happens to the best of us.” The Voice sniffed.
“Oh you don’t have to remind me.” Mrs. Holmes chuckled. “Just don’t let Sherlock hear you say that.”
“I know, Sherlock. I’m only teasing. I’m exceedingly fond, and I love you too.” John said, leaning up to close the distance between them, kissing Sherlock softly, but thoroughly.
Sherlock stood outside John’s door, his heart pounding. John’s shower had ended a good fifteen minutes earlier, and he hadn’t come back out to the sitting room even though it was a Friday night and still relatively early. The light was on, and he could hear the pages of a book being turned. John was awake, sitting, laying, existing, on just the other side of the cheap plywood door. His hand hesitated as it hovered over the doorknob. They had gotten so close, and he wasn’t going to let fear take it all away from him, from them. He couldn’t go back to being ‘just friends’, not after tonight, so taking a deep breath, Sherlock pushed the door open.
“What?”
“This is my colleague.” Sherlock said, just as John answered “I’m his friend.”
I've been at a conference for work for the last few days, and I am bone tired. I actually nodded off while editing this chapter (not because this chapter is boring, I'm just that sleepy.) If there are more typos than usual, now you know why. (And feel free to point them out)
“Fuck you, I like bees.” Sherlock growls, pushing his pants down as well, and he grinds his cock against John’s still clothed one, claiming his mouth in a heated, messy kiss, all teeth and tongues.
“Black Russian,” Sherlock said, lifting his empty glass. “But before we head anywhere…
“No, not at all.”
Well, John Watson wasn’t going to stay where he wasn’t wanted. He dressed quickly – he certainly didn’t want to be around when Sherlock got out of the shower – stopping only briefly in the sitting room to put on his shoes and grab his coat, and hurried out of the flat.
“Oh. So, are you Sherlock’s…” John wasn’t quite sure how to finish that sentence.
“You’re a doctor,” Leah continued. “You know the terrible effects sleep deprivation has on the body.  And your brother-in-law wanted me to tell you that ‘you can’t help Sherlock recover if you have to recover yourself.’”
“Dearly beloved,” the Holmes’ local magistrate – a man in his mid to late fifties – started once all the guests had taken their seats, “we are gathered here today to celebrate the union of these two men, Dr. John Hamish Watson,” oh god, what had possessed him to agree to use his full name, “and Mr. William Sherlock Scott Holmes,” oh that was way, Sherlock had to too, “in lawful matrimony. John and Sherlock have elected to write their own vows. So Sherlock, if you’d like to begin.”
That was it, he had to know, he couldn’t take it anymore. He had to ask, he just had to ask, he’d ask and then he’d know. And so, screwing up every last ounce of his courage, Sherlock turned to face John properly. “John,” he said hesitantly, “what was that? What was tonight?”
“Alright, if everyone would please take a seat,” said the chair of the committee, “I think it’s time to get started.”
“How did you…” John had been so careful not to leave any clues. When he found out the Vienna Philharmonic – Sherlock’s favorite symphony orchestra, second only to London – was doing a live broadcast, he had made a point to order tickets from a random school computer. He even printed them out by borrowing Dr. Kiernan’s pass code.
“So listen,” John said pulling back from the kiss a few moments later. He sounded hesitant; oh god, he’d changed his mind, “Mike and Becca are back at my place, something about her telly being broken and them wanting to watch some movie. I’m not sure how much privacy there’ll be, but you’re welcome to come back with me if you want. Feel free to say no, I’ll completely understand.” He added quickly.
“You like me? Again, you don’t know me.” Sherlock was more confused than ever. This didn’t make any sense; why would John like him? Nobody liked him, especially not someone as personable as John.
“Well obviously,” Sherlock huffed, sounding exasperated, as if John were missing something glaring. “But it’s in a new location now, and that means it has to be broken in again. Think of it as my anniversary gift to you.”
“So,” Sherlock cleared his throat, “Ch – chokeholds.”
“Yep!” John beamed. “The anniversary of when we first saw each other, that’s today by the way. There’s the anniversary of when we formally met; of the first full day we spent together; our first case; the night of the championship game when we spent night together; our first kiss. And of course, the anniversary of when we actually got together, which is May.”
“For as long as you like.” John breathed. “Just close your eyes, go to sleep, I’ll be here.”
be interested in recording my days? Does she want me to relive them? What the hell is that supposed to accomplish?” John grumbled bitterly to himself like a crazy person, hobbling down the front stoop of the run-down terraced house. His current – and temporary – bedsit was depressing, but at least it wasn’t one moldy baseboard away from being condemned. He’d just have to keep looking.
“Yeah you do, but I don’t think you’re a good example.” John countered. “Your visits never have anything to do with the class, and more often than not you insult the person in here… while simultaneously answering their question and making them more confused.”
The nurse smiled at him, she had a kind, understanding smile. “Nurse Carlton, the night nurse, told me that Mr. Holmes’ fiancé was staying with him. I’m assuming you’re the fiancé.”
“No, no, I understand.” John nodded. And he did, he knew the human body, how it protected itself, how resilient it was. But knowing something intellectually did nothing to quell the terror he felt.
“It’s not…” Molly started fearfully.
“Oh, yeah, alright.” John sounded disappointed, like he wanted to go along. But he couldn’t. As unobservant as John could be at times, even he’d surely grow suspicious when they’d get to Bart’s and Molly would have no spleen for them, and no knowledge of texting Sherlock.
Sherlock’s was released from hospital the next day; his injuries were healing, his blood test came back normal, and his electrolytes were back to an acceptable level. John had to stay an additional four just to make sure there was no infection, all his vitals remained stable, and his nutrients were back in balance. Sherlock tried to persuade the hospital to let him stay with John even after his discharge, but the hospital put their foot down; something about ‘interfering with patients ability to get proper rest at night’. Hospital policy, however, did not stop Sherlock from arriving at John’s room first thing in the morning, and leaving well after visiting hours ended.
Almost half their year decided to see them, to tell them how worried they were, how relieved they were that John and Sherlock were safe. Well, that might have been a bit of an exaggeration, but it certainly felt like half the year paraded themselves through the Watson home. A few of John’s football mates wanted to know when John would be ready to join them on the field again. John must have read the look of horror on Sherlock’s face, and nipped that idea in the bud; ‘
*******
“Last night was good?” John smirked.
Gasping for breath, John gazes down at Sherlock. “You’re going to take the lead here. I've only ever done this with girls.” He admits, slightly embarrassed.
“How the hell –”
“I overheard you chatting up Molly’s friend Janet.”
The loss of John’s hands and his lips was like another shock to the system, Sherlock wanted – needed – them back.
“That’s not what I…”
“And why is it that I’m the only one doing this?” he asked, automatically holding on to John’s arm for support. Given the nature of the pool facility, the risk of slipping was far too great for crutches – though Sherlock had started going without them in the flat – and Sherlock had made clear he was not going to use the wheelchair usually used by patients. “You’re supposed to be helping me with my recovery, so why aren’t you wearing a pair of ridiculously patterned shorts and jumping into the pathogen infested water with me?”
“Don’t… don’t think so.” The man’s cough was getting worse, his voice was getting weaker, his eyes started losing focus.
“Yes, oh Jesus, yes!” Sherlock pants “Do it again, HARDER!” lifting his hips to meet John’s, taking  him in even deeper. Taking this as his queue, John begins to pull out and sink back in. John’s thrust getting harder and faster, until he pulls out almost completely, then burying himself to the hilt in Sherlock. Each thrust eliciting moans from both John and Sherlock, interrupting their heated kissing to the point they were simply panting and groaning into each other’s open mouths. This goes on for a while, John sinking into Sherlock, and John can feel the tension building in both himself and Sherlock.
“She never gets the chance.” Sherlock sighed as he resumed his supine position on the couch. “Mrs. Hudson’s proven to be invaluable to me, but good lord, can she be tedious. I’ve had to put her on semi-permanent mute for months now.”
“Yes, well I never had much faith in them to begin with. But since then, Lestrade has slipped me case files when he thinks I might find them interesting. And then there are the occasional times he allows me into the crime scene when his superiors are busy.”
~***~
couldn't
He couldn’t stop thinking about John Watson. Why had John taken an interest in him? Why was John even bothering with him when no one else ever had? Why did John seem to enjoy talking to him? Why did John smile at him? Talk to him? Why was he nice to him? Why couldn’t he stop thinking about John Watson? Why was he wasting so much space in his brain on John Watson? And worse, why did he not mind?
John had him pinned to the bed and writhing. Head thrown back against the pillow, eyes screwed shut, sweat plastering dark curls to his forehead; Sherlock was the most gorgeous thing John had ever seen, completely debauched, gasping for air and screaming
“I was wondering when you’d wake up.” John said quietly, leaning in to place a kiss on Sherlock’s lips. “Sorry if I got a bit impatient, but you looked too good not to kiss.”
“They’re still not treating this like a priority, so they’d just slow me down. Any footage they review, I’d have to go over again. No,” Sherlock said, shaking his head, “I’ll let them know what I find when I find it.” He knew this wasn’t quite true. Lestrade was taking John’s disappearance seriously, and was almost as motivated to find him as Sherlock was. But he was frustrated, the lack of any solid leads weighing on him, he felt like he needed to be doing more.
“Billy? I thought that was you!”
When John didn’t respond, Sherlock finally sat up and looked towards him. “Is this because we don’t really know each other, but we’ve slept together, so you don’t know how to act?”
Sherlock Holmes in the flesh. Probably best he stick a pin in that line of thinking and save it for when he was alone at night.
John has to hand it to her, Molly does know how to throw together a party. Now if only he could find her or Greg to tell them so. John has been at the party for about a half hour, downed one beer, chatted with several football mates, met a few of Molly’s friends and a few of Greg’s criminology friends, and yet has seen neither hide nor hair of the hostess and guest of honor.
Yes this, this was what John wanted, what he needed, Sherlock panting, beads of sweat dotting his skin, spread out before him. Kneeling up on the bed, Sherlock’s legs wrapped around his waist, John let his hands travel slowly up Sherlock’s flushed, shaking body.
“Oh this isn’t a permanent situation.” John laughed, shaking his head. “No, the first night is a freebie, tomorrow your bony bruised butt moves to out the couch and I reclaim my bed.”
“Yes, Sherlock, it’s alright.” Mr. Holmes placed a calming hand on Sherlock’s shoulder before turning back to Constable Butler. “The thing is Constable, my wife and I spoke with Sherlock earlier this evening, we all know John very well, and we don’t believe he simply ran away. We have some concerns.” Sherlock thought he might faint hearing his father backing him up, arguing for him, and for John.
Lestrade gave a short laugh, and Sherlock could see him eyeing them both in the rearview mirror. “It might not be the wisest idea to outline how you’d go about selling stolen jewelry, you two. I am still a police detective.”
“And that feeling is interpreted in the brain. You know you love someone in your brain.”
*******
John nudged his shoulder. “Long enough to get up, get your computer, and come back though?” He smiled.
“Yes, alright, fine.” John relented, letting out a deep breath, his shoulders relaxing. “I’ll at least go with you tomorrow and have a look. No guarantees.”
“And what’s that? A stalker? Because I hate to break it to you mate, but that’s not friendship.”
Sherlock’s condition remained constant over the following day. There were no more fits, he was breathing on his own, his oxygen saturation levels were good, and his heart rate remained strong. The only problem was that he had yet to regain full consciousness. There were moments when his eyes would flutter, even open, or his head would move ever so slightly and he’d make the smallest noises. It was as if Sherlock was fighting to wake up only to slip back under. Each time it happened, John held his hand and called his name, hoping that that was the time Sherlock finally broke through, and he finally came back. John felt the fist around his heart tighten each time Sherlock failed to respond, each time he failed to reach the man he loved.
“Oh wow, Michelle and Andrew’s twentieth is coming up already.”
“So, what do you think?” He asked, arms out stretched, turning to give Sherlock a three hundred and sixty degree view.
Mike was a good flat mate and a great friend, John had to keep telling himself that because he wanted nothing more than to strangle Mike with his bare hands. It wasn’t Mike’s fault, though. Really, how was he to know John was moments away from getting a leg over, moments from finally getting together with Sherlock? At least, he thought they were about to get together, and not just… Still, with only seconds to sort themselves out, John had to practically launch himself off of Sherlock at the sound of the flat door opening, so he felt a little justified in wanting to at least maim the man. When Mike sat down and decided to have a chat, John felt completely justified.
“Nothing, I just want to come fucking myself on you. I want to ride you.” Sherlock’s voice sounding a bit raw. John pulls out, and it’s almost painful to do so, whimpering at the loss of Sherlock’s tight heat, Sherlock whining as well, and rolls over, pulling Sherlock on top of him. After several rough kisses, Sherlock sits up and positions himself over John, sinking down onto him, both groaning in relief to be connected again. Once seated, Sherlock begins to roll his hips, hands on John’s chest to steady himself. As Sherlock’s movements begin to devolve into rapid, uncoordinated flicks of his hips, John’s left hand lets go of where it was balled up in the sheet, to Sherlock’s hard, throbbing cock, squeezing him in time with Sherlock’s flicks. It only takes a few short moments before Sherlock goes completely ridged, back making a perfect arch, and he’s coming in long hot ribbons across John’s hand, painting his stomach. John’s vision goes white at the feel of Sherlock’s muscles contracting around him, his own climax hitting him like a freight train, and they ride out their orgasms together.
“God, I love you,” he breathed, and lifted himself up on to his knees before carefully lowering himself back down onto John, slowly taking his husband into his body inch by glorious inch. “
“Why aren’t you eating?” Sherlock asked when John steered them away from yet another tray of finger food.
Next up, Moriarty gets worse, but John and Sherlock get
“Your house?” Sherlock sputtered. “There’s no way in hell I’m going to your house. No, absolutely not,” he shook his head. “I’m going home, back to Baker Street.”
“I was not sulking.” Sherlock frowned.
“That’s because she is part of the family, she’s your husband’s daughter.”
“But he brings you in on cases?” This was amazing, Sherlock was… he solved crimes, solved mysteries, as a hobby. “Amazing!”
That week between New Years and the start of term was, for lack of a better word, perfect. Mike was still in Brighton, so John had the flat to himself. He had no responsibilities outside of football practice, and best of all, Sherlock was there. With no classes or office hours, they were free to hang out and do as they pleased. When John had to go to practice, Sherlock would do whatever it was he had to do for that research project. He explained the project, and John understood the general idea and what they hoped to find, but he still wasn’t clear why the professor was letting a student start it on his own, but then again that student was Sherlock Holmes so who better to spearhead your experiment? But it all meant Sherlock was on campus with him, so John wasn’t going to complain. They had texted all throughout the holiday, and Skyped a few times, but nothing compared to having Sherlock Holmes in the flesh. Oh what he wouldn’t give to actually
“No maybe, I am right.” Sarah smirked. “Then add your trust issues into the mix, and everything just imploded.”
“Well, whatever the reasons,” John shrugged, “it’s helping.”
on a fundamental level
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “The lead detective is on evidence guard duty? Why do I found that suspicious?”
Sherlock’s release from hospital turned out to be far less of a hassle than John expected. A part of him was honestly expecting Mycroft to be there when he showed up, complete with a court order to stay away from Sherlock in hand. As it turned out, it was positively uneventful. The most difficult part was just getting Sherlock to sit still long enough to go through all the discharge instructions. John could understand the feeling of wanting to get out after being cooped up in a hospital room for too long, but Sherlock took it almost to another level.
“It’s certainly different, but I like it,” he said to Sherlock, who he hadn’t noticed watching him intently as he surveyed the flat.
Whoop there it is. Told you it got weird (though I'm about a subtle as a heart attack, so I'm sure it wasn't much of a twist).
“Yes, that too, but I was thinking more along the lines of getting something to eat. Breakfast was hours ago, and we just burned a lot of calories.” And as if on cue, John’s stomach rumbled.
“Are you hurt anywhere else?” John asks, his tone deathly serious, almost daring Sherlock to lie to him.
“The gym’s closed, the doors are locked.” Sherlock said, rattling the door. “How else would we get in?”
“I wouldn’t dream of it.” Sherlock laughed, and then they were kissing again. Nothing indiscreet of course, nothing to get them kicked out of the café – they weren’t big on PDA anyway – but just enough that their tea would require a little reheat.
Wrapped safely in each other’s arms, they were content. Wrapped safely in each other’s arms, they were blissfully happy.
“They’re new, you probably got them for the start of school.” Sherlock began. “They’re new, but they already have a few days’ worth of grass stains, particularly on the inside of your left foot, probably from where you kick the ball. And there’s an odd number of kids going out on the field right now. You usually play with them.” Well, so much for trying to fit in.
“Alright, Sherlock, but what about day-to-day life?” Mycroft asked, arching a brow. “I can have an assistant on hand to offer aid should something go wrong, you fall, or you just need something. You live alone, and you can’t expect poor Mrs. Hudson to help. As much as I’m sure she’d love to help in any way she can, she’s not as young as she once was, and could hardly lift a grown man should the need arise.” He was already acting as if he’d won. He was wrong.
Before John can answer, John’s phone buzzes, indicating he had a text
“Sherlock Holmes, you once told me it was you and me against the rest of the world, well, will you let it truly be you and me against the rest of the world? Will you allow me to spend the rest of my life by your extraordinary side? Sherlock Holmes… my love, my heart, my extraordinary Bumble… will you marry me?"
Sherlock was bobbing in earnest now, swallowing with every down stroke, John wasn’t going to last. Fingers twisted in sheets, John tugged desperately at Sherlock’s curls, he had to warn him, but Sherlock only sucked harder, only swallowed around him with more force. He only had a matter of seconds, he was going to, he was going to…
“Oh god no!” Sherlock actually recoils. “I do love a good crime to solve, actually do it in my spare time. But why would I want to subject myself to a petty chain of command. It would only hold me back.”
Later that night, after he grudgingly left John outside the restaurant – was he crazy or did John seem to linger a bit too – Sherlock lay in bed with his head full. It was not thoughts of the case and the girl taking back her inheritance, nor the next set of experiments he wanted to start, that kept him awake, it was John. His mind raced with thoughts of John. John on the case, telling him he’s amazing. John at the restaurant, smiling and laughing and making him promise to come to the next football game. John in the gym, so unbelievably close. Sherlock could still feel the warmth John’s broad chest press flush against his back. Sherlock could still feel John’s strong arms slung loose across his neck. How easily Sherlock could have just turned around, pulled John even closer, and taken – given – what he wanted. What would it have felt like without the cotton barriers of their t-shirts? What would it feel like to have John’s hands on his body, John’s skin against his? Grateful his roommate was away for the weekend, Sherlock allowed his hands to wander.
As a doctor, John knew that people went into cardiac arrest and were successfully resuscitated all the time, but none of that mattered. Sherlock had died, no matter how briefly, Sherlock had died. For that brief amount of time, John had lost Sherlock.
Sherlock starts the road to recovery, and John moves forward with his plans.
“I think a little persuasion can be arranged.” John smirked, and closed the final bit of distance between them.
“That was amazing! How did you know all that?” John called after him. Sherlock froze for a second, and John thought he was going to come back, or at least respond, but instead he picked up his pace and was soon out of John’s sight.
“And what is that supposed to mean?”
*******
They fell silent after that, wrapped in each other’s arms. John eventually fell asleep, but Sherlock fought to stay awake. He watched John’s even breathing, his chest rising and falling; he needed to feel John alive and solid, under his finger tips.
“Who cares – what everyone –
*******
John stops into the dry cleaners up the block from the clinic to drop off his one good suit, only to find Whitney standing at the counter, arguing with the owner.
And true to his word, over the course of the weekend, Sherlock aquatints John with every surface of 221B. Many times over.
.” John groaned.
“Sherlock? Sherlock Holmes?”
I know this is a short chapter, and I'm debating whether to post the next one (which picks up right where this one ended) tomorrow instead of waiting until Sunday. But cliffhangers are so fun!
Sherlock frowned. Patients’ boyfriends and girlfriends?
“Janine.” Molly corrects.
“Of course I’m clean.” Sherlock frowned, and what did that have to do with him dating someone? Why was it so unbelievable that he could be dating someone?
“Mmmm, you’re not so bad yourself.” John chuckled when they finally broke apart for air. “Actually, with that last go, I think you’ve finally managed to wear me out.”
“Oh no, no, no.” Sherlock scoffed, working his way along John’s jaw. “Research of this magnitude requires years’ worth of data collection, decades even.”
“Yeah, who doesn’t like Italian?” John laughed.
It felt like when she held him through the night after Redbeard died, only this time Sherlock felt as though his entire heart was missing. He felt tears start to prickle in the corner of his eyes, but he couldn’t allow himself to think John was gone for good. John couldn’t be gone.
“So we were both kinda named after old-timey relatives. That’s so cool!”
“I’m fine, I just ran here. Actually, I’m better than fine. I did it! I finally managed to do it!”
“It was ringing. I was going to bring it to you, but it stopped before I could. I brought it in here so I could tell you when you got out of the shower.” Sherlock said through gritted teeth.
“Thursdays it is! We can start this week if you want.”
Once the physical therapist started her session with Sherlock, John went down to the canteen for something to eat, so it wasn’t until one of the nurses popped her head in to tell him that visiting hours were ending, that John got up to actually leave for the evening. The physical therapist’s visit seemed to drain some of Sherlock’s energy – though when asked, he denied it – so they didn’t talk as much, and ended up watching a little telly.
Sherlock’s lips were a hair’s breadth away from meeting John’s when the magistrate’s voice cut through the emotional fog clouding John’s mind. “We’re not quite there yet!”
“Yep. The cases should last you at least a little while, and by the time you’ve solved them all, you should be recovered enough to go out again. You will still need to take it easy, though.”
“Sir, I need you to step back. We have this under control.” The first nurse called over her shoulder. The blood rushing through John’s ears made her voice sounded muffled, as if she were speaking from far away.
He just had to survive until the formal dinner started, and everyone would be paying attention to the guest speakers. Snatching a flute of champagne from a passing tray, Sherlock scanned the room in hopes of finding a somewhere to hide and wait out the reception. Unfortunately, luck was not on Sherlock’s side, the room offered nothing. What formal ballroom worth anything didn’t have at least one secluded alcove? Weren’t there supposed to be places for clandestine meetings between secret lovers? Useless, the entire place was useless, Sherlock cursed. He would just have to constantly stay on the move, appear he had a destination in mind. Maybe that would keep all the
“I could have.” Sherlock said quietly, his shoulders seeming to sag a bit as he said it. “But you can’t trust the post these days, I didn’t want it to get lost, and…”
Mrs. Hudson, of course, completely ignored him. “I know I only met John the once, but he was such a nice young man, and I’d hate to see you throw something good away over a silly disagreement.”
“Oh Sherlock…”
“But I wasn’t right there, was I? I got held up, I only got here in time to see you toppling out of sight. And all for a stupid necklace, no less. Do you know what that was like, to stand there and watch your best friend falling and there being nothing you could do about it?” John felt sick at just the thought.
– Fuck. Oh God, right… right there –
“Oh come on, Sherlock, the water’s probably only three and a half feet deep, if that, you’re in no danger of drowning.” He teased. “But I promise, I’m right here and I’ll pull you out if you slip under.”
“Well, if you’re interested, I think you definitely have a shot with him.”
“I thought I heard the door.” John beamed, leaning up to meet Sherlock’s kiss hello. He had to pull away too soon for his liking. Three months on and he still wasn’t used to those perfect lips, that they were his – and only his – to kiss whenever he wanted, but they had company to consider.
Probably sensing the movement, McCall’s head turned. For a few seconds he remained motionless, his eyes locked on Sherlock, then, as expected, he took off running. Running at a full sprint, McCall was fast, incredibly fast, but Sherlock knew that he was faster, that he could catch the jewel thief stroke accidental murderer, he knew he would catch him.
If John were a worse person, he would have filmed the heavily medicated Sherlock for blackmail purposes. As it was, John wasn’t that mean; that, and struggling to get Sherlock from the cab and into his flat meant he didn’t have a free hand to hold his phone. But mostly it was the he was a good, considerate friend.
“I… ah… I might have gone to the last home game.” Sherlock blushed. Truthfully, he hadn’t missed a single home game all season since that first one John invited him too. In all honesty, it was curiosity that made him stop by in the first place. He wanted to know what was so great about kicking a ball up and down a grassy field that made John devote so much time to it. He still didn’t know what was so great about the game itself, but after seeing John play it, Sherlock couldn’t stay away. John was so coordinated, so powerful, so determined as he ran back and forth across the pitch, it was mesmerizing. Not to mention the uniform and the way John looked in it, especially when he was sweaty and breathing hard from the game.
“So she seems to approve of me now.” Sherlock said, greeting John with a kiss. “Is that a good thing, or a bad thing?”
Again, comments and corrections are welcome!
“Yeah, we could do, or,” John grinned, “you make sure to call next time there’s a case, and you and I solve ourselves a crime.”
"I’m fine.” Sherlock winced, climbing back into his bed. “Just a bit sore, but I’m fine.” The last does of pain killers he’d been given had yet to wear off, he was fine for a couple more hours.
“Oh yes, simple as that.” John chuckled, it looked as though he needed to get specific. “But fine, let me re-phrase. Is there a restaurant owner in central London, whose establishment you frequent, who hasn’t been involved in some capacity in one of your cases, or a case with which you’ve tangentially been involved?”
” He sneered as if choking on the words. Oh if only.
Sherlock let out a laugh, the deep, genuine, almost carefree laugh that made John’s heartbeat speed up and his knees go week, the laugh that made John fall for Sherlock all over again every time he heard it. “Good,” he smiled, “because I don’t get dressed like this for just anyone.”
God he loved it here, losing himself in the beat, the music loud enough to drown out his thoughts, the constant ebb and flow of people around him, none of them really caring who or what he was. Nobody needed answers; nobody was depending on him to be right, to be fast, he could just be. And after the last few days, the demands, the nonstop running around, Sherlock need to just be, he needed the sound, the movement, the distraction.
“So hey, last night was…” John started, slipping on his pants.
“You need to extubate! He can’t breathe!” John cried. Sherlock had survived the stabbing, survived the surgery; John couldn’t lose him now, he couldn’t lose him to this.
“Yes, absolutely. Just because John doesn’t carry the surname Holmes or Vernet, that does not mean he isn’t intelligent and capable… to a degree.”
“It’s called a car, Molly. They’ve been around for quite awhile.”
“Yeah, and then there’s no stopping us. We own the oceans!”
“So you have a boyfriend then?”
“Oh God, Sarah, I’m sorry. I’m fine, really.” Well if he didn’t feel like a real jackass. “I’ve just been kind of dwelling on something. I didn’t mean to worry you.”
John furrowed his brow, eyeing Sherlock suspiciously. “Am I attracted to both women and men? Yes,” he said slowly.
John noticed his schedule. It should really bother him, but… but it didn’t. “Well that’s because lessons are involved.” Sherlock said, frowning a bit. “It wouldn’t do to risk missing something that might be important later on, or risk wasting your time. I thought… I thought today was more causal. I didn’t… I didn’t know correct timing was imperative.” Had he messed this up already? Had his attempt to not look eager put John off?
“Gallen Family!” John snapped. “As in Gallen Family Medical, the clinic where I work!”
moments. Plenty of people he knew or had known, popped into his head during those moments. It didn’t mean anything. And the fact that Sherlock may or may not have popped in more and more often as of late, well, that was just because he spent so much time with Sherlock. It wasn’t like he… he couldn’t… he….
“You know, this really isn’t how I pictured getting you in my bed for the first time.” He mumbled, pressing a kiss to Sherlock’s forehead – seemingly the only part of the beautiful idiot left un-bruised. “Sleep tight, Bumble.” He added before slipping out of the room, leaving the door ajar.
Alright, that was fairly common practice for those kind of injuries, John thought. Sherlock’s recovery was bound to be hell, but people did it all the time.
Of course Mycroft chose that exact moment to interrupt. Actually, knowing him, he was probably watching them on one of his little cameras, and did it on purpose. Bastard.
“Oh yes I do.” John forwent peppering every inch of Sherlock’s body with kisses – with the way Sherlock was whining, there was no way he’d last – and took him in completely to the base.
Again, apologies for any errors or stilted sounding conversations.
John felt a tear slide down his cheek as he took Sherlock’s hand and brought it to his lips. “You came back.”
“Your face was positively aglow as you talked to him; you lit up just looking at him.” Mrs. Hudson’s eyes were getting misty. “It was the same with him; wanting to know all about your work, complimenting you, asking for more and more stories. For the first time since… forever, you were genuinely enjoying someone else’s company.”
A small crease formed between John’s brows. “How much? You mean how long it took?” Sherlock nodded. “Twice a week for just over two months, but that was only after the month and a half I spent in hospital. I’m a little surprised you even asked.”
He was getting dangerously close to slipping and saying something stupid, he had to change the subject. “Since there are clearly no students here in need of your assistance, what are you pecking away at so diligently over there?” Sherlock asked.
“Maybe you’re right.” John sighed. He definitely felt like an arse.
Couldn’t he?
“So am I.” John grinned. “Now come on, no more of this mushy stuff, let’s go meet the guys.”
Sherlock let out a long sigh, his body visibly relaxing. “I’ve just imagined… well, maybe not this exact scenario, but ones like it, so many times… I just couldn’t be too sure.”
Once again, apologies for the poorly written smut and any typos.
“So I guess I’m sticking around.” Came John’s voice from the doorway.
“Oh yeah, the bird on the vine was correct.”
“No” Sherlock breathed.
“But look,” John said, pointing to the puncture wounds, “there’s no inflammation. I’m not an expert, but I did see my fair share of snake bites in Afghanistan. Unless the bite happened post mortem, there should be some swelling and inflammation; some redness at the very least.”
“Sherlock? Sherlock, Sweetie, open the door. Come on, let us in.” came his mummy’s voice, soft and soothing, as if she hadn’t just betrayed him.
“Don’t be ridiculous, John, do you have any idea how many restaurants there actually are in central London? It would be near impossible for me to have solved a case for every owner.” Sherlock said, taking a drink of his wine, the light of the candle Angelo placed on their table reflecting off the bottom of the glass. “And besides, I didn’t solve a case for Angelo.”
It's the end of physical therapy, this calls for a celebration!
“Oh you’re so sensitive, and I’m not done yet.” Sherlock said, his tone dark, dangerous, and oh so inviting.
“Hands on your neck. Now what?” He could feel John’s pulse under his fingers, it was… elevated.
“I’m just doing my job. And while I’m at it, I would suggest you get some rest yourself, maybe something to eat. You’re no good to him if you end up in hospital yourself.”
“Agree to disagree?” Sherlock said, rising an eyebrow.
“You’re an interesting fellow, Mr. Watson. You’re very loyal, very quickly.”
“Ok, you know how I’m graduating next month.” Sherlock nods. “Well, I think I finally figured out what I want to do next. I know how I can use my ability to cause the most good.”
– for a long time – for so long. Please, John please let me have this. Let us have this.”
couldn't
Next time, we get more of a glimpse into what life is like at 221B.
“Arrangement?” John snorted.
“No, not that. Hey, hey look at me.” John sighed, trying to coax Sherlock to turn around. “I meant how you knew she existed in the first place.”
“Seriously? You really want to come?” Sherlock didn’t dare believe his ears.
Once the door clicked shut behind his parents, Sherlock finally let out a long, and shaky breath. It was stupid for him to sacrifice all his potential all for friends he knew he was never going to make. Well, there was still a month before school was due to start, he had plenty of time to change Mummy and Daddy’s minds.
“Yes, it’s open twenty-four hours, don’t worry. Also, there was a couple just inside the entrance, though they were obscured behind some shrubbery. I’m not all that surprised that you didn’t see them.”
“Then just –
Intrusive prick; he was going to have to do another sweep of the flat for audio bugs. Sherlock was sure the earful Mycroft was sure to have gotten the week of his and John’s engagement would have been enough to make him never want to listen in on the goings on of his little brother’s flat ever again. Apparently not.
“I’m actually not that nervous.” John admitted. “I’m excited, more than excited, but not really nervous. I know this is right, that
“Amazing? Fantastic? Earth shattering?”
love in your heart.”
Sherlock thought for a moment. “There was the kidnapping that involved a case of mistaken identity…”
“Oh god, yes,” Jack groaned, grinding himself down hard and stealing the rest of Sherlock’s sentence with another kiss, this time breathless and almost painful in its intensity. Christ, it felt amazing.
was, I find I much prefer my husband.”
bedroom – unable to wait another moment.
John had to stop, he had to stop thinking like that. Sherlock was his flatmate, Sherlock was his friend. In the few short months they had known each other, Sherlock had restarted and reshaped his entire life. After only three months, Sherlock had quickly become integral to his life, he had become the best friend John had ever had, and John could not think about his best friend like that.
Originally I wasn't going to include any sexy times in this fic, but try as I may, sexy times had to be had. And really, every wedding day is followed by a wedding night!
The sight of those deep blue eyes staring back at him with undeniable affection, the kiss swollen lips stretched into a smile, and the sound of that breathless laugh, were almost enough to make Sherlock dive back in for round two. “So, all of it, everything you did, all the plans, it was for us, for you and me? Everything?” he asked instead.
*******
“And what is that?” Sherlock asks quietly, eyes not leaving John’s for a second.
“Oh Sherlock!” Mrs. Hudson gasped admonishingly. “You know better than that!”
“Incredible!” John beamed. Sherlock merely shrugged, as if he hadn’t just finished describing how he foiled a bank robbery.  “Though how anyone would be stupid enough to think a society of red-heads who retype Wikipedia articles ‘as backups’, is a legitimate thing, is beyond me.”
“You have your hands on my right now.”
Everything he did, everywhere he looked, John, John, John! Sherlock had to get to the bottom of this. He was going to figure out John Watson, if it was the last thing he did. Surely one football playing medical student couldn’t be too hard to crack.
Fun fact, John's train is supposed to be leaving on June 20th at 2:54 pm, which happens to be my birthday and birth minute (though this is in London, and I was born in PDT). And that's about the most self insert as we'll get.
Agreeing to help out Sherlock, turned out better than John could have expected. It was certainly better than how he originally thought his evening was going to go. Wandering around the gala with Sherlock was fantastic, Sherlock deducing his childhood, his bad shoulder, and his life in medical school, John filling in the gaps when rarely needed. Yes he had to avoid the servers, John still wasn’t convinced Sherlock was right about them being unable to recognize him, but hanging around Sherlock was absolutely fantastic.
No… no, stop. No deductions. He promised himself no more deductions. This was one night, a purely physical distraction for the night, nothing else. He didn’t need to know why, he just needed to enjoy it, to empty his mind, and just
John wasn’t the only one to notice this change, the rest of his team seemed to take notice too.
It worked, and it worked an additional three more times. Though Sherlock tried to hide it behind a smug indifferent, John could see the excited smile fighting to break through. All the annoyance he felt at his petulance just melted away, the look on Sherlock’s face was so… endearing.
When Britain finally pulls out of Afghanistan, John is first to volunteer to be transferred to Iraq. John claims it’s because there are more lives to be saved there, but really it’s that he knows there’s nothing in London for him to come home too but painful memories,
That got Sherlock’s attention. “Me and John?” he said and automatically glanced towards the door that led to the hallway that lead to the mortuary. “What are you talking about, Lestrade? What story?”
“I’m fine sir. Sherlock and I met at a party, he was telling me all about what he does, and offered to let me tag along. It’s nice to see you again, sir.” John, shaking the proffered hand, then turning to a confused Sherlock, “I play football with Greg, remember?”
“We won’t let him.” John whispered. “I only just got you, and I’m not giving you up. I’m not going anywhere.” He didn’t sound convinced.
“Oh my god, Bumble.” He breathed, his hands hovering over Sherlock’s chest. “What happened?”
“It varies from patient to patient, anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months.” Two weeks it was. “Now we can arrange for you to go to a residential in-patient rehabilitation facility for the duration of this phase in your therapy –”
– what everyone thinks?”
Needless to say, John made a
"Good.” John said. “Really good.” It was true, he honestly couldn’t remember the last time he’d felt this good; before Afghanistan, that was for sure. And it wasn’t just a passing good, he wasn’t just having a good few days. It wasn’t a bright spot in a sea of grey. No, he was feeling consistently good. He wasn’t seeing the world through rose colored glasses or anything, there was still the grey, but it was as if the grey didn’t really matter all that much, because the good was just so… good.
“Of course you are.” John’s eyes fluttered shut. “HELP!!! SOMEBODY HELP!!!!” Sherlock screamed again, desperately trying to stem the bleeding. “Keep your eyes open. Please, John, please stay awake. I need you awake. I need… I need you. John, please. I love you. I love you, John. Please, I love you.” Sherlock begged, pulling John half into his lap, holding him tight, his hand still over where the bullet tore through John. Bullet. John. John shot. Gunshot wound. Gunshot wound in John. This wasn’t happening, this couldn’t be happening.
Sherlock felt his heart simultaneously soar and stutter to a halt, turning around to find John standing behind him.
“What?”
“I was only kidding,” he apologized. “So, where’s the second bedroom?”
“Don’t worry, Mrs. Hudson, we’d be happy to help.” John pipped up, flashing Mrs. Hudson a reassuring smile. “Come on, it’s the least you can do.” He said as he stood up, slapping Sherlock’s knee in the process. So clearly they were just going to ignore what almost happened between them.
“Oh… ok.”
“How do you know all his shoes are here?” Evans asked as a forensics tech started processing the shoes.
“That’s alright, I can see we’re in quite a hurry.” He laughed. “Now, John, do you take Sherlock to be your lawfully wedded husband, your partner in life, to love and put before all others, from this day forward?”
“So, fuck buddies?” John says with a heady laugh, pressing back
“Carl, give me a Black Russian,” The man said in a deep baritone, leaning over the bar, before glancing back at John, “and a scotch neat.”
Next up, Sherlock gets a scare, and John learns even more of his captor's motivations.
I know a lot of people think "emotional" Sherlock is OOC, but the canon has clearly shown when it comes to John, all bets are off. Canon Sherlock is a big emotional mess, barely holding it together, when John is involved.
It was just past four o’clock when John half dragged Sherlock into the presently empty flat. It would have been nice to have a little help, but given Sherlock’s present lack of filter, it was probably best that Mike wasn’t around to hear what Sherlock would reveal or admit to next. John didn’t bother stopping at the couch – which Mike had been nice enough to set up as a bed – but instead steered Sherlock towards his bedroom. With the cracked ribs, and drug-induced lack of coordination, John’s bed seemed the safer option, at least for the first night. Actually getting Sherlock into the bed was a different story all together. Every time John tried to sit him down, Sherlock would struggle to stand back up.
Regards,
Sherlock swallowed down a lump that had suddenly formed in his throat. “That’s not… he sounds bad.” Given how careless he knew he could be with his possessions – tears, spills, dirt stains – Sherlock could only imagine how Mr. Sedgeway would have treated him. But he wouldn’t have to worry about that, would he? They wouldn’t force him back into grade one if he didn’t fit in, would they?
I'd love to hear what you think. Comments and corrections are always appreciated!
– yes.” He nodded, thrusting his hips up to meet John’s, desperate for the contact, desperate for the friction. “I’ve wanted –
“Oh hush, Detective.” Mrs. Hudson twittered from her seat. “You’re certainly familiar with that new love feeling, leave them be.”
“It is! I can’t wait until the first birthdays!” John really liked to talk, Sherlock thought. Well, that wouldn’t last long, it was only a matter of time before he’d realize what kind of person Sherlock was, and would want nothing more to do with the freaky little kid who knew too much for his own good. Still, it was kind of nice having someone be nice to him for the time being.
“Great, that’s just what I needed.” John smiled, stopping his phone. He really didn’t need to record what came next. “Thanks gents!”
Sherlock shook his head, his eyes still closed, his breathing still labored. “Nothing… nothing’s wrong,” he replied, moving forward to try to kiss John again.
“Interesting enough, huh? That’s high praise!” John jokes.
“What is it with you and eating, John?”
“I know, I’m the worst. Now come on, I’d very much like to dance with my husband some more.” John grinned. Husband, he couldn’t stop saying it, Sherlock Holmes was his husband.
God, it hurt.
“I’ll be fine.”
“Oh my god, John!” Sherlock burst into a fit of giggles. Dear lord he was breathtaking when he laughed. “I was joking. You don’t honestly think I would have done that, do you?”
“Well someone’s got to make sure you don’t overdo it and ruin all those weeks of hard work.”
“Donavan just spotted a black Range Rover entering the yard. It’s heading our way.”
John could feel the blush creeping up his face. “I was afraid I’d lost you, and I would have never had the chance to tell you how I really felt about you,” he mumbled, averting his eyes as best he could, “yeah, something like that.”
“Well you’re certainly right about acting like an idiot, but it’s hardly ruined.”
Abruptly, Sherlock felt two sets of arms lifting him off the ground and help him out the door, and back into Dr. Sanderson’s office.
And so completes the first fic I wrote in over a decade. I hope you all enjoyed reading it, because I sure enjoyed writing it. (Maybe too much, because I've started brainstorming more fic ideas. Send help!)
And so we've come to the end of the one-shot that wouldn't stop growing and turned into a chaptered fic!
“Well I’ll just keep you company until he gets here.”
“Hmmm, you don’t say?” John said, his tone nothing short of seductive as he allowed himself to be pulled on top of Sherlock. “As luck would have it, I’m rather fond of mine.”
“Hey, the more the merrier, I always say. But don’t feel compelled or anything. If you’ve been cleared to leave, feel free to leave.”
“You’re welcome. Now come on, nobody’s going to show up in the next ten minutes, and if they do, they’ll just e-mail me.” John smiled, shutting his computer and grabbing his bag. “Let’s go see a man about some cold cases!”
“I’m Greg Lestrade. This is John Watson, Sherlock’s partner.” Lestrade said, gesturing towards John. John merely nodded, his throat too thick, and his mouth too dry to speak. “How is he?”
As John slid in inch by inch, the pain slowly gave way to pressure, until he was fully seated and Sherlock finally let out the breath he’d been holding. In theory he knew what to expect, and he had experimented a few times by himself, but no amount of theory or experimentation could have prepared him for the real thing. He was full, completely full. It was… strange, to have his body breached by another person, to feel the heat of another person inside him. It felt… it felt amazing. John –
“Well, according to him, he’s the closest thing, an enemy.”
Hooking a leg over John’s hip, and wrapping his arms around his shoulders, Sherlock pulled John impossibly closer. This was it, there was no slowing down, and there was no going back. But he didn’t want to slow down; he didn’t want to go back. He was entangled with everything he could ever want, everything he scarcely even dared dream he could have again was wrapped around him, on top of him, kissing him, touching him,
“And how exactly would you ‘help me out’?” Sherlock asked.
They wouldn’t dare take his door away. They’d done enough to him, they wouldn’t add to his suffering like that. Still, it was a risk Sherlock wasn’t about to take, so without a word, he unlocked his door and retreated back to his bed. He could hear his parents come in, but he resolutely ignored them. If they were going to ignore his wishes, then they deserved to be ignored themselves. Not even when his bed dipped and he felt Mummy’s hand on his shoulder, did he turn around.
“I said I wanted to dance
“Focusing on your career, I get that, yeah.” John chuckled, trying to ease the tension. This was not how he envisioned the day going when he first woke up. “I’m the same, or I was until…” he trailed off, not really wanting to finish that sentence,
“He’s alive. He’s in surgery, but he’s alive.”
“Ego boost my arse, you liked seeing me squirm,” Sherlock muttered. “I’ll have you know your pick up skills haven’t tarnished a bit, you were on top form. I particularly liked the fake names thing you did. It really helped sell the idea that we were only in it for the night, and didn’t want any risk of attachment.”
“Well if I hadn’t been targeted, you never would have had a reason to stop me that evening at the library. We never would have had the self-defense lessons, we never would have had the chance to get to know each other, we… we wouldn’t have this.” Sherlock explained. “It’s worth it you know? This, with you. It’s worth the harassment, all the cuts and bruises, it’s worth the broken ribs.”
He didn’t know how long he had been on the dance floor – long enough to have worked up a healthy, exhilarating sweat – when he felt it, someone was watching him. Opening his eyes after what felt like hours, Sherlock swept the room, and spotted him. Standing off to the side by the bar was a man, perhaps a couple years older than himself, well built – if a bit short – and by what Sherlock could see, handsome in an easy, reassuring way. He was slightly awkward, a bit out of place, looking as if he wanted to be anywhere but here. He was watching the dance floor, but mostly he was watching Sherlock. He didn’t look threatening, as if targeting Sherlock – Sherlock was all too familiar with that type of watching – no, he was looking at Sherlock with a look of appraisal, of interest.
“Oh,” she frowned, “That’s too bad, but what’s that got to do with you?”
“Not to sound like a broken record,” the man chuckled, “but how did you know, how did you
“I probably could.” Sherlock grinned wickedly, popping himself up on one elbow, and letting his other hand slide down John’s torso. “Though I can definitely think of something else I’d much rather ‘pull off.’”
“Yeah.”
“Because nobody deserves to be treated this way. And I don’t know,” John said with a shrug, “I like you.”
(BTW, it's super difficult naming fics once you've established a theme for the series)
“I thought you said that the majority of Scotland Yard were idiots.” John countered, one eyebrow raised, a smile playing on his lips.
“You were right.” John said, breathing heavily as he rolled off Sherlock to flop down next to him.
“You really weren’t. That all?”
“I said,” Sherlock huffed, “give me a minute to change my clothes, then I’ll give you back what you lent me… Thank you, by the way.” He added almost as an afterthought.
“Do you see the cameras, Doctor Watson?”
“So please – please, John – please have it – have me.” Sherlock panted, tightening his legs and capturing John’s mouth in desperate kiss after desperate kiss. “Please – oh god, please!” He knew he was begging; he was begging and he didn’t care. All he cared about was getting rid of the layers separating himself from John, and feeling every inch of John’s body against him.
“Does it have to do with your young man?
“Just through the kitchen, and down the hall is the full bath, and the larger of the two bedrooms.”
The very first thing Heather did upon entering the flat, was give Sherlock a quick hello and immediately take his crutches away. She meant business, that was one check in the pro column. Working for Mycroft, however, was still a missive check in the con.
Half two in the morning and John could not sleep. He tried every trick in the book; a warm shower, ‘four-seven-eight’ breathing, picturing his ‘happy place’ – his grandmother’s garden in the summer – and even listening to Ella’s calming playlist, nothing helped. Ironically, the one thing that had been proven time and time again to help him sleep was Sherlock playing the violin. But that right there was the crux of the problem; Sherlock. John could not stop thinking about Sherlock. It was hours since it had happened, and Sherlock and that kiss were all John could think about. More specifically, it was the fact that Sherlock had kissed him, and he had liked it… a lot.
“Fuck the universe.” John breathed. “No, no you don’t.” And then John’s arms came up to wrap around Sherlock’s back and those last few millimeters were demolished.
“That’s… that’s nice of her.”
The cry Jack let out as Sherlock’s finger finally breached the first tight ring of muscle was almost enough to do Sherlock in right there.
“Alright then,” the magistrate sighed at Sherlock’s abruptness. “John, the ring?”
The boys continue to get to know each other... then get to
didn’t. You looked so gorgeous and untouchable, Jack was sure he was going to get shot down the second he opened his mouth. Besides,” Sherlock didn’t even need to look at John to hear the smirk in his voice, “maybe I liked seeing you turn down all those other people. Knowing you didn’t want them, but you want me… can’t blame a guy for getting a little ego boost when he can, especially since I haven’t tried hitting on someone in quite a while.”
John let out a soft moan, and didn’t resist Sherlock pulling him down onto him. “Heaven forbid. We can’t have that.”
“John’s not… he’s not my boyfriend.” Sherlock clarified quickly. Why did he just do that? It was true, John
“Friends?” The man scoffed. “You’ve met him. How many
“Well we will if you keep on talking like that!”
With strong hands cupping the sides of his head, and long, narrow, violin calloused fingers sliding into his hair, John felt all previous doubts and fears begin to dissolve and disappear. Sherlock kissed with such fervor that the rest of the world itself began to dissolve and disappear. All that mattered was Sherlock’s lips parting against his, the sound of Sherlock’s whimpering moans when he slid his tongue into his mouth, and the feeling of Sherlock shivering when he snaked his arms tightly around the consulting detective’s trim waist.
Thank you all again from the bottom of my heart!
“You’re kind of strange, you know that, right?” John chuckled, but there was no malice behind it. He was teasing him, like friends do to each other.
“I do know that, John. I work with the police, remember.” Shaky start, but his confidence was returning. Sherlock had this, John Watson was not going to trip him up again.
said the woman on the other end of the line.
“I am fine on my own, and I am treating you like a normal flatmate. I would have asked you to get it for me even if I had two fully functional legs.”
“Well it’s nice to know that I’m intelligent for an idiot.”
“Oh right. Yeah, I’m applying for this shadowing program they run during the summer.” John explained. “Upper division medical students get the chance to shadow doctors and junior doctors a few hours a day. We can’t touch anything, or really do anything, but it should be great experience. Plus it’s an excuse to stay in the city.”
“Getting ready to what?” Mike frowned. They didn’t’ seem all that busy, they were just sitting on the couch. Unless…
“But how can I be your best friend?” Sherlock frowned. “We haven’t even known each other six months.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You do love a good diseases organ. Want me to tag along?”
“They know,” was all Sherlock managed to say before bolting from the car, not even bothering to wait for a response or to see if Lestrade and John were following him. If they lost McCall now, he and his brother would surely go to ground, and it could be weeks before Sherlock found them again.
Sebastian didn’t get a chance to finish his sentence, as John had slammed him face first into the nearest wall, both arms pinned behind his back.
“It wasn’t nearly as charming as you’re probably picturing.” Sherlock mumbled, his face feeling suddenly hot. What was wrong with him? “Except for the few times I convinced my mum or dad to call in with an ‘anonymous tip’, nobody listened to me.” He sighed. The Yard really did waste an unbelievable amount of time by ignoring him, he was – nearly – always right. “It wasn’t until about two and a half years ago that I met DC Lestrade when I was hanging around a crime scene, a carjacking. Apparently I looked suspicious, so he questioned me a little.”
With all of London now looking for John, Sherlock may get the break he's been looking for. In the mean time, the Met tries to get Sherlock's mind off the search, even for a little while.
John just shook his head and shoved the pills into Sherlock’s hand. “Nope, none of that ‘grin and bear it’ nonsense. The more painful your ribs are, the shallower your breathing will be, and the more likely you are of developing a respiratory infection.”
Well that settled it, John had to find out more about Sherlock Holmes. The injuries were still the priority, but anyone who could ‘notice’ so much about him, was definitely someone John wanted to get to know.
“I know it’s difficult, but finding John is too important.”
“With the key.” John laughed at the look of surprise on Sherlock’s face. Trust him to be expecting some complex scheme. “My flatmate is the student manager for the football team. He has keys to the gym. Sometimes I like to come and train by myself, so I made myself a set.”
Next time, shit gets serious.
“But that’s the point,” she continued, “you’re already going to be so much smarter than all the other kids, you don’t want to rub it in and make it harder by being four or five years younger than them too.”
“I’m really not. If Greg and I hadn’t been there to catch you, you would have fallen flat on your face. That was a rather impressive little pirouette you did when trying to catch yourself, though.” John added with a chuckle.
This same conversation with Mycroft? But he wasn’t anything like Mycroft, Mycroft was an idiot. Skipping ahead one year was probably all Mycroft could handle, but Sherlock knew that he could handle more. Even the idiots at the school agreed. Why else would they suggest he jump all the way up to grade five?
” He was just taunting the Voice, and he liked it.
Nearly forty-five minutes later, after far too many goodbyes and promises to ‘get together soon’, Sherlock finally had John back in their room and all to himself, where he learned that reality getting John out of a bespoke three-piece suit was better than any fantasy. There were pants underneath the trousers in reality, but needless to say, they weren’t a problem for long.
“And you expect me to hand over my car to someone who has been driving for less than a year.”
“Excellent! I will just write up our full plan and get you a copy. But before I do that, I think it’s time we get started! I’m going to need you to lay back for me, and tell me the second something starts to hurt. There’s obviously going to be some pain, but we don’t want to be counterproductive, so I need to know when, where, and how bad the pain is.”
Sorry to hear about your holiday, hope everything’s alright. There’s nothing really to do until next week, and I’m sure you’ve already read all the papers I sent you before break. Maybe go into the lab sometime on Sunday and wake up the T453Ls, they’re in the -80. Other than that, enjoy your time before classes begin again.
“Can’t give out… You people called me!” John shouted. “I got a call saying that Sherlock Holmes was brought to this hospital with a suspected stab wound. Tell me where he is, I need to know where he is, I have to be with him!” He couldn’t believe this, he couldn’t breathe, he felt faint.
Three hours away. The championship game had to be three hours away! John and the rest of the team just had to make it into the finals. Sherlock just had to make that stupid promise, and now he had to deal with the small matter of how he was going to get there. He certainly wasn’t going to take the coach the spirit boosters hired to haul students to the game – Sherlock would never condemn himself to that hell – and a cab would be far too expensive. There was only one option left; he was going to have to go see Mycroft. This was going to be painful.
“You’re his brother aren't you? You’re Mycroft.” Of course this is the horrible, meddlesome older brother Sherlock complains about. The posh, other worldly quality should have tipped him off.
“He’d better be!” Harry laughed, and gave John a kiss on the cheek. “Now go on, get back to that dashing husband of yours.”
John told him all about his time abroad serving in several combat hospitals, and corrected the very few deductions Sherlock got partially wrong. He had signed up to serve shortly after completing his training at St. Bart’s hospital, and attained the rank of Captain before a bullet to the shoulder invalided him home to London. He was now living off an army pension while half-heartedly looking for work. John didn’t actually tell him those last bits, but it didn’t take a genius of Sherlock’s caliber to figure them out.
It was probably for the best that Lestrade cut him off, Sherlock didn’t want John’s first crime scene marred by petty – on Sally’s part, not his – insults and bickering. John was bound to learn how the Yard, save for Lestrade, viewed him sooner or later, and Sherlock preferred to put it off for as long as possible.
“Don’t you dare,” Sherlock all but growled. “I’ve waited far too long for this, wanted this for too long. I’m not letting you get away now.” John was his now, and he intended on keeping him as close as humanly possible, if not closer.
“Don’t worry about that, I don’t need them back right away. Actually, you can give them back next time, preferably after you’ve giving them a wash.” Teaching Sherlock self-defense was one thing, he wasn’t about to start doing his laundry – even if they were technically still John’s clothes.
Reminder, I'm not a physical therapist so anything that goes on during Sherlock's sessions are completely made up, and probably not accurate.
Carefully lowering himself back down on to the mattress, and with several deep, deliberate breaths, John attempted to calm his racing heart. Closing his eyes, John tried to think back, tried to remember what had happened to him, how he ended up in this cell. He had just got back from the park – back from Sherlock, he thought with a smile – the house was silent, either his father was already passed out, or not home. What was it? What happened next?… Changing! He was changing, getting ready for bed, when something moved behind him, and there was the sharp jab to his neck, and then nothing, everything went black. Looking down, John saw he was in his pajamas, still wearing socks, and his watch was still around his wrist. It had really happened, it wasn’t some twisted nightmare brought on by the stress of A-levels looming overhead, or graduation rapidly approaching, John had been kidnapped. He had been taken from his bedroom, and now he sat in his too thin pajamas, cold and alone, in a grey cinder block cell.
“I most certainly can –
The session itself was really no different than what he was used to. The equipment was better, and there was more of it which lead to slightly different exercises. And he wasn’t alone; there were other therapists with other patients, but ultimately it was more of the same. Needless to say, after an hour and a half of the parallel bars, leg lifts with a rubber resistance band, and for some reason, kicking a large inflatable ball, Sherlock was more than ready to get John from the lobby, and leave.
Finally, Sherlock thought as he found himself grinning back, physical therapy might actually become bearable.
!” John panted. He tried gripping the sheets, but staring up at him beneath hooded eyelids, his eyes burning, Sherlock let go of one hip to place John’s hand into his wild curls.
“Why do I have to be here? I really don’t think I belong here. Nobody wants me here.” Sherlock said nervously.
Even in the dim lighting of the bedroom, John was radiant. His grin lit up his entire face, reaching those dark blue eyes, which shown with soft, and undeniable affection, as he gazed at Sherlock. His usually neat blond hair – now sweat damp – stuck up at all angles. His lips kiss swollen; his cheeks, neck and chest, were red with stubble burn. Sherlock could only imagine that he himself was in a similar disheveled state; but on John, oh on John it was beautiful. John was the most beautiful man Sherlock had ever seen.
“Yes.” Sherlock hummed. “They’re not going to make it to the Stamford’s until close to eleven.”
“So what were you doing in the club last night?” John asked, completely unaware of the confusion and mental upheaval he was causing Sherlock. “It doesn’t seem to fit with the whole ‘genius detective’ thing. I’d ask if you were undercover, but you don’t strike me as the type to just up and leave in the middle of a case.”
Yep, he was definitely well passed hesitant. John had to bite his lip from laughing.
Sherlock shook his head as if to clear it, and all earlier traces of nerves and hesitance were gone. “I have no problem with picking locks and breaking and entering, but you never struck me as the criminal type, John.” He smirked.
Sherlock just nodded, looking down at the floor.
Rushing from the park, Sherlock worked his phone out of his pocket, and dialed the number John gave him ‘just in case.’
“Oi!” Lestrade said loudly, defusing the building stand-off, “When I said I didn’t want any arguments, that goes for you too, Sherlock.”
They ended up going to a small Greek place not too far from the clinic. It was moderately priced – if Sarah was treating him, John didn’t want to make her have to pay too much – but nice, and the service was prompt, which was always a bonus. It wouldn’t do to rush through a meal in order to get back to work.
And with that, John let the beat draw him in, and let himself go. His head was swimming, the air smelled of sweat, alcohol, and spices, it smelled decidedly masculine. He felt Sherlock’s hands sliding up his back, and fisting in his shirt. Tightening his arms, John pulled Sherlock’s face inexplicably closer, he could feel Sherlock’s breath hot against his cheek as Sherlock panted, evidently as affected by John’s proximity as John was by Sherlock’s.
“Fine.” Sherlock said, taking a deep breath. He really didn’t want to do this. “It started a little after term began. A person down the hall from me in my residence had taken to returning late at night intoxicated, and as a result of his inebriated state, made a lot of noise in doing so. As I do most of my work late at night, it was extremely distracting, and I told him so.”
The hours ticked by, and the conversation continued to flow. The crushing boredom from that morning became a distant memory. Not even the occasional poking and prodding by his doctor and nurses could dampen Sherlock’s mood. When it was time for a check, John would simply get up and give them some space, only to return and pick up the conversation where it left off.
Sherlock swiftly swung his leg over John to straddle his lap. “Excellent, because there were a few things I wanted to do last night before you fell asleep on me.” He all but moaned into John’s ear.
“Well that’s a relief,” John chuckled against Sherlock’s lips, his arms wrapped tightly around Sherlock’s back, “we still have three nights left here, and that would have been really awkward if you’d turned me down.”
Biting his lip, Sherlock continued to prepare Jack. Soon one finger gave way to two, Jack’s cries gave way to low, wanton moans, and by the time two fingers gave way to three, Jack was clinging to the headboard, writhing beneath Sherlock, his back rolling as he fucked himself on Sherlock’s hand.
“To make you
“That was not as good a time as any! You didn’t think they looked a bit busy, maybe wanted privacy, like they were getting ready to…” She trailed off as her eyebrows rose.
“Ah, but that’s what you need to learn, John; people, in general, are idiots.”
“Leah Albertson,” The nurse – Leah – introduced herself, “I’m going to be Mr. Holmes’ nurse during days.”
“Mr. Watson, a pleasure to meet you at last. Do have a seat.” The man says, gesturing towards to a couple of folding chair to his left.
“Ok!”
“So you’re willing to go out of your way, to make
Seven twenty-eight.
But if the run in at Bart’s taught him anything, it’s that even after ten years, he is still not over Sherlock, and he cannot face seeing him on a somewhat regular basis.
If was good for Sherlock, then maybe…
Elsewhere, John finds out exactly why he was taken.
Less than twenty minutes after leaving Carrows, John was following Sherlock out of a cab, past the flashing blue lights of a police car, and into an honest to god crime scene. He couldn’t believe his luck, he absolutely loved hearing about Sherlock’s cases, picturing Sherlock dash about as he retold and relived his adventures, but now he was going to see Sherlock in action. It wasn’t just stories anymore; he was going to see it firsthand.  John couldn’t stop grinning, though perhaps that was a tad inappropriate, a woman had been attacked and her house burgled.
“I don’t mean it like that.” John groaned, blushing slightly. “I just mean… whatever’s easiest for you, whatever you’re most comfortable with, I’m willing to accommodate.”
“Oh… Ok… I,” John laughed, shaking his head slightly. “I had a whole speech planned, but… yeah, ok.”
Later, once the cab had dropped him off at his small flat, John was hanging up his jacket when he felt something in the pocket. There, folded neatly was the exact amount the job would have paid, and clipped to the cash, was a note.
John wasn’t even aware any time had passed, but he suddenly realized that only the first nurse remained in the room, and she was speaking to him, her voice now calmer.
“Sherlock.” John stuttered again, reaching out a trembling, blood soaked hand.
“Of course I am. I want to be married to the brilliant Sherlock Holmes, and no one else.”
“Good luck with the rest of the case, Lestrade,” John said as he started towards the lifts, “and don’t even think of calling us until tomorrow. Better yet, make it the day after.” Then dropping his voice so that only Sherlock could hear, he added, “because I have some drills to run through with you, Ensign Holmes.”
“Oh I know what a chokehold is,” Sherlock let a small smile creep across his face, “I was just wondering if you’re actually tall enough to reach my neck.”
“Glad to hear it.” John chuckled
“Really, because I’m pretty sure telling someone you only used them for a physically release puts a damper on any plans for a future relationship.”
“That’s true.” Butler said cautiously. He really just take their word as gospel and comply, Sherlock thought to himself. It would take far less time. “Alright, let me just go get it out of evidence.”
Once again, neither John nor Sherlock see fit to talk about this most recent development. But Sherlock does start staying over three or four nights a week. If they spend time together during the day, it’s a sure bet that Sherlock will stay the night with John, sex or no sex. Sometimes they don’t even have to have done anything together, John just gets a text saying Sherlock’s coming over, and that’s that. Sherlock claims that John’s flat is quieter and closer to the school, so he can get more work done. They both know the noise level is almost exactly the same and it’s only a couple blocks closer, but they don’t seem to care. Neither wants to talk about it, so they don’t.
What do you do when your best friend kisses you? What do you do when you kiss your best friend?
“But you can only say it for the first time, once.” Sherlock said, finally opening his eyes. “I don’t want the first time I hear you say it to be here. It’ll… It’ll taint it. Say it when we’re free, when we’re safe.”
“What?” Sherlock asked when John continued to stare at him, not saying anything, a confused, suspicious look still on his face.
“Yeah, maybe it is a bit, but it’s a harmless form of extortion.”
“No, no it’s fine.” John said, straightening up in his seat a bit. “I…huh… I’m surprised you didn’t figure it out already.”
By the time John is taken to the medical unit, he’s lost a lot of blood, and an infection has already started to set in. The rest of the medical team is able to gain control of the infection, but not before John develops a raging fever. He spends several days slipping in and out of consciousness. And if he happens to call out for Sherlock at the height of his fever, he is completely unaware, and no one ever tells him.
“Did you seriously think we wouldn’t notice that you’re
continues to develop and grow.
“Yes there is, you’ve been in a… in a funk ever since we got back. So come on, what is it?”
“Sherlock, in all the years I’ve known you, I have never seen you act like this just because a case has you stumped. Please tell me the real reason.” John’s brow was furrowed in genuine concern, John was always concerned about him. John was carding his fingers through his hair, and Oh god, it felt so good. John was so good to him, always caring for him, always looking out for him, always putting him first. John was too good to him. What had he ever done to deserve John?
Sherlock blushed. “Perhaps a bit.”
“Yeah, alright.” John snorted. “The next time someone kidnaps me, then offers me money to spy on a friend, I’ll be sure say yes.”
could never make it work!” Moriarty snapped. “He’ll end it!”
“I really am sorry I couldn’t be of anymore help.”
“Ready?” Sherlock asked
Sherlock turned to the woman. “Sorry Mrs. Hudson.” A genuine smile on his face. “We were just discussing how the weather is preventing John from being on his way.”
“T – touch me.” Sherlock gasped, canting his hips, grinding himself harder against John, leaving no doubt as to where exactly he needed to be touched. “I don’t know how much longer… how much longer I’m going to last… Pl – please I need you… to touch me.”
~***~
“Yes Mummy.” Sherlock grumbled.
(See the end of the chapter for
They knew each other’s bodies better than they knew their own, they knew each other better than they knew themselves. Without a word, John’s fingers slipped from Sherlock’s entrance, and their positions swapped, John on his back with Sherlock sat straddling his waist, John’s fingers outlining the thin white scar running up Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock could feel John’s length, rigid and hot, sliding along his cleft and brushing against his entrance. Sherlock’s own aching length stood straight, pressed flush against his stomach, pre-come leaking from the tip.
“The door slammed, and then I heard you yell. So I’ll ask again, is something the matter?” Sherlock sounded bored.
“Because he only has four pairs, and they’re all right here. And those were the shoes he was wearing on Sunday.” Sherlock said, pointing to a pair of sneakers. He seriously started to wonder about the Met’s hiring practices, if they made an idiot like Evans, a detective.
Don't you just love how stupid and oblivious they are? Each pining without the realizing the other is in exactly that same boat. I know I do!
“The paramedics just checked her out and she’s fine.” Lestrade said. “She has a mild concussion. Her friend is staying with her until her husband can get here.”
"I might as well be for all the good it does me.”
“Please, call me John.”
“One thousand?” Sherlock rolled his eyes, but the sides of his mouth quirked up all the same. “John, there’s no need to be ridiculous.”
Lestrade was embarrassed. Interesting.
“Other way around actually,” John replied, “I was looking for a new place to live, he had an extra room, so we’re flatmates too.”
“Well, this is a gym, there are showers in the back of the bathrooms.”
“Doctor, soldier, matchmaker, you’re a veritable triple threat.”
“Imagined all the different ways you could became mine.” John blushed. It was ridiculous, of all the stuff they’d said that evening, all the stuff they’d done, he hardly needed to be embarrassed anymore. “Every time you said something clever or rude, every time you did something amazing, every time you looked at me and smiled or frowned or sighed or rolled your eyes, I thought ‘What if I pull him in to this broom cupboard and steal all that focus for myself?’ or ‘What if after this run, I just follow him in to the shower?’ or ‘What if the next time he hears me having a nightmare, instead of playing the violin, he comes upstairs and makes me forget everything that isn’t him?’ Almost every night, I dreamed about it, but I have to say,” he added with a self-deprecating laugh, “a race home to snog on the couch w –”
They filled the rest of the night with slow and gentle love making. Their kisses languid, their touches loving. As amazing as the night had been, the excitement of their private game, John’s approach, the flirting, the toying with each other, the sex, and the idea of having something fast and frantic for one night only; nothing would ever compare to perfection they had together as their true selves. Flings and playacting was fun – everything with John was fun – but making love to, and being made love to by, John, his husband, his other half, his soulmate, words of love and adoration falling from their lips as they made physical the oneness they already knew in their hearts, was better. What Sherlock had with John was everything. They would definitely bring Jack and Liam – or whatever new names they would choose – out to play again, but only because they both knew that once those façades fell away, they would be John Watson and Sherlock Holmes again, and that, that was all they ever really needed.
wouldn't
An investigation of the household staff quickly turned up the son of the gardener, Jeremy Arden, a student who made extra cash acting as a general dogsbody for the estate, and was known for being a bit of a loose-lipped braggart. Sherlock had barely gotten one question out before a frightened Jeremy spilled the proverbial beans. Two men he had never met before approached him, asking him if it were true that he worked on the Linddard-Weston estate, and what it was like. Not recognizing that he was being pumped for information, and without any regard for his employer’s privacy or safety, the moron told them everything. He told them what he did around the estate, what a hassle it was getting onto the grounds and into the house, and the clever ways he’d figured out how to get around the security measures so he could finish his work in half the time. He even went on about how he preferred to work when Ms. Linddard-Weston was away on her weekly overnight trips to Oxford. If only she hadn’t cancelled that week’s trip at the last minute.
“Well you said nobody wants you to come, and I want you to come, so A plus B equals I must be nobody.”
“Don’t mention it.” Sherlock said, is mouth quirked up in a half smile. “You’re not going to bed now are you?” He asked.
“And you’re not just saying that because I asked this morning? You were still half asleep. You are not required to keep commitments made whilst partially asleep.” He hadn’t even planned on asking if John would accompany him on the trip back to campus, it just sort of slipped out. After the pub with all of John’s other friends, then John – his best friend – offering to share his room where they talked well into the night; after waking up that morning and looking across to the other bed to see John sleep rumpled and peaceful, Sherlock didn’t want it to end just yet. He couldn’t help himself; ‘let’s go back together’ was leaving his lips before he even realized he’d opened his mouth.
“There you go again,” Sherlock sighed in fake exasperation, “leaving it to me to make all the suggestions. I’m not sure I like this side of you, John Watson.” He teased. He couldn’t help it, John wanted to go on cases with him. He still wanted to be around him. Oh, it was Christmas!
“No, that never got much past kissing. You’re – you’re my first.”
John grinned and started unlocking the door. “I made the copies almost a year ago, so my crime is old news. Though let’s not add loitering to my criminal record.”
Not knowing what else to do, John grabs Sherlock by the collar, and kisses him forcefully pouring every emotion into it, letting the kiss say everything that had until now, been unspoken. It takes a moment, but John can feel Sherlock kiss back, mouth opening slightly to accept John’s desperate lips.
“Is Jack, yours?” Sherlock asked. Obviously it wasn’t, and sure enough, Jack just smirked as he turned without a word and headed towards the tables in the back.
“You and John, are you two… you know.”
John could barely contain his grin. “That’d be amazing, thanks!”
Sherlock had just started to settle into this new dynamic, the companionable silence of another body in the flat, getting used to John’s presence, almost enjoying it, when Mrs. Hudson decided to poke her head in. She correctly guessed that he had nothing edible in, and took it up herself to
“Mmmm.”
“Then fine, we’ll wait to get a bigger flat.” Sherlock sighed, and draped his arms around John’s shoulders, pulling him into a deeper kiss. Yep, the brilliant git was utterly powerless.
An hour later, the forensics team had processed every inch of John’s room, and were packed up and gone. They had taken prints from the window, all doors, John’s desk, his dresser, and even his school books. All of John’s shoes were bagged up, on Sherlock’s insistence, but not before Sherlock took scrapings from the bottoms. A mud sample was taken from small patch near John’s wardrobe.
John wanted to take him out to a celebratory dinner, a special dinner. Like a date?
“BuzzBee!” Sherlock exclaimed, grabbing the little plush bee before he could stop himself. Well, if his chances with John weren’t dead before, the sight of a nineteen year old clutching a toy to his chest had to be the final nail in the coffin. “I mean… uh… thank you. You… um… you didn’t need to do that.”
“There is nothing… nothing ordinary about you, John. You could never be ordinary,” Sherlock breathed. How could John ever think he was ordinary? John was a marvel.
“Cocaine. I had a sort of friend in university, he thought it leveled me out, made me more normal.”
“Sherlock. Oh God, Sherlock. What’s wrong? What’s the matter?” he asked – begged – his chest growing instantly tight
John, I’d –”
So? What'd ya think? Did I do good? Did I do right by our boys?
John waited a few moments until it looked like the man was done with whatever he was doing, before going over to take the seat opposite him. “Excuse me, are you a Mr. Lestrade?”
Oh yes, the day was definitely looking up.
“Might as well make something for dinner,” John said, getting up and heading for the kitchen. “I think I saw some chicken and a bag of peas in the freezer yesterday.”
“We’ll leave him alone, we’ll leave him alone!” Sebastian was blubbering now. “It happened weeks ago, why are you only coming after us now?” The pathetic worm didn’t know when to quit.
What? Why should John be the last person ‘out of everyone’ to… Of course, the alcoholic brother! He must not be straight. There was always something.
Please forgive any errors, I was super tired when I edited this. (Still am super tired)
“It was your watchband.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It’s not too bad outside now; we could brave the cold and go get something.” John said, slouching to stay at Sherlock’s eye level. “It’ll be my treat. Think of it as a thank you for being such a charming host.”
Next up, John gets some answers.
to John. Pin, thoughts, not now, for later.
Comments and corrections keep me young (and improve my writing), so don't hold back!
“Yes. If you’re not interested, it’s fine. I… I understand.” Sherlock’s words were rushed. Of course John wouldn’t want to come along. He had a real life putting his medical knowledge to practical use. John may have liked hearing about Sherlock’s cases, but seeing them first hand was an entirely different story. Not everyone found a fresh crime scene as thrilling as he did. John wasn’t like him, John was normal.
What if I just need you, Sherlock thought.
“That never stopped you before, just saying." Bill shrugged. "Now, if you’ll excuse me, there is a lovely little redhead over there, who I very much need to meet.” And like that, Bill disappeared into the sea of club goers letting loose after a long week.
"I am, thank you very much.”
“Only if you dance with me.” Sherlock murmured into John’s ear before standing up straight and taking a step back.
Coming back to himself only long enough to snake his arms around John’s shoulders and bury his hands in John’s hair, Sherlock pulled John into a clumsy kiss, and together they rode out the aftershocks of their coupling.
“Actually,
, John thought, still at a loss for words.
“Oh no, when I confronted him, he just brushed it off and ignored me. It wasn’t until I deduced him that this started. He didn’t take too kindly to me revealing his father’s gambling problem, nor that he was was seeing two other girls behind his girlfriend’s back. In retrospect, perhaps I shouldn’t have said it in front of said girlfriend, I didn’t want to cause her any emotional distress.”
*******
“Sherlock, dear, I hate to be a bother.” Mrs. Hudson said, an apologetic smile on her face.
“Ah, there’s the genius I fell in love with,” John grinned, threading his fingers through Sherlock’s, his thumb rubbing circles across the soft, warm skin on the back of Sherlock’s hand, “always thinking one step ahead.”
“Alright now, honest feedback,” John said once they parted some time later, settling back into the bed, his arms around Sherlock, “was there anything else, anything at all, that didn’t work for you? I know you said you loved it, but I’d hate to think we didn’t start your birthday off on the absolute best foot.”
“I can be friendly.” Sherlock huffed. “I’m friendly to you, aren’t I?”
“I can’t believe after all this time I’m finally getting to meet you, John.” Mrs. Holmes said once they’d all left the meeting room. She was a beautiful woman, sharing her son’s dark curls – though she wore them up in a loose twist on her head, and not haphazard and wild – she had the same sharp, cunning eyes which held a spark of curious excitement, and the same light – near flawless – complexion. “Though I do wish it had been under better circumstances.”
“Well I have to leave, but… well… you solve crimes for bloody Scotland Yard! I’ve got to know more about that, and Sunday’s my only free day.”
“Ok.” Molly said quietly. “My uncle Matt’s probably on duty. We’ll talk to him. He’ll… he’ll let us in.” Of course, Matthew Sanderson, assistant medical examiner based at St. Bart’s Hospital, and Molly Hooper’s uncle. The number of times Sherlock took advantage of that connection, how could he forget? Stupid. He was being stupid, he was being careless.
– own me –
“Ah. Well in that case, hurry up and heal; I want to get out there and see this battlefield of London of yours.”
John watched Sherlock walk away for a few seconds before his brain finally kicked in. He couldn’t let this happen, this is what he’d been waiting for and he couldn’t let even the slightest possibility of a second change slip through his fingers.
“That was Molly Hooper.” Mrs. Holmes said, when she re-entered a few minutes later.
John smoothed the hair away from Sherlock’s forehead. Leave it to John to offer comfort to the one part of Sherlock’s body that didn’t ache. “Lay back down… You did the right thing.”
– you can have anything.” John breathed.
This is kind of a filler chapter. Mostly I wanted to show that even though there are
“Fine, next week then. I want to see you front row center in the stands. With a flag… And an air horn… and your face panted!”
“Ah, that’s… good.”
ex-army doctor to finally silence the doubt.
“Sherlock that’s… Sherlock that’s fantastic!”
~***~
“So do you think we should call it a night? End on a high note?”
“About four and a half hours. Here,” John said, offering the glass of water and two little white pills, “you’re due for a dose of pain meds.”
I hope you enjoyed their happy relationship, because the angst starts next chapter!
“He never really expected us too.” Sherlock mumbled, not meeting John’s eye.
“It’s my garbage disposal.” Mrs. Hudson continued, ignoring Sherlock’s cheek. “When I turn it on, it makes a humming sound, but nothing happens. I tried shining a light down there, and I didn’t see anything jammed, but I can’t be sure.”
So today is my last day in Iceland with my sister before I return home, so I'm already sad. Then this morning, my phone got stuck in a perpetual reboot loop, and no matter what, nothing will fix it. I'm going to take it in when I get home (fingers crossed I make it back from the airport tomorrow before the store closes) but I fear I'm going to either need a factory reset or a new phone. Either way, I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose ALL my pictures, not just from this trip (minus those I took on my ipod today and the few I posted to facebook) but also everything from the past 2 and a half years. To say I'm SUPER sad is an understatement. I cried the entire way back to my room. I do have a nice dinner and hanging out with my sister this evening to look forward to, but still, I'm pretty blue.
“I see. So does this mean I’m no longer ‘Mr. Thursday Night’? I don’t know if I like the sound of ‘Mr. Friday Night.’ It makes me sound like some sort of lothario.”
“Oh dear, yes.” Mrs. Hudson nodded sympathetically.  “But it must be nice to be home again, getting to be with people you care about.” She added, glancing towards Sherlock, much to his dismay. Why couldn’t the woman leave well enough alone? Why was she so determined he have
“No, John. Christ, that’s not what I meant.” Sherlock groaned, closing his eyes and letting his head fall back against the back of the couch. “I told you I’m shit when it comes to expressing emotions.”
“Oh, as far as I’m concerned,” Sherlock grinned, “I’ve been married to you for over a year and a half already, we’re just making it official.”

This was a matter of the heart. John bit his lip, he couldn’t let himself think too hard on that point, he didn’t want to get ahead of himself.
“Johnny. Johnny, calm down! You’re holding your phone.”
“Diabolical scheme?” John frowned, what was the goofy sod talking about? “What diabolical scheme?”
“But ‘Watson-Holmes’ sort of flows better. Two syllable name followed by a single one.”
“Because it’s cramping, and I don’t want Heather killing us tomorrow. Don’t get used to this,” John added in a mumble, “this is the only time I’m ever doing this.”
Sherlock knew they were in no real condition, and nowhere in the right state of mind, but John slid a knee between his legs, and Sherlock couldn’t stop himself; their bodies moved together, worked together, Sherlock never wanted anything more. Letting out a whimper, Sherlock ground down against John’s thigh, and rocking himself up to meet John’s hips, he found John to be in much the same desperate state.
John wouldn’t say no to millions of pounds, but he never said anything about women throwing themselves at him, Sherlock noted. Was it really too much to hope for that women may not actually be John’s glass of tea? No. No, Sherlock’s seen the way women look at John – and how could they not – and the way John looked back. No, John liked women, he just wasn’t a womanizer.
“Yes. Tell me what you’re thinking, we can deal with whatever it is, and then be done with it.”
John lived only a fifteen minute walk from the school, Sherlock made it there in seven. What Sherlock saw as he approached the Watson home made his blood run cold, a police car pulling away from the curb and heading down the street.
“Too late, I know now.” John beamed again. Anymore of that and Sherlock was afraid his heart would skip an unhealthy number of beats. “So I expect to see you at the game tomorrow!”
“I… I did, yeah.” John stumbled, his cheeks turning pink, though that may have been from their resent activity. “I’m not assuming anything. There’s – there’s still time for me to change the reservation. I’m sure I can get us a room with two beds. Or – or if you want, I can try to book a second room,” he added hastily.
“Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing it.”
Not that he would ever admit it to her, but Nurse Leah’s little stunt with the sedative in the tea had really done the trick. Though not anywhere near fully rested, the six hours John got had done wonders. He felt more refreshed, calmer, and far more relaxed; though the fact that Sherlock regained consciousness for a bit may have factored into it.
“They have us in room 122.” John said when he returned from the check-in desk with two old-fashion keys. The inn John had chosen really was taking ‘authentic country charm’ seriously – aside from the high speed wi-fi of course.
“Whoa! Easy there, Tiger.” John laughed. “I really enjoy kissing you, so I’d like to maintain feeling in my lips!”
“Don’t say it was nothing, you’re upset. Given how we became acquainted, you have to know tackling McCall is hardly the most dangerous thing I’ve done, or will do. So what were you going to say, because it was clearly someth –”
“Good. Go change your clothes and I’ll call Angelo to tell him we’re coming.” Sherlock said with an almost dismissive wave.
“Well, is this really the best time? I mean, considering everything going on right now.”
“No, no, Mrs. Hudson, Grant is right.” Sherlock said, straightening up and looking around at their guests. “After months of listening to sound, logical arguments, John has finally done the sensible thing, and agreed to cohabitate with me.”
“Arse,” John chuckled. “So, anywhere you want to go while we’re out, or do you just want to head back to Baker Street?”
” John groaned and rolled them so it was Sherlock against the headboard with his legs around John’s hips. “I want-
“Whatever.” Sherlock grumbled. At least the new pen seemed to be working. The quieter Lestrade was, the better Sherlock could ignore him.

“Well I’m going to have to get up anyway to move to your couch. Actually, why am I in your bed in the first place?”
“Well, it certainly makes my job easier, kid. Let me just get someone to collect her coffee” The inspector laughs, leaving John and Sherlock alone for a moment.
“Awww… that’s because you are an idiot.” John chuckled. “But you look fine, honestly. No one’s going to care, no one’s going to look twice at you.”
They traded a few more slow kisses and lazy touches, until Sherlock finally succumbed to sleep, wrapped in John’s arms, lulled by his steady heartbeat and deep, even breathing. For the first time in a very long time, Sherlock felt safe and warm. For the first time in a very long time, he was truly content.
See you next update where our boy's connection and
“It is going to be so nice having someone up here who’s actually polite.” Mrs. Hudson stared pointedly at Sherlock, who just shrugged and smiled around his cup as he sipped his tea. “Now, once you’re done, I’ll give you a quick tour, then I’ll get out of your hair and let you two settle in.”

“I got full feeling and range of motion back, so I’d say so. I mean, it’s still aches at times, and I have that transient tremor, so like I said, being a surgeon again is out of the question.”
“Really?” John asked, sounding skeptical.
“The rest of – of our lives.”
Sherlock hung back, waiting for the mass of students to thin out a bit before going to look for his test, only when he when over to the picked at A – H pile, his test wasn’t there. Either someone had accidentally grabbed his by mistake, or…
“No, I’m serious, Sherlock. I’m going to throw this out. Hold on, I’ve got one of those microwavable wraps you can use.”
Ok, John offered up something about himself, now it was Sherlock’s turn. That’s how these things worked, right? “I’m quite familiar with Bart’s. I frequent it often.”
I should probably have said this before, but don't use these as a guide to self-defense. Everything in here is my poor attempt at describing techniques. If you want to learn to defend yourself, take a class!
“Sweet?! John, bite your tongue. I am not now, nor have I ever been, sweet.” Sherlock bulked as John shook his head, still chuckling to himself. “I am sorry, though.” He eventually added, once John had sobered a little.
“Oh believe me, you’re going to be sorry. Don’t even think about coming anywhere near Sherlock ever again. If I hear that you, or any of your friends, so much as looked at Sherlock wrong, I will do a whole hell of a lot worse than this.”
“He just got under my skin, that’s all. I can’t seem to shake him.”
“Are you ok?” he asked quietly.
“I guess… I guess, yeah.” John nodded. Christ, who knew befriending the man you pulled from a burning building could mean so much.
After that, everything that followed felt almost like a blur. Positions switched – oh yes, Sherlock spread out beneath him, that was more like it – and shirts lost to frantic hands, John finally –
It took a bit of effort – Sherlock’s kisses had done quite a number on him – but John managed to roll on to his back, to find himself caged between Sherlock’s arms.
“My shoes?”
“Don’t be ridiculous, you’re not going to be homeless. You’re going to crash at mine.” John explained, as if that didn’t have its own host of problems. “You know the couch isn’t half bad, no worse than the school mattresses at least.” He added.
“You, Sherlock, your sister, and your mother are all highly observant. Your father is high up in the government, and is grooming you to take over for him. Your mother is a highly respected mathematician, and she wishes Sherlock would have flowed in her footsteps. And Sherlock has a strained relationship with you and his twin, who’s off studying abroad.” Why is John saying this? He doesn't owe Mycroft anything.
“Mmmmm, right… uuuhh… it’s right… aaaah… so right.” Sherlock breathed, giving up control to John, following his lead. It was intoxicating.
“Oh, um, that’s good I guess.” What the hell had Sherlock said? “How is he? Is he going to be ok?”
“I’m inclined to agree, but only on occasion, and only,” Sherlock said, nuzzling his nose against the side of John’s face, “as long as I’m with you.”
“I have a better idea.” Sherlock purred, letting his feet drop to the floor. “We put the skull on the bookcase – obviously – and then you and I break in this couch.”
“Really, I’m the love of your life?”
“Sher –
*******
“I’ll do it, I know what to look for.” Sherlock said. He seemed to be doing everything already, he honestly did know if he could even trust the Sergeant with something as important as this.
“They’re two little old pensioners, I doubt they could do anything to you, even if they were pissed off as you say.”  Sherlock said when John finally finished up and made his way into their bedroom.
“John –”
Mrs. Hudson had stocked their refrigerator with several days’ worth of meals, but had warned them that it was
“Ugh, you’re ridiculous, did you know that?” John huffed, giggling right along with Sherlock. “You’re a ridiculous, ridiculous man!”
“I was… ah… uh… I was thinking I should probably get dressed.” John said slowly.
“Does she interrogate everyone you bring back to the flat like that?” John asked, starting to wash the dirty dishes. Something told him Sherlock was not going to do it, and he didn’t want to create a mess for Mrs. Hudson.
Still not fully trusting himself to speak without revealing just how deep his feelings for the mad bastard saying the most amazing things, ran, John instead brushed an errant curl out of Sherlock’s eyes and kissed every inch of Sherlock’s face – cheeks, chin, forehead, eyelids, eyebrows, and finally the plush lips he had been worshiping all evening long.
“No, I’m really alri –” John started, but an oxygen mask was already being trust over his nose and mouth, and another paramedic was forcing him into the back of the second ambulance to examine him.
“No, no, you stay here. I shan’t be long.”
“Good plan.” John smiled, watching as she rushed off.
“No, it’s fine. I was going to say, you’ve been watching me, but you haven’t approach me. Why?”
“You didn’t come by just to return my scarf, did you?”
(See the end of the chapter for
A small, reassuring smile formed on John’s face, as he threaded their fingers together and gave Sherlock’s hand a squeeze. “Well he’s a piece of shit little bastard, not worthy to even a millisecond more of either of our time.”
“Yeah, but we were just going over the results of the last test. I got a ninety-four, so I think it’s safe for me to skip and just look up what I got wrong.” John said. “Hey Molly, how’s it going?”
for Sherlock ‘finally finding someone.’ If anything, John seemed to find it endearing; Sherlock was simply embarrassed. The food was delicious, the wine was excellent, and the company was even better. Sherlock deduced customers; John laughed and egged him on, and even tried his hand at a few.
The inn’s restaurant couldn’t have been more perfect if John had designed it himself. It was small – only about ten tables – and the dim lighting and candles on each table made it feel all the more cozy and intimate. With hands held across the top of the table, and feet brushing calves underneath, they split a bottle of wine, stole food off each other’s plates, and laughed as they eyed their fellow diners and flirted with each other. It was the perfect romantic dinner to start off their anniversary weekend, and John hoped it was a good sign for the rest of the trip.
John was met with only silence. Sherlock just stood there blinking rapidly, his mouth opening and closing but no sound coming out. Shit, he shouldn’t have said that thing about girlfriends and boyfriends. He knew Sherlock didn’t go into that kind of thing, and he’d made him uncomfortable. Shit, shit, fucking, shitting, shit, shit.
Receiving amorous looks was not a new concept for Sherlock, but there was something different about this man. Usually when someone at a club looked at him with interest – and this man was clearly interested – they almost always tried to approach him, but this man didn’t. He seemed content to just stand by himself, and take in the scene, take in Sherlock, but not engage. He was interested, but wasn’t making a move, why?
“What is it?” Harry asked,  having sat up and stopped her channel flipping, and was now looking at John with concern. “Johnny, what’s wrong?”
“Are you alright?” he asked, running his hands up Sherlock’s sides, Sherlock’s body warm and trembling under his touch.
Sherlock’s head snapped up, and he found himself looking at John for the first time since the conversation started. He wasn’t sure what he’d been expecting John to say, but whatever it had been, it wasn’t that.
“Oh, but before you forget I exist, is there a chance you have a charger that fits my phone?” John asked.
Move to the other room… Oh Jesus.
“Just because you two started out like… that,” Mrs. Hudson said, breathing hard through her nose, “doesn’t mean it can’t become something more. And you clearly do want something more with John.”
“Sounds like something he’d do.” John laughed. “But nope, I’m real.”
“Can I go with yoooou?”
“Dear lord, how hard did she hit you?”
“I mean,” John continued, oblivious to the panic coursing through Sherlock at that very moment, “out of everyone, I should be the last person to jump to that conclusion.”
“My brother’s just throwing his ever expanding weight around, don’t worry.”
“Here, let me.” John said, reaching for the lube, intending to prepare Sherlock. He had been told on more than one occasion, by more than one partner, that the way he prepared them was almost as good as the final act.
Deciding to hold the wedding at the Holmes’ really was the best decision he and Sherlock had made.  The sky was clear, the air was crisp, and the sun was out, leaving the late September afternoon just the right temperature for an outdoor ceremony. They had set up the chairs facing the overflowing garden, and the fall flowers were bright and in full bloom, making for a perfect background before which to get married. John really couldn’t think of a more perfect day, or a more perfect place to start his shared life with the man he loved.
Could he bribe him to stay? No, no that wouldn’t work, John was not one to take bribes.
We're inching ever closer to the end, but there are a few more chapters of oblivious, pining slow burn to enjoy (hopefully enjoy)
Sherlock made a noncommittal grunt, and continued to scowl as he looked out the window.
“Oh honestly,” Sherlock rolled his eyes, “it’s clearly a gift or else you would have unpacked it yourself. It’s for me because you made a point of leaving it in the entry as opposed to bringing it into the flat proper. You also intend to give it to me now because it if was for some later occasion, you wouldn’t have left it out on the table and instead would have put it away. So…”
“Yes, well something tells me he arranged it that way. It’s as if he’s embarrassed by his old mum.”
“Well what else does it stand for, then?”
*******
“Hold on,” he frowned as he offered John a hand, “did you just call me ‘Bee Boy’?”
Sherlock knew John was being funny, that he didn’t mean anything more – wasn’t implying anything more – but he rather liked the idea of being John’s Mr. Thursday Night. Just the thought of being John’s something – anything – was enough to stoke the now all too familiar warmth in his chest, the warmth that only John alone could inspire. Sherlock was getting in way over his head, but he honestly couldn’t bring himself to care.
“Are you ready?”  He asked, taking Sherlock’s hand and giving it a brief squeeze.
“Did you… Did you mean it? Are you really in this one hundred percent? You weren’t just saying that? We’re a couple now, we’re together? Really together?” Sherlock asked, nervously looking down at where he held one of John’s hands in both of his, their fingers loosely intertwined.
It was about two weeks in by John’s estimation, when the Voice finally snapped.
You know how they say that diamonds are a girl's best friend? Well comments and corrections are THIS girl's best friend (along with diamonds)
“Oh, I don’t have you listed as one of Mr. Holmes’s doctors. Will you be taking part in his care here?” The nurse asked, scanning Sherlock’s chart.
“I guess I never quite managed it.” Sherlock blushed. “You know what, never mind. Forget I said any –”
“I think the word you’re looking for is ‘relationship’, and of course I’m getting something out of it. I get to share my life with the most brilliant, most gorgeous, most wonderful, most amazing man I have ever met. I get to be with a man who fills my life with excitement and such unrivaled happiness. And well… let’s just say I have yet to be left unsatisfied in
“Good. And cases for Lestrade? You proved surprisingly helpful yesterday.”
Sherlock’s heart skipped yet another beat – or five – and for a moment, he forgot the world around him, focusing only on how he got so lucky as to have John Watson in his life.
His senses had only just begun to return, when John felt Sherlock’s hand on the back of his neck, and he was being pulled down into a hard, uncoordinated kiss. Mouth thoroughly claimed, John rode out the rest of his orgasm with Sherlock, his thrusts slow and careful, so as to not aggravate their already oversensitive bodies.
Sherlock only blushed harder, and buried his face in John’s neck, his curls tickling the bottom of John’s chin. “So what you’re saying,” he said, his voice muffled, “is you would have made sure we met anyway?”
“What's a gorgeous, posh thing like you, doing sitting down while there’s music playing? It seems a crime not to get you out on that dance floor.”
