“Take it off me. Whatever’s rolling off it seems more drawn to you than me…” Castiel stepped forward hesitantly, holding the book out for Dean to take. Dean blinked again, leaning over the sofa as he moved to take it, trying not to let himself be puzzled too much at the Familiar’s sudden need to get rid of it. He blinked again as he took it, eyes going wide at the warmth radiating from it.
“... Huh.” Sam turns away from the two of them, trying to give them more privacy in the vastness of the warehouse, taking in the emptiness and the quiet that now blankets the atmosphere. He squints at the door on the far wall, taking a few steps towards it before stopping and turning back.
“Are you okay, Dean?” His hands froze in place before slowly lowering them from his face, eyes lighting up in a way that had Sam squinting in confusion as he leapt to his feet, capturing the angel in a tight embrace.
, careful is my middle name. I know what I'm doing, just let me handle it." More pauses as they paced back towards Castiel. "Yeah, whatever." There was a soft thud somewhere to Castiel's right, and the mysterious voice groaned. There was another groan, closer this time, followed by the gentle hand resting on his fur again.
“That…” Castiel pauses, tilting his head before nodding in agreement. “Actually, that’s not wrong.” The grin Dean gives the angel only makes him laugh, pressing a chaste kiss to the hunter’s lips before he pulls away. He laughs again at the keening noise that comes from Dean’s throat, turning away and pulling Dean along with him as he does so.
“Happy Birthday.” Jack stands as Eileen leaves, brushing specks from his jeans as he does so, beaming at Dean again.
“No problem, Dean.” Castiel’s gaze lingered on Dean, the Empath coughing before clapping and starting to turn towards the door, pausing just as suddenly.
“I… Sorry. There’s just so many things I’m curious about, I don’t want to cross any lines and make you uncomfortable.”
“I love you too, Dean. With or without wings.” He pressed a soft peck to the hunter's lips before pulling him closer, stroking his wing as Dean fell in to a gentle sleep.
“I know it’s really damn powerful - I mean, you don’t have to be an Empath to feel how the magic is rolling off it.” He paused, peering over the back of the sofa towards Castiel who was leaning on the doorframe. “You
I don’t know if it’s the book though. I- Dean?” He stood, brushing bits of fluff off his legs as he turned back to Castiel. “Take it off me.” Dean blinked, dumbfounded.
“Usually our wings wouldn’t have to be corporeal to fly, but given your current circumstances I imagine this might make it a little easier for now.” Castiel stepped forwards, hands outstretched as he looked calmly towards Dean. “Do you trust me?” Dean gulped, hands shaking slightly as he clasped Castiel’s. He could only nod in response, looking down at his feet as Castiel adjusted his stance.
“Is- Is this…?” He took another hesitant step forwards, hand itching to reach out and see if Castiel was really there or not. “Is this real?” Dean hadn’t realised he was moving again until he could see the blue of the angel’s eyes, close enough for him to reach out and feel the course material of the trenchcoat between his fingers.
“If it was so much of a stretch, how do you explain this?” Sam took the feather from Castiel, turning it over multiple times himself, holding it up to the light to see if any more information could be gained from it that way. He frowned, running his fingers along the spine before sighing and handing it back to Castiel.
“Home sounds good. Home sounds really good, Dean.” His head doesn’t stay there long as he pulls away, pressing a quick kiss to Dean’s cheek before a shit eating grin works its way on to his face. Confusion flashes across Dean’s face as Castiel scans the immediate area, his grin getting wider before the confused look turns to one of realisation.
?” A small flame flickers to life in her palm as her anger flares, Castiel moving away just in time as it connects with the wall he was in front of seconds ago. “You’re going to come back with me, and you’ll serve your penance for running away in the first place. Then we’ll see how you can start making it up to me, dog.” Another fireball barely misses Castiel as he ducks behind the sofa, hearing the
“Course I will. Promise.” Dean ruffled the fur between Castiel’s ears before standing, knees popping in protest. “But for now, I need to get back to those herbs, and I need you on two feet, not four. Sam’s due to be here any minute, I don’t want to get an ear-lashing just ‘cause we’re a little behind.” A hiss from the kitchen had Dean whipping around, dropping the book back on the sofa before running to find the pot boiling over, happily bubbling away to itself.
” He slid next to the Empath, ignoring the sting of splinters in his knees as he placed a hand on Dean’s arm to move him closer. The flames burnt through clothing until Castiel had skin contact, not realising until Dean let out a small gasp. His eyes slowly flickered open before quickly closing again, bringing his other arm to cover them.
” Dean’s voice is quiet but insistent, bordering on pleading, and Castiel crumbles as he lets out a soft whine. “Oh,
as it flies past his head, colliding with a different wall. He growls as he peers over, quickly glancing between where Dean is lay and where Naomi stands, trying to work out if there’s any way he can lead her away from the only person who has ever given him the chance to just
“Dean…” The warning tone in Castiel’s voice gives him pause, huffing as he receives a glare of his own off the angel. “Let’s not mess with Sam while he needs to drive. You don’t want to be stuck in that position longer than you need to be, do you?” Dean’s jaw unclenches, the grace leaving his eyes as whatever plan he had is shelved.
“Okay, we don't need that, do we? Surely we can talk about this, work something out?” The words went over the witch's head as she zeroed in on one of Dean's longer feathers, ghosting over it, purposely taking her time in choosing one. He felt sick as she stuck her hand in amongst them, running it down the spine of a particularly long feather. Dean looked away, eyes clenched tight as she moved on to another one, trying to ignore the crawling feeling having her hand in his wing was giving him. She began to hum, a light-hearted tune that did little to quell Dean's fears, breaking it with a small gasp.
and it killed me inside knowing that there was no way I could say it back and-” The rest of the sentence dies in Dean’s throat as tears spill freely down his face, hand bunching in to Castiel’s suit jacket tightly as he uses the grip to ground himself. He can feel other tears too, briefly glancing up to notice them also freely falling from Castiel’s eyes; the smile on his face is something Dean will forever commit to memory.
“Damn witches got this place kinda warded against angels, I don’t know if that’s just old now so it’s lost some of its juice or something… I think it should have killed us if it was fresh.” Sam pales then as Dean shrugs. He hadn’t thought how angelic weapons might have an effect now on Dean, making a mental note to keep an especially close eye on anything angelic looking the witches might pull out of their sleeves.
“Wait, Cas. Cas!” Sam grabbed the angel's arm, stopping him from going any further. He looked at where the hunter had his arm, one eyebrow arched in question, still turned towards the warehouse.
“No, I can't feel anything.” He poked at it, trying to get some sort of reaction from it, confusion setting itself firmly on his face. “Strange.” Castiel squinted, something about it seeming achingly familiar. He tilted his head to see if a different angle would yield any answers, feeling like they were tantalisingly close to being discovered yet remaining irritatingly just out of reach. Sam looked on, not understanding how grace could be coming from a wound that didn't exist, how it didn't seem to be bothering the angel as much as he thought it should be doing.
Castiel sighed and shook his head, not getting more than ten steps before doubling over, gritting his teeth in pain. He pulled the trenchcoat further around himself, trying to stop the pain spreading from his shoulders to anywhere else, a small grunt escaping him. Sam had knelt down beside him at some point, and Castiel was beginning to think that the concerned look had never really left his face at all since he had arrived.
"Dean, how did this happen?" Dean shrugged his shoulders, causing the new appendages to give him a small amount of lift that greatly reduced the pressure on Castiel's chest.
“If it doesn’t burn, it’s not coffee.” Dean brought the mug to his lips, sighing as the first sip graced his tongue. “Also - not coffee when you add any of that other fancy shit to it either. That is the hill I am willing to die on.” Castiel laughed again, shaking his head before taking another sip of his own, turning his back to the window as he leant against the countertop. He smiled as he watched Dean take another mouthful, enjoying the way his eyes closed as he savoured the flavours and the way the mug lingered against his lips for a brief second. He could feel the blush cross his cheeks as Dean met his gaze, winking before pulling the mug away from his face.
“So. Moving to the heart of the warehouse then? Shall we?” Castiel led on, Dean following closely behind. Sam hung back, still in a small amount of shock at the sight of the wings that protruded from his older brother’s back, still trying to process how almost natural they looked there. They moved with him as if he had always had them, and Sam couldn’t help but wonder how he seemed so comfortable. Trying to figure out how to get him back to normal was certainly going to be fun, his brain unhelpfully giving him the doubt of
“What the fuck?” He shrugged, favouring trying to get out of the binds, ignoring the increasing volume that still sent a shiver down his spine. He was so focused on the bind that he didn’t notice one of the witches coming in on the other side of him until she was right by him, her breath in his ear snapping all his attention to her. She tutted, waving her hand over the work Dean had managed to do, the tension slamming his arms back down again with more force than before. He hissed at the pain, groaning as the metal bit in to his wrists.
"I..." The answer clicked before Dean could get the rest of the sentence out, and Castiel moved so he could reach the join on the hunter's back. He slowly raised his arm towards the left wing, looking at Dean for confirmation that he could touch, and gently placed his hand where the problem seemed to be. He gently scratched the area, making Dean produce a low moan as he dipped his head as a sign to let Castiel continue. Castiel didn't acknowledge the moan, too wrapped up in how soft the hunter's wings were - they reminded him of a fledgling's wings in colder months when they left heaven. He hadn't realised that he'd started to stroke along the bone until he could no longer reach from the position he was in and abruptly stepped back, clearing his throat.
Dean’s sure if Castiel was in his human form that he would definitely have a shit-eating grin on his face, shaking his head as a smile settles on his own face.
“Cas!” This time he stops, letting himself flop to the ground as Dean reappears in his vision; lying down with a thud as he covers his eyes with his arm. “Dammit, I didn’t realise you had
of that needs going over so I don’t injure myself in other stupid ways, because you know the chances of that happening are higher than you’d like to admit.”
He couldn’t help the huff of laughter as Dean lifted his head just enough to shoot Castiel a brief glare before letting his head fall back to the ground with a small thud.
” She snarled as she pushed off the doorframe, not looking back again as she quickly disappeared out of sight. Castiel watched as she disappeared, releasing a breath he didn’t realise he had been holding as he began to slowly slide down the wall. He shot up again as he looked at the carnage she had caused, heart skipping a beat at seeing Dean still lying motionless near the fallen door.
“There is one way you could get back.” Sam shrugs as he says it, Castiel nodding as he works out what the younger Winchester is alluding to.
. The rumble sounded closer now, almost like thunder, yet it sounded too close to the ground. Castiel put it to the back of his mind, trying to get to the next area of forest, back under cover, safe. There was the rumble again, closer still, but he was so close to the forest. So close,
“That’s no longer any of your concern. Now…” Another step was taken, flames still surrounding his body as he approached where she had stopped. “
"Cas... Turn the light off, I'm tryin' to sleep, man..." Dean rolled over in the bottom of the shower, limbs tangling in wings and more than one expletive escaping his lips. "Ow! Son of a bitch!" Castiel laughed, opening the door to allow him more room, and the laughing abruptly stopped.
“Don’t. Don’t be sorry.” He gestures back to the bench, hand moving so their fingers are intertwined as Castiel sits back down. “You’re right, y’know? Being able to look forward to it
“We really need to figure out a way for us to talk, ‘cause this one sided stuff is getting a little old now.” Castiel lifted his head off his paws, rolling his eyes at Dean’s suggestion. If Dean had any magic, talking would be easy - the distinct lack of it made it almost impossible, and Castiel huffed. Of all the people that could have found him, of course it had been someone who he couldn’t communicate with. He huffed again, setting his head back on his paws as Dean looked on in confusion.
Castiel squinted as he noticed the tension that had settled in Dean's shoulders at the information, how…
“Shh...” Dean felt his throat tighten, words getting trapped behind the barrier that had been put in place, even noise to express his discomfort was having difficulty passing. “There, there... It's okay.” The witch patted Dean's cheek condescendingly before moving back to his wing, ignoring the small noises of protest he was able to make. She drew the tip of the blade along the spine of her favoured feather, stopping where it joined the rest of his wing before turning back to Dean with a malicious smile on her face. He shook his head, mouthing 'no', eyes screwed shut so he couldn't see what she was about to do. There was no warning before she sliced the feather from his wing, grace escaping from the wound, Dean crying out soundlessly as the pain rippled up to his shoulder. A low groan managed to work its way out from the barrier that had been placed on him as the pain subsided in to a throbbing sensation, but the groan was drowned out by the sound of laughter.
Flying - it turns out - really isn’t all that difficult once Dean finally gets the hang of it. He decides that having Castiel as a teacher is definitely a big help, staying patient with him as they get closer and closer to the Bunker, keeping a close eye on everything Dean is doing and giving pointers where necessary.
“Just tell me.” The hunter pinches the bridge of his nose as he sighs, steeling himself for the bad news that’s about to be given to him.
. There’s no malicious intent behind the way the grace explores his wing, probing in various places as it tries to find the source of the pain without aggravating it further. It moves smoothly over bone, inspecting every inch it can before pulling back to inspect muscles and tendons; the same level of care never wavering. It hesitates briefly as Dean’s breath hitches, pausing as Castiel notices the way the hunter’s jaw is set against the pain.
"It... Happens... When angels have a mutual attraction... To each other." Dean didn't say anything for a minute, standing rooted to the spot with his jaw hung open.
"Uh, same way I can feel the shock coming from you right now, the way I could feel your guilt - I'm an, um… Empath." He looked guilty as he said the word, rubbing the back of his neck and pointedly looking at anywhere but Castiel.
The worried look morphed to concentration, Castiel letting out an amused huff at the way the Empath’s face scrunched up.
In my life at the time who were less than pleased about it. Didn’t think it was any use for me to be one rather than a Witch like the rest of the family. That’s why I’m so good with herbs. I just wanted to feel
“Stuff can be replaced. People can’t.” Dean stopped grinding the herbs to briefly look towards the Familiar. “And I never said they’d
“I want you to have it. There’s no-one else I trust with it, and if anything were to ever happen, at least you’ll always have me with you.” The nonchalance in Castiel’s voice causes Dean’s brain to short circuit; staring at the former angel for a few seconds before he can fully process the information he’s been given.
"Okay. Always been a Familiar. Um… Can you do any magic yourself, or…? Y'know - just there to boost it for a witch?"
“Not yet. He does know about you though, just not that you’re who I’m bonded to. He thinks you’re bunking here, or something along those lines.” Dean shrugs, turning his attention back to the water on the stove. “Technically, he’s not wrong.”
“What?” Castiel whimpered, backing away as quickly as he could. He didn’t look to see where he was going, backing in to the counter, whimpering again as a mug fell to the floor, shattering as it landed. He stared at the pieces, trembling as Dean put the pestle down, unable to stop the whimpers from escaping.
“He didn’t do it alone, Sam.” A blush settles across Dean’s features as one of Castiel’s wings wraps around his, their hands still linked together.
“Cas... Damn... Need you...” Castiel looked straight into Dean's eyes, the green flecked with gold and overflowing with trust, causing the angel's wings to wrap around the hunters with a softness he wasn't aware he had.
Dean laughs again, shaking his head as he ruffles the fur between Castiel’s ears before letting his head fall back on the cushions of the sofa. He lets out a breath as he closes his eyes to match Castiel’s, the warmth from the fire and the comforting weight of the Familiar across his legs almost lulling him to sleep, hand absentmindedly working its way through his fur.
"They pretty Cas. Other angels are silly." Dean yawned, pulling himself closer to Castiel's chest and wrapping his own wings around himself. "Tired, Cas."
“Yeah, but if I had magic…” Dean sighed, wiping at his eyes again before setting his hands on Castiel’s fur. “If I had magic you wouldn’t have had to deal with the smell of that poultice for a start. And you’d not still be here waiting for everything to heal.”
“I don’t know what you’re playing at, or what your game is here, but rest assured… I am going to get this
“I'm glad it did, Dean. Though I'd very much like to keep kissing you now.” Dean laughed, and put up no fight as Castiel's lips met his again, still gentle and explorative.
“The day I pulled you from Hell was the day I stopped being Castiel, became Cas… Or at least that was the start of it. The birth of it, if you will. It only seems right that that be my birthday.” Dean’s still gaping at Castiel as he lets his brain catch up to what’s being said, the implications of it whirring around his head as the former angel just shrugs.
“What the hell even am I now, Cas?” Castiel knelt in front of Dean, copying his earlier action of holding his chin to look at him, his own wings materialised and radiating calm to try and alleviate the panic. It seemed to work as Dean's breathing became more even, wings settling and a resigned sigh escaping him.
“You almost sound disappointed, Dean.” Dean shook his head, a small smile on his face. The smile dropped as he looked around the room, taking in the damage, flinching at the door lying next to him. His head whipped back around to Castiel, eyes wide as he scrambled to standing.
Castiel smiles again before taking a deep breath, closing his eyes as he closes the small gap between the two of them; Dean’s lips are warm and pliant under his own, the warm feeling of home crashing over him as Dean smiles against him. The warmth of Dean’s hand against his face pulling him closer kicks his brain in to another gear, swallowing down nerves as he lets himself explore more of Dean’s mouth - the happy noise that comes from the Empath only spurs him on further. Castiel returns the smile against Dean before pulling away, resting their noses together as a soft laugh works his way from him, making Dean’s smile even bigger. He shudders as he lets out a breath, opening his eyes to find a soft look on the Empath’s face that makes his heart melt.
The concern in Castiel's voice was clear, and Dean could almost see the expression on the angel's face. He smiled, something about the concern almost comforting to him, knowing that he was worried warming his chest.
“Doesn’t always have to be this early… Right? Can I at least have the chance to wake up and have breakfast before you drag me out God-knows-where?” Castiel shrugged, unable to keep his own shit eating grin off his face.
“They don't believe me. Seems like leaking grace and wings is a good enough sign for them.” A rumble of disapproval was the only reply he got, followed by a brief feeling of defeat. Dean closed his eyes, trying to savour the connection, the closest he had been to Castiel since he had been taken.
be better… It took me by surprise is all. I never would have thought about it the way you have - when you put it out there plainly, it makes sense. Keep it.”
“Why can I do that? I- I’m not a witch.” Dean clapped again, the flames extinguishing themselves as he stared at the now empty spot in his hands. “Huh.” He clapped his hands together again, an almost child-like look of joy on his face as the flames came back. Castiel laughed, shaking his head as he watched Dean continue to clap over and over, getting used to the novelty of being able to do the slightest bit of magic.
"Can I see them? Wait, I won't get an ouch from seeing like Pam did, Cas?" Castiel laughed gently to himself, shaking his head in the process.
“Damn yes.” Castiel chuckled at Dean's whimper as he withdrew his finger, looking him straight in the eyes as he inserted two, angled the same way as the one on its own. Dean's eyes closed and his head fell back as he felt Castiel scissor his fingers, preparing him for more to come, and he pressed back to try and get as much of Castiel's fingers as possible. Castiel pressed his lips to Dean's throat, murmuring words of encouragement and praise in to the hunter's skin as he began to come apart on the angel's fingers. Another small whimper left Dean as Castiel withdrew his fingers once again, quickly replaced by a moan as three fingers replaced the two, the slight burn lighting up all of his nerve endings in a way that Dean didn't think he'd ever be able to put in to words.
“This could hurt Dean. Are you sure about this?” A wave of his hand told Castiel all he needed to know before gently placing his hand on the soft feathers of Dean's wing, slowly reaching out with grace to try and see if there was any left from trying to revert the spell. Something small but bright curled around the grace Castiel had reached out with, similar to his but also vastly different. It pulled at him, daring him to search deeper and Castiel willingly followed it to determine what it wanted to show him. The small tendril dragged Castiel's grace along with it, gaining strength and size until it had reached what it wanted to show. Castiel gasped, recognising the mass as Dean's soul, still as bright as when it had pulled out of Hell but intertwined with grace, clung tight and filling in cracks that formed though that time in Hell. He retracted his grace, partially in shock and came back to himself as Dean took in a large lungful of air that told the angel he'd been holding his breath throughout the ordeal. He took several more deep breaths before turning to Castiel, inquisitive look on his face.
?" He scrambled up in to a sitting position, ignoring the pain in his ankle as he stared directly at Dean.
“Are you really here?” The words come out as barely a whisper, Dean’s hand finding its way from Castiel’s trenchcoat to cup his cheek, surprised at the warmth there and the way Castiel leans in to the touch.
“So I’m grounded for the foreseeable?” Dean drags his hand down his face, hissing as his wings drop.
"Being Michael's true vessel must have some effect on how your wings work, and how they interact with others." Castiel's face lit up after this, the aftershock of their wing contact distracting him from any other rational thought. Dean looked puzzled, waving his hand in front of Castiel's face to try and get a response but there was nothing. He tried for a couple more minutes before giving up and poking his wing, the electricity feeling passing between them again. This jolted Castiel out of the dream-like trance he seemed to have gone in to, resulting in him looking at the space between his feet again, wishing the floor would swallow him whole.
“Hmm? Oh! I thought maybe we could go to the park, give you room to really run and really put your ankle to the test?” Castiel barks in response, surprising Dean slightly before he laughs again. “C’mon then - that park won’t wait all day y’know.” Castiel barks again, moving ahead of Dean in what he assumes is the direction of the aforementioned park, spinning to make sure this time he’s being followed. He feels like the wind could carry him the distance, taking more deep lungfuls of the air, almost wishing he could currently experience what it would feel like on his skin. He can hear Dean laughing behind him, the sound only lifting his spirits further as he barks again in his joy.
“Hopefully not too long. Your wings are already acting on instinct alone most of the time, it’s getting them to listen to what you want them to do now instead.”
“Oh. Apologies.” Castiel brought his arms up, wrapping them around Dean’s middle as he let himself sink in to the feeling. “This is nice.” Dean laughed, pulling away as he moved his hands to Castiel’s shoulders, hissing and dropping his left arm when it came up too high. He pulled the tattered remains of his sleeve to one side, eyes going wide again at the branded handprint before looking back at Castiel.
“I'm okay, Cas. Better than okay.” He cleared his throat, staring at their intertwined hands again. “Do you remember what I said when I was shrunk? 'Cause I meant it then, and I still mean it now, Cas.”
“I... Um... Thanks, Cas. For everything.” He looked straight into Castiel's eyes, the blue drawing him in. “I mean it. Thank you.” Castiel felt a small heat in his cheeks and gave the hunter a small smile.
He nodded sheepishly, hand finding its way to the back of his neck again as he looked anywhere but at Castiel. His gaze landed on his lap, hands falling there as they slowly began to wring against each other, a clear indication of nervousness.
“I… What I’m trying to say is… I love you too, Cas.” Dean lets out a shaky breath, pulling away just enough so Castiel can see the honesty in his eyes. “But it shouldn’t have taken for me to die to say it back. I should have said it so much sooner.” Castiel laughs, wiping away tears as he nods. The smile that meets Dean when he lifts his head back up is breathtaking, and he can’t help but match it with one of his own.
“I don’t think so?” He patted himself down, Castiel letting out a huff of amusement before resting his head on Dean’s legs. “Only thing I can think of is I feel more awake, maybe? I don’t know.”
Castiel slowly licked the palm of Dean's hand, making sure to get the whole wound and clean the blood up at the same time, not noticing the look of wonder that had made itself at home on Dean’s face. He sat back as he finished, head cocked in curiosity at Dean’s expression as he turned his hand every which way in front of his face. He made a fist, looking at that the same way before opening his hand again, laughing slightly to himself.
“No! You’re coming back… And I am going to find a way to tap in to your magic, family or not.” The calm demeanor slips from her face as Castiel sits down, keeping one paw on Dean’s leg as he lets out a defeated huff.
“You're important to me too, Dean.” With that, any space that was left between the two vanished, wing tips touching and intensifying the electricity, causing both men to drop their hands to their sides and moan at the contact. Dean brought his hand up to cup Castiel's cheek, and Castiel did the same before removing that space between them. The kiss was soft, both exploring each other for the first time with no sense of urgency until their wings pressed more against each other, breaking the kiss with another breathy moan. Dean smiled as he pressed his forehead against Castiel's, a small chuckle escaping him.
standing, other hands clasped tightly together. He coughs as their arms slowly come down, remnants of grace in both of their eyes as they too look around to make sure there are no witches remaining.
“I... Uh... I don't know, Cas. They've got me strung up, pinned down, something... Everything looks wrong and I can't even figure out which way is up.”
"No, Dean." He paused, trying to allow his brain to process the sight in front of him. "You... You're not a fledgling..." Dean stopped struggling long enough to let Castiel's words sink in, then slowly got to his feet with the realisation that he was normal size again. And stark naked.
“My apologies. I... I may have got carried away.” Now Dean laughed, and lifted Castiel's head to give him a chaste peck on the lips before pulling away again. Both sets of wings settled back in to relaxed positions as Dean linked their fingers together again, marvelling at how perfectly they seemed to lock in to place.
“You…” Castiel clears his throat, looking apologetic before Dean gestures for him to continue. “You asked me after your birthday when mine was. Obviously, being as old as I am, it effectively pre-dates time itself, so I wasn’t sure how to answer then. But… I think I know now. Or at least I’ve chosen one.”
” He moves back towards Dean, trying to shield him again as another fireball ignites in her hand, eyes never leaving it.
“Witches.” Castiel growled the word out, panic turning to rage as he remembered the night that Dean had de-aged to begin with. At least he had a starting point now as to who had taken Dean, even if the why currently eluded him. He growled again, cursing himself for not even considering the one witch may have been part of a coven, making a mental vow to make sure none of them would be left alive for taking his hunter. He grabbed his phone, making quick work of putting the number in, hoping that they would pick up first ring.
. Cas, I don’t know what to do here.” Dean’s knees felt weak, leaning against the countertop with white knuckles to keep himself from falling over then and there. Castiel moved his hand from the grounding, reassuring position to underneath his armpit, guiding him away from the pot and the kitchen, back to the sofa. Dean didn’t realise he was being lowered on to it until the edge of the book began to dig in to his leg, lifting up enough to move it just out of the way before fully collapsing in to the cushions. Castiel picked the book up, glaring at it again before moving it to a shelf; out of sight while they were due company, to be looked at in further detail later.
“Tsk, tsk, tsk. You just don't listen, do you?” The voice seemed to circle Dean, coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once, and Dean closed his eyes to stop himself feeling dizzy. “You killed our sister, took away our source of feathers... Now, you're our replacement. And if we can avenge our sister by using you, then so be it. Her death won't be completely in vain.” A strong hand gripped Dean's jaw and his eyes flew open, staring directly in to glassy green eyes, a sense of dread creeping in to him. His wings twitched, fight or flight instinct trying to kick in but the nails just dug deeper, and Dean was sure he could see grace seeping out of the wound.
“It's so nice to see you smiling... It makes you so much prettier.” Dean scrunched his eyes shut tighter, smile disappearing as he felt the witch get closer to him. His feathers quivered as she moved closer still, stopping as he heard the tell-tale sound of an angel blade falling in to her hand. His eyes snapped open at that, panicked as she sized up another one of the longer feathers. He tried to flatten them against whatever he was against, pulling against the pins in his feeble attempt to get them away from the witch. In his panic, he didn't even realise that this witch was different, his focus completely on the angel blade in her possession, getting dangerously close to his wing.
“No. It’s your birthday, you let people do things for you on your birthday.” Dean raises an eyebrow at Sam as the tray is set on the bed, 2 steaming cups of coffee and a pile of pancakes with bacon waiting to be enjoyed.
“I- What?” Castiel blinked, the statement taking him by surprise as Dean laughed again, bringing the mug closer to his chest.
“I’m here, Dean. I.. I don’t entirely know how, but I’m here.” Castiel’s words are equally whispered, leaning more in to Dean’s touch the longer his hand lingers there.
“Might have wings now, but a dude's gotta breathe.” Castiel laughed, resting his forehead against Dean's, both of them slightly out of breath.
“Um. I’m definitely something… Not sure if okay is the word.” Castiel placed his hand on Dean’s arm again, grounding him as he let out a shaky breath.
Castiel sat up, stepping off Dean before quickly looking around the park for any other people. He shivered, shifting back to human form before setting himself back down on the grass with his legs crossed under him, letting his eyes wander back over the constellation of freckles that crossed Dean’s nose
about the flames being there.” Dean’s brow briefly furrows in confusion before he shrugs, staring at his hands and willing flames in to existence. His eyebrows shoot in to his hairline as a small flame appears, laughing as it builds in intensity until it completely covers his hands.
“I can help with that, if you’ll let me?” Dean stilled at Castiel’s voice, turning his head slowly to look at the source. His eyes widened as he took in the image in front of him, wonder etched on to his features.
“Dude, I'm not an angel. And I don't care if being Michael's vessel or whatever helps them. I'm still me, and these aren't supposed to be here.” The wings on Dean's back untangled themselves from Castiel's, setting in a defensive position that Castiel knew meant he was uncomfortable with not knowing what to do in this situation.
The smell of smoke brought Dean back to his senses, the burning in his shoulders almost a welcome feeling that helped him know that for now he was still alive. He blinked a few times, vision staying stubbornly blurry as a fresh wave of pain rippled across his shoulders, gritting his teeth as he waited for it to subside.
“The rain. Figure we make a run back to Baby while there’s a break in it, go home… Dry off?” He leaves the unspoken
“Yeah, fine Cas. Got distracted trying to get a better look.” He gestured towards one of his wings, offering that as the only explanation. “Not really had a chance to see what they looked like properly in all this.” Castiel smiled, reaching out to straighten a feather that was crooked. Once it was straightened, he ran his hand down the feather, the electricity feeling running up his arm.
“... Son of a bitch, ow…” Both Sam and Castiel breathed a sigh of relief as Dean moved to a sitting position, rubbing at his eyes with the heel of his hands. “Shit, that hurts.”
“Just undignified… Being folded up in the back like this…” Dean’s muttering earns another snigger from Sam as he sits behind the wheel, patiently waiting for Dean to get mostly comfortable before starting up the Impala. “Drive like an asshole Sammy, and I will smite you.”
"Did I do something wrong?" Castiel looked at his feet but shook his head, wings almost in a defensive position. "Cas?" Dean gently lifted his head up and smiled, extending his other hand so it brushed Castiel's left wing and it extended of its own accord - shocking Castiel through both it and Dean's actions.
“You are still Dean Winchester, still the Righteous Man, still the brightest and purest soul I have ever been fortunate enough to lay eyes on. You are still you, and a good man at that.” Castiel removed his hand from Dean's chin and placed it on his knee to help himself stand. He moved to turn away but was stopped by Dean's hand on his wrist, pulling him back to where Dean sat.
“No, everything just feels the same. And it feels like nothing. I have no idea which direction will lead us to Dean.” He sighed again, wings settling in to a defeated position on his back. Sam placed a reassuring hand on the angel's shoulder, expression quickly turning to one of alarm as he looked at Castiel's wings.
A small blue flame sparked to life in her open hand, lazily rolling it through her fingers, Castiel's gaze glued firmly to it. The smell of singed fur invaded his nostrils as the memory of last time came back, quickly getting to his feet before he could upset her further.
“I’m not going to hurt you at all. Promise.” Dean gently but slowly ran his hand through Castiel’s fur, trying to calm him down again, trying to reassure him that he genuinely didn’t mean him any harm. Castiel blinked, looking back at Dean from the floor. He had a small but reassuring smile on his face, and he could see that there was no malice or even intent in his face. He let out a slow breath, moving to a sitting position before quickly glancing at the mug again. Dean moved back to give him space, hissing in pain as he put his hand down. Castiel froze, looking at his hand, whining when he realised Dean had cut himself on the shards. He blinked, gaze never leaving his hand as Dean lifted it to his face to get a better look at the damage.
“Maybe it's better if you lay down? You're less likely to fall off the bed that way.” The smile had reached Castiel's eyes, making the blue sparkle and Dean made a mental note to try and recreate that as often as he possibly could. Dean could feel the blush creeping back on to his face and he nodded, rubbing the back of his neck in embarrassment. He scooted up the bed so his head was comfortably on the pillows and stretched his wings out so they draped over the edges of the bed. He closed his eyes and waited for the dip in the mattress that signalled Castiel had settled in a position where he could reach comfortably. He didn't expect the warm weight to settle at the top of his legs, straddling him, and he opened one eye in curiosity. The trenchcoat and suit jacket had been discarded over the back of a chair, and Castiel was focused on rolling his second shirt sleeve up. Dean swallowed at the sight, the movement of his Adam's apple catching Castiel's eye.
“You’re a cocky bastard, y’know that?” Castiel huffs, sitting up from Dean’s leg as he looks over towards the fireplace. “If, um… How did you get away from her? The loophole woman?” Brief panic washes over Dean at the mention of her, an involuntary shudder working its way up his spine. Something about the way Castiel feels about the woman makes his skin crawl, scratching at his arm as he shudders again.
“He was adamant that he’d do it himself, Dean. Didn’t have the heart to say no.” Sam shrugs from the doorway before stepping in, allowing Eileen to follow behind him. Dean laughs before looking back to Jack, beaming at not spilling anything.
“I don't care. We've already figured that the spell has worn off, it's just these-” He gestured, trying to point at them. “-don't want to seem to go.” Castiel stood up, walking behind the hunter and looking for approval  before moving his hand over one of his wing joints.
Sam rushes forwards, pulling both his brother and the angel away from the fire, the flames rising higher as the witches scream in fury. “That fire is made with holy oil. And you’re both so intent on clearing out this coven that you didn’t even notice.” Dean blinks, the grace disappearing from his eyes as he realises what it is Sam’s getting at, Castiel’s wings moving behind him so they’re further away from the fire.
"Dean!" Castiel moved as close as he dared to the flames, powerless to watch as the witch worked her magic on Dean, enveloping him in a sickly green coloured fog. "DEAN!" It was then that she dropped him, green fog following him and keeping him in the cloud so Castiel couldn't see him. He did, however, notice the arm that shot up, catching her unaware and resulting in a knife plunged hilt deep into her chest, shattering the glassy look and causing her to explode into a green mist not dissimilar in colour to the cloud surrounding Dean. The holy oil was extinguished, and Castiel ran to where the Hunter had been dropped, the cloud dissipating as soon as he was within touching distance.
” Castiel saw the way Dean froze again as the bubbles disappeared, climbing back in to the pot as instructed. He gave a small but reassuring smile in response to the panicked look that had settled on Dean’s features, keeping himself calm for Dean to draw from.
It takes longer than Castiel would have liked for the dust to settle, his heart racing as he blindly tries to find where the door landed, to find Dean in amongst the chaos. He hasn’t felt this panicked in a long time, not since escaping from Naomi, since the first meeting with Dean however many days ago it was. He just about spots a boot sticking out from under the door as the dust finally settles, fairly certain his heart actually stops in that brief moment.
"Castiel… It’s nice to meet you, Castiel." He laughed again as Dean began to relax more against the sofa, hands dropping to rest on his knees now instead. "How long have you been a Familiar?"
“Then, by that logic, I choose September. Specifically, the 18th.” It takes a few seconds for Dean to realise why that date sounds familiar, pulse quickening as the realisation dawns on him. Castiel still offers no further explanation as he sips quietly from his coffee, watching Dean carefully as if to gauge his reaction. The hunter takes a deep breath, letting it out slowly as he schools his features back to almost neutrality; curiosity just about winning as he tries to put his racing thoughts into words.
Castiel whined, sinking back to the floor with a huff. When did decision making get so difficult? His gut screamed that going back to Naomi would be the end of him, huffing again as his head finally agreed that realistically that would be the only outcome. She wouldn't be happy about it, but Castiel decided that living sounded like a much better option to him than dying, and being away from her extended his lifespan significantly. He sat up again, confident in his decision not to go back, confident that she was never going to get a say in how he lived his life again. He smiled to himself, standing and stretching just as Dean walked back through the door.
“... Dean?” The words came out barely above a whisper, Castiel dropping to his knees besides Sam as he quickly looked the hunter over to assess any damage. He closed his eyes as he ran a hand over the older Winchester, it lighting up as he used his grace to figure out what - if anything -  was wrong.
“Dean?” He whips around again at the sound of his name, crashing forwards in to Castiel as the angel stands there in confusion.
is out of the way… Shall we?” Castiel only bares his teeth again as he continues to growl, moving to stand over Dean as she steps further in to the room. “I said move,
“... You know.... You never did tell me what you were.” The inquisitive look had settled on Dean’s face again, looking as though Castiel held the answers to the universe. He tilted his head, waiting for some sort of response, sighing when nothing came forwards.
“I’m looking at you like that because you’re beautiful… And all these flowers - the petals frame you perfectly - it makes you look like you’re straight from a fairytale. It’s breathtaking.” Surprise crosses their bond at how easily the words fall from Castiel’s lips, more blooms surrounding their feet as Dean closes the gap between them again, earning a surprised noise from the Familiar. Castiel can’t help the smile when they pull apart again, dropping his hands to his side only to have one immediately taken by Dean, a gentle kiss placed on his knuckles before being guided towards where the Impala was dutifully waiting for them.
Dean lowered himself back in to the grass, hands clasped across his stomach as he watched a cloud drift over, the silence doing nothing to help the way Castiel’s stomach dropped at the lull in conversation.
bad at cooking!” Eileen gives Dean a look from behind the younger Winchester; Dean dissolving into a laughing fit as Sam throws the bitch face between the two of them. “Cas, back me up here?” Castiel all but ignores him, staring into the bottom of his cup with his own eyebrows raised towards his hairline.
“Just let yourself glide down, open your wings out!” Castiel shouts from the ground, hands cupped around his mouth to make sure Dean can hear him as clearly as possible. He can’t quite see the expression on the hunter’s face from where he’s standing, fully expecting to have received an eyeroll in response, shaking his head as Dean doesn’t seem to get any closer to the ground.
“You carry on with that sappy shit and it’s gonna be like Hansel and Gretel but with flowers instead of breadcrumbs all the way home.” Castiel laughed again as Dean grumbled, hand on the back of his neck as the blush stubbornly refused to move from his face.
Dean’s hand stilled in Castiel’s fur, the Familiar looking up with head tilted as nerves from Dean washed over him.
"Dean! Dean!" Castiel banged on the bathroom door, but his cries were muffled by Dean's screams which abruptly stopped. The silence was unnerving and seemed to last forever until a sad whimper broke it. Castiel leaned closer to the door, trying to determine what could make a noise like that when it happened again, accompanied by the sound of sniffling.
“Thanks, kid.” He nudges Castiel, handing over one of the cups of coffee before the thought of murder crosses his mind any more. “There you go. Told you there’d be a peace offering.”
. He shook his head, clearing out the ifs and the buts to focus on getting to the centre of the warehouse, to killing the remainder of the coven. Sam could at least tell that Dean had the same idea there - regardless of the wings, his shoulders still squared the same once he’d set his mind to it, still had the same almost march towards his goal. The wings just added something else to the image, made him look more intimidating with the way he seemed to stand taller, as if he was more confident that people were going to listen to every little word he said. It was those same wings Sam smacked in to as Dean stopped, Castiel ahead with eyes closed and head tilted.
“... And you just expect me to believe that?” Castiel turned to Sam, rage barely contained, and stared with such ferocity that Sam was certain the angel was staring directly at his soul. He flinched, looking down at his hands before finding the courage to look back up again.
“Like learning how to land properly.” The small smile on Castiel’s face doesn’t go unnoticed by the hunter; shaking his head and laughing before squeezing the angel’s hand.
“I’m sorry.” Castiel was surprised at how small Dean had managed to make his voice, barely catching what had been said, being mildly thankful for his shifted form as the words otherwise would have been lost.
. And I know that’s unhelpful, but it’s all I’ve got.” Dean’s hands drop to his sides as he stares at Castiel, not staying there long before they’re running through his hair, a laugh bubbling up and out of his throat.
“No, nothing, all good, all fine.” He gave a thumbs up, quickly looking to the rafters rather than witnessing any more flirting between the two.
"I…" The words caught in Dean's throat. The hand that wasn't on Castiel's head was balled in to a fist, held tightly enough that the knuckles were going white from the pressure. He slowly let out a breath, releasing his hand and opening his eyes.
“I’m serious. I’m even gonna mark it on the calendar, make it official.” Dean’s heart swells to see the deep blush cross Castiel’s face, giving his hand a gentle squeeze before bringing his knuckles to his lips to place a tender kiss there.
"Let me go, Cas! Let me go!" Dean's now high pitched voice next to Castiel's ear was not something he had been expecting, quickly letting go of Dean in a vain attempt to stop his ears from hurting. He rubbed the inside of it in an attempt to stop it from ringing, looking at Dean with his usual calm expression.
“Oh, honey... I wouldn't move too much if I were you. We don't want you damaging those pretty wings of yours, do we now?” Dean looked to his left, wing completely spread out and nailed down so he couldn't move it even if he wanted to. He looked quickly to his right, the same image meeting him, the phantom pain he couldn't pin down he now realised was whatever his captors was using to keep his wings in place.
“Go on kid, go nuts.” He doesn’t expect the hug that comes flying in his direction, only just moving his cup out of the way in time to avoid coffee going everywhere.
“Your run, then we talk about it. It’ll give me time to figure out…” The blush creeps back on to Dean’s cheeks, Castiel placing his hand on his arm where the brand to mark their bond is as Dean’s blush darkens. “It’ll give me time to figure out how to word everything. Hopefully.”
“Shit, I am so sorry. I didn’t think… Shit, shit, shit.” He straightened up as Castiel growled again, electing to give him space. “I’m, um… I’m gonna go over here, and try make something that’s gonna help with that pain, I think. Yeah. Help with the pain.” Castiel watched him as he retreated in to a different room, leaving him alone for the first time since escaping Naomi. He sighed, slowly moving into a sitting position to get a better look of his surroundings. It was a modest space, comfortably decorated but well lived in. The furniture bordered between well-worn and threadbare, throws and blankets hiding what Castiel assumed were the worst patches, where the most wear was. It certainly wasn’t unloved by any estimation, that he could appreciate - it felt like a home. He tentatively sniffed the air, the smell of multiple herbs swirling around, mingling with the musky smell that seemed to blanket the stranger’s home. He vaguely recognised some of the herbs that were being used - something to reduce the pain in his ankle and ribs, something to make him feel more relaxed; he was also fairly certain that there was a little bit of whiskey in there. Castiel huffed in amusement, wondering how the alcohol would affect him in his shifted state, if it would do anything to him at all. The train of thought was interrupted as the stranger reappeared, holding a bowl with steam merrily rising out of it. Castiel was confused at the slightly guilty look on his face as he approached, tilting his head to indicate it.
“Take all the time you need, Dean. I’m not going anywhere, promise.” Castiel doesn’t realise what he’s doing until he’s done it, pressing a chaste kiss to Dean’s cheek before turning his attention back to the stovetop, feeling Dean’s response through the bond as he feels his own cheeks heat up from his own blush. He can’t help the smile at the spluttering noises that manage to escape the Empath, suppressing a giggle as the thoughts he receives flounder in his head.
“Dammit.” The words are muttered under breath, fist clenching in frustration as Sam tries to stifle a laugh. “So how the hell am I supposed to get back to the bunker now? Throwing up isn’t exactly fun, and I’ve no plans on doing it again.”
“Nothing! Although I think you might have been right about it being drawn to me.” Dean looked at his lap, turning the book over in his hands. “It’s weird though - I can’t feel it anymore. Not in the same way… It’s obviously magic, and it had a
"I don't know, I've never seen them before. I… I have a feeling they're something new though. They feel new." Castiel's smile gets wider as he looks back at Dean, unable to help the way his breath hitches in his throat again at the sight of Dean surrounded by flowers of their own creation; the light reflecting off them the same way as from buttercups but with a turquoise hue. Castiel steps back as Dean sits up further, squinting and tilting his head as he looks at the new foliage.
“Maybe you’ll allow yourself the same luxury, Dean?” Dean stops briefly, the bacon in the pan offering the only sound in the room as the whisk stills in the bowl; the drop of Dean’s shoulders not going unnoticed by Castiel. “I- Seeing you so happy and carefree, without the weight on your shoulders… Just being able to feel that happiness is elating.” The whisk slowly starts up again, and Castiel can feel the thoughts spinning around Dean’s head at a million miles an hour. He flips the bacon over again, taking it off the heat with a knowing smile as Dean’s thoughts slow down, turning to meet the Empath head on.
“Now you just have to think about what you want to do when it gets here. Don’t worry though, you’ve got plenty of time.” Castiel turns, lifting himself up just enough to kiss Dean properly as he hums in contentment.
Castiel rushes forward as Dean collides with the ground, legs collapsing under him as the rest of his weight falls on them, one wing catching the ground with a noise that makes Castiel feel sick. He’s surprised Dean doesn’t cry out, instead watching the hunter go pale as a deep grimace settles on his face.
“Okay. Let's figure out what's changed.” He motioned to Castiel to follow him as he crept towards the warehouse, the exterior giving away no clues whatsoever. Castiel rolled his shoulders, letting his angel blade fall from where it was stored in to his hand as he followed the hunter, hoping that the witches hadn't laid a finger on Dean.
Dean moved away from the door again, sighing as he made his way to the kitchen. Castiel followed, head tilting to one side as he sat in the doorway, Dean pulling more herbs down from the ceiling before cracking his knuckles. He looked around quickly, eyes lighting up as he spotted the large bowl in the corner, moving it to the island before cracking his knuckles again.
“Once the smell of the poultice has gone, maybe we can try some stuff to strengthen your ankle back up? Outside?” He briefly turns back to the pan, flipping the burgers before turning back. “I don’t know how you’re not going stir crazy stuck inside all the time.”
Sam couldn’t keep the smile off his face as Dean took deep breaths next to the Impala, trying his hardest to keep the panic from bubbling up to the surface. He wasn’t sure if Castiel knew how much his brother absolutely hated flying - in planes at least - but he was curious to see how he’d handle actually being in control of it. He was slightly disappointed that the cooler in the trunk was empty, in half a mind to pull it out and get himself comfortable to watch Dean try and follow Castiel’s instructions.
"... I know you're awake, y'know." Castiel tensed, holding his breath, not daring to open his eyes. He was safe if he kept his eyes shut, couldn't see whoever was going to give him back to Naomi, couldn't fall for one of her tricks. He hadn't realised that he was panicking until the hand tentatively starting stroking his fur, trying to calm him down.
Castiel stood up, trying his hardest to keep any weight off his injured ankle so Dean could get a proper look at what he meant. It was a strange feeling, having eyes on him the way Dean had, intrigue on his features rather than the disgust that he was used to seeing on Naomi’s face whenever he shifted. If it was possible for humans to have literal heart eyes, that is what Castiel would describe the look as. He shifted, moving his weight on to one of the other paws before settling back down, stretching out the leg with the bad ankle.
“Okay, that’s fine - but I need to know some specifics so I know what I’m putting in here. How many times you fell on it or whatever, if you’ve done anything that could have made it worse, etc.”
“Um.” Castiel mirrored Dean’s earlier action as he rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment, trying to avoid eye contact. “It was an accident.”
“I… You don’t have to talk about it if you don’t want to, I just…” Dean sighed, suddenly sounding incredibly weary. “You don’t deserve to be treated like that, y’know? Just ‘cause you’re
“Thank you.” His voice is hoarse from misuse, clearing his throat again before taking another step closer to Naomi. “Now. You’re going to turn around and leave. You’re never going to darken this doorstep again. If I find out you have… There’ll be hell to pay. Do we have an understanding?” Naomi only has a dark look in response, turning quickly and marching towards where the front door should have been. She paused in the doorway, hand gripping the frame as she glanced over her shoulder.
“... Don’t you dare.” Castiel takes a step back, stretching briefly before grinning again. “I’m serious Cas, don’t even think about it.” He lets his face fall to complete innocence before shifting, turning and sprinting away towards where they entered the park, leaving Dean standing in place with a dumbfounded expression on his face. He briefly looks back to make sure he hasn’t run too far ahead, that the Empath could easily catch up if he wanted to as he watches Dean shake his head, beginning to run himself before turning back to watch where he’s going. Dean’s amusement washes over him, fuelling his joy as he picks up slightly more speed, relishing in the pure freedom that he’s beginning to grow accustomed to. He lets the fondness from Dean warm him, returning it as he quickly looks back again to make sure he can still see the Empath; his own fondness giving him pause. He doesn’t realise he’s actually stopped until he feels Dean’s hand in his fur, concern etched on to his face.
.” Dean twirls the blade in his hand as if it’s the most natural thing in the world, a comforting weight to him as if he’d always had one. The grace is still prominent in his eyes, anger bubbling just under the surface despite his otherwise calm demeanour. Castiel is almost a mirror of him, wings in a defensive position as they cross the threshold of the room where the fire merrily burns away. Sam pauses as he takes in the room; the fire burns a line directly through the middle, witches grinning on the other side of it as he realises that the strange smell in the room is oil. Dean and Castiel don’t seem to notice as they stalk closer to the fire, to the witches who are all but beckoning them towards what they know is certain death for the pair.
“Most probably. Which reminds me...” Dean absentmindedly takes the cup from Castiel as it’s handed to him, allowing him to rummage through his drawer before turning back with a nervous expression on his face, small box in hand. “Happy Birthday, Dean.” The cups are gently placed on the tray before Dean takes the box from Castiel’s hands, brows furrowing at the warmth coming from it.
“Oh dear… That’ll teach the stupid boy to stand behind doors, won’t it?” Castiel whips around, teeth bared and growling as he sees Naomi stepping over the threshold. The warding that Dean had spent so long getting in place and perfect briefly glows before bursting in to flames, rendering it now useless; Naomi looks unfazed as she picks a splinter from her shoulder and flicks it in to the room.
He drops the tag, feeling the blood drain from his face as Castiel shivers again, all trace of fear either gone or hidden by the shivers from the cold. He doesn’t let the Familiar know what else was on the tag, swiftly removing it from the collar and pocketing it before any suspicions are raised. Castiel shivers again, drawing Dean out of his mild panic and back to the moment, noting how the rain seems to have eased off - at least for now. He ruffles the fur between Castiel’s ears before standing, knees popping again as he also nudges Castiel to stand. He cocks his head in confusion, Dean’s pointing to the sky only making him tilt his head further.
Sam’s eyes go wide as he notices the angel blade fall in to Dean’s hand, trying to catch his brother as he stalks towards the crackling fire. He’s stopped dead as Castiel steps in front of him, shaking his head.
"It's not that bad, y'know. Everyone does stupid things from time to time… Although, a dog being surprised by their own tail is a new one by me." Castiel whined, still wanting the floor to swallow him. Dean laughed again before setting down on the floor beside him, hand finding its way back in to his fur. They sat like that for a few minutes until Castiel moved his paws off his face, apology written over his features as best he could.
make me ask twice for you again." She pulled her arm back, blue flames lighting up her hand. "And don't you
“I’ll drink this, have breakfast - then you can go run off some of that tension you’re holding all of a sudden."
“I was merely marvelling at how nice the trees look now their leaves are growing back in… I was even contemplating a run, but I was waiting to see how long you’d be first.” Dean smiled, placing his mug behind him on the counter as he mirrored Castiel’s position, leaning back with his arms folded across his chest.
"Dupid dings... In the way..." He muttered to himself before yawning again. "But dey comfy... One hour..." A gentle snore filled the cubicle before Dean could think about telling himself not to sleep as Castiel shuffled papers noiselessly in the next room.
“That may very well be the biggest understatement I’ve ever heard, Dean.” Dean can’t keep the smile off his face, even as he rolls his eyes at the angel. “Shall we?” Castiel turns, gently pulling at Dean’s hand as the hunter nods, trying to remember the rhythm he’d built up to help propel them home.
“... Shut up.” The words fall on deaf ears as Sam climbs into the driver’s seat, the rumble of the Impala drowning out any other choice words Dean throws Sam’s way as he pulls away back onto the road. Dean watches as they disappear into the distance, ignoring the way his wings quiver as realisation begins to hit him the further away Sam gets that there really is no escaping learning how to fly now. He jumps as Castiel rests a hand on his shoulder, motioning to follow him as he wanders towards the treeline just ahead of them.
Dean takes a deep breath, leaning forward so his elbows are resting on his knees, hands supporting his chin.
“I’m trying to get you to open this wing so I can look at it properly, but you’re holding it that tightly against yourself… You’re not making it easy.” He presses on Dean’s shoulder blade again, focusing his attention closer to where the wing meets the hunter’s back as he slowly increases the pressure. The injured wing twitches before opening out; Dean’s cry turning into a growl as the sharp pain subdues enough to turn into a dull throbbing sensation.
“If you hadn't been here Cas, I'd probably be dead. Sam doesn't know where I am, there's no guarantees you would have got here on time... I'm damn glad you were here.” Now it was Castiel's turn to blush. “I'm always damn glad you're here. Now come on, back to bed.” Dean let go of Castiel's hand, giving him a firm slap on the behind with a shit eating grin on his face, and a wink, earning an eye roll from the angel.
"My apologies, Dean." He quickly moved his gaze to the wings that were still present on the hunter's back, frowning as he reached out to try and make contact with one. "You still have wings..." He pulled it just out of the angel's reach.
"Cas?" Big eyes looked back up at him, and then they closed, Dean having drifted off into sleep from being on the receiving end of grace. Castiel gently placed him on one of the motel beds, but Dean's now small hands had the trenchcoat in a vice-like grip, so Castiel lay down first, allowing Dean to curl up with a thumb in his mouth on his chest. He watched carefully as Dean slept with no need of his own to sleep, but did so anyway without noticing. If anyone were to come into their motel room, they would just think it was a father taking care of his infant son.
“The most I’ll be able to do is check how much damage has been done. Beyond that, nature has to take its course.” Dean groaned again; Castiel rolling his eyes at the hunter’s behaviour as he began his descent down the steps.
"Cas, wait. Could you, um... I got... Help?" Dean pointed to where the wings joined to his back, and Castiel looked confused.
“Dude.” Sam throws another bitch face at Dean, the older Winchester ignoring it as he points a finger in the younger’s direction.
“I love you.” The words are blurted out, Dean managing to look away from the box long enough to look Castiel in the eyes as he says them, the soft look he receives making his heart melt even more.
“Cas… You don’t have to be an Empath to see all that tension you’re holding in your shoulders. I mean, it
“I-” Dean swallows, trying to keep his own tears at bay. “Thank you, Cas. Seriously.” He gently deposits the tray on the floor before turning back to Castiel, leaning forward to grab his face in his hands before allowing the kiss to convey his emotions in a way his words can’t. They’re both breathless as Dean pulls away, resting their foreheads together, Castiel running his thumb along Dean’s cheekbone.
Dean looks guilty again, his spare hand finding its home on the back of his neck as he looks down at the Familiar on his leg.
Dean doesn’t say anything; both his hands winding their way into Castiel’s fur, grip tightening as he brings his head down to join them, resting it gently on top of Castiel’s. It takes him a few seconds to realise that Dean is
“Good.” He turned back to Castiel, hand finding its way on to his shoulder. Castiel smiled, placing his own hand on top of Dean’s, squeezing it gently again before dropping it back to his side.
“No-one is gonna lose him. Especially not us, okay? We're gonna go in that damn warehouse and drag his stupid ass out of there.” Castiel chuckled, knowing that Sam was unlikely to let Dean live down that he had been the damsel in distress.  Sam smiled, turning back to the Impala and opening the trunk, grabbing his gun and spare bullets before taking a deep breath in.
“Good, that’s a start. I can try and pinpoint exactly where it’s injured now… From there we can go about starting the healing process.” Castiel steps back, looking briefly over Dean’s wing to check for anything immediately obvious as that tells him where the pain is before cracking his knuckles.
“I- I… I thought I’d lost you. For good this time.” Dean doesn’t know when his forehead came to rest against Castiel’s, or when his other hand snaked beneath the trenchcoat to pull them closer together, but Castiel isn’t pulling away and Dean can’t find it in himself to either. It feels right after all this time, the way they fit together perfectly; now Dean truly understands what Castiel meant by happiness is just in the being.
Castiel woke the next morning with the feeling of something tickling his nostrils, a soft feeling that felt familiar but he couldn't place it. He also felt an absence, sitting up quickly and nearly flinging Dean off his chest, who wasn't actually sat on him at all. Castiel stared at him, eyes wide with shock at the sight he was seeing, and Dean didn't seem to notice.
“Sweetheart, I'm no angel.” She gestured with her free hand to the wings spread either side of Dean, before looking back at him.
“I suppose we should let them know we’re awake now, really. Unless you'd rather that peace offering go cold?” Dean kisses Castiel’s knuckles, soft smile still on his face as he looks down at the former angel. There’s a grumble as he moves into a sitting position, rolling his eyes as Dean just laughs at him again.
out of it, but the way Castiel solemnly nods lets Dean know that it should and will get discussed. He sighs as he stretches, keeping one hand on Castiel’s side as they exit the park, one eye firmly trained on the Familiar to make sure he doesn’t leave his side.
Something on Castiel's side of the connection made Dean's wings quiver again, a small amount of dread working creeping over.
“I dunno, Cas. I mean, yeah, it's a feather, but nothing about it screams Dean.” Castiel's shoulders slumped, for now admitting defeat in trying to get Sam to believe him, taking the feather back just as carefully as he handed it out. He wasn't about to lose the only thing they currently had that suddenly meant the world to him, that was proof he wasn't going completely mad. He sat on the bed, absent-mindedly twirling the feather between his fingers, not noticing Sam stand up.
Castiel nudged Dean’s face again, a weak laugh escaping as he tried to move away from the sudden barrage of affection.
“I'm sorry. It seems my concern for Dean seems to be clouding any of my other judgement... I don't want to think about what else could happen to him in his current condition, and I'm worried.” Sam offered a sympathetic smile and nodded.
“Having part of your true form pulled to this plane is not exactly what I'd call pleasant, but I should be fine.” He stood properly, stretching, wings extending to their fullest while Sam stared before they settled in to a relaxed position behind him. “This also might make getting to Dean slightly more difficult now.”
The air outside is crisp, the breeze playing havoc with leaves that have fallen from trees; Castiel can’t help but stare in wonder at the myriad of colours that is being offered to him. He doesn’t notice that Dean has ended up further ahead of him, the colours and new smells capturing all his attention. He’s seen outside before, through windows and briefly through open doors whenever Naomi had visitors to the house - but this is something else entirely to him. He also can’t help his instincts as his nose is all but dragged to the ground, barely paying attention to where he’s going as the environment threatens to overwhelm him. He barely registers that someone is shouting for him either, only as Dean drops back in to his field of vision does he realise his attention is wanted elsewhere.
“You any idea where abouts you want to go to run?” The words catch Castiel off guard, dropping the spatula in surprise.
“Yup!” Castiel shakes his head as he turns to the hunter, shaking out his wings to get the coating of green dust off them.
"It's my fault you're like this, Dean. I couldn't stop the witch, and when I tried to heal you, I did this instead. I'm sorry-" Dean's hand over Castiel's mouth stopped his rant, taking Castiel by suprise. He could feel Dean experimenting with the bit of grace that had passed over, trying to reassure Castiel as best he could, but the nerves of not knowing what to do passed over easier.
“Unless you’d rather vomit again?” Castiel gave him an inquisitive look as Dean pinched the bridge of his nose, taking in a deep breath.
"Dude… How did you do that?" Dean looked back and forth between the mortar and Castiel again. "You've… All… They… What?" Castiel shrugged as best he could, turning back towards the other room as Dean gaped wordlessly at the island. He moved to the rug that was in front of the fireplace, settling down as Dean worked his way out of his stupor, the soft grind of the pestle against the mortar lulling Castiel slowly in to a gentle sleep. The brief thought of
"If you insist." He went to turn away, but Dean stopped him, the bright shade of red covering his face again.
"Bad dog." Castiel tried to hide his trembling as Naomi sighed again. She stepped over the pieces, blocking any exit available before back-handing Castiel across the room. The cold, calm anger never left her face as he let out a small whimper, earning him another beating.
“Seriously Cas, don’t ever change.” Castiel’s head is still titled in confusion when the answer isn’t immediately given to him. “
Dean just nods in response, arm still covering his eyes as he brings his other hand to rest in Castiel’s fur.
“I... I love you, Cas. I guess nearly dying and sprouting wings helps a guy realise some stuff, y'know?” The blush had left Dean's face and crossed to Castiel's, who was now also staring at their hands.
“I'll stay here.” Castiel paused, taking a deep breath as he tried to calm himself down. “Just... Hurry. There are some things I need to tell you that are better off said in person.”
"Dean, can you hear me? Dean!" The Hunter was lay on his back, unmoving, and Castiel could only just feel the life force keeping him alive. It was times like this that he was thankful for the profound bond they shared, but it now scared him as he knew Dean was perilously close to death. He lifted Dean into his arms and flew them back to the motel room, the Impala parked where she had been before they set off, and Castiel set about trying to fix whatever damage the witch had done. He gingerly placed two fingers to Dean's forehead, trying to assess whatever damage had been done, but Castiel couldn't feel anything. He sighed, sitting back on the bed that Dean was lay on and watched, waiting for any sign of consciousness that was welcome to make an appearance any time now. He waited for a couple of minutes, looking for any changes in any part of Dean that would let him know he was near waking up, but nothing happened and he moved to one of the chairs in the motel room, letting his mind wander whilst keeping an eye on Dean.
"I apologise... My wings are not used to physical contact. The colour seems to put other angels off..."
“Trust me Bobby, I didn’t want it to go down that way either. I had plans - hell, I had an actual proper job lined up for when that hunt was over… I finally had my out.” He sighed as he took another long drink from the bottle, purposely ignoring the way Bobby was looking at him. “Least it seems better here than the last time I saw it. No more individual Heavens?” Bobby took his own drink before lowering the bottle, watching a water droplet run down the side before turning back to Dean.
Castiel pressed his forehead back against Dean’s before standing, shaking off loose fur and errant petals from the delicate blooms they had created.
“Great! Well, not great ‘cause you’ve not eaten, but… I’ll whip you up some burgers, yeah? Everyone loves burgers.” He pulls his head back before Castiel can say anything else, the smell of garlic and onion slowly beginning to fill the living space. His stomach rumbles again, involuntarily licking his lips as the smell of the patties joins the orchestra of other smells, and Castiel is fairly certain that this is what heaven smells like. He drifts to the doorway of the kitchen, watching as Dean gracefully flips the burgers in the pan, not watching where the patties go before catching them expertly again.
“Well… Shit.” Weariness washed over him, arms staying stubbornly at his sides as he fell forwards to the floor, consciousness slipping away from him before he knew if he’d hit it or not.
It was dark when Dean came to, the warm caress of Castiel's hand in his wing long since stopped. The display on the crappy bedside radio read a little after 3AM, the neon of the vacancy sign creeping through the small gap in the curtains and illuminating the sleeping form of Castiel next to him. Dean smiled, wings puffing up slightly as he gently ran a hand down the side of the sleeping angel's face. He stirred slightly, leaning more in to the touch as Dean smiled more.
“I’m sorry. It’s just still kind of hard to deal with sometimes, and I’m not used to having someone else around when I go there.”
“I don’t think there’s much further to go now, if that makes you feel better? We’ll probably still be back before Sam.”
“If these witches are powerful enough to cast a spell that can pull my wings here, what else are they capable of? We need to be more careful with how we go from here.” A pit was forming in Castiel's stomach, the urgency to find Dean growing. He wanted to be away from this place, somewhere safe, somewhere no-one could lay their hands on either of them again. He squared his shoulders, wings rising slightly as he made his decision.
“How?” Dean whips his head around from the Impala, wings flaring in mild irritation. He pales as he sees the grin that Sam is struggling to keep off his face, looking towards Castiel for support but met only with a shrug.
Dean snorts, turning away from Castiel to cover his mouth as the giggle develops in to a full blown laugh. Castiel can only tilt his head in confusion, trying to catch Dean’s attention as tears stream down his face for a different reason.
“I don’t know if it’s your blood sugar or what the hell just happened with you, but I definitely think you need this. Other than the fact you haven’t eaten for days.” Castiel felt Dean sit beside him rather than saw it, his hand coming to rest on his fur again as a whine escaped.
“... Yeah. Okay...” He brings his hand to his face, lightly touching the spot where Castiel kissed him as though the action could remove it, smiling softly as he lets a warm feeling wash over him. “Okay.”
… Don’t make it any easier.” Castiel knelt down again, pressing two fingers to Dean’s forehead. Their eyes briefly flashed with grace as a low groan escaped Dean, blinking a couple of times to re-adjust to the light.
“... Dammit.” Dean shook his head, letting it work into a full body shiver before opening his eyes to look at Castiel. “Okay. I guess it’s now or never.” Castiel nodded, opening his wings out and giving Dean a brief smile before turning his attention to the sky. Dean couldn’t help but stare at the way the sun reflected blue and green hues from the black depths of Castiel’s wings, any fear he still had about flying melting away as he watched them easily lift the angel and himself off the ground. His own wings twitched as they felt air passing through his feathers; one experimental flap was shortly followed by another, helping Castiel get higher until he felt they were high enough for the time being.
“Yeah. Why wouldn’t I?” Dean shrugs as he says it, walking past Sam and towards the driver’s side of the Impala, stopping just before he can open the door. “Ah, shit.” Sam sniggers as he realises why Dean stopped, ignoring the glare being thrown his way.
Dean didn't need to be told twice once the idea for less clothes left Castiel's mouth. He licked his lips hungrily as the tie was quickly taken off and thrown elsewhere in the room, eyes raking down the shirt as Dean wrestled with the idea of slowly opening each button or ripping the offending piece of fabric off the angel above him. Castiel took the choice away from him, opting to lift it above his head and throw it vaguely in the direction of where the tie had landed. Dean couldn't stop his hands ghosting over Castiel's sides, drinking in the sight above him, dragging a thumb slowly over an exposed nipple and causing Castiel to moan. A grin worked its way across Dean's face as he did it again, and again, before switching it to the other nipple to see if the reaction was the same. Castiel had dropped his forehead to Dean's, eyes closed and revelling in the sensation.
“That one. Although, something about it feels...” He tilted his head the other direction. “Different.”
"I'm not going to hurt you, I promise. That-" Dean pointed towards the broken mug. "That was an accident. It's my fault for leaving it so close to the edge of the counter. I'm not gonna hurt you cause it broke." Castiel hesitantly opened his eyes, following Dean's arm to the mug. He whimpered again, looking away from it and briefly up in to forgiving green eyes.
to stretch and be free - knowing he could disappear and stretch before returning at the exact moment he’d left was something he looked back on fondly. When Dean had got to a point where he could hide his wings, that would be something he’d have to share with the hunter; something else they could do together.
The scream grabbed Castiel’s attention first, head whipping around in the direction it had come from just in time to see the light die down. Sam looked up just after, slowly removing his hands from his ears and straightening up as Castiel began to march towards the source. It was peppered with jogs, turning in to a full on sprint as they rounded the corner to the corridor the scream had come from. Sam slid to a halt as Castiel threw open door after door, cautiously following as one in particular caught his attention. He motioned for the angel to step aside, moving forward with his gun trained ahead as he slowly opened the door. The burnt-out corpse of a woman made it slightly more difficult to open, with just about enough room for Sam to step in before closing the door again behind him.
“My... Your... What?” The hunter began to pace, hands in his hair and wings ruffled in a slightly panicked position. “How? How can I have grace?” He stopped pacing and turned to Castiel, the same panic that his wings showed mirrored in his eyes. He sank in to the nearest chair, head in hands before looking back up at the angel.
"No. I want this explaining before you use your mojo on me." Dean paused, then looked down at himself. "I think clothes first would probably be a good idea though." Castiel blinked, and in that time Dean had dressed his bottom half, opting to leave his top half exposed due to the wings that stubbornly remained.
manage that, correct?" Castiel nodded eagerly as he moved to shift back, stopping when Naomi's hand gripped his jaw. "Don't disappoint me again, dog." She pulled her hand away roughly, again looking in disgust at the broken mug before leaving Castiel alone with a slam of the door. He let out the breath he didn’t realise he had been holding as he sank back to the floor trembling. Shifting back now required far too much emotional energy that had been sapped from him, he just hoped he could gain enough to meet what had been demanded of him in time. His head hurt from where he had been struck, and his leg hurt from the way he had landed, which was going to make shifting even more difficult. He sighed, resigning himself to the fact that things needed to be done before taking a deep breath in, mustering whatever energy he had left to make the transition back from dog to man. The shift was painful, but Castiel had expected that. He hadn't anticipated gasping for breath though, falling back to the floor, putting his hand squarely in the ceramic shards that had earned him further beating. He hissed as he gently pulled a smaller piece out of his palm, debating just turning the mug to dust for the problems it had caused him. Instead he sighed in resignation, waving his good hand over it and repairing it. It may only have been a mug, but if it wasn't replaced or repaired then Naomi would notice, and Castiel had had enough beatings for one day.
“Hmm.” It’s then that the door creaks open; Jack moving slowly with his tongue stuck out in concentration, eyes not moving from the tray he holds to make sure nothing gets spilt. Sam holds the door open behind him, one hand splayed on the wood with a smile on his face as Eileen nurses her own cup of coffee behind the pair of them. Dean sits up straighter, moving to take the tray from Jack’s hands, frowning slightly as the nephilim shakes his head.
“Great…” Dean shoves his hands in his pockets with more force than necessary, sighing as he kicks dirt off the path. “Oh, Sam’s gonna absolutely
“Surely having something positive to celebrate on that date would be better than a reminder of Hell?”
A slow, measured breath escapes Dean as he releases the white knuckled grip on Castiel’s fur again, standing as he moves towards the door. He absentmindedly adjusts warding before turning back to the sofa, curiosity and frustration mixed on his face in equal parts.
“Hungry?” The gurgle from Castiel’s stomach answers for him, making Dean laugh again. “Guess so. How long is it since you ate last anyway? Must be what - 2 or 3 days by now?”
“Which part would that be?” Dean hesitated for a second before finding the courage to get the words out.
“That’s fair. Somewhere open you can really stretch your legs… I think I know just the place.” The warmth washes over him again, just catching the blush that creeps across the top of Dean’s ears. “It’ll be nice to see, y’know? It’s always nice to see you actually
“No, I’m coming. I’d prefer to have it done before Sam gets back so he can’t laugh at me getting it done, to be honest.”
“I need you to try and relax your wings as much as you can for me... I don’t want to injure you by accident.” A slow breath out was Castiel’s only response as he watched tension ease out of Dean’s body, wings going lax behind the hunter. “Good. Are you ready?”
“Is there something you wanted, Dean?” The innocence in his voice was layered on thickly, and it made Dean almost orgasm where he lay. He scrabbled in to a sitting position, kissing Castiel as though his life depended on it, straddling the angel in the middle of the bed, trying to touch of him as he possibly could. Hands worked their way through hair, over nipples, through feathers until Dean's hands finally stopped on Castiel's hips, foreheads resting against each other as he tried to catch his breath. Castiel dragged his fingertips up Dean's back, catching the gland at the base of his wing that caused him to buck his hips and grind together, breathy moans escaping the hunter.
“Thanks Cas.” Dean smiles back, hand out again for the next item. “I am still not used to how much easier this is now.”
“And the feathers?” Castiel hesitated, getting a closer look at the one Sam had brought before snatching it out of his hand.
“Make me, jerk.” Castiel catches the way Dean’s jaw clenches, the feel and smell of ozone hitting his nostrils just as his eyes get the slightest glimmer of grace in them.
“Cas… Are you-” A bright light burst from the book before either Dean or Castiel could let go, Dean managing to shield his eyes from the light before falling back to the floor; silence from Castiel briefly making his heart leap to his throat. He blinked rapidly as the light died down, trying to get rid of the spots in his eyes as he groaned, lifting a hand to his head.
“So you'd have no problem with me keeping them?” Castiel shook his head, unlinking their hands so he could straighten out a couple of feathers that had moved out of place. Dean moaned at the contact, his chin dropping to his chest, eyes fluttering shut as Castiel raised an eyebrow at him.
The blush settles at the top of Dean’s ears again at the compliment, Castiel huffing in amusement at how easy it is to fluster him.
Even in his head, Castiel’s voice is small. His heart picks up pace again as he realises he has no way of knowing if Dean is alive, much less whether he’s okay or not. There’s no movement from his chest, no movement in his fur as Castiel presses his face in to Dean’s to try and feel for breath. He whines, pawing at the Empath’s chest in an attempt to get any sort of reaction from him, whining again when nothing happens.
“Witch killing bullets…” The words come out barely above a whisper, realisation on what needs to be done dawning on him. “Dean… We need to create a distraction for Sam.”
“May I test something?” Dean looked up from his hands long enough to notice a small blush across Castiel’s cheeks, hands wringing together in nervousness.
” He shook his head again, closing his eyes as the stranger groaned in defeat. “Dammit. Worth a shot.” They stood up again, clapping as they did so, Castiel letting out an involuntary yelp at the noise and growling at the pain it caused. At least they had the decency to look guilty, bending down to try and calm Castiel down.
“Hmm.” Sam sighed, the response doing nothing to calm his worry. Instead, he turned back to the road, keeping an eye out for the warehouse Castiel had described. Castiel shifted his gaze from the road ahead of them to the buildings that were beginning to line the street, himself keeping an eye for the offending warehouse, hairs standing up on the back of his neck. He shifted where he was sat, the fidget briefly pulling Sam's attention from the road.
“I think so. I think I know where the magic from the book went too… You’ve got it, Dean.” Dean’s brow furrowed in thought before turning back to Castiel.
"I love you too, Dean." He smiled, then squirmed again, and Castiel knew he wanted to be put down. He tottered away, the small wings allowing him to do so without falling over until he sat down, finding something interesting in the weave of the motel carpet. Castiel watched the whole thing until he knew Dean would not want to be disturbed, and turned to the books that littered the table. He had to find a way to fix what the witch had done, and the memory of that particular hunt was one he wished he could forget...
“I get it. You've got your more profound bond or whatever, but he's my brother and I'm just as worried. But we've got to think about this logically Cas, or God-knows what could happen to him.” Castiel looked at his feet, guilt creeping up on him at the thought of putting Dean in any more peril from not thinking clearly. He reached in to his coat, pulling Dean's feather from its pocket, straightening it before sighing again.
to teach me that next.” He shuddered again as he stretched his own wings out, flapping them gently before bringing them to rest.
"CAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAASSSSSS!" The ear piercing wail broke through the silence as cleanly as a knife through butter, and Castiel flinched as it reached his ears. "CAAAAAAAASS!" He sighed, the noise bringing himself out of his thoughts and he stood up, stretching before he met the source of the wail. Turning, Castiel saw the small fledgling trying its hardest to get out of the playpen that he had made appear to accommodate it, annoyance plastered all over its face.
“Cas- I…” He wiped away the worst of the tears, blinking and taking a deep breath before looking down at Castiel, his other hand coming to rest on top of the Familiar’s head, voice quiet. “... Thank you.” Castiel nudged his muzzle in to Dean’s hand, gently licking his palm that earned a small laugh from the Empath. Dean wiped at his eyes again, sniffling as he ruffled the fur on top of Castiel’s head before turning his attention back to the warding herbs. The pestle isn’t in Dean’s hand long before his head whips around to the door, not noticing as it slips from his fingers and rolls to the floor with a clatter, dropping to Castiel’s level with a panicked look on his face.
“Found it. I'm not sure what it is, but I think they're using them when they're killing angels. It was in a room where one had been killed, with more of these feathers.”
Dean’s grip on his own hands loosened, yet they remained together as he slowly lifted his gaze to meet Castiel’s.
He nudges the door off the Empath as best he can, growling at the surprising weight of it. The growling only intensifies as the door finally gives way enough for Castiel to see Dean’s face, a small gash on his forehead yet the Empath’s eyes remain stubbornly closed.
"Sam went on a different hunt... Do you remember? You were hunting a witch and required my assistance, Dean." Dean looked up from his position in Cas' arms, the small wings on his back no longer trying to wrap themselves around him. Castiel could almost see Dean's bottom lip start to tremble, and he knew that if something wasn't done quickly then the power behind the wail would hurt. He looked down as Dean looked up again, tears almost brimming over and Castiel did the only thing he could think of at that moment. He placed a reassuring hand on the chocolate, toffee and white coloured wings and pulled Dean in as close as he could without hurting him. Dean giggled, squirming and flapping the wings as best he could whilst Castiel held him, and Castiel could feel himself smiling. He let his grip slacken and Dean looked up at him again, his own smile on his face. It was only just seen before Dean buried his face into the trenchcoat again, and Castiel could feel the grace passing between the two of them.
“Everything okay…?” Dean waved off Sam’s question, his own head tilting to match Castiel’s. Both sets of wings quivered as the lights above them flickered, Sam looking up again to the rafters to see if there was anything clearly obvious there to explain the flickering.
Castiel sat up, looking anywhere but back to Dean’s face, intently watching the way a leaf slowly drifted to the ground in a vain attempt to keep the nerves he was suddenly feeling at bay.
The air in the Impala was tense, Castiel staring dead ahead at the road whilst Sam drove. Cautious glances were thrown at the angel, a frown having settled on Sam's face at Castiel's behaviour. Dean had been in plenty of trouble before, and it was highly likely he would again, but there was something about this time that was different to Castiel, and Sam couldn't quite put his finger on it. It was mildly worrying to see the angel with such a laser focus, it had been a long time since Sam had seen him like that. He glanced over again, Castiel still firmly looking ahead.
“Hey, you o-” Castiel held his hand up to get Sam to be quiet, the words abruptly cutting off. He tilted his head as he tried to focus on the whispering that had started up, trying to pinpoint exactly where it was coming from, to try and hear it more clearly.
His mouth snapped shut with an audible click as he looked away from Castiel, staring dead ahead as the anger engulfed the sympathetic look that had been on his face. He glanced down as Castiel whimpered again, a small noise that if it hadn’t been for being an Empath he would have missed. He clenched his fist, knuckles almost going white before taking a deep breath and releasing it, sighing as his Baby came into view.
The word seemed to go over his head, the invisible spot taking all his attention. Castiel huffed, moving towards Dean and nudging his chin up with his muzzle.
? Like, actual physical... Wings?” Castiel nodded, pacing back and forth in front of the bed the younger Winchester wasn't sat on.
“Look, I get that he's missing and I accept that witches were involved – but wings? That's a stretch, even for us.” The rage hadn't left Castiel's eyes, his features schooled in to a more neutral expression as he carefully picked Dean's feather off the bed. He turned it over a few times in his hands, the feeling of electricity helping him still feel connected to Dean even though neither him or the younger Winchester knew where he was.
“No, it- it’s fine. I shouldn’t have brought it up.” He stopped wringing his hands, keeping them tightly clasped together as his shoulders slumped forwards. It made him seem smaller, hunched over on the floor whilst avoiding looking at Castiel at all.
“You’re not bad to be around yourself, y’know.” Dean pressed his face in to Castiel’s fur, breathing deeply as he let himself calm down again, Castiel shifting position so they could both be comfortable. There was something about Dean that was soothing, something about him that allowed Castiel to relax and not have any worries; a feeling he had long since forgotten living with Naomi. He couldn’t quite place why he felt that way, but he wasn’t going to let anything take it away from him now. Dean sighing drew Castiel out of his thoughts, looking up at the empath as he shifted positions again.
“Thank you, Dean.” He smiles again as he glances back towards the wall, linking his fingers with the hunter’s. “We should probably tell the others.”
“Have I got crap on my face or something? Why you looking at me like that?” Confusion briefly flashed over Dean’s features, wiping a hand down his face as Castiel looked around quickly to make sure no one was looking, shifting before moving closer to Dean to hold his head between his hands. He placed a gentle kiss to his lips before pulling ever so slightly away; smiling at the way Dean moved to chase after another as Castiel brushed his thumb over the Empath’s cheek.
Dean groaned again, trying to push at Castiel to move him from lying on him, groaning again as he stubbornly refused to let himself be moved.
, but still…” Dean shrugged, draining his mug again before putting it on the counter with a content sigh. “C’mon. Breakfast. Then you can go run like a weirdo.” Dean smiled again, moving towards the stove as Castiel stayed frozen in place. He wasn’t often without words, but the way Dean was teasing him about the
“Dean, I -” Dean kissed Castiel, cutting off whatever he was about to say before resting their foreheads together, breathing getting more erratic to match the movements of their wings.
“It’s perfect, Cas. Couldn’t be any more you if it tried.” Castiel takes a step back as he admires his handiwork; smile getting brighter as Dean sidles next to him, slipping an arm around his waist to pull him closer. He places a gentle kiss on the former angel’s temple before looking again at the calendar, spare hand working its way into his pocket as he lets the pure domesticity of the situation wash over him.
“You're my family Dean, it isn't a problem.” Dean's wings rose with the compliment, and began absent-mindedly stroking the inside of Castiel's wrist with his thumb.
“You're more than family Cas. You're like a brother to me, to Sam.” Castiel's wings puffed up at the praise, sparking something within the hunter. “Hell, you're more than a brother, Cas. You're important to me.” Some time during the conversation Dean had stood up from the chair, removing any personal space that was between the two of them. Dean's hand still circled Castiel's wrist as his wings opened as far as they could within the confines of the motel room, closely followed by Castiel's. Both sets of wings were tantalisingly close to touching, less than a hair's breadth apart, small sparks of electricity passing between them creating an even more electric atmosphere than Dean had already created. Castiel's free hand came up to cup Dean's face, who leaned in to the touch, eyes never leaving the angel's.
"Aren't they awesome, Cas? Now I jus' like you!" Dean let himself fall onto Castiel, knocking the wind out of him, but Dean just hugged the angel as hard as he could. Castiel didn't know how to respond, sat staring at Dean in what could only be described as wide eyed disbelief. He didn't even realise Dean had started poking him to get his attention.
Dean’s hand began to card through his fur, the touch bringing Castiel’s heart rate down as he let his head drift to the floor.
“Just in case. And I’d rather be down here if you need anything.” The stranger began to stroke him, getting lost in the movements, lulling Castiel closer to sleep. “I know it’s not much, but I figured the company is better than nothing.” He let out a soft sigh, moving to get more comfortable against the stranger. The closeness still felt foreign to him, yet there was something about the man that didn’t set any alarm bells off in Castiel’s head, that allowed Castiel to start to trust him, even though he didn’t even know the man’s name. Nothing he had done was leading him to believe that he had any ill intentions other than to make sure he made a full recovery - beyond that was a mystery that Castiel was willing to leave until they got to it.
“Shitty parenting makes you doubt yourself sometimes. I’m still un-learning some stuff, but I’m better than I was.” Castiel jumps as Dean claps, rubbing his hands together before shoving them in to his pockets. “But enough of that. We’re here to see how you’re doing with your ankle, so that’s what we’re gonna do. I want to see you running, maybe if you change direction kinda quickly - if you feel comfortable doing that - so I can see how it fares doing something else.” Castiel nods, leaving Dean in the shade of the tree as he starts a loop of the park, letting himself get lost as he follows his feet. He relishes the feeling of the wind in his fur, the rhythmic sound of his feet hitting dirt, the dizzying feeling he gets as he makes abrupt turns. It’s the most free he has ever felt, running for pleasure rather than escape, not having to worry about how much distance he’s putting between himself and-
“We’ll just see about that, won’t we?” The cold feeling almost makes Dean shudder again as she gets closer, pulling on the collar with more force than necessary so the tag faces her. She doesn’t try to hide the sneer this time as the tag catches the light, the name
much energy to burn off. Fuck.” Castiel laughs again as he adjusts his position, resting his head on Dean’s chest to keep an ear on just how fast his heart is beating after the impromptu sprint.
“The poultice! It’s kind of sensitive, if I leave it too long it’ll-” There was a small pop from the island, followed by a plume of black smoke that slowly began to drift towards the floor. “Um… It’ll do that. Shit.” Castiel huffed in amusement, the worry of punishment now long gone from his mind. He looked back up as Dean ran his hands through his hair, the smoke continuing to pour on to the floor, staring at the mortar as he tried to figure out how to get it to stop. He barked, surprising both himself and Dean as the smoke stopped, creeping back up the side of the island as he growled at it. He continued to growl until they both heard a familiar pop, Dean peering in to the mortar and back at Castiel in wonder.
“Is that okay, Cas?” He hummed in contentment, cut off by a sharp intake of breath as Dean pinched both of them at the same time, causing his wings to flare out. Castiel's eyes opened, and Dean could feel himself getting lost in the depth of them, hands absent-mindedly rubbing the wing joints on Castiel's back. He was that lost in Castiel's eyes that he didn't notice the smirk slowly spreading across the angel's face as moved his own hands to tease at Dean's nipples, eyes closing in pleasure, grip on wing joints lost. A small moan escaped him as contact was lost, but replaced with a louder one as Castiel took the bud in to his mouth and gave it a small suck, testing the waters. Satisfied at his reaction, he ran his tongue slowly across it, Dean's hand gripping his hair as more moans escaped him.
“Who would have thought it'd take me growing wings to realise how much you actually mean to me, Cas?”
“No... No, no no no...” The panic crept in to his voice, wings still trying to move away from the blade. The witch placed one finger over Dean's lips, cold and clammy like the last witch had been.
as far as everyone's concerned." Dean huffed, looking back at Castiel. "Well, I guess if I can talk to you now, you can finally tell me what you are?" He put his head in his hands, jokingly fluttering his eyelashes as innocently as he could. Castiel snorted, looking away from the ridiculousness of it.
The night passed as the others had done, slowly and with little progress made on Castiel's part. The still human part of Dean allowed him to sleep without interrupting, and Castiel was at least thankful for that. A fully angelic Dean was something he didn't want to deal with, as they didn't sleep and the research probably would have come to a halt. Castiel had found himself also sleeping, hours upon hours of fruitless research taking their toll on his vessel even though the angel within was unaffected.
Dean nodded, the grip on his pestle turning his knuckles white as he ground herbs violently in to the mortar. Castiel tilted his head in confusion again, unsure what he’d said to get Dean so angry. He crept forward, nudging his muzzle in to Dean’s leg, looking up to see if his efforts were working. He tried again, this time with more pressure, flinching when Dean snapped around.
“You know, when you said you’d be here the whole time, kinda figured it would include this bit too!” Castiel sighs before cupping his hands around his mouth again.
“Sure.” Castiel took a deep breath, cracking his knuckles before gently placing his hand over the brand.
“Good boy.” With that, the black spots on the edge of his vision overwhelmed him, dragging him back to the realm of unconscious.
“You seem distracted.” Dean doesn’t notice that they’ve stopped straight away, only as Castiel straightens himself up does he notice that neither of them are moving. “Are you alright?”
“You wouldn’t be alone, I’d be with you. And until you can put your wings away, any public transport is out of the question.” Dean sighed, defeated.
"There's nothing wrong with them Cas. They're... They're amazing, actually." Castiel squinted when they opened out more in response to the complement, and Dean laughed. "Seems they know it more than you do." Dean felt his own open, turning quickly to see what the hell they were doing, catching Castiel's open wing with his and feeling a jolt like electricity pass between them. He jumped away, confusion covering his face as Castiel went almost as red as Dean had earlier.
.” Castiel rolls his eyes at the words, pressing gently on Dean’s shoulder blade again before slowly releasing the pressure, ignoring the hiss of pain that comes from the hunter as he does so. “What the hell are you even
"Why are you apologising? You're allowed to be happy." He huffed, head back on his paws. "What? You are!" Castiel rolled his eyes again, closing them in contentment as Dean continued to run his hand through his fur. He shook his head in disbelief, laughing to himself at Castiel’s antics.
"They should not be... This colour... They were damaged rescuing you from Hell, now other angels scorn them for what they went through." Dean absentmindedly ran his hand over the feathers he could reach, trying to manipulate the grace he had to let Castiel know what he thought of them.
Castiel couldn’t help the teasing tone creep over the bond, trying to make Dean feel at ease as much as possible, moving again so he was lying on the Empath’s chest.
going to lose you again. And…” The words are on the tip of his tongue, waiting to spill over yet all Dean can do is pull Castiel impossibly closer. “Dammit, I’m such an idiot. You spent, what…? 11, 12 years thinking you could never have me? You’ve always had me, Cas - I was just too much of a dumbass to realise straight away. You told me you loved me, and then- And then you
“Because now I have a link with Dean, and I can follow it directly to where he's being kept. He's going to try and buy us more time if he it comes to it, but I don't want him to injure himself unnecessarily if I can help it.” Sam steeled himself, lifting his gun again.
“Well, I ain’t known for my charm.” Dean laughed again as he shook his head, downing the rest of his beer with a sigh. “You want another?”
"I dunno. You tried to fix me, an' I fell asleep, an' I waked up like you... You maked be better, Cas!" Castiel ran over these events in his head, remembering his grace brushing against something within Dean and the feeling of electricity that accompanied it. Then it hit him - the something had to have been whatever the witch left behind to affect Dean, and an invasion of grace had altered the spell so rather than just de-aging the hunter, it had turned him into a fledgling. Castiel hit himself in the forehead in realisation, making Dean jump again and giving him more lift that he had before.
“Once or twice.” Dean turns to Castiel, a genuine smile on his face and shrugs. “They’re easy to do and always go down a treat whenever I actually make them.” He turns away again, pulling buns from a cupboard that had been left open and dropping them on the side. Castiel just watches as Dean potters about his kitchen, keeping a close eye on the burgers to make sure they don’t burn as he prepares the rest of the meal.
gonna take?” There was almost a look of pleading on Dean’s face as he met Castiel’s gaze properly, colour still not coming back as Castiel returned the look with sympathy. “I… I don’t know if I can do this, Cas. I…”
At some point during the evening, Castiel had stopped kissing Dean long enough to sit on the bed, a small, happy smile just noticeable on his face as Dean sat beside him, his head leant on the angel's shoulder. Dean had looped his arm through Castiel's and linked their fingers together, absent-mindedly tracing patterns into his skin with his thumb, letting himself become immersed in the happiness he was feeling. Their thighs were pressed together, and Castiel had draped one of his wings around the hunter, almost cocooning them from the outside world.
“... Where did you find it?” Castiel turned, pointing in the direction of the sofa before turning back. “Cas…
“It’s more what we’ve done. Look.” Castiel gestures broadly around them, still trying to stifle the laugh trying to work its way from his throat. Dean’s eyes go wide as he sits up slightly, nearly throwing Castiel from where he’s sat as realisation makes him sit up fully.
"My grace changed the spell that the witch cast on you, changed you into a fledgling rather than just a child. I do not know why, now the spell has reversed, the reason for you still having wings." Dean huffed, his wings moving with his back and Castiel followed their movement intently.
Dean’s tears spilt over then, looking towards the ceiling so any errant ones didn’t drip in to the warding herbs that had been abandoned. Castiel sat, allowing Dean the time to process what had been said, keeping close to provide comfort if it was wanted.
“Woah! Slow down a bit!” The wind whips the words away, the steady footfall Castiel can hear turning to a run as Dean picks up the pace to keep up with him. He barks again, stopping just shy of what may be the biggest tree he’s ever seen in his life, craning his neck to try and see the top. Panting brings his attention back to Earth, turning to see Dean leaning against a smaller tree with his other hand pressed firmly against his chest.
“I’m gonna make that poultice. And it’s gonna stink, but I think it needs to be done, ‘cause your ankle is a lot more damaged than I thought if you still can’t put weight on it properly.” Dean paused, looking down at Castiel before sighing. “How the hell did you even end up this bad?”
“Just grace. It's just... Grace. My grace...” Dean ran a hand through his hair. “Oh, that feels weird to say.” A knock on the door startled him to his senses, spinning round on the spot to face it.
“... What?” Castiel nods towards Sam, towards his gun, trying to make Dean understand without letting the witches know what’s going on. His eyes widen as he remembers what Sam told him about the bullets, nodding as he squares his shoulders in preparation for whatever Castiel is about to do to cause a distraction. He grabs the angel’s hand, giving it a reassuring squeeze before dropping it back to his side, grip on his blade tightening again.
“I don’t care - I meant every word of it.” Dean’s blush somehow gets darker, eyes briefly opening as he gives Castiel a soft smile. He leans more in to the touch, Castiel’s thumb ghosting over the nearest cluster of freckles before inching closer to the Empath.
“Then yes.” Sam snickered behind them, looking up towards the sky as he turned his back to try and hide it as much as possible. Dean flipped his middle finger at him before focusing his attention back on Castiel, shoulders sagging.
“Oh?” Dean took another swig, giving Bobby a confused look as the older hunter just raised his eyebrows.
“No, I- I got it.” It slips easily over Dean’s head, settling squarely above his heart. He’s sure he hears Castiel’s breath hitch in his throat as it settles, eyes watering slightly at the way it looks perfect around the hunter’s neck.
He was lucky to have the counter behind him, propping him up as his thoughts swirled around his head at a dizzying speed. There was no way Dean wouldn’t have been able to feel that, quickly glancing towards him as he placed a frying pan on the stove, seemingly ignorant to Castiel’s internal dilemma. Castiel let out a slow breath, trying to calm himself down as the first sizzle of bacon broke through his thoughts, giving him something else to focus on for the time being. Whatever those thoughts were could be shelved for later; Dean’s priority of breakfast quickly rising to the top of his list too as his stomach rumbled at the enticing smell of food.
“So we’re definitely going outside to get strength back in your ankle then. Now you’re away from her… You get to experience life on
“I get it. But you have got to stop feeling guilty about acting on instinct - that shit isn’t healthy.” Castiel blinks again, licking his lips as he tries his hardest not to look anywhere but Dean. “It’s there for a reason, and feeling guilty about it is only gonna confuse you when you need to listen to it the most.”
“Seriously, you gotta try to keep up with me, Cas. Don’t want you getting lost or something.” Castiel looks at the floor rather than the Empath’s face, embarrassment rolling off him at how easily he let himself get distracted. Dean lifts his head up, scratching behind Castiel’s ear as he lowers his voice.
"Dunno..." Dean mumbled his response, turning away from Castiel but was stopped. Now Dean looked alarmed, fear in his eyes as he desperately tried to figure out what he'd done wrong. Castiel noticed, stopping looking at Dean's back long enough to recognise the look of fear etched onto the young boy's face and before Dean knew what was going on, Castiel had pulled him into a tight hug. Dean squirmed, trying to get away from Castiel but failed rather miserably.
"How do we get rid of them?" Castiel didn't hear Dean's question, squinting at the wings instead, trying to figure out why they had remained. He was staring that intently that he didn't see the other move, the tip of it clipping him across the back of the head and quickly drawing him out of his reverie.
“Dean… Are you alright?” Castiel’s voice is soft as it breaks through Dean’s staring, brows furrowed as a small amount of worry joins it.
“Thank you. This is much appreciated.” Castiel’s eyes close as the first sip crosses his lips, savouring the caffeine with a content hum before taking another sip. Dean looks back at the tray, the smell of bacon having woken him up properly as he eyes up which pancake to go for first.
The trembling continues as she pushes a hand out towards Castiel’s throat, eyes betraying how deeply the anger she feels is underneath the controlled trembling. He lets the feeling wash over him as his voice settles back in place, clearing his throat a few times just for good measure.
“Sure, why not?” Dean shrugged as Bobby handed him another bottle, watching a droplet run down the neck as he held it idly between his fingers. “Not like I got to be anywhere in a hurry, and I wanna know if you can get drunk up here.”
He blinks as Dean’s hand rests in his fur, deep breaths becoming shallower as his heart rate begins to come down. A breathless laugh escapes as Dean ruffles the fur on Castiel’s head again, opening his eyes but keeping his head rested against the tree trunk.
“Whilst that’s not a bad idea, it doesn’t help us now.” Castiel turns again to open the closest cupboard to him; closing it with a sigh as there’s no sight of bandages within. “It needs doing as soon as possible so it doesn’t heal wrong… Just the same as if you’d broken your arm, or your leg.”
“I’m sure Dean. Although we may need to move with more caution now the element of surprise has been taken away from us, this is still going to work.” A glimmer of grace works its way in to Castiel’s eyes as his anger flares, wings rising in unison. “Not one witch in this building is going to survive the night.” Dean nods, his hands itching at his sides. He can feel the grace pulsing through his veins, giving him the extra edge needed to take on these bitches, and he wholeheartedly agrees that not a single one of them will see the sun rise again. He squares his shoulders again, Castiel following his actions as he stalks forwards, Sam’s footsteps a reassuring noise as he brings up the rear.
Another small patch of flowers sprang up as a dark blush crossed Dean’s cheeks; another amused huff working its way from Castiel as he watched the way they opened themselves up for the sun, almost twinkling in the way the light reflected off them.
“Why would you want to stay here? I’m not a witch, I’m nothing special. Just a guy who hit you with his car.”
Dean nodded again, as though he was mentally taking notes of everything Castiel was saying, as though he was committing them to memory. The concentration on his face as he thought of more questions made Castiel laugh to himself again as Dean slowly moved away from the sofa.
“It’s not that bad, surely?” Castiel nudges Dean’s side as he passes him another herb, expertly tossing it in to the pan waiting to boil.
“Yes, I waited for you. It looks very strange when it seems like there’s a dog running around without an owner there to keep an eye on them.”
“... Thanks.” He shook his head again as the door creaked open, settling in as the rumble of the Impala calmed any sudden nervousness he was feeling. “Okay Baby… Let’s go, shall we?” Dean gave Bobby a small wave as he pulled away, letting instinct take over with no set destination in mind. The open road called him, pulling him away from the Roadhouse and towards whatever lay in store for him.
“That… Hmmm.” Dean takes shallow breaths to try and get his heart rate back within acceptable levels before lifting his head off the table, turning to face Castiel with an eyebrow raised.
“You said your grace did something to the spell? Is there any way that grace is still there?” A hopeful look had settled on the hunter's features, the small glimmer had worked its way back into his eyes and his wings perked up.
The next door they come across gives them pause, Castiel squinting at the glowing symbols on the door, tilting his head again as he lets the words sink in. Dean follows suit again, tilting his head both ways as he struggles to make out what it says.
“What?” Dean turned back, a surprised look on his face and hands cupped. Blue flames danced across his palms, identical to the one Castiel had conjured just seconds ago.
… I haven’t run like that in a long time.” Dean lets out another deep breath as he looks down at the familiar in his arms. “If you’re gonna do that again, give a guy some warning, yeah? Or try running somewhere I can see you, so I don’t have to chase you again.” Castiel’s tail thumps once against the ground, small leaves and other debris lifting up as he moves away to look at Dean properly.
Dean’s wings flare out as he turns to the remainder of the coven, his eyes never leaving his brother as grace crackles under his skin. “You let him go,
“No. You’re free of Naomi, so technically you could go wherever you wanted. But… I want you here. Kinda got used to having you around, even if it’s not like this.” Castiel moves his hands from his pockets, linking them at the small of Dean’s back as he burrows his head in to the crook of his neck.
"DOG!" Castiel jumped out of the trance he didn't realise he was in, quickly waving his hand over the mess to tidy it up in his panic. He'd deal with the consequences of using his magic without thinking later, rushing out to find where Naomi had shouted from, the book staying firmly in his mind.
“Cas?” The word sounds far away as Castiel slowly sinks to the floor, head spinning as well as he covers his muzzle with his paws, closing his eyes to try and stop the spinning. “Cas… Whoa… Okay.” Dean’s voice gets closer, followed by the tantalising smell of burger that forces Castiel to open one eye to see where it’s coming from.
"Well, what would you have done? You've got more experience hitting dogs with your car than I do." It came closer again, and Castiel felt them kneel by him. He tried his hardest not to tremble as a hand gently came to rest on his fur, keeping his eyes firmly shut so they would think he was asleep.
“You’ve got enough time to figure it out, I suppose.” Bobby put his bottle on the deck before turning to Dean, a hint of mischief twinkling in his eyes. “Wouldn’t stay too long though. Got it on good authority there’s someone waitin’ for you out there.”
“I- I-” He sighed in resignation, hand dragging down his face. “Okay. You know I’m an Empath, rare as fuck, yada yada. I thought it was the coolest thing in the world when I found out that’s what I was. Safe to say there were…
terms, Cas, not hers anymore.” Castiel can feel his tail give a feeble wag as he tries to imagine doing any of the things Naomi had forbade him doing, his tail picking up more speed as he imagines doing those things with Dean at his side. He just about hears Dean’s laughter as his thoughts race through his head, wondering what about this Empath has him feeling so… He can’t work out what the feeling is, unsure why his heart is suddenly going a million miles an hour, why his tail continues to pick up speed.
It’s liberating in a way Dean has never felt before, all cares and worries melting away as he lets the rhythmic beat of his wings carry him forwards. On the one or two occasions where he stutters; Castiel is immediately at his side so he isn’t alone as he gets his rhythm back, the gentle squeeze of a hand and a soft smile almost enough to make him lose the rhythm again. He still doesn’t know how he ended up so lucky, all things considered. To have his angel by his side, willing to do whatever it takes to ensure his safety - Dean’s heart flips as he realises that the feeling goes both ways. It briefly makes him falter again, Castiel by his side to help him as the hunter merely looks on in pure adoration.
“... Think you found it.” Words are spat out through gritted teeth, colour returning to the hunter’s face as Castiel removes his hand from his wing.
The maze of corridors seemed to have got thicker in the brief period of time since rescuing Dean, more twists, turns and dead-ends than either Sam or Castiel could remember there being. It frustrated Dean, not knowing if the next corridor was going to be the one to lead them to the exit or not, to freedom and away from this damn coven. The next dead-end had his wings flaring out, growling and turning to punch the nearest wall.
“I’m assuming so, because I’m certain they weren’t there before.” Dean blinks, taking in the sight before him. Flowers cover every inch of the park, delicate blue and green blossoms that fill the air with a sweet fragrance as they sway gently in the breeze.
"I can feel that guilt from here buddy." The pity briefly turned to puzzled. "How does a dog even feel that much guilt anyway?" Castiel growled, angry enough to bare his teeth at the stranger. He held his hands up in defence, moving away a few more inches before Castiel stopped. He surprised himself at how animalistic he was being, putting it down to a mix of stress, fear and pain, topped off with being in an environment he didn't recognise. He huffed in annoyance, putting his head down on his paws and blinking slowly.
, bitch. I can and will smite you” He huffs as he moves towards the back seat, sighing in resignation as he turns back towards Castiel. “Could you help? I dunno how- Uh… Angles.”
"Oday, Cas. One hour. But dat all." He climbed down from the bed, swaying slightly as he made his way back to the bathroom where Castiel had found him days ago. The door clicked softly behind him, and he climbed into the shower cubicle, thankful for the extra amount of privacy it gave him. He brought his knees up to under his chin and wings wrapped automatically around him, letting out a deflated sigh as he heard Castiel shuffling himself and papers about in the main part of their room. He surprised himself with a yawn, the instincts of the wings taking over of their own accord, moving so Dean had no choice but to lie down to be comfortable.
“No, no, don't stop. That... That feels really... Really good, Cas.” Castiel grinned and resumed where he had left off, revelling in the little noises that escaped Dean every now and again that spurred him on. At some point his own wings had materialised, the ends gently resting on top of Dean's that had the hunter releasing a low moan. He laughed to himself and moved his hands further in to Dean's wings, eyes catching on the glistening that had appeared at the join between wing and skin. His eyes widened as he subconsciously moved one hand towards it, angling his hand to get a better feel of it. Dean let out a guttural moan as he grazed it, fingers coming away coated in clear fluid that his brain was telling him was very distinctly 'DEAN'. He sniffed it, assaulted by the smell of apple pie, leather and gun cleaner, and before his brain could register what he was doing, he had both fingers in his mouth, trying to get as much as he could. He hummed happily around his fingers, not noticing Dean opening his eyes and staring at the sight in front of him. His jaw hung open in disbelief, the sight sending all of the blood in his body towards his groin almost instantaneously.
