John moved in step beside Sherlock to maneuver the bush into the tent, enjoying simply having a reason to be close to the man as their shoulders bumped. A number of staff members were flitting about, and thankfully someone directed where to set the plant down.
“That’s different,” Sherlock mumbled around a mouthful of baked good. “Professional intel is important.”
“Of course not. It was like being attacked by a sucker-fish.”  John regarded him coyly from under his eyelashes. “It did get me thinking about who I DID want to be kissing though.”
“It was hidden in the headboard,” Sherlock said, sliding down the bed to show John his find. It was small and thin, not unlike a pill carrier. Further examination revealed a top that screwed off.
A warm-up duo, some new Bajoran boys, had begun sparring in the ring. The crowd cried out, egging them on as they feinted and jabbed at each other. The scantily-clad bar girls whirled around the crowd, doling out drinks, and collecting bets, as busy as the brawlers. Sherlock looked around and smiled. For some reason the chaos of it suited him, and he relaxed into the frenetic joy of it all.
“WHAAAAT?” Three people cried in tandem as all eyes swung John’s way.  It was John’s turn to colour up.
“By all means, please do . . .  perhaps from your house? I’m sure we can have you back over sometime. For dinner? I’ll let Sherlock know you dropped off such nice jam.”
“Most likely still licking his wounds at the holiday villa, too embarrassed to talk to any of his friends or coworkers yet. He’ll probably resurface when his funds get low.” Sherlock shrugged.
“You’re a better man than me to put up with the bloke. I can’t imagine rooming with him,” Mike said, clearly warming to the topic. “Molly’s right about the labs. He’s nearly exploded them a number of times. It’s a wonder they don’t expel him.”
“Hey, hey, love, hold on.” John pulled Sherlock’s hands down from his jaw, cradling them in his own. “I’m all in here. There’s nothing your brother is going to say to scare me off.”
When it grew later, John ventured back out and started making dinner. He wasn’t a whiz in the kitchen by any means, but even he could manage to boil some spaghetti, and heat the jar of pasta sauce he’d bought. The flatmate, Kurt, stopped by to let John know he was going out with some friends. “Would you like to come along?” he asked kindly.
“Would Victor mind if we came out naked?” John asked the riot of curls pressed under his chin, feeling too comfortable to move.
“Ach, you love it, and you know it. It gets you all hot and bothered.” The look John sent him was pure cheek, but God help them, it was quite true.
John giggled, the sound music to Sherlock’s ears. “Ah, well, then, if I’m beating out some corpses, I guess that’s okay.”
“Of course.” John moved closer just as the woman stood upright, whipping off the scarf to reveal a grinning Lupaza standing before them.
“My Aunt Rose married an investment counselor at a financial firm . . . we don’t keep up with their family much.”
Sherlock nodded. “I can drive you. Why don’t you take a shower first?” He nodded toward the hallway. “There are fresh towels in the linen cupboard. I’ll go start the tea.”
Sherlock found himself focused on that one bare foot sticking out between them.  John wiggled his toes, and Sherlock had to catch his breath at the sight of those pale knobby digits he knew almost better than his own lying so close.
“YES. That’s it! Well, not tribal markings but just as good as! Gang signs!”  Sherlock’s eyes flared to life.
“Sorry, looks like I don’t have it just yet.” Rhys chuckled, reaching out to put a hand on John’s arm. “Thank you for helping me though, John. I think I’m getting a bit better. At least it slowed down.”
“What, but I like this one!” John protested, looking at the light green Vauxhall Viva hatchback. It was the best of the lot, and John had already fallen a bit in love with it.
“Five minutes.”  Sherlock cocked an eyebrow. “All I need is five minutes and I can have you doing a simple box step.” He looked a bit feline, like a great black panther, as he leaned John’s way.
“Hey, I wanted to thank for all your help with the orgo, at the study group. I really feel like I had a handle on things thanks to you.”
The team fell into an ecstatic huddle as soon as they reached the ground, pulling each other into a group hug. Several hands patted John on the arse, and he didn’t even care who they belonged to. A contact high carried them all the way to the Gryffindor common room where a party kicked off in top gear, everyone giddy with the house victory. John had a bottle in one hand, and his other arm around Owen’s neck, the two of them singing some dirty Wizard drinking song when a first year tapped John shyly on the shoulder.
“I don’t suppose you two need the sleeping bag this time, do you?” Mrs. Watson asked them before she turned in.
Sherlock minimized his console screen as the clerk stepped into his office with a reader pad. He was busy relocating a shipment of all-weather tents to a warehouse closer to the edge of town, and he’d rather the woman didn’t see.
John grabbed his lunch from the small fridge in the staff room and moved to join Sarah at the table. She had a new, bright red top on, and John couldn’t help admiring how it hugged her curves, if only briefly.
“Wicked!” The taller of the boys exclaimed from across the room. Alastaire and John moved to look over their shoulders, peering at their find. “See that!” The boy pointed to a row of hideous shrunken heads lining a cupboard shelf.
John was inside sat on top of the man in the gorilla suit minus the mask, holding him in a headlock.  He grinned wildly when the police arrived to handcuff the alleged smuggler despite the large mark that was beginning to darken the side of his face.
The Gryffindor tower was complete and utter chaos as students packed, and readied for summer break. Blaring music and random explosions had been going off throughout the dorms all morning as everyone giddily celebrated the end of exams.
John proceeded to feed Sherlock the rest of the peach slices in the bowl, guiding each one to his waiting mouth.
Shit. John had gone and cocked it up already. He should have known he wouldn’t be up to bedding the likes of this exquisite man. John turned to sit on the edge of the mattress, near shaking.
Finally back on Bajor, Sherlock is shocked at the changes that have been wrought on the planet in his absence.
“Very much,” Sherlock said in spite of himself. He and Irene had gone to a popular play just last week, making sure to be seen arm in arm by the upper-class crowd there. “She’s not your average idiot.”
John laughed. “I’d hardly call myself a celebrity, but no, I’ve never gotten emails like this before.”
The door opened and Mycroft ushered them out into a plush waiting room. "Just so little brother. Well done. John would you do the honors to confirm?"
“I think it’s an added bonus to whatever else you have to do.” John took a swallow of his cooling tea.
“John, I am sorry about that.” Sherlock looked so suddenly contrite that John had to lean across the table and drop a kiss to the end of his nose.
check out books to take home if he wished. Sherlock told her that sadly he was just visiting, and would be leaving the area soon.
Before the next potions class, John caught Alastaire outside in the corridor, waving Teddy, Tom, and Dom to go in ahead of him. He fished his potion textbook out of his bag and offered it to Alastaire.
Sherlock waited even longer before his spoke again, wishing desperately that he had a cigarette. Damn nicotine patches. They had nothing on the real thing.
It was almost anticlimactic to slip down the back street, and make their way as quickly as John could hobble to find a taxi a few blocks away. Sherlock spat out John’s address to the driver as soon as he’d settled them both inside. He pulled out his phone to type a message as the cab moved into traffic.
Angela’s bond-mate, a sweet Omega named Mirabelle, had made an appearance one morning, bringing home-made muffins to pass out to the office. She’d given Kristin a look somewhere between pity and contempt.
The tickets had cost a pretty penny, and John dug them out of his pocket to present them to a smiling staff member at the door.
“Peace, peace!” Victor backed down instantly. The cigarette passed between them again. “You didn’t use to be so touchy.”
They fell into step naturally walking back to a busier road to hail a taxi. John had slotted so easily into his life, Sherlock felt like he was waiting for the other shoe to fall, for John to wake up one morning and be sick of his brooding, sorry self, and move on. So far this had failed to happen.
“Good. I wish you the best of luck. You will make a very good healer.” Mrs. Garcia left her chair to clasp John’s hand. “I have a feeling about these things.”
“But I am glad for a chance to speak to you, Jean. It is such fun my birthday week, but sometimes it gets a bit crazy. I hope you are enjoying your stay here.”
It was heaven losing himself in the taste and feel of John, the soft groan that escaped the back of John’s throat. After an age of kissing, and a smattering of whistles and clapping somewhere behind them, they finally surfaced for air.
“Nonsense, I know you’ve nothing in the fridge, and you’ve better things to do than run to the shops.”
“Wow, yeah. I will.” John ran a hand back through his fringe. “I still can’t believe you can do this.”
Irene was as gay as the day was long and constantly trying to get John to come with her to the Gay Student Alliance, but John could never find the free time. Irene had moaned in the pub one night about her parents being less than thrilled when she’d announced her orientation, and John had admitted that he couldn’t even come out to his homophobic father. They’d been queer comrades-in-arms ever since.
“There's another guinea in it for you if you return with an answer to a question,” John told the boy, holding up the coin. “Ask the housekeeper, 'What's John's favourite meal?'”
John, touched to the core, looked into Hamish’s big eyes and nodded. “Yeah, you go change and we’ll be up in a bit.”
Jim. John felt dizzy. Jim couldn’t have. Not Hamish. Please, God, not Hamish. “Thank you…” John said faintly, leaving in a haze. There were two main possibilities, as far as John could see. Jim could be withholding Hamish from John as punishment. Perhaps he transferred Hamish to another school, a school where John couldn’t visit him. John shook his head bitterly. Of course. It was what Jim had always wanted: a protégé. What better way than to remove John’s influence altogether?
“These are just some of the stories, and none of them are the final ones. I won’t tell you about your future too much but…do you like beekeeping?”
John set his mouth as Jim’s eyebrows rose. An invitation. Well, he wouldn’t disappoint. He turned up in Moriarty’s bedroom several minutes later and slipped under the covers, muttering a “Goodnight.”
As John began the MRI, he explained, “The image will take a while to process. In the meantime, I’ll look through the database and find a good aneurysm for you. Keep still in there.”
Over the months, as John’s and Sherlock’s earnings added up, they were able to furnish the flat comfortably, buying a bed for Hamish when he came home on weekends, clothes for themselves so they no longer stuck out like sore thumbs, and Mary’s housekeeping services. Mary was the most welcome addition, as they were both utterly lost in the foreign, antiquated kitchen. They’d been mostly living off street vendors’ food, and both men had lost weight.
Jane, startled by the fervency and anguish in John’s voice, nodded. She blinked back a few tears of her own. Of course she wanted to keep her son away from Jim, and she knew all too well what it was like to miss her love. She sniffed and gave another nod. “All right. All right, sir…I can help…what exactly did you want me to do?”
Jim gnashed his teeth together. “Get. In. The bed. If you aren’t going to leave, you are going to sleep in the bed so you’re not stiff and sore and off your game. So.
Jim kill him? “No…you need a gunman,” he said, then darted past Jim and out into the street, chucking the bottles as far as he could.
That proved to be impossible. Jim’s hands were rough on John’s body, yanking off his jacket and grabbing at his shoulders. He bit at John’s lips, his tongue forcing its way inside John’s mouth. He kissed John into disorientation, pushing him backwards until he nearly tripped over the staircase.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow to Molly’s question. “You wouldn’t believe me if I told you. This time I won’t be coming back—neither of us will. We will, for all intents and purposes, be dead.”
The doorknob turned slowly, then the door swung open and Molly Hooper stepped inside. “Erm…hi. I heard—I heard that John moved out, and I hadn’t heard anything from St. Bart’s, so I wanted to see if you were…okay.” She looked around the disheveled flat and pressed her lips together, taking in the unmistakable smell of cigarette smoke, the empty pill bottles and the full ashtrays littering the table, and Sherlock himself, who looked gaunt and unwell, lying glassy-eyed on the sofa.
Sherlock burst into laughter himself, unable to contain all the confusion. They were both too overwhelmed to say anything coherent until the Doctor returned with a battered copy of
John trudged up to his bedroom, replaying the kiss over and over, the feeling of Sherlock’s lips, the closeness of him. Although he reimagined it over and over, it hurt the same amount each time.
The next day, when John informed Jim that he was to stay in bed and rest, Jim let a steady string of curses fly at him, but followed his orders and stayed in bed, grumbling about boredom and work and taking more laudanum than he could possibly need.
One day, he came back from discarding a body with some of Jim's other lackeys to find Jim in a rage. John and the three other men held back by the door, none of them wanting to approach him while he was in one of his moods. Finally, John took a hesitant step towards Jim, who had just overturned his desk and kicked a hole in the wall.
John peeled off the last of his clothes and stood awaiting orders. Maybe the ropes were only set out as a threat. Maybe he wouldn't actually use them.
don't have clearance there. I'm not even entirely sure what goes on there, but it's one of the most secure places in London."
Sherlock seemed to be memorizing the flat. His eyes scanned over everything—the skull, the bookshelves, John’s laptop, the dirty teacups on the tray teetering under stacks of old newspapers, the bullet holes in the wall. “I hate not knowing. When we’ll have to go,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock clenched his jaw and closed his eyes against the bright white surroundings. He had always hated hospitals, hated being reminded of the frailty his human body. What if John actually found something? The prospect of his own mind turning on him was one of his darkest fears. It was a long thirty minutes before John was finally done scanning.
Owen tried to convince John to return with him to the U.K. over the course of the evening, but John remaining firm in his decision. They ended up back at the villa passing a jug of sangria on the terrace as they watched the full moon shimmering over the ocean. It left a bright trail over the water that looked completely solid, as if you could step out onto it and walk right off into the horizon.
They waited until the tech crew member arrived with a bag of diagnostic tools. Kira quickly explaining the situation before they left the crime scene.
“Come on.” John climbed into the bath, sinking down into the warm water, and held out his arms for Sherlock to join him.
John pulled up beside him, suddenly realizing how winded he was. He bent, hands on his knees trying to catch his breath.
might be a more appropriate description for his mate’s ignominious position. Sherlock had several cushions tucked around him to help support the weight of his swollen belly, but with the last weeks of gestation drawing to a close, the twins had expanded to simply monstrous proportions. Sherlock looked ready to pop at any given moment.
“Just what the HELL is going on here?” Kira roared at those still standing. “Can SOMEONE explain how valuable resources were wasted today over some BULLSHIT fight?!”
“Possibly… Mycroft loves to appear clever, so hiding a clue in Cluedo is the sort of thing that he would do. But expecting us to hunt through every game — or every book or DVD, for that matter — just seems too mundane.”
Sherlock had no words for the feeling of being held safe in John’s arms. He let himself relax by degrees.
The emotional component of Sherlock’s contentment was the most unexpected. He had no frame of reference for the way he felt about John. He cared about what John thought, and about what he wanted. He enjoyed John’s company to a degree he wouldn’t have believed possible. With John, he felt seen and valued, safe and loved.
“Yeah, the thing is though, I don’t know how girls meet each other, you know? I mean we’re always complimenting each other and being friendly. How do you know when it means something  . . . more?”
“So, you called me about a favour?” Sherlock leaned into the steam rising from his cup, wrapping his hands around the warmth of it.
Suddenly Victoire went rigid, her face a rictus of shock as one of Teddy's spell glanced her shoulder. She slipped sideways, tumbling from her broom. Teddy cried out as he streaked forward to catch her.
“See ya in a tick.” John backed out of the room, waving a bit awkwardly as he let the door swing shut behind him. He turned and sprinted down the hall to the department office, slammed the letter down on the desk of the surprised secretary there, and made it a back to the locker room in record time. He had the place to himself. Tearing off his kit, he took the world’s quickest shower, scrubbing his groin and pits as fast as he could. After a cursory swipe with a towel, he threw on his clothes, struggling into his jeans and tee and jumper while still slightly damp. He was finger combing his hair back as he neared the lobby.
“Oh no, I’m in no hurry. So do you have your own car, or should I call you a cab? No sense in hanging about with himself gone. Who knows when he’ll be back. You might as well head home." The woman had pulled a mobile out of her pocket to look expectantly at John. “It’s alright, luv. So many of Sherlock’s friends don’t come with cars.”
“They may have us grounded, but we won’t go down without a fight,” she growled, pushing a gun into Sherlock's hands.
“We’ll need to step up our discipline,” another officer said. “The filthy animals are getting too bold. We’ve lost two armories in the area just last month. We need to squash this unrest now.”
John glanced around the room. He told himself he wasn’t actually looking for a mad scientist with a head of dark, fly-away curls in the room. Still, he was disappointed when he failed to spot the man. Damn.
“I dunno . . .” John began when Nigel, Mr. sea-slug-in-training himself, appeared to interrupt. “Sherlock, there you are! Look lively, man, I need donuts and tea in the conference room in fifteen minutes.”
“I love you, too,” Sherlock gasped. “John, oh, John.” He peppered kisses across John’s face over and over.
“That’s it! No one is allowed to speak to John again.” Sherlock angled himself to stand slightly in front. “You’re all being utterly insufferable, and unspeakably crass!”
“Huh, fancy that.” John took a swallow of his drink as the pleasant-looking man and woman dressed in matching tartan passed by.
When John explained the problem, the professor assured him that an express note could be send to the boy's parents right away.
“Sherlock, are you okay?” John’s worried eyes hovered overhead as Sherlock reached back to rub at the sore spot on his skull.
The dancer pulled upright onto his knees, and folded back, his head dropping behind him, revealing the long column of his pale throat as corded arms reached up, stretching, grasping, a desperate yearning being telegraphed with every fiber of his being.
John scowled at the photographer and let him know that his services were required back inside. After watching the man apologize and scurry off, John was free to do what he actually wanted which was move closer to the beautiful man in the shadows.
“There will be NO fighting.” Sherlock insisted. “If any fighting goes down, we will draw attention to our taking a soil reclaimator, and attention is the LAST thing we need
“Yeah, and here’s Summer Flu, and Stomach Rot.” John lifted the fuzzy shapes fondly. “I used to love the giant microbes.”
An object d’art graced the side of one wall, water trickling down the twisting side of it to fall into the pool below
“Hardly. They heat their honey for extraction. It’s not raw at all. There’s no comparison in our product.”
“All right, that’s enough. I’m sure we’ve all got important things we need to be doing elsewhere.” John might be covered in mud, but he was still a prefect, and he meant to use his power well. “I suggest we all get back to them.” John raised an eyebrow archly at the Slytherins.
“TWO YEARS?” John cried, his mouth falling open. “But I thought you had plans to go to Edinburgh after graduation . . .”
They settled again when all was done, mugs in hand. John pulled the blanket back around himself, just one foot poking out below the bottom edge. “Ohhhh, that’s good.” John sighed after his first swallow of tea.
“Right, fine.  I can delay things for a day.” John licked his lips nervously. “But I mean it, you have to get out of here. This place is going sky-high when everything is set off.”
“Here, let’s get the tea together, or Sherlock will know we’re just standing here talking about him.” John moved to the cupboard.
Salud to you, dear readers, and I hope you've enjoyed reading this story as much as I have bringing it into the world!
Victor laughed. “It wasn’t like that. It's . . . complicated. I like women mostly . . . but Sherlock just had a way of getting under my skin. He’s something else.”
“Yes, lick your palm. Get it nice and wet. Imagine it’s me taking your fingers into my mouth. Sucking each one down.”
John was charmed at how his name sounded in her accent.  “I am, thank you so much for having me to stay, ma’am.”
“You are always welcome at my home.” Mrs. Watson bowed her head slightly in reply, giving the correct response to the ritual exchange. “Thank you, dear,” she ad libbed, accepting the parcel from him. “Sherlock, listen, you know if your parents didn’t mind you
John blew a rude noise. “Who cares about what’s allowed? We make our own rules. That’s the whole point about being in the Resistance.”
Going against their word, their dwarves broke out into gales of laughter at the Little Hobbit who had blushed clean up to his pointed ears. Chortling and giggling, the dwarves clutched their round bellies with mirth until the grating sound of the large stone moving stopped them. When the boulder had moved back just enough to allow a very small person to slip through -
“Hey, we’d better go.” Jojo glanced at the cheap chrono on his wrist, nudging the tall one, Kirby. “We don’t wanna be late.”
The hum turned to a gasp of surprise as John pressed his own foot into Sherlock’s crotch. Anchoring his heel against the base of Sherlock’s cock, John pointed and then flexed his foot several times, noting a distinctive swelling through the fabric of his trousers.
“I don’t know, was it?” Sherlock lifted a shoulder. “I’m sorry John. My life isn’t the best ruler for normality.”
“Yes, but then you’d be stuck with the false belief that you’re not capable of mental arithmetic. 1,596 plus 3,192. Do it.”
As soon as John saw the blue sky with wispy white clouds scattered high above, and felt the warm sun on his skin a weight lifted, his panic dissolving away. Freedom. He smiled to himself, trapped on an island by Sherlock’s maniac of a brother, but he felt freer now than he had since the bullet slammed into his shoulder.
“Groom got cold feet. Up and left for a new job in Majorca without telling anyone. Sent a text message the next day calling it quits.”
Sherlock’s flatmate moved about the kitchen frying something in a pan when John returned to the front room with his packed bag in hand.
"Well enough that I want to drag you back inside this minute. What do you say Mycroft? This our honeymoon cottage for the near future?"
He crawled back into bed beside Sherlock, which was really the only place he wanted to be. He settled himself stiffly, keeping far away from Sherlock, something the other man allowed for half a minute before gathering him in. John allowed himself to be manhandled until his face was pressed against Sherlock’s neck. John breathed in the familiar, sleepy smell of him, and wanted to simply die.
John tried to take in everything as they moved along. The tapestries, and old suits of armor in the corners made the place as atmospheric as Hogwarts, but it was so dark, he really couldn’t make out many details. After a bend in the corridor, they finally emerged into a room with some light to it.
“You are so welcome, Jean. But oh, you poor dear.” Grand-mère  Holmes patted John’s cheek as he and Sherlock stood in the  hallway ready to depart, rucksacks and bags of baked goods weighing them down.  “Left at Hogwarts all alone next year.” She clucked her tongue in sympathy.
“Obviously!” John balled his fists at his side. “GOD!  Sherlock, those things are terrible for you.”
“Alright, you two, come along, let’s not tarry. Lots to do before the rehearsal dinner tonight,” Mrs. Holmes tutted, trying to bat them along. “Lily was just telling me there’s an awful mix up with the bridesmaid’s dresses, they got the wrong color on two of the . . .”
.  Sherlock waded over to the rocks. He pulled himself up onto a wide flat shelf, staining the surface dark with the water sluicing from his body. The stone was deliciously warm after the cool of the water. Sherlock stretched out, luxuriating in the feel of the sun shining down on his chilled flesh. He closed his eyes, a happy rumble in his throat.
“Sherlock!” John pounced as soon as the door swished closed. “God, why didn’t you answer any of my messages? I’ve been worried sick.”
John chuckled. “God, I love you, sweet.” He put a hand down to splay over Sherlock’s extravagant stomach. “Love them too. God, they aren’t even here yet, and I love them.”
“John?” He turned toward his . . . friend? Lover? Partner? They hadn’t really come up with any terms. It hadn’t been necessary here with just the two of them. They knew what they were to each other.
John woke in the dark, not sure what had disturbed him. He reached instinctively for Sherlock, but some emptiness in the room alerted him to the fact that Sherlock was gone even before his hand touched unoccupied mattress. John waited a few minutes, but when Sherlock didn’t appear from a trip to the loo, he sat up, pushing the duvet back to swing his feet to the rug.
“Change channel.”  The vid screen shifted to another version of the same news report filmed from a different angle.
“Yeah, no worries, we’ll be fine.” John chimed in, keeping his face as innocent as he could. “I do appreciate all your help though. It was lovely meeting you all.”
Something dark passed over John’s face, and he sat up, pushing the remains of his breakfast away. “I think I left a book for Divinations in my room. Teddy, I’ll catch up with you when class starts.” John grabbed his bag as he rose.
“No, thank you.” John managed a smile. “Trying to cut down on sweets. Being a doctor means you know how bad these things are for you.” John tried to blot out the memory of cream cake as dinner for four nights running.
John titled his head to take it deeper, his tongue dipping into the welcoming heat of Sherlock’s plush mouth. It was refreshing to be the same height, not titling his head back to kiss the too-tall man. John barely registered the far-off jangle of keys dropping to the ground before Sherlock’s large hands slid around his hips to cup his arse, dragging him in. John gasped as his swiftly-rising erection made contact with Sherlock’s groin. John couldn’t help titling his pelvis, angling even closer.
They slipped into the house and moved past the front rooms filled with the chatter of people, and the tinkling of glasses as the servants moved among them. When they saw the hallway leading to the upstairs bedrooms filled with a knot of laughing people, Sherlock rolled his eyes, and led John down another corridor toward the back of the house.
“Stupid, stupid . . . what?” Sherlock sat back up with start. “Pairs of number. From an illustration in a book. John, it could be a book code.”
“Mycroft cut off access to my money when he found out what was going on. He had spies watching me all the time.” Sherlock huffed a sad laugh. “He paid the rent for my new flat, and set up accounts at stores and restaurants around the neighborhood. Otherwise, I was skint.”
“So, it was lucky you finally got the bed thing sorted.” Mike nudged John as they walked on. “Took them long enough.”
“Oh, no.” John reached back for the pages, pulling them from Sherlock’s grip. “It doesn’t really say that.”
Sherlock rolled onto his side away from John, and John did the same, turning toward the opposite wall. Despite someone having what sounded like a rap concert down the hall, John let the soothing warmth of the body nearby lull him to sleep.
“That’s not a pirate.” Sherlock’s frown shifted the cranial bumps over his forehead. “It’s just Old Jenno, the gardener.”
John grinned as a bag of Bott’s every-flavoured beans came his way, and he grabbed a handful.  “Thanks, everyone. Thanks so much.”
Sherlock looked at him in confusion but before he could say anything John continued, “I feel like some fresh air, let’s go for a walk.”
“So, here I am. What are your other two wishes?” Sherlock waggled his eyebrows in mock suggestiveness.
“No, you didn’t. It was all me. I asked you to do that scene. I just . . . I didn’t know it was going to go tits up like that.”
He passed by the freezers, on his way out, opening them to check on their food supplies. By and large, the best things left to them were still frozen.  John poked around, making a mental inventory of what was there. He said a silent prayer of thanks that they weren’t still reduced to wandering around in the dark hunting for packets of snacks, when an idea occurred to him – a picnic of sorts. It would be something fun to do, and a way to get Sherlock to try some new foods. He chose some things to thaw, taking them back to the kitchen, then poked through their packaged goods to add to his collection.
“Didn’t need it earlier,” she grunted. “Besides, it sucks juice like nobody’s business. We won’t have power for long.”
“Where’s Sherlock, then?” Some part of John had hoped to simply ignore Victor until he went away, but it was difficult to pretend a gorgeous, over six-feet tall, muscled man in a white tee shirt, old jeans, and a ruffled apron wasn’t cooking breakfast in the kitchen.
“All lives are lost eventually, Sherlock. Caring is not an advantage." Mycroft hestitated, pausing in the midst of turning. "Oh, and Sherlock. I'd be careful of your new friend, Gul Dukat, hmm? Let's just say I doubt he has your best interests at heart.”
“Oh, GOD, Sher . . .” John’s head fell back against the door to the flat with a whump as Sherlock swallowed his cock down further. John’s hand naturally fell to wind into the dark curls bobbing before him, holding on. When he felt himself pulling too hard, he backed off.
Sherlock bit his tongue, suppressing the shiver that wanted to run through him. A few minutes later, he excused himself, intimating he needed the toilet. He redressed as fast as he could, and returned to his room to throw the few things he had unpacked into his bag. When Irene finally returned, Sherlock was keeping vigil from his cracked door. He pounced on her, urging her to get ready to go as soon as possible.
“No, you wouldn’t.” She grimaced. “Oh, Sherlock. I know he’s a bit of a pompous  . . . baboon at times, but he’s your big brother. He cares about you.”
“I can’t imagine it’s very warm, all those holes in everyone’s clothes,” Molly whispered to John, nodding to a group of girls ahead of them. They were dressed in massive jumpers and tight, faded jeans that looked as though they’d been deliberated mangled with kitchen shears.
“Fine. How are things down at the fire ring?” Sherlock raked his eyes over John. He looked exhausted.
“Alright, fine, so you fucked things up. Tell him you’re sorry.” Harry crossed her arms over her chest.
His companion was something else, tall, pale, ethereal-looking, gliding along with his great coat billowing out behind him. For just a moment, John had the notion that he was out with an elf straight from the pages of the Tolkien he’d read as a boy.
“I’m positive this is going to be a fecking bitch,” Gwen said from the other side of her girlfriend.
“Alright you lot, no complaining,” Coach barked as they finished practice with a set of push-ups and crunches. “Just because we won ONE game doesn’t mean we go all soft!”
“John, I’m sorry, I don’t mean to judge you.” Sherlock felt muddled, horribly confused. He blinked trying to bring John into better focus, lovely, beautiful . . . furious John. Sherlock wanted to cry.
“Sounds fantastic.” John settled into the luxurious seat. He could still taste Sherlock on his lips.
Ever since the GSA Meet and Greet, Gwen and Irene had been nearly joined at the hip. John was happy for them. He’d dutifully shown up at the event, sipped a coke, chatted with few familiar faces, and then slipped out the side door when Irene wasn’t looking. Of course the fact that she was already chatting up Gwen hadn’t made his early get-away too difficult.
“John.” Sherlock pushed past the lump that had formed in his throat. “I’m sorry. I wanted to tell you earlier, about everything . . .”
“Nope, sorry bruv. That was Sherlock.” John waved him off.  “The elves don’t owe me anything.” Just the mention of Sherlock’s name put a pang through his chest. John wished with all his heart that Sherlock could have joined in their game. Maybe they could find a Wizard tag place in Germany next time he visited.
There were no teasing touches, no lingering kisses. Sherlock meant business, and John had no choice but to go along with it.
“The hell you were. The guy sounds like a total arsehole. Fucker.” John could feel his anger building on Sherlock’s behalf. “Tell me where he lives, I’ll go kick his arse for you.”
It was like having heat lightning crackle up his spine. Sherlock scooped John into his arms, bringing him closer to nuzzle under his jaw. John giggled beautifully.
It was a blessing and a curse being reassigned to Bajor proper.  He’d even been stationed in the same province where he’d grown up in a city called Illria. Sherlock’s entire being reveled in the familiar scents and sights of Bajor, but the changes to what he remembered kept surprising him.  Years of martial law had taken their toll on the beloved country of his childhood. Sherlock had boarded a train to Dahkur City on his first day off for a visit full of disappointments. It had been shocking to find the Bajoran quarter, a place he remember filled with brightly–painted buildings and a bustling traffic of autos and animal-drawn carts side by side, all but gutted.  Most notable was the complete lack of any standing temples wherever he went. He remembered the call of temple bells in the background steadily sounding out each hour so vividly. Their absence was jarring. So many Bajorans had fled the planet, escaping to refugee camps in nearby systems, that the Bajoran quarter was nearly a ghost town now. The neighborhood where Sherlock had grown up had even changed beyond recognition. The rows of stately manors he remembered had been knocked down, replaced by a low, squat military facility built in their stead.
Over the last few weeks, Sherlock had loaned John either the truck or the Aston Martin for his physio appointments, even coming along a few times. To John’s chagrin, Jenna, his trainer, spent more time ogling Sherlock perched in the waiting area reading his phone than actually attending to John’s progress. Still, John realized that if he were to commute to a job on a regular basis, he really needed his own wheels.
The Little Hobbit pulled up his courage by the boot straps, stood tall and read in a quavering voice “I am a very, naughty little hobbit, and I need to be spanked.”
“I understand.” Sherlock put his nearly empty mug down on the table with a clunk. “Perhaps we can arrange a place for me to simply drop off supplies.” He made to unload his bag completely, piling the things he’d brought on the ground. “I can go.”
John woke to morning light spilling in the windows. The telly was turned off and he had a throw blanket pulled over him.
I love the idea going around the fandom that Victor Trevor, Sherlock's old friend or boyfriend from uni, should be played by the actor, Idris Elba. I just saw "The Dark Tower" last week, and Mr. Elba was FANTASTIC in that. I'm officially jumping on the bandwagon!
Together they stumbled through the falling dark to find their way back to the building. Once they’d cleared the path through the wall, the light through the front windows remained a beacon in the night to guide them home.
Sherlock moved, and John leaned off the bed to grab a bottle. He returned to squirt something slippery over his hand.
Sherlock checked into his hotel, showing the passport with his cover name to the front desk. The man was polite in a oily way, soon providing him with a key, and a boy to help carry his luggage up the stairs. With many apologies, the man explained that the elevator wasn’t working that day. Sherlock thanked him and allowed the boy to carry his suitcase while he kept the camera bag as they tackled the narrow staircase. The boy was a cheerful thing, nearly fluent in English. He gave his name as Farid as he chattered through the climb.
“Look, I got some arnica today,” John said once they were inside. “Let me put it on the . . .” John motioned toward Sherlock's cheek.
A number of women were dancing together, but they were the only same-sex, male couple out on the floor. Still, no one paid them any attention as they jumped into the beat. John enjoyed matching his moves to Sherlock’s swiveling hips and shoulders, the two of them swaying back and forth in tandem. The lighting shifted and an explosion of tiny white lights swirled over them, sliding off of Sherlock’s cheekbones, and lean form. John wanted to eat him alive, but settled for grasping him about the hips, sliding a thumb into his belt loop.
“Certainly, sir. Just let me know if you need any assistance.” The clerk bowed him in before scuttling off.
“No, it’s fine.” Sherlock washed his hands quickly under the thin stream of cold water. His eyes flicked back toward the showers as a high-pitched giggle trilled from that direction. “We should probably go.”
I found this little short languishing on my hard drive. Now seemed like the perfect time to finish it up, and send it off into the world. :)
They’d stopped beside a nice but older silver BMW. Mr. Holmes clicked the device on his key chain and it beeped in a friendly way as the doors unlocked.
John squeezed Sherlock’s skinny length tight. “Promise me you’ll remember to eat more, okay? No working through all your meals. Food. Twice a day, all right?”
“Ah, fuck off, ye poncy Englishman. I’ve a razor.” John kicked him lightly under the table. “I just don’t use it every day. Why bother, it’s Afghanistan.”
Sherlock was nearly biting his nails when Irene finally emerged with her suitcases in tow. At the front desk, Sherlock requested a car, and asked after Molly and her husband, Dov Vorlem. Relief flooded over him when he heard they had already checked out. Sherlock joined Irene on one of the couches in the lobby to wait, nearly bouncing out of his skin with impatience.
“God, I wish I had a cigarette,” Sherlock said without meaning to. The chills had gotten stronger until his entire body shook with them.
Sherlock marveled anew at how well John’s mum maneuvered the car around London traffic on the drive back to the Watsons’ home. “Sherlock, it’s darling of you to agree to help out at the estate office,” She called back from her place at the wheel. “It’s a bit of a scramble with both our intern and the secretary out this month.”
“My old therapist kept suggesting I take a trip to the shore, and I kept shrugging her off. If only she’d known all I needed was to be kidnapped, spend a season in a dystopian prison, and meet a gorgeous genius to spend a day at the beach. Easy peasy.”
They rolled out of bed to clean up and get dressed, finding their dirty clothes in the bathroom to carry with them. John insisted on making the bed even though Sherlock pointed out someone would be along to clean it later.
“Look, John I need to tell you, this was an aberration. I never do this. I don’t want you to think . . .”
“Also I know we haven’t been completely sexually compatible. If you were looking forward to dating when you got back to London, to finding a woman to settle down with, I wouldn’t hold you to . . .”
“Yes, exactly.” The smile that lit up Sherlock’s face was a beautiful thing. He whirled back around to point to a section of his work, and John couldn’t help noticing how nicely his button-up shirt strained across his broad shoulders.
“He’s a friend, see? It’s okay, sweetheart,” Lupaza crooned as Sherlock warily tried entering the main room later.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft answered, surprised, wearing something pale, and soft, obviously on his way to bed. It seemed strange to see him out of his usual tight, black uniform. Sherlock had almost fancied that it had become part of him like a second skin. “Where are you?”
John pushed the doors open, and the birds escaped into the larger space beyond. John and Sherlock stepped into the unlit room after them.  The conservatory smelled rich and humid, pots of plants barely visible all around them in the dark. The small birds had a faint glimmer to them though, and could easily be tracked as they careened around the conservatory bumping crazily into walls and windows.
“Anything you’d like, Sherlock.” John’s voice was low, intimate. “Well, anything within reason,” he added.
Then he girded his mental loins (while his actual loins screamed at him to hurry the fuck up) and focused on the maths. A minute later, he had his answer. “1.68.”
A group of children weaving a craft in the main room looked up, their shocked faces following them as they thundered up the stairs, making their way to the computer rooms.
“No, it’s our farm. All four of us have a stake here.” John spead his hands out to include the four of them.  “What’s the vote?”
The peaceful feeling of his Gram’s kitchen stayed with him though as he blinked his eyes open to the buttery light spilling into the hushed hotel room. The mattress felt like a great enveloping cloud. John tried to stretch, arch his back, and enjoy waking up slowly after a bit of a lie in, but a great weight was keeping him in place.
John got up, pulling on Sherlock’s dressing gown hanging on the back of the door, and made a lap around the flat. No Sherlock.  John came back to dig out some fresh clothes, and after a quick shower, returned to the sitting room dressed for the day.  He found Sherlock’s flatmate Kurt up and at the table reading the paper over eggs and toast.
John squinted into the sun at the large white stork struggling against the wind over the beach.  “You’re a bit late aren’t you, luv?” John muttered to himself watching its progress.  The storks generally finished their migration south by the end of May, but this one seemed to have waited, tarrying well into the summer before starting off. John could sympathize. The andalusian beaches were lovely. It was hard to leave them even when you knew it was time to go.
Sherlock led John through a nearby marketplace, past women in dark headscarves and bright stacks of produce, as the liquid sounds of Dari and Pashto washed over them. Sherlock wanted desperately to take John’s hand in his own as they walked, and had to stuff his hands into his pockets to resist the urge. John looked up at him, quirking a little smile, and Sherlock knew he felt the same way. Sherlock sucked in a breath of air perfumed with wood smoke and a muddle of spices, and felt like he’d swallowed some of the morning sun, so warmly did his chest glow.
“Yeah, I wasn’t much older,” John said. “Sherlock, it can’t be helped. We all want what’s best for Bajor, but if someone isn’t fighting, they’re still at risk to be killed or enslaved in a sodding work camp.”
“Yes, well, I think I’ll be going now.” Mycroft stepped over to the back door, rapping it to summon the man in a chauffeur’s uniform who had obviously been waiting in the garden. The servant nodded politely at Sherlock and John before crossing the room on his way to the front.
Sherlock looked up with a smile. “I have a favorite Chinese place. I used to stop by least once a week. They stayed open until 2 am on weekends.”
“Who’s wee?” Sherlock pumped his still slightly hard cock against John’s sensitive entrance. John cried out, huffing a laugh.
“Hey, you don’t have to come to the study group unless you want to,” John spoke quietly, “but we’d really appreciate it if you could make it.”
“Oh, honey, I don’t think I’ve got the right equipment for that,” Irene’s laugh tinkled around them.
Sherlock was panting now, the rhythmic pressure on his cock just enough to keep him on edge, but not enough to tip him over. John used his prehensile toes to tease Sherlock’s foreskin. He began to wiggle the big toe of his other foot, rubbing firmly against Sherlock’s perineum.
“I make my soap over here,” Sherlock led John to the worktop where he mixed the ingredients in large buckets, showing John several finished bars.
“I figured you out in the first five minutes. No. He selected you for me. And now he wants this.” Sherlock stared at the ring in John’s hand, then held the open box in front of John, who turned the ring over in his hand one last time before reluctantly returning it to its holder. Sherlock noticed the hesitation. “John?”
“It is nice work,” Sherlock agreed, “but just . . . .” He pulled his own wand out, and used it to slow the flock of purple birds now careening maniacally around them in a tightening circle. With a flick, he sent them off to a lazy, repeating circuit around the ceiling.
John crumpled, letting his face fall against his mother’s shoulder and gulped back a sob. Right. They could do this. Right.
“Oh, God. I forgot about it.” John grimaced. Truthfully, he’d started writing some poetry for his composition class last night, and the time had completely gotten away from him.
“I’ll lead, watch my feet,” Sherlock said, sliding closer, his hand firmly at John’s back. “You’ll want to mirror me.”
Sherlock picked that moment to appear at John’s side. “I was in luck.” He peered into his bag. “They gave me a break on the strainers even though the sale ended yesterday.” He looked up and spotted Sarah. “Oh, hello.”
Sherlock looked at the chrono strapped to his wrist. Could this party take any longer to reach its longed-for ending? It was bad enough that his mother had forced him to attend the holiday soiree in the first place, but the fact that it was taking up an ENTIRE First Day afternoon that he could have spent doing something worthwhile with John was a wrongness of epic proportions. Sherlock glanced at Molly, truly the only person he could stand to talk to at these gathering, and frowned at what he saw. She was looking across the room as well, but with a decidedly wistful expression marring her face as she worried her lower lip with her front teeth.
Sherlock had almost fallen asleep when a gentle knock and John’s reappearance roused him again. “Oh, you look worlds better already,” John clucked. “Perhaps you’d like your hair washed?”
“You and your boys get what you need?” The facility attendant emerged from his shed to meet them at the gate. He was an older Cardassian man, slightly stooped, his hair shot through with white.
John glanced about, one hand on Sherlock’s back, looking for Sarah and her friends, when Sherlock nudged him, pointing. Sarah was at a small table with two other women, a collection of bar napkins crumpled at her elbow as she sobbed into one in her fist.
“Okay, try to be quiet.” John glanced at Sherlock as he dug a key from a pocket. “I don’t want to wake up Mum if we can help it. This is her one day to have a lie in.”
“Wha . . ?” John roused at the loss of contact as Sherlock sank down, the discarded sheet on the floor cushioning his knees. All questions were forgotten as Sherlock opened his mouth and swallowed down the leaking tip of John’s cock.
“I’m doing a bit of home repair,” Sarah said. “Had a door knob break on me. YouTube assures me it should be easy to put in a new one.” Sarah showed John the package she’d selected.
“Oh, my, look at that, erm, peacocks.” John tried to pretend he hadn’t just nearly leapt out of his skin at the unexpected, but harmless noise.
“Well, that was blatantly unfair.” Sherlock gestured to the screen. “That woman took his ice cream out of the freezer and left it to thaw on the bench!”
John released Sherlock’s hand to kiss his way up his arm, reaching his neck to mouth along the ridge he found there. When he found the sensitive spot beneath Sherlock’s jaw and sucked, Sherlock lost the ability to form words.
“John, I don’t have to accept the position. I could still go to Edinburgh.” Sherlock spoke past the lump in his throat. A job at a small apothecary in Scotland was nothing next to the chance to work with someone of Herr Moser’s caliber, but for John . . .
“John do you need a lift to your physio appointment?” Harry asked over the breakfast table. “I’m working later today. I can drive you in.”
They babbled near nonsense as they rutted together, slick with sweat, and desperate longing. John was near insensate when orgasm rolled over him, the shaking pleasure all rolled up into the smell of dusty curls pressed against his face, and soft skin yielding under his clutching fingers. Sherlock gasped, a high, needy sound, and pumped his release over John’s skin as well. They lay together, entwined, unwilling to separate even to clean up.
“I kept tabs on you. I’m sorry, John.” Sherlock blushed hotly. “I know I had no right to, but I had to know about you.”
“I’m sorry, we don’t have much to offer you in thanks for your kindness.” The younger woman licked her lips, glancing nervously at both soldiers. She smoothed a hand down her faded skirts as her gaze locked with Sherlock’s. “If you would like to step inside for a moment though, I could make you comfortable.”
“Mok'bara.” Sherlock grinned, pocketing the intruder’s weapon. “Been taking classes since I was seven.”
“Oh sorry, don’t let me bother you,” John said, moving past him. “I’m just going out. If Sherlock come back before I do, can you let him know I was looking for him?”
Sherlock blinked, and lowered his glass to find himself presented with a short man with a blond, grey fringe swept back from his not unpleasant face. A scattering of roguish scruff too short to be called an actual beard dusted his cheeks and throat.
“I thought you’d never ask, my wee fishie,” John said. He dragged a pink tongue across his lower lip, and just like that, Sherlock was rock hard.
Sherlock frowned, puzzled, and stepped closer for a better view. Someone shot off a disruptor blast, shattering an outcropping of rock, and a Bajoran head popped up, scrambling back from the smoking hole.
“Yeh, guess we’d better get cracking to keep up with you two.” Dom smiled as he helped himself to scrambled egg.
Gwen returned her grin, tucking her twisted hair back behind her ear. They both look like they rolled out of bed five minutes ago, and just remembered that organic chemistry class even existed. Irene leaned in to drop a quick peck to her girlfriend’s upturned lips and it made John smile just looking at them. How sweet to be involved in something so uncomplicated.
“Oh, of course.” Sherlock couldn’t stop the bitter disappointment that trickled through him when he realized that John was off to make a porn video. Somehow he had come to separate the sexy Omega on the vids he watched alone at night, and the funny, intelligent man he’d been having an on-going conversation with for the better part of a week.
“I liked him,” John said after a minute. “I didn’t think I would and then . . . well, he sort of grows on you, yeah?”
Mycroft sat for a moment, contemplating the play of the water falling from the fountain. “It might interest you to know that I’ve managed to locate the whereabouts of a certain Watson Harriet.”
“Yeah, come one, mate, we’re tired of your sad mug. Go see your boyfriend already,” Teddy  chimed in.
“I think so.” A very confused Mrs. Kent allowed herself to be pulled to sitting. “But I saw, I know I saw . . . I must be going mad . . .”
“Why you . . .” The lean one with the scar leapt forward. Sherlock quickly sidestepped, grabbing the man to lead him to the ground using his own momentum. The tall man snarled and reared back to throw a punch when John whirled in between them looking madder than a wet Hara cat.
“Yeah, I guess so,” John mused, and stepped even closer. “Happy Birthday by the way. I got you something.”
Someone began singing a traditional song, and others picked it up as a group of drummers joined in. People drifted over to move around the flames, stamping their feet and throwing their hands into the air, grinning and laughing. The rhythm of the drums and the dancers surged over them all, connecting them, performers and watchers, one and the same celebrating together tonight.
“Holmes, Holmes. I know I’ve heard that name before. You’ve a relative in the Obsidian Order, don’t you?” Dukat’s sharp gaze bore down on him as he squeezed Sherlock’s hand.
Sherlock was pulled from his churning thoughts by a sudden noise, something like a muffled drum beat, coming from nearby.
“Oh, in that case, I’ll need a better good-bye than that.” Sherlock dropped his paper to push back from the table. Turning, he pulled John over to tumble into his lap.
“Were we ever that obvious?” John asked watching as Naavi and the young woman bent heads to murmur together.
John typed the code into the keypad, and the door slid open with a quiet hiss. He and Sherlock stepped through it into a room filled with file boxes. Sherlock’s eyes lit up as he lifted the lid on the nearest one.
“But why? Mona always seemed so nice.” John moved to a nearby chair, sinking heavily to the cushions.
“Well, isn’t that something.”  John marveled at how its little legs worked to keep up with them. “Those are terribly expensive, aren’t they?”
“Hey guys!” John felt inexplicably nervous standing there with Sherlock at his side. They both had the dopiest grins across their faces.
Sherlock flashed John a taut smile, and then he was off, stalking out the door, leaving John alone with sizzling teriyaki chicken on the screen, and an ache clear down to his bones.
“I’m glad. You deserve to be better, John. You deserve everything. I have to admit . . .” Sherlock cleared his throat gone suddenly clogged. “I was on my third overdose when Mycroft had me sectioned this time.”
“Oh, John, how are you holding up?” Sherlock’s mother appeared with her husband toward the end of things.
“Whew.” John glanced about, grateful to reach their destination without any major mishap. Sadly, it looked extra shabby after seeing the grandeur of the Holmes manor only minutes before. John glanced over at Sherlock though, and saw how relieved he looked to be away from it all. John flashed him what he hoped was a soothing smile.
After bundling up, John and Sherlock activated the dual retinal scanners that released the lock on the front door. As they stepped out into the night, Sherlock took John’s hand. They set off together, following the route they’d taken a week before.
It wasn’t hard. Sherlock got on the net, and sifted through the records until he found the ownership entry for the farm. John’s grandmother was still listed as the nominal owner for the property.  John got a bit teary-eyed just seeing her name on the screen, but sniffed it away.
John pressed Sherlock’s knee before choosing his next block. He froze as he saw what it said. “Oh, no. This is one I wrote. It was supposed to be for you.”
Mike opened a door, and motioned John to go before him. John stepped forward, glancing about at the glassware, the potions in progress and the Wizard in a dark robe in the centre bent over a bowl, intent on the green drips falling from the pipette in his hand.  Through a glass window, John could see a second room with more potions bubbling away and a few people moving around. John glanced back at the stranger in the room, and stopped breathing.
“Results inconclusive,” Sherlock gritted out. “Must continue treatment . . . to  . . . confirm . . . oh God.”
“John, you might want to add the crushed barley first,”  Alastaire whispered to John at the supplies cabinet later.
Sherlock looked simply edible, the silky dressing gown sliding off one of his broad shoulders, and John couldn’t help pulling him into another long, searing kiss. After licking the taste of the wine from each other’s mouths, they left the tidying up for later, racing upstairs for another delightful round of coaxing pleasure from each other’s bodies.
“Oi, wanker, that one's mine,” Owen called over as Teddy made to pitch a stack of magazines into his open trunk.
He had slightly sour breath, and the barest trace of stubble marring the pristine white of his jaw. His hair looked something like a bird’s nest taken half apart in the wind. He was so close John could see himself reflected in Sherlock’s eyes, just a shadow of John in the midst of a wide, blue summer sky. John wanted to kiss the man so badly it hurt. He felt the pull as inevitable as the call of gravity as you jump off a diving board, hanging for just a moment before crashing down into cold water swallowing you whole.
“Look, it’s past curfew. Let’s get our arses inside and debate this later.”  She jerked her head back towards the castle.
“I’m so sorry, my son. We help those in need, but we aren’t authorized to accept . . .” Her eyes slid apologetically toward Sherlock. “ . . . Cardassians here.”
“Don’t come back! The whole farm is surrounded  . . . I don’t know how they found . . .” The transmission broke off.
“I didn’t do anything wrong!” Alastaire protested. “I pulled him from the lake. I saved his damn life!”
“I hate saying good-bye to you,” Sherlock said. “You think I’d be used to it by now. We’ve had so much practice.”
“Sherlock, I didn’t mean to spring this on you.” John curled in on himself, looking wilted. “Kira found me texting you . . .”
“No, no, no. You’re a guest. Stay, amuse yourself.” Sherlock waved his hands to stop John’s progress. “There’s the poolandtheexerciseroomandthegroundandabuffetbreakfastdownstairs . . . I’m sure you’ll be fine.”
They repeated their explorations on the lower level of the maze as well, finding nothing more astounding than some packets of beef jerky, and a small box of dried cherries.
He slicked his fingers, bringing the wet to paint over Sherlock’s entrance, before gathering another cold stripe to quickly slick his own cock. They cried out in unison as John sank in to the hilt, bringing their bodies flush. They moved in accord, soft and slow, trying to get closer, ever closer, as they rocked and moaned, finally picking up the tempo to finish. Sherlock lay open mouthed, and spent, groaning as John grunted out his release.
Sherlock kissed him gently, mindful of his sore mouth, his fingers twisting into the back of John’s thin top.  John shivered against him. Sherlock pulled back. “Are you cold? You must be cold. Computer, raise temperature.”
“I’ve not been here before, it’s quite posh, isn’t it?” John waved an arm at the large ballroom, positively dripping with architectural frippery in every corner.
“Bleeding Prophets! Go fast, but don’t kill us, Lupie!” Furel cried trying to shift his weight off of Sherlock, bracing with his one arm. “It won’t help anything if we crash!”
“Incorrect. You’ve iced your injury immediately following the trauma to reduce inflammation. Now you require heat.” He dropped a small, heavy pillow around John’s foot, tucking it around his ankle to stay in place. The heat radiating off of it was instantly soothing.
“If the occupation had never happened.” Sherlock moved back, pushing up onto one elbow to better see John’s face. “What do you think would have happened to you?”
“No, hang on, I wasn’t finished with it.” John leaned back out of Sherlock’s reach to flip the card over and read the back. “Nope, not Mycroft. It looks like Teddy and Owen sent it. They were told to invite friends and family to this big social thing – the Autumn Ball.”
“To hell with that!” Teddy’s head popped up. “John’s our best beater! The team would FOLD without him next year!” He turned pleading eyes John’s way. “Johnny, tell me it’s not true!”
“More like best behavior, but it brings somewhere idyllic in the country. Are you free next weekend?”
His eyes were even more beautiful in person, a deep, mysterious blue, something like the ocean at twilight framed by luxuriously long gold-tipped eyelashes. Sherlock swallowed deeply, willing his voice to be steady when he spoke.
The image of Mycroft froze as a computerized voice cut in to relay “three months, one week, four days, and twelve hours . . .”
Victor looked away. He pressed a finger to his mouth, tapping his lower lip as if afraid to open it and let something unwanted slip out.
“The upper level greenhouses,” Sherlock blurted out. This late in the day, few would be tending private projects with dinner looming around the corner.
“Great. I mean there’s good and bad days, but the other doctors are great to work with.” John retrieved the bowl. “I like it.” He peeled the plastic cover off the top, balling it up in his hand.
“You know it’s okay to be gay, right? It’s perfectly normal.” John had to say it. Someone had to say it to this poor girl.
The Little Hobbit felt his courage had quite deserted him. He forged ahead down the long, dark tunnel bolstered only by the dwarves’ assurances that surely he was too small to be noticed by the dragon. Sadly, though, they had neglected to think of the dragon’s advanced sense of smell.
“Oh, for the love of God, Harry,” Clara sighed. “There’s garlic toast, Aubergine Parmigiana, and the salad you made. You won’t starve if you skip the spaghetti.”
Something about his opponent pinged his senses, as familiar as the kubaroo song, but Sherlock's attention was caught in defending himself, each moment stretched out shimmering in blood pumping and limbs flying. They seemed locked in a stalemate, neither getting the upper hand, until Sherlock rolled the Bajoran onto his back, knocking his cap away. He was rewarded with a clear view of the man’s face then, and the shock of golden hair that spilled out over the ground. Sherlock's grip went completely slack in shock.  It couldn’t be . . . His attacker pressed his advantage immediately rolling on top, punching him hard in the stomach.
As they pulled on enough clothing to head to the kitchen and make something to keep body and soul together, John imagined he could have floated downstairs instead of merely walking so buoyant did he feel.
“I’ve been with a man before.” John leaned in to press his check to Sherlock’s chest. “It wasn’t anything . . . formal. It was quick. His name was Andrew.”
“It’s only my parents, my sister and me proper at our house, but we have so much extended family, there’s always someone popping round for a visit.” Victoire shrugged.  “I love our house. It’s called Shell Cottage. I’d be gutted if we ever left it.”
“Looks like a real corker coming tonight, mate.” The Cardassian driving the cab commented, peering out his window. “Wouldn’t want to be out in that when it hits.”
The music had changed to another slow song, and Sherlock bowed formally to his cousin as she giggled before launching her in a more complicated version of the waltz he'd taught John earlier. John sipped his whisky enjoying the sight of them. Olivia seemed familiar with the steps, and they whirled about quite gracefully, laughing together.
Molly punched a button, and Sherlock all but dived into the rear of the car, scrambling onto the back-facing seats.
, seemed like a good opener. He’d just have to trust that something good would come to him. John followed the queue of people into the carriage when the doors opened.
Sherlock blinked his eyes open into the gloom of the small room to find John, a nearby warmth, propped up on one arm watching him.
Sherlock squirmed, melting into the cushions as John licked stripes up his rotund abdomen, pushing Sherlock’s shirt even higher to reveal his swollen breast buds.
“Bloody blah blah blah.” Someone muttered nearby and a titter ran through the students around them.  John turned to see who had spoken, and found himself locking gazes with Rhys. They’d been sorted alphabetically to be called onto the stage and Rhys Winters was sat only a Lettice Weller away from him. John was happy to at least have Owen Walker solidly at his other side. John nodded politely over the girl’s head, and Rhys returned it with a jerk of his chin. Christ, John hadn’t handled things with Rhys well at all. He turned back to the front as a round of enthusiastic applause greeted the next speaker.
“Buckwheat pillow,” Sherlock said, straightening. “I pulled a muscle last summer, and Mummy bought it for me. You can either put it in the freezer or microwave it. I found that it helped.”
“Yes, of course.” Sherlock nodded, looking a bit more sure of himself. He snapped off the lamp, and made his way to his side of the bed in the dark.
“Of course.” Mr. Holmes patted his son’s shoulder. “I don’t think it will be a problem. John looks like a fine young man, but I’ll tell him.”
Sherlock idly noted the impact as they crashed into the wall, the sound of broken crockery, and cries of dismay around them barely registering.  A burst of pain blossomed along Sherlock’s cheek. Kira had managed to land a strike with a kick.  Sherlock ignored it as he fended her off, countering with a shove that sent her sprawling back into the room. In an instant she had whirled to face him again, fists flying. Sherlock moved on autopilot, countering, striking. A grunt of pain broke the rhythm when Sherlock’s leg connected with Kira’s knee, and she went down with a cry. In an instant, she was up again, snarling . . .
“Does this seem to be making it better, do you think?” John enjoyed the sight of Sherlock’s swollen glans gliding through his fist.
“We could…take turns. Look, who’s to say this is some big inevitable thing? I got out of Afghanistan alive, you miraculously faked your death. All we’ve been through—we’re not going to be whisked off and stranded by some bloody figures of stone!”
A man with floppy brown hair, a prominent chin, bowtie, tweed jacket, and scuffed boots stepped out of the kitchen munching on a carrot. "Hats." He looked at John and Sherlock thoughtfully, then pointed an accusing finger at Sherlock. "Did you know there are lungs in your refrigerator? I hope you weren't planning on eating them. They give you horrible indigestion." He added, almost as a sidenote to himself, "I am never going back to Pluto," then aloud once more, "Love your landlady! Almost makes me wish I lived in a flat. Almost."
“I told you that you wouldn’t like it. Now, if my calculations are correct…” The Doctor glanced at his watch again. “You should be getting a call soon. Make sure you talk to Arthur Conan Doyle. He’ll be very interested in your stories. Try not to be too…modern with the details. And good luck.”
Jim seized John’s hair, causing John to gasp. He used the opportunity to shove the barrel into John’s mouth. “I
John jolted upright. Everything in the opium den came back to him, and he realized with a heavy sadness that none of it had been a dream, that there was no escaping. He wanted to see where they were going—how far were they from Baker Street? Were they even
burned the heart out of you.” Jim looked irritated, then closed his eyes for a moment, crooning, “Nooo, I didn’t get that quite right before.” He glared at Sherlock’s chest and jabbed a finger at it twice. “It’s still
Sherlock quirked a half smile, then handed Urusla back over to Elton and rubbed his hands together. "What can you tell me about the police box? Is it is his? How does he move it around?"
“Do you get that feeling?” John asked as he pulled away. “That you could just—say whatever you want?”
want me!” Jim’s voice was rising to a manic level now as he seized John legs and shoved them up on Jim’s shoulders, pushing John’s knees against his chest and leaning down to hover his face above John’s, grinning at his tortured expression.
happen.” The Doctor began circling Sherlock. “Where am I in your life? I know it all, from your first case with Dr. Watson to your Final Bow...have you done Reichenbach Falls yet? I really would love to have that explained to me: How
Jim didn’t say anything, but John felt his hand move below the sheets. Jim winced, then raised the knife from the covers and lifted it up above his head, still lying on his stomach. For a brief moment, John thought he was going to plunge the knife into him, but Jim stabbed it into the mattress between their pillows instead. Eyes still on John, he brought his knicked thumb up to his lips. He licked a droplet of blood from the cut. “….Good morning, John.”
The usual mixed feeling of terror, excitement, and a twinge of self-disgust swept over John and he said, breathily, “Yes.”
The Doctor absently stuck his head up the fireplace for a moment. “Bit of soot build-up, nothing hazardous. Now then…the flat upstairs. Has anyone ever lived up there?”
“Well, it’s clearly making you miserable. And taking those pills isn’t going to make anything better, you know.”
But at nights, alone in bed, thoughts of Sherlock would return, either in bad dreams or those dark, quiet spaces before and after sleep, and it was all John could do to keep from breaking down. He maintained his stoic demeanor outside, but inside it felt like Moriarty was already breaking him down, piece by piece.
“Medicine was certainly dodgy,” John said. “Imagine if I were a doctor then! I’d be amazing—decades beyond anyone else. Not that it will ever happen. It won’t.”
there, 1895…only for a few tantalizing minutes. Who was this alien, who dropped into people’s lives, dragged them off somewhere fantastically different, then dumped them back into their ordinary lives minutes later?
Sherlock frowned at him for a moment, then burst out laughing. He declared, “John! Get your coat! We’re going to the British Museum to have a snog!”
“It’s not my fault you date dull women,” Sherlock said, opening the spice cabinet. “Do we have any cumin?”
John felt electricity course through him. He opened his mouth a bit wider, meeting the tip of his tongue with Sherlock’s briefly, then finally kissed him more deeply, letting his tongue explore Sherlock’s mouth, inhaling sharply and grabbing Sherlock’s back a bit tighter. As he came up for air, he breathed, “I missed you. So much.”
“Mmm. Add it to the long list of other things people don’t believe about your life,” Sherlock said, raising an eyebrow.
And indeed, at this moment, Hamish was pursing his lips in a decidedly John Watson way as he thought. “You don’t know what you’re talking about, do you? You probably just wanted to come in here to kiss some more.”
John bit back a laugh. It was ludicrous; a man’s faulty memory, surely. He waited for Sherlock to turn the man away, but Sherlock interlaced his fingers and asked, “How old were you during the Blitz?”
“You both have to meet my favorite professor. He’s really really smart. Come on!” Hamish pulled on his parents’ sleeves, yanking them in the direction of the main hall, where the professors were milling about, having a meet and greet with the parents.
John’s heart leaped. This was his chance. He could take Hamish and leave! But Moriarty’s men might think it was him. Was it worth the risk? John suddenly had vivid images of returning home with Hamish only to discover that Sherlock had already been killed. Or heading off to the school and finding that Hamish had been killed. His stomach lurched.
“J-John—“ Sherlock blindly grabbed behind him for John, grabbing him and pulling him to the door to see.
century’s standards. And I want your son. Hamish has potential. Then again, any spawn of Sherlock’s would, am I right?” He leaned in to take another drag from the hookah as John stared at him, flabbergasted.
John shivered at the cold metal on his face, but stared into Jim’s eyes. He wasn’t going to shoot him, John told himself. He wouldn’t. Then again, what was to stop him? Sherlock would never know.
It’s not worth it, it’s not worth it, Sherlock chanted to himself. He had to detach. He had to be logical. One embarrassing moment for them both was not worth their entire lives. Magnussen was trying to goad them both and it was working. But Sherlock was better than that. John was better than that. They had to be.
They kept a firm grip on each others’ hands as they crept toward the bedroom, John looking forward and Sherlock looking backward to keep his eyes fixed on the angel.
John waited with his pistol tucked in the back of his jacket. When O’Seanassy arrived home, John asked him to take a look at some strange papers he had found in the study. When they entered, John let O’Seanassy go first, wasting no time in shooting him in the back of the head before he could turn around.
John made an almost pained noise and was mortified to feel tears stinging his eyes, he was so happy. He burrowed his head into Sherlock’s shoulder and wrapped his arms around his back, pulling him as close as he could.
To his surprise, Mycroft didn’t question it. He only nodded and said, “If either of you need anything—“ He nodded again, unable to finish his sentence, then stood up. “If that will be all, I’ve got business to tend to. The car will take you back.”
Instead, he heard Molly step closer and lower herself to a sitting position. He irritably opened one eye and turned his head toward where she was kneeling to look at him at eye-level.
Mycroft narrowed his eyes, nodding, and studied his brother’s face. “Those scans John showed me were fake. Obviously. I’m assuming that you have constructed this lie for a good reason, although why you ever thought I wouldn’t notice is beyond me. So, Sherlock, drop the aneurysm charade. Is this
Sherlock shook his head. It was too big of a question to ponder right now. “Well. To Lambeth, then?”
John gripped the arms of Sherlock’s chair, leaning in toward him. “You killed Ruby’s dog! It’s dead, Sherlock!”
. Classic pieces of Victorian-era fiction.” The Doctor thought for a moment, then snapped his fingers. ‘I’ve got a copy lying around the TARDIS. You won’t be able to see the last ones—spoilers. Follow me, I’m parked down the road!”
Sherlock grudgingly bit into the sandwich, sinking onto the sofa. He turned what teh Doctor had said over and over in his mind. “I would say it’s impossible—but we’ve seen that time travel is possible. …Whatever remains, however improbable…must be the truth,” he muttered to himself.
Then came “A Study in Scarlet,” changed dramatically from John’s original story—“But seriously, where did the Mormons come from?”, John had asked incredulously when he’d read it—and Sherlock found himself with a steady stream of clientele coming directly to Baker Street for his help in an assortment of crimes, puzzles, and mysteries.
Sherlock steered John’s cock carefully as he lowered himself, then sat back with a groan that was half pain, half pleasure, John’s entire length inside of him.
Sherlock stared at the angel in bafflement. The Doctor had told them to blink. He’d told them that the angels would take their energy and send them back to the past. Setting aside the absurdity of it all, Sherlock considered it as if it could actually happen.
John watched Sherlock carefully as a strong hatred for the Doctor bubbled up inside of him. Here everything had just been getting so perfect. Sherlock and him, finally together…it wasn’t unfair.
didn’t know about him yet. It might have been a future Doctor who had created the child. As much as Sherlock loathed the Doctor, having puzzles that darted in and out of a chronological time frame was fascinating, and was stretching his brain in a marvelous way. He would have to revise his phrase from “The wheel turns. Nothing is ever new” to “The wheel spins backwards and then jolts off to one side, and nothing is ever what you thought it was.”
“He never told me his name or anything…but I need to know how this is possible. That’s why I’m hiring you,” Duncan finished, swallowing.
“I say whatever I want all the time,” Sherlock pointed out, then added sardonically, “I believe you called that ‘being a dick.’”
The tailor held up a mirror for John to look at himself. He smoothed his hand along the hat's brown brim. “My exact size, Sherlock. Did you measure my skull circumference while I slept, or did you just do an eyeball estimate.”
“You and Hamish need to eat as well,” Sherlock pointed out. “And there’s the matter of paying for Hamish’s school, whenever we find a suitable one.”
And what if he wasn’t wrong? John thought, backing up until the backs of his knees hit the couch. “Why…why do you have to prove it? Why can’t you…take my word for it?” His voice grew lower as Sherlock stepped closer.
“CARDS ARE IN YOUR FAVOR, DARLING!” Jim yelled madly as pounded into him, pulling the gun from John’s mouth and firing a bullet into the ceiling as he climaxed himself.
John glared at him with hatred, and Jim raised an eyebrow at him, looking him over as if assessing him. “Did you successfully find all the creaky bits? Watch out—sometimes my door squeaks if you open it too far.”
John stumbled black, clutching his face, fighting back every urge to swing back at Jim. He finally muttered angrily, “Won’t happen again, boss.”
“You haven’t even heard the best part.” Jim blew the smoke in John’s direction, noting his glassy, drooping eyes. “If you and Hamish come quietly, I’ll spare Sherlock. I’ll leave him alone
“Worth a try,” Sherlock said. “I know pick-pocketing Mr. Doyle isn’t the ideal solution, but we look like a group of nutters in our clothes. No one is going to give you a job if you’re dressed like that, John, no matter how talented you are. Now that we’ve got
“Oh, so we can add ‘comedian’ to the list now? John Watson: Army captain, doctor, bachelor and comedian?”
They leapt apart and hurried down the steps to the living room, where the TARDIS now stood, impossibly, between the fireplace and the sofa.
They both watched the jars shatter on the cobblestones. The glass vials were immediately turned to tiny fragments, trampled by horse hooves and carriage wheels.
“Right,” Sherlock said gravely, meeting John’s eyes, then slowly leaned in to kiss him, grateful for some distraction from all of this.
"You already know that I'm a detective. I was hired to, obviously. You're not the only one who has had run-ins with the…man."
Sherlock never expected his case to zig-zag in an entirely new direction so rapidly as it did the following week, however, when he and John were coming home from a secondary, more straightforward case that Sherlock had taken on.
“Erm…morning,” John said, sliding out of bed and falling into his morning routine of push-ups, wondering whether last night’s vigil was a horrible mistake or a step in the right direction. Jim hadn’t stabbed or strangled him, at the very least.
“No—no he’s not. People who are mad don’t even consider the posiblity that they’re mad. This—OH!” he spun and clapped his hands. “THIS will be fun. Aliens? Mystery boxes? Unaging, bow-tie wearing immortals? Christmas!”
Sherlock helped him unpack when he came back with his few belongings. John would keep his things in his bedroom, to give them both some space, but as he glanced down at his bed, he wondered if he would be sleeping in it very much anymore.
“Oooh, certain academics would be high-fiving right now if they heard that,” the Doctor grinned. “At any rate, what was created was not a clone of
Mycroft studied the spastic lines sprawling over his brother’s brain. “And there’s no treatment?” he said, finally handing it back to John.
Sherlock frowned and grabbed John's hands, stopping them on the second button. He searched John's face and realized that John was serious. He realized with horror exactly what John had gone through for the past year, but swallowed his shock and said gently, “John—I…not like that. This is give and take…I’m not Jim. I don’t want to just…
Sherlock sat on the bed next to John and shrugged off his waistcoat, dropping his tie to the floor. He slowly and hesitantly slid his tongue out to meet John's lips, but doesn't move it farther.
While Sherlock was gone, John and Hamish returned to Mr. Doyle’s apartment, and John began recounting his first time meeting Sherlock, hastily changing a few modern details or leaving them out to let the author fill in the gaps.
He had just done something he’d told himself he never would. He had expected to feel upset with himself, but instead he felt a deep happiness bubbling inside of him. All this time…and it had always been John. It was so blatantly obvious now that he was astounded all of this hadn’t happened before.
He drew out Jim’s mostly-hardened cock and grabbed his balls as he licked along Jim’s length until it was completely hard. He drew away and touched the very tip of his tongue to the top, running patterns along it, teasing before he took the head in his mouth.
would be fascinating! A bivascular system! Who knows what about his biology is different? Examining the genetic code would be wonderful…”
They gave each other a last, parting look, each hoping it communicated what they were unable to say, before Sherlock opened the door and stepped into the hallway to meet John.
There was a tentative knock on the door then, and Mrs. Hudson’s voice called out, “Boys? Mind if I come in?”
Hamish frowned, his mouth popping open. “What—no, I just saw him this morning! He told me goodbye before I went to school…” Hamish looked over at Jim, who had rearranged his face into a sad, pitying expression.
John left for his room, and by the time he’d returned in his pyjamas, Moriarty was in bed with his back facing John. He’d left enough room for John on the other side. John crawled carefully into bed, wondering what on earth Jim was thinking at the moment.
