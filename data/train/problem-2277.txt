"There's a restaurant on the other side of the channel, with a lot of positive reviews. I can take you there. You need a lot of calories now. An intense night can be very exhausting ... John knows something about it," Sherlock muttered, covering his face with a menu card. He didn't see John, who almost ate his own teeth and dug his nails into his hands. John had to take a quick calming breath because he wanted to jump on a friend who clearly referred to his night adventures with Mycroft.
"I agree," he repeated. The sound of disbelief rang in the kitchen. Its author was a younger genius.
When he started working for the government more than twenty-five years earlier, he knew that he would be someone important in the future. He has always had a lot of ambition and intelligence. Intelligence that surpasses the minds of the most intelligent people, commanders, and specialists. He believed in his skills and he was convinced of his superiority. He had confirmation it was true when he spent time with the 'elite', i.e. people convinced of their unquestionable power, position and privileges, and who could be outsmarted and deceived with one well-pronounced sentence. Yes. He knew he was special. He wanted to occupy the most important positions and strengthen his power. But he was not greedy of attention. He knew that real influence and real power was when most people did not know about it. Therefore, he often remained in the shadows, allowing others to take credit for his work. Thanks to this, he could rule not only people who received prizes but also people who gave these prizes to others. He pretended to be someone's subordinate. Even his offices looked ordinary, unlike the offices of people who were in similar positions to him. He bowed and carried out orders from people to whom he gave these orders. Everything to keep up appearances. In this way, year after year he received more important positions until there was no one above him. Then he also took over the position outside the country. He was doing very well. He easily combined work for the homeland and other countries with caring for his younger brother. His life would be perfect if it wasn't for monitoring Sherlock's actions and the problems associated with the golden thing on his finger. A trivial problem that has been growing regularly every year.
John sat down in front of the woman who looked at her phone again, completely ignoring everything that was going on around her. She didn't look very busy, but she didn't look like she was going to talk to him neither. She reached for a cup of coffee on the table from time to time and quickly wrote something on her cell phone. John enjoyed the moment. He was sitting in front of a beautiful woman, he was not forced to make awkward conversations. He didn't even have to pretend that everything was fine. Anthea didn't say a word, yet he felt better with her than in the last two days. He enjoyed a nice and peaceful moment.
"Mr. Holmes will join us soon," she said, making him focus his attention on her again. She didn't look at him and John didn't know if she was relieved or indifferent. But why would Mycroft leave the hotel? Did he want to argue with him again or did he want to apologize? No, it didn't sound like Mycroft. He made no mistakes, so the word 'sorry' did not have a place in his dictionary. But why did he bother going through almost half the city? John didn't know how to react. He wondered if he should prepare for a series of rebuke, sinister glances, and harsh comments. If he could, he would avoid meeting with Mycroft, so he decided to leave the restaurant before the genius joined them. The moment he cleared his throat and grabbed the armrests of the chair, he heard someone's familiar footsteps behind him.
Stoner left him alone in an empty restaurant room. The two waiters who were preparing tables for the next day did not look like they were paying attention to their mysterious conversation. Even the bartender, who was standing behind the counter several feet away and cleaning his glasses, avoided him with his eyes. John sat alone in an empty restaurant. It took him a few minutes before he decided to return to the apartment, as soon as he dared to get up from the table. He walked up the stairs with his eyes fixed on the red carpet, and although he saw his movements, he felt as if he was floating above the ground. He was afraid if he looked up he would see Stoner, who was walking the same way back to his apartment on the second floor. John walked with his head bowed until he finally reached the familiar door. With great relief, he pressed the door handle and blended into the darkness of the room. When he closed the door, he leaned against it with his body. He breathed deeply and only after some time he noticed the bright light coming from an open laptop on the other side of the room. He saw Mycroft, who, despite the very late hour, was concentrating on some work. He barely noticed John.
"I can handle it myself," John interrupted him in a not very pleasant voice. His anger was not directed at his friend, but at a man who had made his life miserable for two last weeks. He was not fooled by the charming smiles, beautiful eyes and impeccable manners of Stoner. "Well, I'm listening. What would force me to accept your decisions?" All the pain after Mycroft's betrayal had passed. Now he wanted a confrontation.
It turned out that Sherlock Holmes was the man Stamford planned to introduce to him this afternoon. He shook his head with a small smirk, unable to believe such a twist of fate. For a moment he wondered where the catch was. Was it all made up? Has someone decided to experiment on him? Was it some part of his superiors' strategy to help him deal with his trauma? What if Holmes was the Ripper? Or his old friend Stamford? Or it will turn out that Holmes is crazy and he collects horse droppings and then organizes them by size and consistency. The thought made him smile under his breath. Keep thinking, Watson.
John was too surprised and grateful to Mycroft to pay attention to the final fragment of the statement, spoken with less enthusiasm and certainty. He expected Mycroft to keep his word, but he didn't think it would happen so soon. He accepted the file with visible relief and looked up at Mycroft. He was surprised when he saw a pleasant smile on his face. "Thank you," he muttered harshly. "I do not know what to say".
"This room reeks of sex."
"Mr Holmes has finally found a faithful dog to follow him," Dr Hooper snorted softly, still standing in the same place. "What sets you apart from others so he lets you do it?"
"Gregory?" Molly was surprised. She blushed slightly, as she used to do when someone showed her more interest not necessarily related to work. "But he has a wife."
"Does it happen to you often?" he asked, opening the door and entering the room.
"What a jerk," Molly snapped. "When he stood and watched, I felt like coming and punching his other eye."
"No, that's not it. It's just ... somehow hard for me to imagine you in a relationship. I mean... not that tried... It's just you and Sherlock are still a mystery to me. I don't know which human behavior you practice... "
John was taking a shower. Cool water ran down his aching body. He kept repeating the scenes from the previous night in his mind. He couldn't believe that Mycroft really made love to him. Genius was his best friend's brother. They were both drunk, okay. But that wasn't a good excuse. They crossed the thin line and reached for the forbidden fruit. They couldn't change it anymore.
"I'm a bit surprised, to be honest. I wanted to meet Mycroft's beloved one from the beginning, but I didn't think I would be able to meet his younger brother too. I have to admit I had to wonder who you are for a moment, because ... I am sorry for ignorance ... but I forgot who you were. Forgive me, but Mycroft's achievements and his talent made me completely forget about your existence. It's nice, two people close to Mycroft's heart get along so well ... but I hope I have not offended you with my words, Sherlock, "he added, pretending his concern. However, he abandoned this false personality when he smiled in that ominous way, making John shiver. Sherlock stood with a clenched jaw. He would say what he thinks about Aaron and his behavior, but he didn't do it because of that damn promise he gave his brother half an hour earlier. The tense atmosphere went on forever.
Hearing Stoner's cheerful tone and feeling his warm hand on his back of the neck, John gave him an evil look. Aaron was usually beaming and he charmed both women, though John could bet poor Molly was more impressed by him than Francesca. An elderly woman knew him for a long time and was aware of his true nature. At that moment John wanted to disappear. Sherlock? Molly? Stoner? What else? He regretted sticking his nose out of the room.
He was immediately surrounded by Mycroft's smell. A delicate and pleasant aroma that strangely suited him a lot. John was getting to know more and more things about him and he loved it. He was so focused on the bottle he didn't even hear the crackling, quick steps, and equally fast knocking on the door. Before he knew it, the other man had already entered the bathroom.
Mycroft needed a few moments to gain courage. It was obvious that this was not a comfortable situation for him. "You read the newspapers, John, right?"
"I did" Mycroft finally looked at his brother. "However, he insisted and announced that he would visit us today."
"Weird people ..." he interjected with an ironic smirk. He had had enough of these games and no specific answers. He grew serious as the stranger froze in place. He could feel the disapproval of the other man's eyes, even though he could not see them at all.
John sighed quietly, gave Stoner one last look and turned to leave.
"It was me."
"Maybe he is afraid of it? It wasn't easy for you too when you had to trust someone".
"Sherlock ...".
He thought it was the voice of Sherlock and Mycroft, but he heard only scraps of sentences and was unable to understand the point of the discussion.
"About what?" John asked. He looked at Aaron and Mycroft.
Yes, it was the voice of his best friend. It looked like, he was arguing with his brother, and Mrs. Hudson decided she will be spying on them. But why?
"Sherlock ..." John tried to stop him but was ignored. After a while, he heard the door slam and then complete silence.

Mycroft sighed. He sat nonchalantly with crossed legs, a glass in his hand and a flower behind his left ear. "Sherlock, are you sure you know what you are doing?"
"Wouldn't it be easier to just go to your place?" Mycroft asked and took the offered alcohol.
"Ah!" this time Sherlock sighed.
John had to admit that both the unusual proposition and the extraordinary persistence of Mycroft made him curious. He wanted to learn more because he rarely got this kind of proposition. Not to mention from someone who could trigger a bomb attack with a single gesture or could change the world order - at least John thought so. He nodded. It was only now that he realized that all this time they were headed towards Baker Street. A few minutes later they stopped right away in front of Mrs. Hudson's apartment. "I thought you wanted to talk," John was surprised and grabbed the door handle. How could they do it peacefully when Sherlock was in the flat?
John didn't get a response from him. Sherlock clearly didn't want to talk about it, so he was silent for some time.
"But now I know more things and I wonder if I should thank Mycroft for that ..." Sherlock said with a smirk. John immediately sensed a change in mood and could not help but smile. He sighed with relief and returned to his previous position.
"John ... I am glad that we can finally talk. I would like to explain the whole situation because last time I could not explain the motives of my proposal. You probably did not fully understand my request ..."
As usual, his friend was looking for answers. Sherlock felt proud that despite so many years he was still able to surprise him with his deductions. "Contrary to appearances, she is strong, her body is in excellent condition. She has muscular arms for such a small posture and scars on three fingers on her right hand from pulling the string. Besides, look at how she moves ...". He knew he had made a mistake. Her firm hips stood out too much from the rest of her body. He guessed and actually was sure what John was looking at. He felt that unpleasant yet familiar feeling of jealousy again. "Archery is her passion. She does it when she has free time from hospital work," he wanted to change the subject, but the note about medical education was not very interesting for John. His friend watched the woman until she disappeared around the corner.
"I don't want to go into details," Mycroft immediately set the limit, cutting off John's hopes. "Besides, I promised him to remain silent and not interfere in your life for the next few days. You have to endure his moods for some time, and then you will do whatever you want."
"Please, listen to me. This is the first and last chance to make a decision. If any of you do not feel right or do not agree to participate in this mission, you can leave. You will not be stopped by anyone. However, those who stay must know that there will be no turning back later. The details you will hear must only stay between us. "
The morning was not as hot as in the last few days and John was happy to hear that for the first time since arrival they will have breakfast on the hotel's observation deck. White clouds covered the sun from time to time, and the breeze rising from the water reached high above the hotel roof. John enjoyed the moment. He sat comfortably in a chair with closed eyes and was listening to the bustle under the hotel and the noise of passing ships. From time to time he could hear the sound of a cup tapping on a small plate.
He managed to catch some movement from under his half-closed eyes. He tilted his head and saw what he thought was the figure of a detective kneeling next to him. He opened his hazy eyes.
"Yes, I know"
"Let me know when you have something. I will wait ..." he whispered and kissed her again. Before she knew it, he got up from the chair and disappeared somewhere behind her. She turned around, but he went into the crowd of tourists. He knew this was only the first point on the plan, but how important it was! Now everything should be easier. Molly was captivated by him, John was confused, and Mycroft lost his confidence and didn't know what he wanted. Now, Aaron just had to wait for the results, so he walked ahead with a confident and cheerful face. He was so pleased and focused on his thoughts, he did not notice John, who passed him in the crowd, going in the opposite direction.
They were walking among the crowd of people. Some of them were tourists, others were residents. They could hear languages from around the world and smell perfumes of many people - rich and poorer ones. There were scents of delicious dishes from nearby cafes. The musicians stood under the restaurants and played enjoyable Italian melodies.
Finally, Lestrade decided to introduce him, although it was obvious that he was hesitant to do so. "This is my old friend Dr John Watson. And this is Mr Sherlock Holmes," he said, gesturing between them with a hand. "I am sorry," he whispered so that the detective would not hear it.
"Then what?" John asked. He was angry and a bit curious. He stood still with his hand on the door handle. Mycroft saw his challenging attitude. He was fed up with this protracted discussion too, and was slowly losing his patience. He got up from the chair and walked over to John.
"See you, Dr. Watson!" Two nurses shouted at once just before leaving the hospital. It was the end of a very difficult day for John. He didn't even have the strength to answer, so he smiled gently, raised his hand and nodded. He wanted to go home and get some rest. He stepped out onto the pavement. Fresh or rather cool London's air surrounded his tired face. However, his peace of mind did not last long. Before the main door slammed, a black, elegant car appeared around the corner. John sighed and lowered his head. For two days, he saw this car almost everywhere. Mycroft tried to contact him and although he had managed to avoid confrontation to this moment, he knew that sooner or later he would have to talk to him.
Mycroft's words made Sherlock open his eyes. He looked at his brother with a raised eyebrow. "Oh?" he said with interest. "And who is it, if I can ask?"
"Can anyone kindly explain to me what this is all about?" John asked with irritation.
"Bears, panthers" Arian enumerated calmly, bending his fingers. "Tigers".
Sherlock winced and made a sound of doubt.
Meanwhile, the doctor sighed softly and got up from the table. "You know, Mycroft ..." he fell silent. He didn't know if he felt sorry for the older genius. He grabbed his belongings and straightened up. "You are too important man to have to convince anyone to anything. Be yourself and don't pretend to be someone you are not. You have the power and respect of many people. You don't need this pathetic lie ... "
"I've learned to be prepared for anything when I am with you." He had already taken off his jacket and vest.
John leaned his back of the head against the back of the seat. "As usual," he sighed. "When I want to know what's going on, you both remain silent. You ignore me and my questions. When I want to help you, you pretend I don't exist," he fell silent and gave Holmes a look full of something that Mycroft couldn't define. "You don't need me," he added quietly.
John looked into his eyes for a moment. They stood in silence and the atmosphere between them became more intimate. Finally, John nodded slightly and walked alongside his pretend husband to the building.
"More like a rough morning," Lestrade cast a glance at the detective who was talking to someone near to one of the autopsy tables. "He made it clear to me," he nodded at Holmes, "that my decision to allow you to join yesterday's patrol was ... unacceptable. You can probably guess he put it in slightly different words," he said, and a tired smile appeared on his lips.
"The cat had two owners, Sherlock" Mycroft corrected him. He didn't seem interested in a cat or anyone else. He focused on the wine he enjoyed that evening. He wasn't sure exactly why, but he didn't complain about it.
"Stoner doesn't know the word 'failure'. Anything he chooses to do, everything he aspires to, is doomed to success. He'll do anything to get what he wants. That's why he's so dangerous. He competes with me at every turn. Stoner is one of those people, who are the mystery. Even I have no idea how to deal with him. I'm most afraid of him becoming interested in Sherlock ... "
He was torn out of his thoughts by a bolt of lightning somewhere in the distance, as well as a strange sound coming from outside the window. Open window. This is what he forgot about when he had this strange feeling a few minutes ago. He focused his hearing on rhythmic and uniform sound. The moment he realized that it was definitely applause, he heard a male voice belonging to one of Mrs. Turner's residents.
Mycroft's words caught John's attention. He finally joined him and took his place on a wooden chair. "But this time you have no choice" he muttered in a kind voice, looking into the eyes of an older man. "If there is a slight chance that it will succeed, then you have to try to trust me and let me act on my own. You can't control everything and everyone, Mycroft. Look at me and promise from now on you will try to stop with this whole spying on me".
"Summon all your senses."
"Maybe more, John?" Mrs. Coletti asked him with obvious concern in her voice, pointing to a tray with food.
John was full of anger. Because of Mycroft, himself and the whole sick situation, he got involved in because he had not thought about the consequences before. That was the truth. Yes, before he made the decision - to pretend to be Mycroft's husband - he tried to analyze all the pros and cons, but he did not do it seriously enough to avoid similar situations. He did not consider all the possibilities and effects of his actions. He was naive. But how could he suppose this whole thing would get so unhealthy and confusing? How could he know that one innocent kiss with Mycroft would lead to such problems? Later, one thing led to another one and everything started to fall apart. His relationship with Mycroft became tense, Sherlock started to behave strangely. And this stress caused by lies. This was too much for less than two weeks. Everything was going too fast and too intense. He knew he had made a mistake when he agreed to Mycroft's offer. The Holmes brothers were beyond control. John would be able to control them if he had to deal with only one of them at a time. But he was surrounded by two Holmes in a small building and this resulted in an imminent disaster. He had always treated Sherlock like his best friend, but now he had to be careful and guess the reasons for his strange behavior. He never had a strong bond with Mycroft, but he couldn't pretend that nothing had happened between them. His relationship with Mycroft was closer now than he might have thought. The thought of what would happen after returning to London terrified him, but at the moment it didn't matter. Mycroft's attitude towards anything was radically different from John's. But, even if they could agree on one thing, John doubted they would be able to agree on more important matters. He had to let go of this urge of fixing the character and habits of the older man. Now the most important thing was to find out why his best friend was acting so strange. And Sherlock really wasn't himself lately ...
"I have to find something," said Mycroft, looking at them. He cleared his throat and straightened his matted hair. "I will be right back".
He froze, his voice stuck in his throat. He looked at the man who caught his greatest interest from the very beginning. The man was watching John closely. John shuddered when he heard his voice. Sherlock was angry. Not only because the stranger was the first person to support John with his decision. He was furious at the fact that he caused such emotions. Negative emotions. John tried to hold on, but his pale face betrayed his nervousness, although he certainly expected that this would be the decision of the other man.
John turned his head, trying not to look at the pleased face of the older man. He had to surrender to him and although he would have a chance to defeat him, he preferred to let him take control this time. He focused on pleasure and Mycroft's efforts. He didn't stop his moans when he felt the brushes on his sensitive places. However, when the warm hand slid down to his groin, he opened his eyes and tensed his body. Mycroft noticed his hesitation. He stopped moving and raised his head. He watched John's reaction for a moment. His accelerated breathing, red skin, and trembling body.
Only now a slight relaxation broke into the corners of his mouth. He looked like he was smiling. "Watson ..." he said softly, leaving even more fog on the glass. "One thing is to correctly name the murderer and another to prove him his murder and gather compelling evidence of his guilt. Unfortunately, our law frees criminals too easily, so to catch him, we need something that will unquestionably connect him to the crime scene and murder".
John knew that tone. He had lived with Sherlock for too many years and he was sure that something must have upset Mycroft because he rarely behaved in such a depressing way. However, this did not discourage him. He was motivated to talk to him longer.
He did not keep up with what was happening. Generally speaking, the entire last 24 hours had been one of the odd ones, and it wasn't clear how to react and prevent things from happening. He was fed up with these nonsense and incomprehensible situations. All he thought was Holmes and their upcoming meeting. He walked to the door, noticing his wavering steps. The door indeed turned out to be unlocked because it was enough for him to turn the handle to make it open noiselessly. The interior was dark. He glanced down the narrow corridor, but some force called him to the upper floor. He had no idea how many people were in the building and whether he would be considered a burglar. He placed his foot carefully on the first step and then on the second one. He was slowly climbing up. One of the two doors was slightly ajar, and the light illuminated the stuffy corridor. He peered through the chink, ready to inform the residents about his presence by knocking on the doorframe. His hand hung in the air as he saw a familiar face in the bright room.
"Prostitutes know a lot of places where they may take their clients to," Lestrade walked forward with a firm step. "Fortunately for them, people living in those houses rarely lock their doors, which means ..." he fell silent, standing right on the threshold.
A strange feeling pulled him out of his thoughts. He tensed his body, ready to defend himself. He clenched his hand on the wooden handle of the umbrella, he hung on an elegant armchair. Before he realized that the burglar had the advantage of time, he managed to look around the room. He never turned on the light when he came home. A figure standing near the window caught his attention. Unfortunately, the moon glowed on the other side of the sky, so the shapes of this person were blurred. He was angry at his nonchalant behavior. He never had problems with people who could try to break into his house before, but he was always careful. Instead of thinking of John, he should focus his attention on the slightly twisted rug in the hall. He could tell someone was at home when he noticed the glasses strangely set on the table next to the fireplace. He could finally smell the strange scent that was in the air and trust his intuition when he thought of someone else's presence. But before he turned his body toward the mysterious person and before he prepared the tip of the umbrella for his defense, he heard a familiar voice.
"John ... ".
In the distance, at the end of the street, he could see a light. This lantern was his stop. He knew that if he was lucky he would meet an officer there, and a friendly conversation would certainly cheer him up for the last half hour of his patrol. He walked towards the lantern with a calmer pace and a lighter heart. The dark shapes of the buildings and the silence did not seem as terrifying to him as it had been a moment before. He was passing the gate to Dutfield's Yard when he heard a splash. The sound was completely out of place, which immediately caught his attention. He stopped and looked down. There was a strange black puddle of irregular shape on the sidewalk. He frowned and lifted his leg. Black liquid dripped from the sole of his shoe onto the pavement. He followed the thin trickle of liquid that led to the inside of the gate. He couldn't hold back his curiosity. He raised the lantern in front of him and took a few steps inside the dark passage. The line of liquid widened. Eventually, it turned into a huge puddle. There was something on the ground ... a woman.
Holmes pushed the tip of his tongue between his lips. He licked the blood off his lower lip, relieving the burning sensation and pain he had caused.
"Nobody wants that," he finally said, slightly relieved. "And everyone has the right to fear it. Especially if the death is not natural."
He extended his hand slowly, ignoring her nervous twitch. "I know how difficult it is to follow what we love. But it's not worth giving up who we really are." He touched a tuft of unglued moustache, lightly pressing it against her skin. He could barely contain himself from smiling at the shocked expression on her face. "Someone recently gave me advice that I can't get over my head ...", he leaned down and, taking his hand away, ran his fingers over her hot cheek, "...To thine own self be true."
"John ..." Mycroft interrupted him in a very calm but imperious tone. He smiled in that artificial way that was meant to make him understand, from now on his words would be saturated with sarcasm. "... I am extremely pleased, you care about our success and you try to help me. I appreciate it. But ..." he lowered his voice, wanting to add a more serious and darker effect to his next words. "Bishop's goal is to check the King. And you, John, you are a pawn, a point on the chessboard, which sooner or later becomes redundant. Pawn is not the goal of the game. It's not my intention to offend you by saying this. All I mean is you are the means to the goal, and this goal for Stoner and his intrigues is me. I told from the beginning you should not to focus on anything else but playing your role. You are doing very well, so do it for a few more days, and leave me the rest. Aaron Stoner will soon lose interest in you and you won't have to think about him anymore".
Sherlock shrugged as if it didn't matter to him at all. And of course, it didn't. It was Mycroft's place after all, and if he had the opportunity, he wanted to irritate his pedantic brother a little. "If it bothers him that much, he can sleep on the couch. You should be okay with that," he added with a small smile.
"It would be such a shame to close my eyes when I see something like that. All these buildings seem so small and cute ..."
"I don't have condoms," he said.
Holmes' smile assured him that he had a strong bond with his landlady. He enjoyed watching their conversation and sincerely hoped that soon he would also have a chance to strengthen the relationship with the two of them. Once they were alone, he looked around the living room. He could feel the detective's eyes staring at him. However, it ceased to bother him a long time ago. He enjoyed his attention, controlling the reactions of his body better and better. He was looking around until his attention was caught by the piles of paper lying on the table in the other room. He walked over, examining the strange black spots and notes.
"Has anyone been lucky enough to win your trust enough that you don't check every step of their action and give them a free hand, even in the least important matter?"
Somehow he managed to get out of the maze of streets. He sighed with relief when he saw familiar buildings and the main canal. But he was most pleased when he saw other people. He knew Sherlock would hardly dare to do something stupid in front of all these tourists. He realized his friend spoke to him this whole time. He was too shocked and busy with his thoughts to pay attention to Sherlock muttering something behind him. When he finally stopped in the middle of the promenade to find out which direction their hotel was in, he felt a strong grip on his shoulders. He saw the face of younger Holmes, who was looking at him with an annoyed face.
"What about this one?" Holmes asked.
As he thought about which colors suited the Holmes brothers, John was surprised by the quiet creaking of the door. He turned and saw Molly coming out of the bedroom she shared with Sherlock. She looked ... different than usual. Her hair was loose, tousled and disheveled. She grinned but quickly bit her lower lip when she saw him. She tried to pull the shirt - obviously not hers - on her bare legs. She looked very pleased and relaxed. If John were to guess why the girl was so happy, he would bet she had ...
The doctor began listing the victim's injuries, jotting down his observations in a notebook. "... parallel with each other and separated by about half an inch. It appears the killer tried to separate the muscles from the bones in the neck. The murderer cut open the abdomen, removed the intestines, and placed them on the victim's right shoulder. Also, the uterus and the top of the vagina, and two-thirds of the bladder had been entire removed. This is the work of an expert. A person with excellent knowledge of anatomy. From the temperature of the corpse, I conclude that the murder took place before four-thirty in the morning ... "he continued his observations until he wrote down everything that was most important to him. The confidence with which he did so left no doubt about his experience. He looked at his notes, marking the most important information.
"How will we know which room is his?" John asked.
The detective slowed down, straightening up and staring straight ahead.
Holmes sighed. "My brother will never stop behaving strangely. At least by your standards." He wiped his face with a towel and put the razor down in an elegant men's washbag that John had never seen before. It was brown with a golden zipper in the middle. Mycroft's long fingers fit in perfectly. "I mentioned Francesca because she called me a moment ago and offered to change the meeting time for the afternoon."
"My dear Mycroft, it's really a shame you didn't taken John with you before. He missed so much."
"Yes". Sherlock pulled a silver USB memory stick out of his pocket. He put it on the table with a happy face.
"Hurry up," John replied desperately into Sherlock's shoulder. He knew he had been heard because he immediately felt Mycroft's finger inside him. "Umm ..." he groaned, clenching and pushing forward.
Holmes was silent and he stared at him curiously.
John's thoughts were interrupted by Mycroft's cell phone, which started to ring and vibrate on the desk next to the closed laptop. John frowned and walked quickly to the table because the sound seemed terribly loud in this quiet and still dark room. He never intended to investigate what his fake husband was doing, but he picked up the phone and rejected the call.
His arms and back were wrapped in Sherlock's long and warm hands. He didn't hesitate too long. When the shock passed, he embraced his friend's waist and buried his nose in his slightly sweaty shirt. A pleasant smell surrounded him. The smell he had associated with home on Baker Street. He knew that no other would ever be able to compete with it. The smell of tobacco, dust, gunpowder, and tea, soaked Sherlock's clothes. He smelled it even after being sprayed with cologne, which in some ways reminded him of the smell of Mycroft. He wasn't going to talk about it though. He did not want to destroy and interrupt one of the few and unusual behaviors of his friend. They stood cuddled up to each other until they heard the voice of a satisfied Molly, who cheerfully discussed in English with the saleswoman.
"I give her time to forget about the potential danger. I want to surprise her and see the terror in her eyes. I'm waiting. I am slowly getting ready to attack. I look forward to the opportunity and finally my fingers tighten on her mouth and nose while my other hand rests the back of her head."
It made Sherlock look serious again. "You can be sure I know."
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Sherlock tried to ignore John's frightened face. He wanted to shout and hit something because the awareness that his two-year mission - which had caused John so much pain - was not over, made him furious. How long will Moriarty mess up his plans? How long will he threaten their lives? He tried so hard to keep John safe and yet he fell. He didn't do the job, and now he had to face the consequences. He couldn't look at John's frightened eyes. He felt he had let him down, so he looked away at his brother. "I found and liquidated his every hideout, every related organization. It took me two years to track down his associates. Are you saying that I could have missed something?" he asked with a slight threat and reproach.
"And I want to apologize for all the malicious things I said. I didn't want it to sound like that. And that punch ..."
"Mr. Watson, I understand you are worried about your partner, but his presence is necessary. We can't deal with this situation without him. And we all have to ..."
Their life has been calm over the past few months. Nothing happened. Even the investigations didn't give Sherlock as much fun as ever. All because he was thinking about John. Intensively. He thought about telling him about his feelings. How much he wanted his touch, his warmth. How much he wanted to have him in his arms. He noticed that since their lives had returned to normal after all these events, he was looking at John more boldly and he wondered more often if it was time to finally tell him how he felt. Maybe it was the perfect moment? They lived together again. They lived side by side. They ate, laughed, and talked as usual, without stress or worry. Their everyday life was calm. Several times he had a feeling he should do it. He stood in front of John, looked into his eyes, and was ready to confess his feelings, but John avoided him as if he knew what was going to happen, or the intensity of his gaze frightened him. As he walked away with a nervous smile, Sherlock wanted to grab him by the shoulders and make him listen. But he didn't do it. He didn't want to do it this way. He remembered the movies they were watching, and even several times he thought about recreating one of the romantic scenes. But he was afraid that John would think of it as some kind of experiment or joke, and for that reason, Sherlock would back down. He understood that the most important thing was honesty. Romantic surroundings were supposed to be just an addition. Sherlock knew that he had to confess John his feelings naturally and above all - honestly. He didn't need artificial romanticism, a dozen candles, and a quiet melody in the background, but for John, he was ready for anything. If that would help him understand how much he meant to him, he could even kneel before him and ...
"My John..."
Molly sighed with irritation in her voice. "I'm so sorry. It's my fault," she said. "I let him take advantage of me and he wrapped me around his finger." She was angry with herself. So many times she promised herself that she would never let anyone manipulate her again, and yet she always succumbed to dominant eyes and beautiful words.
"When I see that cold look of his, I even don't want to offer him my tea," Mrs Hudson bustled around the room, piling the scattered books.
"We're going to sleep, Mycroft," he said calmly. However, the older man sensed army remnants in his voice. John had to use this tone to give orders.
John was fully aware of their presence, despite the fact, Sherlock just mumbled a few sentences since they left the hotel. Molly's delighted sighs were proof, she was completely enchanted by the surroundings and Francesca's stories. He didn't look back often, but he felt his friend's eyes on him. A hot, piercing stare never left him. It didn't change even when they all stopped and focused on a building or sculpture. John was convinced Sherlock watched him intensively. But this was not the only strange thing in his behavior. Sherlock entered his personal space, sometimes he deliberately nudged John or murmured something in his ear. When John gave him a withering and confused look, Sherlock pretended he had no idea why he looked at him in surprise.
John was glad when the grip on his chest eased. He was sure his body would be all strong and sore in the next day. He was slowly regaining the ability to think soberly. As Mycroft pulled his penis out of him, he collapsed on the bed, face down. The older genius settled down right behind him. He was totally exhausted like the other two. They lay side by side for a long moment, breathing heavily and trying to regain consciousness and balance. The smell of sex and sweat filled the room. The sheets were sticky with sperm and other secretions. John's heart rate calmed down until he felt a familiar mouth between his shoulders. Mycroft kissed him gently and warmed him with his hot breath. It was so enjoyable that he wanted to close his eyes and plunge into pleasure. He didn't do it, because Sherlock sat on the bed, carefully turned him over on his back, and settled himself between his legs. He was surprised because his friend didn't seem to show any signs that this one time was enough for him. John groaned softly as Sherlock sucked on his sensitive body, running greedy hands over his arms, stomach, legs, and wherever he could.
"Yes, you are a coward. At least compared to Mycroft. Do you know why I think so? Because unlike my husband, you are afraid to face your feelings. You are afraid it will take control over you and you will start to care. Mycroft allowed it, he connected his intelligence with emotions. He allowed himself to love me. I know a little bit about the minds of geniuses ... I'm not saying that I know their thoughts, but I know how they work. Believe me, this kind of mixture is incredibly exciting and dangerous. Connecting love and cold approaches to other things. Being with me, Mycroft got to know things he didn't know existed. Every day is like an exciting fight for him, but I doubt he regrets it. Mycroft took this risk and fell in love ... You would not be able to do it because you are too afraid of feelings and love ...
Before the receptionist came out from behind the counter, he reached his hand toward the wall with the keys, decorated with long red tassels. There were two hooks under each room number - key for guest and spare key. He brushed one of them with his fingers, then stopped and moved on to the next pair. His eyes fell on the woman who appeared next to him with a small booklet 'Italian phrasebook', that's why he didn't notice satisfaction on her companion's face, who of course noticed his little mistake.
John looked at Mycroft. His stomach tightened and he felt sick. A lot of extreme emotions must have dominated his eyes because the older genius could barely hold his gaze. John got up from the couch. He stood in a defensive position, i.e. arms crossed, and narrowed his eyes. "And how do you want to prove to me that I have no other choice?" John asked with hoarseness in his voice.
At this point, Holmes quickly turned his head and spoke a few sentences directly into the ear of the other man, who did not change position or look away for a moment. Wrinkles appeared at the corner of the stranger's eyes as he smiled slightly. The detective's body was tense and his hands tightly clenched behind his back. When he turned and started walking towards the exit, his shapely lips formed a thin line now, and his narrowed eyes were covered by the gloomy shadow of his cylinder.
"Let's go home. We will be able to do whatever we want there", seeing the indecision in the detective's eyes, he grabbed his lower lip between his in a few seconds' kiss. "I will do whatever you suggest."
Meanwhile, John didn't know why, but he didn't like him. Perhaps it was because he saw Mycroft's face and Aaron's wily mannerisms. After all, he played with Mycroft in one team and did not want to let anyone interrupt them in the win. He turned his face toward his husband, leaned forward gently and murmured calmly into his ear. "Let's go back to the room ..."
"What is it, Mrs. Hudson? Have you again forgotten something here that can't wait until morning?" He was well aware that she was spying on them. She also had to sense the change that was happening in the flat, because she looked genuinely interested in their relationship. She visited them disturbingly often. She let him know that she had enough of waiting for one of them to take the first step. All her efforts, however, had cons. She didn't leave them alone and interrupted the moments that Sherlock planned to spend showing John his true thoughts and feelings. He watched his landlady, who cheerfully entered their living room with a bundle of letters in her hands.
"Evening, Mycroft. Sherlock is ..."
After a few minutes, Mr. and Mrs. Coletti left after a small nod. Passing through the room, John met more new people. He knew some of them from television and newspapers and he still couldn't get over Mycroft. Holmes knew them by name, but it looked as if they felt honor looking at Mycroft. John felt he was the object of their interest too. They finally got the opportunity to meet Mycroft's husband. The mysterious husband Mycroft tried to hide for so many years. Some people approached them with smiles, others watched them from distant.
"John, please, call me by my name. I have asked you so many times," Aaron replied.
"Seer or what?" she asked. She looked at them with confusion, but after a while, she understood who she was dealing with. "Wait ... You're the detective. What was your name? Holmes?" She mused, "Was it you who faked your death and fooled everyone?" Her expression changed. She cheered up. "Ha! You're a rascal. Your loved ones must have nerves of steel." She looked at John. "I feel sorry for you ". She didn't allow any of them to answer. She threw a thick braid off her shoulder. "I'm leaving now. Maybe I can find something stronger than the juices and water they propose here." She turned and walked deeper into the hall without saying goodbye.
Sherlock gave him a quick look too, then took a deep breath with the cigarette and let the smoke out into the sky very slowly, closing his eyes. "Not Mycroft. He's cold as a fish."
1. Do you prefer Johnlock, Johncroft or Johnbastian? Or maybe John with someone else?
"You don't say," Mycroft said with obvious amusement and a smile. "Dream on, Sherlock ... You forgot everything I taught you. You can dictate to other people what they should feel, but in the end, it's their own decision. You won't always be able to control their thoughts and feelings, you can only manage it what they think at the moment. It doesn't work in the long run. And if you hadn't noticed, John is not as simple as it may seem and sometimes he behaves completely incomprehensibly by our standards. Of course, I don't even mention the fact you - as his friend - should not manipulate him like that".
"What do you mean?" he asked completely confused.
When Sherlock approached her, she held his face with her hand and gently brushed her lips against his cheek, trying not to leave marks. John may have been surprised by her gesture, but his shock didn't last long. After all, Francesca and Mycroft knew each other very well. John could even say Mycroft liked her, and he certainly respected her. That's why it was obvious Sherlock was no stranger to her. John saw an honest smile on friend's face.
Do you have sex? John couldn't ask him that. But he had to admit that he was interested in this side of Mycroft. It was good to know that he wasn't as distant and cool as he wanted to be. He had to admit that he liked the idea of discovering the real side of older Holmes more and more.
"But I admit you are right at some points," Sherlock added with a smirk on his face. John was surprised and looked at a friend who was sitting cross-legged next to him with his eyes fixed on the passing boats and people talking on the shore of the canal.
"But I'm not Sherlock!"
John was sure his friend had a small smile on his face. He knew his guesses were true when Sherlock spoke up. "That's right," he replied in a slightly amused tone.
"Yes," he replied. "Organize our things, pack, and get back to hard work from tomorrow."
"What's wrong?" he asked without changing his position.
"Forgive me for not being able to finish it right. That I'm putting you in danger again." He seemed to lose all his strength and courage because he made a move as if he wanted to lower his head and look at the ground. He didn't do it just because John's eyes didn't let him. "This time I know I need you. I don't want to make the same mistake. I know that I can't make it without your help."
"Places of murders, John!" he didn't even try to hide his excitement. "In the seventeenth century, there were two serial killers who had more creativity than today's degenerates who have access to so many technologies! Can you imagine it? Two serial killers in such a small city? And they acted only a dozen or so years apart." Sherlock started walking around the room. He ignored or missed the glances the other three were giving him. Molly wasn't delighted, rather worried. Mycroft rolled his eyes, only John felt a shiver at the thought of a small walk to the crime scene. "We have to see this," he added excitedly.
"As soon as possible"
"Look at them. Gondolier helper and supporting actress from a nearby theater ..."
"You didn't have a moustache before?"
"... until I can be sure that Moriarty does not threaten us. I made a mistake and now we have to deal with it again." He gathered enough courage to look up and finally look him in the eye. "Forgive me".
"I'm wrong? This is your goal. You want to destroy Mycroft's reputation"
"Your premonitions are correct as usual," Sherlock gave him a warm smile. They walked on, did not stop or look back.
"Don't get so angry, it's not good for your nerves, Lestrade." Holmes did not care about the inspector's irritation. He knelt beside the corpse and pulled a magnifying glass from his pocket. "This is not the first and not the last murdered prostitute we will find."
"I didn't know you were so sentimental," John said as they looked at each other.
"What is the matter, John?"
A touch of rough wallpaper, masking the architect's shortcomings. Creaking stairs. An increasingly intense chemical smell coming from the kitchen. A quick, blinding light from a lamp that does not match the length and size of the narrow hall. A breath of stuffy, but unexpectedly pleasant air, after a wider opening the last door. Sherlock's annoyed look. The loud sound of closing the book, which he probably read for the good of the upcoming experiment. A mannequin lying on the ground with strangely bent arms. Needle tips scattered around. The sound of a squeaky armchair and creaking skin. A silent invitation to talk, full of sharp looks and controlled movements of his fingers.
"God, John ... I'm so sorry. I'm so stupid that I let him convince me and I betrayed your trust. But he urged me!"
However it was, John did not comment on Molly's words. But he was more and more tired of the thought that both brothers always did what they wanted and treated other people as they wanted, regardless of their feelings. Both Sherlock and Mycroft used other people. They manipulated their emotions and feelings to reach their goals. Maybe it was easy with Molly. She was awkward and easy to manipulate. But John wasn't going to let them treat him that way. He was not a clumsy fool. He managed to learn how both brothers worked. He decided not to change his mind and see what effects it would bring.
John felt his fingers were numb and cold. Stress gave way to adrenaline and a strange euphoria that took control of his body in dangerous situations. He stood up like the rest of his group and approached the rear of the shaking military helicopter. The sound of propellers, the noise of engines, and loud orders given by the commanding soldier reminded him of the days spent in Afghanistan. About missions and danger. Everything was the same. Everything but one. At the moment he was surrounded by laymen, rather than veterans, for whom the jump from the machine hanging above the ground was a trivial matter. It was dark, but he turned to look at their terrified faces. Lucy and Josh were adjusting their backpacks, trying to focus on something other than what was waiting outside. Arian was chewing something and scratching his shoulder, and Sebastian ... as always, did not take his eyes off him. He stood close. Through thick layers of clothing, John could feel his warmth on his back. However, it wasn't Moran who was his biggest concern. It was Sherlock. He was standing a few feet away. His proud attitude and calm breathing, however, could not deceive John. He knew his friend too well and knew that in this way he masked his uncertainty and stress. He couldn't read his face, because his glasses and mask stretched almost to the very base of his nose prevented him from doing so. Anyway, the darkness and uncontrolled movements of the machine prevented him from looking closely at anyone.
"What photo?" John asked.
John glanced at his lower lip for a split second, but he immediately controlled himself and gave him a sharper look. "If it's some bet or fun between you and Sherlock ...".
Mycroft and John looked at her immediately. The genius sighed, and the doctor visibly tried to hide his embarrassment, once again covering his eyes with his hand.
Sherlock didn't turn around, but John could see his smile in the reflection of the window. After a moment, without a word, he closed the door behind him. Leaving the apartment, he noticed a black car next to the sidewalk. He went inside and was surprised that Mycroft wasn't there.
It was getting warmer and stuffy under the pillow. John tossed it aside and felt a pleasant chill on his face. At the same time, someone left the bathroom.
John smiled. "Josh knows many languages and we count on his help, but what if something happens to him? What if he loses his voice for some reason? Or hearing?" He did not mention Sherlock's ability to learn languages quickly and effectively consciously. He knew that sometimes it was worth not mentioning a fact, especially since others did not need to know about it.
"Holmes"
Sherlock watched him with a smile. In fact, he carried out his last experiments mostly out of boredom, not for the sake of some investigation. His thoughts were all focused on John, so he didn't even want to think about cases. Thinking about John was much more pleasant and grateful because he could imagine something different every time.
Hm. It didn't sound right either. Maybe -
"I talked to the manager about changing the room this morning. He offered us this apartment because it has two separate bedrooms," he said, without taking his eyes off the bustle.
The saleswoman was already starting to arrange a bouquet of white daisies from the amount John showed her on his fingers. "I could take roses," he said, not looking away from the woman's slick hand. "But I like them better." He heard the soft murmur of a friend who was standing behind him. He saw him talk for a moment with the girl who had left the back room.
At one point he felt a pleasant scent. He didn't even have to turn his head to know who had entered the room.
"Mycroft, what have you done to John?" he asked with a frown and a slight amusement.
Sherlock smiled wryly. "Relax, Mycroft. I can always count on John."
"Yes".
"Yes, John? What's the matter?" he asked, focusing all his attention on him. He gave him a warm look and a gentle smile to improve his mood a little.
He shook his head. "No, I don't know him. Is that someone famous?"
"I beg your pardon?" Mycroft asked sincerely surprised.
"How much would I give it to be the only reason ..." he muttered so quietly that John could not understand his words.
Mycroft sighed softly, then looked down at his hand holding the umbrella. "Yes and no. It wasn't just a request, John. Could you give me some time to explain everything?"
"I know. I understood it the first time," he murmured.
"So why you took this pinging thing with you?" Lucy kept asking Josh. The conversation returned to its previous topic, which gave John considerable relief.
A moment later they stood in front of the apartment of Francesca and Franco Coletti. Mycroft knocked lightly with his long fingers, which fascinated John in a strange way for a long time. Francesca greeted them with a smile. She was wearing a mint-color dress, long enough to cover her knees, but giving her enough freedom of movement. As usual, her hair was pinned on top of her head. She reached out in an inviting gesture and hugged them both, to the satisfaction of John and the slightly smaller of Mycroft. When John saw the interior design and colors of the salon, he guessed that Francesca was the person who had the last word in the marriage. The living room and bedroom - which John saw out of the corner of his eye - were decorated to her liking. Pastel pink color decorated the walls and upholstery of chairs and sofas. Slightly darker, but still pink curtains fluttered in the open window. The glass table and crystal chandelier added charm and the lack of rugs and the presence of many plants gave the impression of freshness. The living room was in a definitely modern style, which only assured John that each guest had a choice of an apartment that suited their taste. He noticed travel bags standing next to the bedroom wall.
The doctor nodded as a sign that he understood, although he was not entirely convinced that it was indeed their dinner. However, he did not doubt that the price represented by several slices on the plate had to be humongous. He looked at Mycroft. "And this ..." he said and pointed to the white irregular thing with the tip of his knife, "is food too?"
When Mycroft's next request met with no response, John decided to act. He threw off the sheets in one move and walked over to shocked Sherlock. He was embarrassed by his nakedness and later - after returning home - he admitted that it was one of the bolder things he did. However, now he had to stop this very cheerful scene, so he put down his pride and shame. He stood naked in front of his closest friend and pushed him out of the room. It was not a very difficult task, because the man was too shocked and probably a little embarrassed. When he slammed the door behind Sherlock, he leaned his forearm against the doorframe and lowered his head.
Mycroft raised an eyebrow.
"John, don't push your luck." Mycroft's dark tone would alert everyone, but not John. They had known each other for a long time. It was not a deep relationship and each of them had their secrets, but Mycroft knew John would not be intimidated. Also, he was very agitated by his anger. Mycroft stood three feet from him, but John didn't seem to notice it at all.
Mycroft remembered about this proposal only now, but he did not show it. He looked at John and saw he showed no sign of regret what had happened several hours earlier. As if this situation did not happen. Mycroft was interested in his behavior and could not understand him at all. Staring into blue eyes, he stepped aside and let John walk toward the door.
He heard no answer. Instead, he heard voices and a murmur in the background. He put the basket down and put his free hand to his ear, focusing on the sounds.
He looked around again. His attention was caught by a book on the ground, hidden under the bed. "I didn't think he reads Hopkins," he muttered under his breath. However, Sherlock, apparently sensitive to his voice, suddenly stopped moving. He rose from the ground and turned to him with relief and pride on his face.
"I know this place. I read about it," Molly said softly. "It's one of the narrowest streets in the world. It's called ..." She was silent for a moment, trying to remember the name.
"It's hard to call it a conversation." It was an effort for him to open his mouth.
John expressed dissatisfaction with his words, by a loud sigh and theatrical rolling of his eyes. He was silent, but he took off his suit and vest and hung both things over the back of the couch. "Could the two of you don't do it today?" he asked. He poured some juice from a glass carafe and handed it to Molly.
"John?"
"Well done, Molly ..." he muttered and chuckled darkly. He looked up and caught John's startled look. Stoner didn't even pay attention to his companion because he was focused on John. He smiled, winked at him very slowly. He watched as his target quickly look away and climbed the stairs like a mountain chamois.
"No, it's nothing. I just thought I would like you to satisfy my other whims with such enthusiasm and passion ..." John said and watched as a smile appeared on the other man's lips. The atmosphere eased completely. John finally breathed a sigh of relief. He saw Mycroft was relaxed too.
Sherlock looked at his brother out of the corner of his eye. He heard his voice but didn't know how to interpret his words. Was he talking about himself or him? Mycroft was in such a state that it was impossible to deduce. "I heard that what happened in Venice stays in Venice," he said, changing the subject.
Big Ben's chimes rang out around the neighbourhood. They were loud. He also noticed that more horses and carriages were passing them, and the dirty songs gave way to the sounds of slow footsteps and the sound of waves bouncing off the Thames embankment. Looking out the window, he could no longer see the fog, only the lights of buildings and lanterns lined up at equal intervals. The carriage seemed to flow down the street. The jerks and sharp turns were gone. Over time, the sounds faded, and the horses slowed down. The animals walked quietly, trying not to wake the inhabitants. There were lights on in some of the windows, but most of the people were certainly asleep. The horses pulling the carriage walked slower and slower until they finally stopped. He looked out the window and then at the stranger. He nodded, putting his hand on the doorknob. He stood on the curb and looked around the area but had no idea where they were. He noticed a light in one of the windows just above his head and a sign with the name of the street next to it. He twitched, and his heart suddenly pounded in his chest. He remembered the name and who lived at that address. He turned to close the carriage door and say goodbye to the mystery man. He was about to do so when a well-known, lofty voice stopped him.
"to not give you a reason to be ashamed? Our marriage lasts less than ten minutes, and we have already argued ..."
He watched this all from the motorboat. The boat jumped from time to time on a larger wave and returned to its position. It wasn't good for him. He didn't like steady rocking. As a child, he suffered from motion sickness and was always told to look at something in front of him. He had to find an object and focus on it. Thanks to this, he forgot his malaise and the journey was not so troublesome for him anymore. At the moment his aim was a red building, standing at the edge of the main channel. He focused all his attention on this building and saw more and more details as he approached the shore. White window frames and small terraces, green curtains and a golden inscription 'Danieli' between the second and third floors. He clenched his fists because he had to face what he feared the most. He almost choked when the motorboat reached the shore.
"But I wish he would do it inside."
John gave her a big smile. "Don't worry about it. Sherlock is either sleeping until noon or not sleeping at all. It's normal for him."
"Romantic for sure," he finally said with a warm smile. They walked on in silence for some time, when at one point Sherlock stood still and looked at John intensely
John seemed in a better mood. He guessed Mycroft didn't spy on them this time.
"You are so formal, Mycroft. And you impose this type of behavior on others. I'm sure there are a lot of people in this room who would happily go to the dance floor if someone else dared to do it. Besides, your brother didn't teach me how to dance so I would stand quietly against the walls now when there are so many beautiful women around.
The evening began to go amazingly well. Sherlock did not think that it would be possible, but with each passing moment, the atmosphere in the living room was more cozy and romantic. Maybe it was because of the night that slowly enveloped London's streets. Maybe because of the silence between them. Or perhaps it was the fact that they were alone and they spent their time as usual. Sherlock took advantage of the moment, and for a moment he thought that maybe he would try to initiate some intimate conversation with his friend that evening. After all, they had peace, no one disturbed them, and the mood seemed just right. He didn't look away from John, who didn't seem to care about it, nor did he look uncomfortable. He sipped wine and examined the cover of the book that lay on the table next to his armchair.
"As you wish," Josh bowed slightly. The strings of the small guitar gleamed between his fingers. It shuddered when he jerked it with his thumb. Quiet and delicate sounds spread through the forest. Initially, these were just the sounds of music, after a long time Josh added his voice to the melody.
"John, did I ever say anything funny or wanted to make someone laugh?"
"I don't like you," John added immediately. As if he wanted to be sure that the man would understand his words. He looked up and took a sip of water. Stoner looked somewhat surprised but amused by John's sincere reply. He blinked quickly and wondered what to say. John sensed his chance.
Hello everybody! I am extremely grateful for your support. You really are amazing. That is why I am asking you for help. I plan to write my first story but I need a lot of time to plan many things. I always wanted to do it, but I didn't have enough courage and time to do it. Taking this opportunity - because I am sick and I have more free time - I would like to start planning a new story (of course I will still be translating the Bloody Ring). Therefore, I would be grateful if you answered a few questions:
"I did," John confirmed, closing his eyes, intending to cuddle into Mycroft's warm arm. He couldn't do it because the genius lifted his chin with his fingers and then kissed him. He had wanted it since he returned to England. Mycroft's hot breath, agility, and experience made him barely able to stand on his straight legs. He embraced his waist and allowed him to take control not only of the kiss itself but also his own body. He loved when the genius gently but firmly took him in his arms, pressed him to his body and kissed him passionately. He was surprised that it lasted only a few seconds. When Mycroft pulled away from his mouth, he looked straight into his dark, lust-filled eyes. "You have nothing to tell me?" he asked with a smile.
"Oh, and if you will find, then buy some cookies for Sherlock as well, because he has been asking for in since yesterday ..." she paused, seeing his distracted expression. She stroked his face lightly to get his attention. "Get out of the house for a moment otherwise you will come up with some ridiculous idea." She tucked a shopping bag into his hand and gave him a kind smile at the same time. "I'll call you if I remember something I didn't put on my list".
He looked at him and thought briefly. "Honestly, I don't remember. I have the impression that we met in past lives."
He lost track of time. He didn't know if their kiss lasted a second or ten minutes. The only thing in his head was the thought he had just kissed one of the most influential and dangerous people in England. He kissed Mycroft. His best friend's brother. John shivered again. And it was because of excitement and disbelief, not fear.
"It definitely crossing..." John breathed heavily, "all the lines I know." Because of Mycroft's wet and hot tongue, his delicate fingers clenching the back of his neck, and the smell of two perfumes mixing in the room, John had difficulty answering any questions.
Dr Hooper found it difficult to assume her earlier attitude, though she tried. She straightened up, lifted her chin and crossed her arms only to lower them a moment later with a heavy sigh. The spark of defiance faded from her eyes gave way to despondency. "I got used to it. I also understand that he is doing this to catch the Ripper."
"What is this horrible murder you are talking about, boy?" he asked, handing the young man three pence.
"How did you even come across the trail of Moriarty's organization? How do you know where to find his hiding places and how many are there?".
John knew exactly what Greg was talking about. Molly asked him on the plane if she should contact Greg. She must have finally understood that Sherlock would never be closer to her than he was right now. John was very happy for her because her short but intense relationship with the inspector seemed to be going in the right direction. "I'm glad," he said, though he couldn't get enough enthusiasm. He would have liked to drink something, but the bottle was already empty. Like his wallet. "Really, Greg. I wish you all the best," he added, looking straight ahead. He could feel his fellow inspector's gaze, but he preferred not to show him that his thoughts were elsewhere.
John tried to survive this difficult situation somehow and did not even realize Mycroft was reading all his thoughts and emotions. He knew perfectly well why John felt uncomfortable. He was silent for a long moment, but everything had its limits. At one point he got up and spoke without looking at the gondolier. "Stop here," he said in a rough voice, not even trying to use Italian. The man looked surprised, just like John, but he swam up to the nearest stairs and stopped there without a word. Mycroft elegantly stepped ashore and offered his hand to John. He paid the gondolier and went with John deep into the dark street.
"John. This evening we have a special meeting - the official opening of our congress. We must be present. I would like to explain everything to you slowly, but I really don't have time now" Mycroft said, finally turning to the doctor and putting on his wristwatch. "I need to meet someone urgently".
"Oh, John ... Yes, I have my reasons, but I don't want to ruin Mycroft's reputation. At least, not like that."
"You can be sure they will be fine. I never change my mind. Your hospital will get a grant, even if our plan fails."
"Well, maybe he didn't say it that way, but he insisted and ..." Molly seemed to sense Sherlock's dissatisfaction, so she fell silent and turned her head, looking at the genius. Sherlock gave her a dark and mysterious look from above the menu card.
"Mr. Stoner definitely keeps his promise and will spend the rest of the day with you as promised," Francesca said.
"Losing? That's not what love is about, brother mine. A broken heart isn't the same as the feeling of losing."
Mycroft nodded. He wiped his mouth with an elegant napkin and pushed his chair away from the table.
"We'll have time to plan our revenge." Sherlock also did not hide his amusement. He was genuinely interested in John's offer. After all, the possibility of teasing his brother was too tempting to reject it. "Two months to be more specific."
"You will hurt your eyes, Mycroft. You shouldn't sit so close to a laptop."
Sherlock lost his temper and was breathing deeply. "Ah!" he groaned, tightening his abs as John hit his prostate. "Ah!"
"Mr. Holmes shuns social life, but he knows the conventions and human weaknesses. What would it look like if a woman interfered in the marriage of her boss and spent more time with him than his partner? This is part of the game so that people could not suspect anyone for cheating, and you know how exuberant human imagination can be. They see bread in wheat grain and see a secret lover in a loyal assistant. Mr. Holmes prefers to play it safe, but that does not mean he neglects his duties. "
He was awakened by a gentle touch on his shoulder.
"Oh John!" she screamed, trying to hide her nervousness and embarrassment. Deep blushes decorated her cheeks, and a trembling voice convinced John that something was wrong. "Sorry ... it was the first time I saw two men kissing in front of my eyes ..." she added, trying to cover her face.
"But some people ordered and paid the orchestra," John said and pointed at the band. It's true their music was not much fun, but John was of the opinion it was because none of the guests stood on the dance floor.
It all began on the spring day when he was introduced to the most representative person in the country for the first time. He was still young and inexperienced, but at the same time convinced that one day both the queen and the other members of the royal family would address him with respect and with requests so that he could solve their problems. When he stood before the queen, he was neither scared nor overwhelmed by the presence of the monarch. He examined her with a careful look but kept his conclusions to himself. For some reason, he immediately gained her trust and later sympathy. One day she took him for a walk in her gardens. She asked why, as one of the few of her subordinates, he has no wife yet. The question surprised him so much that he only managed to make a short answer. He learned that the presence of the ring on his finger allows him to win a greater trust of other people. They have the impression that the owner of the ring is more emotionally and life-stable and thus has a lower propensity to cheat and take risks. She made him realize that the most important thing is the presence and first impression, and whether the illusion in which the others believe is real does not matter. It doesn't matter if power is involved. He believed her. After all, nobody knew more about this type of matter than her. He felt greater respect and admiration for her that day. He followed her instructions and suggestions, and a week later he bought a gold ring and put it on his finger. When he was asked about the reason and when the judgments were made, he did not correct their erroneous conclusions. He let others believe what they wanted. Slowly and reluctantly, he started playing a game of appearances, but he was sure of his skills. He didn't see anything wrong with it, so he kept going into the cobwebs of lies, that he easily controlled.
