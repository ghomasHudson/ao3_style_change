"Yes, I'm sure John's appreciative," the detective mumbled, shoving his hands into his pockets. The doctor glared at him.
"No, my classmates are okay," the child sighed, slumping forwards. Her skirt and jumper crinkled at the movement, her chin falling into her palms.
Their future experiences didn't deviate much, and all of his extensive couple knowledge came from common media. They were not the worst of cliches or an overly affectionate grouping; Sherlock was still Sherlock, though more possessive and less disparaging over proximity, and John was still accustomed to professionalism on the job and had a fondness of keeping private life private, as per his military background. Still, there was the usual - winding embraces, knitted fingers, and yes,
"But, to be clear, you'd be alright with it? A date," the brunette added, slightly too quickly, and she silently cursed herself for doing this. Years without romance had obviously robbed her of proper social graces.
"I can always say that two girls arrived in my house in the middle of the night. It was dark, and they attacked me when I was in bed, hoping to steal my manuscript for themselves. Luckily, I disposed of them during the attack and was able to escape. Self defense, extraordinary circumstances." Rosie's eyes narrowed as he lunged, a bullet flying loose. Reyna narrowly dove behind the desk before throwing the closest object within reach, which was a bulky lamp, in his direction. He yelped at the offending light fixture hit him squarely on the jaw.
Most of the wine, Molly pretended not to notice, was gifted from Mycroft. He actually did care about the two men, though his methods of expressing this were clearly lacking. Wine was what he could do, a token of good will without a big gesture.
"Yes, it's good, Watson. It's overly sugary, though. Typical of eleven year olds, really - the concentration could use more balance." It's a run of the mill Sherlock response, but his cheeks are pinched with red in a way that might have nothing to do with the cold.
In seconds they had located the office, and inside that office laid a desk. Reyna opened several drawers before producing a stack of papers.
"You know how Dad and Daddy were acting like idiots for years and years?" Rosamund tells her at the return of her fathers from date fifteen, the most recent one. Molly nodded her affirmations. "I love you, Aunt Molly, but don't be like them. You're way too clever for that."
"Thank you. I think." Then the consulting detective immediately began to scowl magnificently again, for thanking Mycroft for anything left a rather unpleasant taste in his mouth, much akin to nauseating chemicals in a lab.
"What do you want, sweetheart?" the older woman questioned, gazing at the child with concern. To Molly's great surprise, the toddler gave out another giant sniffle before tossing them a baleful pout.
Sherlock is almost entirely certain he is in love with his partner, which makes this whole thing so strange. He's been steadily falling for quite a long time, he believes. This is why, after a year of midnight violin practices, silly outings, exchanged snogs, cups of tea, and simply being together, he rolls over in their bed and pokes his significant other awake. He has something he's wanted to say for an achingly great period of time and it's been keeping him up.
"They should be going by now, I think," Mrs. Hudson muttered, alluding to the police. "They've already stayed for so long . . ." With a nod, the young woman trudged up the stairs, Rosamund in hand.
It was a rather dramatic affair, utterly unexpected, and great tears were pouring out of the toddler's face like a sprinkler. The whole scene was far too much for Molly, too much for the day, and she resisted the urge to start screaming alongside her niece.
But then one John Watson, his blue eyes swarming with relief as he saw her, opened the door, a huffy baby Rosamund in hand and a phone in the other. From behind him, Sherlock could be observed groaning in exasperation at the police force, who had, once again, encroached on their private quarters.
Sherlock Holmes wasn't accustomed to being in complete darkness. The partial depths of night from inside the great shadows of 221B, sure, but the lamps from the streets always cast enough light to work with. The underbelly of London contained in passages and subway tunnels, certainly, but the dim glow of his and John's respective phones were usually enough to see with. Even on the few occasions someone dared to kidnap him, the perpetrators preformed a shoddy job with tying the blindfolds, and the faint impressions of movement and bright spots lingered beneath the edges of the cloth.
As time went along, he allowed for exceptions to be made, attachments to be had. Still, the romantic variety eluded him, mostly out of self inflicted choice, because love did not end well. As Mycroft was so fond of reminding him, caring was not an advantage. Sherlock had taken this to mean it was a luxury, and one he could ill afford.
Then a swift opening of the door broke the calm, accompanied by a 'hello, brother mine' and the unmistakable click of an umbrella on the floorboards.
"Nobody is like you, Dad." The dark haired man smiled wryly at this irony, running a hand through his locks.
For the longest time, she enjoyed complex words, the ones with pretty notations. Brooding, in particular, was such a funny one. Prerogative, derivative, inclination, prose, meandering, hydrogenous - there were so many beautiful, multifaceted notations to choose from. Collecting words had become a bit of a game for her, over the years, but elementary was the one she liked being called the most. There was something odd about it, something ornamental and antique yet soothing, endearing, even, that drew her in.
Rosamund didn't know whether to feel embarrassed, slightly disgusted, or deliriously happy for them.
"It's fascinating, your interactions. You speak without speaking," he mused, lifting his shoulders and slightly disrupting the suit. "Tell me, how is the good doctor?"
They were, weren't they? Not exactly the average lot, not by a long shot, but if her classmates thought that they were special, too, then there was absolutely nothing wrong with different.
"Oh, hi Mr. Lestrade," Reyna said, looking up from the board. "Yes, we're alright. I've got a few bruises that we've taken pictures of - "
It's the last thing he can make out - a worn, utterly familiar voice coming from his partner - before he willingly surrenders to the clutches of sleep.
They remained that way for the span of the entire game, and when Rosie's team won, Molly jumped up, cheering for her niece.
"It's supposedly - though we know the contrary - an original Shakespeare. Somebody went through the trouble of introducing iambic pentameter in between prose, forging the writing style, and attempting to copy what little the modern day has recovered of his calligraphy in order to sell a 'lost, unpublished set of foul papers'. They had to keep the original frauds somewhere more secure, though the quill and ink Henderson used may still be in this room. We might need them for further proof later." Reyna frowned, stuffing the papers down her jacket anyhow.
"Yes, sorry you have to listen to another speech. I'm sure you're all very sick of people talking today. Nothing against him, poor dear, but I nearly fell asleep during the officiator's role." Rosamund laughed, Reyna putting a quick hand over her best friend's mouth. "Anyways, I'm sorry to admit this, but I didn't look up any template or ask the web for advice on writing my 'best man' speech. I decided to wing it in terms of structure, to hang the unofficial rules, which is rather odd for me. If any of you have ever met me, you'd know that I'm a very organized, on-book personality, and mostly mild mannered. This was new, so here's to hoping it turns out okay, right?" She took another small swig of her glass. "Sherlock asked me to be his 'best man' at his wedding, and to be honest I was surprised. I've known Sherlock longer than he's known John - and trust me, that's a very long time indeed - and I had yet to find a single person who was capable of keeping up with him, physically and mentally. Even during that period, working with him constantly, he never opened up. It was like he didn't know what friends were, how to make them. I have to say, my initial instinct was to take care of him, as Sherlock is very much a man who needed constant companionship but didn't desire it in the slightest. Neither I nor anybody else who interacted with our genius quite knew how to do that. But John - after a day, he made more progress with Sherlock than anybody had in years. I've never seen two people form a bond so quickly, or, in the times to come, two people undergo so many challenges and still come out on top. If they could withstand all of that, if Sherlock and John could still survive and stick together, than I have no doubts that they'll be able to sustain this marriage. And, even if things get tough, know that you'll always have me, and Greg, and everybody else who showed up. We're with you, no matter what." She smiled at her friends, dimples and all. "Congratulations, and have a wonderful life, boys." Rosamund began clapping, eyes misting up slightly.
"You're welcome. He tells you the same thing, I'm sure. You shouldn't question it, if you start to over-analyze this - John is a man of his word, and Rosamund thinks the world of both of you. It doesn't take a genius to figure that out, but how fortunate for us that we're both geniuses, anyhow." Mycroft got up, sniffing as a new scent had breached his nose. A bloodhound, his brother, when there was food involved. "I daresay the tea is ready."
"Take it as a good thing. You'll be much easier to manage at work, I believe," Lestrade interjected, grabbing his wife's hand. "But don't worry, you're just as brilliant and irritable as ever, I'm sure."
a detective, aren't you?" the eldest stated, letting lose a rare, rather amused smile, as though a puppy had just performed a trick.
"Sherlock Holmes, beneath all of your genius you are a normal human being and I know for a fact that you could use a hot drink. Take a sip, for god's sake."
"You could try, but it wouldn't do a lick of good," Rosamund eventually affirmed. "I've got an awful lot of Dad in me, huh?" The doctor considered this for a moment.
"No." Rosie's words were forceful and fierce, not something you would expect from someone who wasn't even two.
How dreadful. Much like a terrible exchange at the supermarket - something good for something foul in nature.
"And risk getting caught in the headlines for the murder of a teenage girl? You'd be making a lot of enemies, my friend. And if I were you, I certainly wouldn't want a further investigation of your house. And especially not your bedroom, I take it." The girls watched as the historian began to sputter. "Ah, so I was right. I thought you would keep them in your office, but they
"I guess that's true. But you can't argue that the structuring, the development, and the commentary on the political aspects of the time aren't fascinating. That's something that persevered in his works that few other playwrights in that era managed to capture."
And trying to sound intelligent took cognitive thought, sadly. I had to really think about what Sherlock Holmes might actually wonder about, and so I apologize if the wording isn't quite correct. I tried to keep things in the spirit.
"I do have faith in Rosie, and this isn't some sort of separation anxiety or anything. I'm not a child, but surely you've got to understand that - " The great Sherlock Holmes groaned loudly.
"That doesn't mean you have to be excluded from it, you know. You could have bullied your way back in."
Only Lestrade remained in 221B Baker Street, and he appeared to be gathering his things. Ignoring the blubberings of the child in her arms, Molly readjusted her grip and held out Rosie.
"Well, then," the government official said, a grin slowly eating away at his face. "Marriage certainly has changed you. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Watson-Holmes, and try not to muck everything up too soon. The separation paperwork alone would be a nightmare." Encouraging, as ever.
If nothing else, it could be said with conviction that John Watson adored his family, possibly more than life itself.
An adjustment, to be certain. However, he's found he's liked having a small child around for the last few years, as odd and inexplicable as it may be.
could get off work in time, but Sherlock and John had cases that stretched long into the night, and frankly all of Rosamund's big games took place smack in the middle of the week, which was a virtual rush hour in 221B. They would almost always have to rush in, last minute, what with traffic and cases and the trek to the field.
do the same for me." Sadly, the brief mention of the doctor's late wife didn't distract him in the slightest. Perhaps more assessment was required.
"You're incredible. Absolutely incredible," Reyna said with uttermost sincerity in her voice. "I mean it, Rosamund. You're the most brilliant person I've ever met." The blonde scoffed.
Still, he did things such as this for no reason other than he liked it. Greg Lestrade enjoyed looking out for the common man - this was what his entire life was devoted to, to making the world a better place in whatever ways he could, and his job and habits reflected those principals.
"I don't want to see you in a hospital bed, on the back of an ambulance, ever, ever again." His blue eyes wavered as if beginning to drown in tears and memorabilia. "It was bad enough the first time they took you away."
"You're not doing all that bad so far. You haven't fallen into a coma of fear yet, so fingers crossed."
"Crowded? Loud? Filled with children who don't like you? I didn't exactly enjoy rigorous boarding schools for the social aspect, either."
Sherlock and John hadn't wanted anyone to help them with their vows - frankly, it was the one aspect of this entire wedding they planned alone - and now she was seriously terrified of whatever might have been written. John's were probably alright, but Sherlock had no sense of propriety, and the brunette just realized
"That too, but about us. I'm the lucky one. You chose me." The officiator took that as que to start speaking again.
- and I just got a call from the bank about some payment transfer troubles from our last job and Sherlock and I haven't slept in three days and Rosie is starting to get
, you know. Sherlock Holmes, always in the middle of things." The sentences were laced in unintentional bitterness. John sighed and pulled his partner's head onto his shoulder.
"I'm fairly certain the wife did it. It all depends on whether or not the family owns a record player," he says, crossing his hands over his knees. "And, naturally, whether or not that hypothetical record player has its needle or not. It's crucial to the incrimination of the woman." John laughed, a warm, hearty sound that lit up the room.
Perhaps she's been expending too much thought on this. There's no use pining after what you cannot have.
"Before you arrived I took the liberty of searching the internet for information on Henderson. Well, on social media he has a picture of his dog in his house, lying on a pristine wooden floor with light streaming in." She pulled up the photo once more for reference. "Since he has a dog in the first place, that eliminates everywhere in London that doesn't allow pets. He's a bachelor, with little family from what I could find, and so a flat for one was the logical option. As already noted, the dog is on a wooden floor, but the breed - a malamute in a city, of all places - is notorious for shedding, as are most big dogs. However, the wood around the animal is absolutely spotless. More than spotless, it still has the varnish on, so it's brand new. Not many new flats come standard with such expensive wooden flooring, especially not those that also allow pets, and since Henderson was already an established historian with a hefty income, he lives in a posh development. Now we must consider the proximity to his work and only one area is available. That still leaves about twenty units on the same strip. However, the light streaming into the room was tinted, reflecting shades of blue and purple onto the floor, meaning he had a stained glass window. And, according to the street view available on my cell, only one flat matched that description." She relaxed once more, dropping her voice of authority and replacing it with an easy smile. "It's simple, once you think about things objectively."
, as juvenile as it sounded, with his silly and rather shapeless woolen jumpers and his oversized stuffy chair and his endless patience and understanding and selflessness. There was no way to describe him other than
When they finally arrived back at 221B, their hands were swinging together in an amiable, rather pleasant, fashion. He couldn't quite recall how they became intertwined, but it didn't much matter - John was happy, he was happy, for once, and that was the underlying takeaway.
She had a grandma named Mrs. Hudson who lived right downstairs and bakes cookies with her - from scratch, she might let you know - every weekend, and Rosie's gotten quite good at assisting with shortbread. It's her favorite thing to make, she thinks, because it takes the longest to cook and that means she can bask in the warmth of her grandmother's kitchen, swinging her legs and listening to stories. Some are fairy tales, some are old memories, and some are the details of mysteries long since solved. It's the mysteries she loves the best, she believes, because Mrs. Hudson will talk about a tall man in a silly cap and his wonderful best friend, and Rosie will laugh as she tries to imagine her father doing all of those crazy things. She's not dumb - the smartest in her class, actually, as her teacher says - and she knew from the very start that those made up cases were the adventures of the men living right upstairs. But still, they sound so much
Her fathers kept bickering in the cab over "no, we're not getting a dog" and "why are we not talking about
They are happier, her friends, in the moments where people cannot see them. Blonde and black locks, far more effortlessly intertwined. It's precious, what they have, and though it is tentative it seems unbreakable. She's never been prouder to call them her family than when they reappear at 221B Baker Street, the best versions of themselves. An incredible uplift is present.
"I don't know what I'm saying, actually. But I would have given it my best shot, if you were going to be with me through it," he admitted, gazing down at their intertwined hands beneath the sheets. "We're a good fit." Sherlock opened his mouth, preparing to speak or to possibly elaborate, but he paused, gathering that John might have more to voice. "I daresay I might have adored you from the start." Sherlock balks again, for it really is too early, for once, to be dealing with such heavy, if not welcome, revelations.
what he finds himself in, to the surprise of most. An actual, functioning, healthy, adult relationship with a normal, loyal, handsome, intelligent man.
, no matter what. The simple act of texting a woman besides his wife had filled him with guilt, and even at his maddest, he never abandoned Sherlock or their cases.
"Sherlock! Oh my god, what was that for?" the woman says, trying to catch her breath after jumping back almost three feet. John looks just as startled, but the pale white of fright seems to have canceled out the rosy tones of before, and his skin appears nearly normal now.
"I'll put on a new kettle. Drop off your bags and we'll get started, then." Reyna shot her a sarcastic salute.
"Almost." And yet his advanced mind can't help but latch onto the 'our' in that statement. 'Our friends' seems almost resolute, almost like a couple.
There are salty, surprised tears streaking down John's cheeks, and for the first few seconds everything tastes like saline. And then, he molds to the surface, learning the dips and curves of his partner's mouth, trying to memorize what it feels like to press against him like this. Then, there is tea leaves, a sweet undertone in contrast to the bitter, stinging drops of before, and traces of spearmint from a stick of gum, and it is a unique yet enticing taste.
"She ducked out when you went to the bathroom. She traveled over to Reyna's for the afternoon; she mentioned something about giving her violin lessons."
"Right. Well, I guess most couples date, get married, have children, and then live out their days under the same roof as a unified front. I'm afraid I didn't get the memo; when it came to me and Sherlock, everything was always a little bit off book," he started sheepishly, rubbing the back of his neck. "There wasn't anything about becoming a unified front, bypassing everything else, getting over the death
"Consulting detective, actually," she corrected without turning around. She could hear her best friend's laughter the entire way up the stairs.
Now, at first one might think that the groundbreaking investigative work required in a case is a riveting, edge-of-your-seat endeavor. This was Rosamund's impression of her parent's daily work, and on the whole, she wasn't wrong. This line of inquiry she was so desperate to fall into was dangerous, imploring, and very, very complex. However, every occupation has its lags, and the initial scouring of documents was far from the intense chase scenes and murders she had witnessed so far.
. This is basic fact. However, John makes everything better, and this is also an indisputable fact. Perhaps the motivators cancel out one another?). It's as if the doctor's smiles, his thoughts are seeping through his skin.
"Tea would be marvelous, thank you." He gave a lidded smile towards a disgruntled Sherlock Holmes. "As would a conversation with my brother."
"It's pointless. It's just a contrived notion carried around for decades that says you should change your name after you wed."
Waxing poetics, maybe, but this is one of the few areas of life where he indulges in fine words and beauty for the sake of beauty. The other is in music, in the long and sometimes brutally honest notes he coaxes from the violin when all of London is asleep, but that was different. Those were private symphonies, unique to Sherlock Holmes. But anyone, anyone at all, can capture the golden afternoon under the right circumstances, and that is what makes them so interesting. Perfection is rarely achieved in such open doses.
I have visions of grandeur for a sequel centering around Rosamund, but for now the next page will have to satisfy anyone still curious about her as I have a knack for procrastination, multiple other things to finish, and only a fuzzy idea of the future plot. It will happen eventually, though, and when it does I hope that the same fans will be eager to read about the next adventures of the Watson-Holmes spectacle. I know that I, for one, am looking forward to it.
John had started to feel safe here. He was happy again, the way things were. He was comfortable with his life, and with Rosie's life at 221B. Sherlock would never dream of compromising that sense of home.
"Can we move past you?" John questioned politely, cup in hand. Sherlock flicked the lapels of his coat upwards against the wind. Wordlessly, Molly and Lestrade made way so that the two men could sit behind them, scrunched up in the corner like always. By now, Molly was fairly sure Rosamund had warned off all of the other parents in order to reserve that spot. "It's really bloody cold outside, isn't it?"
, an urge he has diligently made sure to suppress or ignore in years prior. It's the way he asks the man silly questions, almost unnoticeable boughts of irregularity, like 'how was you day' or 'are you tired' or 'you are okay, right'. It's the way he grips his hand tightly after the success of a case, squeezing it firmly and not pulling away for a second.
"I know, I know, I just haven't really been around another one since Gladstone . . . " the blonde trailed off, and Reyna grimaced. For a short while, on her twelfth birthday, Rosamund had received a rescue named Gladstone. He was a pudgy bulldog, around one or two, but he was a sweet and rather lovable pet.
Sherlock Holmes is convinced that this is a dream, or a bizarre, lengthy acid trip. He is not accustomed to things running smoothly, to relationships panning out. And that
This was a strategic move, the end of an era. She might never get married and have children like she's dreamt about as a little girl. Molly Hooper, with her sweet smiles and gentle attitude, was made for motherhood, for nurturing. She quite liked the idea of taking care of people, of being taken care of, and perhaps this was why she had fancied Sherlock Holmes for the longest time. If anyone was in dire need of affection, of being watched over, it was Sherlock, with all of his midnight locks and bright eyes. He was intriguing, a rare and beautiful creature, but a broken one nonetheless.
They were living together in her flat, now, as they had been for almost the last year. It had simply made sense for Greg to move in with her; her flat was the biggest of the two, in relatively close proximity to his work, very clean and tidy, and only a five minute ride from 221B given good traffic. There wasn't a need to search for available listings or start looking into new buildings; what they had, much like their relationship, worked. That was all there was to it.
"You're not in love with eachother," she completed, a new understanding dawning over her. How had she not noticed it before, really? Sure, they had moved her upstairs once she was big enough and they kept the same bed, but they never cuddled outside of their room like other couples. They didn't go on dates, and while she had assumed that they were simply too busy, they never tried to make the time for it either. And there was no kissing, even if John always made breakfast and Sherlock always helped him with his coat.
"Rosamund's trying to set up her fathers. It's amazing they haven't noticed before now. John plays into her hands beautifully at these matches."
Rosamund honestly had no idea what to do. She was a great aim, but Henderson still had a gun without the safety on. A surprise bullet to the the leg might prompt an itchy trigger finger of his own, and that would almost certainly hit Reyna. And that was assuming he wouldn't move last minute - the way he and her best friend were struggling on the floor was chaotic, unpredictable, and if Reyna rolled over she could easily get caught in the crossfire.
"Dad, can I join you on the next case?" she had asked, cornering her dark haired father on a rare occasion when he was alone. She chose a moment when John was out getting groceries, his phone nicked from his pocket by Rosie herself and laid in her room. Mrs. Hudson was wearing headphones and vacuuming a floor away. Lestrade and Molly were out, and the windows were securely fastened.
, John!"), and vomiting up a can of expired dog food (they hadn't been able to go shopping for a while, alright?), it was evident that life at their flat was too dangerous for such a small, bumbling creature, and Grandma and Grandpa Holmes had ended up taking in the portly hound. Sure, Gladstone was still alive, healthy, and very, very fat, as her grandmother took great pleasure in stuffing him with biscuits, but when Rosamund got attached to something, she simply couldn't give it up. She was absolutely devastated by their separation, and Reyna and John and Molly had been by her side almost constantly after his absence.
"I think that's what being in love is, Daddy," she told him, hugging her father tightly. "It's not meant to make sense. It's messy and horrid and makes you do dangerously stupid things. It's supposed to cloud your better judgement, and I think if you ever feel like you have it all figured out, if you're not aching all over or falling too fast or dropping too hard, then you're doing it wrong. Love is terrible, and wonderful, because it lets someone see the absolute worst in you and forces you to test yourself over and over again. You're meant to drown, but enjoy letting the water crash overhead."
"John, give me my niece," she interrupted, because no matter how agonizing her afternoon was Molly was nothing if not kindhearted and empathetic. Of course, 'niece' was just a title and it held no real weight, but ever since the one and a half year old child had been able to speak simple words, 'Aun Mol' had been the dubbing Molly received.
Rosie might suspect, though. She smiles at them, more of a smirk, really, when she thinks they can't see her. Greg finds it amusing.
Sure, she had friends she loved dearly. They were not friends, they were family members. She had passions, likes and dislikes, affections. But indicators of crushes she shut down in record time, kept tidily away.
Of course Rosie wouldn't pass up the chance to further the bonding process while she wasn't around. Naturally, this would have been made into a date of sorts.
"Freezing and very, very tired," she responded, shivering on que. With a frown, he handed her his cup. "What are you doing?"
" - took on a fully grown man with an enormous gun by herself without informing us where she was going. She could have died. How does that
"No one, indeed. As it is, because of who we are, you've learned a lot more than you should have. Your vocabulary, for example, is a lot more extensive. No other children your age complete five hundred piece puzzles or play memory games like we do." He paused for a moment as if reminded of something. "By the way, what can you tell me about your class?" She cleared her throat, eyes lighting up.
Rosie frowned. She hadn't found the iconic plays of Shakespeare that interesting in school - many people liked them, and she was fine with that, but they had always seemed slightly stupid to her. People behaved in idiotic, unrealistic ways in many of his most famous works, such as Romeo & Juliet. No romance at all - just lust addled teenagers making horrible life choices on a whim. How
"It's just one pound for a steaming cup of hot chocolate," one pleaded, batting her eyelashes innocently. "The rugby team really needs the money for competition and every little bit counts." Ah, so they were bleeding money out of the folks on the benches. Effective, she had to admit, given how absolutely dismal it had been.
A ridiculous, fanciful notion, naturally. No scientific grounding whatsoever. But then again, even Sherlock can appreciate a bit of misguided faith in the improvable now and then.
"I'm warning you, Sherlock, you need to control yourself. I can't keep going shopping for new sweaters every single time you decide to destroy them."
"How could I forget? I thought I'd lost you." The break in his voice had dulled over the years, reduced only to a clip hovering over the word 'lost', but it is still audible to those who knew where to look.
"No, no, pumpkin, just . . ." His face was red, though this could have been from a rise in self awareness or a decrease in temperature rather than the intense gagging of before. She settled on embarrassment or a new state of self consciousness, given the lack of a chill. Never before had Rosamund felt so proud that her detective had begun teaching her the fine art of deduction. "Why do you ask, Rosie?" he eventually sputtered out, viciously clearing his throat and sitting up straighter.
With a great deal more effort than it should have taken, he forces his eyelids to retreat, and his vision, blurry and patchy from a distinct lack of use, begins to restore itself.
"That's all I needed to know, Sherlock." He said, despite his brother's sudden glimpse of a steel backbone, smiling slightly and twisting his umbrella authoritatively. "He's never going to stop staying, either. He loves you."
, Rosie had picked up some things at her ripe age of five. Like, for instance, all the usual preliminaries - the alphabet, her name, basic numbers, colors, etc. But Sherlock had also, when John was not around, started teaching her about other things, such as the art of deduction and the importance of rudimentary mathematics and the distinct smells of chemicals in the lab.
of all people (Reyna had only encountered him a handful of times while knowing Rosie but those brief occasions were enough to inform her that
"Is this seriously how it's going to be all the time, now?" Sherlock took a single sip of his beverage.
" - when a news story conveyed the tale of a boy who lead dogs away from a trail using salted herrings as bait, yeah - "
"John, I think I'm supposed to say something about how great of a person you are and how proud I am to have you at my side, but I won't." Molly glanced down the benches, observing the other guests. All of them looked completely confused.
at times." He kissed him again - just for good measure - and the doctor once again lost his train of thought. With a nod towards her uncle, Sherlock Holmes ushered the two girls and his partner out of the flat. Confused, Bailey began padding after them.
"Partners, of course," she whispered back, and Reyna smiled, slowly and languidly, as they drove onwards.
"Sherlock, what you fail to grasp is that you were not a doxy that I went out with for a few weeks at a time. You were far, far more permanent.
She hadn't been part of a huge family, growing up. Her father had died in her teenage years and she didn't have any aunts or uncles. Her maternal grandmother and mother were her only relatives, and even then, her gran had been in a bad way for years. She passed off a little less than a decade ago, and now it was just Molly and her mum, alone together.
. A little advanced, sure, but both of her fathers always seemed so proud when she got excited about these novels, when she flipped through them the way she loved to. 'Our little genius', they'd say. So clever.
Rosamund isn't so easily satisfied. She pokes and prods and analyzes her fathers with scrutiny, hoping to gain new information on the state of their romantic entanglement. It's slightly ironic, actually; most girls her age are obsessed with bands, boys, and beauty, while Rosie is far more interested in her parents' private life, advanced chemistry, and the art of deduction.
stupid characters in books. Give me a clever girl who doesn't go into the ominous back room in a horror movie, or a disgruntled teenager that actually listens to their parents when they say 'don't do drugs' or 'don't have sex' or 'don't hang out with them'. When people make idiotic decisions for no reason it's annoying." Reyna shrugged.
"Do you think you can tough it out? Just until you get home each afternoon? I'd rather not explain to your father that I'm pulling you out of the academy due to boredom."
"John likes it, and I'm John's. Even Rosie seems to have an affection for it. I suggest you grow used to it," he answered, and perhaps, if one looked hard enough, they could observe the tinge of pink coloring the back of his ears.
The name, for one, is almost completely ceremonial. Watson-Holmes is a bit of a mouthful, actually, and it rolls over his tongue in an unnatural way. He knows he must become accustomed to it sooner or later, and with a little time, logic dictates he will learn to take the title in stride as an everyday occurrence.
However, he's not blushing out of embarrassment or being caught off guard, and he's smiling widely. John Watson is more at ease, happier, and this is evident in every line of his face. That tells her everything she would have wanted to glean about their date - as long as they're alright, she's more than content to leave the rest alone.
has to love Daddy. It might be you. He's far too great, don't you agree?" His smile, for once, was uneven and shaky, his gaze wobbling.
"Don't bother. It's nothing." Sherlock and John, ten minutes later, arrived last, and John instantly veered towards the hot chocolate booth.
The kitchen, for one, was spotless, without a dirty dish in sight. Two plates laden with pasta salad sat on the table, next to eachother, with Sherlock's experiments neatly shoved to the side for once without being disrupted. A pair of cocktails - yes, cocktails, because apparently her eleven year old niece could make cocktails now - sat innocently on the counter, and an electric candle was placed in the center of their meal.
"John Watson, go to our needy friend. I think he's about to blow a fuse and being left next to Anderson for so long is going to have its repercussions," she warns, closing her hands tighter around the toddler. "I'm
working. I'm investigating the dangers this dog would pose to our research. I've come to the conclusion that Bailey is friendly."
This is significantly better than his view of the ceiling and a small portion of the wall, especially since he can now spot Watson in the corner, slumped over in a very uncomfortable looking plastic chair.
"So, as we were about to say, good job. We're very proud of the efforts of you and Reyna." He raised an eyebrow and let a rare, impossibly small smile slip out. "Well done, Rosie." She beamed like the sun. Legitimate praise from any Holmes was hard to come by, and Sherlock especially didn't give compliments lightly. "Let's leave Lestrade's men to patch things up here. Hopefully they won't bungle this too badly come morning." Greg, a mere ten feet away, rolled his eyes yet didn't comment.
, John," he finds himself saying regardless. "Very, very private, one-sided ones. We sleep in the same
"What, then?" Children, surprisingly, were often harder to get a read on than adults. Adults have patterns, common sense, daily routines and obligations that need to be met. Their instincts have distilled down into a few fundamentals based on circumstance. Children, however, didn't have such pressures. Their emotions changed on a dime, as the expression went, and their motives were often unclear at first. Sloppiness was a common given, inattentiveness even more so. However, they were not immune to his deductions entirely. Even the brightest and most advanced of kids were often swayed by bribes of sugar or signs of distress, such as a damning punishment. Rosie, as he's noticed, hasn't been very concerned with the accumulation or avoidance of either.
Lastly, there was John and Sherlock's wedding, in which Molly and Lestrade were the best women and men, respectively.
"Sod off, Ro." The lock clicked in a rather satisfying fashion and Rosie stood up, grinning triumphantly.
Rugby was certainly not the same as learning a new language, but as far as the unexpected, it was far up the list.
Why is he in a hospital, though? He doesn't recall being sick, or much of anything that would lead to a sick visit.
At this point, as they approached Baker Street once again, Reyna leaned over and whispered in her ear.
"Dad, I want to help out on your next job. Like a real field agent. I know I can help. I know I could be useful." He stared at her, most likely scouring his mind palace and contemplating all possible outcomes of that proposal, before puckering his lips.
"Wait for me to finish cleaning up and I'll join you." The detective doesn't grin - not after giving into the biological need to sleep, of course, because the practices of mere mortals are so very tedious, but he does straighten his back, relax his hands, loosen the knots in his forehead, and frankly that's just as good as if he had smiled, anyways.
This was why, when he proposed, she didn't question it. She didn't think he was anything less than serious as he asked. She didn't hound him with doubts or make sure he was certain about this.
"Honestly, Rosamund, what are best friends for if not to aid in questionable legal affairs?" The look the blonde passed her was nothing short of blinding.
Of course, not to mention that the dead body still possessed more knowledge on rugby than her. The woes she must face.
"And do you, John Watson, take Sherlock Holmes as your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, til death do you part?"
"Should I even ask how you came to that conclusion based on a picture of the corpse and a couple of files?"
"We were on a case and we had the subject cornered. Lestrade's crew was on his way, only a block from the bloke's flat. However, he pulled a gun on me from across the room, safety off. He was a botanist, and you grabbed a handful of dirt and were prepared to throw it in the guy's eyes and disarm him, but as we distracted him, Lestrade arrived and Anderson kicked down the door. He accidentally pulled the trigger in surprise and you . . ." Watson swallowed, directing his gaze towards the ceiling. "You shoved me out of the way, you stupid man. He grazed your side fairly badly and you hit your head on the corner of a desk. I didn't . . ." He swallowed again. "At first, I thought you were dead, Holmes. You've been in a coma-like state for the last several hours and I've been scared out of my bloody mind that you might not wake up." Initially, Sherlock puzzled over what a normal human response to this scenario would be. Surely there must be
"A little late, I know, but as best man, I'd like to say a few words," Lestrade started, holding out his cup. "Now the internet had told me that the correct format for a best man's speech is as following: come up with a good opening line, thank any other speakers, congratulate the couple, praise the bride while making cracks on the groom, read messages from those who couldn't make it, and then quote something insightful before proposing a final toast. I don't know if the rest of you noticed or not, but clearly that's not going to happen. Much of that outline doesn't fit our situation - Sherlock certainly doesn't strike me as a blushing bride, anyways - and I'm nowhere near clever enough to invent an original, funny opener. Nobody else has really spoken before me, either, except the couple in question - thanks for saying your vows, I guess, or this would have been awkward." Most of the guests smiled at that. Mike, from down the table, gave him a thumbs up. "Congratulations, then, to Sherlock and John for having remained in eachother's company for an intense twenty plus years without killing eachother or going entirely insane. That alone is phenomenal - it's wonderful that you've made it here. We all couldn't be happier for you." Greg straightened up and cleared his throat. "I guess I can't really think of the right words to say. I'm rubbish at words, really. Probably because the best man is supposed to be the best friend of the man getting married, and though I'm serving as John's today, I know without a doubt that your best friend is the person sitting next to you. I'm just a stand in, though I do think I've gotten pretty close to you both over the last several decades of camaraderie. You won't find two crazier, intelligent, hard working, incredible men anywhere else in the world, and even though I'm just John's filler for today, I'm honored to be chosen. John, you're a great man and a great friend, and I wish you the best." Another short pause ensued in which Molly's husband caught his breath. He glanced over at her, and she lifted the corners of her mouth in encouragement. He appeared relieved at the prospect that he was doing alright. "I find myself in the situation where I have very few embarrassing stories on John and far too many for Sherlock - " Mycroft, from his position next to his mother and Harry, snorted loudly, disguising the undignified sound beneath a cough and sneeze. " - so I will bypass that altogether. I'm afraid Mr. Holmes would come into Molly and I's flat and smother me tonight if I attempted to poke fun at him during his own wedding, and I don't want to die just yet. There aren't any messages on the wedding itself, though a few of John's army mates sent personal emails about the occasion. In summation of all of them, they are saying 'good luck'. There's an undertone of 'if it all goes to shit, we can mug Sherlock at 3am', but I doubt that will be necessary. Anyone with eyes can see that he's just as devoted to John as John is to him, and that's the long and short of their relationship. It's not a 'jump' vs 'how high' scenario, but a delicate balance of wills, and even a genius like the one sprouted in Sherlock has to submit now and again. This is the partnership that we all aspire to, and romance is really just an added bonus. I've never seen two people so in tune to one another; it's astounding. As one random person on the internet once said, 'You may only be one person to the world, but you may also be the world to one person.' I believe the same is true today about Sherlock and John." Finally, he raised his glass. "To you. Have a great one."
"It's boiled noodles and canned sauce, but if that makes it sound more impressive, yes," he remarked, smiling. "I heard Rosie chatting up the movie marathon tonight while Sherlock and John were away and she invited me to join. I figured you wouldn't want to fuss over cooking yourself, after your shift, so . . . "
"As miraculous as it is, John, I haven't rested in over three days, and as soon as we get home we'll be back on the case. I'm not getting anything done now, so I might as well sleep."
Honestly, if they didn't get together before Rosie moved out, due to rugby alone, Molly would be surprised.
Hey, I hope everyone who made it this far has had fun reading this. It was pretty great to write, from my perspective; fanfiction really just gives me an outlet for creativity and a way to develop my personal style with prose, so it's beneficial from both ends. But I gotta say, it's readers who encourage me to keep going. Thanks for all the nice reviews and the few kudos I've gotten, it was much appreciated!
" . . . Did you know? That he . . . you know," the man mused, frazzled in a good way. "And you think it's a good idea? God, it came out of absolutely no where, and I have a feeling this is going to start moving all too fast, you know? And I'm terrified because I
A bit of a nasty shock for one doctor when Sherlock and his daughter, who had just gotten off of rugby practice, had showed up together at a crime scene.
"Obviously, one day. It's the inevitable conclusion to a long term, serious relationship." For once, though she couldn't quite tell, Rosie swore her Dad was blushing, or at the very least flustered.
? I know you didn't learn it when I was around. I think I would have noticed." The blonde smiles, a clever, crooked thing that soon becomes blinding in the thin, sterile hallway.
"Curiosity killed the cat, but satisfaction brought it back," Rosamund quipped, giving him a reassuring beam.
, after all - there were barely any arrangements, and where they were present, the buds were white and simple.
than myself. It's easy to be described as a great mind, but a good man is far rarer. I still don't know if I am there yet, but for you, John, I am trying to be one. For you are, undoubtedly, the best man I've ever met, and I'm never going to leave you alone. Never again." Molly would wager good money that the doctor was ready to kiss him, right there. Mrs. Holmes cooed, tears in her eyes, and Sherlock, upon seeing her bat at her face, rolled his eyes with incredible fondness before turning back to John. "Your turn, I'm afraid."
, heavens forbid - and bragging about how happy and well balanced and in touch their relatives were. Slowly, Rosamund began to realize that all the other girls had a family connected by blood, aunts and uncles that were actually related to eachother, and their parents were married.
"It's not exactly a secret that I like men and women, John, males in particular, even if I rarely feel attracted to anyone specific. It's intriguing personalities that I look for. So yes, I know how gay crushes work. I don't live under a rock."
"I think I always said it, throughout everything," he continued, everything muffled through John's shift sleeve. "The toast, especially. Even in all the planning. But seeing you and Mary, after your vows, with Lestrade and Molly and Mrs. Hudson, all smiling and occupied . . . I had just signed you away forever. You were Mary's, not mine. And that was when I knew that whatever I was feeling was never going to go away." He laughed without humor. "Emotions are so bloody
"Are you implying that I understand how this is going to work, John?" he had replied, almost smirking, though with nervousness filtering through. It was maddening, not being able to predict the outcomes of conversations; he usually never had these problems with John. "Please. I'm not that good."
"I'm here," Molly had declared from the entrance, hastily removing her things. "Sorry I didn't get to see off your fathers, but traffic was hellacious, and - "
shoving their noses in. And she was Rosie Watson, a girl much akin to a bloodhound when it came to sniffing out her fathers' relationship status, or lack thereof in the years previous. Nevertheless, this was the world they lived in, and nothing Molly could say or do would change them. It's simply in their nature.
"Well, I guess it's just you and me for a while, huh Rosie?" she says, making a concerted effort to smile. Surely this wouldn't take so long.
"As if anybody in London could stop you from playing. Where was that question at four this morning?" The detective grinned back, relaxing all of his numerous features, and he appeared years younger.
"I should hope so, John. For a very, very long while." This was how it started, he thinks. John's descent into a committed relationship once more was a startling, very ordinary conversation, and yet a lever had been pulled.
After that, Greg made an effort to come to every match, more to watch his top consulting detectives than anything else.
"Very, but can't anything be dull and petty in the right circumstance?" Rosamund scowled, though it didn't reach her eyes.
After many hours of dedicated contemplation, Sherlock Holmes did the unthinkable with this memory - he replayed it, over and over, before carefully shutting its door. Some things, despite his vast grasps of the explained and the deduced, could remain mysteries.
"Do you, Sherlock Holmes, take John Watson as your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, til death do you part?"
, when do we get to leave and go home? I have several experiments going on at the flat that I need to catalog."
The tea is nearly done, the kettle warm and letting boughts of steam loose in an almost cheerful fashion, and John is poorly humming as he lines up two old mugs. He pours in the liquid, letting it settle at the bottom and slosh around, sizzling. The cream disappears in after it, the rich whites churning until they are folded into a new color entirely, lathered in the aromas of mint. Lastly, sugar is added to each, sinking in with a satisfying plop, and John stirs each one with a spoon.
"Again, never gave it much thought. But sure, I guess I'd go out with a guy, but I'd have to really like the individual."
"Jessabelle Norton, actually, but close enough," Rosamund corrected, hefting her duffel bag. "I've got my stuff right here, so just pick me up at noon tomorrow. You have the address, Dad?"
now or never, actually, unless we had attempted to wait until tomorrow afternoon in the first place. I guess the bright side is that we caught him severely off guard, but hindsight really is 20/20, isn't it?"
"Oh, here's the good part! I love this episode," the teenager sighed, burying her face into Molly's shoulder and the couch cushions. "Ten is great."
Apparently not, as now they were tying the knot, and right before Rosie turned eighteen, no less. Certainly took them long enough.
"Yes, Rosie, I'm sure Sherlock is very sorry for jutting in," John murmured, sending a pointed look in the genius' direction. An impossibly small shrug, as was customary, was the only response. "And there's no pressure to decide anytime soon. But, if you'd like to be called 'Rosamund Watson-Holmes' on official documents, then we can arrange for that." The teenager stood up and pressed a kiss to the doctor's cheek.
authentic foul papers that would be worth a fortune, given nobody actually has a surviving copy of real ones until you claimed to. They're with the papers, I presume?"
"Sit down, it's starting," begs her niece, brandishing the remote much like a sword. "I've got snacks."
for the incredible blonde would skew everything. Hell, after him and Rosie first moved in, they took to sleeping together in the same bed out of necessity. John wasn't used to being on his own, sleeping in a bed alone, and establishing who would be getting up to comfort the infant was an ordeal of wills at 3am even without a staircase between them. Sherlock, though he was used to being secluded, had simply grown weary of being isolated, especially after cutting off contact with the outside would for the last several years, and his odd investigative sleep schedule made taking care of a weeping Rosie far more convenient. Having a crib and a single bed on the main floor, all in one room, simply made sense. And if their legs were tangled together and John's arm was flung over his chest in the middle of the night, or they found themselves locked in an embrace come morning due to a particularly bad nightmare (falling tailcoats, blood on the ground, bombs strapped to chests, and gut wrenching gunshots made for some riveting, horrifying dreams - the kind that have already come true), then that wasn't bad at all.
"221B carries sound remarkably well, wouldn't you agree?" comes the cold, analytical, yet somehow amused rumbling of another voice, and she nearly falls backwards when she realizes he's
Maybe it's not entirely true, but after five games - two of which she froze to death on the benches during - Molly feels as though she should have a vague idea of what is happening now.
"Figure this out," Sherlock had voiced in his usual deadpan, dropping a thin file over her lap and picking up his violin. "Think of it as a test run, or a practice for the real world." Then he began fingering his instrument, weaving over the strings with his bow and drowning in the music, and she realized he was beyond her reach.
"Alright, alright, we'll get you to your Dad," Molly murmured, picking up the child. Wordlessly, Mrs. Hudson dabbed at her face with a tissue, wiping away the snot. "It's going to be okay, Rosie."
"Molly, it doesn't matter if she's choosing to mess with you or not," Sherlock voiced, breaking away from his dismissals of Lestrade in order to join the conversation. "You've been with her for hours. We'll handle our daughter while you're gone."
"Shouldn't your Dad be making you food? Daddy's been working all day and would like to lie down." From behind the island, already pulling out a pan, the young girl scoffed.
"You're my best friend. Worst comes to worst, what, did you think I would just abandon you over one impulsive action?" he asked, moving his digits from his hair to his forehead. "And I liked it, I think." A small, almost impercievable smile comes to his face. "I liked kissing my best friend." The detective allowed that to sink in, replaying the words in his head.
"I think I died, slightly. I was never the same afterwards," John said finally, looking his partner dead in the eyes. "You're not the only one who fell apart, but at least you came back."
"Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to witness the union of Sherlock Holmes and John Watson," rambled the officiator, stopping often to push up his spectacles. Sherlock, wearing the same outfit as he did every day - a three piece suit, sans tie because he despised being choked - clearly wasn't paying attention to the man speaking. He was looking at John, observing thoughtfully as though to make sure he was still certain about this. He wanted to know John wasn't having doubts.
"Look, just look," she squealed, shoving the computer at Rosamund's lap with ferocity. Confused, the young Watson surveyed the page, coming to the bottom for a second time. Her eyes widened.
"Of course," Reyna intoned, shaking her head. "You enjoy these opportunities to show off, don't you?" Rosie snorted.
"John," he starts, wincing at the harshness of the words. Odd - the scratchy quality of his vocal chords projected implies that they haven't been utilized in at least a day or so. They are tinny, rumbling in a way that most people suffer through in the mornings. However, he is not most people, and he is almost always talking, keeping his baritone in practice unintentionally.
"Not to be presumptuous, but . . . like a date?" The words came out more awkward, and far, far more hopeful than she intended.
If you're still with me this far, again, the story will have about three components, it will be uploaded to once a week starting today, and you should really give me feedback because I thrive off of validation. It's one of the things I need to live.
Quickly, she skimmed over the details enclosed inside. The short of it was that a new play, a recently recovered Shakespeare script (more accurately, its foul papers, or the very first draft) that had never seen the light of day, was to be released in the fall by one historian Nathan Henderson. The play, performed by a hand selected cast of Henderson, was going to be viewed for the first time in a theater in a month or two, and the ticket sales were sure to be enormous. The majority of Shakespeare enthusiasts and researchers were raving about the find, and the original document was going to be printed in mass and then later sold itself. However, it seemed that some individuals had doubts to whether or not the manuscript was authentic or not.
"You know, one of these days you're going to have to come up with a new source of bait material. As genius as you are, brother dear, I believe the rest of London has already grown accustomed to your oh so witty cracks on my physical appearance," the man mused. "Be more creative."
Greg Lestrade, she never quite knew where to put on her family tree. Frankly, she was just honored to consider him as part of it, part of the family. He's been good to all of them, over the years, but he never quite fit the mold of 'brother' or 'close friend' or 'estranged cousin' like the other men in her life did. He's a bit of a wild card, and for now she's just contentedly shuffled him into the territory of 'best friend'. He's the closest she's got to one, she supposes. She doesn't have that many friends, and all of them are raving mad, anyways, but he jokes with her at every single one of Rosie's rugby games. He brings her coffee on the rare occasions he has to barge into the morgue for investigative duties, and he's always willing to listen to her or comment on her work or just
Mycroft without going bloody wankers. God, they're both hard enough to handle on their own, but can you imagine what it must have been like to wrangle the both at age five? And then their teenage years . . ." John's face was the depiction of pure terror. "It's a miracle they're survived this long, actually. Or past the first ten years of parenthood, period."
"We're . . . we're like the closest of friends, but better," John tried, attempting to explain their dynamic. "I don't . . . there's no real way to put it into sentences, Rosie. He's just the person I trust more than anybody else, the person I always want at my side. I haven't thought about having feelings for anyone that way since your mother left us. I've been too focused on work and you and making sure Sherlock doesn't run himself into the ground."
"That was brilliant," he completes, letting go of a breathy chuckle. "I haven't been snogged like that in years." Sherlock clears his throat weakly.
"I'm so happy you're still alive, you idiot," he says, and it's not some grand gesture or romantic intonation, but it
"Of course." As they leave through the door, Sherlock pauses, slipping on his coat and turning back towards Molly. "And, we will."
It was at this time that Molly made her escape, shaking her head and slipping out the door unnoticed.
"Mmm. Yes, well, you didn't marry Mycroft, did you? Clearly spending forever in his presence wasn't your plan."
"Does it change anything, knowing that I love your dad? Rosie, I know you consider me a . . . parental figure, despite all odds, and I don't want to - "
"Well . . . I talked to a girl named Reyna today. She's a year older than me and wore red shoes, but the laces were all funny. She probably wears them a lot because she tugs the laces all the time, which was what made them look so strange. I think she likes running." She looked down at her own feet. "I like Reyna. She was nice."
Molly finds it terrifying. She has witnessed the matchmaking frenzies her niece can create - she doesn't wish to be the subject of one.
"Yup." The both sipped their beverages again, this time in unison. Mycroft, from his quiet holding on the couch, carefully watched them, looking down at his glass and frowning when he realized it was empty after only five minutes.
" . . . I mean, I've never given your sexuality much thought, or my own for that matter, but that's fine. I guess I'm the same. It's more the person than the gender that I care about, even though I'm more inclined towards women. I just never . . . I don't know, met a bloke I fancied like that."
In a surge of endorphins (he refuses to admit that chemical balances may have had nothing to do with it, so endorphins it is), he propels his face upwards in order to capture John Watson's lips.
"You guys can watch me play together!" Rosamund tells them when she makes the team - she's always had a way of picking things up effortlessly, and rugby tryouts turned out to be no different. John, who was quite the rugby player back in high school and uni, beams at his daughter like she's just invented the cure for cancer, and Sherlock nods and says something along the lines of 'sports are wonderful for blood flow', which is technically approval. Molly, of course, simply hugged the blonde preteen and muttered, "I knew you could do it," into her ear.
She was done. This was it. She was entirely prepared to go inside, slap the consulting detective for adding another annoyance to her day of constant annoyances, and head back home.
. "You make a telly marathon at your flat sound like some sort of favor." He scratches the back of his neck.
"How did you know where he lived? He didn't say where in London he resided," Reyna commented halfway through the trip, giving her best mate an inquisitive look.
"Rosie, dear, you said you wanted your da, didn't you?" the brunette repeated, brow knit in confusion.
"Hi, Molly," comes the voice of Lestrade, partnered with a friendly smile and a styrofoam cup in hand. Clearly, he hadn't been able to avoid the sale. "How are you?"
For starters, the Holmes family is just not made for love. His parents, being normal enough, managed to be happy together, but Sherlock is utterly convinced that this was a fluke. Him and Mycroft, despite their spheres of influence, would never taste that sort of belonging. They were too distant, too estranged, too eccentric and needy - in other words, too
, always so loving, and shines like the sun. His job is to help people at the hospital, but he also investigates with Sherlock, which makes him extra cool. He's always happy to see her, even when it's so clear by the way his tie is crooked and his sweater is drooping that he's tired and annoyed and just wants to eat something before he collapses. He's John Watson, and he's one of her favorite people in the whole wide world.
, as un-sportsminded as he was, explained its rules over and over again, the information never clicked.
"I don't know what you were thinking, but I am not the type to take things lightly in a relationship. I'm rather all or nothing, I'm afraid. A bit of a turn off for all the girls I used to go with," he said, pausing as if sorting through memories. "It rarely lasted wrong. I'm not going to lie, I'm rather new to this. Never really considered blokes. But I'm here, until the finish line, if you are." There was an unspoken question lying in the air, and '
"Yes?" he says, combating a yawn fiercely. His limbs still droop, the sleep clinging to them, and his eyelids are struggling to remain peeled back.
"John! I require your immediate assistance!" comes a haughty, unmistakable voice from the other room, and with a sigh, John turns away from the brunette currently holding his child.
About thirty minutes in, Greg stood up and tapped on his glass with his spoon. Many people were confused by this, as there hadn't seemed to be any reason to interrupt the endless eating. However, the traditional speech of the best man wasn't delivered yet, and it had been proposed that it be given in the middle of the brunch so everyone would already be silent and stuffing their faces. Unorthodox, yes, but wasn't everything revolving around John and Sherlock?
school," she repeated, her blonde curls bouncing around her face as if they, too, were indignant. "It's
This is the first half of the ending, set with Molly and Sherlock's experiences. If you bother to read the forewords, know that it's been a pleasure getting to repost this story and seeing the response. Though small, the audience for this story is great. Thanks for enjoying, and please have fun in the next section.
"Elementary," she told the blonde, not letting her grip on the young detective's hand waver for even a second.
"Um, strawberry, if you're serious," the doctor answered, and his partner gave him a look bordering on the incredulous. "Honestly, Sherlock, if you two insist on feuding every time you see eachother and if I have to put up with dismembered heads beneath the cabinets and moldy fingers in the fridge I will at least poach free muffins from your brother." He frowned but didn't object. "Mycroft, since you clearly aren't going to leave yet, would you like some tea? I can make another cup."
die, actually, and we're still together. If we can make it through that, I doubt the rigors of marriage are going to stop us." Sherlock smiled, faintly, and John laughed. "So, instead of talking about how great you are, I'm going to talk about how great you've made me. I would be dead about a thousand times over if you hadn't been there alongside me. I wouldn't have had nearly as much success, and I certainly would have relapsed. Unfortunate, but no doubt true - you were the anchor that grounded me, that told me to pick up my messes, that forced tea and sandwiches down my throat, that made sure I actually slept occasionally. I would never have been anything
"Food's ready!" Lestrade called instead, and as she walked up to the kitchen she saw that he had a pot on the stove. It was filled with spaghetti, not entrails, for once, and it smelled like it was made for human consumption.
What was less hilarious, though, was the fact that John instantly started choking on air the instant he understood what was happening. Sherlock stood next to him, awkwardly patting his back and generally looking very concerned. This continued for another five minutes while Molly spectated, resisting the urge to call Greg and inform him of this new development.
"That was really nice, Aunt Molly," she murmured, beaming from across the table. The order of seating had been Clara, Harriet, Mycroft, Mrs. Holmes, Mr. Holmes, Reyna and Rosie, inseparable as they were, John, and then Sherlock on one side of the stone. On the opposite were John's hospital buddies, both of which were talking avidly to Clara and Harriet, Sarah, also known as one of the few people who
John never shoved him off or frowned or jerked abruptly in surprise at these strange notions. Instead, he reveled in them, savored them, the acts of acceptance and enjoyment written in everything he did.
for this I'm about to die. Don't worry, you can bunk on the other side of my bed. My dads don't mind that I'm stealing you away for the duration of the weekend, as you'll probably make sure I eat proper meals and look away from the documents periodically." She took a deep breath, blue eyes flashing with something that could only be described as pure joy. "Oh, and thanks for dropping everything to help me with this. In case I forget to say it later." Reyna, with a dramatic sigh, smiled.
"You've hardly ever been on the line before, either." He took a deep breath. "I'm not going to demand anything from you, Watson. You deserve better. But, perhaps, would you consider me? Is there a way you could possibly push past your many grievances - bloody hell, John, don't
They made due to the best of their abilities, really - Rosie wasn't ever neglected or anything. They tried to give her structured attention and meals and nap times. In fact, John and Rosie had moved back into 221B. This was for a variety of reasons. Convenience of proximity to Sherlock and to work were major factors, Mary's absence another. The army doctor was much better - honestly, he was astoundingly fine, given his easy ability to get attached to everyone - but still, seeing the flat that him and his wife made a life together in caused his eyes to droop, his pace to slow. It dragged him down, every single inch of him, ever so slightly, and Mary would never want him to suffer.
"That was . . ." the blonde begins, running a palm through his locks with wide eyes. He doesn't quite know how to finish, though, so instead he blushes a bright scarlet at the memory that took place only moments ago. "That, I mean . . ." Sherlock winces, anticipating the worst.
They arrive at the stranger's flat after another fifteen minutes and thirty one seconds on the dot. Reyna wraps her knuckles on the door swiftly, and yet there was no response but the pitter patter of an approaching dog's lumbering footsteps, the pads clattering on the hardwood in succession.
"No, no, it's fine. I'm being ridiculous," she sighed in agreement, giving the pooch one last pat on the head before getting up. The reluctance was evident on her face, however, and the runner reached out and squeezed her shoulder.
Her bed was waiting, and frankly, she could ponder over the logistics of the Watson-Holmes household later.
"Thank god you're here, Molly," the doctor breathed, readjusting his grip on his daughter. "Lestrade just begged us to take on two new murder cases -
. And Sherlock, though he fights so hard against the ideals of sentiment, certainly acts the closest to affectionate he can get when it comes to Watson and his daughter, who was practically the detective's daughter, too, at this point. To any outsider, the dynamic was obvious, if not complex.
"I'm rather partial to Capaldi, myself," she hummed, immersing herself in the telly program. "He's my favorite version, I believe."
"Daddy, Dad, we're going out. Don't shag on the kitchen counter while I'm gone," Rosamund yelled, already halfway down the stairs. John made an imploring noise of confusion from the depths of the kitchen, though it was impossible to tell if this was the response to her absence or to the miraculous discovery of another one of Sherlock's mad experiments. They piled into the back of a cab and headed off towards Nathan Henderson's lodgings.
And somewhere along the way, Rosie and John had stopped being Rosie and John, his close friends. They were his daughter and his partner, in every sense of the word, and damn it all if Sherlock Holmes would let
"Fun," he replies simply, with no further explanation. A smile quirks at the edges of his lips. "Perhaps a minuscule observation or two." Molly slapped him on the chest, regardless.
Except for her friends, of course. She had Mrs. Hudson, who was practically another mother, and John, who was quite a kind, strong man, and she fancied him as something of a brother, if she had ever had one. Sherlock was slightly harder to place, as she used to have a crush the size of the moon on him for ages, but eventually she learned to consider him as a close friend, if not an easily disgruntled one, or perhaps the person her 'brother' was dating. Their feelings were far from platonic, anyways, so that part didn't much matter. Mycroft, in the few times she had met him, came off as a well-meaning, slightly odd and severe, estranged cousin. He cared, but at a concealed distance - it's far less easy to get hurt that way, but she knew Mycroft did love them, in his own strange version. Their parents, Sherlock and Mycroft's, were delightful, almost like in laws, which she obviously didn't possess yet, as one needs to be married to have in laws.
"Rosie, I . . . " The usually sunshine bright, always-wonderful-at-comforting-phrases John Watson was at a loss for words. "I . . . no, Rosie, me and Sherlock aren't married, sweetheart. We're your parents, yes, and don't ever doubt that we love you for a second, but . . ."
"Well, maybe bringing Ro to the place where a family was just brutally murdered several hours ago didn't have much appeal." Sherlock snorted loudly.
"Wait, dinner's on the table? She made dinner?" Watson repeated to himself after she left. He turned to Sherlock. "Did you know about this?"
"It sounds like school can be rather interesting after all, if you look for something to occupy yourself with," Sherlock smiled, ruffling her fair curls. Her eyes widened.
"You've got such a nice family, sir," she mentioned, beaming softly. Lestrade lifted an eyebrow but didn't correct her, turning around with the tickets (he had insisted on buying for all of them, which was typical, actually - damn him and his
"I'm going to kiss you now," Watson had declared suddenly, and Holmes had lifted an eyebrow but hadn't protested.
"Reyna, I'm bored," she bemoaned, getting up off her bed. Currently lying next to her was the girl in question, who shoved her friend in response.
"I'm hungry," Rosie proclaims loudly, finally wiggling free of her father's grip and running towards the kitchen. "Daddy, can you make mac and cheese?"
Everything is blissfully abnormal again, and it suits their family like a glove, she supposes. Just the three of them.
, for the last time - he really must get used to it) is up again, brewing tea in a new peppermint blend that he has been particularly fond of. Frankly, Sherlock cannot fathom why this is - he enjoys tea greatly, but this variant of peppermint is hardly different from any other brand, but John has declared it 'the best'. Then again, John has also declared him the best for quite a while, and he hasn't figured that mystery out either. He never wants to.
