"We'll see about that," he tapped the screen and brought the phone to his ear. "Hello?" A pause. "No, I am not." Another pause. "She doesn't want to talk to you." Pause. "Who am I? Well, I'm the guy who's going to snipe your ass if you try to call this number again." Dante must have said something that made Clint roll his eyes. "Your ex works for Iron Man, genius. She has dangerous friends. Call again and you're dead." He then hung up and handed the phone back to her. "If he keeps calling you, have Natasha answer the phone. She's a master at the art of death threats." Lara took the phone back, completely stunned.
"Yeah," he said. "I know, but what kind of relationship? Are we boyfriends, lovers, friends with benefits? Help me out here."
"JARVIS," she said once she was able to form coherent words. "Where is everyone?"
Steve thought.
"It's not that," he said. "I don't think I'm legally allowed to
"What's wrong?" he asked. "Are you going to be sick?" Steve swallowed and shook his head.
"What makes you so sure that Tony will know what to do?" Natasha shrugged.
"No," Tony said sarcastically. "I feel amazing. The only way that could have gone better is if a barbershop quartet delivered the news."
"Indeed, I do," JARVIS confirmed.
"What do you mean?" Bruce asked.
His heart was beating normally (or what substitutes for normal when you have a cluster of shrapnel embedded in your chest), he was breathing fine, and as far as he could tell he had no critical, life-threatening injuries. All that Tony had JARVIS reassure him of at least five times since he set foot back in the tower, but it only served to scare him even more. Why? Because if nothing was wrong with him, why did it feel like everything was wrong with him?
"How urgent?" Fury asked.
Getting in the elevator (which had apparently been fixed) Tony tried to reach around five other people to hit the button for his floor. A police officer smacked the back of his hand painfully.
"Did Oswin ever mention anyone by the name of Vasyl Knežević?" To Duran's surprise, Nina's face lit up with instant recognition.
"Oh my gosh, all of the lines are straight," Lara exclaimed. "You don't have a ruler! How did you do that?"
"You were clearly prying for information, though." Everhart shook her head.
"Brutal," Natasha offered.
"What do you mean the beach is…" That's all Tony heard coming out of Steve's mouth before everything went dark.
take a secret like that lightly. Even if he died before her (which he technically almost did,) she'd be sure to take it to her grave and have it buried with her very well and good, so no one would ever find it. Yet, she had told Tony. Why? What had happened that pushed Peggy to reveal that and if Tony knew why didn't he tell S.H.I.E.L.D. or any of these doctors what he was?
"Yeah," she said. "Not the brightest moment in my thirty-six years of life."
"Yeah," Lara said. "A year ago! You can stand on that leg just fine! It's not an excuse!"
"Hey," Pepper said with a note of concern in her voice. "What's wrong?"
"Did Steve tell you?" Clint shook his head.
"Yeah," Clint said. "I'm not sure you can tell with the camera's quality, but…" He lifted the dog so she could see the underside of his chest and more importantly his front legs. …Or rather leg and stump. "He only has three legs." Laura let out a sympathetic "oh."
"To Coulson." With that, their glasses clinked together, and everything fell silent again as they took sips off their respective soft drinks. Tony felt the corners of his lips raise as he looked around the table. At that point, it truly sunk in.
"Still, you shouldn't have taken them off," Tony pointed out as he began to pour two glasses of champagne for him and Pepper. "So, your fault, just like that little security snafu we had last week."
"Yeah," Carol said with a small nod. "Yeah, I am. Just… Thank you." Tony's confusion only deepened.
"It's alright, Anne." The hug was a little awkward since Steve's mom had to practically lean over the other woman's pregnant belly. "Thank you for listening. You have no idea how much that means to me."
"You heard that?" Tony nodded with a none-too-pleased look on his face. "Yes."
"I know all that," Steve said. "And unfortunately, I think I'll just leave him be and trust the US government to arrest him should he ever come stateside." Tony frowned.
"It wasn't," Betty said. "But never mind that. Other than that character defect, what else do you have in common?"
"Hello," he heard Oswin's voice say through the laptop's speakers, breaking him out of his internal rage-filled monologue. On screen, he had a nice view of Oswin's white running shoes and the pavement of the city sidewalk. They had decided that it would be best to park a few blocks away and have Oswin walk there alone. If she needed to make a quick getaway, she would let him know. "Testing, testing! One, two, three! Can you hear me?"
"Smart," Carol remarked. "So, is this what you wanted to talk to me about? Reassuring me that I'm not going to be locked away for a crime I could potentially commit?"
"I didn't get anything in the mail from you," Steve said. "You gave me all your presents in person."
"Because I learned how," Tony said.
The conversation went on for another good forty-five minutes. Tony told Steve a bit about how he had been captured in Afghanistan the previous year and the whole Iron Man story. Steve could tell that Tony left a few things out but didn't say anything about it. Obviously, he wasn't ready to share certain details with him (or anyone, really) so he didn't push.
Remember kids, don't fuck with Carol Danvers.
"Look, you can't pull me out of this right now," she said into the phone.
"Sure," Duran said. "I can go back and ask one of the officers if she's been accounted for. What's her name?"
"Don't be," Clint said. "I'm fine. We haven't started going on missions yet, so there's nothing to be worried about."
"I don't understand," Cap said. "What just happened?"
Steve's eyes narrowed a slight bit more, but he complied, sitting back down in his seat. Pepper moved to sit in the seat Lara vacated across from him. She crossed her legs, tightly clasped her hands together and her shoulders were tense, and she contemplated what she was going to say. The omnificence of it was too much for Steve to bear. He was just about to break and ask what was wrong with Tony when she finally found the words to say.
"Who?" Sharpton let out a piercing cry at the demand, but other more helpful sounds quickly followed it.
"I need to go home." Steve looked at him with a puzzled expression.
"Well, you won't be here, so you wouldn't know," Tony pointed out.
"Hey," Steve said softly. "Can you stand?"
After he got out of the shower, Tony got another call from Coulson, giving him an address where he and Fury could safely meet. Being mindful of the fact that he and Pepper had a ten AM flight back to Los Angeles, Tony had Happy drive him to the location.
"I'm pretty sure we told you yesterday that she was the one who was going to be interviewing you guys," she said. "You didn't have a problem with it then.
"Four point eight one." Stark fell silent. "That's the highest I've ever registered as."
"That's okay," she said.
"Anacin?" Pepper questioned. "Didn't they stop making that in the 70's?"
Lara was sitting on the floor, playing a game of keep-away with the dog. She wasn't being mean about it. She held a bright green and pink tennis ball in her hand and held it high enough so it would be just out of Lucky's reach if he sat or stood normally, but he'd easily be able to get to it if he stood up on his hind legs or jumped. Lucky didn't seem to get that though, or at least was just intent on using a different strategy to get what he wanted. He looked up at Lara with big, wide, puppy-dog eyes, silently pleading with her to let go of the ball. It was a sound strategy and had worked for Lucky in the past, but this time, Lara was not budging.
"I'm going to make a few phone calls," she said. "You two going to be fine here on your own?"
"You okay, ma'am?" Pushing down the feelings of sickness, Lara slowly forced herself to nod.
"No thank you," Bruce answered before Lara could. "We're good."
"I wouldn't expect anything less," she said. "So, which way goes out?"
Tony wasn't sure if he got any sleep or not when he got up that morning. He knew it was dark out when he was on the phone with Coulson, but when he finally opened his eyes again it was daylight. He supposed that probably meant he got at least something resembling a peaceful, dreamless sleep, but at the same time his body felt as though he hadn't slept at all, which was great. On the bright side, at least he didn't have to use the wastebasket at any point.
"It's still nice, though," Tony muttered into Steve's shoulder softly. They remained like that for another minute before Tony once again had to reluctantly pull back. He made sure to take a deep breath and savor the moment before doing so, though.
"Are you okay?" Tony shrugged.
"This computer contains a database of every species of animal in this galaxy and every galaxy known," Carol said. "If it exists, everything about it would have been indexed, including its venom and any anti-venoms."
Happy New Year!
"The ayes have it," she said. "Motion carries."
"It's a possibility," Rawls admitted. "There are other possibilities such as an autoimmune disorder, leukemia, blood disorder, but most commonly these symptoms are an indicator of an HIV infection, which is why I have to ask when the last time was you were tested for HIV/AIDS, Mr. Stark?"
"Well, yeah," Clint said. "The first instinct is the gut instinct; always dependable."
"There was this one boy there," Steve's mom continued. "He couldn't have been much older than Steve and Bucky. Twelve? Thirteen, maybe? I don't know what was wrong with him, but five nurses were holding him down to a mattress while a doctor stuck a needle in his eye. When he was done, he pulled the needle out and the kid was still. If the doctor didn't check for a pulse himself, I would have thought the kid was dead."
It took less than two minutes for Steve to take care of everything before climbing in on the other side of the bed. Within an instant, Tony was curling up against his side and pressing yet another kiss to his cheek.
It's about time that Tony and Natasha had a talk, don't you think?
"You're going to make yourself worse if you don't."
Once he deemed Tony's hair clean enough, Steve moved on to his body. He was careful to be gentle with or entirely avoid the sensitive areas Tony warned him about (such as the Arc Reactor) and for that, he was grateful. However, if Steve running his fingers through his hair sent him into ecstasy, then there were no words to describe what him running his hands over his body with a washcloth did. Well, outside of making his already dirty mind run rampant. When Steve finished with one last quick sweep over his body, Tony couldn't help but respond by tackling him into a heated kiss that caused Steve to tumble backwards into the glass. Then, he repaid him in kind by washing down his body as well, the entire time hoping that it gave Steve as much pleasure as he had experienced himself.
I feel like I made myself diabetic while writing this chapter. Like, seriously, it's like I pounded back an entire jar of marshmallow fluff in one sitting. If anyone else feels that way, I'm sorry. I actually know what that feels like because I did that once when I was six. Not a pleasant feeling, but you did enjoy the sweetness of it at the time.
Steve is probably a bit OOC this chapter, but blame it on the valium. Have you ever been on that stuff? All it does is make you feel confused and tired. I don't know how people get addicted to it, but they do!
"That doesn't fit the symptoms," she said.
As soon as the office door closed, Fury had the room locked down in secure mode. Hill watched as he pushed back a secret panel in the wall, punched a code in on a key pad, and scanned his eye. This revealed another secret panel in the wall, this one containing a safe. Fury took the papers from inside his coat and quickly scanned them over. Expressionlessly, he opened the safe, added the papers to a folder filled with dozens of others, put the folder back inside, locked up everything and set it all back to normal.
So, she was left to find other means of entertainment, causing her to resort to mattress tag origami.
The screen went black before automatically shutting down. Tony leaned back in his chair and completely undid his tie.
"I was wondering if you'd be willing to talk about something later?" Clint could see the space between Tony's eyebrows narrow.
"Yeah." He pushed back into his seat somewhat uncomfortably. "I know I shouldn't be but… I can't stop." Beside him, he could see Pepper slip her bookmark between the pages before turning to face him.
However, Tony was slightly suspicious as to why the phone wouldn't dial and found himself going through his contacts, trying to see if he could get through to anyone at all. Lara, busy signal. Steve, busy signal. Pepper, busy signal. Rhodey, busy signal. It didn't take a genius to figure out by that point that S.H.I.E.L.D. must have some sort of signal-jammer somewhere on the boat and he couldn't get calls out, and more importantly, he couldn't get calls in. He should probably consider it a miracle that he got those texts from Lara at all. He wouldn't be surprised if she had tried to call him multiple times and was unable to get through. In fact, he even tried to use JARVIS but found the AI to be unresponsive.
"You know, Oswin tried to warn me about this," Knežević said. "She said by robbing you we'd essentially be asking for you to show up in your Iron Man armor and kick out asses. I'm just surprised it took you this long."
"We're headed back to Avengers Tower," she said. "The CDC cleared it, so it's safe to go back inside."
So, here they were. Steve did everything he could not look in Tony's direction. He was afraid if he even looked at Tony the wrong way, there'd be some sort of problem. So, instead, he kept his gaze fixed on a random point in front of him. The only times he took his eyes away from that was when he periodically looked over at Loki just to make sure that the prisoner was behaving.
"Positive," he said firmly.
Once her mind calmed, Carol began looking for any way to distract herself. She'd already been waiting for quite a bit of time and she was wondering where that doctor was. She ran her fingers through her hair and was disgusted to find that the ends of it were rather dry and brittle. Pulling a few strands closer to her face, she rubbed them between her fingers and watched as it disintegrated right before her eyes.
"Why did you agree to this, then?" For the first time, Dr. Cranston's face fell.
"Bye." After that, the line went dead. Bruce pulled the phone away from his ear.
"To Coulson," they said unanimously. Slowly, Clint raised his glass.
"No, it's still around." Tony wasn't sure about that but brushed it aside.
"We're asking politely," Natasha said. "Would you please show us your security camera feed from last night."
"Saved them for what?" Adoniram questioned. "To rot away in prison? To have all our power stripped from us? Is that it?"
"I don't think I can," he answered. "That's more secret S.H.I.E.L.D. stuff. I probably can't comment on that." Everhart looked annoyed.
Lara accepted the medium-sized cup in one hand and reached for the plastic spoon with the other, or at least tried to. She found her other hand to already be occupied by a stack of papers; the packet that Lucy had given her. When she went to set them aside, she caught sight of the cover page. There, written in the bold text was
"I guess so," Bruce said. "I mean, the total amount of time we've all known each other probably only tallies up to about a week, but we did save the world together, so that has to account for something."
"Like what?" he asked.
Steve laid down but didn't get under the covers or touch Tony, which made him frown. Again, he felt like he was waiting for an explosion. He knew the words were coming, and he just wanted to have them out there.
"Yeah," Steve agreed. "Hopefully."
"Sir, you have an incoming call from Col. Rhodes." Tony frowned.
Once again, things were quiet for a while. That worried Knežević at first, but he realized that if she were caught by security, he probably would have heard something by now. So, he resigned himself to staring at a black screen and ate his chips. This was turning out to be a boring show.
"You're not supposed to answer a stalker," Lara explained. "It only encourages them." Clint frowned and made a "hand it over" motion with his hand.
Searching through the room, he eventually found a blank yellow legal pad and set it down on the desk in front of him. Taking a pen in his left hand, he again touched the shard with his right, bringing him back to the platform in the sea.
"You used your real name to register here," she said. "Fury has a program set up to alert him if a person of interest shows up in hospital registries or police arrest records. You're one of those people." Oh, so maybe she hadn't messed up as bad as she thought.
Just as Tony and Steve started to lean in for their fourth kiss, another door banged open and footsteps could be heard entering the penthouse.
"We are going to take our campaign against Stark and the Avengers to the next level." Salinas frowned.
"What happened?"
"I need some air," was all Steve said before exiting the room.
"This isn't funny, Tony," Steve said. "You're absolutely out-of-your-mind drunk. You could have really hurt yourself."
"That was kind of low," Happy said. "Bringing up her ex like that." Tony shrugged.
to speak for him."
"Yeah," he said. "Thank you." Tony smiled warmly.
"Why?" she asked.
Yeah, please ignore any issues regarding time-zones in the next couple of chapters. I don't have a good understanding of how they work and the public education system failed me. Thanks, Clinton, Bush, and Obama.
"Yup!" Cooper exclaimed.
"Gah," he groaned. "Drive a knife through my heart, why don't you?"
"No," Lorraine said. "I don't think that would be a good idea either." Knežević was left physically shaking from that blow.
"Because she knew I worked as your personal assistant in the past…"
"Thanks!"
It took a little bit, especially considering Tony wasn't doing much to help Steve out by walking with his eyes closed, but eventually, they made it to the car. The man Tony identified as Happy (odd name but Steve's heard odder) didn't seem surprised that Tony was struggling to stay upright. He did raise an odd eyebrow at Steve, though.
"I didn't agree to that," Clint said.
"Not to this extent," Natasha said. "Not to where I'm stepping out of line and threatening people; coming close to killing them."
"Steve," she said. "Please just take a breath and calm down. We're going to find Tony. That's a promise. There's no need to panic. We're going to find him and he's going to be fine."
"So?" Tony said. "I'm not eating rabbit food."
"There's nothing I can't wrap my head around," Tony said. "But short of a miracle, the only explanation that makes is that this is a trick, and if it is a trick then why you're tricking me doesn't make sense."
"I know," Steve said. "That's part of the reason why I thought you thought I was too afraid…"
In conclusion, Iron Man is absolutely recommended for the Avengers Initiative and world prove essential in completing its goals. However, Tony Stark is not recommended at this time.
Clint scooped up the puppy from where he was curled up next to him.
to go." He gestured around the room. "All of you skipped out on your second round of interviews yesterday. Do you know how that looks?"
"The Disciple's Wing?" He was practically stuttering with shock. "But, Brother Daniel, I just lost my job. Shouldn't I be moving to the Proles' Center?"
When Clint opened his eyes, his head felt groggy. He had no idea how long he'd been out for. His nose was stuffed up and his throat hurt a bit, but it was nothing compared to the awful dream that he had.
"I'm aware of that, sir," she said.
"No," she said. "And you're probably not going to."
Tony held her gaze for another moment or so before relenting. Pepper finished collecting the papers before promising to be back with food. She then turned and headed out the door. By that point, Lara had left too, leaving Tony completely alone.
"Well, first we interview you face-to-face. Second, our assessment consists entirely of statements you can agree to or disagree with. It makes things a lot simpler and much more precise."
Tony frowned. He didn't feel too hopeful.
"No, no it's fine," Lara assured. "It's just… An argument he made reminded me of something I'd rather forget. That's all it was. Not something worth talking about." Bruce gave her a concerned look but nonetheless nodded in understanding.
He could, however, examine the letter from inside the box. It was see-though and had magnifying lenses on top, but he really couldn't examine it any closer than that. There were still details he could he could make out, though, like that the letter was addressed to the Avengers and whoever wrote it had very neat, careful handwriting. They wanted to make sure the letter arrived at its intended destination without any mistakes.
The two of them made their way into the elevator, silent the whole time. Looking at Steve, Tony couldn't help but feel a little guilty for what he told him earlier. Since he had the opportunity, Tony thought it best to make good use of it.
"No problem, and please call me Carol."
Thank you to nousername123, Trylissia, Dragon Queen Niji, and guest reviewer Star for the favorites, follows, and reviews on FFN and FriedChickenNisha for the comment and Princessvibes and the guest who left kudos on AO3! All of your feedback really means a lot! :)
"Alright, then." Tony patted the empty space next to him. "Why don't you have a seat, Captain?" Steve's eyebrows raised, and he looked like he was trying to will his face not to change color.
"Yeah," Tony said. "Then you get your Cube back. No muss, no fuss." Suddenly the holographic screen pinged, and a file opened in front of them. "What is Phase Two?" Tony asked as he skimmed the information coming up on the screen. His attention was taken away from the screen when he heard a loud metal
"Okay," Tony said. "We'll leave you be." Tony slowly started stepping towards the door and gestured for Lara to follow him.
"I would have to strongly advise against that, Agent Barton." Clint shrugged and climbed up on the hospital bed.
He knew where he needed to start. He needed to stop drinking, at least for now. Although pangs of denial rippled throughout his brain, Tony knew that even if it wasn't a "problem," it needed to stop. He couldn't protect anyone if he was trashed. That was kind of a given, and now that the alcohol had been eliminated from the apartment, Tony knew what the next step had to be.
"Just be here." Steve's only response was to wrap his arms around Tony and kiss the top of his head.
Remember kids, the Burger King is always watching you, especially when you're sleeping.
"You still don't know that?" she asked as she walked over and plucked the clipboard from Tony's hands.
Adoniram frowned.
successor, meaning that she wasn't under Mr. Stark's direct employment at the time and doesn't know the damage this woman has caused." Romanoff responded before Pepper could stop her.
"But that's not what we're going to be doing," Natasha said. "I cannot stress that enough." Steve nodded.
"Yeah," he said. "I think so."
"Uh, good morning, sir." Clint tried to sound as pleasant as he could, but the look of pure fury on his face made it clear that being pleasant wasn't going to be helpful. "Or maybe not so much."
Lara frowned and tried to think back. She tried to remember where she saw the symbol, but she just drew a complete blank. She ran through every symbol she could think of in her mind – from company logos to the various symbols and insignias related to terrorist groups that the Secret Service had her memorize – but she got the feeling that this wasn't anything like that. Shoulders sagging, she let out a defeated sigh.
"No." She was on anti-depressants for a reason, after all. Carl didn't show any signs of confusion or alarm at the response.
A few people got aggravated that they were stopped in the middle of the stairs talking and pushed around them, calling them even more creatively colorful names as they did so. Realizing that they were creating an obstruction, Lara began to reach for Bruce's hand, but then thought better of it. Instead, she jerked her head in the direction of the flow of the crowd.
"What is with people today?" Before he could question him further, Natasha and Bruce walked into the room. Nat scowled at Clint as she took the seat between Clint and Steve. Bruce just shook his head, shut the door behind him, and took the seat to the right of Tony.
"How bad was it?" Concern and dread were building up in Pepper's eyes.
"We're working the same case," Duran pointed out. "I think it'd be best if we maintained contact with each other and exchanged information, don't you?"
"So," Peggy said. "Do you feel like telling me why you ran out of the party?" Tony still said nothing. "It's fine if you don't. We can just sit here all night, saying nothing. I don't mind."
"About that," Freeman said. "Do you think it's necessary to do that?" Instantly the laughter stopped, and Adoniram's face fell.
"Regardless," Freeman said. "There is now a search that needs to be called off. If you can leave me to do that, I'll leave you to get ready."
Finding the switch, Steve flipped it on and light-filled the room. He expected to hear some groan of pain or grumble of annoyance, but he was met with silence. Opening the door further, he saw why. Absolutely no one was in there. Frowning, he turned back.
While the six Avengers were parting ways, they all found themselves vowing that no matter how far apart they were, no matter what happened, if the Earth needed them, they'd be there.
A letter was opened containing a fine, white powder, exposing Clint, Tony, Steve, and Natasha. Clint and Tony have been taken away by the CDC as they are the most likely to have contracted whatever disease may be inside. Meanwhile, Avengers Tower has been evacuated.
"That can't be right," she said.
"Thanks, J."
"Let me guess, it starts with a 'b.'"
"I'm not sure," Tony said. "But it involved cops." Fury let out an aggravated sigh and shook his head.
. For a second, he wondered if this is what death was like. He quickly dismissed it though. It may be black, quiet, and cold, but Steve still felt
Thus, Steve had no choice but to try to force himself to relax. That was obviously easier said than done, but he still had to try. He kept reminding himself that Tony agreed to see the doctor voluntarily and if anything was seriously wrong, they would have heard a commotion coming from the other room by now. Tony
Remember kids, in real life, you don't want to go unfreezing people from ice. The curse of Ötzi is very much real. (Look it up.)
Which led to this moment: Tarquan listened as the Kree walked by, thankfully having not noticed his presence. He allowed himself to release a breath of relief before slinking out of his hiding place, heading towards the escape pods.
A part of her could not believe it. Although she had worked at Stark Industries previously, nothing like this had ever occurred. She remembered that the board meetings she had attended in that time had been amicable at the very least. However, now looking back she realized that there was always a bit of tension lingering beneath the surface. Perhaps all of this was just that tension boiling over? Something told Natasha, though, that this probably was not the case. Lara had warned her that these board meetings could be a little rough and Nat was certain she would not say that unless there was a reason.
"An opportunity?" Bruce questioned. "For what?"
During the time it took him to walk to the fridge and back, an idea sparked in his mind, one that he hoped would turn things around for him. A wide grin appeared on his face as he placed the beer down in front of her. The girl smiled, thanked him, then took a nice long pull from the bottle.
When she told Tony her story of hitting rock bottom and making the decision to go into recovery, she left certain things vague not out of an unwillingness to explain, but more because her brain just couldn't pull up certain details. Luckily, Tony didn't press her to share more specific details, but at the same time, one had to consider that he was as drunk as a skunk and it probably didn't even think to take the story at anything other than face value. She didn't have that kind of benefit with these other "Avengers," though. They were perfectly sober and able to use their critical thinking skills, much to Carol's dismay.
"Sheffield, call the police." Out of the corner of her eye, Lara could see the man behind the desk next to her punching in numbers on his landline's keypad. She kept her gaze solidly on Dante, though.
"Yeah," Tony assured. "Come on, let's go get something to eat before we all keel over from exhaustion and starvation."
"It could be helpful," Natasha said. "Talking about this with someone who knows what they're talking about." Steve looked unconvinced. "That private talk I was going to have with Stark today was going to be about him possibly seeing a councilor if that helps."
"Oh, I'm beyond cross!" Steam was practically blowing out of his ears. "What the hell was that? Do you even know what you're doing?"
"JARVIS," he said quietly. Not only did he not want to wake Steve, but his throat was so sore that if he spoke above a whisper, it would feel like he swallowed a glassful of razor blades. "Run a facial recognition scan on the surveillance video at the current timestamp."
Tony took a deep breath in and out. There was nothing he could do to fix the situation now. What's done is done. If Steve didn't want to talk to him, it was his own fault. It's not like he had feelings for him. …Alright, he'll admit that the guy is attractive, but still didn't change the fact that…
Seconds after the door locked behind him, another door along the wall that the hospital bed was against opened and someone pushed a metal chair through. The door shut and locked again afterward. Tony took the chair and carried it over to "Steve's" bedside and sat down.
"Uh," Clint said. "An alleyway on 10th Street between a hotel and a Bank of America. I found him eating out of a Lucky's Pizza box, and I was thinking of naming him…"
So, for what felt like the eightieth time that day, Steve got up and started wandering the halls. He had been told that this floor acted as a pseudo-hotel for people connected with S.H.I.E.L.D. and its investigations. Currently, though, he had the entire floor to himself. It would have been nice, but Steve was starting to get a touch of cabin fever. He was desperate to at least
So, to say his feelings were mixed was an understatement. He was having trouble reconciling the two images of a man considered to be dead and buried with the unconscious guy hooked up to machines in the next room. In fact, he still wasn't entirely convinced that S.H.I.E.L.D. wasn't trying to pull a fast one on him, so he tried to keep a close eye on what everyone in the room was doing.
"Yes," he almost cheered. "I have this new formula I've been working on…"
The stream of people zig-zagged around the room. It was almost as if no one knew where they were going or what they were supposed to be doing. As a result, Lara ended up getting pushed closer to the middle of the room, where the Peoples Unity Church had gathered. No matter how much she tried to resist, she ended up getting pushed further and further until she was close enough to catch a glimpse of one of the people sitting in the circle and recognize him. How could she not? She was married to him for three years.
"I don't think so…" He sighed and waved it off. "I'll take it up with the concierge when we check out."
"You too, Betty." He gave her a good-natured pat on the back as he pulled away. The two of them parted soon after, still on good terms. Bruce started heading to his room, feeling much better than he thought he would when he started the day.
"I'm sorry," she said. "But I'm not the one who's about to 'crash hard.'" At those words, Tony felt his stomach roll uncomfortably again. His pained expression didn't escape Romanoff's notice. "Yeah, that's what I thought. Come on, let's get you back to the car."
"Spider DNA," Jessica explained. "Makes me more sensitive… Like Maria's eggnog…" Carol's eyes widened, knowing the exact incident she was talking about and remembering how sick she got.
"I'm sorry," Rhodey said. "I'm still confused as to how anyone would approve of the idea of an
"I have my badge in my room," Clint said. "I can go get it, but without a search warrant I doubt we'll get anywhere." Natasha slid her room key out of her back pocket.
"Alright," Pepper relented, though she still sounded concerned. Despite that, there was nothing she could do other than take his word for it. "I'll see you later, okay?"
he told himself.
"Why were you crying?" Bruce held one hand up placatingly. "I don't mean to pry, but you did say that he didn't outright fire you…"
"Well, in that case…" Stark pushed one of the glasses towards her while picking up the other one and holding it out. "Cheers."
So, this morning, the Avengers would be stuck with Steve's fried eggs again. Certainly, most of them would not mind, but this morning Tony just was not feeling it. Just looking at them frying in the pan made his stomach churn uneasily, so instead, he decided to make what he could out of what he found in the fridge. He ended up with a bowl of yogurt mixed with fresh blueberries. Steve asked him if he were sure that is what he wanted, given that dairy would probably be harder for his stomach to break down than eggs, but Tony assured him that he would be fine. After all, it was
"No," Tony said forcefully, cutting Rhodey off. "No. You're not the one this is happening to, so you can't tell me that the world isn't ending, because it is." Rhodey lowered his head and let out a sigh.
Before Amanda could respond, Hill caught Carol's attention, gesturing for her to follow. Carol couldn't have been more relieved. She hopped down off the bed and stepped past the curtain, leaving Fury to hash things out with the hospital employee.
He leaned back against the headboard and shut his eyes; his only focus was on breathing. He reminded himself that he and Steve were safe and so was everyone else. (Well, with the possible exceptions of Barton and Romanoff.) No invasions were happening, and the world was going to spin on as normal.
"Go where?" Natasha questioned.
"Or just access to those two things." Bruce eyed the letter skeptically before a thought dawned on him. "Why Newark?"
"Not an option," he said. "If you find the truth, tell them the truth. We've come too far in this operation to have it all come unraveled by a wrong lie at the wrong time. Besides, Stark's not an idiot. He's probably already plugged the hole in his defenses by now and any subsequent attempts would be rendered fruitless.
Thank you to mfaerie32 on FFN for the review and the guest on AO3 who left kudos! You're awesome!
"Alright," he said. "Where and when were you looking for footage specifically?"
"My guess," Betty said. "Either something powerful or something with increased virility. Depending on their intent, it makes sense."
"Don't want to go…" was all he gave as a response.
"Believe it," Natasha said. "And as you've said, you've already confessed, so there's no reason for you to keep up the silent treatment."
"We're taking you to the Hay-Adams hotel," Fury explained. "It's where you've been staying with the rest of the Avengers."
"It's a nickname," Bruce explained. "Like how your name is short for Larissa."
"Two days ago," Steve countered. "And not much else since." Tony sighed in defeat.
"What?!" Lara exclaimed. "That's insane!"
After a while, the smoke began to clear, and Clint caught sight of an adult, humanoid figure combing through the wreckage. At first, his heart leaped. He hoped it was Laura, that she and the kids somehow managed to get out safely. He was a little disappointed when the smoke cleared enough to allow him to discern that it wasn't her, but he was still relieved to see a familiar head of curly red hair.
"Clint."
"Sure, it was and sure I did." Tony rolled his eyes. By that point they had made it to the bar and Tony had released his grip on Romanoff's arm. He scrambled over to the counter to regain some sense of balance. Romanoff stepped forward until she was standing toe-to-toe with Tony.
"And if someone 'wanders off'" Lara said, making a point to use air quotes. "Again, standard procedure is to call the police. Hell, in some cases skipping the police and going straight to the FBI would probably be the better decision."
"I am ungrateful to be alive," he sneered. "There is
he thought.
"While we were in D.C.," he explained. "I found him in an alleyway eating out of a Lucky's Pizza box."
"Stark and his assistant knew for sure," Freeman said. "It came out when I told them and the other three Avengers that I called the RCMP."
"What's the brand name on it?" Knežević asked.
Clint didn't give an answer and frankly, Natasha didn't expect one. Over the past few months, she had noticed that Clint had been constantly keeping himself busy, mostly by fixing things around the farm and playing with the kids. She had a feeling this was his way of coping. He needed to keep his mind busy, otherwise, he'd have to think about what Loki did to him. Nat didn't think that this was entirely healthy, but at the same time, she couldn't be one to judge. Her way of coping involved running, kicking, and punching; not exactly healthy either.
"Water under the bridge, so long as she doesn't do it again," Steve's mother assured. "We better get going, though.
"Again?" Clint questioned. "This has happened before?"
"Oh, yeah," Bruce said. "I mean she's French. Sometimes she'll slip up and do or say something wrong because this isn't her culture or language, but she's always apologetic for it. She also takes responsibility for things that aren't her fault…"
"Isn't that pride?" Steve asked.
"I know," Natasha said. "I know that feeling, too. I'm feeling it right now. I want to do something to help
Salinas' house was a lot smaller than Tony expected it to be. From the outside, it looked only to be a one-bedroom ranch; a very nice one-bedroom ranch, but a one-bedroom ranch, nonetheless. Most politicians tended to buy houses that were much more grandiose than that. However, from what Tony could see, what it lacked in size it more than made up for in yard space. He could see the tops of multiple greenhouses in the back yard and the front yard was sectioned off as if it were garden or a field. It looked rather nice, too, even though it was all covered in snow.
"Hi, Betty."
"No, wait!"
"I don't like it," Steve confessed, looking pointedly at Loki.
"Like what?" Tony asked.
"Of course, you wouldn't." Lara didn't do much to keep that comment under her breath, causing Bruce to raise his eyebrows.
"No," Tony said. "But I don't think I'm going to puke right this second, so I'd say that's good." Another wave of nausea would probably grip him in the next fifteen seconds. He was going to enjoy this respite while it lasted.
"Well," he said. "I guess we should start with the countertop but be careful. I don't think it's broken, but I can't be sure. Besides, it's heavy and probably a two-person job. So, how about I take one side…"
"I called twice," he pointed out. "Why didn't you let me know what was going on then?"
She tried to force herself to her feet as fast as possible, but that ended up being a mistake. She was tangled up in the jacket and the only way out was by taking it off. Her hat fell off her head in the process.
"Well, I didn't really think I could do it on my own, and I was able to hold the Other Guy back just enough…" Clint and Natasha turned their attentions on Bruce, who shrugged a little uncomfortably. "You guys weren't exactly discrete about the fact that you were fighting, and I didn't want… You know…"
"Of the people in this room," he said. "Which one is A, wearing a spangly outfit, and B, not of use?" Alright, now Steve could feel his blood boil. If Bruce didn't speak up right at that second, he probably would have said something to Tony that he would have regretted.
"You okay?" Steve asked.
"Stark," she said. "I'm ordering you to stand down."
"I don't know," Steve said. "For me it feels like it's been longer than that."
"Then do that, Miss Conroy," Hill said.
"So," Salinas said. "Would you mind telling me why you were walking around my neighborhood drunk at this early hour without any shoes?"
global catastrophe and I ended up dialing you by mistake. I do not see what the big deal is, though. You obviously didn't have to travel far."
Sometime later, Loki awoke again. Everything ached, and he was taking that as a good sign. After all, if he could feel pain in all his limbs, then he wasn't paralyzed. Slowly peeling open his eyes, he saw nothing above him other than the white stucco of the ceiling. He tried to turn over but found it difficult as he was seemingly embedded into the ground. Seeing no other way to get out, Loki slowly and painfully hoisted himself up out of the hole. When he finally did, his body almost gave out on him again. However, he fought to stay conscious and came out of that battle victorious. After a few minutes rest Loki started pulling himself forwards, up the small staircase that lay just a few feet from him. That's when he finally took notice of their presence.
Natasha and Clint gave quick assurances of agreement, with Natasha adding, "whatever you need, we'll help you." Tony blinked, not believing what he was hearing.
"An insurance policy?" Adoniram questioned.
"No, you don't."
"Under the Supreme Court decision of
"Um…"
"Let's hope you're right," Steve said.
"And they can wait," Pepper said. "We don't know what's going on right now and even if we do, we're under strict instructions not to say anything. So, just tell the media that we can't comment on the situation right now.
Tony hoped to dear God no one had been hurt yet. Just the thought that he might be too late…
"Last night, you asked me if I was afraid," he said. "Well, I am afraid. I'm afraid for you, I'm afraid for me, I'm afraid for our relationship…"
"I'm not getting away with this, am I?" Tony asked.
"Why? So, you can kill me?" she questioned. "Fat chance."
"Ma'am," the agent said. "Would you please step aside?"
"You're tip-toeing, big man," Tony remarked. "You need to strut."
"Both the left and right-hand repulsors have failed," JARVIS informed.
Thursday, August 12th, 2010
"A lot of things pushed me over the edge," Tony said. "It was a multi-tiered cliff. Every time something happened, I'd fall to the next level of the abyss. That was just the event that started it. After that happened, I had some of the free mimosas the bar was handing out…"
"I can live with that," Clint said. Lara let out a squeak that shouldn't have been possible coming from a human's voice. She tossed the dog in the air, catching him before he hit the ground.
Tony just watched Clint as he left, an eyebrow raised.
"Fank you, Daddy." He hummed, then leaning in to whisper. "Maybe later jus' in case den, kay?"
"A human, Steve? You went and rescued a HUMAN?!"
He wriggled back out to sit between his dads. "Man, Howard sounded like a real jerk, grandpa or not.".
Steve thought for a moment as those words clicked in his mind. A soft smile came onto his lips and he ducked his head under the blankets as well to meet Tony's face.
Tony returned to his spot behind Steve, slicking up his fingers quickly and sliding one into Steve's entrance, massaging his hip with his other hand.
He ducked his head chuckling.
The genius tilted his head back as Steve thrusted into him, wrapping his arms around the blond's neck.
"If you behave today, then you'll get rewarded. Like good boys do.”
“Yeah baby, we'll go see the house," Tony murmured, grabbing Steve's pajamas and helping him into them. He led Steve back to the bed, climbing in behind him. "Sleep, sweetheart," Tony mumbled, stroking Steve's hair, "You were so good today. Thank you."
of energy.”
"Mmm, we can have sex in other rooms. Like the art room. Lock the door," he purred.
"Deal." Tony mimicked warmly, standing up on his feet. "I'll meet you here, say, tomorrow afternoon? When the sun is out and warm and I won't catch cold or worse?"
"I can only hope," he whispered, nuzzling into Steve's hand, "I just-- I don't know what I'd do with myself if I--"
you, I's a big boy," Peter replied proudly, kicking his feet against the chair, "I can ea' jus' lihe you, Papa!"
"What're my fellas up to over here?" Steve said with a smile, Peter on his hip.
"Do you wanna go see if they'll let us watch a little while, then?" He suggested. "It could be sort of like when you were a kid?"
"Yeah..." He said softly. "But I can kiss ya just because I want to kiss ya, can't I?" Steve asked with a soft smile, giving Tony an eskimo kiss.
Steve shivered with want as he watched Tony's movements, each one of them completely sensual and perfect. Absolutely perfect. It was almost like a dance, really. Always was.
He smiled fondly, petting Peter's hair.
go against our rules."
Pete just shrugged innocently, spooning spaghetti into his mouth.
"G'morning, lover," He mumbled, squinting in the sunlight.
Steve took it all in, all that he could, pulling back slowly with a wet pop. He looked back at Tony as he caught his breath, wiping a bit of saliva from his lips. He smirked seeing the pleased look on the man's face.
This chapter is Tony's parallel to the previous chapter. Hence why it is so short. It is to simply lead into the event that I plan to happen in the next chapter.
"I know, I'll play with you in a minute," Tony laughed, going to find a place in the shade to set up.
'How did you do this?' Steve asked bewildered. 'And how does it sound almost like me?'
"Food?" He asked hopefully.
"Peter, Petey, hey. Munchkin, don't cry. It’s okay. You aren't in trouble, I promise." Steve soothed quietly, kissing his face gently and wiping the boy's tears as they headed out.
"What? What did I miss?" He asked.
He nuzzled at Steve's neck, kissing his collarbones.
“I love it. It's....nice, to let go for once. Rather than be in control."
"Peter," Tony replied warningly.
"The penguins are always fun, especially the baby ones," Tony hummed, reaching up to pet Peter's hair with his other hand, "They're so cute."
"Yeah! M'not tired, not one bit," Peter giggled, smooching Steve's cheek.
"It really doesn't look bad. A little shaky in some spots, but that gives it some character." He hummed. "We have to wait for it to dry before putting on the lettering, though."
"It is a natural reaction, doctor or no." He coughed from the smoke, waving it away with his hand. "It may simply be because it’s you, but lord knows why it would gauge such reaction. Now then. Nine letter word for the study of star signs?"
Peter sighed dramatically, dragging his stepstool over to the sink to wash his hands again. He dried them off and stepped down, hopping over to the couch to grab his discarded penguin and curl up into the cushions.
Steve nodded with a hum. "We'll have time. We can look up names and meanings and everything soon. And then we'll get to work on the nursery when we have a surrogate picked and--"
"Otay, I can do dat. I'll teach 'em letters an' numbahs," he rattled off, an excited glint in his eye.
He poked his head in his shared bathroom with Steve, the blond brushing his teeth to finish getting ready for bed.
"The bandaids is for your booboos." Peter explained softly. "I got Transformers cuz you like wobots 'n princesses cuz I thought it'd be funny." He said with a little giggle.
"I'll call Mama after breakfast. She might bring Howard, but hopefully not. She's been trying to get us to tolerate each other," Tony sighed between mouthfuls.
"Tell them they'll get spanked by
He nodded, taking a breath and gulping down his grief.
“No... I could’ve sworn U had followed me outta there, though!” Tony answered getting antsy again, “We should probably go and check— oh man, she’s gonna be so mad if I let her in there by herself!”
He changed into his warmest sweats and a sweater, standing awkwardly in the middle of the room. Steve sat at the end of the bed after he slipped his sweats on, patting beside him for Tony to join him.
"Yes," Tony laughed, squeezing his hand, "Yes we are." Babs clapped her hands, grinning as she led them back to the kitchen to start the long process of signing papers.
"Didn't mean to startle you awake. Tried being gentle." Steve murmured, looking up at his husband happily, "You were resting so well, didn't want to wake you. But we are on a bit of a time crunch..." The blond said bashfully.
"Clint's right, Bucky," Natasha hummed, "It was a
"Of course." The man hummed, toying lightly at the underwear as he leaned up a bit. "Hell, I'll wear the whipped cream myself. Let you satisfy your sweet tooth a little bit."
"Uh--Yeah! Yeah, it's, uh, it's my bot." Tony stuttered, and since when did he stutter? Probably when he is met with intimidatingly hot guys.
"Why? What happened today".
Steve gave him a serious look, pointing in the direction of the corner.  "Go sit. Now. I am sending evidence of this to your father then I am going to start trying to clean. You are to stay there until I say otherwise."
He sped off towards the art building, easily parallel parking in front of the looming doors. They got out quickly, Steve trying not to just run inside of the building as they entered.
"Alright?" Steve reiterated, kissing Tony's forehead softly. "You'll be great. You
Tony could only agree in soft noises, hands clutching at the sheets as he bucked into Steve's hand, starting to pant harshly; He whined like the needy person he was.
"Hey Dad, who's with you in this picture? Kind of looks like you." A twelve-year-old Peter asks as he holds up a photo found in one of his father's old text books, kicking his feet gently as he lay on the couch in his father's lab.
Tony paused for a second, feeling Steve freeze up.
She nodded and let them in completely, pointing out his huddled figure in the corner of the living room. "James is in there watching him," She replied quietly, "He's the only one who got him to stop crying."
TW: implications toward previous self-harm
"You gots money?" Pete asked, going on his tiptoes while Steve paid, "Cause we need somes for the store."
"I'll find a way to bring it back, I promise you," He whispered, flicking his eyes between Steve's clear ones, "I'm going to make sure you and I are back on our regular schedule, because you deserve every last good thing in this world that makes you happy."
"Hey! Wait up!" Tony called, managing to climb over the fence. He chased after the guy, following him up to this hide out, it felt like. Weird place for one, but hey, who was he to judge other people's preferences.
"Captain Rogers."
He eyed Tony as the brunet worked himself open. "God, you are always so beautiful." He hummed lovingly, stroking Tony's cheek.
"But they are real. They're my scales. My fins. My...me." He explained, leaving Tony to chuckle.
It was tasty and warm-- Well, hot at first since it originally burned his mouth trying to eat it, but once it cooled a bit it was wonderful. Tony also showed him how to actually drink something, which started with water then sips of juices and a drink called soda. Then Tony had explained how to use the bathroom, since it apparently was something that had to be done fairly often as a human. Especially after eating.
"Pete?" Tony tried to bite back a laugh.
"Y'get some sleep too, you. You need it." He murmured before starting to drift.
He easily took Steve into his mouth, humming as the blond's cock nudged the back of his throat.
He tugged Steve to his chest, hands back in his hair. Steve kissed at the center of Tony's chest sweetly, tracing small shapes along his stomach with his fingers.
"Hiding behind the recliner," Tony grinned, "He wants me to squish you first, though. He thinks I can hold you down-- well, I can, we've proved that
"I honestly don't know. I never looked into soul bonds that much," Tony muttered, shivering slightly, "I'll make a few calls after our trip, try to get some insight. I know a guy that's a resident expert on these things, he'd have an answer."
," Steve mewled back. "Peter is wanting breakfast first and he's-- heading around the corner." He squeaked, face growing red.
"Love you too, snookums," Tony grinned.
"As long as we're careful being in the water and doing that." He hummed. "I heard on the news that there was a couple having sex on the beach in Italy, and suction occurred and they got stuck. They had to ask a stranger for help."
"Mmm, love you. We needed that." Steve admitted with a soft grin.
"Yea, Daddy said I tan tall you Mommy an'--" He looked around like he might get in trouble, before leaning up to Steve.
"I think so. Have us a lazy Sunday." The blond hummed, playing with the baby's hands. "Figured we'd let you recuperate from last night." He smirked playfully, kissing his husband's cheek.
He kissed Tony’s temple softly, hugging him close to him. "You don't have to do that anymore though, okay? Never ever. You can talk to me, I'll help you. You don't have to hurt anymore, love."
Tony pulled his hands away, shifting so their contact was cut off. He gave Steve a concerned look, putting his hands under the pillow.
He squeezed Steve's knee, turning off the main highway.
Tony smiled back, patting Steve's shoulder before letting go.
Steve began the swats shortly after, not too much to hurt, but enough to sting.
Tony hummed softly as he put on the warm sweater, nearly buried in the much-too-large clothing.
Peter's a brat sometimes, bullying, and Tony struggles with discipline.
"We know, bud." Steve hummed. "You're our sweet boy. Always will be our sweet boy."
"So I can go check?" Tony smirked, side-stepping the boy before striding off for the boy's room.
"You're so loose, Stevie, you really must be fucking around with this boyfriend," Tony hummed, knowing he himself was completely hard by now, "How's he gonna feel about having someone else's cock in your ass?"
"Baby bear? You up?"
The boy then looked at Steve, wanting let down to crawl into his bed. "We gonna reads 'fore going to sweep?" He asked, burying himself under the blankets and cuddling Wade the penguin.
"I was hopin' you'd f'get about that," he muttered.
Steve sent a smile Tony's way in reply, reaching to stroke the man's cheek gently.
Tony grinned, feeling tears bud up in his eyes, despite himself.
"Hey, Sleeping Beauty." Steve grinned happily seeing his boys show up.
Steve turned to see another person setting up the gaming systems in the corner. He stood and walked his way over to Steve, his hand extended for a handshake. The guy looked to be around Steve's age. He had dark brunette hair that laid in a mess of curls on his head and had glasses pushed up his nose. He was slightly stocky and had a nervous look about him, but he had quite a firm handshake.
Tony scoffed and spoke with a sarcastic tone.
"Unless you intend to call me that for the next half hour..." Tony warned, pulling Steve into their room.
"So good for me, Stevie," he whispered, carding his fingers through the blond's hair.
"Y'feel so good, baby. Nice and tight--" he purred happily.
Tony rolled his eyes, but agreed.
"What do you mean you wouldn't be a good father?" Bucky spoke up, nearly glaring at Tony. "You've
Bucky looked over to Tony at the mention, raising a brow slightly in curiosity. "Vacation, hm?"
"I'd hope not." Steve answered back softly, hugging Tony close and kissing his face. "But I didn't mean just that way. I meant with how we act with each other, too. I don't want us divided like that, either."
"I wanna know, baby." Steve answered, nuzzling skin lovingly. "I'd love to know how I make you feel. I'll tell you if you tell me?"
"God, he is so cute," Tony murmured, "Steve, my heart is dying from how cute this child is." He clutched at his heart dramatically, falling back on the bed.
"Hey, don't sell yourself short, big guy. I might be able to square root 200-digit numbers, but I can barely draw stick figures," Tony laughed, flushing at the kisses, "I'm a mechanic, that's all. A grease monkey."
"Scared? What is it you're scared of?" Steve asked softly with concern in his voice. "What are you afraid of that's giving you nightmares like that?"
"We gotta shower," He muttered, "And get Pete up from his nap. And do a zillion other things."
"Sorry! Let me start over. Y'see, I'm an art major here on the campus and I was looking for a subject for my final project coming up. Then I saw you sitting here and- sorry if this sounds weird- you have a great facial structure for drawing. So, I was wondering if you could be my subject matter...". Steve began to trail off near the end out of slight embarrassment.
Tony chuckled softly, despite himself, standing up to give them both a forehead smooch.
"Amazing." Tony grinned, a smirk filling his lips.
times worse--"
"Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night." Steve finished at a whisper, softly shutting the book and kissing Peter's forehead before he left the room for the boy to sleep.
"With Tony's track record, I'll see y'all at the wedding," Clint snorted, effectively dodging Natasha's smack. He turned to grin, smile fading at the look on her face. "Yep, yes ma’am, we're going, bye, Steve--"
like their parents, so don't you fucking bring Steve into this fucking mess, because you and I both know it's my own goddamned fucking
"Well we've had a pretty great ride so far." He said softly, lifting Tony's face back up to meet his. "I have faith in us. In you. We can get through this all together. If we plan to get married, that's how it will be anyway. So we best get started." He said, giving Tony a small smile before kissing his lips.
"Ready?"
"Well, I don't know what all you do." Steve said with a shrug. "I just know it’s all the things that I don't know or understand how to do. I'm just the one to do the heavy lifting."
"Is it bad that we barter and stuff for when we want to have sex? Like-- I dunno, it feels weird to me."
He reached down to line Steve up, sighing in pleasure when he slipped in.
"Such a naughty boy, aren't you?" Tony cooed, "Getting aroused from a punishment?" He shook his head, gently running his fingers over Steve's cock through his panties. "All the better to give you a spanking, then." Tony held back a grin as he started the swats up again, switching back to his hand rather than the paddle.
"Mmm, maybe you're right. But you have your ways too." He hummed back playfully.
Peter wormed back into Steve's chest, looking up at his Papa.
in like, what, three weeks?"
"Trust me, I would not rip your dick off. But I would be very upset with you for a while. Took me forever to save up for that." He said softly, kissing at where he had smacked.
"Oh, I don't even wanna think about that, either." Steve groaned, leaning back in bed. "And he was hiding in the back yard the whole time. Made us nervous wrecks. These boys'll be the end of me."
He gave Steve another kiss before going back to his desk, attacking his mountain of papers again.
"I'm sorry. I never wanted to do something that would make you want to. I'm sorry, sweetheart." He said, voice cracking slightly and hand reaching to take Tony's that held the blade.
of vigorous sex. We might try some stuff over there, I got a few things hidden away we haven't tried yet."
"We'll stay in the guesthouse," Natasha decided, grabbing her boys, "C'mon, you two. Let them have their peace."
"I know, I'm sorry Mr. Schmidt. I had a late start this morning. I tried to get here as fast as I could, though." Steve explained truthfully.
“Shhh, I know baby," Tony murmured, rubbing his back, "Do you wanna talk now? Or do you wanna try and go back to sleep and talk tomorrow? I can turn the heat up--"
"Thank God." Steve panted out, shiver running down his spine at the absence behind him. His arms were shaky, adjusting himself a bit in order to keep himself held up.
"Ew!" Peter shrieked, "Sam
"Mmm. Y'welcome," Tony laughed breathily.
Steve shook his head softly. "No, no. This is to benefit
"Ah! Ooo, right there. Right
"Okay," Tony murmured, returning the kiss.
"Shoosh," Natasha quipped after smacking Clint again, "Eat quietly." She sighed and gave Steve an apologetic smile.
Peter scrunched up his face a little when Tony poked his nose, making him look cuter.
"Love you too, Munchkin. You're such a good boy." He hummed fondly with a smile. "Wanna help me make some PB&Js?".
Tony happily took the baby back and made noises at Sammy, grinning when he babbled the same noises at him.
He hugged Tony close, nuzzling the top of his head softly. "So this sounds like one of those supernatural scary movies, with like ghosts and stuff? I like those best when it comes to horror. Not big on slasher films."
He smooched Peter's forehead, tucking him back in.
Tony exited the car, sighing happily up at his dream house, sidling up to Steve and squeezing his hand. Steve squeezed Tony's hand back as they walked up to meet with Babs. He greeted her with a firm handshake and a warm smile, keeping things friendly and professional.
Steve was a bit nervous out of sight from Tony with this stranger, but if Tony trusted him then he couldn't be too bad,right? Although Raavi was a bit eccentric and seemed a bit much at times, he was nice and respectful as he helped Steve change into the different outfits.
"Ratatouille?" Peter interrupted, mouth full of food.
"Shhshh, no sweetie. You don't have to feel that way. I'm sorry." Steve whispered, peppering Tony's face gently with kisses. "It’s okay, love. It’s okay."
"Steve," he whispered, voice cracking slightly, "Steve, you can't-- you can't
--" he whispered breathlessly, thrusting down onto Tony as he moved.
Steve huffed softly, close up his blankets and curling into them again. "You have a point. Don't like it though..." He hummed, at least inching as close as he could to Tony in the bed.
"So I gotta ask; Why fish? Wouldn't this be like... cannibalism for you?" the brunet asked in general curiosity.
"So needy, hm? You want me to fuck you, but you want it all to last." The man hummed sweetly. "How do you propose we sort that out?"
Tony whined, edgy that he couldn't turn and kiss Steve.
Tony nodded, ruffling Peter's hair. "Yeah, he was pretty awful. But he made it easier for me to stay with Pops." He explained softly.
"Well, I think you do wonderfully. You've done great with Peter." Steve pointed out, gently rocking them together.
belong to? You couldn't have been
He grinned, sucking down the dregs off his coffee.
"Shh, baby. Relax. Let me help ya, okay?" Steve hushed softly and took Tony in deeper, working him slowly and running his tongue over the underside.
"Peter, whadda you say?" Tony asked.
"He just really likes your beard, Tony. He might just tell you're you by that." Steve chuckle softly as he made the plates.
Tony managed to bite his lip in time to keep his sobs in, clinging to Steve's shirt; A few tears leaked out of his eyes.
"Don't worry my dear, Rogers and I have merely come to take a look at your latest... company, shall I say," Tony chuckled, grabbing gloves before handing a pair off to Steve, "I've been presented with another case."
The semester was about 2 days away from its end. Tony hadn't spoken with Steve since the ordeal with his father. Hell, he barely even spoke with Bruce if it didn't have to do with help on some work. Being basically banished from school by your father because of rumors that you were in love with a guy doesn't really put a person in a great mood. Then he basically blew up at Steve about it, trying to break it off knowing he wouldn't get to see him again after the semester. That doesn't make it any better.
"Right, don't talk about that," Tony mumbled, gasping as Steve eased himself in.
He reached down to gently run his hand over the front of Steve's trousers, fondling him through the material. Steve's face started to redden, staring at Tony in surprise.
"Guess I'll share the title with Peter, huh?" Steve said with a quick huff of a chuckle.
was a bulls-eye! C'mon!" Clint complained.
"No, hush," Tony shushed him, turning back to Bucky, "If you need something, ask Pep. She's got the contact info for the guys out west that have the splitting device."
“I have no problem with it if Steve’s fine with company,” Bruce answered with a nod, assuring the brunet “You can stay as long as you’d like, Bucky.”
"First night in our house. Not in an apartment. We don't have to go back and forth between each other's apartment all the time, and we can just... Be.".
"Holy shit, Steve, holy shit," Tony whispered, "I--I mean, Sir--" He whimpered, stepping out of his jeans and tossing his own shirt aside before going down on his knees, staring open-mouthed at Steve.
"It was going really well too," Tony interjected, not looking much better than Peter, "But
He grinned, unclipping his garters from his stockings. The blond grunted as Tony rocked back on his lap, the friction getting a little too much for how little they were doing at the moment.
"You're older than me, so you'll always be the old man," Tony pointed out, grinning, "One day, instead of getting each other flowers, I'll have to get you hemorrhoid cream."
, Steve. Fuck."
Steve looked to him carefully, forcing the pink to stay off of his cheeks. "Again? When was there a first time?"
Steve and Tony's alone time end, and they go to get Peter. He's had a rough day,
"I love you."
"Hmm, I'll have to make sure you get more used to compliments, then." Steve responded with a smile, grip careful around Tony's cock as he began to slowly pump the other in his hand. "Because you treat me so well that compliments just want to leave my mouth all the time."
"I'm gonna go get the squirt a chew toy, anything you want while I'm out?" He asked.
"How do you want it, baby?" Tony purred, running his thumbs over Steve's hipbones.
Tony gave Peter his plate, rolling his eyes fondly while the boy scarfed down his food.
Steve smiled proudly at the boy, smooching on his cheeks. "When'd you get to talking so big? You spend too much time with Dad." He joked.
Tony dressed, grabbed his keys and followed behind Steve. "If he does, all the better for you take a job as my PA," He pointed out, "In fact, I'll go with you. Scare your boss man shitless."
"There you go, Petey, all moved in," Tony breathed, putting his hands on his hips as he surveyed the room, "Real easy, huh?"
and--"
"My bedroom is just the next door over, if you need anything. If I am not there, then I am in the workshop most likely." The man explained. "JARVIS can always help you too, if need help, okay? Sleep tight, Aqua Man~" He teased before heading out of the room.
"Lil brotha!!!" Peter cheered happily, grabbing Tony's hand and trying to drag him toward the garage.
"Both you are so much alike. Ya both gotta hurt yourselves acting silly." Steve shook his head fondly, kissing both o their heads. "I'll go take care of Sammy real fast. Give him his teether and a change, okay?"
".... I don't feel good," he mumbled weakly.
I tease you, and we both know that you know how pregnancy works," Tony continued, slightly irritated, "There was no reason to throw a tantrum, Peter."
"Thank you, Peter," he said hoarsely.
going through fucking withdrawal and--fuck it, I wouldn't be surprised if you gave me the ring back."
"All right, all right." He grumbled with a small smile. "How're you feeling? How're... How're the bruises...?"
"S'dirty," Peter replied, making a face, "Wash y'face, Daddy."
"Not sure how I smell good, but thank you." He chuckled softly.
"I just can't help it, Sir." Steve replied, blush growing brighter. "I'm just a glutton for your punishment, I suppose.”
He sighed and took a sip of his coffee, relishing in the taste.
"I'm not sure what all else there is. So we'll try different things and see what happens from there, I guess." He hummed.
the apartment?"
Tony frowned and put his hands on his hips.
"I'll get you a glass of juice to help pick you up, okay?" He said with a small smile, heading to the fridge.
Peter looked up at Steve, a slight confusion to his face. "...'tay?".
Peter snuggled against Steve's chest, sniffling as they went downstairs. He waved at Tony sleepily, gently taking the crackers Steve offered him.
Clint extended a hand to Tony, which he hesitantly accepted for a hand shake.
"I usually hear Papa da mosts. That's why I know he weally loves Daddy." Peter hummed, nibbling his crust.
"The first step of a giant leap." Steve said wistfully, looking to the blonde thankfully.
Peter grinned bashfully, flicking water at Steve.
at a crop and little sweet nothings make me--"
"You won't." Steve said certainly "You wouldn't. I know you wouldn't. You care about Peter far too much to do such a thing to him. And I know you definitely wouldn't to the new baby when it’s older."
"Hey, take it easy. Slow." Tony soothed, helping the man sit up on the sand. "Now, what the hell happened to you? You have legs and you're a lot smaller since I saw you last. Been dieting? Because I think you went too far." He joked, trying to ease his tension a bit.
!" Tony exclaimed, crocodile tears brimming in the corners of his eyes, "
"Yes, yes, very smooth, mister touchy," Tony grinned, "If this is the response I get, I'm definitely shaving more often." He preened under Steve's touch, sighing happily.
"Yeah, we did. We needed one from today." He explained with a stretch. "All nice and refreshed now though, munchkin."
"I'm going to guess you have one, as well?" He asked anxiously, offering up a small smile.
Steve sighed softly, a content noise leaving his lips at the kiss. He moved to start slicking up his fingers, trailing them down Tony's lower back before slipping them in. Tony took a sharp breath, forcing himself to relax; He sunk down onto Steve's fingers, mewling quietly against Steve's neck. He shivered, trying not to buck up at the pressure.
"And we love you too, Daddy. Very, very, very, very much." Peter said, cuddling against him sweetly.
Steve looked confused.
"Yeah, you three made a nice pile in my guest house, if I remember correctly," Tony drawled, "Only Buck was the limping one, right Bucky?"
"You get an easy question, a small article goes first." He replied, undoing his tie and tossing it aside, then proceeding to undo the first three buttons of his shirt. A small bit of lace and powder blue material slightly peeked over the buttons.
"I know baby, I know," Tony soothed, leaning down to kiss his tailbone.
"What's the matter, munchkin? Ya full?" Steve asked as they headed in the kitchen. "Wanna save the rest?"
Steve saw Peter leave with a sigh, looking to Sammy.
"Now that's not true, and everyone make mistakes, lil 'un," Tony murmured, letting Steve take Sammy so he could rock Peter, "Everything's okay."
Peter sniffled pitifully at that, looking at Tony with tired eyes.
Steve sighed, leaning back in his chair and pulling over the newspaper and a pen to begin their ritual. Tony says he thinks better while doing the crossword.
Once he heard Steve go up the steps, Peter grabbed his paint kit out from under his bed, quietly sneaking down to the living room to paint a masterpiece: on the wall. And white couch. And rug.
parents."
He happily gave Steve a second kiss, leaning down to give Sammy a kiss on his chubby cheek.
He shouted as he came, coating the top of the desk in thick, white stripes. Steve groaned as he felt Tony come, clenching around him as he rode out Tony's orgasm. Didn't take much longer before he came as well, choking out a moan as he did and resting his head along Tony's spine. Tony laid there and panted for a good minute, feeling well and truly fucked.
"Aren't most kids handfuls as teens?" Steve chuckled softly, petting at Tony's hair. "We can handle it, though. You have an iron will." He joked softly.
Steve's face tinged slightly pink at that, Natasha snickering next to him and Bucky looking highly unamused.
"Don't worry, I think they're gross sometimes, too." He grinned hearing the boy giggle.
"Yeah, uh huh, what
"Did, ah, do you have a soulmate tattoo?" he asked, "If that's not too personal, or anything--"
failing us. Never, ever,
He grinned and dashed into the house to do a quick perimeter sweep, waggling his fingers at Bucky as he looked around, sighing in relief.
"Mr. Stark, Mr. Rogers, a pleasure to see you," Babs said with a grin, leading them in, "Mr. Stark, as you are quite familiar with the house, feel free to tour Mr. Rogers. I'll be in the kitchen if you have questions."
"Okay?" Steve grinned softly, chest fluttering a bit with hope. "Does that mean you would be okay with a new baby in the house?"
Steve hummed softly into the kiss, loving the idea.
"Will do." Steve hummed back, heading towards the kitchen to use the phone, giddily calling up the others.
"I know he is. I'll take great care of him, I swear. I won't let anyone hurt him again without a fight." He assured with a curt nod, watching Tony walk up with the redhead.
The brunet started to settle again, wrapping his arm around the back of the couch and around Steve's slender shoulders as they sat and watched the film a bit more in companionable silence. After a bit, Tony heard a low, curious voice perk up from beside him.
-- take it slow, baby. Don't wanna hurt ya. Know it’s been a while."
"I'm not gonna make a long, mushy speech or some shit. I'd faint of embarrassment halfway through," he snorted, fiddling with the tiny lock on the box, "So, ah, in all classic honesty, I love you. Like, love-love you. More than soulmates, if that's possible. And taking Queen Beyoncé’s advice, I'd like to put a ring on it, if that's okay."
"Not entirely." Steve said as he sat down next to Peter.
"Of course, Stark..." Steve sighed, heading down the stairs as he mumbled under his breath. "Because apparently I'm the door man and it’s completely good form to answer the door in pajamas..."
Tony chuckled and swept off to the living room, grabbing a bowl of cheerios on the way.
“I’m sure there is probably some information out there on werewolves that will actually be helpful.” Natasha suggested with a thoughtful hum “Just have to try and sort the fact from fiction while we gather information.”
"What a gentleman." Steve teased, entering their flat with a hum and going to hang up their coats. "I suppose you'll tell me what you know as we finish our puzzle?"
need to go to the hospital," he said weakly, blacking out.
"See? Not bad," he tried.
He grinned, taking Steve's hand as he started walking again. Steve respected Tony's wishes, giving Tony's hand a squeeze as they continued walking. They made it to a small park, walking down the path as Steve heard someone playing music. A mandolin, of all things. As the music was starting to be heard better, he got an idea.
"So..." Tony tried again, feeling his gut roll at the positively animalistic look in Steve's eyes.
"Hey, hey." Steve scolded gently "We get why you did it Peter, but you still need some sort of punishment for it. So for today and tonight, no TV unless it is what Daddy and I happen to watch."
"--That's mostly clothes and books, nothing big. I got him pencils with his name on it--"
"Don't worry baby, you won't get woken up. Papa and I arranged the nursery so you won't hear much," Tony explained, shifting the two children in his lap, "Unless you want to get up to help feed and change him, but you'll have to take a nap the next day."
"D'pends. He looks loud, an' if he wakes me up, we's not gonna have a good time," Peter replied matter-of-factly, nodding.
room in the guest house,
"You don't take kindly with many people, and I always see you charming the women." Steve pointed out, gently pressing his lips against Tony's with a hum of want. "So I assumed. Assumed you'd never even give a man that time of day."
"Oh baby, don't be sorry, it happens to everyone," Tony soothed, rubbing Peter's back, "In fact, when your Papa and I first got married, I was sick
He looked at Peter, then glanced back up to Steve, a smirk slowly stretching over his lips.
"Mmm, maybe, I was kidding," Tony shrugged, "But if you wanna, we can." He put his hand on the back of his neck, glancing at the floor.
"Y'told me you wasn' gon give me 'way but then y'only happy when y'talk about a baby!" Peter wailed, huge tears rolling down his cheeks, "It's not
Tony sighed and snuggled up to Steve as close as he could get, burying his face in Steve's side.
"Hobblin' a little, but not really sore." He explained, picking up Tony's pillow. "And you are an adorable sleeper. I have the sketch to prove it."
“Don't lemme sleep too long," Tony murmured, easily falling asleep in Steve's warm embrace.
"Yeah, yeah, no need to look at me like that, pipsqueak," Tony rolled his eyes fondly, settling back in the hammock so Peter could curl up on his chest, "Any other demands, Bossman? Or you just want story time?"
"He has to learn..." He repeated. "He'll be upset for now, but he'll be over it soon enough."
Sputtering Tony pales, holds up a hand in rebuttal and then throws it down.
“Rhodey’s alive,” Bruce interjects, recognising all of that bad blood he’d missed out on, “Thor too. Rocket, he’s a racoon, we’re in Wakanda right now… There are so many dead Tony.”
“It’s fine, I can handle it.” Harley sounds so confident, even with his slightly cracking voice.
“I protect the sanctum and now apparently aid Tony Stark.” Tony’s expression prompts him to continue, “Strange tasked me with monitoring you when you got back to Earth and to help you any way I can.”
Sat on the table, he braces himself for a few moments. He lounges back, like Jeff Goldblum in Jurassic Park, gritting his teeth until the heat finally subsides. Closing his eyes, he tries to visualise jet boots on his feet, hell he’d pat himself on the back for getting a shoe of some sort.
“Guardian, there is a problem.”
Briefly his mind wanders to Natasha, and he flickers his eyes to the panel with her little blinking light. She’d reluctantly agreed to pick up a phone from the airport on her way to Budapest, so he could keep an eye on her and she could call in if she was in trouble. What he hadn’t told her was that he’s also monitoring every camera feed he can get access to, running her, Barton and various other people through facial recognition just in case. Tony frowns. He feels like constantly counting his ducks before one of them gets blown to pieces. He shivers, the phantom feel of ash on his skin. Her light flashes on the screen, and he takes some comfort in that.
The original Iron Man suit saved his life, but he’s grown it into so much more. Out of respect for the capabilities he has, he dedicates his life to being Iron Man. To building a better world without a power-crazy controlling force behind every decision. Screw the board meetings. Fuck the hypocrisy. Or so Tony likes to believe.
The world around him is dark, there's pressure on his ears and building on his chest. Gasping, he rips his eyes open. He goes to talk and instead inhales water. He’s panicking now. The fear is blinding; his hands flailing around him, body twisting and turning wildly, caged like an animal, fighting the water. Yes. Water. Tony Stark is drowning.
The look of horror and confusion when she starts to disappear.
He opens it, and Rhodey is sitting, looking worn out and old, staring at the screen.
That voice. He wheezes again, inhaling another bout of liquid. Shaking his head, he tries to fight it, to find out which way is up, and get his aching limbs to cooperate with what little he has left. He wants to follow the sound but becomes disorientated once more.
Today he closes his eyes and prays that he can figure this out.
He had an effect on Rocket that he didn’t expect.
“And IF Mr Hotshot over there can get past you, he has my explicit permission to view any files he so wishes, with your parental discretion Ghost.”
“But then I couldn’t do that to my favourite, could I Dummy?”
“Thor and Rocket left yesterday, and the people here have more to worry about than the white people who brought the universe to fight on their doorstep. I need time, and I need to find Clint.”
“Guardian, the facial recognition has got a hit.”
Truly, he must be the most pathetic being in the universe.
’s varying degrees of horrified expressions.
Tony winces at the tone. Is he really that pathetic? Can his own machine see all the flaws in his brain that render him unable to fully relive that experience again?
Harley shrugs him off, trudging on ahead.
The gears inside his brain were already turning, the time stone had to be the key. Thanos must be able to be summoned or tracked. An energy signature had to be left behind. Something. He just had to find it.
“Steve, it’s,” he clears his throat, clicking his fingers together, “Good to see you.”
He also needs to deal with Friday. She is inferior to Jarvis – he may well just be bitter that he had become attached to Jarvis. He shouldn’t be able to build a bad AI, but he did. Friday wasn’t as quick, as friendly. She’s self-learning, in the same way that Jarvis was, but she lacks the warmth and personality Jarvis had. Damnit, he doesn’t want to start crying again. He wants his friends back. That’s too much to ask, he knows, most people leave him through a fault all his own. A flaw in his code that can’t be rewritten.
“Dummy, grab me a scalpel,” He jumps to his feet, suddenly invigorated, “G, can you limit the processors to just the muscles and nerves in my feet?”
, that’s a lot of billions without counting the rest of the universe. The shower clicks off. Tony fumbles for a towel – finding Dummy holding one for him just inches away – and sidesteps the mirror this time.
“Ghost,” He says, forcing himself out of that infinite nothing. Nothing seems particularly off, but he knows how vivid his imagination can be. The lack of a dream is more disconcerting than a nightmare. He considers what the cause could be… “There was something in my coffee wasn’t there.”
“Give it time, G.” Tony ducks under some fallen banners that the demonstrators had hung all over the place.
Nebula takes off again while he directs her to a location that he’s never revealed to anyone. His own personal cave; a getaway; a sanctuary. His panic room.
This, Tony thinks, is about to be a new low point in his life.
Tony leans back in the wheelie chair, hand scraping through his hair and taking a deep breath. He can feel the neurons in his brain firing away, he missed spending hours in his workshop. He always had. Unlike his father, Tony didn’t enjoy the politics of running a company and being the world’s most eligible asshole.
“Alright people, it’s game time.”
for technology and weapons.
Harley’s chest is heaving heavily, and they both stare at each other. Tony bursts into laughter, falling into his swivel chair with a guffaw.
“What’s the matter, the drop in your stocks got your tongue?”
That does mean there’s a chance, a very slim one, that Tony can withstand whatever forces or powers that be long enough to hit rewind. Tony knows that the hardest part of all will be choosing when to stop. How many can he save? He already knows the answer isn’t going to be enough to satiate him.
“Listen do you want another chance to stab that giant dickbag or not? Because I’d really like to see him get stabbed a couple hundred times.”
“I am Tony Stark,” He grunts as he gets up, balling his fists.
He doesn't know where he stands with Steve, the leader of the Avengers. The good Captain, who has shown time and time again that he'll stand by what he believes to be right. He can't hate him anymore, there's nothing but gratitude that he's alive left in the gaps that two years without him created. Given his frosty reception the other day, it doesn't look like he'd be eager to work with Tony.
Steve awoke the same way he has for the past 2 years: sitting upright with a bolt of movement, sweat trickling down his brow; fingers resting on the phone in his pocket.
“Plus, Ghost needed a little beefing up, Friday was too perky. He’s gruff as hell and can tell a mean bedtime story.” Aiming - and failing - to sound light hearted, Tony looks at the boy. Jeeze, Harley’s mom must be gone, his friends too… It has to be a really crappy situation to be ending up on Tony’s doorstep. “Hey come on, don’t make me ask him to sing ‘twinkle twinkle little star’ or something.”
“Tony. You need to rest, not dwell in the shower.”
“Yeah, well keep your comments to yourself next time.” Tony says, moving to the workstation, “Dummy, bring me the welder. Ghost, play the rock playlist.”
Tony accepts this, too exhausted to argue with a being that has endless energy to do so. Still, if he wants to achieve anything in his battle against Thanos, he
He hauls himself across it, shuffling his body so that he’s no longer submerged in the water. His whole body is heavy and dripping, his chest still heaving; eyes wet from being under for so long. It’s got a musty smell, the scent wrapping around his senses and taking him away with it.
Not that any of it matters now.
14 million possibilities, faster than Jarvis could run them if he wasn’t a conscious red being now, and this is how things had to go down. Fuck that. Fuck this. Fuck
“Why are you offering that, when you are yourself in disrepair. I haven’t got much experience with humans, and though Quill had his reasons to hate me…”
? it shouldn’t hurt as much as it does to think about him, but it does.
It’s a phrase he’s been saying to himself since they started passing planets he could recognise. If they were on Titan, the biggest of Saturn’s moons, then they’ve just passed Jupiter. Being this close to these planets makes Tony feel a little bit giddy. Almost as though a piece of his childhood has awakened at being in space, outer space, in what is technically an alien spaceship – just like an astronaut. That could be the dehydration, or the blood loss giving him the impression that he’s completely out of it. He flexes his fingers, distracted. At this speed Nebula is going to get him home in no time. He’s not exactly sure he’s ready for that.
“Rhodey,” Tony greets back, taking his seat.
His Dad would hate him for how he’s treated Captain America and half his team. His friends. People who he let get too close, and his paranoid little brain shooed them away to the point where he didn’t even recognise his actions from logic or fear.
“Barely, glad to see you are too.” His tone is shakier than what he’s used to, his vocal cords still trying to get over all the screaming he’s been doing lately.
“Pepper!?”
“Go build something, I want to see.”
“Sorry, it’s just… Two video game references, from you? I mean that’s Kratos. What happened to the Mechanic I knew and when did he get so cool?”
Natasha gives Steve a glare, because clearly their friendship has flourished since their exile which only fuels Tony’s spite further. Steve backs down.
His tongue feels laden in his mouth, his throat constricted with words he doesn’t know how to say. Finding his falsest bravado, he takes a breath.
Tony knows. There’s nothing better than beating someone of an intellectual level as well as a physical fight. Hammer taught him that, because he gave him the chance not only to destroy him with might, but with a brilliance unique to Tony alone.
She nodded, still regarding him with an unearthly comprehension mixed with robotic dismissal.
“Don’t tell anyone Wizard, I know where you live.” Tony motions to the room, trying to sound convincing, and if anything, seeing a genuine human smile is worth it.
Harley is sitting on the floor, cradling the mask to his face. Quickly marching over, he wrenches the plate away from him.
He walks to a glowing piece of metal on the table against the wall, opposite the monitors. A memento from Sokovia that had been splintered by Thor’s lightening. It kept an iridescent glow and Tony wondered if it was connected to Thor’s hammer in some way. Probably not, though, after Mjolnir was destroyed it is more likely to be a mass of charged, useless particles. That leaves Tony with option two. His plan currently consists of hacking the International Space Station and broadcasting a frequency out there that hopefully Thor will understand and respond to. And accomplishing all of that, without accidentally inviting every alien race to Earth or not getting arrested for compromising Government property. Breathing harshly through his nose, he rubs a hand across his brow.
“You had been unresponsive for an hour; your vital signs were dropping. I thought that Jarvis may help you to return, but when that also failed I simply checked your contacts until someone answered. A female, Shuri, adapted the call to a video link.”
“Can’t chat, Steve.” He tips the bots so they run down his neck and into the wound. The burning sensation is so much worse than before, and a scream tears from his lips. “Busy, doing… Stuff.”
and extreme anguish that was fluttering in his stomach and up his throat.
“I guess this is goodbye then, thanks for being my latest designated driver,” He smiles blasé, an attempt at being confident again in spite of the
The idea flits past him, and it quiets the anxiety running through his veins. He can feel it, the water that’s coming in as gulps and gasps now. The corners of his vision blurring with the obsidian surroundings, the way his whole body begins to go limp.
“We’re making slow progress it’s a very delicate procedure, you have been out for an hour Sir. I suggest you take another shot of whisky.” Ghost says finally and Tony is more than happy to oblige with doctor’s orders.
Thanos. All he needs is to have a stronger blast, or magnet. Something with a bit more juice to hold off both Thanos’ power and the Gauntlet.
At first, he was ecstatic Tony was alive. The last he’d seen of him was the Iron Man suit heading into space. It could have been a decoy, Steve knows Tony got engaged to Pepper, but Spider Man followed him up there. There’s no way Tony would let that kid out of his sight. Steve had time to ponder this, you see, because Ghost (another AI) called Bruce and Shuri walked them through making it a video feed, for peace of mind of all parties. That was when things went south. Although Ghost had warned them, Steve doesn’t think any of them were ready to see the state Tony was in.
To compartmentalise the way Tony’s brain likes to: build the suit, distract Scrotum-Hulk and keep the fist open. He’d almost managed it once, with next to no planning specifically
Turning, Thor began to walk towards Rocket. He offered his hand to the other, a tired smile on his face.
At the moment, a reporter is standing at ground level where the old Avengers Tower used to be; there are people dressed up in disfigured outfits of the various heroes, spraying the sidewalk with numerous creative and unflattering slurs. The overweight man in a Captain America suit makes a thrusting motion and then flips off the camera, which is so not Steve Tony almost laughs at it.
“It has become a real issue.” Ghost deadpans, and Tony can’t help the snicker he makes. Ghost could make good news sound bad.
Tony was scared because he saw himself in Thanos too. Tony was just about on the same path with Ultron. He thought he knew better, could provide a safe world for everyone because what’s better than a self-learning AI than a whole army of them? He was wrong. He was wrong quite often.
“Easy,” Tony says, patting him awkwardly on the shoulder. He doesn’t remember this age well, spending too much time drunk or on the inside of a tool box, “I’ve made some mistakes, kid. Big ones. I’m trying to fix one of them right now.” He looks to the side of Harley’s head, imagining his own Dad having this conversation with him. Not that he ever did. “The second I got back on my feet I had Ghost looking for you.”
Flexing her appendages, testing their ability, and no doubt assessing his own merit she nods to him.
“On foot, there is an alley 5 meters behind you. They have aggravated your wound.”
He had zoned out. Quite spectacularly. The girl was regarding him with careful guarded eyes, her own cogs physically humming and whirring.
Steve almost dares to hope, to believe that Tony can do it. He’s brilliant, amazing, but the thought of trying to fix this mess on his own will kill Tony. Tony’s greatest enemy has always been himself, everybody who got to know him learned that.
Tony was still crying. But that had to stop now.
Tony glanced at the panel to his left, fingers brushing against the side of his worktop. The Anti Avengers situation just got a hell of a lot worse – for him anyway. Those kids who cornered him the other day only went and blabbed to the papers. Now there’s some crazy witch hunt going on, with his head on a spike as the prize. He grimaces. Finding Wong had been a necessity, he needed that intel. Half of New York is going to be out looking for him, a quarter of them calling him everything you can think of under the sun and the rest will be impervious to why he matters at all... It’s added stress he didn’t want to deal with. The risk of being caught unawares was starting to get to Tony too; if he’s trapped on a street again the chances of it going south is definite.
He flings everything off the table, lying himself down across it. His chest constricts at the movement, ribs clutching a vice grip around his lungs. Sputtering, he moves his shaky hands to the blade. If he doesn’t hurry up he’ll be too dead to do anything about it, anyway.
The problem is, he is starting to think Thanos wasn’t wrong. Not about the mass genocide of course, morally, personally and legally Tony knows that thinking anyone has the right to make that choice is ridiculous. However, as Thanos had said, they are both cursed with knowledge.
Thank you so much for reading, any comments would be really appreciated :)
“I need to make a stop,” He says, wiping his hands of the grease and blood, the grazes still sluggishly bleeding, “Then I know where I need you to take me.”
Thank you so much for reading!
Desperately, he tries not to picture her final moments. Hands clasped tight around the phone that she is certain he won’t call her on but finds comfort in hoping anyway. The brown Louis Vuitton shoes that were her favourites tapping restlessly on his marble flooring. Her brow creased in a frown, the piece of hair that she keeps trying to tuck behind her ear; the inner of her lip that she bites when she’s frustrated.
and that in itself had been too much to handle. Then he was peeling, disintegrating,
Mechanic. Building. Panic attacks. Flashbacks.
The last bit is muttered but it might as well have been yelled in Tony’s face.
“You mean that old storage dump of your Dad’s, sure.”
“I panicked, I thought you guys weren’t friends after the big fight thing.” Harley turns his back, looking at the screen with a very confused and disgruntled Steve on the other side. He picks up the old faceplate from the armour that saved him on Titan, fingers rolling over the coarse metal.
“Sir-“
about what he’s thinking about right now. In order to test these bots, he was going to revert back to his mad scientist training. Tony learned better than anyone that if you want to know what the reaction is going to be, your best bet is to try it yourself. His hypothesis usually ended with him getting hurt, but what’s a few more bumps to a washed-up hero? There might be improvements on his health but it’s not like he can fling himself around… Who is he kidding? All of his impulse control floated away a few weeks ago.
“I… Honestly, I have no idea.” He manages, suddenly realising that going to Earth means dealing with the fallout. He’s starting to wish that he’d been left with no other option on that dust planet.
“We haven’t got much time, G, so keep an eye us, would you?” Tony says, offhand, picking up the petri dish he’d placed on the table with his free hand.
Shaking his head, Tony puts down the pliers. The twinge in his chest is back, and he can hear rather than feel the force with which he’s trying to breathe. It’s one of the moments where he knows there’s an even chance of him having a full-blown attack or just defaulting to his factory settings; through his panic he notices Ghost. He’s learned that about himself, or the AI, that whenever he feels panicked, dimming the lights and playing Pink Floyd in the room helps. He doesn’t know why. Maybe it’s how it amplifies the glow of his bots, his panels, all the things he built himself to make him feel less… Lonely.
They take a taxi to cover the majority of the distance, Harley sulkily silent as Tony discusses with Ghost on his ear piece about what kind of energy source he needs to build. He didn’t think about grabbing his phone before leaving, so Harley uses the last of his cash to pay the cab before they finish the walk into the abandoned rocky plains.
. Anyone else would be grateful, glad to be on their own turf. He felt the crushing force of gravity, those 3.5 billion lives pressing against his skull.
“Why? There will be nothing but more dust waiting for you there.”
So, yes. If anyone knows the sacrifice, the misjudgement, miscalculations that Thanos has made it’s assuredly him. The sacrifices. The arrogance. He swallows thickly, wiping his hands down his pants that are still half covered in armour. Sighing, he closes his eyes.
On the table, Tony stares down at his feet. He takes one of the syringes and opens the petri dish with the first completed sample of nanobots. With his free hand, he makes a small incision along the top of his foot.
His vision begins to blur, like everything has slowed down or that one time he got extremely high. Normally he could blame exhaustion, but he knows this is a lot worse and will take a lot more than a simple nap to fix.
“You need to talk to him,” Natasha says, from behind him. He’s not sure when she moved.
“Right, you,” He paused, because he didn’t really remember her name, “Interstellar, or whatever,” she was glaring at him but he was too drained to care. “How’d you get here, by ship? You have a ship?”
It doesn’t matter. There was now a half decent boot on a foot, and he must have hit his head harder than he thought because he’s standing dumbly grinning at his feet. Forcing the nanobots back into his body was harder than it should have been, requiring him to sit down again.
Ash floats around him as he curls around the shoes. All gone; they’re not coming back. There’s ash on his clothes, his fingers are painted white. The more he tries to wipe it off the worse it seems to cover him. He’s having an attack again, the bile rising in his throat alongside the thrum of his erratic heartbeat. He has to get out of here. Awkwardly fumbling to his feet, he bolts for the door.
“Nat, you look better.” He aims to sound less like he’s rasping at Death’s door, but judging by her expression, she wasn’t buying it.
He'd gotten so used to people following his orders without question that, of course, the son of Howard Stark would be the one to do a constant 180 on him. Tony didn’t listen to anyone, sometimes not even himself, and that agitated Steve to no end. The truth though, the truth snuffs all that anger out. He likes Tony too much
“Banner,” He slurs because, sue him, he’s having both an outer and inner body experience right now; this could just be another part of the simulation after all. The extreme pain he’s in appears to lean in the favour of it being real, though. “Had a moon thrown at me.”
“Tony,” He says, weary but fond.
He still had the formula for Extremis - and not the half botched one - the formula he fixed, thank you. Mixing his nanotech with Extremis had some interesting results. The first time he tried it, it blew up half his desk, which was fun. He’d been busy refining his bots after that. Making them smaller, stronger and less likely to spontaneously combust. With a couple more tweaks, he’ll get Ghost to start running the numbers properly, and after that… He’ll inject himself and hope his brain can withstand his madness one more time.
Pepper deserves to be happy. And dealing with Tony’s shit? Thinking that the next fight could be his last, not knowing whether he’ll be diving into an interdimensional wormhole or boarding a massive alien ship and disappearing just when the world needed him most… It’s a life best lead solitary. Solitary is an old friend to Tony, at least.
“Wong, it’s been a pleasure. Could you portal me up to Stark Industries basement level and then to my super-secret hideout?”
, would feel better than it did. That it wouldn't look so different, that he wouldn't be able to sense the change. The weight of billions being removed from the surface, like a physical sensation shouldn't be evident. Coming closer, it’s not just the same vestiges of rock and water that he’d left. Everything was
It would be on the same lines as the Extremis project, but smarter. He’s at the wheel of it so it’ll be more elegant and engineered than Hansen or Killian could ever have dreamed. Frantically scribbling on the board, he begins to outlay plans for the adjustments and facilities he’d need to synthesise it. If he could inject himself with this technology, his suit would be him, one and the same. All it would take was a series of synapses controlled by a single thought and his suit would be there, ready to rebuild and adapt on the fly. The suit could rebuild itself
“Oh, that,” Tony smiles; remembering the better days when the world wasn’t full of ash and hatred. “A friend wouldn’t stop going on about it, you’d have liked him.”
His head jerks up at the sound of her voice. He blinks rapidly, he hadn’t fallen asleep, he had just been waiting and then-
He thought he’d be used to how cool it is to walk through portals by now (for once, not into outer space and impending doom) and yet, the novelty isn’t lost on him. He’s able to get the titanium alloys he needs, along with some more specialist equipment, and move them to his den in one simple throw. It’s a high point of his time back on Earth.
Steve hadn’t got a clue what he was going to say to Tony when they were both healthy and the world hadn’t partially ended; he was at a complete loss at what to say to him now. Nat and Bruce exchanged their pleasantries, and then Tony just looked at him. His stupid calculating eyes breezing over him like Steve was the one who, apparently, had a moon thrown at him and somehow got back from outer space to be performing surgery on himself.
, “Nope.”
Wasn’t this the same teenager preaching that Tony could take on this whole crowd only seconds ago?
“No,” Wong raises an eyebrow and gestures for him to follow, which he does, with some difficulty, “But there were measures put in place, believe it or not disaster plans have been all the rage since the battle of New York.”
Cold marble slaps beneath his bare feet, and the sharp pain sends him careening forward onto all fours. A few seconds later, he feels something growing around his toes. He rolls onto his ass, grabbing the offending foot into his hand. Armour plate is messily assembling itself around the sole of his foot; it’s warmer than he expected it to feel.
“Ghost, I’ve just read all the Wikihows, seriously? I’m a genius and I’m the most qualified person here, I have to do this.”
, electronics and building is kind of my gig. I know there’re plenty of parts on this ship. So, is there a way I can help you?”
He hmphs in reply, irritably tapping the desk while he waits.
He places a book into Tony’s hands, and then opens a portal chucking more through with an astounding amount of accuracy.
“Great, but don’t ever use Dummy like that again. I need to know that I’m me… That it’s my brain in there and I’m the one controlling it ok?”
“You needed it and should call again after some rest, Sir.”
The books Wong had let him borrow were the worst part of it all. Even with Ghost scanning over half the material, he’d learnt very little about the stones architecture or the gauntlet. Half of his work space had books splayed across them, with every available digital service covered in annotations and ramblings from Tony’s mind. With each stone came its own board, he’d categorised it into flaws, strengths and possible loopholes.
“Hey,” Nat says, her voice hard, dropping into the seat beside him, “Thor and Rocket left last night.”
“G, what’s the best course of action here?” He asks, slightly panicked. Losing his armour would be bad and if he keeps taking hits like a punching bag he won’t be doing much better. Hurting one of the group would be much worse. He doesn’t know if he could live with himself if he did that.
. Tony was going to goddamn figure out how to fix this mess just so that he can punch that god-awful wizard in the face himself.
Honestly, this is going to be the slowest burn to ever burn slow for the Steve/Tony, but I promise, they'll get there!1!
“You need to get up, Tony.”
He raises an eyebrow half surprised, half troubled. Fondling the broken gauntlet, he turns an accusing gaze at the ceiling, as if he was scorning a child.
Painstakingly, he turns around. The world spins, leaving him nauseas and with no better a bearing than earlier. It’s only time he’s wasting now, something he has so little of; his resolve is quite quickly deteriorating.
he thinks irritably, compelling his limbs into action. Thank God Pepper used to drag him on her morning jogs, or he would have had to of hailed a cab by now. That's all a distant dream, somewhere deep and unobtainable in the backs of his mind. The streets are bustling, and several people are pointing at him, whipping their phones out to record Iron Man sprinting down the street. It occurs to him after the first block that he’s probably going to be in more trouble in the suit than out of it at this point, unless one hundred percent necessary. He risks a breather behind a dumpster and wills the bots back into his body, his skin crawling at the sensation of them moving.
“Did I code sass directly into your mainframe or is that something you’re learning from somewhere else,” Tony scoffs, “And on another note, I never gave you permission to make that call the other day, so what the hell is with you?!”
It was malicious and he knew it. It was more ruthless than he thought himself capable. He found that he didn’t care. He didn’t give a flying fuck what monster he had to become to take Thanos on. He’d find him and make things right. As right as he could, anyway.
in the middle of nowhere. Hiding in plain sight… Almost.
He couldn’t count (Jarvis could) how much of his life has been spent nearly blowing himself up trying to build new things. People assume he’s a selfish bastard and, really, he does little to deter their opinions. He started out in the weapons business and he knows better than anyone that nothing will change his dark past.
“Jarvis?!” He tries to scream but bubbles and a strangled sound are all that he can produce.
“Dummy!” He says, exasperated. “The tray is right there
His voice is airy, light, his eyes following Dummy as his bot rolls backwards to scoot away from him.
He can't bear his overactive imagination any longer. He’s on the floor, crying into the mud. First Peter, then Pepper. The forest morphs around him, he barely notices, except he’s now standing in a hallway.
“Any luck on finding out what the gauntlet is made of yet, G?” Tony asks, keeping his eyes trained on the screen.
Rocket slumped at this, allowing Thor’s palm to brush along the short fur on his head.
"How's your head?"
Tony was the first to shoo the other off. "Anyway, don't you have some sort of scientific breakthrough to spearhead?"
Humming in reply, Bucky began to stretch while he waited for Steve to elaborate.
"I'm so sorry, Tony. I almost can't believe that even happened, to be honest."
Bucky shrugged, deliberately casual. "I killed his parents, Steve. Information that you purposefully kept from him. Honestly, I'm surprised that he is even remotely civil towards us."
"Nah, I'm good." Tony's stomach rumbled again right as he said this, and Steve laughed, the sound sending a pleasant but confusing warmth through Tony's body. He ignored it in favour of picking at some lint on his shirt.
Putting on some classic rock and turning it up almost obnoxiously loud, Tony ignored his growing headache and settled down at a work bench, Dum-E sidling over to wait faithfully by his side.
Now that I have seen Endgame, it's obviously not compliant.
Tony nodded without thinking and paid for it when pain exploded behind his eyes. Hissing between clenched teeth, he leaned heavily into Steve as he was propped up into a seated position. The captain looked him over, cursing when saw the deep indent on the back of Tony's helmet. Steve barked orders into his communicator, his authoritative tone becoming frantic as Tony began to teeter to one side.
Tony crashed heavily into the ground, his vision blurring as sharp pain flared from the back of his head. The metallic scent of blood flooded his helmet as nausea threatened to overwhelm him. Groaning while he flipped over onto his back, Tony forced down bile to rasp, "F.R.I.D.A.Y, please tell me I didn't just take a missile to the back of the head."
An ominous rumble echoed down the tunnels, but Tony made no indication of noticing. Forcing his way over, using his shield to make a clear path, Steve ordered, "F.R.I.D.A.Y, deactivate the suit. I've got him." When the inventor was freed, he fell heavily into the Steve's arms. Tony was shaking, cheek clammy against his own, and when Steve shifted to look into those brown eyes, it was clear that Tony's mind was anywhere but there.
Ushering her out of the room,  Tony quickly got dressed, being careful around the back of his head which was still tender. He was thankful that his Black Sabbath shirt was unharmed - he had many, but this was one of his favourites. Once suited up, Tony made a quick exit into the cool night air, giving F.R.I.D.A.Y. the driver's seat so he could relax for the short flight home.
Steve managed only another few minutes before his attention waned again, and this time he ended up stumbling forwards into nothing when Bucky neatly side-stepped him. Steve tried changing tactics to rush aggressively towards his friend, but it was sloppy, and Barnes was able to easily dodge the attack. To the captain's annoyance, Bucky had barely broken a sweat while he himself was already beginning to pant from exertion.
Steve smiled sheepishly, and was about to continue speaking when Bucky walked in on them, his expression wary and posture tense. The sight of Barnes startled Tony, who tried to cover it up by brushing past Steve and waving dismissively at him.
