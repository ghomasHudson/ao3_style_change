“I will literally wait as long as you need. You’re it, Cas. You’re just—you’re—you’re the love of my life, man.”
Waking up was… Dean almost wonders if it actually happened the way he remembers it, because it was just too nice.
He hadn’t known what to expect once he finally said those words, but it feels amazing. Like turning a key and snapping open a lock, Dean feels like he’s about to enter a whole new place. He’s about to step into a world he’s always been curious about, but he’s just never had the courage to open the door. Until now. Until Cas forced his hand.
“Estimate, buddy,” Dean says, and he cannot get the smile off his face. It will not budge; he’s beaming like he’s won the lottery.
(Not that Sam is gonna find out about Cas any time soon. On some level Dean knows he should at least think about telling Sam that he’s in contact with Cas, but it’s not a level he has any interest in paying attention to right now.)
“This is—I mean this is awesome, dude. I can’t believe I’m actually talking to you right now and not just praying at you. Hearing your voice, it’s just—it’s great. It’s awesome. This is awesome,” Dean says.
“Yeah so, Sam always tries to be around the bunker during off-weeks to keep me company or whatever. Tries not to take any jobs that’ll keep him away too long. He’s been held up a couple extra days with this ghost hunt, though.”
“Oh-ho, no, trust me. That is the horniest thing I’ve ever heard of. I won’t be swayed on this one. Sorry, buddy.”
“So how are you, Dean? Other than the obvious,” Cas says, swiftly changing the subject. Dean doesn’t blame him.
“What do you think will happen here, huh? You think I’ll just forget this and move on? You’re out of your goddamn mind. You’re a fucking idiot, Cas. You can hide as long as you want. You will never get rid of me, Cas. It’s just not happening.”
, Cas? How could you listen to me all those months and not—why wouldn’t you just come and see me? Why weren’t you—I—I mean didn’t you—why didn’t you—”
Amal pulls the receipt off the register while Dean bags the last few items himself, intent on never making eye contact with another human being again in his life.
Dean would be worried that he’s saying too much, but considering the point that he’s  having to belabor, he probably doesn’t need to worry about Cas extrapolating anything from Dean’s words too early. Apparently Cas can barely fathom that someone would want him around at all, so Dean doubts he’d assume the larger truth behind Dean’s words—that Dean wants him around
Excruciating. That was just excruciating. He stuck to the script better than he’d expected, but he still wants to roll off his bed and then roll right under it, never to be seen again.
“Really?” The tone of Cas’ voice makes Dean turn to look at him, which is a mistake because he’s got an eyebrow raised and he’s pinning Dean with a shrewd look. “You’ve always struck me as more the submissive type.”
That sense of being in a different dimension that Dean had felt earlier creeps back in. It builds like a rollercoaster creeping uphill.
Closing his eyes, Dean kisses Cas’s hand now. All over his knuckles, Dean places small, slightly open-mouthed kisses, along with a bit of moisture from the inside of his lips. He lets his teeth bump into a knuckle once, hears Cas’s sharp inhale, and smiles against Cas’s hand. He keeps kissing, but adds the smallest of bites every so often -  a light drag of his tooth over Cas’s skin. Dean has never in his life shown so much affection to a single hand. Or any single body part, for that matter, except during sex.
“Hello,” the cashier greets him, in a completely normal way that doesn’t hint towards having heard Dean talk to himself yet. Things could be worse.
Not that Dean isn’t aware of what Cas said. He knows. He knows the entire speech by heart; it’s burned into his memory. He’s replayed it in his mind a thousand times.
Right now, Dean is washing the dishes from breakfast. Normal, mundane stuff. But instead of fighting through anger and mourning to accomplish anything, he can just... open his mouth and chat with Cas. Right there. And—with no one in the bunker to possibly overhear them—they’re all alone. He can say whatever he wants.
“Sorry, I’m just stuck on one thing. You were too afraid to face me, but at the same time, you were saying sexy things trying to get me off. How was that supposed to go? Were we eventually gonna work up to full-on phone sex, and then… what? You were just gonna do that forever?”
He’s back to staring straight ahead of him, and he can tell that Cas is doing the same. That’s fine. They can do this their way; there’s no one here to judge them.
Talking to Cas throughout his daily life had been one of the most calming, intrinsically good experiences he’s ever had. He misses it.
“Okay. Well. The point is. The point is, I just want to be with you. However it is you wanna do that, I’m down. I really am. So just.”
, if you needed to,” Cas said, which started an affectionate little argument that lasted all the way into the kitchen.
“It’s Cas. You know? It’s Cas. I spent too long worrying about all that. I’ve lost him too many times, Sam. I can’t really care about all that stuff anymore. So I just want him to know, you know? I don’t want my crap to keep Cas from getting what he wants. He deserves to get everything he wants. He can have it. I want him to have it. And I want him to know that.” Dean stops. Takes a deep breath, because that was a lot. Then he wraps it up. “And that means you’re gonna have to know at some point anyway, so. There you go.”
Dean stares at Cas, who won’t meet his eyes. He’s fucking cute as hell, Jesus Christ. Dean apparently can’t tell for shit when Cas is lying, but right now he has a hunch. There’s an inkling, and it’s enough that Dean can’t control the smugness in the smile he finally lets through. When he speaks, he doesn’t try to hide how pleased he is.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t—I mean... I’m sorry he ended up like that. I know it’s not what you wanted for him,” Dean says.
Dean gives Cas the full update on all of their friends. Then they talk about the small vampire nest Dean cleared out by himself last month (“Stupid idea, Dean.” “Yeah, yeah. I’m not doing it again, trust me.”) They talk about Sam and Eileen. They talk about the spellbooks Dean just found in the storeroom. They talk about the new Western that’s in theaters, and Dean somehow finds himself promising he’ll actually go see it. They talk about the haunted community theater he and Sam took care of a while back. They talk about the black ice Dean slipped on in the parking lot that same night. They talk about everything and nothing.
He doesn’t figure it out. He just hums here and there in response to Cas until the man who’d looked at him has paid for his groceries and walked away. It’s Dean’s turn now, and the cashier smiles at him expectantly.
Amal pulls a small crossbody bag from underneath the register and swings the strap over their head until the bag rests on their hip. They take out a red stick of lip balm and apply it quickly like it’s just a habit. Then they smile slyly at Dean, who’s still staring.
“How about everyone else? Claire?” Cas prompts, and Dean almost laughs with relief at the change of subject.
“What really gets me is you were—you were just—you were just ready to let me live without you. Even though you could have—I mean you were there all along. You would have waited until, when? Until I died? Would you have even come to me then? I mean am I—am I ever gonna see you again?”
“Hey Cas. You’ll be happy to know you’ve inspired me to make my bedroom habitable for human life again,” Dean says.
Cas doesn’t say anything right away, and Dean gets it. That was pretty bold, pretty different from the way Dean had been before.
Dean realizes he’s taking deep breaths to calm himself down. He takes a moment to be impressed with himself for doing that subconsciously, and then he has to take another moment to be impressed with himself for allowing himself to be impressed with himself. Being loved by Cas is seriously, really good for him.
“I did wonder about your choice of songs,” Cas says. “I almost thought… But then I convinced myself that you were just a closet romantic, and that by giving me the tape you were sharing a side of yourself that you usually hide. Because we’re best friends.”
“You saved $13.08 today,” Amal says as they hand over the receipt. “You saved the end of my shift, too. I was bored out of my mind.”
It’s silly, but Dean loves that Cas goes out of his way to say “around four hours” instead of rattling off the exact duration from the top of his head the way Dean knows he can do. It’s a habit Cas has formed in the last few years. Dean’s not sure whether it’s a deliberate attempt to seem less alien to humans, or something he just picked up by accident. Either way, it’s endearing.
Dean spends the first half of the drive home feeling like he’s been caught flirting with someone else by his significant other. Except he hadn’t been flirting, and Cas isn’t his boyfriend.
“Of course,” Cas says, and the suspiciously casual tone has been replaced by something… not casual. Dean can’t identify it for the life of him, but it’s not casual.
No… He can’t do this. Dean is already on the floor. There isn’t any lower to go. He can’t get any more dramatic about this.
Dean rests his forehead on the steering wheel and tries to breathe without breaking into sobs. He takes a deep breath in and out. Tips his head side to side, because part of him has to keep moving. This desperate feeling in his chest is like a motor that’s always wound up, and he’s gonna start punching things if he tries to keep still. But it’s not enough. His hands come up to grip the steering wheel on either side of his face, and he squeezes hard enough to hurt his fingers. It’s not enough. He reaches his thumbs out to dig into the sides of his head, just above his brow. It’s not enough.
“Dude, I don’t even hold up my end of the deal when he’s around. I end up taking a couple books to bed with me most nights. I still scale it back, and that’s the point. But now I’m—” Dean cuts himself off.
“I’m gonna have a hell of a hard time saying this, I’m warning you now. But I need you to know that it’s only hard to say it. That’s the only part that’s hard, Cas, because other than that? This has been the easiest thing in my life. In my
It has the intended effect: Cas snaps right back into eye contact. Dean squeezes Cas’s hands between his own.
There’s a small smile pulling at the corners of his mouth. Dean can’t look away. He’s struck again by the magnitude of the situation.
It’s Dean’s turn to speak anyway, because he really needs to clear this up. He tightens his grip around Cas’s hand and draws his breath. This part won’t be as easy as holding hands, but it’s more important.
Dean turns off the engine and sits in the quiet for a while. He keeps his voice softer when he continues praying.
Dean’s eyes are closed again, but he’s smiling so big around his words that they’re hard to get out.
Part of Dean wants to smooth it over and move on, but he doesn’t let himself. If they’re going to examine Cas’s misunderstanding of Dean’s feelings, it’s only fair they do it in reverse as well. Because shit, Dean had really misunderstood Cas. For a long time, for as long as he’s known him - he misunderstood his feelings, misconstrued his actions, and misidentified his motives. He’d missed this; they’d missed each other, passed right by, too wrapped up in their own issues to see the other clearly. Dean is planting them firmly face-to-face now, holding them in place so they can’t look away from each other. They’ll drag their mutual misconceptions into the open and prod at them until they crumble into dust. As difficult as that may be.
But he meant it when he said that Cas deserves everything he wants. So why should Cas have to seek it out, when Dean could just give it to him?
And of course Cas would assume that Dean is doing what a normal person would do: pretend to be on the phone so he’s not talking to himself.
The guy in line in front of Dean, who’d been browsing the magazines, turns his head to see who Dean is talking to. He doesn’t find anyone because Dean is technically talking to a voice in his head.
“All we’ve been doing is talking, lately. Just not about the right things. Come on, baby. Come talk to me. I wanna see you. ”
They’re still going at it by the time Dean is done with the morning’s dishes. (And yesterday’s, and the day before. He does a lot of dishes.) He and Cas talk the whole afternoon, through the evening, and into the night once again.
Dean legit wants to cry at the implication that he’d only seek Cas out if he needed something from him. His resolve to have this conversation strengthens, because that’s messed up. He messed up with Cas, over and over. Time and again he’s failed to let Cas know how much he’s valued. How can he even begin to fix that?
When Dean starts to speak, his lips are still brushing Cas’s hand. Speaking directly into Cas. Voice a bit muffled, but as sincere as Dean can sound.
“Goddammit Cas, don’t you dare disappear on me now. Cas? Cas! I know you can hear me. You think you can just keep on listening and never talk to me again? What’s the plan here, Cas? I really want to know,” Dean says, getting angrier with every word.
“I know I said I’d be here when you’re ready and I still stand by that,” Dean says, getting right to it. “But that doesn’t mean I can’t keep askin’, right? I can still tell you how much I want you to come back. Even just to talk. Even if you don’t want to actually show up here, just talk to me again, man. I need you.”
“You might not be risking your life much anymore, but you don’t seem to be living for yourself, either,” Cas is saying now as Dean sits down with his plate.
of it, because nobody is around to see it. Nobody is here to see the goofy smiles, or the blushes, or the way he’ll sometimes have to just lie down on the floor to continue talking or he’ll fall over. And nobody was here to see what he did in the library the other day, either...
Dean picks up a t-shirt off the ground that he knows he hasn’t worn since it’s been washed, because he’s been wearing the same three shirts. It’s probably been on the floor this whole time. He has no way of knowing, so he decides to just wash all the clothes that aren’t put away.
“Thank you, Dean,” Cas says, pointedly magnanimous. Dean rolls his eyes. “You’d look good in more form-fitting clothes too, you know.”
“I think I understand what you mean about the bed vs. the couch. Here on the bed, there’s a lot of space for me to just push you over and pin you down... It’s really, really distracting.”
Dean awoke slowly, and instead of the usual crashing realization that Cas is gone, a completely different kind of memory washed over him. It doused him in a kind of giddy excitement that surprised him in its intensity.
Cas is sitting on his bed, upright against the headboard with a book in his lap that he’d apparently been reading. But his eyes are already trained on Dean as if he’d heard him coming and had been staring at the door to see if he’d come in.
“Yeah - I mean, yeah, man. I knew you cared about us, and I knew you were different than the other angels,” Dean explains. “But I didn’t - I dunno, I just assumed. So I called you my brother because that’s what you already know, right? The other angels are like your brothers and sisters.”
Amal’s smile is wide and indulgent, and Dean wonders if this person can read minds or something. Dean knows he’s attractive, but he didn’t think he was attractive enough to make up for acting like a flustered idiot. His flustered idiocy actually seems to be part of the appeal, which is so novel to Dean that he’s having trouble processing literally anything.
“No buts! Time spent on you is time spent on myself, because I need you. End of story,” Dean says, and then shoves a huge bite of sandwich into his mouth to shut himself up for a second.
“You’ll have to tell me all about it later. I know you said you were in Heaven, but are you always there? Do you go anywhere else? Are you working on anything? I hope you’re not dealing with any more power-hungry angels or cosmic-scale battles or anything. I know it would mean you had a good reason to keep away from me all this time, but to be honest? I’d rather be pissed at you for being a dumbass than for you to have been in danger. We can deal with you being a dumbass. Done it before and we can do it again. And I’ve got a feeling we’ll be doing it forever. No offense.”
Is it that obvious? From just one short prayer and a conversation, Cas can tell how pathetic Dean has been? Just crying and whining all the time about how bad he feels that he hasn’t saved Cas yet… Every day, multiple times a day. For months. On some level, Dean is deeply embarrassed about it. But it’s like a parallel level of himself that exists outside of his current reality—he can’t really
He’s thought it through a thousand times, and he can’t come to any other conclusion. Cas died because he loved Dean. Because he was in love with Dean.
There’s an audible gulp beside him, and there, that’s the spot. Dean feels that squirming happy feeling in his gut again, the one that apparently comes from getting a reaction out of Cas. He’s emboldened anew, and looks to his right to see that Cas is now looking down at his own hands.
“Hey Cas. Hope you’re not too busy. I’ve got some things I wanna say and—and it might take a while. I’ve been meaning to say this for a long time, but I really wanted to do it in person. That’s it, man, I just wanted to say it to your face. And I wanted you to be free and alive when I said it. But you are alive, and you’re out there, and you— you’re okay,” Dean prays. “And you won’t come down and see me. So I’m gonna just have to do it like this. Not sure if that’s respecting your boundaries, but you haven’t told me to stop praying yet, so…”
“Moving on is a good idea,” Cas says. “I don’t think a potion would work unless you wanted a one-way trip. You’d have to take the risk that the dose for the return trip actually makes it with you. I don’t have any confidence that it’s possible to bring something like that along.”
“And, uh, I‘ve thought a lot about this next part. I have spent years thinking about this, so I need you to believe me. So, um, I don’t even know if you enjoy sex, or if you would want that with me. If you do, great. I would really, um, I mean, that would be cool. But if you don’t want that, Cas, it’s fine. I’m serious. I don’t need that with you, or with anyone. I swear on my life I’d never have sex with another person again if I could just be with you. Whatever that means for you. I mean, I know you want something more than what we were doing before, I just don’t know how far that goes. I’d love to kiss you. Like I’d really go for that. And if you want to sleep with me; like just sleep in my bed, or read or whatever if you don’t sleep… I just want you in my bed. But not like, sexually. I mean I do want that, but if I had to choose I’d choose just sleeping with you. Having you there next to me. And when it comes to sex, I’d be just fine taking care of myself for the rest of eternity. I mean, I hope it’s okay that I’ll think about you, though. Not even about you doing anything, but just your voice. The way you look at me. I like it a lot. So yeah. Um.”
Dean usually notices when people are attracted to him. Sometimes he likes it, sometimes he ignores it. It’s never really a big deal. But there’s something about this moment—Dean’s embarrassment at being seen talking to himself, the stress of trying to communicate with Cas without speaking to him, the relief that the cashier is actually turning out to appreciate his weird freakin’ behavior… He doesn’t know what it is, but Dean is flustered in a way he rarely gets.
It’s cool, Dean’s not suffering for it. He’s thriving, really, watching Cas process this turn of events that will bring them into physical contact. He understands now what Cas had meant about different moments. He can’t wait for Cas to take his hand, but he also really loves waiting. It’s a squirmy, happy paradox deep in the center of him, warming him up from the inside.
From the corner of his eye, Dean can see Cas turning to look at him. Dean doesn’t look back because he needs to keep talking and it’s easier this way.
By the time he’s forced his dwelling on the past into the back of his mind, Cas is talking about flocks of feral parrots that live in highly populated urban areas like where the diner had been. Cas stuff.
“Please. I mean, yes. Yes please,” Dean babbles, because Cas started pulling their faces closer together on the first “please”.
The second time was in the car, pulled over on a secluded road. They’d been talking about Cas’ life as an angel before they’d met, and then about how many languages Cas could speak. (It’s all of them, by the way.) Dean had been doing fine until Cas started
“You used to think it was creepy, the way I looked at you,” Cas says. Dean can’t place his tone of voice, but he’s definitely not angry.
gonna be fine. I mean, I knew that, but hearing Sam say it, unprompted? That he knows we’re going to work it out and it’s just a matter of time? It helped. So I’m saying it to you now. We are
Beautiful, glorious Cas week. Talking to Cas all day, every day. For an entire week. He keeps wondering when he’ll get tired of it. Or at least for it to become normal. But it’s not normal, because Cas isn’t with him and nothing about that is right or normal. Cas
This isn’t gonna give Dean the squirmy happy feeling, so he decides to try something else. It’s a bit of a leap of faith, but at least it’s familiar territory for him.
Cas looks up at Dean, and Dean can tell he’s trying his best to keep his expression neutral. It almost works, if not for the way he chews on his bottom lip before answering.
“I could never let you die if I had a chance of saving you. Ever. And if you feel the same, I know you understand,” Cas says firmly.
It’s always like this. With everyone Dean’s ever cared about, but especially Cas. It’s always Cas going away; always Dean left wondering where and how and why. And for how long.
There. That was… pretty much the idea. It covers enough of the idea, anyway. Even though he said “awesome” three times.
Him and Cas. Going to his room. Together. On purpose? By themselves. Because… they love each other? So they want to… spend time… together. In a bedroom. Yeah. Yep. Sure.
I never would have known it happened. Even now, looking back at our conversations, I have no idea when the other three times could have been.”
“Okay, Dean. What about when it’s time to go to sleep? Would it be easier if I don’t join you?” Cas asks. He’s being completely sincere, just trying to sort this out and respect Dean’s wishes. And Dean is gonna fucking cry because Cas is so good to him already, and their relationship has barely just officially started.
Dean toes off his slippers and climbs onto the bed, sitting beside Cas and mirroring his position. He realizes immediately that he’s miscalculated, because now they’re both facing forward and he’d have to turn his head to look at Cas. Whatever, at least he made it here.
: seeing Cas with his own eyes. Holding his gaze as he talks about feelings. It’s nothing he’s done before—well, okay, he has a bit, but it’s nothing he’s ever done so deliberately, and with an honest desire to communicate as much as he can.
Dean looks up from his book and stares ahead, frowning. Why does Cas keep bringing this up? They’ve gone over this already. Multiple times!
“That we might be the only two people in a hundred miles who like Spam?” Amal says, scanning Dean’s last item. They tell Dean his total and start bagging while Dean tries not to look incompetent with the card reader. “At least I’m in good company.”
He’s definitely, absolutely, without a doubt about to break that record right now, right here on the kitchen floor.
“I’m, um, it’s just something about being able to talk to you now, I guess. This research doesn’t feel as much like… torture, as it did before, you know? I’m more hopeful about it now. Don’t see why I should avoid it anymore, if it’s not, you know, actively harming me.”
“That makes them less than ideal for a relationship, but what about just a night? You said they were cute.”
“Like—you know, like they want me,” Dean says. He’s not being very eloquent at the moment, but he thinks Cas will understand why he’s distracted. “And then there are the ones who just think I’m pretty or whatever. They just want to stare.”
Cas looks keenly interested, now. Dean doesn’t want to tell him; he doesn’t want to, but if Cas asks—
“It’s not, really. Plus it’s real easy to make. You just put it all together and heat it up, pretty much.”
“So we’d be wet,” Cas says, and the bastard sounds like he thinks that’s a perfectly normal and not-sexually-charged thing to say.
Cas is looking at him like all of his dreams are coming true at once. With pink cheeks and eyes shining, he looks like everything he’s ever wanted is right here in front of him, even though it’s just Dean’s mouth on Cas’s hand. Dean gets it. This is so much more than he’d ever imagined he could have. And to know that there’s more waiting for them? More ways they can love each other, over and over again, forever? It’s overwhelming. It’s the happiest Dean has ever been.
“That witch just made it so I could hear you, huh?” Dean realizes aloud. “You were listening all along and then suddenly I could hear you talk back. That must have scared the shit out of you, huh? How many times did you hear me—”
He gets to this point every single time he prays to Cas. It happens especially fast during the off-weeks, which alternate with the Cas weeks. It’s easier during Cas weeks—he feels more connected to Cas because he’s so focused on looking for a way to save him. He’s more in tune with that part of himself that belongs to Cas. During off-weeks, which Dean only agreed to when Sam threatened to leave if he didn’t take some time to “live his life” in between obsessing over Cas, he feels adrift. He feels guilty that he’s not researching, and he doesn’t get much satisfaction from doing anything else. He waits for Cas week, and he prays to Cas. And Cas can’t hear him. Because he’s still stuck in the Empty while Dean dicks around not saving him.
“I really liked talking to you, you know. When I was doing stuff around the house, or out and about. It was like you were always with me, even though you weren’t. But maybe you were more with me than I thought. Were you actually there next to me? I think—I think I could be okay with that. Eventually.”
“Tell me we’re on the same page here, man. That this is what you meant when you said you couldn’t have what you wanted,” Dean says once the silence drags on too long.
Dean is not making this joke to deflect the conversation. Really. It’s called stalling, which is different.
“I get that now,” Dean says once he’s able to school his expression into something slightly less exuberant. “Don’t get so grouchy about it, I’m trying to have a moment with you, here.”
“Are you sure? I really don’t want to make you uncomfortable,” Cas says, but Dean shakes his head. Cas has it all wrong.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about, man,” Dean says, but he’s not irritated. Cas is just wrong. “What I do
“I assumed it was part of your personality! To feel so deeply for others and to love so strongly… I feel the intensity of the longing, but it’s not more detailed than that unless you actually pray. I wasn’t an expert in human relationships, especially not at first; and I mean I’m still not, but I just - I thought you longed for emotional intimacy. Closer bonds with your family.”
Dean cannot believe how difficult it is to keep his mouth shut right now. This has never, in his entire life, ever happened to him. When he’s angry, sure. Anger has always loosened his tongue just fine. But all this? All of these feelings clambering to be expressed, pressing up through his throat, filling him with joyful anticipation instead of anger or fear? Never happened before. But now...
“I can’t stand you sometimes, Cas. I hate these stupid choices you make; you’re always finding a way to get the hell out of my life and I’m sick of it. Fuck you.”
Things keep happening that are the most intense of his life; is that going to be a regular thing, like the crying? What is he signing up for, here? (He’s still signing, obviously, but he’d just like to be informed.)
“Yeah, I figured you’d track me down first thing. And then you didn’t. But I didn’t either, so. Now I’m here.” Dean is losing his train of thought; he can feel Cas watching him so intently it’s almost a physical sensation.
Dean laughs. He laughs more than he probably should. But goddamn, that’s Cas. The measured tone. The hesitance overcome by curiosity. It’s Cas. Jesus Christ, it’s Cas.
“It's okay, Dean. I’m not in a hurry. I almost want this moment to last forever,” Cas says. He says it sincerely but casually, as though this information isn’t blowing Dean’s mind. And he doesn’t even stop there. “I look forward to different moments, but right now I’m enjoying this one. A lot.”
“It was, uh, a few weeks ago. I—I wanted to—I don’t know. We were talking about, uh, some books that you’d gotten at the flea market. You were in the library.”
He hasn’t laughed this much in a long time. Having Cas here, almost here— all around him even if it’s just his voice… Dean’s life has completely changed from just a few hours ago.
“I’m not goin’ anywhere. I’ll be right here, Cas. But that doesn’t mean I won’t spend every second wishing
“Thank you, Amal,” Dean says, with only the slightest pause to read the nametag and note their pronouns. “I will need those bags for the groceries I’m buying!”
Now that he can move again, Dean finds the non-organic carrots and turns to head toward the registers.
close to the chest. He’s trying to get Cas to come to him, or at least talk to him again. He’s not gonna say he’s throwing out bait, exactly… But he wants to give Cas some incentive, here.
Dean considers where to sit. It’d make most sense to sit on the edge of the bed near Cas’ feet, but he’s feeling brave. Instead he walks around to the other side of the bed.
“Good plan,” he agrees. “Now, I’m not gonna say I’m back to square one, exactly… But if you have any hints on where I should look next…”
“Cas is just being a baby. He thinks he can just confess his undying love for me and peace out, and then once I rescue his ass he can just avoid dealing with the whole thing,” Dean starts. Then he finds he doesn’t want to stop, despite Sam’s eyes going wide in shock. “Seriously, man, I don’t know how much longer I can take this. Like how long am I supposed to wait? We should have spent these whole three days in bed doing all kinds of freaky shit - but look at me, Sam! I’m sitting alone in the dark without even realizing it because the dude lives rent free in my freakin’ head!”
He is suddenly aware of the inevitability of jerking off to the sound of Cas’ voice before he can get up off the floor.
No reason to think otherwise. Dean feels those words like a sword to the sternum. No reason. All these years, he could have given Cas a multitude of reasons. But he never did. All those things he’d wanted to do, that he’d buried because it seemed impossible that anything good would come of it. All those times he half-convinced himself to crawl out onto the bough of expressing his feelings, only to pull himself back at the slightest wobble. All those times he was a coward.
“I can feel your longing for me. Have I never told you about that? I can sense anyone’s longing for me like I can hear their prayers. Yours especially. It’s strongest when I’m away from you, but it’s always there,” Cas says, warmth and pride in his voice.
Dean can tell he means it. He’s actually not sure he’s ever seen Sam so sincerely pleased. But Dean frowns at that last sentence.
“Yeah, yeah, shove it,” Dean says, forcing a frown to match his harsh words and suppress the smile in his voice. Doesn’t really work. “What’s your problem today, anyway?”
Dean can tell it’s not fine, and that he hasn’t heard the end of it. He rolls his eyes again, but he’s smiling. Cas’ worrying is annoying, yeah, but it’s nice that he cares so much.
The worst part is that Dean can’t even tell if Cas is putting it on or not. It’s just impossible when he can only hear his voice. When they’re face-to-face, it’s a little easier to spot Cas’ whole ‘oh I’m so naive and I don’t know shit about humans’ routine, which always appears when it’s most convenient.
“And I never thought I could have it, either,” Dean continues, and it feels like the words are being pulled out of him before he can consider them. “I didn’t even think you could have feelings like that.”
He’s imagined it going so many different ways, he thinks he might have literally exhausted every possibility.
“Is that what this is about, Cas?” Dean asks, letting his tone give away his smile. “Well rest assured, I wasn’t interested.”
Dean’s voice is doing that thing where it makes sounds without asking Dean’s brain first. He shuts his mouth. It’s the only control his brain can manage at the moment.
He then spends the second half of the drive smiling dopily at the thought of calling Cas his boyfriend.
“Dude, this isn’t even about being comfortable,” Dean says. He grabs Cas’ head with both hands, massaging his scalp before gently grasping handfuls of Cas’ hair on the back of his head. He pulls on them a bit, and Cas makes a small sound that’s too close to a moan. Dean smiles. “I
These words hit Dean hard while he’s loading the washing machine. He drops in a pair of sweatpants before realizing they’re inside out, so he reaches in, picks it up, turns it right side out, and puts it back. Dean goes through these motions but feels like he’s not controlling his arms; his brain is buzzing pleasantly.
There’s something about the way he says the word ‘pretty’ that makes Dean wish he could lie on the floor harder, somehow. Maybe it
that,” Dean says. “It’s not about that. I think I’d just be uncomfortable knowing that people are looking at me that way.”
“Obviously, uh, not straight?” Dean says. He’s never said the word ‘queer’ out loud, and it’s just as difficult to get past his lips as he’d always thought.
Yeah, right. He barely got through whatever the hell happened in Cas’s room and he’s been as good as silent ever since.
“What I want for Jack is safety and happiness. I think he—I’m sure he’s in a good place now. I’m just sorry that you miss him.”
“Was the cashier pretty?” Cas asks, and Dean trips over the corner of the cart as he tries to walk around it. So much for normal.
After the furniture delivery arrives and everything is set up where it’s gonna go, Dean realizes that he’s missing some things, so he has to go back into town.
That’s exactly what they’d been doing, isn’t it? Dean could never tell Cas he loved him because he didn’t think Cas loved him back, and Cas could never tell Dean he loved him because he didn’t think Dean loved him back, and with both of them hiding, neither of them had a reason to ever stop hiding… They might have continued on that way forever, if it wasn’t for the deal. It’s the only way that Dean could imagine this happening, to be honest. It might never have happened at all, if Cas hadn’t been able to use the expression of his feelings to save Dean and the world, safe in the knowledge that he’d never have to face Dean’s reaction.
“What?” Dean says, his eyes snapping open. His fingers rise to run through his hair before he rubs the heels of his palms against his eyes. How is this conversation just getting worse? And better? And everything Dean has ever dreaded and dreamed?
Cas darts his eyes up to Dean’s face just for a moment before he removes a hand from his beer bottle and reaches out to rest his palm down over Dean’s outstretched fingers, his own fingertips brushing the inside of Dean’s wrist. Cas’s hand is wet from the condensation on the bottle.
Cas looks—damn. He looks good. Dean has lost all ability to be objective when it comes to Castiel, that much is clear. And Dean doesn’t even feel very differently than he used to. More confident and more decided now, sure, but his feelings for Cas have been this strong for a long time. He’d known all along he was in love, but somehow he’d missed just how stupid it made him. He is so, so stupid about Cas it’s not even funny. He’d do anything for this dork.
“They’re uh, swim trunks. Like, not long like board shorts, but you know, shorter,” Dean says, cringing harder at himself with every word.
He reaches deep and broad inside himself to push forward all the ways he feels about Cas. He lets those feelings bask for a moment, illuminated in hope and longing. He’s ready to say everything, even if it’s hard. It’s what Cas deserves to hear. And maybe Dean deserves to be heard, too.
The use of past tense there is worrisome, if only because Dean’s noticed Cas talk like that a few too many times already.
“Hello, Dean,” Cas says, with more confidence this time. And maybe some relief, as if he hadn’t been sure that Dean would hear him.
“I’ve never wanted someone like I want you. Not even close. When you’re not around, I need you back. When you’re right in front of me, I want you closer. It’s like - It’s like I want you inside me - metaphorically, literally, whole nine yards,” Dean says.
He’s supposedly still in the bunker. According to Sam, he doesn’t seem to have left the building at all since he arrived.
“But you kinda did know, though, didn’t you?” Dean asks. It’s weird that this pleases him, but he figures they’re beyond that, now.
“Yeah. Yeah. I want that too, Cas,” he says instead. He hopes his voice conveys how deeply he wants that.
He’d wanted Cas back more than anything he’s ever wanted in his life. He’d never felt joy the way he felt when he saw Cas out of the Empty, back in the bunker where he belonged. Dean knew he needed to be with Cas, that Cas was it for him.
Unless Cas brings it up first, in which case all bets are off. Dean is caught between hoping he will and hoping he won’t.
Cas is watching Dean with what looks like a ton of familiar Cas expressions all mixed into one. He’s nervous, but he’s happy.
“No, obviously not, or I would have - ” Cas says, off-balance for the first time since they entered the kitchen. “We would have already had this conversation.”
“I can’t believe you. I don’t believe this! Actually, no, you know what? I do! I mean, of course! Why would I ever think—I don’t know why I—I…” Dean doesn’t want to go there, though, so he shuts up.
It used to be that Dean would have a thought like “wow Cas is so cute”, and wave it away, embarrassed for himself even in his own mind. Even last week, he might have done that. But now? Now Dean feels turned inside out. It doesn’t feel like he’s exposed, though. He feels… cozy.
Dean isn’t absorbing anything Cas is saying, because he’s trying to figure out how to tell Cas to stop talking. Or rather, that Dean needs to stop talking.
“Well, I do! And I don’t care what people think,” Amal replies with a bit of a dramatic flair. “So this isn’t for you?”
But he’d also kind of assumed that Cas would take the lead, here. Cas, who was so straightforward and free of human insecurities, would be the one to bring it up - if only just to assure Dean that nothing had to change. Then Dean would have the perfect opening to tell him he felt the same. If words failed him in that moment, Dean was also prepared to let his body do some of the talking.
bullshit, for sure. How could it not be Dean’s fault? Dean is the reason Cas sacrificed himself. It’s not just that Cas died to save Dean’s life, but what made it possible in the first place. Cas would never have had that opportunity to save Dean if he hadn’t… had those feelings. For Dean. Whatever they are.
Now, though? He could probably tell Cas everything he’s ever thought or felt and he would still feel deprived of connection. There is no longer any such thing as “too close to Cas”. There’s only shades of “too far”, with the ever-elusive “close enough” just out of sight.
“I have never experienced anything like this. Ever. Especially not with a dude,” Dean says. He feels out of his element, too. That’s why Cas was supposed to take charge! (Dean knows that doesn’t make sense, and he doesn’t care).
It’s a quick save, but Dean still catches it. How could he not? It’s screaming at him. Something inside him screams back—in frustration, in fear, in recognition.
time. He’d always figured prayer was about intent, so there must have been part of him that wanted Cas to ‘stay on the line’.
It’s the only explanation. Why else would it be impossible to find his best friend even though they’re under the same roof 24/7? Not that Dean has really gone looking for him, but still. They haven’t crossed paths once since Cas got back three days ago. This wouldn’t be so weird on its own (yes it would), except Sam sees Cas all the time. So what gives?
“It’s just... You have to understand, I didn’t expect to ever see you again. Everything I said, what I told you—I didn’t think—”
Dean would be suspicious of how good Cas is at making Dean’s brain go offline, but it’s probably just an easy thing to do. It’s Cas, after all. Dean has never been normal about Cas.
Dean has been having fun with the banter, and he thinks Cas has too. But all of a sudden he’s done teasing, because he’s remembering when he didn’t have this. And not only does he have Cas to talk to again… Cas is sitting in front of him. He’s sitting right there, in Dean’s room. Dean could touch him.
“I just wanted to be sure,” Cas says, clearly amused. “But I think your premise is flawed, Dean. Being on the couch instead of the bed wouldn’t stop us from having sex.”
Dean keeps watching their hands, waiting, but Cas lets go. Cas’ hands rise instead to hold Dean’s face between them, thumbs swiping over his cheek and near his lip like he’s some precious, beloved thing. When he sees Cas’ face, he understands he was waiting for the wrong kind of kiss.
“Not nearly as well as I’d like,” Cas dismisses before quickly moving back to the topic that’s been turning Dean inside out. “I do know you’re uncomfortable with your physical beauty.”
He’s never laughing at Dean - he’s always laughing with him. It’s amazing that Cas even wants to do that. Castiel, the angel, wants to laugh with Dean, tease him, make him feel good and put him at ease. Cas loves him. It’ll always come back to that, now.
Dean has to stop to take a breath. It’s shakier than he would like, but he manages to swallow the worst of it.
“But Dean, you’re not fighting anyone; there’s no looming threat. You could do anything you want, now. You don’t need me for that. And you don’t owe me anything.”
“Happy to help,” Amal says, and the smile on their face betrays that they are, in fact, judging him—but the verdict so far is very favorable.
“Uh, probably. Sure. Except, you know—you know, it’s for everyone to see. Unlike underwear, which is, you know, not,” Dean says, and he is doing great and not floundering at all. “I mean, nobody sees your underwear. Unless you—” Does Dean want to go there? No, he does not. “I mean, a swimsuit is for swimming, you know. In public. Where people can see you. And those are kinda, you know. Tight.”
He shuts the door behind him, and it closes with a click that sounds much louder than usual. Cas glances quickly at the door and then back at Dean. Then back at the door. Then back at Dean. Then he seems to collect himself and gives Dean a slight smile.
Dean laces his fingers over his forehead and squeezes his eyes closed. He’s trying to grimace but his face wants to grin.
“I’m uh, making some changes in the bunker. Nothing big but I think it’ll be nice,” he manages to say, having to change track every other word or he’ll end up saying way too much. “So there’s really no rush, you know… You do what you gotta do, man. I’m here—I’m around, whenever you’re ready.”
“One time,” Cas doesn’t hesitate to answer. “Just the once, and I know you have no reason to believe me—”
Okay, so he guesses it makes sense that he could sound different when he’s driving. It’s something he really enjoys doing, and it puts him in a better mood pretty much no matter what his baseline mood was.
To his complete horror, Dean starts to actually cry. Not full-on bursting into sobs, but Cas is suddenly a blur through the tears that well up in his eyes. He tilts his head back and tries to blink them away for a second, but a couple fall onto his cheeks anyway.
need to be lower. Would it help to go further underground? Or maybe he could just get up and start running, and he’d leave this feeling behind? Because otherwise, he might—
“No - I just - I wanted to make sure I wasn’t crossing a line,” Dean says. “I know it’s about more than that. You want -”
The only way out of this is to start being sincere about something else, so Dean just starts talking:
“I’m doing great, thanks for asking,” Amal replies. The words are from the standard customer service script, but the delivery is much friendlier than the standard Dean is accustomed to. They’re biting their lip to fight back a smile, which means the smile they want to make is friendlier than the standard, too.
“I didn’t notice how bad it was,” Dean says. “But now I’ve got you back. Well, you know what I mean. Enough to make me realize how I’ve been living. So yeah. You got me cleaning my room.”
tell him I said that; it was bad enough letting him say all that crap to me in the first place. But yeah. He pointed out some things I hadn’t thought of because I’m too close to it. Like the fact that I don’t even know if you
It’s the biggest understatement of all time and Dean knows it sounds that way too. The idea of Cas realizing how much Dean has fantasized about the two of them reuniting sets Dean’s face on fire. His heartbeat pounds against the inside of his chest, so hard he’s surprised he can’t hear it.
good for him, actually! Now Dean can’t even think about his breathing because he’s too busy feeling his pulse pounding through him. He’s trying not to vividly imagine Cas in shorts that tight, and he’s failing miserably.
Forget a rollercoaster; Dean is strapped to some kind of interdimensional rocket. He is officially no longer on this plane of existence.
“Yeah, man. You should do that,” Sam agrees. There isn’t an ounce of admonishment in his voice. He’s just supporting Dean, and for once, Dean is grateful.
Dean doesn’t know he’s going to pray to Cas until he’s halfway through folding his laundry. He picks up a pair of novelty socks and just holds them for several minutes. He remembers the last time he washed these. It had been during a conversation with Cas.
“Not everyone! Just your - just your loved ones. Your closest kin,” Cas says weakly. “I’m only just now realizing how gravely I misinterpreted things.”
“I’m pretty simple when it comes to stew, especially this one. Just beef, potatoes, carrots, onion, celery, beef broth, a bit of tomato paste, worcestershire sauce, salt, pepper… Garlic, rosemary, bay leaf.”
Doesn’t matter. He can’t think of a single thing to say, and it’s starting to really piss him off. He’d joked before about sweeping Cas off his feet, but goddammit, part of him had really wanted to try! He still really, really wants to try.
“Right,” Dean says. “But you felt all that - that longing, or whatever. Years of it. All the times I - all the times you weren’t around. And all the times you were around but I - I wanted more. And you figured what? That I just felt that way about everyone?”
Cas is back. He’s back and he’s upset that he made Dean cry. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever been happier in his life.
“Okay…? And that’s fine? There’s no downside to just leaving everything as it is? There’s no catch?”
“You’re right, I do want that. I never want anyone to actually know it, but yeah, I do,” Dean admits. “But Cas, buddy… You gotta understand, I’ve never wanted anyone the way I want you.”
“I’m not going anywhere, Dean. And I know why you couldn’t say anything. It was the same for me. I couldn’t imagine risking our friendship,” Cas says. “And… You know, I’m not even sure how we could have done differently. If both of us were hiding our feelings because we didn’t think the other would ever return those feelings… We were fulfilling each other’s prophecies.”
“Huge understatement, actually. I don’t even - I - I can’t - “ Dean takes a breath and starts over. Decides to start simple. “I don’t want to live without you.”
He’s done with his food in a couple more bites, and stands to put away the plate, stretching his back a bit as he goes.
“Wait. Is that why - is this why you said all that shit about me being the most loving human? Because you thought I went around feeling an insane amount of love for every person in my life?!”
That’s fair; Cas deserves an explanation. And if he wants to stick to the good stuff without any tangents, that’s just fine. Might want to be careful what he wishes for, because Dean’s already addicted to the butterflies-on-steroids feeling he gets from Cas’s reactions. And he’s getting good at figuring out how to get Cas to react.
“But you heard my prayers, man. That’s what really gets me, you know? How could you listen to me like that and—and not do anything?”
“I know, Cas. I get that now,” he says. “Seems like we’ve both been dumbasses. I still can’t believe you thought that I feel the same way about everyone that I do about you.”
“Hey dickhead, can you just come down so we can talk about this? Why do I still have to pray to you like this? Cas? Seriously, man? Come on! What is your problem?! CASTIEL!”
“No one is quite sure where they came from, but it’s probably just a few exotic pets who multiplied. There are probably around 3,000 of them in the wild now. Such as it is.”
“Is Amal at the register?” Cas asks with the carefully nonchalant tone of someone hopelessly trying to sound chill.
For the first time, Dean is almost glad they’re not speaking in person so Cas can’t see how red his face is getting. Cas saying nice things about him… It always gets him. And now, after that speech before he died? Dean is just wired differently than before. Cas’ praise used to feel like a gentle hug, but now it feels… It feels like being wrapped head-to-toe in affection and squeezed until tears start to form in his eyes. And that’s not even just a metaphor. He really could cry right now, if he let himself.
“Yeah, I think we’d be—” Dean’s voice cracks; he has to clear his throat. “I think we’d be wearin’ swimsuits. We’d have just come out of the water and everything.”
“I didn’t say you had to bring anything up. I just mean have you tried to talk to him at ALL? You say you haven’t seen him, but have you looked for him?”
It’s Cas week, and Dean is on cloud nine. He’s wearing fuzzy socks and Cas is in his ear and they’re talking about travelling.
“Maybe I’ll tell him about you—about how we were talking. We talked so much and I never breathed a word of it to Sam. Kind of a dick move, actually. You’re his friend too. I just—I don’t know; I wanted you to myself, I guess. Because either Sam would be able to talk to you too, or he’d have to use me to pass messages along. Either way, I didn’t want—I mean it was important to me, what we were doing. It was special, I guess. Just for me.”
“Hi,” Dean says, and he can’t control the smile that takes over his face, so he doesn’t try. It’s more than worth it to see the smile Cas gives in return.
Dean regrets asking when the smile drops from Cas’ face like it walked off a cliff. Maybe it’s a bad idea to bring this up so soon.
Dean doesn’t realize that this is how he feels until he says it, but once he does, it’s like he’s always known this is how he wanted it to go.
He is such a loser. Seriously. He finally has what he wants, what he’d sworn he’d never take for granted if he could just have another shot. He would have done anything to get to this moment. He risked his life for it. And here he is: drinking beer like he always does, saying nothing like he always does.
“Why are you sitting so far away?” he says, deciding not to be apologetic about it. Cas is just gonna have to go with the flow.
“I said I think you’d also look good in tighter clothes. I think you’d look good in any clothes,” Cas says. It’s so simple, so matter-of-fact, but it also sounds vaguely unfinished.
Dean goes insane over that, he truly does, but it’s also too funny not to laugh. Cas’ words are sexy as hell, but he looks and sounds adorably grumpy. It’s ridiculously attractive and also just ridiculous.
Nothing is better than watching Cas watch Dean hold his hand. Nothing even compares. It’s so stupid, and it’s juvenile, and it’s gorgeous. Cas is gorgeous. His lips are moving slightly, like they’re mouthing around a thought, trying to make out the shape of it. He opens his mouth to speak but changes his mind. He smiles at Dean’s hands. He opens his mouth to speak again, looking up at Dean’s face this time. Their gazes connecting is so satisfying, like a crisp new puzzle piece snapping into place. Cas closes his mouth again, swallowing whatever he’d been about to say with a nervous bob of his throat.
“I understand,” Cas says, with an air of being perfectly aware that he’s putting Dean out of his misery. And he doesn’t relish it, he’s just happy to help.
Cas’ hands are bigger than Dean’s but even if they weren’t, he’s an angel. He’s stronger than Dean can really fathom. His hands
“Yes,” Cas says, as if the answer was immediately clear. As if he’d started imagining as soon as Dean said the words.
Dean can do that. Once they actually get to his room it’ll be a different story, but he’s starting to think that’s okay. It’s okay that sometimes he’s a flustered mess, but other times he’s the one who has it together. He’s got a feeling that’s just how he and Cas will operate: taking turns making the other feel undone.
“Doesn’t matter. Keep it light, I guess,” Dean says. His eyelids already feel weighed shut, and he moves his legs around a bit underneath his blankets in cozy satisfaction.
“It took a while for you to accept my invitation,” Dean says good-naturedly. “Even after I begged, like literally actually begged you, I don’t even know how many times—”
“Aww, come on, Cas. Don’t be like that,” Dean says. “I promise I won’t come get you unless I know I can get out, okay?”
Cas’s attention is laser-focused on the joining of their hands. He has a cute little deer-in-the-headlights look about him, like he can’t believe this is happening. Dean’s heart is positively singing with the joy it brings him to know that this is only the beginning. That if he can affect Cas like this, just with this? What else could he do?
“Nothing’s going on. I just don’t want you to waste your time on something that’ll never—that might not ever happen.”
bed, and he already fell asleep for a second, and he doesn’t feel like sleep is interrupting his conversation with Cas—it feels like part of it, a natural progression. Dean feels really, really good. He wants to carry that feeling with him into his sleep.
Dean is running out of words to convey just how imperative it has always been for Dean to have Castiel with him. In whatever capacity. If Cas takes just one thing away from this conversation, Dean needs it to be this. Fortunately, Cas looks like he understands, because his face is lit up once again with fondness.
“I’ve been wondering what happened to make this possible. Our conversations, I mean,” Cas says, sounding hesitant again. “I’m appreciative, and I’m hoping it’s benign… But it’s concerning to me, not knowing how this happened. It would have taken something very powerful to transform your prayers into two-way communication. Except...”
close to saying the words “what are you wearing”, in that order. On the phone, basically. Dean is—he has—he’s not—this is
“But we’re not talking anymore, so. I should probably tell him about all this. Maybe he can talk some sense into you. Or maybe I just miss talking to someone who’ll talk back. Guess you spoiled me.”
“No. But I knew you could be. I hoped you—” Cas stops like he’s catching himself from going too far.
“I’m afraid I don’t have any better explanation than cowardice. Then once we started talking, I knew it was only a matter of time. I was being so much more dishonest than before… Before, I was just hiding, and I could justify that to myself. But the way we were always talking… Every day that went by represented a million missed chances to tell you the truth. But I just kept digging the hole.”
“Do you wanna watch a movie? Maybe it’s not the location so much as what we’re doing. Of course we’re gonna be all over each other if we’re just sitting around staring into each other’s eyes.”
Dean hates himself a little, hearing that. That line of thinking won’t serve him right now, so he focuses on moving forward, promising to himself to do better by Cas from now on.
Cas is sitting across from Dean in the kitchen, both hands wrapped around a bottle of beer that he’s not drinking.
“Yeah, just—woke up and said hi,” Dean said, answering the question Cas didn’t finish asking. “And yeah, I guess I have been asleep for a while. I feel really rested.”
“Exactly. And when Jack came to get me, took me to Heaven… He offered right away, to take me to see you. But I was terrified, so I declined. Same thing the next time, and the next... And then the more time went by, the harder I knew it would be to explain myself to you. The longer I stayed away, the worse it got...”
“I have no idea, dude,” Dean says. He cranes his neck to check the other registers, but he doesn’t see Amal anywhere. “Doesn’t look like it.”
Cas’ reaction is so incredible it immediately changes Dean’s mind about this being a bad idea—he is a genius for bringing this up, actually. Cas tenses up with his entire body; Dean can practically feel it from across the room. He looks terrified and embarrassed, and Dean is
“What is up with you two, anyway?” Sam asks, and it’s obvious that he’s been waiting for the opportunity to do so. He flips the light switch and comes to sit in the other chair. He’s perched on the edge of it, leaning towards Dean as if to signify how very important he finds this conversation. How he’s not going to let Dean out of it.
It’s not exactly a rhetorical question, even though Dean doesn’t actually expect an answer. It’s like he’s putting a pin in the question for later. It’s something he wants to say out loud, to let Cas know he’s thinking of him. Wondering about him. It’ll give them something to talk about next time.
“You like to be in control of your image, of how people think of you. And you can’t control how pretty you are,” Cas says.
Cas finally looks back at Dean, and relaxes when he sees him. There’s a smile fighting its way onto his face to match Dean’s.
“Did I really give you this idea? I’m surprised you didn’t think of it yourself. You’re the human,” Cas says.
Dean scoots over so Cas can sit next to him without having to walk around the bed. He wants to pat the mattress and summon Cas like a pet, but he just barely refrains.
Dean realizes he's still standing in the middle of the aisle for no reason, so he picks up a random box of cereal and pretends to read the back. He trying
“Sam just got home, so I won’t be able to pray just whenever. Huh. Well. You think I should tell him about this?”
That was absolutely terrible and Dean feels like he’s forgotten how to speak English, but Cas is smiling again so he must have gotten it right anyway.
“I mean yeah, they’re cute enough. But I’m not, you know. I’m not really into the whole one-night-stand thing anymore. Or flings in general, really,” Dean says, striving for the most casual tone possible as he peruses the tabloid covers without really reading anything.
“Yeah, well. I guess. I’m still pissed off that you’re dead, though. I’ve been looking for a way to get you back, like, non-stop since you died.”
Goddamn, there’s that fluttery feeling again. It’s so beyond good. He wishes he’d known all along how it would feel to get reactions like this out of Cas. Dean is sure - suddenly and completely sure - that he’s gonna spend the rest of his life chasing this feeling. He doesn’t even care that he’ll have to talk, or that he’ll have to make himself vulnerable. The thrill of these flutters is more than worth the cost.
“Yeah? Are you picturing it?” Dean says. He’s grinning down at the spatula he’s scrubbing, and it’s definitely the kind of grin he’s glad to be alone for.
of opinions, let me tell you. At first, I was pissed because it seemed like he was takings ng your side, but I know it’s not about sides. He just—he gave me a lot of clarity. Helped me understand where you might be coming from. Oh, son of a—”
And it’s just so… Cas. Dean covers his face with both hands to hide his grin. It’s almost unbearable how much he loves this guy. He can’t believe he spent so long trying not to think about it. He can’t understand how he had even been able to avoid it. Cas is a burning star beside him, a celestial being of immense love and power. His pull feels inescapable.
“Honestly man, I’m still kinda confused about all this. If you could feel how much I needed you...” Dean doesn’t even know how to finish that question, or what he’s even asking.
Dean has never understood the phrase “hit like a ton of bricks” more than he does now. There’s a heavy pressure in his chest and on his back and his heart is caving in. His throat is dry. He’s going to throw up.
“Please,” Dean whispers back. He pushes forward with his jaw, just a little, and Cas lets him move just enough to get his point across, but no further. Like he’s playing the game with Dean. It’s exhilarating.
He’s speaking in stops and starts because he’s thinking too many things at once. He picks one and tries to focus on it.
“What‘s it to you? And who am I supposed to be sitting with, anyway? Not like Cas wants anything to do with me,” Dean grumbles. Laying it on just a little thick, since he knows better than Sam why Cas isn’t here.
“I mean, I was before I fell asleep, too, but you didn’t mind then,” Dean said, grinning as he sat up to switch on the bedside lamp. “There, light’s on. I’m up. Are we good?”
“I mean if they’re gonna be spending all this time thinking about my body, they should want to do something with it,” Dean says, and he’s honestly kidding. Somehow it doesn’t sound like he’s kidding, though.
leave Heaven. You could be stuck there for some reason. But you never took the chance to explain yourself, so I doubt it. I figure if you had such a good excuse you’d have just explained it to me. So I don’t think you’re stuck up there. Pretty sure you’re just hiding from me. And Sam had plenty to say about that, too. So it makes more sense now. You gotta have your reasons. But I don’t have to assume the worst, if I don’t want to. And you know something? I
“So you’re saying you know it’s not possible. Even though we all know that Jack got you out of the Empty before. And you even walked in and back out again. What’s the problem?”
“Dean, think about it. You have a lot more experience with this kind of thing than he does,” Sam reasons.
It seems to, because Cas is staring at him unabashedly now. It reminds Dean of when they first met, how Cas would lean in close and stare right through his eyes and into his soul.
How is he supposed to help it, though? Hearing Cas say the words ‘I’ll stick around’? An explicit promise—something Dean can hold him to. It’s not the sum of Dean’s dreams surrounding Cas, but it’s the foundation. It’s the only thing he truly
“Obviously it’d be better if you were here. And I’m working on it, man, I swear. I work on it all the time,” Dean knows he’s babbling but he can’t stop. “I haven’t found anything yet, but I know it’s possible. I’m gonna get you out of there.”
Dean closes his eyes and tucks his hands behind his head, trying to relax his body in the hopes that it’ll trick his mind into relaxing too. He takes a deep breath.
“I think we’re going to be fine now, don’t you?” Cas asks. He reaches out to grab Dean’s hand, holding it delicately as if he’s about to bend down and kiss the back of it.
Different moments. Dean is distantly aware of what those moments could be, but he’s nowhere near ready to face those possibilities head on - not when he’s sitting here in front of Cas with his face red and his tongue tied.
Dean does know. The answer is perfectly clear to him now, but he’s tripping over his thoughts to try to explain it to Cas.
“Yes, well... I realized very early on during our conversations that I’d made a horrible mistake in not coming to you from the beginning. Deep down, I’d known before then too. Jack was adamant that I was making the wrong choice. Everyone thought so, actually. Your mother, especially.”
He doesn’t usually go all out with the research during off-weeks. He really wants to honor Sam’s wishes (to an extent). But he just doesn’t feel like it’s necessary, now that he’s talking to Cas. It doesn’t feel unhealthy to focus on this research anymore. And that’s really what Sam cares about, after all, right? Dean’s well-being. If Sam knew that Dean was talking to Cas, he’d probably be fine with off-week research!
“You didn’t have to do anything to earn it,” Cas offers. “There isn’t anything you could do to continue earning it. It’s intrinsic.”
Dean can tell that there’s a lot more Cas wants to say. He knows the feeling. He has never wanted to talk to someone as much as he wants to talk to Cas. He has to make a conscious effort to keep it all in his head.
me, man. Why don’t you want to be here? What’s so wrong with being around me, huh? Why would you talk to me but not want to see me? I mean, you could have told me. You could have just said, ‘Dean, I—I—I never want to s—see you again’, but no. N—no, you had to just… do whatever that was. What the hell were you doing Cas? What the hell kind of game were you playing with me?”
This is what Sam has been telling him, and Dean is sure that Cas would feel the same. Helping people is always worth it. Dean thinks so too, he’s just… Restless. Lonely.
Dean stares at the guns lined up on the table in front of him. The one he’s currently working on is almost finished, but he suddenly has no idea what he should do next. He’s done this thousands of times. But there’s nothing, because all that’s in Dean’s head is that Cas wants to ask him something. So he just stares at the pieces, waiting to remember the next step, waiting for the question.
He needn’t have worried, though, because as soon as he’s in the library surrounded by the relevant books and sitting in front of his laptop ready to take notes, he knows that this will be different than before.
What was it? What is the thing that Cas wants more than anything else in the world? Something that’s somehow related to Cas telling Dean he loves him?
“You were going to suggest that you take the risk anyway, and if you’re stuck in the Empty then at least we’d be together. Is that right?” Cas says.
Dean has to take a couple minutes to recover after that one. Cas says nothing, as usual. Hopefully he’s still listening.
Cas can’t possibly be that stupid. Except of course he is. Dean’s not even mad—it’s actually funny. It’s endearing for Cas to have flaws. Although Dean’s not sure of the exact nature of this one. Is Cas just innocently clueless about what Dean is implying? Or does he have so little esteem for himself and his place in Dean’s life that the implication would never occur to him?
“Right, yeah, got it. Going,” Dean says, and he trips over himself trying to turn and leave the kitchen. He hears a slight chuckle from Cas, but it doesn’t feel mocking. It feels good.
Dean is eager to get to work, but he’s hoping he can keep it light. He doesn’t want to feel the way he used to during his research—it’s a despair he never wants to revisit.
“Don’t you think—I mean don’t you think it’d be… nice, to come down and talk to me? Now that I’ve—I mean, I’m sorry it took me so long to tell you, but I swear I just wanted to tell you in person. I was—it hasn’t been easy, keeping it from you. Not that I was
were here. Because I will. I have been. Right now, I can’t think of a single thing I want more. Please, Cas. Please.”
Nothing will ever be enough to relieve him of the absence of Cas. He lets go and shakes his hands before placing them gently on the bottom of the wheel. The lump in his throat keeps his head moving as he presses his forehead more firmly against the steering wheel. The gentle thrashing back and forth holds the tears at bay and relieves some of the pressure. He knows that from the outside, it looks like he’s really going through it.
can it be possible that this guy—who Dean feels as though he’s struggling to maintain hold of even just in friendship—how can this guy be
“Well, I’ve been thinking about it. And if it were some kind of modification to your own prayers, I would assume that you’d have to start the conversation. But—”
He moves—in a way that he hopes does not resemble scrambling—to sit up on the bed. Just casually hanging out. With an angel in his bedroom. Who he’s in love with. Who he just told he was in love with, along with a bunch of other stuff Dean normally never talks about.
Then Dean realizes that they have both been spending a lot of time during this conversation thinking about Dean’s body…
“We decided I’d only do research every other week. During Cas weeks. And then on the off-weeks I’m supposed to, you know, relax. Somehow. I mean, I usually end up crawling up the walls. Sometimes I watch a movie. I get drunk.”
“I don’t believe you! I know you, man! You’re not being normal about this. Why don’t you think it’ll happen?”
“I was messed up before. I spent all of my time looking for a way to get you out. And I mean all of it. I barely slept. I couldn’t eat. For weeks. Then Sam said he’d leave the bunker for good if I didn’t scale it back. So I did. But it was still all I could think about. What did I care about the state of my room?”
“You’re a son of a bitch, you know that, Cas? Screw you. I’ll yell at you again tomorrow. And every day after that. Asshole.”
“Yes! Exactly. I’m not—there isn’t just one thing I’d call you. It’ll depend. Except, uh, is there something I should avoid saying?”
Apparently that is exactly what Cas had figured, because he looks away from Dean for the first time since they sat down.
handles the men as smoothly as the women; it always catches him off-guard. But he’s never been hit on by a gender-noncomforming person, or even just a visibly queer person. Someone who’s obviously out and proud.
Cas probably doesn’t know, because Dean is being purposefully vague. There’s a lot he still doesn’t want to say until they’re face-to-face. It’s foolish to still be holding out, but he is. Part of him wants to give in, though. It’s pleading with the rest of him to please, please let him say what he has to say. As always, it’s a tough battle, but thankfully he’s already pulling into a parking space and turning off the car.
“So yeah. I’m looking forward to it. No pressure, just… You know, I thought you should know that I’m looking forward to it.”
To demonstrate his point, (and admittedly, for ulterior motives involving butterflies), Dean uses both hands to pull Cas’s hand closer as he leans over the table. His face meets Cas’s hand halfway, and he gently places his lips on the back of Cas’s knuckles. It’s not really a kiss; it’s just contact. A warm, gentle adoration of Cas, expressed through touch.
He’d known that Cas loved him; he’d said it before, back when he’d been about to die. But this time was different. This time, Cas said that the one thing he wanted—the only thing that would make him truly happy—was something that he knew he could never have.
“What?” Cas asks—more harshly than he meant it, judging by his contrite expression immediately after.
He’s successful in blinking back the tears this time, and his face stays mercifully dry. He sits up in his bed, legs crossed, facing Cas from an upright position now. He wishes Cas weren’t all the way across the room.
“I’d really like that. Someday. We could be easy, Cas. I know you probably don’t think so, but I know we could. And I know we’re not even talking right now, but we’ll get there eventually. I’m working on it.”
“Okay. Um. I’m back at the bunker now. Gonna make some dinner; ask Sam if he wants any. I, uh. I miss you, buddy. I hope you’re doing okay up there. Okay. Bye, Cas. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”
“Have a good night,” Amal says, winking again before hoisting the register drawer more securely in their arms and turning to leave.
“I’ve prayed to you every single day for months and I’m not gonna stop now. So here you go: you’re a dick, Cas. I’ll talk to you tomorrow.”
Except now here they are. Together, having this remarkably open conversation, with nothing bad on the horizon to distract them from each other. For the foreseeable future. Forever, maybe.
Sam’s smile grows as he sits back in the chair, settling in. He watches Dean for a few moments, eyes twinkling like he’s about to say something really stupid. Why did Dean think that opening up about this would be a good idea?
“Listen, Cas. I know I was wrong, but I really did think that you couldn’t - that you didn’t feel things the way humans do,” Dean explains. “You know, things were so different for you when you were human. Then when you got your grace back you couldn’t even enjoy food anymore because it was just molecules or whatever. I just assumed - ”
handling the surface-level reading of this conversation. He cannot delve into trying to interpret anything beyond that or he’ll devolve into uselessness.
Dean opens his eyes and watches the ceiling. It takes him a while to continue, but eventually he does.
“Cas, can you please come down and talk to me? Please? I’m literally begging you, okay? Can we just—can you just talk to me?”
apologize for praying to me. Hearing you pray, knowing you’re thinking of me. It’s—I appreciate it. I’ll just say that.”
“Are you sure?” Cas murmurs once they’re about to collide, holding Dean in place, their lips almost touching.
“We should let you practice those phone sex skills again sometime,” Dean says, then leans over to whisper in Cas’ ear: “And this time I can play along.”
“I already looked for him, in the Empty! And I pulled him out. It was a whole thing! I think the ball’s in his court now.”
“So I talked to Sam,” Dean says conversationally as he drives into town. “He’s pretty much up to speed now. Though I will say, he was not happy with me for keeping this from him. Said it was really messed up since you guys are friends too. And he’s right. I told you that yesterday, so you know I know he’s right.”
Now there’s an idea. Huh. Dean has to stop for a second, actually, before he lets that idea blossom any further in the middle of the kitchen. He can’t think that far ahead or he’ll go crazy. They haven’t even kissed yet.
“Sorry, just—I just realized I have to fill you in on everything that happened after—after you...” Dean trails off. He doesn’t want to think about it, let alone talk about it.
Dean is probably crazy but the emphasis on ‘you’ happens in an even deeper voice than Cas usually uses. It sounds suggestive. Dean knows—he’s 95% sure—that Cas doesn’t mean it to sound that way.
“Yeah, well. I’m glad we’re both feeling better. And it can only go up from here, you know? Once we get you out… I mean can you imagine?” he says.
Dean loves this. This is exactly what he’s been waiting for. But because Dean is the way he is, he can’t move on from what they were talking about earlier. His mouth just opens and says words.
“Not that you have anything to be ashamed of, anyway,” Dean says before he realizes what he’s saying.
That familiar voice washes over Dean and he has to close his eyes for a second to keep them from misting up. He hadn’t truly realized how much better he’d feel with Cas there in front of him again. Alive. Perfect.
Dean’s head shoots up at this— dumbfounded for no good reason— and Amal actually literally winks at him. Dean loses grip on his credit card somehow and it falls underneath his cart, so he humiliatingly has to move the cart and do the whole bending-over-awkwardly-in-a-tight-space thing to retrieve it.
It turns out that not only had Cas never found any of the bottles he’d cast away, but they both would have been better off if Dean had just hand-delivered his letters.
This is crazy. Dean is ducking his head to hide his blushing face from a guy who isn’t even in the room. That’s where he’s at right now. It’s so far from where he was a few days ago it might as well be another planet.
“I’m glad to hear that,” Cas says. “Well, I’m glad that you’re feeling better now. I’m sorry that you went through that to begin with.”
Dean takes a minute before he goes on. He knew that as soon as he went to open his mouth, it’d suddenly be difficult to talk again. For all it had felt like he’d been bursting at the seams with his feelings before, it had just been a feeling. His reality is more complicated. He’ll get into it once he starts, but he has to start. He has to start, knowing that where he’s going is a place he can never come back from.
“Hey, Cas. I’m, uh, I’m folding those socks I was telling you about last time,” Dean prays. “You know, with the tacos?”
Oh, no. Oh no no no, no. Dean knows that tone. He has dreams about this voice, and they’re not pleasant. It’s the leaving voice.
His body wanted to spring out of bed, but he wasn’t done being under his blankets yet. He just opened his eyes, and smiled alone in the dark.
“Around 573 times,” Cas says, exasperated—gloriously, mercifully exasperated with Dean. Just the way he ought to be.
. As in, physically, tangibly with Dean, rather than always leaving. Most of Dean’s conscious fantasies have involved working cases with Cas, or watching movies with Cas, or going fishing with Cas, or having dinner with Cas. Just… being with Cas. That’s what Dean has always wanted, more than anything else.
me? Were you pulling that invisible creeper act and watching me all along? If I find out that you were actually down here, right next to me, I’m gonna lose it. I swear, Cas. I’m gonna lose my goddamn mind. I can’t
Dean almost has a heart attack hearing “if you feel the same”. It takes him a second to realize Cas is saying that Dean knows how it feels to be willing to do anything to save someone. Not… that other thing that Dean had first thought of.
This reminds him of what they used to do before he set up the Dean Cave. Sit next to each other on the bed, legs outstretched, a laptop set between them, watching all the movies Dean wanted to introduce to Cas. All those little parts of himself that he wanted Cas to know about.
“Stop, Dean. I feel better now, too. A lot better. I was—I missed you. And I hated it. But like you said, I have you now.”
“Yeah, no, I get that. I know. I just, um, think it’d be easier… For me. To not be in the bed. Right now.”
“Must be weird to have parrots in your backyard like any other normal bird,” Dean says, a bit absent-mindedly, as he joins the line at the third register.
Dean is euphoric. There’s no other word for it. He is intensely aware that this is the first time they’ve ever touched while officially in a romantic relationship. They haven’t talked about being a couple, but if Dean is certain about anything, he’s certain that’s what they are. No question that they’re together now. Together. Holding hands. It’s not even a kiss; it’s not the crack of sexual tension breaking. But it’s profound. It’s a sliding together of feelings. Dean’s love held open for Cas’s love to sink into.
Then Cas had spoken first, for the first time since they started talking. Dean hadn’t even realized it before now, but he
The first was kind of an accident. Dean has gotten used to having Cas around his head all day, every day. Talking to Cas is the last thing he does before he falls asleep and the first thing he does when he wakes up. Without fail, every single day. Even when he’s not alone in the bunker, Dean can always count on having Cas in his ear when he’s in his bed. And one morning Dean just… woke up with a boner and started taking care of it, like he usually would. And simultaneously, he said good morning to Cas, like he usually would. And they talked for several minutes that way. The two activities were not connected in Dean’s conscious mind until he realized why he was so close to coming so quickly.
comfortable. I’d do anything you want right now and I’d love it. It’d be amazing. But that’s exactly why I want to take my time, you know? I wanna savor it.”
He really does not want to spell it out; he’s said way too many words already. He wants what he has to say to be said, but he doesn’t want to say it. But the only way out is through.
Oh. Dean gets it. His understanding rushes through him, heating him up from head to toe. He’s probably never blushed like this in his life.
Because Dean is sure now: Cas is going to talk to him again. He’d been losing hope for a while there, but not anymore. It’s inevitable that they’ll talk again. Cas won’t ignore him forever.
Dean wakes up, having fallen asleep for a second. Just for a second, just long enough to miss his turn to speak.
“So, just FYI: if Sam shows up early I’ll have to hide all this stuff and make it look like I haven’t been working.
Amal switches off the sign above their register to indicate that their line is closed. That’s when Dean realizes that all the customers behind him have already moved to other lines.
“Shut the fuck up, Cas,” Dean interrupts, but there’s no heat to it. He clicks around on his laptop, absent-mindedly checking his email, giving himself something to do with his hands and gaze. “I don’t wanna hear any bullshit about what else in my life could be more important than this, because it’s bullshit. This isn’t up for debate.”
“Yeah but I haven’t seen you around, you know? And I get it,” Dean says, holding up a hand before Cas can argue. “I get it. I haven’t exactly been all up your face, either. But you know I’ve actually been waiting for you?”
“Uh,” Dean says, trying to figure out what he can say that would work for both the person in front of him
Cas is leaning forward in his chair, his brow furrowed in concern. So cute. So absurdly, unfairly cute.
Okay so they’re almost on the same page. Getting there. Dean can close the gap. He takes a deep breath before he goes for it.
The response is instantaneous and extreme: Cas jumps off the bed faster than is humanly possible and starts pacing around the other side of the room. Dean watches this for a few moments as he basks in the glow of such an intense reaction. He wonders when he should interrupt, but then Cas sits back down as quickly as he’d gotten up. Dean waits as he settles in.
“What can I do to convince you to talk to me, man? What do I have to do? I’ll do anything at this point. Anything you want, and I mean it. You don’t even know—can’t even imagine how much I mean it. And you won’t know until you agree to talk to me. So just… Just come talk to me. That’s all I ask. Please.”
It’s actually nice because he has to drive over an hour to find what he needs, so he’ll have plenty of time to talk to Cas. If he wants. Not that he can’t talk to Cas with Sam home, now that Sam knows everything… But Dean is still hesitant to say much when Sam could possibly hear him. Dean doesn’t know how to not be vulnerable while talking to Cas nowadays. He’s lost the ability to bring up the wall that keeps his feelings just far enough away that they don’t seep into his words. He’s too obvious now. Sure, Sam knows a lot. But it’s still personal. It’s still just between Dean and Cas.
“Is it that you don’t want to talk? What if—what if you just show up and we don’t talk? You can just sit here with me. So I can—I can just see you? I’ll take that, if you don’t wanna talk. I just wanna look at you again. I—I can’t—”
“Right. Well, I left as soon as I realized what was happening. And I never tried spying on you again.”
. Just a short, surprised chuckle, but it turns Dean’s heart over in his chest and he can’t get the smile off his face. Mayday! He cannot be doing this!
“I’m your priority,” Cas repeats back, and there's a sense of absence in his voice, like he’s distracted.
So he feels like he should have talked to Cas sooner, even though Sam has only been gone for like fifteen minutes. He’d been too inside his head, but then—
Forty minutes later, Dean returns to the car empty-handed. His purchases will be delivered to the bunker tomorrow.
“I have to admit, I never imagined we’d be having this conversation,” Cas says, breaking several minutes of silence.
But Sam just left for the afternoon. This is pretty safe. For a moment, Dean feels bad that he hadn’t thought to talk to Cas as soon as Sam had left. They talked this morning when Dean woke up, but that was hours ago. When Sam’s not around, Dean spends almost every waking moment talking to Cas. It’s unreal and it’s insane but it’s true. But it’s an off-week, so Sam makes a point of hanging around Dean as much as possible.
It’s only when Dean is alone that he allows himself to dwell on Cas. He’s not sure if it’s healthy, but he likes to pretend that Cas can hear his prayers. Sure, it’d probably be better if he worked out his feelings with a person who can actually hear and respond to him, like Sam. Or a therapist. But this is what Dean allows himself, and sometimes he thinks it helps.
“Thanks,” Dean says, uselessly. He’s shocked by this admission from Cas, but he’s not surprised. It’s upsetting, but he’s not upset. He’s fighting to keep a smile off his face. “I don’t get it, dude. You knew that I was… I mean, that didn’t clue you in on anything?”
“In hindsight it feels like I should have realized. But I can’t sense how strongly you feel about other people. I can only use your actions to compare,” Cas asks. He breaks their eye contact to look back down at their joined hands, stroking his thumb back and forth over the first knuckle of Dean’s index finger. “And you’re always so - you get so angry. With me in particular, I mean. Compared to everyone else.”
“No. No, I’m not going to—to beg you to talk to me,” he says. It’s a little better. “I’m good. You just let me know when you’re done with your hissy fit.”
“Okay then,” he finally says. The tear tracks on his cheeks are dry and itchy, so he gets up to wash his face. “Okay, Cas. Right. I’ll just. Talk to you tomorrow, I guess.”
He pauses again to gather his thoughts. The next part is important because he wants to get it right.
Dean strains to listen even though the voice had been coming from all directions and would be impossible to miss in the silent room.
“Okay, hey, it’s okay. You don’t have to,” Dean interrupts. He settles back against the headboard and stretches his legs a bit. Then he approaches the edge of the cliff. “It’s okay. I just like looking at you. Bonus if you’re looking back at me.”
Cas snaps his gaze back to Dean, eyes wide. They’re bluer than they have any right to be in a windowless room.
It feels like something should happen, now that Dean has said his full name. Something should change now.
“But I mean, you’re not wrong that it’s weird to see them. And they’re loud. Squawky. It’s not like the birdsong you’d expect in that region.”
“Shit, I have no idea, Cas. They didn’t have their entire identity spelled out on their name tag, just their pronouns. Geez,” Dean says, feeling defensive.
“I adore the everloving shit out of you too, Dean,” Cas says with laughter in his voice. And on his face, too, because Dean can see that now. He doesn’t have to try to imagine the expressions to fit the voice. He has the whole picture.
“Maybe all of this could be simple. What do you think of that? If we could just make it easy somehow?”
“Oh geez, Cas, I dunno, probably because we’re the Winchesters? We used to have a reputation for killing first and asking questions later… Don’t work that way anymore, but that doesn’t mean people are gonna forget.”
“Yes?” Cas says, and the question isn’t whether or not that’s true, but rather ‘what is your point’.
Cas’ position is that Dean needs to value himself more and take better care of himself. Dean doesn’t have a position, because Cas is right. Kind of. The problem is that Cas doesn’t know how much progress Dean has actually made in this area. Dean knows it doesn’t seem like it from the outside, since he’s been so depressed without Cas, but he knows himself. He knows he’s different after everything Cas said.
“You think?!” Dean exclaims. “Cas, that’s gotta be the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard! I mean, Sam is one thing - we’ve been pretty codependent before - but - but Bobby? You think I longed to see Bobby when he wasn’t around? Or Jody? Garth?! And - and what about when you were standing right next to me but you could still feel it? I mean, did you think I longed for more when I hung out with Charlie? Seriously?”
“I can’t handle the idea of never seeing you again. I just can’t do it, man. I can’t do it. Don’t make me. Don’t do this to me, Cas. Please. Just come on and—and just let me look at you. Just—just let me—I have to—I need to—”
“Hunted a witch today. Well, we found him and then he got away. Kinda weird since we would have let him go anyway… He didn’t seem to be up to anything, you know? And he was weirdly happy about meeting us; said he was a fan. You know, I thought he meant because of the apocalyptic crap, but now I’m realizing he might have just read the Supernatural books. Huh. Well, either way, I think he’s fine. It was a long shot anyway.” Dean sighs. Rolls his eyes. “Witch hunts, man. I don’t know why we bother. I mean, I know, we prevent a lot of dumbasses from accidentally blowing themselves up. This isn’t just a hunting operation anymore, it’s an outreach program. Blah, blah.”
Sam looks shocked again, but in a totally different way that Dean doesn’t recognize at all. Which makes sense, considering this is the first time Dean’s ever admitted to having gay feelings for an angel of the Lord. It’s an unusual situation.
“Well I dunno what kind of stuff you’re into, Cas, but I think I’ll try anything once. For you, I mean. Easy,” Dean says, trying to sound nonchalant.
Because that’s what’s happening here, isn’t it? It’s sickening to realize that this feels familiar. Cas is keeping something from Dean. Again.
Dean wants to say something clever, or at least something normal, but he’s got nothing. And now that there’s no pressure of a line behind him, Dean is just kind of stuck there on the spot, staring. He really likes Amal’s earrings.
“You don’t have to, like, sign off, you know, if you don’t want to. You could just, you know, keep talking. While I fall asleep, if you want to.
“Yeah, you can do whatever you want with me in bed, actually,” he says, letting his voice go deeper.
“Afraid of what? That I didn’t feel the same? I mean, you had to have realized the truth by now. Right?”
The feeling that slices through Dean is hot and cold and deep and wide. It’s the kind of wrong feeling that only betrayal can engender.
Less amazing is the fact that Dean was definitely going to suggest exactly what Cas said. And coming from Cas’ mouth it sounds good, because Cas’ voices always sounds good, but it also sounds like a really stupid idea. Maybe that’s just the tone Cas is using, like Dean is the most exasperating person Cas has ever met in his long, long life.
Is this convenient, though? Is this what Cas intends with this conversation? Is he fucking with him or is he being sincere? What is going on?!
“What the hell, Cas? You thought - ? Are you friggin’ kidding me?” Dean knows he shouldn’t be raising his voice, but really, what the hell?
“Is that what this is?” Cas asks, because he’s a smartass who’s apparently found his footing in the conversation now.
Dean hadn’t said that he missed Jack. Hadn’t thought it was his place to even think about missing Jack. To hear Cas acknowledge it, to sympathize with him… It feels like forgiveness he doesn’t deserve.
“The same as every time I make dinner, I guess? It’s just a regular grocery store, but I’m pretty sure they have everything I’d need for whatever I decide to make.”
“I can’t believe that of all the times you could have dropped in on me, it had to be one of those. Of all the times we talked!” Dean (humiliatingly) practically gushes.
There’s a sharp intake of breath beside him, followed by an equally sharp pang of joy inside of Dean at eliciting it. It morphs into feeling like a case of the butterflies ramped up to eleven. He wants more of that.
“So, what, are you regretting what you said before? Is that it? You don’t wanna tell me you’ve changed your mind?”
He can’t regret it, though, seeing the affection crinkling at the corners of Cas’ eyes and the amusement in his smile.
“Hey! Cas!” Dean replies, sitting up straight. He drops what he’s doing and sits back in his chair a little.
“I can’t wait to touch you, you know—like just. You’re just—I just can’t wait to see you. Not that I’m going anywhere, even if you make me wait. I
“Please talk to me. Cas. You can draw this out, but what’s the point? Because you’re ashamed, you’re embarrassed? Who cares? How many times have you seen me make a fool of myself, huh? Every damn day, almost. Dude, I’m fine.
. It was Dean’s own fault for wanting to hear what Latin actually sounded like before it was a dead language, but he knew it was a mistake from the very first syllable out of Cas’ mouth. But the mistake felt too good, so he didn’t stop Cas from moving on to other old languages with strange sounds that turn Dean into a puddle of goo. He barely made it three miles before he had to pull over, because while he could drive one-handed and drive distracted, he probably shouldn’t drive one-handed while being
The tantrum doesn’t last long, because Dean’s reason for being on the floor in the first place is pretty much the only thing Dean can reliably focus on right now.
“I mean yeah, Sam, what do you want me to say? I have no idea how it’ll go down. I still haven’t seen him since we got him back.”
Of course Dean would pull some self-sacrificing bullshit to save the people he loves. That’s just how it is. Dean is expendable. He knows it’s a cliche to feel that way; he knows that nobody else would agree with him. Hell, he knows he’s objectively wrong. But it’s just how he feels.
“I like talking to you, Cas,” Dean says. He doesn’t even want to cover it up or downplay it somehow—he just leaves it like that. A simple fact.
He’s not gonna say it like that, not just yet, but he thinks it really, really hard. He keeps eye contact and wishes Cas will stay with every ounce of hope that he has.
It makes sense, actually. He’s still trying to figure out how to get Cas from the Empty, but now he’s got Cas right next to him for the whole thing. Well, figuratively. But he can ask for advice. He can keep Cas updated. He doesn’t have to feel the guilt of leaving Cas in the dark. (Figuratively
“Don’t you start with that!” Dean groans. “It’s not cute, it’s annoying. It’s cowardice, is what it is!”
“Not much of a conversation right now,” Dean says. He picks at the label on his bottle and doesn’t look at Cas.
“I know from your actions that you’re the most loving human I’ve ever met. If I hadn’t already known that about you, maybe I would have understood things differently. But it didn’t occur to me that you’d be… interested in me that way, so. It seemed to fit. It fit what I already knew. And I - I didn’t have a reason to think otherwise.”
Cas takes off his shoes and surprises Dean by removing his coat. He crawls hands-first onto the bed to sit next to Dean, rather than sitting down on the edge before pulling his legs up like he’d usually do.
There. That wasn’t so hard. Easy, even. Words had just kept tumbling out, knowing exactly where and how to land. He can see on Cas’s face that it had all needed to be said, so he can’t bring himself to feel self-conscious about a single word of it.
“No, really! In the past you’ve been… very adamant about being straight.” Too adamant, is what Sam means. He’s not wrong.
“There’s something nice about it. You being around. Even if I didn’t know about it. I mean I’m still pissed off, don’t get me wrong. But now that we’re not talking, I don’t know. I miss talking to you. I’d take the disembodied voice Cas over no Cas. Any day. Not even a question.”
Dean knows what gives, but at the same time? He doesn’t really. Cas is obviously reluctant to talk to Dean after what he’d said to trigger his deal with the Empty. He’d said all that under the assumption that he’d never have to face a response. Dean understands. He would definitely feel the same if he were in that position. But Cas? Cas is the bravest, purest, and most sincere person that Dean has ever met. How could someone like that be afraid to talk to someone like Dean?
“You just woke up? And the first thing you did was—wait, it’s been nine hours, Dean. Have you been asleep this whole time?”
“Like I said, I never expected to have any of these moments at all. I’m - I definitely feel unprepared for this conversation.”
Dean struggles to pick an adjective that Cas won’t immediately dismiss, but Cas doesn’t let him finish.
“Dean, that wasn’t really about sex. Not that I don’t want to, but… It’s much more than that. And I don’t want you trying to be intimate with me just because you think it’s what I want.”
Dean should feel prepared, on the other hand. He’d prayed! While Cas was in the Empty, Dean had known he wouldn’t hear him but he’d prayed anyway. He’d spilled his guts over and over in a hundred different ways. He’s had plenty of practice with this conversation - his side of it, at least.
Normally, Dean is fully aware that he should be saying something, and fully aware that everything would work out better if he did, but he struggles to get his foot out the door. Usually, he can barely open his mouth, let alone allow all
“Yeah, I mean, sure. Definitely. Yeah,” Dean says. The idea of his hand anywhere near Cas’ mouth is distracting the hell out of him.
Like what should he say? ‘How are you doing?’ He’s stuck in the Empty. ‘What are you up to?’ He’s stuck in the Empty. That’s probably why Dean has always started their conversations. What does Cas have to talk about?
Because if they don’t leave now, whatever it is Cas is planning will happen right here. That’s the implication. Okay, then. Right.
. It’s within the realm of possibility now. It’s possible enough that it feels amazing just to pretend that’s what he means.
Dean falls asleep to the sound of Cas’ voice, and the last thought he remembers having is that he can’t wait to wake up and hear it again.
from Cas. Everything else? Whatever it is they’re about to embark on? It’s all extra. Dean wants it so bad, but he doesn’t need anything the way he needs to have Cas by his side. He’s accepted that now, and he’s no longer afraid to show it.
“Cas, please. We can talk about this. Please talk to me. Come on, man. I’m begging you, here. Don’t do this. Not now, not after—I just—I thought we were—I mean, haven’t you been—”
“I’m sorry about yesterday. It just pisses me off. Why’d you lie to me like that? And where are you? I don’t even know if you’re still listening. I just—whatever. That’s all I got today.”
Dean is now past the point of being able to salvage any of this, so he just ignores Cas and smiles weakly at Amal, who surprisingly doesn’t seem to be judging him.
“Hey Cas. I’m on my way to buy some stuff; gonna be a bit of a drive. Usually, I’d put on some music, but with Sam home this week it’ll be nice to just talk to you for a bit. Hope you don’t mind. And I hope you’re doin’ alright today,” Dean prays as he leaves the bunker behind in his rearview. “What are you up to, anyway?”
“If you think I just want to save you because of what you said before you died, then you’re a bigger idiot than I thought.”
it from you, but, I mean, I guess I was. Whatever. I’ve almost told you every time I prayed these past few days. Ever since I talked to Sam. I just stopped being angry at you, just like that. And I knew I had to say it, that I wanted to tell you. I thought if I could just get you to come talk to me… but I kind of figured you wouldn’t. You can be predictable sometimes, Cas. It’ll take you a helluva long time to get your ass down here, if I don’t do this—well I don’t know if this is even working, do I?”
“I get that he’s nervous, but so am I! I mean, he’s the one whose cards are already on the table. I’m the one who has shit to say! I don’t even know if I’ll be able to say it, but I’ll never find out if I never even see the guy!”
Smart-ass. Goddammit, Cas is adorable. It is unbelievably, inhumanely unfair how adorable this guy is. When he’s barely doing anything at all; he’s just sitting there, having his hand held and being in love with Dean.
As Dean talks to Cas, he makes his way down the aisles, grabbing the things he needs for the stew as well as for the next few days of meals. He talks to Cas about other types of stew that he’s made. Cas tells him about a “soup” he had at a shitty diner back when he was human. Dean spends a long time just standing in the middle of the produce section as he tries to change the subject without sounding like he’s changing the subject. Without making obvious the visceral self-hatred that courses through him before he can calm himself down, staring with unseeing eyes at the organic broccoli.
“Hey, no. I believe you,” Dean says before he even considers whether or not that’s true. (Fortunately, it is.) “Why, uh—why just once? When was it?”
this. You’ve fucked up before, but this is the worst thing you’ve ever done. I mean it. This is the worst thing. The worst. I don’t even know—I can’t even think of anything worse that’s happened to me. I mean I know there has been, but I can’t even think of any right now. I can’t— I can’t imagine anything feeling as bad as this. I’ve been trying to free you—trying so hard to get you out of there—but you’ve been out all along. How is that even
“I have to bring my register drawer to the office and everything, but I should be out in like fifteen minutes,” Amal says. “If you wanna hang out.”
The pleading reassurance in Cas’s voice indicates that he doesn’t intend for his words to land the way they do. Far from reassured, Dean feels cold all over.
“Grocery list? Didn’t make one. But I figure I’ve been eating like crap for a while now, so it’s time to cook some vegetables or something. Hey, have you ever had beef stew?” Dean asks Cas as he locks the car door.
“You’re telling me that all this time, you’ve known exactly how I feel about you,” Dean says incredulously.
it the way he normally would. There just isn’t much room to feel anything other than ecstatic relief that he’s talking to Cas.
“Do you mean that?” Cas finally asks, his voice quieter than it’s ever been. He is - honest to god - actually wringing his hands.
“Okay, here we are. I’m out shopping. Didn’t bring my headphones and I don’t wanna hold the phone up to my face, so I’m gonna let you go until I’m on my way back home.”
He just really, really, really wants to do it in person. He really hopes Cas lets him do it in person.
Dean had figured it wouldn’t, though, is the thing. It’s why he let himself pour his heart into that tape in the first place. Hours of work with Cas on his mind every single minute. He let his love for Cas wash over him as he waded blissfully into it, and then threw his love letter in a bottle out to sea - most likely never to be found. There was the slightest chance that Cas could have picked it up, though, which was bold enough for Dean.
Every single thing about Cas except his words indicate that he knows exactly where he’s supposed to be sitting. From his posture to the tone of his voice, Dean can tell that Cas is dying to join him on the bed. Even his expression gives it away—his eyes drawn to the spot on the sheets next to Dean, his lips pulled slightly into his mouth to worry between his teeth.
“Cas. Please. Just…” Dean sighs, setting down his sandwich. He’s still hungry, but he shouldn’t have his mouth full for this. “Can you just believe me when I tell you that there’s nothing on Earth I could do and not still need you? There’s no other path where I don’t need you. It doesn’t exist, okay? It doesn’t matter what I’m doing or where I am, I’m always gonna need you. For me. Not for your help, or because I owe you anything. But because I want you around. Everyone has their priorities, right? Well, you’re my priority, so get used to it.”
“This is still the same conversation, Dean. We’ve just been taking a break,” Cas says. Dean doesn’t need to be watching to know how he looks when he uses that voice: affectionate, indulgent. Earnest.
“So yeah. I hope that whatever you’re up to… I hope you’re safe. That’s the most important thing. Even if that means we’re gonna have to talk about why you wanted to hide from me in the first place.”
He had just gotten back from the flea market with a bunch of used books, and he had them spread out on a table and was describing them all to Cas. Two of them were especially exciting for Dean, as they were the next installments of a series he’s been collecting. He tried concealing his excitement about those two particular books, because he wasn’t about to volunteer information about his guilty pleasure romance novel thing, thank you very much. But Cas caught on, somehow, and asked about the series. He sounded so sincere, so interested, that Dean couldn’t help but answer. He told Cas about the books, and why he liked them, and Cas was so honestly, earnestly
“I doubt it’s a curse; on the contrary, it’s probably some sort of blessing. Maybe a hybrid with some type of spellcasting—” Cas stops speaking so abruptly that Dean panics.
Dean is really starting to wonder if Cas even wants to come back at all. He’s so strangely resistant.
As fun as this has been, there’s a conversation that needs starting. Might as well be now. He only regrets it slightly when Cas breaks eye contact.
Dean is starting to get antsy about the whole thing. He’s not exactly anxious, but he’s so amped up that his body interprets it as anxiety. He had to cut down on the caffeine because he’d started to feel like he was vibrating out of his skin. For someone Dean never sees, Cas sure does occupy a whole lot of space in Dean’s head most of the time. He finds it difficult to really focus on anything else, so he’s watched a LOT of movies the past few days - just zoning out with only half his attention on the screen.
“Is it even possible to feel more anticipation than we already do?” Cas asks. He’s got one eyebrow raised skeptically and Dean loves him so fucking much.
“Right. So, I just, you know.” Dean clears his throat, looks down at his hands where he’s picking at a fingernail. “I figured we should probably talk.”
Yeah. Okay. Dean is also about to break the record for fastest orgasm in his life, but that’s probably for the best. He can’t keep doing this. This will be the last time.
“Okay, cool. And I got a sofa for the Dean Cave too. So we can, uh—” Dean falters, because Cas has leaned back in and is slowly kissing Dean’s neck. It takes everything Dean has to stop himself from throwing his head back and moaning. He’s barely keeping it together. “So you can sit with me, you know. Instead of separate chairs.”
Dean feels strongly about that. He can’t tell whether he feels good or bad, he just knows it’s intense.
He might be getting ahead of himself, because Cas looks kinda like he’s about to toss this entire conversation aside and drag Dean back to his bedroom. Which is a good look on him, obviously. Really good. Dean considers following that train of thought, but then lets it go. Not the time. They need to understand each other, here. He can’t believe how badly they’d misunderstood each other, and he’ll be damned if he’s just gonna let that keep happening.
“Sorry Dean, I forgot that it’s rude to talk on the phone when you’re checking out. You could have warned me, though,” Cas says.
Dean’s indignation melts away because Cas isn’t completely wrong. It feels nice, really, to hear how well Cas knows him. Just a few months ago, Dean would have bristled at hearing his sentimentality put into so many words, but now it feels too good to protest. It feels good to be seen by Cas.
Dean can’t control the smile growing on his face just at the relief from knowing that Cas still wants to talk to him. But Cas can’t see him, so he doesn’t even really want to. Smiling is just fine.
Dean feels a pang of disappointment slash through him, and it stings like rejection even though he knows it’s not. The old Dean might have lashed out and made his negative emotions into everyone else’s problem, but he no longer has the inclination. At least, not right now.
“Thank you for, uh, inviting me,” Cas says, kinda idiotically, in Dean’s opinion. But at least it’s endearingly idiotic.
, here. We talked about this! And I cleaned my room, right? And I’m eating better now. This is as good as it gets, man. At least until I get you back.”
Dean can do that. He doesn’t know what’ll happen when they get there, but he wants it, whatever it is.
Dean is crazy—he knows he’s crazy, but Cas’ voice dropped just the smallest bit, didn’t it? That shouldn’t be possible. Dean is going insane right now.
Cas is seriously doing this right now. Unbelievable. And still, Dean has no idea how innocent this is or isn’t supposed to be.
“You assumed that I couldn’t love you as an angel,” Cas says, still sounding a bit offended at the idea.
“Why are you sitting here in the dark by yourself?” Sam asks from the doorway, making Dean jolt in surprise.
in his ear for entire hours and entire days, though. Everywhere Dean is, Cas can reach him. Dean can reach back. No matter what he’s doing, he can have Cas to listen to. He can have Cas to talk to. If Dean whispers, like he does when he’s curled up in bed every night, Cas will whisper back.
“And before you get all freaked out, you should know I’m looking forward to talking about this. Might be hard to believe, but I’m serious. Can’t wait. And it’s not just that I’m desperate to hear your voice again. I just want to understand, you know? I wanna know what’s been going on with you. Because I care about you, you know?”
of Dean’s interest in shitty erotica that Dean pretty much lost his mind. He still doesn’t understand what came over him, but he somehow managed to have the best orgasm in his life during that goddamn conversation about flea market paperbacks.
To see Cas smile, on top of that? Dean doesn’t even have a word for how that makes him feel. Incandescent, maybe.
Dean is having breakfast remarkably late, because he slept in remarkably late. He can’t even remember the last time he slept nine hours.
“We use those words because we all have the same Father. But it’s nothing like the bond you and Sam have. And it’s absolutely nothing like how I feel about you,” Cas says, his irritation turning fond by the end, seemingly at the reminder that he has Feelings.
Things are different now. Why should Dean still live like this? Does he want to lie in a filthy bed and talk to Cas, surrounded by the disgusting reminders of his own grief?
“Have you tried to find him?” Sam asks. The smirk on his face tells Dean he knows the answer but is asking just to be a little bitch.
His eyes never leaving Cas’s face, Dean slowly places his other hand over the back of Cas’s knuckles, until he’s clasping his own hands together with Cas’s hand tucked snugly inside.
“I’m glad to hear that, Dean, but don’t you think you should take more time for other things? There’s more to life than—”
“Wow. Thanks, Dean,” Cas says sarcastically, and the way he’s trying to be funny and just barely missing the mark is actually really fucking funny.
“Well, buddy. There’s this thing that happened to me a couple days ago, I’m not sure if you remember. When I could suddenly talk to my best friend who I’d been mourning for months? That thing.”
Dean has to ignore him because there’s no way he’s going to talk to his imaginary friend right there in front of the cashier and all three people in line behind him.
Cas is quiet for a long time again. Dean tries not to panic, because if this keeps happening his nervous system is going to take a real beating after a while. He closes his eyes and tries to pretend that Cas is sitting next to him. He imagines that the silence is nothing more than two friends comfortable in each other’s presence without the need for words. It helps, because comfortable silence with Cas has always been one of his favorite sounds.
better than that, you have to! I need you here; I’ve always needed you here, and you just… You’re just not here. You don’t want to be here. It kills me. This is
“Oh, yeah. Now that we’re both clear on what we want? We can drive each other insane without even touching.” Dean stops, an idea rapidly forming. “Hey, we’ll still be able to talk when I pray, even if you’re on Earth, right?”
He hasn’t seen Cas since he died. They’ve spent countless hours talking; Dean has heard his voice over and over again. But he hasn’t seen his face. He hasn’t had eyes on Cas in so long that Dean feels like he’s finally taking a drink of water after an eternity of thirst.
