“And like I said then, there was no way I could have done anything else. It was obvious you were going to go running off vigilante style, no matter what I said. But I mean even before that, when Bobby, Frank, and then the major all told you off for messing with your radio, and you kept doing it anyway. I know you didn’t have any proof back then that you were listening to a living person. I’m just trying to figure out why you decided to ignore everyone.”
“I’d sooner build us a shelter out of branches and leaves with my own bare hands,” Castiel said as he joined Dean on the floor. “But no, Amelia’s a die-hard camper, and she’s more than equipped to spend an entire season roughing it, let alone a long weekend like this one.”
but whatever this one-sided connection was, it was doing strange things inside Dean with every hearing. When the guy was happy, Dean felt warmth in his own chest and a smile on his lips. When the guy was nostalgic, Dean wanted to pour him a drink and let him talk until the memories stopped aching. When the guy grew morose, it was almost painful not to be able to wrap his arms around him, pull him close, and do or say anything he could to soothe and encourage him.
The strange silence of the bunker stretched around them once more, and they stood staring at each other, unmoving, waiting for something to start making sense.
“Just think of the stories you’ll have when it’s all over,” Castiel said, the noises of thumping and banging resuming. Dean shook his head, thinking it would be a long, long time before he’d be able to find much humor in any of this.
with jewelry. That’s too much, too fast. Technically, courting gifts are supposed to start with something perishable, not permanent. Flowers, you know. Candy, or something sweet like that.”
Dean was frowning at him, shaking his head in disagreement. “No, Cas. That was back then. We lived through all that already, don’t you remember?”
Castiel had found himself brainstorming a list of titles after the local parents had clamored loudly for more musical content. Most of the songs that had sprung to mind at first were all under copyright, so he’d needed to search out folk tunes and rhymes. “Well, wherever it was hidden in your brain, I’m glad you unearthed it.”
“Not so many of those who’ve come to the attention of the big decision-makers,” Naomi retorted, then sighed. “What am I supposed to do? I don’t want to arrest you. You would have been an amazing soldier, and you still could be, but…”
Dean was also feeling a lot better, if more tired. Castiel had been right about the whole catharsis thing; with bits of drywall scattered around him on the floor and all over his clothes, and some pleasant soreness in his forearms, he felt like he’d managed to get his little bit of payback on this mess. He brushed some of the dust from his thighs, grateful that Castiel had made the practical suggestion of removing his dress shirt before diving into the job. “Well, I prepared for having to do a bunch of repairs,” he explained, lifting the goggles from his face to rest on top of his head. “Overprepared, I thought. No spouse or kids, simple tastes…a lot of my paycheck was going into a ‘someday’ fund, and I guess I figured that the ‘someday’ might as well be now, while I can enjoy it. I mean, granted, I thought I was going to be spinning out these renovations gradually, one project at a time.”
Maybe it was due to the focus of his academic field, but it took Dean an extra beat to catch up. His first thought was one of confusion, because it looked as though he was holding a tasteful gift basket of garage supplies. A moment later, it registered that the enormous cans of engine lubricant were cleverly designed, but not, in fact, intended for actual engines.
They finished getting ready for the day before stepping out of the tent and into the open air. “Okay, let’s get this party rolling,” Castiel said, clapping his hands together and rubbing them. “Coffee?”
The feel of teeth digging into the meat of his shoulder sent fiery agony through his entire body. Naomi was still trying to pull him away, shrieking his name over and over, and the distant part of his brain that was still capable of any thought wondered if it was possible to be torn in two this way, whether it could possibly hurt more than he was already hurting. Then, abruptly, he wasn’t being pulled, because Naomi had dropped his arm and was stumbling back, her eyes wide and hopelessly terrified. And then she ran, disappearing into the chaotic darkness.
Dean couldn’t tell whether Castiel was pulling his leg or just stretching the truth for the humor of it, but it didn’t matter; the moment they met eyes, they both cracked up laughing. “Heh, guess it’s a good thing I didn’t tell Sam you were a racehorse trainer, or maybe a rodeo clown.”
Dean was absolutely floored. From the way Castiel’s jaw was trembling, he could easily tell that Castiel was nervous about how his confession would be taken, probably still worried about coming off as a creepy stalker type. He wasn’t crying anymore, but his eyes were still rather glassy, waiting to see how Dean would react.
Meanwhile, Sam was moving away and standing. “Over here!” he shouted. More voices were coming, asking rapid questions too quickly for Castiel to follow. He hissed in pain again as he was jostled and shifted. When hands slipped under his shoulders and hips and lifted him onto the waiting stretcher, though, the pain that ripped through his body was too much, and he cried out inarticulately, trying to curl up against it.
Dean laughed, but it wasn’t a happy sound. “Yeah, I don’t think right and wrong are concepts that apply here. Are you starting to get the picture now?”
“You haven’t seen the house lately,” Dean said wryly. It was midway through September, and by his count, there were now over five hundred books sitting in various spots around their home. Castiel had books covering his nightstand, books piled on the coffee table, and books stacked on the kitchen counter. The dining room had been all but taken over by boxes of books, and Dean had learned the hard way not to try reorganizing the madness; there was apparently a system by which Castiel was working his way through the books. “Just trust me when I say that December can’t come soon enough. And on that note, guess what everyone’s getting for Christmas this year?”
“No,” Castiel said. “No, I won’t. I’ll send them whatever blood or tissue samples they need, or they can come to me, but I’m not going.”
“Good, good.” Miss Talbot’s cheerful smile flashed brightly and was gone, swiftly replaced with something more sharp. “And, of course, you understand that your contract with my clients establishes that you are aware of the nature and condition of the house? That, in exchange for what is frankly a
Claire was warbling her way for the fourth time through some song Dean thought might have been from Mulan, but he wasn’t paying too much attention. His pulse was thundering in his ears, and each thud was like an anvil blow to his temple. There was sweat running into his eyes, and the trees around them were shimmering and swaying as if they were underwater, making it hard to focus.
“Dean?” he thought he heard the second man say, creeping up behind the first man cautiously. Those green eyes narrowed a little as a tiny frown crept between them.
“Sure, same thing they tried near Omaha,” Dean said. “Sam and I were north of there, in the Sioux Falls area. We had to cut west into farm country in order to come south to get here.”
, hissed something inside of him. “You’re supposed to get there and escape, and then I’m supposed to…to…” He blinked, trying to think, and in that blink he saw a woman in a suit, reddish hair neatly coiffed, smiling with eyes of steel.
Realizing he was backed into a corner, Dean swallowed his protests. “Understood, Major. I see what you mean, and I’ll definitely remember that in the future. Right now, though, I need to tell you that this guy is somewhere in the area, alone and apparently unaware that there are any living souls besides him anywhere around. And, uh, if it helps your decision, he’s also apparently sitting on some pretty sweet tech, so we should…go after him?”
Castiel was wearing a tiny, tentative smile of encouragement when he maneuvered his horse close beside Dean’s as they made their way out of the paddock. Maybe he was just making sure he’d be within grabbing distance of Dean’s reins if the stallion decided to bolt, but it didn’t matter one bit. The two of them let Sam take the lead, turning north toward home.
The skin was warm, almost hot; the stubble prickled the pads of his fingers. He even felt the soft flutter of Dean’s pulse, racing nearly as quickly as Castiel’s was.
The wooded area thinned, opening into an area cleared of trees; a very strange winding trail, nearly swallowed by the taller growth surrounding it, swept back and forth tightly across the field. “What the heck is this?” Donna asked, jerking her thumb in the direction of it.
The pair sauntered off, still gossiping, while Dean tried to make sort through what he’d just learned. So, Castiel was dreaming about the time when Anna was still on the run from Heaven, before she’d decided to rejoin Team Apocalypse. That had been an insane time, with everyone on their tails and trying to make them fit their little apocalypse plan. Anna’s betrayal had been a low blow.
“From Castiel? That would absolutely be the kind of thing he’d use to try to court a mate,” she said with a smirk. “And it looks like it worked, didn’t it? He found someone who’d appreciate what he wanted to give, I guess.”
Dean was talking, but Castiel was having a hard time focusing on his words. He was just continually repeating the same things, anyway, and Castiel knew that there was simply no possibility of truth in the insane argument that he was dreaming, as Dean kept insisting.
“The major was in here last night, wasn’t she?” he muttered, not waiting for Tessa’s nod before going on. “So she knows, but she didn’t say anything? Damn it to hell.” He bent his neck forward, shaking his head with his eyes closed. “Tessa, you wanna…can you give us a minute or two?”
“There’s a small creek a little further beyond here to the east, but we are less than a quarter-mile from the main part of the base,” she said, voice lowered but steely. “It would be best from here out if we spoke as little as possible, moved as quickly and quietly as possible, and tried to keep our minds on the mission at hand.” Silence greeted her instructions; Dean thought he already heard groaning in the distance.
He had no idea whether that was true. In fact, it probably wasn’t, or else Castiel would probably not have jumped so quickly to the assumption that tapping heels automatically meant Meg’s approach. Maybe. It didn’t matter, because Castiel’s fragile state of mind had evidently been pushed so far off balance by their arguing that Dean’s suggestion was now deemed plausible enough to be worrying. Castiel’s distressed gaze flitted swiftly from the door to Dean and back again as he fought with himself over what he could or should believe. A pained look came over his face as he reached an uncertain conclusion, and he vanished with a flutter of wings. Cursing, Dean sprinted for the door, just hoping that dreaming Castiel would head to the same place that the conscious one did.
“I just want to say that I am completely honored that you told me. Really. This is a big deal, and I’m so proud of you. And you’re in a relationship, too! God, all those times I told you how worried I was about you being lonely, you had—”
Sitting on the bed facing him, Dean was leaning forward with his elbows propped on his knees, completely drawn in. Castiel had been talking all morning, trying to explain what had happened to bring him here. More than once, he’d had to stop, wrapping his arms around himself and shaking as he tried to push past the memories that still gripped his heart. When Castiel had started silently weeping as he described his mother’s death, Dean could no longer hold back; he’d jumped out of the easy chair in which he’d started out and climbed onto the bed beside Castiel to gently hold him, rocking back and forth in silence until Castiel released a shuddering breath and went on talking.
A few seconds passed, and then Castiel’s curiosity seemed to win over his stubbornness. “Fourteen what?”
Meg snorted. “That’s what it’s always about. So what did you do, go on Craigslist and offer to pay someone? Go on Grindr and offer to—”
“Ow, watch the steel toes. Maybe…half.” More like three quarters, but Dean’s leg was getting sore. From the pinched look on Castiel’s face, he could tell the number was being fudged.
“You’ve been calling me ‘Cas,’” he said, finally changing the subject after the silence had stretched just a fraction too long for any reply to feel comfortable. Dean looked confused and a little abashed, and he looked like he was about to apologize, so Castiel shook his head. “It’s fine, don’t worry about it. My college friends gave me far stranger and much more inappropriate nicknames, believe me. My family…well, they weren’t the nicknaming sort, and I suppose it struck me as unusual that you gave me one so quickly. But, then, I suppose imminent death does tend to expedite friend-making.”
Gratifyingly, the wisecrack made Castiel snort, his scowl relaxing somewhat. “Deal. Truthfully, I would prefer to keep Gabriel as far as possible from my personal life, in all aspects. Unfortunately, I’ve never figured out an effective way to manage it.”
“Because I can see your calendar, and I know your schedule, and there’s no way you could have kept it from me even if you’d wanted to,” she replied without hesitation, and he nodded ruefully in concession. “Anyway, more deets. If he didn’t hit you, what did he do? Cancel the job?”
“Whoa, whoa, Cas,” Dean said in a much softer tone than before, voice full of concern, and his hands were right there, steadying Castiel by his upper arms. That was strange; Castiel hadn’t even noticed himself begin to stagger in place. “Christ, Cas, you’re an ice cube. Here, put this on; it’s drier than yours, anyway.”
“You a doctor, too?” Dean tried to joke, but his words all came out breathless and weird. Castiel just rolled his eyes and helped Dean stumble to the bathroom, where he turned on the faucet and pushed Dean’s hand under the flow of cold water.
Picking up his phone once more, Dean returned to the conversation from which he’d been pulled. In the chaos, he’d missed the buzz of a couple more texts, apparently.
“How about we leave this here, go eat dinner, and deal with the rest of it later? Frankly, I’m having trouble concentrating on anything other than the smell of grilled meat right now,” Castiel said as he stood up and dusted his hands on the front of his jeans. “Roadhouse?”
Fact: whoever this guy was, he was remarkable. Piecing together everything he knew or had guessed, Dean was almost sure the guy was still in Kansas or nearby, but it was clear from his stories that he’d been all over, surviving on his own ever since the Crisis. He definitely was carrying more than a few scars, literal and figurative, from it, but at the same time, he was still making jokes, singing love songs, waxing poetic over the smell of clean sheets on a bed. He hadn’t lost his passion, when so many people around Dean had; he hadn’t lost his heart.
on the brink of death at the moment. He could probably hold off his own demise for at least a couple more hours.
“Less room than a human being,” Bobby answered. “But no, a chainsaw isn’t on anyone’s priority list right now. Hell, hatchets are pretty low down, at that. Top of the list was Red’s electronics supplies, batteries, hand tools. Don’t suppose you found any of that?”
Dean! Not a mechanic! I’m not saying one’s better than the other, but they’re not interchangeable! When’s the last time you stood in front of a classroom with a broken furnace and a wrench, or showed your students how to put up drywall? Your dissertation was about robot kinetics!”
“Probably. I remember Bobby saying how he tried calling around to distant friends and contacts before anybody knew what was really going on, when they thought it was just a weird flu. I know he said there was somebody in London…Belle? Bella? Isabelle? Anyway, she warned him it was there, too, even though they weren’t making it public, so he should stay put here. If they got hit about the same time we did, I can’t see how they would have done better.”
“Well, of course it was, because you thought you were the only person around. Kind of hard not to be selfish when there’s nobody else to put first,” Dean said, far too reasonably. “Anyway, I might have been trying to listen for clues about your hiding place, but I can’t say I wasn’t getting anything else out of it.”
“Ah, no,” Castiel replied. A pleased smile lit his face, one that said he had exciting news to share. “I may have forgotten to mention, but as it happens, I was selected to serve on a national book award council again.”
The sound of splashing footsteps pulled Dean’s attention forward once more, where Castiel was scaling the bank out of the lake and shaking the water from his hair. A familiar rush of warmth shot through Dean’s chest at the sight of Castiel’s gorgeous smile, pulling a matching grin to his own face before he realized. With water droplets streaming down his bare chest and glistening on his broad shoulders, he looked like some sort of Roman deity emerging from the sea.
Castiel cleared his throat. Tilting his head speculatively, he made an abortive move to tap a forefinger against his lips, stopping himself when he remembered the value of the document in his hands. “You know, this doesn’t have to be the end of your research, Dean,” he said slowly. “Perhaps you’ve exhausted the scope of this particular thesis, but if I were your advisor, I would definitely be amiss if I didn’t suggest that you might continue delving into the past, perhaps using this as a springboard into something you might publish.”
Dean and Tessa were still arguing, oblivious to his bewilderment. “Nobody wants to just throw him out of camp,” she was saying. “But you have to understand that this isn’t anything we’ve seen, and—”
“Yeah, they’re not bad,” he answered. “You certainly seemed to hit it off with them. How much of all that was you making up stuff, though?”
“Braggart,” Castiel deadpanned. “But you need to remember, Dean Winchester, that you are not the only one with a little room to boast. Did you know that there are three levels of qualified marksmanship in the United States Army, Dean? Out of forty targets, soldiers must hit at least twenty-three at various ranges and from a variety of positions. Hitting thirty will earn you a sharpshooter badge. Please guess how many I hit when I was tested.”
“Not women’s. Men’s. Manties, remember?” Completely shameless, Dean rose from the stool where he sat. Turning his side toward Balthazar, he lifted the long hem of his flannel overshirt to show where, rising above where the worn jeans rode low on his hips, a band of black lace circled his waist, bordering what were apparently a pair of vividly green panties.
"Are you one hundred percent on that?" Dean snapped, ignoring Sam's noise of consternation. "On both counts? It might or might not be Castiel, and I'm actually sort of inclined to believe it is, since everything this guy has said lines up exactly with—" he remembered at the last second that he really shouldn't throw Charlie under the bus "—everything you've said. He even talked about his brother Michael. Didn't you have a brother Mike in the service, too?"
A short laugh burst from Castiel’s chest. “Seriously?” He couldn’t imagine somebody like Dean, so full of confidence and humor and perfectly gorgeous on top of that, ever being intrigued by someone like him.
Dean didn’t know how to respond to that, so he didn’t. He nodded, and Sam smiled with that weird look again, and they rummaged in silence until the storm moved past over their heads.
"I keep wondering why I'm not falling apart over it. It hurts, like an ache when I forget and look around for him before it comes back. How come Dad was destroyed when he lost Mom, but I've lost both my folks and I'm not in pieces? I'm no stronger than he was. Dad was so tough. Sometimes, though, it was like he only had one purpose, taking care of her and us, and when that went away, he was just done. I think maybe you've got to have more than that. I love Sammy, I loved Mom and Dad, but I'm not living for them. I don't know if that makes any sense, but it's as good a reason as any."
“You know that you’ve got a couple of mature beech trees in the corner of the yard. They’re close enough to each other to support a hammock between them. I could see a nice pavement stone path to them, maybe with some in-ground well lights so you could use it at night.”
Well, it would be particularly inevitable today, Dean realized with chagrin as he turned his car onto his street and saw what awaited him. Ever since that first day, Castiel had been fine with parking his van in the back of the house, but apparently he wasn’t working alone today. A huge box truck, boldly emblazoned with the Deus Ex Machina logo, was parked out front; the back doors were open wide, and a large loading ramp ran from there to the ground. Leaning casually against the ramp with his arms folded was a short man with shaggy brown hair.
Castiel narrowed his eyes, trying to process this new information. “Are you thinking Dad and Doctor Benton were doing sinister experiments, and it ended up starting the apocalypse? That’s a rather big leap based on the evidence. It would also imply he had the cure, which he gave me.”
When Castiel had once described the chaotic Entity that held dominion over the Empty, he now realized, Dean’s brain had glossed over its physical appearance. After all, if a thing could change its face and form as easy as, well, probably not breathing, then it wasn’t much worth the time spent to picture it. He’d heard Castiel referring to it as “the Shadow” a couple of times, so that was what his mind had filled in when he gave much thought to it: a dark, menacing shape looming over everything, not having any kind of real substance but no less dangerous for the lack.
About thirty minutes into the hike, though, the proceedings came to an abrupt halt. “Ow,” Claire suddenly muttered, coming to a stop. “Ow!” she repeated, lifting one foot and poking at it.
“Damn straight,” Dean said vehemently, eyes widening. He turned to face the gathering group. “Well? What are we waiting for, guys? The zoms aren’t getting any less bitey, and we’ve got a world to fix! Load ‘er up!” He hoisted himself through the helicopter door without further hesitation, yelling back over his shoulder, “Dibs on the seat without the rips!”
“Did you think we were kidding?” Shaking his head, Sam adjusted his grip around Claire’s legs for the hundredth time. “Hey, Claire, look up and wave hello. Bobby’s got cameras in the trees.”
“I don’t suppose you’ve managed to make contact with this guy?” Sam asked doubtfully. “Let him know we’re coming, so he’ll open the main door?”
Oh, dear. Perhaps he had spoken too soon. Castiel was out of his seat, looming over the table, fists twisting in Dean’s shirt—
Castiel hesitated, but he couldn’t just accept the forgiveness as easily as it was offered. “You were listening out of a desire to find and rescue me, though. My prying was far more selfishly motivated.”
“Dean,” Castiel said with a frown. “Is it such a stretch for you to believe that I might care just because I
“Cannot believe you,” Castiel groaned, breaking away briefly for oxygen before diving right back into the hollow of Dean’s throat. “Stubborn, stupid…”
gave me a rather vivid demonstration last night of the sort of catastrophe that can happen to people when they try to handle sharp objects without being fully alert. You’ll just have to appreciate it for me.”
Dean smirked to himself as the chase pelted off in the wrong direction. He slow-counted to thirty once the noise had faded into the distance, and then slunk out of the…cleaning closet?
“And like I told you, it’s not your fault,” Dean replied. “I think I’ve gotten to know you pretty well at this point, enough to know that you’re nothing at all like him. Jesus, how did your folks manage to produce the both of you? You sure one of you wasn’t the mailman’s kid?”
“Baseboards,” Castiel said, which made utterly no sense at all, and Dean blinked, trying to translate the word into something relevant to what they were presently doing. Castiel dropped his head to Dean’s shoulder, burrowing in. “We have…the baseboards. And they really need to be nailed in place so that we can finish the painting. You are very distracting.”
, Castiel thought, trying the idea out to see how it felt. No immediate cognitive dissonance hit him, so he kept going.
, Castiel’s happy moment had come from pure relief and elation at having beaten a vengeful and destructive God and saved the world. Deep down, Sam wasn’t convinced. He’d seen the two of them turn toward each other, stepping closer, faces filled with so much pride and
“You know, I believe one damn beer won’t hurt a thing. I’m so aggravated right now that I’m more likely to make stupid mistakes if I don’t take a break than if I try to push through. At the rate I’m going, I’m going to put this knife right through the damn drywall, and then I’ll have to patch those holes, too.” There was a clunking noise, which was probably the drywall knife being tossed to the ground, and then Castiel was striding into the kitchen before Dean even had a chance to pull himself together and slap on a fake smile. Castiel paused halfway through the doorway, tilting his head with a concerned frown. “Dean?”
“Let’s get moving again,” Sam called from further upstream, startling them both. “I don’t think it’ll rain again, but I’d really like to be back before dusk, if we can.”  He was already back on his horse, waiting. Castiel stood, shaking the water from his hand, and offered the other to Dean for aid in standing. Dean still looked a bit flustered, but he smiled self-consciously as he accepted the help.
“Yes, though I wasn’t quite at the point of wanting to fight them, anyway. I had some trouble making my way the remaining miles without being spotted, but eventually I made it to the main gates, and it was immediately obvious that I’d wasted my time. Fort Leavenworth was completely, hopelessly overrun.”
Dean mused as Charlie deftly did something to the wires on the hinges and then, with an eerie creaking sound that caused all three of them to flinch and draw breath sharply, nudging it open a few feet. She froze, eyes darting, waiting to see if anyone would come investigate the noise, then wildly beckoned them forward to make their escape.
"Yeah, that's a non-starter," Sam said, rolling his eyes. "Like I'd let you go by yourself with nobody to watch your back. But you realize that trying to do this on our own, on foot, without any kind of backup or support from anybody else…it's a long shot that we're even going to make it to the bunker."
“Now, this is the part where I usually tell y’all to sit tight and let us do our job, but I get the feeling you’re not going to listen,” Ranger Lafitte said, smiling when Castiel proved him right by starting to object partway through the sentence. “So I’ll tell you what. I will not have you wandering around the woods doing your own hunting, because that way leads to us having to do even more search and rescue jobs. What I’ll do is let you ride along with me, back up the path, while I do my job.”
Dean grabbed his chest. “Naomi, I’ve changed my mind,” he said. “The human race doesn’t deserve to be saved.”
Dean stuck his tongue out, even though it wouldn’t be visible. “Very funny. At least somebody’s enjoying this.”
“Yeah, well, even so, I’m going to have to tell him soon anyway,” Dean sighed. “He’s so damn happy for me that now he’s begging me to let him meet you. Uh, I mean, not you. The fake you. God, I guess you’re right, I did get you involved in this.”
“Um,” hedged Dean, trying to orient the direction of his home and place his office within that framework. “I think so? It’s actually sort of angled, so maybe more south-east.” He didn’t know anything at all about feng shui or ley lines or any of that stuff, but he figured it was better to let Mrs. Tran go on thinking that than to tell her he’d chosen the color based on his boyfriend’s eyes.
“I couldn’t tell you that. What I can tell you is that I’d bet confidently that whatever it is, it’s what Dad was injecting into Mom and himself that night. I also have a fairly strong suspicion that I was not being inoculated against yellow fever in the months leading up to that night.”
“I will not have this conversation with you again,” Castiel growled. “This is massively inappropriate for any number of reasons, not the least of which is that I am
The sun had truly set while the brothers had been speaking, throwing the living room into darkness outside of the small glow provided by a street lamp outside the front window. Dean swept a palm across the wall, searching for the switch to turn on the overhead light. With a click, the room was lit—and then momentarily darkened again. Then the light was back on again, with a wavering, flickering glow that seemed to pulse irregularly in brightness. A tiny buzzing sound was barely perceptible, but undeniably present in the wall behind the switch. “Huh,” Dean said as he eyed the light. “Think I might start with the electricity.”
“Oh, yeah? Like what?” Letting his own hands drift downward over his boyfriend’s hips, Dean felt his heart rate start to quicken again. He probably wasn’t getting it up again anytime soon, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t enjoy the lazy pleasure of a little post-coital handsiness.
There really was no time for brooding, but Dean was going to need a moment to deal with the emotional sucker punch he’d just been dealt. How often did he hallucinate me being there? Was his subconscious trying to punish him for all that guilt he felt toward us by using my face and body as the form for some kind of monster? Please, God, let that not have been the way it went for real. Belatedly, he regretted having addressed that last bit to Chuck, but it wasn’t as though the guy could hear prayers where he was now.
“Told you not to make a big deal out of it,” Dean said, making sure to say it around a mouthful of bread just to see if he could get Sam to look even more pained.
“The…the guy!” Dean pointed wildly in the direction of the transmitter on his belt. “The one with the guitar! He’s not a recording, Sam—he’s actually out there, talking and…and hiding someplace, right now!”
Castiel paused before answering, intent on swallowing his second glass of whiskey almost as quickly as the first. When he placed the glass back on the counter, he sighed. “It’s the house,” he said.
The third reason on his list made Dean’s stomach twist for a whole bundle of reasons. Not only would Castiel’s departure signal the end of Dean’s romantic chances with him, but it would be the loss of a friend. No matter whether Castiel said that he wanted to keep spending time with Dean after the job was over; the odds were pretty high that, lacking the shared commonality of Dean’s home renovations, Castiel would quickly come to the conclusion that he and Dean were just too different to maintain a friendship. Seriously, the guy ran marathons for fun. What was Dean but a math nerd with a cool car and a well-honed ability to hide behind a cocky mask?
A few moments later, when he at last managed to open his eyes and unlock his jaw from its frozen-wide position, he found Castiel staring down at him, facial expression caught somewhere between awed and proud. “Okay, sex god,” Dean croaked through a throat now sore, rolling his eyes as he grinned tiredly. “You win this round.”
“Dean, I would love to come along some time and see you in action,” Castiel said, his voice dropping seductively. “The thought of you sweeping those ladies off their feet just…I honestly don’t think I can go on without witnessing that. Please, I must.”
“Um,” Dean started, eyeing Castiel with trepidation. “That sounded like a fun convo. I’m not really up for swinging a shovel right now, what with the bum hand and all, so if you’re gonna need help with a body, you might want to put the fratricide on hold until I’m healed up more.”
“Or else he had help covering it up, from people like Dad,” Castiel said. His voice was rough with tiredness, and he had his arm wrapped around Dean’s waist, refusing to let go.
“Would you court martial me?” he asked Naomi, voice surprisingly mild. “Is it truly the priority of the Army to chase down former soldiers who’ve gone AWOL at this point? Because I’m sure there are plenty.”
A light blush colored freckled cheekbones, but Dean smirked without looking away. “Well, I mean. They weren’t
“Uncle Cas is going to make you all better,” she was telling him now. “You’ll see. It’s going to be okay, Uncle Dean. Are you hungry? Mommy will make you some noodle soup, and you’ll feel much, much better. So you shouldn’t worry. Mommy and Daddy and Uncle Cas will come find us very soon.”
“Anyway, it’s not as though there’s much point to it now, or that I ever had the slightest inclination toward letting my family have a vote on who I chose to share my life with, but, well…” Grimacing, Castiel unzipped a first aid kit to peer inside critically, then tossed it to the side. “Going along with this now will let them feel satisfied, with a minimum of effort on our part. It’s just a camping trip, away from distractions so they can get to know you better as my mate. You don’t mind too much, do you?”
“Really? You don’t…” Dean bit off the rest of his sentence, looking away. He must have been giving Castiel too much credit for being sensitive to his feelings. It was looking more like he just hadn’t bothered to notice there were any feelings to worry over. Better and better.
Grateful that his blush wasn’t visible over the phone, Dean had been unable to deny the surge of warmth in his gut. “Anything you like, Cas,” he’d said.
Tomorrow. It could wait until then, he decided, and flipped the wall switch back down. “Okay,” he said aloud as he stood in the darkness. “This is…okay. It’s fine. I’ll just…” Running a hand over his face, he took a deep breath.
“Back door it is, then,” Sam muttered unhappily. “God, I thought I’d never have to do one of those again.”
Castiel nodded slowly. “All right,” he said. His eyes flitted about the room, examining everything critically as he considered. “Ordinarily, I’d start with the home’s exterior, but as it’s too dark to see much of anything, we’ll have to leave that for later. In the meantime, I can look at the structure from inside the house.”
“So, should we start with an actual date, no faking anything?” Dean suggested. “Dinner, drinks? I’d say dancing, but most of my moves would probably be a bit old-fashioned for anyplace outside of a retirement home.”
Castiel’s narrowed eyes said he did indeed tend to exact retribution from his brother before the evening was over, but he allowed Dean to tip his chin upward for a kiss, then gave a grudging little smile. “It better be good pie,” he replied.
“That’s true of almost everyone. Take Dean, I mean. Dean, you always look happier after a good workout, and it bleeds into everything else you do.” He patted Dean’s forearm, which lay on the table between them, and for a moment, Dean forgot that they were pretending.
“Go to hell, Dean,” Sam called back, beginning his own descent with much more cursing and muttering than Dean had done. “I fucking hate spiders.”
“It’s not that impressive,” said Linda, the children’s librarian who was adding tiny red board books to the structure to create the impression of ornaments. “We’ve been doing it for years, haven’t we?”
“Mmm, maybe,” Dean conceded, turning aside the compliment as he packed his guitar back into its case. “This has all got to be over soon, right?”
“We’re not here, except that if I end up dead in your freaky dream, that detail isn’t going to matter much.”
“Me, too,” Dean said. A fond smile played on his lips. “I know I gave you a hard time about doing this, but I’m sort of glad you pulled me in. For one thing, it’s keeping me from climbing the walls, you know?” Castiel nodded; he did know, indeed. “And for another, it’s bringing back all kinds of old memories, back from when I was a kid.”
“I have to make a call,” Naomi said, striding out of the room as she dialed, but Castiel didn’t really care, caught up in trying to make sense of what he was seeing.
“So this is as souped-up as I could get it, modified to get you a few more watts of power. Um, you’ll probably actually not want to have it on you any longer than you absolutely need to, since there are reasons handheld radios are limited to around five watts. For a day or two, you should be fine, but try not to, you know, touch the antenna with your bare hands?” She gave him a nervous smile of encouragement, stepping back. “You still probably won’t be able to talk to me for the better part of the trip, but I’ve got you tuned to a much lower band than we ordinarily use. If I lose the frequency we’re on now, you might have to search for me, but there’s nobody else around who should be using this band, and I’ll put everything I have into keeping it going strong.”
“Kinematics,” Dean automatically corrected. “Computational kinematics, bitch. There’s a difference. And that doesn’t matter, because it’s the principle of the thing. But you know what? Screw you. You’re so sure I’m going to crash and burn that you don’t
Sighing, Castiel emptied his glass, then pushed it across the counter for a refill. “Point conceded. They’re not musty, though. You know me better than to think I’d let them get damp.”
Dean pulled him closer, closing his eyes to pretend they weren’t surrounded by filthy and sweaty men and women, and kissed him as though the world were ending.
Dean visibly relaxed at the joke, and his sincere grin made Castiel feel rather pleased with himself.
Luckily, Castiel wasn’t the least bit offended. “Not that I’m opposed in principle, but I think it might be a little early in the game for bondage,” he said, grinning widely as he stood in fully nude glory. He bent and rummaged in his nearby bag for a second, then made a triumphant sound as he pulled out a few foil packets. Dean nodded in concurrence; there would be plenty of time for blood tests and all that business later, he hoped.
Sighing deeply, Castiel let his head fall backward on his neck, face toward the ceiling. “Remember when you told me how irritating you find it when your brother insists on giving advice where none is needed or desired, refusing to stop even when you’ve asked him to?” he said. “Well, I promise you, my brother could definitely give yours a run for his money. At least your brother is kind about his interference. Gabriel actually seems to enjoy it when he can push me to my breaking point.”
Castiel held up his palms in a gesture of skeptical surrender. “I’m sure you’re a capable guy, Dean. I’m just saying. Everyone watches ‘This Old House’ or whatever sanitized version of reality they’re selling on television, and they think it’s a matter of renting a floor sander and knocking down a few walls—which are never, ever load-bearing, of course—to make some sort of ‘open floor plan’ paradise out of the run-down shack that they alone could see as the true diamond in the rough it always was.” He snorted, shaking his head. “I’m not saying that’s what you did, but honestly, I’ve seen it happen a thousand times. Home improvement is rarely, if ever, a one-man job.”
There are coincidences and then there are coincidences, Dean, and that would be like…there aren’t words for it.”
Castiel looked unhappy, lips pursed in concern. “I just think…” His sentence trailed off uncertainly as they locked eyes, and his nostrils flared slightly as he scented the air around them.
There was too much packed in there to grasp in one go, so Dean latched onto the easiest part. “Can hardly call it
“In whatever disease sleep is laborious, it is a deadly symptom; but if sleep does good, it is not deadly.”
Amelia shook her head, sighing; one corner of her mouth quirked up with humor. “Something to be said for tradition,” she said, lightly teasing. “I know Castiel says he has no room for—what did he say? ‘Antiquated rituals based on archaic views about gender.’ Archaic or not, at least it clears up confusion. Hard to misread a courting gift.”
“Mmm, perhaps,” Castiel said, yawning around a smile. “Either that, or we were even more convincing than I thought. I admit, I was a little worried, though I didn’t want to say so, for fear of making you even more anxious and turning the whole evening into a giant mess of tangled nerves. You were already so tense.”
Which would make that “bestie” relationship a bit of an odd-couple pairing, but Meg was difficult to predict.
“Hey, maybe it was my fault,” Jimmy said, throwing up his hands. “If I’d checked Claire’s shoes before the trip, nobody would have been talking about going back to camp in the first place! Or, and here’s a thought, let’s just all agree that we’re glad Dean’s going to be fine, and also that our next big family trip is going to be on a cruise or something, where the biggest danger will be overindulgence at the buffet.”
“Also, your brother still thinks I’m working with you on your fitness level,” Castiel said with a leer.
Castiel snorted. “Maybe dinner first,” he teased gently, and Dean bit his lip as his cheeks bloomed red.
“I’ve given up on trying to guess when you two are joking or not,” Bobby now answered Sam. “Ever since the goat thing.”
Amelia nodded seriously, but Castiel was still feeling too restless to stay still and listen. “That’s fine, but we’re talking about a pup and someone who may be injured or ill. I’ve seen only three rangers. How can you find anyone in a park this size with so few of you?”
The party was, in fact, a much nicer one than he could have had if he’d hosted it back when he’d shown Sam around the place the first time. He’d been proud then, but now…
How could they get in? The door was locked, barred, and he hadn’t heard anything from that direction. Had he been so caught up in his own thoughts that he could have missed the sound of someone breaking it down?
In the act of grabbing Dean’s usual bottle, Balthazar hesitated. Glancing over his shoulder, he lifted an eyebrow. “Most?” he repeated.
Just to be on the safe side, before doing anything else, Dean lowered himself to the ground fully. Lying on his side, face to face with Castiel, he took a moment more to observe the fine spray of dark lashes fanning over cheekbones, the eternally chapped lips that were barely parted and relaxed, and the tiny cleft at the base of the shadowed chin. A twinge of regret accompanied the thought that he’d never really had the chance to just
Dean snickered. “Well, I bet it looked perfect by the third time, with all that practice.” Castiel made a face at him, leaning sideways so that he could knock his shoulder against Dean’s.
Castiel grunted, tapping the rim of his glass to signal for more. “Clash,” he muttered. “I have to wonder whether you’ve put your finger on it. There’s something very off about the whole situation, and it makes me wonder whether I’ve somehow offended them, and this is some sort of…” He grimaced, trailing off.
A hand was carefully touching his head, probing. “Think he hit his head?” Sam asked, and Castiel wanted to answer that no, he hadn’t, but he was still floating, spinning, and conversations was definitely going to have to be a problem for a later date.
"You don't have to come," Dean retorted. It would turn an insane plan into a suicidal one if he had to go alone, but determination was flooding his system. The idea of just letting go, turning a deaf ear to the messages being sent through the air, knowing that eventually they would simply stop coming—he couldn’t begin to consider it, even if the alternative was probably only slightly less deadly.
“Well, that’s good, because I’m not going to start calling you Castiel all the time!” said Dean. He was pretty sure that at some point this argument had gone off the rails a bit, but hell if he knew how to pull the brakes.
Here be smut. If that's not your bag, just skip over the section marked with ***** at the beginning and end (it's short), and you won't miss anything important to the plot.
“I…” No words seemed to want to come forth; Dean had no idea how to react to this type of situation. Did this even count as a “type of situation”? What the hell could be comparable to finding an actual
“Dude, you may be on the other side of the ocean right now, but I recognize a midwestern accent when I hear one,” Dean had laughed. “You can’t mock Americans when you apparently are one, or at least were at some point.”
Castiel shrugged. “I wouldn’t know, “ he replied. “Gabriel’s the only family member with whom I willingly interact. One brother is plenty, as far as I’m concerned, at least out of my current options. Your brother may irritate you when he becomes too intrusive, but you do seem to love each other regardless of that.”
Jody and Donna, sitting in the shade by the foot of the helicopter, laughed at the argument, looking as though neither of them had a care in the world. Castiel envied their relaxation, even if it was only partly genuine and part for show. A couple of the soldiers Naomi had brought in for the mission had openly questioned the abilities of the female Runners, though they’d given that a rest when Naomi had made some cutting remarks of her own. Castiel had no idea how those men had managed to retain their sexist biases in the face of all that had happened in the world, but he supposed that, despite what Dean had once told him, a zombie apocalypse didn’t necessarily have to change everyone.
Both men were frowning now, looking grim. “What do we do now?” said the second man, taller than the first. Taller…
Dean squatted down, resting his forearms on his knees and cradling his bruised hand in the other one, as he looked at Castiel and contemplated his next move. At least it appeared that he had been making some progress, having some effect on the status quo, since he’d begun this whole rescue mission. When Dean had been literally flung back into his own body, jerking and flailing as he abruptly woke with the hair-raising sense of plummeting from a great height, he’d thought that the almost imperceptible groaning was residual from the dream. It turned out to be coming from Castiel as he lay still and unmoving. The slight frown creasing his brow had definitely deepened, as well.
“That would imply that there’s a pole to climb,” Castiel called back. “We’re a smaller operation than that. Most of us can do most things, even if we’ve specialized in one trade area or another. For general renovation projects like this, the job falls to whomever is available. Gad, our master plumber, will hopefully be available to do the actual replumbing of this water line.”
“See, there’s another vote,” Meg drawled. “So, Krissy, would you call his jacket ‘distinguished’? Or maybe something else?”
“Ah, yes,” Castiel said. “It’s books.” Dropping his own box, he opened it; inside, there was a pile of new books, packed neatly and surrounded with pillow packs to protect the spines. “Every publisher wants to be on the list, you see, so they’ve already begun sending early copies of their writers’ works. I should warn you; last time around, the onslaught was…overwhelming.”
“So I don’t want to alarm you guys or anything, but I’m pretty sure the major knows you’re, ah, AWOL,” she said with a nervous giggle. “Kevin was going around looking for you, Dean, apparently. He said she sent him to get you, and when he couldn’t find you right away, she said to get Sam, and, well…” Dean could almost see her, tapping her foot anxiously as she tried to stay calm. “I can see you again now, and I hope you can hear me, though I guess I won’t know for sure until it doesn’t matter anymore. But, um, you might want to hurry. I mean, if you can. Hah. No idea how you people run like you do…”
“No, but you might want to consider it,” Castiel said, feigning seriousness. The teasing glint in his eye had finally returned. “It might be considered disrespectful to just throw it in the trash. You don’t want the animal to haunt this house, do you?” Dean threw him a middle finger as he turned and left to grab the shovel, but as he clomped down the stairs, he found himself laughing along with the sound of Castiel’s cackling from above.
By the time the group was loaded up with water and some protein bars, along with other hiking necessities, the sun was heating the canopy even more. Sweat beaded along hairlines, and Dean wrapped a cloth bandana around his forehead to keep the drops from rolling into his eyes. Sure enough, there were plenty of tiny insects flitting through the air, and all of the hikers were constantly waving hands in front of their faces to keep from accidentally inhaling any.
“I mean that his brother has the right of it, saying you shouldn’t be working with their crew, and your buddy Cas, here, should definitely have been aware of that. But looking at the frankly disturbing amount of unresolved sexual tension in these messages, it’s pretty clear why he chucked policy out the window. Damn,” she drawled.
“Oh! Yes. Certainly, you can go ahead and do that,” he said, nodding. Then, turning to the side, Castiel began carefully winding the cord attached to the saw around its handle.
Dean frowned in confusion, giving up on grabbing and trying instead to peer over her shoulder to see which texts she was reading. “What’s that supposed to mean?” he asked.
The suit-wearing angel had told the Cupid that Castiel was “up there” with Naomi, so that must mean an upper level of some kind. Dean retraced his steps until he found one of the upward slopes he’d passed in his search. He kept climbing, on and on, making plans as he walked. Unfortunately, Castiel had always been a little vague on the details of how Naomi had done her little indoctrination acts, and his reluctance to share had been ominous in itself. Now Dean wished he’d pushed a little harder.
“Because it’s—” Naomi snapped, cutting him short, then clamped her lips together tightly. She breathed slowly for a minute, pressing a hand over her eyes. “Because the man in the recording…I knew him. I know the song, rather, and I knew Alfie, and the odds of this happening are so unbelievably unlikely as to resurrect my dead and rotting belief in a higher power, a malicious one with a vendetta against me personally.” Her hand trembled and her voice shook. Dean waited, not having the first clue what to say. Finally, Naomi removed her hand, revealing reddened eyes that looked much older than they had when Dean had walked into the room.
plan, when you did as much planning as I did.” That fact stood out much more starkly in hindsight, and Dean wondered why he hadn’t questioned it more in the first place. “And it wasn’t so ridiculous after all. It actually worked, didn’t it?”
“Fair point,” Dean conceded. “But I’ve done crazy shit before, and this could actually be worth it. Castiel, what if we could find something that really explained how all this started, what happened to turn regular human beings into flesh-eating monsters? What if there’s formulas, and documentation, and we could study it all and maybe even figure out how to make it stop spreading? Whatever your dad gave you, whatever he was trying to give your mom and himself before it was too late—think about it. If Sam and I and all the other Runners had that kind of protection, or if we could figure out how to make it safe for wider use, we could finally get ahead of this thing instead of running around putting out little fires all the time.”
“Do we really need to place blame here?” Jimmy interjected. “I mean, other than on the actual spider? Who, I might add, was just doing what spiders do, so maybe even he deserves some slack. This whole thing was just a big mess of unfortunate bad luck.”
“Oh, my God, you have no idea,” Castiel murmured, lips tremulous. “Dean, I have to tell you—I don’t think you truly realize. In the past forty-eight hours or so, I have gone from having almost no reason to keep going to feeling like…like I
“…and there the guy is, waving a goddamn halberd around, naked as the day he was born! I swear to God, I almost pissed myself!” The entire group sitting around the lunch table roared with laughter, grabbing each other’s shoulders for support and wiping tears from their eyes. Donna, her blond ponytail whipping from side to side as she embellished her recount with hand gestures and dramatic reenactments, put one hand on her chest and lifted the other in a parody of a solemn vow. “Strike me down for a liar, I thought I was gonna have to joust him or something. Luckily, he was so drunk, he wound up tripping over his own weapon and falling on his face.”
And Dean wasn’t even going to touch on the one time when the guy had talked about the last serious relationship he’d had, back in college. The guy was either completely shameless, or else his candor was born from the belief that nobody was actually alive to hear him; either way, he had Dean blushing to the roots of his hair when he described the particular physical aspects of human contact that he missed most. Damn.
During the time Dean had been speaking, Castiel’s shivering had eased a fraction. He still had his hair gripped and twisted between his chilled fingers, but some of the panic had faded from his face. Standing there now, he looked somewhat nonplussed on top of the brittle anxiety that was still glaringly obvious in every tensed muscle of his body. “I don’t understand what’s happening,” he said, his gravelly voice even rougher than usual. He sounded utterly wretched, ready to shatter. “I can…I can
Dean felt Castiel relax slightly, and he realized Castiel hadn’t really been confident about what his sister would choose to do. Not that Dean would have let her take Castiel away against his will, but he felt relief that this, at least, wouldn’t have to be a fight. “So you’ll stay in New Lebanon?” he asked, hoping.
Dean smirked, knowing Sam couldn’t see his face. “Aw, you’ll hurt their feelings.” He held his hands over his head, just in case he miscalculated the tunnel height, and headed off into even deeper darkness. Charlie’s reassuring presence in their ears, already taxed to its limits by the distance, had been cut off completely by the earth over their heads, and the comparative silence was all the more startling for the loss.
“So, you believe me now?” Dean asked. When Castiel looked at him questioningly, he clarified, “That this is all real, not a massive hallucination?”
Meg laughed lightly. “Oh, you know me, Professor. I know better than to get involved in my boss’s personal life.” At Dean’s incredulous noise and accusingly pointed finger, she just laughed harder and harder, until finally Mrs. Tran left her desk in the Dean’s office and stomped down the hall to see what the noise was all about.
Kevin’s face looked like he’d won the lottery. “No problem,” he quickly said. “Oh, and by the way, I think you have some drywall in your hair.”
“Mmm,” Dean said. He’d grabbed his beer bottle from the table and was humming appreciation of it as he drank. Waving a hand in a circle, he urged Castiel on. “Go ahead and tear into it for me,” he said. “Want to finish my beer, here.”
“Stupid bugs,” he muttered after a while, when the burning in his leg started pulsing with his heartbeat again. “Stupid bugs with their stupid bites.” Dean still had no idea what on earth could have happened. As far as he knew, he wasn’t allergic to bees or anything like that, and even though he’d only seen allergic reactions to stings in movies or on TV, he was pretty sure that trouble breathing was a thing with those. The rash and swelling of his leg, the horrifying lump he’d felt in that awful moment of discovery, and the fever Claire had actually diagnosed with impressive accuracy for a preschooler—these were more like a spreading poison.
“...nineteen, twenty,” he finished under his breath. Reaching over his head, he fumbled, looking for the concealed switch that would disable the alarm at the door. Setting off that alarm would do way more than just trigger a blaring signal throughout the bunker, and Dean was singularly uninterested in experiencing the electric shock that would have also awaited him when he touched the door.
“I wasn’t going to say that,” Sam said. His eyes were wide and full of something Dean couldn’t read and felt reluctant about trying. “From what you’ve told me, this guy has been basically screaming into a void, or thought he was, for months at minimum. He was probably showing more of himself than most people show to people they see every day, just because he felt like he could, that he had no reason
And the fact that it was now serving as the setting for Castiel’s latest dream? Based on what he’d witnessed so far about the way Castiel’s dreams worked, there was really only one logical possibility for what he was about to walk into. The only question remaining was whether or not the hell-based hallucinations would be visible and deadly to Dean, or if it was “only” going to be angels and demons trying to kill him while he tried to talk an insane angel into going along with the crazy idea that none of what he was seeing was really happening.
“I’ll stay with you,” Castiel corrected, smiling faintly. “Though I think, after today, I’d like a break from running. Perhaps your greenhouses could use an apiary? I haven’t heard about zombie bees. It would be a refreshing change.”
Sam grunted, leaning forward a moment as he almost stumbled under the shifting weight. “Stop moving, Claire,” he hissed, adjusting his grip under her legs where they wrapped around his waist from behind. “If I trip and sprain an ankle, we’re both screwed. Hey, Dean, could you…?” He stopped trudging and turned, exaggeratedly jerking his head to the side in an attempt to throw his sweaty hair out of his eyes.
“Smaller than the likelihood of finding a survivor hanging out in one of Dad’s old hideaway spots, I can tell you that much,” Dean replied.
“Anyway,” Castiel continued, “None of it’s important anymore. There’s absolutely nothing we can do, and there’s no way to prove any of this. Dad’s dead, Benton probably is, and they took their secrets with them, other than a roll of needles we can’t analyze without different tech, some flash drives we can’t break into, and a notebook full of what might as well be Sudoku solutions. And me, but I’m useless, too, because the doctor says I used up too much of the magic juice in not dying, and now I’m just an ordinary person again.”
“Hey, Deanie-Weenie!” came a shout from the second story, as if on cue. “I like the look of this bathroom! Not bad at all!” Exchanging a look of shared trepidation, Dean and Castiel broke apart so they could head up the stairs. Dean flexed his hand at his side, remembering just how amazingly sculpted Castiel’s shoulder had felt in his grip. However much muscle was easily visible in those powerful arms, he must have been hiding just as much under his clothes.
“Okay, what am I walking into here?” said Castiel, stumbling over to the rock and dropping onto the warm surface. “Amelia, you wouldn’t be interrogating Dean, would you? It feels more like a deposition than a vacation over here.”
“But what about when you finish up with this job? We just…” Dean hesitated, remembering how awful he’d felt about even the idea of letting Sam comfort him through a breakup that wasn’t real.
He shivered, sure that those echoes would be there with him long after the other details of this run had faded from recollection.
Conversation drifted idly, covering rumors and stories anybody had heard about happenings in the world outside. New Lebanon wasn’t the only little island of civilization struggling to survive in a world overrun by the undead, though contact between them ranged from strained but courteous to openly hostile. Mostly what there was was speculation. Someone had heard from someone else who had a cousin up in Hastings Settlement, who was sure the Canadians had managed to build up a force of Mounties again, bringing down hordes on horseback. Another woman had seen a helicopter flying overhead from the south, sporting colors that didn’t look like US military. One guy reported having witnessed Major Novak actually, unbelievably, wearing something close to a smile when she’d arrived back at camp the night before, just choppered in from her most recent briefing at Offutt, which had to mean that the Powers That Be had found a way to put the country back together again.
Sam’s brow furrowed as he shook his head in disagreement. “Stop trying to turn your past mistakes into some kind of self-fulfilling prophecy,” he said. “For one thing, relationships are two-sided, and you need to ditch the idea that all your bad breakups were entirely on you. But here’s the thing: if I was going to pick out one damaging thing that you really have had a pattern of repeating, it would be how resistant you can get about refusing to admit you’ve made mistakes until it’s too late to fix them.”
“Hmmm.” Balthazar drummed his fingers along the bartop pensively. “Perhaps, Cassie dear, it’s time to remedy that.”
Sitting across from him, Castiel stuck out a foot to nudge roughly at Dean’s ankle. “I just don’t understand how you’ve let it go on this long! It’s been over a month! How often do you and Sam talk to each other?”
“Here,” Dean said, grabbing for a glass of water on the table by Castiel’s bed. “Tessa—that’s the doc—says you can sit up and move now, so long as you take it easy. Nothing busted, but you strained the hell out of some ligaments and stuff. Here, let me help you sit up so you can drink this.” Between the two of them, they managed to maneuver him into a semi-upright position against a pile of pillows; his ribs screamed when he tried to sit fully upright.
“Dean, what is going on?” Castiel murmured. “Real, not real, dream, delirium—are we, or are we not, in actual danger?”
“Look, I’m fine,” he addressed the whole group, more quietly. “I don’t want to ruin the day, here. Maybe it’s better if I head back now, anyway. I’m probably a little dehydrated or something. Getting kind of a headache.” That was a large understatement, but definitely not a lie. “Claire and I can go back down the hill, drink some water, and maybe even get some lunch ready for you guys for when you get back. Okay?” An awkward silence passed, as Amelia and Jimmy seemed unsure about how to avoid taking sides, and Castiel just looked purely wounded. Dean sighed. “Cas.”
Gabriel nodded. “Yeah, I see now,” he said. “Actually, it kind of looks more like an upward splatter that spread, you know? Kind of makes you wonder. Really gets the imagination going, doesn’t it? Like those stains on the carpet over there. Wouldn’t want to take a blacklight to this room.” He winked again, traipsing through the doorway toward the kitchen.
“You think I don’t know your name? I’ve been all through Castiel’s meager little thoughts and memories, you know. I’ll call you what I like. Right now, I’ll call you stupid. Trying to wake a dreaming angel, especially here, is a bit more complicated, and a lot more deadly, than you seem to expect.” Flashes of teeth too sharp to be human showed between its lips as it smirked.
Fidgeting and toying with the other objects on the table, Dean looked chagrined at being called out. “Well, you were banged up, man. Not like I was going to get much sleep back in my bunk, anyway. After that horse race, I was too wired to rest much. Figured I’d keep an eye on you for the doc, let her get a little shut-eye.” He gave Castiel a crooked grin and a wink that didn’t come off quite as self-assured as he’d likely meant it to.
“Gabriel,” Castiel growled, reaching them in time to witness the lewd introduction. “Dean, I apologize. This is my brother, a true testament to the sad unpredictability of genetics.”
“Huh,” Dean considered. In a way, he could see it; the time he spent with Castiel, no matter what they were doing, always left him feeling like he’d taken off a mask. He didn’t have to be the polished academic, or the caretaker mother-hen archetype, or even the goofy bachelor with a wisecrack always at the ready. He could be all those things, all at once, as well as all the other sides of himself that he kept hidden and protected from judging eyes. Castiel saw right through him, refusing to let him hide. Dean wondered whether there was another person on earth for whom he didn’t have to play a role, and who wouldn’t even have let him get away with trying.
“I believe those are probably work horses,” Castiel told Dean. “They’re very even-tempered and docile. If you’re nervous about riding, you should consider one of them for yourself, too.”
“All right, think,” he said out loud. “What’s the real goal here? We’re not trying to find a path out of Purgatory this time. We only need to survive long enough for you to come to terms with the situation enough to be able to end the dream. How am I supposed to keep us alive in the meantime without even a weapon, though?” Dean didn’t even have the basic knife he’d started with the first time he’d been to Purgatory; with that, he’d been able to kill one of the monsters and loot its corpse for a weapon better suited to this place. “Shit, if only I still had that blade I took from here…”
“Bet you’re out of luck there,” Dean said wryly. “I know if I was trapped here, that’d probably be the first thing I’d go for, devout or not.”
be a good thing. Shit.” Dean only had internet stories to back him up on this sort of thing, but it didn’t take a construction expert to know that “cracked foundation” sounded…bad. Very, very bad. And expensive. And decidedly, completely,
“Why won’t anyone listen to me?” he begged, but it was like talking to a horde of zombies, single-mindedly focused on getting him out the door. “What about you, Dad? Why can’t you take him the bag, if it’s so important?”
“I truly hope so,” Castiel said, helping Dean climb into the passenger seat without jarring his injury.
They glared at each other in silence, chests heaving in frustration. It was the weirdest, most confusing fight Dean could remember, and as his irritation ebbed, it was replaced with an empty sort of disorientation. “So I take it you’d be happy if I called him up right now and told him the truth,” Dean said, trying to rally some of the fire he’d been feeling. It came out sounding a lot weaker than he wanted.
want? Not that he’d ever given his location, but surely it was foreseeable that there would be those who knew how to track a transmitter and find the source.
“Brothers,” Dean said, shaking his head in fervent commiseration. “Let’s never let yours meet mine. Deal?”
“Uncle Dean is hurt!” Claire screamed, suddenly sharply intelligible, and Dean wondered why she was trying to tell him something he so obviously knew. Confused, he squinted, rolling his head to the side in the mud to try to get a better view of her up above. Her back was turned to him, and she was waving frantically at…something.
Dean thought. On the heels of that, he changed his mind; Castiel in full righteous fury was apparently striking all kinds of right notes in Dean’s psyche and beginning to make things a bit uncomfortable for him in the pants region.
“Go get ‘im,” Jo goaded, and Charlie sprawled across the table to offer Castiel a high-five. He nearly missed, having already downed several drinks beyond his usual Friday night Roadhouse intake. Dean lifted a brow in Jo’s direction and tried to subtly signal her to bring the check, but she was enjoying the diatribe too much to pay him any attention.
“Sure, Bobby,” Sam said, amusement thick in his tone. “Hey, who was it that made the little brass bell collar for Annette?”
“Are you actively disclosing that you’ve been breaking protocol, misusing issued equipment in a way explicitly prohibited in the regulations, and putting yourself and your fellow Runners’ safety in jeopardy?” Naomi’s eyes glinted dangerously as she leaned forward, bracing her forearms on the desk.
Reaching across the counter, Sam punched Dean on the shoulder. “You and Cas, too. I don’t know if you can see what the rest of us see, but it’s so obvious. He’s been really good for you.”
Nodding, Castiel replied absently. “Dean and I will be going up the Thursday before. He hates flying, so we’ll drive out early.” Suddenly, he knew, with blinding clarity, exactly how he was going to show Dean how grateful he was, how much he loved him. This year had been intense, but Dean was
“You assume correctly. And, I should tell you, I have no idea how this is going to play out. Simplest result is that we prove for certain it’s a recording somehow, but I have no idea how that would happen. Find the radio? I dunno. Most complicated, we find out there’s a guy out there somewhere in the area, surrounded by zoms, and then I have to convince the major not to haul me in front of a firing squad for disobeying her orders, and also to send somebody to save his ass.” Dean ticked off the possibilities on his fingers as he listed them.
Dean huffed a laugh, and they watched the brothers some more. Jimmy had tried to swim under the water and dunk Castiel, and now an all-out war was being waged. Jimmy barely managed to get his head above water and, flailing, call out to Amelia for help before Castiel submerged them both once more. Amelia just rolled her eyes fondly.
low price and an expedited sales process, you are agreeing to assume responsibility for any defects or necessary repairs, whether or not you’ve noted them before signing?”
Four hundred feet should have taken no time at all to cross, but the group moved at a snail’s pace, pairs walking shoulder-to-shoulder as they flashed their lights into every shadow they could. Naomi was at the front of the group, so she was the one to make the first grisly discovery, about a hundred yards in. She inhaled sharply, stopping so suddenly that Jody almost bumped into her.
The library might have closed, but that did not, apparently, mean that the librarians weren’t still working. With the whole town—the whole county, the whole state—trapped at home, Castiel and the rest of the library staff had been tasked with doing everything they could to provide their services digitally instead of in-person. E-book and audiobook streaming services were one obvious solution, and the Ask-a-Librarian email service was seeing traffic that was unheard of before now. The social purpose of the library, though, had to find other ways to transform itself.
“They’ve only been officially dating for, what, a month?” said Gabriel, crossing his arms and looking uncharacteristically bewildered.
The mommy crowd has their sights set on you now, I’m afraid. Next, it’ll be flung undergarments and hiding themselves in your backstage dressing room.”
To Sam's credit, he was giving the battle everything he had. He was working the puppy dog eyes, somehow managing to duck his head and look humble while simultaneously maintaining a perfectly respectful military posture. He argued like a lawyer, not a scrapper, and maybe if there had been an impartial judge choosing between Sam and Naomi, there might have been a chance for success. As things stood, though, Dean could see the handwriting on the wall almost from the beginning.
about you, and I just don’t want you to do that thing where you dig in your heels and refuse to admit when you’ve made a mistake until you’re in way over your head. It’s okay to ask for help. And I really, really think this is a situation that calls for it.”
With an indulgent sigh, Castiel slipped a finger under the taped flaps on the ends of the box, neatly flipping them up so as not to tear the gift wrap. Dean rolled his eyes in fond exasperation at the methodical approach, but he kept quiet and didn’t interrupt. When the box was unwrapped, Castiel looked back at Dean, checking for permission once again, and Dean simply nodded. Castiel lifted the lid to look inside, then almost fumbled and dropped the whole thing in surprise.
“Possibly. There’s probably much more here than I can see with untrained eyes, but I’m sure the experts will be eager to go through it all. They’ll want to examine you, too, Castiel.”
Reluctantly, Dean pushed himself to his feet, wincing as his hand bumped against his stomach. “Fine,” he said. “But you’re coming into the waiting area to keep me company. Deal?”
“Not to mention the potential splinters, which we probably should have considered,” Castiel replied in a voice muffled against Dean’s ankle. “I’m afraid OSHA didn’t write standards for this, but if they had, we’d be in strong violation.”
The clinking of fingernails on crystal pulled Sam’s attention to where Billie was leaning against the wall beside the bar cart. In the torturous stretch of time during which Sam and Jack had been biting their nails and worrying incessantly, Billie had been steadily working her way through nearly the entire store of wine stocked in the bunker. I guess her liver must be about as resistant to damage as the old Death’s arteries were, Sam mused darkly. Good thing she’s not a beer drinker, or Dean would be really pissed off when he finally gets back.
It was a hair-raising few minutes later that they all crouched inside the gloomy waiting room of the clinic, backs to the wall beneath windows that provided only faint traces of light, leaving most of the room in ominous shadows. The hallways branching out on the far side of the room were pitch-black, though definitely not uninhabited.
“Ha! I knew he wasn’t always as radical as he insists!” Amelia hissed happily, pumping her fist. “And the flowers? Oh, but don’t tell me. He’s probably more of a potted plant than a bouquet giver. I’ve seen his garden.”
“Yeah, okay. I’ll try.” Dean drained his beer with a long gulp. “Can sharing and caring time be over now?”
“Well, it was,” Castiel managed, caught between hysterical laughter and sobbing. “I died, though, right? Or I’m dying now, and you’re my…my hallucination?” Nothing made sense, but, then again, everything did. He must have been shot, or maybe the whole intruder scenario had been one large hallucination and he was dying from some other means.
Already on his way out the door, Dean paused.  “Dude, I was just going to throw it in the garbage,” he said. “Am I not allowed to do that? Is there a health code thing?”
Castiel swallowed visibly and nodded. Moving nearly as gingerly as Dean had, he hoisted the saw, pulled the trigger switch to start the blade spinning, and lowered it to the wood. He didn’t seem to even be breathing, lips peeled back around clenched teeth as the saw cut away a much larger section of floor to reveal the space beneath. Then they both slowly leaned in to see finally what had been lying buried there in the darkness.
“Gabriel really did upset you, didn’t he?” he asked Dean. Without waiting for an answer, he rose to his feet and faced Dean fully. “If it will help, I will make it crystal clear to him that his crudeness today could have lost us this contract. He needs to understand that he didn’t just ‘lighten the mood.’ He made you uncomfortable, which is simply not acceptable.” Castiel appeared physically pained, far more deeply than Dean thought was warranted over a few teasing cracks and a little familial bickering in public.
“So did you go to Leavenworth after that?” he asked. Glancing at the bag sitting in the corner, he figured he already knew.
“Here, take these,” Sam said, thrusting a couple of tanks into Dean’s arms. The liquid inside sloshed, and Dean hummed appreciatively at the weight of them. His arms would be screaming by the time they got back, but fuel was worth its weight in gold. More than that, truthfully.
Dean gave her a dirty look, but his phone buzzed again in his hand before he could come up with a biting response.
Dean just narrowed his eyes, refraining from commenting on the obvious. “Horrible” didn’t really describe the moments following that bombshell of a revelation. He couldn’t recall exactly what he’d manage to stammer out, but he’d never forget the look of utter devastation on Naomi’s face as he’d fled.
your inspection appointment somehow slipped off the schedule, leaving nothing to be done but to either cancel at the last minute, or else…” He spread his arms to his sides in a gesture of haggard defeat.
“Oh, ho!” The Cupid didn’t seem at all worried about being overheard. “Well, that would work, too. Naomi’s tutelage always does the trick. I mean, just look at Castiel! Even if he has needed a few repeat lessons, he’s certainly proof of her skills with stubborn cases. You should have seen him after…which plague was it? The one on Jehoram, I think? Anyway, night and day difference, once she was done.”
Dean frowned, glancing at the bag and then back at Castiel. He slid his legs off the edge of the bed, standing and crossing the room hesitantly. Something about this had him wondering whether he was about to find a severed hand, a million dollars, or a ticking time bomb. Dean slid open the zipper carefully and peeked inside. It was all as Castiel had described, with the addition of a roll of heavy-duty black nylon, secured with a buckle. Looking back at Castiel, he cautiously lifted the roll and brought it back to the bed before unfastening the buckle and unrolling it. Inside, it was lined with small clear pockets, each of which held a hypodermic needle filled with a yellowish fluid.
It was getting impossible to keep up with the alerts, and from what he was able to gather from some of the messages, only a fraction were getting through, anyway. He tried to call the first friend on his contact list, more out of curiosity about whether it would work than out of any particular concern for them specifically, but there was only a recording telling him that all circuits were busy. If any officers from training were attempting to reach him and press him into emergency service in some way, he was pretty sure they’d have a fun time trying.
“Nanette,” Bobby corrected automatically, then blustered when the brothers burst into laughter. “It’s a joke! Because she’s a nanny goat, and…aw, damn it! I should just let that group of zombies about thirty degrees to your northeast have your sorry asses.”
“Think I owe you more than one dinner for this,” he deflected, then shook his head at himself. He couldn’t bring himself to shove the feelings down any more, whether he should or not. “I wish I could, you know. Buy you dinner. Take you out and…and really show you how much I…appreciate this. You.”
“You think Fate works like that, then?” Dean asked. Ahead of them, the mists swirled around the entrance to a small copse of trees, and he realized he was trying to see shapes in the haze.
“Oh, great. She really is a one-trick pony, isn’t she? Always about twisting your head around and making you see things.” Dean used his flannel to wipe blood from his hands, then pulled it off to wipe some of the blood from Castiel’s face. Luckily, the gaping wounds already seemed to be shrinking, now that the needles were out, though the healing was much slower than Dean had seen it before. He wondered whether that was a factor of grace dreaming or if those needles had been designed to work that way in the real world. “Cas, I’m not one of her visions. I’m really real, and I’m really here. Look, here.” He took Castiel’s hand, firmly resisting attempts to pull away, and placed it on his own chest. “Flesh and blood Dean Winchester, see?”
“So not only have you kept up this charade through dozens of perfectly good opportunities to put an end to it, you’ve probably had to tell other lies based on the first one in order to keep it going. You gave him my
Within twenty minutes, they’d neatly cut away a rectangle of damaged wood, leaving a clean hole about a foot in length looking down into the shadows between the supporting floor joists and beneath. “I should put a trap door there,” Dean joked. “Couldn’t trap more than Sam’s foot and ankle, but it’d still be funny. Little tiny rug covering it—”
“Condolences,” Linda said with a smirk. She’d done a stint on a Young Adult book committee once and had sworn off all such committee work ever since. “Don’t suppose any of the books you got were bright yellow? We still need the star, and not many book covers are the right color.”
“I get that,” Dean said, immediately seizing his opportunity. “That’s actually kind of where I’ve been, too. Guess I finally got tired of it, though. What’s the point of working so hard to build a nest egg if you never get around to making a nest, you know?”
“And that was a year and a half ago,” Dean said unnecessarily, still trying to reconcile the fact with everything he knew to be true. “You think your dad and this Benton guy made a vaccine to fight a zombie plague?”
The dimensions of Castiel’s dreamscape shifted yet again in Dean’s considerations, as he puzzled out how to situate himself in time as well as space.
Dean nodded. “Yeah, that’s the hitch. She likes you better than me, though, so maybe you should be the one to try.”
“Castiel was interested in the wellness programs at the center, and I told him you helped as a volunteer,” she said smugly. “He just wanted to know what sort of activities you helped with. I didn’t know it was a secret.”
Sighing, Dean turned back. “You always said I was an angry sleeper, but, man, I guess we’re going to have something to discuss when we get you back. I don’t think you have any room to talk. Not anymore.” Dean grimaced, rolled his shoulders, and dropped back to the ground. “Third time’s the charm? Jesus, don’t you ever have dreams about flying through pink clouds, or talking to fish, or anything soft and fluffy like that? Poor bastard. What other fun times you got going on in there to show me?”
“Okay, first, you are the furthest thing from ordinary,” Dean said, bending forward to brush Castiel’s lips with his own. Castiel sighed into the kiss, protesting a little when Dean sat back up, but Dean kept him from chasing after another with a gentle but firm hand against his chest. “Second, don’t write off Charlie yet. She’s like a pit bull with things like this, and she’s not close to waving a white flag. Sam’s over there now with coffee for her, since he knows better than to try to get her to take a break before she’s good and ready.”
Castiel gave him a suspicious glare, made less threatening by the weariness in his face. “You’re not suggesting I engage my new neighbor in some sort of war, are you?”
A sudden voice clearing from the doorway startled them. Dean’s head shot upward, resulting in an unfortunate collision with Castiel’s chin as Castiel ducked his own head. Their consequential groans were of an entirely different timbre than the ones they’d been making only moments before, and Tessa covered her mouth with her hand to hide her smile.
“And there…and now there,” Miss Talbot finished, sounding more and more like the cat who’d gotten the canary with every signature. Another fleeting thought crossed Dean’s mind that perhaps she sounded a bit too pleased, all things considered; maybe the market was slower than he’d thought, if she was getting this excited over a short sale. Then again, she wasn’t going to have to split the fees with anyone else, since he hadn’t brought in an agent of his own, so that probably explained the gleam of anticipation in her eye. His younger brother had lectured him for that choice, too, but
Castiel was alone when Dean found him. He was lying rigidly on his back, staring up at the ceiling with blank eyes. Dean couldn’t decide if that was any better than finding him curled up in a corner, cringing from shadows, since at least he had seemed somewhat communicative when he’d been that way in real life.
Near the center of the room, the pet stink grew steadily stronger. Breathing through his mouth and working as quickly as he could, Dean was caught off guard when the carpet suddenly decided to cooperate with the mission, a large section pulling free easily as the pocket knife scored a seam. “The hell?” Dean said, frowning. Better not to look a gift horse in the mouth, he decided. All the better to get the worst of the odor out of the house and start to clear the air, and, hey, he was due for
“Dean, don’t you remember when I started dating Eileen? You gave me such shit for not telling you about her until things were serious. If I remember correctly, you accused me of compartmentalizing?”
“But that’s the fun part,” Castiel said. “Pass me that nail gun, please.” He took the tool from Dean’s hand and crouched by the bottom of the wall. Dean watched him fire nails through the boards into the studs beyond, contemplating. The parts of his brain prone to negative thinking were muttering that Castiel’s casual dismissal was further evidence that he didn’t plan to be around long enough to worry about Dean’s home decorating woes.
It didn’t hurt any less the more he had to say it, and having to say it to Castiel himself was so much worse than the other times. The redness had nearly faded from his eyes now, so the bright blue irises seemed that much captivating as they widened with shock.
“Tell me something I don’t know. And also, you’re not even supposed to know about any of this, so shut up.”
“No, no, the house itself is fine,” Castiel said, squeezing his eyes shut and waving a hand. “I just didn’t anticipate the sort of neighbor I’d be getting. When I visited the place before I signed the lease, the other half of the townhouse might as well have been unoccupied, other than for the tools and things in their half of the garage. I suppose it’s my fault for not visiting at the
“Okay, okay,” Dean said in a rush, trying not to combust. “But just because we’re crazy about each other right now doesn’t mean I won’t find a way to mess it all up in the future. You
“Next time you decide you want to go chasing will-o-wisps out in the woods, boy, you best remember who it was who tanned your hide when you were a boy and ran off and got lost. Your daddy wasn’t the only one who knew how to follow a trail, and if I have to hunt you down and put the fear of God in you again, don’t think I won’t.”
“Well, I don’t think we need to be making towers of the books, anyway,” Castiel chided, stooping to gather up the mess. “Which one of you is Zephyr, again?”
Castiel watched the brothers talk, fascinated by the way they communicated with each other. It had been far too long since he’d watched or participated in an actual conversation, and he found himself entranced, even knowing that it was all likely happening inside some misfiring part of his traumatized brain.
“Definitely,” Castiel said. “Of course, a project of that breadth would definitely benefit from first-hand observation and study. You’d never get away with publishing a book on Lord Derwentwater without visiting Dilston Castle. Ideally, you’d time your visit to see the Northern Lights glowing, the way they shone on the night he was beheaded.”
It was either a mark of the trust built over their long friendship, or else a sign of severe sleep deprivation, but either way, it was a pleasant surprise how little argument Castiel put up, compared to past situations, when confronted with this sound reasoning.
Dean’s eyes drifted away from the antics in front of him (Jimmy had risen up from underneath Castiel, lifting him onto his shoulders before tossing him through the air to land with a splash) to note how Amelia was toying with a gold bracelet on her wrist. “That how he let you know he was interested?” he asked. “Jewelry?”
Claire unscrewed the cap and offered it to him, then watched as he splashed some of the water into his parched mouth. “Your face is very red,” she commented.
“By weapon, you mean the halberd, right?” Meg cut in, eyes glinting with mischief. “Or do I need to take a trip down to the infirmary and see for myself what kind of dude can trip himself on his own—” Hilarity erupted again, drawing curious attention from other groups seated at long tables around the large room.
He sighed, cloaking it at the last minute as a melodramatic groan of surrender. “Fine, we’ll see,” he said, rolling his eyes at Eileen’s pumped fist. “But we’re pretty busy with the home stuff, so don’t go thinking we’ll be there anytime soon.”
Sam grimaced as he took his bottle from Dean and cracked it open. “I had to wear the ones that pinch. It sucked.”
Charlie’s mic crackled. “I can see that you guys have stopped moving, and I really, really hope it’s so you can retie your shoes or something. God, this is nerve-wracking.” Dean and Sam exchanged a glance, then broke into laughter as the tension of the fight dissipated.
Catching his breath, feeling his heart race with the sudden surge of unexpected emotions that had swept through him, Dean suddenly noticed that Naomi’s face had paled. Her eyes were wide, and her mouth had dropped open slightly. He wondered if he’d really gone and crossed the line; maybe shouting at an officer was the sort of thing that got you thrown into whatever makeshift jail they might now need to construct.
“I dunno. Think I see plenty of my type here,” Dean replied, throwing a wink at a brunette woman who was leaning back on her elbows against the bar. She rolled her eyes at him as she smiled sardonically. Dean couldn’t quite remember her name, but he could recall well the evening they’d enjoyed together not long after she’d arrived at camp. Neither of them had wanted any more than that, but it was definitely a good memory.
Dean scooped up the cell phone he’d left sitting on the desk with the rest of his personal things. Sure enough, there was a series of messages from Sam. His mouth twisted unhappily as he read them.
Castiel stared, bewildered, as the fairy children swarmed over to Charlie, squealing and chittering in joy. “She’s actually giving them sugar,” he muttered. “Is she insane?”
“She was a good warrior before she chose to fall,” said the other angel. “Killing her would be a waste. I heard…” He paused, looking around before continuing in a quiet voice that Dean had to struggle to catch. “I heard that Naomi was asking about her.”
One small detail gave him any proof at all that he hadn’t created the whole scenario in his own head. When Dean shouted, the stretch of his cheeks around his open mouth sent a sharp sting along one cheek. He touched it with his fingers, and they came away wet with a small smear of blood.
“Castiel.” Dean interrupted him with a finger placed over his lips. “It’s not about the key, you big dork. It’s about you using it to come home at night. To
“Oh, I’m the—what did you call me?” Dean’s return volley nearly got sidetracked by his confusion, but he quickly regained his stride. “I’m not the one who started this! You’re the guy who moved in and started throwing all those weird rap-polka parties every night!”
Dean forced himself to take a deep, steadying breath, attempting to pull himself together for Castiel’s sake. “I am not making you leave,” he promised softly, meeting Castiel’s eyes as well as he could. “I know what I did then, and I wish so badly that I could go back and change it. But this is only a memory, Cas, not the real thing. And I hate myself so damn much for letting you have memories like this—like the asylum, like all the tortures you’ve gone through because you chose us—chose
“That’s still pretty amazing,” Sam said. “I guess I was wrong when I told Dean that it was unrealistic to just jump into something like that without professional assistance.”
“It’s fine,” Castiel said with a smile. “I like it a lot better than some of the sobriquets my brother prefers. He’s a nickname man, too, though much less apologetically. But…the floor.” He walked over to the damaged corner and knelt to touch it. “All right, that’s honestly not terrible. Looks like the subfloor has a bit of damage here, too, but that’s like patching drywall. Once you fix those spots and refinish the whole thing, you may not even be able to tell which boards have been replaced.”
No, Castiel was not. There were too many conflicting images in his head, and he couldn’t make sense out of anything. On top of everything, now, his head was beginning to fill with an odd haze, like a fog settling over everything and making the whole world seem strangely insubstantial.
Making their way through the woods at a light jog felt like any other day of work for the Runners; it was almost familiar enough to allow them to forget that they weren’t just out on an ordinary run for mundane supplies. Meg was actually humming quietly to herself, some rock song with a repetitive drum part that she kept emphasizing with clicks of her tongue. Dean caught her eye, and she grinned, making it obvious that her aim was to irritate the sergeant trotting in front of her. Dean rolled his eyes at her, but he decided to let her have her fun. Jody and Donna were running well ahead of the group, knees high and feet light as they avoided obstacles buried in leaves. A few of the uniformed soldiers were watching them in admiration.
Of course he’d be prepared to work without resorting to using random objects to break things. Castiel chuckled, causing Dean to flush even more deeply, before adding, “Your way does sound more cathartic, though, I must admit.”
Another engine noise, closer this time, pulled his attention back toward the open front door. Outside, a big white conversion van was easing up to park along the curb. Even in the dark, the bright golden wings of the Deus Ex logo painted on the side seemed to glow ostentatiously. Dean winced, hurrying through the door and out onto the porch, just as a man threw open the driver’s side door and slid out of the van.
“Most of the seniors at our center just want to be able to move and be active without pain,” Eileen agreed. “Even the ones in wheelchairs are happier when they can be as mobile as possible and participate in activities around them.”
Castiel’s tears were contagious, apparently, because Dean’s eyes had begun watering sympathetically. Blinking away the evidence, he cleared the tightness from his throat. “Guess it’s a triple celebration,” he said to the crowd. “Cas just said he’d move in with me.”
He stopped in the middle of his sentence when his vision cleared and he was able to see the hard truth: he was the only one awake. Nothing seemed to have changed at all since he’d last been in this position. Castiel was still sprawled carelessly on his stomach, all his joints loose and bent oddly.
“Well, it turns out that while he was away at college, the kid turned into even more of a morning person, and he likes to exercise at the crack of dawn, like a crazy person. And he’s one of those people who thinks everyone else needs to share the fun, too, so if I don’t want to get roped into jogging up and down the street with somebody who wants to talk about
Not enough for him to have picked his college major based on what Dad considered practical instead of what he himself loved; he “should” have gone to Annapolis or VMI, not Northwestern. Not enough to have compromised on going through Officer Candidate School in exchange for his college tuition money, even though he’d never wanted to be in the army in the first place. Now, even though he’d been one of the top picks from his OCS class for the Engineer Officer branch, Dad was still throwing passive-aggressive hissyfits because it wasn’t Infantry or Aviation.
“Stop freaking out. Jeez, you’re acting like I’m hiding a terminal illness or something. It’s just…I did a stupid thing, and then I
Clicking its tongue in feigned disappointment, the Entity strolled over to where Castiel lay. Dean scrambled to get there first; he wasn’t going to let this creature lay a finger on him. The Entity sighed dramatically. “No appreciation for mystery,” it said. “Yes, it is possible. For someone, anyway. And by that, I want to be clear, I do mean a human. I’m not attempting to prevaricate, trying to hide that what I
that thought before heading in. Well, maybe Naomi had. Dean sure hadn’t, and his throat tightened just imagining it now.
“Do I even want to know what this is?” Dean asked warily, opening the lid and immediately reeling back as a pungent scent practically dissolved the hairs in his nose. “Dude, no. Whatever it was, it went bad like a month ago.”
“Sammy, how did you get here?” Dean whispered. His thoughts were too slow, and he struggled to make them work. Sam hadn’t been on this trip…had he? Dean couldn’t remember.
“You and me both, but I don’t see that we have another choice,” Dean said. Dad, not being a fool, had definitely known better than to construct a safehouse with only one way out, but that meant that the emergency exits were always extremely well-hidden and designed to completely discourage anyone from wanting to go exploring if they happened to get lucky.
The bunker was never truly silent; between the buzz of old lights, the clicking and creaking of old appliances, and the strange faint hum that none of them had ever been able to identify, there was always noise. The silence around the two of them now was broken only by the quiet dripping of water onto the hard floor, Castiel’s quickened breathing, and Dean’s stammered, aborted attempts at speech. The loudest noise that Dean could hear was the rushing of his own blood, roaring in his ears almost painfully.
“So cocky,” Castiel called from down the hall, the smile behind his words obvious in his tone. “Spends most of his time sitting behind a desk, then thinks he’s hot stuff because he’s still got stamina at the end of the day. Consider, Dean, some of us have to go hard all day long.”
“Yeah, but a skeleton of what?” Dean said in bewilderment. It was clear now that the bones, obviously very old from the look of them, were probably too small to be from even a human infant. Still, if there had been confusion on that end, the long curved tail and the creepy elongated skull would have ended the argument. “That is not a rat.”
“My cousin is a florist,” Ruby supplied. “This is a scarlet hibiscus. I promise, Dr. Winchester, once it starts blooming, it looks nothing like weed. It’s just a really pretty red flower. You know, one that happens…happens to start out looking like…”
I should mention here that a good chunk of Dean's travails with his new house have been "ripped from the headlines," except that by "headlines," I mean personal experience. Good God, the house we had before this one. I've never seen a look on an electrician's face like the one I saw when ours discovered that plugging in his power tools would cause our ceiling fan to start turning lazily. I could write a book on that place. Instead, I've written this, and it was extremely cathartic.
“Cas?” came the surprised response. “Are we on a nickname basis now, then?” Before Dean could stammer in embarrassment, Castiel had added, “Because while I wouldn’t mind that in the least, I do think it’s rather unfair that I have no information with which I could work in reciprocation. How on earth could I shorten the name ‘Dean’? Maybe you have some identifying mark I could use instead—perhaps some sort of hideous disfigurement, or an extra finger on your right hand?”
Sam groaned a little, laughing. "I think you must have very different memories of those old times than I did. Let's just hope that if we manage to make it back here, they don't turn us right back out on our asses again."
“You almost had it that time!” Sam managed to say. The black horse, wearing the saddle it had obediently allowed Sam to buckle around its middle, seemed almost smug as it stomped its feet several yards away.
“Not really, no,” Castiel said. “But I’m getting the impression that it was something I said or did. You say you had gotten your hopes up. Tell me what you meant. What hopes?”
“What’s this tunnel like?” Meg asked Castiel, a slight tremor in her voice the only sign of her nerves. Her thumb was rubbing the hilt of her machete as though she was already preparing to start swinging. “Narrow, wide, lots of side entrances? How long is it?”
“What the hell do you think you’re doing here?” The words were hissed, more air than sound, but Dean could feel the rage vibrating in every syllable. Goosebumps made the hair on his arms stand on end as he gritted his teeth and forced himself to keep his feet firmly planted and not flinch away.
Dean held up his hands, shrugging and shaking his head. “Ain’t gonna argue with you, Sam. It’s insane, is what it is. But listen to me for real, now. I’d already figured the guy was in the state. Then Charlie’s antenna said he was somewhere to the south.” Sam looked as if he was going to interrupt and argue, so Dean cut to the chase. “And he’s playing
“Ooh, I heard Dariel’s garrison was assigned to locate and capture her. They’ll have her soon, and then…” The Cupid made a gruesome noise as he dragged a finger across his throat. Then he giggled.
“Hey!” Dean shouted, standing up and turning on his heel to confront the Entity. The only problem was that there was nobody else there. “Hey, asshole! Get back here! I know you can hear me!” No response came; Dean might have been completely alone in the vast space, other than for the sleeping lump of angel beside him.
She started rambling about gym classes and school sports, and Dean stopped paying attention. Fiercely turning his attention back to the horse, he firmed his jaw and stood tall. “Okay, enough screwing around,” he said, not sure whether he was addressing the stallion or himself. He grabbed the saddle, ignoring the whickering sounds the horse made, and scrambled into the saddle. It wasn’t graceful or smooth, but it worked. “Let’s go, Sammy,” he called.
“Let’s see. Flip phone, probably from the early nineties. Pens, paper clips. Oh, sweet, chewing gum!”
Castiel looked up from the screen, from which he’d been reading aloud the comments on their video. “There are actually a couple of replies to that comment, arguing over who is actually your biggest fan. I think one of them is claiming that title for herself, not her child.”
“Oh, just peachy,” Dean called back, hating the way his voice echoed and rebounded over and over. “Is it a Black Widow or a Brown Recluse that has the bright red stripes? I can’t remember.”
He’d gotten to know the other Runners, as well, and he found them to be a raucous but friendly group, despite the teasing they’d hurled at Dean when he’d led Castiel to their long dinner table the first time. Despite Castiel’s usual level of shamelessness, the curly-haired brunette named Meg had managed to make his ears burn with some of her cruder suggestions until a few of the others took pity on them and steered the conversation around to their long-running competition of zombie kill counts. (He’d definitely made note, however, of which suggestions had made Dean blush the hardest.)
“I swear, it’s not a joke,” Sam protested. “It’s actually a really good book. Lots of helpful information about how to manage a whole house.”
“I doubt you would have let it get that bad. It doesn’t matter, though. You did call, and my brother did try to turn it into a prank on me, and somehow we managed to make our way here, to this point, with us together in this fantastic bed in your gorgeous bedroom in your perfect new house.” Castiel punctuated his statement with a lopsided kiss on Dean’s chest.
Getting the door open quickly without making noise was going to be a problem. Castiel inched forward, reaching for the bolt handle. It was stubborn, he remembered, requiring a strong tug. Gritting his teeth, he tried to ease it open without jerking it.
Another crash, this time slightly louder, had him sighing. Running a hand through his already disheveled hair, Castiel closed his eyes and sent up a silent prayer for strength before striding toward the play area. “Okay, guys,” he said, “What’s—”
“Uncle Dean!” Claire cried when she spotted them. She darted toward him, and Dean hastily shrugged out of his own pack so he could catch her before she knocked him on his ass. “Guess what? I have an Elsa sleeping bag! It’s blue and white and shiny.” She giggled as he lifted her in his arms.
“We’re making decent time,” Sam said. “If we could keep this pace, kept the stops to a minimum, we could definitely be there before noon.”
“I don’t actually know the song. It sounded familiar, but…something about hoping someone was out there, that you didn’t want to be left alone.” Dean had moved over to the guitar case, popped it open. He ran a hand along the wood grain of the body fondly.
Mrs. Tran kicked open the door to Dean’s office closet, then hoisted the small pile of blankets over her head. She had to stand on tiptoe to get them onto the shelf he’d suggested, and they almost toppled back down on top of her before Dean quickly stepped over and gave them a stabilizing push. Once they were settled, she stepped back and brushed her hands against her hips. “This office is dusty,” she sniffed, eyeing him as though he’d been deliberately subverting the efforts of the college’s custodians.
Dean lifted an eyebrow, smirking in entertainment. “You were recording,” he repeated. “The Three Little Pigs? What, did cabin fever get to you before the virus could?”
