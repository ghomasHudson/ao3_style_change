“Yes. You know what she told me when it was over?”
“Oh, you have no idea.” Checking to make sure there’s no one approaching, Cas closes the door and starts to lead Dean toward the party.
“What is a Jain temple?” Jess wondered.
“Yes, loud and clear,” Cas grumbles. “We’ll talk soon, okay? I’ll let you know what day we’ll be arriving. Maybe we can get dinner or something.”
Dean looked at his glass, dark laughter shaking his chest. “Yeah, well, breaking promises is kind of what I do best.”
Dean immediately lifts a finger to his lips, his smile growing bigger even as he reminds his husband, “Shh, sweetheart, the kids.”
“Well, it’s what friends are for. You go get some sleep so you can get home on time tomorrow, okay? I got Callie.”
“Cas didn’t let him go.”
Cas steps forward and presses a finger to Dean’s lips. He’s so close it takes the wind out of Dean and he doesn’t dare move, just stares into the blue eyes he’s missed so much.
“Cas?” Dean says, his voice deep with concern. “Are you okay? Do you want to go see the nurse?”
Sam didn’t answer, didn’t dare to. But it seemed Dean didn’t need a response from him when he continued.
“Cas?” he asks, confused. “Ugh, no, haven’t seen him since this afternoon. Why?”
Jess beamed. “I have a friend I think you would like! He’s a really nice guy, real mature and down to Earth.”
Sam smiled at the two of them. He leaned down to wrap Cas in a hug. “I’m glad you could make it, man”
She’s there, cheering, Dean’s number on her back and she brushes his hand through the fence. Cas’s mouth dries up and he sits down to let the couple enjoy their moment.
Whatever else he says goes unheard because Dean sees Cas’s name flash on his screen and immediately picks up. “Cas? What’s wrong?”
He’d made her his special project a few months ago and she was a mess now, seats pulled out and engine gutted. He had it lifted a few feet away so he could mess around with other parts under the hood. It was a long and draining process but Dean knew he could do this. Fixing cars was the one thing he could do with complete confidence.
The bedroom was an entirely different battlefield. The water and Tylenol had been removed from the bedside table. The trash can no longer waited by the head of the bed. The bed was made, the comforter pulled tight and wrinkle free, the pillows fluffed and arranged perfectly along the headboard.
But there were a select few that Dean clung to, that ended in the same way Dean and Cas used to begin their days.
Cas settles on a stool at the island and the two talk while Dean cooks. They talk about the past eight years, everything they missed but wanted to share. It’s hard to say when regular communication between the two stopped. When Cas had first moved, they talked every day, usually in the evening to check in and provide a recap of the day’s events. They would spend hours on Skype during Cas’s third trimester when he was on bed rest, cooped up at home all day and bored out of his mind, and they would watch movies like that, eat dinner and laugh and laugh. It was almost like Cas wasn’t gone.
Cas shrugs out of her backpack and drops it in one of the empty chairs at the table next to Deanna and Sam’s. “Not too bad. Keeping busy with prom and finals.”
Dean musters up a matching one. “That’s amazing, Cas. How do you feel? Any strange headaches? Shooting spider webs out of your hands?”
“If you’re not busy later, I get off at seven. I’d love to meet up and… talk.”
For a moment all Dean can focus on is that Cas just admitted to thinking about his ass and his mind fills with new questions. “And my pants?” he asks after a beat.
“This feels like a dream,” Cas whispers.
Cas looks so good — different, but good. He’s a little more filled out, muscular and tan. His chocolate hair is still a mess but a tad bit tamer than in his twenties and he has lines around his mouth and eyes that definitely hadn’t been there before. The tales of parenthood.
“I’m getting tired!”
He stoops down and holds out a hand to the little girl. “It’s great to finally meet you, Callie.”
All of Saturday is dedicated to getting read for the dance.
Sixteen days.
Cas smirks and eyes the crowd. “I think it’s charming.”
“It would be great if you came, Cas,” Sam agreed. “Ellen, Bobby and Jo would love to see you. And it would mean a lot to me. Just think about it.”
Something in Cas’s chest drops as he watches the show of high school love and affection, marvels at how simple it looks but knowing just how complicated and nerve-wracking it truly is.
“I’m Castiel Novak, this is my friend, Dean Winchester. He’s, uh, he’s coming with me for the appointment.”
The elevator slowly ascends the building, taking its sweet fucking time. Dean flexes his fingers, which are going numb under the weight of grocery bags.
“Put all your weight on your alphas,” Donna breaks in, still keeping her voice low and soothing. “Trust them to support you through this as they have supported you through your pregnancy, as they will support you during birth.”
He unlocks the door and pulls it open.
Dean claps his hands together. “All right, well. You must be dying to tell Callie. I’ll go get her so you can break the news.”
Their lips meet and Dean thinks he can taste his future in Cas: Cas tastes like a house on the outskirts of town with a vegetable garden and a front-porch swing. He tastes like lullabies and squeals of young laughter. He tastes like petty arguments over laundry and Saturday afternoons grading papers in the backyard and midnight dances in the kitchen while it rains outside. He tastes like happiness and shooting stars and wild dreams that always come true.
He grabbed the box and threw it on the counter. Without hesitating, he ripped through the tape and opened it.
“Okay, okay, okay,” Dean says and finally catches Cas’s hands, holding them tight and safely away from his body. He’s still smiling even as Cas glares up at him. “I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to make it happen so I didn’t want to say anything,” Dean explains. “I didn’t want to get yours or the kids’ hopes up and then find out at the last second that I wouldn’t be able to come. I couldn’t do that to you again.” For the first time since he turned on the light, Dean’s eyes look sad and all the fury coursing through Cas evaporates.
Cas laughed. “No, no, no. I haven’t had time.”
“Maybe it’s a bit late to be concerned with now,” Gabe starts as he jumps to sit on the table, “but with a lust spell isn’t there a bit of an issue with… oh, I don’t know, a little thing called
Dean’s eyes saddened. “Cas…”
Sam smiled meekly. “Thanks, Cas. Of course, that is all depending on whether or not I get through these next two weeks of school.”
“Did you love him?”
“Hiding.”
“Fine,” Callie says. Short and simple.
Cas leaned back, almost like he had been slapped. “But why?”
Cas didn’t lie. “I missed this.”
Dean bites a grin and keeps both hands on the wheel. “Just pick something good before I change my mind.”
Suddenly, Dean looked down and was horrified to see the slight tent in his pants.
Dean snorts and looks at her dad, catching just the barest of smiles as he still looks at the table. “Yeah, well, your daddy was always a food snob.”
She runs her usual tests on Cas, checking his blood pressure and his heart, listens to him breathe. She then has him lie back and pull up the hospital gown he’d been given. She checks on the baby and reports that everything looks great. In another minute, Cas is sitting up and redressing.
Cas digs them out of his coat pocket. Dean takes them but before he can pull away Cas closes his hand around Dean’s. Dean looks up and Cas’s eyes are clear and blue and not for the first time Dean wonders if it’s the magic in him. Cas stares back at him and says, “Be careful.” His voice is impossibly lower and Dean feels his heartbeat trip.
“So, now that we’ve solved that, think you’re ready for a present?”
“And add an extra love,” Cas says after a moment.
Cas forces himself to take a deep breath. Several deep breaths. Until he feels calm enough that he won’t yell.
Something in Dean’s chest aches with the weight of an unfulfilled wish. He brushes it away. “Yeah, but you’re going to meet someone, Cas! You’re a great person. The best person. You still have time.”
“You really researched Jain temples for me?”
Dean barked out a bit of laughter from his position at the stove. “Oh, please. I’m not a pig, Cas.”
Dean takes a moment to steel himself and walks closer. Cas doesn’t move but his eyes track Dean until they’re just a foot apart.
“I… it’s a tree. Sort of.”
The elevator doors open and Dean and Brady step into what can only be described as utter chaos. The scent is what hits them first because it smells like a damn daycare, like youth and sugar cookies and pure energy. The sight strikes them next because it’s all very,
By the gods, a
Anna walked until she was just inches from Dean. “I’m saying that if you see a way to fix this, do it. And do it now. No more waiting. I want my brother to be happy and if you’re the key, then do what you need to do to get past this. Otherwise, stay far away from him.”
“You okay?” Charlie asked.
“Dean?” he whispers, fingers reaching out toward the shadowy figure.
Dean is up like a rocket and halfway across the room before Charlie can even properly scold him for knocking her over.
“Just one in the center of each panel,” she instructs.
Cas’s hand is shaking as she moved the card and sees the gift. It’s a mask of black late and beautiful silver stitching and beads lining the edges. It’s stunning and better than anything she could ever hope to find at a Party City or costume store.
“You’re just saying that because you’re getting all the attention,” Cas teases. But he leans in and steals another kiss. “But I think you’re right.”
Castiel waits about an hour after the kids fall asleep before he sneaks down the stairs, rolls or wrapping paper tucked under his arm. He fetches the secret stash of gifts from the hall closet — because if there’s one place he can count on the kids not poking around in, it’s the closet with all the cleaning supplies.
Put it all together and you had a weapon meant to destroy Dean.
This time when Cas snorts, it’s with humor, and she punches her friend lightly. “Now you’re just being mean to cheer me up.”
“Brady, what the hell?” Dean exclaims, regaining his balance.
Sam sighed and shoved a hand through his hair. “I don’t know, Cas. I just… I guess I was just thinking that… maybe—maybe if you tried talking to—”
“Cas!” she cheered upon his return. “You’re back!”
Shame washes through Cas like ice water and he feels his shoulders drop. He had no right to snap like that. He didn’t even understand what had come over him. Dean and Lisa have been circling each other for a while now and Cas had always gotten along with her before. It had to be these hormones.
But then there’s a crashing sound and Cas nearly stabs himself in the knee with the scissors. In a flash, he’s on his feet, scissors clutched tightly in his hand, and he waits, not even breathing.
“I don’t see why not. You’re my best friend and, as an alpha, you may have some different insight into what qualities I should be looking for.”
But they don’t go away. In fact they get worse, because now Dean’s certain the two would get along and they would realize that, see that they could actually make a good match. Balthazar was a decent looking guy, Cas was clearly attracted to him at the sperm bank. And there’s no way Balthazar isn’t attracted to Cas. Cas is fucking hot. Tall, broad shoulders, muscular but not too bulky. Dean likes to tease him for being so ripped for someone whose dream was to spend all day in dimly lit museums geeking out over ancient artifacts.
“I thought you weren’t drinking.”
“You would be correct.”
Callie nods like she understands. “Are you sad about Brady?”
Balthazar clucked knowingly. “And Dean will be there.”
Not stand in his way.
“Wasn’t he a bad guy?”
It takes all of Caswillpower to make himself climb off of Dean’s lap — and to be fair, it seems to take Dean a considerable amount of strength to let him go. But they eventually separate with soft smiles and a meeting place in mind.
If a few of those summer thoughts conjure up the laughter of a young girl and a certain man’s eyes that reflect the blue of the sky only found in summer… he ignores it and pushes the thoughts away. They put up a fight. Dean sighs and pulls a different chart in front of him. Maybe he’ll just go over the expense reports for tonight.
Dean stands and starts collecting plates. “She’s a kid. She’s supposed to make things difficult. Plus, I’m a stranger. She’ll warm up to me.” He says it with a wink.
When he gets home the lights are off again save for the kitchen and there’s a note letting him know his dinner is in the microwave. He finds Dean in bed.
Dean’s lip trembles too when he says, “I love you too, sweetheart. And I always will. More than you’ll ever know.” He pulls her in for one last squeeze, kisses the top of her head, feels her tears dampen his T-shirt.
Cas. Goddammit.
Cas shrugs. “We talked about Callie and about our lives. He wants to meet her.”
Dean glared at her. “I’m not nervous.”
pink.
“Will do.”
It’s then that the front door opens and Brady hustles inside. “Hey, baby, sorry I’m—” He pauses when he comes upon the table, eyes going between Dean and Callie who are leaning toward each other with intense eyes, between them a helpless Castiel sipping his wine like a lifeline.
Cas jumped up, eyes wild and drool on his chin. He looked around, searching for the source of whoever was shouting his name.
“Wouldn’t miss it,” Dean promises.
Everything is finished. They’ll spend a few hours tomorrow cleaning up and won’t see it again until Saturday night.
Charlie looks between Dean and the photo, eyes flickering back and forth, before finally settling on Dean. And she peers at him, hard. Like she’s trying to see past him and into his soul, his alpha. Dean’s not sure what she finds there but whatever it is, it’s enough to make her jaw drop.
“That was even better than I imagined,” Cas whispers into the heated space between them.
Her gaze lingers on them for a few accusatory seconds but then she turns and proceeds to explain the rest of the day’s agenda.
Everyone knows when the team has made it because it suddenly goes from outstandingly loud to unbearably loud. Cas catches glimpses of Dean through the crowd. He’s smiling with his team which is storming the bar for drinks. People of hollering their congratulations and singing songs of victory at the top of their lungs.
“Yeah, thanks,” Deanna says roughly. “And, uh, about yours… I, uh.”
There’s something unreadable in her smile when it finally forms for the briefest of moments before it’s big and bright. Dean returns it and picks up his gift.
Dean hisses. “Oof, someone’s sleeping on the couch tonight.” As he says it, he hears the other alpha’s voice coming from the next room, calling the kids over where he and a woman stand. “Who’s that?”
“Hmm? Oh, yes, yes, of course. Umm, what was the question?”
He shakes it all away and leans back into the couch. “I’d rather save us both the embarrassment.”
“New book?” Dean asks casually before shoveling a handful of fries into his mouth.
“Fifty-fifty case,” Cas grins.
“I thought you were supposed to be a professional,” Callie says with a laugh when Dean burns yet another crepe.
In all this mess with Deanna the last few days, Cas had nearly forgotten about her promposal.
The exhibit turns out to be super cool. They explore an old train cart and read about the gold rush. There are mannequins dressed in cowboy garb complete with boots and hats and Callie stares up at them with abject fascination.
“I agree that is was unusual behavior, but perhaps it was all just a matter of circumstances. Dean was at a bar close to my apartment, he needed help so he came to the closest… acquaintance.” Cas almost bit himself on the word.
“Are you mad at me?”
“Yeah, it was real nice of him. Especially since he was ready to beat your ass for fucking with his sperm.”
Dean chuckles at him as he moves away. “Hey, you’re the one who said it’s flu season and only one of us works around germy kids all day.”
“Way ahead of you.”  Dean was already on the phone, waiting for his brother to answer.
"It wasn't THAT funny."
Dancing was not something unusual for the two of them.  They danced together quite frequently.  This, however, sent Cas flying back in time to high school, to the night Dean drove him home and it began to rain, to Dean turning the music on in the car and pulling Cas into a dance.  “
Matt flushed ever so slightly.  “Seventeen.”
Cas was woken the next morning by Dean nuzzling kisses along his throat.  He smiled.  “Morning.”
“But you two didn’t give up on me.  Even though I was an ornery bastard.”  Dean couldn’t help a sharp bark of laughter at the words, and Matt smiled.  “Really, guys.  I mean it.  I know I was a tough case and you’ve been amazing.  More than I ever hoped I could have.”
“YEA, I’m sure!”
Castiel couldn’t help it; he burst into laughter.  “God, I love you.”  No more hesitation.  Hooking a hand beneath one of Dean’s legs, he pulled it up around his hip as he pressed into the man.  Both of them moaned at the feeling, and Cas had to stop before he got very far.  Dean always felt so tight, no matter how much time Cas spent opening him up.  He let his forehead rest against Dean’s shoulder, breath coming in shallow bursts as he tried to gain control.  Finally, he eased the rest of the way in.  He felt graceful fingers running through his hair, brushing the dark locks back from his sweat-dampened forehead before kissing it.
The words made the boy flush even more, but not so much as the sound of Mary’s voice behind him echoing “you’re
Taking a deep breath, Dean picked up the phone and dialed Charlie.  It didn’t seem likely that she would say no, but he was anxious all the same.
“You’re
Those few words made Dean melt, made him so very happy.  “Thank you, Charlie,” he whispered.  “Thank you so much.”
It was almost ten o’clock when Dean reached the Roadhouse.  It was Thursday night and the parking lot was filled with cars.  It usually wasn’t this busy until the weekend.  He hoped that Matt wasn’t too overwhelmed.  The boy had been training for almost a week now, so Ellen was starting to put him on in the evenings.
Cas merely laughed.  “Good?”
Cas looked to Dean with a smile.  “Looks like he’s doing well.”
Cas laughed.  “Of course we will be.”  He could hear Dean beside him, stifling laughter.  He would bet good money it was because Mary had immediately forgotten her present at the thought that her parents would be calling to speak only to Bela and Charlie and not to her.
“Yup!”  The little boy didn’t sound fazed in the slightest, and Matt laughed.  Dean loved to see him so happy.  Then he noticed the sketchbook in Castiel’s lap.  He was vaguely aware of Charlie moving closer to Matt and Chaz, her voice chattering away enthusiastically, but he was far too distracted by what was on that paper.
Smiling, Cas accepted and let Dean tug him to his feet.  “Call us when dinner is ready?”
“Thank you, no.  My husband is off selecting twenty or so books to buy.”
“I’m interested in taking you home and giving you a good meal and a place to sleep for the night.”
The words brought a swelling of pride in his chest.  If Dean were there, he would have been bright red at the words.  He still blushed like crazy when people complimented him, but Cas never got tired of hearing it.  Dean was talented, more than he would ever admit.  “Very.”
Charlie looked to them with a raised brow.  “Likes Mary, does he?”
Dean blinked down at him in surprise.  “A penguin?”  The boy nodded.  “Well, so do I, Chaz, but I really don’t think we can get one.”
Mary nodded.  She had stopped eating now, silverware set aside.
“Yeah….done good.  What….you’ve never heard that?”
.”  Castiel’s voice was filled with a sort of awe, and Dean felt warm butterflies as he blushed.  Even after all these years together, Cas could still make him blush.
Mary’s mouth immediately closed like a trap, but the anger was still there, simmering behind her eyes.  She shouldered her bag again and turned away, mumbling something under her breath.  Cas stopped her in place with one hand on her shoulder.
“Happy birthday.”
Castiel groaned.  He had never been a morning person, and with the time difference, it was really not going well for him.  But today was the day they went to Stratford-upon-Avon.  Today they went to see where Shakespeare had lived.  And that required travel.  Travel meant getting up even earlier than usual.  “I’m up, I’m up.”  He rubbed blearily at his eyes, sitting up, and blinked in surprise at the sight before him.
“Hey.”  Matt picked up the box of cereal still sitting on the table and poured himself a bowl, moving to get the milk from the fridge.  But when he returned to the table, his attention was immediately drawn to Dean, who had pulled out a pair of dance slippers.  “…..what’re you doing?”
“Hey, baby,” Dean called over his shoulder, not taking his eyes off the screen for one second.
Mary had been retaining a firm grip on her self-control, but it finally broke; she threw an arm around each of her dads, gripping them in a tight hug.  “I’m gonna miss you guys so much,” she whispered.
“Cas, did you honestly expect me to walk down Portobello Road and not sing ‘
“Well, last night when I was driving home, I ran into a kid about your age.”  He still couldn’t be certain of Matt’s exact age, but the boy had to be around sixteen.  “He’s homeless.  I brought him back here to spend the night, and I’m hoping he’ll stay here for good.”
“You’re a brat tonight, you know that, right?”
"Yea. YOU'RE the one with the stupid insults." Dean grinned at his husband. "Assbutt."
Matt only grinned.  The sight of it filled both men with happiness.  “Looking forward to it.”
She smoothed down the front of his shirt, smiling.  “You’ll
“Happy?  Dean, I can’t
Mary’s eyes lit up.  “Aunt Claire!”  She hugged the blonde, her mother by birth who had always been an aunt to her.  They were of a height but even so, Claire pressed a kiss to her forehead.
“So we’re spending the first week in London?”
Dean had no answer.  He adjusted the books in his arms (Cas had given up trying to count them) and turned back to Sylvia.  “I’m Dean.  It’s so nice to finally meet you.”
Dean chuckled and leaned down to scoop his son into his arms.  “Oof.”  He kissed the boy’s head.  “You’re getting too big to pick up.”
It was true.  It had been well over a month since they had gotten together.  Nearly two months, now that he thought about it.  It really didn’t take much guessing to figure out why.  He and Cas had been so caught up in making certain Matt felt at home; they didn’t want to overwhelm him with bringing in too many friends at once.  Ellen and Bobby had visited, and Sam and Sarah had come over, but that was it.  It was getting to be about time to start bringing in more people, though.  If Matt truly was staying, as he said he was, it would be good to get him used to their friends, especially when the house was usually so full of so many.  As long as they started slowly, it wouldn’t be too bad.
When Castiel looked at Dean this time, his blue eyes were soft, the smile on his face so warm and loving that Dean’s heart melted.  “I’m more than okay with that.”  He kissed Dean again.  “Spread your legs, babe.”
Dean pulled Cas in for a huge kiss.  “Yes!  Of course I will!  You….you planned all this for me?”
On their way back to the hotel, they stopped by
“Dean!”
“Don’t give me that.  You know perfectly well what you’re doing.”
Charlie heaved a sigh at Cas' question, rolling her eyes.  Bela simply smiled.  “Positive.  You two just forget all about us and focus on your trip.”
“Mary.  Not fooling us by reading with her flashlight.”
Matt’s brow furrowed in confusion.  “But I thought---“
Cas ruffled the boy’s messy hair.  “Told you, kiddo.”
Matt was sitting beside him, watching the dancers with wide eyes.  Castiel wasn’t surprised.  These girls were the same ones who had started taking Dean’s class as very little girls, the first students he had ever had, and by now they were quite good.  Lauryn had never taken to it and had dropped out after only a year, but Mary’s friend Chrissy was still here, and three other girls. Ava Wilson, Madison Vaugier, and the daughter of Jody Mills’ son, Lily Mills.  Dean had plenty more students, but they were in other classes.  These were the girls who had been here the longest and who were the most advanced.
Sam just grinned.  “Always.”
“I can’t let you continue to do all this work and not give you anything in return!” Benny protested.
Dean poked his head into the room.  “Who’s not fooling whatzzit?”
As if on cue, the bright blue impala turned into the driveway, Mary and Matt in the front, Charlemagne safely strapped in the backseat.  The instant they parked, Charlemagne leapt out of the car and came running inside, straight into his older cousin’s arms.  Jared tousled his hair, laughing.
A surprise visit from his nephew gives Dean an idea...
“Dork.  I know that.  I want to.”  He pulled away from Cas, shifting to all fours above the man, and gently tugged the slacks down just enough to free his cock.  Then he was leaning forward, swallowing him down.
“Okay.  I’ll get dinner started.”
The smile that came to Dean’s face had a twinkle to it.  “Gonna scrub me down?”
“Six, eight, whatever.  He’s a child.  He doesn’t need the internet.”
Cas shut the bathroom door behind them and Dean flopped against it, chuckling to himself.  “What,” Cas smiled.  “What’s so funny?”
They all looked to the doorway, where Charlemagne was standing, looking at all of them with his head tilted to one side in confusion.
Dean couldn’t help the burst of laughter.  “We will.”
Dean glanced up at the clock.  One already.  Damn.  He didn’t have much time.  Cindy was coming over that afternoon to dance.  Now that she was older, she didn’t take many professional dancing jobs, and spent more time helping Dean out at the school.  But more than that, the two got to spend more time dancing together just for enjoyment.  Today was one of those days.
“You home for break?”  Jared nodded.  “Good.  We don’t see nearly enough of you.  Why the hell did you have to go to Italy?”
Dean looked to his husband, grinning.  “You laughing at me?”
Ellen was looking appraisingly at Matt, who was becoming more and more unsettled by the minute.  “….I think we may have a spot for him,” she said at last.
you can have it.”
“Too much at tea time?”
They made their way down to the shore.  There was a boat yard there.  Cas had made preparations the night before, and had reserved a boat.  Dean was staring, mouth slightly agape.  It seemed as though he hadn’t quite made the connection that Castiel had intended not just to take him to a dock on the river but actually out ON the river.  Cas gave him a little nudge.
Cas padded into the kitchen on bare feet, hair somehow even messier than usual and a sleepy smile on his face.  “I smell eggs.”
They didn’t speak any more on the way home.  At least, Matt didn’t.  Dean talked a lot, telling Matt about Cas and Mary and Charlemagne.  He didn’t speak enough to overload Matt, but he wanted the boy to have a sense of the house he was coming into.
Cas ran his fingers through that sandy hair.  “Well, go buy your thirty books.”
Dean nodded as he tugged his shirt on.  “Matt agreed to stay.”
Castiel’s expression turned pensive.  “Good question.”  He was silent for several moments as he thought the matter over.  “….probably the pre-Raphaelites.”
Dean ruffled his son’s hair with a smile on his face.  “Yea, Chaz.  We’re gonna get dinner.”  He grabbed the boy’s windbreaker and helped him into it, leaning down so he could look into the boy’s big brown eyes.  “You ready to go see Matt and grandma?”
She looked confused at the irritation in his voice.  “Yeah, Two?”  He turned to face her, slippers in hand, and her face immediately blanched.
Dean turned.  “Yea?”
"Then you should understand how hilarious it was."
Cas smiled.  “God help me, yes.  I do.”
Dean had managed to make certain Matt would stay for at least a little while longer.  As soon as breakfast was over, he offered to wash Matt’s clothes.  In the meantime, Matt wore a spare set of Cas’.  Matt was shorter than both Dean and Cas by just a few inches. He was fairly close to Cas’ height but he still had to cuff the pants up ever so slightly.  It reminded Dean of Cas in high school and put a smile on his face.
, Dean felt so good.  He always did, arms around Cas’ neck, legs around his waist, and that tight heat of his body slowly driving Castiel out of his mind.  It wouldn’t be much longer now.  He could feel himself losing control.
“Don’t mind Dean.  He hates eggs.  And so does Mary.  They gang up on me.”
“I’m a writer,” Dean answered, erasing a period and merging two sentences with a semi-colon.  Matt mulled this over for a few moments, then something registered in his face, eyes narrowing in suspicion.
“I know, right?  She got it from her aunt Claire.”  He watched Matt shake his head, continuing to eat in silence.  “So,” Dean bit into a piece of toast, crunching noisily.  “Do you have a job?”  He already knew the answer, but if there was a better way to broach this topic, he had no idea.
Dean nodded.  “Sailors hit each other with them.  And I’m gonna hit you.”
“Okay.”  He kissed her forehead.  “Drive safe.”
Matt’s cheeks were red; he looked back to his plate.  “Still don’t want you buying all my things.”
Rolling his eyes, Cas gave him a shove.  “Will you get going?” He watched Dean vanish from sight, shaking his head with a smile.  He poked around the shop.  It really was an amazing place, with such a wonderful selection, and so much history to it.  Then something brushed up against his leg and he started, looking down to find a black dog wagging its tail at him.  “Oh.  Hello, there.”
Cas laughed.  “I love you, too.”
There was the softest sound of a footfall behind them, and Cas turned to see Matt blushing in the doorway.  He smiled.  “It gets better, Charlie.  Matt here is a video game whiz.”
“Cas!”  Speak of the devil.  “Cas, look what I—” Dean came barreling around the corner but stopped dead when he saw the woman at the counter, his eyes going huge and round.  “Oh my God.  Oh my God.”
Dean smiled.  “I love you, too.”
“Mm…..gonna do anything else besides scrub me down?”  Dean trailed his fingers lightly and teasingly up and down Cas’ side in a way that made the man shiver.
Cas chuckled, taking Dean’s hand and tugging him to his feet.  “And sexy.”
Shopping had actually been a lot of fun.  Now that Matt had a job and was able to contribute to his stay with the Winchesters, he was much more relaxed about living with them (thank GOD).  This extended to their trip to the mall.
“That depends.”
Dean returned to his side, bags in hand.  “You ready to go?”
Cas was smiling.  “Now you can put all your albums on your iPod.”  That was the only real problem with records.  You could find all this wonderful out of print material, but you couldn’t carry it around with you.
The boy’s lip jutted out, face apologetic.  “M’sorry.”
“Ow.  Careful there, Chaz.”  He heard a chuckle coming from across the room and looked up to see his husband in the doorway.  He fixed Cas with a steely glare.  “Don’t encourage him.”
The sound of footsteps reached his ears and he turned, expecting to see Castiel, but was surprised to see someone with him…..a priest.  He looked to Cas, brow furrowed, and was even more surprised to see something in his hands.  Flowers?
Unsurprisingly, Mary’s hand went up like a shot.  Chrissy rolled her eyes, muttering “show-off.”  Mary shot her a glare. Chrissy poked her right where she was most ticklish; Mary let out a yelp.
Then he saw that familiar head of messy black hair as Matt appeared from the kitchen, tray in hand.  He watched with a smile as Matt headed over to a table, serving dinner to some customers.  The boy looked like he was settling in just fine.
He nodded.  “Definitely.  And a writer, actually.”
Matt’s head snapped around to look at Charlemagne, his eyes huge.
Matt looked on the verge of tears. He managed a nod.  “Thank you.  You really….”  He struggled to clear his throat and when he spoke again, his voice was much stronger.  “You guys are really great, you know that?”
All they could do was wait and hope.
Matt practically gagged.  “That is DISGUSTING.”
“Hold on a second.”  Dean jogged over to a passing couple.  “Would you mind…?”  He proffered his camera and seconds later, Cas found himself wrapped in Dean’s arms again.  “Smile, baby.”
“Sugar, the day you need a white knight to defend you, I’ll be right there,” the big man responded in that sweet Southern drawl of his.  “But I’m pretty sure you can kick anyone’s ass all on your own.”
Their hotel was called
Thank you so much to everyone who has stuck by this story despite the huge delays, and for all of the support about my depression.  You've been wonderful and I can't tell you how much I appreciate it.  <3
He looked from his son to the two teens mere feet away, then to his husband.  Was Matt their son now?  That was a question for another time.  All that really mattered was that he was staying, and that he was family.
Dean woke early the next morning.  It was Mary’s sixteenth birthday, and he had to make her her special breakfast.  When he was adopted by Ellen, he may have kept his own last name, but he was still a Harvelle at heart, and it was a Harvelle tradition to do breakfast in bed on one’s birthday.
Dean turned to his husband, smile setting his face aglow.  “Never better.”
Dean couldn’t help but laugh.  “I’m sorry!”
“Anyway,” Dean continued, “they should all be home soon.”  He headed to the laundry room and immediately made a noise of frustration.  “Dammit, Mary!”  When he reentered the kitchen, Matt was looking curiously at him.  “She was supposed to clean her slippers.”  He held her pink toe shoes up by the ribbons.
Cas shook his head at his husband’s antics.  “Did you guys have a good time at the mall?”
Dean set down the pen he’d been using to mark his shoes and held out his arms, smiling when the boy bounced right into them.  “What’s up, Chaz?”
Dean cupped his husband’s chin, guiding him closer and in for a kiss.  “I love you.”
Cas settled in to watch his kids and the possible new addition.  Charlemagne was sitting quietly but happily between the two older kids as they looked over the movies, trying to pick out something to watch during dinner.  Cas was happy for the chance to watch them.  Dean had been alone with Matt all day.  It was nice to observe the boy for himself.
Castiel arched a brow.  “Be grateful we’re not making you stay home from your sleepover tomorrow night.”
Castiel took Dean’s hand once again, squeezing.  Dean looked to his husband, loving the gentle smile on his face.  It was as if Cas had read his mind.  Wherever it was Matt had come from, with them he truly was home.
Dean managed to bite back a whimper, though a shiver ran down his spine, and he couldn’t help but push a bit more.  “Maybe a little.”
?  You want to see
Matt chuckled.  “Okay, Chaz.  You can help, too.”
Cas smiled. "I love you, assbutt."
It took over an hour before he was done with that house alone, closely examining each and every figure, reading every single word that was written.  And there was no way Cas would begrudge him.  Dean had been so very patient the past few days, letting Cas take as long as he wanted at every single art museum.  He knew that, though Dean enjoyed art, if he had his way, he would have been at each museum for probably half as long as they had been, but that he had stuck it out for Castiel’s sake.  There was no way Cas would do any less for Dean.
“Yea, yea, I know.”  Dean grinned, looking around the group of them.  “Shall we head up to the studio?”
“Okay.”  Dean gestured to the car.  “I’ve got a husband and two kids, but we have a pull out couch you can sleep on, and in the morning, there’ll be plenty of breakfast.”
Charlemagne was watching the two of them.  “Are we getting dinner?”
Cas smiled at that, shutting off the water and turning to his husband.  “I’d love to.”  He didn’t get to play the piano nearly as often as he’d like to.
“Why wouldn’t it be?”
The boy looked away.  “No.”  When he spoke again, his voice was extremely low, barely a whisper.  “My foster mother read it to me.”
Laughing, Cas turned Dean to face him, capturing his lips in a soft kiss.
raised me!”
“Cas?”
Matt flushed at the excitement in Mary’s voice, and Cas stifled a laugh behind his hand.  Dean shook his head in exasperation.  “No, Mary.  He’s going to dance with Cindy.”
Mary’s hand fluttered to her heart in exaggerated horror.   She had also inherited all of her fathers’ drama.  “That’s a
Dean shook his head, amused.  “His crappy Prius is acting up, and Mary has drama club after school today, so she can’t drive him home.  I promised I’d come get him.”  He stretched, wincing as his back popped.  Yup, he was getting old.  “So, go shopping then go get the boys?”
Matt flushed under the attention.  “I don’t know.  I’ve never listened to one.”
.”  Dean’s head tipped back against the pillow as he moaned his pleasure.  Cas took advantage of all the bared skin by latching his mouth onto it, kissing and nipping Dean’s throat as he continued to rock into that tight heat.
“Mm.”  The handshake was prolonged, and Matt looked almost pleadingly at Dean, obviously at a loss and wanting help.  Dean simply shrugged as if to say ‘you’re on your own’.
With a fluttering wink, Tessa left.  Chrissy let forth a burst of giggles that she had been holding back behind both hands.  Even Mary looked as if she were trying not to laugh.
Dean nodded.  “Yea.  For now.  He’s still too unsettled to make any moves on her.  If he were settled in, more sure of himself, I’d be concerned.  But right now?”  Dean shook his head.  “Not at all.  Besides,” he turned to Cas, grinning.  “Mary could kick his ass.”
Matt still looked nervous, but he nodded at last.  “Okay.”  The answer was barely audible, but Dean would take what he could get.
Cas kissed him.  “You do bring it out in me.”  Grabbing Dean’s slacks off the bed, he shoved them at the man.  “Get dressed.  We’ve got food waiting for us.”
“The river?”  Dean didn’t even try to hide the eagerness in his voice, and Cas stifled a laugh.  “You’re taking me out on the river?”
Cas stretched.  “We should get cleaned up.”
been there.
Cas leaned in for another kiss.  “An hour sounds
Cas let Dean push the shirt from his shoulders and shivered when the man gently ran one fingertip down his spine.  That was it.  That was more than he could take.  He fisted his hands in Dean’s shirtfront and dragged him into another hungry kiss, pulling away to breathlessly whisper “then what the hell are we waiting for?”
Claire had started working at the roadhouse shortly after graduating college, and it seemed as though Ellen may be grooming her to take over one day.  She certainly had a knack for the business.  Now she looked to Matt with interest.  “Who’s this?”
“A BIG one.”
“Oh, come on!”
, I’m sore.”  He looked up at his husband, who was already on his feet, having not danced all night.  “Cas, I’m
Matt nodded in understanding.  Then his brow furrowed in puzzlement.  “Why does he need a ride?”
Cas yanked at his hair.  “Turn around.  Get up here and turn around.  I wanna suck you, too.”
“….I—“
.”  His voice was filled with reverence.
“So what’s this I hear about a new addition to the family?”
“Damn straight.”  But first.  “CAS!” Dean hollered.  Cas was in the basement working on one of his bigger art pieces.  But this?  He wouldn’t want to miss this.
The front door slammed open and all thoughts of the clean kitchen fled Dean’s mind at the sight before him. Mary stormed inside, face cloudy. Chaz was right behind her, an expression of confusion on his face, and Cas behind both of them.
This was the most that Matt had ever spoken in any one sitting, and the depth of emotion in his words was enough to bring tears to the men’s eyes.  Cas took Dean’s hand in his and squeezed it, and, after a moment’s hesitation, reached out and gave Matt’s hand a soft squeeze as well.  The boy looked surprised but didn’t pull away.
The bathroom had an old-fashioned tub rather like their one at home.  They had taken  the champagne with them for a prolonged bubble bath spent wrapped in each other’s arms.  It had been wonderful, warm and full of soapy, sloppy kisses.  Then the two men had dried each other off and crawled back into bed.
“Okay,” he said.  “Well, they should be here within the half hour.  I’m gonna make some lunch first.”  He cocked his head.  “Care to join me?”  Matt nodded and Dean smiled.  “Okay, then.  Let’s go.”
“Ah.”  Dean nodded his understanding.  “Anyone I would know?  Any paintings?”
to pick up all of Dean’s books.  Sylvia had packaged them so neatly that they were easy to carry.  They thanked her again profusely.  She asked Dean to write down the names of his books for her and he promised he would send her copies.  She seemed pleased by this.  Dean was over the moon when they left, heading down the road past the street vendors.
“Can I come in?”
Matt stifled a laugh as Dean glowered at his husband, muttering “oh, shut up, asshole.”  He turned to Matt, pointing a finger at him.  “There WILL be a rematch later.”
Dean perked up.  “You have?”
Matt appeared at the top of the stairs, sleepy eyes bewildered as he witnessed the scene before him.  “Uh…”
“Thanks, Matt.”  Dean shifted, wincing at the soreness in his muscles.  “
Dean patted Cindy on the back and then gave a sharp tug to the long blonde braid that hung down her back.  “Hey!”  She sprang away, hand going protectively to her hair.  Benny laughed.  Turning, she smacked her husband’s arm.  “You shut up.  You’re supposed to defend ME, not laugh along with him!”
Cas ruffled the boy’s soft brown hair.  “Good kid.”
Cas burst out laughing.  “I know, right?  Fabio.  I thought there was only one.  THE Fabio.”
Despite how long it had been since the two had graduated, Dean remained close with their high school English teacher.  He even helped her organize and chaperone field trips to various outings (usually plays), and the two often got together for a cup of tea and some scones (baked by Dean).
But Mary didn’t seem to have heard.  She had noticed Matt’s new clothes.  “Wow, Matt!  Your clothes!”
“You are a dork,” Cas announced.
Matt looked back and forth between the three of them and the DVD case.  “What….he likes
“Yup.”
“Great.”  Cas gave a little nod in the direction of the two boys, but Dean had already noticed, a huge smile spreading across his freckled face.
” His voice was hopeful.
Dean nodded.  “Understood.”
Dean snorted.  “Oh, right.”  Still, he kept his mouth shut until they had left the room.  “But seriously!  Colonel Tom Blood manages to steal the things, then when he’s caught he says he’ll speak to no one but King Charles II himself.  The king not only pardons him, but gives him land and even lets him hang out at court!  How badass is that?”
This is an example of the dom brow I talk about in this chapter.
Dean couldn’t help but laugh at that face.  “
Cas shook his head with a small smile, leaning in to kiss his husband on the cheek.  “I’m going to go get changed,” he whispered.  Dean looked up at him, eyes warm.
It was clear throughout all of this exchange that Matt was trying his best not to laugh.  Dean was so happy to see it.  He wanted Matt to be happy there.  Wanted Matt to stay.  He looked at the boy.  “You wanna crash again?  Breakfast won’t be quite as spectacular tomorrow, but I work from home, so I generally make something.  And lunch.”
A sudden commotion came from the rear of the room as petite blonde girl came out from the back, face lighting up when she saw who was there.  “Dean!”  She was at his side in an instant, squeezing him in a tight hug.
At the response, Matt’s temper seemed to flare again, eyes once more looking at Dean with anger in them.  “What do you care, anyway?  Why do you give a shit about me?”
“Hey, we’ve only get until 11.”  He pulled Dean into a kiss, gently nipping his lower lip.  “I want to spend that time fucking you as many times as possible in as many different ways as possible.”
But then he heard a burst of laughter which clearly Matt had tried to hold back but failed dismally, accompanied by Mary shouting “gross!  Guys, do that in your room!” and then Matt couldn’t help it, he was laughing outright, loud and long.  It was a beautiful sound and it filled both men with happiness.
Sam nodded.  “You honestly think she could keep that hidden?”
,” he had said, “
And really, he was.
“This….”  Matt looked up, eyes moving between Cas and Dean.  “Can I have this?”
Matt and Charlemagne looked up.  The sheer happiness in Matt’s dark eyes nearly sent both Castiel and Dean reeling.  He had changed so much since he’d been there.  Dean couldn’t find his voice for a moment, too overcome to find words.  He swallowed with some difficulty, and cleared his throat.  “You having fun?”
“We’ll see.  We’ll be checking in with Charlie and Bela from time to time.  Your behavior may or may not have a direct effect on the size of your present.”
“Great!  How was Italy?”
“You were wonderful.”
He couldn’t help but laugh and he put on the deep voice he had done years ago while posing for the artwork Cas had painted back in college for the Greek restaurant, his first real job.  “The great god Apollo shall grant your request.”
Cas headed off to the bedroom and Charlemagne immediately took his place, beginning to chatter away to Dean about his day at school.  Dean noticed that Matt was watching the little boy with an affectionate smile on his face, and it sent a pang straight to the man’s heart.  Matt really did have a soft spot for Chaz.  Mary, too.  Hell, he was really beginning to open up to Cas also, spending more and more time at his side as he worked on his art, the two talking for hours.  And Dean liked to think that he had a good bond with the boy as well.  Each and every day, the five of them were becoming more and more like a real family.  Dean didn’t know how he could get any happier unless Matt confirmed once and for all that he really truly wanted to be part of their family.  Not just stay for now, like he had said, and not even just to agree to stay permanently, like Dean was hoping for, but to say that he truly wanted to be part of the family.  Dean and Cas had told him he had a place with them if he wanted it, but so far Matt hadn’t even agreed to stay permanently….becoming a family member was still far too much to ask for.
Dean smiled.  “That sounds perfect.”
And as each verse went on, Matt improved, until he was nailing each and every move.  All nerves vanished, his confidence growing, his face filled with happiness.  Dean thought he would fly, seeing that joy there.
“Like you didn’t know that from the moment you met me.” Dean bumped their shoulders together.
Mary settled into position and gestured to Cas.  Tapping his foot, he quietly began counting down for her.  “One….two….one, two three, and…” His fingers sank into the keys, the song flowing forth, and Mary began to dance.
At those words, Matt’s head snapped up and he looked at Dean with huge eyes.  “You…..really??”
“Come on,” he broke away breathlessly to whisper the words.  “Hurry up.”
The bill was staggering, but it was worth it, for the entire meal had been amazing, and neither the food nor the experience was one that they could have back home.  They returned to their hotel stuffed and satisfied.
“And death place,” Cas pointed out.  Dean immediately clutched his chest as if in pain.
Those words sank in immediately, Matt’s eyes lighting up.  “He’s at Mary’s school?”
“Sorry.”  Moving to Dean’s side, Cas wrapped his arms around the man’s neck.  “Any way I can make it up to you?”
Castiel nodded in understanding.  “Sounds like a good plan.”  He smiled.  “Is Matt excited?”
Dean’s eyes narrowed at the sound of her voice.  “Mary.”
“That’s good.”
The words clearly hit home.  In seconds Dean was on Cas, straddling his waist, pinning Cas’ wrists to the bed.  “Well, then….” He leaned in to smile at Cas, their foreheads nearly touching.  “Better get to it.”
That made Dean smile.  “Yea.”  Then he frowned.  “I hope he decides to stay.  I don’t want him out there, homeless and selling himself.”
……their bed was covered in rose petals.
“Cas, what’s going on?”
“They were almost
Mary’s blue eyes widened, mouth opening to object.  “But I—“   but Dean was having none of it.
“Sure.”
It took several moments of goodbyes and some tears on Charlemagne’s and Mary’s part (they even got hugs from Matt!), but they eventually managed to get on their way to the plane.  They had bought first class tickets and the seats were spacious…plenty of room to stretch out their legs.
Mary looked to Matt again.  “Well, he stopped, so it’s hard to tell.  But he looked super good when I came in.”
Charlemagne looked up from his coloring book, eyes interested.  “What?”  Clearly he hadn’t heard a word.  Dean snorted.
Cas looked triumphantly at his husband.  “HA!”  Dean banged on the table with a fist.
“If it wasn’t for the wheel being on the right side, it would be fine.  But to be on the left side of the road with the wheel on the right side of the car?  What madness is that??”
“Guys, gross!”  Mary was making a face.  “You’re gonna scar Chaz!”
Charlemagne reached right between the two and tugged a film out.  “What’ve you got there, kiddo?”  Mary took the DVD from him and immediately groaned.  “Not again!”
“You really don’t mind?  Even with Matt?”
With another kiss, Cas shut off the light and lay back, tugging Dean into his arms.  It wasn’t long before they fell into a deep, contented sleep.
He could still sense Matt watching.  The fact that Matt chose to stay and watch the ballet rather than go with Mary, who he so clearly had a huge crush on, spoke volumes.  If Matt didn’t want to learn to dance, Dean would eat his ballet slippers.  Now he just had to figure out how to bring it up in a way that wouldn’t put Matt off the entire thing.
Mary chose that moment to make her presence known, having changed into her pajamas as she often did right after school.  “What?  We’re getting takeout?  But we only do that on Fridays!”
“Yea, so did I,” Dean grumbled.  “Apparently not.”
Dean didn’t need to hear it a second time.  His hands went to his tie, fumbling even worse than they had earlier that night when he had tried to put the damn thing on.  Cas, meanwhile, was as smooth as butter as he unbuttoned his shirt and slipped it from his shoulders, thoroughly conscious of the way Dean’s eyes were greedily devouring every inch of flesh as it was bared, and loving the attention.  Having Dean under his spell like this, distracted and scrabbling and a complete mess?  God, if THAT wasn’t a complete power trip.
.”  He looked around at all the girls.  “Who wants to go first?”
Dean smiled.  “Wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t.  Like I said last night, you’re always welcome, Matt.  We’d like to have you here as long as you want to stay.”
“Can we go home now?”
Matt felt anger beginning to seep into him.  “He’s working on a report for school.”
“I know.  It’s disgusting.”
Charlemagne nodded enthusiastically.  “Yeah!”
Matt did as told, sitting with his back to the wall and watching as Dean rose, moving to the counter.
Dean wasn’t sure what to make of that.  All he knew, knew for certain, was that this boy was special.
After the vow renewals, they had headed to the theatre to see a show.  The man at the ticket booth had smiled when he saw the flowers they wore.  “You’re just coming from the church?”  At their matching nods, he reached for one of two sets of tickets before him….the red ones.  “I take it you want to see
Dean, who had followed Mary to the kitchen, poked his head back into the bedroom.  “Are you two coming?  These disgusting eggs are going to get cold.  Then they’ll be even MORE disgusting.”
“Hey, you could always gag me,” Dean pointed out, turning onto his stomach so he could look at his husband.
Dean practically screeched to a stop, peering at the figure.  It was a boy, probably about Mary’s age.  He had dark, messy hair, and was wearing jeans so tight that they may as well have been painted on.  They were tucked into a pair of unlaced boots.  His shirt was too small for him, his stomach showing, and instantly the memories came flooding back: Dean when he was fourteen, standing in an alleyway in tight pants and a too small shirt, waiting for someone to come along and pay him for his time.  For now there was no doubt in his mind that that was what this boy was doing.
Lauryn’s brow furrowed, then realization sank in as to what was going on and her entire face wrinkled up in disgust.  “Ew!  Are you checking out my moms?”  Matt was bright red.
Dean was on all fours in an instant, ass in the air, presenting to Cas.  He heard the sharp intake of breath from behind him and flushed with pleasure knowing that Cas appreciated the view.  Moments later, a hand teased lightly over his backside, stroking lovingly, almost reverently.
.”  Dean’s voice was muffled in the pillow but the desire there was unmistakable.
“It really is.” Still, he yawned.  Cas turned in his arms, stroking back that honey colored hair that he loved so much, beginning to gray at the temples.
Matt looked nervous still, but there was determination in his nod.  He was decided.  “Yes.”
With a smile, Cas slipped from his remaining clothes and laid them over the chair.  He moved to Dean’s side, hand moving down to flick open the catches on Dean’s slacks.  The way Dean’s breath caught at the action was almost deafening in the silence of the room.  Cas leaned in to brush their lips together in a teasingly light kiss.  “Finish up,” he murmured.  Then he turned his back on Dean and headed to the bed.
“I know.  But he wants to.”
“No.  You are.”  He gave Cas another kiss, then realized the priest was still standing there.  He looked apologetically at the man.  “Sorry, father.”
Then a thought occurred to Matt and he frowned.  “What about Charlemagne?”  It was getting pretty late at night for the boy to still be up and about.
“Hey,” Mary tossed her hair in an over-exaggerated manner.  “Beauty like this takes time.”
“I don’t
“Are you kidding me??”
Castiel shook his head at the memory.  “You’re ridiculous.”
“Yup.  Cuz you’re laughing at me.”  Dean’s green eyes lit up as they focused on a belaying pin and he crossed the ship’s deck, seizing it and giving it a yank.  Nothing.  It didn’t move.  It was glued into its port.  “Goddammit!”  Castiel attempted to stifle his laughter but he wasn’t entirely successful.  Dean glowered at him.  “Hush, you.”
He would know in a minute.  He heard the car pull into the driveway, doors shutting as his family got out.  Anticipation filled him as he waited for them to come inside, for Cas to see what he did.
played (how Matt wasn’t completely sick of the film, they would never know).  Chaz was in Matt’s lap, snuggled up as close as could be, laughing happily as Matt held his tiny hands and clapped them through the motions of the hand-jive.
Mary smiled up at him.  “I love you, Two.”
Mary blinked at him in surprise, then burst into laughter.  “Yeah.  I think I can help you out.”
again.”  Dean let out a very undignified snort.  “And it’s all your fault.  Yours and One’s.”
It was honestly amazing that they had managed to keep Charlie away for more than a matter of days, but she had been very supportive of giving Matt his time to settle in.  Even so, the petite redhead was practically bouncing up and down, giving Matt a little wave.  “Hi, Matt!”
He patted her back, laughing breathlessly.  “Claire….can’t…breathe.”
“Yeah.”  Jared easily slipped into the task of helping unload the groceries.
Updates will still probably be slower than they used to be, but I'm going to try harder!
Dean sighed.  He knew he would have to answer this question a lot in the coming days.  “I saw him on the street the other night when I was driving home.  He’s homeless.”  He left out the part about hooking.  That was a secret Dean had kept about his own life, and he would let Matt keep it about his.  “I gave him a place to stay for the night and we offered him the opportunity to stay for good.  He’s accepted for the time being, but doesn’t want us paying for new clothes and such.  He wants to do it himself.  Hence the need for a job.”
Their shopping done, they headed to the register and checked out.  By the time they were done, the Prius was stuffed near to bursting with bags (they rarely took the Impala shopping….better not to risk spilling milk or dripping melted ice cream on the leather seats).
He entered the house as quietly as possible, knowing Charlemagne at least was asleep.  Cas, however, came barreling around the corner.
“Oh, I was thinking of washing a pair of these.”  He glanced up at Matt and saw that yup, the boy’s dark eyes were focused intently on the dance shoes.  “Hey….would you have any interest in learning to dance?”
“This leads me to the question portion.”  Mary looked expectantly at her father.  “Would you mind if we finished your birthday breakfast in the kitchen?  I’m not even sure if he’s still here but if he is, I want us to be there when he comes upstairs.”
“I’m sure you can.  Believe me, I grew up with a dad who was either drunk or never there, and I spent every day figuring out how to earn money to feed my baby brother.  So I know how you feel.  But I also know that it never hurts to accept help.”  Dean could see the emotions warring on Matt’s face so he said nothing more, turning away to make the bed.  Then Cas appeared at the foot of the stairs with pajamas.  “Ah!”  He accepted them and turned to Matt.  “Here.  You’ll probably be more comfortable sleeping in these.  If you don’t want to wear them, that’s fine, too.  And there’s a toothbrush there, also.”  He moved towards the stairs, gesturing.  “There’s a bathroom there, the lightswitch is here.  We’ll be making breakfast tomorrow morning and you’re more than welcome to join us, whether you decide to stay or not.”
Dean realizes drinking all of that scotch and water in less than an hour wasn't perhaps the best of ideas when his bladder starts threatening to explode just as Castiel decides to turn around and place his ass directly in front of Dean's dick. Great. Now he has to pee while he's hard. That's gonna be fun. He swallows to gather some courage, leans over Cas' shoulder and tells him he needs to go use the bathroom. When he turns around to face him, it takes all of Dean's restraint to not close the gap between their mouths, jank the other boy's pants down and take him hard, right there, on the dance floor.
So for some reason I ran into

or something from the Communications department?
"You mean you don't have it?" she didn't even wait for Dean to answer "It's a gay app, you create a profile and meet other guys through it"
And so, they stayed up until 2am getting to know each other. They shared childhood stories and talked about their families, and Dean learned Castiel had four brothers -all named after famous Angeles, because “religious parents, remember?”-, who were always fighting. And Dean had told him about Sammy, his genius little brother who was anything but little. He had mentioned his love of classical rock and promised Cas to check out Stravinsky's Firebird. The string of texts kept coming until, finally, fatigue beat them and they fell asleep with a promise to continue later the debate on whether the Les Mis 10th year anniversary concert was better than the 25th year anniversary (which, of course it was because Lea Salonga. And even if Castiel argued that she was also on the 25th, he was wrong because no one could ever beat Ruthie's vocals on Fantine's Arrest, and those were the facts).
His friends made fun of him for it. Of course they did, the assholes. They'd say Dean had become a pretentious organic coffee drinker and tease him about how love had made him a nerd. Dean didn't care. He was happy, in a way. Besides, he was already a nerd to begin with. He had just now found another nerd he liked to hangout with and stare at, and that was nice. He was happy. And really, that was all he could ask for.
"Well-yes, I suppose it could be arr-"

And there is no explanation for it either. Which, somehow, doesn’t make it worse. It just is. It hurts like hell, and he hates it, and he hates himself. But he’s learned to accept it.

of all things, on his texts. He leaves the fork on the plate and grabs his phone with both hands to answer.
He observed the outline of Cas' face, how straight his nose was, how the sunset's orange lights entering through the window made his eyes appear lighter than they were, how his lips moved slightly as he re-read a particularly dense paragraph... Dean would take another sip from his beer and wish it was those soft plump lips his own were touching instead of the cold glass of the bottle.
"So, Charlie is... um, stuck on traffic. She'll be right here."
Perhaps Dean is just trying to let him rest from their

Cas was on his way to Comparative Hebrew Literature, tapping replay on
He knows what he is doing is crazy, and there is a little voice in the back of his head screaming at him that this is not how their first kiss is supposed to happen, but right now, with Castiel's tounge inside his mouth and his hands wrapping around Dean's back, underneath his jacket, he just. Don't. Care.
how come Dean can borrow your rare old books and I can’t?
And so, the days pass. He wakes up, says 'Good morning' to Cas as D, has breakfast while texting him and heads down to class. In the afternoons, he has lunch with his friends, spends some time studying and then heads to the coffee house outside campus for a recharge. He tells himself it's because of the quality of the coffee and not because of the dark-haired boy who is usually sitting in a sofa on the corner reading a book and drinking some tea. That is just another perk, but Dean is actually there for the coffee. Really. When he runs into Castiel, he offers him a ride home and listens to him rant about the state of his research on the depictions of Eros in Herodotus' works. Half of the time he doesn't understand what he is saying, but he likes the sound of Castiel's voice and feels like the other boy lacks someone to talk about this. So he listens and walks him up to his dorm. After they say their goodbyes, he goes up to his own room, finishes whatever work he has left for the day, makes himself dinner and texts Cas until he falls asleep. Then he wakes up the next morning and does it all over again.
Dean's first instinct is to step in, punch the guy and take Castiel away. But he doesn't do that. Instead, he observes. He notices Cas is more relaxed than he would've if this was just some creep trying to pick him up. He is speaking to him, in a calm manner kind of unfitting for the environment they're in. Dean makes use of the fact that they haven't noticed his presence yet and approaches them quietly from the side, trying to ears-drop their conversation.
But behind all that, he knew. He
"Um..."  Dean cleared his throat. "Are you okay, man? Why you speaking in tongues?"
After a couple of years of completely ignoring each other, one night a couple of years ago, Jesse had sent him a text, and they began talking again, though after graduation they never saw each-other in person again. And they only talked sporadically, about two or three times a year, usually late at night.
The dark-haired boy turns over his shoulder to look at Dean's face.
Why D? Trying to prove a point?
knew was that it was Friday night and Cas was a hot college student with a hook-up app on his phone. He had to play the part.
"No." His voice is serious and tougher than Dean has ever heard it. "Everything has changed."
They walked along the empty streets, catching up. It was weird, yet still it wasn’t. Being in this place, with this person, after everything that had happened, after all they had been through (both together and separately) … It felt strangely familiar. Dean felt sixteen again.
. This was just temporary. He was convenient, he was there, and that’s why Dean talked to him. That was it. He was there, every week, because they had class together, and did their projects together, but that was it. The summer would come, and Dean would forget all about him, and move on with his life.
So Dean doesn't want him? So what. He's still young and somewhat passable. He can have sex whenever he wants. For example, right now, with this twink whose name he doesn't remember, but who's giving him a blowjob in the club bathroom. He's good at it, if only a little clumsy.
Is reading Argentinian short horror stories in my dorm while my roommate and his girlfriend snore impossibly loud considered a "big plan"?
And no, his heart doesn’t skip a beat and he doesn’t screenshot that “

Before leaving, he went visit Charlie and had lunch with her. While they were eating, he decided to check the app one more time before deleting it from his phone because he was going to spend 5 days in Lawrence, and that meant 5 days of having the gossipy and noisy people from his hometown watching every step he took. He couldn’t risk somebody finding out he had that only-for-gay-men app on his phone. Not that he was gay, he was bi, but to his father it was all the same and after that big fight they had during Dean’s senior year in high school, when he briefly dated a guy called Jesse before meeting Lisa… well, that was something he didn’t want to relive. He had played it off as ‘experimenting’ so his parents had let it go, but he knew they wouldn’t accept it if he officially came out to them. At least not his dad, he often wondered what his mom really thought about it, but she never said a thing.
"That's only 5 people to guess from, Dean. It's not that many, you know?”
Yep :)
“Ya think?” she asks, turning to Chuck, leaving Cas out of the conversation, and he mentally thanks her for that.
When enough time has passed and he is confident Castiel is fast asleep, he gets up careful not to wake him up, writes him a quick sorry-I-left-but-you-looked-so-cute-I-didnt-want-to-wake-you-up note, grabs his stuff and leaves. He ignores his friends' worried texts asking where he went and sends himself one that simply says "you kissed him", just in case he forgets tomorrow. He will answer to his friends later.
car. He then hears about the time Castiel spent in the army. He tells him about his uncle Bobby and his mom's apple pie. He also learns Cas chose theology as his first major because he was looking for God and thought that'd be a good way to find him -"It wasn't, really, but it made my parents happy and it was a good complement to the philosophy classes" he says. He even tells Cas about his panty kink and Cas doesn't laugh or look at him like he's lost his mind, he just tries to hide a yawn and says he would like to engage in panty-related activities in the future.
[Tue. 10:50 p.m.]
“You have a crush on him” whispers a voice on his right ear.
There is no goodbye. No excuse. No apology. It just is. Dean stops talking to him and that's okay. That was Dean’s choice. So it's not Cas' place to talk about him anymore.

[Tue. 10:48 p.m.]
“No fucking way” he felt his hand drop the burger he had been chewing to cover his open mouth before even realizing it.
Dean opens the Spotify link and starts playing the song.
He relives Cas' death almost every night, and there's nothing he can do to stop it. Nothing that would calm his pounding heart. Nothing to ease the feeling of guilt eating at his chest now that he gets to live after Cas is gone.
But, mysteriously, after that marvelous cup of coffee, Castiel didn't see Dean again for a really long time.
So they became friends. Cas and Dean. They would hang out, and have lunch together, and they knew each-other’s coffee order by heart, and Dean would go out of his way just to make sure Cas was alright and in his own dorm, and they would text up until 3:00 a.m. and since the moment they woke up in the morning, but Cas
"He's not..." Dean ran a hand through his face and turned his back to Castiel, praying he could hear Charlie's side of the conversation and trying real hard not to blush "The group project, Charlie! We had agree to meet today at my dorm?"
Dean blinks at the screen in utter disbelief. Did he  just... close the app? After what Dean had said?
Castiel smiled at him. "I know. Thank you."
“Ew, Charlie, don’t… And let me remind you, I’m bi, so I’m like… half straight” He checks to see if the teacher has arrived yet before continuing “But… I’m an awkward second-year, engineering student who calls his car ‘Baby’ and who dragged his best friend into an Ancient Greece course because he doesn’t want to be alone. I don’t have a snowball’s of a snowball’s chance with him!”
He has to honor Cas' sacrifice.
Ready to grow up and stop blaming his dad for everything wrong with him. The obsessed bastard is long gone. It stopped being John's fault several years ago. Dean is not a victim anymore. At least not his dad's.
He felt the whisper against his lobe more than he heard it, and smiled. Jesse smiled back, that wide, open smile, Dean remembered all too well.
K, bye, enjoy~
Dean wants to know more about Castiel’s charity work –because he once mentioned it in class and Dean was very intrigued about it, actually, Dean is very intrigued about this guy and he wants to know a whole lot of things about him, like if he can smile other than that sarcastic smirk he does when the teacher tries to be funny, if his big blue eyes shine with happiness when he does smile or if he’s even truly happy, ever. He wants to know whether or not he likes to cuddle and the sounds he makes when he comes and Dean is not the kind of guy who just stares at someone’s back for five weeks without doing anything about it but he’s also not the kind of guy who wonders whether someone prefers white or black chocolate… but when Castiel walks into the classroom wearing his usual trench coat and blue tie and locks –just for a second– his eyes on Dean’s before sitting in his usual spot just in front of Dean’s, and his stomach flips just a bit because he thought for a second that Castiel wouldn’t make it to class today, but he did and Dean’s
Although, I do admit it is strange, not knowing who you are…
None of his exes still talked to him. Not the ones that mattered anyway. They just used him and left, and came back when they were horny. But of course Dean was still friends with his ex. Because he was perfect, and who wouldn't want to be friends with him?
“What…? Who said I was seeing anyone? And who said it was a he?”
And Dean wanted to take another class with him, to keep seeing him regularly after the summer. Because they were
He stared blankly at his phone screen. Yeah, that was him, each and every one of the pictures, smiling or frowning, with other people or alone, in every one there was Castiel. Even the username was ‘Castiel’. There wasn’t much of a description just “Philosophy & Theology student. Talk to me ;)”. It was him. And he had used a winky face what the fuck
Kind of a song-fic? Not really, but a little bit. I was listening to Mamma Mia when typing this. Sorry not sorry.

I never said that was a bad thing.
Sure, they were together almost all of their time, and they were texting each other constantly, to the point where Cas would every day, without a fail, wake up to either a good-nigh or a good-morning text from Dean, and that always made him start his day off with a smile. Because he kept remembering what it felt to see Dean walking through campus, his hand in Benny’s, so far away from him. And the fact that he had now been on his crush-for-two-years’ bed (with all of his clothes on, obviously, but
Dean got up. “It’s getting late, I better head back”
Because he knew -he thought he knew- Dean would need more than just hanging out to make sure Cas was worth more than just a friendship. After all, Benny had been his first and only boyfriend, and they had been friends since the fourth grade. Heck, they even continued to be friends even after breaking up and Cas doesn’t know whether or not he should really feel
Dean's patience is being tested and his fist is starting to long for the punch he's
Half-way through their second year, Charlie mentioned that, "that dude you had a crush on, remember? Dean Winchester? Well, I heard that he's all lovey-dovey with his childhood friend, Benny. Super hot dude, kinda like a beard-type." And Cas felt a part of him die. Because the past tense was not completely appropriate here. A part of him still
"I guess it depends on how you translate it, really. It should be something among the lines of 'Take courage, my heart: you have been through worse than this'." he thought for a second before adding "or may be 'Be strong, saith my heart; I am a soldier; I have seen worse sights than this'" he started pointedly at Dean "Yes, that last one might be a better translation."
Once he is finally alone in the elevator, he restes his head against the metallic wall and lets out a breath he didn't know he was holding. He puts his headphones back on. Music has always helped him calm down. He had forgotten to pause the music, and Spotify had continued playing the sountrack album. The song playing now was "Voulez-vous". Seemed fitting for Dean's accelerated heartbeat. He opened his eyes. Did he really just tell Castiel Novak to visit him at his room?
The words still rumbled in his ears, even then, several minutes after arriving at his dorm.
And no point in trying to figure out your identity, either.
Will I see you at Purgatory tonight?
He had spotted his friends (Jo and Chuck, and
"Is it?"
By the time he started seeing Dean again (thanks to his winter semester requiring cross-campus sprinting at lunchtime), he was always holding hands with a muscly, bearded dude.
Love at Third Sight.
He kind of wishes he could believe it. But then he sees Dean, who he keeps treating him like his “bro” half of the time, but then as
“Guess it’s just you and me, brother” he said, raising his glass.
He arrived a bit late to class that day, and he knew Charlie wasn’t coming because she had a LARP event somewhere, so he just sat in the front row without taking a second glance at the other people in the room. That is why he didn’t notice who he was sitting right beside to. He scrambled to get his things out of his backpack as quickly as possible and intuitively turned to the person on his right to ask what they were doing today.
Sam brings up Cas' death more times than necessary for Dean's comfort. Why can't his little brother ever read the room when he's trying to suppress his feelings?
They spent about an hour there, mostly complaining about how tired they were because of school. It was nice, talking to Cas like this. Seeing he wasn't actually the perfect genius Dean had initially thought him to be. Sure, he was smart, but he still struggled through metaphysics in the same way Dean struggled with Python.
"Has it, Cas? You're already in a place like this. Dressed up like

Hello, D.
“Don't sweat it, kid. Besides, it's kind of entertaining. Now that Dr. Sexy is over forthe year, I need some new drama in my life” she shrugged, and they both laughed.
The way he had phrased his response seemed weird to Dean but he couldn’t quite pin-point why at first. After a couple of minutes, however, he realized what Castiel had meant. As the teacher walked them through the rudiments of Ancient Greek, Castiel was preoccupied leafing through a book that was quite obviously not the textbook for this class. And while Dean was trying to figure out the difference between the pronunciations of an i and a u, Castiel turned to him and smirked while telling him to “Now, read this” and opened a book filled with what Dean would have called ‘doodles’ two minutes ago but now he knew was Ancient Greek.
This fic can be set to both versions of the song. The more produced Jack one. Or Sia's stripped down version. Whichever you prefer is fine. I think Sia's gives reflects better sad!dean's feelings, but Jack's drums are a very explicit metaphore for his heart anxiously pounding. So... make of that what you will.

When it takes Dean a couple of hours to answer “lol”, he starts doubting his conviction that nothing could change in
Castiel opened his mouth slightly, as to say something, but he didn't. Dean realised what he had said and was quick to add:
So he goes to the bar instead. Because it's convenient. Not because every time he drags his body there, he's secretly waiting for that bright smile to be waiting for him at a table.
“You're not actually letting that snorky asshole ruin our night, are you?” he practically
The dark-haired man tilted his head slightly to the side and kept staring at Dean, frowning. He could see him from the corner of his eye and silently wished he’d stop because his cheeks kept getting redder.
"Oh. That sucks, man. The thing with your roommate, I'm sorry." He gave Castiel a simpathetic look, knowing that the library was not an option as it was closed at this hour because it wasn't finals week yet and they only opened it 24 hours on finals week. "You know what? I live on the third floor, and I don't have a roommate, so I've got some unused extra space. If you ever need a place to read, you can come over"
[Thu. 11:12 p.m.]
He still knows Dean hasn’t texted him in five days now. But at least he won’t have to
He ended up telling Jo everything, and she promised she wouldn’t say anything, though she did post pictures of them with little heart emojis in her Snapchat story for all of hers and Deans’ childhood friends to see. That included Benny, which made Cas’ wicked side smile because, well… just ‘cause. He liked Jo.
“Jesus! You’re pissed. What on earth did the guy do to you?” Jo asks, grinding as she gets the popcorn bag from the microwave and serves it in a bowl.
"Well, that clears it up!" Dean joked, ironically. Did Cas really expect that to help? "The hell does it mean?"
And that friendship started to slowly include other people from Dean's life. Like his childhood friend, Jo, who –about a month into their new friendship- started to tease him about his feelings towards Dean. Though, by then, Cas was already an expert in laughing it off and playing dumb.
[Thu. 9:44 a.m.]
He looks down at the kneeling boy in front of him and makes a conscious effort to make himself cum quickly. He low-key just wants to get this over with so he can go home already. Wherever that is.
"I'll tell Charlie too! She's... um, she's my friend, who's in the group project with us."
He didn’t want to admit out loud that Dean didn’t read something other than Busty Asian Beauties and what was necessary to keep a somewhat decent GPA and that he called Cas a freak for carrying around García Lorca books. Or that he was

would make Dean laugh, they were gone. Chuck’s dorm was on the same direction as his and somehow Jo had convinced both of them to go and leave Dean behind. One day, Jo’s convincing powers would frighten him. Today was not that day.
Are you taking Latin, as well?
And he did. it was soft and slow, unlike most music Dean listened to, but it had an interesting beat to it. The singer's voice was unlike anything he had ever heard before, and accompanied by only a piano for most of the song. The lyrics were simple but, "this song reminded me of you" that was what Castiel had said. Damn, and Dean had thought he was thirsty. Or is he imagining things? Come to think about it, the song actually has a kind of low-key sad vibe to it. He needs to figure out what this "reminded me of you" thing is about. He is getting tired of not knowing what's going on, with his feelings, with Cas. If this is Castiel's way of telling him to go fuck himself, then so be it. He'd rather face it head on than let it slide and keep pretending like the other boy is as involved in this whole texting thing as he is.
The ride home was quite pleasant. He had put on a classic rock mixtape on his dad’s old Impala and tried to prepare mentally for what was in store. Lawrence could be the perfect place to get recharged with all the family quality time and that good old small town charm that somehow managed to make the days longer, but at the same time it could be emotionally exhausting, especially with his family. So he relaxed, and sang along to some Kansas as he finally entered Kansas.
"I wasn't. Well, clearly." he gestured at himself, awkwardly.
Castiel looks at where Dean is pointing, then quietly looks around them and finally says:
But he still has the silent promise that everything will go back to normal once they’re in the same time zone again. So he holds on to that, and ignores the whole in his stomach when yet another humid night passes without a goodnight text from Dean.
“There’s no one. Not really”, he added, looking at Jesse “Just this dude I like… but, it’s not gonna happen.”
And with that they all turned they attention to the series again. But Dean’s mind kept thinking, what if…
He sighed, passed a hand through his face and got up. He was already late for calculus.
“We’ll meet you back here in thirty minutes” said Charlie as Jo dragged her across the dancefloor to the entrance of Heaven “…make that forty!” She almost yelled so they could hear between the people and the noise.
in his room, being hot and not talking to him. After the fifth visit, however, things started to change.
"Yes," he says, his eyes roaming up and down Castiel's face, not quite believing that this is real, that he is real. "Yes! Yes, Cas. I will never lie to you again, Cas. I promise, I won't. I..."
Dean kept quiet.
I do not know how to wish on an arbitrary number, D.
"Aww. Ain't he a little angel?" he said to himself, quietly.

He tells Cas about the time he and Sam had engraved their initials in his dad's car -now
"Yo! Man, wake up!"
After packing some T-shirts and typing the beginning to some reports he had due next week, Dean finally lay in his bed at midnight and took his phone. He opened the app and created a profile. It had an easy-going layout. It showed you pics of the guys who had it that were near to you and if you wanted to you could talk to them. Some guys talked to him and he had some easy conversations until a weirdo send him a totally-fake-but-not-that-he-looked nude so he closed the app and went to sleep.
“What if I do?” he replied, almost subconsciously.
"I wasn't... I. Uh."
Dean and his friends go to Purgatory. After everyone ditches him, Dean decides to let himself enjoy the party. Fuck it.
shut up, you know I’m kidding
"We're going what?" asked a sleepy Castiel, rubbing his eyes.
But Cas didn't know that yet. For now, he drank his vodka, took out his phone and followed the band on Spotify, telling himself he'd give them a chance. See if he liked them enough to buy a ticket.
When Castiel lowers one of his hands to grip Dean's butt and gets away from his lips to start nipping at his neck, Dean can't help the way he moans "Fuck, Cas" into his ear. He's waited months for this. For the firm warmness of those hands gripping him tight, for the softness of Castiel's black hair tangled between his fingers, for the string of kisses and bites and hickeys he's planting from Dean's neck down to his shoulder...

“Alright, sorry. The ‘Love of his life’” She emphasizes the words with an exaggerated eyebrows raise and Dean groans, rolling his eyes and regretting the moment he let any thoughts about Castiel past his lips.
[Tue. 10:53 p.m.]
Dean was 80s Classic Rock. Castiel was indie alone in his dorm by day, and house music at night, surrounded by sweaty strangers and preferably high out of his mind. Electronic pop rock seemed like a nice middle ground.
“What excuse? There’ll be no excuse. I know why he has that app and he’d know why I have it, and then it’d be awkward… besides, there’s that group project we still haven’t done.”
[Thu. 11:10 p.m.]
He sees Jo a couple of times over the summer, and makes a conscious effort not to ask her about Dean. Sure, he still cries when he sees the Facebook photo where a smiling Dean was tagged by his mother. And he still 'likes' said picture, even though Dean hasn't spoken to him in a month now. But he still has

He was introduced to Dean's family as a friend, because that was all he was. All he could ever hope to be.
"Oh, don't worry. I didn't see you either." Answered Castiel, sheepishly pointing at the book he held in his right hand.
And, yeah, that hadn’t been nice, running into his

Dean stared at the screen. Damned if that guy was anything but blunt. But then again, if some rando started texting him and saying he liked him, Dean might also want some answers. He pondered his answer and finally settled for honesty. It wasn’t like they were actually going to talk in person anyway.

Hope you guys like it :)
Later that evening, when he was getting ready to go out, a particular text he got
about something that mattered. They joked, they showed each other funny videos, and interesting rock bands and new restaurants they had found and… that was pretty much it.
When Castiel stopped answering that night, Dean assumed he had fell asleep and decided to do the same himself.
“Yeah... Plus, if you count in the last names that start with a 'D' that'll add Díaz and Denis in.”

Well, they never really got to it. Because even though Castiel never noticed, despite their excessive talking, they never
It was Dean who got him into Muse.
The air thickened around them as he looked at Cas straight in the eyes and licked his lip. By now his dick was doing all the thinking for him but he didn't really care. Because in that moment, Castiel was right there, all big eyes, disheveled hair, undone tie, stupid trench-coat and all. And he had flirted back at Dean, which meant he was at least willing to fuck him, which wasn't exactly what Dean looked to accomplish here but

“Well, he did say he was waiting for a date when we arrived, remember?”
“Fuck, you’re hot” he lets out on a breath.
“I wanna go to Heaven” She answered, looking at Charlie with a pout.
Cas’ heart skips a bit and he stops walking for just a second, just enough for Jo to notice. Jo notices everything. He hunches even further, but he takes out his phone and tries to pretend he’s not listening, not interested in the conversation. He does not want to be hearing this.
Don't bother, it's trash

"Yes, it is." He looked up at Dean with wide open eyes but quickly squinted them as he analyzed Dean's face. "What's the matter?" He placed the laptop on the bed, stood up and took a step towards Dean. "You don't think what you have done is good?"

It takes him a minute to process the coldness of the door against his back. When he finally does, and fumbles to open it while Castiel is nibbling at his neck, Dean admits to himself that he has never been gladder for being a nerd, who likes Greek culture and thought taking an Ancient Greek course was a good idea.
Dean licked his lips. And turned to look at the sunset once again. He should head home soon or he’d be late for dinner and his parents would start wondering what friend he had been with that it had taken him so long to get back home.
The nights start getting colder, and Dean doesn't know if it's the actual weather or just the absence of Castiel's grace, no longer running through his veins every time he has a bad dream.
The short bearded dude with a round face and a receding hairline had approached their table about 15 minutes after Castiel sat down.

"What are you doing?" Dean hears Castiel's deep voice.

After anxiously switching apps for another minute, Dean settles for staring at their chat, waiting for something to happen.

where it’d be. He hated it that his first experience with love had to be in a hidden crumbling building in a hidden crumbling town and not eating ice cream in the mall like every other teenager’s. But then again, he kind of loved that they had found this secret spot in the middle of nowhere and made it their own.
"Dude! It's alright." Dean was smiling. "You are welcome here. Just, try to text or something next time, you know, give a guy a warning."
By the time Cas moans "I love you too, Dean" into his ear, he starts to think that perhaps, after all, it was.
Dean's dorm wasn't as reflective of his personality as Castiel's was. At least, Dean himself didn't think it was. All of his posters and most memories where in his parent's house in Lawrence. Besides his bed, desk and unfinished robots from past semesters, his dorm contained only an old turntable with some second-hand records and a few frame-less pictures of his family taped to the wall. He had been at school for a couple of years now, but he still didn't feel completely at home there. Hell, his

He still wanted to believe Dean was demanding Cas went to the concert with him, even if he hadn't listened to that band before. Even if it wasn't true.
“Is that… Do you think that’s why he wanted us to leave? So he could have a date with his bald grandpa?”

What’s important is this: Castiel is in love with Dean Winchester.

"I am... It's me, Cas! I am. I am D." He is breathing quickly now. "I'm so sorry I lied to you, man. I didn't know what to do." He is desperate now. He wants Cas to understand. He
It was then that Dean realised Castiel wasn't wearing his usual dark suit and trench coat combo. His torso was covered by a body-fitting gray T-shirt and a loose pair of sweatpants hung from his hips, showing oh so slightly his left hipbone. And no, that did not make Dean salivate and wish to drop to his knees right then and ther. Not at all. He licked his lips unconciously.
Castiel asks D if he wants to come in. He explains his roommate is spending the weekend at his girlfriend’s. Dean gulps. He doesn’t know what to do. He tells Castiel that much. He laughs. They laugh. Neither of them knows what they’re doing. They have plenty of reasons to not trust people. To not trust one another. Yet they continue to do so.
By the time he desperately touches himself while wearing Cas' shirt that he never returned and somehow still smells of the shorter boy's bed, he begins to doubt his control over his feelings and the overall situation. When he cums and cries immediately afterwards, he finally admits to himself that he's gone, that this whole "what's the worst thing that could happen?" thing has finally happened and is getting out of control. But then he gets a text from Cas recommending a new book to him and he smiles. He wipes away the tears, cleans up the mess and hugs the shirt as he imagines its owner is wearing it. God, he is so fucking gone.
Are we friends now?
Well, anything I say can and WILL be used against me so, I’d rather remain silent, thank you very much
"You were walking and reading at the same time?" Dean asked with a raised eyebrow, trying real hard to not be impressed. "Isn't that like the 1800's version of texting and driving?"
“No chick flick moments” they both said at the same time, and this time it was Jo's turn to roll her eyes.
[Tue. 10:57 p.m.]
If it's the thought of blond hair and green eyes that finally makes him cum, it doesn't matter either. He bass is buzzing in his ears and he only sheds one tear this time. He'd be proud of himself if he could tell. If he was
The song is great tho
because he has beautiful green eyes and you don’t
The silence in the room was almost unbearable. Dean knew he had fucked up. He just wanted to know exactly how much. That is why he had asked Jo to meet him for lunch. He told her everything that had happened, since the first text he had dared to send Castiel as "D" to the not-at-all awkward conversation they had on their dorm hallway just the night before, to the chain of texts that followed. He generally liked Charlie better for discussing his love life with, but Jo had grown up with him and, therefore, had the advantage of knowing him even better than he knew himself. So it was her he turned to when he needed to figure out something. And right now that was what he needed. Figure out just how much he had screwed up.
That's a risk he'd like to willing to take.
"I apologize. I was just wondering..." he cleared his throat, "you really didn't know that was from Homer?"
Really.
Enjoy!
Dean turned to face Castiel who sat with the laptop over his knees focused on reading what Dean had written.
I suppose there is no point in trying to get you to type my full name every time you address me.
"So... did you read the articles I sent you?"
bullshit he’d been lying to himself about for years, that he forgot to notice the important things. And the important things weren’t memorizing each other’s coffee order, nor hanging around an absurd amount of time together. Those were superficial things. Just like how good a bit of stubble looked on Dean’s face or how he always teased Cas about his heritage.
on Dean, on the deep green of his eyes and the black of his leather jackets, of his Impala, of the smiles he sometimes dropped too quickly, when he thought no one was watching.
I think he likes you too, btw
[Tue. 10:49 p.m.]
He feels Cas' body relax under his arm and lean closer to him, as he stands straight and stares down at the blonde guy, who gives Dean a once-over before huffing and saying:
Dean winked as he walked over to his mini-fridge.
the main reason he’s doing this. He
Actually, I do. My full name might not be conventional, but is the one with which I have been identifying myself for the past 20 years.
"Don't sweat it, Cas." Dean smiles, patting him on the shoulder "Come on, let's dance!"
His voice is deep as usual, if only slightly agitated. He is breathing rapidly.
old.”
You haven’t send me a dick-pic yet. That speaks wonders of you in this app.
[Thu. 10:52 p.m.]
"What?" he asked, though he obliged and got up to put his phone on silent mode, still refusing to open the messages app "And what the fuck's a Grindr? Whatcha talking about?"
: spotify:track:2bZNwQvu1GQn0DvytrSwUx
“I, uh... translated it to modern English?” Dean offered, with a smile.
When he gets to New York and instinctively texts Dean a picture he took of a drag queen sitting next to an orthodox Jew on the subway with the caption “There’s no place like home”, he thinks the next two weeks will fly by, that he’ll be texting Dean the whole time anyway, and he’ll be back before the other boy even notices he’s gone.
Castiel examined Dean's face for a moment
I see…
“Why not? He straight?”
And they have class together the next day.
“Yeah… Well, guess who has a profile on it?” he said turning his phone so she could see.
Maybe he had inhaled something in the lab, Biology students are sometimes messy. Maybe someone left something toxic open and he had been hallucinating because there was no way on Earth that... wait, did Castiel remember his name?
. It's alright." He doesn't say anything else for a few seconds and kind of just stand there, on his boxer briefs, and he's half-hard.
“She’s teaching you to read Greek”. He finally said in a deep voice that did things to Dean’s southern body parts that he wouldn’t want to admit out loud.
“I mean...” she sighed and looked up at him. “He's smart, we know that. So it shouldn't be that difficult for him to guess D's identity... But also there's Daniel... Douglas and then you” Jo added, counting on her fingers and looking pointedly at Dean to make sure she had gotten the names right.
He hopes that even in the darkness of The Empty, Castiel knows or feels or remembers that Dean loved him too.
"You think Achilles was hot?"
It’s just two weeks. What’s the worst thing that could happen in just two weeks?
"Common? No. Slut? Eh."
Dean smiles a guilty smile, like saying "yep, hi" with his face
Castiel smiles with all his teeth. This is the first time Dean is seeing this free, open smile, in him. He makes a mental note in the back of his drunken head to try and make it happen more often.
“Well, no… but what does that have to do wi…?”
How do you know who I am, or what I’m reading?
He hates that she’s right even if she didn’t say a thing because she implied he’s a coward and she’s right and he hates that. Because he is a fucking coward and he’s going to end up being the drunk uncle for Sammy’s kids because he’ll never find someone who wants him for something more than a one-night-stand because, sure, if he wanted to he could find a way to get in Castiel’ pants –because he’s Dean Winchester and he always gets in everybody’s pants if he wants to– but he doesn’t want to do just that. He wants to know things about him and wants to call him Cas and wants to have him whispering in dead languages in his ear and he has never been that close with anyone since Lisa and… that didn’t end up very well, and his self-esteem is beyond fucked up and he just wouldn’t dare to do something about the massive crush he has on Castiel because he’s way out of his league and he’s not going to embarrass himself. Just no.
It is very pleasant to the eyes.
. They don’t ever make plans together anyway. They just… are. Dean and Cas.
“What do you think?”
Dean watched Castiel tie the broom flowers about his arm, feeling as if he were floating in a dream.  Then those beautiful blue eyes turned their smile in his direction and Dean was overwhelmed with love.  He took the second bunch of broom flowers from Cas and tied them about Castiel’s left arm. He noticed that quite a crowd was gathering, people who had been viewing the church, but he didn’t care.  He was also vaguely aware that several were taking pictures, one in particular.  Dean realized the man was a professional who Castiel had paid.  Dean’s smile only grew.  Leave it to Cas to think of everything.
Dean waved the words away with one hand.  “Eh, Cas would understand.”
Matt was silent, simply looking at Dean.  His dark eyes were shiny now with tears that he was trying so hard to fight.  “What do you want from me,” he asked at last, voice tiny and broken.
“Hey!  Behave like ladies!” Dean attempted to sound stern but knew he failed pathetically, especially when he saw the looks the girls gave him.
He was taking a chance and he knew it.  Sure, Matt might like to come just for the company, but Dean thought it was more than that.  He had seen the way Matt’s eyes lingered not just on the girls, but on his shoes as he put them on.  He would wager good money that Matt was developing an interest in dance.
That was it.  Dean had to go over there and see what was going on, for there was no WAY Sam hadn’t known they were there, hadn’t come there to see them.  “I’m gonna go say hi.”  He gave Cas a nudge.  “Scoot.”
“Oh you were, were you?” Ellen shot Dean a teasingly evil look.  “And are you doing my hiring now?”
Matt was staring.  That in itself wasn’t so surprising.  He had been staring at her ever since he had arrived.  No, what was surprising is that she was standing there, clad head to toe in skin-tight clothing, and he was staring at her face.  Obviously he had seen the whole ensemble, taken it in and enjoyed it, but her eyes were what captured him.
Dean took a long swig from his water bottle, delighting in the refreshing coolness.  He watched Matt where the boy sat on the floor, taking off his dance shoes.  “You know, I think you’re ready to begin working with a partner.”
“We’re going, we’re going!” Dean called.  He spared one final glance for the living room where Matt was watching the two men leave, a wide smile on his face.  Dean couldn’t help but grin.  Matt was happy.  So far in the nearly four months Matt had lived with them, Dean and Cas hadn’t hidden their relationship at all, but they had tried to keep the blatant physicality to a minimum so as not to put the boy off.  Now it seemed as if such things wouldn’t bother Matt at all.
They had stopped right beside Anne Hathaway’s Cottage, the early home of Shakespeare’s wife.  It was lovely, a picturesque little cottage.
It was a nice little place where the river branched off slightly, and slim tree limbs arched overhead, dappling the water in shade.  Dean set down his oar and looked to his husband.  “So?”  He arched a brow.  “You’ve got me alone.  What is it you’re plotting?”
Matt stared at Charlemagne in surprise and nearly laughed.  After fighting to gain computer time, now the kid didn’t want it.  “You’re all done?”  Charlemagne nodded.  “Then sure.”  He scooped Matt’s books into his arms.
“Today was perfect,” Dean whispered into the curve of Cas’ throat.  The brunette felt warmth filling him at the words.
“You’re welcome.”  She was attempting to look irritated with him but it wasn’t really working anymore, and a smile broke free.
Cas burst into fresh laughter.  Dean merely shook his head.  “Sorry, babygirl, this trip’s just One and I.”  He smiled at his husband with eyes full of love.  “Should’ve taken him YEARS ago.”
Cas stared, trying to form words.  Finally, his mouth twitched into a smile.  “Clearly you’re excited.”
Dean looked up at the church towering over them.  “Holy Trinity?  I thought we were going tomorrow morning!”
The little boy looked up at Matt, his eyes wide, lower lip trembling, and Matt felt such a deep surge of hatred for the librarian.  How dare he make Charlemagne feel this way.  “Chaz, stay right where you are.”  He stepped forward, getting right up in the man’s face.  “You leave him alone.  This kid is going to stay at the computer until he finishes what he’s doing.  If he wants to sit there and play games for three hours, that’s what he’ll do.  He checked the computer out, and now it’s his.  So how about you go find someone else to bother?  This kid is off limits.”
As always, he blushed to see her.  “Hey.  Hi…..Chrissy?”
Mary had disappeared into the kitchen to collect the napkins, red pepper and parmesan cheese. Now she returned, grinning.  “Like you don’t know, Danny Zuko.”
Matt had proved a difficult shopper.  He clearly felt guilty about having things bought for him and kept trying to pick out what was cheapest, though they were clearly not things he liked.  It took a while before Dean was able to suss out the boy’s taste and manage to convince him to try some things on.  In the end they had only bought a few things.  It would take a lot of convincing to get Matt to let Dean take him on a REAL shopping trip.  Convincing and trust.
Dean nudged the door open with his shoulder, tray in his hands.  Mary was buried under the covers, that head of messy blonde hair barely visible.  “Oi.”  There was a tiny grunt, and he chuckled, setting the tray down on her bedside table.  “Wake up, sleepyhead.”
“Your other shoes are still in working order, right?”
That brought a smile to Dean’s face, though it was a somewhat tremulous thing, and he nodded.  “Yea.”
A tiny little pang struck Dean’s heart and he couldn’t help the goofy smile that spread across his face.  “Remember the world map you hung on my wall in high school?  We’d mark off places we wanted to travel to?”
Dean couldn't believe what he was hearing. "Badass?" he echoed.
The big Cajun laughed.  “Sorry, brother, but I’m taken.  And I think your own husband would be fairly upset if he knew you were proposing to me.”
Matt nodded again.  “I think so.”
God, if that wasn’t heartbreaking.  “I know, baby.  But we won’t be gone long.  And you’ll have the rest of your family here with you.”
Dean had to fight hard to stifle his laughter.  “Well, ‘okay’ is better than nothing, I suppose.”  He added another sentence to his current manuscript.  Matt perked up at the sound of typing.
Dean felt ridiculously proud, considering Matt wasn’t his trueborn son.  He was so distracted watching Matt smile as he talked with the customers that he almost didn’t hear Ellen’s next words.  “He’s a great kid.”
Cas looked into those beautiful green eyes that he loved so much and smiled.  “Yeah.  You?”
“Okay.”
Their third day in London was rather different than the first two.  They didn’t go to a single art museum.  Instead, they opted to spend the day exploring the Tower of London.  Bela, being both a major history nut AND British, had threatened them with bodily harm if they didn’t stop by for at least a few minutes.  Not that she really had to; both had been interested in going.  There was so much wonderful history there.  This was where so many fascinating individuals had been imprisoned and (generally) put to death, people such as Sir Thomas More and Anne Boleyn.  Dean was particularly interested in the crown jewels.  Not in the items themselves, but their history.
“Really, Chaz?” Cas asked.  “
Cas shook his head with a sigh.  “You never do.”  He ignored Dean’s indignant “hey!”, turning instead to their daughter.  “You’ll be home around 5:30?”
Mary nodded.  “Definitely.”
Castiel laughed, slipping his arms around Dean’s waist and holding him tight, smiling as the tourist instructed “now, say ‘cheese’!”
“Okay.”
“What
“Hey!”  Dean looked to his husband with huge, indignant eyes.  “Are you saying that this is MY fault?  That she’s only obnoxious because of ME??”  Cas shrugged.
At last, the boy nodded, a shaky jerk of the head.  “Okay.”
The British Museum was amazing.  Cas’ favorite style of art always had been the Pre-Raphaelites.  Dean had no clue what he was talking about when he said that, but as soon as he saw the paintings, he understood.  John Everett Millais’ ‘
She beamed at him.  “You look awesome!”
“No.  But you ARE a dork.”
Cas nodded immediately.  Dean chuckled at the eagerness.  “Good.”  With one last kiss, he rose from the bed.  “Then let’s get ready and head down to breakfast.”
She smiled.  “I always do.”
Dean smiled at Matt.  “Matt’s going to start working with a partner.”
Hand in hand, they walked along the river Thames, heading back towards the hotel as the sky darkened overhead and the stars lit up the night.
Both men had agreed that they definitely wanted to go here.  It was literally like one big giant thrift store for absolutely anything and everything under the sun.  There was a shop full of nothing but antique sewing machines.  One store had an old-fashioned showgirl dress in the window.  Another displayed books (they spent a lot of time in that one).
Charlemagne stared up at them, eyes huge.  Dean put a reassuring hand on his head, despite the fact that he was equally lost.  “What’s going on?”
.  They’d have to change that.
“And you love me.”
“Oh yea, Mary.  He’s really scarred.”
Matt seemed to be struggling for words.  “….I….”  Finally, he settled for a very simple “…thanks.  For…..all of this.”
Mary reached to the tray, for the wildflower Cas had placed there.  She plucked it from its vase and tucked it behind her ear, smiling at her fathers.  “Thanks, Things.”
“Shut up.” He gave his ass a little wiggle.  “And fuck me.”
, that eyebrow drove him wild.  Cas slapped Dean’s hip.  “Hands and knees.”
“….you’ll be calling to talk to us too, right?”
“No.”  The answer was immediate.  Dean let out a long, slow breath.  “I got this.”
“You know I do.”  Dean always loved it when Cas brought out the glasses and tie and put on the ‘Sexy Book Editor’ fantasy.  “But let’s save it for when we get home.  For now, I just want my husband.”
“You can
The male librarian, Johnathan apparently, started guiltily.  Obviously he wasn’t expecting to be caught.  “Just trying to sort out a little problem here.”
“Oh you are, are you.”  Those blue eyes were amused.
.  Charlie came away victorious after several rounds, but it had been close.  Matt really was good.
Somehow this had all caught Dean by surprise.  It shouldn’t have.  Somehow they had made it to their third day in London without having sex.  Honestly he was shocked he hadn’t jumped Cas their first night there.  Jet lag, he supposed.  But this here, in Stratford-upon-Avon, after Cas had done such a beautiful thing, planned out the whole vow renewal here where Shakespeare had lived, just for Dean….his eyes burned with hot pinpricks of tears, and he was overwhelmed with love for his husband.
Mary grabbed Matt’s arm, tugging.  “C’mon, Matt, let’s go find a menu!”
Matt looked back and forth between the men once more, utterly at a loss.  Cas grinned at him.
“Ah.”  Sam watched Matt take down another order, gathering menus and returning to the kitchen, and he smiled at his brother.  “You done good, Dean.”
He seemed nice, if shy around Mary.  If he moved in, they would have to be careful about that.  Having a teenage boy in the house with their daughter could prove interesting, but just from watching them right now, it didn’t seem it would be a real problem.  Still, it was a situation they would have to keep an eye on.
Cas nodded but Charlie barely even seemed to notice, immediately at Matt’s side with a stream of questions about his favorite games, characters, etc.  Cas shook his head with a smile, then noticed his husband staring at him with disbelief.  “…..what.”
“And he adores Mary.  Or so I hear.”
But Matt didn’t seem bothered at all.  He merely bit back a laugh at Mary’s reaction.  Cas looked at the boy, eyes sparkling in amusement.  Then he took Dean’s hand in his and gave it a gentle squeeze.
“Oh, come ON!”
Dean was struggling to get his laughter under control.  “Cas….did you…did you do this?”
Dinner had been fairly basic—spaghetti with meatballs—but it had been good.  They had praised Matt’s cooking and he had naturally blushed, as he was prone to do.  Chaz very proudly told them that he had helped roll the meatballs and they had praised him as well.  Now, thoroughly stuffed, they had adjourned to their room for the night to give the kids some space while they began planning their trip.
Matt seemed reluctant to answer.  Finally, he spoke up, voice barely audible.  “First time,” he whispered.
They reached the high school right as the closing bell was ringing.  It was then that Dean realized that he had absolutely no idea where he was supposed to meet Cas….where the art room was, or the teacher’s lounge, or anything.  “Shit.”
“I was hoping.”  Honestly, Dean was disappointed.  He thought Ellen would respect Matt more than that.
“No one EVER does Titus.  NO ONE.”
Castiel kissed Dean’s head.  “Good.”  Dean looked up at him, eyes darkening ever so slightly.
Dean nodded, shoving his chair back and rising.  “Be back in a few.”  At the top of the stairs, he knocked gently on the doorframe.  “Matt?”  There was no answer.  “Matt, I’m coming down.”  He headed down the stairs slowly so as not to burst in on Matt, but he needn’t have worried….the boy was just sitting on the edge of his bed, that shaken look still on his face.
A memory tickled at his brain.
Mary clearly felt the same thing, for her face dissolved into the most beautiful smile.  “Of course I will.”  She looked to Dean.  “Start it from the beginning?”
Dean leaned in and stole another kiss.  “Yea.”  He smiled.  “Let’s go see what our kids cooked for us.”
Those pale cheeks were bright red.  “I….thanks.”
“Okay, guys, pick out what you want and we’ll call it in.”
“He LOVES
“We’re framing it,” he murmured.
“Okay, we’ll be there in a minute!”  They could hear her footsteps retreating down the hallway.  Cas looked to his husband.  “Shall we dress and go?”
Mary dumped her bookbag into one of the empty chairs.  “Hey, Matt!”
“Hey!” Jared glared at the phone.  “Dad!”
“Yea.”  Dean finished changing into his pajamas and crawled into bed beside his husband, turning out the lights on his way.  He curled close to Cas, needing comfort.  “I couldn’t just leave him, Cas.  I couldn’t.”
Dean hadn’t realized just how pale the boy was until that moment when Mary’s words made him blush, that ivory skin going crimson.  He stammered, trying to find words, but none came.
remember. Dean pulling him offstage, hands roaming Castiel’s body, stroking his face in an effort to calm him. Then, once the anger had faded from Cas' face, Dean could hold it back no longer: the laughter bursting forth.
Matt looked from Dean to Mary and back again, extremely indecisively.  He chewed his lower lip anxiously as he thought.  Finally, he shook his head.  “I’m gonna stay here.”
“Definitely.”
Dean nodded.  “Extremely.”
“Shush.”  Dean paused, thinking.  “Nah.  We’re gonna get takeout.”
The two men undressed each other, wandering hands caressing bare flesh as they helped one another into their pajamas and crawled into bed.  Dean’s face ached from smiling so much, his heart filled with so much happiness. He curled close to Cas, the smile staying on his face even after he had fallen asleep, all through the night.
Mary pouted, but it was easy to see that she saw the sense in it.  “I understand it but I don’t have to like it.”
“Half a minute!”
“Thank you.”
“Take your pants off.” Castiel’s voice was firm, the words a clear order.
Castiel was beginning to look increasingly nervous at Dean’s lack of response.  “….Dean?”
“Hey,
Dean and Cas were home when he arrived, Mary shut away in her room.  “Hey, guys.”  Cas scooped Chaz into his arms, spinning him around and delighting in the giggles that resulted.  Then he noticed the shaken look on Matt’s face and his brow creased in worry.  “Matt, are you okay?”
Cas’s lips curved into what was probably the first genuine smile he’d had in days. “Me too.”
He swears the next few moments were some of the longest in his life until that door opened and time stopped altogether, his entire world swallowed by two seas of blue.
“Anything for the birthday boy,” Gabe said, then leaned forward. “Seriously: anything.” He winked.
All of Cas’s worry rushed out of him. Rolling his eyes, he went to unlock the door.
“Very well. Tell Sasquatch I said hello.”
Cas whistles. “Certainly a step up from your studio in Rogers Park.”
“Hmm? Yeah, we gotta make—Oh.” The excited expression of Charlie’s face softened into one that was half affection, half pity. “I-I guess we never got to tell you. Dorothy is pregnant. She’s due in June.”
“Mmmhmmmm.” Dean fought to sit up and attempted to shrug out of his jacket. Instead, all he did was somehow get it twisted behind his back.
“C’mon, Cas. You guys split like, what? A year ago? And he gets plastered and comes to your place? That isn’t normal. Not even for Dean.”
They both grin, remembering the last time they got chewed out by the librarian for deliberately putting books in the wrong spot so no one else could find them.
. “He’ll never talk to me again,” he says quietly, painfully.
Dean’s face stings as if he’s been slapped. “I know, Cas. I know I hurt you but you gotta know I never meant to. You were everything to me.”
Dean can smell the happiness coming off Cas while he introduces him, and it reminds Dean to calm down and focus on the purpose of this visit.
Dean stands back as Cas and Callie slip inside, and closes the door behind them.
A slimy sort of feeling settles in Dean’s gut, feeling suspiciously like doubt. But... that can’t be right. “I can’t tell if you’re messing with me...”
Cas who owns approximately twenty pairs of bee socks and cries at the end of “Marley and Me” even though he’s seen it a hundred times and has probably only said the word sex four times in his entire life — that Cas tried to cast a lust spell on
When he says the last part his voice whispers across the back of Cas’s neck, reigniting the inferno in Cas’s groin and he jerks so hard he kicks the tree. He curses and Dean takes a step back but his hands don’t leave, instead just slide down Cas’s body, one bracing on Cas’s back while the other falls to his hip.
“Would you like some help?”
Dean drops the pen with a laugh. Should have known he wouldn't actually get anything done tonight.
“Wait, Cas!”
“Because he’s had a crush on him since he was nine,” Cas calls from the kitchen.
“Do you even own anything that isn’t produced by Nat Geo or the History Channel?” Dean teased as Cas stood and went to the collection of DVDs.
He feels Dean’s arms settled around his waist, a comforting anchor. “I’m not going anywhere.” He turns his face into Cas’s. “Maybe we don’t need to know now. We can talk when you get back.”
to do anything. I know that. He… he left me. And the things he said, the way he acted, the—the…” Cas couldn’t even get his brain to process the words because he knew it would tip him over the edge. And he had spent a year trying to get away from the edge.
“You deserve a lot more than that,” Cas grumbled, swaying back to clutch the sink for support.
“We got you pie,” Sam said, showing Dean the container. “Cherry. They were out of pecan.”
Dean smiles sheepishly. “I know it’s not what you’re... used to... but I wanted... to try to give you... something you really... deserve.”
“Dean,” Cas says and Dean can hear that old familiar rage hardening his friend’s tone. “I would remember if you had tried to kiss me so what the hell are you talking about?”
“Oh my god,” she said again. “I can’t believe- Hold on! Stay right there!”
“See you later, Cas.”
There wasn’t much in there. It was mostly clothes, things that had probably gotten mixed into Cas’s wardrobe from years of doing laundry together. He pulled out a blue flannel. He used to love seeing Cas wear it because it brought out his eyes. And there was just something about seeing the person you love in your clothes. Something almost primal that always sent Dean chasing after Cas to pin him down somewhere.
“Hmm? Oh, ugh, I’ll just have a coke…”
Cas turns a vivid red. “That’s the sign for thrusting.”
They had agreed to stay friends after the breakup. Easier said than done of course.
Sam lifted Jess over his shoulder and waved an awkward goodbye.
All Cas can focus on is the redness in Dean’s face and the glassiness of his eyes. “I think you’re seriously coming down with something.”
“But what happened to
Dean scoffed. “You sent me to look for band aids! And who hides sex toys in their bathroom anyway?”
Cas heard a bang in the kitchen.
Dean just nodded throughout Cas’s outburst, taking on each shriek and scream with hunched shoulders and a bowed head.
Cas’s head whips up and his body goes through a dizzying rush of responses: excitement, embarrassment, a little shame even, and confusion.
Cas sighed, no idea what Dean’s point was but too tired to argue. “How are you doing, Dean?”
“You sound proud of him,” Cas observes.
Anna chuckled. “That it is, indeed.”
Dean’s hand rises to stroke through Cas’s hair and his breath tickles Cas’s hair as he whispers calming reassurances. “I’m so sorry, Cas. I never should have agreed to go. I wasn’t really into it and even she could tell.”
Dean’s smile lingered for a few more seconds before he turned his head to look out his window. “We’re here.”
Cas looks ready to say something when both of their noses twitch, picking up irritated beta. Neither has to look to know who it’s coming from. Cas makes a little noise in the back of his throat, smile taking a slight edge before he moves away.
“It’s a place of worship for people who practice Jainism, an Indian religion that practices non-violence toward all living beings,” Dean explained. Five pairs of eyebrows rose and Dean coughed awkwardly. “At least, that’s what I read… once. I think.”
“Whoever designed these chairs did not have pregnant people in mind,” Dean whispers and Cas laughs.
“Thought you ordered all that weeks ago.”
Dean rolled his eyes. “My deepest apologies, Anna. I’ll remember that next time it’s two a.m. and your brother is passed out in a bar.” Dean grabbed his shoes and began pulling them on. “Look, you’re here now so you can take over. Make sure he drinks a lot of water when he wakes up. Actually, Cas prefers Sprite when he’s hungover. It helps with the stomachache. He’s going to refuse to take Tylenol and stuff so you’ll have to crush it up and put it in the Sprite if his headache gets too bad. I never understood that quirk of his.” Dean grabbed his car keys off the counter.
“Hey, man, you almost done, there’s a line starting!” the person on the other side of the door shouts.
In a few minutes they’re looking at a giant laminated poster of the omega reproductive system and Cas pinches Dean every time he feels the alpha perk up with a new joke or innuendo.
Cas’s hand tightened around his, drawing his attention again. This time, there was no uncertainty in his eyes, just a simple request. “Please,” he said, voice as soft as Dean had ever heard it and he was powerless against it, couldn’t deny Cas a thing when asked in a voice as vulnerable as that.
“Thanks, Cas. I’ve never been this excited about anything in my life. But I’m also so nervous, you know?” Charlie beamed up at him. “I just never saw myself as mother material. But in one month… It’s insane.”
Cas’s mom was smart enough not to cancel any of her appointments and Cas spends hours in a chair with a strange woman pulling and burning her hair and spraying it with shit until even an explosion couldn’t budge a single strand.
A cloudy sound that resembles Cas’s name comes from the mask and he cuts Dean off with a sharp look.
Cas could see Jess pouting sympathetically. “I’m sorry, Cas. I really hoped things would work out for the two of you.”
“Did you two get lunch together?”
Dean hums in agreement and leans up to kiss under Brady’s jaw. “This was a good decision. This night has been amazing.”
Dean sat up on the couch. “It was. I was so surprised and Cas just froze up. He almost looked… scared.”
Cas’s smile turns upside down. “You’re not coming to dinner with us?”
Meg nods her head — or she could be bobbing it to the music, it’s hard to tell. “Yeah, Cas decided he wanted to meet him. They’re in his room.” Her eyes simmer darkly and she leans in close. “Might decide to do it the old fashioned way, ya know what I mean?”
Dean stands and looks straight at Cas. “All I wanted was to see you crack. Even if it didn’t mean that we could ever be together again, I just wanted a little sign that you had cared as much about me as I did about you. So when you started crying back there... a little piece of me thought.... well,” he breaks off with a sad laugh, “guess it doesn’t really matter what I thought.” He sighs. “See you around, Cas.”
“Dean, don’t you dare answer that—”
“I know, sweetheart,” Dean whispers and starts to rearrange them on the bed so Cas isn’t lying in the wet spot from his slick. Dean cleans him up a little with his T-shirt and then settles behind Cas, one arm draped over his waist, hand splayed on his belly.
She tilts her head back to frown at him. “You were?”
Dean frowns at the shift in Cas’s posture. He’s wearing that exhaustion loud and clear. Last time Dean checked, that isn’t what a happily engaged person was supposed to look like. “Is this what you want?”
And please go visit the wonderful artist of this fic and many others
The irritation Cas has been sitting on the last two days evaporates long enough for him to blush. Ever since he scented Dean, his pregnancy has gone from standard to extraordinary. He doesn’t feel as stressed or scared even. Every morning he wakes up wrapped in thunderstorms and Dean’s strong arms and he finally feels safe and… stable. Dean is there every day to help him, child proofing his apartment and adding a few things to the nursery. Cas isn’t alone anymore and that bit of reality has done wonders for himself and the baby.
God, how much had he had to drink last night? He had honestly lost count. Jess and Jo had just kept pushing them at him and he just kept sucking them down. He couldn’t even remember what he had been drinking.
“Don’t apologize,” Cas barks. “What you did was beyond fucked up and crossed a million different lines-”
And absolutely no amount of willpower can keep back the tears when the two kids race down the stairs until to slide to a short stop when they see Dean sitting next to the tree.
There’s no point in denying that these last few months have been difficult. Miserable. But Cas likes to think he’s handled it to the best of his ability. He understands that he made the decision to end the relationship and he takes responsibility for the damage it did to Dean and himself. He understands that he doesn’t get the right to mourn what was lost. He understands that he doesn’t get to be mad when his friends can’t hang out with him because they’re with Dean. He understands that he doesn’t get to make scenes when he sees Dean in public. He understands that he doesn’t get to be petty or jealous when Dean dates other people and he doesn’t get to explode when he sees Dean kissing other people or holding their hand or letting them sit on his lap.
“You could have called me.”
The smile that forms is small and grateful and shakes Dean like a warm gust of wind. “Thanks, Dean. That means a lot.”
Cas sifts through his phone until he finds what he wants and the telltale signs of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas start to chime through the kitchen. “I believe you said something about dancing.”
Dean scoffs. “Of course I did. Could never miss you...” His voice trials off at the end.
Charlie isn’t happy to have her video game marathon interrupted when Dean buzzes her apartment, but she lets him up.
Cas... walks away. With the ghost of a smile. He turns his back and walks ahead and Dean feels each step echo in his chest.
“I guess the crib.” Cas points to the biggest box currently cornering his couch. “We should probably carry it to the nursery and put it together in there.”
“That a new world record for you?”
Cas’s voice startled Dean and he turned feeling his cheeks heat. “Mine too,” he said, accepting the beer Cas offered. He cleared his throat. “I, ugh, I’m surprised you kept it.”
“Deanna?”
“Now who’s lying?”
“Oh my gods,” he breathes into the empty apartment.
“Well don’t be too long or I might actually learn something.”
There are velvet ropes leading up to her locker and resting at the foot of it is a wooden box.
Dean took a moment before shrugging. “I fucked up.”
“I’m going to go ahead and assume you don’t mean India.”
He moves as if to do it himself and Dean springs into action, erection long forgotten. “Hey, hey, I got it,” he says, sliding past Cas.
Dean’s mouth goes dry suddenly. “Cas,” he says finally. “I don’t understand what’s happening right now.”
And god, what the idea of being wrapped up in Cas’s scent does to him.
“I’ll go.”
Cas stares at him, his face unreadable. “So you left me because you thought I was going to leave you?”
“Dean?” Sam asked, nudging his brother’s shoulder. “Hey, Dean. Are you okay?”
“Wait just a second, young man,” Dean says in his jolly voice. “Don’t you want to sit on Santa’s lap and tell him what you want for Christmas?”
“I don’t know what you’re up to, Dean, but I really hope you figure it out fast.”
Dean swallows, not sure how to respond, what would be appropriate to say after everything. But the truth demands attention and he finds himself saying, “I miss her, too.”
Cas drops the mistletoe. “Fertility? I’m not trying to get pregnant, Anna.”
Dean rolls his eyes and unlocks the door, pulling it open. “What the hell are you doing here, Benny?”
“You know, when Castiel first moved back home he talked about you all the time but never had any pictures to show us. It wasn’t until I was in his apartment I finally got to know what you looked like. It’s that photograph of you and Callie in the museum together.”
But Sam had stood in his office not even a week ago and asked to be friends again. And Cas would be lying if he said he didn’t want that too.
But Dean couldn’t eat. He couldn’t even look at it. He got up and tossed the food in the trash can, then washed up the dishes real fast.
Sam and Jess were making their way over. When Jess caught sight of Cas she ran ahead, launching herself at Cas much like Jo had.
Wrapping has never been his strong suit and there are definitely a few presents that come out looking a lot bigger than they actually are, but he carries on, keeping his mind busy and focused on cutting and folding. So busy that when a sound comes from the garage it doesn’t jar him at first.
Dean kicks at a rock and breathes out. What’s done is done.
Dean stopped messing around long enough to roll his eyes at Cas. “’s kinda what alcoholics do.”
That’s when Charlie called in reinforcements.
Dean smiles up at Brady. “Oh, hey babe,” he greets before turning his eyes to Callie, brow arched. “We’ll continue this later?” She nods and they leave it there.
And both kids are off like a shot, diving into their father’s arms and knocking him back into the tree. Cas can only laugh and cry as he watches his family come back together, the way they always should be.
“Yeah,” Deanna says, eyes on the ground.
“I guess so?” Dean shrugs and turns so they’re pressed shoulder to shoulder. “Where’s Meg?”
With Cas’s finals also behind him he had spent the next few days playing nurse to Dean’s stubborn ass. Though not at all the nice nurse, more like the nurse from hell who tried to smother Dean to death with blankets, forced Dean to drink nasty medicine, and kept him on a strict hydration schedule that consisted of a lot of gross teas Cas made himself. When Dean finally started to come around he wasn’t sure if it was more due to Cas’s treatment or his body’s desperation to end the torment.
Shit.
“Dean,” Cas says as he rushes in. “What happened?”
Cas swallows roughly. “We, uh, think I might just have been a late bloomer.”
. You found me on the floor with my pants undone and the sperm cup.”
That had probably been the hardest decision of Dean’s life, a painful and long transition to go from loving someone one day to still loving them the next but not being able to kiss them or touch them or really even look at them without feeling your chest cave in.
“Cassie, there you are!”
“Cas, don’t be upset. I’m fine, I told you.”
Before Dean can even react, Cas snatches the brochure and drops it back on the receptionist’s side of the desk. “Well, he’s not interested. He’s here to help me. So if we could get the registry or whatever it is now, that would be great.” And he ends it will a smile sharp enough to cut glass.
He barely remembers to lift the cup in time before he starts to shake apart.
But then Dean had joined the soccer team. At first, Dean hadn’t been happy about it either, knowing his mom was making him do it as a way to blow off some of that 12-year-old energy. But over time, Dean has come to actually enjoy the sport and his teammates, likes the competition, the motivation it gives him to keep working and building his skills.
“Yes.”
“Around 4 a.m. Woke up starving and talking my ear off. Kid has a weird fascination with her own puke.” Dean wrinkles his nose.
But just thinking about it now in his kitchen has Cas tensing. He’d been careful not to ask about Lisa or the date even once yesterday. He didn’t want to know. And when Dean never made any effort to bring it up himself, he’d felt so relieved.
Callie’s lips pout in a genuine display of sadness. “Oh. I’m sorry.”
“I’m so sorry I’m late,” Dean pants and comes to a stop. “Got caught by a train.”
He nods, smiles. “Absolutely. I was the first person he told he wanted to have a baby and I was the first person he told when he found out he was pregnant with you. There is nothing and no one he would put before you, Callie. You can tell him anything and he will always love you the most.”
“Taking care of your drunk brother.”
“B-but why?”
Cas licked his lips and looked for a distraction. “Um, I guess we should choose something to watch. Any requests?”
“I was actually already planning on something before you seduced me.”
He can feel the bitch face boring a hole in the side of his head. “Your soul bonded to your best friend without a physical mating. I’m pretty sure that’s something to talk about.”
He gets dinner with a friend and finally makes it home around 7 p.m. He spies the impala in the parking garage and smiles, thinking he can get at least an hour of quality time with Dean before his boyfriend passes out.
Cas grimaces. “Unless that someone just wants to pour pig’s blood over me or hang me from the bleachers.”
Cas lets his hands roam up and down Dean’s back, just enjoying the feel of him, big and solid and here. Like a damn Christmas miracle. He laughs. “The kids are gonna think Santa brought you.”
“Well, yeah, because it was made nine years ago! That doesn’t make it better! Besides, Westerns are supposed to look grainy and old. It’s part of the nuance.”
This isn’t love. It’s not a romance.
Dean’s eyes close and when they reopen, gone is heavy burden of his unmade decision. He looks crushed. Lost. And then smiles. “Yeah, I guess I better go.”
Cas stops a few feet away, allowing the two their moment. He sees Dean glance his way but nothing in his demeanor changes. Maybe he really had forgotten Cas.
“Did something happen?”
Dean makes his way over as Callie skips away and Cas looks at him with wonder. “What did you say to her?” he asks, eyes tracking his daughter as she joins the other kids. “And what have you invited into my home?”
There’s silence for a moment and Dean can feel Brady’s eyes on him. “When did you say they were coming?”
“Callie,” Cas says, lowly. “What do you say first?”
“My help? How?
[Thu. 9:57 a.m.]
Okay, bye.
Good enough for who? Is not a question he wants to know the answer to.
forced him to face what the neon lights and the underground parties of New York had done a pretty poor job of hiding: There is no place for Castiel in Dean's life anymore.
He gulped, and looked up. Castiel was gone. He felt the strange urge to talk to him, just to see what would happen… But as a got a text from his dad asking what time was he arriving on Lawrence, he settled for deleting the app, it was better that way.
He gave a big hug to Charlie, who was dressed up as a vampire, just like Benny, and Jo was Buffy. Dean felt a little sorry that he had fucked up their group costume, but Charlie was so happy she got to do his make-up that he was instantly forgiven by a previously furious Jo. Once he was finally Instagram-ready, they headed off to Purgatory.
And when he allowed himself to fall asleep that night, after returning home and working on the code of his robotic project for three hours, he didn't even notice he had no new texts messages from Cas.
[Thu. 11:04 p.m.]
Dean hurried to open the door, using it as an excuse to hide the red rapidly creeping up his cheeks.
Ten minutes later, a busty little red riding hood is twerking at Benny, and Dean is fighting to get the barman’s attention again. He reckons it is a little pathetic that that is the only man (or person, for that matter) whose attention he is trying to get tonight. What is the point in being bi if he isn’t able to score on an open bar night? He takes out his phone, sighing when we stills sees no response.
When the semester ends and they don’t make any plans for the summer, Cas thinks,
He grabs his jacket, takes his car keys and leaves his phone on the bed. The last thing he needs is to send an even stupid-er text while he's drunk. If he's gonna drown his sorrows, he's gonna do it alone. But just as he opens the door to go drink his imaginary break-up away, he runs into a very real body, standing in front of his doorway, blocking his way.
“Oh my God!” the blonde switches to mocking-mode and laughs again. Castiel recognizes the laughter as fake this time. “Hahahaha. Can you imagine…?”
two weeks.
Castiel nods and starts walking. Dean follows him.
“No, Dean. YOU want to ask him out! I’m just saying you should”
like hell u are
"I am SO going to create you a profile, dude" Benny said, smiling widely and pointing at Dean with a his forefinger before putting the handful of popcorn he had grabbed in his mouth and continue to talk, chewing at the same time "you've been lonely for too long, you need a man to give it to you good and hard"
"I was."
Telling himself Dean would give him a chance. See if he liked Cas enough to...
“What is it, Dean-o?”
He’d also be a big fat liar if he said he noticed they never actually talked.
That he’s here… he might start to think that maybe, and just maybe…
playing on the speakers as they walk past the entrance to Hell. He can barely hear Castiel's comment on how the lyrics are not an exact translation from the original song in French. He rolls his eyes at him for choosing to be pretentious about
But can I wish for anything in the world?
Dean smiles at the abbreviation.
And Dean... Didn't know how to answer to that. It was beautiful and hella inspiring and Cas had said it in such a natural (and hot) yet kind manner. What the hell was he supposed to answer to
He's cheerful because Charlie did her job right and Castiel can't seem to read Dean's features underneath the paint and the lenses. And he's happy because he's kissed Cas. And because he kissed back and his lips are incredibly soft. And that thing he was just doing to his neck... Dean wouldn't mind too much if Cas did that again.
"I apologize. I don't have your number."
He has fucked up. This is it. That guy is never talking to him again. Way to go, champ. And they have class together the next day. Now, THAT'S not going to be awkward.
Right now I wished I knew who you are.
They take a class together, and they run into each other at the school cafeteria, and at the Starbucks on campus, and they text and they hang out. But it’s never planned. It just is. It just happens.
Castiel's head tilted to the side as he stared at Dean with a slight frown and -when had he gotten this close to Dean? Had he always been this close? Air started to feel thicker and Dean fought his deepest instincts to not stare at the other boy's lips, not for too long at least.
“Yes”
The chorus brings back memories of that party where we met.
something else the other half of the time… and he’s surely just hallucinating. He’s had this insane crush on Dean for far too long so now being around him, so close to him all the time… it’s kind of weird, intoxicating, and playing tricks on him. There was no way that Dean liked him too.
Castiel turned to him and,
"How can you still live that life? After everything we went through, after how you destroyed me...?"
I have to get to class now.
"It's great" he answers, and wraps his hands around Castiel's waist.
He skims over an email his faculty sent him, promoting a European languages summer course. He
"Look, I don't know, really." the engineering student did his best to not think about how fucking close Castiel had gotten to him in the past second "I've been a mess lately, with midterms and all. I've hardly gotten any sleep and, to be honest I didn't even remember we were meeting today. So I'm not sure the three pages I wrote while I was high on caffeine and instant noodles are worth using."
“Fuck, the group project!” Charlie dropped her fork and brought her hand to her forehead in sudden concern “I had totally forgotten about it…Why did I let you drag me into taking that stupid class, again?”
[Tue. 10:46 p.m.]
And I thought they were loud when they were awake...
Am I being cat fished? Is that you, Balthazar?
"You're impossible. I..." he clears his throat. "I don't think you went through all the trouble of hiding your identity from me just to be a one-night stand, did you?"
"Well, that can be arranged, can't it?"
"When I take you on a date, then you'll know it's a date" Dean

He feels like the dog from that online comic, the one surrounded by fire but telling to himself "this is fine". Dean looks around him, there's no fire. This is
Castiel's room was about the same size as Dean's, but it seemed smaller because it had two beds and hosted the belongings of two very different students. Where Cas' side of the room was impecable and clean, his roommate's was messy, the walls filled with posters and some take-out food containers spread around. Meanwhile, all Castiel's had was his bed, a few over-used bookshelves and a clean desk with several books and a closed laptop in it.
That way, he won’t see there’s no new messages waiting for him.
doesn’t want to hear any of this, but it seems that Castiel needs to vent. So he ignores his own feelings and listens. He doesn’t say anything, partly because he doesn’t know what he could possibly say and partly because he knows Castiel isn’t telling him this to get an opinion. Not really. He’s telling him this because he
Especially as you already seem to know who I am.
He then opened his mouth and said something that Dean did not understand in the slightest but knew was the hottest thing he had ever heard.
“His name is Balthazar.”
Jo bursts out laughing and Cas wants to leave. He
Castiel blinked a couple of times, and then shook his head and smiled openly.

Aside from the conversations of a few people still waiting in line to get into the club and one drunk girl holding the hair of her even drunker friend as she throws up on the sidewalk, the night is completely silent. Dean thinks it’s a nice change from the loudness of the club. He turns to check on Cas, who he had practically dragged outside. He is looking down at the pavement, deep in thought.

at him. And he secretly gets angry at himself for how angry he got at Cas. He just got treated like shit by that other dude, Dean shouldn’t be adding more wood to the fire by also treating him like shit.
“What? What is it? Why’re you talking like Janice from ‘Friends’ now?” the redhead asked, trying to get his phone.
He almost didn’t notice when he started hanging out more with her than he did with Dean. Almost. But he did. He noticed. How couldn’t he? But that happened later, over the summer.
[Wed. 12:35 p.m.]
“He says no, you feel bad for about a week and then you get over it. That’s the worst thing that could happen.”
"That would be nice, yes."
the other boy's chest go up and down with every breath more than he can see it.
!" Dean was particularly defensive about his historical crushes. Last time Benny dared to say something about Vivien Thomas he had regretted it for a week.
"I'm at Jo's. Wait, who's Casti...? Oh, your boyfriend? You finally doing him?"
"You didn't". Castiel confirmed as he looked around for a place to sit, finally settling for the edge of Dean's bed. And no, that did not give Dean any ideas.
The last person Dean expected to see in front of his dorm room when he came back after a long day in the robotics lab, was Castiel Novak.
“I’m serious! Ask him out! What’s the worst thing that can happen?”
Dean sent the last text and put his phone on silent mode as he entered the classroom. He felt an adrenaline rush as he sat right behind Castiel, on his usual spot, and tried real hard not to look at the ruffled hair, dark stubble and deep blue eyes, as he passed in front of him. He would have time to entertain himself with his Grindr profile pictures later that night.
"Yes." the other boy nodded and squinted a little. "You seem surprised to see me. We did agree on meeting today, didn't we?"
"I apologize. It appears I have made a mistake. I will leave now. Good evening." he nods and clears his throat once again, as he starts to walk away.
Unimportant.
liked that guy.
Perhaps its beautiful simplicity?
reflect his personality.
The words still rumble in his ears, and Cas doesn’t really know how they make him feel, he just knows the emptiness in his stomach grows a little bit more every time his memory repeats them. He doesn’t eat dinner that night, and somehow that makes the emptiness subside, replaced by the physical pain from the hunger instead.
“Okay, let's say he did those mental gymnastics and added the last names, which I doubt. That's still only 5 people to guess from, Dean. It's not that many, you know?”
“... But then he texted you.”
"D?" the black-haired boy asks, squinting his eyes at him.
Before he even notices, Dean grows used to waking up to a new text from Cas every morning. He doesn't realize when exactly this happens, but his days start to take form depending on whether or not they have class together that day. Because if they do, they'll go to the coffee house or walk back to their dorm together after class and Dean wonders what had ever made him think hiding his identity from Cas was such a good idea. Because getting to know a person while pretending you don't already know them because you've been talking to them for months on a dating app while pretending to not be you... well, that turned out harder than he had anticipated.
