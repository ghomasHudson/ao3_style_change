Of course, if Balthazar preferred Dean not come over, or if he had planned to use the kitchen that day, Cas would cancel his plans, but he sincerely hoped that he wouldn’t have to. It wasn’t really a “date,” not a romantic one at least, but he was really looking forward to it.
On the following Monday, as Cas walked with a sullen, morose face towards his classroom, lost in his thoughts, feeling more alone and misunderstood than ever, his gaze was drawn, once again, to the poster with the multicolored rainbow.
Dumbstruck, Dean kept looking at him even a few minutes after he left the bar and disappeared. He shook his head, and then took a sip of his beer. That had been… unexpected. He couldn’t believe Cas really used the dating app. Knowing he created a profile was one thing, but learning he was really talking and flirting with guys on it? When he was still an angel, Cas never showed the slightest interest in romance and sex. So what, did he just get new urges when he became human? Why didn’t he ask Dean or Sam instead of looking for answers on a dating app?
“Dean! We’re gonna start the next game, you coming? And Lisa asked if you found those beers in the fridge?”
“Wait, wait, wait. Tom? Tom?! Tom!” Dean repeated, shocked. What were the odds that both him and Cas would have met the same guy? And when did that happen? When he met Tom, earlier, the man had told him he hadn't met Cas in real life yet.
Cas chuckled. “Oh please, Dean, no, it’s not. What’s brave is talking to a group of adults so freely like you did with the parents earlier. Organizing everything. You’ve been in this organization since your first year and it took me more than two years to gather enough courage to do it.”
A dozen students were now in the room. Cas looked carefully at their clothes. His outfit didn’t stand out from the others, which reassured him. He sat down, took the notebook out of his pocket and opened it, absent-mindedly doodling while waiting for the meeting to begin.
Of course Balthazar wasn’t awake yet. The house was still quiet, and Cas noticed that his roommate had taken some time to clean the living room before going to sleep. That was something that Cas enjoyed about him: he was really respectful. Cas prepared some eggs, toast, and bacon, and ate peacefully. However, as he was thinking about his day, trying to imagine how the meeting would go, parasitic thoughts began to invade him. Cas sighed. He had only eaten one slice of toast and he still had a piece of bacon left on his plate, but he knew he wouldn’t be able to eat any more.
Cas shifted in his bed with a sigh. Being an anxious socially awkward gay student was already challenging enough. But also being asexual made the situation even more complicated.
Dean smiled shyly, and Cas’ heart tightened in a positive way, sending warm vibes through his entire body. Usually, Dean looked cool. At that moment, he looked adorable.
He looked for the switch to light the room. Prominently displayed on the coffee table, he had put down Balthazar's poker case - since Raphael had enough material at home, his roommate had lent it to him for the evening. "On the other hand, I figured that since I was depriving you of your poker night..."
“Yeah,” Dean agreed. “I’m glad you enjoyed the game! And don’t forget that I still need to teach you how to play poker!”
“Well, if you say that you consider homework to be 'boring' in front of them, I’m sure they think you’re cool." Cas smiled.
Dean jumped and almost dropped his beer. He straightened, eyes closed. Just his luck,  the last person he wanted to see was here.
And he retreated to his room before giving either one of them the opportunity to tell him he could stay with them. He needed to be alone for a few moments to process what had just happened. He and Dean had shared a moment. Well, they often did, but this time, it was even more profound than usual. Cas couldn’t help but wonder what could have happened if Balthazar hadn’t interrupted them. On one hand, he actually wouldn’t have known how to answer Dean after his “I do trust you,” and even though the situation and the staring that had followed had been comfortable, it could have become awkward if Dean had been expecting Cas to say something. On the other hand, Cas really appreciated their conversation, and he would have liked to follow up on that question. He had been worried about his future, and his ability to become a doctor for a while, but never really dared to talk about it out loud to anyone.
“Yes, my cousin told me something like that happened to his neighbor. He was in a car accident, and it was so bad that the doctors had to cut off his entire leg!”
The next day, when he bumped into Balthazar in the kitchen at lunch, he warned him that Dean would be coming by the next day.
“Dean, there’s nothing you can’t fix. I bet that Cas can forgive you. Dean, Christmas is the perfect day for you to try to make things better. It’s about hope and forgiveness, and love.”
"Well, then you can just leave, Sammy. Cas and I have some catching up to do. And an app to delete from our phones!"
“You said you’d rather not deal with the homework, so you wouldn't be the boring one. I don’t care about being the “mean” adult. I’m used to people not really liking me, anyway, so it won’t bother me.”
“Okay, boys, I think the next pair is waiting behind you to choose their groups. If you don’t have any more questions, you’re free to go now. Castiel, if you have questions, feel free to contact me or Donna." Jody grabbed a leaflet from a pile of papers that was on her table. Both Jody and Donna's contact information was written down, as well as some practical information.
Cas hadn't decided yet whether he'd go to the LGBT+ Society meeting. As the week passed, he started to tell himself that maybe he wouldn't go to this week’s meeting, but maybe the next one. However, deep down, he knew that if he put it off once, he'd do it again the next time. Besides, Charlie Bradbury was expecting him this week, not next week. He knew that excuse wasn't valid: Charlie seemed like a nice person and probably wouldn't mind if he came later in the month, or even never at all. He didn't know her, and he surely didn't owe anything to her. No, if he decided to go, it had to be on his own initiative.
brush against each other's shoulders, lightly touch each other's hands picking up a utensil at the same time... For someone as flirty and as forward as Dean, it was a golden opportunity to try something, and Cas wanted to make their relationship move forward.
Cas heard the other players agreeing, before retreating to his room. His heart was beating very fast. He took a deep breath.
After a few minutes of banging and shouting, he finally gave up, falling to his knees as he began to cry.
Dean almost laughed. No, sharing a cup of chamomile tea while talking about Cas’ insomnia after what he just discovered was the last thing he wanted to do. Sooner or later, he would have to address Cas’ sleeping disorder; his friend probably needed his help with that, and for a moment, Dean felt guilty to act so selfishly. But tonight, he just couldn’t.
“Yes, it did.” Cas hesitated for a minute. Should he talk to his roommate about Dean? After all, Balthazar was Dean’s friend; maybe he could give him more information about the guy? But talking about the situation would make it real. Moreover, Balthazar would notice the crush Cas had on Dean, and he would think Cas was ridiculous for that. And the last thing Cas needed was for his childhood friend to pity him.
Every other player followed them and put two red chips on the table. Then a guy turned over one of the cards that was displayed next to the chips. The girl next to Balthazar gasped a little.
“What? It is already 4? You’re sure I can’t stay? Please, just one more hour?” asked one of the kids when his father came to pick him up.
He met Meg at the library to compare his notes from the last biochemistry lecture with her (or more specifically, let her complete her notes with his, but he didn’t mind). Then they had a math tutorial. Meg spent more time texting than listening to the teaching assistant, and the look on her face was unusually soft. Cas assumed she was probably talking to the boy she was dating; he must be very special to keep Meg hooked that way! Usually, she got quickly tired of the boys she agreed to go on a date with. However, he didn’t ask her any questions; if she wanted to share it with him, she would do it herself.
” Cas corrects, “Calling me a girl implies that I am prepubescent, and I am sure that this vessel is at least 30 years of age.”
There were only a few students inside, a couple by the freezers, and group of kids – obviously freshman – milling about the isles buying late night snacks.
“We’ll see you on Thursday, Crowley,” Dean finished, and the way Crowley was looking at them sent a chill down Castiel’s spine. He was frozen in his spot until Dean grabbed his things and took Castiel’s hand in his own, pulling him along.
"Sorry for yelling," Dean says quickly, walking over to Ben and kneeling, "things are just…a little crazy in my head right now, is all."
“No reason,” Cas shrugs, “Just wanted a taste. Too bad you can’t stay up too late tonight, you’ve got a busy morning ahead. Ya know, taking care of the house and the baby all by yourself. Since I’ll be here. Sleeping in.”
Dean almost spat out his drink at Sam’s query. “Sammy!” Dean coughed, “You can’t just ask me something like that!”
“Months,” Dean tells him, moving forward to kiss his cheek, “and let me tell you,” a kiss to his neck, “you are
Kevin still looks confused, but he rolls his eyes and nods. “Whatever,” he mumbles, and then Dean feels something wet on his palm.
Cas blushed. “I was in a bit of a hurry this morning, and it was lying on top of my hamper, but when I put it on it smelt like you and I figured you wouldn’t mind so I…”
Dean reached up with his hand to scratch the back of his neck, something Castiel now recognized as a nervous gesture. “Well, yeah,” Dean started, looking away from Castiel, “you liked them so much, and…and you didn’t even get to enjoy them because… I mean, I couldn’t throw them away, it would feel like…” Dean took a breath and looked at Castiel again, “it would feel like giving up. On you. And I couldn’t do that. Even when the roses died, I just…” Dean swallowed, and Castiel turned to face him.
Castiel shrugged. “You can always ask, Dean. We’re best friends.” Was he really considering this? Skipping his own graduation to go to another funeral?
“Oh, great, I’m glad to hear that. I’m definitely gonna ask him out, then. You know, before it’s too late,” he added, winking at Dean before grabbing his phone and going away.
"It’s time, the first parents are already coming! Hey, Jack, what do you think of going to get a nougat bar from the kitchen with Cas, since you were super brave while he was fixing you up?"
“Well… Celebrating God’s son birth isn’t exactly what I want to do this year. Combining anything God-related to joy and celebration isn’t actually what I plan to do in the next weeks. Except celebrating his death, of course”.
“Anyway, let’s go,” he said, shaking his head in disbelief but internally amused, opening the door of the car.
“You know, there’s a basketball game, varsity team, tomorrow night…”. He stopped again, looking fixedly at the road to avoid meeting Cas’ eyes.
“Don’t waste your time, Raphael. I already offered to teach him, but he doesn’t seem to be really interested.”
If the children seemed to enjoy the games, being cooperative and nice, the pie at the end definitely satisfied them.
As a matter of fact, Cas did have an idea. The idea had been running through his mind since his conversation with Balthazar the night before - since he learned that Dean had preferred a baking night with him to poker night with his friends. It had made him extremely happy, and now he wanted to return the favor in some way, even though he knew Dean didn't expect anything from him. But even beyond this particular cooking night, Dean made him happy in general, and Cas wanted to make a return gesture  as well.
“Listen, let's not talk about it here, okay? I was feeling a little down last weekend, but I'm good now. It was nothing, really, sorry I seemed to be distant," Cas explained, trying to be convincing.
Cas looked at him, taken aback. Dean had said that in his “normal voice,” as if those last five minutes hadn’t even happened. What did that mean? Seeing his confused gaze, Dean smiled and stared patiently at him, a little bit curious, as if he was wondering whether Cas would say something or not.
Cas blushed a little. He crossed Charlie’s gaze, uncertain of what to say. He had never said clearly to Dean that he was gay – and he didn’t want him to know he was asexual. He already didn’t have any chance with him, but if Dean also knew that Cas was asexual… He would never consider him as more than a friend! Even if Cas wasn’t against having sex, asexuality wasn’t a very well known orientation, and there were still a lot of clichés about it. Cas didn’t know what Dean knew about it, and he didn’t want him to assume anything.
“Well, to be sure about it”, Cas answered quickly, as if it was obvious. “Of course, I am not completely clueless, I identified that the reason why I was feeling differently about you was probably love, and-”
“It’s okay that you don’t want to… to have sex with these people, Cas. It’s okay that you tried to find out what you like. I get it now, but you have to be careful. You just
“But… Why? I don’t know anyone who wouldn’t like to have sex with him. Did you even look at him? He has the best ass out of the entire college!”
When he finally caught sight of Dean again, he had resumed his conversation with the girl, who was touching her hair with one hand and Dean’s arm with the other, laughing at everything he was saying. A complete cliché of the scene he had expected to see: Dean flirting heavily with some random hot girl (well “hot” according to objective criteria, since Cas was literally the last person who could qualify a girl as “hot,” being not only gay, but also asexual), who also appeared to be very interested in him – of course, who wouldn’t be interested in Dean?
“Yeah, really. It looks good on you. And I wouldn’t want my favorite basketball referee to get cold!”
Dean hadn’t promised him anything; he hadn't even known that Cas would come to that party! And sure, he had winked at him and joked with him in a flirty way a few times, but it was his classic behaviour with everyone. Cas wasn't special to him.
Dean raised his hands as a sign of appeasement. “Hey man, I never said tea was boring! I meant that…”
“Hello everyone, I hope you’re all doing well today,” Charlie began. “So, today, before we open the discussion for everyone to share their thoughts, Stevie has prepared a slide show they are going to present to you about different sexual orientations, some of them some of which may be less familiar and which you may not have heard about often. Stevie, are you ready?”
He stopped. What silly idea just came to his mind? Was he really going to invite Dean into his apartment?
Dean opened his mouth to answer, but someone called him from the living-room. “DEAN? You coming or what? We’re waiting for you to start!”
“Perfect! We have our first pair, then. You can go up to Jody’s desk to choose your preferred time slot and the age of the group of children you’ll be taking care of."
Even when writing text messages, Dean managed to use winking emojis… Cas could completely picture Dean really winking directly at him.
“I’m glad to see that you don’t hold a grudge,” Cas laughed, referring to the false rivalry they had staged in front of the children earlier.
“It is,” Dean agreed. “What do you think of going back inside to let Cas help Jack? He can’t focus if everyone is talking and screaming… We can watch some cartoons, if you want!” he said in a cheerful voice.
Cas’ throat tightened. That was so not where he thought he would have led the conversation! He had no intentions of talking about Dean, and yet… He was about to do it. But he felt that he needed it. He desperately needed to let out his thoughts, his worries, his disappointments, his pain.
“Alright, alright, we all know that! I’m sure even Cas noticed how easy-going you are. Don’t worry, popular boy, everyone likes you!” Balthazar grinned. “Anyway, the next game starts in 5, are you in?”
After everything Dean had done for Cas in just one week, saying that he was a very nice guy was the least he could do. Dean had been super welcoming and kind with him, very patient, answering his questions about the program, making sure he wouldn’t unnecessarily stress about it. After an afternoon like the one they had just spent, his “only friends, not falling in love with Dean” rule was very difficult to keep in mind.
CAS : “I don’t know what you mean by “date”, Dean. I was just suggesting maybe we could meet in the Dean Cave like we usually do in the evenings.”
Dean smiled. “Good, then.” He kissed him on the cheek, and Cas turned his head to kiss him gently on the lips in turn. The moment, very soft, continued, until Sam cleared his throat.
And suddenly, it struck him. He was in love with Dean. Of course, it shouldn’t have been big news. He had known for a while that he had a big crush on him. But he had tried to hold back as much as he could, to stop himself from letting it happen. However, at that moment, he realized he couldn’t hold back anymore; he couldn’t ignore it, he couldn’t lie to himself anymore. He thought he had already been in love before; and maybe he had been. But this time, it was completely different, completely new, because he loved Dean with a strength that was beyond his understanding. And, for the first time, he felt that maybe, maybe Dean shared this feeling. Otherwise, he wouldn’t look at him that way. He wouldn’t be so nice, so gentle, so tender. His voice wouldn’t be so soft. He wouldn’t care about him so much. He couldn’t have made it up! This had to be real, or at least a part of it.
On Friday evening, Cas was in the living room, eating some pasta while watching an animal documentary on Netflix, when he heard Balthazar’s door opening. Cas twisted his neck to look at the corridor through the open door of the living-room. His friend was wearing casual clothes.
Dean straightened himself up in his chair. "What would you like to know?" he asked, almost professionally.
On his way, he stopped in the forest that was next to the bunker; of course, he couldn’t find a proper Christmas tree, but still manage to find some pine branches. Better than nothing.
Dean forced himself to smile. “It’s fine Ben, I saw it was an accident.” Then he turned to Cas to quickly explain the situation: “Ben was dribbling around to try to reach the basket, and he didn’t see Jack and ran into him. Jack fell, apparently his knee is hurt, but I don’t know how bad it is, should we call his mother? An ambulance? What should we do?”
"Okay, Cas. Now you're going to get up, you're going to shower, and you're going to get dressed. You're going to put on a polo shirt; it's half formal, half casual. With black jeans. It's sober, it's efficient. Your coat has big enough pockets for a notebook, a pencil, and a cereal bar if you get hungry. You're going to be fine. Everything is planned. There's no reason for anything to go wrong. Go, now,” he said to himself, out loud.
“He shouldn’t be long, his last class finished thirty minutes ago,” Cas replied, looking at his watch.
He didn’t know what he meant what “we’ll fix this”. Was he only talking about the cookie? Fortunately, Cas let it go, and started to leave, taking his coat and his jacket.
He went straight back to the garage without taking the time to go back to his room, he simply put on the clean T-shirt he was still holding, and got behind the wheel. He drove downtown to the nearest bar and ordered three shots of whiskey in a row.
“So,” he said after a few minutes of them eating silently the pie, “what did you think of your first day?”
“A pie baking workshop? I think I’m gonna like you, Cas!” Dean commented. “Great idea. I’m totally on board with it!”
The room probably had been a classic classroom once, but now it was fully decorated with various Pride flags – including the asexual flag, Cas noticed. Charlie had prepared a table with plates of cookies, and chairs were arranged in an arc around it.
He came to the bunker  late, well past dinnertime. He had driven the entire day, without a specific destination, ignoring Sam’s calls, just texting him he was okay. Cas had texted him, too, asking what he would make for dinner. Dean just told him he wouldn’t make it back in time for dinner and that Cas shouldn’t wait for him. He felt guilty to let Cas down. It was the first time he wouldn’t cook for Cas and they wouldn’t eat dinner together since Cas became human, but after all, Sam could prepare the meal, or Cas could make sandwiches. He knew how to make those, and he liked them.
Several times during the week, he sat down at his desk and tried to write something, to plan what he would say. He was anxious: planning was what he did best! He eventually ended up with a text he was happy with.
Dean would probably be surprised to see Cas there. The idea made Cas smile, and was the final argument that definitely convinced him.
Cas had no idea what was going on. Balthazar, once again, was the first one to play and chose to bet five chips this time. Lisa growled but followed him.
Cas took a moment to inspect Dean. He couldn’t see perfectly, the only source of light being a dilapidated old neon sign on the front of the bar, but Dean didn’t seem different than usual.
“Dean. I’ll be with only one kid when you’ll have to handle nine of them. I’m the one who should be asking you that question!”
Ben laughed, as if Cas just said something really funny. He took his coat and left, waving at them. Dean laughed too, seeing how scandalized Cas looked.
“Thanks, I wasn’t really sure. To be honest, I almost texted you to ask you what you’d be wearing, and ask for advice, and then I thought it wasn’t important enough, and…”
Cas smiled, trying to look cool and appealing. In other circumstances, he would have been happy to feel such a warm welcome from new acquaintances, but here, he just felt a little bit embarrassed. Besides, the fact that all the attention was on him prevented Cas from doing what he really wanted to: see Dean’s reaction when Balthazar announced that Cas was gay. However, he had lost sight of Dean in the crowd. Balthazar’s friends surrounded him, asking whether he played poker, what he was studying, and other details that Cas didn’t think were important when getting to know other students at parties.
“Yes, I received your email! Welcome to the team, Castiel. I’m sure you’ll find lots of ways to involve yourself in the community with the CLCP!”
Sullen, Dean struggled to fall asleep. He couldn’t help but to feel guilty about his behavior during the day. He knew he couldn’t run away from Cas forever. Besides, it was probably making things worse. Maybe if he had simply acted casually, as if it wasn’t a big deal, he could have made Cas believe it was a joke, or a mistake. Now, given his reaction, it wasn’t possible anymore, there was no way Cas would buy it.
“That’s a shame!” Dean commented. “I’ll bake some pies, maybe you can bring some drinks? Orange juice, lemonade, that kind of thing.”
“What, you mean that for once, you’re taking some initiative for an academic topic? Wow, what happened to you?”
Cas grabbed a cookie, and somehow, it tasted even better than the day before. He took his time getting ready, in a great mood. He didn’t see Balthazar and wondered when his roommate had come home, and if he had seen that Cas fell asleep while watching something with Dean. In a way, he wanted Balt to have seen them, as if it was proof that it was real. Well, the note he carefully put in his pocket was proof that he didn’t dream it, but he wanted Balthazar to know, for some reason. And everyone else too. Because he was feeling proud: proud of being worthy of Dean’s attention, proud of himself and of everything he had accomplished over these past days. He had come a long way. He had dared to go to the first CLCP meeting. He had dared to go to the party. He had dared to go to the LGBT+ society. He had gone out of his comfort zone and he had survived, and for him, it was a big accomplishment.
What could he do now? He considered waking Balthazar up. Usually, when he was going through phases like this, his friend would help him, giving him advice to help him make a decision. Just talking, expressing out loud what he was thinking, was usually enough for him. It helped him calm down. But he couldn’t wake Balthazar up for this.
“No one is gonna cut off Jack’s leg, Becky,” Dean intervened. “Cas is gonna take care of Jack. Did you know he’s studying to become a doctor?”
“Hum… Maybe it is the opposite for me: I’d prefer to begin with the “something more”, and then, maybe sex would develop after some time. I don’t know. It’s something I can imagine doing, but not right now.”
“It’s… locked,” Cas said, and it was the first thing he said since he had run away from the meeting. His voice sounded weird, his throat was dry. He blinked, almost surprised that he was able to talk.
Cas nodded, and started filling his glass with orange juice. But Balthazar suddenly added, “Who knows, maybe soon you’ll accept Dean’s offer and become addicted to poker and join us!”
“I think Cas and I would make a great team,” Dean said, just like that, as if he was stating something obvious. Cas gave him a puzzled look. “I have experience in the program and he’s new so I could teach him how it works. And we’re from the two different groups, so it looks like we’re a match."
“Dean, if Cas wants a big cliché Christmas, then give it to him! That’s something you would have done, before! Remember how much you liked teaching him human stuff!”
“But,” she quickly added, probably remembering his initial hesitation when she met him in the corridor, in front of the poster, a few weeks ago, “you don’t have to talk if you don’t want to. You can just stay here and listen to the others. Talking is usually the best way to feel better, but sometimes even just listening, knowing that you’re not alone experiencing some of the feelings you’re experiencing, can help. No one will judge you for who you are or what you say. But in return, of course, you have to respect all the other members of the society, not laugh at them, not criticize them… And another important rule: everything that happens here, stays here. Our meetings are based on trust, so don’t repeat what someone said outside of this room.”
Dean nodded. “Three queens, and you can make one pair of aces thanks to the one on the board…Not bad, not bad…” He stopped and looked at all the players, one by one.
Cas stared at him for a few minutes, considering what Dean just said, before asking for a confirmation: “So… that means that you…that you reciprocate my feelings?”
Dean raised an eyebrow. “Really? I’ve always wondered if anyone was really watching Netflix documentaries when there are so many awesome shows available!”
It was his voice. Of course it was. Huskier than usual, but Cas could recognize it without any hesitation. He opened his eyes, and slowly, turned around.
Cas bit into a chocolate-flavored cookie, focusing on the taste, while Dean stared at him impatiently.
“Okay, so you’ll think you’ll be ready for tomorrow?” Dean asked him in the car as they were driving back to Cas place.
Dean sighed. Yes, if Cas wanted to go on this date, there was nothing he could do to prevent him. However, it was his duty, as his friend and “human life teacher” to give him advice, and to educate him on some topics. After all, Dean was kind of an expert on the flirting field, and Cas definitely needed to hear that his profile description was NOT okay. (Even though it didn’t seem to have held Tom back).
“I know. But still… Besides, when he comes to university next year, I’ll be able to give him advice about all the dos and don’ts of university life. Any questions he has… I’ll be able to answer them.”
“Aw, Clarence, there’s nothing wrong with having a crush. We’ve all been there. And I’ll grant you that he’s super sexy. I wouldn’t say no to a night with him.”
. He knew that thinking all of this and being angry at himself wasn't going to help. He had to stop thinking. But he couldn’t stop. The thoughts kept coming at him and it was too difficult to push them away.
“I have to finish what I’m doing here, but you and Cas eat, and I’ll reheat my food later, don’t worry”
Cassie laughed and gently slapped Dean’s arm. “Oh, you… You never stop, do you? Though I have to say, you’re not wrong…” she agreed, giving Cas an appreciative look.
“It depends. Usually, at regular meetings like this, we have between 15 and 20 participants. But sometimes we organize specific events, and we can have way more students, 50, 60…”
. Dean's heart, which had started to beat faster as Cas listed all the couple activities they could do, missed a beat. He could have pictured everything,spending hours with him, driving, listening to music, watching movies, or even just talking - activities they were already doing a lot - and more: holding his hand, kissing his cheek, kissing his lips? But having sex with him? Cas was a very attractive man, and to be honest, he wouldn’t have said no to the idea, but it almost seemed secondary with Cas. Which was funny, given that in his previous relationships, sex always had been extremely important.
“I mean that, as you probably started to notice, since you talked to him for more than five minutes, he’s a bad person. He’s manipulative, he can’t be trusted, he’s snooty. In a word, he’s detestable. You should stay away from him.”
Jo, the barista that Dean knew – and that he probably knew very well, given they had plans to see each other some evenings – wasn’t working. Cas didn’t know if he was happy or not about it. On one hand, he couldn’t help feeling jealous of her, and was therefore glad he didn’t have to see her. On the other, she reminded him of Dean. And thinking about Dean was pretty pleasant.
Dean stared at him, a little taken aback, as Cas burst out laughing at his dumbstruck look. For once, it was Dean who was losing his composure... It was so unusual for him that Cas was delighted with the situation. After a while, Dean gradually began to laugh back, first softly, then frankly roaring with laughter, and it was a beautiful sound. Cas loved Dean's laugh, and more than that, he loved being the source of that laughter. Knowing that he had the power to make him so happy... was making him happy too!
Still, buying some Christmas supplies with Cas and baking some cookies with him, without going “full Christmas”, was already a small step. Maybe next Christmas, the situation would be fixed.
As Cas was walking to his tutorial the following Monday, his attention was drawn once more to the poster of the Kansas University LBGT+ Society. He read the description again, stopping on “asexual.”
“No, Cas, really. I’m telling you: this is your calling. Trust me, you don’t have to doubt it. You’re awesome, and you’ll be an awesome doctor. You have to believe in yourself, man. Because I believe in you.”
“Yes, maybe. I’m also gay, so even without talking about asexuality, I can relate to most of the experiences the other participants are sharing anyway,” Cas admitted.
to people on there, but if you had met them in real life, maybe they would have been more insistent on trying to convince you to do things you didn’t want to.”
Cas raised an eyebrow, unconvinced. Dean’s tone seemed serious…until he added, proudly grinning: “I’ll still have the six other days of the week to party!”
Suddenly feeling extremely shy and very far from his comfort zone, Cas looked down, twisting his hands, not daring to look directly at Dean.
Dean had finally shut up, and was still watching the road, his expression gradually hardening. Cas realized that Dean must have misinterpreted his lack of reaction.
Dean quickly noted down the ingredients he needed to do the cooking, cleaned the kitchen and shook Cas’s coat to remove the flour that was on it. Thirty minutes later, he met Cas, who was only wearing a black tee-shirt.
His team won – even though he didn’t really care about the results, and neither did the children, since they all got to eat Dean’s cookies. After all the children left, Dean and Cas began to do the dishes, debriefing on the activity and deciding what they would organize the next week.
This volunteer program would offer him the opportunity to be helpful, to finally feel useful, and it would be a way for him to get out of his comfort zone. In theory, it was perfect for him. But now that the meeting day was approaching, he could feel the anxiety growing. He almost wondered whether he could send an email to drop out, saying he was sick or that he wouldn’t have time to volunteer this year. But deep inside, he knew that running away wasn’t a long-term solution. The worst part would be the first day, the first meeting, because he had no idea of what to expect. After, it would be easier because he would have time to prepare himself, to visualize how things would go, how the rooms would look, who the people involved would be, before the meetings. The first time was always the worst, but he knew he could do it. He would feel very uncomfortable, but then the feeling would progressively go away. He could do it.
“But…” Cas bit his lips. He needed to be a grown-up and to break the ice, even though it terrified him. “Why?”
"My offer?" Dean repeated, increasingly confused - he had obviously not noticed the metal case that sparkled under the living room light bulb yet.
More than twenty volunteers were sitting down, most of them chatting with each other, by the time Jody cleared her throat.
…Cas might never have been in a relationship before, but he had understood the innuendo. Balthazar had already jokingly referred as his disheveled hair as “sex hair” before, and he had understood Dean’s double meaning.
Cas was indeed happy to wait outside. He needed all the fresh air he could get to calm down after what had just happened. He glanced at Dean. While Cas had been talking to Balthazar, Lisa had got close to him. She was circling his neck with her arms, and was whispering things in Dean’s ear. They were close enough for Cas to hear what she was saying.
On second thought, when he heard Cas' deep voice asking Sam if he wanted orange juice, Dean decided that coffee could wait. Stopping short before either of the other two occupants of the bunker saw him, he retreated, deciding to take a shower first. A shower was good, it would help him clear his head.
“Hey, I was being serious, don’t make fun of me!” Dean pretended to protest. “You’re lucky I’m willing to help you through this process. Do you have anything planned tonight?”
“I don’t know much about cars,” Cas admitted. “But I have to say that it’s a beautiful vehicle. What model is it?”
“Is that really what you took away from what just happened? Besides, you’re exaggerating, he was not flirting with me in front of his girlfriend!”
Moving from Washington DC and his private high school to Kansas University campus in Lawrence, and being apart from his family for the first time had considerably changed his view on life. Meeting students from other backgrounds had opened his eyes, and he was glad to have an opportunity to be helpful to the Lawrence community. He had heard about the volunteer program the year before, but he had been too shy to sign up alone. What if his help wasn’t wanted? What if he wasn’t able to help people? He had never worked before, never joined a program like that, and he was terrified that he wouldn’t be able to execute the tasks he would be assigned to do. He didn’t know what struggling to live was like; he had never had any financial problems. What if the people he was trying to help thought that he was a snob and that they didn’t need his help? He had never been a very social person, had always been an introvert. However, he knew that he had to open himself up to others. Soon, he would be an adult, and functioning adults had to interact with strangers daily. He couldn’t hide forever. That was why, when he came across a post about the volunteer program while scrolling social media on his phone, he finally decided to click on the link, and after reading all of the information and hesitating for a few days, sent an email to the organization to register. They had answered by sending him other documents and an invitation to the first meeting, where the different activities would be presented and where every volunteer could sign up for a time slot and an activity.
The next day would be mentally exhausting, so he planned to spend the evening calmly reading in his room or maybe watching some animal documentaries, an activity he found very soothing, and to go to bed early, to be fully rested the next day. The meeting was at 2 pm, but he knew that it would be difficult for him to fall asleep.
It wasn’t a date, but they ordered food, and started to eat, casually talking and joking, and Dean’s friends never joined them. It was just the two of them. It wasn’t a date, but it was looking a lot like it. Especially when Dean grabbed his wallet.
Wow. Had Dean really just given him a gift? And something quite personal, not just some random item he just bought. He had given Cas a scarf that belonged to him, that he had already worn before. And he had told Cas it looked good on him – a compliment, once again! Cas’ thoughts were racing, and he wasn’t paying attention to the game anymore. He was replaying Dean calling him “my favorite basketball referee” again and again, when he heard the scream. He jumped, startled, trying to understand what had happened.
He had not expected that his little excursion to get a snack would lead him to this scene. He had been still sleepy, not in a social mood at all, wearing clothes that could pass for pajamas, in short, in the worst conditions under which to be social and meet someone and talk to them, but against all odds, he had greatly appreciated it. Everything happened so fast, and he didn’t really realize what was going on, but now that he had some quiet alone time to think about it…He couldn’t stop thinking about that guy. Dean. He had caught him at a very unexpected time, and usually, in those circumstances, Cas wouldn’t even have paid attention to him, focused on getting back to his room. But he had felt like Dean was different.
Cas gently smiled. “Of course, Dean, we're good!” And Dean's beam was the best answer he could have received.
“I was… I was wondering… Today’s Christmas Eve, and I was wondering if you were going to do anything special for the holiday?”.
He couldn’t believe he was breaking down that badly, in the middle of the street where all his neighbors could see him. He hadn’t had such a crisis for weeks, and even months. However, it was all just too much. He was feeling betrayed, and deeply humiliated. Dean wasn’t supposed to have heard that. Cas hadn’t ever wanted him to know, and even if he had, he definitely wouldn’t have wanted him to learn about it that way. He couldn’t even remember exactly what he had said, so he didn’t know how bad it had been. But there was no way Dean hadn’t known he was talking about him. It was so embarrassing. And he couldn’t even run away permanently, because he would have to face Dean the next Saturday, for their usual tutoring session with the children. Cas had no idea how he would react. Or how Dean would react. Maybe he would pretend that nothing had happened? But Cas himself wouldn’t be able to pretend that everything was fine. He didn’t think he could even look at Dean again. Just the idea was making him cringe.
Cas looked at him, his eyes sparkling. It wasn't a date, and he couldn't be that emotional. Even when Dean made him feel like he was the hero of a romantic comedy.
“Thanks, mum,” Balthazar replied. “I’m the one with the biggest place so the guys actually asked me if I could host more often than last year. I told them I’d ask you first, they’ll be pleased that you said yes!”
“If you’re looking for the pizza, there is still some in the living room, but you’d better hurry up, we just started to eat the last one!”
“Hi, Dean, nice to see you! I was with the poker group this evening, and we miss you. Raphael is hosting a big tournament next Saturday. You think you’ll join us?”
“Okay, we’re only waiting for two more parents now, and then we’ll be alone again, free of children.”
Dean kept staring at him for a few seconds – which seemed interminable to Cas – almost in a challenging way, before moving back slightly, shaking his head and breaking the eye contact.
Friday seemed to be a long day for Cas, who found it hard to concentrate. Even Meg noticed: "Cas, please be more attentive. Your notes won't be complete and I won't be able to copy them.” Cas rolled his eyes and snapped back, "Maybe this could be a good opportunity for you to take some notes yourself, for once!” She dismissed the idea with a laugh, as if he had said something particularly funny. Frankly, her, taking notes in class? What an idea! Still, she was right, and Cas decided to turn his attention to the microbiology teacher. Perhaps focusing would help him pass the time more quickly.
“Oh, I see. That’s a good question. I have to say, no one’s shared any ace stories yet. But, even within the LGBT community, it’s not a sexual orientation that is very well known. There are still a lot of clichés and misconceptions about it, and there are probably a lot of asexual people who don’t even know they’re ace yet. Maybe one day we could prepare a little presentation of what it means to be ace.”
Cas was looking at him, his eyes very blue, a shade of concern on his face, when really, Dean should have been the one worried about Cas. Cas was the more one vulnerable, now.
“I just wanted to say, to follow up on last week’s conversations… I finally decided to come out as gay to my friends.”
“It was okay, don’t worry. You warned me before and your friends didn’t stay too long,” he smiled. “You’re allowed to host this kind of event again,” he joked.
Dean didn’t answer for a few minutes, and Cas stared at his phone, hesitating, before finally setting his mind on a last message.
“Depends, what are you watching?” Balthazar quickly came to the living-room, checking the program Cas was watching. He winced.
They had a small budget that they could use for their activities, and Dean said he could do the shopping for the ingredients. He told Cas about his favorite recipes, and Cas didn’t even realize the twenty-minute ride was already over until Dean parked in front of his place.
Cas showed him the suit with the blue tie he really liked, but never wore for going to classes, because it was too formal, and Balthazar smiled.
It was what they had planned, after all. But Dean was feeling too guilty for it. He didn’t have the courage and the energy to stay with the angel. He didn’t deserve to spend time with him.
Was he really flirting with Cas on a dating app? Maybe the last shot of whiskey he took had been too much, after all.
Cas' laughter faded a little when he heard Dean saying "buddy." "Buddy" was so... friendly! Was it because he had rejected Dean's advances at the party the week before that he had become just a friend, and had lost any chance of having more than friendship with him?
“No, no,” Balthazar answered. “I won’t be here anyway, so… It’s just that’s it’s… weird, that’s all.”
Touché. Dean was looking for something to answer, but Cas kept going. "It seems to be the only option I have to see you, lately".
He threw his food away and went back to the garage, even though he wasn’t in the mood to just enthusiastically work on his car. After a few hours spent under the hood of the Impala, Dean decided he could make a move in Cas’ direction. After all, everything was his fault. He could start by making dinner and pretending nothing happened. Cas wasn’t a resentful person, if he saw Dean take a step toward him, he probably wouldn't push him away. Proud of his resolve, he stood up, rubbing his hands on his jeans. He was covered in grease, so he decided to take a shower before going to ask Cas what he wanted to eat.
“Okay, Cas. Well, feel free to get in touch with me if you have any questions about the society or the LGBT+ community in general. I hope to see you next Sunday! 4 pm, student union building.”
Cas grinned, delighted that Dean had suggested something he would be able to do. Buying some bottles of orange juices was within his capabilities. It wasn’t much, but he would feel useful bringing those.
It was very rare that Cas came to bother Balthazar when he was in his room. Both friends had tacitly agreed over the years, that their respective rooms were a place where they could be alone if they needed to be – an unspoken rule that Cas especially liked, being an introvert. However, he knew Balthazar wouldn’t mind talking to him – unlike him, his roommate was a very social person.
He wrapped the gifts he bought, and placed them under the branches of pines he arranged. He added the tinsels and the ornaments he got in the convenience store. It didn’t look good, but it was better than nothing. Then he quickly went to the kitchen and noticed the ingredients for making the cookies were still there: Cas didn’t bake without him when he left. Dean cooked some pancakes and hot chocolate, put on one of the Christmas sweaters, let his phone in the main room playing some Christmas songs. It was SO cliché. He finally grabbed the other sweater and a cup of hot chocolate, and knocked at Cas’s door. He was so busy preparing everything that he didn’t even think about what he was going to say, and got caught off guard when Cas opened the door, facing him.
“See you next week,” Cas repeated, watching her step out into the corridor. He had never really hid his sexual orientation, but he had never talked a lot about it, especially not to people he barely knew, like Charlie. He still couldn’t believe he had talked to her so freely about it. It was nice to open up.
“Okay, then, downstairs there are three rooms that we mainly use: the activities room, the library, and the storage rooms, where we put all the games and supplies for creative workshops. Upstairs there’s also a computer room, a nap room for younger children, a bathroom, and the infirmary. Well, it’s more of a small room with a few band-aids to put on kids who fall but, still, it’s here. And we also have a small courtyard outside, with a basketball hoop. As I told you, we have everything we need to keep the kids busy!”
“Oh, yes, my head, of course!”. Cas felt ridiculous. He instinctively felt his skull for a few moments, pensive, before realizing that Dean was waiting for his answer. "It's okay, I’m fine," he hastened to answer, smiling timidly to convince him.
Dean spotted a table in one of the corners of the coffee shop and he pointed it out to Cas. They sat down, and Dean handed him his drink.
What;s more, if Cas had texted him, especially so soon after they matched, it meant he wasn’t too angry at Dean about the shaving incident. Dean felt relieved for a minute, until he came to another conclusion: if Cas had sent him a message so soon after Dean swiped right on his profile, it meant Cas probably had been using his phone at that moment… and had probably been on the app. Dean thought about Tom again, and the fact that he wanted to ask Cas on a date, and that he wanted to see Cas, meet him to be his “instructor”, and somehow, that did not seem okay for Dean. He had to go back to the bunker to tell Cas about that. Cas had no idea of how relationships worked. Maybe Tom would expect things from him that Cas wasn’t ready to offer him. Tom seemed to be a nice guy, but Dean didn’t know enough about him to let him date Cas. Cas was still fragile, still getting used to being human. He didn’t need to bother about a new relationship in addition.
"Okay, we've got about 20 minutes. Usually I do the dishes, but since you have a dishwasher... Do you have any idea of something we could do while the cookies are cooking?"
That was it. He had done it. He had invited Dean in. Why had he done that? How would he react if Dean declined the offer? Would things be weird the next day, for their volunteering session? Would…
Cas blushed a little. “For example, there are parts of what people do in a relationship - in a romantic relationship - that I know I would like to do with you, but others that I’m not really sure of.”
He and Dean couldn't be together anyway, that was a fact. Not if what Dean was looking for in a relationship was sex. Cas could sleep with Dean, but only after a long time. If he was sure. It was something he was willing to share with his boyfriend, with whom he was committed in a serious love relationship. Not with a "buddy,” drunk after a party.
The cleaning didn’t take too much time – it was just putting the drawing supplies and the board games back into the supply room, and soon they sat down in the kitchen. Cas prepared two glasses of apple juice while Dean served the pie.
He forced himself not to blush. He had tried to sound casual, but internally his thoughts were racing and he felt a wave of embarrassment washing through him. He had suggested that he and Dean take the bus together to go to the Center. For him, it felt like a big move. But he knew that, objectively, it wasn’t. There was nothing weird about suggesting that they go there together. They were partners, after all. It was in Dean’s interest that Cas didn't get lost while traveling to the center. It was a completely normal thing to say. Dean would not think he had a crush on him just because he had suggested that.
“Perfect, then let’s grab a coffee, we have a lot to talk about – and I also have a lot of questions for you, Cas!”
Slowly, Dean turned to face Cas. He carefully looked at him, trying to notice whether something had changed, but no. Cas was the same as usually; or at least, the same as he had been since he became human. Not that human Cas was much different from when he was still an angel, his personality hadn’t changed. However, he was breathing now. He was eating, and drinking, and sleeping, and going to the bathroom, and showering. He was getting tired now, and was sometimes yawning when it was late. But, according to Dean, the most significant change was that now Cas wasn’t constantly wearing the same outfit anymore. He still had his suit and his trench coat, of course, and when they were going out, it was his favorite outfit, the one he was the most confident and comfortable in. However, when he was at the bunker, he dressed more casually, especially at night – because, of course, no one sleeps with dress pants and a tie – and borrowed a few of Dean and Sam’s clothes (mostly Dean’s, though; most of Sam’s clothes were too big for Cas. They also bought new clothes for him, but for some reason, he liked to sleep in Dean’s worn-out shirts.
In his life, Dean had fallen asleep more often thanks to alcohol than to herbal teas, but he preferred not to pick up on Cas' remark.
“Oh, really? Well, I heard he bats for both teams, maybe he could volunteer to help you to relax? Given his reputation, I’m sure he wouldn’t mind.”
She walked away with a perky step, and Cas watched her disappear around the corner, and then shifted his attention back to the poster. Quickly, he pulled out his phone to take a picture of the information about the meeting hours. It didn't commit him to anything, after all.
Balthazar nodded. “Thanks Cas, I appreciate it. I’ll let the others know, but be aware that we might really take your word for it and invade the living-room two times a month!”
Forty-five minutes later, after his stomach gurgled for the fourth time in ten minutes, he finally decided to look away from his phone and to get up. He took a deep breath and opened the door, ready to face the crowd waiting for him outside his room. He was surprised to see that the corridor was dark, and by the relative feeling of quietness in it. He could hear people talking in the living room, but no one was actually shouting or singing. It wasn’t a big party. Luckily, he didn’t need to go through the living room to get to the kitchen. He crossed the corridor and walked past the open door of the room where the gathering was taking place. He glanced into the room: four students, including Balthazar, were sitting around the table, in the middle of a poker game. Around them, two girls were carefully watching the game with beers in their hands. Finally, a boy and a girl - probably a couple, given their proximity - were sharing the leftover pizzas, sitting on the couch. No one seemed to notice Cas, so he dashed to the kitchen, relieved that he wouldn’t have to socialize. He opened one of the high cupboards, looking for bread to prepare a sandwich.
“Yes I am, actually, I’m wondering whether I’m dreaming because… Even in my dreams, I couldn’t have hoped for a better outcome, and reality is so much better than my dreams, but…”
“It’s the first time he’s joined a program like this,” the mother explained, “but I’m a single mother and I have this new job, and I have shifts on Saturday afternoon, and…”
“That being said, I’m not sex-repulsed,” he resumed. “I’m not against the idea of having sex, if it’s something that my future boyfriend desires. A metaphor I found online said that you don’t have to be hungry to eat. You can even like what you eat, and want to eat it, even if you don’t feel the need to. I’m telling you this, because at first I was really confused, and didn’t get why I could be curious about sex, and as I said, I’m not absolutely against it… I do have a libido, I do… sometimes, I…”
“Dean, I care a lot about you, and when I first talked about you, my coworkers asked if you were my partner, or at least if I was in love with you, because they said how I described you wasn’t “platonic” He really used air quotes, a gesture that Dean found quite adorable. “But then they made those… jokes, those sexual jokes, and…”
And Dean didn't know he was asexual and was uncomfortable talking about sex. Everyone else laughed at his dirty jokes; Cas was the one being weird, and making the situation weird, and Dean didn't deserve that. Dean always had been great and friendly with him, and he had never hidden that he liked flirting with everyone. So really, it was entirely Cas' fault.
Charlie remained silent, nodding at Cas to make him understand he could choose whether he wanted to tell Dean or not.
Sam was the only explanation. But why didn’t he tell Dean about it? For a minute, Dean considered asking him. Then he remembered he couldn’t, because telling Sam he saw Cas on the dating app would force him to reveal he was himself on the dating app – and was looking at male profiles. Which led Dean to gasp one more time: it meant that Cas himself had set his profile to see male profiles. Cas was interested in men. Was Cas gay? Or bisexual? Dean tried to think about every time he saw Cas interacting with men, looking for hints of him being gay. Why didn’t Dean notice it? Why didn’t Cas tell them?
“That’s what I do when I wake up and can’t go back to sleep”, Cas insisted. “It usually helps”, he says, pointing at the cup in front of him, on the table.
“Yes,” Ben agreed, joining the conversation. “Is it because he won at FIFA against you? It's okay, Cas, he had more time to practice and he got the best controller. Next time you could switch!”
“Aromanticism describes someone who doesn’t feel romantic attraction towards other people. Asexuality means someone who doesn’t feel sexual attraction towards other people. You can be aromantic and not asexual, or asexual and not aromantic. Or both.”
He arrived in front of the building 25 minutes early, but didn’t try to go in; the people from the program would probably find it weird that he was there so early. He saw a few students going into the building while he paced in front of the entrance. Ten minutes before the meeting, he went in to find the room. He had planned to wait five more minutes in front of the door, but a woman with long blond hair noticed him sneaking glances inside.
Balthazar didn’t insist, and Cas was thankful for that. Once they arrived at their apartment, but before Cas disappeared into his room, his roommate still called to him, with a serious tone that he didn’t use often.
They were quite close together, both of them sitting on the couch, but they were not touching each other. Nevertheless, Cas could feel Dean's presence by his side; his smell, the space he occupied. He even could hear his breathing, and his low voice was very close to his ears. The sensation was exhilarating, and it went to his head - a bit like he was drunk, even though he hadn't had a single drop of alcohol. He tried to remember the poker terms for Dean, who was patiently and passionately explaining to him the value of the cards, but all he could think of was Dean, who was so close to him. All he had to do was reach out and touch him. But why wasn’t Dean trying anything? Was Cas the only one who felt the tension between them?
“Well, it's your choice, but I'd be happy if you joined us. Dean would be glad, too, by the way. He's always asking about you.”
“Oh, hey! What a surprise, I wasn't expecting to see you! A good surprise, of course! What was your name again? Dan? Carl?”
“So did you decide what you're going to drink?” Dean suddenly asked, breaking their eye contact and the silence at the same time.
Balthazar stopped talking when he saw the lack of reaction from both Dean and Cas. They had stepped aside a little bit, but were still standing pretty close to each other. Balthazar looked alternatively at each of them.
Cas decided to ignore her. No need to start a debate about it to explain to her why he was not interested in “getting laid”.
Cas went crimson and let out a little noise. “Oh, no, no, I wasn’t…I didn’t mean…Well, I meant…We’re gonna w-work together for the…for the entire year…With, you know, the volunteer project, since we’re in the same…” he stuttered, incredibly embarrassed.
Cas regretted saying that the moment he said it – it was too much. A friend wouldn’t have said that. Dean would know that Cas had a crush on him, and he would be uncomfortable. This was stupid of him, and… And Dean beamed at him, apparently very pleased with Cas’ answer. Cas decided to stop talking, and he smiled back, and suddenly a horn sounded, and Cas realized they were in front of his place, and that a car was waiting behind them for Dean to start the car again. Cas grabbed his bag and opened the door.
“Okay, okay, you convinced me. I wasn’t trying to judge your tastes in videos, don’t worry. I’ll give it a try. Maybe you can suggest a few documentaries for me to watch?”
Dean didn’t finish his question, but Cas nodded once to express his consent anyway. He was still looking into Dean’s eyes, until he felt Dean’s fingers lightly brushing his eyelid.
Cas shook his head. “That’s what I thought. Have a nice afternoon with your car, Dean. I’ll manage on my own”.
He and Dean just weren’t compatible. It was a shame, but it was a fact. And pining for the guy wouldn’t bring him anything good.
yesterday. I sent you a message this morning! But you didn't answer me, maybe you haven't logged on to the app yet, today?"
The girl next to him didn’t even look at her cards. “Call," she said, adding two chips to Balthazar’s.
“It’s short for Children of Lawrence Community Program. Don’t worry, I’ll explain all the details when the meeting starts. You can sit if you want, we’re waiting another five minutes and then we’ll start. Thanks again!”
Cas sadly shook his head. “I’m not sure, Dean. When I told that to my coworkers…” Dean wondered how much had Cas told to his coworkers. “...They were really surprised and said that it was weird. That I was weird for not…wanting that”.
“Well, I saw the expression on your face, and I took pity on you. I’ve been stuck with Raphael before. I know how dull that dude can be.”
. Did Balthazar also know about Cas' asexuality? There was no way he knew about it, Cas never mentioned it. But his roommate and childhood friend knew him well enough to be able to say that indeed, Cas wasn’t the kind of guy to flirt and try to hook up with everyone at parties. Though, now that he’d gotten to know Dean better, Cas wasn’t so sure that Dean was that kind of guy either. Sure, he had a reputation. Meg and Balthazar both told him about it. And sure, he was a flirty person, who liked to wink. And sure, Cas saw him with Jo the barista, with Cassie at Café-in, even with the girl called Lisa at the first poker night. But he never actually saw him kissing any of those girls, for example.
“No Cas. This, what we have…. This is special. And I don’t ever want to mess up with that again! I’m so sorry, Cas!”
Knowing that he would soon be able to “deal with" this question, Cas felt lighter. His Saturday afternoon with Dean and the children went way better than the week before. Cas had been angry, but not really angry at Dean, mostly angry at himself, because he had let himself hope for nothing, and because he had buried his asexuality, thinking that ignoring it would make it less real and would make him more
“Hi, Dean! How are you today?” interrupted the barista, a girl with long blonde hair and a big smile.
“You’ll see, Cas, our meetings are pretty informal. I usually moderate the debates as the President, but other than that… Everyone can share something if they want, an experience, a thought they had… The idea is to provide a safe place for young LGBT students to talk.”
“I would personally not say no, if he needs any instructor in that matter”, Tom continued. “I bet we could…”
Charlie nodded, understanding. Cas smiled and kept listening to the other students sharing their stories. He felt good at these meetings. He didn’t regret joining the society. At the end of the meeting, Charlie waited for the other participants to leave, to talk to him.
“And, by the way, later doesn’t have to be today. My offer still stands for another time, if you ever want some private lessons. It would be a shame for you to miss out on what a great game poker is!”
Turned out that, in fact, Cas was delighted with his presents: cooking tools, a cooking book, two pairs of funny socks with Christmas patterns on them, candy canes and gingerbread men, and an apron, so that Cas doesn’t get dirty anymore when he cooks. Everything was fine, until suddenly Cas froze, looking panicked.
Cas’ voice broke a little, and he had to stop talking for a few seconds. However, it was clear he wasn’t done, and no one said anything. The other students just waited patiently for him to be ready to resume his speech. He took another big breath.
Stuck between them, Cas didn’t know how to react. He couldn’t tell whether the argument was serious or not. Apparently it was a topic they frequently discussed. Luckily, something happened during the game, because suddenly Benny shouted:
“Too bad.” Dean took a step closer to him and leaned in the direction of his left ear. “Because I really like your style tonight. That tie matches your eyes. You look very hot like this, Cas,” he whispered.
The barista shook her head in disbelief but still laughed slightly as if it wasn’t the first time that Dean had acted that way with her.
“That’s one of the reasons, yes. But it’s not the only one. I come from a rich family, I never had any financial problems, never had to suffer from it when I was a child, but I know that’s not the case for everyone. So it only seems fair to help kids who weren’t as lucky as me. So yes, a way of feeling useful, of helping others. And also a way to challenge me, to get out of my comfort zone. If I only listened to myself, I would spend my evenings and weekends locked in my room to avoid seeing people, because it’s easier and less scary. But… I know I can’t do that forever. That’s not how life is. Sooner or later, I’ll have to face the world, I can’t hide in my room forever, so…”
Cas’ heart skipped a beat. Making theories in his head, hoping on his own that maybe Dean could like him back was one thing, but hearing Balthazar, who was neutral about the situation, who knew both of them, and who was quite skeptical about the possibility of a relationship between them, say it out loud was something else. Something that made it more real, somehow.
She just nodded, and Cas understood that this was her way of expressing her gratitude. The fact that she didn’t leave him on a sarcastic note proved that she cared about that soccer player.
“Good afternoon! You’re here for the Children of Lawrence Community Program?” asked Dean, very professionally.
Embarrassed, Cas squirmed in his chair. Luckily – and quite unexpectedly, coming from her – Meg saved him.
He nodded again, letting his knee – that he was still holding – go. Cas gently pulled the pants up along his leg. Indeed, the skin was slightly scratched and bleeding a little, but Cas could see without any problem that the wound was superficial. He offered Jack a reassuring smile.
. But as if it was nothing important. Cas was still explaining his reasoning, and Dean had no other choice than to listen to him:
“Well, we have a poker night at Raphael’s tomorrow. That’s why I won’t be here. And I’m surprised that Dean would miss it.”
What was happening? Was he really playing the role of wingman for Cas? And why was it bothering him?
“Well, tonight will be my first party and probably my only chance to make a “first impression” on your friends…”
Now, Cas was fully improvising. Even though he hadn’t planned to talk about Dean the way he had, he already knew how he felt about him. However, those thoughts about his asexuality were completely new. But true.
Cas wasn’t understanding. Did he say something wrong? What did he do? He re-read the texts he sent, not getting what had shocked Dean.
So Cas was really picturing him and Dean in a romantic relationship? He apparently gave it a lot of thought, and he was mentioning it as if it was something ordinary, when Dean was struggling to not stop him to ask him time to process all this information.
“Hey, Dean, it’s fine! You don’t have to put a label on what you’re experiencing. I’m… Really surprised to hear that you might be on the asexuality spectrum. And whether you’re ace or not, it’s okay. It doesn’t freak me out, because I knew it from the start… I thought the only thing you wanted would be to be friends with benefits, that’s why I thought we couldn’t be together…”
What? That was even more unexpected, and Cas was more and more confused about how the conversation was going.
When Cas woke up, he was lying on the couch, a blanket that was usually on one of the armchairs on top of him. He wasn't wearing his shoes anymore. The TV was off. He blinked a few times, confused, trying to remember how he had ended up falling asleep on the couch. And suddenly it all came back to him. Dean. The cookies, poker, the documentary... He probably had fallen asleep while they were watching TV, and Dean had put him down on the couch before he left. He was torn between a feeling of shame and embarrassment, and a feeling of comfort and softness at the idea that this was more proof that Dean was adorable and caring. He looked at his watch. 5 am. He could go back to his bed to finish his night, but he felt good where he was. Dean had been sitting there, a few hours ago. They had shared a moment, even though he had fallen asleep. Dean had taken care of him, made sure he would be comfortable to sleep, took off his shoes for him, found a blanket to make sure he wouldn’t be cold. That felt so domestic, and Cas’ heart felt warm.
“Yeah, that’s what you told me yesterday, all the things we could do together, like holding hands, hugging, watching TV, kissing,“ Dean confirmed. “And asexual? I’m not exactly sure what it means exactly, but it does sound like what you described yesterday, don’t you think?”
Dean's heart was pounding, and he was having trouble keeping a clear head. Fortunately, there was little traffic at this time of night, otherwise he could have quite easily caused an accident. Cas wanted to talk to him, and he didn’t seem angry. He just seemed…Cas. Their small conversation had been enough to change Dean’s plans. He initially had thought he would meet Cas to prepare him for his date with Tom, to warn him against him, maybe… However, now, he was the one who almost had a date with him. Dean smirked. If only Tom knew that!
“Maybe I can take a look. I’m not an expert with computers, but maybe a fresh pair of eyes will help," he suggested.
I think that this chapter is my favorite one, there are a lot of very adorable scenes. I hope you'll enjoy it too!
“Okay,” Dean said, still very gently. “Take your time. And don’t worry, okay? Everything is fine. It’s alright.”
He looked at Charlie, because of course, that last sentence was for her. He wasn’t an idiot, and Charlie wasn’t an idiot either, and there was no way she didn’t know he was talking about Dean. However, even though she was one of Dean’s closest friends, Cas trusted her to not tell him what she heard. He only had to hope that she wasn’t the kind of person to get chatty once she was drinking alcohol…
Later, in his room, while he was trying to fall asleep, Cas thought a lot about the conversation he had with Meg.
Cas bowed his head in acknowledgment. So Dean’s friends would be there, after all. Good. That was what was planned. Cas tried to not be disappointed. He had appreciated the hour he had just spent alone with Dean – which really had felt like a date, even if it wasn’t one.
Dean dismissed the remark with a wave of his hand. “Maybe, but that’s not the point… Why did you do it?”
“You won’t bother me. Never. I’m glad you asked me. Your kitchen will make baking much easier. And…”. He stopped, and Cas kept staring at him, mesmerized by the confidence and the calm steadiness that came from him. “And your presence will make it better, too,” he said softly.
“Um, actually… I didn’t hear yet… I was wondering if you knew whether, in the society, there were other asexual students?”
Dean came into the room as Cas was making Jack choose what kind of design he wanted on the band-aid.
“I’m sorry if we woke you up, Balthazar told us you didn’t want to be bothered, but we didn’t think you would be asleep so early, otherwise we would have been quieter and made sure the living room door was closed!”
He stopped, not really knowing where he wanted to go with his sentence. He didn’t even know why he was confessing all of this to Dean; he usually didn’t talk a lot about his feelings, except occasionally with Balthazar.
Cas knew himself, and although he'd never had a boyfriend, he had fallen in love in the past. He knew how to recognize the signs and how to stop himself. The previous time, he hadn’t anticipated it, hadn’t been able to recognize the feeling, and by the time he had realized it, it had been too late; he had already fallen in love. With Dean, it would be different. From the very beginning, he would deny himself all hope so he wouldn't be disappointed. Yes, it definitely sounded like a good plan. He was already feeling better about the situation, less disappointed by the fact that Dean would be having a date with the barista that evening.
Cas stepped even further away from Dean, shaking his head. “No, no, of course not. I was actually going back to my room. I’ll let you talk about poker. See you tomorrow, Dean?”
“You know what, Cas? I’m hesitating between advising you to wear something really casual, to blend in, like I think you’d like, or suggesting that you wear something that fits you, that you like, and that looks good on you… But then people would notice, which you may not like.”
Dean stood up, and Cas watched him walking to his car, still unsure of what was happening. What was Dean doing here? Why was he acting as if nothing had happened and being even more soft than usual? What had he heard? What was happening? He was too exhausted to think, and maybe it was better that way, because otherwise he would have just freaked out and felt too embarrassed and humiliated to stand in front of Dean. He watched Dean coming back with his bag and his coat, looking in the pocket to grab the keys, trying a few keys until he found the right one, and opening the door.
“That’s not that I don’t want to prepare him a nice little Christmas Sammy, that’s that I can’t. Man, I’d love to just share a perfect Christmas with him, making hot chocolate, Christmas cookies, building gingerbread houses, decorating a Christmas tree, wearing matching Christmas sweaters… But I can’t!”
“I think I identified the problem,” he announced. He clicked on one of the options. “See, you have to select “duplicate the screen” for the computer screen to be displayed through the projector as well."
He was already different from the others: he was gay, he was socially awkward, introverted. He was anxious. And now, apparently, he wasn’t even experiencing attraction the same way other people did.
Cas’ blood froze as he sensed the panic in Dean’s voice. He quickly reached the group. Jack Kline, one of the youngest kids, was holding his knee, sobbing.
Cas’ guts twisted. No. It couldn’t be possible. He refused to believe he understood what she meant. She was probably talking about someone else. There was no way that…
Okay so the guy wasn’t even trying to seduce him anymore? It was almost offensive to Dean at this point. That said, it didn't really surprise him: of course he couldn't compete with Cas. Dean couldn't blame Tom. Besides, he wasn't even interested in him. Sure, Tom was attractive, and the idea of finally being able to openly flirt with a man was very appealing to Dean, but...something was holding him back, and he couldn't explain what. Tom had probably understood that Dean was not in the mood, and that is why he was trying to get more information about Cas.
Cas almost spilled the bottle. Did Balthazar know? Did he guess? Had he been too obvious? He turned to his roommate to check his expression. Apparently, Balthazar was only joking. Cas sighed, relieved.
“Oh, yes, sorry Cas, I didn’t even explain the basics to you!” he realized, a little embarrassed. “But don’t worry, by the end of the game, you’ll be an expert! So, basketball 101: there are two teams, five players on the court and the goal is to score by throwing the ball into the basket…”
Cas hesitated. Charlie gave him an encouraging smile. He really liked her, she seemed to be a very nice person, but… no, Cas didn’t feel ready yet.
“Wait, Cas… I get that you thought I could be angry about it - even though, I can assure you, I am not - but why…why did you use this dating app if you knew what you were feeling towards me was different?”
“I’ll just… go back to my room”, Dean stuttered before leaving – or more like fleeing – the kitchen, awkwardly walking backward until he reached the door and then turning away and quickly walking back to his room.
Had he, though? Or was Cas just making something up? Dean seemed to be a very kind, friendly, and popular guy. He probably acted with Cas the way he acted with everybody else. Besides, Dean was an extremely good-looking, self-assured guy. Why on earth would he be interested in someone like Castiel? Cas had been wearing pajamas. Cas had been stuttering. His hair had been a total mess. He had stupidly jumped from surprise and hit his head on the cupboard. There had been absolutely
Cas blushed and ran a hand through his hair, looking at his feet, suddenly aware of his sleeping outfit: an old, worn shirt, plain sweatpants, and bare feet. He usually liked to wear button-down shirts, fancy crew-neck pullovers, or nice polo shirts, even when he was with his friends, and he almost felt naked. In comparison, the guy was wearing a casual outfit, nothing fancy, but it made him look cool and at ease: blue jeans with an open plaid shirt over a dark t-shirt. He had a metal pendant hanging from a leather string, and Cas wondered briefly what it represented.
Then they went back to the living-room for Dean to collect his things to leave, but they got lost in the conversation and ended up talking about classes for a while, before Dean finally said (with regret?) that he really had to go back to his residence to finish preparing his tutorial for the next day.
“Alright, anyone wants to start the discussion, today? Anyone wanna share something that struck them during the week?”
Dean nodded. “Okay, yeah. You’re right.” He glanced at Jack, still lying on the ground. “You’re sure you’ll be fine?”
Cas nodded, trying to look calm and collected when both his heart and his mind were racing. He repeated to himself that it wasn’t a date. It wasn’t a date. It was just two friends going to a basketball game together. Those kinds of things happened all the time. Plus, Dean’s other friends would be there. It would be full of Dean’s friends. Cas was just another friend among all of Dean’s friends, and Dean had a lot of friends. How many of them would be there?
And he just left the confused angel in the middle of the Christmas sweaters, trying to escape the strange atmosphere as soon as he could.
Yeah, it wasn’t the most conventional description for a dating app… But everything in it screamed, “Cas,” and Dean almost smiled. He would need to give Cas a lesson or two about flirting and romantic vocabulary.
“Yes, Tom. Do you know him?” Cas asked, curiously, before deducing, triumphant, “Oh, right! From the dating app! I keep forgetting you are using it as well!”
“You don’t feel like a real human because you don’t care about sex?” Dean summarized, slightly incredulous.
“Apparently. I… I have to say, I’m a little bit confused, I didn’t expect this conversation to take this turn… So just to clarify, does it mean that… That we… That you…?”
“Guys, sit down, the game’s starting!” said a boy that was sitting next to Charlie. Cas didn’t know him.
Cas waited a few seconds for Dean to say anything, then grabbed the door to close it, realizing that the hunter wasn’t going to talk.
Thank you to C. who always supports me very enthusiastically in all my projects (and she doesn't even know neither Supernatural nor fanfictions!)
“No, it’s downtown," Dean answered. "We have to take the bus, but don’t worry, we can go together, I won’t let you get lost on the streets of Lawrence!”
“Okay, that doesn’t look too bad. There is disinfectant and bandages inside. Do you think you can get up so that we can go clean the wound?”
For one moment, Cas just stood there, staring at him, and Dean was suddenly afraid that he’d slam the door in his face and not come. But looking more carefully at Cas’s eyes, he noticed that his friend wasn’t angry. The glow in his eyes was in fact one of surprise and disbelief. And suddenly, Cas just grabbed him and squeezed him tight. The cup of hot chocolate fell on the ground but Dean couldn’t care less. He hugged him back. The hug lasted a long time, Cas didn’t let him go, still squeezing tight, his forehead on Dean’s shoulder. Dean finally let go patted him on the back.
He walked towards the door. Cas thought the moment was definitely over, and he looked at Dean leaving the room, trying to collect his thoughts about what had just happened, when, suddenly, Dean stopped. He looked back over his shoulder and caught Cas' gaze once more.
However, he knew that was just how Meg was; she wasn’t nice for no reason. And the fact that she had asked if he was okay in the first place was proof that she really cared about him.
Cas felt nauseous. Here they were again, making suggestive comments. He felt very uncomfortable, and couldn’t wait for Balthazar to arrive so that they could go back to their place. Luckily, his roommate didn’t take too long getting out of the bar.
He got out of the car, awkwardly waved at Dean, and watched his car restart and disappear around the corner of the street. With a smile still on his face, he entered the house where he was greeted by Balthazar, who was lazily watching TV in the living room.
“What do you mean, someone like you? We’re not cool enough for you? Don’t forget you’re as much of a nerd as me!”
As they walked a few steps down the sidewalk, going away from the bar, Dean's voice, a little more hoarse than usual, called out to Cas one last time.
“Yeah, it’s a lot,” Dean said, swinging his arm behind Cas’ shoulders to pull him to him and hug him tenderly, “and you see, you can’t say that 1% of humans are flawed. Which means that asexual humans exist, and you’re not less of a human because you don’t feel sexual attraction or whatever. It doesn’t matter. Not to me, at least. As long as you’re happy and comfortable”.
Wow, wow, wow. Was Dean really gonna talk about Cas’ sex life with this stranger? Did Cas have a sex life? What did he tell Tom? And why was Tom telling him that, anyway? What kind of guy was discussing a common match with the guy he was trying to hit on? Was he about to suggest the three of them have a threesome, or? (No. Dean definitely shouldn’t think about that. Because images were forming in his head, and this was absolutely not the time. Not that there was an appropriate time to imagine Cas doing that, anyway.)
. Dean shook his head and looked at his phone once again. Cas' picture was still there. Under it, his name ‘Castiel' and his age ‘45’. Cas didn’t complete the occupation section of his profile. His description was quite long, however, and…not the most fitting for a dating app.
The kids enthusiastically expressed their agreement, and Cas watched them walk away. He couldn’t believe that a few minutes ago, Dean was on the verge of panicking, and that right now he was so confidently and strongly taking care of the kids. It was impressive.
He thought about the party the entire day. By 5:00 he still hadn’t made up his mind about it. He’d never been to such a party before, let alone in a bar. However, these past few weeks, he had gone out of his comfort zone, especially with the volunteering program, but also more generally, opening himself up to Dean for example, and it always benefited him. He knew he was making progress with his anxiety management, and he wanted to keep going in that direction. Besides, he was pretty curious to see Dean’s behavior in that kind of setting. So far, he’d mainly seen Dean with the children. He’d seen him alone, in his car, and at the first poker event with a few friends in a really casual and relaxed atmosphere. But he had heard about Dean’s partygoer reputation, and he wanted to witness it for himself to see if it was true or if people were overreacting. Plus, going to a party at a bar had been on his “student classics to-do list” for a while; so far he hadn’t acted on it because he had never had an opportunity. But at least, that was a good reason to try it tonight; if he didn’t like it, he could always go back home early. He didn’t need to stick with Balthazar.
Yet, Dean had said that his messy bed hair looked good? And all those winks? Cas had never seen someone winking that much in such a short period of time. Maybe Dean was just a winking person in general, and not only with him? But he also had offered to teach him how to play poker. Then again, something that a nice guy like Dean would probably offer to anyone. Even Balthazar had said that Dean was “easygoing.” There was nothing special about Cas that justified any special behavior from Dean. Dean might not even be gay! He probably wasn’t!
“That’s okay, Cas. Why didn’t you tell me about this? Maybe I could have helped you out,” Dean said, softly.
Jack nodded enthusiastically, and followed Cas to the kitchen, while Dean was welcoming the parents and saying goodbye to the first kids who were leaving.
“Becoming human…changed a lot of things,” Cas started. “I now have new needs - sleeping, eating, drinking - but I also experience different sensations, and…think differently? I quickly realized there were new thoughts, new feelings I was experiencing, feelings I could already perceive as an angel but that are stronger now, that I can’t ignore as I could before?”
Without noticing it, Cas found himself walking to Café-in. Dean said he often went there. Maybe he would see him?
“Not recently,” Dean admitted. “But still… I remembered seeing some clips on TV when I was a kid, and it was always the same… lions running in the savanna hunting antelopes… Boring!”
He had offered out of politeness, but he had absolutely no desire to clean up at that very moment. He just wanted to go back to his room and enjoy the two hours of quiet he had left before the house would be invaded by a dozen partying students.
“Well, I fell on the ground while playing basketball and it hurt a lot, and Becky said that maybe the doctors would need to cut off my leg, but then Cas healed me, and I feel way better now!”
“It does help, what you’re saying,” he said. “Even though the children will probably like you more than me. Especially if we go with the bad cop/good cop strategy you suggested…”
Very gently, Dean pushed aside some of the locks of hair that had spread across Cas' forehead with the rain. He seemed very unsure, almost afraid of doing something wrong. His fingers were shaking a little, and then he took his hand away from Cas’ face.
“Why can’t you just be normal, Cas? Normal people don’t worry about what clothes to wear for this kind of meeting. Calm down now."
Dean sat in the other seat, between Benny and him. There was still one seat free, next to Benny, but there was a coat on it – a coat that, once again, seemed familiar to Cas.
Cas was searching his bag to grab the book when the door of the coffee shop opened. Automatically he looked in that direction, and his heart missed a beat. The new customer was Dean. And of course, he was accompanied by a very beautiful girl.
“I’m sure you’d be a great player, though,” Balthazar observed. “I really like your style, I could totally see you bluffing. You never tried to play?”
“Yeah, well, don’t count on that too much. I’m not planning on turning into a party boy this year. I have to get top grades if I want to get into med school after my undergrad.”
Dean nodded. “Cool,” he said, and Cas wondered if they were really talking about cleaning the room and eating pie.
“Okay, so it isn’t that big, but it has everything we need. First, let’s put the food in the kitchen…”
And last but not least, a BIG thank you to A., who is probably the one who heard me the most talking about this fic. He supported me at every hour of day and night, helping me to calculate and plan my word count, to use HTML to post this fic, and help me to find solutions for every little worries I had during this entire challenge.
He combed his hair, but it would probably still be a little bit wet when he went outside, and therefore would probably become slightly tangled, as it often did. He used to hate it, but now he didn’t care anymore. It was just a part of him, and probably the only thing he couldn’t control – aside from his thoughts. Even though he was always clean-shaven and had impeccably pressed shirts, he still had a few strands of rebellious hair left, to remind him that, no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t be perfect.
“Because… Because that’s something I’d like to do. I’d like to do this too much, Sam. And I don’t deserve it. I don’t deserve to be so happy after what I did to him”.
“A sixty-seven Chevrolet Impala. My father gave it to me when I decided to go to college to study mechanical engineering.”
“Well, I’m no more experienced than you are… So I’m not going to give you any useful advice, but still… I guess the most important thing is that you don’t put pressure on yourself, and focus on enjoying the moments you spend with him, for now. You’ll make things official soon enough.”
Cas nodded. “I think so. But, Sam, if there are words to describe these feelings - or that lack of feelings - does that mean that I am not the only one?”
"Oh hi, Cas," Dean said, trying to adopt a casual tone to hide the fact he was feeling very ill-at-ease.
He did some quick research on the Internet about basketball beforehand, to not look like a complete fool in front of Dean’s friends, but at least he had an excuse: Dean knew he wasn’t familiar with basketball, and wasn’t expecting him to be an expert on the topic anyway.
“You know, I like being the cool grown-up for the children, not the one who's annoying them with boring stuff like homework!”
Opening his wardrobe, Cas wondered what he could wear. How did people dress up to go to parties? It was something really new for him. And, most importantly… What would Dean like? Meg had told him that Dean had also flirted with boys before, even if Cas had only seen him with girls, so he was probably bisexual. Still, he had no idea whether Dean could like him – not because he was a boy, but because of who he was. He decided to ask Balthazar what he would be wearing, and get his advice on the right outfit.
Dean grinned before finally showing his cards. “It seems that I have more than one ace to play! Aces full, three aces and a pair of queens!”
He dramatically left the kitchen, slamming the door, and Dean sighed, pushing his plate away to grab his head and rest his elbows on the table. Suddenly, he wasn’t hungry anymore. Why couldn’t he act like an adult? Why did he always have to ruin everything? They’d had a good dynamic before this. He was teaching Cas to be human, and it was nice. Cas had never stayed with them so long before, and it was really good to have him here.
Sam smiled warmly. “Oh no, you’re not the only one. A study even said that 1% of the population is asexual.”
Oh. Cas was mortified. What a blunder! He was the worst. The conversation had been easy, light-hearted, everything going great, and he had to ask a stupid question that ruined everything. How silly!
Dean stood up. “Come on, Cas." He pulled on Cas’ sleeve to get him to follow. “Sorry I volunteered us so quickly, but I knew that the first ones to pair up would be the first ones to choose their groups and times, so…”
“No problem,” Charlie repeated. “Just feel free to intervene at any moment of the discussion, or to even interrupt me to ask a question if there’s something you don’t understand. We might use some vocabulary that you won’t know, but you can find the definitions of all those words on our website. I can send you the link, if you want.”
He watched Dean leave the kitchen to grab his belongings in another room. He was just adorable, and Cas was definitely completely in love with him.
Dean took a look at him. The guy seemed to be in his late thirties, like him. He didn’t look too sketchy. Dean was almost sure he’d never seen him before, yet his face seemed familiar.
“Sorry, I really have to go. Thanks again for the tea recommendation. I still prefer coffee, though. Anyway, I’ll see you next week? In the meantime, don’t forget to hit me up if you have any questions!”
Cas snapped his fingers and Dean's wrist shackles undid themselves, Dean dramatically falling to his knees. "I have been so kind to you, pet. Time for you to return the favour." Dean's gag was pulled down again to his neck. "You better suck it well, baby. Suck it like your ass depends on it. Because it does."
"Dean," Cas began, cementing that he wasn't expecting any of their normal rules to apply here. "I'm just worried. I don't understand what triggered it."
Contains themes of a sexual nature, including a BDSM sub/dom style relationship. There's also a panic attack written about in detail based on my own personal experiences, so it should feel quite real. Includes Dean's general feeling of self-hatred as well. Just watch out for that and please don't read if you feel it'll negatively affect you.
The other man's face softened into a gentle smile. "I know, Cas. I love you too." Cas couldn't help himself. He placed a gentle kiss to Dean's lips smiling into it. He loved being Dean's dom. But he lived for the soft moments that came with just being his boyfriend. Not wanting Dean to lose momentum, Cas placed feather-light kisses along his jaw, gently sucking as he went. His lips traced all the way up to that sweet spot that sat just at the corner of Dean's jaw, revelling in the strangled moan that came from his lover's lips.
"Alright, pet," Cas smiled wickedly, pushing the blindfold back down the other man's eyes. "Playtime."
Cas shot out of bed, the furniture creaking with the sudden movement and swiftly left the room, uncaring that he was going through the bunker naked. Sam and Jack weren't there to stop him anymore. A few short minutes later, he returned with two bowls. Dean shivered as he heard the ice clinking against the glass of one of them. Oh, what now?
"I want to play, pet," Cas said in the most sinful voice Dean had ever heard. He felt his half-hard erection bob with excitement.
“I just need you to say it back, Dean. Please. I need to hear that what you said isn’t true. You don’t mean anything you said, right?” Cas could feel himself starting to panic again. “Dean, you don’t mean it. Please tell me that you didn’t mean it and you love me. SAY IT BACK! CHUCK, JACK, MICHAEL, LUCIFER. I DON’T CARE WHO. TAKE ME AND GIVE HIM BACK!”
Cas didn’t know how long he had been wallowing, just that he should probably check on dean. Oh, joy. He swayed a little as he hoisted himself to his feet, cradling his bleeding head in his hands. Sam could help patch him up when he got back from shopping. He couldn’t leave Dean alone much longer though. Hallucinations were never a good sign, and if something happened to Dean whilst Cas was having a pity party all on his lonesome, Cas would never forgive himself. The man wiped away the dried tears and pressed on.
“You had a seizure, Dean. It’s rare with withdrawal, but you refused to go to hospital. You should have been on watch and medicated. But no one can force Dean Winchester to do anything.”
Okay, Dean thought to himself. Either you can keep pissing him off until he eventually gets tired of your shit and abandons you like fucking everyone else… or you can talk to him. Maybe he can help deal with your stupid little girl emotional shit.
“Just go take a shower, change your clothes, and meet him outside in thirty minutes. It’s okay, Cas”.
A host of questions raced through Dean's mind, and he didn't even know where to begin. Looking around, he finally decided to sit down, on the other side of the couch where Cas was sitting. Cas carefully watched him settle in without a word. After a few moments, Dean found the courage to break the awkward silence.
“Oh no, completely free… But I’m afraid, you’re not really his type… And I’m not talking about hair color, here, if you see what I mean…”
“I told them about April - not about the fact that she was a reaper that had tried to kill me, obviously, but about the fact that I had sex with her. So I know that my body is able to procreate, but…I didn’t really want it, and didn’t really enjoy it. I thought that maybe it was because I wasn’t interested in her, and that’s why my coworkers suggested that I try with other people, that I could meet on this dating app”.
And Dean helped him to put the sweater on. Then, the two men looked into each other’s eyes. For a long time. Like they used to do before. They were really, really close. And then, Dean didn’t know what came over him, but he instinctively took Cas’s hand and led him into the main room. The angel’s eyes widened in surprise as he discovered the decoration.
This time, Dean could not keep quiet and let Cas continue. “Wait, what? No, man,  don’t think that!”
He always thought that “sexual attraction” was a social construction; that when people  said “wow, that person is so hot, I’d like to have sex with them,” they didn’t really mean it, that it was just a thing people said without questioning it, an unspoken social rule. He himself had agreed with friends that “yes, Ryan Gosling is super sexy,” even though he didn’t know why the fact that he was shirtless in one picture changed his level of aesthetic attractiveness. For Castiel, it didn’t make any difference; what mattered was the color of his eyes, his haircut, the harmony of his facial features. Now, he was curious to know whether it was just him, or if other people felt that way, too. He was overall very confused about this asexuality thing: he had always just assumed that everyone thought like him, and suddenly discovering that no, once again, he was different from the others, was kind of scary. So maybe talking to other people about it could help him? But he wasn’t even considering going to one of the Sunday meetings of the society. The idea seemed ridiculous with his anxiety. He could never do that. Maybe he could just go back on social media to read about the experiences of other asexuals. That would be better than nothing, and less stressful for him.
“Cas, I’m sorry”, started Dean, realizing it was the first time he was telling his friend that he was sorry. “I know I will never apologize enough for what I said to you, for what I’ve done to you. You don’t have to forgive me if you can’t, I’d understand. It’s entirely my fault and I don’t deserve you. That’s why I ran yesterday, but instead it only made things worse. I’m sorry Cas, you deserve better, so much better. I know you wanted a Christmas, so… I tried my best to give you one. It won’t be perfect, because everything was closed at 5 am this morning, so I did as I could and… Just come, please…”
Cas frowned. The voice seemed very far, but close at the same time, and it definitely wasn’t Balthazar’s. Was he imagining it?
Cas still seemed uncomfortable, and Dean remembered that he was probably still thinking Dean could get angry at him because of what he was saying.
Thank you for reading! I had a lot of fun working on this project, and I'd like to thank one last time all the people involved in it, especially Aggiedoll, bodyandsoul and TessAlyn for their kindness.
Cas thought he would obsess about that party and the events that happened there a lot before falling asleep, but it turned out that he was actually really exhausted, and he fell asleep almost immediately after lying down in bed.
“Thanks! I knew I was missing something easy, but couldn’t figure out what…Usually, Dean is here to help me with the computer stuff, but he seems to be late today…”
Cas' face was very pale, and his eyes looked empty. He looked like he was in a state of shock. Dean soon understood why when he noticed the bandage on his neck, and the razor left on the floor.
“I… I feel better, now. Though I’ll appreciate some sleep later, but… I guess I’d feel better once the talking’s done. Better rip the bandage off now. I’m ready to face it. Now that you know… Waiting more won’t ease the pain, anyway, so we might as well deal with this now.”
He stood up, and lightly tapped on Dean’s shoulder to make him stand up too. He dragged him a little out of the way so the children wouldn't hear them talking.
It was probably the weirdest love confession Dean ever heard, but after the discussion they just had, he appreciated it.
“I suggest that for our first week, we don’t divide the group but organize activities to get to know everyone during the two hours, by the way,” Dean said, ignoring Cas' comment, but still looking amused by the banter.
Still laughing, Dean joined him in the car, and Cas thought that he really liked Dean’s laugh. He began to smile fondly.
The poster was probably new, otherwise Cas would have noticed it; he walked down this corridor at least three times a week. He read it a few times, still surprised to have been confronted with the “asexuality” word, before continuing to walk to his classroom.
Yet, Cas had been the one to create a profile on the dating app. Cas had been the one swiping right on Tom’s profile. Cas had been the one sending and answering messages. Cas was a grown-up, if he wanted to go on a date with the guy, Dean had no right to forbid him. Especially not by passing off his jealousy as a protective impulse.
“Cas, you there? I think I saw Dean’s car outside, have you seen him?” Balthazar called, walking in from the corridor. He took a few steps into the living room and stopped when he saw them.
“At 7. We are going to order pizzas, so feel free to join us if you’re hungry. There won’t be too many of us – maybe a dozen? And I don’t think we’re going to play too late – maybe until 2 am?”
“Because, you know I love you, and I really like Dean, too, he's a great guy, but... I'm not sure you're both looking for the same things, in a relationship... I mean, I don't know, I don't know him that much, and never asked him, but... Just be careful, Cas, okay?”
That was the frustration that actually led him to agree, when Charlie asked him after one of the weekly KU LGBT+ society meetings, if he wanted to share his experience, because the society was planning to prepare a presentation about the various sexual orientations to raise awareness about them. Of course, he hesitated a little at first, but Charlie assured him that he could speak only to the usual group of students, not to strangers. He didn’t have to be involved in the communication campaign organized by the society.
Dean looked at him, and his eyes were full of something different that Cas never seen in him before. He looked so vulnerable, at that moment, and it completely contrasted with the strong overconfident guy holding the wheel of his collection car five minutes earlier. Dean offered him a weak smile.
Apparently, Cas had been deeply upset by the comments of his coworkers. Dean felt a wave of anger building inside him.
“Until I met someone, a few months ago. I didn’t expect it at all, but it just happened. We met, and this guy was so great that I fell in love with him. The problem is that he is my complete opposite. He’s cool, and relaxed, and easy-going, and beautiful, so beautiful, and nice, and caring, and everyone knows him and likes him, and he likes being surrounded by people, and he’s very good at it, actually! We couldn’t be more different. But, the worst part is that he likes to flirt. I knew he had the reputation of being a womanizer, but I also witnessed it. I saw him making sex jokes, flirting, talking about bringing girls back home… I also learned that he’s bisexual, so I should have been happy; he even told me, one day when he was drunk, that he thought I was “hot.” The thing is, we both want different things. He apparently likes to have casual sex, with no strings attached. But what I’m interested in is a relationship,precisely those strings. And the sex is what I’m not interested in. So…”
“About things people do with their partners, but…I don’t know, as much as I’d love to feel close to you, to hold you in my arms, to watch you sleep, to hold your hand, to watch movies with you, to talk with you for hours… I just can’t picture myself having sex with you.”
“Cas? What are you doing here? Wait… You know Dean?” said someone who was hidden behind Benny. The voice sounded familiar to Cas, but he couldn’t exactly identify who it was.
He buried those thoughts as soon as they appeared, at the beginning of his second year. But they were getting more and more persistent, and it was getting more and more difficult to ignore them. Talking about it, even briefly, with Dean, had helped him greatly. Of course, Dean wasn’t his personal therapist, but he felt more comfortable, more at-ease, safer with him, than with the therapist he was seeing twice a month for his anxiety. And even though Dean could have judged him, thinking that his problems were only “rich kid problems,” because he had no material or financial problems but still managed to worry about things in his life, he didn’t. Or at least, Cas didn’t feel that he did. Dean had looked and sounded understanding, and that had helped Cas to feel more valid, in a way.
“I wanted to ask you… I know it’ll sound silly, but…  What do you think of my clothes? Are they… appropriate for what we’re doing?”
“Good. That’s all I’m asking from you for now. I’m Charlie, by the way, Charlie Bradbury, president of the society.”
During the ride, they mostly organized the next week’s session. For the first “official” session, as they didn’t know the children well yet, they decided that they wouldn’t divide the group, but would stay together and both help with homework, and then organize the “fun” activity. Since the children really liked the pie, Cas suggested that they organize a baking workshop. They could start with that, and then do homework while the pies were in the oven.
Balthazar straightened up in his bed, smirking. “I knew this day would come! Tell everything to your old pal, what’s happening?”
Balthazar closed his book. “Not really, just reading this theater play for one of my classes. Nothing urgent, though. You ok?”
“Yes,” Cas confirmed, “It’s just a scratch. Jack was quite scared and cried a little, but his knee is fine.”
Cas angrily ran a hand through his hair, tugging it a little. He forced himself to straighten up in the chair and closed his eyes. He put his hands flat on the table and pressed his feet on the floor, trying to control the tremor in his legs. His heart was beating fast, very fast, and his thoughts kept spiraling.
