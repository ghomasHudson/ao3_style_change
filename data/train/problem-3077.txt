People were starting to arrive and take their seats. Castiel couldn’t say he even knew most of them. They all seemed to be associates of his father. Castiel didn’t have many friends and the only friends he did have he made through Dean. He hadn’t seen them for months either. Though, he didn’t blame them for staying with Dean.
“Nope! Not happening. Sorry, Cas. You’re stuck with giving me a New Years’ kiss every year for the rest of our lives.” Dean laughed, leaning in to give his husband an over-exaggerated kiss on the cheek.
Dean laughs out loud. His laugh distracting some of their fellow patrons on the tables nearby. Castiel has missed that laugh. The way Dean throws his head back in overwhelmed joy was always one of Castiel’s favourite things about the man. And it still is, Castiel supposes.
But, as always, Castiel had been the voice of logic and reason and he’d replied in an equally soft whisper that it wasn’t stupid or absurd and
Gabriel gave Castiel a reassuring smile and patted his shoulder. “Hang in there, bro.”
It was the most gut-wrenching kiss of Castiel’s life. It was a goodbye.
“Just how much I love you.” Dean hummed.
The priest cleared his throat and it spurred Castiel into action.
Before Castiel could get too far away, Dean swooped in to place another kiss on his lips.
Cas sighs, leaning down and kneeling on the seat, shoving at Dean until he’s in a sitting position, head lolling against the back of the seat, shoulders slumped. Cas slides in next to him, but leaves the door open. The comparatively fresh air of the garage is starting to circulate, clearing some of the bourbon fug from the car.
Dean instinctively lays a protective hand over the phone in his pocket.
It’s that thought that pulls him straight over the edge, coming in streaks up Dean’s belly and chest.
Castiel steps aside and lets Dean pass.
“I mean, no! I’m not…motherfu—ummm, I’m fine! Just fine. Just…bleeding?”
“It’s a mandated safe area, monitored by the life guards,” Cas says.
“For what?” Dean asks sleepily.
Three months of silence and then a message about soup. He lets out a groan of sheer frustration and drops the phone onto the couch to run his hands through his hair. His phone beeps again.
But he does wait. He sits in the Impala in the parking lot, fiddling with his phone and drumming his hands on the steering wheel in time to the radio. Castiel watches him while he pretends to clean the windows by the sunglasses display.
September 18 dawns clear and cool. Castiel isn’t working today, and he feels untethered. The idea of seeing Dean again is sparking something within him, low in his core. He was right to stay here. He was right to wait.
But Dean surprises him, after all. He takes Cas by the hand one evening in the kitchen, not long after his return to the bunker, and holds tight to his fingers and says: “Me too, by the way.”
“Please come home, Cas,” Dean says, his voice soft. “I need you. I can’t take it anymore. Please, please come home.”
“How many times?” Cas asks, voice warm and low.
“I’ve seen you, Dean. I’ve seen you staring at me in mirrors and across the gym. I’ve seen you do it, because I’m always staring at you.” Cas crawls onto the bed, up Dean’s body, dropping his head to kiss up Dean’s neck, wet and warm.
Dean nods, momentarily struck dumb.
Dean doesn't message again that night, even though Castiel lies awake in the dark, waiting for the buzz and the chime from his phone that will doesn't come.
“Dean, I—”
And Cas.
“What?! You’re always over at the tent city, hanging out. You sleep over there!”
Dean looks away again, casts his eyes down and bumps his fist on the roof of the car.
Cas smiles, tips Dean’s chin up, and drops a soft kiss to his mouth.
— without the roar of grace and the power of heaven thrumming in the background, he can feel it now. He can feel it like a knife to his chest. It tingles down into his fingers, makes the hairs on his arms stand up, echoes down into his very toes with the force of it. He raises a hand to his chest, places it over his heart. It beats, steadily and quickly, against his palm.
“Soon,” he says again. He twists his fingers, seeking out Dean’s prostate like a homing device, pressing firmly over and over. Dean keens, his cock starting to grow hard again. He tries to curl onto his side, needing to do something, anything, in the face of overstimulation. Cas brings his free hand up to Dean’s hip and pulls him flat against the mattress again, pinning him in place.
In the dark at night, he repeats it over and over to himself, clinging onto the words, his breath catching in his throat.
He hears more from Dean over the next couple of weeks, like some small crack has appeared in the dam and a faint trickle of water is making its way down to quench parched earth.
it to you.” He grins a bit, and Dean doesn’t even try and fight a smile in return, because that wasn’t even a good joke, god damn it, but he is pretty gone here.
: : : : :
“You got brothers and sisters, Cas?” Dean asks.
The second-hand store has the same smell as those in America, and Dean picks through the racks of clothing until he finds a couple of pairs of cargo shorts and a handful of inoffensive t-shirts. Cas comes out of the change room wearing board shorts printed with pink flamingos and a white t-shirt that says “Crikey!” and has a picture of Steve Irwin, Crocodile Hunter on it. Something glitches in Dean’s brain, but he just pats Cas on the shoulder and tells him: “Great choice, buddy.”
“Was that okay?” he asks.
It’s not easy—it takes planning, and pain, and luck, and daring. But when the deed is done, and Dean tears back out of the fabric of nothingness with Cas’s human body in his arms, it’s worth it. It’s always been worth it. When Cas lies prone on the floor of the library where they landed, his fingers clutching in Dean’s shirt tails and sobs wracking his body, he feels Dean holds him close, steeling his spine against the darkness they’d just escaped.
Cas smiles, reaches over the table and lays his hand over Dean’s. Dean immediately wants to turn his hand over and lace their fingers together. Cas’s hand is big and warm and solid.
And it goes okay. The conversation is light, but not stilted, and Cas is charming and funny and awkward as hell. At one point Dean thinks he actually catches him chewing on the side of a fingernail.
“What did you do?”
Jesus
“Doesn’t matter,” Dean says, even though knowing he has memories of
“Can I help you fix it?” he asks.
Back at the gym, it’s still the same as always. They watch out for each other, make small talk, work out side by side. Cas pushes Dean not to skip working his core, and Dean slaps Cas on the ass as he walks by him to refill his water bottle at the fountain. It’s a give and take. If they race home afterwards to shower together, trading shy smiles and laughs and blowjobs under the water’s spray, then that’s great, too.
The curse is hideous: a red, scaly thing, all skittering legs and sharp hooks.
“You shouldn’t sleep out here,” Cas says.
When Dean takes them both in his hand, the hot press of flesh against firm flesh, Castiel could weep with the holiness of it. Instead he cries out, calling Dean’s name into the emptiness of the room. Dean quiets him with a kiss, with a whisper: “It’s okay, Cas, I’m here, I’ve got you, I’m here.” When he comes, it’s with Dean’s lips sucking kisses against his throat, with one of his hands tucked up the front of Dean’s shirt, his hand resting firmly over the rapid beating of Dean’s heart.
“A week. Maybe more,” Cas says.
Part of him wants to call Charlie over so that he doesn’t have to deal with this alone. But what does he expect? Is he waiting for her to hold his hand as he takes wobbly, baby-bird steps towards talking to another human being? Dean tries to make his face resolute, pulls open the front door, and steps out to smoothly intercept Cas.
Cas nods, something subdued in his eyes.
“Are you going to tell me what happened now?” he asks.
“Don’t want…sex with hot men?” Charlie asks, stopping and staring at him innocently.
“I’m sorry it took me so long,’ he says.
, Dean. You need to get laid. Now give me your phone, I’m gonna install Grinder.”
“Do you want a spotter?” he repeats, patiently. “I’ve seen you working out alone, and I thought, if you’re gonna lift big, maybe you could use a spotter.”
Dean remembers the beach he saw yesterday, the purity of the sand, the blue of the water. He doesn’t think it can get better than that. But Cas took him here. Cas wants to show him.
They apply sunscreen then head up and over the cliffs again, Dean grumbling slightly less this time. He’s hot and sweaty by the time they reach the start of the sands, and he’s actually kind of tempted to get in the water and see if it’s as refreshing as it looks. They find a place near the treeline to stow their things, and then Cas is off, leaving his clothes in a messy puddle.
“And then I’ll fuck your brains out,” Cas whispers before biting Dean’s lower lip and sucking it into his mouth.
He remembers this.
Dean’s hands drop down to the outside of Cas’s thighs, fingers digging into the muscle for leverage as he rocks his hips, desperate for more, more of Cas inside him, as much as he can get. Cas knows, because Dean has told him before. Not with words, exactly. But he’s heard it in Dean’s heightened moans when Cas fucks him deep and hard, the sigh he makes when Cas is seated fully, finally inside him. The way he parts his thighs, sweet and soft, to make more room for Cas, to get him closer, to let him in as far as he can go.
“The ocean?” Dean asks, like it’s not obvious.
Cas smiles at him indulgently. “I’m not done with you yet,” he growls.
“Fine, he’s fine,” Dean says with a smile of relief. “God, can I come in?”
The beach is pure and clean, with no rocks, no shells, no jellyfish. Just the quiet clear waves and a relatively high tide. It’s not busy, either: there are a couple of other hikers up ahead, but it’s otherwise empty. Dean keeps his feet out of the water, staying on the firmly packed sand left by the receding tide. He chats with Cas, softly, idly, as they cover the half-mile of sand, one foot after the other until--
Afterwards, Dean’s in the kitchen, rinsing the coffee mugs, hands pruning in the dishwater. Castiel steps across the kitchen, shoes treading softly, coming to stop by Dean’s side. Dean leans in to him, slightly. Cas clears his throat. Tries to speak. Clears his throat again. “I’m glad you’re back,” he says, honest, even though he knows that can’t begin to describe it. Dean leans into him a little more heavily. He pulls one wet hand from the sink and lightly, slowly, brushes it against Cas’s sleeve, fingers touching slightly before curling, gripping above Cas’s elbow.
Dean’s thighs clamp hard around Cas’s head, and he can feel Dean contort above him, stomach clenching and back curving and he curls up off the pillows with the force of his orgasm. Dean spills over his tongue, hot and bitter, his dick pulsing. Cas swallows it, savouring the feeling of Dean’s pleasure spurting hot and thick in his mouth. God, he loves it—he loves to make Dean lose control like this. He eases Dean’s legs down to rest softly on the sheets, and regards Dean hungrily.
. Dean tells him to yuck it up but is secretly pleased, cheeks burning a little.
“Well,” he says, kissing Cas softly. “We’d better make the most of it.”
“Hey, how did you know my name?” he asks, remembering that he and Cas have never actually introduced themselves to one another.
Cas regards him with mirth. “No, Dean. It is not.”
Dean nods.
“Australia,” Cas says.
And Dean does, with a strangled shout that’s ripped from his throat. His whole body tenses, each muscle screaming as his orgasm courses through him for the third time that night.
He doesn’t reply to Dean’s message. Instead, he goes outside and downstairs and down the street, around the corner to the liquor store next door to the Gas ‘n Sip. He buys a cheap bottle of whiskey, the brand that he used to find stowed under the front seat of the Impala sometimes, in earlier days before Dean settled. He takes the bottle home, sits on the awful couch, and twists the lid off it.
Dean tenses. “He’s fine.”
Just as he lets the door drop shut, a small hand reaches out to stop it from closing.
It’s a Saturday afternoon, nothing overwhelming, not a big deal, just coffee. He and Cas had exchanged phone numbers, but beyond confirming the time and location for this afternoon, they haven’t really been in touch the last few days. Dean might have been so worked up that he skipped his Wednesday and Friday gym sessions so that he could have some time to get his head on straight. If Cas had noticed—
“I’m taking you to dinner,” Dean says as he fiddles with the packets of nuts hanging by the checkout. The sleeves of his grey henley are pushed up to his elbows. His eyes are evasive.
, he thinks. “Who’s that new guy I saw a little while ago? Blue shirt, good beard?”
He gets up, hunting for the motel keys. He finds them thrown carelessly on the floor by the front door. The tag tells him that he’s at a Motel 6 in Wichita. He didn’t drive far.
He’s lonely. He’d felt loneliness before, when he’d been called away to heaven, or, worst, when he’d been forced to keep secrets from Dean. But he’d always had a greater purpose then, he’d always been chasing something, planning something, twisting the fabric of the world to make something important happen.
The fog shifts from Dean’s head a little. He looks down, relieved to see he’s still wearing pants.
Cas pulls off with a pop. His hand resumes stroking behind Dean’s balls, before slipping back further to trace around the tight, hot skin at the core of him.
On nights with Dean in their shared bed, caught up in each other’s arms, finally able to peacefully rest. Or intertwined together in the sheets, open-mouthed and panting, breathing each other’s warm breath as it’s sighed into the dark.
Cas stares at Dean’s hand. It feels warm and real through the denim of his jeans.
It’s even easier, after a steak dinner at the local surf club, after four or five of those locally brewed tropical ales--because
. I’m
And Dean, helpless, does.
, Cas, please…” Dean is babbling now, rubbing the back of one hand over his eyes, the other clutching the pillow under his head in a death grip.
When Dean turns up a week later, it’s like he reaches in and pulls the plug.
“Hey,” he says, reaching for Cas’s leg, resting his hand against Cas’s thigh. “Hey, are you okay here?”
“What was that thing?” Dean asks.
“Nah, he’s working on something back at the bunker.”
Cas is there in a second, lifting the bar easily and resting it back in the rack, apologising all the while. “Shit, Dean, sorry, that was just the worst timing. I’m so sorry.”
“No, not asleep out.
“Do I what?” he manages, realising that he’s staring probably a little too long at the fine sheen of sweat on Power Thighs’s throat.
“You should try it,” Cas says. “The water will be warm. And it’s perfectly safe.”
It’s mid-September when Castiel checks his phone on his break at work.
“Nah,” says Dean. “He lives in California with his lovely wife. He can be annoying as hell, but I really miss him sometimes. Most of the time.”
Castiel receives a message early in the morning. He wakes up to it flashing on his phone.
Dean wrings his hands together.
Cas kisses his cheek, his neck.
“Everything okay?” Cas asks as a gull wheels overhead.
Cas does come back the next day, and Dean somehow remembers to breathe when he steps into the door, blue hoodie looking warm and rumpled. He smiles as he approaches the counter. Dean can practically feel Charlie vibrating with excitement beside him.
“Another time, then,” he says. He opens the car door and slides into the seat. The look he gives Castiel just before he drives away is inscrutable — not because Castiel can’t parse it, but because the weight of it is too much to bear.
Castiel doesn't know what to do with this message. He doesn't know how to tamp down the great well of sadness that's bursting forth within him. Dean's drunk, he's not thinking clearly, he doesn't want...He can't want...
Castiel looks down at his human hands.
“You got a friend out there,” Nancy says, and it’s not a question.
Cas lays a hand on his shoulder, warm and heavy.
Dean sits heavily on the side of the bed again. He doesn’t know how he got here. He doesn’t know why he left, but he has a pretty good idea. He stares down at his phone, the message box with its unread notifications. Messages from Cas.
When he was still an angel, he’d seen this act performed hundreds of times—thousands even—as he watched over humanity. He’d never seen the appeal in it, never understood how it could bring so much pleasure to the person performing it, until he tried it for the first time. And now, with the weight of Dean’s cock against his tongue and the roof of his mouth, the salty-bitter taste of precome as it leaks against the back of his tongue, the way Dean moans and shifts against the sheets, kicking a knee out to spread his thighs: it all coalesces into something heady and artful, and Cas feels pleasure thrumming through his own veins as he sucks Dean down deeper.
Dean’s head whips up. “Huh?”
“Dean, I — I’m nothing without my grace, do you understand? I’m weak, I’m
Dean’s not going to get excited about the prospect of dolphins. He’s a forty-year-old man, for crying out loud.
They’re standing on a small, empty road, the hot asphalt sprinkled with white sand. Squat timber houses line the street, and he looks at the small, white cottage in front of them, with its wide casement windows and corrugated tin roof.
At Cas’s questioning look, he makes himself clearer: “I love you, too.”
Cas’s fingers continue running softly through Dean’s hair, trailing over the skin behind his ear, sliding softly over the gentle give of his neck.
He looks down at his body: red flannel, black t-shirt. His duffel is next to his bed. A shotgun is laid out on the small spindly-legged table across the room. He can see ammunition, equipment for salt rounds.
Dean’s cheeks flush pink, and he drops his eyes. “God, you’re really outdoing my declaration here, Cas,” he says, although his voice is warm.
The sand is soft beneath his feet. Actually, he realises quickly, the sand is really fucking hot. Hissing, he hops along the beach to a shady spot under a weathered little tree near the dunes, sitting down where it’s thankfully cooler. Cas takes a seat on the sand next to him.
Dean looks wrecked already, his lips red and wet, colour breaking out across his cheeks. His breath is coming fast, just from this, just from the anticipation. Cas considers him for a moment.
“And I love you,” he says, fingers lingering against Dean’s throat.
They talk little during the meal. Castiel scrapes around in his mind for something to talk about, but comes up empty-handed. He doesn’t have anything to share — no adventures, no mishaps, no grand schemes to save the world. His life has become so small.
“Oh,” says Cas, “you mean you’re—”
. Frustration gathers, fuzzy, at the back of his head.
“I know,” he interrupts. “It’s gone.”
“Hey,” Dean says. “Got any new faces?”
“Gadreel,” Dean says. “But I didn’t know who it was, he told me he was Ezekiel, I...God, I was just desperate for an answer. I prayed and he came and I...I had my brother back. I couldn’t lose Sammy again.”
“For real?”
Cas nods.
“Move over,” Cas says, reaching down to nudge Dean’s shoulder. He doesn’t want to move. Moving seems too hard right now.
He doesn’t wait for an answer. He reaches down and grasps Dean’s cock in his hand, jerking him fast and ruthless.
Castiel hums in agreement, voice already threaded through with sleep.
Dean shrugs, but he’s worried. His chest hurts, he swears he can feel the edges of a burn in the back of his oesophagus. Heartburn, maybe.
“We don’t know,” Sam says. “She was dead before she hit the ground, but not before whatever she threw at you got its hooks in.”
“He’s not with you?”
“Can’t,” Dean sobs, chest heaving. “Cas, Cas, I can’t, I—”
One night in Dean's arms won't undo the hurt and the pain of his human existence so far, but he can feel the claws he'd sunk into his life start to retract a little, easing their hold, dulling the sting. With time, he imagines, it will fade completely. It's a remarkable human trait — the ability to forgive, to forget, to grow and change and proceed in togetherness, despit the pain of the past.
“Okay,” he says, disarmed.
Pushing open the front door, he apologises to his regulars for the delay, smiling as they shuffle inside. Before he lets the door swing shut again, he looks over to the tent city over the road in the park under a bridge. Well, it’s not really a city, maybe there are only five or six tents, but there are at least a dozen rough sleepers Dean’s seen at any one time when he’s packing up at night. He sees them come and go, but knows a couple of their names, because they’ve been there as a group for a while, and he likes to know his neighbours. He often heads over with sandwiches and coffee and the end of the day rather than throwing leftover food away.
His message tone goes the next morning instead, rousing him, fuzzy-headed and still mostly asleep.
“A latte, please,” says Cas, reaching into his back pocket for his wallet.
He’s got a name at least.
Dean looks over at where Cas is seated in a leather-backed chair, shirt sleeves rolled up, tie abandoned. He looks tired, even though he’s back to not sleeping again. He looks like he’s been reading all night. Cas is staring at Dean with concern and appraisal. His eyes are sad when he speaks.
“I know,” says Dean. “I know, Cas. But I was desperate. And now it’s done.”
? Something is taking time from him, and he’s scared. He knows; he’s running.
Cas is back the next morning, and Dean’s kind of surprised. He knocks on the door before pushing it open and walking into the shop, kind of making a big deal of stepping carefully up and over the threshold.
“Are you going to come like this?” he murmurs in Dean’s ear, running his fingertips over the hot skin of Dean’s erection.
Between days working at the Gas ‘n Sip, and nights alone in his new home, nose tucked into a book, reading for hours under the light of the main room’s single, bare bulb, he feels the pain to his loss start to ebb away. Dean came, ultimately not to take him home, but to see him. To check that he was doing okay. To touch base with a friend, an equal, and make sure that he was alive and well.
Dean nods, sort of gapes.
Cas shrugs and stands. “Suit yourself,” he says, before kicking off his shoes and stripping off his t-shirt, which he drops it in an undignified heap on Dean’s face. He strides out towards the water, and Dean watches him as he goes, staring agog at the rippling muscles of Cas’s broad back. How long has he been hiding that under all those layers? Dean shakes his head and pulls his jaw back up off the ground, then lies back on the sand and closes his eyes.
“Okay.”
“Please,” says Cas. “Again. And then I’ll make you breakfast.”
Castiel doesn’t close his eyes when Dean kisses him. He watches the gentle flutter of Dean’s eyelashes, looks at the soft lines at the corner of Dean’s eyes, the gentle arch of his brow. Dean’s mouth is soft and warm and chaste, his kiss so sweet that Castiel could cry.
“Because,” Dean says, picking at the seam of his jeans. “Because I fucked up. Cas, I fucked up.”
“It’s complicated,” he says. “I want you there, but there are some things I’ve gotta fix first.”
He’s scared.
—unfortunate shade of red. “This is probably the most embarrassing thing that’s every happened to me.”
“What did you wanna know?” asks Manny.
Dean definitely does not feel the tips of his ears glow red-hot. He is cool as a cucumber. In fact, that is his middle name. Dean Cucumber Winchester.
Dean kicks the motel door shut behind him as he steps into the shabby room, his arms laden with plastic bags of snack food--whatever had been available at the poorly stocked gas station down the block--and a couple of six-packs of shitty beer.
, Dean thinks,
Dean takes two steps onto the sand and then stops. Cas stops next to him, instinctively matching his movements.
“No, man, really. It’s fine. My shop,” he gestures at the traitorous café door behind him. “We’ve got…plasters. You know. Neosporin. I’ll. Yeah.”
“…Right,” Dean says, trying to adjust, to remember. Failing. “Where the fuck are we, Sammy?”
And just like that, it opens: the box that he’d pushed shut, then sat on, then jumped on until it closed firmly, then hammered secure with nails of repression and lack of self-worth, then chained fast and dropped into a bottomless ocean hoping to never see it again.
Dinner, it turns out, is mountains of giant shrimp (“king prawns”, the menu says), potato salad and pale ale at a small restaurant overlooking the water. It’s casual and friendly and unhurried, and Dean feels himself relax further into the wicker chair as the evening carries on.
Dean closes his eyes, presses his head back into the pillows.
Outside, the wind howls.
“Nope. No, it’s…it’s cool.” Dean just wants to be unconscious again, wants to be anywhere but here, trapped in the dark of the Impala’s back seat, what was so comforting before now smothering him. He needs fresh air. He needs to breathe. He feels suddenly awake, nauseous.
: : : : :
Dean sits up on his elbows, more alert now.
“What happened?” he asks instead.
Dean’s hips twitch at the touch, and he moans softly.
: : : : :
up like that. He tries so hard not to lean in. He blinks against the warmth he sees in Cas’s eyes. He blinks.
Cas smiles into Dean’s skin. He’s so lucky, he knows, to have found this. That despite everything, he has this wonderful man in his arms. Dean deserves nothing but joy and happiness and pleasure and love. And that, Cas is certain, is something he intends to deliver—for the rest of their lives.
“I’m sorry, Dean,” he says.
“Wyoming?” Dean has a feeling he’s coming across as insane.
“Hey, Cas,” he says, giving a little wave.
Castiel hums. He can picture it: the bunker’s warm light, the gentle hum of the generators, the arch of the ceilings, and Sam hunched over a book in the library learning everything his delightful brain can absorb. It’s a wonderful image.
Dean shrugs. “I’m okay. What did I get hit with?”
Dean’s not sure why things aren’t smooth and simple. He’s Dean Winchester, he’s the king of smooth dates. He knows how to flirt, and flutter his eyelashes, and get girls and guys from casual mid-week drink to casual mid-week fuck with very little effort. But for some reason, with Cas, he just can’t. He can feel a nervous flush starting to creep up the back of his neck.
Dean’s silent for a moment, his thumb rubbing over the tattoo on Castiel’s ribs.
On the bed, Cas’s knees dig into the mattress as he wraps his arm around Dean’s waist, holds him close and reaches down to trail his hand over Dean’s cock.
“Okay, then,” says Cas. “See you tomorrow, Dean.” He smiles and pulls the door open and walks back out onto the street. Dean’s not quite sure what happened. Is this a date? Is Cas coming back for a date?
Still smiling at him with those deep, blue eyes, Cas says, “Even if you’re afraid of the ocean.”
It turns out that, aside from being a beast at the gym, Cas is also a beast at giving head. He goes to town on Dean’s cock, kissing up the length of him, sliding his lips over and down to the root, sucking hard and applying the pressure of his tongue in all the best ways, before popping off wetly and kissing down to suck Dean’s balls into his mouth, one at a time.
“Dean, I can pay for a coffee, it’s more than fine,” Cas says, looking a bit confused. Adorably.
“No,” says Dean, sharp and sure. “You can’t.”
Dean reaches for the button on Cas’s jeans, slipping it free from the fastening. Dean’s hands are hot and insistent as he presses his fingers against Cas’s cock, squeezing him through the denim. He’s already hard enough that his pants are becoming uncomfortable.
He considers for a moment; he remembers his plan.
“You’ve been watching me,” Cas says.
Castiel doesn’t see Dean again for three months.
He can feel the magic burning inside him, like a hot, red stone. It feels like heartburn, like heartache, and he struggles to breathe. Sam drops to one knee at Dean’s side.
Dean lays back on the bench, his towel rough under the back of his head. “Dean,” he offers, bringing his hands up to grip around the bar.
, and I’m perfectly fulfilled. I don’t need—” His eye catches movement over the road among the tents. It’s the new guy, shaking out his bedroll and securing himself a space near one of the bridge pylons. Dean watches as the man laughs at something an older woman is saying. He feels something pang inside him at the man’s easy smile, teeth white among his stubbled face.
“It’s called a long black here, anyway,” Cas continues. “They take their coffee quite seriously.”
He can’t let Dean in here. His grip on his existence here is tenuous at best, and the last thing he needs is Dean Winchester kicking open the door and tearing it all apart.
Cas dutifully shuffles over and Dean settles down in front of the radiator, which is silent and still and cold as a corpse. The chill from the wind and snow outside is definitely seeping under the door and the cracks in the windows. Dean feels a sense of defeat settle over his shoulders.
. What if it can’t be
They kiss softly, but not chastely; Cas is almost painfully tender. Dean pulls him in tighter, presses their bodies together from chest to hips, lets his hand slide further to run up the broad planes of Cas’s back. He opens his mouth, kisses Cas deeper, feels Cas’s own hands press uncertainly against his chest, carefully pushing him onto his back as Cas leans over him. The burning in his chest is subsiding.
He gives Dean’s cock a few strokes, and Dean hisses above him. Cas stops, looks at Dean’s face.
He’s woken up by Cas looming over him, dripping fat drops of salt water over his face, and realises he must have drifted asleep, lulled by the soothing susurration of the waves and the warmth of the afternoon.
He knows, now.
He cracks. Of course he does. “Man,” he says, reaching a hand up and rubbing the back of his neck, before remembering his grey-shirt-sweat-stain situation and lowering his arm again. “I don’t know what’s gotten into me. I think you intimidate the shit out of me.”
“Come on, man,” Dean starts to complain, spooning butter into the pan heating on the stovetop. “Really?”
Their love blossoms easily, quickly, now that they allow it to. Hands linger, mouths open, and bodies come together in a congress so pure and bright and
Castiel opens the box. Sweet, tangy, rich aromas float up out of the box. The pie has a delicate lattice of pastry over a dark red filling. He can’t stop staring at it.
Dean doesn’t really know what to say. Thankfully, Baby is parked on the verge nearby, snow already melting off her and sliding onto the sandy gravel in chunks, so he doesn’t have to get mad at Cas for leaving her behind. But still, t his wasn’t what he expected, precisely. “Uhhh, why?”
On Thursday morning, Dean’s restocking the beans when Charlie comes in to start her shift.
“Fucking ‘mazing,” Dean mumbles. “Tired. But good. You’re so good.”
“Nah, ‘sall good. I got it,” he replies, balancing two armloads of food and trying to navigate his way to the front door. Charlie sighs at his stubbornness and runs over to open the door for him. She waves him through with a little bow.
“No, of course I want that,” Dean scoffs. “We all want that—present company excluded,” he adds at the disgusted twist to Charlie’s mouth. “But not like that. I don’t want a hook-up app, Charlie. I don’t even really think I want a hook-up.”
“Right,” Cas says.
“Yeah, wherever, man. I’ll be right over,” he says.
Hot guy’s shirt is sticking to his back with sweat, but in that rumpled, slightly damp, sexy way. Not like Dean’s shirt, which is starting to smell a bit off, and definitely has sweat patches around the collar and armpits. He brings his head down to sniff surreptitiously at his armpit at the apex of his next twist. Yep, he definitely smells.
There’s so much Castiel wants to say and yet he can’t find where to start.
Just as Castiel’s father reached the car and was about to open the passenger door, Dean turned the ignition and they peeled off down the street towards the highway.
He had followed his secret dream of becoming a firefighter once Castiel had managed to needle it out of him (perceptive bastard). To start with, most calls had been pretty average with the occasional major job thrown in.
He reluctantly handed her over to the children’s services lady, his finger feeling cold without the warm, tiny touch of the baby’s hand wrapped around it.
He wasn’t usually one to be overly sentimental (he left that to his brother Sammy) but looking at his husband in the dim light of their living room, Dean couldn’t help but be grateful to whoever looked down on them that he got another year with the man.
And Dean wouldn’t have it any other way.
He blinked back to reality when he realised the priest had stopped talking and was looking past Castiel and frowning.
Fireworks brought Dean out of his wistful musings. Emma stirred a little in his arms and he realised what the fireworks meant; it was midnight! The new year had begun.
Castiel can’t help but huff a laugh at that. “Thanks for that, Anna. That really helped to calm my nerves.”
But this particular fairy-tale didn’t have a happy ending.
Castiel traces the condensation on his glass. He’s barely touched the beer since the barman set it down in front of him. To say he’s second guessing his decision to do this would be an understatement.
Benny has moved away too. Castiel can see him in the corner of his eye pretending to clean glasses while watching the exchange between Dean and Castiel.
Dean sighed wearily. “I’m saying either tell your family to go fuck themselves, and come be with me and Sam. Or you stay with them and we end this.”
“Never,” Castiel shook his head. “I’m glad you crashed the wedding.”
Walking through the house to the bottom of the stairs, Dean holds Emma firmly but lovingly in his arms.
, that Dean could keep her himself. Dean couldn’t even look his new husband in the eye, knowing how stupid the idea was.
Castiel levelled Dean with an arched eyebrow, which Dean knew all too well meant
Dean smiled and brought Castiel’s hand to his lips, not taking his eyes off the road in front of them. “Good.”
It worked for them for two years. Until now.
Castiel scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Okay, Mr Sentimental, I think it’s time for bed for you too.”
Nerves come flooding back and Castiel finds himself frozen facing Benny.
Castiel lets himself take in the appearance of the man in front of him. The man he never thought he’d see again.
Castiel sighs and finally takes a sip of his beer. “Yes, I suppose I’m just nervous.”
The sticky heat on his skin reminded him of last summer with Dean. He’d managed to convince his parents to go to their summer home without him. He’d had three whole months of summer without his parents and spent all that time with Dean.
“Hello, Anna. I am on the date. I’m currently in the bathroom after having what was probably a panic attack.” Castiel replies calmly, trying to keep his breathing steady.
He hadn’t wanted to get married in the height of summer, but time had clearly been of the essence. The deal Castiel’s father made with Daphne’s family would only be complete once the wedding was over so Castiel’s father was eager to rush through the marriage. The wedding was set for a Saturday in late July – only two months after the initial engagement.
“So, Cas,” Dean finally speaks once the waiter leaves, “did you sign yourself up for this,” he gestures around at the artificial bar and restaurant set for the show, “or did you get dragged into it by a friend like me?”
“What happened? Is the guy an asshole? Do you need me to come get you? I don’t care if it’s for some TV show, I’ll come right down there and –“
Benny passes over another beer, placing it on the counter in front of Castiel.
Dean was ready with a retort about how being a little romantic wasn’t because he was tired, but a yawn fought its way up through his throat instead, rendering his point useless.
But this call had been the worst Dean had ever attended.
Dean reached out a careful hand, making sure not to jostle Emma in her slumber, to grab her Frozen blanket from her lap and wrap it around her shoulders.
Dean seems to snap out of his own shock and replies with an equally as soft, “hey, Cas.”
Living a miserably single life had finally got old for Castiel. After a few failed dates, he’d decided he had nothing to lose by signing up to the
Sweat once again dripped down Castiel’s back. He was sure he might just pass out from the sheer exhaustion of the heat and the thoughts rushing through his head. He hadn’t been right ever since Dean left.
“No, Anna, it’s not that.” Castiel interrupts. “It’s- well, it’s-“ he feels tears start to build in his eyes. “It’s Dean.” He chokes, letting the sobs break through his body.
“Cas?” Comes the equally as breathless response.
Castiel could feel eyes start to turn back to him. No one knew of him and Dean but Castiel’s demeanour must have clued them in that Dean was there for him.
But Dean rescues him by breaking the tension with a soft smile.
The movement was tracked by Dean whose face went from one of determined nonchalance to one with a slight flicker of hope. It was a change that onlookers might not have noticed. But Castiel did. He knew Dean better than anyone.
It wasn’t long before roommates turned into a relationship.
Castiel muted the words. Again, he hadn’t been involved much in the content of the ceremony. It all felt fake. Like if God was really looking down on them now, he’d curse Castiel for making a mockery of marriage.
Castiel knew then that he wasn’t imagining the sound. The Impala could be heard roaring in the distance. And it was getting closer.
“Cas, I’m sorry. At least you know now, you won’t have to wonder what could have been anymore. You can move on.”
And the breath leaves his body.
Castiel had panicked for a minute before Gabriel just laughed and held out a hand to Dean who had shaken it awkwardly, painfully aware of his near nakedness. After a little teasing and promising not to tell anyone, Gabriel had eventually left them alone.
Castiel smiled nervously in response. He couldn’t muster the energy for anything else lest he break down and cry right in front of everyone.
Castiel feels brave and turns to face Dean. He looks into the eyes of the man he was once sure he’d spend the rest of his life with, and he asks himself the question.
She was another addition to his life that he’d never seen coming.
“Come on, Cas,” Dean implored, “this is crazy. There’s no way you’re gonna marry this girl. I don’t care how much money her family has.”
Castiel looked at Dean and knew he was trying to hide his nerves. He reached over to grasp Dean’s hand. Castiel had let go of Dean once before. He was never going to do it again.
“Love you too, Anna. Thank you.”
“For fuck’s sake, Cas. I’m not saying you gotta out yourself or tell them about us. I know how dangerous that could be for you.” Dean sighed. “Just stick up for yourself and tell them you want to live your own goddamn life!”
"He talked about going to a beach. A complete package, like, with toes in the sand, sunbathing, Hawaiian shirts, cute umbrella drinks. And it was supposed to be all three of us. You weren't even staying with us all the time back then, but you were, like, an inseparable part of this image. Dean doesn't have many inseparable parts in his system. I don't know what is going on between you two, but, um. It's good."
"Right."
"Hmm, as for me, I’m good. Thanks, Sam."
The younger Winchester raises his eyebrows.
"I, uh-- I was looking for you both to ask if you needed anything that I could grab. Eileen and I are planning to hit some kind of fair tomorrow." His lips twitch upwards when he looks over at Dean once more.
The fire is nothing more than old embers inside Dean's lungs. Everything feels a little bit like he’s been drugged. He thinks it's okay, he thinks that's probably how you're supposed to feel getting basic human treatment for the first time after forty-two years of abuse – he’s clear-headed enough to use the right term. Certain things are re-evaluated when you outlive the authorial intention, or when your best buddy proves all your self-worth bullshit wrong with a minute-long speech.
"That's because we're both sort of walking on eggshells around it. It's complicated as much as…very new and confusing."
Castiel hums. "We can call it a night if you want. Sam will be out of town tomorrow, we could continue watching after he leaves."
"That state of 'emotional constipation', as you've kindly put it, is very much familiar to Dean. This relative balance we've established, which doesn't actively alienate his or my past issues?" Castiel looks up. "I really don't want him to start focusing on the…foreignness of it. Bringing up his moments of vulnerability might just do that, though."
"Um, you know how we both were since-- Chuck and my return, basically. There was stuff that went down with some really bad timing, among other things."
"Jeez, she's almost my age when, uh, the whole demonic gang started acting up. Kids sure grow up fast when they're not your own." The last phrase is muted by another yawn, and Dean leans on him slightly heavier, strands of his hair tickling Castiel's jawline.
"Did you want anything?"
There's this rawness that is not the usual way things go with them both being back from the dead, having shoved yet another apocalypse down God's throat. There used to be a lot of snapping, a lot of pushing. Constant frantic anchoring to each other's bad attitudes, as if attempting to ground themselves with bloodshot looks, split lips and words like red flags to a bull.
"Uh, twenty…four?"
Cas purses his lips in a tight line.
"Now you're making me sound like a distressed teenager. I think you are particularly biased, anyway."
"Hey, and Cas? I'm really glad you and Dean have this right now. Whatever it is. You both seem much more, uh, stable now. And I know that we've kinda gained our freedom, so this stability covers pretty much all aspects of life, but…do you know how he described his ideal future before everything went down with Michael?"
He sits, stretching up and forward, and once again Cas has this urge to draw parallels between Dean and animals which humans usually deem cute. Dean looks like a ruffled bird right now, squinting at his surroundings and scratching his forearms, his collar sticking out, hair dishevelled. Bird-like sleepy eyes fall on his.
"I might be." He can't help a barely-there smile tugging at his lips, because, well, his confession isn't acknowledged in words too often – in actions and by general tone shift, maybe, but not in words – and every time it gets brought up in a non-life-threatening context some bubbly emotion surges through his gut. It feels great for things to just be…out there. And fine, at that.
The bullshit doesn't go away. There's just suddenly no point in proclaiming it.
Their kid is God now, so Dean breathes, and cuts the crap, and stares back. He sees Cas's gaze softening, and it's like ice cracking in spring under the warmth of Dean's proximity. Dean stands closer, touches him like it's okay, and the ice is mostly water now. It's so much easier to haul something heavy through the water. He doesn't even want to drown in it. Maybe they'll be good.
"We haven't been out in a long time either, y'know." Dean's voice sounds raspy and slow.
"You mind if I?" He doesn't finish the sentence, just drops his gaze down. Cas moves his hands up almost automatically, so when Dean props his head upon Castiel's lap, facing the TV and shuffling a little, he actually finds himself at a loss of anything to say or do.
"You… do your thing."
"Yeah, that stuff you both never bothered to tell me about." Sam speaks without irritation, just stating the fact. Castiel looks at him.
"Adding to the Dirt on Dean Winchester collection. Man, he does look kinda adorable when he, you know, sets foot outside his emotional denial-slash-constipation zone." He points the camera at Dean, and Castiel feels something inside him – maybe, all of him – freeze and churn. It's not like Dean is twelve instead of forty-two and can't survive some brotherly teasing without overthinking. But he does, sometimes, overthink.
"This will not exactly let your culinary abilities off the hook, but it's Claire's birthday in a few days. We should drop by Jody's anyway." Dean's head raises at that, and Cas looks back at him.
Castiel will take all of it, any of it. As long as this moment stays his.
This time the air still seems full of static electricity. But it doesn't bite, because, you see, no one is trying to bite back – or it still does, yet something has made them stop setting the whole thing on fire from the slightest tingling.
"What are you doing?" asks Castiel when Sam pulls his phone out, smirking.
"I was there when he got a text from Eileen, I suppose they're meeting up." Cas shifts and throws his head back a little, getting more comfortable. This numbing tiredness feels strange – too human – sometimes, but it surely beats the exhaustion of the last decade.
“We don’t ever have to stop,” Dean says. The table creaks again, louder this time. Dean taps Castiel on the hip, urging him down and off the table.
The burning in his chest is back, hot like a knife along the line of his sternum.
Castiel breathes out, a shaky exhale from the very foundation of his lungs. He hadn’t realised he’d been holding his breath.
. Or when Dean rode him, slow and loving, head tipped back as he lost himself in pleasure, and Cas said:
“Bagels, cream cheese, chicken salad, and raspberry muffins,” he says, counting them off as he passes them to Manny.
At the top of the cliff is a large split in the rock. Ocean waves crash with remarkable force down the channel created by the eroded rock. They stop at the top, looking down at the suddenly roiling sea, juxtaposed with the calmness of the surf down on the beach they’d just crossed.
Cas reaches down between Dean’s thighs and grabs his cock—it’s starting to fill out against Dean’s thigh already, just from the slick movement of their mouths together and the promise of more to come.
. He has to get back to Cas. Despite how fucked up this situation seems to have gotten, Cas is safe, and home, and a thousand other things that Dean doesn't want to think about right now.
“Come for me now,” Cas murmurs against Dean’s ear, his hand sliding over Dean’s cock, his hips rolling a punishing rhythm. “Come for me, beloved.”
, Dean thinks in horror. It looks engorged and pulsing, painful and gruesome like a blood clot. Cas grips it tight, his eyes flashing bright white. The thing in his hand squeals, whistles in pain like the sound of a kettle steaming in urgency. Then it is silent, still, smoking slightly, turning to ash that slides through Cas’s fingers and onto the floor.
“For not getting it faster,” Cas says quietly. “If we’d known, if I’d tried harder—”
Dean lifts his hand off Castiel’s knee, and reaches up, forward, sliding his palm over Castiel’s shoulder instead. His grip is tight, desperate. He looks at Castiel, looks into him with loud eyes. His thumb brushes against Castiel’s collarbone, trembling minutely.
A cloud passes over Dean’s face, just for a moment, before it clears.
“Gone,” says Dean.
Dean can’t quite make himself dive into the water, but he does wade out to mid-thigh, where he stops and stands, breathes the clean air, and lets the breeze push his hair back from his face.
out.”
“Are you okay?” Cas asks. His voice is gravelly, and, speaking of, Dean’s pretty certain there’s a piece of gravel wedged into his knee from his fall. He looks down. Yep, ripped his jeans, and—oh, great, it’s starting to bleed. His palms sting, and he unfolds them and looks. Okay, great. So, there’s a cute guy, whatever, and Dean fell on his ass (well, knee) and is now bleeding from at least three places, and this really wasn’t the impression he wanted to give.
Dean stares back, blank.
Dean’s face is a juxtaposition. His features are both open and closed, drawing Castiel in while simultaneously holding him at arm’s length.
Wednesday. Last time Dean was aware, it had been four o’clock on a Monday morning and he had been tangled around Cas, trying to keep from coming in his pants as he’d been kissed within an inch of his life.
It goes like this for a few weeks. They nod in acknowledgement in the locker room, trade pleasantries, spot one another on the chest press and barbell squat. They don’t trade numbers, they don’t exchange much more than names and mild inoffensive conversation about gains and reality TV.
“I don’t know, Dean, geez. What do people usually say when they go up and start a conversation with someone they’re attracted to?” Charlie’s leaning one hip against the counter, staring at Dean like he’s a complete idiot.
--to take Cas’s hand between his own again on the walk back to the cottage, to reel him in at the doorway, to swallow down the rising fear that he knows is unfounded, and say: “You know, this has been a really great break and all, but I just wanted to tell you that…” before his courage fails him.
Dean sighs, relief flooding his face. His hands tighten on Castiel’s shoulders, thumbs pressing into trapezoids. With a gentle pressure from his fingers, Dean pulls Castiel forward, just slightly, until they’re hovering even closer into each other’s orbit.
Cas smiles fully, his face lighting up. “I know just the place.”
Dean grunts and hits the button to delete the message. He’s tired of trying to
, he thinks.
Dean’s hard in his jeans, Cas can feel it. He presses the palm of his hand against Dean’s erection. Dean breathes a shaky exhale. “Castiel,” he whines. His fingers curl into the open collar of Cas’s shirt, tugging. “Castiel,” he whispers.
“Fuck, yes, please, just—just
Dean freezes. “Oh god, no,” he says. “No, I cannot watch you work out now without popping a boner.”
Castiel closes his eyes. He can’t look at Dean any more, lest that secret part of himself bursts out and makes itself known. He can’t. Dean’s whole posture, his voice, his words all scream with suffering. Dean is hurting. He can’t make that worse. He keeps his eyes closed, his face turned away. He feels Dean’s hand leave his shoulder, feels the slight jostle as Dean gets up from the couch. He hears his footsteps on the linoleum, hears the front door open and settle closed with a gentle click.
Thankfully Cas saves him. “I would like to have coffee with you, Dean. Why don’t I come back tomorrow, around 5?”
After dinner, they walk back to the Gas ‘n Sip. Dean waits by the Impala, his hand resting on the top of her roof, palm flat and open. His other hand fiddles with the car keys.
“I –“ Dean starts. Castiel feels his fingers flex in the muscles of his arm. “You’re here,” Dean finishes.
“He’s cute,” she says, grinning at him knowingly. He wants to laugh, to join in on the joke. But instead he just stumbles out of the store, hip checking against the glass door as he goes.
Dean groans. “Not this again, Sam. Please, I’m fine.”
Dean shakes his head. “You figure out what this is yet?” he asks, but he already knows the answer.
“That’s one,” he says, pulling away.
“Thought they just saved people from sharks” he bluffs, covering it up with a joke.
Dean actually perks up at that.
"Yeah, we should. How old is she turning?"
"Man, I'm really getting old. Never thought there'd be a point when I'd get dozy over two beers at 9 pm," he grunts softly, sounding disoriented, as if something were tugging his floating head down, his voice alongside it.
Dean still seems to be dead to the world when Sam shifts his legs and ducks his head down awkwardly. It's not that he never acknowledged their new dynamic by pointed looks or hasty retreats, but he'd rather have this supportive-brother speech prepared in advance.
There is, however, a point in acting like he wants to heal. It does something funny to Sam's usual worry lines, holds Cas together as if Dean's touches were stitches, throbbing yet bringing up this achingly sincere smile every time Dean gets up early to brew them coffee and half-hugs Castiel while passing the mug. A few days ago, Cas commented on Dean's questionable diet choices and Dean grumbled in response, promising to look for a spell which could turn him into a rabbit, since that's what is to Cas's liking. The more exact quote here would be "smitten with herbivores'', and you could smack him really hard for bringing this shit up like that, carelessly – but no one cares, certainly not Cas. Cas didn't bat an eyelid, muttering, "this couldn't be farther from the truth", and Dean didn't freak out, they’re okay, he's okay enough to have chuckled, dragging his fingers through the soft mess of Cas's hair, stepping out of the kitchen.
Castiel knows many of Dean's dreams and fears and aspirations. Still, he gives Sam's words his full attention.
There's a big difference between being pumped up with haphazard cultural knowledge processed by a wanna-be-bestselling-author and consuming actual pieces of media by yourself. It's all about the moment. There likely won't be any contributions to the system of symbols or character psychology from the way Dean huffs every time a scene he anticipated plays out, or the way he throws subtle side-glances at Cas during 'iconic moments', or the heat of Dean's arm against his side, the dim hazy lighting, condensation on their beer bottles, – yet these details are what Cas truly cherishes when it comes to mentions of Clint Eastwood or Harrison Ford.
Dean doesn’t see the man again for a few days. Maybe a week. Okay, six days. Dean’s not counting, but he hasn’t seen the guy in six days. He thinks maybe Charlie’s starting to get suspicious about the amount of time Dean spends staring out the front windows at the group over the road. If she tries to call him on it, though, he just threatens to loudly cockblock her every time a hot woman comes into the café.
He remembers sleeping in the back room at the Gas ‘n Sip, and, before that, he remembers the homeless shelters, and, before that, he remembers the bite of the wind and the cold of the rain as he’d been alone in the elements.
“The Gas ‘n Sip, yes,”
Dean’s face feels hot. He turns in his chair, swallows against the heat in his throat, reaches out softly to grab Cas’s shirt. He fights the urge to bury his face in the fabric. Cas’s other hand reaches down, fingers pressing under Dean’s chin, forcing his face up to meet his eyes. Dean doesn’t like the sadness he sees there.
Cas keeps murmuring, and Dean feels his fingers clench, tighten around something deep beneath his rib cage. He’s barely conscious as Cas pulls, tears something out through his flesh. He feels the heat grasp out at him, flaring hot and searing. Cas tugs, and it slides free.
They follow the trail for a while longer, down and around to a small, wide bay. Cas motions to Dean to follow him off the path and down onto the rocks below. They step carefully over boulders to the soft white sand along the water, removing their shoes and dodging a couple of stray crabs that are hurrying to get out of their way.
He pulls out of Dean gently, rolling Dean over onto his back again. He leans over Dean, kissing his forehead, his eyelids, his cheeks. He can see Dean’s heart beating steadily in his chest. Dean’s eyes are closed tight, his hand curved around Cas’s arm.
Cas brings his teeth down lightly onto Dean’s nipple, and Dean arches his back, letting out a dignified moan. Fuck, he’s gonna come just from Cas’s mouth biting and licking across his chest, just from thinking about those thick thighs framing his hips. He’s embarrassingly hard now, and he can feel a damp spot of precome spreading across the front of his shorts.
He grabs his gym bag from beside the couch, finishes lacing up his shoes. It’s Wednesday. Fuckin’ leg day.
“Okay. No hell.” He slots his fingers between Cas’s, squeezing slightly. “What now?”
Dean shakes his head. “Nah, man. I don’t need you to burn through your juice just for that.”
Dean’s really looking forward to cracking that manhole open. He hopes the sewer people take him in kindly.
“You got an apartment?”
Castiel doesn’t open Grindr again, for his own sanity.
“I won’t ‘burn through’ anything,” Cas says, with awkward finger quotes and all.
Cas looks down at him, at the red flush staining his neck and chest, the fine sheen of sweat breaking out across his brow, the come streaking his stomach. He reaches down and undoes his jeans and wriggles out of them, not missing the appreciative way Dean looks at him as he disrobes.
“One latte, on the house.” Dean announces, pouring the last of the milk into the cardboard cup.
“Yeah,” Dean sighs. “Anything, Cas, everything, I’ll take it, please, just touch me,
Dean looks away, looks guilty. Whereas before he’d seemed to fill the room, now it seems to encroach upon him.
“Don’t forget to hydrate,” Cas says, turning on his heel and walking out of the kitchen, Dean’s spluttering cough echoing behind him as he goes.
Castiel hums his disagreement.
“Love you, you know,” he murmurs softly.
Cas responds by running a hand down Dean’s chest, over the muscle that they’ve been building together, brushing a thumb roughly over Dean’s nipple. Dean shivers as his nipple pebbles, and Cas strokes over it again. “And you,” Cas says, “are incredibly fucking sexy.”
“To be honest, I don’t really know,” Castiel says. “Nora is nice. I have a home here, for what it’s worth. I think I needed to just stop, for a moment. To make some sense of all of this...human experience.”
“Yes,” says Cas, before Dean can complain. “Two flat whites and two smashed avo, please.”
He’s always loved Dean, he knows. But now, when he’s alone in this vessel —
It creeps up on him this time, ushered into existence with Cas’s gentle hands, and Dean’s whole body arches, his back bowing, his feet kicking into the mattress, his hands grasping at Cas’s shoulders, his back, gripping him and pulling him up and into a deep kiss. Dean sobs against his mouth, and Cas kisses him through it as Dean curls into himself, coming hard and dry, his orgasm pulsing through him like a sudden wave.
Dean sighs, his expression pinched. He sits against the arm of the sofa, which creaks under him. “I let an angel possess him,” he says.
“I just really want you to fuck me,” Dean says, rushing, bold.
At nine o’clock he wraps up and hands the keys over to Nancy, who works the graveyard shift.
His phone rings in his hand, the vibrations jolting him. He narrows his eyes against the screen’s glare.
“Then I’ll wait til you’re done.”
He feels his erection spring out from under the fabric of his boxers as Cas pulls them down his legs. He kicks them off his feet and loses them somewhere among the sheets.
Dean has one large hand wrapped around a beer bottle, the other resting against the surface of the laminated table. Speedy’s is not really living up to its name, as they’ve had their dinner orders in for almost half an hour with no sign of their burgers appearing in the servery window. Cas would know: he’s compulsively checking the time on his phone, counting down the minutes til Dean will leave him again.
“—that you should really try and meet someone again.”
Cas sighs, leans forward to brace his arm on the table, swaying into Dean’s space. He’s smiling faintly. “Dean, I’ve seen you fall over and drop weights and slip on your own sweat on the gym floor. And I’ve still always been incredibly attracted to you. It took me weeks to get the nerve to ask you if I could spot you. If anything, you intimidate me.”
Cas grins.
“Do you want to come for a swim?” Cas asks, already shucking his shirt. Dean’s brain fritzes.
Dean opens his eyes to the wreck of the Impala, her roof caved in around him. There’s blood stinging his eyes, running down from a gash on his forehead. He blinks back through the red. He blinks.
Cas shrugs. “It’s very shallow here. And safe. And I can protect you.”
“And what? What the fuck is going on?” Dean’s trying very hard not to freak out.
So instead he’s built himself some semblance of a life. The mundanity of it itches at him sometimes, and what used to be the roar of grace beneath his vessel’s skin becomes instead a muted hum in the middle of his very human stomach, growing softer with each passing day. He heats tins of soup on the small electric stove in the salmon pink kitchen. He stocks shelves of chips and jerky at work. He moves between these two locations like an automaton, because although he now moves through the world as a mortal, he has no idea how to truly exist within it.
“Are you close?” he asks.
“Nope, not,” says Dean. He knows that he’s lying, and he knows that
Dean looks down and away. His hand curls into a fist on the car’s roof. He looks back at Castiel and his eyes are
“Uh, there was a bakery in this town I passed through,” says Dean, sounding hesitant. Castiel snaps his eyes up to Dean’s face. Dean looks thoughtful. Considered.
“Ready?” he asks.
Dean grabs the beans and skirts around Charlie, heading back out to the counter where the grinder is. He puts the bag of beans on the counter, and crosses his arms. “What, have you been reading my diary again?”
He reaches a hand down and wraps it around Dean’s cock. Dean cries out, breathing hard.
Dean breathes in, a deep, shuddering breath to the very bottom of his lungs. He lets it out in a rush.
They’ve been driving for hours, north across Kansas and into South Dakota, hunting some witch who’d gotten too big for her boots with some pretty heinous blood magic, wreaking havoc in Rapid City. Dean has a crick in his neck, and a light throb in his lower back that reminds him he’s getting too old to drive eight hours at a stretch. But he’s wired on rest-stop coffee and the adrenalin of a hunt, and he and Sam had decided to tear in to the warehouse anyway.
“Don’t wanna not do that,” Dean murmurs, his mouth so close to Cas’s.
,” Dean gasps out, hips twitching. He makes to sit up, reaching for Cas with one hand. Cas pushes at Dean’s shoulder, presses him back down into the sheets.
He can’t stop thinking about it. Dean’s pleasure is already a heady thing for Cas: the way Dean’s skin flushes, the way his mouth goes slack and easy when Cas fucks him just right, the way his brow twists and his eyes flutter closed when he comes. He thinks about the possibility of more. Of wringing Dean out to the last drop. Of overwhelming him completely with love, with lust, with pleasure. He wants Dean to have everything.
The apartment he’s moved into barely qualifies as a shoebox. The tattered curtains ripple on the sigh of a breeze coming in through the third-storey window. The top of the table he’s sitting at is chipped Formica in an ugly salmon, and the metal-framed chair he’s perched on has a persistent wobble in the back left leg. His meagre collection of clothes sit unpacked still, one month on, as he cycles through six shirts and two pairs of pants over and over. His scalp itches from the cheap shampoo he’d picked up from the supermarket on Rexford’s main drag. It’s quiet. It’s so quiet he imagines he can hear the dust motes settling on the threadbare grey carpet. He doesn’t have a couch. Or a bed. His sleeping bag and pillow lie stretched in the corner of the single bedroom. The water-stained bathroom counter is a cracked brown plastic.
They pull apart, and Cas is moving down, pressing wet, open kisses to Dean’s jaw and throat. Cas is a warm weight above him, and Dean is torn between the heat starting to pool low in his stomach and the unexpected sting starting behind his eyes. He blinks as his vision starts to swim. He blinks.
Cas smiles, and Dean’s pretty sure that the room gets a bit brighter.
Dean,” Cas says, his voice a command.
By the time they’ve finished with dinner—a meal throughout which Dean fidgeted and flustered under Cas’s gaze—he is prepared. He’s ready. He takes Dean’s hand and leads him down the hall to their bedroom, pulling him into the room and pushing the door shut behind them. Dean’s on him within moments, hands tangling in his hair on either side of his head, backing Cas into the closed door and crashing their mouths together.
"Exactly, my cooking skills. I don't mind providing meals for the starving family, but you wanna let loose sometimes."
Cas just stares at his back as Sam turns around and exits the room. He wonders what Dean thinks of 'whatever it is they have right now', whether he has a name for it, then blinks down at his own hand tangled in Dean's hair. Sometimes it feels like the only meaningful part of his angelic essence is the role of a guardian, the one-who-watches-over, as known throughout human history, even though he was never assigned it. Watching Dean in this unarmed and unalarmed state comes to him like flying came once, this fluttering feeling in his head and stomach rooted deeply, close to his core. Castiel draws his knuckles over the freckled cheekbone. The lines on Dean's forehead are smoothed out for once, though the traces of wrinkles still remain. It's somehow thrilling that Cas has all the time in the world to see them deepen with years. A thumb brushes over Dean's eyebrow, just a feather light touch.
And then Dean’s stepping forward, closing the scant two paces between them, settling his hands on Castiel’s shoulders.
“Oh, shit,” he moans. He’s definitely not going to last very long.
It’s warm, wherever he’s waking up. He’s presses his face further into the soft surface he’s resting on, feels arms tighten around his back. He cracks an eye; he’s leaning on Cas’s chest, head tucked under Cas’s chin. He can feel where there’s something suspiciously like drool sticking the side of his cheek to Cas’s skin. Cas’s fingers are strong and soft where they press gently into his sides, fitting between his ribs, squeezing lightly.
“Cas,” Dean says in a sigh, reaching and and pulling Castiel to him. He feels Dean’s arms circle firmly around his back, feels Dean’s fists pressing between his shoulder blades. He raises his own arms and awkwardly hugs Dean in return before pulling back.
And she smiles and winks and turns back to head into the store office. The phone feels heavy in Castiel’s hands. That familiar tug reaches into his chest again and pulls, yanks almost, tugging out the door and down the road, off in the direction Dean last drove.
“We should go somewhere less likely to end in injury,” Dean murmurs, pulling away just an inch, his forehead resting against Castiel’s.
So he corners Dean in the kitchen one morning, not long after their conversation, intent setting his shoulders and guiding his hands. He backs Dean against the kitchen counter where he’d been mixing pancake batter, and lays his hands low on Dean’s hips.
Cas looks down at Dean’s hand, down at Dean’s face, blue eyes searching. He closes the book softly. Reaches down and covers Dean’s hand with his own.
“Now, I imagine, we’ve got a lot to learn about one another,” Cas says, squeezing back. “If you can be patient with me.”
“Good morning to you too, Charlie.” Dean heads into the back kitchen to grab some new beans for the counter. Charlie follows him.
“I love you, too,” Castiel breathes into the space between them when they finally break apart.
Dean sighs and stretches below him. “That was great, Cas,” he says, voice slurred and tired. “Love you,” he murmurs.
“What?”
, flashes the little green dot.
“Sam?” he asks.
Cas does take him out again, this time for dinner the following Thursday. They go out for good steaks, and Dean doesn’t spill anything on himself, or drink too much, or make an ass of himself. He does make Cas laugh, though, and he loves it, loves that full, crinkly-eyed smile. The lighting is low, and he can feel Cas pressing their legs together under the table, and he’s not surprised, doesn’t freak out at all, when Cas fits his hand to the side of Dean’s neck, thumb tracing the stubble along his jaw, before leaning in and kissing him softly on the mouth. When they break apart, finally, he breathes in Cas’s shaky exhalation, and tips his head forward, bringing their foreheads together.
“Okay,” he says.
“That’s it, that’s it, beautiful,” Cas murmurs, stroking his hands over Dean’s belly, his chest, his biceps, his waist. “So beautiful, Dean, so beautiful.”
Dean nods, recovering himself slightly. “Yes. Okay. Yes. I’d like that.”
“So,” Dean says. He clears his throat, looks around the room again. “You doin’ okay?”
that just makes him want to let go, to shrug it all away and just see what happens when he doesn’t have a constant death grip on the fraying edges of his life.
“How much did it take from me?” he asks.
“Come,” says Cas. “There’s more.”
They continue along the beach, Dean keeping his eyes above waist height in case any more old man dicks walk into his field of vision. Before long they reach the edge of the beach and the wooden walkway that leads up to the trail over the next cliff.
Cas tips his head towards Dean, thoughtful. Dean blushes, a light pink colouring his cheeks.
"Oh?”
Dean just wants to fall back asleep. He can feel bile rising in his throat, a burning in his chest.
“Cas, Cas, c’mon…” Dean is breathing raggedly above him, head tossing back and forth on the pillows. He pulls his knees up, opens his thighs. Cas wraps a hand around one ankle, feeling the fine structure of Dean’s bones beneath his fingers. He tugs, and Dean’s thighs come to rest on his shoulders. Castiel’s jaw aches. Saliva is dripping from his mouth, soaking Dean’s pubic hair, easing the way of Cas’s other hand as its wraps around the base of Dean’s cock. He slides his tongue over the head of Dean’s cock, pulls back to seal his lips around the tip and suck hard. He runs his tongue up the underside of Dean’s length, tracing a thick vein that runs up from the root.
“That’s great, Dean. He must be very supportive. Does he live in Kansas, too?”
Cas shrugs. “Yes and no. This is a well-known spot for it. We can come back later if you want,” he says, smiling slyly.
The next morning, they sleep late. When they wake up, the sun is well into the sky, so they head out to one of the small cafés on the main street. Dean stares at the coffee menu, confused.
“Jesus,
Dean pushes up onto one elbow, looks down at Cas lying back among the pillows. He recognises now that they’re in Cas’s room. The clock says 11.32 – he’s not sure if it’s night or morning.
Dean groans. “And then?” he asks.
“I know,” says Cas, smiling.
“And that’s all you remember?” Cas looks at him, and Dean can see concern in the crinkle of his brow.
“Hold on, Dean. We’ve got it,” he says. “We’ve got you. Please, hold on.”
“Did we…?” he asks.
“I know I said birthday cake is important, but birthday pie is even better,” he says.
Dean shrugs, winds up the window and steps out of the car. He seems so big to Castiel, so real, from the tips of his hair to the scuffed soles of his boots. He’s so utterly, devastatingly present. Castiel wants to reach out and lay a hand on him. But he doesn’t.
Dean sputters. “No-oo? Yes? Yes. A bit.”
Dean crosses to the empty chair next to Cas’s and flops down into it, pulling one of the nearest books over to him. He shuffles in his chair, his knee brushing against Cas’s under the table.
Castiel watches as Dean looks around the apartment. Even though he spends every day and night here, it’s like he’s seeing it for the first time with Dean in the room. The Formica table with a single chair. The stained couch. The torn linoleum in the kitchen. The tragedy of a toaster oven. The single bowl and spoon in the drying rack. The great, unadorned wasteland of the walls, which he couldn’t bring himself to put up a single personal item—not a photo, not a picture, not a cheap dollar-store reprint of a Van Gogh, even.
“Which part?” he asks.
“Charlie! That’s private!” Dean shouts, and takes after her as she runs, cackling, into the kitchen.
Manny nods. “Yeah, Cas is cool. He should be back soon, I think he said he’d drop by again tomorrow.”
“Of course,” says Cas.
Dean makes a face. “That is truly horrible.”
Cas looks at him curiously. “It’s Wednesday, Dean.”
Okay, so maybe not checking out the hot guy is harder than Dean thought it would be. He’s on the cable cross half-heartedly working through sets of oblique twists, and each turn of his body brings him right around to face the benches and dumbbells set up in front of a mirror on the other side of the gym. And so maybe Dean is pulling through each rep and his eyes keep catching on hot guy, who’s not just into working his thick thighs, but apparently also is curling something close to 90 pounds, biceps flexing, form perfect.
Dean and Castiel quickly scrambled to get into the car.
And then there’s the added pressure of it all being recorded for television. Regardless of how the evening goes, his brother, Gabriel, is bound to use the footage as an endless source of teasing and amusement.
Soon into the beginning of their relationship, Dean and Castiel had been caught in Castiel’s bed by Gabriel.
Sam was going to Stanford for college. Dean was taking him and probably not coming back. This was Castiel’s last chance. Dean was giving him one last chance.
Castiel feels the life return to his body.
Castiel feels his heart flutter at Dean almost calling him ‘babe’. It was always Dean’s favourite term of endearment for him.
Dean squeezed him again and breathed in Castiel’s scent too.
In those moments, Dean fell in love with the little girl. Despite the environment surrounding her, she didn’t cry. Instead, she spent the whole time with her tiny fist grasped around Dean’s finger and staring up at him with the biggest blue eyes he’d ever seen – ones that reminded him of Castiel.
?” Dean asks and flushes at the slip.
It was a classic college romance. Dean and Castiel were paired together in dorm allocations and became instant friends. Castiel never would have seen himself forming a friendship with someone as out-going as Dean. But the funny thing about sharing a room with someone, you soon learn the things they’d like to keep hidden. Things that could warm them to somebody like Castiel.
Honestly, it does feel good to hear about Dean’s life since college. Despite the circumstances of his return to his hometown, Dean seems to be happy. Even through small talk alone Castiel can tell that he is the same Dean he’d loved all those years ago. He’s learned some life lessons, as has Castiel, but he is still the same person at his core. It’s as if his soul is beaming out to Castiel.
Instead she opens the message to find a picture. It takes a few seconds to load but once it does, she almost drops the phone.
Which also meant two months since Castiel last saw and spoke to Dean.
“Dean?”
Castiel remained frozen on the spot, tears now flowing freely down his face. He only moved when he could hear the deep rumble of Dean’s car starting up outside and fading into the distance.
“Cas, I love you,” Dean whispered. “I know I don’t say it enough, but I do. And I know you love me. You can’t do this.” He reached out a hand to hold Castiel’s.
“Scared of what, bab-
“What are you thinking about?” Castiel asked, softly, bringing Dean back to the moment.
“Though, to be fair,” Castiel said, eying the clock on the wall above the fireplace, “it’s only fifteen minutes until midnight, so she was close.”
They both knew that in all reality they’d be asleep before their heads hit the pillow. Leaving the new year to creep in while they are curled up together.
But he didn’t feel strong enough to leave his family. Castiel couldn’t imagine his father’s reaction if he said he wasn’t going to marry Daphne.
Dean’s heart broke for her. He knew what it was like to have a disrupted childhood and he wouldn’t wish that on anyone.
Upon reaching the hospital, Dean was met by a police officer and some lady who worked for children’s services.
Castiel simply nodded and got into position. They’d rehearsed the wedding countless times so everything ran smoothly. Castiel had felt it a little unnecessary but he wasn’t going to argue with his father.
Castiel had understood Dean’s need to be with his family and offered to go with him. Dean flipped out and told Castiel that there was no way he was going to be the reason Castiel didn’t follow through with what he’d worked so hard for. That he wasn’t worth Castiel throwing away his life for. Nothing frustrated Castiel more than Dean thinking he wasn’t good enough.
Castiel ends the call and takes a deep breath before standing and unlocking the stall door. Luckily, there is no one in the rest of the bathroom who overheard that conversation.
“Ah, I wouldn’t worry about it. Everyone here is nervous at the start.” Benny shrugs. Well, except the ones who are pretty, and they know it,” he chuckles. “And I’ll be honest with ya,” he says, leaning on the bar closer to Castiel, “very few of the couples who go on the show end up together anyway. Don’t stress. Enjoy the evening. If nothing else, it’ll be a story to tell.”
She soon settled and the paramedic, Jody, who Dean had worked with on a few occasions, made a quip about him being the baby whisperer. Dean just chuckled and looked down at the now sleeping baby and felt himself reconsider his stance on having children of his own.
And with that he brings Castiel into a firm kiss that leaves nothing up to interpretation.
“Dean? Is everything ok-“ Castiel was cut off by Dean’s lips on his.
With a final aching kiss, they parted that night. Each leaving with a piece of the other.
He sighed a little in relief when the doors to the church opened, letting in a waft of air that, though wasn’t necessarily cool, was cooler than the oppressive heat of the church. Standing at the altar waiting for the ceremony to start was starting to feel like a lifetime in the sweltering heat. The doors were left wide open, along with the windows, to get an airflow through the building.
By the time graduation rolled around, they were set to be together forever. They had plans to move in together properly after Castiel accepted his dream job, which was rarely offered to anyone just out of college.
“You alright, man?” The bartender, Benny, according to his name badge, interrupts Castiel’s thoughts.
Of course he does. But Dean doesn’t want it. He still hasn’t answered. And even if Dean says yes, Castiel is terrified of it all going wrong again. What if they’re just destined for failure? Dean is the love of his life, Castiel has no doubt about that. He wouldn’t be able to take it if it all fell apart again.
And suddenly Castiel feels himself being taken back eight years.
Castiel shook his head affectionately in response.
“What can I say? That’s what big sisters are for.” Castiel can hear her smile through the phone. “Now go and have one last date with Dean, get some closure and I’ll be waiting at yours with Mr Whiskers and pizza for when you get home. Okay?”
“I’m scared of putting my heart on the line again. I’m scared of telling you I still love you and you not saying it back. I’m scared that you will say it back and everything will still go wrong.” Castiel blinks back the tears building behind his eyes. He’s cried too much for one night. “I’ve had to leave you once before Dean. I don’t know if I can do it again.”
Castiel frowns and realisation dawns on him, “I’m sorry! I didn’t mean it in a bad way!”
“And how’s your father?”
Dean snorted. “Yeah. Guess she must have crashed out after the second load of candy and Tangled.”
Castiel held his breath and stayed still.
Ten years ago, Dean would never have dreamed of being at home on New Year’s Eve. But now? He couldn’t think of anywhere else he’d rather be.
Dean can feel the wet mess of precome and saliva travelling down past his sac, sliding between his cheeks. Cas chases it with his tongue, flickering wet and slippery once, twice over Dean’s hole.
“It’s not cockblocking if there’s no cock, Dean,” Charlie says.
“Uhuh,” Dean groans, mindless, eyes closed. “Yeah, Cas, yeah.”
“The part about making me…you know…again and again.”
The smell of the alcohol is potent, stinging at his eyes. It reminds him of Dean, of the tang of it on Dean’s breath when he was drunk and angry, when he’d use cheap bourbon to dull his senses and close off the walls around his heart. Castiel knew, because Castiel could feel everything about Dean. Could. Not anymore.
Dean’s face flushes as some the pages of some well-thumbed daydreams--
“Thank you,” Dean says.
“Because there’s a charmingly named rock formation called Hell’s Gates, and I thought you’d appreciate the irony,” Cas deadpans.
“Yeah, yeah, I want it.” Dean spreads his knees further apart on the bed, making room for Cas to crawl between his thighs and push into him. But Cas waits.
: : : : :
He hears Dean groan and drop his head back to the pillow. Cas leans back in with his mouth, kissing the tender flesh of Dean’s hole, licking gently, then more with more surety as Dean sighs above him. He tastes his own spend, bitter and earthy on his tongue as he stiffens the muscle and pushes it in, just a little, into Dean’s rim. Dean’s moaning in earnest now, nonsense words and sounds slipping from his mouth as Cas seals his lips around Dean’s hole and
“There’s nothing left,” he says, placing the bags on the kitchenette counter. “Must be all cleaned out with the blizzard warning.”
“I fucked up.”
“Ready when you are, Dean.” Fucking hell, as if there isn’t enough to focus on during a chest press, now Dean has to somehow function enough to keep his form and not ogle hot guy—Cas—standing over him like the Greek god of power lifting.
“You’ve really got nothing?” Sam asks.
“Well,” he says. “I did always want to get my toes in some warm sand.”
“Okay?” he asks.
“I love you like this,” he says, running his hands up Dean’s thighs, dragging his nails on the way back down. Dean sighs deeply, runs his hands over his face. “You make me so
“Ugh, no, thank you,” Dean says, shaking his head.
When their breakfast arrives, it is indeed smooshed avocado, but mixed with lemon juice and salt and pepper, and slathered onto thick slices of sourdough bread, topped with crumbled feta cheese and some sort of
“Us?” he asks.
“I’ve got you,” he murmurs into the top of Cas’s head, feeling his body shudder with deep, human breaths. “I’ve got you.”
“Okay,” he says. “Pancakes tomorrow. I’ll cook.”
: : : : :
“We’re in Noosa, Australia. Sunshine Beach.”
Slowly, inch by inch, Cas slides into the warmth and welcome of Dean’s body. Dean moans loudly, almost a wail, tapering off into a sob that sounds a bit like Cas’s name.
Cas does not, to Charlie’s disappointment, choose the floral loveseat, but instead slides into one of two worn green armchairs around a small coffee table.
Cas smiles, drops a kiss on the head of Dean’s cock, which is flushing deep red and growing firmer again, wet at the tip. He’s never been able to deny Dean anything. Certainly not now when it’s so willingly asked for, so hungrily taken.
Dean nods, shakes his head, nods again. “’s a lot,” he says, the words dragging out of his lips slow and slurred.
“Yeah, yeah,” Dean whispers, before Cas has even asked, eager to agree to anything Cas wants to give him.
Dean shrugs. “It’s complicated,” he repeats.
And he’s never been one to back down from a challenge.
Dean opens his eyes briefly in what looks like the back of the Continental. He sees the back of Sam’s head in the driver’s seat, can feel warm hands against his chest. He looks up into Cas’s face, sees him look panicked, angry.
Cas runs a hand up Dean’s arm, to his shoulder, to his chin, which he lifts so he can look Dean into Dean’s face. His eyes are clear, honest, warm, sincere.
“So,” Dean says as their food arrives, smiling at the waitress and adjusting the plate in front of him so that his burger is optimally positioned to be eaten at an alarming speed.
Charlie shrugs. “Eh. Take back the night.”
He sits up, on guard, reaching under his pillow automatically for the knife that should always be there.
“Maybe I can help,” Cas says, his hands curling urgently in on themselves. “Tell me what’s happening and I can —”
Kissing Dean still feels like a revelation. He remembers the first time they kissed, a soft and tender flowing of relief between them. He kisses Dean now with the same gentleness, feeling Dean’s lips curving into a smile against his own.
“You’re back with us.”
Manny starts to distribute the food to some of the other people in the camp. Dean doesn’t recognise all of them, but he waves hello to Sheila and Lou, two women who’ve been at the camp for the last month.
He pulls his fingers out of Dean, mindful of the way Dean sobs and his hole clenches around the sudden emptiness. Sitting back on his knees, he grabs the lube, slicks up his cock, and grasps Dean underneath his knees, pulling him into his lap.
Dean’s warm. He’s warm, and sun-drenched, and--despite the uncomfortable roiling in his stomach that accompanies Cas taking him as a passenger on a celestial transcontinental flight--surprisingly calm. He cracks his eyes open and is immediately overwhelmed by the bluest sky he’s ever stood under. The air smells like salt and he can hear the faint churn of surf somewhere off to his right.
Dean feels a bit shell-shocked.
He thrusts hard, twists his hand over the hard length of Dean’s cock.
“Did you just say ‘nudie’?”
Dean likes to pretend that he doesn’t need to work out, that exercising is terrible and only something his awful health-freak of a little brother would do. But he will concede to lifting weights three times a week, as he argues that he can spend some of that time sitting down, and definitely none of it running or, heaven forbid, doing
Cas lets himself be pinned against the door, lets Dean have this moment of control. It won’t last long.
“I don’t want to stop kissing you,” Castiel says, chasing Dean’s mouth with his own.
“What the hell is a ‘flat white’?” he asks, his voice probably too loud.
He sees Cas’s breath start to hitch, notes the red flush travelling down from his neck to his chest, and then Cas is coming in hot stripes over Dean’s torso. Dean shivers at the sensation of Cas’s release splashing onto him, feels his cock give a feeble twitch. “Jesus Christ,” he moans. He’s not sure how, but Cas seems to know how to push all of his buttons.
: : : : :
Cas’s hand stills where it’s running across the back of Dean’s neck.
“Because it’s summer in the southern hemisphere, and I’ve always wanted to come here.”
“It’s...nice?” he tries.
. Dean sometimes scoffs at his sincerity, or turns away from it, or files it away as hyperbole, because sometimes Cas knows the things he says are too much, or too raw, and Dean needs time to process it before he can engage. Like when Cas had Dean wrapped in his arms after the first time they made love, when he said:
Everything feels better in shorts and sandals. The sandals, made largely of worn leather straps, feel very uncool, until Dean realises how comfortable they are, and how far away he is from anyone he knows who might judge his footwear choices. Cas is wearing honest-to-god reef sandals, and Dean can’t look at him without a big warm bloom of affection suffusing his chest.
“Still working at the…”
Castiel doesn’t know what to say. He can’t understand
“Are you close?” he asks, and his voice is wrecked. He licks his thumb, reaches down behind Dean’s balls and rubs roughly over his perineum as his slides Dean’s cock back between his lips.
“How long?” Dean asks, clearing his dry throat. “We were back from Wyoming, we were—”
In heaven, Castiel was a masterful tactician, inspired in his planning and ruthless in execution. Cas, as a human, is delighted to find he still possessed those innate skills—even if he applies them in slightly different ways these days.
He picks up the bottle and tips it into his mouth. Whiskey floods his tongue, sharp and acrid and wholly unpleasant. He coughs, swallows, coughs again. It tastes different this time, as a human.
“No, not time.
“Don’t get me wrong,” Dean continues. “I’m game.”
“Yeah?” he asks, breathless and soft, like he’s scared to hope for the answer.
Cas redoubles his efforts, buttocks flexing as he fucks up into Dean’s warm body. Dean groans, and Cas feels his cock jerk in his hand.
He reaches his hand down and swipes his fingers through the come pooling on Dean’s stomach. It’s tacky now, starting to cool as he rubs it between his thumb and fingers. He gathers more, and reaches his hand down between Dean’s legs, rubbing the pads of his fingers over Dean’s hole.
“Shhh,” Dean hushes him. “Sleep, please.”
A profile photo of a nearby user catches his eye. Strong, stubbled jaw. Plush lips quirked in a half-grin. It’s familiar, the twist of that mouth. He’d know Dean anywhere.
“Yes,” says Cas, sounding amused. “I had noticed. That’s probably one of the first things I noticed about you: that you were a man. An incredibly kind man, but, yes, a man.”
But for now he runs his fingers along Dean’s upper arms, soothing and gentle, pressing his face into the nape of Dean’s neck and kissing the soft skin along his hairline.
The room spins when Dean opens his eyes; the familiar roll and pitch of too much whiskey. He squeezes his eyes shut against the nausea, rolling onto his side in an act of self-preservation. The surface below him is smooth leather. He cracks an eye: he’s sprawled over Baby’s back seat, fully dressed. His mouth feels furry and tastes like a hangover already.
It’s getting quiet, late in the afternoon, so Dean starts removing leftover bagels and muffins from the display cabinet to take over the road.
“Strip,” Cas says, and Dean is falling over himself to comply. He eagerly pulls his shirt over his head and tosses it onto the floor. Cas’s hands join him in undoing the button fly of his jeans, wrapping fingers around the waist of his pants and underwear and pulling them onto the floor. Dean steadies himself with a hand on Cas’s shoulder as he lifts one foot and then the other, Cas reaching to roll of his socks and add them to the pile of clothing on the floor.
“You want me to run those over, boss?” Charlie asks.
“How was the hunt?” he asks.
They find the witch in a back store room, bowls of blood and burning herbs, acrid smoke and the sharp tang of iron almost suffocating in the room. She turns to them, hisses, starting to chant an incantation.
“I thought we could go for a walk,” Cas says.
Sam’s where Dean expected to find him, head down over a spellbook. Cas sits beside him at the large table, poring over another volume. Dean leans against the doorway, and clears his throat.
He comes like a fire hose, shooting up his chest and to his chin with a strangled cry. Cas pulls back, panting, slowing his hand and stroking Dean through his orgasm. Then, when Dean’s eyes have cracked open again, Cas meets them with a dark, hungry look, before crawling back up Dean’s body and straddling his hips. Dean sighs as Cas takes himself in hand, stroking firmly, reaching down with the other to palm at his balls. Cas’s cock is thick and flushed dark, and Dean wants nothing more than to get it inside him, whatever way he can.
“We were—” Dean doesn’t even really know how to start this one. He’s glad that he’s whiskey-flushed and half-asleep, looser than he would be able to achieve otherwise. “You know, Cas. We were in my bed, and we were—”
“Guh,” Dean says, with dignity.
Charlie rolls her eyes. “Come
Cas looks at the two bags of snack food lying on the kitchen counter. “There’s no way we’re going to make it that long without…”
. His fingertips ghost over the keyboard on the screen, imagining writing it, sending it. Why not? he thinks. Why shouldn’t he just say it? It’s not going to change anything between them. It won’t bring Dean magically to his side, across that vast distance that they’ve let grow between them. But the words would be there, a life raft in the empty sea. Something he could cling onto in the rolling dark.
Dean shuffles against Cas, pressing him backwards until the kitchen table bumps against the back of his thighs. He lets go of Dean’s shirt to reach behind himself, brace a hand on the edge of the table, and hoist himself to sit on the formica surface. Dean moves in to stand between Castiel’s open knees, mouth moving more hungrily now, tongue darting out to lick into Castiel’s mouth.
Cas looks a bit taken aback. “I didn’t know this was a date, Dean.”
“So, you stayed, huh?”
“You’ll be fine,” Cas says, kissing Dean’s mouth gently. “Just think of me there, next to you,” his hand starts sliding down Dean’s flank, curling over his hip. “Watching you,” Cas’s fingertips tease gently over his cock, coaxing a return of bloodflow. “Watching you watch me,” Cas breathes against his mouth, and Dean is getting hard again, already, as Cas’s fingers close around him.
“Oh yeah,” Dean continues. “Cursed objects, magical items, a library with books on books — Sam is in nerd loser heaven right now.”
He feels Cas swallow. “No, Dean. Not when you—no.”
It makes Dean nervous, getting what he wants. Having Cas whole and here and unharmed. He licks his lips, shuffles closer to Cas across the mattress. Cas tightens his arm around Dean’s waist. Dean slots their legs together more tightly. He leans in, and Cas’s mouth is soft and warm and inviting. It’s a comfort, and Dean feels a flood of relief at the absence of heat in his chest. He feels warm, but it’s different; it’s softer and rounder and a good thing. Cas’s hand slides up to gently cup the back of his head. He can do this.
. God, Dean doesn’t even really know where to start with that one. There’s always something. Fucking cursed, fucking marked. He rubs his hand over his face, wants to dig his fingers into something and squeeze. He feels heat licking up the inside of his throat; feels sick with it.
Dean walks over to the couch and sits. He looks wrong there, all wrong, like a puzzle piece jammed into an ill-fitting gap in the picture. Castiel should be happy to see him here. But he’s not. Having Dean here just makes it even clearer what a farce his existence here is.
Cas shrugs. “A few hours. It’s incredible.”
Cas’s answer is quiet. “It’s been six weeks since that witch in Rapid City,” he says. “We tried, Dean. We—”
Dean blushes, his fingers tapping against Cas’s ribs.
He pushes open the door of the car, stumbles out onto the hard floor of the garage, the concrete cold and real through what he now notices are the socks shrugging off his bare feet. The lights are too bright, suddenly. Dean blinks against the glare. He blinks.
“You gonna fuck me, Cas?” Dean slurs, his voice sounding like he’s floating. Cas could now if he wanted—and he wants to,
“And then?” Dean asks, delighted that he seems to be staying the night.
Cas grips Dean’s hips firmly, then withdraws his cock just an inch before sliding back firmly. The angle must be good—and he’s done this enough times to have committed it to memory, the way that Dean wants it best, the angles and rhythms that drive him wild. It must be good, because when he does it again, this time pulling out further and driving back in with a firm stroke, Dean wails, a string of moaned vowels that break free from his mouth on a shaky exhale.
Castiel is shocked, his head spinning. For Dean to have done this, to have let this happen to Sam...he can't imagine how dire the situation must have been. The way Dean must have carried this burden, the guilt of it splitting him nearly in two. He wishes Dean could have told him. He wishes he could have been powerful enough to help.
Dean goes silent for a few days, leaving Castiel to pick up his routine: home, work, work, home, where he lies in bed rereading Dean's last messages.
“Let me get these coffees together. Take a seat.”
“Well, aren’t we are pair of idiots?” he says.
But Cas is there. Cas is leaning over him, chanting in what sounds like Enochian. Dean feels the heat in his chest spasm, flash. Cas keeps muttering, sleeves rolled up, reaching one hand over Dean’s chest, and then Dean cries out as Cas pushes his hand
, I’m fallible and breakable and
“Why didn’t you tell me?” Castiel asks.
“You’re so beautiful,” he says, and Dean pats his arm in reply.
Dean doesn’t answer. Cas pinches Dean’s side with the hand still at his waist.
It takes Castiel about five seconds of looking at the app before he realises that “nice” may not be the overriding quality that these men possess. But he lets Nora take his photo, cajoling him into a half-smile that doesn’t even come close to reaching his eyes. He lets her upload the photo to his profile, set some of his basic information into the app. He takes his phone back as she presses it, firm and well-meaning, into his hands.
“Yeah,” Dean huffs a laugh. “I mean, not right now. But…god, you just make me feel…” He trails off. “It’s never been so intense as it is with you.”
Except speaking of wobbly steps, Dean seems to somehow forget that there is a step from the front of the café down onto the street, and he trips, arms pinwheeling in a way that he really hopes isn’t as uncoordinated as it feels, and falls hard on his knee, palms scraping the sidewalk.
Cas hovers next to him, hands clasping at nothing, nervousness, finally, showing under his veneer of cool.
that hurts.
“Huh,” Dean says. “Well. Shit.”

that he’d rather not cop to having.
As he’s drifting off, he can feel Cas’s fingers start to card softly through his hair. He turns his head into the sensation, and feels, just slightly, something start to shift in him. It’s not cracking open like he’d long expected it to, but instead it’s being gently guided to light with the warmth of the sun, the sound of the ocean, the softness of the sand beneath him, and the surety of Cas’s hands.
Dean is trying
Cas sighs, wraps his arms tighter around Dean, pulls him closer to his chest. He feels Cas drop a soft kiss onto the top of his head.
, fingers shifting down and through and into Dean’s chest cavity. Dean can feel his fingers groping, gripping.
He’s not trying to be coy, it just comes out that way. He immediately wants to take it back.
Cas slips his mouth up Dean’s chest, up his neck, over the stubble on his chin and up to Dean’s mouth, sealing their lips in a heated kiss.
“So, I may have made a miscalculation with the booking,” Cas says, not meeting Dean’s eye.
This is what Dean does, his logical brain reasons. He cares about people. He shares that caring through service, through favours, though practical, physical objects he can hand people and say: Look, I made this for you, because I love you. He knows Dean well enough to recognise that part of him.
It’s 6.45am, a more decent hour this time, when Dean slides his eyes open and turns his head to the glare of an unfamiliar alarm clock. He sighs, taking in his surroundings. Motel room: aging floral bedspread, cigarette burn in the carpet, notes spread over the kitchenette bench.
“Ready?” he asks.
Is this always what it’s like for humans? This terrifying free-falling? His breath catches in his throat, like his airways are constricting by the second, and any moment now he’ll cease to breathe.
“Here,” Dean says, nudging Cas out of the way. “Let me take a look.”
He wakes with a start. He’s back in the bunker, resting his head against the soft back of a an armchair in the library that’s been pulled up against the heavy table. Books are sprawled open on the table’s surface; spell books, lore collections. Cas is sitting across the table, looking rumpled. His face looks soft with concern and concentration. Dean takes in the disarray of his hair, the casual roll of his sleeves. Again, the suit jacket is nowhere to be seen.
Dean thinks Cas is trying very hard not to laugh at him.
Dean comes back a few weeks later, on a perfect June afternoon, stopping by the Gas ‘n Sip and swaggering through the doors.
“Shit,” he says, voice wrecked. “Cas, that was…fuck.”
