“Something on your mind?” she asks after Castiel has set his bag on its hook and booted up his computer.
“Thanks, Char. Really.”
The hell hound’s breath is sticky-hot on the back of Sam’s neck. It’s here for the man who’s shut up in his house. Sam though is out in the brightly lit yard – one of those neighborhoods that go all out during the holidays. He’s suddenly thankful for the garish decorations: the lights provide enough glow to see at the late hour and the blanket of snow let him track the hound’s pawprints. They’re close when the thing lunges and Sam grabs the nearest decoration – a plastic Ebenezer Scrooge – to jam in the beast’s maw before ganking it with the Colt.
an idea I can get behind."
“Is that who you had lunch with today?” Sam asks tentatively.
Castiel lets his mind wander to the day ahead, pocketing the change from his coffee order and making his way to the bus station, anticipation making him drag is feet. He truly loves his archivist job: it’s behind the scenes, and he gets to brag about the folk art museum's collection on its social media sites. He rarely makes public appearances except when new exhibits open. Recently though, he’s been pulled into a maddening quest for a new exhibit that he simply can’t wrap his head around, no matter how many times he reviews his colleague’s notes.
Dean says something in response, but it’s lost to the sounds of running water from the bathroom. Castiel finishes the tea while he’s getting dressed and Dean joins him in the bedroom halfway through, throwing on the jeans, flannel, and t-shirt he wore the previous day. Castiel hands him a clean pair of socks and Dean thanks him, disappearing to the front of the apartment.  He can hear Dean picking up their forgotten beers, listens to Dean run the sink in the kitchen while he gathers his files for work, and they meet at the front door, ready to start their day.
“Smells awesome, Cas,” Dean announces, stepping through the arched doorway into the kitchen. The room is all dark cherry cabinets and full-sized appliances, and it’s Castiel’s favorite room in the place. He always makes an excuse to feed any company that’s present.
“Please read over the highlighted parts? I’d like to know if any of what that says is true,” he requests, hesitant. He watches Dean skim over the passages he found in Charlie’s notes, back before they knew each other’s names. “I know it sounds crazy, but I think it…fits. Somehow. That you might be a, an um…”
“Thanks, Cas,” he says into the microphone they have set up in the space cleared for the performers. “This one’s for you.” He winks and strums a little louder, playing through all the songs he’s written for Cas over the last nine months. He usually watches the crowd while he performs, paying careful attention to the emotions passing between them and him, but tonight, he only has eyes for Cas. Cas, who is staring back at him with his ocean eyes brimming with tears. It makes his heart soar and his amulet warm with the love between them.
“Congrats on the band, too. I can’t believe they finally agreed to play. It’s awesome.”
“Thank you for coming over on short notice,” he says, once the pizza is served and their mouths are burned.
Dean stares down at the phone, shocked at her words. He’s still contemplating how he wants to reply when the dots bounce along next to her name. He decides to wait for her to finish.
“You look…good?” Sam muses, eyeing him while he stuffs a sandwich into his mouth.
Dean seems unconvinced, and they finish the pizza. Dean’s waiting him out, he knows.
on a rugaru milk run. Back at the motel, he’d scoured the internet on a thrift shop laptop; painstakingly hooked the tape deck to it and recorded the song. It’s the only holiday tune Baby knows.
Castiel takes a sip from his water glass and the waitress stops by to take their order. Dean thinks he could listen to Castiel read the phone book without tiring, the other man’s voice is deep and rich and leaves his ears buzzing. After she leaves with the menus, Castiel leans forward, pen poised to jot down relevant details from the questions he’s about to ask Dean. He really wishes he wasn’t so nervous.
“You said ‘us’, how many siblings do you have?”
As he picks out a tune for her, he decides he wants to spend every morning just like this.
He reaches into his pocket just as he arrives at the man's case and produces a ten-dollar bill.  He bends to put the bill inside the case and when he comes back up, the man is smiling, the apples of his cheeks tinged pink when Castiel returns the gesture. The man plays on at a quieter tone, like this song is just for the two of them and Castiel is compelled to speak to him.
He and Dean turn to the group, who is pulling instruments and amplifiers from the van, ready to play war anthems for the Battle of Moondoor.
“You think you could really kill anything with a BB gun?” Sam scoffs.
Castiel’s small one-bedroom apartment is surrounded by condos, painted beige, and features a useless electric fireplace in the middle of the living room. Every apartment he’s had in California has a fireplace, and he can’t reconcile the loss of wall space with the average temperatures in Palo Alto. When it’s cold, he drags a second blanket to the couch and swaps for flannel sheets. He can’t even toast a marshmallow on the thing. He tried once in his first apartment, and nearly set off the smoke detector.
"No, bitch, just got up from a nap," it's a bald-faced lie and they both know it; Dean never sleeps on his back. Let alone uncovered. Even when he doesn't have a blanket, Dean uses his flannel to cover as much of himself as possible.
The song mentioned in chapter two is Death Cab for Cutie's
"C'mon, we can go make out in bed before you banish yourself to the couch tomorrow." Castiel reached a hand down to help Dean stand up.
That night, Dean lulls himself to sleep with the song he wrote for the blue-eyed man, the quilt pulled high over his shoulders.
“Charlie has already completed the majority of the planning. She's come up with a truly unique perspective on oral histories through folk songs. She plans to display our collection of instruments to tell the history of the bardic tradition. I suspect she secretly wants a tie-in with Moondoor if at all possible. The missing piece will be pinpointing how best to bring the community element into it.”
They sit in silence for a moment, their food delivered and eaten, and plates cleared away. When Castiel speaks again, he’s quiet, “How long do you think you’ll stay?”
his room, and Sam doesn’t want to take his case files into his own bedroom to escape the noise. Instead, he sighs loudly and shuffles his papers, and tries to get his brother to shut up by making as much distracting noise as possible. It isn’t working.
It’s mere days until the opening when Charlie drags him, along with Dean, Gilda, and Anson, to the park, which has been made over into half Renaissance Faire, half battleground, in honor of the day’s events. They’ve all dressed up for the occasion, of course. Charlie wears a heavy gold crown, cape and a maroon brocade gown befitting her queenly status. She carries Anson on her hip, dressed up as her knight in shining armor. Gilda is resplendent in a gauzy white gown, her hair braided with sprigs of ivy. The Bradbury’s are quickly absorbed into the crowd of Charlie’s faithful subjects, leaving Castiel and Dean in the parking lot.
“Yeah, Cas. I’d like that.”
After a quick warning about Charlie’s competitive nature and Dean assuring Castiel that he could hold his own, they made plans to bus together to the Bradbury’s humble abode.
“Nope,” Dean confirms, popping the end of the word with great satisfaction.
“The invitation is there, if you change your mind,” Castiel offers kindly and turns his chair back to face his computer.
“I’m pretty sure I’m supposed to help him with this exhibit. Gather the masses. He gets shy sometimes and I gotta feeling I can help see him through the next few months,” he reveals and strums the opening chords for
…then again…
At the museum, Castiel badges into the staff entrance at the back and takes the freight elevator to the basement level. He winds his way through the brightly painted hallways to his workspace. The room is large with light blue walls occupied on one side by two large desks and a set of storage drawers, and cabinets on the opposite side.  The center of the room is dominated by a flat work table so large the movers had to bring it in parts through the elevator. There's an oversized crazy quilt laid across the table that Castiel had flagged for restoration. It's a wild mosaic of patchwork pieces held together by hand stitching so even it could pass for machine-made.
“Turkey club or…”
“I was hoping you might be free for lunch? I never see you here on my way home,” he realizes at some point mid-sentence what he’s saying might be misconstrued and finishes in a rush, “and I’d like to speak with you about an exhibit I’m putting together,” he manages. “I’m Castiel Novak.”
“I understand,” Castiel seems to falter a moment as the bus jerks to a stop. “Perhaps next time?” The corners of his mouth tilt up, cautious and hopeful.
“Yeah, we’ve still got a few people to meet with next week.”
“Guitar. It’s kind of a family thing,” he offers. “I gotta lunch thing, but do you play here often? I’d love to hear more of your work.”
Castiel takes his notebook and pen from his back pocket and runs through the same questions he asked Dean. The man himself sets down on the bench, angled to give Castiel and Claire some privacy and goes about playing the song from that morning. Castiel notices Dean’s guitar case is closed and leaning against the bench and the pedestrians that pass the trio drop their bills and change into the ukulele case. They share a smile over Claire’s shoulder and Castiel continues the interview.
When the woman gets closer, he extends a hand to her and gives his most charming smile, “Dean Winchester, miss. This is my partner, Castiel.”
“Uh-huh,” he's still not sure what’s going on between them, but Chuck’s eyes drift down to his throat, his right hand coming away from Dean’s shoulder to root his amulet from beneath his shirt.
“Hey man, I wouldn’t mind helping out with your interviews, if you want to?” Dean seems hesitant with his words, but Castiel warms at the thought of someone to help. “I mean, I’m free most of the day anyway. It really wouldn’t be any trouble.”
The last time he dusted off the OFX Shoebox was Christmas ‘07 when he’d heard a holiday rendition of Zepp’s
"For the girl, dude. Get your head out of the gutter," he mutters taking a drink from Sam's water bottle, which he quickly snatches back and places behind his desk.  Dean distracts himself by unwinding the red wax from around the cheese wheel, popping the entire thing in his mouth at once. Sam snorts at Dean's expense and finishes his veggie stir fry.
“Castiel?” Castiel barely registered that Samandriel was standing there, having come to look for him after he’d stormed off. “You don’t look so good...”
“Jerk,” Sam replied, almost automatically, as if they bickered like this everyday. He hung up Castiel’s trenchcoat and ushered them both into the living room.
He stomped down the stairs and crossed his arms, looking expectantly at Castiel. Castiel cleared his throat nervously. “If it makes you feel any better, Dean, I’ve never read a single one of your books.”
So much for doing nothing.
Sam got a funny look on his face, like he was trying to stifle a laugh. “Yeah, uh. About that. Here’s the thing...that potion? The reason we couldn’t find it in the book is because we were looking in the wrong chapter. It wasn’t a love potion.”
“You’re tellin’ me you came here with nothing but the clothes on your back?”
He did, however, ask Gabriel why he had a strange marking on his arm. Gabriel didn’t quite know how to explain it without giving away that Castiel was human. Of course he planned to tell him
“Exactly.” Sam frowned at the doorway thoughtfully. “Dean doesn’t exactly have the best track record with marks,” he added, quieter.
Dean ambled into the kitchen around 10 AM, ready to make himself some coffee and bacon as per usual, but found his breakfast already waiting for him.
“So...like alcohol but with none of the liver damage.”
“Uhhhhh...powdered
“Basically.” Sam grinned at Dean, waiting for it to sink in.
“Who-who is he?” Castiel stammered.
“And just where do you think you’re going? We have much to discuss, Dean.”
“Ah! Dean, please!”
“I...guess?”
A wide-eyed and rather lost feeling Castiel wandered the aisles, staring at the wide array of guitars they had. He hadn’t a clue where to start. He had a basic idea of a guitar in his mind, with six strings and a long neck and frets...they were called frets, right? The sections on the neck? Or were those the things you used to tune the guitar?
Nothing remotely interesting. Don’t go outside, don’t answer the phone, don’t read your mail—don’t brush your teeth.”
Sam rolled his eyes. “That’s such bull, Dean.”
“That’s part of it. But mostly because of Lisa and Benny.”
Guys, guys! Guess what?!
“There...appears to be a voice in my head, that only I can hear.”
“Well I, no, okay, I’m not explaining it well. I was thinking about how, all those years ago, we met, and I
Cas opened his eyes, and Dean could see him doing the mental calculations. He really was cute when he was thinking. Finally, Cas slowly turned his head back toward him. “Dean?” he whispered, as if unable to believe it was true.
As everyone got ready to turn in, Castiel climbed up the stairs to the modest loft area upstairs. It had a low, sloped ceiling, with a home office area on one side, and the aforementioned beds on the other. There were a couple of closets and a door leading to a bathroom, which Dean was just now coming out of. He jumped in surprise at the sight of Castiel and put a hand to his heart. “Dammit, Cas, you scared me,” he grumbled.
“You’re very kind, Sam. You must be on Santa’s Nice List.”
was the one with someone’s fist inside his guts.
“You know what you’re giving up, don’t you?” Santa said warningly. “Many angels would do anything to be where you are. Are you absolutely sure about this?”
perfect. I have a bad temper and I’m suspicious and defensive...you know that firsthand. Believe me, I’m not some benchmark for goodness.”
Cas smiled sweetly. “Unnecessary. You’re more than enough, Dean.”
my life because I used to be this fuddy duddy with no friends and no life outside of work. And I wished you liked me, even a little bit, because if you did then maybe it would mean that I’m actually
They sat up all night, Castiel’s eyes glued to the pages while Dean stubbornly refused to so much as peek, face buried in Cas’s shoulder and his arms clinging to his waist. By the time the sun had risen and Castiel’s eyes were scanning over the final line, Dean had fallen fast asleep against Cas’s shoulder.
“I think that’s beautiful. Your love is strong because you forged it yourself.”
As they were washing the dishes together, Dean suddenly said, “Hey, uh...what would you say to meeting my family?”
Cas kissed his shoulders and the nape of his neck. “Love this so much...love you...”
“No, no, it’s okay. Uh...my soulmate died, actually.”
Castiel's gaze turned soft and he smiled at Dean. “I love you,” he said plainly. “I just
“Yes, my Righteous Man, come for me. I’m about to come too, can you feel it? Touch me, make me come with you.”
“And for the record, I hate Trump,” Castiel muttered, making the mechanic laugh softly.
The Empty sarcastically clapped. “Oh, well done, very clever. I see you didn’t forget me so soon.”
Dean’s mouth fell open in shock, giving Castiel the opportunity to lean in and kiss him deeply, possessively plundering Dean’s mouth with his tongue. The angel’s lips, his breath, seemed to crackle with electricity, some kind of holy energy that emanated from his very being. Dean was too shocked to do anything but kiss back. He let out an involuntary moan and his eyes fluttered closed as the angel made all the fight in him fly away.
Charlie put him through answering a line of banal and confusing questions. “Do you own any old weapons or artifacts of great importance? Or been left a mysterious box by a deceased relative?” she asked.
...the Empty could devour you too,” he whispered.
Cas laid it aside and picked up the next one. “
. Already knowing that you’re going to die is torture. Waiting for that hammer to fall and having the knowledge to prevent it and not being able to do anything about it...it would kill
After that exchange, Cas drifted back to sleep, feeling as though he’d been hit by a bus...and he had. When he awoke a few hours later, his gaze was met with tired green eyes staring at him.
“I’m...fine...” said Castiel faintly. “Just need to...close my eyes for a moment.”
“I spent last night in a hotel. The insurance company is paying for the repairs but that could be weeks from now. I have nowhere to stay.”
Cas looked up at the sound of Dean’s voice, squeezing the pearl in his hand. Sam quickly explained the Baozhu to his brother, who blinked in surprise. “You’re kiddin’ me. Michael outta my friggin’ head?”
“Cas, some mystery potion just spilled all over you and now you’re acting...weird,” Dean said, blushing.
“You know, you actually are a pretty funny little guy, you know that?”
The foreman blinked. “Four-oh-
Cas stepped away, panting. “No. Don’t...wanna finish yet,” he said breathily, and Dean saw that when he was close to coming, there was a blush on his chest as well as his face and ears. Huh.
“Because I’m dying and I can’t just die on him and leave him to mourn for me! I can’t stand the thought of hurting him.”
Cas lit up like a Christmas tree. “Dean, I love you too!”
After sharing a hot morning shower, Castiel tore himself away from Dean’s grabby arms and persistent kisses, to make a trip uptown—to Chuck’s house. Manuscript in hand, he knocked on the door. His knuckles just barely brushed the wood when Becky opened the door.
“But you are welcome here anytime, Castiel,” Amelia said. “You’re the only family James has besides Claire and me, now that his adoptive parents are gone. Please say you’ll come back.”
only causes problems for the rest of us?”
“I convinced Sam to take Mary into town to see a movie. I wanted it to just be the four of us tonight.” Cas smiled faintly.
Cas slowly smiled. “You make it sound so simple.”
Dean shook his head violently, trying to swallow, but Cas was off like a shot, calmly listing every single one of Dean’s positive traits, everything to “his bravery” to “the shape and fullness of his taut buttocks”. Dean wanted to sink into the floor.
“Dean, have you written even a
“Not the
“Oh. Well, still the wrong color.”
Cas blinked in surprise. “
“Let’s fuck when we get home!” Dean exclaimed.
“Kay. Be right back, I promise.”
Those wingless shoulders slumped. “Gabriel says I’m...a late bloomer.”
Dean snorted, nudging Cas’s thigh with his knee. “I was into you, even back then. I didn’t want to admit it, being as you were such a prick back then and all, but man I also kinda wanted you to just bend me over a table and go to town.”
Suddenly, his phone rang, scaring Cas half to death. (Was that how Chuck was going to kill him? A heart attack?)
“You are...Dean Winchester?” Castiel said hopefully.
Cas to-
“Yeah,” Castiel said, feeling himself sink further and further into the beanbag, like quicksand.
“His parents named him Castiel...” Gabriel chuckled. “Kinda sounds angelic, huh?”
Cas took his hands and graciously kissed his knuckles. “Your body is beautiful,” he said, knowing Dean well enough to know what he was thinking even without angel mojo as a cheat sheet. “I am quite honored to wear it, if only for one day. You have a handsome face, strong arms, gorgeous muscular legs, and yes, even your stomach is admirable.”
a stalker,” Dean grunted as a hot, wet tongue suddenly swept over his hole. He yelped in surprise.
Castiel sealed his lips shut to muffle a desperate whine from escaping.
Cas couldn’t help but smirk at that.
Dean groaned into the kiss, his palm cupping Cas’s permanently stubbly cheek. Dude really knew how to kiss for a guy who was so inexperienced—
“Aww, you didn’t have to do that,” Dean said, taking it and gazing it at fondly. Then he looked up. “Wait. I thought gifts were
“You and I and our two wonderful children,” Cas whispered. “And Sam and Mary...it really is perfect, isn’t it?”
“You’ll go to work in the toy shop,” Raphael said, writing something down on her papers. “They always need more hands, especially with how greedy kids are getting these days.
raised by Christmas angels,” Castiel insisted, signing as he spoke.
“Oh no...thank you.” Rowena smiled a little
Cas rolled his eyes. “Good riddance to that damn watch. I’m sick of running my life on that thing’s schedule.”
While Dean was cooking lunch in the kitchen, Sam and Cas were going through the artifacts from the pawn shop. They’d been at it for almost half an hour when Cas happened upon a small, black satin, drawstring bag. He gingerly opened it and a small white stone fell into the palm of his hand. “Sam. I think I’ve found it.”
“Oh yes. He once tried to teach me some of it, but I didn’t retain any. I think the phrase he tried to teach me was...‘you breed with the mouth of a goat.’”
” smirk on his own face and his (Cas’s) stomach flipped. Man, if he didn’t know that his fella was an angel, he’d swear the guy was an incubus or something. The guy was so inexplicably
“It’s a special marking that means that someday,” Gabriel explained, “you’re gonna meet someone very special. Someone who’s gonna be like a best friend to you, and even more.”
Dean closed his eyes, opened his mouth, and leaned forward.
Castiel smiled. “I hope we’ll be as happy as you and your soulmate are.”
“Real whiz kid, this one,” Dean grumbled.
Dean returned with a glass of water. “Here, drink this. Sorry, not really sure what to do. Never had someone faint on me before.”
“He just wrote a series of genre novels back in the day. He was totally ripping off
Dean whirled around, cheeks stuffed with pancakes to see Rowena in one of her usual outlandish and extravagant outfits leaning against the doorframe. “Wuhweewuh,” Dean gargled around his mouthful.
Sam snickered. “Gotta admit, I could get used to Flirty Cas. Sure you don’t wanna keep him, Dean?”
“That really depends on what you wanna say with your instrument,” Claire said. She picked up a bright red one with floral country decals painted on it. “For instance, this one says, ‘When I get back to Georgia, that woman gonna feel my pain.’”
Being inside Dean was too good. He was so tight, so hot inside. “Give it to me, hard,” Dean grunted.
”Sure you won’t get sick of me?” Cas half-teased, half-asked seriously.
“And you think that’s what you would have gotten,” Cas said. “You don’t think you’d have accidentally manifested something...self-indulgent?”
Castiel closed his eyes. Not
You knew you were gonna die for
gasped Castiel, hurriedly pulling the soaking wet clothing away from his skin.
Sam and Cas watched and waited for a full, tense minute. Finally Dean opened one green eye at them. “Nothing,” he said, his voice dropping.
Dean laughed breathlessly. “You’re unbelievable. You’re over here going through hell and you wanna tell me how to fix my finances. If I wasn’t crazy about you before, I would definitely be falling for you now.”
“My name is Castiel. I’m an angel of the Lord.”
Cas felt like the breath had been knocked out of him. Never in his wildest
meant to be with. Some people only put value on a relationship if it’s a soulmate relationship. Dean was crushed. The irony is, Lisa and Neal’s marriage only lasted a year and a half. They were miserable with each other. Serves her right.”
Cas rolled his eyes as he got up to leave. “Coward. Beautiful, but a coward.”
“But this isn’t like that,” Castiel said. “I’m not dissociating. I’m fully present in the moment, it’s just that there’s a voice that only I can hear. And he seems to know things that I don’t. He’s not telling me to do anything, he’s just...narrating my life as it happens.”
Charlie stood up straight as she read the address, like she’d been zapped with electricity. “Holy shit, then what are we doing here stuffing our faces with ice cream?! Let’s go get this son of a bitch to change his story!”
“But I’m...
“And if you apologize one more time, I’m gonna smack you.” Dean’s little smirk told Castiel he wasn’t serious.
Castiel realized she must’ve been talking to Michael about
“Ah, no, sweetheart. Under my roof you let me hear all those pretty sounds.” Dean pulled Cas’s underwear down and licked the sensitive underside of his cock.
Lunch time rolled around and Castiel ate his peanut butter and jelly sandwich he’d brought from home. He idly looked through the office window and saw Dean eating a large meatball sub and chatting with a very tall, handsome man with long brown hair. Dean punched him on the arm in a friendly fashion and said something that made the man laugh. They seemed close.
. After all this time, he still couldn’t wrap his mind around it—how could he matter so much to a being so much greater than himself?
Dean stabbed a vamp with a silver stake, turning him to dust, then suddenly felt strong cold hands on his shoulders and hot breath on his neck. But before the vampire could sink her fangs in, she shrieked as Castiel staked from her behind. “Thanks,” Dean said, whirling around.
Crowley’s visage dissolved into black goo and melted into the ground. Cas let out a shuddering breath, back slamming against the side of the building for support. He remained that way for a good, long while as he fought back tears.
me,” Dean repeated.
Until, today.
Sam’s face twisted with surprise. “Oh...Eileen’s not my soulmate.”
Cas swallowed. “Okay,” he squeaked.
what love is.”
Christmas spirit certainly didn’t seem to be in low supply in the Novak household however. The front hall and the living room beyond were decorated with lights and tinsel and holiday baubles of all kinds. On nearly every flat surface there was a Santa figurine, all with the bushy white beard and the bowl-full-of-jelly stomach (inaccurate, of course, but nonetheless festive). In the corner there was a beautiful Christmas tree all lit up, and the air wafting in from the kitchen was carrying the familiar flavor of gingerbread. Except for the lack of wings, it felt just like home. Castiel smiled.
“Yeah, was trying to appeal to boys and their dads with that one. Some of my best memories were when Dad would take me and Sammy on road trips.” Dean suddenly frowned at the floor. “Didn’t happen that often, though.”
So, when they arrived at the bunker and Cas didn't answer to the brothers' calls, it wasn't a surprise that Dean panicked and stormed off. He needed to find the angel and prayed to whoever was listening that he wasn't too late. Sam yelled something about 'everything will be fine' and that he's sure 'nothing bad happened while they were gone'. If Dean wasn't so freaked out he would have punched his brother.
"We're sorry, but we only have single rooms left where we can let you stay."
(See the end of the chapter for
After spending the afternoon in two restaurants and making sure that Dean had taken care of Sam, they drove to a place that Cas wanted to show Dean. It was beginning to get dark. Dean, rather unusual for him, sat on the passenger side and looked at the landscape. With the sky darkened, the stars came out.
He put the needle on and went back to Dean. He pulled Dean a little bit away from the shelf and took him back into his arms. Again, Dean responded. He put his arms around Cas's hips again while Cas wrapped his arms around Dean's neck. The music began.
He and Cas had once, when they had made up a case to get time alone, made a movie night. They'd spent a few days in a motel a few states away from the bunker and had rented some of the greatest love stories in history.
When he looked at it again, he was even more surprised. Sam and Dean were on television. In fact, they were in a comic. And more specifically, they were in Scooby - Doo. Cas swallowed.
"You weren't listening." Dean sounded slightly irritated. "For weeks you've been telling me you wanted to spend time with me again. Now I'm here and you're ignoring me."
They had never made their relationship public, and they always met in secret. While they had been in Purgatory for the first time, they had confessed their feelings and had also realized how stupid they had been to let so much time pass by. But it didn't matter now. They had each other through thick and thin and that was the most important thing.
Dean opened his eyes. He realized that Cas was watching him. He had been so preoccupied, he didn't notice Cas had pulled away.
"Yes." Then he kissed Dean. They both sighed softly. When they broke away from each other again, Castiel looked at Dean seriously.
„Black as your wings and blue as your grace“, mumbled Dean and gave Cas a short but very clear kiss.
"Well, that was the plan, no one was supposed to know. "
"I moved our vacation so we can go later. I really want to make this better between us," Dean said a little more calmly now.
"Stop it, Inias. Please." Castiel interrupted him.
"Cas?", he asked in shock. He couldn't remember that he heard Cas behind him. "Believe me, I'm freak and thrilled you're here but we could get in really-"
"You didn't?!" Castiel was shocked. All eyes were on him. Gabriel put his hand on his shoulder, but Castiel shook it off. He didn't feel like joking anymore.
With Dean at his side he could feel complete again.
Jack swallowed and was about to burst into tears himself. This song reflected complete despair. He wanted to go to Sam and tell him that he wasn't alone.
Dean took a piece and made an enthusiastic sound.
"For saving me from losing you a second time." Castiel had answered quietly and was now looking back at Dean. Dean stroked Castiel's hair out of his forehead, watching his hand do so. He brought that hand to Castiel's cheek and gave him a light kiss in the corner of his mouth. Then he let go of him, took Castiel's hand and squeezed it.
Cas had told him that he could take a few days of and would like to come and visit Dean, even when it has to be in private. Dean had been so exited that Cas had to laugh because he feared his mobile would start to burn with how much Dean beamed. They decided that Cas should come to London and meet with Dean there. Dean would arrive there tomorrow and after the show he would have a week off before he would fly to Spain.
The tape clicked, it was over. "Farewell, Cas!" Dean muttered, which sounded more like gargling.
"No, Dean. Not yet, just relax." The slow torture continued but then Castiel added the third finger. Dean groaned.
"It's going to be okay!" promised Castiel. What had happened, he would ask him later.
The evening before his birthday, he arrived at his family's house. Oh, what a surprise it was. Everyone was really happy that he had come by.
The angel had stopped crying but his face seemed restless. Dean strocked his cheek. Slowly. And Cas leaned into the touch. They hadn't done this for a while now. Stolen kisses, desperate touches and secret make out sessions, oblivious to the world outside of their own, were a quiet routine for them. But since the big reveal nothing had happened between them. The last time was months ago.
"So tell me something. Like you used to. That always helped, didn't it!" And Castiel began.
Dean's note had been on the coffee table since he had arrived back home. Castiel wanted to call him, but he didn't know if it might be too soon. They had just seen each other again today. And even though it was the best birthday he'd had in years, it felt to Castiel like he was crossing a line if he called Dean now.
"I'm really sorry, Cas," Dean affirmed softly, his voice shaky. "I really missed you." Castiel cleared his throat, then replied just as quietly.
"Mmm, Dean, that doesn't look very much like anxiety." He stroked up and down once with the tip of his index finger and then hooked his fingers in the cuff. Dean's belly twitched. Cas pulled his shorts down and Dean's erection was exposed. Cas ran his tongue over his lips and looked at the younger one as he did so.
"Dean, it's been-"
"There are so many..." Dean muttered.
Dean, who had sat diagonally behind Cas in one of the chairs, had smiled and a warm wave of affection and love had rolled through him. An idea had been born in him.
"Come," he said softly, and they got out.
How alone he had felt....
Dean stood up as well, his appetite gone. He took a beer from the fridge and sat down in front of the TV. Castiel's behavior was on his mind.
"Hey, Cas, what-"
"Yeah right, blame it all on me. It's not like you make mistakes."
Sam and Eileen looked at each other smiling, then they turned back to Jack.
"It tastes delicious."
"Well, actually, I'd quite like to sit this one out." Inias spoke very softly, he was still shy, but Gabriel had heard him. Some of the others as well and they started laughing. Now Castiel, who had momentarily disappeared into a daydream, looked up as well. He looked first at his big brother and then at his little brother, but could see nothing wrong.
Meanwhile Cas had managed to free himself from the hug and had turned to Dean. He put his arms around Dean's neck and pulled the older Winchester towards him. Dean let it happen wordlessly and started to turn in circles with Cas, slowly swaying to the music. They both closed their eyes.
He went to the door, but he wasn't really expecting anyone. It was 2 p.m. on a Sunday. He opened and almost fell over backwards. He hadn't expected to see Dean. They eyed each other slightly uncertainly, then laughed and Dean shrugged.
Dean whined when Cas let go. Cas removed Dean's trousers and Dean was very happy when he was kissed again. These kisses were full of desparation and both of their tongues were playing this sinful game. They let go of each other as Cas fumbled with his belt and fly but after a few seconds he had freed his own cock. He gripped both of them and Dean groaned at the contact. He was already close and so he closed his eyes. Cas cought his mouth again but slowed down the hand and kiss. It lost the urgency but was replaced with passion. Cas thrusted his hips forward afterremoving his hand. Dean held on to his shoulders and moaned into Cas's mouth. He thrusted his hips up in rythm and their cocks slided together, breaths hot between them. Cas let go of Dean's mouth and went down to his crotch once more.
"Oh, right." They both laughed briefly, and Castiel shook his head at himself.
When Dean woke up the next morning, Cas was not with him. If they were alone, so if Sam or Jack or whoever wasn't there, they spent the morning together in bed.
"Your address? Please?"
She introduced herself to Jack who was sitting in the library and then went to Sam. On the way to his room, she noticed a bouquet of flowers in a corner that had dried up but still looked fresh.
Before they got to the bunker, Sam drove to the police station to pick up the small box with Dean's personal things in it. Without comment, Sam put the box in the back seat. Then they drove on and a little later they reached the bunker.

"Dean, please?!" Cas begged quietly.
Dean ran to his own room, pushed the door open and stopped in the frame.
Dean was on tour again. This time it was a big tour, nearly a world tour. On this tour he only had his brother and manager Sam with him. His boyfriend Castiel stayed in America. Sam was an absolutely fan of the relationship between Dean and Cas but they all decided to keep it a secret to not scare the fans away, so the record laber said it.
So now they were driving in the car and Dean had just changed the cassette and started it now. He had also put it together especially for his project. Now, when the music started and when
The first song was 'Right Here Waiting' by Richard Marx. Dean looked a little surprised in the direction of the cassette but decided to let it go. Songs 2 to 4 were 'It Must Have Been Love' by Roxette, 'Nothings Gonna Change My Love' by Glenn Medeiros and 'Power of Love' by Frankie goes to Hollywood.
" He paused a little while.
Sam no longer looked as if he wanted to be where his brother was.
There was Cas.. In his bed.. And it looked like he was sleeping. Dean closed the door and moved forward. He could see that Cas was crying. Silent tears were running down his face. Dean would've never imagined that he could even feel more heartbroken than he already did.
"Since December of last year." Castiel's answer was very quiet.
"Dean, it-," Castiel began.
"I want you," Dean began again, speaking slowly, "to leave the apartment and not come back until I'm gone." He didn't turn around, but at some point he heard footsteps moving away, and a moment later the apartment door slammed shut.
You were the first person I had such strong feelings for. I wasn't used to it, I still am. Sometimes I'm really scared that one day you'll get tired and leave. Because I still can't understand what keeps you here with me and what I have earned you with. What do I have that you can possibly need?!“
"Dude, what was that about?" cursed Dean, shoving Castiel. He lashed out again, but this time Dean intercepted the fist first. Now, as Castiel raised his other arm to hurt Dean elsewhere, Dean enclosed him in his arms.
Here Cas broke off in a tearful voice, waited briefly, cleared his throat and then continued speaking in a husky voice.
During that time, and the weeks that followed, Sam got worse and worse. They had been able to bury Dean and he was now resting next to Mary. Jack had suggested this and Sam hadn't objected. He hoped that Dean was in heaven, in his own and with everything that made him happy.
Dean gets a gift, but it all ends up different than he thought...
"Is this what you wished for?" He began to move the fingers already scissoring them. Dean panted and curled in himself a bit.
In January, things got so tense between them that Dean moved out briefly to live with his brother.
"Your brother, huh?" Dean's voice was icy.
"Yeah?!"
"Yeah?"
"Yeah, Cas, say hello to you. It's been a while, after all."
He'd been driving for a while on Highway 281, and he remembered he had Cas' tape. He pulled it out of his pocket, took the cover off and put it in.
Now he put the glass on his nightstand, put on his pajamas, crawled into bed and sat against the headboard. Then he drank a few sips, leaned his head back and closed his eyes. Wonder what Dean was doing right now?
He pressed Cas against the wall and pressed their lips together before the other could say anything. Cas, very surprised by this outburst, but no less enthusiastic, replied. Whatever made Dean do it, he was on board.
It was half past four in the morning when he was handed the key to his room. He put down his suitcase and lay down on the bed, totally exhausted as he was. Within seconds he was asleep.
"It doesn't matter. I will be careful." He bent down and bit Dean's lower lip slightly. Meanwhile, his right hand moved down and undid the trousers. He pushed them down as far as he could and now the bulge was clearly visible in Dean's boxer shorts. Grinning, Cas looked up.
"May 20th is the 'World Bee Day'. Bees are an endangered species and the human race has to care for them, much more than they do it nowadays."
Two days later Sam was sitting at the kitchen table when Jack came into the kitchen in the morning. Sam looked up, got up and went to Jack. Without a word he took the boy in his arms, squeezed him tight and then left the kitchen.
"Say hello to Sam for me."
An hour later, Castiel went to his bedroom. He was slightly annoyed.
This is where Cas interrupted him. He threw himself into Dean's arms and pressed their lips together. Dean must have been surprised, because he could barely keep his balance.
Dean carefully pulled out the headphones out of Cas‘ ears. He also took the phone and put it on his nightstand. Cas didn't made a sound. He only moved closer to Dean than he already had.
"Dean, I..." Cas looked at Dean, tears streaming down his face. "I..."
"Thanks."
"Inias, that's not how the game goes. Truth or dare?"
On the way to his bed he put down his duffle bag. Then he sat down on the matress. Cas hadn't heard him approching so he opened his eyes a little startled.
„Ok“, Cas said after a short moment of consideration and kissed Dean again.
„Hmm, okay. But why?“ Cas asked, a little sleepy.
Dean closed his eyes briefly, then opened them again.
„Dean-“, Cas started to say, but Dean interrupted him.
"Cas, this is fantastic. Just heavenly." Castiel grinned.
Sam had been told over the phone what had happened.
Claire and Jack, their two children, would spend their day with Uncle Sam and Aunt Eileen today. Because Dean and Castiel had a date. Even though they had been together for years now, it was an unwritten law for them to spend time alone together for once. A romantic dinner, a little one-day getaway, a day on the couch or a picnic. And that was exactly what they had planned today.
Cas dropped down on his elbows, leaning in for a kiss. Slow and gentle. He could feel Dean shiver beneath him.
His name was Sam, as Gabriel mentioned. Sam was a quiet man who tended to stay in the background. He was by no means unfriendly and as Castiel could tell during the evening, the alcohol lightened his mood. He laughed and joked and was actually always to be found near Gabriel, as Castiel noticed at some point.
Dean throw himself at Cas who tipped over and pulled Dean with him. Their were laughing and rolled from one side to the other on the bed for a while. When they stopped Cas lay above Dean and smiled. Dean pecked his lips again.
~ It is possible to get from Lawrence, Kansas to Lafayette, Louisiana within one day (or the other way around)
"What?" shouted Dean. "It's not what it looks like? Screw you, Castiel!" Dean slammed the door and stormed to his car. By the time he got to his brother's house, it would be late at night, but Sam didn't mind. They'd been able to rely on each other since they were little.
"Hey," Dean said softly and began stroking Castiel's back. Castiel, meanwhile, was holding onto Dean's jacket desperately, his face pressed against Dean's shoulder. Dean rested his head against Castiel's and rocked them both back and forth gently.
Dean must have made a sound because Cas woke up, turned on the light on the nightstand and looked at Dean. He saw that Dean was listening to music. Cas put his hand on Dean's cheek and wiped away the tears.
"Is Dean the young man where you wouldn't say the name?"
At midnight they were all not sober anymore and after congratulating and singing loudly, they decided to play 'Truth or Dare'. The first round could still be called harmless, but after Naomi and Chuck said goodbye.... Well, we all know what happens when parents back off and leave their actually adult children alone.
How much he liked his work, despite all his efforts....
The boy didn't pay any attention to them and disappeared into a cabin. Immediately Cas was with Dean, stood behind him and wrapped his arms around Dean's middle. They didn't have much time and so Cas whispered in Dean's ear only a 'Wait for me after school, at the exit by the gym'. Then he turned Dean's head in his direction, gave him a short and firm kiss and disappeared. Dean tried to calm himself down with cold water, but it only half worked.
He left the washroom and went back to class. The teacher looked at him briefly, but said nothing. For the last few minutes, Dean was no longer present. He immediately had a free hour, which he would spend in the library, since Cas still had lessons. But after that...
Dean told him about the last case he'd handled, and Cas listened. When Dean was done, he felt like he'd been there with him. "This will be our last case," he thought and swallowed. He had a big lump in his throat.
"Mom, Dad, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you guys up. And yes, I'm going to go. I shouldn't have come here in the first place. But Gabriel can tell you everything else later. He's in a chatty mood."
So when Cas lost his power and his wings it was Dean who saved him, like Cas did it so many years ago. Not in the same way like Cas but in a similar one.
-The End-
"Sam? Dean?" No answer. "Weird..", he thought and went downstairs. "Well, where Dean's gonna be is easy." Cas went down the hall to the movie room. Dean affectionately reffered to it as 'Dean cave'. Cas entered.
He had spent the whole day preparing the food. Sure, he could have ordered the burgers, but he wanted to make something special with the food. He had prepared everything himself. The bowls and the plates with toppings were waiting on the kitchen table while the meatballs were kept warm in the oven.
Another hour later, Dean was so tired he had almost fallen asleep twice already. He would not sleep in their shared bed tonight, so he decided to go to the bathroom only briefly. On his way there, he had to walk all the way down the hall. Here he stopped.
Dean began to shiver. "Please, Cas" he whispered against Castiel's mouth. "I need more."
It was 7pm.
"No, he doesn't. He'll get a surprise when I tell him as soon as we're in London but I know he won't destroy the wedding. How about you? Do you have a best man? Could maybe Gabriel come here by then?"
"What are you saying?! Did you hear yourself?" Dean said a lot louder than before. "How could you think something like that? You're worthy so much, you mean everything to me. You're my best friend, my lover - you're my other half. Don't you ever again think so less of you!" Dean sobbed.
It had been a few weeks now since he and Cas had made a small and very relaxed movie night. Dean was a romantic in his heart. He had just never learned to show those kind of feelings. His mother had loved him, his father had loved him, albeit in a twisted way. But when his mother died, emotions were no longer valued. He had to be functioning, he had to help and obey his father and above all he had to take care of Sam. Dean had never learned to love anyone in a romantic way. Sure, he loved his brother, but not in the way he loved Cas. He had been completely overwhelmed at the beginning and he would never forget Lisa either, but with Cas it was something different. There was a much more profound bond between them.
Cas couldn't understand it at first but after a whole day with a lot of thinking he got it. Dean couldn't look at him anymore, so he thought.
The music began and Cas smiled.
"Traitor." That's all Castiel said. He left the living room and went to his room. The others watched him silently.
"Oh man, now don't act like that." Gabriel laughed and turned back to Castiel. "Sooner or later-" But that was as far as he got, because Castiel lashed out and struck. Gabriel's head shot back and he went down.
"No,no,no!", he thought and ran to Cas room. But his friend wasn't there either. Now his thoughts were expolding. Where could he be...
"Cas, look at me. Please." Castiel glanced at Dean. "It's over, okay? Talk to me. Tell me everything. Laugh, cry, yell at me, but please talk to me."
The ring was made of black metal, parted in the middle by a blue line. This blue line, which looked like a river, glowed in the candlelight.
It was still two days until his birthday, but Castiel wasn't looking forward to it at all. Nevertheless, he thought about it.
„Well, they're singing ‚I had the time of my life‘, but our time is just beginning!“
"This-" Dean gasped with pleasure. Castiel's hands were on his ass and the squeeze pulled their hips harder together. Their mouths met and again it was slow but passionate. Dean knew that this was Castiel's favourite kind of making love. He chuckled and Castiel turned them around so that he was on top now.
A few minutes later, the black Chevrolet was heard driving away. Dean was gone, the apartment key he had slipped under the door from the outside.
It had probably taken him longer than the times before, because when he turned around now, Dean was standing right in front of him.
"Cas, what's wrong?" Cas was shaken lightly by Dean. "You cry! Why are you crying?"
"Yes, Dean, Louisiana."
"Yes, I'm still here. I'm sorry about Dean. I really liked him." Mildred cleared her throat. "And as for the huntress... her name is Eileen Leahy. She taught me sign language back then so I could talk to my daughter. Is there anything else you need?"
"Yes, Dean, I will marry you but did you think I came with empty hands? Of course not. I planned to ask you as well." Now Cas opened the box in his hand and Dean could see a dark brown wooden ring, parted by a single green line. Dean's mouth opened in awe.
December went normally.
The fact that Dean was standing in front of the motel door could only be a bad dream. Someone wanted to play a trick on him. He shook his head and slammed the door. But the knocking started again. Castiel took a deep breath, then opened the door a second time. It was not a dream. Dean was actually standing in front of the door. They looked at each other.
Thanks for reading it.
"You won't hurt me, buddy, please...", he whined. He tried to put his knees around Cas's hips to pull him towards himself. And Cas? Cas removed his trousers, then he leaned in and lined up. Dean closed his eyes, his heart reacing when he felt Cas's teasing.
Around ten o'clock, Castiel ducked outside. He was not annoyed, as he had first feared, but after so many years to see his entire family again, which had apparently not changed a bit, drained him. He was no longer used to so much company.
'. So he turned around and-
"Yes. I know how much you love it. The apples are from our garden. Jack helped me pick them up." Dean stroked Castiel's eyebrow with his thumb, then put his hand to his cheek.
Jack found this flyer in a small wooden box under Sam's bed, took it, put the box back and left the room. He would call there tomorrow, maybe they could help him.
"I wanted to ask where and when we gonna get married. Do you have an idea for that?"
Cas cried too. Silent tears ran down his face.
At some point, Cas stopped. They got out, and Dean let Cas guide him. After a short walk, they came to a clearing. It was already dark, but it looked even darker out here.
But he couldn't concentrate on watching TV even half an hour later. He decided to let it go for the day. He got up, turned off the TV, and went to the kitchen. His mother had used to make him warm milk with honey when he was a little boy and not quiet. He had always fallen asleep after it. Why it came to him just now, he didn't know, but he would just try it.
The letter was directed to a Cas and the Dean who had apparently written the letter mentioned in him of a very intense bonding. Gabriel had assured him that no one else in the family had read it because he knew what would have happened if they had. The Novak family was very religious and men who loved men did not fit in.
"I could never have told Gabe all that. That's why I was so happy when you showed up. I was hoping, at the risk of sounding childish now, that you would give me a hug and tell me everything was going to be okay. Like you used to. When you actually said that yesterday, I was about to burst." Inias looked at Castiel. "I really missed you, Cas!" said Inias softly.
Dean and Sam sat at the bar of the hotel they were acommodated. Deans' bodyguards were with them to handle super fans if there would be any. But this evening only an old man was sitting at the bar too. It seemed that he didn't know who was sitting with him and the brothers were practically on their own. They talked about random things in a low voice so the man wouldn't get disturbed.
Sam, as the good friend he was, promised to make a video call with Cas for the show in Edinburgh today because Dean said he would sing a song only for Cas this night. Everytime Cas could be away from work, when Dean gave a concert, Sam and him video called so Cas could be with them.
He told from the beginning.
Seeing the brothers there made him very sad. Even if it might have been a case, but Dean had promised him that he would only take Cas with him if he ever got the chance to enter the world of Scooby - Doo. Okay, maybe they hadn't had time to wait for him but they could've sent him a message or a 'prayer'. But no, nothing.
Arriving at their still shared apartment, Dean got out of the car in a reasonably good mood. He was also a bit nervous, but wanted to give Castiel the opportunity for an explanation. It was a pleasant spring day, not yet particularly warm, but nature was blooming. Secretly, Dean loved this time of year and that's why he started whistling softly now. On second thought, he was even ready to forgive Castiel.
"Well, I asked you, what was it like here? How are Sam and Jack?"

"Did I miss anything?"
"I know it's a big question but I love you and although I can't wear the ring in public for now, I can wear it on a necklace right over my heart, now and forever. So Cas, will you marry me?"
"It was the promise that I made to D-," Castiel had had to swallow, "that I made to Dean."
Cas and Dean put the bowls and plates together and brought it all into the kitchen. They didn't wash it off, though. They went back to the library.
honey-bee, I will take good care of you too, much more than I've done so far!"
Cas laughed briefly. It was not a happy laugh.
How he had received the picture of little Jonny....
"Gabe, I-" Castiel sighed, "I'll think about it, okay?"
"Dean-"
"I..." Kiss. "Love..." Kiss. "You!" Cas giggled and Dean pulled him even closer. Cas raised his head and looked at Dean.
He took a quick look in the rearview mirror, backed out, and drove off. As he pulled out of the parking lot and onto the highway, he laughed. He didn't want the rearview mirror. Dean and him, even if everything wasn't settled yet, would be looking forward together again from now on.
"Now let's have some food, shall we? I'll get the things and you go sit down."
"I'm sitting at work, staring at your picture, feverishly thinking about what I can change so we can have more time together again. But since I'm the only one bringing home money around here, I can't make a part-time job out of my work."
It was the evening of his birthday and Castiel was sitting on the couch at home. The TV was on, but he hardly looked at it. He was thinking.
What can you offer, you ask?! You are the kindest, most loving person of all. You help everyone who means something to you or those who need help; you are there for them. You have the habit of doing everything from the right motives, even if the actions slip into the wrong direction. You have the purest and brightest soul among all earthly beings and you try to get up again immediately every time you fall.
"Sam and Gabriel had a fight. The others are still there, too, speculating with whom you-"
The deal says that Cas would be taken when he is truly happy. But Dean had a bad feeling about that. Since when had something actually worked out for them.
Here is the link for the picture
"I missed this too," Dean said but before Castiel could ask what he meant, Dean's lips wrapped around the head of his cock.
He had burned the milk twice, made the honey run out, bumped his head while cleaning, and burned himself several times on the pot. In the end, he had managed to finish a glass of warm milk with honey, but he felt as if he had been standing in the kitchen for the first time ever.
Not five minutes later, Dean's hand, which until then had rested on Castiel's stomach, began to move. Dean let it rest on Castiel's abdomen and Castiel could feel the warmth radiating from it. Very lightly, Dean stroked his finger along the cuff of Castiel's boxers and Castiel moved slightly. Dean laughed softly.
"Well, it has a deeper meaning for me too. Today is the 20th of May right? Do you know the meaning of this day?"
"Oh god," he whispered in horror and ran as fast as he could to the bathroom.
"It will, I promise."
"I'm sorry about that."
The picture hung in his locker, but after a few weeks it had disappeared. Castiel had wondered about that, and not a little, because only he owned the key. Oddly enough, Jonny and his mother had also never come back. What he had experienced at that time now made Castiel decide to dial the number from the note. He somehow already knew it by heart. No matter what time it was or how Dean might react, Castiel had already lost too much.
"Yes you will, come with me and let your family help you. You don't have to tell them the truth. This can stay between us. But it would be a distraction, and besides, you're only going to be 30 once, so come home."
In surprise he stops. On the table was a big TV. It was definitely new. Whenever he and Dean had watched movies, Dean's laptop had been connected to the projector and they had had their private screen.
Dean only looked at Cas in silence.
On the third try, his boss picked up and Dean actually managed to get the week off. In a slightly better mood, he headed home. He firmly believed that it had all been a nasty misunderstanding.
"Yes, thank you, it was perfect", murmured Dean and placed a soft kiss on Cas's temple. "Right here... Under the nightsky."
Dean nods. “I regret what happened to Cas.”
He slams Cas against the door with a growl, pinning the Angel with an arm across the base his throat. “What the hell were you thinking!?” Dean’s voice is low and full of menace, eyes hard and angry. His jaw clenches and muscles twitch as he stares hard into Castiel’s unapologetic eyes.
Cas grunts quietly in protest but doesn’t argue, he simply keeps stroking Dean’s cheek. “I know you struggle sometimes, Dean. You’ve come so far, it’s okay to be unsure.” Cas presses a chaste kiss to his brow and then his cheek before touching their lips together gently. “Talk to me.”
Castiel looks up at Gabe and blinks. “What are you talking about?”
He just hopes he doesn’t end up regretting that decision.
Cas pulls at Dean’s shoulders, urging him to climb over Cas and into a kiss. He can taste himself on Dean’s lips and he chases the bitter saltiness with his tongue. Dean hums and settles into the space between Cas’ legs, his hard dick pressing urgently into Cas’ thigh.
“The mystery man Cassie has been pining over since we first met. Pleased to finally meet you,” Balthazar says with a wolfish grin and Cas
He smiles to himself as he pockets his phone and meanders toward the bedroom to finish getting ready for the day. He needs to start grading his student's papers and if this morning is any indication, getting Dean out the door so they can both work is going to be a constant challenge.
Dean’s cock swells, spasming at the jolt of perfect pain from Castiel’s teeth and his hands fist in the sheet, threatening to shred them to pieces. “Cas!” He sobs, praying with all his might for Castiel not to stop.
The pounding stops the instant his hands touch the door, the locks clicking as he hurries to undo them. “Cas?” He says, blinking in the sunlight as he takes in his neighbor’s disheveled appearance.
Cas hums and his bottomless blue eyes meet Dean’s with a warm smile behind them. He shakes his head minutely and surges up to draw Dean into a messy kiss. “Right now, Dean, I’m just yours. And I want to taste you.”
“Yes,” Cas cuts him off. “Hell, yes.” His hands drift down Dean’s back to cup his ass and haul him forward, pressing their half-hard dicks together. Lightening skitters down his spine and makes his heart race when he takes in Dean’s lust-drunk gaze. “Bedroom?”
to cloud his judgment. His growing fondness for Dean is all well and good in their normal day to day interactions, but the look of concern painted across Dean’s features has the burning prick of tears forming behind his eyes.
These don’t belong here and he glances around with narrowed eyes as if the culprit will suddenly appear.
“Hell yes,” Dean cheers with a wide smile. “I knew I loved you.” He makes an obnoxious kissing noise that draws a laugh out of Castiel.
“Huh?” Dean frowns with furrowed brows.
Cas blinks at his friend’s sudden departure before tearing after him. “Balthazar!” He yells as he slams into the door, knocking dust loose from the frame as he pounds his fist on the cheap wood. “Balthazar!” Castiel’s heart hammers nearly as loudly as his closed fist on the locked door. “Give me my phone, you ass!”
“Just wait a minute for Benny to clear them out. Don’t worry about a thing, no one’s gonna bother you.” Garth continues as his fingers drum on the steering wheel.
“Like
Cas’s smile widens. “Good. Now, dinner?”
Cas hums and nods just as his stomach rumbles. “I think delivery sounds good, I’d like to get settled and I can’t wait to see your house,” he says with a smile but his stomach still flutters nervously.
James waves with a smile and pulls the door closed behind him.
“You hear from Cas lately?” Sam asks with a slight slur to his voice and a lazy grin before he can stop himself. He really is a glutton for punishment.
Cas’ thumb hovers over the button to respond and bites his lip hard enough to remind him of why he had a pencil in his mouth, to begin with. He releases his lip and straightens his spine as he sets his phone aside as butterflies swarm in his stomach.
Dean sighs and shakes his head, pushing the skin closer to Cas and giving it a shake to show how full it is. “Drink,” He says again, his tone softening to lure Castiel into some sense of security.
They’re surrounded.
He glances at Cas only to see him staring out the window absently.
“I thought he was into it. He kissed back and pulled me closer. It was, fuck, it was the best kiss of my life and then the next thing I know, he’s shoving me back and scrambling to get away.” Dean lets out a shaky breath and drops his head into his hands.
Cas blinks, his heart warming with ever-growing adoration for the man in front of him. He steps forward, he can’t help it, and draws Dean into a tender kiss that ends with a tight hug. “I would be glad to meet your brother.”
“Dammit, Cas!” Dean wants to punch something, a wall maybe. Not Cas, no. Just
“I wasn’t expecting to see you until eight. Would have had plenty of time to get out of my system by then” Dean blushes, trying to explain.
Cas chuckles and leans back, slipping the shirt from his shoulders before stripping his undershirt off and tossing it aside. His fingers tighten around the waist of Dean’s jeans and he tugs them off along with Dean’s boxers easily, leaving Dean bare and panting beneath him. “So beautiful, Dean,” he rumbles as he leans forward to kiss his way across Dean’s chest and down his stomach.
Dean chuckles as he leaves a trail of kisses across Cas’ jaw and down the column of his throat. “You like the sound of that? Wanna be buried deep inside me? Wanna hear me scream your name? Tell me what you want, Professor.”
“I’m not taking no for an answer this time,” Cas’ voice comes from above him and Dean immediately bolts upright with his heart hammering in his chest.
The two men finish their meal in silence and Dean leaves to clear away the platter. The moment the door shuts behind the man, Cas hurries to his new bed of furs and wraps himself in a large pelt he thinks might have once belonged to a bear and angles himself to face the darkened fireplace.
Cas sucks in another deep breath and fights against the tears threatening to well in his eyes. “I… I’m…”
If Dean didn’t know better, he’d say the man looks pleasantly surprised.
Dean blinks himself out of the burgeoning haze and turns his gaze to Castiel.
“Feel so good,” Dean says with his eyes trained on where his dick is slowly disappearing, Cas stretched tight around him. “You okay?”
“Dean,” Cas cuts him off gently but his tone if firm. “I would prefer to stay with you, sex or not.”
He lifts his hips in offering and he can feel Dean smile against his skin. “Please,” Cas says softly, his voice barely more than a breathy whisper. “Make me feel good.”
“NO!” Gadreel wails and he launches himself in front of Castiel with what little strength he has left, catching an arrow surely meant for his brother’s heart before falling still in the red soaked earth.
He has to say yes. A least to a trial run.
Cas’s throat bobs as he swallows hard and Dean’s stomach twists. This seems like a moment that should be private, not on display for an outsider to see. “I, I can go wait in the car,” he stammers, looking between the others nervously.
“Goodnight, Dean,” Cas says before the line goes dead and Dean is sure he heard a smile in the man’s voice.
The tenderness in Dean’s gaze and the tingle that ripped through him when he reached out to take Dean’s hand has his mind swimming. Gabriel says Dean loves him. No, is
Cas takes the opportunity to sling a leg over Dean’s hips to straddle the man, effectively sitting in his lap. “In all my millennia of existence, the thought of disobeying my father never crossed my mind. Angels aren’t built for free will, Dean” Castiel continues licking and sucking gently around the pulse point of Dean’s throat. “But the moment my grace touched your soul in the darkest pits of Hell, something came alive in me” He drags his teeth over Dean’s collarbone and is pleased to feel Dean shudder beneath him.
If Dean wants to be fucked, then Castiel will be happy to oblige.
about marriage. Who would at this point?
“Shotgun!” Sam calls gleefully and Dean scowls.
Dean looks at him over the menu and rotates his wrist until he can grasp Cas’s fingers lightly. “Yeah?” One side of his mouth curls up and his eyes shine with guarded hope.
Thankfully, Dean’s mind catches up and he extends his hand with mumbled thanks. “Do…do you want a picture?” Dean asks, voice still unsure as he gestures to the camera.
Mary and John both nod but their expressions have gone slightly blank.
A slow smile spreads across her features and her tears disappear almost instantly as she meets Dean’s gaze. “You will get what you deserve,” She says with malice in her eyes.
Castiel loses his balance as Dean tackles him to the ground and pins him in a rough grip. Dean grins down into Castiel’s furious blue eyes.
Dean’s eyes widen at his first real glimpse of Cas with so few clothes. Cas swallows hard and shrinks back from Dean’s heavy stare but Dean cannot look away. Cas chest is firm and skin golden as if kissed by the sun. He’s lean and strong and absolute perfection.
“Your family must be real proud, Stanford’s a good program from what Dean says.” Bobby takes another drink and eyes Cas critically.
A groan pulls from his throat and Cas presses his forehead to the bed when Dean’s fingers disappear. “Gabriel,” he growls, recognizing the obnoxious tune immediately.
I will warn on this one for most of the chapter being very akin to torture and borderline rape fantasy. It's all pretend, planned out and entirely consensual, and I think I made that clear...BUT if you're sensitive then consider yourself warned.
“Very well, Sam” Cas scrunches his brows and returns to the computer. “Although I do not understand Dean’s embarrassment about discussing sex. My father never intended such a pleasurable act to be treated as shameful”
Castiel clasps the heavy wooden tray tightly and swallows hard as he follows the line of slaves out of the kitchen. The great hall of the longhouse has been lined with tables and filled with guests from neighboring villages that Castiel refuses to learn the names of.
a car, Mom,” Dean protests but his smile remains. “She’s a lady and deserves to be treated special.”
Now that Gabriel has been swallowed up by the airport and Dean is driving them home, Cas takes a moment the think about the whirlwind this last week has been.
They hug his body in all the right places.
Dean chuckles as he pulls into the Dispatch parking lot and Cas directs him toward where his car is waiting. “I love spaghetti,” Dean says as he parks and kills the engine.
Dean sucks in a breath through his nose and his jaw tightens against his will. “I didn’t open it.”
Benny shrugs as he reverently brushes his fingertips over the riches gathered in the center of the space. He snaps his fingers at the warriors behind him to call them to attention from their distracted glances about the room.
“That sounds nice,” Cas agrees.
Cas stares at Dean’s retreating back with a yawning cavern opening slowly in his gut. Dean’s glare was so hard, his tone so final, Cas doesn’t understand how this could have happened.
He spits again with a grimace, thankful that the ally is too dark for him to see the red tint that he knows is there. He must have bitten his cheek when the guy punched him and he sucks in a deep breath at the revelation as he cringes internally.
Cas sighs and shakes his head. His fingers twine effortlessly with Dean’s, his heart full to bursting. “My syllabus for fall has been approved, Billie was very pleased that I finished early despite being on vacation.”
“No” Castiel quickly backpedals. He did not mean it that way
Not that Cas is small or anything. He’s nearly as tall as Dean and well built, his shoulders are well defined, his arms thick and don’t even let him get started on Cas’ heavily muscled thighs. Dean feels his mouth water as he risks a look at Cas’ hips and legs. He can only imagine what it would be like to taste and touch. He’s beautiful, perfection in human form, and Dean absolutely cannot allow himself to go there.
Cas hardens in his hand, growing thicker as Dean sits up and meets Cas’ gaze. A bead of pre-come leaks from the slit and Dean gathers it on his finger, slowly bring the digit to his lips to get his first real taste.
Dean shakes his head again and Cas can see the cloud that crosses Dean’s expression before he shoves it back. “You don’t need to, babe. Your brother will be here soon, and then we can try to find a real job for you…”
He may be just returned, but his duties are never at an end.
Coffee will fix all his problems.
Cas glances to Dean with uncertainty but he holds out his hand for Benny to shake. “Nice to meet you too,” he says diplomatically. Dean doesn’t seem concerned so he doesn’t think he should be either.
“Two for laser tag,” Cas says with a proud smile as he reaches for his wallet.
A constant reminder that Dean will never be a true Norseman.
He grins widely as he pulls out his cutting board and gathers the onion and garlic he needs to chop.
He takes out his anger on the earth below him in the same way he holds the rage close to his heart, refusing to let go. His anger is against Gadreel, against Alastair, against Dean and Sam and Gabriel and everyone else in this God-forsaken place. The anger that burns the hottest is the anger he feels toward God.
“I know you’re afraid,” Dean begins, watching Castiel with a sad expression before huffing a self-deprecating laugh. He glances down, Castiel’s foot barely in his line of sight. “I won’t hurt you unless I have to.”
Dean huffs and shakes his head. “Whatever you say,” he mutters under his breath as he makes the turn into the main street that will take them toward the bay. “You ever had Tapas?”
“It’s a blizzard out there,” Sam grouses, not interested in standing outside in the swirling mess of white stuff that’s clinging to nearly every surface.
Shit. Shit.
“You told me to leave. Gabriel had a plan and I had to do something,” Cas says quickly with desperation in his eyes.
Cas clucks his tongue, still holding Dean close. “I want you to think about what kind of club I might have in mind for tonight, Dean. Think about everything we could do with those panties you’re wearing and imagine how it might feel if I were to push them aside and fuck into you from behind with your hands pinned behind your back so the only relief you might find is the softest touch of that soft fabric trapping your hard and leaking cock….”
He looks back to Dean with a tender smile stretching his lips. Given the choice between sex with Dean and listening to Gabriel complain about being the last to know… well, Cas knows which option he’ll take. “Gabriel can wait. Now, where were we?”
Dean’s scowling threat is cut off by an abrupt cry when Cas pulls out nearly entirely and slams back in with a devilish smirk.
“Good.” She holds the bill out for Dean to take and Cas shakes his head fondly as Dean snatches the bill with a half-hearted scowl. “Keep up the good work, Dean.”
Cas spent a good eight hours on the road to get to Lawrence and that was over six hours ago.
“Dean, do you still want to be suspended?” Cas lays a firm hand on Dean’s shoulder and stares into Dean’s eyes.
It’s a wonder his Thursday regular didn’t seem to care that Cas had moaned Dean’s name when his clever hands had Cas’s dick spurting white and sticky over the brick wall he had been pressed against.
“Yeah,” Cas says with a nod as Lee steps to the edge of the stage next to Dean.
Alfie lets out a sad sigh and shakes his head. “Oh, Castiel. Inias has mooned over you for years now. Have you never noticed his favor?”
“Yeah” Dean calms considerable, giving Castiel’s knees a gentle squeeze before running his hands up his Angel’s thighs.
He can see Cas’s shrug out of his periphery. “I don’t need to be back at any particular time. The park sounds nice.” Cas flashes him a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes and Dean feels the space between them like an impassable crevasse.
He imagines she would be rolling over in her grave if she had one.
Cas shifts to his feet with a salacious grin and offers Dean his hand.
Dean rises from the table to fetch clean water and he issues a soft command for Cas to stay. When he returns, he has a small container held in his grasp along with the bowl.
Dean prays, corner of his lip twitching with an amusing idea.
No. No. No.
“My apologies, Dean” Castiel’s gravel rough voice comes amid the flutter of wings that announces his presence. “I, lost track of the time” something about Castiel’s voice is strained and has Dean throwing back his blanket in alarm.
Dean rears back and shakes his head. “Hey, man, it’s alright.” Except it isn’t. It really isn’t, but he isn’t going to take it out on Cas. It isn’t his fault his big brother as much of a douche nozzle as Cole.
Cas carefully wraps his arms around Dean’s back and breathes his scent in deeply. “Like pick up a hooker?” He tries to joke but he can tell by the way Dean’s arms tighten around him that it fell flat.
Cas watches him curse and sputter with a soft smile until Baby is backed safely into a spot next to the curb so she can only be assaulted from one side.
Sam takes a breath and Dean is almost sure he’s about to launch into something that’s weighing on his mind, he has that same nearly constipated look he’d always get as a kid before asking for something that he expected Dean to say no to.
Cas nods and rises with his hand outstretched. “Thank you, Charlie.”
“I’m sorry,” he mutters as he hurries past and slips out the door with his back on his shoulder.
Cas can’t help the smile that refuses to dim as he makes his way home.
“Lilith. Ruby. Listen,” Cas says in a whisper as he grips Benny’s forearm and leads him to the corner of the building.
“That was awesome,” Dean says between kisses, his words slightly slurred.
Dean’s arms grips Cas’ hips and Cas’ strong legs hold onto Dean tightly as he draws back sharply before slamming forward, pulling Cas’ to meet him. The smooth drag of his erection against Castiel’s inner walls at this angle is like nothing Dean has ever felt. His muscles strain and bulge to hold the weakened Angel’s weight but the look of pure bliss on Castiel’s face is worth every bit of the discomfort.
Dean backs off, hands held up in surrender as Cas grabs the potholders.
Dean nods. “I, uh, I can see myself loving you too. I mean, in the future. For a long time.” Dean’s cheeks continue to redden and the way he’s stumbling through his words is adorable in a way Cas never imagined a grown man could be.
Dean rolls his eyes and waves her away before giving Cas a firm nod and smile.
Gabriel shakes his head. “Dean is an idiot. He loves you, Cassie. That much is plain for anyone to see.”
“I, uh, do you have anything fruity with tiny umbrellas?” Dean asks, a playful smirk on his face.
He’s no fool, he knew that the barista was lying when she said she was out of Cas’s original order… the one that cost less than half of what Dean ended up paying for but he didn’t mind. Not when it meant having a chance to talk to Cas for even a few minutes while she made it.
Dean swallows hard, hand reaching out to brace himself on Cas’ flank. “Okay,” he says with a nod and Cas grins. Their intermittent flirting has grown a hot edge, threatening to catch fire at any moment and Cas can hardly wait until they’re alone tonight.
“My bees, Dean, somethings wrong. There was a bullet hole! A bullet hole!” He rambles, tugging at his hair. “And a coyote,” he shakes his head. “Dean, there was a coyote!”
Rufus laughs and smiles broadly. “And pass up your cooking? I may be old but I’m not stupid. Of course, I’ll come over. You stayin at Chuck’s?”
“I grew,” Sam states the obvious as he holds the door for Dean.
“Yeah, yeah, smartass.” Dean shakes his head as he works his way through the stack of pancakes, leaving a visible layer of butter on each one. “I wanted to ask you a couple of things about your work…” Dean gives him an awkward smile that nearly doubles as a grimace.
“Come,” Dean demands as he tugs Castiel from the boat. Cas flinches under Dean’s touch but Dean ignores the monk’s hesitation as he drags him to the group of the other monks. Dean's lips curl upward slightly when Cas doesn’t try to pull away from him, so he keeps his hold light as a reward.
“Guess we both fall short, eh, brother?” Benny says with a shrug as they walk back inside the building and Cas snaps his attention to the other man. “My dad was never really big on father-son stuff, know what I mean?” Benny smiles and Cas narrows his eyes as something clenches in his stomach.
Thankfully, his students were the only ones to bat an eye and their response has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic. The University had asked him about possibly booking Dean for a spring concert for the student or some other publicity stunt.
“You can either wait in the green room or go back to the buffet room. Or you can join me?” Dean asks sheepishly, cheeks flushing crimson as he struggles to laugh at his own joke.
No matter how many times he needs to remind himself, his heart will eventually catch up to his brain.
Cas takes an audible breath. “Yes, Dean.”
“What am I? Chopped liver?” Dean squawks as Sam pulls open the door.
“Hmmmm, you know I like to hear you beg” Dean grins at Cas’ desperation before licking a stripe up the understand of Cas’ cock.
Dean feels his orgasm building with the untethered power of a raging wildfire, the connection between them burning with a delirious mix of want and need. His will stretches and bends to Cas, his entire universe narrowed to each thrust of the other man’s hips and the grip of his hands.
Dean nods and forces a smile as he turns to wraps his arms around Cas’ waist. “Just thinking about how I could make this worth your while.”
“Understatement,” Dean grumbles under his breath. “Bobby has always been more of a Dad to me than my dad. He always gave a shit, you know? When my dad was off drinking or hunting or whatever the hell he did and I was left taking care of Sam, Bobby was the one who’d check in on us, send us money for food. More than once, he drove all night to come and get us from whichever fleabag motel dad dumped us in. Don’t think I woulda made it without him.”
Dean inches his way down Cas’ body, licking, sucking, nipping gently at Cas’ skin until he’s bracketed by Cas’ knees. Cas trembles faintly and lets out quiet gasps and whimpers as Dean works his hand over Cas’ cock and he lifts his head to watch as Dean continues to kiss lower.
Gabriel narrows his eyes and looks Dean over from head to toe. “So you and my brother are living together now?”
Castiel scowls and looks out over as he berates himself for caring what Dean might think.
Dean pinches a frown but nods. “Well, you got me. What’s up?”
Cas pushes to his feet and drags the large cushions off the back of the couch. “Kneel on these” He nudges Dean aside and places the wide cushions on the floor. Dean gratefully climbs over them, letting his knees and hands sink into the squishy surface.
Cas pinches back his smile. “The drink or the garnish?”
is Crowley looking at him like that? He swallows hard and musters a glare as he shrugs. “It’s a little soon for that, don’t you think?” He forces himself to ask around his pounding heart. Pretending for all the world that he has nothing to hide.
Cas waits patiently as Charlie pays and waves off the change with a forgiving smile.
“Alright.” Cas scoots forward and flips a few pages in Sam’s textbook with a frown before setting it aside with an unamused snort. “Let me grab one of mine.” He pushes from the couch and crosses the room to the small bookshelf he and Dean bought to store their growing collection.
Cas broke his promise and Dean is
Not for the first time, Dean thinks he needs to make sure Cas is properly taught their language. The monk has picked up a surprising amount in the few weeks he’s been among them, but he still has so much to learn and Dean hates seeing his confusion turn to frustration as it so often does.
No one seems to be paying Dean any attention.
“In this neighborhood?” Now it’s Castiel’s turn to raise his brow in question.
Two hours later, Dean’s stomach is growling angrily as they cross into the tiny little no-name town in northern Nebraska. The sun is still high in the sky, meaning they have plenty of time to interview townsfolk and get a feel for where they need to be when the moon comes out tonight.
Cas nods as he swallows hard. “I promise,” Cas says thickly. “I will be in Sam’s room with Gabriel.”
Balthazar grins, all teeth and bright eyes that crinkle in the corners. “Excellent! I’ll follow you home tomorrow. How do you feel about eyeliner?” He thumbs Cas’ cheek and looks him over with a critical eye.
“Bottom drawer,” Cas grumbles as he downs half his espresso in one gulp. He watches with dread building in his stomach as Balthazar tears open said drawer and digs all the way to the bottom before standing up with his prize.
Castiel stumbles but keeps his silence and allows his brother to keep him from toppling to the ground from Dean’s harsh treatment.
“Cas?” Dean comes up for air, turning to him with a cockeyed smile. “Bacon?”
Cas huffs and shakes his head as he nudges Dean toward the stairs. “You only say that because you don’t know her.”
Dean pushes himself onto his elbows with a pinched frown. “Yeah, I mean, if you want?”
Cas will happily drink the wine.
Cas swallows hard and nods. “It’s not, I mean… my childhood wasn’t the best. Wasn’t easy.”
They don’t part until Dean’s knees hit the edge of the bed and he’s forced to turn away just long enough to climb through the fluffy pile of white blankets, his robe catching on the soft cotton as he settles onto his back.
“I am sorry, Sam,” Gadreel says quietly with his head bowed. He takes a brave step forward and Ezekiel shifts on his feet behind him.
“Relax, mi carissime,” Cas whispers. “You’re far too tense.”
Ezekiel folds his arms over his chest and stares down at Dean while Cas’ lips part in surprise.
After dessert is served and eaten, they ask about Naomi and Cas is careful to skirt around the worst of his childhood but he still breaks into subdued tears when he tells them about Naomi’s death.
“He what?!” Gabriel almost yells and Cas cringes at the sudden sound.
As if reading his mind, Castiel chuckles. “How would you like an examination from Doctor Sexy?” Dean’s breath stutters as he leans up to attack Castiel with kisses. Cas laughs. “I take it that’s a yes”
“Come on, mister!” A kid almost yells at Cas as he gestures toward the opposite side of the area from where Dean disappeared.
Dean huffs a laugh and lays his hands over Cas’ where they still hold his cheeks. “We’ll see if you still say that in a year.”
Kinks explored: Biting.
His heart skips a beat at the odd address and his eyes narrow in confusion. He doesn’t dare question her. She is merely trying to distract him from his duty.
The delightful women holds a keen understanding of the importance of her job.
And then, he has an idea.
He shouldn’t be tempting the man.
“Did you…really, Cas?” Dean chokes out between guffaws and Sam joins in with a snicker at Cas’ awkward phrasing.
And that confuses Castiel greatly.
Not some brainless brute who doubles as a possessive bastard.
No matter how Sam might protest.
Michael’s chin tilts toward the darkening sky with an impatient huff. “Mother misses you.”
“Hmmm, you like my dick,” Cas purrs and Dean narrows his eyes as he stares.
Cas can feel Gadreel’s heavy gaze on his back but he doesn’t have the will to face the man. He needs to find Sam.
any of the weeds from the ground.
“Dean,” Cas whimpers, tone sounding almost broken as he strains against the tie binding his hands.
Dean quickly pays while Cas goes into the back to presumably get ready to leave for the day. “You didn’t have to let him go early, I don’t mind waiting.”
He almost pities Asmodeus and his supporters.
She giggles slightly. “Yes. Like many subs, I’m allowed to speak with other bottoms and subs, but not their tops. Not without permission. Most Doms don’t speak to another’s sub unless given permission either” She explains that while her own Dom is clearly not ignoring Dean, he’s staying out of the conversation nonetheless.
Cas sighs and pushes at Dean just a little harder but Dean clamps down tighter and burrows his chin painfully into Cas’ breastbone. “Dean,” Cas whines and moves his legs as much as Dean allows.
The warriors go still and glance to one another and then to Dean nervously as they wait for their leader to put forth the direction. Dean takes a deep breath and nods. “You heard my brother, move!” He says clear and boldly in a tone that allows for no doubt or argument.
Cas hums in consideration. “No” He disagrees and Dean tenses. “You choose” He gives Dean’s ass a light smack, not entirely certain where this is going but not feeling quite right about giving Dean the spanking his fingers itch to deliver. They haven’t discussed a punishment aspect to their relationship. They haven’t discussed formalizing Dean’s tendency to submit to Castiel’s domination and they haven’t discussed limits.
today.
At least the people there have an idea of what general human decency is.
Dean hopes, wants even, for the man from the forest to be sleeping within the shuttered and walled monastery. Dean has already decided that should he see those shocking blue eyes this morning, the man will become his. No one shall touch him, no one who wishes to live will bring the monk harm.
These are the moments when Dean wishes time could stop. Both of them, carefree and happy until the end of time. Their distant past made even more distant by the easiness between them and the lack of expectations. The cloud of fear they valiantly tried to ignore in Herculaneum and then in Rome holds no power anymore. The pain of being separated by space and time, connected only by their dreams, has dulled into memory almost as distant as Dean’s servitude.
“And Cassie is a terrible liar,” Gabriel teases and playfully elbows Cas in the ribs.
Cas wraps his legs tightly around Dean’s waist as his head drops back in pleasure. “So close, Dean” He whines, hands grasping the blanket underneath him.
Seemingly as if Dean read his mind, he’s gently pulling Cas off him and rolling onto his side to rummage through the door of the nightstand. He rolls back with a triumphant grin and Cas’ stomach swoops when Dean holds out a bottle of lube and a condom. “Please, Cas. I want you.”
“I forgive you, Dean. I forgave you months ago.” Cas smiles crookedly, one side of his mouth pulling up as he huffs through his nose.
“Sir.” Dean stands just that much taller, refusing to back down.
Dean sits higher than Cas in this position and he wrenches Castiel’s head back for a messy kiss, holding tightly to the Angel’s hair with one hand and pulling his tie loose with the other. “I want you to fuck me, Cas” Dean groans against Castiel’s plush lips. “I want you to fuck me so hard I can barely walk. Pump me so full of come that I’m leaking for
“How about we settle up the tab and head back to the hotel?” Benny suggests, side-eyeing the front of the restaurant where people are starting to look in their direction.
Dean is pleased to find that he was wrong.
“Alright, you two, no making out on the sidewalk!” Charlie claps her hands and ushers them apart. “As much as the paps would love the show, I’d rather you not scar my innocent eyes.”
Cas doesn’t want them to think he’s insane.
Castiel stands frozen with wide eyes as silence falls around him.
When Dean turns to the wings and opens his arms in invitation, mouthing silent pleas for Cas to join him, his resolve crumbles and Cas lets out a browbeaten sigh.
“What? That bad?” Dean’s stomach flips as Cas lifts his chin to stare with wide eyes and a slack jaw.
“Yes” Dean forces out, deflating with the effort.
Cas stares, shocked that Benny just
“What. Did. You. Do.” Dean punctuates each word with a stab of his finger against the center of Sam’s chest and his eyes blaze with fury.
“What’s your name?” Cas asks, flipping open the book to the cover.
Cas busies himself folding laundry fresh from the line outside while Dean makes several trips to the garden to dump his soiled water.
His green eyes dart toward Cas’ small security detail and a wide grin stretches his lips when he locks eyes with Cas.
He was stupid to think he had a chance of changing Cas’s mind and now he’s lost the one friend he had out here.
He quickly turns on his heel and hurries down the path before anyone can stop him.
“Dean,” Cas’ voice comes softly as if he can read Dean’s thoughts and he strokes gently fingers over Dean’s jaw. “You feel it, don’t you?” His voice is gentle and Dean closes his eyes against the swell of emotion as he drives into Cas over and over.
“I apologize, Sam. I lost track of time” Cas lowers his gaze sheepishly, but Dean doesn’t miss the slight smirk the Angel wears as Sam drops himself into the passenger seat.
“They are,” Cas agrees as he folds his hands under his head. “You mentioned before that your uncle wants you to call your brother, have you thought about doing it?” Cas turns his head as he speaks as if his words don’t make Dean’s stomach clench and twist hard enough for bile to rise in his throat.
Once he deems himself clean, he pushes to his feet and casts his gaze about for a scrap of fabric to dry himself with. When his eyes land on the neatly laid out swatch of linen, he smiles warmly and scoops the blanket sized fabric up and wraps himself snugly under his arms and around his chest.
“A humble-what?” Dean asks, clueless and confused. Meg is speaking nonsense and the way her words curl in the air with sharpened edges as they fall make something cautious twitch low in Dean’s belly.
Samuel had dismissed their knowledge out of hand and has been scowling at their work since they began. Sam had seen the benefit and Dean was eager to give Cas a chance to prove himself.
Dean returns quickly with a heavily laden tray of fresh meats and bread that cause Cas’ stomach to rumble. The delicious aroma wafts toward Cas and he clenches his eyes closed against the sight as he turns away from Dean’s meal regardless of how he hopes that Dean means to share.
Unlike Dean, Sam embraced his god tendencies and positioned himself to help the prey animals he was born to advocate for. He hired into the Department of Natural Resources as a park ranger decades ago. Sure, he’s had to disappear for a while and come back with a new name a few times to keep people from growing too suspicious, but he’s happy there.
“Cas?” Dean says again and Inias scowls.
“It’s fine, Mick. He’s a friend.” Cas’s voice is strong but the way he angles himself in front of Dean has his hackles raising.
Silence surrounds them as Cas clings. Eventually, Dean feels Cas relax and his breathing evens out as he falls asleep.
That just means people give him more space.
Cas takes his lower lip between his teeth as he takes Dean’s soft cock into his hand. He squeezes and massages as Dean hisses and tries to jerk away but Dean’s minor acts of protest go ignored. “Again, Dean” Cas reminds him as he tightens his grip on Dean’s dick, beginning to slowly pump his fist in time with his thrusts.
No. He doesn’t dare do more than wipe himself down with a damp rag in the safety of Dean’s room when he’s alone.
“Now, Cas. Please” Dean manages to choke out against Castiel’s pleased smile.
It’s hardcore and Dean’s never done anything like it.
His breath all but stalls when Dean starts to sing.
Sunday is their favorite day. The one day of the week they decide to stay home and not walk the streets in search of customers.
The feeling swirling in his gut now makes his chest swell and his eyes water.
And to think he was worried about being caught selling himself.
Alfie arches a brow with a fond smirk before he huffs and shakes his head in amusement. “You have always been the blindest among us at times.”
The first brush of their naked cocks together pulls a delighted gasp from Dean as his clutches for Cas’s hips and holds him in place as they rut together. Dean’s self-restraint stretches and threatens to crumble but he holds true, letting Cas set the pace as he grinds above him.
As it turns out, a little bit longer did hurt him.
“So, we’re heading back to the hotel to get you settled but the show isn’t till tomorrow and we don’t rehearse the night before. Gotta take care of the voice an all,” Dean says, gesturing to his throat. “So, I’m all yours for the night,” Dean adds as he waggles his brows and leans closer. “Got any idea what you want to do?”
Dean nods and tightens his hold on Cas’ hand to pull him closer.
Yes. He cares about Cas. He would be devastated if something happens to him.
“It’s okay, Dean,” he says, hoping Dean hears him.
Especially when music from the stage kicks up and the opening chords of one of Dean’s most popular songs fills the air.
Oh, how he wishes she would though. He would be lying if he said he never misses his family.
“The worst,” Cas says, forcing himself to breathe through his nose.
Everything is just as Cas left it, even the dust and he huffs and shakes his head. As far as Cas knows, they’re the first people in his house since Chuck left for Italy two months ago. “He was drunk, or high.” Cas shrugs. “Gabe had dragged me out to
The music still plays when the door opens and Lee steps through. “Good to see you again, Castiel,” he says with a smile. His long, dark, hair hangs in his face as always but his smile is bright. “What brings you fellas back here? I thought you’d be halfway to Stanford by now.”
“Th…thank you,” she stumbles over her words and flushes crimson. “It’s so amazing to meet you.”
Dean clenches his jaw and takes a step closer. Oh, this beautiful and intriguing man. His sour scent says that Castiel struck a nerve that threatens to explode in a shower of delightful sparks and yet his expression is a mask of calm and confident defiance.
The control room of the studio was not what Castiel had been expecting. Sure, Dean had shown him the live room where the artists set up, but this is incredible. All the switches and slides that Cas can’t begin to understand. Dean throws around words like balance and sound dampening, and then he throws back his head in laughter when Cas gives him a confused squint.
“Dean?” Cas questions again, pulling out his best chiding teacher voice. The one that never fails to make his freshmen blush and stumble over their words in their haste to make up an answer when they haven’t done the readings.
He scrubs himself well enough and decides not to shave. Bal has always said his five o’clock shadow makes his eyes seem that much bluer, so he decides to with it.
Dean turns his head and arches a brow. “Oh?”
“Alright, here we go,” Benny says as he tosses Dean a hefty wooden sword.
Sam arches a brow while Cas looks to the table with a fierce blush blooming over his cheeks. “Uh, okay?” Sam says, his words are more of a question than a statement but Gabe nods and heads for the door anyway.
Cas’ lips part slightly, just enough to hesitantly wrap around the crown of Dean’s dick and he gives a gentle suck that has stars exploding behind Dean’s eyes. Dean lets out a strangled cry and wrenches the furs between his fingers. His hands hurt from how hard he squeezes, but he needs something to keep him grounded, to keep himself from bucking up into the wet heat of Cas’ mouth.
Dean calls upon the entirely of his self-restraint to not rip his Cas from Inias’ arms. A low growl escapes his throat and Cas tenses at the sound. Dean feels a swell of satisfaction at the way Cas hurriedly pushes himself away from Inias and takes a half step toward Dean.
Cas takes a deep breath when he pulls into a parking space at The Dispatch. The lot is packed, but in the form of some cosmic joke, that means the place is probably empty inside. His eyes automatically seek out the dark SUV that drove Dean to the coffee shop the day before and he feels a pang of disappointment when he doesn’t see it.
Dean flushes crimson and squeezes Cas’ hand harder as John nods. Dean can see the way his Dad’s eyes turn glassy as Castiel speaks and Mary’s expression softens to the point where Dean is afraid that she might cry. Cas seems to have that effect when his past self shines through so eloquently.
Dean swallows hard and fights the urge to drop to one knee with everything he has. Now isn’t the time. “We’re lucky to have you, and they will be too.” He presses a chaste kiss to Cas’ brow despite the thundering of his heart and he smiles. “Now, let's find a frame for this.” He touches the edge of the photograph. “I’m sure Mom has an extra that will do until we can find something perfect.”
“Dean,” Cas says with a sob. His voice is deeper and rougher than usual, worn hoarse from screaming and Dean’s stomach flops with nausea.
“GloGolf?” Dean questions, peeking his head around Cas’ shoulder.
That isn’t even very far from the truth.
Strong arms wrap around his shoulders and he finds himself drawn tightly against Dean’s chest as panic threatens to overtake him. Cas tries to push back, tries to beat against the arms circling him like iron bands, but Dean doesn’t budge.
Dean settles back down with a happy hum, the warmth of the bed and Cas surrounding him are lulling him into such of a sleepy state. “M’glad you thought of this. I think kinktober is a good idea” Dean admits, letting his eyes slide closed.
“She was a junkie then, heroin. Anyway, one thing led to another and I ended up using,” Cas trails off ducks his gaze.
Cas must be able to tell by Dean’s tone because his fingers quickly disappear from Dean’s hair and find Dean’s hand instead. He laces their fingers together and gives a squeeze.
Dean is being stupid. That’s why.
Cas staggers backward under her weight and Missy works to pry her mother away even as Cas puts an instinctive arm around her back, resting his open palm between her shoulder blades.
Their paired groans and drawn out moans sound tinny and distant pouring out of Dean’s laptop, the tiny speakers losing the depth and authenticity of real-life fashion. Cas reaches down to adjust himself regardless, bright eyes fixated on the scene in front of them. He glances to Dean to see his lover watching with halfhearted attention, eyes watching the darker haired man’s expression more than what the blond man on his knees is up to.
Dean hesitates in bringing the candle back and Cas keens when the first drop of hot wax lands just below the head of his cock. His breath comes in short pants but Cas urges Dean to continue, body shivering with want and mind clouded with need.
He isn’t a fool, he knows that prep isn’t as necessary as he would like to think but he would never assume his partner would be okay without it. To see Dean taking his cock like this stirs something primal deep inside him that Cas didn’t know he had until this moment.
“Any news?” Cas whispers in Dean’s ear and Dean shakes his head.
Dean’s brows scrunch and he shakes his head. “You ain’t got nothin to be sorry for. I’m glad you got out, glad you’re makin something of yourself. I’d never be able to forgive myself if you had gotten trapped in that life.”
“My brother did this.” He gestures to the mess around them. “I was, well, I was very drunk and wishing revenge on the man who called me and friends names… Gabriel can be quite the prankster,” the man rambles, slowly stepping toward Dean with his hands held out apologetically. “I was going to try to intercept, that,” he points at the box, “but I was too late.” He cringes and Dean feels his anger flash.
“Mr. Winchester?” Their server returns with a dry mop to soak up the water. “I, uh, brought this for you. I have a big brother too.” She flushes as she holds the glass out to Castiel and his heart swells with gratitude. “Just hold it in your mouth as long as you can stand, swish it around. It’ll help.”
No wonder Cas got so upset when he made that offhand remark. “I…” Dean starts before trailing off and swallowing hard against the lump in his throat. “I don’t care.” He’s thought about this before and he doesn’t care what Cas does to get by.
Dean chuckles and smiles, dragging soft fingertips over Castiel’s knee and up his thigh. “You want my mouth on you?” He questions, voice low and husky. He already knows the answer to that question. “This Kinktober thing was such a good idea, Cas” Dean scoots up, settling between Castiel’s knees.
Dean arches a brow and waits for Cas to look at him. Food play is just kinda strange unless they’re talking about things like whipped cream and chocolate sauce. Dean could get behind licking either of those from Cas’ skin but that almost seems boring compared to the other items on the list. “Suspension?” is the one Dean feels compelled to ask about.
Dean gives Cas a skeptical look but nods slowly. “Alright ya moose,” he says as he ruffles Sam’s hair, earning himself an indignant squawk from his brother. “Pizza okay?”
“Cas, the glass!” Dean yelped, whipping off his flannel so that he was in just his t-shirt and very carefully brushed the glass away. Strangely enough, the goo seemed to be seeping into Cas’s skin and disappearing. A little voice in the back of Dean’s head worried that would have consequences since they had no idea what was even in that bottle, but mostly Dean was concerned with keeping Cas from cutting himself. “You okay?” he said.
Cas giggled warmly, coaxing Dean to kiss him. “I can’t believe roleplaying as ourselves when we first met is the scenario you chose for our first time together as a married couple.”
Dean wasn’t much of a talker, at least around new people, Castiel noted. He and Sam held most of the conversation while Dean just brooded, occasionally throwing in a sarcastic comment. At one point Dean did get up and go to the kitchen, returning 10 minutes later with a plate of Christmas cookies and three steaming mugs of hot chocolate, much to Castiel’s delight. He sipped his drink, which was topped off with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, and sighed fondly. “I appreciate knowing another human with my affinity for hot chocolate culture,” he said to Dean.
“I...what?” Chuck said, bewildered.
“Yeah...thanks for that.” Dean grabbed the demon blade he had tucked in his waistband and drove it
Chuck shook his head. “Died in the womb. They did a C-section but it was too late. The baby couldn’t get any oxygen...my little Castiel...”
you’re going to die. That’s an advantage most people don’t have. You still have
Dean closed his eyes and obediently opened up, letting Castiel slide inside, his shaft sliding over his tongue. Dean closed his lips around him and started sucking. “Yes, such a good mouth,” sighed Castiel, fisting Dean’s hair encouragingly. “You were made to please me, my Righteous Man. You will serve Heaven second and me first.”
“How do you know he’s a grifter, Dean? Did you even see his mark?”
“Thank you.” Castiel gingerly unfolded the shirt. “What does...‘Metal Licka’ mean?”
Chuck stared at him up and down. “My God...your hair...your eyes...the trenchcoat! You’re...”
“Uh...it’s been a while,” Castiel admitted.
“Technically, you do—mine.” Dean groaned softly as he palmed the front of his flannel pajamas. It had been
“After breakfast then?”
time ago?”
when Castiel was older, when he was ready to hear that he was adopted.
Dean moaned in agreement around the angel’s cock, bobbing his head enthusiastically. He dedicated himself to figuring out what made Castiel tick, what made him groan or pull harder on Dean’s hair. Fuck, he loved that, he was such a slut for the pain and the pleasure he derived from it. Something in him still wanted to fight being made into this angel’s bitch, but he loved being down on his knees and taking it far too much to resist.
