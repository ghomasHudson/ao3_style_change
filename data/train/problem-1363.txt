,” John stands up, leans over the bedside and takes Sherlock’s hand in both of his. He looks a fright, his hair sticking up in unwashed spikes, his skin greasy and pale. He’s clearly been wearing the same clothes for days, they’re stained and creased, his jeans yellowed with dirt. But he’s smiling, and his tired, bloodshot eyes are brimming with relief and happiness. He reaches out and presses the red call button next to Sherlock’s head. “Need the doctor to come and evaluate you. But I’m not going anywhere. Promise.”
It's how I feel.
“My room?”
“I think we will. Dr Watson.” He had a strange haircut. Blunt and square. It almost looked as if he did it himself.
"Aren't they beautiful? There's hive kits in the car. I'll get your toolbox."
Suddenly he wants a cigarette so badly he can't bear it. He's reached in his pocket and pulled out the pack before he even knows what he's doing. A hand closes over his.
? It’s an absurd thought, and Sherlock feels somehow like he shouldn’t be as pleased about it as he is. He
"Take off your jeans."
"So now the flat is officially ours. We marked our territory." John raises his head, cheeks still holding a delicate pink blush, his eyes bright and giddy. He very deliberately holds his hand up, looks at it, sticky with Sherlock's come, and then dips his index finger into his mouth and suckles on the end of it.
“True.” Sherlock slips completely off the chair and tucks his legs underneath him, bending down close enough to Mycroft that he can feel the heat coming off of him.
‘’No, I didn’t. Rude of me.” Sherlock tucks himself back into his pants, realising how disgusting and sticky they both are. “Ugh.”
was that all about?” John breathes, watching James saunter down the hill. He shifts his gaze to Sherlock as his fingers uncurl from his wand.
The harder he tried to make it solidify, the farther away it became.
“So. Watson.” She sounds smug as hell.
They’re quiet for just a beat. Sherlock blinks the snow from his long black lashes. John can’t think of a single thing to say. He swallows, wanting to reach out and touch Sherlock, to dissipate this unfamiliar awkwardness that’s sprung up between them.
“Yeah, it’s fine, Sherlock.” John has to kiss him again. Their lips slot together perfectly, kiss raw and sore. John traces the inner rim of Sherlock’s lips with the tip of his tongue, tightens his fingers to grip the soft skin at Sherlock’s waist. “So, you’re okay, right?”
“Home.” Sherlock grins, and John grins back. A stiff wind blows off the river and they both shiver. “Come on, I have blankets down there.”
Before Sherlock can do anything at all in response except grab helplessly at John’s hips, John rolls off him, unceremoniously yanks both his jeans and his pants off and slithers across the bed on his stomach. He looks expectantly over his shoulder at Sherlock, his eyes huge and round and seething with emotion.
“Alright.” Sherlock stares up at the ceiling, focuses on the cobweb dangling in front of the window. He curls his arm around John’s shoulders - too bony, too small - and wishes he had a cigarette.
Sherlock pulls a pen-sized torch out of his pocket and hands it to John, flicks another one on for himself. “It’s St Mark’s tube station. Closed in the 1960’s when the Tower Bridge station opened. It’s closed off from any lines, and pretty clean and safe, considering the alternatives.”
Heat floods through him as John leans over his back and scrapes his teeth over Sherlock's shoulder blade, kisses the nape of his neck, and then sits back up and resumes his drumming.
“I know that. There’s no mayonnaise in it, love. Eat it.”
Sherlock kissed his way down John's jaw, nuzzling gently into what was now very soft, though still coarse, slightly curled hair. He burrowed close, pulling his knees up to his chest and leaning against John's side.
“I’ve never once treated you that way. Like you're not an independent adult.”
Sherlock thought about it, what John would look like, and feel like, with a beard. How found, to his utter consternation, that he couldn't. "I don't know yet. Need data."
“You’re lucky you’re so fit. If you were an ugly bugger, you couldn’t boss me around half as easily. Hand me your cup.”
“Yeah. Ta.” John threw a wad of cash at him, not bothering to ask how much he actually owed. “The boot?”
“I’m going to cut you now, love. Last chance to say no.” John put a small bit of pressure on the blade, Sherlock’s skin depressing under it.
“I’m sorry.” John doesn’t probe any further, but sets the barrette down gently on top of the papers and hands the box back to Sherlock with gentle hands. “I didn’t mean to pry.”
Mycroft sighs, long-suffering and resigned. “No need for that, John. It’s on top of the wardrobe. On the left hand side.”
John laughs that beautiful full chuckle that he has, the deep laugh lines around his eyes crinkling. "No. Because Mrs Hudson loved us. And we loved her. But she's gone, and her niece didn't owe us anything. We were just tenants to her. Tenants who paid a quarter of what the flat is worth."
“Yes. He, grew up with them, has been close to both families since childhood.”
...but I have to get to Hackney or someplace not here. There's too many cops in the touristy areas."
Panic coiled tight and cold in his stomach as the bathroom door started to swing open. He was so focused on what was in front of him, the blow from behind was a complete shock. He instinctively whirled, arm flinging out to cut the legs out from under whoever was behind him. It was a solid wall of muscle. In the quick glance he got in before the next blow, he caught a fringed leather jacket and height, just height.
“It’s just.” John clears his throat, stretches his hand out flat against Sherlock’s sternum and idly runs his fingertip through the sparse dark hairs there. “You - loving you - missing you - you’re the only thing about me that never changed. When I couldn’t even get out of the fucking bed, when I was too damned drunk to stand...you were still in there somewhere. It drove me
"Well, Detective Sergeant, I have a plan, but - I'll need your help."
“I know.” Sherlock smoothes the blankets down and pulls a chair up to the side of the bed. “I know.”
Sherlock rubs his thumb along the cleft of John’s chin. “Bored, John? I know we haven’t had a case on for a few weeks...we’ll get another, don’t worry.”
“Oh, I probably could, given enough time and a bit more sobriety.” Sherlock leans forward, and lowers his already baritone voice into a dark rumbling purr, “And some familiarity with the freckles on your neck.”
does that hurt. His skull feels full of sharp edges and explosions. His ears ring and ring and ring as he settles back against the pillow and tries not to be sick.
John squeezes his keys in his fist, hard, and then throws them on the coffee table with as much force as he wants to hurl at Sherlock. The sound of it startles them both. They crash into the surface, skid across the length and drop into the floor. The teeth leave dents in the wood. "Why are you doing this? What the fuck, Sherlock? What the fuck is wrong with you? All I've ever tried to do is make you happy, goddammit."
John slowly turns his head and blinks confusedly for a moment, then licks his lips and smiles at the sight of Sherlock standing there. “Hey gorgeous. Was wondering where you got to.”
“It’s fine, Sherlock.” John squeezes his fingers and sips his coffee, then sets the cup on the table with a solid thump. “Go ahead, Mycroft. I’m ready.”
“What do you want, my love? Tell me.” John’s already reaching back, twisting behind him to get what they need from the bedside drawer.
“I forgot. But still, Apparition! And NEWT classes, can you believe it? I’m still taking Potions, of course…”
“You made me think we were going to die, Sherlock! How could you
John's having misgivings about his new endeavors, and Sherlock's trying to get to him.
Mike makes a low hum of approval that Sherlock hopes John can’t hear.
John doesn’t move his leg. “When do you have to get back?”
He closes his eyes and rubs his mouth against Sherlock's throat, and Sherlock instinctively wraps his arms around John's back.  Sherlock's hands are warm and bony, skating flat up John's back, fingers slow over each vertebra, mapping, tracing. His head starts to go floaty light, hormone drunk, just from this. Just from twenty seconds of Sherlock's hands on his bare back. He hasn't felt this, this kind of wanting to just sink down into another person, evaporate and drift into them until he can't tell the difference between their heartbeat and his, for years, forever, since before he even met Sherlock.
"Well, don't sound so accusatory about it. It's just on my dad's side, like one quarter of the family. Is this a problem? You don't like Scottish people?" John was teasing him now, grinning broadly, his slightly bloodshot eyes dancing.
"That's it, Sherlock. Just stop worrying. Look around. Look at us. It's going to be alright. We're together, in
“Why?”
"Um. Okay." John sat down in his chair and sipped his coffee. "I'll have to check with Aunt Aileen and make sure she's able to see us. That's rather short notice."
“Alright, sweetheart. Just calm down.” She pulls a flip phone out of her purse. “I’ll call. You go back and see how he’s doing, alright?”
Now John stirs and snuffles, nose twitching to the side in an achingly familiar way that makes Sherlock's heart and lungs do funny things, like forget how to breathe and pump blood through his body.
John cringed. He didn’t deserve that kind of respect. From anyone. “Just, John. Alright? No sir, none of that shit.”
,” Sherlock murmurs reproachfully, but unable to keep the pleased grin off his face.
“Yeah, well. That’s looking less likely by the second.” John’s mouth set into a tight line, his eyes tracking the mortuary van that was pulling up to park against a hedgerow of rose bushes, breaking several branches in the process.
He can't think of anything else to say, so he depresses the end button. He looks up at the grey streaked black sky, feeling disconnected from everything around him. Surreal. It's all so surreal. Things like this don't happen in real life. It's like a bad detective series from the 1990's, like his parents used to watch on rainy afternoons on the tiny telly in the kitchen.
?” John kisses at Sherlock’s temple, the only part of him he can reach, gets a mouthful of black curls. He laughs, because it’s all so tragically absurd. They can’t have more than a few seconds left now.
Sherlock freezes, arches his neck, blinks. “I’m your best friend?”
“Touch yourself.” John’s fingers dug into his waist, his voice rough and low with arousal.
Sherlock wakes up foggy, vaguely registering that his right arm is asleep. Blinking sleepily, and feeling unaccountably warm and well rested, he rolls over and directly into the solid form of John Watson. Memories of round two flood his synapses - Sherlock opening a bottle of wine, clothes dropping onto the floor as they drifted into the bedroom, John’s drowsy wine-red mouth pressed all over him, John's perfect little body squirming on top of him, his hands pinning Sherlock's wrists above his head, their cocks dragging against each other until they both jerked and went stiff and panted into each other's mouths and made a mess of their bellies. Sherlock recalled rolling out from under John to get a warm soapy flannel, and John taking it from him, cleaning them both with his delicate perfect hands. Sherlock kissed his neck and the end of his nose and John giggled sleepily into Sherlock's pillow until their eyelids got too heavy to look at each other any longer. They fell asleep all tangled limbs under the sheets, spent and sated.
love this game.”
“No. I don’t think I will.” Harry tilts her head, hand still on John’s knee, and catches his eye.
quietly. Sitting cross-legged in the middle of his bed, the light from his wand illuminating the small space, he unrolls the message and reads it again.
"This is going to feel different. It's not a plug, it's not narrow at the end. This will stretch you, get you ready for me. It'll hurt a bit, but you'll like that, won't you, my sweet slut?" Sherlock nods frantically. John teases the tip inside, and Sherlock tenses. John immediately changes his tone, dropping out of the more commanding octaves into his normal voice. "Sherlock. You still okay?"
that is? How few people could do that? It's bloody inhuman, Sherlock." John's voice gets progressively louder, as if by shouting he can make Sherlock believe him.
“I - I remember breakfast,” Sherlock says haltingly, trying to gather himself enough to come up with something convincing.
“You’re so beautiful.” John whispers, feeling suddenly overcome with the need to absolutely
"Well. To him we are." John shoves his hands inside the coat, pushes it off Sherlock's shoulders, and it thumps heavy on the wood floor. He starts on Sherlock's shirt buttons. "Too many fucking clothes."
John nods stiffly, holds out his hand for Lestrade to shake. “Yes, sir. Thank you.”
"Most of the time, probably, though you don't notice anymore. We'll go to Cairndow, first, anyway."
. She looked suspicious, but left without interrupting.
“Because he doesn’t like me. He likes
“Oh, I missed it. That was the cottage right behind us. Let me just - “ Sherlock turned the van carefully in the muddy gravel filled road edge and backtracked to a long narrow drive bordered with wildflowers and scrubby hedges.
"Yes, of course." Sherlock said absently, paging through Cairndow's various hotels and B&B's on the Visit Scotland website.
“Yes.”
saying anything they actually need to say.
He crosses to where Sherlock’s standing and hesitates, then there’s pressure on Sherlock’s forearm. John’s fingers touching, just that much, his thumb against the inside of Sherlock’s wrist. No one has ever put their fingers in
Sherlock peered over John’s shoulder and through branches thick with pine cones. Loch Fyne lay still and grey in the crease of the valley below, and perched on the edge of the water was a sprawling medieval revival manor, all grey stone and paneled windows. It reminded Sherlock of a castle in a children’s book - almost too picturesque. Too perfect.
He starts to laugh, and John laughs too, the sound ringing warmly through the empty room.
Sherlock parted his lips slowly, sinking his mouth down over John’s cock and undulating his tongue against the frenulum, pushing against the vein. He slid his hand out from under John’s and braced it against John’s thigh instead, steadying himself so he could bob and dip his head, pull up and twirl his tongue expertly around the head. John put both his hands in Sherlock’s hair, restless and twitching, fingers tightening against Sherlock’s scalp.
"No, it's good. Very good." John's eyes go black, his voice deepening. “I liked it.”
Time slows to a trickle as the air in the room grows thicker, the scent of their shared arousal drifting humid and heavy over them as their kisses become more heated, more needy. John sweeps his tongue along the side of Sherlock’s once more and drifts away from his mouth, nosing under his jaw and licking the thin skin, experimentally pulling it between his lips.
But there’s no laptop. No telly. Not a cord in sight.
John still says nothing. This is his part. He is patient where Sherlock is rash, quiet when Sherlock is shouting, calm when Sherlock is frantic. It's his job to be so, even when he's feeling the opposite. He'll know when and if Sherlock needs a push to speak, and until then, he waits.
“Fine. But you say
“Mmm,” John presses a hard kiss to Sherlock’s mouth and grins. “More than anything. Just you is my
John hit end, and placed his phone carefully on the dash. Within 30 seconds, it buzzed again.
It was only later, as John was breathing evenly beside him, that Sherlock found himself ruminating on how little he really knew of John's childhood. John knew virtually everything about Sherlock's. The failed public schools, the bullying, Redbeard. That the Holmeses moved out of London because of their troubled younger son, to try and give him the breathing space to thrive. John would rub Sherlock's back as he spoke, play with his curls, tell him how perfect he was to John, and how no one else's opinion mattered. Then silence. John rarely reciprocated by telling a childhood tale of his own.
“Mmmmm. It’s freezing in here.” Sherlock’s throaty morning voice rumbles against John’s vertabrae, his dry lips dragging soft over sensitive skin.
"John!" Mrs Hudson called, "There's hot lunch and coffee out here for you."
"You like your present, pet?" John strokes him lazily, not trying to bring him off, just enjoying the slide of Sherlock's velvety foreskin in his grasp.
Sherlock tears his eyes away from John’s face and follows his line of sight. James Moriarty is standing barely two metres away, twirling his wand between his fingers, head tipped innocently to the side like a curious puppy. Sherlock knows better. There’s nothing innocent about James.
“Yeah, yes, more, John,” He’s getting hard again, just thinking about John moving inside him, John claiming him like this. He’s evaporating, his skin cells floating away and getting all mixed up with John’s. He can’t think.
“Thank you.”
“Actually not.”
“Alright, boys. No fighting today, alright? I’d really like to just get this over with, and with a minimum of fuss.” John already sounds weary. He takes a cup from the coffee service Mycroft had brought in, picks up the silver carafe and pours. He holds the cup up to his mouth and blows a breath across it, rippling the surface. His eyes flick up to meet Sherlock’s.
John’s sentence ended in a strangled inhalation, his hips jerking up off the bed as he ground his head back into the pillows. Sherlock felt his entire body trembling, tightening, and he crooked the two fingers that were inside him, simultaneously tonguing at his frenulum with the quick little licks that drove John mad with pleasure.
"I know you think vanilla is a funny safeword, but that's important. If you need me to stop, it needs to be something we'll both recognise as out of the moment we're in, okay?"
Their whole life together is rearranging itself, far too quickly for John to comprehend. It's all been so harmonious until now, their arrangement. John falling naturally into his role as leader, caretaker. Sherlock looking to him for comfort, guidance in the ways of relationships and love and sex; the areas of the world Sherlock wasn't an expert in. It's been easy.
“Yeah.”
Sherlock lets out a howl of frustration, and whirls away from John, banging on the sides of his head with his palms. "But you keep acting like its just me! Pretending you get nothing out of this, and that's so goddamned untrue! You love this. You
Sherlock teased his hand under the elastic waistband and traced his fingertips through soft hair until he found velvet skin, blood hot and half hard. He trailed two fingers down John's length, then over the inside of his thigh, the slightly damp crease of his groin. John moaned low in his chest, the vibration rumbling through his sternum and into Sherlock's palm.
“Yeah. I spent all June and July volunteering at St Mungo’s this summer. It was amazing. What Healers can do - I want to be like that. Help people.”
Sherlock swigged at John's scotch, watching as John methodically undid the buckles, opened the kilt and wrapped it around his waist. It fit him like it was made for him. It sat perfectly at the top of his iliac crest, accentuating the sweep of his pelvic bones, the sinewy lines of his hips. The hem just brushed the middle of his knees, making his already beautifully shaped legs look even more like he'd just swaggered off a rugby pitch. The dominant colour in the tartan was a rich forest green, which set off his skin tone and brought out the ginger traces in his blonde hair.
“I’m sorry if this is - I just
He doesn’t even move from the floor for nearly an hour after Mycroft’s head disappears, leaving behind a cold grate filled with ashes, and an empty ache in the pit of Sherlock’s stomach. After twenty minutes or so, Alchemy comes skittering down the hallway, sensing Sherlock’s distress, and leaps deftly onto his shoulder, curls up, and paws comfortingly at Sherlock’s neck.
“No, but I
“Go to sleep, John.”
“Jesus fucking Christ, Sherlock.”
“I would forgive you anything,” I said automatically.
“Molly?” John echoes, looking both worried and perplexed. “
"Then help us prove it. You can't clear him if we have no proof."
“Not really.” Sherlock pulls the canvases back in place and leads John down the cracked tile steps. The tube station is damp, being right next to the river, and a bit mouldy, but it’s familiar. Welcome. It’s been a hell of a long day.
“Take his hand. Let him know you’re here.”
Sherlock soothed over the reddish mark with his tongue and kissed it. “In a good way or a bad way?”
“Not really.”
someone.”
John closes his hand around Sherlock’s achingly hard cock and strokes him gently, rubbing his thumb in a circle around the head and then firmly against his frenulum, tracing the edge of his foreskin. Sherlock exhales tremulously and thrusts his hips up into John’s fist.
“No one’s coming in, and yes, I can handle it.
“What I mean to say is that we’ve not witnessed anything.” Sherlock said smoothly, changing tactics.
, it was Mycroft, most definitely. Probably in one of those awful skin tight jogging outfits he has. Can you imagine the
Yeah, I'll try. I just kind of want to get back to normal, you know?
“But…”
Maddeningly slowly, John begins to move again, his back muscles undulating beautifully under Sherlock’s splayed out fingers. He kisses Sherlock’s throat, and mouth, and earlobes, rubs the welcome roughness of his moustache against Sherlock’s cheeks and nipples, and doesn’t speed up. Sherlock’s heels bounce loosely against John’s lower back as he stretches and writhes, exhaling slow and deep, allowing his entire body to flood with molten pleasure. His thighs are beginning to tremble.
“Sherlock Holmes, same address as Dr. Watson.”
Sherlock tucks his hands behind his head and stares up at the canopy, mentally running through the possibilities.
"John, stop for a second." Sherlock's hands tighten around his, stilling them, trying to get his attention, and John looks from his scarf to his face, which is solemn, far too solemn.
"No, baby. I don't." John could see Sherlock was in the mood to have his dom, to be John’s little poppet, his good boy. Alright then. He smoothed his hand over Sherlock's hair, fingers falling to his ear. He rubbed the lobe between his thumb and index finger, knowing Sherlock's earlobes were a particularly sensitive spot, and watched with satisfaction as Sherlock's eyes fell closed and he nudged his face into John's touch. "What good boy you are, my sweet one. No corrections. I'm looking forward to something much more interesting tonight. I've been going spare since I got home, waiting for you. What took so damned long?"
They shine golden and glittering in the mid-morning sunshine, a stray curl blowing across his forehead, and John's heart gives a leap. Always so beautiful, even when he doesn't mean to be.
"I, uh, accidentally hit the button. Left it open in my pocket. It's off now." His voice is shaking. He should never have come here. No one will even hear what Jim has to say, and he's fucked, he's so fucked. He can think of nothing suddenly except John standing alone in the kitchen reading his note. John forever alone, because Sherlock is so monumentally stupid that he believed for a moment that he could outwit Jim Moriarty, and now he's trapped. Jim is more than capable of killing him right here and now.
Sherlock swallows, feeling sick at himself. He looks at the crumpled note on the floor, John’s balled up shirt, and thinks of the day they met, which seems years ago. John, golden and shining, huge blue eyes and an even bigger smile, bringing Sherlock sobriety and love and hope. Now he’s furious and disappointed and in danger, and it’s all Sherlock’s fault.
"Oh fuck." John's already spotted it, he's backing up.
Even Sherlock bursts out laughing.
“If he puts a hand on you, I’ll kill him.” John’s lips brush Sherlock’s earlobe as he pulls back, his eyes as rough and untamed as a summer storm.
isn’t anything connecting?
John sucks in a hard breath, head swimming, and grabs at the table with his free hand to anchor himself. “Jesus.”
“Necessary to be so dramatic about it, John?” Sherlock said with a tentative smile, handing John the cold tea.
going to stop making him crazy, and waves the condom in Sherlock's face again. "Not a virgin for much longer."
"I'll just get the coffees, then." He hates how his voice tremors. Hates how transparent he is. Because god, Sherlock has to know, he has to and he's never said. Course John hasn't either. It's just become ridiculous now. How much he wants. How his thoughts are consumed by wondering about the smell of Sherlock's hair and what his skin would taste like and the sound of his voice gone husky and gasping
He pulled into a parking spot at the back of the hotel and ducked his head down against the swirling snow. He was half frozen and numb by the time he got into the hotel lobby, but he couldn’t be bothered to care.
John chokes out a little sob that hits Sherlock hard, somewhere in the middle of his chest. John's eyes tight shut, one hand in his mouth, one fisted in the sheets next to his head, he looks on the verge of tears. His hand lands heavy on Sherlock’s head, smoothing over his hair, fingertips brushing the top of his ear. He can barely speak, whispers in a low husky voice, “
“No, it’s fine, it’s fine.” He whispers, not even knowing what he’s saying, hardly able to believe that she’s real.
"No more lying, Sherlock."
"Sherlock Holmes." John pulls his lips away from Sherlock's neck long enough to take his face firmly between his hands and look in his eyes. "Look at me. You are the most spectacularly beautiful creature I have ever seen. You make my fucking heart skip a beat every time I look at you. You are exquisite. Your mouth, your eyes, your goddamned amazing neck that I am going to cover with bite marks so everyone knows you're finally mine.
Sherlock closes the door quietly behind him, and John listens to his rapid footfalls down the steps, to the front door opening and slamming shut. Have to slam it for it to stay shut, John thinks numbly.
“Nor I, John.” Sherlock’s voice wavers, breaks with a quiet intensity that makes John tilt his head back enough to look into those changeable green eyes.
He snaps his head up, stares at the old woman. She’s got steel in her glare, and it’s directed at him. “You are not allowed to fall apart. He needs you. Get yourself together.”
The stars are out by the time Sherlock makes his way to Hackney Downs.
"Yeah. I don't want to be gawked at like a fucking monkey at the zoo." John forced himself not to flip off his audience, pressed his palm against Sherlock's palm and pulled him toward the door. "Come on, we're getting drenched."
"Yes. Same." Sherlock is stunning like this, and wholly new. John's never seen his eyes so alight, his skin glowing and flushed, a smile constantly playing at the edges of his mouth.
A migraine. That’s what he must have. His head is pounding, a dull constant throb behind his eyes and down his spine. His throat aches, feels dry and raw. He struggles to remember - did he fall asleep on the sofa again? Did Sherlock put him to bed? Where
John's suddenly got a case of first date nerves. His stomach flutters. "Hi."
A stillness moves through them, hands heavy on each other’s waists, their feet and ankles entangled. John’s ankle bone is digging into the soft fleshy part of Sherlock’s calf. He doesn’t ask him to move. They just breathe into each other’s spaces, listening to the creaks and groans of the house, the quiet hum of the traffic out front. It’s like being suspended in a dream.
“Thank you, I am aware. This is the result of sleeping in one’s office for several weeks and not consuming anything but chips and butterbeer for nearly as long. Things are dire, Sherlock.”
“Oi! John Watson, open this goddamned door, it’s your sister!”
"While I very much appreciate the sentiment, John, I assure you I have already taken care of that." Sherlock puts his hand over John's chest, where white tendrils of scar tissue snake down his pectoral and over the swell of his shoulder, "Look. We both have scars."
to talk about it. He wanted John's breath and skin. He wanted his smells and his sweat and his shaking body underneath him. He wanted to touch every part of John with his mouth and his hands and forget that they were two separate people who sometimes didn't understand each other.
“You want to - like this - or - ” John pants, reaching a hand down between his own legs. His breath stutters, catches, as his hips jerk. “Because…”
He whines, not meaning to, and John pulls off, nuzzles at Sherlock’s sweat damp skin, drags his moustache along the insides of his thighs.
“Okay. I’ll just go round the corner and burn one, alright?” Sherlock tries to hide the hurt in his eyes as he shakes a cigarette loose, and obviously doesn’t succeed, because John’s hand closes around his wrist as he starts to walk away.
“It’s really alright. It’s fine.” Sherlock tries, backpedaling.
“No.” Relief floods through him as he says it, realising it’s true. He’s got a little more time, a little more of this before he reenters hell.
“So good, baby, so good.” John slips a hand into the staggering heat between Sherlock’s legs and palms his cock, murmuring encouragement between licks at the stiff pebbled flesh in his mouth.
“Oh, John! You’re awake!” Sherlock’s voice sounds beyond exhausted, shaky and hoarse with emotion. There’s the sound of styrofoam squeaking, ice shaking round in a cup, something being set on a table. “You’ve been in and out all night.”
The money was miraculously still there. He scraped the contents of the box into a grimy reuseable Sainsbury's bag that he'd found stuffed in the end of his sleeping bag and then wrapped the bag in a ragged black hoodie. He stared for many minutes longer than he should have at the milk carton overturned on his heroin. He
"Oh god, okay, yeah," John says, restless, rubbing his hips in little circles while the tension pulls his bollocks up tight to his body and he has to remember how to talk without any air in his lungs. "I was on Sarah's sofa and I kept - kept thinking of you on
She didn’t flinch at the word boyfriend, doesn’t look surprised. John must have been out to her, they must be close. Sherlock realises he really doesn’t know. He didn’t even know her name. John is still effectively a stranger to him in a lot of ways, ways that suddenly hurt. Now faced with Harry, a sister, someone who’s known John his whole life, Sherlock is drowning in his own inadequacy.
He has no idea what to do. No real idea what Harry and John talked about during the night, or what effect it will have on their life together. In all fairness, Sherlock's never known, never had a clear path forward in life. His mother used to call him
“Please, what, my love? Tell me. Tell me
"Prat."
“If you say so, John.”
“Of course.” Sherlock shimmies out of the booth, unfolding his long legs somewhat clumsily, and affection swells warm through John, making him sigh as he smiles up at Sherlock looking down at him. Sherlock’s nose crinkles up and he pauses mid-step. “What?”
"I don't know about that." John grumbles, but his mouth is already cracking into that almost constant grin. "Tomorrow, dammit."
“You were the best and wisest man that I've ever known. Of
“I know you said you don’t want to talk about it,” Molly says tentatively, hours later, as they’re sitting cross-legged on the common room floor with a game of Wizard Chess between them. She takes a deep breath and looks up at Sherlock, the glow of the dying embers in the fireplace making long shadows across her face. “But I think John likes you.”
“So. Lester. Here’s the deal. We’re gonna eat lunch. Then I’m going to leave, five minutes before you. I’m going to go sit in my car, and wait until you come out. I’ll follow you to your house, and we’re going to check it over for bugs and cameras before we say one goddamned word, yeah?”
"How do you know I'm not with someone already?" John arches an eyebrow, his voice husky.  He really couldn't be more seductive if he tried. Sherlock's absolutely aching for him, his lower belly heavy and hot with desire. He wants to bend him over the bar, push him up against the wall of glass shelves behind, listen to the bottles crashing around them while Sherlock fucks him.
“What would you say now, John? If you were dying.” Sherlock’s voice breaks on John’s name.
Often, even now, John can’t take his eyes off Sherlock. He physically can’t tear his eyes away, his gaze trapped in Sherlock’s orbit as strongly as the pull of the earth to the sun. Even now that he’s allowed to look all he wants, allowed to stare at the curves of that perfect mouth and imagine any number of deliciously wicked activities to keep it busy. Even now that if he’s caught staring, he just grins and Sherlock grins back and anyone who’s within a ten metre radius knows exactly what they’re both thinking about.
Sherlock rocks up on his knees as well as he can with his arms bound, moans and pushes his arse back. John gives him a hard slap across his left cheek, leaving a deep pink handprint and making Sherlock whimper and close his eyes. "Don't be greedy. You'll get fucked good and hard soon enough. And I told you to keep your eyes open."
“No need to be sorry, love.” While he is most definitely the dominant personality in this relationship, at least most of the time, John never wants Sherlock to fear him, to feel cowed or subjugated. “I’m just taking care of you, and you need to mind me. That's all. Are you going to mind me, Sherlock?”
“I want more - “ Sherlock’s sticky hands slip up under John’s shirt, bold and possessive.
John gasped brokenly, licked hot and wet at Sherlock’s mouth as he rocked into Sherlock’s fist. “I know, love, I know. Oh, you feel so good. God, your
“So it would seem.” Sherlock pauses and leans forward, lowering his voice. “What do you need with me?”
“Well. Then we’ll get it for you, and then we won’t have to worry about it later. Can we go there, to Jim’s,” John spits out the name with no small amount of disgust, which settles warmly into Sherlock’s gut, having John loathe Jim so entirely on his behalf, “this time of day?”
“Rachael. Rachael Finley.” Lightburn stopped at the closed door, her hand on the knob. “You ready?”
"It's overwhelming, I know. Feels like it could all slip away so easily." John rubs his nose back and forth against Sherlock's shoulder, traces his fingers over the rise of Sherlock's hipbone. John's touch is already so familiar, so natural. He couldn't bear to ever live without it again.
The look John tosses over his shoulder as he disappears into the bathroom could melt sand into glass. Sherlock rolls and looks at the clock. Barely six. Back when they were what they used to be, more than friends but less than this, Sherlock would listen to John getting up for work at the clinic. Six on the dot every morning, John’s feet would hit the wooden floorboards of his bedroom, and Sherlock would try to find a way to look like he was doing anything except waiting to watch John walk down the steps in just his pants, dressing gown slung over his arm, his hair messy and rumpled.
“Alright, then. No need for apologies.”
He took John’s face between both his hands and leaned forward until their noses were almost touching. John’s eyes shifted away, and Sherlock tightened his grip on his head, digging his fingertips into John’s scalp just enough to get his attention.
“I was just trying to give you something to look at, Weasley.” John winks at her, all sparkling blue eyes and white teeth.
"No, I never thought that." Sherlock shakes his head violently, unable to think clearly, to formulate a plan. Terror is flooding through him, his only goal to get John safe somehow, get John out of there.
“Right. So, John Watson, um, address is 221B Baker Street, London, NW1 6XE.”
“John.” He spins around, looking much more himself than he’s been in days, no longer bedraggled and exhausted, and emerging from his subspace as well.
capable of processing human speech. I made it through medical school and everything. I’ll just take notes if I get confused, shall I?”
Sherlock slowed the movements of his tongue, pulled off and ran his mouth down the side of John’s cock as he pushed a second finger into him and swept his fingertips across his prostate. He knew after three years together the exact combination of mouth and fingers that would make John absolutely undone.
“Shhhh. That’s it,” John says again, quietly, as he presses a kiss against Sherlock’s forehead. “I know you’ve barely slept the whole time I was in hospital. Just relax, love.”
, yes,” John’s face is bright crimson, thick black eyelashes fluttering beautifully against his cheeks as he gasps. He grabs at the empty places in the counter where the sinks should be, tilts up onto his toes and wriggles his arse against Sherlock’s fingers. “Put those goddamned pretty fingers in me.”
Mrs Hudson pushes the door open and the smell of something carroty and savory wafts over them.
. John’s voice reverberates in him, pleading and insistent. Those enormous eyes silently begging him to assent.
"Well, we're even then, ‘cause I didn't either."
John presses a tender kiss there before kneeling up and reaching over Sherlock’s belly into the bedside drawer. Sherlock sucks in a long shuddering breath and trails his fingertips up and down the outside of John’s thigh almost absentmindedly. He looks destroyed, the hair framing his face soaked with sweat, the dark flush of arousal mottling his pale skin, his eyes unfocused, mouth lax, lips puffy. The expression of rapt adoration on his face as he watches John fumbling like an idiot in the drawer for the lube is heartbreaking.
. This is ridiculous.
Their eyes meet. Sherlock's freckled green eyes are emerald bright in the white winter sunshine, his stare intense. John's belly tingles. Sherlock's tongue darts out and traces the line of his bottom lip. His coal black lashes flutter, blinking under John's unwavering gaze.
Sherlock pressed his tongue into the vein, swept the tip in circles around the head, pumping his hand along the saliva soaked length of John's prick. He took him deep as John's fingers tightened against his scalp, working the tip of his cock with his throat, and John immediately pulled at his hair. Sherlock swallowed around John's cock, slid his hand down to cradle his bollocks, and John positively keened.

“Oh my god, alright, but you don’t
“Honestly, I just don’t believe it.” It shouldn’t mean this much to him. It’s just a hunk of metal, made to hurt, made for killing. But somehow, everything that was John Watson is embedded in its scarred surface. The army doctor, the soldier, the muscle in the operation, Sherlock’s protector - everything that made him who he used to be, it’s right here, heavy in his palm.
for a job in the Muggle world. He goes home to a world where magic is unfathomable, where he’s even more out of place than usual. Being away from Hogwarts aches, like a gaping wound in his chest. It’s a relief to be headed back.
- can you handle three? Or should I - ”
, John. I didn’t need to sleep. I needed to solve the
“Shhhhh, that’s it. Go to sleep.” John kisses his temple, over and over.
"I thought we were taking it slow?" John laughs, but starts unbuttoning his jeans anyway.
He lets his tongue linger on his thumb just long enough that John’s neck goes hot.
The last thing Sherlock needs is his friends nosing about trying to get information about the Ministry, today of all days. No, it’s best Mike forget the whole thing.
“What? What?” Sherlock bends over, panicked beyond the capacity to be rational. He’s shaking from head to foot.
.” John said against Sherlock’s throat, and then his ear. “Beautiful. Breagha. You’re so beautiful.”
John turns the volume up, rocks up to kneeling, shuffles over to Sherlock and noses against his ear. "You aren't paying a bit of attention to me. I could do anything to you right now."
“Yeah.”
Right. Need to interject, stop Sherlock before he really gets rolling. “Sherlock. Sweetheart. I don’t have a skull fracture. I promise you. I don’t.”
Lestrade clears his throat when Sherlock doesn't say anything. "So. Do you have anything solid for me, or what?"
Sherlock's face was relaxed, but his eyes shone fever bright. His entire body mottled purple with arousal, blood smeared on his legs and somehow across his stomach, his cock standing hard and flushed, a bead of milky precome at the slit. John fought back the urge to lick it off, wanting to consume every part of Sherlock he possibly could.
aware how insular he is, how little he does anything but work. He knows, god he
"I just. I wanted to make sure he wouldn't - "
John rubs the back of his head a little and laughs again, “I don’t give a shit, it’s fine. Just come
"I am. I really am.”
“That’s true.”
“Christ, if you could see yourself right now, Sherlock. You are
“I’m Harry, I’m Johnny’s sister.” Her hip cocks to the side, and her mouth purses in a way that reminds Sherlock viscerally of John. Same eyes, same expressions, same self assuredness. They’re tough, these Watsons. “The hospital called me. What’s
“Caring is not an advantage, Sherlock.”
“John. We can’t...we can’t stay here indefinitely.” Sherlock hates bringing it up, watching John’s face crumple, his brow furrow down. But it has to be said. “Yesterday was wonderful, an incredible dream...but. You can’t possibly go home, and I don’t think I would be welcomed back with open arms, either. And we have no way to make money, except…”
A sob rose up in Sherlock’s throat at the sight of John in a grey jumper striding across the parking lot of a run down motel. He was lean, beautiful. His hair so different, in little messy spikes. He was so thin. Thinner than Sherlock had ever seen him. His cheekbones stood out, his square jaw more prominent than ever. Even in these distant photos, those deep blue eyes looked bigger, taking over his face.
. Mycroft’s snide, presumptuous voice echoes in his mind.
The spark of suspicion was growing into a flame. Flickering and weak, but a flame of hope nonetheless. For the first time in months, he felt something like himself. There was a hint of John Watson, peering out from deep inside. If Sherlock was alive, oh god. He could barely allow himself to think the words.
“Yeah, come for me now, love, it’s going to feel so good. Let me feel it, come on,” John pants, right on the very edge of orgasm, his entire body tight and quivering like an overplayed violin string about to snap.
“It won’t be.”
. Open your eyes for me.” John says his name reverently, as though it’s a rare thing, a locked away treasure in a secret cupboard. His moustache tickles at Sherlock’s earlobe.
“I am, though. Aren’t I? Still?” He doesn’t move, his thigh slung across Sherlock’s lower belly, his arm wrapped around his chest.
"Sorry, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to...No one's ever -- no one's ever let me do that before. I just..." John fades out as Sherlock's lips close over the head of his cock, tongue pressing into his frenulum. "Oh fuck, Sherlock, fuck oh god."
“No. Why would I be angry with you?”
Sherlock sighed and breathed out through his mouth like he was exhaling smoke. He came into the kitchen, unhesitatingly reached for John's hand and pressed his thumb into the hollow of John's wrist. "That's
He reaches between them and strokes Sherlock's throat with one finger for a moment, tugs at the top button of his shirt. Sherlock nods, without taking his tongue out of John's mouth. One button at a time, slow and fumbling because he's not looking, John gets Sherlock's entire shirt undone and begins to tug it off his shoulders. Sherlock sits up to help him, and their teeth clang together. Sherlock laughs around John's tongue, and there's no reason in the world that should make John want to cry, but it does. Tears well up and John lets them, laughing back, and kisses Sherlock's bottom lip, and pushes his shirt off.
The room is semi-private, but the second bed is unoccupied. Someone’s put the telly on, football match droning in the background. The curtain’s drawn half round the bed, and Sherlock can’t actually see John at first, just the outline of his calves and feet under the blanket. He pulls back the curtain as quietly as he can, mindful not to wake him if he’s sleeping. John looks so tiny. So small and fragile and white, laying against baby blue sheets, his face turned towards the window and away from Sherlock. He stops dead, paralysed by his conflicting instincts to both run away and also crawl on top of John and hold him so tight his arms go numb. He can’t move, can’t speak, just stands there, hand still gripping the edge of the soft cotton curtain.
Will you marry me?
“Just, like...really glad I decided to eat that sandwich in that alley yesterday. For a lot of reasons.”
John can’t help nibbling at his lip as he returns Sherlock’s heated gaze. “You are an absolutely incurable flirt, Sherlock Holmes. You keep it up, I’m going to end up shagging you right over this table.”
The kiss was deep and purposeful, his tongue dipping in and out of my mouth rhythmically, mimicking the way he fucked me. A shudder wracked me at the thought, and I felt him smiling against my mouth. He was always so proud of how I responded to him, how visceral was my need. It was true that he rendered me helpless, my brain and all my logic washed away in a flood of chemical reactions over which I had no control. I was most utterly and joyfully at his mercy.
During term, they hadn’t talked about much except chemistry, really, though John looked forward to their study sessions much more than was probably normal. Sherlock gave John a confidence in himself that he’d never had, simply by his presence alone.
“What are you doing?”
- and pads barefoot into the kitchen.
Sherlock shifts and sinks into John, hums contentedly. John’s eyes finally feel heavy. Just as he’s drifting off, Sherlock’s full lips sweep gently and purposefully across his jaw.
Thus, the amount of petroleum jelly we went through in a month’s time was high enough to raise eyebrows, should it become known. We were careful to shop at different chemists each time, and I often used one of my many disguises in order to not be recognised. John particularly liked the times when I had dressed up as a young lady, bodice, stockings, and the whole kit; his hands sneaking indelicately up my skirts in the cab on the way home, his face pressing against my powdered throat as he whispered
He should never have held back, he should have just -
, people that understood and appreciated his extraordinary abilities. It was exhilarating.
Finally his muscles are no longer out of his control, except for a sudden jerk of aftershocks now and then. He breathes deep, supported on shaking arms, and looks down at Sherlock, who's covered in come and sweat and tears, and looks utterly blissful.
“It’s okay, John, it’s fine,” Sherlock threaded the fingers that had been on John’s neck up through his hair, and cradled his head against his chest. “I can’t either...I’m so…”
"You believe me?"
“Oh, Sherlock, fuck, god, you feel so good, you’re so
Sherlock reaches down, palms up, and John takes his hands, lets himself be pulled up to standing. Standing quickly after laying down for hours makes his head swim and he wraps his arms around Sherlock’s waist to steady himself. Sherlock responds immediately, smoothing his hands up John’s back with a throaty hum and pulling him against his chest. Their height difference is always the most obvious in this position, John’s head fitted perfectly into the gentle curve of Sherlock’s neck and shoulder, smelling Sherlock’s deodorant, their laundry soap, the lingering scent of garlic and peppers from cooking.
“I love you, too,” Sherlock whispered back, running a finger slow against John’s throat. “Are you going back to sleep?”
He dialed, dragged on his cigarette hard, and blew the smoke out the open window.
"I know that." Sherlock's lips brush over his chin, tongue dipping into the cleft.
You have no idea.” John runs his hand all over Sherlock’s chest, the taste of his come still strong in his mouth. John’s so hard he thinks it might actually kill him if he doesn’t come soon, but he doesn’t want to rush Sherlock, who seems to be essentially unconscious. He takes off Sherlock’s pants and trousers, which had still been rucked around his calves, and drops them to the floor, then kisses Sherlock’s belly - sweaty, delicious - and up over his chest, until he closes his lips over Sherlock’s thumping heartbeat in his neck and begins to suck.
Sherlock shakes his head and puts John’s fingers to his lips, kisses the cool metal band.
Sherlock doesn't argue that he shouldn't be embarrassed. Doesn't protest that he didn't fuck up the case. He knows those things are true, and Sherlock won't coddle him and tell him they're not.

The movement in front of him solidifies into a person shape, as Jim slinks his way out of the darkness, wrinkling his nose and wiping his mouth delicately with his index finger.
Jim goes deadly still. He doesn't blink. Those flat brown-black eyes stare unwaveringly into Sherlock's verdigris ones.
“Not just yet.” The man leaned back and folded his hands in his lap. “I’ve done some research on you, Captain John H. Watson.”
When they walk into Speedy's to order their fried eggs and toast, their fingers are securely twisted together and they kiss while they wait for the food, Sherlock leaning over the table to press his mouth to John's while he twines his ankle around John’s calf, and they smirk at each other and don’t speak, because there’s no need, because whatever walls existed between them no longer do, because it was always about this, always about
Sherlock is breathing very fast, his nostrils flaring and his jaw working in a rapid tight circles. John waits. And waits. Sherlock is breathing so fast it's becoming a bit worrisome. John wants to apologise, take it back, tell Sherlock it's fine, it's all fine. They can carry on as before, it doesn't have to change anything --
“What is it, Sherlock?” Molly moves towards him, her eyes on the letter.
“What are
“Ah, you’re so
He couldn’t bear to see John cry. Swooping down and wiping the tear away with his thumb, Sherlock kissed him again, murmuring into his mouth, “It’s alright, it’s alright.”
“Feeling rested, my dear?”
it. I can feel how badly you want everything I'm going to do to you. God, you're amazing. What a little tart. So desperate for it."
"Anything else?"
No one except John has ever been randomly kind to Sherlock before. She’s another miracle of John, of his presence in Sherlock's life; this woman in her silken scarf and patterned dress, her heels and pearls, out for a day of sightseeing and instead...she's here in this hospital, with John's blood on her arm and helping Sherlock outside to smoke.
have control over what colour my hair is." John turned and looked at Sherlock, trying to look irritated but coming off rather more affectionately exasperated than anything else.
Oh fuck, oh fuck. He was going to throw up again. His skin erupted in goosepimples, his scalp went cold. Everything was shaking. This was too much, he didn’t know how to process this. Tears were already seeping from his closed eyes, hot down his cheeks. This was the most overwhelmed he’d ever felt in his life. This was worse than being in the middle of a firefight. At least he knew what to do then, with a gun hitched on his shoulder and a vest over his fatigues. That was adrenaline and instinct. This. This was uncharted territory.
“Cigarettes. And you’re wrong. They smell
"I think I need a nap." He mumbled, as Sherlock pushed him onto the bed by his shoulders and laid him back.
John's tongue darted out and he pulled on his lower lip with his teeth, his eyes dancing with amusement. "I'm not even going to bother asking why."
John begins to tremble, his cock thickening. “Yeah, yeah, oh god, I’m so close. You are so beautiful, Christ, you are absolutely - oh fuck - oh, god, I’m right there - “
“Good,” John murmured, and began to finger me in earnest.
John stops talking and dips down, presses a soft closed mouth kiss to Sherlock’s lips. He begins to pull away far too soon. Sherlock twines his arm around the back of John’s head, and holds him there. John hums and acquiesces, sinks down against Sherlock’s chest and swipes his tongue along the rim of Sherlock’s lower lip. They stay that way, slowly kissing, breathing each other in, the hot fires of arousal cindered down into this warm give and take. John’s thumb never stops slowly stroking Sherlock’s cheek.
Greg clears his throat, “They’re not going to be any good today. Just. Let them have their - just let them alone, alright? It’s been five years coming, Sally. Give them a few hours.”
“Me. Yeah.” John huffs a laugh, drains the rest of his beer.
“I do.”
“Now it’s very clear.” Kiss him again. Gentle. Slow. Lips pliant and sweet. John’s hand at the small of his back. Sherlock pulls away this time. “We should go. Get it over with.”
“On my computer.” Sherlock tries to sound offended, but he turns the water on and lathers up his hands anyway.
I let him slip from my mouth and looked up, suddenly aware of how wet my face had become, with saliva and sweat and
“Good. Me too.” John runs the flannel cursorily over himself and tosses it in the direction of the hamper.
"Mrs Hudson would get a kick out of seeing us like this."
A shaft of lazy summer sunlight cutting a swath across a cluttered kitchen, Sherlock’s curls framing his face like a halo. The dust sifting through the light. A woman’s voice, familiar and comforting.
"Please Sherlock. Please. I need you so bad. Please, please..." John knew he was babbling, begging, but he couldn't be arsed to care. He was nothing but need, want, the ache for Sherlock's body against his, their blood and saliva and come mixing together, skin cells rubbing off on each other. He didn’t care about anything except
"I love you, John. No one else could ever take care of me the way you do." Sherlock nuzzles his face into John's pectoral, brushes his lips over his skin.
The little nub of flesh grows harder under Sherlock’s tongue, and he flicks at it gently, enjoying listening to John’s long drawn out moans. He nibbles, rolls pebbled skin between his teeth, and John's breath catches as his fingers tighten in Sherlock's hair. John pushes at his head, just lightly, but the intent is clear.
“Even now?” Sherlock asks, trying to sound playful, and only succeeding in sounding achingly eager.
John falls into pace beside him as they jog down the stairs. Jim’s watching them. He can feel his glare on the back of his neck like sunburn. He’s never going to let Sherlock have the last word. Never.
"No. You know what? That was an awful, shitty, cruel thing to say. That was fucked. I shouldn’t have said that to you, Sherlock.  I'm sorry. I thought about that a lot, you know. That that was basically the last thing I said to your face...
The smell of Sherlock’s hair after he’s smoked one, thinking John wouldn’t know. Even at a distance, passing behind him as he made a cup of tea or sat at some experiment, John could smell his shampoo mixed with that tobacco smell, and he would shake his head and laugh to himself. Silly Sherlock. Quirky, funny, ridiculous Sherlock. Clever, infuriating Sherlock. Dead Sherlock.
"No, love. What are you doing? Don't turn it off. I wasn't --" John's lips against his pulse now, but not overtly sexual, just warm, gentle, the feeling a glowing light inside Sherlock not unlike the presence of John himself. "Read your book. Read it to me."
“With me.” Harry says with certainty, her eyes fixed on Sherlock instead of her brother. “You’d both be with me. Obviously.”
, they stop and look at each other, and John says,
Before he can stop himself, the question tumbles out of him again. “So why don’t you? Say you love me?”
It was no good, he couldn’t stay awake. As he slipped back into unconsciousness, he felt fingers threading through his own and squeezing. He tried to squeeze back, but he couldn’t. Couldn't do anything except give in to the pull of the blackness behind his eyes.
“Can we?” Sherlock knew he sounded like a wheedling child, trying to get an extra sweet out of an indulgent parent.
And suddenly it feels much more like a date.
“You don’t have any idea who Oliver Wood is, do you?”
He shifts and slides up onto the sofa next to John. John's all over him the second they're at eye level, pulling Sherlock's face to his own, biting at his lower lip and nibbling down his jaw. Sherlock doesn't argue this time, allows John to slip his hand under the waistband of his jeans, pop the button open with his thumb. He raises his hips and wriggles until they're pushed down tight against his thighs. John's gasping against his mouth as he teases his fingers inside Sherlock's soft cotton pants and trails them over the hardness he finds there. Sherlock's breath catches in his chest, tight with affection and the ache of regret at what he has to do tonight.
“You haven’t kissed me like that - in ages -” John’s shoulders heave up and down while he tries to get air.
There's something simmering in the room now, the air charged. It feels to John as though they're in a roller coaster car, teetering right at the summit of the most brilliantly terrifying drop. There is no way back except to fall, no way forward except the same. His hands are shaking on his coffee cup.
Sherlock tilted his chin, brushed those beautiful plump lips against John’s. John could feel his eyelashes fluttering against Sherlock’s cheekbone as their heads moved sideways so they could kiss more deeply. Sherlock’s tongue flicked lightly against the seam of John’s lips, and he parted them, meeting Sherlock’s tongue with his own. His scalp tingled as their mouths moved against each other, shivering at Sherlock's fingers roaming up his spine, gathering him close. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s shoulders and pulled himself up on his toes, their height difference even more pronounced with John in bare feet and Sherlock still in his shoes. John nosed along Sherlock’s jaw and buried his face in his neck. Sherlock hummed a contentedly, and John squeezed him even more tightly.
“If they want to talk to you, you play the unsuspecting victim. You have no idea why they targeted you. Don’t even suggest mistaken identity. Just nothing. They’re stupid, like Lestrade and Anderson and Donovan. They need a
He starts moving before he’s even realised he’s doing it, twitching his shoulders, rolling his hips a little. John presses up behind him, a hand possessively wrapped around his waist. Lips against his ear, “Sherlock. You know I can’t fucking dance at all, right?”
John slaps him across the bum, laughing, and Sherlock calls him a prat and pins his hands above his head, so John flips Sherlock flat on his back, both of them giggling uncontrollably, and neither one of them is sure when the play fighting and wrestling turns back into kissing, but soon they're both very distracted from the idea of showering and eating and Sherlock wraps his hand around them both and squeezes and pulls and John sucks another bruise out on Sherlock's neck right before they both come all over Sherlock's fist and collapse panting next to each other.
He fiddled with the Sherlock’s watch, thumbing over the crack. He wished it would slice his thumb open, make him bleed. He was fascinated by blood, guessed he always had been a bit, being a doctor. Doctors had to be a little blood hungry, or the job would be unbearable. But it was deeper now, transformed. He would get mesmerised by the blood on his hands after he beat someone; the split skin, the cracks at the edges of scrapes from missing skull and hitting brick instead, how it dried in brown streams down his wrists. How it dried in the creases of his knuckles and didn’t come out for days.
John’s warm hands slide up over his biceps and the sides of his neck, feather light touches over his ears, and then strong fingers are twining in his hair and pulling lightly. Sherlock can't quite hold down a breathy shaking moan.
“Oh John, John, John…” Sherlock sobbed out, and came, pulsing wet and gorgeous into John, let go of his hair and wrapped his arms around him, hips rocking shallowly until he finally slowed. John laid his arms over Sherlock’s on his belly, let him whimper and huff against his back, until his head was so heavy with endorphins that he couldn’t stay upright anymore.
. You belong to me. You can stick your dick in every shining little choirboy that comes along, but you will
He supposes every student must feel like Hogwarts is truly home, whilst still at school, but he knows Muggleborns feel it more acutely. Children of Wizarding families leave between terms and go to homes filled with spellbooks and brooms, magical creatures, shelves overflowing with potion bottles. While they’re still not permitted to perform their own magic, at least they’re surrounded by it.
John huffed, a knowing smile on his face. “That was a
“I’m supposed to take care of you.” He rested his forehead against Sherlock's, stroked his legs gently from ankle to thigh.
“Ah, glad I’m not the only Luddite around.” Lightburn smiled at John again, pen poised to write. “Now I do have to take down your information. But it’s only a formality, I’m sure we’ll never need to bother you.”
"Don't you dare. I'm not ashamed of you, so you're not allowed to be either. You hear me?" John kisses him again, then his chin and his eyes, his forehead.
John just stares at him. Sherlock stares back, unsure of what’s about to happen. Time feels suspended.
"I'm going to unbuckle your hands now. You can hold on to the bed or whatever you need to." John gently unbuckles the cuffs and rubs his hands up Sherlock's arms as they fall limply to his sides.

“There you are. I knew you could move if you just loosened up.” Sherlock tilts his head back, shouts in John’s ear. “More drinks?”
That blood running over Sherlock's arm, though. He couldn’t stop wanting it, wanting to taste it, smear it in his mouth, over his face. It awakened something in him that he was afraid he couldn't control. He drew in a long breath, tried to count down from ten to calm himself. Tore the gloves off his hands, and dug into his palms with his nails to try and focus.
Sherlock cleared his throat, feeling as though he'd really put his foot in it, which was ridiculous, because of course he hadn't sent the parcel. It was an unspoken understanding that they never discussed John's father, however, and now he felt as though he'd broken that rule by bringing any of this up. "Oh. I'm sorry, John. Is she  --- ?"
Sherlock shakes his head, his features lit by the faintly bluish glow of the Kindle he has propped against a pillow. "Listen to you. You're like a bear sometimes, John, I swear. A small, grouchy, grizzly bear."
"That would be more than slightly awkward, I think, Sherlock." John pets his hair and Sherlock sinks down against his side and sighs. "But for the next few hours, yeah. Let's just stay like this."
John doesn't even think of arguing, instead just gasps out a quiet whimper of concession. He's already hard, shivering against Sherlock's hand pressed between his shoulder blades. He nods against the rough bricks and Sherlock grunts in acknowledgement. Then Sherlock's deft fingers are at his flies, while with the other hand, he twists John's arms together at the small of his back. Low and dangerous, Sherlock's voice growls in his ear. "Don't make one sound. Not one." John bites into his tongue to keep from moaning, his breath shuddering loudly through his nostrils. His arms ache, but this is new and just this side of frightening, and he dares not say anything.
you I’d take you home.”
"Fine." Sherlock threw himself flat on his back, purposefully bouncing the mattress and twisting the blankets half off of John.
John bites into his bottom lip, rocks it back and forth between his teeth. "Yeah. I guess I am."
Sherlock crawls his hand up to John's mouth and pushes two fingers in between his warm lips. "Suck."
and then hummed and sighed as every muscle went slack and he nearly fell asleep between John’s legs. He’s dropped miserable tears on the scars that Sherlock suffered while they were apart, laid his cheek against ruined skin and wished he could make it all go away. He’s spent a thousand nights watching the rise and fall of this back, Sherlock sprawled diagonally across the sheets with one foot hanging off the bed.
Sherlock writhes and whimpers louder, seeking more friction against his cock as he arches up desperately into John’s hand.
“Are we done, then?” John braces the camera, lens up, between the kettle and the white enamel lip of the hob, which sits slightly above the countertop.
want, Sherlock? Tell me.”
John sighed. God, he was being maudlin. Here he was in a raucous pub in South Bank with his rugby team after their first win, crying into his lager and missing his boyfriend. Pathetic, really, for a forty year old man.
Sherlock's eyes never leave him as he takes the bills out of his shorts and smoothes them, laying them carefully on the bar in a neat pile and counting them twice before he folds them and hands them to the bartender. The bartender claps a hand down on his shoulder with a grin and wink. The sight of the other man’s large hand on that delicious curve of bare skin awakens in Sherlock an unexpected and ferocious surge of possessiveness.
"Yes, alright." Sherlock ran two fingers down the side of John's face, pressed the tip of his index finger into the deep cleft of his chin. John gazed up at him, his eyes beaming affection, with a glint to them that promised the night was far from over. "I miss your beard."
He hands her a cigarette and lights it for her. She smokes elegantly, like Audrey Hepburn, her hands long and graceful, blowing the smoke out above her head, chin tilted up. Guilt tramples through him.
“It was true. Every word.” Sherlock says again, breathlessly, letting his eyes fall shut as John continues his leisurely exploration of Sherlock’s chest and belly by slipping his hand up under his tee shirt.
“You cannot leave me, Sherlock.” John’s voice is as sharp as broken glass.
John takes a drag and blows it out slowly, hands it back to Sherlock. “So what are we going to do today?”
“Who?” Sherlock whispers, barely breathing.
Lestrade clears his throat and Molly and Sherlock break apart, Molly tucking her arm around Sherlock’s elbow and beaming up at him.
“You sound very pleased about that.” John smiled as he sat up. He pointed at Sherlock’s arm, which he’d obviously wiped clean, but hadn’t been dressed yet. “Okay, now you.”
Sherlock kneeling on a soft blue carpet, his phone in his hand. A chubby blonde toddler stumbling towards him.
“I suppose.” Sherlock frowns as the light changes and they cross, stepping around a queue spilling out the door of Pret a Manger.
The Denny’s was set in the rear of a wide flat strip mall. Parking lot mostly empty, with just a smattering of cars. Mounds of filthy snow were piled in the corners of the lot, black and grey, melting in mucky rivulets. Fuck, but this place was bleak.
Sherlock blinked innocently as John descended on him, rubbing his face into his neck and pushing him flat on the his back. “Turn over, you gorgeous creature. You want this beard all over you, you’re going to get just that.”
John bites his lip and rubs against Sherlock in a tight circle before he relents and slides his hand back up to Sherlock's stomach. "Later, then."
Sherlock can’t look away, mouth dry, as John allows the pants to drop to the floor and kicks them away. He stands there easily, comfortable in his nudity, fiddling with the ties on his nightshirt, while Sherlock’s caught halfway between arousal and embarrassment. John’s right in front of him, completely starkers, and Sherlock just can’t
"Of course not, Mycroft.
“Good, because I don’t think I can bear much more.” I wriggled back against him, desperate to make him
Watson. You love having me at your whim. You love having someone to command and domineer, and you love that it's me. Don't try to tell me you don't."
“Alright.” John sucks in a breath and closes his eyes. “Can I ask you something first? Since you read the journal, and you already have an idea about how I feel?”
“You trust me?” John whispers against Sherlock’s ear, flicking his tongue ever so slightly into the whorl.
"Well,
" John kisses Sherlock's cheek, his ear, hot and close, breathing hard.
. His breath caught sharply at the look I cast him, and his fingers tightened in my hair, tipping my head back enough to expose my throat. A shudder of pleasure pulsed through me that made my hips jerk.
John presses his tongue into the warm hollow behind Sherlock’s ear, and noses against his hair. “You’re
"Yes. I just. You said you'd be here. I didn't know where you were." Sherlock sounds half apologetic, half petulant. The timbre of his voice stirs heat in John's belly, the beginnings of arousal tingling through his thighs and lower back.
“He gets nervous around crowds.” Sherlock lifts the rat and plops him into Rose’s hand. He runs up her arm and settles on her shoulder, nibbling the ends of her curls affectionately.
Sherlock opens his mouth to respond as viciously as he can that this is absolutely none of Molly’s business and if she doesn’t damned well play the game instead of moon over boys, he’s going to bed, but before he can speak, he’s interrupted by a furious tapping at one of the small round windows that ring the Hufflepuff common room.
John has no idea what to say to that. There are so many things they aren't talking about. This isn't just about The Work, and Sherlock has to know that too. This is about everything they are. This is about their life. John seethes and waits.
John's arse is aesthetically perfect. Round and taut, a definitive line from buttock to thigh, a curve of muscle defined at his hip.
"Oh Jesus, John, do you even know how hot that is?" The pressure of John's hot wet mouth around his fingers is overwhelming; he needs something, anything. John hasn't even touched him yet. His cock is throbbing with need. He rocks against John's leg and nearly comes right then, a tingling shudder overtaking him, the feeling of John's body against his aching flesh nearly too much.
- but then retracts. He doesn't smile. "I'm sleeping on the sofa tonight. You can have the bed. You always need more sleep anyway. I'll text you if I'll be late. So you won't worry."
Sherlock nodded, beyond speech. He ran his hands down John’s back, sweaty and hot from the fire, and over the smooth wool until he found the hem and tucked his fingers up inside. He smoothed his hands up the backs up John’s thighs, and up to the firm muscles of his arse, which tensed under his hands. John tipped his head down and kissed Sherlock’s mouth tenderly, parting his lips achingly gently with his tongue. Sherlock kneaded his arse, running his thumbs over the muscled dimples at the small of his back, dipping his fingertips exploringly between his cheeks, and kissed him back with both fond familiarity and throbbing lust.
Mopping up the spilt coffee with a napkin, he shifts his eyes away from Mike’s, down the mostly empty Hufflepuff table, and sees someone’s left their Daily Prophet. The headline reads
“Home?”
Heart still thumping madly. "I am. I need to, ah..."
“Oh, I wasn’t
“No more apologies?” John’s thumb traced over Sherlock’s bottom lip, his eyes dark and stormy grey.
When he wakes up, John’s always there, moustacheless and in rumpled jeans, but looking at Sherlock with the same unguarded affection that Sherlock sees in his dreams.
Sherlock flails his limp ragdoll arm in the vague direction in which he tossed the tin of petroleum and whines at the emptiness inside him now that John’s fingers are gone. He teases his own fingers down the length of his body while John’s cursing and leaning half off the bed to look for the tin, and wraps his hand around his cock, cups his bollocks up against his body, makes himself shudder. It feels different now than ever before, different because he knows what John’s hand feels like on him - John’s
He cleared his throat. "I'm here because...because my...because Sherlock Holmes isn't dead."
They knock back the tequila. John chokes and sputters, and Sherlock realises he's probably never drunk straight tequila in his life. "Are you alright?"
“Sherlock.” John quickly wraps the towel around his waist and takes Sherlock’s face between his warm wet hands. “I feel exactly as you do.”
“Fine then.” Sherlock doesn’t say thank you. God, it smells amazing. Some kind of thing with mozzarella cheese and pesto, oily and fragrant. Sherlock licks delicately at the edge of it, wanting to savour it.
“Well, Oliver Wood happens to be one of the best Keepers in the history of the game. He played for Gryffindor before Ron Weasley did - I daresay you know who
John smiled, his cheeks flushed above his beard, glistening wet with saliva, lewd and gorgeous. He was the picture of debauchery, indigo eyes shining with lust, smelling like musk and sex. "You lazy sod," he murmured fondly.
He looks away, instead fumbles at John's shorts, crudely bunched around the tops of his boots. Their need had been too frantic, their time too short, to take them off all the way. Sure enough, there's a tiny elastic pocket sewn into the waistband. Sherlock slips his fingers inside and pulls out a small tube of lip gloss.
The station's dim. Sherlock brought the torches, reaches into his pocket and hands John one. As they flick them on, Sherlock catches movement in his peripheral vision about fifteen feet in front of him, dread immediately pooling in his belly.
tough.” Sherlock allows himself a grin, caught halfway between between wanting to vault over the stands and run away, and grab John’s face and kiss him hard on the mouth. His whole body is quivering, the hairs on the back of his neck standing up.
It wasn't until they were halfway to Ella's office that John asked Sherlock about the meeting with Mycroft. John didn't look away from the window as he spoke. He too mesmerised by London. He wanted to drink in every postbox and stoplight, every Pret a Manger and Brookstone's, every single overflowing bin, every mundane damn thing that he'd never even bothered noticing before. The whole goddamned city was gorgeous to him. He hadn't realised how desperately homesick he was until he was back.
They settle and sigh, shifting against each other to get comfortable, until John finally falls asleep on his back, one leg stuck out from under the covers, his arm flung over his forehead. Sherlock rolls over and props himself up on his elbow, watches John’s eyelids twitching, watches each infinitesimal movement of that beloved face, breathing in the smell of him, sleep sweaty and sharp, until eventually Sherlock’s own eyelids grow too heavy to keep open. He curls against John’s side, overwhelmed and grateful that in some universe he’s allowed to lay his head against John’s heartbeat as he falls asleep, and finally surrenders.
They get home and collapse into bed after almost twenty four hours without sleeping. John’s eyes are burning and his arse is burning and he doesn’t have the energy to take his clothes off even though they're filthy and his pants are soaked with semen and will be uncomfortably plastered to his skin when he wakes up. Sherlock doesn't shower, but he does slip into his pyjamas, and then burrow up behind him, as John knew he would, making himself small against John’s back. “John?”
