“I can’t believe that actually worked.” Peter whispered to himself catching his breath. Peter tugged at the cuffs and broke them easily. Huh Tony must of thought he starved him enough to be weak. Peter then started working on getting the chain off and that was a little harder.
“He was the one always taunting me and running away he called me a freaking cat and he made me so angry!” Ironman yelled reminded of each fight he had with Spider-Man.
“Good I...” Steve looked to Tony and was shocked. Tony didn’t have his sunglasses on... Tony always wore his sunglasses. Steve slowly approached him and tilted his head when he saw Tony back up blindly. Why were his eyes closed? Steve was determined to find out. Steve touched his arm and Tony freaked turning away and Steve caught his arm confused and wanting to know why Tony was acting this way.
“shock therapy what do you think?” Tony said realizing he screwed up. Tony took out the remote and set it down on the bed as he sat down.
“Now I assume we don’t want a repeat of last time do we?” Tony asked finally reaching Peter and Peter flinched trying to get away from Tony but his hold on his chain was strong and Peter hasn’t eaten much his super strength was failing him as he stumbled forward towards Tony. Tony yanked the chain and Peter fell towards Tony almost running into him. Tony then smiled and crouched down as Peter lied on the floor struggling not to cry.
“I forgive you.” Peter said snuggling into Tony’s neck and Tony cried harder holding himself back from his sinful urges. The memory of when he humped himself against Peter fresh in his mind.
“Nice.” Tony said taking the remote back and Peter shook in fear as Tony once again held the remote to his torture device.
“Whatever.” Steve said trying to dismiss his feelings and just be happy for Ironman and Tony. It didn’t work.
“Oh nothing just going to find out how you tick.” Tony said picking up dart gun with a powerful tranquilizer in it. Peter tensed up his spider sense going off. Tony turned around and shot at him and Peter just barely dodged it yelping out in surprise.
“Well I was gonna offer my design for your suit but you seem to have that handled.” Tony said utterly impressed and in awe of Peter.
“Good.” Tony said and Peter looked away from him closing his eyes in frustration and embarrassment. Tony inspected his hand and Peter wanted to just pull away, but didn’t the feeling of the collar around his neck weighing down on him.
“He beat me and shocked me whenever I tried to fight back.” Peter continued getting lost in the memories.
In chemistry class Peter got out his notebook and was filled with relief seeing the formulas for his web fluid. Only on 2.5 though hmm he needed to change that. Peter nodded and looked in his hidden draw seeing the chemical mixture for his webs.
“My friends are there plus I don’t want to be 15 and going to a school where everybody else is older than me.” Peter said and Tony scoffed.
“How did you do that?” Tony asked puzzled and felt a bit of hope return maybe Steve would take him back.
“You mean you made armor for a person you don’t even know? Steve told me Ironman said that you know who he is.” Natasha said taking a bite of her cereal.
“He’s not!” Tony said angrily his eyes flaming, standing up and glaring at Steve. Steve backed up stunned.
“I got to go.” Peter said and left going outside and running into an alley trying to calm down. Peter rubbed his throat where the collar previously was and tried to calm down repeatedly saying.
“It’s been a while good news is we got Tony locked up for life so that’s good... we still trying to find a way to save you Peter.” Jared said sobbing and holding on to Peter’s hand kissing it.
“Get out of here.” Ironman said and Peter ran towards Tony hugging him gratefully then ran out the door going back to his apartment.
“I don’t know Ironman but we’ll figure it out.” Tony said hugging him. Ironman hugged back kissing his neck. Tony chuckled pulling away slightly.
“Just call me when you have him all trained up.” Tony said and Steve nodded pulling Peter forward. Peter tried resisting but Steve’s hold was too strong.
“Come on let’s go to bed.” Tony said standing up and Ironman nodded and let Tony take control. Tony brought them to their room and lied down on the bed locking the door.
Ironman stayed for a few more seconds before handing Tony control and let the lights turn back on to their previous brightness and let the light from the windows come in again. Tony smiled at all their baffled faces and Ironman chuckled silently from inside Tony’s mind.
“Y-you are okay with this?” Tony asked his eyes cooling down back to their milky brown color. Tony blinked his eyes fully back to normal now.
“You are not getting away from me again, Peter.” Tony said and some of the cast who were on the ground injured and weak looked to Peter confused.
“Go away!” Tony yelled out and Steve sighed sadly feeling his heart sink but didn’t leave just leaning against the door and sitting down against it.
“Whatever.” Steve said and kissed him. Tony kissed back after a second of shock and enjoyed it very much.
“Tony!” Ironman yelled through the door and Tony cried harder burying his head in his legs muffling his cry.
“He doesn’t like it when the inner part of the collar is touched.” Jared said and Peter smiled relieved of the pressure of the material that used to be around his neck. Peter shook his head feeling Jared’s hand gently run across his throat.
Tony was enjoying this and his eyes lit up as he tried using the blasts in his feet to fly. Tony laughed when he fell over and didn’t mind the flames in his eyes them serving more as a comfort right now than a threat.
“Clint get out of the vents!” Tony yelled and held his hand out for Ironman to take. Ironman nodded and took his hand merging with Tony and sitting in the back of Tony’s mind. The vent fell open and Clint fell out.
“They talked about... pulling the plug... Peter they are talking about killing you!” Mark said angry and Peter heart rate spiked hearing Mark so angry and using his real name, Peter panicked a little.
“So yeah I’m sorry for putting you to rest. I’m sorry for letting you go. I was doing you a favor.” Jensen said and Peter sighed looking down.
“You could have chosen anything else on this desk, Peter anything else!” Jared yelled and Peter kind of felt guilty as Jared started picking up the papers.
“I didn’t know how to say goodbye. I didn’t want to say goodbye.” Jensen said taking another sip of whiskey.
Peter waited for something to happen as he watched his body burn but something was keeping him there. Peter looked around and saw Mark holding something in his hand. Peter looked and saw that it was the collar Tony put on him.
The armor was beautiful. Steve blushed when he saw Tony looking at his drawings. Steve quickly hid his drawings and blushed.
“Where are we going?” Mark asked holding Peter’s collar close and watching as Peter shivered rubbing at his throat.
“I love you Tom, Peter. I just...” Mark paused sobbing and Peter sighed mentally knowing this day would come.
“What?” Natasha said and then Ironman gave Tony control and his eyes ceased to glow as the lights turned back on as Tony hit the switch.
“Help me how do I explain this to them Tony.” He heard Bruce say and then Tony cursed. “How did they find out?” Tony asked
“But I did. I hurt you so badly. I gave you nightmares. I killed you.” Tony said crying sadly. Peter only shivered slightly and then hugged Tony and Tony hugged back.
Peter panted tiredly arriving at the place. Peter looked around and then rung the door bell. The door opened and Peter smiled seeing a scruffy man in a trench coat.
“Stop doing that.” Peter said upset. Jensen felt the room get significantly colder and shivered slightly.
“So what we go over there ask them to burn this collar turn it to ashes and you think they will just do it?” Jensen said angrily.
“I- I didn’t know how... I was just being precautious I thought you were new to this stuff...” Tony stuttered and Peter glared at him.
“You said your friend saved you how did that happen?” Tony asked and Peter sighed trying to make up a lie.
“Please wake up, Tom.” Mark said using his fake name and Peter twitched waking up slightly but his body wouldn’t let him and he heard a sob come from Mark.
“Will you tell him now?” Steve asked and Tony nodded going on his phone and texting himself. ‘Steve says you’re back on the team!’ He texted and promptly got the message back and just smiled.
Tony glared at Robert but hugged his Peter happily and started to drag him back through the portal. Peter looked at Tony with betrayal in his eyes and refused to budge.
“It’s me Steve I-... I messed up...” Steve said. Tony gathered himself together and put on his sunglasses.
“Tony, stop...” Peter said crying and blushing now. Tony just kissed him harder biting slightly into his neck making Peter whimper.
“Hey can I talk to you for a minute?” Steve asked Tony and Tony looked to Ironman and that made Steve angry. Ironman nodded waving his hand and Tony smiled.
“Rogers what a pleasant surprise. What are you doing here?” Tony asked pushing a button that hid the arc reactor in his chest then put his hand back in his pocket.
“I was but then I remembered you don’t know me that well and we don’t do that...” ‘anymore’ Peter whispered the last part hoping Tony didn’t hear.
“St-stop it.” Peter stuttered the gentle touches of Mark driving him mad. Mark didn’t stop because he couldn’t hear him and Peter whined blushing as Mark stroked the collar. Peter whimpered pathetically and fell to his knees.
“Yeah I wanted to tell you that you’re off the team.” Steve said and Tony froze shocked and frowning now.
Tony was in the armor fighting with the Avengers as Ironman again. He couldn’t help but smile enjoying fighting with the Avengers. It just felt right. The Avengers didn’t know that Tony was Ironman and Tony intended for it to stay that way. Tony ignored the banter of his teammates as they talked about him, well Tony.
Steve found himself drawing in his sketchbook and he sighed when he saw that he was drawing Tony. Steve wondered what Tony would look like in the armor so he drew it.
“Shhh.” Tony hushed him licking the spot where he bit Peter. Peter tried so hard not to fight back that he just gave up sobbing into Tony’s neck as Tony held him in place still rubbing himself against him.
“Yeah I know.” Peter said in understanding. Alex breathed out and noticed that it got colder in the room.
“Okay Peter this time I brought something to test your speed.” Tony said as a treadmill thing was brought into the room. Peter looked at the random workers and thought of yelling out for help but held his tongue not wanting to be shocked again. Tony smiled in delight seeing Peter stay silent.
“Calm down Ironman I will protect you.” Tony said and Ironman calmed down feeling the comforting feeling of love and protectiveness that Tony felt towards him. It made Ironman’s heart soar with happiness.
“Welcome to the music room with our lovely friend Rob Benedict on guitar and his crew.” Mark said motioning to the group and Peter waved hi as they greeted him.
“See you later Rogers.” Tony said as Steve walked out of the lab waving goodbye. Tony was quick to put the lab on lockdown and open the letter to see what it was.
“It’s okay I’m here.” Peter said trying to comfort Mark and Mark smiled leaning on the seat staring at Peter.
“Tony it wasn’t your fault it was mine.” Ironman said and Tony looked up at Ironman feeling betrayed. Peter looked to Ironman and freaked out hiding behind Tony.
“I knew you would, mind if you train him?” Tony asked and Steve sighed but took the chain from Tony.
“I wanted to tell him how I felt but then I accidentally panicked and said the wrong thing and now he thinks I kicked him off the team!!!” Steve yelled panicked and Tony stepped back surprised.
“You’ll be alright you’re safe here.” Jared said and Peter nodded shivering slightly the memories coming back.
“I just want to protect you.” Steve said firmly and Tony nodded shirking slightly under the gaze of Steve.
“Hey Tony.” Steve said noticing Tony enter the room and seeing how not nice he looked. Tony was usually very well kept and always had a bravado about him but right now there was none of that. Tony was wearing loose sweatpants and a T-shirt. His hair was in udder disarray.
“Well I called out to him and he knocked over the glass to probably tell me he was there.” Alex explained and Jensen sighed.
Several days passed and each day Mark would come visit him and read him stories and tell him what was happening out in the world. Peter tried waking up for Mark many times but it still wasn’t working.
“Can you come out so we can snuggle?” Tony asked and Ironman smiled separating and hugging Tony snuggling into him. Tony snuggled back just wanting to hug all the bad thoughts away from Ironman.
Steve watched in udder admiration as Tony worked on the armor. Steve loves Ironman but he couldn’t deny that Tony was hot and charming. Tony was amazing in more ways than one but that’s just from what he heard.
“I ran away once when he left me unattended I got the collar off I thought I was free.” Peter said and Tony listened intently.
“I think you can come out now?” Tony said and Clint tried not to make any sound. After a bit of silence Tony spoke again.
“You guys can talk things out I’ll be in the lab.” Tony said smiling and then leaving the room rushing to the lab.
“No problem.” Jensen said opening the door and going inside and taking his shoes off. Peter entered as well and closed he door behind him, taking his shoes off at the door wanting to be respectful.
“We probably will never see him again. I thought you said you would keep him out of the vents?” Steve said sadly.
Tony brought him in the bathroom pulling him by his collar and Peter shivered feeling very violated as he stood there naked in front of Tony. Tony then shocked him and Peter whimpered.
Tony dried himself off then brought Peter into the bedroom and pinned Peter to the bed kissing him roughly and grabbing his ass. Peter started to whimper hating what Tony was doing to him. Tony then bent Peter down spreading him and then poked his finger in him. Tony worked him good and then entered him enjoying how tight Peter was and then pounded into him making Peter scream out in pain or pleasure Tony couldn’t tell but he loved it.
“Peter are you okay?” Steve said kneeling down in front of him and Peter cried just wanting to get out of there.
“Meet my new pet Spider-Man or Peter.” Tony said and Peter backed up a bit seeing Steve approach him.
“I’m not Peter, my name is Tom... Holland” Tom said shyly. Robert just pushed Tom further behind him.
“I’m here to listen.” Mark said and Peter sighed gaining a tiny bit of courage to talk about his nightmare.
“Now, YOU are gonna hold still while I take a sample of your blood.” Tony said grabbing a syringe and Peter whimpered trying to back away.
“Not your fault Tony is crazy.” Peter said and tensed up expecting to be zapped scared Tony was listening. Peter sighed and relaxed after a moment of silence.
“I’m sorry.” Tony said and Ironman cried into his shoulder leaning against Tony too. Tony started crying too knowing the Avengers didn’t accept Ironman and probably never would.
“Let’s get to work.” He heard Tony say and Clint got frustrated. Why wasn’t Ironman speaking! Clint waited a few more minutes but Tony and Ironman didn’t speak just working on the vent. Clint sighed sadly and went back to the kitchen to find Natasha.
“Yup.” Tony said and went around the kitchen looking for food. ‘Tony I don’t think this a good idea.’ Ironman thought to him trying not to laugh seeing Steve look at them confused. ‘This is a great idea just let me stay in control.’ Tony said happily finding bread, peanut butter, and jelly. Ironman nodded slightly using the body but let Tony take control just sitting in the back of their mind.
“Ackles is my last name, how about you?” Jensen asked and Peter shook his head not prepared for the question.
“Jensen... Jared...” Peter said looking at them sadly. Peter never saw Jensen and Jared drink before.
“What are you doing here because I definitely did not apply for your.” Peter said as they stepped into his room and Tony closed the door behind them.
Peter never got around to advancing his suit not having time and the materials yet. Peter tried finding the empty track he had his last base in and worked on building it to what it was before but just got done with the blueprints.
“Jarvis you can unlock the lab.” Tony said and mentally thanked Ironman. ‘No problem’ Ironman thought back letting Tony take control.
“Because they make me look cool.” Tony said trying not to blush or freak out. Tony’s eyes were different if he got angry they would glow blue like they did in the armor and he couldn’t risk anyone finding out about his eyes. Steve sighed not believing him but backed off.
“Okay Peter give me your hand.” Tony said and Peter stood up hesitantly approaching Tony. Peter was still scared of Tony but now Tony could shock him whenever he wanted he would rather not pick another fight.
Peter tried not to panic as he slowly made his way over trying not to freak out. Peter stopped by Mr. Harrington keeping a good four or five feet between him and Tony.
“I’m sorry.” Tony said leaning against him. “It’s not your fault I look like this.” Ironman said looking down at his blackened skin.
You remember Peter dying well this is a continuation of that from last chapter the one where Peter dies peacefully and goes to the next life
“That’s why I came to hash it out.” Tony said and Peter closed his eyes and hiding his face in his hand.
“Do you really want to be with me?” Ironman asked Tony and Tony stopped, trying to figure out what Ironman was saying and feeling.
“Whatever you are going to say Jensen forget it I won’t stop fighting for him.” Mark said standing up and Jensen sighed.
“Wanna talk about it?” Tony asked and Peter shook his head knowing telling his torturer what was happening was a bad idea.
“Now a special guest speaker.” The tour guide said and Peter felt himself fill with dread not wanting to even see Tony Stark. They all sat down and Peter stayed in the back as far from Stark as he could as he walked on stage and started answering questions.
“It’s my fault really...” Ironman said feeling the same panic as Tony even though they were separated.
“Yes but I have so much other stuff to do I just don’t have the materials yet or the time to...” Peter trailed off realizing he was saying too much.
“Don’t attack him!” Tony yelled at them and they backed up scared of Tony putting their weapons down. Ironman hid behind Tony feeling scared and almost crying.
“Tony just open your eyes.” Steve said calmly softening his grip slightly wanting to see his eyes. Once Steve did Tony tried yanking his arm back but Steve tightened his grip again, making Tony hiss in pain as his arm was relentlessly tugged on.
“I will be back to collect you later Peter.” Tony’s voice said and Peter cried curling in on himself.
“It’s okay he can’t hurt you anymore.” Steve said protectively and hugged Peter back wanting to beat Tony up.
“We are still trying to find ways to get that collar off of you. We will find a way.” Jared said and then Peter heard more crying. Peter sighed mentally and didn’t even bother trying to wake up.
“What do we do Tony!” Ironman said getting scared. ‘It’s okay calm down everything will be alright just calm down we’ll work through this together.’ Tony thought and Ironman calmed down.
“No they don’t. They don’t hate you and they won’t hate you.” Tony said trying to reassure him. Ironman tried to calm down but his self hate was getting to him.
“Misha I swear if you ever do that again I will strangle you.” Peter threatened glaring at Dimitri. Misha didn’t seem to hear him though and just started getting ready for bed and Peter was quick to leave the room going to go visit Jensen and Jared again.
“Okay we can stop with the hugging.” Ironman said biting his lip refusing to smile. Tony let go and smiled up at him.
“Bodyguard who fights to protect you take that away what are you?” Steve said threateningly to Tony and Ironman wanted to get out and just punch him but Tony held him back.
“I know it’s kinda cliche but I knew you loved these books so I thought I would read one to you, you know to pass the time and cheer you up.” Mark said resting his head in his hands on Peter’s bed.
Peter got home and started trying to advance his suit and webs but he didn’t have the material so he just stuck with his old stuff and enjoyed it a bit.
“Wow you can withstand a lot.” Tony said looking at Peter struggling. Peter collapsed the weight getting to him and the contraption stopped just a foot from the ground almost crushing Peter.
“Don’t worry just one more day I will try to keep Tony from hurting you.” Bruce said and Peter nodded just closing his eyes trying to forget what Tony did to him.
“Don’t worry it’s actually really cool to meet you!” Tom said seeing that this was actually the Peter he played in the movies. Peter immediately calmed down and smiled at Tony hoping this was okay with him. When Peter looked over Tony was fuming.
“Please stop.” Tony pleaded getting on his knees and Ironman sighed cleaning up his wounds and Tony sighed feeling his wounds clean up too.
“What is happening?” Peter said worriedly and Tom just stared at Peter amazed. Tony then stepped closer to Tom.
“Go here there are people who can help you.” Jensen said and Peter nodded getting ready to leave again.
“Yeah I might have something.” The clerk said and Peter blushed as the clerk took the collar to the back and started placing it in different cases each one different each one rubbing against his neck. Peter shook his head as the clerk took a cloth and cleaned the inner part of the collar.
“Bruce?” Peter said looking around to see if Tony was with him and sighed in relief not seeing Tony around.
“You know I could try getting in through the vents!” Clint suggested itching to get in the vents again.
“You know you may not be a threat but stop pretending to be a hero.” Steve said and Ironman growled the sound coming from Tony’s throat caused Steve to look at Tony questionably and Tony sighed. ‘Not yet’ Tony thought and Ironman backed down.
“You bet I am.” Tony said entering the room. All the Avengers looked at Tony as he entered the room and tensed up like they were waiting for someone else to walk in with him.
“I’m Ironman.” Ironman said. At the moment Tony was still working in the lab so Ironman had to handle this by himself, but he sure wish Tony was with him right now.
“Three Fifty one.” Peter said sighing and wiping away his tears. Peter shook his head trying to make the memories go away and wiped away his tears again. Peter tried sleeping but the memories got so bad he couldn’t fall asleep. Peter cried again just wanting the memories to go away.
“I love you too.” Ironman said kissing him again and Tony kissed back happily. Steve chuckled lightly  a little jealous but knew they were happy together.
“He rarely speaks anymore and it’s so frustrating. Why doesn’t he trust us?” Steve said angry at Ironman and Tony.
“Fine.” Tony said glaring at Peter and Peter smiled smugly at Tony sticking his tongue out. Tony just smiled and hit the button again and Peter yelped looking away from Tony and glaring at the ground sadly.
“What did I tell you.” Tony said angrily shocking him again with a much more powerful shock and Peter yelled out withering in pain. Tony heard knocking at the door and quickly yanked Peter up off the ground making him stand.
“Sorry! I didn’t mean to draw you without your permission.” Steve apologized holding his drawings close.
“No, I don’t think I ever will.” Peter said truthfully and Jensen wanted to break whoever hurt this precious soul.
“No, last time you went in the vents you didn’t come back for a whole week.” Natasha said glaring at him.
“Do you want me to stop?” Mark asked and Peter nodded shivering as Mark brushed his hand up against the inner part of the collar. Peter blushed and Mark chuckled drunkly.
“Who was it?” Tony asked and Peter kept silent biting the inside of his cheek and looking away from Tony.
“Good I...” Steve paused and Tony heard Steve approaching him so Tony backed up blindly hitting the counter behind him stumbling and barely kept his footing. Steve touched his arm and Tony freaked turning away and cracking his eyes open just a bit so he could run but then he felt Steve tug on his arm so he closed his eyes again.
“The way Tony smiled after threatening us like he had another conversation with someone in his ear, yeah.” Natasha said sighing.
“You can’t hang on to him.” Misha said and held the collar tight. Peter whimpered again as he felt pressure on his neck.
“I will go tell them to back off. Do you want to come with?” Tony said holding out his hand. Ironman nodded and hugged Tony for a moment before merging with him.
Steve got increasingly worried about him and frowned as Tony was limping when he worked. Usually Tony would stand and work but today he was sitting and limped when he did try to walk. Steve huffed frustrated and confronted him about it.
“Tony it’s okay I can tell that you are nervous.” Pepper said as Ironman stood there his eyes darting around.
“Sorry Steve I can’t let you hear my real voice.” Ironman said smiling actually enjoying keeping his identity a secret only a tiny bit of fear seeping into his heart.
“Wow this is impressive Parker.” Tony said impressed and wowed by all the math and work he put into the suits and that even had suit designs for cloaking and it was so advanced Tony was amazed.
“Tony, I know you may not see it as abuse but he is hurting you.” Steve said worried. Tony scoffed shaking his head in disbelief. Steve was stubborn and cared way to much about his well being.
In the end they didn’t really have a good plan but knew that they had to keep Ironman’s identity hidden. They even fought about it.
“Plus I haven’t had enough time to upgrade it.” Peter said sighing and Tony looked at him impressed.
“Did this happen because we borrowed your bodyguard? Was he not there for you?” Steve asked and Tony shook his head.
“So your real name is Ironman?” Steve asked after Ironman finished. Tony looked at him confused as to why that was the first question Steve asked.
“You have to get it out of me and destroy it.” Peter said desperately and the doctor sighed but did it anyway. Once the tracker was out Peter destroyed it and then sighed sadly.
“I was just wondering if you were hungry I brought sandwiches.” Steve said holding out a tray with four sandwiches on it.
“Nah you would think I’m scary.” Ironman said quietly his voice just barely getting through the speakers.
“Let it go! you’re hurting him.” Mark said and Misha looked at Mark with pity but loosened his hold on the collar anyway. Peter sighed and looked at Mark gratefully.
“How dare you.” Ironman said smiling not able to stop the happy feeling of Tony being there take over his features. ‘I love you.’ Tony said and Ironman shook his head smiling.
“Hold still.” Tony said and Peter froze not wanting to get shocked again. Tony attached the leash to the collar then pulled Peter forward. Peter followed reluctantly and then stopped at the edge of the invisible box scared.
“Yeah that was great.” Ironman said smiling getting out of the armor. Once they were out of the armor they separated again.
“Shhh, It’s okay.” Tony shushed him putting his finger on Peter’s lips. Tony then kissed him slowly and Peter tried moving but he couldn’t. Tony nipping at Peter’s neck and ear kissing him softly. Peter whimpered trying to move but whatever drug Tony put into his system paralyzed him and his metabolism wasn’t fighting it off fast enough. Tony took his time just kissing him roughly, enjoying Peter’s sounds of struggle and pain. Peter yelped as Tony shocked him again for no reason other than for Tony’s enjoyment. Tony smiled biting his neck enjoying Peter’s pain. Peter closed his eyes refusing to look at Tony while he withered in pain.
“Tony I didn’t know you wanted to be together like that.” Ironman said his emotions spreading onto Tony. Tony wiped  his tears away and let all of his emotions fall down on Ironman. Ironman started crying feeling every emotion Tony was throwing at him.
“Look at you go. Wow, nice catch! 3000 pounds 40 miles an hour. It’s not easy, you got mad skills.” Tony said closing the video and walking towards him and Peter went past him just wanting to ignore him.
Peter didn’t like how they fought but he heard lots of yelling that day and he hated it. Many more days passed and Peter could tell Mark was giving up on him.
“I’m sorry Peter... you were a part of the family... I was just... you know, little bro.” Alex said sadly.
“Y-you were so surprised!” Tony said between laughs and Steve looked at him upset and Tony laughed harder Ironman laughing too.
“We see how he ticks we do a few tests first. Come on Bruce you can’t tell me you aren’t just a little curious.” Tony said and Peter backed up feeling more scared his breath quickening as Bruce agreed reluctantly. No! This couldn’t be happening! He buried his face in his knees as he sunk down to the floor crying. He looked up angrily determined to escape and get away from Tony and Bruce.
“Sir there seems to be an intruder trying to get in the room through the vents.” Jarvis informed Tony and Ironman.
“We already tried burning it, don’t look at me like that.” Mark said quietly as Jensen looked like Mark insulted him by just having the collar.
“It’s okay Ironman nothing bad was said about you you’re actually pretty great.” Pepper said and Ironman smiled softly.
“I saw that collar Tony, don’t lie to me.” Bruce said not believing what Tony was doing to the poor kid.
“Fine.” Jared said picking up the last of the papers. Jared picked up the collar and Peter shook his head the sudden pressure of Jared’s hand on his throat startling him.
“I had two dads and they were so funny and they were the best. I had two uncles and uncle Mark took care of me the most while My dad’s were working. My other uncle he was really funny he used to wear this brown shaggy trench coat all the time and we would always joke about it. My friends were all so nice and they played music together and I even got to learn to play the guitar.” Peter said lost in his memories of the cast.
“You deserve better than Ironman.” Steve said and hugged Tony and Tony almost cried while he hugged back.
“What have we here?” Tony asked as his suit fell down and Peter panicked grabbing it and hiding it in his laundry basket.
“It’s alright just tell me next time.” Peter said enjoying the look on Tony’s face. Tony nodded smiling and brought up the works for the AI he was making for Peter.
“Does that mean you can feel this?” Jensen said stroking the inside of the collar and Peter shivered trying not to get flustered as he felt Jensen’s hand stroke his neck surrounding him with unusual pressure Peter never felt before but realized he had to quickly get used to.
“I’m going to wash you don’t try anything.” Tony said and Peter shivered under Tony’s gaze. Peter hated the feeling of Tony’s hands all over him touching and rubbing his skin. Peter blushed uncomfortably as Tony cleaned his shaft rubbing it more than needed and Peter whimpered hating that Tony made him feel this way. Tony took his time cleaning his ass too and Peter blushed feeling Tony poke his finger into Peter’s hole.
“It’s just with Tony gone I’m worried about him I usually go with him and it’s just...” Ironman said covering his face with his hands.
“This is the only way.” Ironman said as they turned upward going strait through the huge wormhole in the sky. ‘Woah’ Tony said seeing all the aliens. ‘It’s alright Tony I’m here.’ Ironman said feeling Tony panic. ‘There are so many.’ Tony said about to cry. ‘And we defeated them.’ Ironman reminded him as they saw the bomb blow up. ‘We are gonna pass out.’ Tony said and Ironman said
“I’ll pass.” Peter said not wanting to be reminded of Tony in anyway even if it was a somewhat good memory.
“He couldn’t take it anymore.” Peter said quietly remembering how Mark sobbed saying he was sorry for ending him.
“Yeah I know I won’t allow it, there isn’t any poison in your system anymore they are just thinking of...” Mark said angry and frustrated.
“Yeah.” Ironman said with his half of the body then hid away inside the mind letting Tony take over. Tony watched as his skin turned back to its normal color when Ironman went into their mind hiding away.
“It’s okay Steve.” Tony cut Steve’s ramblings and stared at his drawings. Tony was taken aback at how accurate some of Steve’s drawings were.
“No, Peter you don’t get to be let go.” Tony said walking around the box pacing in front of Peter. Peter got up and paced too following Tony’s movements and angrily glaring at him. Tony stopped pacing and smiled.
“Don’t ever call me that again.” Tony said angrily pushing him to the ground and kicking him in the ribs. Peter wondered if this was better or worse than what Tony was doing before and decided it was better... maybe.
“What? like you!? You abandoned him after just one visit!” Mark yelled angrily and Peter wanted to just wake up and yell at him.
“I know it’s a stupid assumption you clearly aren’t the same person.” Pepper said and Ironman sighed feeling angry.
“They, Tony and Ironman. You seem to forget that Ironman and Tony are in a relationship.” Natasha said and Steve blushed feeling a tiny bit jealous. He wanted Ironman to be his or maybe Tony, he had a crush on them both and it was not working out well.
“What I want Penis is to see you break.” Flash said and Peter acted weak but just mentally sighed already knowing Flash was just taking out his anger on him. Flash shoved him into the seat and Peter didn’t fight back.
“Speaking of Ironman I want you to stop questioning him!” Tony said furiously and Ironman felt a wave of happiness accidentally making Tony smile.
“Don’t.” Peter said feeling Tony move kissing at his neck lightly. Tony stopped himself bowing his head ashamed.
“You have the helmet on Tony?” Natasha asked and Ironman got up holding the helmet with him and gave it to Steve.
“On a walk.” Tony answered and Peter huffed stubbornly reluctantly following his torturer. Peter kind of enjoyed their walk as they walked around the tower Tony bringing him to the training room.
Peter eventually found a weak link and broke it smiling. Now for the collar. Peter tried pulling the collar apart but that clearly wasn’t working so he tried the lock piece if he could just get the lock to fail he would be out. Peter started messing with the lock in a million different ways and still it wouldn’t budge. Hmm he needed something better.
“Steve! You better not have touched anything!” The angry voice of Tony came into the room and Steve freaked out looking at Tony in surprise.
“Please stop.” Peter said placing a hand on Jensen’s shoulder. Jensen looked up surprised and crying.
“I hate this! It’s no fair!” Tony yelled but closed his eyes calming down so his eyes wouldn’t flame up again.
“You’re welcome... Tony.” Steve whispered as he saw Tony fall asleep so quickly. Steve sighed fondly then fell asleep himself.
“Yeah no problem!” Tony said taking off his sunglasses and taking his hands out of his pockets as Steve left. Tony looked in the mirror and smiled.
“Okay Ironman let’s go.” Tony said walking down the hall towards the living room. ‘Are you really going to tell them off?’ Ironman asked watching Tony approach the room where the Avengers were.
I followed Tony down the hall and he stopped at his lab door. That’s strange. Tony knocked on the lab door.
“Ask Rogers.” Ironman said fed up with Clint and Clint ran out determined to find Steve and figure out the mystery of Ironman and Tony. ‘That went well.’ Tony said mentally grinning.
Peter felt the pressure of fingers grasp around his neck and Peter stood up wondering who picked up his collar. Peter looked as a very tired Alexander held his collar.
“No running away.” Tony said glaring at him and Peter just looked down at his feet feeling trapped again. They heard a knock on the door
“I’ll take care of the kid, you guys take care of Tony.” Steve said picking up Peter and bringing him out of the room. Peter hugged Steve crying.
“Now!” Tony said and Peter shook his head. Tony sighed and hit the button again and Peter tried not to yelp in pain. Peter then approached Tony holding out his hand.
“Well then scoot over.” Steve said and Tony nodded scooting over so they could both lie down on the bed comfortably.
“What were you doing?” Tony said threateningly and Ironman laughed watching Tony yell at Steve angrily.
“Jensen is mad at you for not waking up.” Mark said and Peter mentally scoffed of course only Jensen would be mad at him for something he couldn’t control.
“You ready?” Tony asked Ironman as he started to walk to the door. ‘Yup’ Ironman thought and tried to focus on Tony’s feeling of protectiveness instead of his own feeling of panic.
“T-Tony stop... please.” Peter said still in the memory and Mark held on to his shoulders making Peter look into his eyes.
“Don’t let me have it. Don’t let me make more!” Tony pleaded still crying not wanting to hurt Peter.
Peter put his shirt back on realizing he could now and then continued to mess with the lock on the collar. Peter then felt the part of the collar that for some reason was made from a different metal and he broke it off wondering what it was. He examined it and it was a plate type thing. Peter’s eyes adjusted to the dark and he read the plate.
“I remember and I keep having urges to do it again.” Tony said crying telling the whole truth and Peter looked at him sadly. Peter hesitantly approached Tony and Tony looked up at him still crying.
Things got a lot better after that and Tom actually felt part of the family and the nightmares mostly stopped and Tom was a part of the team. Tom even got a small part on the show, pretending to be part of the British Men of Letters and even helped on a hunt. Jensen and Jared treated him like a son while Misha and Mark acted as Uncles to him and Alexander became like a big brother to him. The rest of the cast were his friends and Tom loved it.
“But he’s gone now too.” Peter said crying and pulling his knees up to his chest. Tony looked at him horrified that he had to go through that and felt himself feeling guilty for asking and making him remember the horrors of the past.
“Calm down Tony. You know I could never stay mad at you.” Ironman said hugging Tony tighter and Tony calmed down snuggling into Ironman’s neck.
“It’s over Peter you can’t get out.” Tony said and Peter growled stepping towards him and stopping where the invisible barrier was.
“I love you Tony and I won’t let anything or anyone come between us.” Ironman said and Tony looked at him with hope.
“I’m going to get you out of here, just one more day.” Bruce promised then stepped towards Peter holding an emergency medical kit.
“Kid you are scaring me do you need medical attention?” Tony asked getting more worried as Peter just lied there.
“You know he won’t be leaving might as well let him in.” Tony said and Ironman sighed letting Tony open the door. Ironman chuckled seeing Steve fall onto the floor. Steve got up and blushed embarrassed and then closed the door locking it as he stepped in.
“I’m here Peter it’s okay you’re safe. There’s no collar you’re at the airport remember.” Tony said and Peter collapsed in relief.
“Aww this so sweet Wing head.” Tony whispered to himself as he finished reading the letter and held onto to it tightly, hugging it. Tony sighed putting the letter in a special drawer.
“Tony.” Ironman said noticing Tony’s shoulders slump and Tony frowning slightly. Tony looked up at Ironman and fake smiled not wanting Ironman to see how he hurt him.
“Here it is this is perfect.” The clerk said placing the collar and Peter felt the material wrap around his throat. Peter rubbed as his throat the weird pressure not going away as the clerk brought the collar in the case back to Misha.
Tony let the Avengers move into the tower and they lived together peacefully Ironman only visiting the Avengers every so often and only with the armor on. Sometimes Tony would tag along but Tony was usually busy with other stuff. Sometimes they would both go as Ironman other times they would go separately as Tony and Ironman and rarely would they ever both go as Tony. It was great well that was until the day they asked the question on everyone’s mind. Who is Ironman?
“Tony, let me go!” Peter said struggling under Tony’s hold and whimpered as Tony hit the button again.
“You really are protective of him aren’t you?” Clint said as Ironman backed up realizing Tony must have told him to stand down Clint tilted his head puzzled.
“Training Wheels Protocol?” Peter said offended then remembered he was just 15 at the moment but Peter still glared at Tony in Peter’s mind he was still 29.
“Oh so you get to be dramatic but I don’t! This is serious you almost killed him!” Peter said angry at Tony now.
“You already made the collar.” Peter said holding it up and Tony flinched crying and feeling so shameful.
“Are you coming or are you going to make me have to drag you.” Tony said frustrated shocking Peter again and Peter got up walking out; Tony right behind him with his hand on his shoulder, leading him out. Peter was brought out and led to a fancy car with blacked out windows. Peter got in the car Tony right behind him almost pushing him in. Peter looked out the window trying to figure out where they were going. Tony ignored him mostly throughout the trip and Peter was thankful for that.
“Shh it’s okay you’re safe now.” Steve said tiredly holding Tony in place and Tony gave up letting himself get snuggled by Captain America. Steve kissed Tony’s neck and Tony blushed.
“I-.” Tony didn’t have any words and just cried feeling every burn of every cut, knowing he deserved it. Tony then realized Ironman was hurting himself and scrambled to his feet running to the lab.
“Tony! Get it off!” Peter yelled out and Tony just smiled shocking him again and Peter withered in pain.
“Well I wanted to ask for your help, actually.” Tony said suddenly feeling like Peter deserved his respect.
“N-no M-mister Stark I’m good.” Peter stuttered not wanting to be anywhere near Tony Stark. Tony looked at him confused and stepped towards him and Peter stepped back scared the memories still playing over in his head.
“I think our iron friend wants to keep his identity a secret and we have to respect that.” Thor said and Steve sighed only a tiny bit frustrated.
“Are you going to sleep on my floor or...” Tony trailed off completely confused as to why Peter just decided to drop in.
“I-it was just a lab accident.” Tony said nervously. Steve hugged him and Tony jerked back his ribs still hurting.
“He drugged me and beat me I couldn’t fight back.” Peter said tearing up and bringing his knees up to his chest.
“Just don’t resist too much and he won’t shock you or hurt you as much okay.” Bruce hoping that was true and Peter nodded sighing sadly.
“Oh come on man you at least have to show up. You’ll never know if you don’t show up.” Sam said and Steve sighed.
“Tony!” Peter said surprised pulling away only to realize he was backed up into a wall again. He couldn’t fight back against Tony he didn’t know yet he couldn’t defend himself and he started crying.
“I love you Ironman, it doesn’t matter what they say I will always love you.” Tony said snuggling back.
“I’m not Tony Stark anymore.” Ironman said showing the plate that read out. ‘Spidey property of Ironman’. Ironman stuck it on the collar and smiled happily as Peter didn’t fight back.
“Nope he is mine now.” Robert teases hugging Peter from behind and keeping him in place and Peter played along saying
“The collar is killing him we need to find a way to take it off!” Someone said he couldn’t tell he just drifted back to sleep dreaming of nothing. He regained consciousness again and saw Jensen sitting beside him holding his hand.
“He he’s been crushing on me?!” Steve said flustered and Tony chuckled softly smiling at how cute he was.
“You’re at the airport with the Avengers okay and we were fighting a huge guy.” Tony said slightly confused about the situation but hoped explaining it would bring Peter back and it thankfully did.
“There.” Tony said finishing up and looking at Peter smiling. Peter wanted to ask what was happening, why he had to wear a suit, why was he even here, but he held his tongue not wanting to be shocked again.
“Hey Tony are you going to eat this sandwich?” Ironman asked and Natasha and Steve looked at Ironman confused.
“You can’t just steal my intern! This is not okay! Peter we are leaving!” Tony yelled angry that these strangers who were from an alternate universe got Peter’s attention. Peter was his and Tony didn’t want to share him.
“You don’t have anything to be sorry for.” Peter said hugging Tony. Tony hugged back carefully and sighed sadly.
“Hehe you people are so petty.” Thor cut in and Tony was grateful for that. ‘Calm down Ironman!’ Tony yelled at him and Ironman huffed angrily. ‘When I get to him he’s dead.’ Ironman said and Tony put his knuckles against his forehead. ‘Shh it’s okay he won’t hurt me and he didn’t so calm down. Also next time we are in the armor we are going together.’ Tony thought not trusting Ironman to go alone. ‘Okay fine but I get most of the control’ Ironman said and Tony sighed in relief. ‘Deal’ Tony said and looked back up as Bruce started talking.
“Don’t touch it.” Tony said and Peter just looked at Tony confused and sad. Tony then took out a chain leash and Peter backed up afraid.
“Peter?” Alex called out looking around the room. Peter sighed sitting beside Alex and knocking over one of the glasses making a soft thump on the table. Alex looked to the glass and put the collar down putting the glass back right up so it wouldn’t fall off the table.
“Shut up.” Ironman said and Tony laughed mentally. ‘Alright Ironman.’ Tony said sending a wave of happiness to Ironman and Ironman smiled chuckling.
“Y-your not going to exit the armor.” Steve said a little nervous to spar Ironman with the armor on.
“Why are you so mad about Misha having your collar?” Jared asked confused. Jensen looked at Jared confused then looked to where he was looking and his eyes widened seeing Peter standing there.
“Help.” Peter said and passed out. When Peter woke up again he was in a hospital the cursed collar still around his neck. Peter sighed giving up and not minding to panic just letting all his muscles relax again only hearing one thing before he drifted off again.
“They are scared of me.” Ironman said separating from Tony and crying on the floor. Tony was quick to follow him sitting on the floor with him and leaning against him.
“Just think of how it was before when you were your own person.” Tony said and Ironman sighed using the body slightly. ‘I’m not sure if I’m ready’ Ironman said using Tony’s body to shake out his hands.
“I know.” Tony said and Natasha and Steve just looked at them more baffled. ‘I have an idea!’ Tony thought to Ironman excitedly and thought of the idea to Ironman. ‘Alright but you gotta turn the lights off.’ Ironman said and Tony nodded.
“Guys something is happening?!” Peter said confused and then got knocked back by a tiny dude that turned huge and stole Cap’s shield back.
“Jarvis put the lab on lockdown.” Ironman said and started getting out fo the armor. ‘Please don’t make me go’ Tony pleaded
“Wow you are such a good boy this time around.” Ironman said and closed the panel sealing Tony off and just leaving Ironman and Peter alone in the room. Ironman then felt himself having a heart attack and opened the panel looking at Tony horrified who held out his arc reactor and crushed It letting the shrapnel get into his heart killing him. Ironman dropped to the floor dead too and they became one person leaving the dead body of Tony Stark still half and half with Ironman.
“Goodnight Alex.” Peter said as Alex stumbled back to his room. Peter stared at the wretched collar that was keeping him here. Peter waited till morning and wasn’t surprised to see Misha up bright and early.
“See you soon.” Bruce said packing up the med kit and standing up. Bruce left Peter alone and Peter cried again wishing he could just leave.
“He is Ironman.” Tony said leaving with two bowls of cereal. Natasha scoffed and followed him secretly.
Peter found Mark and he was passed out in his bed. Who had his collar then? Peter looked around for Dimitri hoping he had it. Peter shook his head and rubbed his throat the pressure not going away and seemed to just get harder. Peter found Dimitri holding the collar running his hands all over it and Peter almost screamed out wanting him to stop.
“Yeah we’ll protect you.” Misha said and Peter looked at him confused then a bunch of other people came into the room.
“He can’t hurt you anymore.” Peter calmed down trying to think of his memories with Jared, Jensen, Misha, and Mark. Peter calmed down sighing in relief and then opened his eyes and almost panicked again.
“I won’t leave you alone Tom, you don’t deserve that. I will make sure to keep you company even if no one else will.” Mark said sitting down on the chair.
“Yeah let’s plan.” Ironman said and they started planning on what to say if the Avengers asked who he was again.
“I’m here Jensen.” Peter said and then shivered smiling as he felt Jared’s big hands picking up the collar.
“Keep collar away from Misha Peter hates it when inner part of collar touched.” Jared read out and sighed again.
Tony put the lab on lockdown and Tony sighed. ‘You ready to get out?’ Tony asked Ironman and Ironman hesitantly nodded.
“Please wake up.” Mark pleaded one last time and kissed Peter’s forehead and then stood up turning away to leave and was surprised to have Peter grab his hand stopping him from leaving.
“You are lucky that I remembered to have dinner.” Tony said and then placed the plate of scraps down in front of him. Peter ate slowly savoring the little amount of food he was given and Tony watched him. Peter shivered under Tony’s gaze and tried to ignore him.
“Thanks.” Tony said ignoring how his eyes burned. Tony closed his eyes trying not to grimace in pain as his eyes burned hotter.
“Thanks, Ironman but I think I got this.” Tony said determinedly and Ironman nodded resting his head on the ladder.
“Hey.” Tony mumbled getting stuff out to make a sandwich. Ironman in the armor came into the room and sighed looking at Tony.
“No one ever taught you how to tie a tie?” Tony asked knowing the answer and Peter nodded shamefully.
“Yeah thanks.” Peter said closing his eyes remembering all the different suits he made and the details. Peter shook his head opening his eyes and then putting his notebook away.
Peter got introduced to Jensen’s wife and kids and they loved him and then Jensen brought Peter to the guest room.
Tony was working in the lab again and was practicing repulser blasting without his armor on, trying to see if he could make his blast more powerful like when he did have the armor on.
“Stay still and I won’t cut you.” Tony said and so Peter tried staying perfectly still. Tony then cut his shirt off and Peter shivered feeling violated.
“Fine.” Ironman said and grabbed Tony’s hand merging with him. Ironman felt every thought Tony was thinking and every feeling Tony was and Ironman frowned slightly.
“You don’t have to be sorry Tom, it’s not your fault. It’s okay you’re safe now.” Jensen said protectively and Peter smiled up at him.
Ironman was falling Steve started to panic as he saw that he wasn’t using his thrusters. He was free falling! Thankfully Hulk caught him. Steve stopped Thor from revealing Ironman’s identity and hoped Ironman would just wake up. The Hulk roared and woke him up thankfully
“I’m sorry.” Tony said on accident and Ironman left the room going to the lab. ‘Darn it I’m so sorry!’ Tony said about to cry.
“Fine...” Tony said and then took his sunglasses off. Steve gasped softly at the way Tony’s eyes lit up becoming a fiery blue.
“Quick question of the rhetorical variety.” Tony said pulling out his phone and showing a video of Spider-Man and Peter tried to stay calm.
“I am just scared of what they will think of me.” Ironman said frowning slightly as they broke apart.
“He killed him and my friend killed him back. I got to run away again after that.” Peter said smiling sadly remembering how sad Mark was when Peter died.
“No. I just, I can’t, I have Ironman... he will kill me if he finds out I’m cheating on him with Captain America.” Tony said running a hand through his hair.
“You don’t deserve any of this and I will kill whoever made you think that.” Steve said protectively and Tony blushed
“Of course can’t have my bodyguard being upset because he thinks the guy he’s been crushing on kicked him off the team.” Tony said smiling knowing exactly what he was doing.
“I even had an older brother! But I don’t think he liked me that much we never got along that well.” Peter said remembering how Alexander always looked at him coldly and pushed him around.
“No Tony isn’t making me do anything!” Ironman said growling at Clint and stepping towards him threateningly. ‘Ironman.’ Tony said not wanting him to attack Clint. ‘What?’ Ironman thought stepping away. ‘Calm down.’ Tony said softly. Ironman took a huge breath in and out and just glared at Clint.
“Now, stay still and accept it.” Tony said threateningly kissing him again and Peter turned his head away disgusted. Tony shocked him again and Peter whimpered trying not to scream again.
Peter looked at Tony horrified and shocked. Tony just killed himself for him. Peter surprisingly broke off the collar easily and tilted his head confused. Tony switched out the collars. Peter jumped out the window and swung away to his apartment realizing what just happened and sighed going to sleep crying.
Peter missed Mark and hoped he was okay. Maybe Mark was fine I mean he wouldn’t remember him anyway. Peter thought sadly remembering how broken up Mark was about his death.
“I can’t get it off...” Peter said crying harder as Mark knelt beside him wanting to do something to help him.
“Sorry for what happened to you no one deserves to be treated like that.” Mark said and Peter closed his eyes trying not to remember what Tony put him through.
“Well I was just working.” Tony said and Ironman tried not to chuckle. ‘Good one’ Ironman said smiling mentally. ‘I thought you were going to help me.’ Tony thought mentally glaring at him. ‘I will and you should probably be paying attention because she looks mad’ Ironman thought and Tony panicked for a second looking at Pepper.
“Mark said he would watch over you and tell me when you would wake up... when he told me you weren’t gonna wake up I- I...” Jensen paused beginning to cry.
“What am I doing?” Jared whispered to himself holding out the collar and staring at it. Jared pulled out his phone and looked at the reminder he left himself again.
“Nah it’s alright... wanna work in the lab maybe work on your suit while I work on mine?” Tony offered and Peter nodded following Tony to the lab.
“You guys should probably head to bed.” Peter said and Jared nodded going to his room and Jensen stayed behind.
“I’m so sorry.” Tony said feeling guilty. ‘Calm down Tony the world isn’t ending’ Ironman thought smiling at Tony’s panic and Tony calmed down.
“Wish I could just beat him up make him pay for what he did to you.” Tony said and Peter almost laughed, the irony of it hilarious.
“I know guys with none of that worth ten of you.” Steve said and Ironman really wanted to just put him in his place but Tony reminded him that he was supposed to stay hidden so he let Tony take care of the situation.
“Cap I got a pet! You might enjoy it!” Tony said delighted and Peter looked at Steve questionably as he walked up to them and looked at Peter confused.
“Because Steve I can’t let you know who I am.” Ironman said grinning slightly only feeling a bit sad that he couldn’t reveal who he was to the team.
“Did I break you? I think I just broke Captain America... oh no what am I gonna tell the team? Um hey guys you know Steve Rogers well I broke him I’m sorry.” Tony rambled nervously.
“Bringing him here was a mistake.” Tony said and Peter tilted his head looking at Tony. Maybe the Avengers would save him he could get out of here away from Tony!
“I got to go, see you later Peter.” Bruce said and left the room. Peter shook his head and put a hand in his pocket feeling the EMP in his pocket. Peter was going to get it out and look at it but Tony entered the room.
Peter then saw a hidden panel open up and saw a chain connected to a metal wall. Peter stopped in his tracks feeling dread creep up into his system and Tony pushed him inside Peter tried resisting but Tony shocked him again.
“Jensen put it down you know he doesn’t like it when you do that.” Jared said as Jensen held it running his hand along the inside of the collar.
“The people you are about to meet are... well they are the Avengers so don’t try anything. Act normal and let me do the talking.” Tony said and Peter nodded.
“Y-yeah but I It was just for when I draw you- you are pretty...” Steve said and Tony blushed lightly.
“One.” Tony said smiling. Ironman kissed him as long as he could and Tony kissed back just as passionate. Tony laughed as they broke apart.
“Sorry Tony but we have to talk.” Ironman said grabbing his arm and Tony let himself be dragged away by Ironman.
“And It has a very complicated answer.” Tony said hiding his blush by burying his face into Ironman’s shoulder.
Peter sighed as he started coding trying to build his AI Karen again but his computer was slow and he wasn’t making much progress with everything he still had to do to be back in tip top Spider-Man shape.
“No problem.” Steve said chuckling oblivious to the pain Tony was in. Tony sighed finally getting his eyes to turn back and smiled feeling relieved.
“Why? This hunk of junk never did any of us any good.” Richard said tracing fingers over the metal of the collar.
“No! Stop!” Peter yelled out scared and started crying getting shocked again. Peter woke with a start breathing heavily the memories of his past life still haunting him as he felt around his throat relived to not have the collar on anymore.
“About what happened... my family didn’t die... I did, Tony killed me.” Peter admitted and Tony looked at him baffled and confused.
“Do you wanna tell me about your nightmare?” Mark asked and Peter bit the inside of his cheek wanting to tell him.
“T-Tony was my old mentor he forced me to wear a shock collar I couldn’t get out of...” Peter said and Mark listened. Peter then went on nervously.
Peter still had to deal with Flash but it wasn’t as bad as he remembered. Peter didn’t see Ironman when he was out Spider-Manning so that was a relief.
“We just want to know who wears the mask.” Steve said calmly and Tony nearly strangled him but held himself back.
“You got to get in your head Peter that you won’t be getting out of here. Might as well accept it.” Tony said grabbing Peter by the hair and Peter winced in pain as Tony pulled on his hair.
Steve came into the kitchen. He couldn’t sleep another nightmare from the war. Steve walked in the kitchen and just barely noticed Tony there heading strait to the fridge for some food.
“They are saying you probably won’t ever wake up.” Mark cried harder not wanting to say the next thing.
“Well I just wanted to talk to the team see what’s up.” Ironman said happily and talked with Clint a bit just happy to have some company.
“Peter...” Mark whispered and Peter looked up at Mark blushing embarrassed. Mark then tapped the inside of the collar and Peter felt it shaking his head.
“It’s alright. Tony will be fine, it’s just a meeting and if you are really worried just get that armor on and go protect him.” Pepper said hugging him and Ironman hugged back gratefully.
“Come on.” Ironman said and Tony followed. Steve sighed as they left and felt a little heartbroken knowing that him and them weren’t going to have that dinner.
“I’m afraid I can’t do that, Tony.” Ironman said and dragged Peter away to the lab and Peter followed him feeling helpless. Tony went after Ironman and stopped him.
“I told you I would find you Spider.” Ironman said tugging at his chain and chaining him to the wall.
“Misha! He doesn’t like it when something touches the inside of the collar!” Jared said taking the collar out of the case and holding it close to his chest.
“You can stay at my place if you want?” The stranger said and Peter looked down at the stranger curiously.
“Come here.” Bruce instructed and Peter hesitantly got closer seeing no ill intention in Bruce’s eyes. Bruce grabbed his shoulder pulling him close and Peter stayed still a little afraid.
“You know I wish we could just burn this collar but we don’t have a fire powerful enough to melt the metal.” Jared said frustrated.
“Can I touch you?” Jensen asked and Peter nodded and Jensen hugged him gently and Peter hugged back crying into his shoulder.
“Well Tony used to have feelings for me before Afghanistan and I thought since he still does that you did too...” Pepper said hesitantly.
“No problem Ironman.” Steve said glad to cheer him up. They sat on the couch watching TV together Ironman out of the armor and lying on top of Steve. Steve happily wrapped his arms around Ironman to comfort him. Tony walked in the room and Ironman sat up glaring at him.
“No escaping.” Tony said and then closed the panel leaving Peter alone in the dark chained to a wall. Peter shivered in fear and cried missing home.
“He’s not wearing the helmet. I think that’s Ironman.” Steve said staring into those glowing blue eyes and Natasha freaked.
“Calm down he can’t hurt you anymore it’s okay.” Steve said comforting him. Peter nodded trying to calm down just shivering and curling up on himself as Steve put him down gently on the couch.
“I already told you Steve he isn’t abusing me.” Tony stressed trying to get Steve to stop thinking that.
Tony fell to the ground getting out of the armor and glaring at Peter and Peter punched Tony really hard knocking him out.
“It’s alright I wasn’t asleep and I’m sure Dimitri told you one hundred times over that it’s okay.” Mark said and Peter chuckled blushing embarrassed.
“Right but you...” Steve’s mouth hung open as Tony sat down in a chair putting the sandwich in front of him. ‘You ready?’ Tony asked Ironman. ‘I can’t wait to see his face!’ Ironman said chuckling mentally.
“Yes I wanted to say Ironman I love you... but instead my stupid brain panicked and kicked him off the team.” Steve said hanging his head in shame. Tony blushed and chuckled lightly.
“Please write down a note reminding you to keep the collar safe.” Peter said knowing they most likely won’t remember any of this in the morning.
It was a while before Tony opened the panel again and Peter squinted as the lights of the room lit up.
“Go.” Tony said and Peter ran. Peter ran as fast as he could imagining running away from Tony, away from this place, away from this torture. Peter slowed down getting tired after a while and Tony looked at him impressed.
“A more comfortable setting.” Tony said and Peter tilted his head confused and a bit scared of what that meant. Tony walked Peter into a bedroom and Peter looked around confused and scared. Tony attached the chain to a thing on the wall and Peter struggled trying to get away but Tony shocked him and Peter sighed sitting down and leaning against the wall he was stuck to.
“Good boy.” Tony said and Peter huffed closing his eyes refusing to let Tony see that it got to him.
“Well it is just that you have anger issues... and th-that, it is a little scary when you point the blasters at us.” Steve said trying not to freak out only stuttering when Ironman pointed a blaster at him. Ironman looked at Steve angrily then sighed and lowered his hand taking the blaster away from his face.
“Tony just open your eyes.” Steve said calmly softening his grip slightly. Once Steve did Tony tried yanking his arm back but Steve tightened his grip again, making Tony hiss in pain as his arm was relentlessly tugged on.
“No.” Peter said and ran after Mark ignoring the lady’s call. Peter followed Mark as Mark went to a bar and got drunk. “Tom.” Mark called out looking at him and Peter tilted his head confused could Mark see him?
Tony then started straightening his suit and untying his tie and re-tying it. Peter felt uncomfortable but didn’t struggle.
“Oh you didn’t tell your friends your real name huh?” Tony teased and Peter glared at Tony whimpering in pain as Tony shocked him again. Tony grabbed him by the collar choking him slightly and dragging him away. Peter struggled and grit his teeth tired of not fighting back.
“I’m sorry.” Steve said and Ironman sighed and Tony hugged Ironman closer letting Ironman hide from his problems.
“Ya know Ironman how bout we go a few rounds, work off some of that steam.” Steve suggests punching Ironman in the arm lightly, mostly because he didn’t want to hurt his hand from hitting the armor. Ironman turned to him and Steve backed up a little scared of him.
“Misha please stop!” Peter yelled out and fell to his knees and cried embarrassed as Misha kept running his hands through the collar. Misha finally put he collar down and Peter sighed trying to catch his breath, blushing beyond embarrassed.
Tom lived the rest of his life happily never seeing Tony again and they all lived happily ever after.
“Or I might drive you insane more.” Tony said chuckling and Pepper kissed him and Tony missed this kissing her back happily.
“Thanks Tony this saves a lot of time.” Peter said and then started altering the AI Tony made and Tony felt a little insulted but saw that Peter was just making it better and Tony felt ashamed again. Why was this kid so smart! Peter made Tony feel dumb and that was a very difficult task.
“Ironman I’m sorry please let me in!” Tony screamed as he pounded on the door the lab on lockdown locking him out. Tony felt the cutting stop and sighed relived.
“Care to tell me Mr. Parker why you were sleeping?” Tony asked and Peter half expected to get shocked right then and there and instinctively put a hand to his throat reminding himself he didn’t have the collar on.
“Nice to meet you Tom.” Jensen said smiling and started walking towards his house and Peter followed him walking beside him.
“Umm really?” Peter said confused but didn’t feel his spider sense go off so he slowly climbed down the tree.
“Well... I’m the consequence of that plus the arc reactors to keep us alive...” Ironman said and Pepper looked at him baffled.
“You are probably wondering why Jensen, Jared, and Alexander haven’t visited in a while.” Mark said and Peter tried doing something to tell Mark he was listening.
“Peter!” Tony called out and Peter quickly looked away from the device and looked to Tony confused. Tony came over to him and tugged on his collar bringing him up and Peter followed his movements confused and a little bit scared. Tony then attached something to the collar and that confused Peter more.
“Then let’s start.” Steve said getting onto the mat. Steve and Ironman sparred for a while Steve using his super strength to over power Ironman it only ever worked a few times though because the armor made Ironman stronger. Eventually Ironman had Steve pinned.
Mark walked into Peter’s room and saw him screaming in his sleep and withering on the bed. Mark shook him trying to wake him up and kept saying his name.
“No. Tony it was my past life, you are not the same person.” Peter said and Tony sighed “you are not the same person.” Peter reassured.
“Yeah it was just scary facing them without the helmet on and...” Ironman trailed off not knowing how to explain the feeling.
“I’ll catch up.” Bruce said and Tony shrugged going out the door. Bruce sighed once Tony was gone and flipped the switch making the ceiling go back to where it was supposed to be.
“I’m sorry Tony and I’m sorry Peter.” Ironman said approaching him and Peter froze his heart filled with fear. Ironman held up the collar and put it around Peter’s neck locking it and Peter panicked pulling at it and then whimpered as Ironman clipped on the chain and grabbed him by the collar and lifted him up.
Peter pulled Tony’s hair making him let go then kicked Tony off of him making him crash through a table. Peter was quick to pull his pants back up and head to the vents to escape.
“No I...” Peter trailed off realizing that this was not indeed the afterlife and he just was fifteen again.
Peter started to panic breaking the ropes and trying to get Tony off him but Tony pulled the collar tight around Peter’s throat and Peter struggled trying to get the collar off but Tony already locked it and Peter finally pushed Tony away making him land ten feet away on the floor.
“I should probably sleep goodnight Peter.” Alex said caressing the collar once more then putting it down carefully. Peter shivered but was somewhat comforted by Alex’s touch.
“Why not and you can’t leave me alone with Flash!” Ned whined and Peter paused again reminded that Flash his old high school bully was here.
“This is an EMP use it at night and go through the door open it it’s electrically locked the vents aren’t safe.” Bruce whispered to him slipping him the EMP and then pushed him to the ground. Peter looked at Bruce confused and quickly pocketed the EMP hiding it from Tony.
“You’ll always be mine.” Ironman said and kissed Peter softly and Peter didn’t react just sighing in defeat.
‘Tony?’ Ironman thought in his head hoping Tony could hear him. ‘It worked!’ Tony thought back smiling. Tony opened his eye and Ironman opened his. ‘Can I take control?’ Tony asked and Ironman nodded going to the back of the mind letting Tony take control of the body.
“I will always be here for you.” Mark said holding his hand and kissing it. Mark then started reading commenting on the story every now and then and that made Peter happy. Peter was glad that Mark was still here.
“Accept me.” Tony said commanding and shocking him again. Peter just withered in pain, Tony touching, pulling, and kissing him. Peter bit his tongue not wanting to refuse and risk getting shocked again.
“Why do you hate yourself?” Peter asked putting a comforting hand on Tony’s shoulder. Tony started crying and hid his face in his hands.
“Jarvis tell Ironman to get in the suit I’m being tailed.” Tony said quietly and Jarvis sent the message. Tony knocked on the lab door.
The bomb exploded and Tony was knocked back. He woke up confused as people around him were yelling and speaking a foreign language. Tony woke up again and noticed someone beside him. He then looked at what looked like a mirror but his eyes were glowing a bright blue and his skin was a dark grey.
“We have eggs and bacon.” Jared said and Peter tensed up reminded of the time Tony brought him bacon and eggs for breakfast.
“What does he do in there though, I’m guessing you and him spend a lot of time together.” Clint said and Tony just ignored him letting the Avengers think whatever they want about him and Ironman.
Tony finished with his hair and Peter blushed as Tony started running his hands through Peter’s hair and petting him. Peter tried to hate it but ended up enjoying it more than he would have liked. Tony then sat directly behind him wrapping his arms around Peter’s waist and Peter blushed as Tony lifted him up pulling him onto himself.
“I just came to see what you guys were doing plus I miss Peter...” Alex said looking at Peter’s collar.
“the lab.” Tony tilted his head confused and followed them to the lab and his eyes widened seeing a panel opening up showing a small room where Ironman could keep Peter.
Peter woke up breathing heavily and in shock. What the heck. Peter shook his head sighing and then got up to go see Tony.
“Y-yes?” Tony stuttered. “You have a heart condition you could die!” Steve said worriedly grasping Tony’s arm. Tony frowned glaring at him.
“I also brought you breakfast.” Tony said sliding over the tray of eggs and bacon. Peter rejoiced going to the tray and eating. Peter hadn’t eaten since yesterday morning so this food was amazing and quickly gone.
“Yeah you better be sorry Parker.” Flash said and then left him alone. Peter sighed relived and wishing he was back in his past life where Flash finally grew up and apologized to him.
“Yeah I just remembered something.” Peter said and promised himself he would do some research later tonight. Wait did he even have his powers? Was he still Spider-Man? Peter asked himself and was determined to find out.
“Now you can rest now because I have things to do.” Tony said leaving the room and Peter smiled he was gone! He could escape! Peter was just about to get out the EMP from his pocket when he noticed it was gone! Why was it gone! Did he drop it! Peter looked around wildly for the device but couldn’t find it anywhere. Peter then noticed the device outside of his box on the floor. It fell out when he was running. Peter looked at it and just wished he had his web shooters on him right now.
“I mean you must be me and this is an alternate universe because this my Peter.” Tony motioned to Peter standing beside him.
“It’s vibranium the strongest metal in the world.” Tony said standing up and Peter pulled harder but still the metal didn’t budge.
“Because Ironman wants to keep his identity a secret and we have to respect that!” Steve said and Clint sighed.
Peter swung away quickly going to the nearest alleys and tunnels and finally hid in the tunnels glad to be away from Stark. Peter even felt ashamed to say that he enjoyed it a tiny bit.
“I’ll let him go just please don’t do that.” Ironman said scared. Tony nodded and Ironman sighed defeated. Ironman opened the panel and Peter looked up horrified.
“No one just... Ironman.” Tony smiled happily. ‘Sir why don’t you just tell him you are Ironman.’ JARVIS texted him and Tony blushed and typed back angrily. ‘You know why I can’t do that! He might actually kick me off the team for good!!!’ Tony sent the message and smiled fondly when JARVIS texted him back. ‘Whatever you say Sir.’
Tony sighed finally calming down his eyes finally going out. Tony looked around his dark room and then sighed again knowing he wasn’t going to get more sleep.
“We’re here.” Misha said and pulled Mark out of the car and bringing him into the house the cast shared. Peter looked around the house happily reminded at what it used to be like before he fell into a coma and died.
“oh no I’m captured!” Peter chuckled. Tony glared at Robert then grabbed Tom by the wrist and yanked him to his side and held him in place.
“I miss him so much.” Jensen said crying and glaring at the collar which still continued to hurt Peter. Richard sighed sadly.
“Why can’t we just keep him around a bit more. Just a little longer please!” Jensen said grabbing Peter’s collar. Peter felt the pressure on his neck and tried not to freak out reminding himself it was just the collar.
“You didn’t tell me. Are you keeping secrets from me?” May said and Peter made up an excuse not wanting May to be mad.
“Your breath, your heartbeat, Misha approaching the room.” Peter said and Mark tilted his head confused wondering why Peter could hear so much then Misha knocked at the door.
He was Ironman and no one knew he didn’t let anyone know. Not the public not the Avengers, not even Pepper or Happy. The only person who knew he was Ironman was Rhodey.
“Are you laughing?” Natasha asked and Tony shut up going back in the back of Ironman’s mind. ‘Sorry’ Tony thought guiltily.
“Help!” Peter called out and was shocked by the collar. Peter huffed tired of getting shocked and just glared at the man who walked in with Tony by his side.
“Don’t touch me.” Peter said his spider sense going off warning him of Tony’s hand about to touch his shoulder.
“Come here.” Steve said and picked Tony up. Tony held onto Steve confused and panicked as Steve carried him bridal style down the hall. Steve opened up his door and went inside closing the door behind him. He carefully lied Tony down on the bed and then snuggled with him holding him in place. Tony was confused but couldn’t escape Steve’s grasp. Tony wriggled in Steve’s grasp but Steve wasn’t letting him go.
Peter finally got feeling back in his limbs after Tony beat him and left drunkly. Peter winced the pain getting to him. Peter pulled the EMP out of his pocket and stood up. Peter closed his eyes trying to get enough strength to escape but his body was hurting all over. Peter stumbled falling to the ground in pain. Peter put the EMP back in his pocket knowing he wouldn’t be able to escape tonight. Peter sighed in defeat lying down on the cold hard ground. Peter fell asleep still nursing his wounds.
“It’s okay Tom it’s not illegal to smile.” Mark said and then looked at him sadly as Peter frowned and hid again.
“No I’m fine.” Peter said standing up then jumping out the window and Tony looked as he left shocked.
Rhodey helped him when he was injured he was the War Machine. Rhodey found him in the desert, helped Tony hide his identity, even got in the Ironman armor to help when Tony and Ironman needed to be in the same place at the same time. Rhodey was Tony’s best friend since college and was always there for him.
“I won’t let them kill you I will protect you.” Mark said determinedly and Peter calmed down a bit glad Mark was still there for him.
“Please just give me a chance.” Tony said holding out his hand and Ironman bit his lip trying not to smile.
“Great, So now we definitely know that he’s here why hasn’t he done anything else to signify his presence?” Jensen asked and Jared sighed.
“Do you know how dangerous it would be if you were up here?” Tony countered and Ironman smiled shaking his head.
“Come on let’s get a midnight snack.” Mark said and Peter nodded standing up and following Mark to the kitchen as Misha went back to his room probably going back to sleep.
“Right... I’m sorry...” Steve said awkwardly blushing. Steve then looked at Tony then remembered why he brought Tony here in the first place.
“Don’t worry I won’t hurt you.” Mark said seeing Peter’s nervousness. Peter didn’t feel his spider sense going off so he relaxed.
“It’s okay Tom it’s not your fault it’s okay you’re safe here.” Jensen said again and Peter slowly stopped crying.
“You were a bad spider last time.” Tony said crouching down and picking up the chain the light from his arc reactor letting him see in front of him a little. Tony pulled on the chain bringing Peter closer and Peter tried resisting but Tony still got closer.
“Wow.” Tony said looking at the results and writing it down. Bruce looked at the kid in pity and Tony clapped his hands.
“Stop it tin can.” Peter said hoping the nickname made Tony stop and it did. Tony stopped and looked at Peter in the eyes. Peter panicked more as he saw not lust anymore but anger.
“Do you have Tony in your ear?” Clint said angry. “Is he making you keep your identity a secret?!” Clint said sounding mad.
“I know I lied, my name isn’t Tom Holland. It’s Peter Parker and I’m Spider-Man and this is Tony the one who put this stupid collar on me and tortured me.” Peter said pulling on the the collar and glaring at Tony’s body.
Peter came home one night and saw a really fancy car in the parking lot and that confused Peter a lot.
“Well I’m glad you got out of it. What kind of ‘bad’ was it?” Jensen asked and Peter looked down gritting his teeth not wanting to talk about it.
He was actually doing this! Peter looked around for hidden cameras and security cameras and avoided them all quickly and quietly making his way far away from the tower. Peter finally got home but stopped on a roof outside of where his apartment was. He couldn’t go back Tony would find him. Peter then realized he couldn’t stay in New York he had to keep his friends safe. Peter sighed sadly and left New York getting as far from Tony as possible.
“He put this shock collar on me and I couldn’t get it off...” Peter tried not to cry remembering that wretched collar.
“I get it Tony stop looking like you ruined your chance of me helping you.” Peter said and Tony chuckled feeling embarrassed.
“No.” Peter said and then walked towards his class as they were waiting by the bus. Tony sighed and let him go worried about him and his family and had a million more questions as to who he was and what his story was.
“A hero? Like you? You’re a laboratory experiment Rogers. Everything special about you came out of a bottle.” Tony said not backing down from Steve.
“Aww does the-.” Peter cut himself off remembering Tony wasn’t his enemy and they didn’t do that in this life.
“What? He was teasing me!” Tony said and Bruce sighed shaking his head. Peter hid his smile enjoying seeing Banner glare at Tony. Bruce wasn’t that bad. Peter thought lifting his head off his knees and smiling a tiny bit. Tony glared at him and Peter was quick to not smile anymore scared he would get shocked again.
“You’re making an AI?!” Tony said seriously impressed and saw that it was just as advanced as what Tony made for Jarvis.
“It still amazes me that we can do this.” Tony said smiling. ‘Yeah’ Ironman thought feeling Tony’s joy and wonder.
“Thanks.” Misha said and picked up the case paying for it and then bringing the case with the collar back to the house. Peter was quiet upset the stupid feeling of the material around his throat.
“Oh! Ummm well I never actually seen your eyes before and I just kinda did it...” Steve said blushing.
“I’m sorry I couldn’t help you sooner if I only fought harder then maybe you wouldn’t... you wouldn’t have ended up like this.” Mark said sobbing again.
“I love you Peter, that’s why I can’t let you go.” Tony said intoxicated with lust. Tony kissed Peter making him whimper again and pushed Peter up against the wall kissing him roughly and confined to have his hands all over Peter going through his hair and back.
“Why am I home?” Peter asked then did a double take. Why was his voice so high pitched?! Peter got up and hurriedly went to the mirror.
“Okay Peter.” Jared said holding the collar carefully making sure not to touch the inner part of the collar.
“Yeah show us.” Sam said and Tony sighed. ‘Do you want to freak them all out it will be funny?’ Tony asked Ironman and Ironman gained some confidence chuckling softly. ‘Yeah let’s do it.’ Ironman said and Tony then dimmed the lights and shut off the light coming from the windows making it dark in the room but not as dark as it was before.
“Not here.” Ironman said and then picked up Tony and Tony blushed feeling a bit flustered by his actions.
“But I can still feel him.” Mark said rubbing the collar and Peter shivered the sensation making him feel Mark’s hand on his throat.
“Tony, can I have the remote?” Bruce asked and Peter shivered not wanting to be shocked by Bruce. Tony handed over the remote smiling and Bruce smiled back nodding and then approached Peter.
“Tony!” Ironman called out from the kitchen as Clint, Natasha, Steve, Sam, and Thor sat on the couches and chairs having a meeting.
“Can I have five minutes with him?” Tony asked and Peter tried not to freak out as they walked to his room.
He took a quick look around again trying to figure out how to disable this stupid invisible cage he was in. Tony looked at Peter then shocked him again and Peter yelped looking to Tony.
“Yeah not exactly sure how it works but basically I’m Tony and he’s also me but Ironman.” Tony explained and Pepper looked at them confused but sighed.
“We’ll take care of the collar, won’t put you in too much agony.” Jared said and Peter smiled then realized that Jared and Jensen were ridiculously drunk.
“Who was Jensen?” Tony asked rolling over and lying down on his stomach propping up his head with his arms.
“No problem I will always be here for you.” Steve said kissing him on the cheek and Tony blushed smiling.
“Y-you can call me Tony if it makes you feel better.” Ironman said smiling at her hearing how his name made her feel awkward.
“Like animals.” Tony said putting his hand down and pushing Peter away. Peter stumbled onto the ground and just lied there looking down in fear and helplessness.
“Okay, He is no longer mopping about not being an Avenger.” Tony chuckled lightly when JARVIS texted him. ‘Very mature Sir...’
“Oh Peter stop crying it’s okay.” Tony said shushing him and rubbing his body against Peter’s and kissing his neck. Peter tried so hard not to enjoy the feeling of Tony’s body against his.
Ironman was in the armor alone as Tony worked in the lab. Ironman walked in the living room and was surprised to get hit with an arrow denting the armor slightly.
To be truthful Ironman was a little scared to go back out and show himself to the world the terrorist called him a freak and unnatural. They mocked him and beat him he only ever was kept alive because he was a part of Tony.
“You keep doing this and I’m going to stop bringing you.” Ironman threatened quietly. Tony felt nervous.
“You’re dismissed.” Tony said to everyone and left the room and Peter sighed in relief. Peter went out with the rest of his class but Mr. Harrington called him over. Peter really didn’t want to get in trouble, Flash even taunted him about it. Peter nervously approached Mr. Harrington then froze seeing Tony right beside him.
“His DNA seems to be fused with that one of a Spider. I still haven’t figured out how he sticks to stuff or how strong he is but I did find out that he has really good reflexes something of a sixth sense warning him of a threat approaching.” Tony said and Peter glared at him more intensely.
“You can meet everyone else later.” Misha said dismissing them and they all went their separate ways. Misha and Jared staying with him.
“Mr. Stark he’s dead.” Peter said smiling and Tony looked at him only a little freaked out as to why Peter was celebrating this person’s death.
“How are we going to keep this a secret from them?!” Ironman said stressed running his hands through his hair.
“I don’t like hugs...” Tony said sheepishly and Steve slid his hand under Tony’s shirt lifting it up and looking at Tony’s bruises.
“It’s worse than we thought Peter they say you’re in a coma” He heard Jensen say and then heard Jared beside him
“Stop it Dimitri!” Peter yelled in agony and embarrassment. Misha didn’t seem to hear him though as Misha fiddled with the collar making Peter wither in pleasure and embarrassment.
“It’s okay Tony I forgive you and I’m not mad or disappointed with you okay.” Ironman said smiling and snuggling back.
The elevator opened and Peter felt himself being pushed by Tony forward so Peter walked forward. Peter looked at the Avengers trying to cry out for help with his eyes and then spotted Bruce and froze but Tony shocked him lightly and Peter looked down not trying to look at any of the Avengers anymore.
Tony started to cry as he put the lab on lockdown locking everyone out including Ironman. Tony sat down in the lab and cried feeling his heart break. Tony knew Ironman didn’t see him like that but gosh Tony wish he did. Ironman was everything Tony had and despite everything, Ironman would never feel the same way. Tony cried heartbroken just wanting to be alone.
“Oh alright... umm...  see you guys later then.” Steve said trying to hide his disappointment. Tony grabbed his hand and Steve froze looking at Tony confused and his eyes widened seeing Tony and Ironman become half and half.
“Your first name. He was a very angry and mean Tony.” Peter said stopping for a moment to look at Tony who was glaring at the ceiling and then glanced over to Peter smiling.
“I wasn’t aware that Peter was my son in this universe?” Tony said glancing at Peter then at Tom Holland.
“Hey Tony why don’t you ever take your sunglasses off?” Steve asked one day as they were chilling in the kitchen eating breakfast.
“It’s okay I’m here you can sleep safely now.” Jensen said and Peter smiled watching Jensen and then slowly fell asleep. Jensen smiled at Peter and sighed softly feeling a wave of protectiveness for the younger man.
“And you know how mutants are treated.” Tony said and Peter shivered shaking his head slightly. Tony shocked him again and Peter yelled out in pain.
“Yes now tell me why!” Ironman demanded putting his hand on Tony’s neck but not applying any pressure.
“Ironman you don’t have to do this yet. You can do this later but not like this not now.” Tony said putting his hand on Ironman’s arm.
“Jared is to broken up about it he says it’s too painful to see you.” Mark said sounding angry at Jared and Peter sighed mentally yeah whatever that meant.
“It was just a kiss... it meant nothing!” Tony said as Ironman let him go and lied down on the bed crying.
“Thank you.” Ironman said, mentally hugging back and releasing Clint. ‘I’m always here for you’ Tony thought as Clint spoke “no problem.” Ironman smiled ‘I was talking to you don’t worry.’ Ironman thought chuckling quietly. Tony smiled too unable to keep himself from using Ironman’s body just a little. ‘Sorry!’ Tony said going back into the mind.
“N-no.” Tony said hesitantly and nearly yelped as Steve grabbed him kissing him harder and rubbing himself against Tony. Tony blushed more feeling Steve’s shaft against his.
“No that couldn’t be we have seen them in the same place at the same time before. Plus Ironman and Tony have two very different personalities. Ironman has anger issues and Tony doesn’t. Also how could Tony have a fight with himself.” Natasha said ruling out that possibility.
“Just in time.” Tony said looking up to see a helicopter. “Can you still hear me?” Tony asked Ironman. ‘Yeah’ Ironman responded making sure not to speak.
“It was kind of exhilarating finally facing them without the armor. I can’t believe we did that!” Ironman said freaked out a little.
“Can you please take the armor off. No one is around, it’s just me.” Tony pleaded wanting to see Ironman as he really was again.
“Don’t lie to me!” Ironman yelled angrily and Tony looked down guiltily as Ironman released the pressure on his throat a bit so he could talk.
“Do you know how dangerous it is for you to be up there?” Ironman said looking up at Tony as he worked in the vents in the lab.
“You act like this is normal or this can be much worse.” Tony warned him and Peter nodded not wanting to be shocked again.
Peter snuck in at his house and hid his suit then started doing research. Peter found out that Supernatural was still a show but just not that far yet. Peter also found out that it was just five months since his uncle died and since the Oscorp field trip.
