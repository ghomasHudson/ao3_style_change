John opened his mouth but nothing came out; he’d forgotten words, language - especially when Sherlock smirked at his reaction. It didn’t matter. In the next moment Sherlock was over him once again, blanketing him with his body. He poured over John with renewed vigor.
The detention activity that afternoon consisted of collecting Bubotuber pus into bottles; a task that sounded far easier and more pleasant than it actually was. The main stem of the plant writhed of its own volition, as if in sheer discomfort from the ripe yellow pustules that dotted its slimy black body. They both had to wear their Dragon-hide gloves to protect their skin from the caustic effects of the pus. When the pustules burst, the acrid smell of something resembling petrol filled the air - “As if the Bubotuber farted,” John noted. Sherlock told him this was impossible, of course, as a Bubotuber was not a type of plant that possessed an intestinal tract or an anus.
His heart was pounding, pounding with terror; he was aware of each beat,  and with every beat he was aware of the rush in his body, the urge that said he had to
and waves of heat were rolling through John’s body, sickness churning inside of him. The Lord was bleeding before him. Bleeding from the wounds in his hands and ankles, stigmata they called it, there were red ruby drops on the parishioners, drops of ruby trickling down His face
Sherlock was prone to excess in all things, but alcohol had never been his drug of choice. Heroin was far more pleasant; no nasty hangover the next day.
He was invisible. Invincible. Heady with exhilaration, the excitement of getting away with something so wrong.
John let out the breath he’d been holding when pale fingers alighted upon the screen. He’d forgotten it was there, that wire mesh barrier between them.
This was all silly, he knew, and he told himself so as he stared determinedly into the suds and running water frothing over his hands.
John glances at his date, over by a darkened corner, giggling against the wall with Harriet. Her dress is baby blue; she  wears flowers in her hair. Sherlock waits for John's hesitation.
“Well, you know,” John said, “For a pathetic firstie, I think I did a right decent job of kicking your arse.”
“Look, you don’t have to do this ,” Victor says. His lips part slightly when he looks down at John. His hair is still a mess, spiking up funny in different directions. He looks oddly young in the morning light.
Sherlock slid his finger in and out of John, taking his time, making John hyper-aware of his hole, sensitizing the nerves around his entrance and the bump of his prostate with careful, slow strokes. John fisted a hand in his own hair and tried to keep from flying to pieces.
Sherlock was a terrible mess: bright, pale eyes red-rimmed, smudged with dark circles, stubble on his cheeks and chin. His normally perfect hair - of which he was so proud - was a quashed bird’s nest of curls, flat on one side and tangled on the other. His white shirt was covered with yellowed stains, and he probably hadn’t showered in days.  His skin was sallow, his fingernails stained with nicotine. Everything about him seemed yellowed. John realized that one of the record players was blasting  Mozart’s
John thought that if Sherlock was teaching him how to dance with Sarah then he really ought to be the one leading, but he said nothing of it. Instead he smiled up at Sherlock, allowing himself to be led.
“Yes!” said John, and then another triumphant little “yes!” as Rachmaninoff, or Rocky, if one preferred, the slug finally made it to nibble at the leaf Sherlock held in his hand.
“Nope,” said Bill, standing by John. “I have absolutely nothing more good or fun to do with my time. I’d just waste it, really. Honest.”
“If it’s after or if it gets dark then I’ll ask Clara’s dad for a ride, I know, I know,” Harry finished for him, rolling her eyes. “C’mon, I know the rules, but do
sort of noise and a great heave, he managed to finally wrench the camera away out of sheer determination alone. He sat back on Sherlock’s hips, triumphant, keeping the git pinned while he started deleting photos. How the hell did you get to the photo gallery in this…? He squeezed his eyes shut as the flash went off in his face again.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, and crossed the distance between them so that he could pull John in for a kiss. “You’re very indecent.”
“I’m not looking for...ah… Yes!” Sherlock brandished a small tube of lube in triumph, then popped it open.
To which Sherlock would answer, “Did you hear about Gareth Jones? He collapsed of a fatal cardiac event in the middle of the live television production of
Normally John would have protested this with the fact that his mum constantly reassured him that he was still growing, but now he only sighed. “Are you going to ask about my Liz-Bean parents?”
John leaned away, but his eyes went to it as though magnetised.  The screen displayed one of the photos Sherlock had just taken of him, completely immersed in his newspaper, tongue making fluttering love to the puddle of honey on the spoon.  His nose wrinkled.  “I look like an idiot.”
John flushes so bright he can feel the heat in his throat. “Um...actually, this is Victor. He’s an old friend of Sherlock’s.”
On August 27, 1587 Governor John White sailed from the newly-founded English colony on Roanoke Island. He left behind the first settlement in the new English colony of Virginia, consisting of eighty-nine men, seventeen women, and eleven children. One of those children was his own granddaughter, the first English child to be born in the New World — Virginia Dare. None of these colonists were ever seen by English eyes again.
“I don’t wanna hear it! Eat your breakfast, John, and Harry, don’t talk with your mouth full, and both of you hurry it up. It’s quarter past seven already and if you don’t get going soon you’re going to be late for homeroom.”
“I knew him,” says the stranger, by way of explanation. His dark eyes are tired, with shadows smudged underneath from lack of sleep. He gestures at the grave with his bouquet. “Sherlock. We used to be...close.”
When John looked at the map with Sherlock he could see possibility unfurled before them. He could close his eyes and point his finger at any destination, and they would be able to go.
“You’d never be happy and you’d always be wondering why, what could possibly be missing. Eventually you’d run off, unable to take it anymore, and if you didn’t, if you stayed because of your compulsion to do the right thing, to be good, you’d be slowly dying, drowning in the mundanity of it all, just like all these people around you, with their dull little lives. Suffocated by normality.”
In New York, Sherlock says, the neon lights flicker all night, and the skyscrapers are tall in a way that reminds us that our ancestors once held a foolish desire to reach God.
“Nonsense, baby, everybody’s nervous their first time.” She kissed him, but he didn’t kiss her back. “Just relax, you’ll be fine.”
“Do you see anybody else here?” Sherlock made a grand gesture to show how empty the room was. “You have to be under observation; and who, do you know, is better at observation than me?”
“If fields of grass thrill you so inexorably,” Sherlock drawls, “then the ocean is going to blow your mind.”
Sherlock catches him looking and smiles. John thinks about Greek myths and something about six pomegranate seeds. Aunt Aggie would say it was the apple, but in the end, you were cast out of the garden all the same.
And then emptiness. John gasped with loss, the feeling of fingers slipping out.  Sherlock’s hands turning him over onto his stomach. Those same hands running down his back, gripping him possessively. Fingers painting slick trails down his skin, burn of shame at knowing what that slickness was. Sherlock’s hands upon his buttocks, the pressure of his thumbs, kneading him, then spreading him open. The night air cool on the wetness of that open, vulnerable place, his...his hole. John whimpered, buried his face into the pillow out of embarrassment at being so exposed.  Deep inside of him, an ache, an itch he didn’t understand.
John made a strangled sound in response, deep in his throat.  He shook his head;  with his mouth plugged up, he couldn’t say a word. With his cheeks flushed deep pink, he couldn’t lie. His dick twitched, drooling a trickle of precum, making it shiny and wet.
John did as he was bid, dropping down onto the edge with an awkward expression while Sherlock fiddled with the camera. “Um, what do you want me to do?”
Sherlock looked - indeed it was the Horned Slug that they had christened Rachmaninoff (that John insisted on calling a ridiculous nickname), unmistakable with its bright colour and leopard pattern.
Sherlock has beautiful hands - elegant and pale and long-fingered. They are a musician’s hands, the kind that can coax wood and string to sing, they are the hands of a scientist, slicing into a specimen layer by layer, until all the secrets of its anatomy have been found out. Kind hand, violent hand, cruel in gentleness, loving in brutality.
“I’m not so sure,” she said, and shook her head. “Sometimes when we’re together it’s like you’re here but...you’re not, like you’re off somewhere else.”
Every morning Sherlock left his house at 6 am in order to make homeroom by 7. You could set your watch by Sherlock’s morning schedule, not that John ever would, of course; but it was a
“You can research sex all you want.” John poked at the permanent little gaps between buttonholes in Sherlock’s gamely straining shirt. Sherlock must know how tempting those little glimpses of smooth pale skin were, or else he would’ve bought shirts that fit by now. “It takes practise to get good at it.”
The future - what of it? He was still too young for that to be anything more than a hazy ‘someday.’ He would finish school, of course, because that was what was expected of him, but then what? There was no Great World War waiting for him, no great world stage on which he would be a soldier or a hero - and what did he want to do with his life?
John made a small sound that vibrated straight up Sherlock’s cock and into his balls. Sherlock fought the urge to shove in, the urge to thrust, and only barely managed to contain himself. Instead he rocked gently, back and forth, on John’s tongue.
The moans fell out of John’s mouth like golden coins, rich, tumbling, unrestrained.  Press of Sherlock’s hand on his wrist, reminder to stay, and then hands on his thighs, spreading him open, keeping him open, exposed.
“What do you want in return?” John asked, suspiciously. It was the first bribe offer he’d ever gotten, and people generally did not bribe someone because they wanted wholesome things, like help walking their dog.
like Arawn. A lot of the pictures of him have been destroyed, because they didn’t want any remnants of him around or hauntings or anything like that. But they say that Arawn had ink black, hair as black as midnight—”
John, shivering beneath him, held down by his hands and panting, wanting to be pinned there. At once, small and slight; at once, vulnerable; at once, wanting. He could dislodge Sherlock if he wanted. Instead, the musk of arousal between them. John’s dick erect, trapped in his trousers. The head of him would be wet with precum if Sherlock reached his hand in and rubbed his thumb over it, but no, he’s not allowed to touch. Sherlock brushes against the bulge of it with his forearm, as if by accident, and the sudden sound John makes as he cants his hips up is all the evidence he needs.
It was properly dark now, and yet, he didn’t seem to be getting any closer to home. He quickened his step. He didn’t even wince at the chafing of his trousers against his skinned knees, the constant motion keeping the wounds open. He stayed close to the side of the road, following the yellow light of the streetlamps: briefly illuminated, as if by spotlight, as he passed underneath, casting a long shadow out onto the pavement of himself and his bike, and then back into the darkness.
Sherlock had eyes like the pale blue fire that flared when you first lit a stove. He had eyes like frost on metal pipes in winter.  And when he looked at you, he really looked at you, straight through you, straight to the core of you, down to everything that you were and up to everything that you are. Sherlock made John feel like his outsides were glass and his insides were a museum. He made him feel like the plastic anatomy model in Bio lab. He made him feel on display.
MERRY CHRISTMAS!!! I always associate Potter things with Christmas. THIS CHAPTER MADE POSSIBLE BY THE FOLLOWING PEOPLE:
His smile so languid and sure.  Something warm and foreign unfurled in the pit of John’s stomach; unexpectedly pleasurable. The young man splayed his hand against the insect screen, like a pale spider climbing up the mesh. “Won’t you let me in? Awful cold out here.”
“But you still kept in touch,” John insists. He’s not sure who he’s more righteously angry for - himself or Victor - that Sherlock hadn’t seen fit to mention either of them to each other. It really doesn’t matter anymore, but anger is easier than sorrow.
“Oh,” said John, and looked over to Sherlock, who was completely focused on his plant as he spoke. Sherlock did not look up at him, and was, instead, prodding at one of the growths on the plant.
“I’ll tell you when I first knew,” John said, wriggling a little, which admittedly caused Sherlock to regain some of the lost interest. “Right after the Yule Ball. You kissed me under the mistletoe. And I knew, and I didn’t want to know, so I pretended I didn’t know, and I spent so much telling myself otherwise, but…it was, as you say, so obvious.”
looking lost (and getting more lost than he looked), John was beginning to feel like someone had dumped a bowl of alphabet soup in brain. It was a cause as lost as he currently was.
I was prompted: drinking/drunk headcanon/fic. Have a little preslash with it, with a smattering of angst.
He should have known it was too strange to last. It was for the best, as he liked his own company - he preferred talking to intelligent people.
”And this, this is Mycroft,” Sherlock said, handing Billy off to John so he could present his (very, very large owl) with a grand flourish. Sherlock moved around a lot when he was excited. “He’s my great, big, fat dumb owl.”
“You’re absolutely wild,” Sherlock said. “C’mere,” and he twisted John’s clean, neatly-pressed shirt around his fist to pull him close and kiss him hot. John
Has to make up for it, do something cool, and he fists a hand in the lapel of Sherlock’s leather jacket to pull him close. “Do that again,” he says, and his voice only trembles a little.
” Sherlock said, and the melodic thrum of his name made John want to, really want to. He wanted to say ‘
Hazel looked. It had rained a lot that last week in July, and the ocean was heavy with it, the waves large and swollen. The sky was dark and the wind whipped through the trees as the rain pelted down in sheets of water. The sea was rising with the storm, and it appeared to be coming closer.
“Hey!” John tried, and feigned a look of surprise that he couldn’t really see, because he didn’t want to risk using the bakery window again. “What a coincidence!”
“Illogical, but okay,” Sherlock said. He took Billy back from John and placed him carefully onto the seat. “I like to play the violin when I’m thinking. Sometimes I don’t talk for hours on end. Would that bother you? Potential friends should know the worst about each other.”
Sherlock soothed the indentations of his teeth with his tongue, sucked a kiss over it that made John whisper, “
His room is exactly as he’s left it: jacket hanging on the closet door, trousers draped over a chair, bed made military-neat.
“Well, I can’t help it if I lack the idiocy required to know the non-annoying state of being wrong,” Sherlock said scathingly.
“Oh god, oh god,” John said again, words of invocation but not meant for any deity, the desperate prayers spilling out in the name of earthly pleasures instead. “Oh god,” John said - for Sherlock. John was gasping with each rub of Sherlock’s tongue slicking up his hole, the chains rattling as he shifted, squirming, the whole of him vibrating with barely-controlled excitement. He spread his legs so well, splayed open and wanting, offering himself for the taking. Sherlock would have praised him for it if his mouth weren’t otherwise occupied. He held him open, kneaded the flesh in his hands instead, one hand on the back of John’s thigh and the other squeezing one cheek. He held him with his thumb, pulling at that tight hole and forcing it to open, as he wormed the slick muscle of his tongue into that dirty, intimate place. John was so hot and tight inside, becoming wet with Sherlock’s spit as he laved his tongue against it. Sherlock would make sure he was dripping, sinfully wet and ready for him, by the time that he was done.
John adds hastily, “Oh no, not like that. He’s an old friend of Sherlock’s. We had a lot to talk about.”
John viciously stamped out the cigarette glowing on the carpet, already starting to singe a little. The bedspread and high-count cotton sheets were dotted with cigarette burns as well. He was
The changing of the hours: this familiar sound. Autumn was in the air with its apple crispness and the snap of cold, the smoky firewood scent of impending winter. In the distance, a siren wailed and wailed.
,” Sherlock said, while John felt slightly insulted at Sherlock’s assessment of his taste in music, which he happened to think was pretty swell.
They didn't meet at the funeral, although they had both been there. Then again, John does not remember much about the funeral. It was a possibility that he had met Victor then, that Victor had been amongst the throngs of strangers who had taken John's hand in theirs and given their condolences, squeezing his hand just so. “I’m sorry for your loss,” they’d said, pitched in different voices, doled out in different levels of sincerity; variations on a theme. They came in clusters, in twos and threes; they came alone, looking around as if unsure where to go. They had been past clients and gawkers and press. There had been so many unknown faces that John did not even recognise the ones that he did know.
He watched as Sherlock turned to leave, slipping gracefully down, branch after branch, making the precarious descent down the tree with the ease of one who did not know fear. Until he could not see him anymore, and Sherlock had disappeared into that dark and lonely night.
“Well, yeah, dummy, but it could have easily been me who was out sneaking about late at night. When did you get the bad boy reputation? Has all my hard work been for nothin’?”
. I observe. I deduce. The information is all there for anyone to access, it’s not my fault that the rest of the world is composed of blind imbeciles content to walk around in the imbecility of their awful, pointless lives.”
Sherlock loves the feel of John,  small and slim beneath him, the way his little body wriggles when his thumb rubs over the head of his dick. John bites his lip, which does nothing to hold back the traitorous little whimper that leaks out.
She fit perfectly in his arms; they were about the same height.  Lots of twirling, Sherlock had advised, could make any novice look like an expert. Sarah’s skirt was a cloud of pink taffeta and crinoline, and her overly sweet perfume swirled around them both. She felt surprisingly delicate, as if John could break her if he weren’t careful.
only yesterday, a personal victory that, while he had not directly admitted it to Sherlock, had been made obvious by the quiet
It was a bigger car than his mother's, he thought, clenching fists on his lap. A sleek dark racer, carefully maintained. Sherlock was looking at him, but John quickly glanced away. His gaze was strangely hot, and if they made eye contact, John had a distinct feeling he would burn up. He wouldn’t be able to look away. Be trapped, somehow.
John didn’t even hesitate for a moment. He ran out to help, of course, gathering up the papers and the books and quills that seemed to have spread out in a 5 meter radius.
This seemed to shock Sherlock. Had anyone ever told him ‘no’ before? He pouted at John for a second before his demeanor changed entirely.
John loved the movies. The plush red velvet seats, the red carpet, the curtains - they made you feel like you were really somebody. And then, when the lights went off, for 90 minutes to two hours, sitting there in all that darkness, you could be anybody. Everyone was so much bigger on the silver screen, so much more beautiful, their lives so much more terrifying and terrible.
“I’ve been telling everyone, they really have to fix that heating! Especially on a warm day like today. Careful, honey, don’t sit up just yet.”
Any other time, John would have distracted Sherlock with a kiss and gone down roads more sexually conventional, but two fingers rubbing the outline of his gland and the third lightly grazing the surface had him leaking like a schoolboy. “Sherlock, it’s not enough. Just fuck me already,
“No,” he said. “You can tell they’re not related at all by their lack of distinctive leopard pattern. So, not family then. Rachmaninoff is different from the other slugs. Did you see how they were clustered away from him in the jar? They were avoiding him, trying to get away from him. Nature does not take kindly to aberrations.”
” John said, indicating the book, which was open to a very lovely rendering of a person choking to death on Bloodroot, “you can borrow some comic books as...proof I’ll return it.”
and when he stopped by her house he was told to just drive on by. Her father wouldn’t even let him get out of the car. John had to escort Harry anyways and so he went stag to the dance.
“I’m just saying, you have an escape if you want to take it,” Victor says. “I won’t hold it against you.”
When they could find no sign of the living, the fleet's commander Simon Fernandez refused to let the colonists return to the ships. Instead he insisted that they establish the new colony on Roanoke. Even now, his motives remain unclear.
,” panting hard and heated. God or the devil depending; heaven or hell. Sherlock held John down and open with both hands, and forced him to take his tongue right where he needed it - pushing it into his hole, all hot and filthy and wet.
Quiet, all around them - the night, the house, silent with sleep. No sound of crickets, the insects having passed on with the death of summer, only the whisper of the wind in the trees.  Even the lights in the neighborhood had gone dark, and the stars flickered out of existence.
On Thursday, one of the older Hufflepuff boys attempted to trip Sherlock on his way to class. He was very nearly successful; Sherlock sidestepped only at the last moment, all his books intact.
It’s just that John had never thought of Sherlock in that way. If anything, he’d always pictured Sherlock a bit asexual, without much interest in women or men. Well, there had been Irene Adler, but that hadn’t been much about sex, in the end. An infatuation for her brilliance, which perhaps might have amounted to the same thing, for Sherlock.
Sherlock’s mouth on his was uncharacteristically soft - warm lips, gentle pressure. John’s heart clenched unexpectedly in his chest.  There was something longing about it. It wasn’t nearly long enough.  The kiss lingered on John’s lips for a while afterwards, like the last few drops of sweet wine upon the tongue. And John wondered, could this ever be enough?
“Yes,” said Sally grimly. “But that’s not all. He did - and still does - perform experiments on people. That’s not a rumour. Kids have lost hair and teeth! I’m surprised no one’s lost an eye!
He had been bamboozled, he supposed, by the sophisticated magic that was woven into the castle infrastructure. The protection wards surrounding Hogwarts, the wards that prevented Apparition; they were beautiful, intricate spells put into place eons ago, that had stood the test of both time and Darkness. But then there were the more simple things that fascinated him as well - the moving staircases, the enchantments on the ceiling of the Great Hall, even the floating candles were all dependent upon complex spells that took years of study to perfect.
John did, and felt his heart quicken with the way Sherlock was running his wet fingers up and down the inside of his wrist gently. There was something special and exciting about the way Sherlock was looking at him, but John didn’t know what. He’d never gotten excited over just being looked at before.
, Bill had corrected him) that were cats and snakes and owls and rats, no students had reported their pets harmed. In fact, John often saw Toby the cat roaming freely through the halls, with his owner chasing after him (he hadn’t learned her name yet, so he thought of her as Toby’s girl). Sherlock showed no interest in other people’s pets (familiars), although John knew he visited the Owlery both days to sneak treats to Mycroft, which was a surreptitious but not evil act. Per these observations, John concluded that the small animal population of Hogwarts was safe, for the time being.
John put his book down. He ran his tongue over his lips while Sherlock watched with great interest. “That’s true.”
They didn’t allow evil people to be Head Boys, did they? Surely there was some sort of screening process for that. Studying to be an Evil Mastermind certainly wasn’t part of the Hogwarts Curriculum.
He could practically see John’s hackles go back up. “No!” John snapped. “Last I checked, molesting their significant other with a camera was
James Dean, in his red jacket with the popped collar, all cool disillusion with his suburban life. Angry and unsatisfied, brimming with unspoken energy. And despite his rough-and-tumble exterior, inside Jim Stark was desperately lonely, searching for something greater, with a deep capacity for love.
“We do not raise our hands or wands to anyone. We never resort to violence. If you have a problem with another student, you come directly to me and I will help you resolve it. If someone is bullying you or you know someone is being bullied, you tell me immediately and I will mete out the proper punishments and help you deal with the issue,” Professor Hudson said. “That goes for all of you.”
His own body bucking, rabbit-trembling underneath Sherlock as he sucked nipping kisses down John’s chest and stomach. Over both nipples and then the soft, sensitive underbelly of him. The sharp sting of a little nip and followed by tender wetness and suckling warmth, each kiss a red bloom of pleasure.
“Are you stuck?” asked John as he approached. He was a young boy, just about John’s age, maybe a little bit younger but definitely not older. He had pale skin and dark, curly hair, and wide, pale eyes that seemed to almost glow in the low light.
He looked around the corner again - carefully, now; if he looked at the moment Sherlock was coming up the street he was sure to be seen - but a quick glance showed nothing more exciting than 85-year-old Mrs. Fujita, on her morning jog, and a little white cat that trotted across the street.
”I wonder what that was about,” John said, settling comfortably back, slumping a little against Sherlock’s side for the support.
Three smashed vials and one green-and-purple-splattered wall later, Sherlock didn’t feel much better. So he slammed his book shut and headed for the Hospital Wing.
you call a slug?” John asked, fascinated by the very thought that there was a proper way to go about such things, and curious as to whether this was common knowledge amongst all Wizarding children, or something just Sherlock knew.
He had had John like this for the better part of the past two hours. He had teased him, first with hands and slick tongue, then with toys that buzzed and wormed inside of him, making John squirm. It was a delight to make John squirm, to see the writhe of his body and the involuntary twitches of his cock. The noises he made were far more intriguing for the fact that they were quieted by the gag in his mouth. Again and again, Sherlock brought John to the very verge of orgasm, and then, just as he could see John tense and strain towards climax, he would take all stimulation away. He would slow the touches down, perhaps, pet him and relax him, touch him everywhere except for his flushed and throbbing cock, rub him inside everywhere except for his swollen prostate. He would tease John until he was a shivering ball of need, but John wasn’t allowed to come.
John sits down on the corner of Sherlock’s bed and tugs at the comforter to straighten it out. He smoothes it out with his hand, and then straightens it again.
And then his gaze turned to John. John could feel it sweep over him - the heavy caress of it over his skin, taking in his ruffled hair, his nice shirt, his casual slacks, and then up his body again, and the sweep of heat that followed. In his cheeks and in his chest and low in his stomach and in places even more intimate.
“Mr. Holmes, it was only a little Healing Potion...” Madam Pomfrey sighed. “There’s no need for such high-opera dramatics.”
John nodded, solemnly. “And....believing in a thing doesn’t make it true?” he offered. It was just about the only logical thing that anyone had said to Sherlock in the entire time he’d been at Hogwarts, so he smiled at John with obvious approval.
How he wanted to peel John open, layer by layer, wanted to dissect and discover him. He wanted to assail him with pleasure until he lost all composure and fell asunder in Sherlock’s arms; wanted to wrack him with sensation until Sherlock was the singular star in his universe. A harder pinch to John’s nipple awarded Sherlock with a little squeak of pain John couldn’t quite hold back; but he didn’t flinch or try to escape, and Sherlock sucked in his breath with realization.
“No rotting dead things under the bed, Sherlock,” Mycroft sighed. “We are not having this discussion yet
The entire time he spoke, Sherlock paid rapt, unblinking attention to him. “Fascinating!” he declared. “Negative and positives and they have acid inside. And they can explode. You must get me some batteries.”
“There’s some part of you that enjoys being scared,” Sherlock said - and John’s mouth ran dry. When had Sherlock come so close? His movements were so fluid, he poured like ink over the leather seats and suddenly the distance between them was nonexistent. “I can hear your heart pounding from here,” Sherlock said, and his face was so close, and he placed his hand upon the center of John’s chest. “I can feel it.”
It's the first time Sherlock has fumbled with his jeans in years. His erection has been trapped for so long that it feels like years. It’s been aching all this time and he’s forced it into a state of almost numbness by ignoring it. If he didn’t ignore it he’d have come already. If he didn’t ignore it he’d be inside John already, never mind the cries and protests.
He looked at John, very quickly, and then back to his writhy black potato again. He proceeded to scowl at it, as if displeased with its very existence.
going to be a real live ghost soon,” Bill whispered to John, “RIP William Murray, he died of boredom from Professor Binns’ class.”
“The stimulation, the signals, they travel to what has been termed ‘the genital part of the brain.’ In girls, the nerves conduct a response directly to the area of the brain that is receptive to sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix,” Sherlock continues, rubbing both index fingers in slow circles over the sensitive tips of both nipples, stimulating the bundle of nerves there.
Bill was especially unimpressed, but then again, John supposed he would be, since he came from an old Wizarding family and all. He hadn’t even understood why it was so funny that his name was Bill Murray.
helpful and ended pulling up bunches of parsley and thyme, mistaking them for weeds. His grandmother smiled and shrugged, the way that grandmothers are wont to do, and said, “I’ll put it in a stew tonight.”
John had never been a delicate child. He was not afraid of a little pain. He’d sprained his ankle twice, he had broken it once. He had fallen out of trees and off of bikes, and he’d torn holes in nearly every set of trousers he owned. He was what his mum called a “rough-and-tumble” kind of boy, but he’d had to keep up with Harry, who was a “rough-and-tumble” kind of girl. Between the two of them, the Watsons kept the local chemist’s in business from supplies of Savlon cream and plasters alone.
Sherlock’s other hand skimmed over him, down his body, between them, and it was, it was touching, pressing, at the tip of John’s erection, the newness of being touched by someone making John jolt, shudder, moan, “Yeah,” and again, that whimpering sound. Sweet sticky ichor of his desire spilling clear. Then no words because Sherlock’s thumb was pushing into his mouth, and John opened for him, yielding, hot, suckling at it as Sherlock rubbed his thumb along John’s tongue, feeling its soft wetness and John leaked, whimpering, into Sherlock’s hand.
he said, and tried what he thought might be a smooth smile. Oh, no. That just looked sleazy. He was creeping himself out with that one - not to mention the bakery owner who, upon spying him through the glass, gave him an extremely odd look.
By the time Sherlock gets home, it is well past midnight. His father is still up in the study, the paper open in front of him, not reading, smoking his pipe.
John Watson hadn’t a wink of sleep the whole two weeks before school started. Every night he’d climb out of bed to sneak books out of his trunk to peruse them, marvelling at the illustrations, reading them by torchlight under the covers. He especially liked the Monster Book of Monsters, as it purred when he drifted off, and sometimes it liked to cuddle. As a result of his late-night study efforts, some nights he never even made the journey to his room. Sleep would claim him in inopportune locations: on the couch, on the table, on the floor; with his cheek on the page, drool sticking the latter to the former, and he’d have to be carried to bed, muttering and squeaking the dreamt-up words of spells the entire way. He’d insisted on wearing his robes at home, despite the heat of the material in those early autumn weeks, with summer still lingering on its edges. Robes were allowed. His wand, however, was kept locked away from him. There was a very strict no-wands-in-the-house-rule, which was a wise decision - probably the only thing that kept all the Watsons out of St. Mungo’s that summer.
, like it was graven into his face and body too deeply to ever be erased. The crinkles of his forehead deepened and his eyes, their luminosity cloaked, sank deep into the shadows under his brow. It was as though life had punched him in the face till it had left permanent marks.
The planets dangle from string above John's bed, arranged in nonsensical formation. John sleeps curled up on his side, half-hugging the blanket. Downstairs there is shouting and the slamming of a door:
“Sherlock,” John whispered, tugging at the sleeve of the other boy’s robe to get his attention. Sherlock had been looking around, completely captivated by his surroundings. John wanted to know what he thought. “Sherlock,” he whispered again, because Sherlock was so absorbed that he didn’t seem to register the fact that he was being called. John did not care for being so blatantly ignored and finally grabbed Sherlock’s arm, shaking him a little. “Sherlock!” Startled, he turned to John, “What, John, what is it?”
Their church was old - considered historic, in fact; built about one hundred and fifty years ago, when their town was first founded. Since then it had been renovated a few times, fitted with modern amenities. It had been completely rebuilt once, at the turn of the century, after a great fire burned it to the ground.
Victor sighs and rolls over until he’s very close, peering up into John’s face. “I suppose that’s why I’m glad he found you. Or you found each other. He deserved to be happy. I think….that’s all I wanted for him, in the end.”
“No,” said Sherlock firmly. “Thanks, but no thanks.” He refused to meet John’s eye, instead furiously re-scrolling one of his opened scrolls. “I’m perfectly fine all on my own.”
"Not bad," John allowed, leaning in even closer. His breath was hot, heady and alcoholic against Sherlock’s cheek. "Sherlock Holmes, I am going to drink you  down. I mean, I am going to take you under the table."
“You know as well as I do,” said Sherlock, “that there’s a part of you that wants something more than that.” His moonstone eyes burned with intensity, and John was caught by them, unable to look away.
He probably never see him again. He would probably never experience anyone so magical again, not in his whole life.
Sherlock’s room still smells of him. Since Victor has moved in his sheets smell of the both of them, Sherlock and Victor both intertwined. John’s heart flutters a rapid tattoo in his chest, his breath fast and his whole body riding high on some strange crest of adrenaline, spiked with potent lust. But Victor is a gentle, careful lover, patient, slow - asking, “Is this all right?” with each touch, expertly stroking his cock in a way that John’s never experienced before, whispering, “Relax”, hushing, “Say stop if you need to,” with his fingers slick with lube sliding inside of John where he’s never had anything before, meticulously stretching him open, rubbing some place inside John that he knows, clinically, is his prostate but Jesus Christ how it shocks him, makes his body jerk and his dick twitch, and Victor is touching him and teasing him and stretching him until John is shaking and moaning for it, mouth open and gasping in Sherlock’s sheets.
The sea was rising. It would flood over the dunes and come up to their doorstep. The water would wash over the primroses and peonies in her flowerbed, drowning them. Seawater would seep underneath the door, into the front hallway. The locks would not be able to hold back the tide. The door would open and the water would come rushing in, flooding the house, filling up every room, coming for them, coming for John…
when a certain frantic little brother rushed into the room, shouting his name. “Mycroft!” Sherlock said, panting a little. He looked a fright, streaks of dirt across his face and leaves and bits of twigs stuck in his hair. And on his left shoulder, sat something fat, shiny, and wet.
Harry is waiting up for him when John lets himself in with the spare key she has given him. “Late night for you,” she remarks as she takes his jacket. “At least you don’t smell like booze.”
He repeated the second movement of Bach’s Concerto in G minor twice. Then he lifted his bow cautiously from the strings and watched his flatmate for a minute.
"You're a bit of a mystery yourself, John," he said eventually. As they passed underneath a streetlamp the light illuminated the sharp lines of his profile, his slicked hair. He was a portrait in black and white, like a star of the silver screen. And then back into the darkness. "Tell me about yourself."
“Gryffindor, that’s you,” the boy clarified, opening his eyes to give John the onceover. His eyes were startlingly blue.
“Don’t lie to yourself anymore,” said Sherlock, glancing at the cross upon the wall. “Think about what you really want.”
“I wouldn’t get it. I know,” she shrugs. “Look, I’m not going to pretend I am.” She peers into his face. “I think I stopped getting you a long time ago, little brother. Well, ever since you up and moved in with a mad detective to play Ginger to his Fred.”
“Of course, let’s not get too crazy with this,” she added quickly. “For your own safety, little brother. You might still want to tell people we’re second cousins twice removed.”
He rocked up, fast and sharp, a direct stab into John’s prostate, all swollen and sensitive for him.
Sherlock grinned at him--he could probably feel John’s cock jump, the prick--and ran a suggestive hand down the back of his thigh and over his arse.
He’d gone to sleep hugging his letter that night, shivering happily with his heart thrumming in his chest.
Sherlock presses John’s thigh against the back seat, leans against it and pins him there, keeping him spread open like a specimen for Sherlock's hungry, inquisitive gaze.  He presses kisses against the inside  of John's thigh while he rubs his finger, searching out the spot inside of him that would make him burn with pleasure.
John scrabbled to obey, letting out something close to a sob as he gave himself a good squeeze. His cock was hot and iron-hard, his hand sliding on the abundant lubrication of his precum. It was positively humiliating how completely his body had spun out of his control. He’d never leaked this much in his life. He could practically hear the slick squelch of his fist, dribbling more with each stroke of Sherlock’s cock inside him.
Sherlock realizes that in that moment he has John’s loyalty, as easily and as deeply as if he’d cut their fingers with a knife as children and pressed the beads of blood that welled up together until it smeared crimson between them.
Sherlock rewarded him with one of his weird little smiles, the kind that was a little crooked and wonky and strange, like he was an alien trying to imitate human expressions. It was a little funny-shaped and it wasn’t quite happy but it was amused and maybe a bit happy all the same. John realised that this was the first time Sherlock had smiled at him since they’d met.
“You’re mine,” Sherlock growled, squeezing John’s dick hard. John's gasp pierced the air, and he came with a shout, unable to control it, the sound of a man pushed to his limit and shattering. His seed spilled out between them, some on Sherlock's belly  but mostly splattering wet and warm on his own. His body clenched around Sherlock’s cock as he shook hard with the intensity of his orgasm. He milked Sherlock's dick like the whole purpose of his existence was to service him and Sherlock surrendered, molten heat twisting deep inside and then pulsing out in waves of pleasure, coming inside of John, spurting hot liquid pleasure deep into his bowels.
Sherlock smirked in acknowledgement of John’s interest, dropping the belt, opening the button on John’s trousers and then tugging down the zipper.  The hiss of it sounded loud to John, despite the radio and the loudness of his own heart. John pushed his trousers down, stepping out of them until he was just in his briefs. If he hadn’t done it himself, Sherlock would have, he was sure. The way Sherlock was looking at him made him want to, ridiculously, cover himself up. Hands over his nipples and crotch or something. As if there could possibly be something here that Sherlock hadn’t seen before.
“Have you ever thought about what would happen to you, if you lived your life following the path that’s been laid out for you?” Sherlock continued. “Blindly following someone else’s rules?”
Sherlock caught him looking once. He’d caught John watching himself being watched,  and Sherlock, he’d smirked, just a twist of his lips that somehow made something reflexively twist inside John’s body, as if the two could be somehow connected. Sherlock’s lips, John’s body. Oh God. What a connection to make. He’d tingled all the way up to and through last period, and when he got home later, he couldn’t make sense of any of his notes from that day.
“So, where to?” asked Sherlock. John's fear ebbed, a little. Sherlock had the voice of someone who could be trusted.
Sherlock told John about the shipwrecks he’d seen, what treasures there were to be found. He told him about pirate ships that still had the pirates inside, adorned with swords and guarding treasure in the afterlife. He stroked John's throat again, tickling him, making John giggle, while he described the wreckage of a giant ship, torn in half when it met an iceberg. He told John about what the sun looked like, glowing and wavering, when you looked up at it from the depths of darkest water.
Finally Sherlock seemed to have found something not-horrible, because he snatched it up with a triumphant
And then he shoved up hard, both hands holding John down, bodies smacking together, forcing him to sit flush against his hips, completely impaled upon his cock.
John sighed and began to lean in, presumably to better assess Sherlock’s pupils for signs of a concussion. Sherlock quickly raised the camera and snapped a photo. Knotwork acquired.
"Get it off of him, you incompe-...Pomfrey!" Sherlock cried, and in one swift move, knocked the potion out of her hand so that it spilled, splattering big red drops on white hospital sheets before the bottle clattered on the floor.
The way Sherlock was looking at him was certainly helping with that. “Just think of me away over in Germany on a case.” He pressed his cheek to the side of John’s head and spoke into John’s hair, voice dropping to a coaxing purr that rolled through John’s muscle and bone. “Missing you terribly. Opening that photo on my phone to remember just how soft your lips were when I covered them with mine. What you tasted like. How warm and strong and pliant you were in my arms when I held you and bent you backwards in my eagerness.” He swayed illustratively, arching John back a little. John shivered again; he felt Sherlock smile into his hair. Sherlock’s lips brushed John’s ear as he tilted his head to murmur, “And then what we did next, after I put down the camera.”
“You’ll have to take some zucchini home with you, dear. We’ve already given a bunch of them away and they just keep coming in!”
At this moment Sherlock is down to the last cigarette of his pack, he has smoked it down to the filter, and he is pushing himself up off his car, his body vibrant with energy, illuminated, aflame.
It had happened only last summer to a boy who was quite a few years older than John, nearly a teen, almost. He had swum out too far and then disappeared. It had been all over the news: images of policemen and their dogs roaming the beach, boats with their torches floating out far into the water, even helicopters with their great big searchlights that spread out over the ocean like pale, fluorescent moons. But the dark water had stubbornly refused to give up its secrets, and nothing of the boy was ever found, as if the sea had simply swallowed him up.
a coincidence,” John muttered to himself as he scanned the street. No, that didn’t sound suspicious in the least.
Finally John pushed at Sherlock’s shoulder, and it was like pushing at solid marble. Panic flashed through him - until Sherlock pulled back, and John could breathe again.
Sherlock’s hands upon his bare shoulders and then down his chest, rubbing, squeezing. Sherlock’s hands at his trousers, fingers skimming over his hips, grabbing his hips, squeezing his buttocks, John could barely think about what was happening, only that Sherlock’s hands felt so big, seemed to cover so much so easily, and then there was Sherlock’s cool tongue sliding inside his mouth. Sherlock’s hands at his nipples, tingling sensation where he’d never been touched before,  pulling forth muffled whimpers and sounds John didn’t recognize as himself.
On Friday, John did not follow Sherlock. Which was why, he supposed, that by the time he walked in, it was far too late.
,” Sherlock said, and brushed his fingers, cool and gentle, over John’s cheek. “We’re all mad here.”
The pressure on his throat increased and John’s brain sparked bright blue, and he felt the thrusts inside of him as deep pleasure that reverberated down to the red marrow of his bones. Too much, too much, he was trembling, panting, sweaty, clenching around the hardness inside of him. Shuddering hard and strangled keening sound, cut off suddenly by Sherlock’s hand covering his mouth, his wet mouth open against Sherlock’s palm as he spasmed and spilled white all over the sheets.
Sherlock sucks hard enough to leave a soft red mark right above John’s nipple as reward then; another over the xiphoid process -the bottom of the sternum; another over the manubrium, at the top, and another right in the middle, body of the sternum, body of John. Another hickey slightly to the left of the last, right over his heart. John’s skin will be splotched with reminders of him tomorrow. When John gets dressed in front of the mirror in the morning, he will see the marks of Sherlock’s mouth and teeth all over him.
The shutter went off, and John relaxed. The kiss had been sweet and brief. But before he could get his feet flat on the floor, the hand at his back was knocking him off-balance, pushing him into Sherlock’s body and pinning him close while Sherlock curled in over him to capture his mouth in another, fiercer kiss. The searing, toe-curling possessive force of it pushed John’s head back, arched his whole body into it till he had to cling to Sherlock to stay upright.
There were meant to be words. What were words? There were blank spaces and nothingness where words were meant to be.
And it wasn’t that he was unused to being stared at. It was not a thing that bothered him, normally. But to feel the heaviness of eyes upon the back of his neck, even when he sat in the very last row in Biology, where he never sat, was a bit too much.
Sherlock stroked a thumb through the fine hairs at John’s nape. “You and your self-consciousness again.” Pressed close like this, his voice vibrated through both their chests. Bloody hell. If only John could record
“A great, powerful wizard,” Sherlock said, emphatically. “Well, that or a Muggle who stupidly wandered into some magical crossfire. I haven’t decided yet.”
All his wants, these simmering, shimmering feelings, brewing all this time, had now come to a boil. He was overflowing, and it must come pouring out.
. There are more creative uses, too. For example, did you know that a treacherous Devil’s Snare looks exactly like the innocuous household Flitterbloom? Switch one for the other, and you’d have the victim watering and nurturing their very own murderer.”
Mycroft stood up, straightening out his robes. He always looked so detestably impeccable. “So, can I trust you to give Hogwarts another try?”
John pursed his lips, exhaling through his nose. The faintest bit of hesitation; it was clearly for show. His cheeks had begun to colour pink, his eyes gone heavy-lidded. He licked his lips again. “Can I… Can I work up to it?” he finally asked.
When he led her out onto the dance floor he found himself emboldened with the newfound confidence of one who has a vague idea of what they are doing. His steps were sure, and he took care to look into her eyes instead of looking down. He did not even step on her feet once.
“Right,” John says, pushing the power button on his phone to turn the screen off. “Yeah, he could be like that.”
“Oh, tell me you don’t actually believe that old bit, do you?” she’d laughed. “You’re such a square,” she said, and kissed him on the cheek.
is getting stitches,” said Madam Pomfrey, to two very disappointed boys. “That’s positively barbaric. What you need is a little wound cleaning, an Episkey to fix you right up, and lots of bedrest.”
He reached into his pocket, now that he was alone, and gently fingered the soft ear of the small stuffed puppy toy that he’d carried onto the train with him. It was embarrassing, he knew, to still have a stuffed animal at eleven, but he’d had Gladstone ever since he was a baby and he didn’t know how he could possibly sleep without him. Especially since he’d be so far from home…
Then he looked at John, who currently far exceeded the qualifications for “hopeful little face,” dark blue eyes rapt and wide, focused intently on Sherlock. There was a sudden, dizzying moment where Sherlock realised he held the power of life and death in his hands, and, moreover, he had the power of one John Watson’s faith invested in him.
“So you like horror?” Sherlock asked with genuine interest. Every answer John gave him seemed to brighten him up.
“ ...Tom found me all soaked to the bone. What could I possibly have told him? I know it’s ridiculous, but I can’t shake this feeling. There was something out there that night.”
“Listen, do yourself a favour and stay away from Sherlock Holmes,” Sally said. “You don’t want to go messing around with the wrong sort.”
,” mumbled Sherlock, wallowing in his misery. On top of everything else, he now had to deal with the idea of having a completely useless overachieving brother, as well, who thought that the cure for everything was just sitting here and doing nothing and rubbing his back in a most annoying manner.
John, a Buck Rogers fan, tries to engage Sherlock in a conversation about what it must be like to be a Space Wanderer, to be hurtling through the vastness of space at hundreds of miles an hour and then to suddenly break off from everything you’ve ever known and fall, all alone, down to a strange planet. Sherlock says that firstly, space is full of a whole lot of nothing and is therefore completely irrelevant, and that secondly, the Space Wanderer is a rock, and rocks don’t much care about loneliness or separation or anything at all, but he poses for a picture with the giant space-rock with minimal grumbling, so John eventually forgives him his lack of imagination.
He’s unable to discern, then, the pounding of footsteps thudding on grass from the pounding of his heart, whether the flush on his cheeks is from rushing blood or the chapping wind. And then he stops, and his heart stops, and the world stops, and realises how utterly
When Sherlock walked to classes, no one walked with him. In fact other people, even older students, gave him a wide berth, as if he were a man with a great white beard and a staff, who was capable of parting the ocean.
for anon's request for more Greaserlock porn drabbles! To celebrate 300 followers I fulfilled this request.
“So wear a turtleneck,” Sherlock tells him. He begins to work on a fresh bruise, at the pulse point of John’s left carotid artery.
The energy seeps out of his muscles, his limbs, and a calm settles over him. His body goes limp, unable to support himself anymore, slumping back against Sherlock’s body. Just like a doll now, warm and tight, a toy whose only purpose is to be fucked, to be used and filled. He is reduced. Nothing more to give away.
.” The clever hands on his thighs caught in the crease where leg met hip and pulled John down against a hardening cock. John could feel the heat radiating through all the layers of their clothes. He lost his breath like Sherlock had just sealed their mouths together and sucked it from him. It was a simple rub of their clothed pricks; why did it feel like he was sixteen and ready to hump until he came?
Instead he looked down at the table again, and noticed yet another guest he had somehow missed before.
The original Tulsa was part of Indian Territory and first settled by the Lochapoka and Creek tribes in 1836. They established their settlement under a large oak tree at what is now known as the intersection of Cheyenne Avenue and 18th Street. Their new home they named
. But there were no more clicks of the shutter, only Sherlock’s heavy, shaky exhale against John’s face as though he’d been swept up just as thoroughly as John had. John moaned under those peremptory lips, around the imperious tongue surging in to fill John’s mouth. It was intoxicating to be wanted so much. His own need rose up in him, demanding. John gripped Sherlock’s shoulders to pull himself tighter and opened his mouth wider to him, inviting Sherlock into him as deeply as he wanted to go.
“It was Harry,” John says - Harriet, of course, and John is the only one in their family who calls her the way she prefers. “That morning she had been out to collect the eggs, which she hated, and I made her do it because it was her turn, and if I hadn’t seen it in time then...I don’t know what, then. They get crazy when they’re that starved.”
And then all of the nearly-5-stone and almost-50-inches of John Watson, smallest boy of their year, launched himself at Carl Powers and descended upon him with a mighty fury that was terrifying to behold.
John was still riding out the crest of his orgasm when Sherlock shuddered heavily and gave a throaty groan as he came. Liquid heat flooded the depths of John’s body, wet and warm, almost silken against his sensitised insides. John sighed; the sensation of Sherlock’s semen inside him was intensely erotic, every time. It still surprised him how much he liked it.
The colony of Roanoke, located in what is now known as Dare County, North Carolina, was one of the first settlements in the New World. On August 17, 1585, Sir Richard Grenville left Sir Ralph Lane and 107 men to establish a colony on the north end of Roanoke Island, promising to return the next April with more men and more supplies. The group built a small fort on the island.
Sherlock’s lips were brushing against his ear, each word like a kiss, “You might not have the words for it, you might not know the mechanics of it, but there are things you feel, you
He pressed their foreheads together, brushed his fingers over John’s temple where the man had pressed the gun. He was a dead man now. Sherlock closed his eyes and heard the now-familiar sound of bullet piercing flesh, saw the distinctive red hue of fresh blood, he squeezed his eyes shut tight and wanted to squeeze the trigger all over again.
In the darkness it was so real, so intimate. The press of their bodies together, Sherlock’s weight on top of him, his bare skin cool on top of John’s heated skin, and the nudge against his inner thigh that John suddenly comprehended as Sherlock’s hardness, his erect -
Madam Pomfrey, as testament to her unending patience, did not even acknowledge Sherlock this time but instead pointed the business end of her wand at John’s face.
Their bodies fit together obscenely well. His body covers John's smaller one so easily; the size difference between them is obvious, and it's wrong how that observation makes Sherlock's hips rock involuntarily. But only a fool would mistake any of it for fragility. John can take anything Sherlock can give him and more.
Some of the ladies were fanning themselves with gloved hands, looking like creamy ornate cakes gently wilting underneath the drooping flowers of their Sunday hats. Most of the men remained stoic and red-faced in their suit jackets and ties, although one would occasionally fan himself with his hat and say to his neighbor, “Whew! It sure is warm.”
Sherlock grinned and dropped to his knees. He slid both hands up John’s thighs, massaging them, before he firmly pushed them apart.
“Come on, John,” Sherlock said - and John liked the way that Sherlock said his name, although there was nothing special to it, it just had a nice, comforting sound - “Hop in. I promise I won’t bite.” He then flashed John a quicksilver smile, friendly gleam of white teeth in the darkness, and John heard himself laugh and say, “Yeah, all right. Thanks.”
“Oi, John, what’re you doing?” shouted a scrawny boy with brown hair and glasses. (Half-blood, raised with magic, parents divorced, lives with grandmother.) “That’s the
Just for Sherlock, they had produced one John Watson. Not even science could have predicted the pitch of his laugh, easy and guileless, when caused by Sherlock’s words, or the expressive wonder of his features when he exclaimed, “Amazing!”; his admiration neverending and addictive. What was the coding for the flush of his skin, underneath Sherlock’s fingers, or the light taste of salt as Sherlock licked at his navel in reverence for this miracle, or the musicality of all his soft sounds as Sherlock’s tongue flickered in and out of the tiny little hole?
His mother loved this song. It used to play on the radio all the time when John was younger. He remembered a night in May, after the dishes had been put away, the kitchen still warm from the oven, smelling savory from the roast she had made for dinner. Yellow bulb of the kitchen light casting a warm glow over everything. “Come dance with Momma, John,” she’d said, her lipsticked mouth laughing as she swept him up into her arms. The swish of her skirt as she twirled with him around the room, giggling, the heady, floral scent of her perfume -
He and Mike had been playing catch, and the ball had gone over John’s head (a lousy throw) into the woods; all the trees and wild green things that bordered the property. It was always dark amongst the trees, no matter the time of day. John ventured in like a jungle explorer, wary of dangers (such as poison ivy).
“He probably deserved it,” Victor replies, words half-muffled by the blanket. He resumes singing quietly.
you? They say that you’re friends with that freak, Sherlock Holmes. But you’re not his friend. He doesn't have friends. So who are you?”
“It’s what couples do, isn’t it?” Sherlock wheedled. “Jeanette still has that photo from last Christmas up on her Facebook, and you never complained about that.”
“Mr. Holmes,” Professor Hudson said, a great deal more kindly than she’d spoken to either Carl or John. “Although I am not your Head of House, I am still your professor, and I want you to know that you can come to me with any issue at all. My door is always open.”
Comforting touches all over John’s skin, that made him tingle pleasantly.  He was at once soothed and glowing, lit up from the inside.
“Well,” said Mycroft, “I promise you that one day I’ll have the power to have people thrown into the Forbidden Forest for you, how about that?”
“Mm,” Sherlock hummed with approval. The feeling was mutual. It pleased him when he and John were on the same page.
John bit his lip. His fingers itched to raise the window. It would be so easy. Who had written the rules, anyway? Who had decided that they must be put into place?
"Please," John corrected himself breathlessly. He laughed a little, that sound just as breathless, and Sherlock laughed a little too, the irony of Sherlock reminding John of his manners not escaping either one of them.
And then Sherlock lifted his own wrist to his mouth and bit down as well. His blood was a dark, dark red, rich with a slight sliver gleam - thicker than John’s, its drip so slow.  He took their two wrists and pressed them together, their veins cut open and flowing, their blood mixing together.
But for now, right now, they touched, and kissed, and laughed, and teased; each one all tied up in the other, neither of them able to think of any place better to be.
It made him feel used - no longer a boy but rather a vessel, insides pounded into pliant pink softness. Wet hole for the taking. (
, came an unbidden thought, and she didn’t know where it had come from. It was not something that Hazel Watson would normally think.
“You know,” John says, picking a piece of beef out of his chow fun, “sometimes I don’t know why he did the things he did. Most of the time, actually.”
Stupid brain is broken; Aunt Aggie’s the last person John wants to be thinking about right now. He thankfully doesn’t think of her anymore when Sherlock’s tongue slides against his, Sherlock’s body pressing against him.
“Your wife is going to leave you,” he told Dr. Berman, his voice calm and impassive, reading his psychiatrist with cool pale eyes unblinking.
The poor animal had been split open from throat to belly.  Like how Mike’s dad had shown them how to gut a fish.
"Like you?" John asked. He took a quick little breath when Sherlock slipped his small, cool hand down, and rested it right over where John's heart would be.
“Fine,” Bill said. “I choose to trust you for now, John, because you are my friend. Please do not betray that trust by claiming my life as blood sacrifice for your evil Lord and Master.”
“Hufflepuff,” Sherlock said, of Hermia Alexander. She wore glasses and and had long dark hair. John guessed Ravenclaw.
John managed a few mournful bites of his eggs before Harry jumped up from the table, shouting, “Race ya to school!” and ran to the door to grab her backpack. He was running after her, toast in mouth, grabbing his backpack, when suddenly, his heart clenched up as he remembered -
John was lying on the sofa, moaning about his shift, as usual. Apparently there had been an encounter involving urine and vomit. It was that kind of a day.
It was enough to drive a man crazy.  People call Sherlock crazy either way, and so he had done what came naturally, and slammed John up against the lockers and kissed him, full and harsh on the mouth.
Sherlock’s smile was sharp, his eyes jewel-bright. “Are you ready to ask for it, then? What you want?”
“I met a friend of yours yesterday,” John said, resting his chin on his hands while he watched the cauldron bubble.
Searches in the woods surrounding the Watson residence at 10 Chelmsford Street have turned up nothing thus far. Neighbors state that they have not noticed anything out of the ordinary.
“So good,” Sherlock praised him, voice rumbling deep in his chest with luxurious pleasure. He pulled back slowly and relished the slide of every inch, rocking just the first few inches of his dick in shallow thrusts at first, teasing. John made a soft, keening sound, pushing his hips back, needing to be filled. Sherlock stopped, hesitated for a moment, petted John’s hair and drank in the pleading expression etched into John’s wonderfully familiar features. There had been a time when he could have never seen an expression such as this; there had been a time, tonight, when he thought he might never see this expression again. He nudged their mouths together softly, kissing lightly, right before he slammed his hips forward, cock shoving in so hard that John lost his breath.
Sherlock slips a hand over John’s mouth, clamping down to feel his own name against his palm, the wet press of John’s open mouth against his skin.
Madam Pomfrey uncorked the bottle. “Violence, Mr. Holmes - and Mr. Watson - is never the answer,” she said. And then she forcibly tilted John’s chin up and proceeded to burn his wound with acid.
“N-no!” John spluttered, so quickly and earnestly that he regretted it the moment the little word left his mouth. As soon as he saw Sherlock’s smile widen he
That would have been perfect! For a brief, wild moment he considered running back and shouting it at her, but thankfully sanity returned to him before he made an even bigger arse of himself.
On Monday, John was alternately ignored by his Housemates or shoved past when they walked by. Being of small size and stature, this sent him on some spectacular stumbles, but he managed to recover and stand his ground, only dropping his books once.
“Oh, hello there, Watson,” Carl said, turning around to him, wand out and eyes bright. “Care to join in the festivities? Sherlock and I here were just playing a little game.”
- “Old Town” in the Creek language, which was later bastardized by white men’s tongues into “Tulsa.”  Even when the place was new, it was still old.
“Fucking-! Give me that!” John rasped. A mighty struggle for the camera ensued, John hugging it to himself like a rugby ball while Sherlock clung to it stubbornly with his obnoxiously big hands.
When John looked at Sherlock, however, and beamed and beamed like he’d just watched an Abraxan take flight into a stunning sunset for the very first time, and he whispered, “You’re a
One is a sex bed, the other one for sleeping in, Sherlock explains, for true efficiency. They end up using both for both purposes, not caring.
Sherlock kissed the back of John’s neck, soft at first, and then he dug his teeth in, sucking hard. John cried out and bucked. It was going to leave a mark. Sherlock loved to leave his marks all over him. The first time Sherlock had taken him for a drive, John had come home with exactly eight hickeys forming on his neck. He knew that it was eight because he had stood in front of the bathroom mirror and counted and touched each one, shivering as he felt the phantom sensation of Sherlock’s mouth on him, hot and wet and demanding.
Deeper into the cave, it was quite dark, only getting darker and darker where the sunlight couldn’t reach. It made John feel like he was standing at the entrance of a long tunnel that went on forever. Or maybe it went deep, deep into the earth, into a world where no sunlight shone, and entire cities sprung up like clusters of mushrooms, flourishing by lamplight and fireflies and glow worms alone. There was no real way of knowing.
Tries not to think about it when he looks at Victor. Doesn’t watch his mouth when he talks, doesn’t imagine the shape of his mouth on Sherlock’s skin. He doesn’t look at his throat or consider what it might look like purpled with love bites. And when Victor comes out of the shower, water dripping off his dark hair and trickling down his neck and then lower than that, John definitely doesn’t think about Victor and Sherlock at the pool, their wet bodies rubbing against each other, tongues and mouths wet and slick with water and saliva.
John found himself stepping forward, almost reflexively. He wanted to be closer to that voice, those eyes. And maybe closer meant other things as well, things he had no idea of and could not name, but the growing heavy tug in the pit of his stomach promised it would be
Victor orders three drinks from the bartender. John suddenly realises that one of them is far more drunk than he originally thought: Victor for forgetting how to count, or himself for seeing double.
, oh wow, an owl, oh wow he owned an owl, how brilliant was that!) and his trunk and then all that was once order was chaos. All that he had known for his entire admittedly rather short life was now standing on the platform, waving up at him, and he didn’t know anybody and he was on his own.
) muffled, vibrating around Sherlock’s tongue,     scream trapped inside his head, in   his    head-
“Yeah, I thought as much,” Carl sneered. “That’s ‘cos you’re pathetic,” he said, and shoved at Sherlock again.
“Oh, it’s boring,” Sherlock replied, and waved his hand dismissively. “Besides, it’s hidden. It’s a hassle to get it out.”
“Shh, John,” Sherlock chided, kissing the sore spot. “Someone might see. And then what would you do?”
“Oh, yes, yes, three continents, spare us the gory details,” Sherlock countered impatiently. “All your previous encounters have been with women. When it comes to men, you are woefully...lost.” His hands inched up further on John’s thighs, stroking the crease of them now. One hand slid up, fingers sliding along the border of John’s jeans. John could feel Sherlock’s fingertips dancing over the thin material of his shirt, underneath his jumper. He could feel Sherlock’s body heat seeping through, all the places they were pressed together.
“You might fool most people with that good boy act, John, but then, I'm not most people.”  Light and then shadow passed over Sherlock’s face as they drove, shifting his features, one moment a movie star, the next a phantom. Something dark and unknown. Light. Shadow.
“A pirate,” Sherlock drawls blandly. He looks down at their hands, John’s fingers intertwined with his.
Forensics would later find the bullet in the wall, and from the angle of penetration into the suspect’s skull, from the path it had tunnelled through the no-longer functioning brain tissue, investigators would be able to deduce the trajectory of the shot fired. Later on, when the reports were filed, the time of the shot fired would coincide with the arrival of the SCO19 Response Team. One SFO in particular, Ms. Verona Jackson (collar #547) would confirm that she had indeed fired her weapon on scene out of necessity in a hostage situation, and would document appropriately. Afterwards, she would be sent to after-action stress debriefings per the standard operating procedures. The mental health of any officer is just as crucial as his or her physical health.
He should have felt a resounding internal roar of triumph, then, when he saw John two days later in the Great Hall, laughing with his new friends at the Gryffindor table. Because he had known that that would happen, eventually, either once Sherlock was Sorted Slytherin or when John learned about his reputation. John was very normal -
Sherlock’s cock inside of him, the force of Sherlock’s body pushing into him, hips against the curve of his backside, Sherlock’s mouth against John’s ear, lips kissing his hair, his hands all over John’s body, clutching, squeezing. It was so big, it was inside him, it was
Coming back to 221B is like that: a waiting embrace, the comfort of home. Similarly, it is also like a punch in the gut, a hand the grips his intestines, twists them around a fist and squeezes.
“No fair!” John pouted, but quieted when Sherlock put both his hands on his shoulders. They were cool, and soft.
“ I will even offer you a weekly care package from Honeydukes to sweeten the deal. All the Chocolate Frogs and Fizzing Whizbees and Ice Mice you could possibly stomach,” the Head Boy continued, which was an awfully tempting offer. Fizzing Whizbees were the
He thought of all the ground he had already covered. It would take him just as long to turn back, at this point, as it would to make it home.  No, he had to keep going. He would make it home.
He fixed the straps to both of John's ankles; the colour of the leather was the same hue as freshly dried blood. He admired the red of it against the warm tones of John's skin.
His face burned with humiliation at the treachery of his own body, this state he once again found himself in. He beat Harry to the shower, turned it as cold as it would go, and threw his overheated body into the freezing spray; cold droplets stinging his skin just as hot tears of embarrassment, helplessness stung his eyes.
Sherlock went to a cafe afterwards and had himself a cup of strong Spanish coffee, black with too much sugar. It wasn’t the way that John would have made it.
"Ah, yes...the bravery of the little Gryffindor. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think?"
So it was a wonder when he didn’t jump or scream, when it happened - what he’d been waiting for, what he’d been dreading: the knock at the window.
“We’re in Kansas,” Sherlock says, absolutely disgusted.  “Five hours ago we were in Kansas. And we are still in Kansas. We’re never leaving Kansas. I hate this country. It’s a nightmare. Eternal Kansas.”
,” Carl said as he immediately drew his wand. This spurred, very predictably, a quick draw of wands from all around - John and Sherlock, of course, but also Bill and Mike, as well as Anderson and the Ravenclaw boy named Wilkes.
They had decided to head west, the way that dreamers do. There’d been a little argument at first about where to go, all the cities John had never seen yet- Los Angeles and Boston and New York and London.
He’d never had alcohol on its own, really, without the accompaniment of heroin or cocaine. It was not a bad experience, insofar that he could tell.
Never in a bed, never thought that far, never in the intimate sanctuary of John’s own room where he has him now, moaning into a pillow and small hands fisting into the sheets, pushing back against Sherlock as he pins him and fucks him hard. Scrape of his teeth against John’s skin and Sherlock bites down on the bad shoulder; remaking the area of injury into something that can belong to him. Fucks him like he wants to crawl up inside of him, figure him from the inside out and indeed that would be just fine. John’s little body just made for sex and vice from the way he shudders with pleasure around Sherlock’s cock filling him up. John is  mumbling, words unintelligible and Sherlock never wanting to miss a word has to lean in close, tug John’s hair with his fingers to tilt his head back brushing deceptively sweet kisses against the side of his face.
There are no family portraits. There are school portraits of John and Harry together and individually, and a few portraits of their mother when she was younger - a real looker, in her day. It’s hard to tell in the black and white photos, but Sherlock knows John has her eyes and her golden hair.
The collar was retrieved from the nightstand next to the bed, along with a tube of lubricant, the latter set aside. John bared his throat for him, that universal gesture of trust amongst wild creatures; his submission a gift.
“Anyway, it’s probably good you don’t really hang around that creepy Sherlock Holmes kid,” Bill said. “I was worried when you wanted to go sit next to him in Potions, like maybe he’d cast a spell on you or something.”
He kissed John again, the sensation eclipsing all else. No room for thoughts or worries. He tasted like cigarettes and the crisp firewood scent of winter, of things burning. Something strange underneath all that that reminded John of dying roses, a perfumed staleness that he couldn’t identify. Liquid, silken kisses that made John dizzy with the heat and ache of his own body, that made him forget how to move, how to breathe, how to keep himself from making tiny strange noises of wanting.
John yelped and bucked, his hand fisting painfully into Sherlock’s hair. Growling his pleasure at the show of force, Sherlock resisted the pull and moved over to the other one. John cried out again as Sherlock applied teeth, but there was a sensual, falling note of bliss in his voice, and the way he arched, chest and then hips, up against Sherlock had nothing to do with resistance.
“Here,” Sherlock said, drawing a line with one finger across John’s chest, below his collarbone, above his nipples. “That’s where your blush stops.” He bent and pressed a kiss to the invisible line he had drawn. “That’s why I’m dressed. It makes you completely out of control.”
They sit together and watch the whole thing. Sherlock would have gotten bored with the ridiculous premise and heckled the film from beginning to end.
For the past two summers John worked as an usher in the movie theater making $1.10 an hour, which was real decent, especially for someone still in school. If he worked really hard, sometimes he could make up to 30, even 40 dollars a week. Most of it went towards groceries when Momma forgot, or couldn’t make it to the store. Come November it would go to birthday and then Christmas presents for Harry. John knew that money was tight and that he needed to help out since he was the man of the house, but somehow the liquor cabinet was always stocked even when the fridge wasn’t and so he never told his mother exactly how much he got paid. She was a hard-working woman but she was full of sorrows. John saved compulsively, never knowing when those rainy days were coming. There would always be something that needed fixing, the money was never enough, and sorrows always hovered on the horizon.
Detention was to be served in the Hogwarts greenhouses, where there was a tragic shortage of deadly plants, according to Sherlock. John thought this was probably a generally good thing, but Sherlock saw it as a sign of the school’s poor allocation of resources.
His confidence is addictive, makes John’s skin prickle with pleasure at the base of his neck and all down his spine.
“Of course!” said Bill, smacking himself on the forehead. “Why didn’t I see it before? You’re small and light and I bet you’re really quick. Perfect!”
Victor picks himself up, propping himself up on one elbow to look at John. He sings: “Picture yourself in a boat on a river, with tangerine trees and marmalade skies.”
murder, which was just as good. Not the murder of Muggles part, that was terrible, and really he didn’t think Sherlock was one of
"Sherlock!" John said, unable to help smiling - his second smile of that day - despite the fact that he was in very real danger of being kicked out of Hogwarts forever.
These photos capture you like that, John, in the very moments that made me so hard in my trousers that I most likely have the imprint of my zip on my cock right now.  And you want me to delete them?”
The pads of John's fingers dig into his shoulder, into the back of his neck. John's blunt nails bite half-moon crescents into his flesh. Let him. Let John mark him with the smudges of his fingerprints, uniquely John, unlike any other set of prints in the world. He wants John to dirty him up with his prints, press them in all over while Sherlock claims him, pushes inside deep where no one has ever been before.
“We take fighting amongst students very seriously here at Hogwarts, Mr. Watson. And so early on in the year, too,” Madam Pomfrey reproached. “You don’t seem like that type of boy, but heed my warning that multiple offences shall be met with various disciplinary measures, up to and including expulsion.”
“You should probably get him home while he can still walk,” said Lestrade, and Sherlock scowled, reminded of what a terrible idiot Lestrade was.
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you’d feel… uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he’s up to. Maybe some insurance that he does his homework,” the Head Boy answered, in such an ominous tone that John wondered if they chained you up in the Dungeons in Slytherin House if you didn’t do your homework.
He’d loaded it onto a parade float for the Centennial celebration, rolled it into town, and then left it there after the parade ended (as it was growing too big for his barn, Sherlock says). Now it towers over them, at least 11 feet in diameter, and full of twine (about 1,600,000 feet of it, Sherlock guesses).
He doesn’t know what to say, so he doesn’t say anything at all. Instead, he pulls Victor back down on top of him, the scotch numbing his fear, his trepidation, making his movements bold and smooth. He kisses him again, moans into his mouth when Victor slides his hand between them and rubs at John’s hardening cock. Kisses turn frantic, needy and rushed. John doesn’t know what to do but Victor guides the way, Victor guiding his hands, showing how how to touch, and the feel of another man’s cock in his hand for the first time is another one of those familiar yet alien things, like touching his own, but the angle is all wrong, and his palm becomes wet with another man’s precum and he’s still hard with Victor touching him, kissing him, kissing his mouth, his jaw, sucking a wet, harsh kiss upon his throat. Victor positions them, shows John how to spread his legs so that he can fit between them, John made pliant and warm by alcohol, gasping when Victor takes them both in hand and strokes them both, hips thrusting, the two of them rubbing against one another. John is caught off guard by how much he likes it, how good it feels and how much he wants it, just this, Victor nuzzling into his ear, breathing him in, his body rocking on top of John’s on the sofa, until his orgasm ambushes him and he spills all over Victor’s hand and his dick and Victor holds him tight and thrusts a few times more in the wet warmth until he comes between them as well, their semen mixing together.
“So,” said Professor Hudson, taking a seat on an equally squashy armchair across from the boys. “Would anyone like to tell me what happened Friday afternoon?”
“I had a wonderful time,” Sarah said, and John replied that so had he. He smiled at her, took both of her hands into his and squeezed them gently.
And before John could ask what was going to hurt, Sherlock opened his mouth and bit down on John’s wrist, piercing the soft flesh with his sharp white teeth.
“When the Devil comes to you he is beautiful. ‘Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light;’ so says Corinthians 11:14. That is why he is dangerous. Nowadays we are surrounded by temptation; and we must worry about our youth, who are particularly susceptible. The Devil comes to our youth in the form of fast cars, cheap thrills, and especially that evil known as ‘rock and roll’ - tempting our youth to sin.
“You’re still an idiot,” Sherlock said after a moment. He gave a little harrumph of exasperation and touched John’s forehead, very gingerly, with the sleeve of his robe, applying light pressure to staunch the bleeding.
“You know I can’t,” he said. He curled his fingers against the windowsill; his short fingernails scratching against the eggshell white wood.
“It’s true,” Mike nodded. “I watched him make Sarah cry because he told her her parents were going to split up. Sarah had no idea. She thought her parents were happy. And of course it was true, like he Cursed her or something.”
“Hey, has anybody seen Harry?” said a melodic girl’s voice. John could hear the noise outside the entrance to Gryffindor Tower. The secret society had come to collect their wayward member.
Instead he looked at himself in the mirror, once again. His hair had stayed neat, where he’d combed it down. He looked astonishingly well for someone who had been missing as much sleep as he had; there was even a healthy pink flush in his cheeks. Behind him, in the mirror, was his bedroom. Comforting, familiar, everything in its place: the perfectly made bed, the lamp, his bookcase, the record player, the locked door, the closed window.
"Well, I thought...it'd be really cool, wouldn't it?” John said, and he actually smiled. “If you had special powers. Not the evil part, that's bad, but the power part. You could use your powers for good!"
John’s hands both clenched in the sheet. He didn’t understand this feeling that had risen up in him all of a sudden. He had a terrible headache and he was dealing with a concussion, and now Bill was dismissing what he was saying because Bill overreacted to everything. It was usually very amusing and it made John laugh a lot, but right now he didn’t feel like laughing at all.
That was where Harry found him. John was surprised to see her alone, detached from her usual group of giggling ladies. He hadn’t seen really Harry alone since they’d first boarded the Hogwarts Express, and had rather thought she’d gotten absorbed into the group as the fourth head of some amorphous, giggling four-headed monster. Or maybe it was like being part of some magical secret society where you always had to be in contact with at least two other members under threat of death. Or a bad hair day.
John nods, reassured. Nothing below the waist and his purity’s intact; he really is an idiot sometimes. Sherlock doesn’t mind so much.
“Obviously,” said Sherlock, as if this were a very normal reality. Although, to be fair, the little rabbit glowing like a fairy had been part of a very real reality.
“More,” he demanded, desperation scraping in his throat. Teeth bared and head thrown back, he undulated for Sherlock, riding his fingers to underscore the need behind his demand.
“I mean it,” Victor says. “Work hard, play hard, right? Except Sherlock never worked all that hard. He would get other people to do it for him. I was never quite sure how, since nobody liked him all that much. Blackmail comes to mind.”
His eyes were gleaming as he told John about the creatures of the deep, monstrous and strange, fish with lights and giant jaws and animals that didn’t look like anything real at all. His fingers stroked the soft blonde hair at the base of John’s skull as he told him about the intelligence of an octopus, although they were all tentacles and no brain, and how you could engage one in a game, if only you had the time and the wisdom to ask.
“We're not putting a picture of me next to a body on display in our living room. It upsets company." John turned back to his keyboard and poked it with an air of finality.
“Maybe, yeah,” said John, tilting his chin up. “Who cares about stupid nature?” He stood up and peeled off his moustache, slapping it down on the table.
The neurons in his nervous system light up with electrical impulses in the dark; each axon firing off the same message: pure need.
"Open your eyes and look at me," Sherlock says, suddenly overcome with irrational need. He needs John to see him, to know who was fucking him, taking him, claiming him. As if it could be mistaken. As if it could be anybody else. But he cannot allow for even that miniscule improbability, the tiny margin .0001% of doubt.
“I don’t know,” John repeated. He was currently more concerned with the sides of triangles than with the high school social scene. “I don’t much like dances.”
Even so, John had the distinct feeling he’d promised something he shouldn’t have, and bit his lip, as unease squirmed about in his gut.
“Oi! Hold still so I can squeeze you,” John told the Bubotuber sternly, but it paid him no heed. He gave one of the shiny swellings on its body a firm squeeze while it wiggled around, sending a projectile spurt of yellow-green goo arcing up into the air and splattering onto a desk, completely missing the bottle.
His lashes were little slivers of wet gold against his round cheeks; his hair plastered down in dark gold curls against his sweet brow. He was a heavy doll in her arms. There were no signs of life.
Sherlock kissed him, sweet and deep, the fingers of one hand trailing through the edge of John’s hairline. Yes. John parted his lips, because it made sense, just now it was the only thing that made sense, the softness of Sherlock’s lips, the slick heat of his tongue, the taste of him…
Unpacking would take two weekends’ worth of work, at least. The sooner she got it done, the better. Hazel opened one of the boxes and lifted one of John’s little jumpers out.
They took to locking John’s door at night as well as the front door, per Dr. Mullaley’s recommendation. Hazel swept the halls and scrubbed the floors and hoovered the carpets, until there was no sand anymore.
When John’s head fell back on a sigh, Sherlock claimed his mouth, sucking the nectar from his tongue.
Dusk has settled upon the cornfield, the sky deepening in bands of colors. They’ve missed the sunset entirely. John doesn’t know when the light fades and the stars flicker into being.
As soon as Dahlia had gone, Harry said, “Okay, listen, I know you’re probably all nervous and all that because you’re you, but you needn’t be. Mum and Dad told me to look after you, so I’m gonna. But you know all those cop movies you like? And like the cops sometimes go undercover to protect people, yeah? That’s how it’s going to be with you an’ me. It’ll be safer for both of us if I’m undercover. So when we get to school, the special mission starts. Don’t talk to me, don’t look at me, and in fact, you should pretend we don’t know each other. It’ll be for your own good.”
“I’m not sure about this,” John admitted. Still panting, feeling weird, scared and wrong. He’d only wanted kissing, really, had only thought so far. He had no idea what Sherlock intended to do, what he wanted, only that it was sinful and bad and wrong, so forbidden that John had no comprehension of it.
She crumpled to the floor, a confused John bundled up in her arms. Holding him tight to her chest, she rocked back and forth, back and forth.
Which was uncommonly perceptive of Lestrade, since he was, but it had nothing to do with the police.
“You’re mine,” he said to John, hot and panting into his ear, one hand reaching down between them to find John’s cock, hard and hot and leaking, aching for his touch. He grinded the head of his hard flesh right into the bump of John’s prostate to feel him tremble and to see him cry out.
“Called 999, got him to the hospital, of course. And they woke him up - a little naloxone always does the trick, as you know - and I stayed with him, and within an hour he was right as rain and complaining again, demanding to be discharged and terrorising the nurses. He refused to believe that he’d almost died. I told him to go to rehab. He sneered at me. So I left. Went straight home and packed my things.”
“Three States Watson,” the dollies all titter, even the fast senior girls giving John eyes in the hallway.
“Because tomorrow is Saturday and I needn’t attend any classes,” Sherlock drawled, like it was the most obvious thing in the world and it bored him - because it
The water looked black in the moonlight, hungrily lapping at the shore. High tide. The ocean was coming in. Hazel thought of searchlights on the water, of dogs and police boats and of empty nets, nothing found. Water churned inside her stomach, black and restless. She felt seasick.
),   only a shadow. Sherlock was making senseless noises of comfort but inside his body John felt raw, oversensitive, Sherlock’s hands upon him, gripping into him as he drove himself deeper, that scorching fullness inside of him that forced out soft small sounds of protest.
Those thrusts - filthy and bad and right where he needed it, cleaving him open. He was dripping wet. The weight of Sherlock’s body pressing him down into the bed, held so tightly that he couldn’t move, he was completely enveloped, surrounded, invaded, and with every hard shove of cock inside of him his peaked hard nipples and his dick rubbed, rubbed against his own sheets.
John kicked at the water, making a little splash and letting out a big sigh. He put his chin in his hands and he wished, hard, so very hard, for Sherlock to come back.
“Good riddance,” said Sherlock, when Madam Pomfrey had left the room. John looked at him, reproachful and hurt, until he realised that Sherlock  had intended it in regards to Madam Pomfrey, not a Hogwarts sans John Watson.
It doesn’t make sense. He had thought for years that it was the sun around the earth; thinking on how overwhelming it would feel if one were constantly moving, constantly in revolution, thinking that this is how he feels; the noise and the stimuli of the world in constant revolutions around him, deafening, and nothing makes sense.
Two drinks later, John was not dancing on the bar. Perhaps if he could have gotten up he might have. At the moment he was rather precariously balanced, swaying a little, as if to the horrid bar music. A young lady approached, doubtless to ask John to buy her a drink, and if Sherlock slipped an arm around John’s waist, it was only to keep him from falling off the stool.
“See?” Bill whispered, once Sherlock was out of sight and he apparently had permission to breathe again. “Pure evil.”
- Sherlock imbued that word with particular scorn, until it was a little burst of a black scribble in his mind - who very obviously did not like Sherlock, and moreover, sought to poison John’s mind against him. It was enough to make one want to throw things against the wall.
In the window, stripes of red glowed bright across the white flesh of the Lord’s back. The sun scattered drops of red onto the congregation like rose petals, or perhaps flecks of blood.
“Are you doing anything for dinner?” Victor asks. “There’s a Thai restaurant around here that I’ve been meaning to try.”
For dinner they had zucchini bread and zucchini pie with the stew. The children surprisingly enjoyed the pie, even though John declared it “very too much green.”
“Dead, interesting,” said Sherlock, placing the cup of tea down on the table. “Dead is such a subjective term. By definition: No longer living, deprived of life. And yet here I stand before you.”
John’s mouth was so perfectly hot and wet all around him. And when John hollowed his cheeks and sucked it was almost too much, this velvet tightness around his dick. It was difficult to believe John had never sucked cock before him. That knowledge was rapturous in itself; how inexperienced John had once been, the chastity of his mouth now tainted with the fruit of knowledge.
John shivers underneath his fingertips like touching a nerve exposed. His stomach is tight and concave when he sucks in a breath and holds it. He doesn’t flinch, doesn’t move away when Sherlock’s fingers curl tight and grip hard and hold him, holding onto him.
Madam Pomfrey returned after a while, as she had said she would do, and this time she brought a steaming vial of  greenish-brown potion. Sherlock first took her to task for being ten minutes later than she said she would be, and then he demanded to know what was in the potion and every step to making it, and then he wanted to know if somehow the ingredients could have been tampered with, unbeknownst to her.
she began, and then cut herself off quickly when the shadowy form of Madame Pince swooped by behind them.
"Does it feel good?" Sherlock wants to know, torn between watching John's face and the sight of his own finger, rubbing in and out of the tiny little hole.
“Pareidolia,” said Dr. Lawrence, “Is the very natural psychological phenomenon of finding meaning in the meaningless, to recognize patterns when there are none. It is the reason why some people find a man’s face on a moon crater, or Jesus on a slice of toast. While some might say it is an overactive imagination hard at work, it can happen to the most logical and rational beings among us. The brain tries to make sense of its surroundings. When those so-called paranormal investigators say they hear ghostly voices on their recordings, that is simply a form of auditory pareidolia. Sometimes a toasted cheese sandwich is just a toasted cheese sandwich.”
“You’re getting your nice robes all bloody,” John said, distressed. He knew how expensive robes were because Mum had stressed that he had to be very careful, and he knew how expensive
John shuffled a little guiltily. It was true. Mrs Hudson had taken a picture of them smooching under the mistletoe at the Christmas party last year, just before Jeanette had dumped him for being a better boyfriend to Sherlock than to her (oh, the irony), and John hadn’t put up a fuss about that.
.” He’d been waiting for over a week to get his hands on that book, as it was in the Restricted Section of the Library, and it had required quite a bit of work on his part to acquire it. Mycroft considered it inappropriate reading. “You’ll get far too many ideas,” he’d said, without even specifying whether the ideas were
The want that he could not name, the strange ache he’d known ever since he’d met Sherlock, his heart pulsed with it, the systole and the diastole.
The leg of a chair rolled under his heel as he stepped back. Sherlock landed with a sound thud and a loud “ugh.” The next thing he knew, he was sprawled on the floor, getting a unique perspective on the crack that had been developing in their ceiling.
Carl had not arrived alone: he was flanked by an older Ravenclaw boy on one side, and a Hufflepuff boy on the other. John remembered that the Hufflepuff was a bedwetter called Anderson. He felt bad that he remembered the first fact before the second, but then Anderson spoke.
with a frowning skull printed on the label. There was a bowl full of bright red apples, all of them carved into with random letters and symbols. John could make out the letters:
John awoke to an earthquake, or rather, he was being roughly shaken awake. His first thought was of Sherlock, because that seemed to be Sherlock’s forte, manhandling people with head injuries, until he heard Bill’s voice say, “Oh, thank great Merlin he’s alive!”
He lets Victor guide him down to a chair - by some happy accident, it just so happens to be his chair. Or perhaps Victor is that observant, he doesn’t know.
Mycroft was the one who found him, all of thirteen with his hands buried in another boy’s hair, his tongue in another boy’s mouth, the boy’s hands down his pants. Out in back of the house, behind the shed where even the servants rarely go, the afternoon lazy with midsummer heat and the cicadas buzzing around them. Sherlock remembers the sweet scent of freshly crushed grass, Mycroft’s look of complete lack of shock, the exact spot where his own skull connected with the ground -at the fusion of the occipital and parietal plates - when the boy shoved him off and the exact pitch where an adolescent voice broke as it proclaimed, “I ain’t no queer!”
"I wouldn't want to disrespect your wishes," Sherlock says. "Nothing below the waist, right? I couldn't do that to you. I couldn't wrap my fingers around your dick and stroke you just right, and squeeze and rub you until you come all over my fingers. I couldn't take your cock into my mouth and lick and suck on you as if you were the most delectable treat I've ever had. That would be unkind, wouldn't it, John?"
John forced himself out of bed, headed to the bathroom for a much-needed shower. Just the movement made him wince - not out of pain but rather humiliation, disgust - overly aware of the unpleasant damp spot in his pants.
Sherlock pulls his mouth off abruptly. "You can't," he says. He gives the underside of John's pretty cock a lick, down to his balls. John gasps, shudders wonderfully.  “You're not allowed. I'm not even inside of you yet. That's when you're allowed to come, when I'm inside you and fucking you.”
John and Mike shared a glance that said that they didn’t know if “debonair” was quite the word for it, but to be fair, at least they hadn’t gotten pelted with food this whole time.
“I know,” said John, and stopped where he stood, frowning. “And that’s why I don’t get into cars with strangers.”
aloud, and so threateningly, too. It wasn’t a nice word to say, and if he’d done it at home he’d have gotten in trouble for it, for sure, but there was the thrill of saying something so
“There’s something in your pocket of interest. Let me have it.” He held out one pale hand, open palmed. John stared, appalled at his lack of manners.
“Okay,” said Sherlock. That last statement was remarkable - not necessarily because of the movie part , but because of the implication that they would be spending time together in the future.
“Where’s your mummy and daddy?” John asked, because he was sure his Mummy and Daddy would be scared to death if he were stuck somewhere. He also knew that in any sort of trouble situation, you were meant to get a grown-up to sort it all out.
“You’ll be just fine,” Mike reassured him. “And if I can’t have your bed, can I at least have your stuff?”
“But no more rifling through my things,” Mycroft warned him, “And stop snooping in my room. There will be dire consequences if you do.”
“My recommendation is a holiday,” said Dr. Lawrence. “I will write you a prescription for some low dosage anti-anxiety medication that may help, but the most important thing is for you to get away for some real relaxation. Perhaps a little jaunt to the countryside will do you right.”
“Umm…He used to make a barking noise,” John explained, cheeks warm with how babyish the toy was. But it wasn’t Gladstone’s fault that that was the way he was designed.
If the collapsing star manages to hold onto a critical amount of  mass, the material of the star is squeezed down into the singularity of one of these regions of impossible pull.
John had never been afraid of the doctor’s, unlike Harry, who had always had to be tricked or bribed into going. Whenever he’d had to have injections and they would tell him that he could look away if he needed to, he always took it as a personal challenge, and would stare directly, defiantly, at the needle that dared to pierce his skin.
“Well, that might be true,” John conceded the point. “But I don’t think you can just go around turning people into newts.”
“Well, I don’t know what an Umboogu Slashkiller is,” John admitted, “but I don’t think Batman’s like that. He’s in comics and movies and stuff.”
Sherlock was right, after all. He was always right. Being right made him happy. It was a reassurance that the universe was a logical place.
John looks at him, freshly-showered, sitting there in his grey shirt and comfortable pyjama bottoms, stylish hair ruffled, doing his work next to Sherlock’s disturbed experiment. In the background, Cat Stevens sings about the first cut being the deepest.
being the next -  with styled dark hair and a leather jacket and pale skin that, in the darkness, seemed to be painted in the soft blue tones of twilight.
Maybe. Getting close. But it was hard to tell if the surprise was subtle enough, or whether he looked like he’d just gotten shocked from an electrical socket.
That's all it takes, really; it's like everything that has been holding him together up to this point shatters. His hips thrust in brutal, punishing rhythm, fucking John into the seats, rubbing, grinding his cock into him hard, into the spot that makes John fall apart with pleasure. It's a miracle in itself that he has the semblance of mind to find John's erection between them and give it  the few harsh strokes it needs before John is shuddering and shaking, against him and around him, coming hard with a bright, keening sound.
“Yes,” said Hazel, for she was a reasonable woman. She did not mention the small, white hands and large, hollow eyes for the same reason.
“As if,” Sally continued in a whisper, “there’s such a thing as accidents with Sherlock Holmes. The weirder magic is, the darker it is, the more he likes it. And you know what...? One day, just ‘experimenting’ isn’t going to be enough. One day, he’s going to be
Sherlock threw himself face-down on the bed. “aaarrrgrghhhuuuuuffffff,” he said into the pillow, a sound of general frustration.
of each word, and then tug John's mouth towards his again, hands running over his back, rubbing down to cup and squeeze the curve of his ass.
They stopped searching for the missing boy after one week. The newspaper stopped reporting on it after two weeks. And every night, before and after every radio program, between
John emerged from the cave shortly after, stepping out, blinking, into the bright sunlight. He held his pail in one hand, filled with shells and stones, but the special stone, the token, he’d slipped carefully into the pocket of his red swim trunks.
He reached between them and grabbed John’s flushed and twitching cock, stroking him through his second orgasm. His palm was lubricated with John’s precum and the semen that he’d already spent. “You’re such a filthy slut,” Sherlock breathed, ever so fond.  ”That’s it, go on and let go for me.”
to him,” said Bill. “Or that he’s cast the Imperius Curse on you and that’s why you’re hanging around him all of a sudden, because no one would subject themselves to that willingly. It’s bad for both of your reputations, really.”
“No!” Bill cried, aghast. “If John gets expelled no one is allowed to take his bed! We shall keep it exactly as it is, forever, to honour the memory of our sweet John Watson, taken from us far too soon.”
“Batman fights for justice,” said John, “and he’s different, because some people think he’s scary, because he always comes out at night. But that’s why they call him the Dark Knight. He gives bad guys something to be afraid of.”
John shakes his head, teeth at his lip. How could he want without knowing? But he does not deny this, either. And when Sherlock slides down there is no room for ‘
“Even supposing that you were correct and John and I had actual motivation for attacking you - and being a Dark Wizard fledgling does not count, really, that’s stupid, what would I have to gain? - the logistics of it don’t work out. Never mind the fact that John’s last class of the day is Transfigurations, which is across the school from the Library, so physically John could not have been in the same place as you and I when we first ran into each other, after the bell rang at 3:30. If the story goes as you say, and it was John and I who ambushed you, then I would have had to be physically involved in the fight and yet only the two of you ended up with injuries. Now, you may suggest that perhaps I held you down while John landed the punch - a fairly ridiculous accusation, but not entirely illogical...except when you consider the differences in our physical size. You, of course, being a Third Year Beater for the Quidditch team and with the typical physique to match, and myself being an ‘ickle firstie’ as you’ve been so happy to point out before - I simply don’t have the upper body strength to be able to hold you down, especially not long enough for John to throw a punch, and - given your aggressive nature - without getting hurt myself. Perhaps I used magic, you might say, altering your story a little because surely you would have mentioned magic before this; however, a quick Scan of my wand to show the last five spells cast would reveal nothing more threatening than a Wand-Lighting Charm.”
Hazel looked out at the water. There was Harry, there was Cara, there was no sign at all of a little blond head bobbing in the water. “No!” She sprang to her feet, fear making her voice high. “I can’t see him!”
“Sleepwalking is not uncommon in young children,” Tom reminded her. “That’s what Dr. Mullaley said.”
It was Sherlock’s first time playing for an appreciative audience. (His mother did not count, as she had the same effusive praise for him in his early 30's that she had for him at the tender age of 4.) John watched him, leaning forward, chin resting on the palm of his hand. His eyes were wide and Sherlock noticed, not for the first time, how blue they could actually be. His mouth was parted, just slightly.
On his left hand, on his ring finger, there was the slight gleam from a well-polished gold ring, although blood now trickled down half of it. He was approximately 37, no, 35, younger than one might expect for a drug lord, designer suit and gold Rolex speaking of one eager to show off his wealth, typical of a person who had grown up in abject poverty, as Kamanev had: a thieving, starving child in the ghetto. He owned a cat - no, two - from the stray hairs on his trouser legs. He wore a heavy, overly gaudy gold locket around his neck. Sherlock didn’t need to look inside to know that it contained pictures of his children. Obvious.
“Slugs...?” John said. He looked into the glass jar on the table, recently retrieved during the waiting period, and then he paled.
“Hmm. Perhaps I should assign you two some homework, then?” said Professor Hudson, thoughtfully. “Since you do have so much wasteful free time after all, according to Mr. Murray, and nothing productive with which to fill it.”
He glanced down to John’s mouth, which had suddenly become desert-dry. John felt his voice lost to the badlands. His heart lost to - something.
“No, no, no,” Victor insists. “It’s all right. I owe him a drink. Serious word of advice: never owe a Holmes anything.”
“We are meant to live our lives in the light. We are meant to be home before the sun sets. And if you should stray from the goodness and the light, that way darkness lies.”
This close, he could see flecks of green in Sherlock’s eyes, like chips of broken bottle glass. The light in his bedroom glowing above them formed a yellow halo around Sherlock’s dark hair.  He could see the shine of his own saliva on Sherlock’s lips. And then he saw nothing as he closed his eyes, mouth opening for another kiss.
He bent over, untied his laces, toed off his shoes. Unsure how to be sexy about the whole thing. His hands fumbled with his belt buckle a little too long, but he could only play with it so long until that came undone as well.
"Right here," Sherlock reminds him, insistent, "That little bundle of nerves linked directly to your genital response. This is what it feels like." He rubs it again and John's breath hitches, he makes a fascinating little noise, and he squirms, and the seat creaks beneath him.
“It’s just like popping a giant bubble wrap,” John noted. “Well, pus-filled bubble wrap. That grows on a slimy, squirmy black potato.”
“Vain bastard,” Victor corrects. “Held on to those wigs for months afterwards after I told him I thought he made a fetching blond. Used it again when we went to Dr. Rao’s Symposium and told everyone he was a visiting Professor by the name of Sylvester Hennypen.”
“You can touch, if you like,” Sherlock said, noting John’s interest. John hoped he had not been staring. Mummy said that was a rude thing to do. But then again, if he hadn’t stared, then Sherlock would not have said it was okay to touch it.
It would have been done in two shots. First a chest shot, the part of the animal big enough to aim at from a distance and John going for a kill-shot but it would not have been fatal, not with the animal low to the ground, the probability of the bullet piercing the heart at the correct angle too low. The next shot would be the headshot, a quick kill, as much a mercy killing as it was to dispatch the animal. John does not hunt for sport. He would consider it cruel. If he kills he kills out of need, so some livestock had been threatened, perhaps, or even a family member.
When Sherlock hedges close John tenses, knowing much about fighting and what to expect. Growing up small he’d had to learn kids some respect, had himself learned the taste of blood early on in life. He can sidestep a punch easily enough but doesn’t know how to miss this, something else this, hands on his shoulders and his back slammed up against the locker, and time slowing to molasses when Sherlock’s face comes close and then closer and then -
John, needing to feel solidarity, allowed Bill to put the moustache on him; it affixed itself immediately to his upper lip and made his nose twitch a little, almost like a rabbit’s.
“Oh,” said John. “That’s true.” And then he smiled at Sherlock, which was fairly alarming because most people did not smile at Sherlock at all - not unless they were in fear for their lives and they thought some faked pleasantries might appeal to the small percentage of him they could consider human. Even then, it tended to be a disgusting, fearful little grimace. And yet here John was, healing from a concussion that he’d acquired on Sherlock’s behalf, face half-lit by the
John could feel the pale eyes upon him, roaming all over his body, taking him in. Over his mismatched striped pants and checkered pajama top, over his messy slept-in hair with the cowlick, over his neck, exposed, over strip of chest and throat. His skin felt prickly all over with the attention. He felt himself, exposed, even though he was mostly covered.
“No, Jeanette, I don’t mean just…” he made a gesture that indicated the perfection of her body, her open blouse and hiked up skirt, white bra, flash of white underwear, his own trousers undone, “...this. I mean...everything. You and me. I just don’t….I’m sorry. You’re amazing, but I can’t do this. I’m sorry.”
, too. He’d like, slice them open and look at their insides and brew potions out of human parts. And some people say he was a nec…necro-romancer, like he raised the dead and stuff.”
Then again, the worst that could happen was that Sherlock would say no again, and John had already been through that once before. Well, technically, the worst thing that could happen was John getting Bubotuber pus in his eye, but that could happen whether or not he asked Sherlock to be his partner.
It turned its head and looked directly at her. Those horrible lambent eyes burned like coals in the darkness; they were burning, staring at her.
The wind was crying outside. Its voice was a high-pitched shriek. The thudding got louder, faster. The wind was wailing. The tapping grew more insistent.
"Don't tell me it's a case," John groaned.  Under his breath, he referred to DI Lestrade with a few choice phrases, which may or may not have included 'sodding cockblock' among them.
Dinner lasts over three hours, their food mostly growing cold as they try to fit eating in between the talking. At differing points they each come close to needing the Heimlich (and Victor does know how to perform it) as they choke on curry puffs and rad na over stories of John and Sherlock dressed up as ninjas, and the time that Sherlock burned all his hair off in chemistry lab, and remedied this with wigs until his hair grew back.
But between his legs, he was hard, aching, and wet, first nudging, then pressed against Sherlock’s stomach, his smooth, bare skin.
While searching he noticed something even better, the tree that went up the side of the house, with sturdy enough branches. Sherlock was fond of inviting himself into John’s bedroom in a similar manner.
His world shifted and he found himself on his back, lain down on the softness of his own bed, without remembering how they got there. He certainly didn’t remember moving from point A to point B. Then again, with Sherlock looming over him, with one cool pale hand sliding up his shirt, John could barely remember his own name.
John ends up back at Baker Street. Homing instinct: the ability to find one’s way back to a particular fixed point even after travelling long distances over unfamiliar territory. If he died tomorrow he wonders where his ghost would go - only he doesn’t believe in any of that nonsense.
The adults had adult conversation; discussions about the rising price of petrol, what they thought of Prime Minister Thatcher, the fact that Mrs. Harold down the road had bought a flashy new car and so soon what with her husband passing away and all, and how the fence needed mending so perhaps Tom could help with that tomorrow.
“She was just posturing. It’s merely an empty threat meant to keep you in line,” Sherlock said blandly, as he pressed the dressing to John’s wound. It tingled faintly over his skin and, oddly, inside.  “Besides, even if it were real,” Sherlock continued, “Mycroft would never let it happen.”
Sherlock said, his whole little body sliding closer in the shallow water, hand still on John’s wrist. His voice had taken on that odd, pleasant little thrum to it again, that made John feel like he was listening to a lullaby.
“Jeanette. You know. Tall, dark hair, grey eyes, slim.” John would not say beautiful, although she was.
They’re apart in an instant, a good four feet of empty space and guilt between them by the time Mrs. Watson finds them.
And then, to further worsen matters, John said, “Thank you,” in a very sincere tone which Sherlock did not understand, because people did not generally thank Sherlock  for anything unless it was the cessation of something unpleasant that he’d been doing. Furthermore, people did not thank other people for a beating unless they had severe masochistic tendencies, and Sherlock had not read John as that sort of boy.
“John,” said a voice so familiar, and there was his name in that voice so familiar, that it seemed to have come only from his subconscious. “You’re just in time for tea.”
When Sherlock shifts his hands to John's hips to yank him down into the thrusts, John only rolls hips with a needy whimper. Like he's made for this. Just that thought makes Sherlock thrust harder, himself panting open-mouthed, beyond words for the moment. All for the best. Who knows what obscenities or atrocities or endearments could tumble out.
And what Sherlock said made so much sense. A year ago their doggy had died, and everybody cried and was sad for a while. But then a few months later they’d gotten a new puppy, a bouncy and soft thing that John had named Gladstone, and now they rarely talked about their old doggy anymore.
John was so small like this, bound together, beautifully compact. He was trussed up in black satin rope like a present, like an offering to a sordid god of hedonism and sex. His arms were bound to his sides, his wrists bound to one another, rendering him helpless. The ropes crisscrossed in an X over his chest, rendering him on display.  The symmetry of it was elegant. The feel of him was tight, searing with heat, split open on Sherlock's cock. It was almost as if Sherlock could contain John this way, tangle him up in knots and keep him.
“Sorry,” said Sherlock, who wasn’t at all. He coughed loudly through his fingers in Carl’s general direction.
He pushed it in further, shuddered at the very light scrape of John’s teeth, watched John’s eyes wide and staring at him. He didn’t stop until the head of his dick bumped, gently, against the back of John’s throat. John swallowed around him, fighting the urge to gag, and Sherlock let out out a groan - low, deep sound of desire.
“Thank you, Bill,” said John. “I am deeply touched that you would tell a great many lies on my behalf. That’s almost Slytherin of you.”
John, after a moment, noticed himself being watched. He turned slightly towards Sherlock and the artificial lights of nighttime London lit half his face, the other half in shadow. His hand brushed against Sherlock’s as he turned.
When they separated, it was Sherlock who pulled away, and John followed him, instinctively, as steel drawn to a magnet. John with his hand on Sherlock’s chest, his own heart in his throat, until Sherlock’s cool fingers were wrapping around his hand, to gently peel him away.
“It’s a token,” Sherlock said, and used both hands to curl John’s fingers for him, so that his  small hand closed into a fist around it. “The stone has been taken by the sea, and the waves toss it and churn it for a hundred years, and in the end it becomes all polished, beautiful and smooth.”
Sherlock teaches John how to kiss in the backseat of his 1952 souped up hot rod, white leather interior and royal purple exterior. They park at the passion pit and Sherlock shows him how their mouths fit together, teases out the soft slickness of John’s tongue, while Scarlett O’Hara, resplendent in her dress, runs around a razed plantation projected silver in the background.
“We’ll spread the dittany over the dressing, like so. And then apply the dressing directly to the wound, and hold it, applying pressure, until the wound closes. If it bleeds through, do not remove the dressing, but instead put another dressing on top of it. Do you understand?”
John squirmed around till he could get his feet down on the floor. “If you don’t put that camera down, I will knock you down and forcibly take it from you. ”
He finished the job that John had started, stripping off his open shirt and dropping it to the floor. He kicked off his shoes, took off his socks, and his hands went to his own trousers. John watched him with open hunger, an expression that still caught Sherlock by surprise the way things so rarely did. There had been a time when that sort of look seemed as much of an impossibility as the existence of monstrous demonic hounds. That was all in the past; the impossible had been eliminated.
say? Bikes did not exactly come cheap, and he’d probably have to combine both Christmas and birthday presents to even dare ask for a new one, and he’d get a tanning this time for
“It’s Arawn Ilex,” John corrected. “I remember because Ilex sounds like some sort of cream my gran uses.”
The potion made John’s eyes feel very tired, and he leaned back against the pillows to close them for a bit. Sherlock was describing how one could accurately distinguish between Tangerine, Toffee, and Earwax beans, and John thought that this was a very important lesson to learn and keep with him for the rest of his life. It had to do something with the variation in speckle patterns, he told himself - the last coherent thought he had before he was slowly embraced by the healing arms of sleep.
Sherlock slid his hands up John’s neck by way of answer, tilting the man’s head up to the ceiling, baring his throat. Much more room to suck and kiss John to distraction. John stopped protesting the moment Sherlock’s mouth latched onto his jugular, leaving a trail of wet, shining marks down his throat.
“I missed…” John mumbled. Curled up against Sherlock’s side, with his head leaning over and resting on Sherlock’s shoulder, he had fallen fast asleep.
John moaned weakly, precum spurting out clear from the head of his dick. The sound of his moan was muffled by the black ball gag stopping up his mouth. It was just big enough to stretch his mouth sweetly open. Sherlock liked the sight of John’s mouth with something in it. He liked to have either of John’s holes plugged, either with his cock or with a toy. If it were up to him, that would always be the case, but as cases went, that would be very impractical.
He makes a mess of it. Heat licking beneath his skin and he's waited too long to be careful, slathering his dick with the greasy jelly and smearing it over the crack of John's round little ass, spreading it over his hole. One hand on John's hip to hold him in place, the other hand guiding his dick. "This is going to be a bit more difficult," he warns. "But you can take it. For me. Deep breath now."
“Shh,” Sherlock shushed against his skin, and dropped a sweet kiss to the hollow of his throat. He looped the collar around John’s neck and slid the strap in place, tugging until it was snug before fastening it with the buckle.
“You can’t be Sherlock,” he accused, shaking his head. “You can’t. He’s…” he stumbled over the word, heavy and clogging in his throat.
He dared not give it voice. It was a terrible thing he wanted, but what frightened him was how little he cared that it was sinful and bad.
“Okay,” said John. “And then Mummy’ll know you let me play in the cave because you were watching me, right?”
John looked the Head Boy up and down, considering his perfectly coiffed hair and the way the light outlined him in stark contrast, half-shadowing his face. “Well, it’s a good thing you’re above all that,” John said.
Sherlock pounded John into the bed, mattress creaking beneath them, bedframe rattling and chains shaking and bedside table shaking a bit too. He fucked him hard, like an animal rutting in heat, without thought, operating only on raw instinct, hormones and need. His orgasm was building up inside of him, curling up in the pit of his stomach, tugging at his balls, and it made him want more, like it was never enough, like he could never do this enough, never touch enough, never fuck John enough.
She kissed like she danced, leading him. As if she were saving him the trouble. Other girls expected John to be gentle with them, but Jeanette was not gentle with him. She crawled over him easily in the back of his momma’s car, she put her hands wherever she wanted them without asking if it was all right. It was more than all right. He was amazed at her daring; he found her amazing.
“You do what you want,” said Harry, chewing loudly. “You do the right thing and it’ll all be all right. But you really need to get that creepy little Slytherin friend of yours to teach you how not to get caught.”
Three fingers inside of him, spreading, and stretching, and rubbing, and Sherlock loves and hates the pained sounds that John can make. He wants to make them stop, never wants them to stop. Bending down he takes the head of John's dick into his mouth and begins to suck in earnest, rubbing the flat of his tongue against it. He rubs three fingers against John's prostate, rubs and rubs and presses against it, until the little hitches of breath, the whimpers and sobbing sounds metamorphose into something beyond pain and beyond pleasure, something that is rather a mating of the two.
Need tightened, hot and insistent, deep in Sherlock’s gut. He kissed him again, tongue sliding into the heat of his mouth, hand tightening on John’s dick. John arched against him, pleasured, needy, and Sherlock needed to feel him, skin to skin. He had thought about John’s skin in Barcelona, in Milan, in Amsterdam. Thoughts had warmed him in the bitter winter in St. Petersburg. Thoughts had been all he’d had then, fabricated memories and no real data for his hypotheses on the texture of skin, the warmth and tone of it, the slide of it underneath questing fingers.
He placed a hand on John’s shoulder - warm and solid and real - the cup of tea held out in his hand. When had he gotten so close? John felt himself stop for a moment, breath caught; caught off-guard by the familiar features and by the almost-hungry look in Sherlock’s eyes. He felt completely caught by the look in Sherlock’s eyes.
John had been fine, all the way to King’s Cross Station. He was fine when he got there, minus one moment of customary panic as he ran full speed into what was clearly a solid brick wall  - he was going to die, he was going to die, oh god - with a great thrill of exhilaration when he appeared on the other side, triumphant at having cheated death yet another day. He was fine up until the Express pulled into the station, bigger than he’d ever imagined, big like he thought of grand elephants and airplanes and gods were big, and he forgot how to speak. He had to be reminded to hug mum and hug dad, and then he was bustled onto the train with his new owl (
He told John about fish, all the different, wonderful kinds of fish, their colours and shapes and sizes, and the way they moved through water. How you could get lost in a school of them and all around you would be thousands of flashes of moving silver. His fingers traced careful patterns on John’s collarbones, and he told John how they could have tea in the skeleton of a whale. They could chase each other and play hide and seek, darting in and out of the massive white columns of its ribcage. He told John about how he swam with dolphins, leaping as they leapt, swimming underneath them, and how a dolphin would let you hold onto its fin for a breathtaking ride.
“Yes, John, just like that,” he whispered, stroking his hair. It took a little of the tension out of his face, and the haze got just that much deeper. “Feel everything I do to you. Surrender to it.”
Sherlock could fix this. The camera was around here somewhere...ah. He paused in the kitchen doorway to adjust the f-stop and exposure, and then lifted it to focus on John. “John. Smile.”
“No,” John decided, easily. The less information people had about Sherlock the better, considering that he’d seen firsthand already the damage that had been done when people knew nothing at all.
It was Friday afternoon and there was a crowd gathered near the Library, which was John’s first clue that something was drastically out of sorts.
Sherlock’s pale eyes were completely focused on him. They looked blue, and then they shifted green, here in the shadows of the forest.
“It’s called discretion. Get with it,” Sherlock said, and then he steepled his hands together underneath his chin and closed his eyes, which meant the conversation was over.
It was over in a moment. Sherlock pulled back, and nodded, as if satisfied with his work. John licked his wet lips and they tasted salty and coppery, of seawater and blood.
In London, Sherlock says, the fogs are thick, and dark, and oh, so very quiet.  It is strange, like a muffled blanket dropped on the whole city, letting London keep its secrets in silence.  They say anything can happen in London, in the fog.
But then John’s friends were calling him back over, were making jokes and faces and they were laughing and before Sherlock could say anything, really, John had very quickly walked away.
John’s breath caught in his throat. His nerves were vibrating. He had stripped for Sherlock before, of course, but always in the privacy of his bedroom, never out in the open like this. It didn’t matter that it was near midnight, the house was dark and quiet, and they were in the relative safety of Sherlock’s garage.  This was a wide open space; the light from the garage spilling out into the indiscernible night. The night was all around him, and anything could have been out there; even the glittering stars seemed like twinkling eyes.
There had been one whole person, so far, whose company he thought that he could reasonably tolerate. Sherlock had never had a living, human friend before (Mummy and Mycroft didn’t count) and he was curious to see what it might be like. John had seemed like a good candidate - he might not have been very intelligent, but he was more so than most, and he hadn’t been afraid of Sherlock. He had also very much wanted to be friends, which had surprised Sherlock in its novelty. Mummy had always said that he was a precocious child, who simply needed more mature company and perhaps did not function well in social situations. The horrified parents of his hapless playmates had deemed him a “holy terror,” as well as other words that Sherlock was absolutely forbidden to repeat, in both polite company and impolite ones.
John bit his lip. He had said too much, he hadn’t meant to, but no one ever talked about those days. Momma didn’t like it.
Months of cases and takeaway dinners followed, Sherlock quietly basking in their slowly growing closeness, the decreasing distance between two men in a darkened cab. There were the quiet nights at home in front of the fire because Sherlock had blown out the windows with a “contained” experiment that left them still picking bits of shattered glass out of the carpet months later. There was companionable telly, bonding over awful late-night talk shows with paternity testing and Man or Woman? guessing and is-he-cheating-on-me-with-his-sister's-fiance with John lying sidewise on the sofa crippled with laughter while Sherlock shouted at an unhearing studio audience.
“Don’t,” John said, and he licked his lips. Sherlock watched his wet red tongue running over his reddened mouth.
Freudian theory states that dreams of falling indicate that a person is contemplating giving in to sexual urge or impulse, but Freud has always been ridiculous and full of shit anyway.
“This is Sherlock,” John says quickly. “He’s my study partner. We’re...working on a project together.”
“What’s his name?” Sherlock asked, glancing back at the soft puppy. He pet it absentmindedly, as if it were a real puppy.
"What they are saying,” said Bill, “Is that you have Liz-Bean dwarf and house elf parents but you're still basically Muggleborn and you don't have enough money and also that's why you have a voice like a girl."
His fingers soothing through John’s hair, all manner of petting. These slow, gentle touches that made John want to melt into them in spite of himself.
In John’s room, with the windows half open, the afternoon breeze wafts in. It gently lifts the curtains, so that it is as if they are performing imitations of ghosts. Sherlock has John down on the bed, laid out on fresh sheets that have dried on the line, summer smells of grass and sun.
“Mm hmm,” John nodded, because he knew that this was how magic things worked. “But how will I see you again?”
Their panting breaths are loud enough to drown out the voice of the telly in the otherwise quiet flat. Tentatively, slowly, John lets his arms wrap around Victor’s back, his body still trembling. Victor slides one arm underneath him; gingerly, they hold one another.
“Oh,” John said, “Oh no.” His eyes stung with the prickle of fresh tears at the thought of being replaced and forgotten.
“Oh, John, I want to believe you,” Bill said, quite tragically. “But that also might just be your head injury talking.”
“Sherlock!” John gasped with false shock, and made a comical attempt to cover himself. It was reminiscent of the flustered way he would have looked, once, a very long time ago, when Sherlock had walked in on him in inopportune moments. Back then that might have led to an argument about privacy, and the blatant disregard for it. Back then, when John had still kept things hidden from Sherlock.
