The murder was brutal: a human so badly mauled that not even their gender could be determined by sight, much less their identity. Not for certain, anyway, although the chances it was the inhabitant of the flat it had been discovered in were probably quite high.
Sherlock obliges. “Moved them down here with mine. It hardly seemed practical, you continuing to climb the stairs every morning to get dressed and every night to get undressed if you’re to continue sleeping down here.”
‘Maybe he is a consultant for the Met,’ John thought, although the article said nothing about any consultant.
Sherlock throws the door open and strides out. The lights in the kitchen are on as well as in the living room, so as he approaches the sofa he gets a clear view of John’s haggard appearance, the weary irritation in his expression as he strives to keep hold of both Rosie’s wailing, writhing form and a presumably fresh bottle.
John fully intended to try licking next, maybe a nice slow swipe up the vein to Sherlock’s elbow, but Sherlock seemed to gather her control again and spoke.
, John thought, which sparked another brief round of giggling. God, he felt good. He stretched languidly, still chuckling, and shimmied his hips until Sherlock’s prick could nudge his cheeks apart and nestle between them.
Giving in to temptation, Sherlock half turned her head, eyeing John in her peripheral vision. She was tipping the kettle of boiling water into her RAMC mug, not seeming to care about Sherlock at all. Sucking in one final deep breath of John’s sex-soaked scent, Sherlock returned to her microscope.
Inside was a bundled-up quilt and—John groped at it curiously—swaddled inside that was a gun. John’s gun.
The promise in his tone and expression—which brought to mind their heated snog in the hallway at Sherlock’s flat—effectively wiped all thoughts of the encounter with Mycroft Holmes from John’s head.
“Do you want to stay here for a bit?” Sherlock murmured. “The travel cot is still upstairs. The bed too, of course. You’re always welcome, John. Whenever you need.”
Sherlock jumped at the sound, confused, and didn’t realise until John went tense and began to rub soothingly at his bum what had happened: Sherlock had been spanked.
So when John was fully seated, breathing heavily through his nose and gripping Sherlock’s hips like a vice to keep them still, Sherlock felt impaled and helpless: stuffed full and fit to burst. With every breath, Sherlock swore he could feel the stretch of John’s prick all the way in his throat.
Suddenly, Sherlock was shoved away. A thick string of spit stretched between his lips and John’s cock, which was so pretty and red now, so thick and needy. Sherlock pouted and began to whine before he realised that John was stroking himself, the saliva helping his fist glide smoothly and quickly up and down his length. Jerking himself off, finishing himself.
This wasn’t going the way John had expected at all. He hardly even felt like shouting any longer. He just felt…
By the first tour around the sitting room, being led by the hair at the top of his head like a poorly treated pet, Sherlock is gagging for it. He crawls slowly, his swollen prick bobbing uncomfortably with each motion, and imagines himself humping John’s leg, begging for John’s hand, bending over and baring his hole for John’s tongue.
“Oh, please. You’re a shameless creature of habit. You don’t suggest new restaurants without a reason. Not to mention you were raised to think of dinners out as special occasions. Therefore, you brought us here for a reason, to say or… or ask something.” The words stuck inexplicably in his throat, although he tried to pretend they hadn’t. “So: say, or ask.”
She might’ve left it at home, John thought, or she might’ve lost it. But somehow he knew that neither was the answer Sherlock wanted. Those were ordinary reasons, uninteresting ones. John tried to think more interestingly.
She bit and relished John’s injured moan, how her whole body seized like she meant to fight before going slowly limp: not only giving herself over to Sherlock, but overcoming her own nature to do it.
Curious, he clicked 071411120418’s username and was surprised to find that the profile wasn’t empty. There was even a photo: a rather suggestive shot of a person’s plain white shirt unbuttoned just enough to reveal a long, pale throat and the tip of a very prominent collarbone. Tantalising, seductive, in an effortless sort of way—it made John’s mouth go dry and his tongue stick uncomfortably to the roof of his mouth.
Would Sherlock mind? Hard to say for certain. Some days, for instance, Sherlock thought it perfectly acceptable to barge in and out of the loo while John was using it, and other days, John accidentally leaving the door cracked just a hair while he had a piss put Sherlock in a snit for hours.
He sat on the steps outside, as much in the shade as he could be, and waited for the impending bloodlust to pass. He’d known it would be bad, of course; during his residency, then again in Afghanistan, he’d seen a vampire in the throes of it.
The BlackBerry was silent for the rest of the night. By the fifth time that John checked it, to be sure Sherlock hadn’t texted and the phone had just forgotten to chime, he had to admit that he was maybe the slightest bit disappointed.
I can’t help but wonder if you’d hold your desire, your lust, in your shoulders as well. Obviously they would rise and fall as you gasped and your breathing grew heavier. Maybe they’d do a graceful dance beneath your skin when you got grabby. Do you get grabby? I imagine you get grabby. That you always have to have a hand on me no matter our positions. On my jaw when I’m in front of you, my shoulders when I’m on top of you, my waist when I’m beneath you, my hair when I’m knelt at your feet. It’s good to hold onto, good for gripping and wrenching. Stroking as well as toying idly with, just as I imagine yours is. There’s nothing I want more than to cradle your head against my chest and lower my chin and breathe in the scent of your hair.
The Warfare series is a disgrace to the entire video game industry. I’m not surprised you disliked it.
Tonight, John keeps his scratches perfectly straight, following the line of Sherlock’s spine until he reaches Sherlock’s nape. Sherlock gasps at the sting, which is surprisingly sharp, and huddles closer, while John strokes his hair and murmurs, “There you go, sweetheart. How’s that? Good? All mine, aren’t you, love?”
John’s weak and quivering limbs give, and he collapses to his stomach. Sherlock follows, still lapping insistently at John’s sloppy, sensitive hole.
Sherlock opened his eyes just long enough to get a glimpse of him, his slackened jaw and half-lidded eyes, the tension leaving his shoulders like air from a tyre—before John aimed higher, the piss splashing on Sherlock’s jaw and then his cheekbones, his temple. All the way to the top of his head, and Sherlock squeezed his eyes closed once more as little rivers of warm urine drizzled over his forehead, his eyelids, his mouth. He licked his lips, curious: it was surprisingly bland, with a very faint salty aftertaste.
Which was rubbish, obviously. The only person capable of hacking Sherlock’s phone was Mycroft, and he was as interested in Sherlock’s naughty photos as he was in the status of Sherlock’s sock index—which was to say, not at all.
Although it made Sherlock’s back groan and her forearms scream, she hunched further and stretched her arms longer, so that she could drive her fingers deeper and stroke John’s G-spot.
It was almost reason enough, John thought with a glint of grim satisfaction, to go along with Sherlock’s fantasy. Almost.
John glanced around and spotted Sherlock’s mobile phone on the desk just as Sherlock recalled the last thing he’d used it for.
Sherlock scarcely seemed to breathe, going as still as a statue. John was too tired to be pleased with himself for shocking him.
Sherlock grimaces, his eyes snapping closed as he attempts to will away the interruption. “Go away, Mycroft. You’re not welcome here.”
Then Sherlock bent and kissed him—not a chaste peck, but a proper open-mouth snog—and John stopped thinking at all.
drag Sherlock down by his nape and crush their mouths together, regardless of the overwhelming reek of tobacco. Sherlock moaned and melted, draping himself around John’s shoulders, and almost instantly the kiss turned bitey. Every time John tried to soften it, Sherlock nipped and dragged his teeth over John’s bottom lip, the stubborn and infuriating cock.
Conclusion: Sherlock need only persist in what he has been doing to overcome this. His transport will learn, eventually.
Sherlock scrambled into a seated position, throwing a look towards the window. Judging by the angle and degree of the sunlight—
“He travels a lot, yes,” Sherlock said, before John could say a word. He sounded excited, almost giddy. John could easily picture him fidgeting, squirming in one of the armchairs in his flat and bouncing his knee, grinning so widely that the corner of his eyes crinkled. “Both within the country and worldwide. For, hm…
The wind was joined by the faint sound of voices in the background, which cut off abruptly when Sherlock shouted, “Shut
It would be… good. It would replace their first kiss (which had slid into their second and third and twentieth, Sherlock half on top of John on the sofa while John panted into Sherlock’s mouth and trembled and let Sherlock map the shape of his shoulders beneath his jumper) as Sherlock’s most treasured memory, the one he fetched and clung to when his cravings threatened to best his self-control.
It hurt, the pulse of sensation that went through Sherlock’s genitals then. She considered doing nothing, just lying still and letting it smoulder. But not now, not when John was asking for it.
Staring, enraptured, John clawed helplessly at the cushion and came. The first pulse hit the back of Sherlock’s throat, but the second and third shot obediently onto Sherlock’s waiting tongue. A shudder rolled through Sherlock’s shoulders, and then he closed his lips and sucked John gently through the rest.
John nearly pitched face-first into the headboard, but managed at the last second to steady himself. “Shit! Sherlock, that’s—oh, fuck!”
But John found it rather difficult to go slowly while he was staring down into Sherlock’s face, which was twisted in squinty-eyed and open-mouthed ecstasy that deepened considerably once John had eased past the flared crown. John wanted to overwhelm him. John wanted to blow his fucking mind.
He wraps his legs around John’s waist and tugs him down so he can cling to John’s shoulders, muffle his cries in John’s neck. The penetration is shallower this way, the angle more awkward and possibly (Sherlock realises a moment too late) less satisfying for John, but John allows it, holds Sherlock close even though it means he can’t thrust properly, that he can only hump at Sherlock’s arse like a dog.
‘Oh god,’ John thought again, and wanted to bury his head in his hands. ‘Look what you’ve done. You’ve got him staying up all night thinking of how not to offend you.’ This was ridiculous. John couldn’t even begin to wrap his mind around that level of desire, and for John of all people.
Sherlock set his cup on the coffee table so haphazardly that tea splashed over the top. “Thank you, Mrs Hudson. So nice chatting with you, sorry you have to leave so soon, but believe me when I say you don’t want to be here for the next bit.”
, Sherlock supposes. Precisely the sort of thing that might make John rethink their relationship. So he shoves the idea hastily aside.
At half four, half awake and starving, John stumbled down to the kitchen, made himself a cup of tea, and spent the next hour in the loo regretting it with every fibre of his being.
“I was having trouble hearing you. Your voice is deep enough that it booms a bit, like I’ve said before, and the booming in the background music was drowning it out.”
The fire licking at Sherlock’s veins, the desperation gnawing at his bones, the question spinning round and round his mind as John sucked so sweetly at his cock that Sherlock’s calves tensed and cramped:
John’s mouth went dry, and he had to reach behind and shove his fingers back into his arse. Just a bit, just to keep himself loose. He couldn’t watch Sherlock sucking a toy without touching himself at least a little, and he didn’t trust himself to start stroking his dick.
Sherlock whined again, but sat back obediently, his hands on his knees and his gaze on John, who smiled.
For a moment, Sherlock is devastated, but then he is thankful for the intervention. He squirms until Mycroft relents just enough that Sherlock can twist his arms and grasp Mycroft’s hands in his own, holding on for dear life while John fucks him unwaveringly, sweetly, staring into Sherlock’s face like Sherlock is the only thing in the world that matters.
‘Well done,’ he thought, gritting his teeth. ‘She’s been eager to meet you again, and you just made a brilliant impression.’
Sherlock kissed him, rising half off the sofa to do it, and this time John opened for him immediately. Sherlock tasted his breath, his saliva, and licked clumsily at John’s teeth and tongue. As he was exploring, John drew him closer, groaning. Sherlock’s head spun at the noise, and spun even faster when John grasped greedily at his shirt, tugging until the buttons strained.
She’d just finished breakfast. The scent of eggs on toast and Irish breakfast tea with sugar was still strong in the kitchen, and her stomach was gurgling loudly enough that it drowned out the sounds of her heart valves and the air whistling through her nose hairs.
“You’ve still got quite a bit of colour at least,” Mrs Hudson said when John hauled the contents of his and Sherlock’s kitchen cupboards down to her flat.
Oh, yes. The friction of the fabric against her sensitive nipples. It probably felt heavenly. Sherlock wanted to moan, but tried to rein in the urge. When she spoke, she was relieved to hear only a thin thread of desire in her voice, not the flood that she was feeling. “I bet your dates love that, don’t they? They don’t even need—”
Then Sherlock’s paws are gone, and the massive weight is lifted from his back, although Sherlock’s cock stays firmly rooted in him. Not climbing off, then, but giving John the opportunity to sit up and take himself in hand.
At first Sherlock tried to steer them towards a restaurant, insisting “We need to eat,” words that John was fairly certain he’d never uttered before in his life.
Sherlock came back to himself. John was leaning over him, bent forward at the waist with his hands on his knees.
“Yes, wonderful,” he snaps, growing more bad-tempered now that he realises he hasn’t a clue what Mycroft really wants. “However, if you could get to the point, assuming that you do have one, it would be much appreciated.”
John had barely finished speaking before Sherlock was wrapping his arms around John’s waist and hauling him even higher until John was practically straddling his face.
“Oh yeah,” said Jennifer. “A tall, pale bloke. Had a really nice coat, but he was a right bastard. He had a weird name, I can’t remember it.”
Oh. That’s a profoundly tantalising image: John reduced to violent, primal possessiveness over Sherlock. Blood and bits of flesh on his teeth and lips. Pinning Sherlock down and fucking him while some idiot somewhere screams in agony and bleeds to death for touching what is John’s.
Not the BlackBerry, but Harry’s old phone, which was still on the desk where John had left it this morning. Funny that he’d just been thinking about how little he used it anymore, and now Harry had texted him and someone—probably also Harry—was phoning him all in the same day.
Sherlock spent an indeterminate amount of time weighing the benefits and drawbacks of setting his skin samples on fire one by one and filling the flat with smoke, not to mention the smell of burnt flesh, which would surely linger for at least
, and as you can see, the media hasn’t caught wind of this yet, though I’m sure it’s only a matter of time. Actually, I’d be interested to hear how
“Yes, exactly,” Molly snaps, her face gone pink and her lips tight. “I’ve had loads of experience with relationships going tits-up, so maybe you should stop being an insufferable arsehole and
Sherlock couldn’t say no to her. Not like this, not to that smile. “Ugh. Fine.” Rolling her eyes to the ceiling, Sherlock hefted off the back of the armchair and plopped down into the seat. The cushion bounced and groaned. “As I said, it’s complicated. But the gist of it is that I don’t, as a general rule, ‘get off’ during sex.”
“Yeah, I know,” John sighed. “Cheers. Just let me be disappointed in the world for a bit, and then I’ll move on.”
John would spoil him shamelessly. Almost certainly he would insist on rubbing salve on Sherlock’s bottom, during which Sherlock could easily entice John into spreading his arse cheeks wide and eating his hole until it was so wet and loose that John’s tongue could slip inside. Hours upon hours of rimming, until John’s jaw was sore and Sherlock was sobbing and shaking and humping the bed like the good boy that John would tell him he was.
wet,” John said. She couldn’t help but slide one finger into herself. Just the tip, barely past the first knuckle, but enough that she could feel how hot and slick she was inside, how easily she would open around, well, anything really. A cock, a toy, a set of long, long fingers. “Give me a bit, and it’ll be all the way to my thighs. You’ve caught me on a good day, apparently.”
Sherlock lowered his paw and batted at one of the baubles, sending it spinning towards John, who promptly hunkered down, wiggled his bum, and pounced.
Soon, Sherlock had shoved at John so much that John was skidding forwards on the sheets, and Sherlock had to haul herself higher to follow, to keep John’s bum nestled so perfectly against her. As she did, she unclenched her jaw—and was vaguely aware of John exhaling shakily when her shoulder was free—and mouthed blindly at the surrounding skin, finding another dry smooth patch to circle with her teeth and bite.
“Because I like you. And you’re probably the most interesting person I’ve ever met. And you act like you’re above it all and untouchable, even unhuman, but I’ve started to wonder if maybe you’re actually more human than the rest of us.”
Lestrade doesn’t text with a case. Sherlock’s inbox is scarcely better: nothing capable of holding his attention for longer than ten seconds, certainly nothing like a proper distraction from the mess with John. Even Mycroft leaves him well enough alone.
By the time that Sherlock has had enough—by John’s standards, that is, Sherlock is fairly certain he could withstand a lot more—the whole surface of his neck aches, and his mind churns like a failing machine, his thoughts coming in fragmented bursts.
Name, he needs a name. Not Tom: that was the last fiancé. Not Jeremy: that was one of the boyfriends after Tom. Sherlock pictures their flat last Christmas. John standing beside him in a horrible Christmas jumper—blue and red and white, with a pattern of repeating reindeer and snowflakes, the one that inspired numerous fantasies in which Sherlock ripped it from John’s body and then fucked him atop the tattered ruins of it. John, practically effusive in comparison to Sherlock’s polite but disinterested welcome, offering his hand to Molly’s fiancé and repeating his name. John’s voice, warmed by a glass and a half of wine:
“Off.” He was still arching, his legs bouncing under John’s bum as though he couldn’t sit still. “I want this off. Please.”
“Sherlock!” Mrs Hudson cried, dropping her bags, which made enough of a racket that Sherlock leapt up and skittered away.
Then, to drive the point home, he shimmied his hips from side to side, making his tail wag and drawing John’s gaze to it. Reminding him that Sherlock was still plugged and had been this whole time, that it was only a small leap to removing the tail and replacing it with his cock.
After a second or two of silence, Mrs Hudson says, “After I saw the two of you dancing, I thought there mightn’t
“You didn’t,” he begins, then has to pause, when the breath he’s just taken seems suddenly to abandon him. His lungs burn; his entire chest cavity feels tight. He inhales again, then tries to push past.
“Yes!” Sherlock nearly shouted it, reaching hastily for his zip. “Yes, that… yes.” His hands, shaking, fumbled slightly but finally managed to undo his trousers and, with John’s help, shove them down to his thighs, followed by his pants.
Then John rolled her shoulders and shook her head. Strands of her hair whipped Sherlock lightly in the face and clung to her still-wet lips and chin. “No, sorry. Didn’t really mean that. It just sort of, erm, popped out.”
Apparently John hadn’t looked as “exceedingly handsome” at dinner as Sherlock had said, John thought wryly as he typed his response.
, as she’d found it amongst the other plain pet jumpers, but as it reminded Mrs Hudson of a pair of Army fatigues, she supposed it would do in a pinch.
It’s easy enough to whittle down the tedious and insipid ones by subject line alone—anything with the words “love” or “fan,” usually indicating fan mail; anything that ends in an exclamation mark or an ellipsis, usually indicating general stupidity; and so on.
Resting his cheek between John’s scapulae, Sherlock considers. “As a veteran and a doctor, you’d be most comfortable handling—”
“Yes,” said Sherlock, her chest heaving as she gasped. Her cheeks were flushed, strands of her fringe stuck to her temples with beads of sweat. Her eyes blinked open, although they still looked unfocused, or at least significantly less sharp than usual.
Yes, she thought, she was certainly terrified. Terrified and awkward and out of her depth and very glad she’d elected to come upstairs fully dressed. The last thing John needed—lovely, perfect John—was to witness Sherlock’s small pointy breasts, thin and bony hips, and frankly frightful pubic hair, which was just as overlong, curly, and unkempt as the hair on Sherlock’s head.
sex. And not only that, but the sort of sex that meant John was hers and wouldn’t bring another string of dull, undeserving men into the flat while Sherlock sat on the sofa and watched and seethed.
“I’m nearly finished,” Sherlock said. “I only need to clean up here. Oh, and I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
John rose to his knees so he could cradle Sherlock’s head against his chest, raking the fingers of one hand through Sherlock’s sweaty curls while the other closed around Sherlock’s erection and stroked. Immediately, the hard length jerked in his grip, and Sherlock let out a pitiful wail.
“Or,” John said, with the sort of emphasis he used when he thought (usually erroneously) Sherlock was being thick, “we could kip out here on the floor. In front of the fire.”
But when Mrs Hudson scooped up the hat and tried to set it on Sherlock’s little head, he grew rather less keen.
“Okay,” said John. “In that case, I think it’s bollocks. The human body is mostly water, and, really, aside from fat tissue and methane gas, there’s nothing that would burn readily. So the likelihood of a person catching fire without any sort of external heat source is... small. Very small.. So there. That’s my ‘medical opinion.’ Satisfied?”
Sherlock grinned widely back at her, then lowered her head so her cheek was pillowed again on John’s arm. “I told you the chair was big enough,” she said.
Sherlock cocked her head and took one of John’s inner labia into her mouth, suckling gently, and the concern died in John’s throat. Again, like the nuzzling, the appeal came more from the idea than how it felt. (Cunnilingus had always appealed more to her mentally than physically.) God, she wanted to make a fucking mess of Sherlock. Pull her hair and ride her tongue and get her entire face sopping wet—which obviously went against her intentions to be gentle while Sherlock was tied down.
John didn’t know what he would prefer. He didn’t know what had just happened or how he’d got himself into this mess in the first place.
John had barely unpacked at all. His clothes were still folded neatly in the blue rolling suitcase. His computer was still in its travel bag. His shampoo, his shaving kit, his comb, and his toothbrush, despite having been used less than an hour ago, were packed away in a duffel bag that sat on the floor beside the bed.
Vampires drinking vampire blood—for sustenance or for… other things—wasn’t unheard of, John knew, but surely Sherlock wasn’t contemplating it when he had an open blood bag in his hands and a full cooler of more at his feet. Of course, the only other option that occurred to John was equally unlikely. And really, really not a good idea to dwell on.
Then Sherlock recalls the flow of the conversation and stops, startled. The art of small talk involves reciprocation and finding commonalities, which means that Molly asking after John immediately after Sherlock has asked after her fiancé is significant.
“No blood,” John declares much later, after he’s led Sherlock into the bathroom so he can examine the scratches in better light. “Didn’t think so, but I wanted to make sure.”
She traced her thumb along the veins on the top of Sherlock’s foot (a calming sensation that made some of the tension seep from Sherlock’s body), cupped Sherlock’s heel (which made Sherlock feel inexplicably treasured), and dipped her fingertips between Sherlock’s toes (ticklish, which made Sherlock kick again and sparked another giggling fit).
He felt hopelessly stupid, especially with John staring at him like he was, as though he expected Sherlock to say something more. Offer an explanation, perhaps—which Sherlock certainly wasn’t keen on giving.
John pressed a sloppy kiss to Sherlock’s back and then buried his face between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, alternating grunts and groans as he filled Sherlock’s hole with come.
So he kept at it, standing in Sherlock’s shower with one hand on the wall and the other behind him, probing his arsehole, getting it nice and clean and open so he could sit on Sherlock’s cock and fuck it until they were both desperate and wailing.
And here I am texting you and avoiding going back to Harry’s because I’m fairly certain we’ll just get into a row if I see her.
“Mummy?” John asked, mystified. He shoved the quilt back into the bag, ensuring the pistol was fully hidden.
He takes a breath, steeling himself, and says, “Absolutely. In fact, you should move in immediately.”
“Well then,” said Mrs Hudson. As she walked past, she bent to pat Sherlock’s head and, well-accustomed to Sherlock’s behaviour now, yanked her hand away just in time to miss a playful (and painful) swat. “We’ll just have to get John something else, won’t we?”
Is this why Lestrade was so nonchalant about the bite marks on his neck? Has he too spent the last twelve or more months believing Sherlock and John to be in a relationship—so convinced that they have long been romantically involved that he is unmoved by physical, incontrovertible proof of it?
Sherlock’s chin jerked towards him, although he seemed loath to tear his attention from the computer screen. “Buying an under-the-bed bondage system. Maybe a cock ring as well, since my control is… abysmal, apparently.” He grimaced, and John fancied he saw a very faint blush blossom on his cheeks. “You can keep me tied down and use my cock whenever you need it. Or my arse. Assuming you’re still interested in that.”
Then John lets go and steps back, his eyes still narrowed in suspicion—he’s clearly intent on making Sherlock pee in a jar no matter what his own senses tell him—and Sherlock is so disappointed he nearly gives in to the urge to whine in protest and try to follow.
Grunting, he shoved open the door with his shoulder and found Sherlock not in the leather armchair where he’d been earlier, but sitting at the desk on the computer, his hands folded beneath his chin. He glanced up when John entered, blinking as though waking from a daze.
Sherlock came, taking tiny steps and biting his bottom lip, and god, if he gave John half a chance, John was going to make a fucking wreck of him. If Sherlock would allow it. If it didn’t somehow go against the ‘Daddy’ thing he seemed to enjoy so much.
“It’s fine.” Sherlock can hear the thread of disappointment in his voice, and hopes dearly that John is too tired to pick up on it.
“Hey,” John says, shimmying closer and nuzzling Sherlock’s shoulder, kissing just above the bone. “Are you okay?”
But no, he soon realised that wasn’t what Sherlock had meant at all. Sherlock wanted to photograph John’s foot.
a bit wide, after all, and her arse a bit flat, and she had cellulite there and on her thighs that only got worse the older she—
when John’s shoulders relax, his fists unknot, and he climbs back into bed. On Sherlock’s side, this time. Or at least what, five minutes ago, had been Sherlock’s side.
Sherlock pulled off. A thin line of spittle stretched from his lips and fell to his chin. John’s knees went wobbly and arousal bubbled like magma beneath his skin at the sight. God, he wanted to
I apologise for ending the game so abruptly last night. Are you interested in playing more Diggy Hole multiplayer in the future?
“Are you seriously going to argue the realism of a game where purple gorillas the size of tanks throw rocks at you and bite the heads off robots?”
Sherlock nodded. “It—” He couldn’t even begin to explain the appeal. Of being left wanting, being consumed with thoughts of John, or of John’s thoughts never straying far from Sherlock. The words wouldn’t come.
His own orgasm forgotten, Sherlock abandons the pillow and rolls over to find John on his back with his jeans open and shoved to his thighs, his pants pushed down, and his prick exposed. It’s red and thick, uncircumcised, with exceedingly prominent veins. Sherlock finds it strangely aesthetically pleasing. Enough so that he is tempted to touch it—trace his fingers along one of the veins to see what sort of response that gains him, maybe even close his thumb and forefinger around it and squeeze. He resists, though, and wills himself to be content lying on his side watching John spit into his palm and then stroke his fist over his cock.
Spotting John, he grinned toothily and shoved his phone into his coat pocket. “Excellent! You’re here. Can I come in?”
Fine, yes, you’re right. I am an amateur. I said as much in the first email I sent, but apparently you skimmed that one as well. Actually I’m starting to wonder if you’re just a shit communicator all around. I bet if I really looked closely at your guide I’d find errors all over the fucking thing.
Sherlock came closer, laying a hand on either side of John’s waist. John jolted in surprise at the touch, then stood still as Sherlock stepped even closer, pressing her groin against John’s bum. Curious, John glanced over her shoulder, but Sherlock’s head was bowed, her fringe blocking John’s view of her expression.
‘You’re cracking,’ he told himself. ‘This man means literally nothing to you. You’re lonely and damaged, and he gave you something to do. What would Ella say if she knew what you were doing?’
It wasn’t, apparently. John nudged one rounded tip against the side and let out a throaty sob. Her cunt clenched around Sherlock’s fingers, as powerful as a shockwave.
John’s bedroom looked more or less the same as it had the last time Sherlock had been up here. The bed was perfectly made, the chest of drawers empty, the suitcase still unpacked.
As Sherlock shuffled into position, John sat up so that when Sherlock’s cock was lined up he could sink onto it with a grunt. Sherlock was absurdly thankful for the condom, which numbed the sensation of John’s warm body welcoming him in. Otherwise, he suspected he’d have embarrassed himself horribly.
You can’t just say it means something to you but not say what it means, you tease! So go on, what do my skill points mean?
By the looks, Sherlock had bought every blood bag in the clinic, certainly more than twice what he usually bought. The cooler he’d used to transport it all was full to the brim, and he was stuffing them one by one into every available empty space in the fridge.
Sherlock buried his face in the bedsheets and moaned, half in pleasure and half in disappointment. There would be no proposal tonight, he supposed.
“All right. Well... I was thinking the other day about what you said, about knowing that you can’t help someone who doesn’t want to be helped. I reckon that means you knew, yeah? You knew that Victor, erm, had a problem?”
At that, Sherlock turned to John as well—the first time since they’d arrived that he had acknowledged John’s existence. His gaze flickered over John from head to foot, lingering on his face, and then Sherlock’s lips went so thin and tight they nearly disappeared. He flushed even more, all the way to the tips of his ears.
“Female, late thirties. Height of 1.7 metres, weight of 72.4 kilograms. Is it possible it would take less than an hour for the body to burn?”
“C’mon,” John said. There was a waver in his voice. His face was flushed, his pupils dilated. “Let’s have a chat while we eat.”
“Yes, thank you.” Sherlock propped her elbows on her knees with a sigh. Perched on the back of her armchair, she’d been pondering one of the cold cases Lestrade had dropped off earlier, although she suspected now that she wouldn’t have the focus for it any longer. “I know it’s fine.”
John whimpered, almost swept away by the thought. “God, yes.” Then Sherlock’s tongue skidded perfectly over his fraenulum, and John nearly sobbed. “There. Oh god, right there.”
“There we go,” John says, when Sherlock has swallowed him all the way to the root. His pubic hair tickles Sherlock’s nose, sticks to the drying mucous below Sherlock’s nostrils. “Quite the little tart, aren’t you? If you’re good enough, sweetheart, I might be willing to throw in an extra gram or two more than we agreed—”
Then Sherlock loosened the arm around her and moved it instead so that she could cover John’s mouth with her palm.
“No, of course not.” He said it quickly, and John could easily picture him looking away and grimacing in embarrassment. “Just… delete that, forget it. It doesn’t matter. Think about the sex workers, John. A woman or man of your choice beneath you, spreading for you, your fat cock in their arsehole—”
, Sherlock thought heatedly, albeit more at himself than John. A photo like that, inexplicit and suggestive, would’ve piqued Sherlock’s interest because he was used to exploring possibilities. John’s mind was duller, less imaginative. He’d need something more.
Which was precisely when John, who had been napping at the foot of Mrs Hudson’s bed the last time she’d seen him, batted a bauble off one of the lower branches.
“That’s wasteful,” said John, scandalised. “Which is even worse than extravagant. I’m not going to throw away a perfectly good sex toy.” No, he would look up how to clean a Fleshlight online. Easiest method, what materials to avoid, and all of that. “Also, you’re meant to be
John lets go suddenly, and far too soon, and Sherlock’s head jerks sharply forwards, momentarily disorienting him. Then he hears John’s zip being undone, the shuffling sound of fabric being moved—
“There’s literally no difference in how it’s pronounced, Sherlock. Child, childe, it sounds the same.”
He examined the packaging, turning it over and over in his hands and trying to decide if he really wanted to open it, until Sherlock finally replied.
“Of course there was a case.” The offense in Sherlock’s tone was belied by how very determined he seemed to be to stare straight ahead. “A long-term case. I’m still—”
Sherlock’s hand twitched again, more strongly this time. John stared down and saw that her own grip had tightened, wrinkling the skin below Sherlock’s knuckles. When she loosened her hold, Sherlock let out a quiet “Nngh” of protest that cut swiftly off when John’s other hand covered her wrist, fingers curled so the tips were pressed into Sherlock’s palm.
‘How much more obvious can it get,’ John thought, ‘that you won’t live up to his expectations? Wouldn’t it be better to end it now, before he’s well and truly bored of you?’
It was a gross understatement. Sherlock suspected that the emotion rolling and rattling through her was something more akin to terror than mere nervousness. She hovered in John’s open doorway like a rude and unwelcome guest, feeling even more gangly and coltish than usual as she stared at the vague outline of John’s nude form beneath the duvet.
It took seconds to locate the lubricant bottle trapped between folds in the duvet and pour a generous amount of its contents into his hand, which was entirely too long for Sherlock. He couldn’t slip back inside John quickly enough: two fingers this time, which didn’t sink quite as effortlessly in as the one had done. Still, a bit of pressure, and Sherlock managed to fit the tips inside. The rest of the length went easily, with a soft squidging sound that tore a choked moan from Sherlock’s throat.
“Good.” John’s smirk became a smile, bright and cheery. It lit up his whole face; Sherlock’s heart pounded against his sternum. “I’ll see you tonight, then.”
We could play Diggy Hole again I suppose. Only, does that not sound like it might be a maybe not so good idea to you?
It was a crime scene photo. Or rather, it was a photo of a crime scene photo. There was a young woman lying on a red patterned rug, dead: her throat slit and her head bashed in. Her limbs were extended, her legs spread.
The first few are gentle, tentative, involving more fingertip than nail, trailing up and down either side of Sherlock’s spine so lightly it begins to tickle. He shivers and squirms and snaps, “Harder, for god’s sake—”
“Goodness,” she said, “I see why he’s so fond of you. Aside from your looks, I mean. Although I still say it was awfully rude of you, sneaking out after a night of passion. And after all the time you spent playing hard to get!”
I’m sorry to hear that you’ve been busy. I’ve never had traditional full-time employment—the very thought of it is hateful, in fact—but from what I understand, the loss of it usually comes with a great deal of stress.
Of course it was. It was always the husband. An unfortunate fact of reality, the darkest corner of the marriage tradition, and Scotland Yard couldn’t even figure that out.
Once the waitress had left, John didn’t hesitate to open the box and investigate its contents. In part because he’d nothing else to do, but mostly because he was curious.
She blew John’s hair away from her mouth and said, “Out of curiosity, what are your thoughts on a harness?”
It’s maddening, and it goes on and on until Sherlock is shaking, sobbing, and helpless to do anything but fist his prick and wail while John jerks himself to orgasm and smears his come all over Sherlock’s reddened arse cheeks.
To John’s surprise, Sherlock was the one who wiped it away, uttering a quiet sound of annoyance. Covering John’s hand with his own, he tipped the cup towards John’s lips. “You have to drink faster,” he said. “Ugh, it’s already cold. Soon it’ll start to clot.”
John draws back, rests his forehead against Sherlock’s, and swallows thickly. “I should warn you. I haven’t exactly done this sort of thing before. The whole, um… sex with a man thing, that is.”
“You’re really quite hopeless at this, aren’t you?” she said. “You’re lucky there’s no competition in here. He’d be already mated and expecting kittens before you got anywhere at this rate.”
“A few hours after his last victim,” Sherlock said, “and now he receives a text that can only be from her. If somebody had just found that phone, they’d ignore a text like that, but the murderer—”
She hoped it wouldn’t, of course, but it was probably better to be overly cautious. She set the box down a fair distance from Sherlock, who fortunately didn’t rush to investigate it but rather sat down where he was, his head cocked with interest.
But that’s worse. The thoughts come faster: Blood loss. The unshattered mirror. The cork in the bottle, blocking the blood flow, Sherlock hasn’t been murdered yet, the bullet’s still inside him.
Sherlock, however, didn’t seem to particularly care. Not about the tree, anyway. The box it had been stored in was another story. Sherlock delighted in leaping in and out of it, pawing and clawing gleefully at the inside corners, and rubbing his little cheek against one of the outside corners again and again.
A bang, followed by a softer thud, from elsewhere in the flat stopped him short. He lifted his head, gasping, his hair stuck to his temples with sweat. His brain spun and spun, pushing past the haze to identify the sounds: front door, heavy shoes kicked immediately off indicating familiarity, approaching footsteps, quick stride, wide stance—
But she didn’t. She said, quite calmly, “Oh, right. Hang on a mo’,” then went into the kitchen and returned with a BlackBerry box and a steaming cup of coffee, both of which she set on the table in front of John. “I’m to tell you the coffee has already been paid for, and if you’d like something else to drink or anything to eat, that’ll be paid for as well.”
So while John is in the kitchen, Sherlock removes his coat and scarf, hangs them both neatly up, and sits in his armchair across from John’s while he waits. Remembers John in his lap, discussing limits and safewords, John coddling him and trailing his hands over Sherlock’s bitten throat. He was so hopeful then. So certain he was doing well, behaving perfectly.
John hears it anyway, and bares his teeth. “Don’t. Just—you don’t understand. I’m going to ruin her. All right? She’s not even a year old, and I’m—I’m shouting at her. I’m frustrated with her. I’m—”
“I’m not distracted,” Sherlock said, low and hoarse and, even to his own ear, not entirely convincing. “I’m only….”
He rubbed his cheek along the side of John’s cock, spreading the saliva and teasing the red, swollen flesh. Turning his face, he replaced his cheek with his tongue, coaxing out a pitiful twitch and a drop of precome from the slit. John grabbed at his hair, needy and fully prepared to beg.
He could. Graham Doss was youngish, probably still in his twenties, white, and muscular. His hair was blond with dark roots: dyed.
“How about,” he said, and Sherlock cut himself off mid-word, “we compromise? No more money through PayPal, and one gift a month—
And he might’ve recanted, if Sherlock continued to refuse. But then, jaw clenching, Sherlock reached for a coverall with one hand while he unbuttoned his coat with the other.
Unlikely. Sherlock cannot fathom a world in which anyone, even John Watson, would consider him ideal for marriage. Not to mention, after having endured one previous failed marriage, John will no doubt be more cautious of entering into any future marriages.
Sherlock moves John’s clothes from the upstairs bedroom into the downstairs one. In part because he knows John would not appreciate being left to do it all himself, and in part because the idea of John’s belongings continuing to exist so far from Sherlock’s is abhorrent.
She pauses, no doubt waiting for him to respond, but Sherlock has nothing to say. He and John may have been better together once, but now there is Rosie. Now there is betrayal, and a broken vow, and the ghost of a woman that neither of them ever really knew.
He could smell John there. The dried sweat, the heavy musk. Maybe even the very, very faint odour of residual piss, or perhaps that was simply Sherlock’s imagination, overactive now that John’s cock was so close and his trousers still unzipped. Sherlock nuzzled closer, inhaling deeply.
He did it again, and again, experimenting with different angles and depths until he found a good one: with his fingers half inserted and crooked upwards and the toy’s material stretching around him, wet and glistening. He took another photo and sent it to Sherlock.
It’s the pet name, spoken in such a tender tone, that does it. A tangle of sentiment, composed of too many emotions to bother identifying, forms in Sherlock’s throat.
Oh yes, so much for John being invaluable to Sherlock’s investigation. Still, John swallowed his shame and his disappointment, and pushed on. “It’s clumsy, yeah, but it’s not totally unskilled. It’s the proper technique, anyway, and those are good-quality polyglycolic acid sutures. I’d say whoever did this has at least some sort of medical background, and access to medical supplies.”
John carries himself stiffly, avoiding large spine and shoulder movements so he doesn’t irritate the still-stinging scratches on his back, and Sherlock has the careful, not-quite-limping gait of a person who’s just enjoyed multiple rounds of vigorous anal intercourse.
“Break it off yourself before he has the chance,” he tells her solemnly. “You’ll be better off without him. He hates cats, you know. He’s a horrible fit for you.”
. He wanted so badly to be sweet. John positively doted on him when he was sweet. He scooted backwards, off John’s lap, so he could nuzzle John’s belly and then his groin, dragging his nose up and down the bulge in John’s jeans—his prick wasn’t hard, not yet, but Sherlock could fix that easily. Just a few moments longer, and John would undo his zip and let Sherlock lick—
Sherlock who often went so long without blood that his skin turned greyish, his fangs were perpetually exposed, and his eyes glowed. Not to mention that when he reached that point he also tended to stare so intently and blatantly
Sherlock turned and crawled across the sofa cushion towards John. He was welcomed warmly, with John lifting his arm and sitting up straight, making his lap a flat, sturdy pillow for Sherlock’s head. The scrubs were soft and loose, bunching up and slipping about on John’s thighs while Sherlock nudged and nuzzled, getting comfortable. They were too large for John—a spare set given to him when his own clothes had been stained in the man’s blood.
Some part of John expected the waitress at Speedy’s, which was indeed on Baker Street and quite easy to find, to stare blankly at him when he told her, stuttering a bit, that the atomic number of bismuth was 56.
Lestrade’s sigh was nothing compared to Sherlock’s, which was so heavy and dramatic—complete with arm waving and eye rolling—that John was reminded of a child mocking an adult’s very justified exasperation. “Oh, for god’s sake. Look. No defensive wounds or indications of a struggle on the bodies—he didn’t kill them; he only found them dead. Why steal the organs of dead bodies? Not to sell them—organ harvesting is an incredibly delicate process, not something this person seems capable of. Look at the Y incisions, the stitches!”
Lastly, John retrieved his pistol from the desk drawer and slipped it into the inner pocket of his coat. The weight of it was soothing, grounding. He spent a moment examining himself, making certain the bulge of the firearm didn’t show, and then he left.
Really, it was just a shit idea all around. Off the top of his head, John could imagine over a dozen ways this night could end in disaster.
“No, it isn’t.” Sherlock wound his arms around John’s waist and palmed at John’s groin. “But you don’t
Cleaning the blood away, John realised. As though that would do any good when his entire front was literally coated in the stuff, when his trousers and jumper were no doubt stained so badly that there’d be nothing for it but to burn his entire outfit.
He is promptly rolled onto his stomach, still in John’s lap, John’s grip preventing him from falling off the bed, and John wraps an arm around his waist and closes a hand around his prick, encouraging Sherlock to thrust into his tight, warm grip.
A trickle of pleasure down his spine. Finally, someone else to acknowledge the most momentous occasion of Sherlock’s otherwise dismal life.
Which wasn’t anywhere within easy reach, now that Rosie was crawling and would soon be walking. Nor would it do any good against…whatever it was.
Then Sherlock glanced up, spotted John, and froze, his expression twisting into one of wide-eyed, open-mouthed, deer-in-the-headlamps awe. Like John was royalty about to approach his table, like he could scarcely fathom the sight.
“Vividly,” said Sherlock, in the tone that meant anything John had to say was infinitely less interesting than whatever he thought John should be saying. “So vividly, in fact, I’m reliving the conversation right now. Open it.”
“Please,” John says. His voice is hoarse—he ran out of water a long time ago—and his entire body feels raw. A sob swells in his throat and finds its way from his lips. “I can unbuckle myself, and you can still… please, Sherlock, just fuck me, I need it—”
John lifts himself to his feet again and carries on, dragging Sherlock not just around the sitting room but into the kitchen and bedroom as well, until the skin on Sherlock’s knees is red and raw and hurts too much to continue.
. Sherlock’s mind went strange and staticky. His fingers pressed into his forehead, pulled at his fringe, as he bucked and shook and came with a startled gasping cry.
JohnHWatson: Well, except for the bit where its eyes should be bulged too, at least at the very first part of the bloat stage, before they deflate. More like 8P
“Her phone. Where’s her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body; there’s no phone in the case. We know she had one—that’s her number there, you just texted it.”
Sherlock let out a bark of laughter, mostly drowning out Mike’s gasp of horror. “Oh, don’t worry,” he said, grinning widely. His teeth, on full display, were perfectly straight and white and deceptively human. This time John couldn’t hide his shiver. “It is.”)
The words were muffled, but John could feel the rumble of them against his skin. His relief—sharp and sweet—was eclipsed by his awareness of Sherlock’s mouth trailing lower, licking the lower curve of John’s back before drifting even lower still: skimming John’s tailbone.
The scarf. John had completely forgot about it. He couldn’t even remember what he’d done to the Harrods bag when he’d got back to the flat last night.
While John watched, confused and embarrassed, the waitress appeared and began to clear the table. Just as Sherlock had claimed, she didn’t seem at all bothered by the spectacle Sherlock was making. Without a word, she gathered their plates and left.
Over the next several days, the idea blossoms like a drop of blood in water, colouring the whole of Sherlock’s thoughts.
Sherlock nods to indicate his agreement, and then John is stretching his skin and keeping it taut while he positions the scalpel.
The lamplight glinted off John’s hair in such a way that Sherlock could see the multitude of grey hairs mixed with the blond. Or perhaps it was the other way round? He was more grey than blond these days.
Hello! Note the three new tags, and maybe also take a minute to remind yourself of the old ones. I know that daddy kink is not everyone's cup of tea, and it's not my intention to squick, trigger, or catch anyone off guard. :)
He could have, for instance, sulked over the utter dearth of interesting cases and John’s insistence on
“Of course I am,” Sherlock assures him. Then, to prove it, he summarises: “You want me to be honest about my sexual interests.” And he can do that, he tells himself. He can. “I like being marked. I like after you hurt me, the… the aftercare. When you—” The words form, and he flinches at the thought of them.
Sherlock fled the kitchen, and in the process banged his knee on the table leg and nearly fell to the floor like the can of beans. Ears burning, he retreated to his bedroom, where he remained until dinner and then retreated back to afterwards.
She concentrated on the protected bite mark instead. Scraped her cheek across the plaster again and again and then turned her nose into it, inhaling the very faint (possibly imagined) scent of antiseptic and antibiotic cream. She even gave in to the urge to lick it gently, barely brushing the tip of her tongue across its surface. It tasted of nothing but the woven fabric it was made of, no soaked-up sweat or lingering blood, not even a hint of the plaster’s adhesive, but the thought of the wound beneath it—maybe still swollen and red, throbbing with John’s pulse—made her feel like she could purr with satisfaction and contentedness.
Yes, Sherlock had been pleased when John phoned to say that he was moving back to Baker Street after the divorce was finalised. (Specifically, Sherlock had rung off and promptly done a silent celebratory leap before rushing to tell Mrs Hudson the news.) But he’d had no intention at all of
John sat up, clasping the ring between his thumb and forefinger. His expression was alarmed. “You didn’t think it was meant for someone else, did you?”
“Dinner,” Sherlock said quickly. “With me. We can… there’s a good Chinese at the end of Baker Street.”
“There, right there,” John said, beginning to pant. She peered into Sherlock’s face through half-lidded eyes, and bit her bottom lip as her pussy clenched again and grew even slicker. Sherlock could feel the wetness oozing over her own knuckles. “Is that okay? How do I look?”
He crumples, allows John to gather him up like a distraught child and coo meaningless platitudes, telling him “It’s all right, love. You’re okay. That’s it, sweetheart, I’ve got you.”
“Don’t be obtuse,” Mycroft says with a deep scowl. “Even if I can’t entrust you with your own safety, I can certainly entrust John Watson with it.”
He watched as she made him a cup of tea and then accepted it from her hands when she offered it. But to his dismay, she didn’t leave when that was done. Instead, she made herself a cup and sat in John’s chair, which she angled towards him, as though she meant to stay and chat.
Sherlock is being coddled, he realises. Treated precisely like the amateur that he is, the amateur that John has just accused him of being. His hackles rise, and he wants very much to fold his arms and huff and turn away in protest, but that would mean letting go of John, something he is very much loathe to do at the moment.
Sherlock knew that spot well. The tip of a slender, strong vibrator against it could make John thrash and keen, reaching for any part of Sherlock she could clasp and cling to when she came.
There was the snick of the lubricant bottle, and then John was rolling towards him, slipping two fingers into him.
Then John dropped her head back and moaned, high and long, and Sherlock lost the plot entirely because John was gorgeous like that.
True to his word, Sherlock removes his fingers soon after, and then John hears the unmistakable sound of a zip being undone. Sherlock undressing in preparation for the change, he assumes.
‘Oh,’ John thought, stunned. ‘Oh god.’ Aloud, he said, “So you invited me to get coffee somewhere that isn’t your flat, and you made me pay.”
“To pick something up,” he’d said as he put on his coat, and John had long since learned not to push for details. The less he knew about Sherlock’s experiments, the better.
Which was a good thing, as far as John was concerned. Christ, had Sherlock really been keeping track of when John’s nipples hardened? John was no stranger to people staring at her tits, but to think of
Sweat beaded on John’s forehead, dampening the greying hair at her temples, and dripped down her neck to her sternum. Her breasts, heavy and soft, bounced with every movement, and with John leaned backwards as she was, her spine arched, they looked even larger than they were.
Sherlock dressed for dinner with the care and consideration of a man dressing himself for the most important day of his life.
Sherlock opens for him, lets himself be pinned against the floor and snogged until he’s lightheaded and panting, clinging to John, his prick finally beginning to take an interest in the proceedings as John grinds against it, making muffled desperate noises into Sherlock’s mouth.
“All right?” Sherlock said. His tone was smug. He knew exactly what he was doing to John, that John had been only somewhat in the mood until now.
Number 3 Lauriston Gardens was swarming with activity: flashing lights, a growing crowd of gawkers, and police officers rushing about with their radios. It made the crime scene in Islington seem like a quiet church in comparison. Even John’s trip there was more eventful than the taxi ride to Islington had been: it even included a string of phone booths that seemed to ring just as John was hurrying past on the pavement, although he paid them little attention, too focused on reaching Sherlock before ‘
Sherlock tipped his head back, glancing up and catching the grimace of pain that flickered across John’s features before it melted into a smile. At the crest of Sherlock’s right scapula, John’s nails dug sharply in, delivering a bite of pain in playful retribution.
The worst thing was that John was tempted, even though it would go against everything he’d come here to accomplish.
JohnHWatson: Well yeah but even if we weren’t. You haven’t offended me that much, not even at the very beginning when you were a prick.
A burst of panic. A single bacterium feeding, growing, splitting into two, four, eight—building a veritable colony of self-disgust and regret in Sherlock’s mind, particularly when John’s eyes only got wider.
John stared, strangely breathless. That was… he didn’t even know what that was. ‘Amazing’ didn’t even really describe it, but it was close enough.
Definitely bisexual, then. And although Sherlock’s hopes soared, she would need time to acclimate. She’d spent entirely too long wishing she had a cock so that she would be capable of satisfying John’s need for one.
And now, while Sherlock stares down at it, still feeling the ghost of John’s touch—it gathers together all the pieces of Sherlock’s shattered composure, and his heartbeat finally slows, his breathing evens out.
John wasted no time bending forwards to soothe the hurt with his mouth, pushing his tongue into Sherlock’s loose arsehole easily, licking at his own come.
She wasted no time following Sherlock’s orders. With one hand she parted her labia and with the other she flicked at her clit, testing the sides of it and then—oh, that was it—the top, pushing down on the hood until it nearly covered the little nub before drawing it back again.
Gradually John’s defensiveness wilted, replaced by general dissatisfaction with his own sodding existence.
It’s fine. The bleeding is staunched, the wound sufficiently dressed and hidden. As long as Sherlock is careful, as John said and as he intends to be, everything will be fine.
he wasn’t thinking clearly—but also because this was John he was dealing with. For all the times that John had played perfectly into Sherlock’s plans, he still occasionally fouled everything up.
He tapped the folder with one finger and then, realising his coffee was still just sitting on the table growing cold, scooted one of the cups towards himself and popped off the lid, letting loose a little cloud of steam. At the question, Sherlock sat tall in his chair, practically glowing with pleasure, although he waited until he had John’s full attention again before he answered.
“I didn’t steal them,” Sherlock replied, in the overly solemn tone that meant she was being a lying little shit.
“I’m so glad you two have worked everything out,” Mrs Hudson says. Once the tea tray’s been sorted, she seats herself in John’s chair, smoothing her skirt beneath her.
But looking at him, with his bottom lip red from where he’d bitten it and his cheeks flushed, his curls messy, and his eyes bright, John couldn’t find it in himself to be anything but pleased. Pleased and awed and adoring.
He’d never been good at doing what he was told. Not when it was his own safety at risk, in any case.
Oh yes, John was feeling very relaxed and blood-swollen between her thighs. She had half a mind to say, ‘Want to feel?’ and shove Sherlock’s hand down her trousers—and Sherlock probably wouldn’t complain—but that would ruin the plan John already had in mind.
Sherlock echoed the sigh, albeit with more resignation. “Worth a try. I’ve been trying to get you a case, you know. An
John shakes his head again. His expression is as dark as a crypt. “Yeah, but I didn’t mean to bruise you this badly. I didn’t even realise I
“Dirty talk,” John said, only mildly surprised. It was far from the most unexpected thing Sherlock had ever said to him. “It’s all right. Depends on what sort of dirty talk it is, I suppose.”
John chuckles, playfully cruel, and drags his fist down the length of Sherlock’s cock, pulling the foreskin until it covers the sensitive head and makes Sherlock moan and ache.
John couldn’t help but snort. “You don’t need an erection to have sex. Hell, you don’t even need to have sex to carry on an affair.”
He kept his mobile in his hand as he walked, so that when it buzzed again with SH’s response, he needed only lift it to read the screen.
,” Sherlock answered, in a tone like he thought John’s comment was completely inane. “Nevertheless. Because your… assistance has been valuable to my work, I wanted to reward you.”
a stalker. John was fairly sure of that. Also, John couldn’t imagine the police needing to consult someone like this SH bloke, nor that a man assisting the police would have to rely on attending a fetish event in order to investigate a suspect. Or, rather, rely on paying an utter stranger £1000 to attend a fetish event on his behalf.
in great detail, but say nothing about what Sherlock is to him. He will give no indication in his writing that one week ago he crouched over Sherlock and raked his nails down Sherlock’s back like a plough through soil and then, at Sherlock’s urging, knelt between Sherlock’s open thighs and masturbated while Sherlock kept his own arse cheeks spread, so John could see his tight little hole (could think of that instead of Sherlock’s hatefully limp cock) and get it nice and wet with semen when he came, Sherlock’s name on his lips.
When, on screen, Jack Nicholson walked into a ballroom filled with ghosts, John cocked his head towards Sherlock, sitting next to him on the sofa, and said, “Did you ever believe in ghosts?”
A bolt of alarm rattles his calm, and Sherlock has to employ all of his self-control to remain where he is and keep his pulse from spiking and his limbs from tensing. “Yes. Surely my enjoyment was
Only after the strongest of the aftershocks had passed did he realise how terribly, unforgivably selfish he’d just been, getting himself off without giving even a thought to John’s cock, and then he couldn’t pull out and climb off fast enough. As soon Sherlock’s weight on him was gone, John turned over. His penis flopped, mostly soft, and Sherlock thought his horror at his own thoughtlessness would choke him.
“Nothing at the moment, unfortunately,” said Sherlock, finishing with the towel. Only slightly damp now, John’s hair would dry looking shaggy and windswept but exceedingly attractive. “My doctor has informed me that I’ll need a few days to recover first.”
There was one last brutal thrust before Sherlock went still and her cries grew muffled. John felt something wrench at the collar of her coat. A bite, she realised. Sherlock was biting her coat as she came.
Sherlock pays, then watches John while they wait for their drinks to be made. He’s adopted a parade rest position, although he appears anything but at rest. His jaw is clenched, his shoulders tense, his gaze darting from person to person. Sherlock wonders if he even consciously realises he is scanning the coffee shop for threats, or if it is purely instinct, as ingrained in him as the need to blink.
No, Sherlock certainly wouldn’t be returning to the cold case anytime soon. She heaved another, heavier sigh. “It’s neither a yes nor a no. It’s….”
His attempts to inspire the same reaction caused by John’s hands in his hair, however, are largely unsuccessful. He can mimic John’s grip perfectly—same location, same section of hair, same amount of force, same direction of the pull—but all he achieves is the beginnings of a headache.
had any business visiting John at half four in the morning. In all the months he’d lived here, he’d not had a single visitor at even a decent hour.
But, he supposes, perhaps he shouldn’t discourage John from employing his mental faculties, no matter how ill-timed.
Nearly two months to the day that Mrs Hudson had brought Sherlock home, she woke to find that bits of wallpaper near the floor to the left of the sofa had been stripped from the wall and scattered about the carpet. Sherlock was rolling in the mess, purring, a thin ribbon of wallpaper hanging from his mouth.
The pace was quite slow, John reflected, and the thrusts were weak. Much slower and weaker than John was capable of, when he had Sherlock’s hot, tight arse clenched around his cock. In fact, the machine was using so little power that the whirring of its gears, the slow crank of the arm, resembled more of a sick whine than the rumbling-motor sound John had heard on the staircase.
, John thought, and did it again, then again, relishing how Sherlock’s limbs jerked helplessly, how she buried her face in John’s hair to muffle her cries.
“Well, come on,” Mrs Hudson said. “I got it out for a reason, you know. Calming effect, lowered inhibitions. It’s the perfect opportunity to make friends and get to know each other.”
As if John would refuse. “Oh god yes.” He reached for Sherlock, encouraging him to kneel atop John with his legs spread and John’s waist between his thighs. With John slouched as he was, it put the tent in Sherlock’s crisp white shirt at about the level of his sternum.
By the time that John finally spilled onto the sheets, clenching around Sherlock’s tongue and feeling Sherlock moan against his oversensitive skin, the ache in his arse had worsened to the point of smarting.
The parcel arrived in two, actually, and it contained a bit more than the one jumper (which was striped and black and white). There was also one plain white t-shirt, one pair of blue socks with little black skulls on them, and one red silk dressing gown with a satin stripe design.
Then Sherlock cleaned himself fastidiously, rinsing away the bits of cut hair and any dried sweat or trapped smegma. If John wanted anything to do with Sherlock’s prick—
“And I would do, if you wanted it.” Sherlock ducked her head to nuzzle at John’s shoulder, just above where—under the layers of her vest, jumper, and coat—her scar was hidden. The closest Sherlock had come to paying it any attention, although John suspected that doing so now was unintentional. “I could cover you with my coat—”
