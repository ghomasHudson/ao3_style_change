The bottle came to a slow stop... onto Castiel. Sam couldn't help but feel a bit of jealousy as the people whistled. An inch to the left and it would've landed on him. Castiel didn't seem bothered about the fact that he had to go into a closet with Dean for seven minutes. In fact, he was the first one to stand up between the two of them. Missy seemed disappointed, too, but shrugged it off as she chose the next person to spin.
Dean sucked in a deep breath and pulled out before slamming back in. Dean removed his hand from his mouth as he moved to pick up Castiel's other leg. His legs wrapped around Dean as Castiel used the wall as back support. Dean continued moving his hips, sweat covering both of them quickly as they both breathed their screams, not wanting to be too loud.
His eyes widened when he lowered himself some more, Dean's tip penetrating his tight, unused hole. He released a gasp at the feeling, overwhelmed. He lost his balance, not being able to catch himself in time as he fell hard into Dean's dick. He gasped, half in pain, half in pleasure. He completely forgot about lubing it up to make it easier. What was the point of watching all that porn if he wasn't going to learn anything from it?
The angel moved to the hunter's neck as they both worked to get each other's clothes off, rushing to get the other naked as if it were a race. Soon, their naked bodies were melting together, their legs tangled with each other in confusing twists and turns. Their dicks rubbed together as their lips refused to part, a moan escaping their mouths every now and again.
"Fuck," Castiel whispered at the same time Dean's dick finally penetrated him, Dean going halfway before pulling back.
Dean hummed as he kicked his shoes off. "He was so great," Dean continued, Sam clenching his jaw tightly. "I wish we didn't have to leave. I could see us having a future together, y'know? Like a white fence, apple pie kinda life." Dean smiled, his eyes drifting off into space. "Oh, Sammy, you should've seen him. He was just... mmm, perfect."
"Well, we fucked," Dean confessed, grinning widely, "and I liked it. No, I actually loved it. I love him." Dean's face went serious for a moment, his eyes widened as he said, "I can't believe I said that out loud."
Sam shouted with an I don't care attitude as the liquid shot out of his dick the next time he bottomed out, the white goo landing on the shirt Dean's wearing, a little disappointed that Dean didn't release his own come into him at the same time. No matter, Sam could keep going. He's young, he has the stamina.
"I do," Castiel whispered, huffing. "Keep fucking me, Dean. Never stop. Fuck me!" Castiel moaned and groaned as Dean started hitting that sweet spot he didn't know existed until now, trying his very best not to scream out loud. "I'm going to come."
He started to wonder if his dick was better than oxygen like Castiel had said, his eyes wandering to the crotch area of his jeans where he could just picture Dean's dick. He licked his lips and looked back up at his brother's sleeping face. "Dean?" he whispered.
Castiel removed himself from Dean's dick, but his hand still worked as he said, "We only have seven minutes. What else do you want to do?"
Castiel suddenly came out of his euphoria when Dean said his name, pulling away from Dean's hand to maneuver himself above his dick, his mouth going to the tip. They made eye contact as Castiel bottomed out on Dean's length, the angel taking it like a champ as he went up and down without so much as a gag. Guess that's the perks of being an angel of the lord.
He sat down on a chair facing her, in the now-familiar room. On the shelf behind her desk was a picture of her holding a small girls hand. Alex Mills. Next to that was a picture of her with her arm around a blond woman who had a younger Alex on her lap. Donna.
“To go on a date with me?” came the dark-haired boy's reply, slightly hesitant but full of hope. “And it’s completely fine if you’re straight, I don’t mean to assume or anything but if you’re not the-“
Castiel smiled at him again, this time a genuine one as he picked up his sandwich and coffee. He picked put his bag by its strap and then walked over to where Dean was sat. He slung the bag over the chair and set down his breakfast. Then he sat down himself.
“Just gave you the answer to your doubt last class, Mr Winchester. Did you get that down or do you want me to repeat it?”
Relief washed through Cas as he observed Rosie. It was almost as if she was meant to be with them. He reached out and unlocked the door. "You'll be happy here, sweetheart," he promised her. "I already bought you so many toys."
Playing with the babies, Dean tried to make himself breathe as he was handed a phone by security. Recognizing Gabriel's number, he answered.
"And you know that I'll give it to you." Nuzzling Sam's neck, Gabriel made a pleased noise as his hair tickled his face.
Gasping into Sam's mouth, Gabriel tugged at his hair. "Is that how it's going to be?" He purred, nipping at his lower lip.
Pulling back, Dean met Castiel's gaze as he exhaled slowly. "You know I mean it when I tell you how gorgeous you are, right?" Handsome wasn't enough to describe Castiel.
Castiel could feel his slick quickly dampening his boxers and sweatpants, but he didn’t care as he kissed Dean again. He didn’t care about the mess. Not when Dean’s hands were running through his hair and the alpha was making beautiful sounds of pleasure.
“No need. He likes to listen to me.” The taller man smirked a bit as he tucked the paper away for later.
Shaking his head, Gabriel watched his daughter and fiance. "This is perfect. We should go swimming later."
It took seconds, and then it was kicking in. Gabriel gave a small noise The needle tracks on his arm stood out in the strange lighting in the room, and Gabriel couldn't even help himself. Now he was actually leaning against Zachariah. "Mmm... thanks..."
Nodding eagerly, Sam obeyed the instructions. He stroked Gabe slowly, until his finger could slip into his lover. “Oh...”
"You're never going to have to, okay?"  Gabriel kissed his hair, smiling. "We're going to take care of our pups."
"You lot are adorable. The sexual tension with those looks was about to start a fire." Honestly, it was just sex. What was there to be outraged about?
Emma gave in, letting the woman help her pick out shoes. Spotting a pair of flip flops, she looked them over before adding them to the growing collection of shoes.
“Just start poking around. One day you’ll have a family and you’ll need the space. Plus it would be nice to come home for the summer and not sleep on the couch,” he teased gently.
Oh, his sweet boy... always not wanting to ask too much. Stepping in front of him, Gabriel cupped his face. "You have been so good about letting me spoil you like you deserve, Samshine. Pick out a comforter to go with your silk sheets. Please?"
With Gabe’s support, Sam felt he was excelling even more in his classes. He didn’t need to work, and he had never been one for partying, so his schedule mostly revolved around class, Gabe, Dean, Charlie, sleep, and two extracurricular clubs. He didn’t feel stretched thin any more and he didn’t have nightmares about work. He was thriving and he loved it.
"Mm. Sorry I woke you. Our kitten wanted love." Laughing a little, Dean yelped as the fluff ball raced off of the bed, down some pet stairs Gabriel must have gotten.
"No, no... I hate flying. And I promised you that I would call if it was too much," Dean told him, shaking his head.
Dean kissed his hair. "I'm going to do my best, just like Elias. You go ahead and go to the bathroom. I know you're not comfortable."
Michael inhaled a piece of breadstick and promptly started coughing until it was expelled, landing on the table near Dean. Shit.
"Okay, then. It was... I felt the same. I don't remember any nightmares, for once." Stroking his fingers back through Castiel's hair, Dean offered him a smile.
Her smile softened. “No, Dean. Far from it. I knew Cas loved me, and all I wanted was for him to be happy. He deserves happiness.”
Standing, Lucifer let himself enjoy the anguish his brother was feeling. "Good luck, Castiel. Your man's crying on the news. Don't worry. He said he was going to 'Catch me'." Lucifer rolled his eyes.
"...Worth every penny." Honestly, he'd spend a lot more just to make Sam happy- and hear that sound again. Starting the movie a few minutes ahead of where he'd left off, Gabriel slipped into his side of the bed.
Dean looked up from where he was working on dinner. "This is almost done. Is it Ellen? Our Ellen? He said her name earlier."
Dean hugged him, then sighed, stepping back. "All right, we're good... so... er... I'll see you in the morning or something."
Rubbing Castiel's back, Dean kissed his hair. "That's it, Cas... just relax for a moment. We'll get food from the cafeteria here in a minute while they move Gabriel, okay? We don't want to be in the way and the Moose is big enough."
Shaking his head gently, Gabriel hugged Sam tighter. "Shh... don't you apologize for this. I told you that I was going to take care of you and I meant it. It's part of my love language."
"Ditto." Gabriel relaxed, then sighed. "That assbutt is going to sue me." He quoted his brother on the curse.
"I didn't mean... Cas, your pup is here, heat is possible. That's all." Gabriel explained, moving to burp Zep.
"I will, I promise." Gabe gently smoothed the covers before he slipped from the room. Spotting Charlie in the kitchen, he put a hand over his face. He could smell Sam- and some Cas, but mostly his mate, all over him from the cuddling. "I'm in so much trouble, Charlie…"
Dean set up a litany of curses as he felt his pleasure building. He was trying to get Cas off too, but the other man seemed to be single-minded in his focus.
"Well... er... that'll be fine. I'm actually looking for a better apartment since I'm not having to pay... er..." Student loans. Sammy's tuition. The funeral bills. "I paid off Dad's bills, the funerals…"
"Fuck, Cas..." Dean pulled Castiel's mouth to his own, nipping at his mouth, letting his fingers slip up Castiel's shirt.
"Ah, hell, man... that's shit. I'm sorry." Dean shook his head, feeling himself tense a little at the thought of the other man being hurt. "Look, I can't blame you for that at all. I'd like to be your friend at least."
Smiling against his lips, Dean slid his hands down to cup his ass. "So damn perfect, Cas... when do you wanna get married?"
"Nah, Tara. Concentrate on you, sweetie " He assured her. He would worry about it after the adrenaline wore off.
Smiling, Cas moved out of Dean’s lap and watched as Dean scooped James up with ease. He brought her back to them and Cas snuggled into his side.
Stilling midchew, Dean glanced over at him, trying to see if he was angry. They hadn't done anything…
Sam looked tired. “I’ll let you handle it.” Gabe was better with that anyway. Sam knew he was too nice
"Let's get washed up the rest of the way since I made you a really dirty boy." Winking at him, Dean reached for his body wash and his poof.
Thankfully, it didn't take the men to get their prize, the smell of the pizza filling the car on the drive to the apartment.
Once again, Charlie was his saving grace. "I know you guys are nervous, but the other omegas are safe. I swear it. They're being helped, just like the two of you."
Cas broke the kiss after a moment and resumed stroking Dean's dick methodically. "Tell me if I do something you don't like."
Watching him smoke the joint, Dean reached over, rubbing his back only to get tugged more properly into the snuggle.
"If I tell you, it isn't a surprise." Green eyes dancing, Dean moved to hug Castiel from behind. "Want me to help serve dinner?"
“Don’t worry, it’s very sturdy.” Sam sat down in the hammock and got comfortable on his back. Then he held his arms out for Gabe.
Cas’s cheeks flushed. “I can’t wait to see a show...” He had never been allowed the opportunity, something that made him bitter. He should have been there for every show, for everything.
"Exactly. Gabriel, you help Cas get into the SUV, Sam and I will get this all packed up." Dean told them, taking charge of the situation. Thankfully, it didn't take them long to get it all taken care of.
"Please don't," he teased, bending down to check Jude's oxygen. "You getting some rest is all the thanks I need."
Gabriel watched him, humming to himself as he finished drying off and went over to the sink to brush his teeth.
Dean grinned, messing up Sam's hair before he cleared his throat, softly singing one of his songs as he entered the room. "Cas, love?" He sat next to him, stroking his fingers through his hair.
"How'd you get them?" Getting some chicken from a chicken wing, he set the bone on the plate before holding the chicken out to Scout.
Huh. Gabriel had said he was single for at least the last year... Then again, rubbers broke. "Well... have you asked him about it?"
Edited as of 9/7/21 with a few more lines as I'm working to get this posted- this may occur with other chapters as well.
thought that he was incredible. "Thanks. I've been hired to work on a Lady Justice for a big law firm. I'm scared out of my pants about it not being good enough but…"
hurt his man, though. He loved his Samshine too much. "This good?" He asked as he started to rinse out the conditioner.
"And?" Gabriel straddled Sam's lap, tilting his head at the vehement protest. "That doesn't explain why."
"Comfort is the first thought, but thankfully, these stores usually have some sort of person who can help us work it out. You let me know what you like." Gabriel leaned over, kissing his jaw.
"I swear, baby brother. Always. I would never do anything to hurt you." He swallowed hard, shaking his head. "I wish more than anything I could have stopped what happened. I'm so sorry it happened to you..."
"Well... have you seen Robinhood, Men in Tights?" Dean finished pouring the wine, then put the box back in the fridge.
The men had just gotten cleaned up and ready to go to the hospital to see the babies when Dean got a phone call from Crowley. The singer listened in horror as his manager explained about Gabriel's house burning down in Austin. Shit. He shoved a hand through his hair, glad that security had already been doubled.
Suddenly a tall, dark-haired man began making his way through the crowd. He looked tired and a little confused.
"Crowley is the one you punched for getting me drunk before I turned twenty-one." He'd also been despondent.
"I can have toys?" Looking up at Castiel, Jack bit his lower lip. He didn't even know what to say to that.
Leaning up, Dean pressed Castiel's hand against his phone. "Then take a picture." He purred just a hair's breadth from the younger man's lips.
"Fuck- CAS!" There was no holding back that shout of pleasure as Dean came. He didn't know how Castiel did it.
Nodding, Sam sat down on his desk. "I've wanted to be a lawyer forever. Specifically a lawyer for children and families."
"And this is from us," Dean handed her a bigger box containing a vase. "I'm glad that you liked them."
"Please, Sweetness? Tell me." Grabbing washcloth that he'd cooled with some ice water from the bar, Gabriel wrung it out before wiping it oh so gently on Sam's skin.
“Love you too, Gabe.” He adjusted his phone on the nightstand so he could continue to listen to his fiancé breathe.
Cas tried to reassure Emma with a pat on the back. “He’s okay. Gabe is great with babies, considering he’s one himself.”
"The variety is wide and plentiful- I make sure we get most of the new movies because of Cas." He pushed his hair back from his face before making his way carefully over to the popcorn.
"Damn good. If it has an engine, I should be able to fix it." Dean glanced over at Gabriel and Charlie, who both seemed to be plotting.
"Good night- er, shall I get Luke? Then he can tell you good night as well?" Standing, Michael hurried to go and check on his other brother.
Dean hated it, but he was a little glad that he wasn't quite walking yet. Castiel deserved some of his firsts.
Cas shrugged, admiring the necklace. “I don’t wear jewelry.” He started the next sentence cautiously. “But... if I had a wedding ring...I’d want something simple.”
"Do you want to see his picture?" Pulling up his messages, Gabriel held up his favorite of Sam so far so that his brother could see it.
The moment he felt Cas coming, Dean followed him. He pressed his face into Castiel's shoulder, growling his name.
They kissed again before making their way to the bed. "He's still very young...will he cry at night?"
"Deal. If they're willing." She grinned, hugging him close. "We just need to do the affiancing part."
"She's a good girl, she'd be just fine!" Reaching over, Dean tugged at a lock of Castiel's hair. "But if you insist, I guess that's fine."
Gabriel, of course, didn't go straight home- he put two and two together and got four. His brother had obviously been tortured by someone for years, likely someone in the accident earlier... so he went and copied every file connected to the accident before heading home.
"I love you too, Samshine." Kissing his mate's neck, Gabriel yelped when his daughter pulled at his IV. "Zeppy, Daddy needs that. We're using that to get Daddy some fluids."
Fuck. Gabriel kissed him deeply, his hand not stopping as he worked Sam through his orgasm. His boy was probably going to beat himself up, but seeing him come apart for him like that was easily one of the sexiest things that he had ever seen.
Sam felt Gabe’s hand slide into his, and he focused on squeezing Gabe’s fingers as hard as he could manage.
"Good." Gabriel kissed him again, then smirked, "I want to paint your sexy body with my mousse and lick it off."
Looking into Sam's beautiful eyes, Gabriel reached up to stroke Sam's hair back from his face. "I agree- but I do want to make it clear because I don't want any thoughts otherwise. I want you to live with me. I want us to start a home, a family... we're getting married. I don't want to sleep without you, ever again if I don't have to."
Crying out around Sam's cock, the older man curled his fingers, looking for Sam's prostate. Fuck- his cock was red, aching, and he wasn't sure he wouldn't come with Sam.
"You love driving me crazy, getting me all hard." Dean bit his lip at the low rumble from his boyfriend, then dove back in for another kiss.
Gabriel's hands skimmed over the blood on Dean, and he looked around for his brother. "Is... have you heard anything?"
Grinning, Gabriel encouraged his man. "So do you want to walk down the aisle to me or the other way around?"
"Oh,  few things." Dean laid down a leather roll on the table next to them, rolling it out to reveal his tools.
"Well... yeah. You said you wanted it, and we think it sounds perfect. We love you and Dean-o, Cassie." Gabriel shrugged a little, passing him the joint.
"Very. Almost as comfy as with you here." He shot him a soft smile. "You are my Samshine, my only Samshine, you make me happy, when skies are grey..."
Feeling his big body practically vibrating with excitement, Sam took a moment to give the dogs treats. Finished, he rushed up the stairs and into Gabe’s bedroom.
Dean came back and Cas wrapped his arm around his boyfriend’s shoulders. “Sam is having a lot of fun.”
Biting his lower lip, the blond swallowed hard. He could behave, especially if he got to do that. "I'll be good, Sir, I..."
“Yes” eileen said, smiling fondly. “He practically raised Sam, and when their father remarried, he raised Adam too.”
“Well Castiel, seeing that my file won’t load, and you’ve already seen me embarrass myself twice, would you care to join me?” said Dean.
“I probably have to submit a paper in the afternoon but I should be free by 6. Why?” he said nonchalantly but his stomach was fluttering with excitement.
He took a seat near the window which gave him a view of the street as well as the beautiful morning sky above the quaint buildings.
“Every stalker says that, but I believe you. You’re also right with regards to everything you said.”
“Come in.” Came her muffled voice, from the other side. “Oh hello Dean, you’re right on time, take a seat.”
Dean extended out a hand and Cas grabbed it, a tingle going down their spines the second their skin touched. Probably just static electricity, Cas thought.
“I’m going to excuse your swearing just this once because I assume you’re excited, but yes. I am being serious.”
“Alright then, that’s settled. I’ll email you the details and the schedule later, we’re going to have a couple of meetings with the crew before we start filming so that will be covered in the mail too.”
Whatever Dean expected, this was not it. Castiel wanted to see him again? Or was he just getting ahead of himself? He hoped to god it was the former.
He smiled an embarrassed smile and headed out the door. He checked his watch. It was 12:30 pm. In the end, he decided to ditch lunch. He texted Benny asking him and Bela to go ahead while he headed to his other classes. Just two more, then he could head home, and then-
Benny had picked up quite a few of his mannerisms as he just exhibited. Hearing him say ‘what is up my dude’ with heavily French accented English was really funny to dean.
He walked into the hospital and headed up to the attendings lounge to grab a cup of coffee and a croissant before he made his way to his office. On his way, he bumped into Eileen.
“See, I knew I had a stalker but I didn’t think he was dumb enough to follow me into a cafe and then sit down with me” Dean replied.
They spoke until they'd both completed their meals and then stayed a bit longer until their classes were due to begin. They walked to the university together, and just before Dean headed off to the film wing, he realised he didn’t quite wanna say goodbye yet. Maybe he should just ask him out right there? and if he was straight, the sooner Dean knew the better right?
“He’s good, and he’s doing pretty well at the firm.” Eileen said proudly. “Anyway, I just wanted to give you a heads up, Adam Winchester won’t be coming here today. He’s busy with a last minute press conference, and he’s really sorry to miss it.”
The dark-haired boy had a deep, gravelly voice with just a hint of a French accent, but he was undoubtedly an American. Dean could tell because of how his French accent mingled with his American one and because when he spoke, he spoke the same way.
“You know, you could have just asked for my phone and put it in.” Dean said, but the romantic in him was having a field day at this gesture.
“We did an internship in a museum together before he left for college HOLY SHIT DEAN ITS SO PRETTY THERE”
Holy fuck. Dean couldn’t hold back the smile any longer. He covered his face with a hand and pretend to take notes, but in reality, there was this huge, dumb smile plastered on his face and a deep deep blush spreading across his cheeks. Benny could feel the shift in dean because he nudged him and told him to get it together before professor Mills kicked him out. Dean ignored him.
“Dean, are you going to just sit there or leave? Class is over” Benny said, with a smack on Deans head.
“Also” Eileen trailed, “You and Dean are going to be working closely over the next few weeks, maybe months. We’re one of the first hospitals to start prescribing Neuraforte, and they’d like to keep a close watch on our stats and the patients’ reaction to it for a while.”
It was Castiel's turn, planting tiny kisses down Dean's chest as he moved to get to his knees, pushing Dean against the wall due to the lack of space. He unbuckled Dean's belt, unbuttoned his pants, and pulled the clothing to his ankles. He didn't hesitate to wrap a hand around the hard rod, Dean hissing at the contact. He didn't hesitate to moan as Castiel brought the head between his lips, his tongue twirling around the tip.
Dean growled lowly as he sat up, pushing Castiel onto his back as he took over the hovering position, looking down at Castiel with a glint of lust in his eye. Castiel, on instinct, spread his legs wide for the oldest Winchester. He moaned as he felt the tip of Dean push softly against his entrance, his eyes fluttering close.
Castiel's smile broke the kiss, Dean pulling up a tad bit so he could look the angel in the eye. "So good," he whispered, Dean mirroring his smile. "I'm going to-"
"I'm going to come," Sam confessed, looking down at Castiel's shirt Dean was wearing. He didn't want to get his jizz all over it... or maybe he did. Dean would probably just think it was one of theirs. "I hope we come at the same time, Dean," Sam whispered.
A low chuckle released Dean's throat as he rolled over to lean against Castiel, his lips immediately bending down to leave soft, teasing kisses up and down his neck and jaw. Chills ran up and down Castiel's spine as he moved his head, giving Dean more access to his neck. A small moan escaped Castiel as Dean placed a gentle hand on his covered dick, Dean's chuckling running over the angel's face.
The angel's moaning made Dean move faster, sitting up to move his hips better. He pushed Castiel's legs apart further, looking down at the two of them connecting with each other, watching his dick move inside Castiel. He panted, he moaned, he looked Castiel right in the eye as he pulled out, Castiel not hesitating to wrap his hand around the sensitive shaft. He finished him off, letting Dean release his cum onto Castiel's chest.
"Go!" Castiel demanded and Dean went all the way, slamming his dick into Castiel's ass without any more hesitation. Castiel started to scream, but Dean quickly covered his mouth with his free hand.
The party wasn't really Sam's style, but he went for Dean. He sucked it up and showed up, walking through the front door as all his classmates walked around the expensive house, plastic cups in their hands and Sam didn't even need to look inside a cup and smell it to know what it was. He was surprised at how many people had shown up. Then again, when the rich and popular head cheerleader, Missy Jenkins, throws a party, the whole school's invited. Even the people on the bottom of the totem pole. Which is how Sam managed to snag an invitation without Dean's knowledge.
"Ah, you're so fucking good, Dean," Castiel declared. "Ugh, right there. Yes, daddy, right there. Fuck!"
Castiel pushed Dean away and crawled on top of him, shrugging his trench coat off and tossing it aside to give him more room to move. Dean grabbed onto his tie and pulled him down, connecting their lips together with a fiery passion that it sent a pulse to both of their dicks. Dean gently placed his hands on either side of Castiel's face, pulling him deeper into the kiss.
Dean released a hearty chuckle. "Your dick wasn't even touched, you whore!" he stated, grinning. "Am I that good?"
The door was pulled open by the time they had finished dressing. Castiel was the first one to walk away from Dean, leaving him alone in the closet for a moment. As he watched him walk away, he had noticed that they had switched shirts. How they didn't notice when dressing was beyond him, but he didn't say anything. Dean knew John was almost done with the hunt and that he was never going to see Castiel ever again, so this was his token of the first time he felt love.
Sam started tugging his own dick as he rode Dean's, looking down at Dean's face to see a scrunched expression. What in the hell was going on in Dean's mind?
"Nobody cares," Sam demanded, rolling his eyes and crossing his arms over his chest. "Parties are meant to be fun, Dean, stop acting like my parent." Sam chose that word carefully. He knew that if he told him to stop acting like his dad, Dean's good mood would vanish quickly. He'd make him go home immediately.
"No." Sam stared at the TV, but when he was met with silence rather than argument, he sighed heavily as he rolled his eyes. "It was supposed to be me, Dean. The bottle was supposed to land on me. If someone fucking blew on it, it would have! I want you to fuck me just like you fucked that Cas kid." Sam huffed, throwing his hands in the air. "I want you, Dean, more than a brother. I just-" He cut himself off when he heard snores coming from behind him, turning his head to see that Dean had passed out.
"So hot, so perfect," Dean panted, watching Castiel swirl a finger through the mess on his chest before licking it off.
"Come on, Dean!" Missy squealed, jumping against Dean's back. She hung off his shoulder as she stared at him, completely oblivious to Sam's presence. "We're playing seven minutes in heaven. It's going to be fun!" She grabbed onto his wrist and started tugging him to the living room.
"Dammit," Sam muttered as he started taking his pants off. "He's passed out drunk, he won't remember."
"Shit, Dean," Sam panted, wincing as he moved up and down. "I need your dick, baby. I need you in me. Fuck, Dean. I love you so damn much. More than Castiel." Sam groaned and lulled his head back, his eyes fluttering close. "Castiel has nothing on me, Dean, and I'll show you."
He continued, carefully not to smack too hard against Dean when he bottomed out. At least I could bottom out on something, he thought bitterly, but that bitterness was immediately replaced with a loud groan as he found a sweet spot. "You feel so damn good, Dean, holy fuck," Sam stated at a normal volume, not even caring anymore if he woke up. He could just say that he slipped and his dick just ended up in his ass, he doesn't think Dean would care.
Ignoring the pain, he started going faster. Moans left Dean's throat, his eyebrows furrowed, but he still didn't wake up. Sam didn't know anymore if he wanted Dean to stay asleep. Yeah, he'll have a hard time talking himself out of it, but it's too late now. It's already happening and he knows Dean loves it just as much as he does, so he won't stop it.
Dean had managed to get home before John, much to Sam's surprise. Then again, knowing John, he probably won't come back until tomorrow morning. But Dean did stumble into the motel room, laughing as if he had heard the funniest joke. Sam couldn't even pretend to be happy that Dean got home safely, he was pissed. And jealous. It should've been him in there with Dean, not that Castiel kid.
The rest of the day passed by in a blur. Dean’s thoughts switched from the Medusa film to cas and back to the Medusa film again and then back to cas.
We meet Jody, Benny, Bela and Charlie in this one!! And also, dean gets something he’s wanted for a long time (2 things actually, but what they are is for you to find out :))
Cas was already waiting for him. They were both early. He was sat on the steps of the main building, wearing a dark blue turtleneck with black pants. His eyes looked like small water worlds on a backdrop of white. water worlds that have seen civilisations rise and fall, seen and nurtured and felt everything. Two small little water worlds of hope, and happiness.
Dean must have been staring at the projector blankly, his thoughts on Cas but he was trying not to show it when-
“Good. Now as I was saying, we’re going to understand lighting, its effects and the meaning it can have on a film today. You might want to take a few notes, but most of it is covered in chapter 9 in your textbook. I have handouts if you’d like some extra information.”
He was being too cool about this, with the number of butterflies in his stomach. Very unlike him, if the thought so himself.
8 am, a lovely Paris morning. The streets were full of bustling people heading to work and school, and if you looked closely you’d see a few people with bewildered and confused expressions walking around looking at everything in awe. Tourists. Dean loved them. They reminded him of himself, when not too long ago, he was wandering the streets of Paris, taking it all in.
"That's it, baby. Fuck..." Dean's fingers tightened on Castiel's hips, and he kissed along his neck,
Charlie reached out and squeezed his shoulder. "I took care of it. We knew what we were looking at."
"Well, I am Dean Winchester." Not that it meant a damn thing. He sighed. "I'm glad. I wanna stop and see him tomorrow. I'll bring the babies and food."
God, he looked amazing. Castiel was so close to his starting weight- he looked delicious. Dean could still feel where he'd been inside of him, and he shifted in his seat a bit.
Laughing softly, Dean pressed his face into his neck. "You're a bit like a spitting kitten right now. A fun fact, though, they wanted real, genuine terror on people's faces. They just got told “Its head will move” and "it's going to have teeth" - the script saying "This thing emerges"... and then that happened."
Sam gladly took the paper back, letting his fingers brush against Gabe's. "So you're no longer my professor."
Cas nodded and slid his arm around Dean's waist. With Gabe's help, they were able to get Dean into the guest room and lying comfortably in bed. Sam watched from the doorway, still worried but not as badly as he had been.
"I know, kiddo. We'll discuss it with your doctor." He sighed, then moved to pick up their daughter. "Sweetie, time to go home..."
"See what you do to me, Sam? I'm all hard for you." Wrapping a hand around his cock, Gabriel stroked it for a moment as he watched Sam's eyes.
Amused, Dean headed upstairs. He found Jack fully dressed and helping Theo into an oversize Batman shirt. Jack heard his dad and grinned. “Theo’s gonna be Batman today, Dad!”
"Mmm?" A little suction here and Dean stopped just short of leaving a mark. After all, he hadn't asked.
Cas carefully took Dean’s face in his hand. “I don’t like you,” he said irritably, but his scent screamed otherwise. “Don’t die.”
She passed the phone over to Sam, but Dean snagged it, then took a picture of the site for his phone. Visual reminders worked better than words on paper. "Here, Sam. Looks like a nice place."
Dean stole a kiss, then nodded as he pulled back. "Yeah, I sh- hey, it's Sammy. I thought he'd be busy with Gabriel." He grabbed his phone, leaning back against the hotel room's couch. "Heya, Sammy!
"How is it warm? We had to pump our water up from the well or get it from the pond," the boy explained, playing with the water a bit.
"Take a breath, Cas. We did it twice, you can do it again." Dean assured him, watching his belly tense
"...Then we should show people how to use them." Gabriel huffed, looking over at Sam. "I know things that I never wanted to know, Sammich. It's not fair."
"So you're my surprise? I am a fan." Dean lowered his body to the side a bit, watching as Castiel's hand moved. "That's so fucking hot. Makes me want to suck the head while you stoke... "
"Am I?" Laughing softly, Gabriel started to ease the red fabric down over his hips, slowly revealing his body.
“The way you said that almost sounded like one of those bad dating videos from the 80s,” Cas teased.
"Hear that, Rem? We'll get you some kick-ass toys, some bones, a bed- though I'm sure you can share mine, hm?" Dean didn't think he could sleep without the dog curled up next to him.
"Hey, Cas." Dean moved, sitting down next to him. "I'm... done with everything. It's ready to go. It's..." Terrifying. He moved, pressing his face into his neck.
After a third finger, Cas was confident Dean was ready for him. He withdrew his fingers and coated his cock in a generous amount of lube.
Bustling around the shop, the blond got things taken care of for the next day, and the place cleaned up as they talked. It felt good to be busy."Ethics, hm? My fiance's awesome at that."
"He's eating righ-" Meg heard a noise from in Gabriel's room and rushed inside only to see him shaking his head and pushing the food away.
“Good. Did you know Gabe is buying an apartment for Sam and Charlie?” Castiel murmured, knowing that it might help Dean relax.
Gabriel whined, unable to contain himself as his orgasm raced through him. The intensity of it made his legs shake, and he nearly fell from the force of it.
"She's so damn cute." And tiny. She looked better color-wise, though- and seemed to be looking around as the nurse handed Jude over to her Omega Daddy.
“Okay...” Needing to comfort him, Sam carefully climbed onto the narrow bed with Gabe. Then he tucked his injured lover against him. “When you’re not on the meds, ask me again.”
Cas flung his head back. “Y-Yes. I...I’ve never been free to...” He squirmed restlessly. “To speak dirty.”
Dean blinked, pushing his hair back from his face. After a second, he stepped closer to Castiel. "What are you planning?"
Tears gathered in Sam's eyes and he dropped to his knees with Gabe. "Gabe, I love you so, so much. Of course, I'll marry you."
Leaning over, Gabriel stole a kiss from Sam. "I think we should spend some one on one time with our brothers." He touched Sam's ring, glancing at his brother in hopes that he would get the hint.
Watching Cas with the horse, Dean definitely wanted to go for a ride. He bit his lip nodding. He wasn't
Dean nodded as he looked around the immaculate grounds- it was obvious that Gabriel had hired someone to care for them, as well as a maid for the house. Hell, Dean didn't blame him. Fuck knew that he would in the same situation. "So's Sam. He's so fucking smart- and he cares more than anyone that I know. Everything he does is because of his heart."
Dean took a sip, then offered it to Castiel. He knew he shouldn't, but Castiel had issues with the food, almost like he was afraid that it was drugged. He was just better when Dean tasted it first.
"Sorry, babe. Can't save you from the dorky hat." Dean carefully took the hat. "Let's get you in the wheelchair and then we'll get the hat on."
"Well, we'll make it a goal that we never achieve, then take our time going downstairs... so that I can still suck you off." Gabriel spanked him, then headed for the door.
Dean shook his head, pointing to her. "Do you see her hair? Of course, she's yours. Most babies lose their hair, but nope- Ms. Zeppy has to have gorgeous hair like her Daddy."
Cas sat down with him, laying a hand on Dean’s thigh. “Well... do you remember what we talked about shortly after you presented this stunning gift to me?”
Cas came first, to Dean’s delight. His body tensed and his fingers dug into Dean’s hips as he hoarsely cried out his pleasure.
Sam swallowed hard. "Dad saw Bones and  he..." A lump formed in his throat. "A couple of days later, Dean grabbed me and we made it to Bobby's."
Letting out a moan, Sam laid back and stretched his long legs. Then he gave himself a teasing stroke.
Cas finally noticed him and looked at Dean with teary eyes. There was a half-eaten grilled cheese sandwich in front of him.
Gabriel kissed him, hugging him close. "We should take Tempe out... or something." Outside seemed like a bad idea in this weather. "I think it's hailing."
"Well... all right. Unless Cas hates it. Then we move," Dean said firmly, leaning over to kiss Castiel's temple.
Bobby watched him carefully, hoping that he'd picked properly with the first edition book on literature. He smoothed his fingers over his own box, then grinned as he saw that it was a camera. "This is one of thos- Gabriel, thank you!"
"And... I don't want to have another pup until these ones are at least walking." Gabriel said after a moment, making faces at Benjamin.
Grinning at her, Gabriel pointed his fork at her. "I told you that I could cook. You said something about everything being covered in chocolate."
Gabriel blinked at his brother but chose not to address it. He didn't want to make things worse for Castiel.
"Sounds like we both need one so that I can steal yours when you're using mine." He winked at Castiel, then looked at a long trench coat. "Hmm..."
"I'm really glad that you think that, baby. You make me feel beautiful." Gabriel bit his lower lip, then turned the vibrator on. He cried out, his hips bucking a bit.
"It's just egg noodles in chicken broth... with a little seasoning." Dean set him up with a tray table, then scooped up Elias. "Lunch, buddy?"
Dean shook his head, smiling as he opened his from Gabriel. It was also an I-pad. "Thanks, Gabe, Seriously."
It broke Dean's heart a bit that he was so very upset. There was nothing really he could do to help him.
Gabriel wrapped an arm around Sam's waist, holding him close. Little did he know, but Dean was planning to hug him as well.
"Yes, Cas?" Dean nipped at his throat, then started to rub the juicy berry over the head of Castiel's cock.
Sam cracked up and looked at Gabe. "Bobby has been texting with a mystery person for almost two months now."
"All right. We'll see if you feel up to seeing Zep's picture after, and hearing the heartbeat after." Starting the car, Gabriel looked at Sam. "Buckle in, sweetness."
"How about you and I nap in the car on the way to the hospital?" Bobby smiled, thanking Dean as he set a cup of coffee in front of him.
Gabriel finished the crepe, quickly with cream and berries before he turned to steal a kiss from Sam. "I felt the same. It's..."
Gabriel waited for him to slip from the room before he grabbed Castiel's hand. "So what happened in the kitchen? He's been snuggling you even more- and he kissed your hair-"
"...That's awesome." Cupping Sam's face, Gabriel kissed him softly before tucking his face into Sam's neck.
“You’re the professor, I’m a student trying not to fail your class.” His next breath was sharp when he felt Gabe’s dick. “But I would probably get too into it and cry.”
Ellen pulled out a card for the bar, watching the pair of them. They seemed a natural fit. "Here, Castiel- You just give me a call and we'll set something up."
"I know, buddy." Dean sat on the edge of the bed, petting each of the sweet dogs that had torn John Winchester to shreds. "We get to love him while he sleeps." For now. Until Dean woke up next to his dead- he cut the train of thought off.
The basement where he was kept reeked of blood, urine, and fear. His existence as an omega was pure torture, and he just wanted it to be over. He was little more than a hole and he wished for the day when an alpha would go too far and steal the breath from him.
Charlie burst out laughing at the sight of the feisty Meg pinned beneath Remy. “Serves you right, Meg-pie.”
Dean was definitely blushing now. There was no denying it. Castiel's wife was hot as hell, but... was this cheating?
"Good." Stealing a kiss, Dean pressed a coin into Castiel's hand. "Here, gorgeous. Make a wish. I already know mine." He shot him a wink, looking at the fountain.
"I... that's... I didn't know it was possible to feel this way." Dean bit his lips, staring at his cards. "Er... got an ace?"
"I just... pay attention," Dean said as he picked up a grey tiger, then snuggled against his mate. "Man, look at this kitten, Castiel?" He held it up with a grin.
"Good boy. Inside, and undress. Put your clothing in the hamper and then kneel at the foot of the bed." Tugging at Sam's hair, he made a pleased sound as Sam reacted.
Sam reached out and cupped Gabe’s cheek. “When I was cleaning Cherry...I wanted to touch myself for you.”
That night, Cas groggily stirred after being sedated to help him sleep. When he remembered what happened, he tensed in Dean’s arms.
Sam ventured over to the freezer and opened it. His brow furrowed as he looked inside. "Snickers...ice cream?"
Panting for a long moment, Gabriel watched him closely. "I love you so much, Samshine." He missed him so damn much…
Given the chaos of my life right now, I just noticed it didn't post all of the chapter. I'm so sorry, I'm working on editing the next chapter now.
Castiel nuzzled Dean's neck, his eyes barely open. "Never felt so good," he murmured, enjoying Dean's tender touch.
Shaking her head, Meg sighed, moving over to the bed. "You need to move so I can check lover boy over." She poked his shoulder.
"Mm... I suppose it does." Opening the door on the Impala, Dean stepped back so that Castiel could get in, then hurried around to his door. It wasn't a date, Winchester. Friends don't do that.
“A long time,” he answered simply. While the goal of fostering was to reunite the children with their parents, he had little hope for that goal with Emma and her brothers.
Gabriel wasn't avoiding Sam Winchester- he just never happened to be around when he was over the next while. He was busy, after all, with his gaming buddy, Ash, researching Jim Daniels and who exactly he was. It was his lunch break, and he poked in to catch Dean and Castiel alone, with the pair having a conversation with looks alone, as they had for much of their relationship. It fascinated Gabriel. "Hey, guys. How are we doing today? I have real food being delivered." Including a salad for Sam. Thankfully, Castiel was able to eat a normal diet, if carefully.
“No, you’re not. But if it makes you feel better, we aren’t spending my money. It’s my family’s and they make millions every month.”
The babies only woke a couple of times during the night, and Castiel was able to sleep through the soft cries while Dean tended to their boys.
"I am all right. We didn't get that much to set up... did we?" Honestly, she'd lost track of what all he'd put in the cart or had her look at.
Cas blinked twice again, but his eyes were watery. He wanted nothing more than to curl up in Dean’s arms and hide from all of this.
He looked at her over his shoulder, a smirk tilting his lips. "What makes you think that I've done anything, loveling?"
"So how do we find him? We don't have a clue." The elder Winchester asked after a moment. Fuck, this was the best he'd seen Sam since it happened.
"Do you want another finger, Cas? Or do you think that you're ready?" Dean swallowed his cock again, making a pleased noise.
"Yep. Now she's ready for her treat, Cassie." Gabriel laughed, but then Athena was growling, running to look out the window by the door.
Sam slid his hand into Gabe’s and grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair. As he slid it on his arm, he heard a distinct rip. “Oh, not again...”
"Of course I do. Didn't I warn you about that before?" Dean teased him, running his fingers through the older man's hair. "I'm a bit selfish. I like knowing that you're mine."
Pressing his face into the bed for a moment, Dean made himself breath. "How's it feel, Cas?" He knew how overwhelming it could be, how perfect- how that feeling of connection just seemed to complete you.
Laughing, Sam opened the box and turned the headphones on, grateful when he realized they were already charged. He turned the phone on and connected the headphones to the phone wirelessly. Then he pulled up the playlist of all of Dean’s music he had already downloaded. Once it started, he handed the headphones to Dean.
"Uh uh... I'm awake." Dean pushed his hand away, then leaned down to suck Castiel's cock into his mouth.
"Because when we got there, the son of a bitch, Zachariah, Gabriel's ex, was injecting him in the neck with what we know now is Talwin or Pentazocine. The needle was damn close to his jugular, and it looked pretty fucking bad because it ripped the skin." Dean squeezed Castiel tight, rubbing his shoulder gently. "It was bad. He fell back, he looked dead, and I rushed over to take care of him and Sam beat the son of a bitch's face in."
Sighing shakily, Sam had to resist the urge to hug Gabe again. Instead, he went to the next beautiful arrangement.
Gabriel raced after Sam into the kitchen, cheering as he caught up with them. Beaming, he pulled Sam down into a kiss.
"Mm-hmm... It's just something I was thinking about..." Castiel closed his own eyes and draped his leg over Dean's.
Guests began to arrive, and Gabriel took a deep breath as he looked at his husband. "We're going to have a baby. Holy shit."
"I will even light a fire in the fireplace," Gabriel assured him, reaching for a blanket to hand Sam to wrap in. "I can get you another one, Cas, unless you want to share."
Fuck, he was in trouble. Castiel knew exactly what he was doing to him, and damn if it didn't make him whimper. Being claimed like this did something primal to him, and he hated every inch of fabric between them. "Cas..."
“Hey.” She sat down beside him and squeezed his hand tight. “I’m here for you. So is Dorothy. Not going anywhere.”
Cas squeezed his hand tight. “Can I see our room?” He tangled his fingers in Athena’s fur with his other hand as he walked.
"Of course." Cas turned off the lamp and curled into his brother. "I am looking forward to tomorrow."
Smiling a bit, Castiel made a mental note of it. They’d have to try this again. “That makes me so happy, sweetheart.”
Gabriel moved to get his plate, grinning as he saw the hot cocoa. "You love me!" Picking up the cup, he took a sip.
The doctor frowned a bit, moving to check her over. She shouldn't be dealing with this much pain- but at this point, it was too damn close to the delivery to do much about it.
"We'll get everything sorted, grab the essentials and be at the airport in an hour." Dean kissed Castiel's hair m, nudging him up. "Gabriel's got memories here, Ferg. I want it boxed up and sent to where we're going."
Laughing a little, Gabriel slid a hand around Sam's waist, then tugged him towards the bedroom. "Sleep for you, pup."
"That works, bud. That's... hell, Sammy, if you don't blow this dude, I might." Dean told him with a bit of a smirk, entirely amused.
“That’s… what an asshole. I’m glad he didn’t win.” Sam came up behind Gabe and peered over his shoulder.
"Do I?" Unable to help himself, Dean made a soft sound, rolling his hips. "And you feel so fucking good touching me."
"That's it, sweetness. I need to clean the wounds, okay? That will hurt, but it's step one of getting rid of the infection. Cas, can you hold his hand so that if I hurt him, he's got something to hold onto?" Gabriel asked, steeling himself for what he was about to have to do. He slipped on a pair of gloves, then turned to grab what he needed to clean the debris away- he wasn't sure how it got there- and for his own sanity, didn't want to know. That probably made him a monster, but if Sam was his... he didn't have time to think about that. Right now, he had to make him better.
Sam straightened up and obediently went to his lover’s office. As soon as he stepped inside, he practically felt Gabe’s presence. Everything in the room had Gabe’s touch and it was oddly soothing to him. He retrieved the lube and set it on the edge of the desk as Gabe had ordered.
“Professor mills called on you, now unless you’re too busy...” he gestured down at deans phone with a wink
Dean nodded as he headed to take a seat somewhere near the middle of the auditorium. Jody Mills was his film teacher, and probably the only reason he wasn’t bored out of his mind. She treated him like a son, and he saw her as a mother figure. She always made her classes so interactive, engaging and interesting that dean couldn’t help but focus.
Winchester Pharmaceuticals. The company his grandfather, Henry Winchester, had built from the ground up. He died before he could meet his grandkids, but left behind a son, who (gauging from what dean had heard about Henry) was nothing like his father. Where Henry was kind, John was cruel. Where Henry cared about the well being of other people, John cared only about money and himself.

“Yeah, I know. Donna suggested it to me and it sounds like it was meant to be. Unless I find one even more fitting, that’s what it’ll be called”
He got out of bed, grabbed a white t-shirt, a blue suit and blue pants. He headed into the shower and the hot water made him want to get back in bed. “Cmon man, pull it together” he grumbled to himself. “It’s a big day her, for the company, and for you.”
He fell out of his stupor and realised that he had to talk to professor Mills. Fuck he’d nearly forgotten. Thank god for Benny bringing him back to reality.
“Dean?... oh, he oldest Winchester brother? Cas didn’t know him, but hell, right now he seemed like the most important man on the face of the earth.
Fuck. She noticed. And by the looks of it, she also noticed the blush slowly creeping across deans cheeks.
He wondered what she wanted to talk to him about. He’d heard a rumour that she was directing a movie based on the Medusa myth but told in a modern way. Maybe she would ask him to help her with it? Probably not, dean wasn’t even the best student in the class. But what else could it be?
His thoughts were interrupted as the car in front of him slowly started moving forward. “Finally” he muttered, shutting off the music, and putting his foot on the gas.
dean smacked his arm but didn’t say anything as professor mills was approaching the dais, about to start class.
“When you’re born, there plays a song. A song that stays with you throughout your life, it evolves, grows and changes as you do. It has its highs and it has its lows. It has times when you can barely hear the melody and times when the melody is all you can hear. It has beauty, colour, grief, tragedy, joy, fear, love and everything else that life does. It’s idiosyncratic, you write it, you sing it. make yours beautiful Dean. Make it beautiful.”
The pair walked to Cas’ office, and as Cas was almost finishing his croissant Eileen said, “so, you remember Sam right?”
“YOU'RE THE ONE WHO BURNT YOUR TONGUE AND HE SAW AND NOW YALL ARE GOING ON A DATE. NOW YOU BLAME ME?”
As he walked toward her, he caught sight of a tall, muscular, dark haired man standing not too far behind her, talking to a nurse.
“Okay, hey! Maybe it’ll be fun.” Cas knew he’d hate every second of it, but seeing the pleading look on Eileen’s face, he agreed.
He plopped down on his couch, a coffee in his hand. This time he blew in it a few times before he took a sip.
“Could you repeat it, please?” He said sheepishly and tried with his whole being to pay attention to what the professor was saying. He only registered some parts.
Today was different though. He was headed to NYMH to sign off on a 5 million dollar neural drug deal. Neuraforte, the groundbreaking drug Winchester Pharma had come out with had the potential to help millions of patients around the world. He was filling in for Adam, who was occupied with a last moment press conference, and he was also going to be visiting the hospital very frequently over the next few weeks, to view the results of their drug firsthand.  Eileen Leahy, cardiothoracic surgeon extraordinaire and also chief of surgery at NYMH, had approached Dean directly about the drug as soon as he had told her about it, and New York mercy was going to be one of the first hospitals in the world to start using it.
Dean was glad he’d found this place. It wasn’t too fancy, but it reminded him of home and oh, how he missed home. Sammy, Ellen, Jo, Bobby, Charlie and even Anael. He didn’t have a lot of time to think about them though, most of his time was spent on his projects for the University. Not that he was complaining. A 75% scholarship to the University of Paris where he could study films and filmmaking? It wasn’t something he would pass up easily. At first he’d been a bit reluctant to leave Sammy, but Ellen and Bobby more than assured him that he’d be well looked after, to quote Bobby “the kid’s gonna be fine dean, now you get your ass to Paris and you make us proud.” Dean trusted Ellen and Bobby more than himself, so he knew Sam would be just fine. And anyway, it’s not like Sam would just let him not go.
Cas hummed along, letting his mind water to things he usually didn’t waste time thinking about. What would it be like to be in love? To experience the euphoria Taylor sang about, firsthand? To dance with someone in the rain, to give them everything, and still want to give them more? Who knows? Maybe his ‘Prince Charming’ was out there. Prince Charming. A child’s concept. Cas almost burst out laughing. It was all so stupid, he’d believe in it once he’d experienced it. Until then love could take a backseat.
The very thought of him made Deans skin crawl. After his mother, Mary, had died, dean practically raised his kid brother Sam. When John married Kate Milligan, Dean was 6 and Sam was 2. With the arrival of Kate, things did change a bit and a few years later, Adam came along. Not soon after though, Kate got sick, really, really sick and she didn’t make it through. Things went back to the way they were before, except now Dean had to raise two kids despite being a kid himself. Dean didn’t mind though, he adored his brothers.
“You bet,” Dean said, returning the laugh. “It’s like, anytime I mention Lawrence to anyone here, they always think I’m talking about a person!”
• “non juste parce que tu n'as pas de butin ne veut pas dire que je ne peux pas non plus” ~ “no, just because you don’t have swag doesn’t mean that I can’t either.”
He pulled up into the hospital parking lot, glancing at his watch. 10:20 am, New York traffic could suck it. He all but ran through the front door, where Eileen was waiting for him, furious. She was a surgeon who saved lives, she was engaged to Sammy, she couldn’t kill him right? ….right? The look on her face suggested otherwise.
He was hungry, but in his hurry to leave and the general excitement that hung in the air, he’d forgotten to eat. Shrugging, he got into his car. He’d just grab a bite at the hospital. His watch read 8:15am and he desperately hoped he wouldnt be greeted by traffic on the way. Naturally, the traffic was worse than it usually was. Cas was annoyed. And bored out of his mind. Keeping one hand on the wheel, he decided to put the radio on. He very rarely played music while he drove ( because he had seen firsthand what accidents that could cause) but since, by the looks of it, he was going to be stuck here for a while, why not?
Cas: I know we just met, but I asked you out because you’re cute and funny and interesting and I want to get to know you better. Is that enough or should I go on?
“Also, one more thing before you go. You seemed a bit distracted in class today. Is everything okay?”
“Oh my god. YES. Please tell me you’ve watched the last ship too?!” came the dark-haired boy's reply, more excited than ever.
“I can’t believe this. All these years of friendship and you’ve only been plotting to get me a boyfriend.”
A smirk crept onto the dark-haired boys face again. “So where are you from in the states? I’m from Lawrence, Kansas.” he said.
Typical Charlie, always so enthusiastic and intuitive. More than deans best friend, deans little sister.
“You should get going now, I’m pretty sure Mr Lafitte and miss Talbot are waiting for you.” She said with a chuckle.
sorry if this ones a bit of a drag, I wrote this on 3 hours of sleep. not that much deancas but they go on a date in the next chapter!! It’s super cute I can’t wait to start writing it, but till then enjoy :)
He rummaged through his bag and brought out a piece of paper and a pen. After scribbling something on it, he handed it to Dean.
Halfway through school, he knew that film and filmmaking was what he wanted to study but he never expected to be able to come to Paris and do it. On his first day, he was nervous but the many faces and people in the auditorium, who were as foreign to this new world as he was, gave him a sense of security. He just didn’t want the teacher to be boring, he didn’t want to hate the subject he loved because of the way he was taught it.
“Be out in a bit.” Came Deans reply as he headed toward out the auditorium and to professor Mills’ office.
“Of course, how could I forget your fiancé! How is he?” Cas asked, swallowing down the last of his meal.
Eileen was frantically texting him, he was just about to reply when he was interrupted by a face time call.
