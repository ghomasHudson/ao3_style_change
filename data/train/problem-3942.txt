In the image he’s wearing a brown ochre body suit with a high neck, sleeves that cut just above halfway of his arm, and gold piping. At the center of his chest is a circle made out of five adjacent bars. His combat boots look exactly like his father’s but with the same ochre hue of his suit. His mask is a simple single golden bar that ran across his face, hugging the contour of his face.
Rider begins chanting and his eyes become pitch black once more as wounds from countless unknowable fights appear on his skin.
“Dean, someone just killed himself,” Castiel reminds him.
Jack basked in the ghostly light from the glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling of his room. He stared at the large Star Wars logo at the center of the stickers above him, a franchise he loved from his parents’ time. Dinner earlier was fun and it wasn’t often his dads reminisced about their past. Uncle Sam said that the world wasn’t kind to his dads growing up. He knew from his History classes that the world then wasn’t at all kind to people like him and his dads, to women like auntie Rowena, to uncle Rufus personally.
“Yes, they were,” he shrugs. “Do you forgive me, brother?”
Luckily then, Sam was in a court hearing and Eileen was out of the country, because Styne had brought an entire strike force with him. Despite holding their own, they were slowly overwhelmed. Dean managed to kill Styne’s cousin and right-hand man, Roscoe, but that prompted Styne to use enough tranqs that could knock down an elephant on Dean. The last thing he saw and heard was Styne seeing Charlie and told his men to take her as well.
“Hello, I’m Jack. And you’re Rowena MacLeod! Dad, it’s the Queen of the Damned!” Jack says, almost jumping in excitement before taking his seat beside his father.
“Sleep well, kid.” And with that, Dean left and closed the door behind him.
Claire insisted on dropping Jack off to school using Castiel’s car, the tan Lincoln they affectionately called the
“So is it a date?” Jack asked seemingly out of nowhere.
“Okay, I understand,” Sam folds his laptop and walks away, “Just don’t do anything like this again.”
“Who knew that helmet hid such a pretty face eh, Cassie?” Gabriel quips.
Dinner was over and the kids were watching some new series from Netflix in the living room. Lisa had left to spend the rest of the night with some of her friends and Dean and Castiel agreed to drive her to where they would meet up.
The Golem gently drops the rifles on to the floor and begins rushing towards the woman. Aaron tells it to stop because they don’t know who or what the woman exactly is. But he is shocked to find the Golem laugh and give the woman a tight hug and raise her from the floor. He had never seen this behavior from the Golem before.
Angel arrives somewhere on the 10
parks Baby in the Bunker’s garage and listens to himself breathe for a moment. He no longer has his helmet on and he lets the sweat trickle down on to the bridge of his nose from his ash blond hair.
“Hey, dude!” Ben greeted him, a bro hug immediately followed.
The previous War was an anomaly. Each of the Servants summoned were Grand-class Servants; the ones at the pinnacle of their class. They said that the Grand Servants can only be summoned if any of the Beasts of Calamity are present and pose a threat to Human Order. And that most definitely happened.
“I would've made them for you anyway,” he squeezes her shoulder as he makes his way to the refrigerator. He pulls out a pitcher of lemonade and takes a glass from the drying rack.

“I thought
“Why didn’t you?”
They offered her a home-cooked meal. And who was she to refuse the offer? She had been surviving off of instant ramen and crackers for the past two months.
Charlie hears wings flapping and there's a strong gust of wind. She suddenly finds herself in Dean's arms with him saying that she's safe. In between her and her Servant were familiar broad shoulders and trench coat. “Cas?” she says weakly.
Jack spins and spreads his wings out. All while his father takes pictures on his personal phone.
“that he plans to take up Creative Writing in college,” the older brunette said.
“D’yah really mean that?” There was a subtle worry in Jesse’s voice.
He just notices that there's no longer a green light on the rooftop.
“Thank you—” Angel cuts the man short by knocking him unconscious right after saving him.
The girl—Charlie wraps him in a big hug which he immediately returns. “Hi, I’m Charlie. Which you probably heard Gabe say. And you’re Jack! You’re one of Castiel’s kids! Will Claire be here? Wait, will she bring her girlfriend with her? I’ve always wanted to meet them! Do you and Claire have powers like your dad? Boy, you do look a lot like Cas—”
“Yes, really!” And then they zap out of the park, their sudden disappearance rustling the loose rocks and dirt.
Kaia was cutting up some carrots when she heard her girlfriend walk in. “You mean

suit down to the Garrison yesterday. So why not make a second stop. And don’t worry. Seems like your dad still doesn’t know a thing.”
“I will never—Not once in my life—will I ever think that the brother I want back is the version of my brother who killed innocents, who almost killed his own—”
Sam scoffs at his brother, “You were comatose for two days and told me to pretend you still were when we got home from the hospital.”
When Dean got out of the shower, he hears voices. Sam’s people must already be in the war room. He makes his way to his room and puts on his uniform, helmet and all. He straps his knife to his waist just in case these coppers decide to turn on them. Unlikely, because with Sam’s magic around the Bunker, any agreement or contract, is legally and metaphysically binding. But he won’t take any chances, Styne once did break through all of their defenses and warding.
“You know her?!” Aaron asks his Golem. He stares at the woman they just saved and she looks as confused as he was.
Ben jumped onto the sofa, his feet raised to the armrest at its sides, knowing his brother liked to sit on the floor. “Nice.”
Some codenames are given based on deeds. He thinks of the Supervillain
(Bobby Singer),
Ben sits up straight and puts his phone down on the bedside table, “Coming with me and finding out one of the Masters is a comatose patient.”
The long haired boy stepped closer, “The weekend then?”
Angel walks closer, taking cautious steps, one hand tentatively raised. “I’m here to bring you to safety.”
“Yup! My brother has rubbed off on you,” Sam laughs again. “He’s serious about this being a ‘Family business.’ So, when I said you were like a daughter to him, that was true. Cas or no Cas, kicking him in the nuts was the right thing to do.”
“Where are you going?” Kaia asked.
“Rowena?” Jack squawks more than he asks, the other two people in the room look at him, “You know the
“Hey! Food’s ready!” she hears Dean calling. She stands up, makes her way to their room to wake Kaia up.
Hello, guys! This is the last chapter that focuses on one specific Servant and the last "short" chapter. After this, the action will finally move further along with longer chapters and insights on the Grand Grail War!
Powerful spells or weapons in a Servant’s arsenal that represent their deeds in life. Some have many and some only have one, regardless of quantity, each Noble Phantasm will turn the tide of battle.
“It is not of import,” Cas says in his menacing Angel voice. “We want to know why you kidnapped him a second time.”
with the Hunter?
Jack ordered nachos. Large and with additional bacon bits. Sam said they would be paying.
“It caught me off-guard,” Jesse admits. He isn't particularly squeamish, but he doesn't believe in attacking people who are unable to defend themselves. Call it principle, but he's been hunted down from Nebraska to Sydney to Timbuktu, he knows the feeling of being helpless in situations never in his favor.
“Hey, gen-Xers. What is it?”
Kaia looks at Claire. When she gets confirmation, “Yeah sure. Lemme just get my computer.”
Sam clears his throat, “So get this,” he stops when the two Servants laugh. Those three words have been Sam’s catchphrase for the past two and a half decades. He elects not to exercise his annoyance and continues, “I was barely in my 20s when the previous War happened, kinda the same age as you.”
Jesse just points towards the hospital where a green light can be seen pulsing on the rooftop. Ben's jaw drops and he shakes his head in disbelief, “I thought this was just a lead.”
Then the large steel door opens with a metallic whine that only unoiled hinges bring. On the other side stands a tall foreboding man, with high cheekbones and an as deep brow. His long sienna hair collects neatly on his nape.
be clueless.
A few minutes later, the loading bay in their base lights up and Castiel drops in from the tunnel. The first thing he does is take off his visor, the artificial light of the base almost blinding him.
Charlie averts her gaze. “Well, we didn’t know Dean and Valentine would show up,” she says. “Kevin, what do we know of Valentine and the Hunter’s relationship?”
Of course, she’s talking about
Dean, with all his signature smugness when he was living, cocks his eyebrows, “What do you think?”
He checks his wrist watch.
Counter Force - The fundamental governing force on Earth that makes sure of the preservation of the Human Order.
The Bunker is… literally a bunker. But it wasn’t made by doomsday preppers, but by a group of academics and mages that called themselves the Men of Letters. And Sam is a Legacy, a descendant of one of its esteemed members. That’s why he inherited this particular chapter house in the heart of Lebanon, Kansas. It contained various magical tomes and artifacts, records of mage families, and the world’s largest collection of supernatural and paranormal knowledge.
“Yeah, right,” she scoffs at him. “He just wants to get in my dad’s pants.”
“I think we need to talk,” Jody said from the living room entrance. Claire carefully put the picture back and steeled herself. Then Jody clapped her hands, “But first: dinner!”
“Feeling the years piling up, Jody?” Claire quipped.
“They’re bringing Eldon Styne with them,” Sam says, throwing Dean his pillow, leaving the room.
Kaia mistakenly enters the library, eyes glued to her phone, and takes a seat on one of the tables. It takes her a moment to realize that there are other people in the Bunker. Dean raises his brows at her in disbelief. Then she quickly makes her exit.
rifles through the files that his father asked from Charlie yesterday. Down in the Garrison, Charlie was providing surveillance and Rowena and Gabriel discuss what Crowley knows.
Claire left Lancer a change of clothes she took from Kaia's apartment. She was functionally the same as her girlfriend except for their experiences and personalities. Her Kaia is reserved and creative, while Lancer was forward and pragmatic. She was thankful for that. She didn't have to experience all those misplaced feelings for body doubles she'd read in fanfiction from when she was a teenager.
Dean continued. “And me having a kid would only make your stupid hair messier than it regularly was,” he told Castiel.
and you
Jack’s smile breaks and he can see his Servant sending him silent apologies.
“Don’t forget your wings!” his father reminds him.
His dad took the seat across from him, mug in hand and a proud smile on his face. “Jesse making you feel all the good things right off the bat huh?” Dean said as he sipped his coffee.
Despite the asinine script, literal darkness when watching, and the ridiculousness of trying to pass 20-somethings as teenagers, Jack unironically enjoyed the show. The character Joaquin’s hair even reminded him of—
is perched on a skyscraper in Chicago, in complete uniform, overlooking Lake Michigan. High above the city line there is nothing to distract from his view of distant forests and land formations that fade into an obscure desaturated blue. Whatever things fly in the air and whichever clouds drift past his line of sight merely enhance this literal breathtaking experience. Each fleeting figure a twist in the kaleidoscope, an unknowable pattern tessellating into the infinite.
” Or the (wannabe) hero Marv Secretary calling himself
in the dungeon just finished. They got what they needed, well, at least relevant information, and Castiel immediately makes his way.
“Who is that?” Jack cuts off his father.
“You called?” Jesse materializes at the backseat, leaning forward, making Ben jump and drop the used tissue paper.
“I thought differently and I didn’t have powers. That’s why I became a lawyer,” Sam coos. “Not that that stopped Dad. But Dean—Dean inherited mom’s strength, so he trained. Probably thought he’d be the Hunter after dad retired but then Yellow Eyes killed him. Dean was furious and it, in a way, desensitized him to violence.
are making dinner,” Kaia clarified.
Five plates filled with eggs, bacon, and pancakes appear on the tabletop.
Sam clears his throat loudly and it catches their attention. “That’s what they’re here to find out,” Sam nods to FBI agent Victor Henriksen and his five—
“I guess that’s complicated too,” Jack tilted his head a little, brows furrowed.
Ben laughed, suppressed and muffled because of the spoon halfway through his mouth. He chewed a few seconds before speaking. “Geez, dad. When the lesbians take notice—”
He then goes to stand beside Cas and put his arms around his shoulder. Cas hasn’t made his wings go away yet so Dean’s careful not to put much weight on him. He wiggles his eyebrows at Cas who’s scowling at him, still hasn’t moved on from the fact that his daughter is in the Bunker.
“Clive, go check on mom!” Charlie tells him, her eyes never leaving the man and woman. Clive runs as fast as he could to the room at the far-end of the floor.
“Okay, sis,” Ben pouted. “See you this weekend?”
“Can you please stop doing that?” his younger brother asks as he throws the helmet and the blade onto the table.
“Oh, my God!” Jack shouts earning them looks from the other patrons and the waitress pointing to a “Keep Quiet” sign. “Sorry,” Jack contains himself. “It’s just that the last Holy Grail War was legendary! All of the Servants were Grand-class. And you, Sam, you were partnered with Samuel Colt. My studies in the Clocktower said that he became Grand when Orion surrendered the title in order to help Chaldea restore the Human Order. People called it the Grand Grail War. Which is weird because Grand Servants can only be summoned when one of the Beasts of Calamity—” Jack muttered to himself and only stopped when Berserker places a placating hand on his shoulder.
city? I can’t just let him run free. He’s been on the run for too damn long!”
Gabriel takes a sip from the tumbler on his side of the control board. “Loud and clear, Angel. Visuals on ground zero confirmed,” he declares.
“Oh yeah?” Jesse says, “What’s an aspiring hero like you afraid of?”
Aaron’s now standing at an alley at the building right next to the factory. He’s wearing a pitch black body suit that contained mystic codes—magic—to conceal his presence and protect him. And at the unlikely event the magic was nullified, it was outfitted with Kevlar and sound dampeners.
In over a decade, not much has changed in their living room. The same old beaten couch and patched up armchairs arranged in a U in front of the fireplace. The same display case in the far corner, right of the window, filled with his father’s chachkies. The same framed pictures of his and Claire’s moms above the hearth. Even the coffee table (whose middle was split but now filled with resin) is still the same.
His powers might’ve been affected by whatever Frankenstein injected him.
“Hello, Mr. Winchester!” Jesse said, offering an informal salute to the man who was… oddly wearing a trench coat. Or was it an overcoat?
“Yes, I do know that,” the wood nymph answers. “Remember, I
He takes his first tentative step on the front porch.
“Sure it can. Ain’t no nail on my back yet.”
“Five dollars for four!” he exclaims. One carrot almost falls to the floor but he manages to bend backward quick enough that his forearm catches it. “Whoops!” he says, laughing breathily.
He gets off the seesaw and struggles a bit since he was
“Whatever you said, online forums now call you:
He brought up the idea while Eliot Ness watched them argue in amusement.
“That’s a fun memory,” Jack chimed in.
Singer Auto used to be an old auto-repair garage and scrapyard. Back in the 20
He nods furiously. And then he goes off to list all the ways he has prepared himself for this day. Never stopping even if his uncle Gabriel just zaps in with bed hair, half-naked and initially unaware of the disappointed look on Castiel’s face.
“She didn’t ask me out,” Jack said flatly and everyone was laughing again.
Well, that was until he (like her dad) bit it. It felt like another part of her died when he passed. Another person that this hospital's lifeless corridors reminded her she had lost.
He was a vampire and Dean’s best friend long before his career as the Hunter. But the entire Incident messed him up. Benny had told Dean that he wanted to die but he can’t muster up the strength to kill himself. So, he threw himself in harm’s way. And when his survival instincts always got in the way, he realized being reckless wasn’t enough. So, he gave into his instincts and left a trail of blood-drained bodies in his wake, hoping someone competent enough would catch up. And somebody did, two people actually, Dean and Cas. Neither knew that the other was also investigating Benny, and they both kept their own teams in the dark as to what they were doing. Neither wanted to put an end to Benny but they knew he needed to be stopped. Benny thanked both of them before Dean cut off his head with his Knife as Cas stood there unable to watch.
1. I interpreted the Heavenly Host as a family of heroes and Superheroes. And I chose illinois as their home-state because that is where Jimmy Novak comes from.
Clive unloads the contents of the bags on the kitchen table and Charlie puts them in their proper homes. “You look for your glasses while you still have them on,” she teases him.
It’s 6AM the next day.
Gabriel turns to look at his younger brother as he pours himself some coffee. “Oh, I heard Jack bring home a friend last night and I figured I’d do the same,” he explains.
The other boy looked away from the camera a moment, biting his lips so the kilig he was feeling was contained.
Castiel surrenders, “Okay, Claire. I trust your judgment.”
“Speaking of Cas…” Sam eyes the blade and the helmet, “Where’s the grenade launcher.”
“Hey, Angel!” Demoness calls out. “Let’s check on your kid.” he feels her mind lift him up the ground and they float back to Jack’s location. “Thank God I asked to be transferred here.”
“That's my dad,” Claire muttered under breath.
Part 2 is a little longer than the previous one. Well, it is a chapter that's titled "World Building," go figure.
They both turn around when they hear a robust accent fill the room. “Hey, Jack. Auntie Rowena felt a presence enter the house. Was that yo—”
Eliot Ness was a miserable man. To say the least. When they summoned him he was furious. He kept saying that he was content to remain in the Throne of Heroes and had no plans
but here he is, thrust back into it.
He closes his eyes again and visualizes his own house. He breathes in deep and he vanishes. When he opens his eyes a second time around, he’s right back in this stranger’s living room.
.” From Sam’s stories their paternal grandfather Henry Winchester was the
Castiel raises both brows at him, always teetering on the edge of displeasure with his brother. “And who might this friend be, Gabriel?” he asks.
Unwanted memories resurfaced yesterday. It is days like this that Castiel wishes he could just go fly to the Bunker and nestle with Dean in his quarters and ignore the rest of the world. Surrender to his desires for once. But he had no idea where the Bunker actually is, and actively avoids asking Charlie
The young Winchester smiled at the thought of his first date with the other boy.
the Second Grail War for my Master: Mr. Sinclair. He was good friends with your great grandfather, you know?” Mrs. Butters adds after a brief pause, looking at the photo of the Men of Letters first introduced to her. “But! You still need to be in tip-top shape to fight the other Servant-Master pairs.”
She stares at him, waiting for a response until he realizes he needs to talk to answer. “Ah, no. It was that guy over there,” he provides, pointing towards Eckhart’s remains.
“On it!” Charlie says before Castiel could even finish.
“I had to, Sam. He was—” Dean stops mid-sentence. Then he stares up, nowhere in particular, but up. And he walks forward slowly, passing Sam and he quickens his pace as he nears the stairs and runs up to the door that leads to the stairwell outside.
Berserker hums, biting his lower lip and then let goes. “I doubt I’ve ever been observed as a Servant. I was put into the Throne of Heroes fairly recently. Just around two decades ago as a matter of fact,” he says as such an aside that Jack is taken aback. “But then again, I shouldn’t remember any previous summonings.”
“Of course, I know who my brother is. Fucki—” Styne doesn’t get to finish. The FBI agent punches him on the cheek and he spits out blood.
He can find out later. Right now, he closes his eyes, then, he vanishes.
“Are we expecting royalty, Gabriel?” Castiel, blasé, asks.
“And you must be Cas’s, boy!” the man says in a gruff baritone that Jack expected from a seasoned and always (reported) drunk ex-Superhero.
Styne, bloodied from the torture, face riddled with defeat, holds one of the dead officer’s guns.
His grandparents were ecstatic when he video-called them earlier to show his Command Spells. They wanted nothing more than for Jack to get what he wants in life. And he wants nothing more than to be able to meet his parents. And the wish granting machine called the Greater Grail could give him that.
Gadreel marches towards the ledge and sits beside him. “I believe the phrase is “No names on the field,” brother,” they both laugh. “Your words, Castiel,” he says to him, a twitch upwards ghosting his lips.
When Vader’s helmet got struck, his right eye exposed for all the world to see, Jack imagined his eyes glowing as well.
Gabriel looks at Charlie, whose eyes are fixed on the screen. He then brings out a laser pointer and motions at the bright purple silhouette that bursts orange every now and then, “You see that?”
“I am sorry to disappoint you,” Castiel says.
The barrier crackles and then fades away. Styne falls lifeless to the floor, right beside the small iron ball that fell out of him. The miniscule piece of iron smokes intensely and a single rune glows hot for a few seconds.
“Thank you,” he mutters under his breath.
“My one and only,” Gabriel chimes in, wiggling his eyebrows as boldly as he could.
“You’re Rider!” Eileen shouts excitedly, not bothering to speak in ASL.
Jack inspects the man, eyes squinting and his head tilting a little to the side. It doesn’t seem to register to him that the man is doing the same.
He needs to summon his Servant soon, or else, one of the other Master’s will find him and make short work of his 6’4” frame.
city, to
Aaron downs the rest of his coffee and throws the paper cup into the bin behind the chair he was on. He’s hoping that disappointing his ancestors is all worth it.
The Golem throws him mocking laughter, “Your forefathers are now rolling in their graves.”
Jack hesitates because he knows the answer, “For what?”
Jack sighed, “Jesse, I am not one of those people.”
Not-Golden Boy thinks for a moment. “Well, I want to show off my wings like dad.”
playing Westview down under,” Dean says, cupping his mouth with one hand.
She then falls on her back. When she raised her knee to Dean’s side, he bent lower and grabbed at it. Then he body-slammed her on the floor. By the benches, Kaia laughs hard, apparently catching everything on video. “I am
“Come on, babe,” he says, grinning. “It’s your first time here,” then he kisses Cas’s temple.
“Until a contract with you I make,” he finishes his aria.
“Oh, god. What would Jack and dad think if they knew I was training to be the next Hunter,” Claire says, mostly to herself.
Lisa’s eyes widened. “Okay! Story time,” she said.
Dean kicks the chair beside him. “If Cas wasn’t there, I would’ve cut off that son of a bitch’s head.”
Jack tilts his head and squints at the denim-wrapped vision in front of him. “I never told you my name,” Jack says, as-a-matter-of-factly.
Kaia chuckles, “I don’t know about, Cas. But Jack would definitely spend most of his time asking to be your sidekick.”
“Yeah, even someone as emotionally constipated as you, Dean.” Sam says which makes everyone else laugh.
“In my head I was like, what does that have to do with anything about us?” said Lisa.
Sam decides to walk away as he says “That was Jesse Turner.”
Gabriel finishes putting together his sandwiches, puts them on a plate, and makes his way past Jack. “Follow me,” he commands his nephew.
The golem walks towards the factory’s back entrance. “As a matter of fact, they do,” says the Golem.
“Why not make a contract with me,” Aaron asks.
Clive takes a seat across from her and pours himself a glass. He sighs, “It's the least I can do, Charlie. I just didn't know what to do. He was gone and suddenly I was—”
“You’re already giving me a suit, old man?” Dean rolls his eyes at her. “I thought you weren’t retiring yet.”
In his peripheral view he sees the other Master’s eyes fixed on him, perplexed. “Is there something wrong?” Jack asks.
Jack looks at the bodies in front of him, utter contempt with himself filling every fiber of his body. From the way the paramedic clutched on to the resident, he could tell that until the end, they were trying to save lives. “If only I was a little faster,” he mutters.
He turned to look at Claire who took her seat on the table beside Dean. “Uhm, rude,” Claire chimed.
“Hey!” Rider protests.
Jack was greeted by Lisa and Ben. He pressed Lisa to his side, hugging her the most the casserole she held allowed him to.
“Back when I was alive, I killed him twice. The second time I got myself killed but I blew him up with his entire ship,” she says as if murder-suicide is a simple matter.
“Hey, padawans,” she said with a shit-eating grin. “Dinner’s ready. Time to take your seat in the Council.”
“Claire, you’re not making things harder for Jody are you?” Dean asked his daughter. Claire sensed an
Jack, still giggling, raised his laptop and faced it towards his bedside. There, sprawled out on the air mattress on the floor was Ben, feet spread apart and his entirety a tangle of blankets, pillows, and limbs.
He shakes himself out of the memory and pulls at all the cords sticking on his body. He stares at the cuff on his right hand and it turns into a periwinkle baller with the phrase “Down Under” in bold white letters. He still has his powers.
“We had just told our parents that I was pregnant. We decided to tell both sets at the same time at Dean’s house. John, your grandfather, told us to go upstairs to Dean’s room so the adults could talk. My mom and Mary gave him a puzzled look,” Lisa said almost giggling at every word, “and then dad raised his voice “It’s not like she can get knocked up while she’s still pregnant!””
The blond laughs, “Kinda?” He stands, looks at the contents of the pitcher and returns it to the fridge, before returning to his seat.
“Oh, no,” Charlie mumbles under her breath, hands covering half her face.
Morning came and Jack woke up feeling more himself than he had ever been. The weekend—
Cas snaps out of his disappointment in Dean, hearing Sam’s words. “You have a dungeon?” he asks, eyes in more shock than curiosity.
“I just remembered something,” she shrugs.
“The building complex from a few days ago was destroyed by pure white light,” Meg says. “Probably by the woman who broke Clarence.”
traumatic for both of them.
He’s not wrong. Dean does feel a little insensitive being reminded as to why they were all together. But it’s been seven years since he and Cas actually sat in a room together this close. It’s always been chance encounters or confrontations in the field.
“Oh” is all Jack says as he bites down on more bacon.
Holy Grail, and set the conditions for the Greater Grail to activate it’s wish-granting abilities,” she says without looking away from the slowly disappearing Arc.
Angel’s eyes widen as Frankenstein and his men open fire at him with their artillery. He shields his face from the barrage, almost pressed deep on his left arm chelidon,  It wouldn’t do any piercing damage but it still hurt. And he doesn’t look forward to possible bruises on his face. Then he feels someone use his inclined back as a ramp and jump towards Frankenstein. He sighs.
He sees Jack knelt in front of the building. As he walks closer, the forms underneath the dust and rubble in front of his son reveal themselves. A paramedic and one of the injured residents were caught in the blast. He puts a hand on Jack’s shoulder.
“Uluru,” he says sitting down. “It’s a sacred place here in the North.”
“Say hello to Jack for me when you get home,” says Gadreel as he jumps down from the building, spreading his four broad wings, flying off to where Charlie would next take him.
Jack’s face was flushed red. The other boy got the reference. He looked at his siblings and Kaia who were focused on the lackluster transformation of one of the characters on screen.
“Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, and Berserker…”
“Hello,” Jack says with his stationary wave, “I’m jack.” He extends his hand to Charlie and she shakes it. “Uhm, I’m not sure about Claire and Kaia, they’re not in the country... And yes and no!”
He was caught unaware when a medium built young man tackled him. With a hug. “I missed you!” the young man says.
“But there was a bright light, and my aunt placed herself in between the light and the civilians. I did it too. But—but two people I was supposed to be protecting died because of my inexperience,” Jack stops, wiping a few fingers on his eyes.
pulls at Dean’s arm on her left shoulder. She grabs it by the wrist with her both hands, spins under it and in almost two seconds she now has Dean partially facing away from her, his left arm pulled downwards, taut. She then motions to knee him on the side and stops when her knee almost collides with his obliques.
“I ask you, Rider Dean Winchester, how was I able to summon you as a Servant?!”
When the dust partly settles, he sees Sentinel in the opposite quadrant, wings outstretched and gently lowering the debris he caught in his barrier.
Sam appears to be satisfied. He lowers his hand as the ring of flame disappears, leaving only the inner ring and the pentacle. “Dammit, Dean!” he says under his breath. And his heart breaks further when he sees the forlorn look on his brother’s face.
was startled awake by Sam who pulled on the pillow under his head. He groans as he felt metal push on his scalp.
“Hmm,” Claire hummed. Noticing the jar of tomato sauce in front of her, she picked it up and turned to Jody, “I guess we’re Filipino now.”
. So maybe that’s what his uncle was asking about.
“Hello.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He always said that he wouldn’t be as quick to murder like our parents,” Sam says. And then he turns to Claire with puppy dog eyes that remind him so much of her brother Jack.
Dean leaves the room and then Kaia speaks up, “You don’t have to ask me twice.”
Meg pulls herself up, “You don’t have to ask me twice.”
“I am sorry to disappoint you again.”
“Pinned to where? Just our luck,” the woman says, hitting Charlie behind the knee and pulling her arm up, her Command Spells free for all to see. “Three Masters and a Servant walk into a room.”
“I think it’s a good movie, you know?” said Jesse.
“Hello,” Jack said. He stared at his right hand as it stood steady beside him, palm flat, fingers pointing straight towards the sky.
Dean stands, “A new case? What case?”
He stops. He can see the look on his daughter’s eyes. It’s the same look that Dean gives him when he thinks he’s overthinking again. Dean’s influence on Claire is now obvious. “I love the man but I don’t want you labeled as a villain,” he says.
The next frame shows the first time anyone has taken a clear picture of the Hunter. This time it was Dean’s father, John. The picture was taken in broad daylight when John had teamed up with other heroes and a (reluctant) villain:
Despite being vegan, Sam doesn’t complain. He loves his wife. And she reminds him of his late brother.
He brushes off that thought. If Kaia doesn’t want to think about the Incident, he shouldn’t as well. He lets his mind wonder to other things.
“Still alive,” he says, gently dropping the bag on the concrete as paramedics rush in. “Be on the lookout for Bloody Valentine, have your people look into security cams, anyone whose eyes glow silver is a suspect. She’s working with the Hunter, who’s engaged in combat with Frankenstein,” Angel says in one breath. He flies back to the action, leaving the officers almost terrified with the situation’s developments.
“I’m sorry, Jesse. Jack’s father has strict rules,” Dean said. He squinted to get a better look at the time on the laptop’s screen. “It’s almost midnight.”
When Cas turns toward his direction and spots him, a smile ghosts his lips. Dean immediately takes off his helmet and shows the Superhero how he’s beaming. He rushes forward and takes off Cas’s visor, who for the moment was startled. He cups the other man’s face in his hands and stares at those infinitely azure eyes and lets himself drown in them, before wrapping Cas in the warmest embrace he’s ever given anyone, including Cas.
“I do not know what you two are talking about,” Jack said flatly.
Now they’re in the motel room that he and the Golem rented for this hunt. He’s been nursing a cup of coffee for the better part of an hour now. The woman just stares at him, waiting for him to start the conversation.
Jack rests his head on Jesse’s shoulder.
Who is Saber? And what does Alaya want with her?
Then Claire realizes what the three are talking about, “Dudes, I know Purgatory was traumatic, but I’m Jon Snow here. Care to fill me in?”
“Oh,” Jack pondered for a bit. “Han Solo or Boba Fett?”
They leave the kitchen and enter the library. As soon as they take their seats Sam blurts out “How was I able to summon you, Dean?” So many things dashed back and forth in Sam’s head. But he breathes deep and settles for “I was asleep and Mrs. Butters was supposed to bring me a relic from the May King.”
He doesn’t even know who lives here.
instead.”
Bobby looks at him, lips pressed and nestled underneath his full beard. After a moment he says, “This is classified but… the DoD ordered ten working units for their Sentinels. I told them I get to keep any prototype for my own use and the patent’s ownership remains with me.”
He looks at the wisps of mist around the cliffside. He counts one, two, three, four dogs that were still asleep. He counts eight others approaching Jack—
is staring at the cream-colored door of the blue two-story colonial in front of him.
In the last Holy Grail War, he was able to summon Samuel Colt because his father left them
“I’m not drunk enough for that yet, son,” Bobby says, passing the tablet he was holding to Castiel. “Bring it here, Ash!”
Ben threw a throw pillow at his brother, “Are you sending that to Jesse?”
“Kissing on the first date, Jack?” Asked Dean, a small chuckle escaping him.
when he put an end to the Purgatory Incident. Villain is just not a term she would use to describe Dean.
A circular pattern, shaped like the grooves in the barrel of a gun. He learned from the Academy that Command Spells are emblematic when they manifest. Well, he does have a tendency to use guns in his magecraft, so, it pretty much fits.
“Did you say Holy Grail War?” Aaron’s eyes blowing up. He’s heard of it before. One of the ramblings of his late grandfather. It was supposedly a ritual competition where seven Servant-Master pairs and the victors are granted a wish that the Holy Grail will grant. He never believed it to be true until Sam Winchester competed in the previous Holy Grail War.
“Hey, kid,” said Kaia, smiling at him from behind Claire.
“Thank you, Bobby.”
“You think that low of your brother to keep this from him?” Castiel throws at her.
He extends a finger towards the stack at the far end of the coffee table. A sheet from the lower pages flies towards Jack, “That’s why.”
Eyes boring holes on the floor, Jack raises his hand, “May I ask a question?”
had been the best couple of days of his Senior year.
This chapter and the Noble Phantasms are meant to parallel the relationship between Gilgamesh and Enkidu in the Fate worlds multiverse. These two Servants have the same Noble Phantasm (albeit executed differently) and are the most important person in each other's lives.
They shook hands and made the contract. Surprisingly, it worked and now Jesse found himself in a situation that he never thought he'd be in.
“Well, until that happens, we have this,” Jesse snaps his fingers and his phone appears in his hand. The video of Jack lying on the park is playing and he shows it to Jack.
“Oh, you boys! You’re making me cry,” Mrs. Butters says, wiping a rogue teardrop on her cheek. “You three, wait in the library and discuss this Grail business. I’ll make us Dean’s favorite burgers!” she says with a wink to Dean.
“Relax!” Jody assured him, her voice higher than it was a few moments ago. “Nothing my mom voice can’t handle.”
“Nah. Like one of those one-hand blasters!” Ben said animatedly. He rose from laying on the sofa and pretended to pull out a gun, aiming at Vader on the screen who just failed to capture Ahsoka.
The two Servants stare at each other. That one second of connection, stretched infinitely through the profound bond they shared in life. They finish their chants at exactly the same time and silence deafens everyone’s ears for one seemingly unending moment.
“Ben told me…”
Dean almost dropped the bowl he just took from one of the cabinets above the kitchen counter.
Jack takes the laptop in between the stacks of paper and opens up an image file. It’s a beautifully drawn full-body portrait of Jack in his hypothetical costume in mid-action.
“Sometimes I forget that you’re telepathic,” he mutters, which earns him a chuckle from her. He breathes in deep. “I will make it up to you,” his wings rustle at his unsureness as to how.
Sam brings out his phone from his pocket. “It’s Thursday,” he tells Dean.
“Where’s the fun in that,
It’s been a year since they last been in the Bunker. When she first decided to take up the Hunter’s mantle three years ago, she lied to Jack and left him somewhere in Colorado. When they got together again, her brother snapped and for two whole days no one in the State could lie in any capacity. She said sorry on the second day because she needed excuses to go run-off and practice not getting killed in action. She’s twenty-five now, just two years short of when Dean took charge of what he calls the “family business.”
Jesse hasn’t seen his cousin since—well, since Purgatory. He remembers Kaia too. Their cells were right next to each other and they quietly shared lunch breaks with Patience and other captives their age. They’d hear each other scream whenever Frankenstein came for them, and even after months in the place, the fear never left.
Kaia comes up to her and grabs her hands, “So, you don’t want me in there with you?”
“Why did the Hunter call you ‘babe?’”
“And then he steadied me before I fully panicked, looked me straight in the eye and said, “I don’t know what to do. But what I do know is we won’t tell Cass!” Like bringing up your best friend out of nowhere while having a conversation about your unborn child was completely normal.”
Sometimes he relishes the gusts of wind blown at him this way. Him being stationary, unmoving, is a pleasant departure for when he flies towards danger to rescue the next individual who is not one of his children or Dean, or those he considers family.
In this fic, Rider's (Dean Winchester) and Berserker's (Castiel) shared Noble Phantasm is called "Olani Hoath Ol" or "I love you" in Enochian. It is a NP that aims to recreate the users' many heroic sacrifices to ensure the safety of the world and prove their love for each other. Berserker's manifesting as a pillar of light from the Heavens and Rider's as an eruption of eternal Damnation.
Dean’s hearty laugh then echoed throughout the kitchen. He turned to Lisa and said “Jack likes Jesse’s hair,” raising both eyebrows repeatedly in quick succession.
She was the first in the Hunter legacy to take up a costume to conceal her identity. Mary’s, like all other uniforms in the Bunker’s archives, rests in a display case beside the weapon’s cache in the floor below her.
Whenever they were let out of their cells, they placed collars on them that had small barbs that stuck to their necks. It functioned like the flashing light in their cells but whenever they tried using their powers, their bodies would experience extreme pain. He could tell how it worked. His influence on the things around him were limited to his own body and it kept him from zapping away by keeping every cell in his body in place.
“Talked to Ophelia, their chapter went nuts too. Marco says that the first spike was done by powerful magic.”
“What the hell was that?” Kaia asks, looking at the people around her.
“For parts,” says the other three in unison but with each a different weight to their words. Jack elects not press further.
Jack ponders for a moment. “So you want us to do the same?”
“Of course, Jesse.”
Now a formerly Divine Spirit Berserker is his Servant. Jack at least wanted any of the other two knight classes if he didn’t get Saber. But that’s all in the past now. He would just have to give this Holy Grail War his all. There’s really no way around it.
He hears heavy-set wings flap behind him and he smiles. “Greetings, brother,” says a chilling, breathy voice.
“That’s my father,” Jack said excitedly. Something inside him was eager for Jesse to meet the rest of his family.
“I love chocolate.”
Sam looks at him with a fond smile and thinks
“Okay, when do we start?” Meg’s voice stops him from further marveling at Bobby’s work. “The DA’s gonna suspect me sneaking off to do crime if I don’t report in two hours.”
“I heard that!” Aaron protests.
Cas snickers and he puts a soft hand on Dean. “Dean, stop. You’re embarrassing yourself,” the Superhero chastises him.
Ben finally ceased his altercation with Maggie and said “Dean knocked my mom up before he and Castiel got together. He on the other hand—” Ben pointed to Jack, “Castiel’s best friend got him the same year.”
Of course this isn’t the only one. They have thousands of businesses spread across the Americas and very few people knew about them. And those that do keep to themselves. Especially the Mage Association, which the Thule are members of. That damned heretical institution doesn’t bother to intervene so as long as they benefit from the Thule’s “research” on magic.
All the bulbs in his living room explode as lightning and thunder violently assault outside his house. He vaguely sees all of the gemstones obliterated into fine dust. The fossil lights up and surge of magical energy throws him towards the wall behind him. When the light dims he sees the silhouette of a tall figure with massive wings.
“Local police have been notified and on the way to the scene,” Gabriel states, wiping some leftover jelly smeared on his plate and licking his finger.
Jack waves both his hands in front of him, equal parts shocked and equal parts thinking
“Aunt Ga—
—his eyes become pitch black, and his body suddenly steams from standing on hallowed ground. “How am I supposed to know that?” he says as he lunged forward and their weapons meet between them.
Inside he can see a fairly wide platform, rounded by thick safety glass. At the center of it, something is being set ablaze by four XL18s. Castiel looks around and sees a number of equipment he has no idea how to operate and a few people standing by computers.
Aaron Bass is somewhere in Pennsylvania, stalking around an industrial factory that mass-produced cotton shirts and linen bedsheets. Company records show that they catered mostly to European and mainland-Asia businesses. But he had his suspicions.
Tired of beating around the bush, Sam asks “So which class did you fall on, Dean?”
“But that doesn’t matter now. I am without a Master. In a few hours I’ll disappear and return to the Throne of Heroes,” she breathes deep.
Meg and Castiel turn to look at each other and Meg whispers something to Sam. Dean slams his hand on the table. “Hey, share it to the class!” he demands.
He didn't object. It was an exciting thought, maybe he could get a glimpse into the world his dad used to live in. The Mage Association did employ Hunters from time to time. He even met his best friend there.
Jack tilted his head to the side, “I have gay dads.”
“For the longest time, I blamed you for every horrible thing that has happened to my—
“Garrison to Angel. Signatures indicate someone still alive in one of the bags,” Angel hears from his earpiece. “Third from the right.”
Then they hear a knock on the door. They both went silent and stared at each other wide-eyed. Ben silently takes his gun from underneath his pillow and positions himself behind the door. Jesse (now being a servant) is less susceptible to harm so he places his hand on the doorknob and slowly opens it.
“Gabriel,” Castiel’s voice rises, “focus!”
His son looks up at him, his entire face wet with tears. Angel can see the bloodshot eyes underneath the mask. “If I was just a little closer to the building—” Jack wasn’t even able to finish the sentence.
4. The going to a villain and anti-hero to help with torture is an off-the-books mission. Sometimes we have to work with lesser evils to combat even bigger threats, a trend in the main series.
“No,” he corrects him. “I’m Jack.”
on the nose, Jack.”
Ash points finger guns at his employer and says, swaying his bleached mullet, “Presentation! Whenever you’re ready, Bobby.”
you have to make me pancakes tomorrow!” she offers, taking a seat at the chair nearest to the fridge.
Charlie can't think straight and in a moment of panic she uses a Command Spell, not even knowing what for, but her mind was screaming
before you died!” Sam shouts as he let goes Dean’s arm and backs a few steps.
In a quick second they find themselves on the rooftop of the hospital. Charlie is panting on the floor trying to compose herself as she did in the elevator. She looks up and sees the two Servants and the other Master strung up in the air with heavy chains made from viridian light. Beside her she sees a man with deep brown robes, his face hidden by a large cowl.
He remembers a high school friend he had say “No way your mom's a regular fitness coach. I saw her drawing a pentagram underneath your doormat!” He scoffed and teased his friend for spying on his mom.
He swallows his annoyance and makes his way to the showers.
“Well, we have to go,” Claire said. “We need sleep.”
She and Kaia met a few years ago. Claire just finished her long hunt for her missing mother and Kaia coincidentally showed up at the same location.
As he walks through the hallway, his helmet tucked under his left arm, his right hand scrapes his blade on the concrete walls beside him. No real reason, the sound just makes his brother’s ears hurt.
Kaia laughed, “Uhm, yeah. Why wouldn’t I be?”
big for it in the first place. “What is it, uncle Gabe?”
Sam’s words reverberate throughout the entire Bunker. And the infallible magic of the Command Spell surges towards Dean like an entire ocean crashing on him.
Having a no-catch wish would come in handy. Aaron could practically wish for anything. All the weed and bacon in the world sounds really nice right about now. But he thinks he could use the wish to fight the Thule or get another chance with his grandfather and actually listen to him for once. Whatever he decides on, he needed that wish.
A grin presents itself on Jesse’s lips. “Of course, Jack!” he says.
They started walking towards the living room. “We’re watching Rebels,” Jack said.
what Styne did to them!” Dean shouts. “But you weren’t
They chat as they walk further down the hallway, Charlie talking excitedly about the new books she's bought to read to her mom. That's until they pass by the room the pair she saw earlier had entered. The door is only slightly (thankfully wide enough) ajar to see the leather-clad woman point a gun at who she assumes is a bedridden patient.
That was unfortunate. Aaron looks at Delphine and he sees the soft look in her eyes as she stares at the Arc. It looked like she was grieving for someone a second time around. She probably had a wish she wanted to ask from the Grail, Aaron thought.
We meet another Servant-Master pair.
Angel chuckles. “You’ve followed protocol and you’ve been able to catch up with my flying,” he says.
“Who?” asks Berserker.
“Dean’s helping Bobby take something from the garage,” Sam says, finally getting a bite into his mouth.
“I’m not sure,” she trails off for a second, thoroughly thinking things through, “I can survive for half a day without needing a Master but I would still need magical energy in order to keep my physical form.”
Sam isn’t buying any of this. He slides his hands down his long hair, from the forehead to the back of his head. It’s a tell that he’s fuming despite the pleased look on his face. Eileen kicks his shin and quickly signs “Save it for later” while Dean has his back turned.
(who his father apparently has a romance with). It was a legacy title used by different people—in succession—who all ‘hunted’ down criminals. He wonders if they were all related somehow?
Jack embraces one of the dogs as the others begin to rest beside him. “I couldn’t sleep,” he says, palm smoothing out the fur on the dog’s head. “And I wanted to see you.”
“Is there something wrong?” Jack asks. Ben just lifts his hand up to show
When he first started being the Hunter, he wanted his helmet to resemble the Impala. But Charlie convinced him otherwise. So, he opted for the next best option, spray-painting an actual impala on his helmet instead.
—But the Catholic church
“I’ll drive you there!”
“He’s not your boyfriend
Claire laughed from the loveseat. “There’s nothing
Jack focuses his attention on his Servant. This fight is demanding a lot of magical energy and from his periphery, the building sweat on Sam tells him the same. “No. I just figured it out from the way they talk and greeted each other,” he answers. “Were they lovers?”
“He keeps newspaper articles about you in a binder in his room,” Kaia chimes in.
of him do we like?”
. But to actively inflict pain and suffering on someone that they’d wish for death, and then deny it? He has to draw the line somewhere.
Everyone at the table except Jack burst out laughing. Harper was this girl from his school that followed him around Junior year. She would say really insane things like declaring her love for him even though they didn’t really know each other but would immediately leave right after said declarations. He told her many times that he wasn’t into girls but she pressed on. It only stopped when she started dating the school’s quarterback. He can’t say he was grateful because said quarterback kept on threatening him if he didn’t stay away from
Pastor Jim then tells them the basic rules of the Holy Grail War. Regular civilians are not allowed to be informed or involved about the Holy Grail War (accidentally or forcibly). Upon losing a Servant, a Master may approach any ecclesiastical province of the Catholic Church for safety, then they forfeit the right to further compete. A Servant losing its Master may form another contract with a Master still in the competition. In rare cases, the Grail will summon a Ruler-class Servant, if it detects anomalies far beyond the reach and capabilities of the Church and the Servant-Master pair; Ruler will take over the role of supervisor.
He thinks for a moment and does some dynamic stretching. He walks back and forth in a straight line. He flaps his wings to check the back plate that stops his wings from overextending. “It feels right. Fits me perfectly. But I think I need to test it out on the field,” Jack states, knowing his father could never refuse him. “I mean, to know for sure.”
It hits him. Dean’s actions now finally makes sense. Why making a deal with the Counter Force is worth it for Dean Winchester, the Righteous Man.
“Sam!” Mrs. Butters shouts. Sam knows that he stepped over a line somewhere. But it’s too late, he already crossed it and he’s not backing down. That’s the bullheadedness that the Winchesters are known for.
Yellow Eyes was an old supervillain and long-time nemesis for the Hunter. He’s responsible for the deaths of Samuel, Mary, and John. As a cruel twist of fate, the Hunter mantle was always succeeded by the person the former died protecting. Which is how Dean had taken up the helm after his father. “Sam was finishing law school,” Dean had told Claire last year. After one final confrontation, with Dean almost dying, he managed to kill Yellow Eyes once and for all.
Right now, they know Styne would never talk unmotivated. Dean massacred most of his family and he never once avert his gaze.
“So… Is there?” Jack asked.
Styne’s voice cuts through the air. Far along the room, he sits restrained on a chair, at the center of a massive iron pentagram on the floor.  A thick blindfold covers much of his face.
Also with inhuman strength, Frankenstein clenches his lackey’s shoulder and throws him at the Hunter. The poor soul and the grenade meet ten meters from Frankenstein but it doesn’t worry him.
With the last bit of her energy, she looks around and sees the other Servant-Master pair picking themselves up from the floor. The other one, the masked Servant is nowhere to be found. Cas turns to her, asking if she’s all right.
“Hello, Dean,” Berserker says when the man brings him back down.
Slowly all the fires burn out and the last of the firemen move out of the buildings, carrying those left inside. A few casualties and some badly injured. Angel flies high so his body camera can view all buildings affected. Charlie tells him a small figure can still be detected in one of the buildings. He makes his way inside and let’s his supports direct him.
“I told you never to summon me, Charlie,” the man, her Servant, says in his sultry voice that breaks at odd intervals, probably from disuse. The man pulls back his cowl and reveals the face of a young man with a hideous scar that ran down from his left cheekbone down to his chin. “YOU WILL REFRAIN FROM DOING THIS AGAIN!” He screams, sending Charlie into even more frantic terror.
She repositions herself and Dean grabs at her left shoulder, and they do the move all over again and again. And again. And again. And again. Training gets tedious at times. Sometimes Dean would have her do the same move for about an hour before moving on, and then he has her doing the same move again the next day. Today isn’t any different.
“Wait, CMBR like in WandaVision?” Dean asks, his hands never once leaving Castiel’s shoulders.
But before Claire stepped on the gas, Jack stopped her, “Guys, wait.”
Jesse pushes Jack off his shoulder, laughing. “Really, Captain Long Hair?” he quips. “Wouldn’t count that one out yet. A few moms and their kids still call you Golden Boy in their posts.”
Meg nods, “What is it, lover boy?”
Castiel smiles a gummy smile he usually reserved for family. The suit would mean the world to Jack, and he couldn’t be thankful enough that Bobby’s giving two to his son for
The free Servant turns and an ear-to-eae grin etches itself on his face. “If it isn't little Delphy,” he says with utmost familiarity. “You've grown into a fine woman.”
“Where
“So, Jack,” Lisa raised her voice, too cheery. It was obvious she wanted to change the topic.
Who she thought was her father stood up and then a gruff voice spoke behind him. “Hey, Cas. Who's this?” the voice asked. It belonged to a tall scary-looking man who was currently eating a large bucket of fries. “Amelia?” said the man, in the same gruff tone as her ‘dad.’
“I like staring at you too,” Jesse said, looking straight into the camera so when Jack looked at his screen it would seem like they were gazing into each other’s eyes.
“There is a Master confined there, but when I took a look, she was a comatose patient,” discomfort riddling Jesse's words.
Jesse laughed, “Is it really a date with other people there?”
Jack had studied the fossil for countless hours back in the Academy. He found out that it was from an angel from the First Sphere of the Holy Host. He doesn’t know which Choir though but the idea of summoning a Divine Spirit as a Servant appealed to him. He might even summon a Saber-class Servant. He can see no other class fit for a powerful Angel.
“Yes. She was at the Chapel before you arrived and we talked with her then,” the other Master says.
“But Patience’s visions don’t always come true,” Jack says. His voice was so sure and maybe like Jesse, he doesn’t want it to happen.
Jack hugged his pillow tight and let the light from his laptop—No, Jesse—wash over him. “I never imagined I’d enjoy spending this much time with you,” he said.
Sam pulls Dean’s arm and pushes up the sleeve. There he sees a tribal mark that looks like the number seven with a small slash in the inside fold. It’s completely red and Sam feels the dark and corrupt magic emanating from it.
“Terrifying?” Rowena suggests.
“’Oh, shit’ is right, Dean,” Cas’s eyes glow and then he looks around. “Why the hell is my daughter here?”
Immediately, after the explosion, Angel is between it and Frankenstein’s crew, wings outstretched, wide enough to cover the entire crew and their vehicle. And then two more succeeding explosions happen.
“And I saved a cat too!” Jack says with much gumption.
Jack sighed, “Jesse, I am not one of those people.”
“Sammy, not just a groupie. I think he’s your number 1 fan!” Rider says jokingly.
“I don’t do that.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“That’s embarrassing!” Jack takes the phone from Jesse and throws it far away.
Jack reads the label on the mugshot, “Dean Winchester.”
“They were and I kept my distance. Also, there were only three Masters there when I left.”
Jesse hummed and smiled at Jack. He can’t wait to see that smile in person again.
Jack had powers. He can move things with his mind, he regenerates faster than even his father, he can teleport, and he can change people’s perception of reality in a
Baby (his ’67 Chevy Impala) hums a familiar and soothing tune as she sits idle in the garage, among other vehicles, as old as her, but not as loved. He grips her steering wheel tight, expending all tension he has left from the earlier encounter.
“Money he was laundering!” Dean defends himself.
Sam closes the laptop in front of him. “Glad to see you didn’t kill anyone today,” he said, smiling.
Her grandparents thought that her mom was just compartmentalizing, tragically making absurd reasons for Jimmy leaving them. But other than that, they only spoke of Jimmy with nothing but praises and love: saying, up until that point, her father was the epitome of a family man. They eventually left Illinois to start over.
Jack collects himself from his excitement and stops when he sees Jesse just smiling at him. “I’m sorry. I guess I was geeking out again,” He apologizes.
His father looks at him fondly, “Thank you, Jack. I can see you’re all set for the day.”
He nods at her, “Greetings, Pamela.”
When the briefing is finished and Jack and Sam consented to the rules of the Holy Grail War, they exit the chapel, Berserker and Rider still hand-in-hand. The moment they set foot outside, Rider throws Berserker a good few meters away from him.
Jack took a sip of his strawberry-chocolate milkshake. “It’s alright,” he said, Castiel’s eyes darting an
He bids her farewell and walks down the hall to their right. He heads straight to the stairwell at the end of the long corridor with the curtain wall overlooking the front entrance. There’s an elevator back in the main lobby but he prefers walking the hallways because of the different multi-cultural and occult artifacts Bobby has displayed throughout the facility.
“Kelly—my mom—didn’t make it,” Jack was pulled from his thoughts by the mention of his late mother. “She wanted Castiel to raise me but my grandparents only relented until he got a decent job.”
“With a gut like your dad’s,” said Kaia, a small chuckle leaving her lips. “Sure you are.”
It is a brown ochre suit with gold piping made with material similar to his suit’s. The suit is just one piece that can be opened from the front of the high neck down to just below the chest, closed using whatever mechanism Bobby saw fit. Castiel walks around to look at the back side and sees two openings meant for his son’s wings.
“Jesse, is everything okay?” he asks the denim ball of sadness across from him.
He opened his front camera and subtly raised his phone. He smiled softly and quietly took a selfie with everyone else in the background. Quietly if he remembered to turn off his system sounds.
Dean took a huge gulp of his beer, “Do as I say not as I do.”
He can’t panic like the victims so he steels himself. He sees Angel, the Superhero he admires the most, his father. Angel is here to protect the people. So is Cherub, and so are the first responders.
Dean sat in his room, taking in the site of his most prized weapons hanging on the wall. There were his parent’s twin 1911 customs. The first machete his dad ever gave to him. And the makeshift blade he had used back in the Purgatory Incident. And even Rufus’s old Tzitzit hung there. He never used any of these things anymore. But they hang on his wall so that every day when he woke up, he was reminded of everything he stands for and everything he had lost. He stands up and takes a look at the framed images on the table by the weapons wall. A photo of him and Sammy when they were kids. A wedding photo of his parents. And a candid image of him and Charlie in one of her LARPing events. And then there was the last photograph.
“Cherub! Where is—” Angel pauses when he sees the sullen look on her face. She nods towards his left and returns to her work.
“Okay, time to be loud,” he tells the Golem.
When Dean enters the dungeon, he sees Eileen talking with Nancy and… Meg?
“Oh yeah, for what?” Henriksen says, challenging.
“You can only make it up to me in two ways,” she says, raising a finger, motioning him to move closer. When he is just a few inches from her she whispers “A: you can find me a decent man without a PWD fetish…” Castiel nods, face tight-knit.
Castiel clasped his fingers together and rested them on the table; just beyond the half-eaten burger, forming a wall to keep Dean away. “Excuse me?” he asked.
“That’s not what I meant,” Sam’s fists closing in on each other. “What if other Supers decide he’s not the hero everyone thinks he is just because you managed to take down Eldon Styne together? What if the government decides the same?”
“What? No!” Charlie shouts when the villainess managed to escape the well-deserved beating. She hated that character with her entire being. She was a deplorable, xenophobic murderer who worshipped whichever power-crazed maniac had her by the neck. Probably homophobic too. A true anti-thesis to everything Charlie was. Or as she currently is.
Claire cuts Sam off. She was getting frustrated with the tiptoeing, “And so can Jack! I don’t get what the big deal is about. Wouldn’t it be great for my brother to be around someone like him for once?”
“Dude,” Jesse cuts him off, “Let's not argue about this. We're here. We fight. We win.”
“I wouldn’t have done differently given the chance. It was all so you could have a life!” Berserker rebuts, raising one hand towards the endlessly darkening sky. The skies now crackles with raw energy and bursts of silver light appear through the clouds.
Both Jack and Berserker tilt their heads to the side ever so slightly at the same time. Rider blushes and stares at the two back and forth. He looks at his Master, raising both brows with a tight lip, signaling that they need to talk about it later.
, someone whose mind can travel outside of the body when in deep slumber. She wasn’t registered in the Enhanced database, and he only found out when their powers accidentally melded one time. From then on, Kaia’s mind was able to travel more freely than before she met him. Most of the page just listed Kaia’s stats. Except for one disturbing passage.
Sam closes his hand into a fist and raises it beside his head, the Command Spells facing Dean. “With my first Command Spell…”
He turns away from the display cabinet, walks towards the kitchen, and prepares coffee. The repetition every morning assists in keeping his thoughts in line before he flies out into the field. He does not bother making breakfast though. Gabriel will wake up any minute now and with a snap of his fingers a readymade breakfast will appear on the table.
“We needed answers,” he reminds it. The other remaining members are frozen in place. Fear or shock, Aaron doesn’t really care.
suspired unto the glass door of the display cabinet in his living room. He is staring at the silver short sword resting on a velvet line case. That weapon used to be his weapon of choice for self-defense whenever he was on the field. But after the atrocities he committed in Purgatory, he elected it best to retire what people dubbed the “Angel Blade.”
“Ah but I have you to help me watch what I eat!”
“We have non-family guests coming,” Sam plays it down. “I need you in complete uniform.”
. He and the boy were sitting across each other at the table. When he downs the glass, he notices the boy’s slate blue eyes boring into his skull.
Everyone laughed short of hysterical.
Jesse picks up his phone and walks closer to Jack. “What are you doing here?” he asks. Jack was wearing Marvelous Marvin pyjamas, and he looked pretty good in them.
“Maggie, stop,” said Jack as he threw a balled tissue paper at her.
“Good night, Jesse,” Jack said, knowing full well that that smile will carry him into good dreams.
“Are you lost, little girl?” the man asked, lowering himself to Claire's height. He looked up and was shocked to see her mother standing a few feet behind them, swimming in shock and disbelief, “Amelia?”
“Well, you could call yourself Captain…” Jack, struggling to find a comeback, spots Jesse’s lengthy hair, “Long hair!”
The woman—Delphine, lowers herself to look at the man’s face. “Dammit. How many times must I kill this man?” she mutters.
Sam drops the knife but it doesn’t clatter. It ends up back on the knife rack, because with Mrs. Butters’ magic, any form of untidiness never occurs.
Claire and Kaia run in from the hallway asking the same thing. None of them have any idea.
was the most important meal of any day,” Gabriel trumpets as he takes his seat.
“Ask her yourself.”
The scarred Servant turns to Charlie, threat of hostility evident in his seemingly blank stare. “Heed my warning, dear Master. You
“How’d you even find me here?” he asks, stalling, wanting to find the right words to explain him disappearing for a few days. Why does he even need to explain himself to Jack anyway?
“Should we leave? We should leave.”
Jack chuckled, “I don’t think I count as a what, Jesse.”
“Thank you,” he replies. His job here is by no means finished yet. He sees Cherub, Sentinel, and Demoness talking with a cop and the supervising FD officer. He can see someone from the DA drop out of a car and head towards the group. He needs to bring up the mystery woman, the bodies, and Cyrus Styne.
“They are all dead,” Styne mutters, too quiet to actually make out.
Kaia then holds her hand tight, her eyes giving the only real comfort she’s known in the past few years. “Babe. Her visions about family
Jack didn’t know what that meant. But Charlie told him that whenever his uncle wiggled his brows, he meant something deeper or different. Yes, he’s technically an adult and was supposed to understand social cues more, but not much people wanted to connect with him in his travels with Claire. That’s why he’s having trouble thinking about Jesse just leaving abruptly a few days ago.
When Bobby presses the button again. Jack is shivering with anticipation. When the door rises and he sees certain forms and equipment he realizes what the surprise is. And it is only when the bright lights in the Garrison illuminate the entire set, did he jump and hug his father tight.
Jack pulls back and beams at his uncle who puts down the bread and knife to give his shoulders a tight squeeze.
entirely. He still provided lore and connected hunters to others if they needed back up. It
Dean raises both hands in protest, “Hey! I offered to pay after I stole it, didn’t I?”
“Nowhere to be found, boss,” Charlie says through the earpiece.
Right on cue they see Ben turn the corner. His face immediately lit up and his pace quickened as he got closer to them. “Claire!” he shouted when he was just a few feet away.
“Do you want me to leave the room so you guys can feel up each other's cores?” Ben teases, returning to his bed and replacing the gun underneath his pillow.
“Took you long enough,” Bobby says, taking off his safety goggles.
“What is that they’re hauling?” Jack asks, seeing several figures around Frankenstein loading bags into a vehicle.
“And what? Am I supposed to thank you for leaving me alone?” Rider blurts out, not actually expecting an answer. “It was supposed to be all or nothing with the two of us, you son of a bitch.”
his hair.”
The first two frames were picture-less newspaper headlines from the Kansas Herald. One reads: “
“Surrender, Frankenstein,” Angel commands, “the police are on their way.”
All of them were shocked to see the Hunter in full gear, walking towards their target.
Dean finds his hand gravitating towards his bone knife but Castiel stops him. “Eldon, you can’t overpower any of us. Just lower the gun and the barrier and stop,” Cas says, commanding yet calming.
the start to an explosion. He steadies himself.
He turns around and sees no one else in the living room. And then he recognizes that velvety voice. “Jesse?” he asks the empty air around him.
“Jesse’s power manifests as pitch black darkness!” Dean exclaims, apparently having enough of this conversation as well.
The boy stares at him confused, and then the knobs start turning in his head. “Oh! I am really sorry,” the other boy looks like he was about to cry.
to pull Mia back in the spotlight too?!”
Jesse shows Jack a news headline a day after his debut. The title reads:
Delphine’s face lights up, “I am a Servant called upon by the Holy Grail to fight in this Holy Grail War.”
“Why didn’t you tell me Ben was there?” Jack can see the embarrassment in Jesse’s face.
“Jack, calm down. Bobby isn’t the surprise,” his father almost snickers. “Though it’s a surprise you’d think so.”
“Who?” asks Claire.
Jack couldn’t help but agree. Jesse’s hair did remind him of the chocolate fountain at uncle Sam and aunt Eileen’s wedding last year.
Jack trails behind his uncle and they make their way to his father’s study just beyond the staircase. When they enter the office, Gabriel yells “Let me in!” and the bookshelf recedes into the wall, revealing stairs. Jack remembers that the basement he knew did not extend to the back of the house (which is where the office is at) so unless they expanded that… He doesn’t know where his uncle is leading him.
the most important meal of the day.”
Jack makes his debut. The plot thickens when Castiel discovers something on Jack's first patrol around Illinois.
Angel calls out for the Supervisor in charge. So far there are no casualties but after the explosion they are unsure. It’s possible that some of the first responders are trapped with some residents. Angel then points Jack to assist his aunt with the victims.
Jesse was caught off-guard. He looks around and stares at multiple things, then he sees the multiple stacks of paper, and finally he breathes.
“Well, we fight monsters together.”
“What brings you here, Jesse?” Jack asks, a soft smile pressed on his face.
Jack stops pacing and looks at his Servant. “Disappoint me how?” he asks, his smile persistently clinging on his face.
“Well, I thought I’d bring it here before Dean sneaks into the lab and steal from me again,” answers the old grump.
“Check the specs,” he tells her as if she knows what it is he’s talking about.
Then pastor Jim and the long-haired man both greet Berserker.
A few mugshots of the handsome man and ground zero images and clips of different fights and robberies appear on the sides of the screen. A supervillain. He wore a mostly maroon, ribbed body suit, with an army green triangle that starts from the shoulders and points towards his groin and the same green piping on the thighs and arms. His black combat boots rise all the way to his knees. And he wore a smooth black helmet with a green spray-painted face of an impala on it. Jack knows this villain well. The media calls him
“Hey, handsome.” Jesse said. “Ready to gra—”
Three supervillains in one city.
He turns to the others and asks, “What day is it?”
His brother briefed him earlier about how they might need to
Jack turns to look at his father. “Can I try it on?!” Jack says, awaiting his father’s confirmation.
“I’m pretty sure he is,” said Ben, now back to pointing finger guns at the chachkies dotting the shelves. When he turned to point it at the door he saw Kaia.
“Like I said in the past, I prefer the card game.” Charlie rebuffs with a roll of egg in her mouth. She swallows, “And I thought Sam took you up on that offer?”
Jesse reels back and looks at his clothes. He forgot that he was in a hospital earlier before he accidentally zapped here. “Shit. That’s embarrassing,” he snaps his fingers, eyes turning pitch-black for a whole second, and he’s now fully clothed in an acid wash denim shirt, black denim jeans, and brown leather boots. The day he finds a denim boot that looked better than his cowboys is the day he wears one.
Charlie then gestures at what Jack can only surmise is a control board in front of them. A lot of different screens and buttons and switches that are too advanced for him to know. “Well, we provide visual support and reconnaissance for your dad while he’s out in the field.”
“How is she?” Castiel asks, to no one in particular but Bobby answered anyway.
“Well, my sister doesn’t have powers so she can’t manifest hers,” Jack says, seemingly dejected. He bites on his lips before saying “But she’s strong in other ways.”
Jesse appears in front of him, wearing a different set of denim clothes, but still the same boots, “Hey, Jack.”
“What do you think about
“Okay, shoot!” Jesse says after composing himself.
Castiel stares into the distance, blank eyes only met with the mass that separates Michigan from Superior. “I learned from Rowena MacLeod the other day there was no use in dwelling in the past, that pinning blame is wasted effort.
“Why do you spoil me?” Charlie asks affectionately, taking an apple on the fruit bowl in front of her.
“Jesse,” Jack smiled to himself. “I wouldn’t ask you if I didn’t.”
The third frame was from the Herald as well. There was no headline for that publication, the first in the paper’s history. Just a large image of a wall with writing painted in blood. At the center of the image is the burnt body of a woman who Claire now knows is the
“Well, I was going to buy something from the convenience store and I felt your magic core nearby.”
With Servants and Masters showing up left and right and meeting in unsuspecting places, no one is safe in this Holy Grail War. One Servant-Master pair is scoping up the competition before making their move.
Bobby hands Claire his tablet. “With money you stole from Dick Roman—"
“You were with Lancer and her Master again.”
As much as Sam wants to greet his wife home, he’s too tired from going through all the relics they have in the Bunker earlier today with Mrs. Butters (the Bunker’s caretaker who helps him from time to time). He was looking for anything that could be related to a known Heroic Spirit and use that as a catalyst for his summoning later.
“Charlie,” Rider answers for his Master, taking a sip of water from his glass, “Another weird-ass Holy Grail War.”
“Just, okay?” asks Jesse.
“Confiscated?” Sam raised a brow at his older brother. “Dude, you love that grenade launcher. You know you’ve got to stop leaving him gifts.”
A similar thing happened with the Supervillain shapeshifter Mia Vallens. She committed a murder on February 14
Family dinner is here and stories will be told.
“God,” Castiel’s exasperated voice sighs. “Here of all places?”
“Will there be a third go?” Jesse asked sheepishly.
“Maybe,” Jody answered. “Or… you calling my place home for most of the year is ageing me faster than the speed of light.”
She was listed as a
Granted that, most of the time, ones the media or the masses give to heroes and villains are for spectacle. And those provided by governments were canned goods at best.
Gabriel was nursing a large lollipop. From the looks of it, it was blueberry. Gabriel’s collection of sweets was always color-coded. He once told Jack that it was easier to know right away, compared to the elaborate packaging designs of candy nowadays. “You didn’t tell us where you were going,” he reprimands Jack.
“Hello.”
“Oh! I mean, yes, I do have powers,” he smiles and his face turns a bit flat. “But Claire doesn’t.”
Everyone knows Frankenstein and his group ran the place. But no one knew who funded it and for what nefarious purpose. Both his father and Kaia refused to say anything. It must’ve been
Claire is wearing her gauntlets, trying to get accustomed to punching with something heavier than her training gloves. “No,” she bites. She balls her fists tight and punches hard. When her fist makes contact, the gauntlet activates its pile bunker feature and the bag rips apart, unable to withstand the force. Sand spills everywhere and Claire turns to look at her father.
Rowena’s jaw drops and looks at Jack and then at Castiel, and then back to the boy dressed in Star Wars pyjamas, “He looks exactly like you in the old photos Gabe showed me!” She pinches Jack’s cheek as he and Charlie got closer.
“Jimmy, is that really you?”
The boys watched Castiel fade from view. Jesse’s fingers somehow managed to find themselves in between Jack’s and he squeezed.
5. One aboriginal myth tells the story of how Uluru was created by two boys dancing in the rain.
He hears movement in the kitchen.
In that split second, a tall foreboding man that scared the living daylights out of Jesse appeared, a silver short sword in his hand. He positioned himself in between Jesse and Jack with the blade pointed straight at Jesse. He turns back and looks at the blond boy and places a hand on his shoulder and they both disappear.
from the Church. But a part of him tells him that there’s more to this story. And he spots, Dean staring at his Servant like he’s the beauty of every star in creation and one of the many wonders of the universe itself, mouth slightly agape and eyes beaming.
Ben scoffs, “Maybe the coward went back to the Throne.”
“Who’s Sam?” Jack asks, genuinely curious.
Before the Clock Tower, Jesse was hunted down by angels for being a Cambion; half-human, half-demon. He had powerful demonic magic and they were threatened by it. He had powers but he had no control over them. Well, that was until he met Flat Escardos who convinced Lord El-Melloi to take him as an apprentice.
Then Jack feels the same tug of magic he felt in Sam. The air around Berserker is crackling with raw energy and he can hear his Servant chant something through their psychic connection.
“Why’d you cover it with a blanket?” Bobby asks.
retiring. But fighting in a uniform takes time to get used to as well,” he says, pointing finger guns at her. “So, I had Bobby bring them in.”
. Well, technically it hasn’t been his home in twelve years. He’s twenty-two now (and though he enjoyed travelling with his sister and her girlfriend) it’s time to call it that again.
“But how was I able to summon
“Sam don’t!” Sam doesn’t know who protested. His wife or his caretaker, it doesn’t matter. He made up his mind and he wants answers from Dean.
“Are your friends usually like this?” Jesse asked Jack.
“I don’t understand. Those at peace with their deaths can’t be recorded into the Throne of Hero—” then Sam sees the Command Spells at the back of his hand.
Eckhart steps forward and places a foot over an ornate gold and wood box.
Dean puts a hand over Cas’s and breathes in deep. “I know, babe. It’s alright,” he assures him. The Superhero then kisses his cheek before exiting the room.
Nancy hands Henriksen a tablet and he pulls up a video file. He approaches Styne and drops the tablet on the mad alchemist’s lap. Dean raises his head a little so he could watch as well.
The next thing the man—Dean does, shocks Jack. He inches forward and plants a deep and passionate kiss on Berserker’s lips, which Jack’s Servant returns just as fiercely.
Ben first found out he was a mage when he was too lazy to pick up the remote control on the TV stand. He was lying down on the couch and reached his hand out, imagining the remote to come flying at him. In that moment, odd lines lit up on his arm and the remote came flying towards him. His mom saw all this happen and immediately made a call to a man named Sam Winchester. He was enrolled in the Clock Tower right after high school graduation.
“Well, like me, my father only has one pair of wings,” and then he pauses, eyes wide and arms outstretched to his sides sliding up and down. “But my uncle Gabe and a few of my other uncles have six pairs! My uncle Michael doesn’t even have
Castiel spreads his own wings, they may not be the most exceptional, but they are his. He takes flight and makes his way to Sioux Falls.
. He points to the suit, “Yeah, I brought your
The man shrieks. “Jesus,” obviously caught unawares. He nearly dropped the knife and slice of bread he is holding and he leans back on the table. “Christ!” the man follows as he used his pinky to pull out his earphones by the cord.
“Claire, if learning how to fight was what you wanted you should’ve come to me,” Castiel says, rubbing his temple with a few fingers.
“But you
“Dude. There was a gun underneath my pillow,” he complains.
were Bobby’s exact words to Castiel.
“How are you a Servant,” the leather-clad woman asks, “cowardly man like you?”
“My dads would ask each other out on a date and they’d always end up doing simple things around the house or with me and Claire and Ben or my uncles,” he started. He could feel Jesse silently asking him
Jack follows behind them, not knowing what do as a Master relegated as a spectator. He doesn’t know if Dean is either the Master or the Servant, but that doesn’t matter for now, but he does think that Berserker knowing Dean raises a lot of questions.
“Like I said before, Bobby… Presentation!” says Ash, as he struggles to take the box up the short flight of stairs. Dean drops his boxes on the table nearest to him and lifts the container effortlessly.
In that moment of panic, Jesse closed his eyes, breathed, and thought of home. And then he vanished.
“I was gonna say that the uncharacteristic sweetness is making me barf,” Meg takes a sip, “but anyone over forty deserves happiness.”
Yes, they were just here a week ago, but she
Jack drops the papers in his hand and turns to his newfound friend, “Well, I heard my dad call you that as well.”
“Hell yeah!” Dean shouts and Mrs. Butters frowns at him, making act sheepish and smile mischievously at Sam and Eileen.
Jack noticed Castiel come in through the front door, holding bags that he assumed were Claire’s and Kaia’s. “Good morning!”
After three grueling months of espionage and brute-forcing his way through a plethora of Nazi-Necromancers, he found out it was a front for the Thule Society. They used it to launder money to their American chapters and partnered contemporaries for funding.
“Dude, why didn’t you tell me big sis was coming back today?” Ben then pushed Jack a little stronger than he intended. “Sorry,” he apologized seeing as how his brother almost fell.
“I don’t care!” Rider screams, his roar, inhuman in all its hoarse guttural bellowing. A white Colt M19 pistol appears in his freehand and he aims at Berserker over their crossed arms. “And I’ve met your father. He was a real bitch.”
“Nobody’s falling in love with anyone,” Jack said.
Castiel laughs, “The legendary Castle who took on
“Dad, your cholesterol can’t go any higher,” Jack said as a matter of fact.
stuck in the past.
Clive, probably back from the Farmer's Market.
Sam then chimes in, “As his family’s assigned legal representative in Enhanced matters, I put my feelers out when he went missing from the hospital. The next day, his parents called and said he was home safe. Then a few days ago Charlie emailed me security clips, from
“Now the symbol. The boy needs something that says “Hello! I’m here to help you” when you first see it,” Bobby says, opening up the design file of the suit on his tablet.
Outside the Bunker, Dean looks up to the midnight sky, and turns around. The other three are confused and worried all at the same time. And then Dean stops, facing East. He takes a few steps forward and his eyes crinkle. His lips begin to part and a massive smile summons itself on his face. The Servant’s eyes water and they glisten under the silver moonlight.
Gabriel would’ve returned the hug but, “Hey, kid. I don’t want to accidentally stab you. Your dad hates me enough.”
The front door opens and Charlie hears an elderly man's voice call out her name.
“Why does every remake have to be so…” Jack paused, searching for the right word, “… Edgy? The characters tend to lose their personalities.”
“Welcome home, Jack,” says a mechanical sounding voice. He’s not sure where it came from but the door opened as soon as he heard it. And it closed immediately after he stepped inside.
Claire finally makes the connection. She stares at the beautiful imagery that possibly contains a horrible future for her brother. “Well, not all of Patience’s visions come true,” she bargains.
“I have to say, I do miss your cooking!” Claire says.
He and Jack then take a seat on a nearby rock. “You’re afraid of what’s on the painting?” Jack asks. “You’re afraid that it’s you I’m going to fight?”
When a pleasant and relatively strong breeze blows by, he spread his wings and tips them in an angle so he wouldn’t be pushed off by the gusts. He rarely gets to feel the wind brush through his feathers. He loves this feeling, is this what his fath—Angel feels when he’s always on patrol.
Claire grunts, struggling to pick herself up. “What was that for?” she complains.
“I know what he’s going to do,” claimed Claire, casually nudging Kaia’s side with her elbow.
“Hey, food's ready,” Alex announced. She saw the picture in Claire's hands and walked up behind her. “They saved me from vampire hillbillies. That was the day Jody officially adopted me.”
Jack’s Servant turns to the two Masters and extends a glowing hand. And in an instant all four of them are transported into an open field near the Stateline. By the freeway is Rider’s car, the Impala, transported along with them.
“All that’s left is a symbol on the chest plate,” says Bobby.
“Trust me I didn’t know,” Jack said, steadying himself not to trip further on the gutter.
—swatting his hand away with that ironwood gaze of his. He put both of his hands up in surrender, “Let him start the conversation himself. It’s not like we were eager to tell our parents our dating life back when we were his age.”
Castiel’s eyes bored holes on Dean’s skull as his husband took a large bite. “I didn’t even know you liked me back then.”
“No, I find it cute,” Jesse says. “You should call yourself the
company made brings in more investors and buyers.”
Before Jack even knew it he’d been in a call with Jesse for 2 hours. Jack could talk for hours when he was with Jesse. There’s something about the other boy that pulls him out of his usual quietness and makes him excited about everything.
He turns to Castiel and whispers, “No, babe. You’re always in the way. I have to defend my honor.” He points a finger at the agent. “Compensating for not sending me to jail,” he says.
He spent the next hour taking a bath, fixing his hair, and fitting into his uniform. The armor (though form fitting) is hard to fasten on when he did it alone. He stood in front of his mirror for fifteen minutes, just staring at his reflection.
“Son of a bitch. Someone
The Heavens part and a massive pillar of burning white light appears, engulfing Berserker as it struck down. But it was met with a torrent of Hell-flame and thick dark smoke. The growing tower of screaming agony swallows Rider whole as it rose up to meet the other Servant’s blow halfway.
Jack hoped Jesse would get the reference.
Castiel placed his hand on Jack’s shoulder, smiling softly when the boy turned to look at him, “It’s okay if you don’t know yet, Jack.”
He used to love coming here with his father when he was a kid. Jack would play with Marvelous Marvin: the Talking Teddy Bear and wait for their turn on the swings or the seesaw. And when it was, he would safely tuck Marvin in one of the seats beside his and discretely use his powers to push them both. And when he grew tired, he’d make one trip on the slide. He’d sit by his father by the benches, watching the other kids play with each other and laugh along with them when they did something fun.
And there was a knock on Jack’s door and he immediately looked up. The door flew open and Dean pressed his lips together, “Time to go to sleep, kid.”
He found several swords wielded by Saints and even Mjolnir. The latter was something he and his brother confiscated in a hunt one time. He doesn’t know how to summon a god into a Servant body though, totally different ballpark.
“Oh really?” asked Kaia.
But then the Arc of the Covenant shakes and the magic circle begins to glow as Eckhart’s blood reaches the center of the circle. There was a blast of white light from the Arc and it blinds everyone for a few seconds. When the light dims and Aaron looks up, he sees a tall, lithe brunette with long flowing hair and tight-knit clothes.
“You know you really should be calling me Archer.”
“I remember what I said Sam,” Dean stage-whispers. He can feel the awkward tension coming from Eileen and Mrs. Butters.
“Far too many, Cas,” then (apparently) Sam pulls Berserker into a tight embrace.
Jack introduced Jesse to Ben and Maggie who they met at the line in the cafeteria. After grabbing whatever’s passable for the food authority’s baseline they found a square table perfect for the four of them. Jack and Jesse sat next to each other.
“Are you taking selfies?” Claire asked nonplussed. Jack wasn’t one to take selfies.
Then they hear screaming and realize it’s coming from the dungeon. They run and are met with the dead bodies of the two police officers and one of Henriksen’s men, lifeless husks completely drained of bodily fluids. Castiel looks at the bodies and sees a rune drawn in blood on the floor.
Angel kicks one man towards what remains of the wall to their left and then blocks the bullets aimed at the Hunter with the wing he used to slap him. “No killing!” Three more unfriendlies remain, including Frankenstein who was leaning on the vehicle.
With training getting progressively harder every year, she sometimes doubts herself if she could pull it off. But she needs to. She has to. She comes from a family of known Supers. Being powerless
Sam sighs, “Dean if people make the connection between the Hunter and Angel, it wouldn’t be good for Cas’s reputation.”
He stares at Eileen who gives him a soft smile and nods to Dean. “It really is him,” she signs, her hands forming the hands-on-the-wheel motion they use for Dean’s name.
“Okay, Clive…
“Yeah,” Sam huffs. “Him and some others.”
Sam, who was sitting quietly since he dropped the bags somewhere above Canada, decides to make his thoughts known. “Dean, you wouldn’t be training a kid to replace you if you weren’t.”
They met five years ago when Dean managed to track down Kaia somewhere in South Dakota. She and Kaia just met and were hanging out at a Biggerson’s, eating burgers. Dean approached them when they got out of the restaurant and Kaia made a run for it. When Dean tried to follow, Claire’s first instinct was to kick him in the nads. They made their way to the library where Jack was at and she immediately asked him to zap the three of them away. Jack didn’t bother asking why after she let him return the books neatly on the shelf.
“Plus Luke’s gay, right?” Ben said.
“You know, all of you… Shut up,” Dean says, sheepish. Then he asks, “So are you two hungry?”
Castiel looks around them and sees the couch pressed to the wall. He sits down and says “I am Berserker.”
“Styne, whatever you’re doing, stop,” Henriksen says.
“I’ll tell Mick to coordinate with them,” Eileen says, rapidly pressing on the typewriter.
for people. “I love it!”
The Mark on Rider’s arm glows and the ground around him becomes tormented soil, devoid of all life, tendrils of darkness and white hot sparks skirt the surface of the open field. “I had a life! And it was with you!”
well-adjusted.
“So, Castiel, why are you a Berserker?” Jack asks, he needs to find a way to win even with a new Servant. And asking Castiel’s story will help with how he can bolster his powers. And who knows, he might even have a powerful Noble Phantasm.
Meg flicks a finger and the blindfold violently tears away from Styne’s head. “Shut up,” she says.
Kaia taps Claire’s shoulder and angles her phone so everyone can see, “Yeah, he made his debut today. Look.”
“What connection?” Dean bites. “You mean, Purgatory? Newsflash, Sam, the entire world knows we were both there. Along with hundreds of other supers.”
Now he is in front of a blue and gray research facility the size of a small compound. Yet, as sentimental as an old drunk can get, he kept the name and the original signboard. The beat-up, dull-painted 6’x15’ wood panel looks horrendous in front of the modern architecture, and Castiel loves it.
But the honey-blond man turned around and plants his eyes on Berserker.
He was in the stranger’s yellow and green kitchen, on his third glass of water.
“See you at school, beautiful.”
“If I recall correctly, it was you who angrily yelled “No one kisses Cass but me” when Bartholomew attempted to at the hallway in our senior year.” Castiel countered.
In the living room Castiel stood behind the sofa. Jack sat on the floor in between the wooden coffee table and said furniture his father was brooding behind. They were watching Ahsoka duel with Darth Vader, Jack flinching whenever a swipe got too close or when their lightsabers hacked the surrounding architecture. Well, Jack was watching. Castiel watched
None of the other kids played with him because he was weird
Behind him and Cas in the photo, he saw the blurred image of a bearded man.
Jesse laughs and pats beside him. “Nah, it’s okay. Some of the locals think I’m an Ancestor Being,” he says.
“Shut up, Gabriel,” was the hero’s only response.
the consequences if this happens again.” In a flash of bright verdant light, he disappears.
Rowena raises her cup towards Charlie. “He did! Managed to bring his dead Eileen back to life too. Who knew he’d be able to use my own spell before I ever did! Tried it after him though,” she says winking at a visibly uncomfortable Castiel.
Henriksen and his remaining people have their guns aimed at Styne who is backed to the wall, a barrier of light glistening around him. Eileen and Sam escort Nancy outside the dungeon. And Meg stands nearer to Styne, powers at the ready.
Patience and Kaia were sent to live in a group home for Purgatory kids that needed adjusting, they needed time to go back into the real world. Sam Winchester, a lawyer, approached his parents and offered to send him as well but they declined. That’s probably how Jack met the girls.
“What?”
“I thought we weren’t going to pressure him,” said Castiel, raising both eyebrows.
“Again!” Dean barks.
“Wouldn’t it be awesome to be able to use the Force?” Jack asked. But it was more of a statement than a question.
Sam upon hearing his name, picks up a knife and walks towards the three. Every utensil in their kitchen was made of silver and there could possibly be a shifter or leviathan wearing his brother’s face with them. Mrs. Butters stands up and stays his hand. “Boy, calm down. That’s your brother!” she says in her most motherly voice. “That’s Dean. As a Servant,” her voice quieting at the last words.
“The recreational drugs you use make you paranoid,” it says matter-of-factly.
Luckily it is still the kitchen he knew. And everything is still familiar, a muted yellow and green. Along with the back of the short, blond man dancing, eyes closed, spreading PB&J on bread slices.
“Yes,” Delphine says, standing up. She walks around the room and both she and Aaron look at the Golem with mild disgust as it hides away the Arc of the Covenant inside its torso.
He winks at her. “Jealous, Meg?” Dean teases.
Jesse pouts at him. In an instant the Servant is on the passenger seat, the paper bag now on his lap. “Good news, bad news.”
“Relax! I’m not asking you details about Jesse,” Lisa clarified. “This one is about your dads.”
“You would’ve found out anyway,” Dean said with a wink, finally reaching for the untouched glass of water that sat beside his now empty beer bottle.
Jesse uses his powers to lift up a dry bush and bring it closer, hovering in front of them. His eyes become fuller than the dark night surrounding them and he stretches his arm. Jack stays quiet, observing every moment. Then the bush crumples, it compresses on itself, and in a matter of seconds it becomes a tiny diamond reflecting what little moonlight pierce the clouds.
Dean sits down on the table, his blue steel pout making it obvious that he’s thinking. He looks up at Kaia, “Can we see the painting?”
“I know that’s me.”
Jody's house back then was too large for a family of two but Claire didn't question it. The pictures she saw on the living room shelves were answers enough. There was one with Jody on her wedding day. One of her (presumably) late son and husband. Another with a little girl who she assumed was Alex.
He closes his laptop, gets up, and makes his way to the kitchen. Eileen is coming home from a ghoul hunt in Dodge City and she’ll need a warm meal when she gets home. He takes out a piece of steak from the fridge and he grimaces as it slapped on the chopping board when he put it down. His wife might love him with all her heart but she’ll never part with meat.
“I wanted to surprise you both,” Claire said.
bangs on the door of the Bunker as loud as she can. After four deafening slams with her closed fist, she smiles at herself. When she turns to look at her wincing girlfriend Kaia, her smile fades.
