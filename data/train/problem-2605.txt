? Sherlock peeked. The doctor seemed to be kneeling now, his face pushed up against one arse cheek to watch his own hand move. Sherlock gripped the mantle with desperate fingers. He was fast losing stability in his knees.
“What?” Lestrade was obviously stunned, “He
Molly turned to face him, her expression sympathetic, “He knows you love him, that you’re
, please don’t cry, no, no, no.”
John was speechless but managed a nod. Sherlock smiled down at him, and stepped back, “Tomorrow, then,” John said, his voice thick with feeling. Sherlock nodded once, turned on his heel and left. John stood for several minutes, lost in thought before he let himself into his flat and made himself a cup of tea. John realized that he’d had a full meal and his stomach did not ache. He was drinking tea, and his throat wasn’t closing up. He had walked for hours and his leg had not hurt. He changed into his pyjamas, brushed his teeth, and washed his face. After rinsing out his teacup, John went to bed, closed his eyes, and fell into a deep restful sleep for the first time in five years.
Sherlock smiled bravely even as his heart sank, “Yes, I know John. You’re not gay. How horrid to have some man pining for you for the rest of your life. I am stuck here, there is no other way out for me, and all because I didn’t look up before a drank my sodding cup of tea.”
The titter he heard running through the audience let him know that those assembled weren’t impressed with anything they were hearing, not at all. Sherlock wasn’t sure what humiliated him more, being sold as a slave or how bored the auctioneer seemed to be. “Starting bids at
“You’re just a boy.” Doc seemed perturbed now, but Sherlock didn’t give him a chance. He just took the soldier’s hand and dragged him to the bar. “Hold on, lad.”
There was a cascade of comments, his mobile bleeping every second or so until he finally muted the conversation. Bleakly, Sherlock read through them. Everyone including Lestrade and Harriet was asking who Lisa was, and where Sherlock was, and she was gleefully answering every single question with, “I’m just a very special friend of John’s.”
“I will help you, Billy,
wasn’t important, only putting distance between himself and John was important.
“John, what is this all about? First the Museum, now dinner? How long have you had these plans in place?”
Sherlock’s cry was primal. Intense ripples of pleasure made his back arch so severely that his come spurted in a tight curve, splatting against Sherlock’s belly to drip onto the bedding below. “Come in me.” Sherlock felt so good. His body hummed with satisfaction, he felt sensuous and powerful. “Danny,” they kissed, Sherlock’s head craned to the side to reach his lover, Danny’s body rutting furiously now as he chased his orgasm, “Be the first person to come inside me.”
Her arse was so gorgeous. John was almost salivating by the time they were naked enough to get down to business. Rolling on a condom, he stroked on some lubricant and positioned himself. Without waiting, he thrust hard, burying himself deep within her wet hot folds. “Fuck, yes.” John closed his eyes and began to pump his hips. This was worth every pound he’d promised her. John was so bloody horny. He couldn’t think straight any longer. All he did day in and day out was dream about fucking someone who didn’t want it, and it was killing him.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder at John. He was holding out steaming hot cup of tea. On the coffee table was a platter of brightly decorated biscuits. “I thought you were leaving for the holidays.”
Sherlock knew he was taking advantage of John’s mood to reminisce, but it didn’t stop him from saying, “Angelo’s?”
Sherlock woke when two cool hands began to massage his buttocks, “You are being such a good boy, my lovely pet. Look at you, exactly as I asked. You are doing so well, I might get you some proper clothes.” John tugged and twisted the plug, playing with it until Sherlock was entirely awake before he removed it. Sherlock gasped when John poured cold lube directly onto his gaping hole, “Look at how hungry that is, so naughty, so wet and just waiting for me.” John sounded ravenous as well as affectionate, “Spread your legs, Sherlock, show me your nice wet hole, put your finger where my cock is going to go.”
working full-time to pay for this giant money-pit. You know, it wouldn’t have broken your legs to come over to his to help out once in a while, a cab would literally have brought you to his door, no walking involved. You really are a lazy arse.” Sherlock was now the one who felt guilty because Danny was right.
.  They were ushered to a small private table where their seasonal drinks were waiting for them, and their server assigned. Sherlock looked around at the understated room, and then over to John, “So?”
“Just what, Sherlock?” John wasn’t shouting but he was still snappish. Once he lost his temper, even if he instantly regretted it, it always took a while for him to settle down. Now he was too tired. It was far too early, or too late, to be arguing with his flatmate.
“Looks like Mrs H has been decorating.” John was sipping his tea and absently reading the paper on the counter. Sherlock looked up and swallowed hard.
It didn’t matter right then. There were other serious concerns, “Who?” he demanded.
Sherlock improved physically by the hour. All throughout the heat, his body knitted together, his movements less strained as their combined dynamic did what they were evolved to do – help one another. John seemed to have an inexhaustible source of energy, all of which he expended on Sherlock’s behalf, and Sherlock seemed endlessly needy for John’s attentions. They were born to be with one another, so every moment of the heat was like living in a fantasy come true. They read each other’s bodies effortlessly, exchanging pleasure, and working together to reach new heights. It was brilliant.
This was right. This was how love should be made. Sherlock was hungry and desperate but not lost to his senses, not yet at least, so he prepared John carefully, enjoying the hot press of John’s inner passage against his fingers, liberally spreading lubricant everywhere they would need it until he could hold back no longer and pressed his cock against John’s crease, sliding it through the slick  and moaning as he saw how deeply inside John he could go before he was fully buried. He needed to feel it, now, so carefully, Sherlock used one hand to press his cockhead to John’s hole, glorying in the intense sensation entrance brought.
John blinked before he sat on the sofa right next to Sherlock, “I was momentarily engaged to someone, but she was cheating on me. I’m glad I had somewhere to go. Please do not refer to Sherlock as a freak, he’s never liked it and neither do I.” John responded, his voice was wooden again as if inflexions were beyond him.
It was Molly who voiced the feelings Sherlock wasn’t even aware he was having, “It’s cruel of John to taunt you like this,” she said over tea. She had wanted to give him a birthday treat but Sherlock had demurred. He didn’t feel like he deserved anything special, not after everything he’d put those who knew him through, particularly Molly. Rosie was passed out on the sofa, her plush bee gripped tight in one hand as she slumbered. “You did so much for him, he knows how you feel, and yet…”
doubts for months, right from when Sherlock had first returned from the dead, but especially after Sherlock had been shot. John’s lifelong habit of repressing his true feelings about things that affected him deeply forced him to continue denying his actual emotions regarding the world’s only consulting detective, and now everything was muddled because John doubted himself even more than he doubted others.
. The defoliation revealed a man younger than John had estimated, fit, dangerous looking, with sharp cheekbones and a piercing gaze filled with barely repressed anger.
“Thank you, doctor.” With that, Doctor Coates took himself off to complete his rounds. A short time later, an intern and a nurse moved Sherlock to a small room, freeing up the emergency bed for someone else. It was quiet and lonely. No one came to see him, but who was there left who would want to? Mycroft was busy. Lestrade was busy. Sherlock had no other friends. Molly Hooper had grown apart after the fiasco with Mary, he hadn’t spoken to her since then. He had people he worked with professionally, people who owed him favours, but no one any longer that he could rely on to be with him during a time like this. It was dismaying. With nothing better to do, Sherlock allowed himself to fall asleep.
He must have misheard that because John was in heaven. He loved how thick Sherlock’s cock was getting, and how delicious he smelled, and how wonderful he tasted. Having a cock in his mouth was better than he’d dreamed it could be. He’d long wondered what it would be like, if it would be awful, but it wasn’t. John loved the way the head rubbed against his tongue, how it felt to let it block the top of his throat, the way it made him salivate. He moaned, and wrapped his arms tight, keeping himself close to his treat.
“You’re the most beautiful cookie in the universe.”
John was moving too slowly. Sherlock was becoming impatient. Now that their signals had clearly registered with the other, he was instantly reluctant to spend one-second longer edging toward the culmination of his long-suppressed desires. If John had felt the way Sherlock had felt for even a quarter of the time Sherlock had, then they would be in their dotage before progressing to intercourse. He couldn’t manage that much time so Sherlock decided to throw all caution to the wind and to do his best to erase any memory whatsoever of any lover that John had ever had…especially her.
, do I hear
. The leg was dragged away as the team organised themselves quickly and John watched in horror as they carried a closed body bag out of view.
“As in a romantic dinner...a date, as it were.” Sherlock was very clearly unnerved yet determined, bright apples of red brightening his cheeks.
Can’t we just do it now and validate the licence later?” Sherlock demanded.
Mycroft tapped off an angry text and seconds later, his mobile rang, “Gregory? Yes. John Watson. Sherlock? He’s in front of me right now, in the emergency room, black and blue from head to toe thanks to the doctor. Yes. Immediately. Use any resource necessary. No. This cannot be tolerated, Gregory. My brother has been through far more than anybody ought to endure, and all for that...
I hope not because if you do, I’m going to pray that Sherlock and Danny remain together for the rest of their lives so that Sherlock doesn’t end up like mum. Think about
, he only had the one, and that was Sherlock Holmes. She was needling him unkindly, another one of the few tendencies he didn’t like much about her. She tried to play off as merely joking, but the oddly patronising tone of voice was the one that she used whenever she was attempting to be supportive despite disagreeing with whatever the issue was. Mary said out loud that she liked Sherlock, but John doubted it, not with how she was picking their cases apart to laugh at them. The doctor was still very proud of all the things he and Sherlock had accomplished together back then.
Sleep was difficult. Sherlock was lonely all the time. He’d shut his old mobile off and left it in the bathroom drawer of the first of Mycroft’s homes. He used a burner phone instead, and only had Mycroft’s, Lestrade’s, Anthea’s, Molly’s, and Mrs Hudson’s numbers programmed into it. He didn’t bother checking up on John, convinced that his ex was happily shagging the new person in his life and having a grand time of it. Sherlock’s sexual side had perished with his relationship. He didn’t even masturbate and never felt the need for orgasm. Just thinking about it made him queasy. All of that business had been fascinating when he’d been John’s lover, but any suggestion of it now made him think of the man who had broken him so completely, and he simply could not deal with it. He’d asked his brother and Lestrade to keep information about John to themselves. It wasn’t likely that John would leave them alone, he
Danny leaned forward and kissed Sherlock’s mouth firmly again. It was warm, friendly, and as comforting as one of the lovely hugs that Danny was also giving him. “Well, now you know. Come on, beautiful. I’m bloody starving now. I haven’t felt properly hungry in I don’t know how long, and I haven’t slept this well since I don’t know when. Gives a man an appetite, it does.”
Sherlock wasn’t remotely sleepy but obeyed, shutting his eyes and listening to John walk through Mycroft’s rooms. He listened to the distant noise of water being poured, the snap of the electric kettle being activated, and drifted as he processed everything that had changed. To his surprise, he dozed off and woke sometime later, John lying next to him, and a fragrant pot of now cool tea on the night table, “I didn’t mean to sleep.”
“She was
Sherlock sighed, the loneliness inside of him sharp and steady. It wasn’t as if he
, go on with you like nothing happened,
It had been fished right out of the trash and sent to the dry-cleaners by the good doctor,
Sherlock woke in the morning when John began fucking him. His master had somehow managed to finger him open a bit before climbing on. He was just sliding inside when Sherlock reached consciousness. John didn’t try to make it good for Sherlock at all, he just used Sherlock’s arse to get off in, fucking with short hard thrusts until he ejaculated. Without a word, John pulled out, yawned, and scratched his head as he went to shower up. Red-faced and humiliated all over again, Sherlock used some tissues to wipe the spunk from his hole. John came out, steaming slightly, “Go wash up. Breakfast in ten.”
Sherlock nodded.
“Married! Wonderful! Sherlock has been so lost without you, our John, this is the best Christmas news ever. Hullo, our John, I’m Sieger.”
The man nodded and brought John to the far corner of the shop where an entire wall was covered in carefully hung displays. “The top is white the bottoms are black. The shoes are red.”
“I don’t eat on cases! You know this! John, tell Danny!” Sherlock was already seated with Rosie on his knee, cuddling the small girl effortlessly, segueing into a rapturous and heartfelt sounding greeting, “Hello, my beautiful angel, I missed you.”
“Well, we can’t stay here, Aggie. The boss said we
His attempts were both a resounding success and a complete failure, his attempts to flirt or otherwise engage John completely misinterpreted. Sherlock realized that he’d made a dreadful error right off by telling John the ridiculous fib about being married to his work. The work was fascinating, certainly, but the work wasn’t John. It was a problem. John kept dating women, and even went on to get married to one, though it hadn’t lasted, yet
He went around the back of the building, dug out the key that Mrs Hudson left behind the loose brick in the garden wall, let himself in, and walked up to the flat with his heart in his throat. He pushed the inner door open and stepped in only to be rocked back as a very bony fist smashed right into his nose, breaking it sharply. “You are not welcome here, Doctor Watson.” Another punch was quickly delivered, this one neatly bruising his entire right ocular region. John didn’t defend himself. He deserved it all.
You can sleep in my room, John, my bedding smells like me too, no crumbs though, and also, let me remind you,
“What?” Sherlock snapped, “I don’t need to be here, I’m going. John can just continue to fuck himself and her and anyone else he feels like
“I’m trying, Myc,” Sherlock found his shoulders shaking as tears welled up.
. “Honestly, John,
I can’t blame him. Why wait for someone when what you’re getting is going to be a fucking nightmare to live with? All I’ve done is use people, I’m taking advantage of their good nature, and all because I’m too proud to admit that I’m in love with my best friend and admit that I died inside when he went away. I’ve used my daughter as an excuse instead of being a proper parent to her, and fuck, Harry! I just said I was a mess, why are you making me say it?”
“Stay!” Sherlock found it difficult to shout but he managed to raise his voice a little, at least, “You will stay and hear me out.” John stopped moving so Sherlock flapped his hand as imperiously as he could manage. John barked out a pained-sounding laugh but obediently came close to wrap his gentle fingers around those same commanding digits. “In the
Sherlock almost orgasmed as he felt someone’s unsheathed cock inside him for the first time in his life. It was so different. Now the soldier’s cock rubbed his insides in a whole new way. Sherlock found himself mewling in the most undignified way, “You are so beautiful, my little fucktoy. I’m on leave for only another day or so and I’m going to use all my spare time fucking you. Do you want that, pretty thing? Can daddy keep fucking you until it’s time to go?”
Sherlock’s eyes widened as he realized that John was fingering himself, hard.
. John had chosen it on a lark, and Sherlock made a mental note to change it to something more dignified right after the call. “Yes?”
, quaint idea that it was, for someone special, but that someone didn’t want him that way. Danny did, in fact, the younger man had wet his fingertips with saliva and begun to tease Sherlock’s hole playfully. It felt insanely good, and Sherlock grew hard. Danny did too, “I want to suck you.”
Wait, didn’t he…he was sent away for murder, John! It was in the news. He killed for you? He saved you again? And you
John’s fingers were trembling. His right knee felt shaky and close to giving out. He felt hot and cold. Sweat gathered at the nape of his neck, and he felt his cheeks heat. “It’s none of your business, Sherlock. Remember? We walk separate paths now.” If John hadn’t been looking right at him, he never would have seen the gutted look. Sherlock recovered but John was already shaken. “You were the one who decided we should never speak again, and I accepted that. Good day, Mr Holmes.”
Sherlock looked grateful, “Yes, if it’s no trouble, John.”
hands. I can’t wait.”
Sherlock spun around, stunned. John was standing at the entrance of the office. He looked as tired as Mycroft sounded, the dark circles beneath his eyes blatant testimony of his unhappiness. With the turmoil of the last few weeks undergoing a mental reset, Sherlock had very few resources left in which to construct anything clever to say. Instead, he invested everything he was feeling into the most important sound of all, “John.”
Sherlock pretended to be thinking hard before continuing as if David hadn’t said a thing, “Let me amend my earlier statement. It would be like sitting on a cocktail wiener attached to two peas. You
one in the world.” Danny seemed to relax again as he effortlessly teased Sherlock, taking a long drag final drag of his smoke. He pointed the remainder at the playgroup, “Your girl is making a break for it.”
Sherlock’s eyes were wild and filled with distrust. Uncertainty flickered over his fine features as he scented the air before his eyes hardened,
“Doctor Watson? Doctor? Move back. We need to…” Hands pulled John firmly away from Sherlock’s body and began to work. He fell onto his arse and sat there, numbly watching paramedics scrambling to stabilize Sherlock enough to get him into the ambulance. He was bundled in right after and made to sit by Sherlock’s head where the omega could breathe in John’s scent. Protective pheromones filled the cabin as the team worked to save Sherlock’s life while John sat there, too shocked to move.
. As for why you’ve never heard of him, I don’t recall our agreement to report our lovers to one another.” He leaned in and sniffed ostentatiously, reminding John of what Danny had already pointed out. “I see that you left work nearly three hours ago, but you’re only arriving here
will. You know John better than he knows himself, and John is here as your doctor, as your friend, and
There was very little finesse. Their hunger was erasing their skills but enough of their rational minds remained to do things right. Sherlock shivered but spread his legs wide by the time John had managed to work his first finger in, and when John began to broach with his second finger, Sherlock took to fondling himself gently. When John got to the third finger, Sherlock had to grip the sheets, his legs trembling with tension as he rocked down repeatedly to force John’s digits deeper. By the time John managed to fumble on a condom, both men were reduced to grunts rather than words, both panting heavily, and both almost insensible with need.
“John.”
any more. I haven’t a clue what they’re up to.”
“So? I don’t think you look like a woman, you just look
Sherlock didn’t know how to respond. Too many huge shifts were happening in an area where he was barely competent. He didn’t know how to identify his emotions, never mind say words that defined them. He responded once more in the only way he could, “John.”
. It made him angry, and these days, when John Watson was angry, he acted out and then hated himself for it. The first couple of times had been magnificent, but the glorious feeling of contented release quickly became harder to obtain. Each tryst became emptier and emptier, the pleasure, fleeting.
. John was jittery and anxious, and even as Sherlock stood there, it seemed that John was doing everything he could to keep himself from coming over and checking Sherlock from head to toe, just in case he was hurt. “I just walked. I didn’t take anything.”
They went through several different samples, a process that went much faster after John pointed out a mannequin that was dressed in a sleeveless top. The assistant draped their new model so that John could see how the garment would look when worn, and finally, he settled on a sheer but tightly woven one that had delicate branching patterns worked into it. It was made of a metallic appearing thread so that it shimmered in an understated way, it was perfectly rectangular, apparently would work with a number of colour combinations, and so forth. John watched attentively as he was quickly shown a few different ways it could be used. After he paid for it, John took the surprisingly small box it was in and returned to 221 B Baker street to hide it away.
angry that he went ahead and did something unspeakable right in front of the entire complement of Lestrade’s division before Sherlock could utter a word to defend himself, “You really
“It’s nice to know there are people in the world who keep their word.” Danny offered Sherlock a second cigarette and he almost took it but declined. One was bad enough. Rosie would be able to smell it, and John wouldn’t appreciate his daughter returning to him reeking of cigarettes. He did take the opportunity to light it for Danny, though, and their gazes lingered on one another for a long moment after. There was a smidge of appreciation in Danny’s gaze, and the way he glanced up and down Sherlock’s body with interest wasn’t horrible either. In fact, it felt rather nice. “Thanks.”
“Hi,” said Danny. He’d rolled the pram across the grass, following their flight path until he’d caught up, “Pretty little thing, isn’t she? I’ve never had a chance to spend much time around any kids, so this is new.”
. I don’t know what I need. I’m missing something. I’ve lost it, help me find it, Mycroft!”
Clarity hit John like a bus.
“I know it. I just needed to show you that I love you just as much.”  They stood and kissed and Sherlock stopped worrying about being alone, or what came next, or how their lives would change. All those answers would come. Right now there was this moment to enjoy, and the next moment to look forward to, and an entire lifetime of moments to be experienced. This, this was the very best gift of all.
, not anyone else, just me, forever, and nothing you can do will change that. That's what
. “No, please, help yourself.”
“More than.” Sherlock’s voice was soft, almost a whisper. Everything was going better than planned. He’d needed to say nothing, do nothing. John was taking this step all on his own. John seemed greedy to touch, as greedy as Sherlock was to be touched. Sherlock found himself being turned around so that John could claim his first kiss. It was hungry and full of promise. John wasn’t shy about taking control, and gratefully, Sherlock let him. Sherlock wanted everything that happened to be a choice that John made, something that could not be denied, something tangible that they could build upon.
John lay in the bed, sweat drying on his brow and guilt eating him alive. Another day used up, another hour where he was painfully aware of how much time he was squandering on his empty pursuits. It wasn’t often that he got as far as someone’s house, normally, John just found a relatively quiet spot somewhere discrete and went at it. Going to someone’s home always ended awkwardly, like now. The woman beside him was already growing restless, silently urging him to just grab his kit and go. John didn’t argue, rolling silently away from her and yanking on his clothes as he made his way to the door. She was already heading the loo, her back to him. He didn’t need more of a hint than that, he’d done what she wanted, now it was time to leave. They’d both gotten off, he’d made sure of that
to uphold. If I couldn’t keep a promise that I made out loud in front of everyone I knew, how could you ever expect me to keep a promise I never even made to you or hinted at to our mutuals?”
“What?” The associate helpfully pulled out a colour chart that had a graduated spectrum of colours. John tried to recall exactly what shade of red the shoes were, and hesitantly pointed out to a spot, “That, maybe? There were ankle thingies too, like, to wrap around in a big bow?”
was the one who was worried. I said, mate’s been to war, he can hang about the flat with his own babbie unsupervised, but he wasn’t having it. Mycroft probably doesn’t even realize we’ve left.”
“John has been texting this woman dozens of times a day for weeks now. They went to
Sherlock showed his approval by wrapping his long arms around John’s torso, his entire body filled need. John found himself bending down and kissing the top of Sherlock’s head tenderly, his hands gently pressing the unbruised flesh of Sherlock’s shoulders as he let the omega take comfort in him. With a long shuddering sigh, Sherlock relaxed, murmuring John’s name over and over again under his breath. “Yes, John. My John. I missed you, my John. Help me, John. Where were you? I hurt! The palace is in ruins and nothing is where it’s supposed to be. John?”
A handful of tablets let him sleep until his morning alarm went off. John sat alone in his room and managed to eat an entire bowl of plain hot oatmeal. His stomach wasn’t so bad in the mornings, and the cereal would last him until breakfast the next morning if he needed it to. Carefully, he drank two large glasses of water. Staying hydrated was at least something he could do and would keep him from having dizzy spells during the day.
“Shut it. I love the Museum and we never go except on cases. I want to go have a bit of a stroll and take in some history.” They went in and did exactly what he said he was going to do. They wandered around, aimlessly examining artefacts displayed in the galleries. John went up to a man in sober clothing, and after a brief word, tugged at Sherlock’s sleeve to get him to follow along. Eventually, Sherlock and John were standing in front of a case display of what could only be described as well-filled. Shelves seemed to be carelessly filled with jewellery of all sorts; necklaces, pins, earrings, bracelets, even jewelled bowls and all manner of riches, all were tumbled together in a chaotic mess that glinted and glimmered.
, but Danny laughed right in John’s face, striding over after standing straight up, apparently unconcerned that his now only partially erect cock was bobbing openly in front of him as he stalked forward wearing only a condom.
“You smell so nice, my little cookie.” John’s temperature was being stubborn but how could he resist the deliciously complex confection right in front of him?
“What?” John was more than a little startled. He suddenly had a weird image of a plucked chicken stuffed into a too-small pot whilst wearing some kind of painful body-harness. He shook his head in confusion.
Sherlock blinked in surprise at the offer. He hadn’t considered that John might still want to help, and it still felt very strange attempting to do the work without him. He thought for a moment but there really wasn’t much to think about. His hurt feelings and pride simply did not add up to the value of the lives being lost, “Wiggins is still at the same spot, begin there. I haven’t heard back from him today, so perhaps…”
Sherlock felt ill all over again, only this time, remorse was what was churning his stomach. “No, we did not.” He couldn’t collect his thoughts. Everything was chaotic as the new information he’d just gained clashed severely with what he’d thought he’d known for fact, re-colouring the past few weeks in shades that did him no favours.
job to help, not yours. Sherlock is being childish, spoiled, and entirely selfish by forcing you to be the sole recipient of his ceaseless demands. There is no reason you cannot be afforded some time to eat a hot meal, to take a proper shower, or to be allowed to retrieve clean clothing. My brother is being abusive toward you and I will not allow him to continue doing so. The few hours it would take to accomplish these things will not cause him medical distress.”
How much blood has he shed for you? What sacrifices has he made for you? What suffering has he endured for you? How many of the scars on his perfect body are there because of you? In what way have you thanked him? That’s right, mate, you haven’t. You just use him to dump your shit on without a single thought about how he’s suffered. Get your sanctimonious and judgemental face right the fuck out of my home, you horrible human being, and stop imposing on my boyfriend until you’re ready to treat him right.” Danny leaned in and sniffed, “Cheap perfume. What is she, professional or just desperate? Go on, John, go back to the things you find more important than Sherlock Holmes. I’m going to stay right here until this beautiful man comprehends exactly how amazing he is, and
Two hours later he received the all clear. John was removed from Baker Street,
That had stung but Sherlock did not let the effect of John’s words show. Point of fact was that they made
John was stumped. “Er, bright? I don’t know, like cherry, maybe? Those red cherries you find on desserts, not those dark ones you get in the shops. Not that artificial red though, um, darker?”
There was a fresh flurry of texts at 2 PM which he deleted unread. At 3, the bell on the front door rang. It was Anthea, and she was holding his violin case and skull. “Where would you like your bags to be taken?” Sherlock nodded toward his room, and a short line of energetic people carrying reusable totes entered. In 20 minutes, they managed to unload all of Sherlock’s clothing into the empty wardrobe and dresser, filled the guest bathroom with his products, and stowed boxes of his books and equipment in one of the spare bedrooms, setting up collapsible tables to house everything else until Sherlock had the inclination to use any of it. Obviously, Mycroft had ordered his people to retrieve
“It’s not what it seems, Doctor Watson. That bite was from someone who has been dead for nearly two years now, someone who bonded Sherlock against his will during a fight and tried to force him to be his mate as punishment. Sherlock killed him rather than submit to a force-bond.” John felt hollow now, all his anger and fury evaporating entirely. He looked at the bite again and felt sick.
“It really is, John.”
“That was rather unfortunate,” Sherlock murmured. That had been one of the more miserable moments in the last few weeks, “I should never have doubted you.”
John burst in and saw a tall ginger alpha pressing Sherlock against the wall, rutting his massive erection against Sherlock’s thigh like an animal. The man was rugged and heavily muscled. He reminded John of some of the people he’d served with, subconsciously John recognised the military training the man had had, but he tore his eyes from the alpha to check on Sherlock.
Mycroft’s sly tone was another thing Sherlock didn’t currently have the internal resources to deflect so he went with directness.
John wanted to move, to respond but he couldn’t. The order was too vague, and he couldn’t do it. Mycroft sighed. “You’ll have to be specific but cautious. John is more fragile than you think. I cannot help you with this, Sherlock. You two will have to find a way together.”
John couldn’t help but smile. Mummy was presumptuous but he couldn’t find it in himself to object. Mycroft was on his mobile having a soft conversation with someone, but Sherlock was hugging his mother. A moment later, an older gentler version of Sherlock showed up, “Papa!”
John was methodical about it all and Sherlock managed to stay silent while his small plug was removed. He was glad John had him face down on the bed. Tears were falling from his eyes, soaking into the pillow as John immediately began to use two digits to finger him, applying a large amount of lube, but not slowing enough for the sting of entry to fade entirely. It seemed to turn the Captain on to hear Sherlock’s small gasps of agony. In a short amount of time, John used three fingers right up to the second knuckle. Sherlock grunted out in shock and a small amount of pain. John groaned deeply, “I’m so fucking turned on. Listen to you! I love how deep your voice is.”
“I just woke up and I want to go back to bed again,” John yawned, “At least I’m still in my pyjamas.”
John was sleeping in Rosie’s room on a thick matt near her expandable cot. John didn’t want the bed he’d shared with Mary and had sent the mattresses to be professionally cleaned before delivery to a waiting charity. Camping out wasn’t so bad, even if it all was going shockingly fast. Rosie loved the new setup, rolling around his quilt and pillow for ages before she was willing to go to her own bed. He was going to disassemble her cot on the day of the move so that his daughter could retain the small familiar comfort of it for as long as possible. After checking each room to ensure that no donatable item had been left behind, John worked off his stress by continuing his cleaning efforts. By the time two am rolled around, John had scrubbed his old house everywhere he could figure out how to reach.
John left Sherlock in the dairy aisle and paid for his carton of milk before going to his lonely flat. He’d never bothered to upgrade into a bigger flat. All he needed was someplace to store his extra clothes and the rest of his books. He was on the road most of the time now, having rebuilt his shattered reputation one paper at a time until he was able to stand on his own credentials once more. He deserved his miserable circumstances. People like him were not entitled to better.
. John was frozen on the spot, holding in Sherlock’s lifeblood with his bare hands but doing nothing else. He leaned forward, pressing their foreheads together and willed all his life-energy into his lover. He had no idea if such a desperate gambit would even work, it was all wishful thinking, but he had to try. His chest was burning, his body was aflame with anxious terror. He could not lose Sherlock. He could not.
After all these weeks of emotional upheaval, Sherlock felt as if celestial beings were singing all around him. His body felt super-charged with positive energy as he feasted on John’s presence once again.
Sherlock chuckled even as his own arms went around John’s body to hold him just as tightly, “I hope you don’t mean that literally, John. It might make things the tiniest bit awkward.”
“Then what did you mean, John Watson?” Sherlock was getting up, “You spent years telling everyone that you were not gay, what am I supposed to understand about your refusal?”
“Well, I have quite a bit. Mrs Hudson, although I had moved away, I instructed my estate manager to keep a discrete eye on you. They purchased everything you had to sell, top market value as ordered, and all of it will be arriving first thing in the morning if that is agreeable for you. All of it has been professionally retouched and repaired, including your grandmother’s china cabinet. If you’d please move your knitting supplies from their current location, I will make sure the workmen return it to your flat where it belongs.”
“Sherlock,” John groaned his name out but also pushed deeper, “I must be dreaming.”
He woke early the next morning when the duty nurse came to check on him. With a bright and cheery attitude, she solemnly informed him that Doctor Coates would be there presently and that he was likely to be released. Both of his eyes were opened today, so he resolved to be patient. He just wanted to go. “My clothing?”
Sherlock didn’t know if he was supposed to respond. The note made him feel strange, like he’d made a terrible error, but he couldn’t calculate how that might have happened. He went over everything in his head, but it didn’t add up
Sherlock looked at him sharply, “Do I need to ask for your forgiveness for what I did while we were apart?”
They went to Mycroft’s home. In the lowest level of the building was a special office. Hidden panels held weaponry of all descriptions, and one entire wall was filled with nothing but computer screens, all displaying different streams of information. “Fuck.” Danny looked startled.
With that fact at the forefront of his self-destructive mind, John set to it, determined to drown his sorrows and erase his memories, or at least blur them into the background.
“Come to the right place then, John.” John had pulled several ladies in this same place and was a regular, and like so many places, he was given a special and free drink upon arrival. In his own way, John had grown an odd collection of places he liked to find or take his dates, all with friendly staff who eagerly gave him complimentary drinks or even meals for his celebrity, standing by his table until he’d finished it all. Today was the same and he knocked back the offered shot, letting it burn its way down his throat and handing back the glass to the bartender who then went back to his work. Like most of his first drinks of the day, the aftertaste was bitter and unappealing, but a fresh drink always took care of that problem. The gruff old man wiped down another already sparkling glass before taking a nearly full bottle of whiskey off the shelf, “This will keep you going.”
, what did you do?” Despite the angry frustration in John’s voice, Sherlock knew he wasn’t prepared to deal with anything right then. His head was still throbbing from earlier, and now he was sore all over, his stomach churning dangerously. He was going to be ill again, and he needed to bolt. Using his long legs to good advantage, Sherlock turned and fled, not caring that Mycroft most certainly had witnessed the humiliating beat-down via CCTV.
That sank in. The primal possessive part of Sherlock’s mind suddenly took over, and he nearly growled out his assent, “Yes. Yes, I will.”
“Tea?” John didn’t seem perturbed and Sherlock was relieved that John wasn’t pressuring him. After he nodded, John rubbed his hip one more time and rolled out of bed. Sherlock noticed John was introducing different touches to their everyday interactions. The doctor was slow and gentle, carefully expanding Sherlock’s comfort zone, and never pushing him to give more than he was ready to. It relaxed Sherlock to know that he didn’t need to enforce barriers, John didn’t need boundaries to be spelt out. Sherlock had to invite him closer before John would proceed and it was comforting. Ignoring the slightly fading erection, he followed his soldier to the kitchen after putting his robe on, wrapping himself around his partner the same way he wrapped the dark silk around himself.
on the rolls, he was a self-made man. Sherlock couldn’t stop himself from asking, “Why a slave? You are well off and not unattractive or unintelligent. Your nurse was more than willing, I’m sure there are many others who would also be willing to satisfy whatever urges you say you need me for? Why a slave?”
Instead of dismay, Sherlock’s cheeks turned pink with pleasure, and a tiny smile hovered on his lips before he opened his laptop and began to type thunderously, “Stage one complete!” Sherlock was graciously allowing John’s comment to merely stand as a compliment to the chef and not a declaration of intent. John was grateful. The last thing he needed to do was create tension and awkwardness between them, not now, not during the holidays. “Tomorrow I am attempting bird bondage.”
Sherlock nodded. Carefully, he brought his arms up and clasped them loosely around John’s shoulder, since apparently, they were doing that now. John relaxed against him and just stood there, “Yes?”
It was full night again by the time John rose to consciousness. Sherlock was curled up by his side, his eyes only beginning to open. Groggily, John looked at the clock, “We’ve been asleep for eight hours now.”
“Mummy...” Sherlock began but he was cut off before he got further.
“Sherlock had just deduced that Mary was pregnant with Rosie. I was shocked in that one, but so was Mary.” John tried to feel worse, but he seemed to be at rock bottom already, so he shrugged, “I don’t know why I went through with the marriage, it wasn’t like I even actually proposed? It happened the night he came back but I never actually asked. A wedding made sense at the time, or at least, Mary made it sound like good sense. I wanted it, I wanted to get married. I had just spent years falling apart every single day. I needed someone who wanted to stay with me, who wanted to grow old with me, I needed… I loved Mary or thought I did. She was easy to be with, comforting. Our lives were so normal. She was funny. Smart. Clever. You couldn’t keep anything from her. She reminded me of…”
Two weeks later, Sherlock was shouting at the nursing staff, texting his brother, his mother, the prime minister, and even the Queen on one audacious occasion, ordering all of them to let him leave. “Stop it, Sherlock! You’re going to get arrested.” John snatched Sherlock’s mobile away but gave it back almost immediately when Sherlock made a sad face. He had no ability to deny his omega anything and he was so grateful that Sherlock was still with him that he had begun allowing his omega to indulge himself as much as Sherlock wanted. He even filtered who had visitation access, blocking people like Lestrade and even Molly, mainly because their visits immediately resulted in Sherlock trying to sneak off to the morgue or worse, to demand to be wheelchaired over to a crime scene so he could check things over.
John had wanted their first time to be tender and loving but instead it was animalistic and almost violent. Sherlock used his own hands to spread himself wider as John bucked into his body ferociously while the detective chanted affirmations in a deep baritone filled with eagerness. It was the most incredible sex John had ever had, completely unexpected, unanticipated, and brilliant. “John! John, ‘m close. John.”
What was wrong with his mental processes?
John Watson has been kidnapped in broad daylight right under the public eye.
John went to Sherlock’s wardrobe mirror and looked at himself, “I am fine.” His voice was a bit wooden.
Sherlock came in two hours later, “John, what are you doing?”
“Bear
He couldn’t even respond to her musings. None of the omegas he’d ever known was weak-willed, if anything, they were determined, professional, tireless, and focussed. He didn’t want to argue the point right then. Instead, he went to the loo to get some privacy. As he cleaned his abraded knuckles, John couldn’t help but admit to himself that he’d reacted poorly. He’d begged the universe so many times to return Sherlock to him, and now that it had, what had he done? He’d struck his friend in anger instead of marvelling at the miracle of his return. He hadn’t even asked Sherlock any useful questions, like, where he had been, how had he managed it, why had he done it, and obviously, how had he managed to disguise his omega nature for so long? John didn’t know which hidden truth hurt him more; Sherlock faking his death, or Sherlock hiding his true self from him. Sherlock hadn’t trusted John with any of his secrets and John felt so completely adrift because of it.
John just didn’t understand it. Why David was probably already done
“We’re going to find a murder to investigate?”
John was still down deep but managed to respond to the part of the unintentional command he’d been given that was within his scope, “These days, Anderson would likely be on the floor next to me, hoping that you’ll allow him to serve you as I would.”
“Will do, Sherlock, keep safe. We’ll miss you.” He shouldn’t have sent that last bit, not at all.
Sherlock was smiling down at him, “I know you don’t, John, and I’m very happy for it. Still, the coffee is very good, and please, never mention my brother’s arse for any reason ever again.”
with whomever you choose. It’s clear that what I might prefer is of no significance.” A gaping hole had appeared in front of Sherlock’s entire existence and he could feel the blackness of it drawing him in.

It turned out that having her favourite tenant bring by her favourite toddler
The woman was keening now, pinching her nipples with painted nails, her legs spread high and wide, toes pointed sharply as her orgasm built. John loved the way her body clenched down on his and rocked his hips in a way he knew would get her off. Only a couple minutes passed before she was groaning her way through what sounded like an amazing orgasm, and John sighed as he felt her body nearly milk an orgasm out of him. “Slow down, sweetheart,” he cautioned, “I’ve got all night.”
That made the alpha feel good for some reason. He was happy to have made Sherlock happy. He didn’t really understand what Sherlock’s goal was, so John made tea, handing Sherlock a cup before sitting himself down in his favourite chair to sip some time away, giving his mind time to process the information his newly awakened nose was giving him.
The moment Mycroft left, John helped Sherlock right out of the chair and right into bed. It felt decadently good to lay on his side upon his own luxurious bed. Mrs Hudson had clearly laundered everything. His duvet hadn’t been this fluffy and odourless since he purchased it, and his sheets were so crisp he half expected them to crackle. John let him sleep entirely naked, another decadence, and with a small smile, Sherlock dozed off right away even though it was barely noon. He woke three hours later with John by his side. Sherlock was grateful. Knowing John was always close by kept him steady and feeling safe. John continuing to watch over his sleep, even though they were finally home, only made Sherlock feel good.
“She has caused no trouble that we can find,” Mycroft hesitated.
don’t want
Sherlock didn’t consider himself so but apparently, Danny did. It made him feel warm inside to be admired. He accepted the compliment and the quick rub to his arse that Danny also provided, “Handsy!” Sherlock was surprised to feel his penis twitch with interest. Waking up in a tumescent state wasn’t something that happened to him very often, so he wasn’t sure how to interpret his body’s loud declaration of attraction versus his year’s old vow to keep personal matters above the waist.
and Anderson
“Don’t be a dick, Sherlock, John’s busy being a single parent
He knew he was just torturing himself, but John went to watch Sherlock’s presentation, abandoning the session he’d originally signed up for. It was fascinating. Sherlock was an excellent speaker, his voice imbuing each word with nuance and weight. John wasn’t the only one swept away, fully one-third of the audience was gazing at Sherlock raptly. John noted that
Anderson looked a bit worried as John spoke. The forensic specialist had changed a great deal since Sherlock had fallen. He had become obsessed with Sherlock, almost unhealthily so, but John didn’t judge him for that. If there was someone worth venerating, then Sherlock was a good choice. Anderson’s carefully assembled evidence had gone a long way in assisting Sherlock to clear his name and provided a path for him to return to London openly. “You okay, mate?” He seemed genuinely worried and went so far as to glare at Donovan when she snorted contemptuously.
, he went through hell and back to save you. Danny can’t measure up to that. Let Sherlock have this, let him have his lover, let him heal, and use this opportunity to show him the John Watson he fell in love with. Give it time, Johnny, but you have to be willing to sacrifice your pride, for once.”
“I can’t trust you, John.” Sherlock wouldn’t look at him.  He didn’t sound broken and confused the way he had before his heat. Sherlock sounded like himself, like the Sherlock he remembered from years past except with such personal pain in his voice. “You’ve hurt me physically and now you’ve just hurt me. Do I deserve this? Why?”
Sherlock was bored, and his bum hurt. He did as he was permitted, exploring the vast house alone, scrupulously inspecting every inch of it while remaining carefully distant from any area that looked like it might house a tenant. It was well-appointed, tasteful, and oddly sturdy. All the windows sported gorgeous treatments but only to hide the fact that there was no view. The few windows facing the street belong inside the rooms he wasn’t allowed in. All he could see when he opened the curtains was a brick wall.
Harry sat back and considered what she’d learned. She brewed tea this time, making John sip his with sugar for once though he normally didn’t bother sweetening it. “Okay, let me get this straight. Sherlock Holmes faked dying, for you?” John nodded. “He spent years running about the world taking down a global underground criminal organization, to protect you.” John nodded again. “He was tortured.” John nodded, a tear dripping down his cheek. “He came back to England for
in government? You pride yourself on knowing everything.”
“Of course, Billy. Mycroft, you heard him, make sure it happens.” Mycroft was the one rolling his eyes now, but he didn’t argue, merely making the request to whomever he was speaking with as if it had been his plan the entire time. John felt a bit dizzy since he hadn’t been engaged five minutes ago and now his wedding was practically upon them. It was Christmas Day, he would be marrying Sherlock in just under a week. He needed to sit down.
the stockings, which meant that Sherlock was also wearing the garter and possibly even the very tiny panties that went with them. John stared at Sherlock’s feet, and his knees weakened. It was all he could do to remain upright instead of sinking to the floor in order to absolutely worship the person in front of him. Sherlock’s hair was much fluffier than normal, his curls teased out into a gentle cloud. His lips were a tiny bit pinker, and his eyes ever so subtly highlighted and outlined. His cheeks were artfully redder, and John could see that Sherlock had even put mascara on, his lashes fanning above his cheeks distinctively as he looked down into his lap unfeigned bashfulness, “John.”
Sarah literally threw her hands in the air with frustration, “Fine. Stay tonight, but first thing tomorrow, forget about finding a new place to stay. You are being entirely idiotic. What you are going to do is go back to Baker Street and beg Sherlock on your hands and knees to take you back.” Her hands were on her hips as she shouted some more, “I can’t believe you, John! You two belong together, it’s obvious to anyone with eyes and a functioning nose! Even
“He looked terrified. He looked like he’d seen the most horrible thing ever, and it was me he was looking at!
Sherlock was angry, but he said and did nothing.

, Danny.” Sherlock said querulously, “I thought you preferred takeaway.”
Sherlock was biting his lower lip now, his cheeks aflame. “I could say the same.” Sherlock managed to flicker a glance at John, and in that moment, John saw all the passion and desire that Sherlock felt for him. It made him grin. Leaning forward, John held out his hand.
, is that it, John?”
Sherlock tossed and turned in the darkness. It felt strange to be in bed alone, he kept expecting to feel or hear John beside him, but his master wasn’t there. After a long while, he fell into a fitful sleep once more, and ghost kisses were pressed to his cheek and brow yet again. Sherlock opened his eyes but there was only the dimness of John’s room and no one else. He closed his eyes and could hear noise from outside the room. It was a steady beat, but it was growing faster and less rhythmic. Sherlock opened his eyes and peered around. He was still alone in John’s room, the bedding soaked with sweat. He felt ill again and wondered if he should be going to the loo before he made a mess of the sheets.
“Maybe, John, but if I’ve learned anything in the last five years it's that waiting until later never works out for me.” Sherlock began to pull away, “Unless your answer is no. I understand, John. I’m not female. I’m strange and odd, especially for an omega. You’ve told people for years that we aren’t a couple. Perhaps I’ve made an error, only, I did the calculations, I ran my tests. I have empirical proof that I would satisfy one hundred percent of your omega expectations. I didn’t think to factor in what I see now see as an unwillingness to give up your heterosexual ways, even if I am technically considered a female, being an omega and having a womb.”
“I wanted your gumdrop buttons in my mouth. You taste so sweet.” John could once again see the frosting he wanted so desperately, hungrily attempting to drop to his knees once more.
mental imagery detailing exactly how that ship had sailed.
Molly nodded, “Good. That’s good. Off you go, Sherlock, enjoy your
Sherlock understood that he previously had an insatiable curiosity and a very scientific approach to life; once he knew that recreational drugs were available, he made a very comprehensive effort to experience them all. He’d been making inroads on his comparative analyse when he’d been arrested for the last time, and not even his older brother and all his hidden power could rescue him from himself.
being out of control like this but he just couldn’t stop it any longer. There was too much there, too large a strain had grown over time. He had to release it somehow or be torn apart forever.  “It’s okay, gorgeous. It will all be okay, I promise. He’s coming back to you, I swear, I swear, I swear.” Danny kissed Sherlock’s face all over, “I know this was hard, beautiful, but John’s not going to get it through his head unless it hurts. He’s obviously even more of an idiot than you are, utterly hopeless, the pair of you. You deserve each other.”
You tried to tell me, and I would not listen. If I had, perhaps...” Sherlock stopped himself there.
“Hello!” Doctor Coates checked his charts once more, then checked Sherlock himself, taking his blood-pressure, examining his bruises, and inspecting his limbs, “Let’s get you standing, then, shall we?”
Harry looked around, “Where’s Sherlock? I read in the papers that it was his birthday. Are you two out getting smashed? What is going on, John?”
(See the end of the chapter for
. Sherlock speculated further. Donovan said John had sold all his things.
However, it had gotten in there, Sherlock now knew the best ways to orally pleasure his lover, his brain providing all the right information at all the right moments. John made the most astonished sounds, he begged and made reckless promises, he cried out, and his legs shook. Sherlock found his lover’s responsiveness to be a heady rush, and with a deep happy groan, did everything he could to make John’s orgasm mind-blowing.
“I fantasized about doing this for him, of giving him this. I don’t want to pretend though. I don’t mind that it’s you, I’m glad in fact. I want to do this to you and I want you to tell me everything you like until I can do this better than anyone alive,” Danny looked a bit glazed and unfocused as he fed his cock to Sherlock, his thumb tenderly tracing the outline of Sherlock’s now taut lips. They groaned as he intimately rubbed the roof of Sherlock’s mouth, slid over his tongue, and bumped the back. Sherlock found the overload of sensations to be extremely pleasing, liking the way it felt to stretch his jaw, curious as to how different it would taste and feel without the condom, and suddenly wondered what the feel of semen sliding down his throat would be like. He’d have to find out some day. Doubling his efforts, Sherlock moaned as he eagerly fellated Danny, completely focused on his task. It was unfortunate that this was the moment John decided to drop by unexpectedly.
She was gorgeous and tight, but sooner than he appreciated, the feeling of being inside her cunt wasn’t doing it for him, “How much for anal?”
efforts because the airing closet had sweetly scented and freshly laundered linen waiting, or perhaps Mycroft had arranged for some things to be waiting. John didn’t ponder too deeply on it, just working hard to make Sherlock’s personal environment as comfortable and welcoming as possible. John remembered to line the mattress with a liquid-repelling sheet before topping it with a dense absorbent pad. Heats were messy, and he didn’t want to spend the next four days changing sheets every three hours.
“Well, I seem to be gestating.” John stopped what he was doing and stared at his mate. Sherlock’s grin was wild and almost feral once more.
Except for
She was right to feel uncomfortable as well as confused. John himself couldn’t articulate his issues nor formulate the questions he needed to ask. He sighed, his shoulder’s slumping, “Can I sleep here tonight? I’ll start looking for a flat tomorrow.” He’d have to arrange for another dismal bedsit. The chances of finding another flat on short notice were almost zero.
John cut him off and shouted,
, and never be within spitting distance of me ever again.”
“He has a girlfriend to speak to. Let him call her.” Sherlock was in no mood to be reasonable or accommodating with John Watson.
John’s face did a complicated display of feelings. He looked excited, dismayed, eager, and reluctant all at the same time, and once again, Sherlock marvelled at his abilities. John was incredible. He was the only person Sherlock knew that he had never tired of. “I want…” John trailed off, “Gods, yes, I want that too but, honestly, I’m more worried about accidentally triggering you.”
“I don’t care, wear your ratty pyjamas if you want. We’re going out today and we’re doing things. Up. Come on. Up up up.” John managed to get Sherlock moving against his will and despite his insistence that he wasn’t going to, Sherlock got properly dressed. After drinking their tea and having two biscuits each, John rushed Sherlock out of the flat. “You’re going to love this.”
“Help is already nearly there, John, three minutes out,” Mycroft sounded shaken and more than a little helpless, “Do whatever you need to do to keep him alive. We will meet you at the hospital, specialists will be waiting for you.” John wasn’t paying attention. He was too busy trying to stop Sherlock from bleeding out. His hand covered the small hole and he pressed down hard. Sherlock was breathing but it was stuttering and irregular. His eyes were closed, and his skin was already grey with shock. John fought back the hysteria that attempted to overwhelm him.
A muscle in Sherlock’s jaw worked as he pressed his own lips into a flat line. He seemed to be struggling to stop himself but speaking, but lost, “You are suffering from depression. Knowing you, you have refused to follow the advice of your therapist, and likely your doctors as well. You have accepted medication, but not the ones that would properly address your problems. Instead, you mask the symptoms and ignore the issue. Why?”
John felt a curl of justified guilt build up inside his gut. It settled in right beside the pain that had been there for two years, the one that was now attached to the strange heat he’d been feeling in his chest all evening. He knew what remorse tasted like now and began to wonder if there was any way of taking back what he had done and doing things right the proper way, “I am sorry, Sherlock. Instead of being grateful for your return I was awful, worse than awful. I swear I won’t hurt you again. I want to check you over, to make sure you’re all right.”
Mary then tried to joke with him about shaving, but John could hear the edge in her words. For the entire time they’d known one another, John had been rebuilding himself from the hollowed-out shell of grief he’d been when they’d met. Facial hair had been a part of that process, clearly, not a successful one. John tried to deny it out loud but even he knew how obvious it was that he was shaving for Sherlock Holmes. Mary’s smile had dropped away when he’d finally emerged from the bathroom, his face smooth and clean, the years that had sat upon his features mere minutes ago now a hard-to-recall memory.
“Same.” John was there to do a presentation as well, though he doubted he’d draw even half the crowd that Sherlock would. His discussion about effective report writing and field notes while on cases wasn’t going to be anywhere near as exciting as learning how to tease out solid information from the smallest of clues during an investigation. He looked at his unopened itinerary and checked. They were both slated to present on the same day, John in the morning, and Sherlock in the afternoon, both in the same large theatre. “I didn’t expect to see...”
. We never thought we’d see such a thing either, after all, omega are known for being indiscriminate sluts, just dripping holes begging to be bred. That’s all you are, Sherlock Holmes, a walking container for alpha spunk. You might think my cock is small but when you are stuck on my knot, you’ll think differently.”
“Captain.” John’s voice was cold and harsh.
, as she’s stated many times by now,” he answered, “John has been engaging in a relationship with her in secret for an undetermined amount of time. I only learned of it today. I have left John and am temporarily residing in one of Mycroft’s houses.”
There was a moment of silence as Mycroft checked these facts on his computer. “I see.” His tone was all the damning evidence Sherlock needed to know that he was correct in his assessment. “I’m...I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
Sherlock showed off, using his skills at deduction to charm the man one more time, “The name’s Sherlock Holmes, and the address is 221 B Baker Street.” He winked as he left, not missing the crooked smile on his soldier’s face. This was going to be so good. Life was never going to be boring ever again. Making a note to stop by the clinic for a blood test, and the store to get condoms and lube, Sherlock whistled cheerfully as he directed the move into his new flat, certain that his soldier would come to him no matter what.
“It’s our wedding and believe me when I tell you that your mum is going to agree with me. You’ve got a year’s notice to find someone to spend our special day with.”
Sherlock was deeply moved by John’s declaration, especially when they arrived. This was a significant moment for Sherlock, literally the first step in overcoming the dark images that he’d been trapped in for so long. In the nightmare, Baker Street had been made of formless shadows, a mere hint of the vibrant neighbourhood that existed in reality. Speedy’s was doing brisk business as John guided him inside their entryway, and for once, Mycroft carried in Sherlock’s and John’s small suitcases himself instead of making his driver do it, “The therapists we’ve chosen will be expecting you as soon as tomorrow afternoon at 2 PM. My car will bring you there if you require it.”
“Oh please, yes daddy, I want that. I’m clean daddy, swear, I’m clean. I get checked regularly, I never have unprotected sex, but I will for you. Breed me, daddy, fill me up.” Sherlock was almost appalled with himself.
“He’s lucky to have someone with such good taste.” Without hesitating, Kieran rang the item up, carefully folding it into tissue paper and boxing it before putting it into a large shopping bag, “Will that be all?”
“That you want me?”
John suddenly began jerking with irregular thrusts, moaning shamelessly. His already too big cock suddenly seemed to widen and then Sherlock yelped as he felt salty semen being rubbed into the microtears of his anus, “It
Sherlock became instantly enamoured of the idea of John allowing him liberties like hugs, or maybe even cuddles on the couch if that wasn’t dreaming of too much. Perhaps John wouldn’t mind sitting with an arm about Sherlock’s shoulder on cold nights, or maybe, just maybe, John would allow Sherlock to rub his sore shoulders when John’s war wound ached from fatigue or the weather? What about more, what about…nakedness and friction and contact?
They both had issues to deal with, and that was just how their lives had played out. The balance they had once given one other was no longer there.
Sherlock swallowed the lump in his throat.
for his child.
John’s face was unaccountably gentle, “No, you really don’t. I knew you weren’t…quite the same as me, but it wasn’t my business. You never spoke about it and I wasn’t going to pry. I’ve always known something was off, but until you decided to tell me yourself, I wasn’t going to snoop around. You have your reasons, I’m sure.”
need to talk. This isn’t a good place to do so. Would you...John? Please, would you just come with me someplace a little more private?”
“We know where we stand with one another,” Sherlock shrugged before continuing, “Even if you could put Alex out of your mind and move forward somehow, which I doubt, I could never be a part of your life, not for long.”
Sherlock smiled, wrapping his arms around the strong man in front of him, “Happy Christmas, John.”
“You could say that.” The man nudged Sherlock, “I’m Danny.” He held a hand out to shake, his smile open and welcoming. Something inside of Sherlock perked up and took greater notice of the proceedings.
Waking up was nightmarish. His head throbbed and his stomach felt sloshy and his bum felt like it wasn’t working properly. His legs certainly weren’t. His entire body felt at odds with itself. By the time he’d struggled to sit up he’d woken John. Too much drink didn’t agree with the doctor either, he looked a bit green. Sherlock knew he was awake but John stubbornly refused to open his eyes. Sherlock was going to make a mocking remark but it suddenly became urgent to have a bit of a shout down the bog. John nearly pushed him out the door the moment he was done and had his own loud moment.
had an abundance of family as well as other friends to celebrate with during the holidays. They hadn’t discussed it. There was no point in discussion when it was so obvious. Sherlock knew that John would be leaving, probably until the New Year had arrived, off to somewhere quaint and homey, and surrounded by kith and kin.
One hour later he was sitting on the familiar Lilo and holding a steaming cup of tea. Sarah sat on a plush chair, her back straight, and her face calm. John noticed the ring on her finger even as he scented her pregnancy on the air. A bit of a mark was showing above her robe collar, confirming what he’d sensed. Sarah was mated, expecting, and married to boot. “Carl is at work for another six hours, so you can sleep here until then. He’s not going to be happy to smell that you’ve been here, so you’d better be straight with me. What’s going on, John?”
“It’s a little place I know. The owners owe me a favour.” Against his will, John’s mouth quirked into a fond smile for a moment.
Mycroft sent a car and gifted them with his absence. John wrote all the necessary scripts for Sherlock’s recovery and found a chemist who filled them. The driver had presented John with a credit card in Mycroft’s name, and with that, the doctor purchased all the items necessary. With the same card, John shopped for groceries and necessities, filling the capacious car-boot to the top with everything they could possibly need.
Lestrade leaned in, “What’s happened?” Obviously, the DI wasn’t asking about what Sherlock had undergone during his absence.
Sherlock’s mien turned guilty because John was more than a little ripe and quite wrinkly to boot. The detective pulled his sheet up a bit higher to cover the large bandage on his chest and looked around. He was seated in his bed surrounded by the detritus of his daily life, every surface of his private room covered in laptops, newspapers, magazines, get well cards, and take-out containers of Sherlock’s various meals. “He eats. He sleeps.”
John rolled his eyes but for the first time all day, he smiled easily. “
Danny had nothing to move in apart from his messenger bag, so Mrs Hudson took Rosie to get her ready for bed while Sherlock showed his new flatmate around the building, “My room is down there, the shower is across the hall, the kitchen is for experiments, so please,
John checked the flat and emailed a shopping list to Mycroft. It was extravagant, but John wanted to be as equipped as possible for all eventualities. Even in the best of circumstances, heats could go wrong, and right now, Sherlock was nowhere near being at his best. He was too thin, too wounded, too mentally unstable to be able to take the stress that he could not avoid, and it was up to John to consider every potential issue before it happened. While he waited for delivery, he drew Sherlock a hot bath, “I’m going to the kitchen to clean the refrigerator. If you need my help, call out. I’m going to ask you to say, ‘I’m okay’ every minute or so, just in case you pass out. I don’t want you to drown in the bath. How embarrassing would that be after all you’ve overcome?”
It was blissfully easy to tell Danny about John, and in return, Sherlock got to hear about Alex. Sherlock liked the sounds of him, clearly Alex was intelligent, clever, and resourceful, all traits Sherlock found admirable. Hours went by as both men unburdened themselves to one another, and by the time they were unable to speak any further, Sherlock was the one holding Danny tight, wiping his tears away, and brushing soothing kisses against his curls, “You really loved him.”
John opened his eyes. Sherlock stood before him looking like a drowned rat. His curls were certainly plastered over his skull, but it didn’t look sensual or erotic. Sherlock looked blue-lipped and he was clearly shivering.
John was holding him up, his strong arms keeping Sherlock tight against, him, his dear head tucked beneath Sherlock’s chin.
Sherlock cut him off, pushing John’s hand away firmly. The heat from his touch lingered, and Sherlock could feel every ridge and bump from John’s fingers as if their impression had burned into his skin, making the scar beneath the fabric itch. The heat of it sank beneath his ribcage and wrapped itself around his heart. Forcing himself to ignore it, Sherlock said, “He’s my
daddies he’d bedded, this one was obviously not going to want to fuck him if he were underage. Sherlock told him the truth, “I’m nineteen.”
. “Yes, Captain.”
and being concerned for him.
“Hate to eat and run, John. I’m going to have a quick shower and clean up before we must go. Dinner was spectacular, I’m not kidding. Thanks.”
. He was re-reading a book
“John is gone!” Sherlock was shouting. It had been five days since he and Danny had left to go investigate leads in Scotland and four and a half days since Mycroft sent a helicopter to bring them directly back, retrieving them the moment they tried to check into their hotel room. Sherlock felt ill when he watched the footage of John being hauled off the Tube, and the grainy image of the vehicle he’d been dumped in to. All the angles were wrong, the car parked just outside of the effective range of the various cameras. Careful planning had gone into the abduction and only Mycroft’s unceasing surveillance had caught it so early. There were few leads to follow since there wasn’t much to go on. “No one has made demands, there are no clues to follow, there is absolutely nothing, Danny! I need to find John! He doesn’t know about how I feel! What if someone has killed him? What if they’re hurting him? He could be brainwashed. What if someone sold him on the flesh markets? What if he’s being raped right now? Danny, I have to find John!”
when you blush, I told you I was going to set records making you do so.” Danny pecked Sherlock on the cheek quickly before he stood up, “It won’t even be a problem, we’ll just make sure to use the bedroom for all of that. John? I could murder a cup of tea. Mind if I go make us some?”
Sherlock saw neither item, and he felt cold inside.
The room smelled ripe, and Sherlock knew that they both reeked of stale sweat and ejaculate. It wasn’t horrible but it was more powerful than he expected, “Carry me.”
. The door clicked quietly shut and Sherlock walked quickly away. He just needed to find a little something to sooth his frayed nerves. The streets all looked the same but after three or four blocks, he came across a small hole-in-the-wall shop that was still open. The golden glow of the shop’s lights cut into the dimness of the night, but only a bit. Sherlock had to argue with the man behind the window before he got what he needed.
, and his smile dropped away.
Mrs Hudson wept with shocked happiness and John felt ill.
“I know, I’m terrible that way. I just really love a good arse and yours is spectacular. They both laughed, and Sherlock made no attempt to remove Danny’s hand from his buttock. It felt nice to have someone kneading and handling it. Danny was rather attractive, in his own way, and Sherlock surprised himself by leaning in to kiss those smiling lips, “Feed me, Sherlock, before I go searching for
Sherlock found he hated it. He hated having John there whenever he felt ill or when the doctor provided exactly the tablets he needed exactly when he needed them. He despised the foods that John prepared for him to eat, always things he found tolerable, and knowing he needed sustenance, managed to consume. He loathed finding his bed neatly remade after he managed to have a brief shower, and it infuriated him to discover his clothes neatly laundered and returned to their proper locations, ready for his use whenever he might require it. Even his sock-index was spot on. John was flawless. There was no need to say a word about his care, and they spoke of nothing else. Their days often went by without their mutual silence broken, though John made sure Sherlock’s laptop was always charged, and that his mobile was ready at any given moment, so he could at least read online and catch up with research papers he’d been meaning to get to.
He felt disgusted with himself.
A man seated up front was speaking into a mobile, “Field specimen acquired. Reaction time exactly as anticipated. The subject will arrive as scheduled.” The second he was inside the vehicle his brain gave up all efforts to learn more about what was happening because John blacked out completely.
Sherlock’s grin was toothy in a way John had never witnessed before. He felt a frisson of lust rush through his nether regions when he recognised the predatory leer being directed right at him, “You know I’m a scientist, John, any claims you make will have to be consistently repeated before I can verify them as fact.”
who was foolish enough to believe that the person I was sleeping with was interested in being exclusive. Silly of me, I see that now. Completely irrational of me, in fact.” He knew he was being dramatic, but he didn’t care.
“We haven’t
John couldn’t help himself, all his reactions were instinctive, “I’m going to help you.” He kissed the top of Sherlock’s head and rubbed his back. Sherlock melted into him even more, his body calming as his thoughts slowed, “There we go, love, I’m here, I’m here my darling,” Sherlock was limp and unresisting now. He sagged back onto his big brother and allowed himself to be set on the edge of the mattress. Sherlock’s eyes were glazed and blank, his face expressionless. He stared out the window and didn’t even seem to recognise that Mycroft was helping John ease off his clothing, leaving him in his pants and socks. John was horrified at what he saw. Not only was Sherlock’s face bruised from John the night before, and not only was there a new bump and a cut on his scalp from the alpha from earlier, but John was devastated to witness the patchwork of pus-filled and infected wounds that covered his back. “What happened?”
“Don’t be like that with yourself, Sherlock.” John kissed Sherlock’s forehead, “You deserve to know how beautiful you are, how clever you are, how amazing you are. Not enough people tell you, but from now on, I will.” John made sure Sherlock could see him clearly, “I love you. I’m going to spend the rest of my life letting you feel that. You’ll never have to doubt me, not about anything. I am one hundred percent devoted to making you happy.”
John was flabbergasted, “What?” John had no clue how Sherlock had arrived at this deduction, “Sherlock, where did this come from?”
Mrs Hudson was entirely taken with him. “It’s lovely that Sherlock made a friend, and such an attractive one,” she winked, “He does seem to move in with them quite quickly, why John only took a day.”
“Jim told you to just finish the doctor, you should have followed orders. Now the boss is on us again.”
Carefully, he cleaned his plate of the meal his sister had provided, took up his baby, and put her to bed, reading book after book to her until she was hard asleep. Finally, John went back out to face Harry. “She’s out.”
“So, what was it? Heroin or cocaine?”
Sherlock was eager as well as uncertain. He knew he wanted this with John, but he had no basis of comparison with which to judge what was happening to him. John seemed to read his worries off his face, for once being the one who knew first. “I won’t do anything to hurt you, nothing that makes you uncomfortable.”
John trailed in after him, “Turn me off? Are you insane? You’re the sexiest person I’ve ever seen, Sherlock, your arse is just…wow, and your hair, oh my god, the way your skin looks so pale but your scars are like stories, and I just…I…I, um…are you sad?” John sounded a bit muddled now.
John took a deep breath and let it out slowly, “It’s a directive from the higher-ups, can’t see how we can rightfully ignore the summons.” A tiny twinge grew in his belly but he suppressed any outward reaction.
Sherlock panicked. He tried to jerk away from his owner, but he could barely move. Weakly, he mewled in abject terror, scraping his arms against the sides of the bed to remove the things poking into his arms, to rid himself of the wrappings that covered his whole body.
John wasn’t sure if he should believe the stranger, except, he was obviously a prisoner too. “How long have I been here? What kind of tests?” John swallowed hard and quickly inspected himself as best he could, running his hands over his body and trying to determine if anything felt different or odd. He found it when he touched the scar on his shoulder, the one that had cost him two careers with a single shot. There was a new bump, an injection site. “What is it?”
“Sherlock!” Despite his concerns, John didn’t hesitate to come right over. Carefully, he covered one of Sherlock’s hands with his, “Don’t move, Sherlock. You’re recovering from serious burns as well as some other rather unpleasant injuries. You’re here, in London. You’re safe.”
In the few moments they permitted themselves a private life, all they allowed were extended embraces. Sherlock didn’t want sex, but Danny didn’t seem to mind only sleeping in his bed. They cuddled, but not as much as they had before John had gone missing. Watson was being cared for by a large contingent of people, mostly Molly, who had volunteered her time. Harry and her ex-wife had been sent off into protective custody, both protesting, but Sherlock was adamant. He would protect the last of John’s family with his life, if necessary. Keeping Watson with him was safest, even Harry agree, so Mycroft had arranged for a leave of absence for the pathologist and brought her on staff as the official nanny/forensic specialist. Rosie adored Molly, and Danny noted that Sherlock was a lot more relaxed when he knew the toddler was in the care of someone he trusted. It was all very well that the many security layers of their support team had been twice vetted, but Sherlock didn’t know any of them personally, and even if he had, the ghost of Mary Morstan reminded him that he was far from infallible when it came to identifying a foe up close. It helped that Molly understood how Sherlock worked and was more than capable of providing information in a way Sherlock wouldn’t have a problem with.
Sherlock went to his false front house at Lauriston Gardens and sat in the same spot John had sat in when Sherlock had exposed Mary for the fake she was.
people for a living. Mary was still doing it when she was pregnant!” Harry reeled back, horrified. John looked at her imploringly, “She shot Sherlock. I didn’t know about any of it until much later.”
the first night we slept together. You are just the worst in bed. I didn’t even come for the first three months we had sex, that’s how useless you are as a shag.”
, Doctor Watson. After the funeral, Sherlock began to chase down everyone who had even the slightest connection to James Moriarty, destroying the web that had been spun. It took him a year and a half to complete the task, but just as he was coming home, Sherlock was discovered by a criminal organisation who decided to exact retribution against him for no more reason than that they could. It took weeks before I found where they had hidden him, and more weeks before I was able to go in myself and retrieve him. In that time, I can’t fully say what happened to him. His only motivation was coming back to you, he asked after you endlessly. I didn’t have the heart to tell him that you had moved on.”
His knot ached. He needed the pressure of Sherlock’s lovely body to sate his needs so he took it. Savagely, John drove deeper still into Sherlock’s opening, forcing the wide solid ring of flesh past the omega’s sphincters, ignoring Sherlock’s sudden struggle to flee and attempt to push John from his body. With a slick sucking sound, his knot did its duty, tying their bodies together as John’s bollocks were emptied of one thick shot of come after another. He jerked and spewed semen for several minutes, his far more than he normally ejaculated. John’s head snapped forward of its own accord as soon as he began to come, and he sank his teeth as second time into Sherlock’s already abused neck. Sherlock screamed in a way John had never heard before and all his rational thought came surging back as their bond slipped into place.
They had to leave London at an unreasonable point of the morning in order to arrive at Mummy’s townhouse at the insisted upon time. They were met at the door by Mummy herself, resplendent in her festive clothing, and both men were immediately swept into a hard and lingering embrace, “Sherlock, my little angel, and John, I am so glad you are both here.”
“You sure, love? I don’t want to
Sherlock Holmes stood stiffly in front of John Watson for the first time in years. The consulting detective tried to hide the fact that he had been thrown by the accidental meet, but John knew him too well to miss the lightning-quick flicker of shock, hurt, loneliness, want, and then finally, deliberate blankness, “John.”
John nodded, his face serious, “I want to make it right, somehow.”
roared Sherlock, “Look at
Danny looked at the expression on Sherlock’s face. The detective spoke with determined certainty, and when Danny nodded, Sherlock relaxed a tad but went right back to work. Danny came up behind him, wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s torso and kissed his shoulder, “Good enough.” Danny released Sherlock and went over to the filing cabinet that Sherlock had picked open. Both men were wearing nitrile gloves, so Danny began to carefully comb through the hard-copies of records, looking for items that Sherlock said were valuable and photographing each one carefully. Sherlock had a portable hard-drive and was copying every digital record he could locate, erasing his trail after he was done. After Danny closed the cabinet, both men went over every book in they could locate, seeking notes or any other clue to help them on their way. When every nook and cranny had been thoroughly investigated, they left as silently as they had arrived, reactivating the security system so that no trace of them remained. That night, they visited four different places.
“As you wish, John. I’ve arranged for a grocery delivery service. Mrs Hudson can sign for it if you are not here, but be aware, they will be bringing food right to your kitchen and stowing it away for you. Please pay back their courtesy by not having anything too untoward on display?”
Confused once more but filled with well-whetted hunger, Sherlock managed to let himself sleep.
, struggled every minute to relate to his only child. Their family time together usually ended up as Rosie playing by herself while John lost himself online. That had never been his goal. John wanted her to know that she was cared for, protected, loved, and he couldn’t seem to manage. Sherlock did so effortlessly, watching her with patient attentiveness, responding to her every need gracefully, and like everything else, it made John furious.
know, he couldn’t leave Sherlock’s side. When they arrived at the hospital, the staff kept him close to his omega, garbing him in surgical scrubs and gloves so that he could join the surgeon in the theatre to remain next to Sherlock. Everyone knew that mated pairs healed dramatically better when they weren’t separated, and since Sherlock had a bite-mark on his neck, none of the doctors or nurses questioned John’s status as his bond-mate. The fact that he would not move away and growled ferociously at anyone who seemed to even suggest that he might leave, encouraged the medical staff to keep him where he was.
Sherlock frowned, “John?” John simply knelt there, unable to move even an inch. “Mycroft, he’s gone all funny, and not in an amusing way. What is happening?”
“I love you, John.”
“Seriously, John,” Sherlock twisted his head up to look at John, “It’s not the worst fetish to have, I’m hardly the only person in the world who prefers their bedmates to be...fun-sized.”
“You look incredible.” John was in a daze. Without thinking it through, he leaned over and pressed a kiss to Sherlock’s carefully powdered cheek, “Just perfect.”
John didn’t want to remember Eurus but he did and without meaning to, he shuddered. “Yes, Mrs Holmes.”
John blinked, momentarily stunned. Shock gave way to anger, “I have not! I’ve been ill, that’s all, I have a bad stomach, nothing my medication can’t fix. I’ve got my scripts with me.”
My love. John’s heart felt like it was filled to bursting with this unexpected gift, “I love you too, sweetheart. Merry Christmas, Sherlock.” John knew they’d be okay. There was going to be rough moments for sure, but now at least he knew what Sherlock truly needed to get past them, and John was more than willing to be there for anything else that might be required. This was the happiest day of his life, “Merry Christmas.”
Sherlock gripped John’s arm, “Please, John, hear me out.” John could not directly refuse Sherlock anything still, so he didn’t struggle. He stood there, passively attentive so Sherlock spoke, “I have made many selfish and arrogant choices in the last few years, John. I allowed you to believe I was dead because I presumed it was the best way to keep you safe. Instead, you suffered endlessly, and I did not know. I deliberately did not check on you because I was more concerned about how my separation from you affected me and did not consider enough how your separation from me would affect you.”

“Sherlock!” John set his husband down, kissing him hard on the mouth before dropping to his knees to kiss his still flat belly, “A baby.”
Sherlock trusted John, that’s why they were here now. Sherlock had never trusted someone the way he trusted John. John knew Sherlock and liked him. His hands on Sherlock’s body were warm, they grounded him in the moment. He looked into John’s eyes, “If we do this, I’ll never settle for less again, not ever.” Sherlock felt that fair warning was required before they irrevocably changed their relationship. Right now a few kisses could be excused but not more. It was up to John to decide.
Sherlock must have won the game. He deserved this then, and that was good because it felt so nice. “You’re so tight, Sherlock, my cock is barely going to fit. I’m going to split you in two. I’m going to fuck you so deep, and so hard. I’m going to come in you, Sherlock. Has anyone done that? I want to see my come leak out of this tight little arsehole. It’s beautiful. I can’t wait to put my prick in there. I can’t wait to make you come on it. I’m going to fuck you so good, Sherlock.”
Sherlock realized he was trapped only after he was finished his tea. He tried to retain a calm exterior but inside he was in full panic mode. It was a magic spell, he could feel it in his bones.
Sherlock found it very relaxing as whoever it was cleaned the sleep from his lashes. As soon as the touches stopped, Sherlock slowly allowed his eyes to open, lifting and turning his head toward the voice as he looked for the first time, a soft smile of gratitude on his face. The smile dropped away as pure horror and shock jolted him when he recognised the person tending him.
“I really think that you aren’t, not after you hear my plans.”
“I just wish you’d consider a better alternative.” Sherlock’s hands balled up into fists and at first, John thought Sherlock was going to physically lash out but then he saw how ashen Sherlock was. His friend was nearly swaying on the spot, and an expression of absolute terror and helplessness were taking over. “John?” John recognized all the signs and berated himself once again. Sherlock was going to have a panic attack that John had unthinkingly induced.
her and was likely enjoying a glass of the expensive whiskey that John had noticed in the cupboard but had not purchased. Suddenly, he was angry again.
“I know, my dearest, I know you are and you’re doing so well. I’m very proud of you.” Mycroft was taller than Sherlock, so it was very easy to put his head on his brother’s shoulder and weep. “Let it out, love, let it all out. I’m here. We’re here for you.”
John flushed with shame again, recalling the thoughts he’d had only the evening before. He couldn’t deny it, “I’m sorry. You’re right. I am an animal. Why should you trust me now when you obviously never have?” John felt bitter but also broken inside. He’d managed to bollox things up entirely with Sherlock, “I’ll go, Sherlock, as soon as the supplies are here. I don’t know why you bothered to come to the restaurant tonight if you don’t want me near you? I’m offensive to you.”
It was closed. This was the business end of town and on Sunday afternoon, nothing was open. There was nought but silence and it was ominous. John helped Sherlock stagger to the alley where they squeezed themselves into a refrigerator box wedged between two bins, hiding from whoever was looking for them. John pulled together some restaurant debris, stacking up veg boxes and empty oil tins until they were obscured by what seemed to be a perfectly legitimate pile of rubbish. Sherlock got his phone out, “Mycroft, we’ve been ambushed.” He rattled off their location, “It’s her, I’m certain of it.”
“No, you aren’t.” Sherlock seemed offended that John would say such a thing. “No, you are perfect, my John, perfect for me.”
, they were removed, and he was further allowed to comb the entire building for clues. He was slow and careful, ponderous compared to how he’d previously examined a scene. Sherlock didn’t trust his instincts, not anymore. He gathered evidence, and spoke his thoughts out loud, making someone else verify facts before he grudgingly tendered his hypothesis.
“Just a baby,” said his father wistfully, “Still practically a child.”
“Dinner?” Sherlock realized that he was mirroring Irene’s hopeless advances and felt despondent but helpless to stop himself. His chest felt tight and his cheeks felt hot but not with excitement or interest. Sherlock felt possessive and angry, and he didn’t know how to manage it all.
“Are you suggesting that my feet
Dutifully, John dug out Sherlock’s sleepwear and obligingly changed into his own, fetching his clothes from upstairs. Sherlock frowned at that. John had essentially moved into Sherlock’s room, and had kept his belongings mixed in with his lover’s. Sherlock pulled open the wardrobe and then the dresser drawers. Both were empty. “Tomorrow we will put everything back where it belongs.”
. How is your sign language?”
“I’m okay, John.”
was in perilous danger. John could not let it stay that way. It was the doctor’s fence to mend and mend it he would. John could feel himself sitting straighter now, digging into his food with determination.
. Mrs Hudson hadn’t said a word to John or Sherlock about their new lives, simply cleaning around them as if both men were just statues that she chattered at and left platefuls of tiny biscuits out for. Suddenly Sherlock had an impression that he and John were very like Mrs Hudson’s pets. Some people kept strange or exotic animals, but she maintained a pair of highly dangerous and unstable madmen, never afraid that they’d do her a bit of harm personally, and simply mothering them ceaselessly whenever they were home long enough. It was a bit disconcerting to think about, and he couldn’t quite rid his mind palace of the concept.
couldn’t deal with all the conflicting and fast-changing feelings he was having.
“You’d better, you ridiculous cock. Sherlock deserves the best you can be.” John grew silent as her worlds moved him once again. Sherlock did deserve the best, and from now on, John would be the

. He couldn’t say the last two words.
this now. It’s working.”
, so much better than you did the last time I saw you, and if Danny is responsible for that, then that’s good enough for me.”
“A what?”
. John was helpless against him. Every word that had come from the strange man’s mouth hit its target inside of John, and he knew there was nothing to say in his own defence. He was despicable. Faithless. Useless. He was a greedy vulgar selfish cretin with no moral high ground available to him that was strong enough to refute the agonizing comments he’d been levelled. When he’d first arrive, John had been filled with possessive red rage, and the desire to obliterate the new man with every dirty trick in his considerable militant arsenal, but he hadn’t lifted a finger, nor said a word, to defend himself.
“No, this is perfect, John!” Harry looked excited, “Go back to Baker Street.”
Both men collapsed at the same time. Sherlock no longer had the physical strength to do more than to lay face-down on the bed with John gasping for air on top of him. John’s head was between Sherlock’s shoulder blades, and every heated breath was making Sherlock sweat even more. He didn’t say a word.
He quietly knocked on Mrs Hudson’s door, his hand shaking as he did so, “Sherlock? I heard raised voices. What is going on? Is it a client? Do I need to call the police?”
“You’re so hot. I want you to melt in my mouth.”
He made direct eye contact with the man in question, and then Sherlock pointedly wiped the mess of saliva from his face. He was still hard and now he was extremely irritated that he’d gotten only a small way into his first blow-job before John ruined it. “This is

be arsed to call for takeaway, but nothing could make him go downstairs to retrieve it. John would do it, crankily extracting folding cash from Sherlock’s own wallet to pay for a tip, just to annoy Sherlock, which it didn’t. The doctor was welcome to all of Sherlock’s money, especially if it meant that he didn’t need to deal with annoying things like paying bills or queuing up at the bank to cash cheques from clients. John just rolled his eyes and huffed impatiently, grousing his way back and forth through their little world, cleaning up after Sherlock and occasionally breaking people a bit if the occasion required it. Really, he was quite perfect as a partner and a friend and Sherlock repaid him that connection by keeping John’s heart racing and his reflexes keen. Whenever John was in a bit of a mood, Sherlock made certain to steer them toward a decent punch-up or other adrenaline rousing activity, just to keep his soldier content. John’s needs coincided beautifully with Sherlock’s likes, so really, he was keeping them both happy.
is right! Why did he begin dating this person? Why did he take her to places that were special to him and I? Why did he choose to lie, choose to cheat, why? Why bother taking up with me if he had no intentions of being faithful. John knew me, or I thought he did. I cannot tolerate this. I won’t. I just...won’t. It’s all or nothing, Mycroft. Either my lover is mine alone, or I am alone. There are no half-measures, no in-betweens. It’s...I am who I am, brother. I’ve never sought out intimacy, you know I have not, and to discover that my lover has corrupted what was between us is...I cannot deal with it. I won’t. It’s over. I cannot love if I cannot trust.”
Soon enough, clean and more relaxed than he’d expected, John fell asleep with plans forming in his head, resting properly for the first time in years.
John was unsure now, but he did know that he hadn’t loved her at all in the end. Her death had felt like a great deprivation, like accounts between them would never be properly settled.
The second the door to his flat was closed, Sherlock found himself being tenderly embraced by Danny. Sherlock felt numb and distantly he felt his fingers trembling. “You were so brave, Sherlock. I could see how hard that was for you. You’re amazing but I swear, this is the right move.”
John looked penitent now, “I was
John sat and waited for his next order. He felt no urgency, no impatience, nothing. He just waited. Sherlock sighed deeply, “Make some tea, John, for both of us. You must be hungry, too. Please fix yourself a hearty breakfast, something you like.” Sherlock remained sad looking when John did exactly as was requested; brewing two cups of tea, and then making a large breakfast for one. He didn’t offer Sherlock his second slice of toast the way he would have done in the past because Sherlock hadn’t told him that it was okay to do. John ate his meal and then sat back, waiting. “Do the washing up, and then use the loo again if you need it. I will be waiting for you in the front room.”
, I’m coming.”
Mycroft sighed and sat back, “I’ve
“Sherlock?” John’s brain seemed to be frozen. He couldn’t think of how to say even the simplest of words, his lips flapping open cluelessly, shocked by Sherlock’s presence and the fact that the man in front of him seemed to be struggling just as hard to form words. He wasn’t emotionally prepared to host a guest. He must look a sight, too, blotchy from blubbering. He hoped that his nose was clean, at least. “Tea?”
. He had asked one
Everything went hazy with lust. John wasn’t sure who reached for who first but they were soon writhing around the bed together, naked, hungry, and filled with urgency. Sherlock managed to locate a half-empty container of personal lubricant which he nearly threw at John, “I need you in me, as soon as possible.”
Shake shake shake. “Another book.”
Sherlock grinned, the fondness in his eyes in no way overshadowing the deep love also present in his gaze. “Of course not, John Watson, I only prepared for every possible contingency and hoped for the best.”
“Yes, today it is. Wait a year, it will be possible then.” Mycroft went back to his report and ignore his brother stamping his feet and tearing at his hear as he threw a fit, “Charming, I can see why John is so enthralled with you, you must bring him a life filled with grace and tranquillity.”
. It’s a shawl, sort of a long kind of wide scarf your partner can wear about their shoulders instead of a jacket. If you like, we also have capes, both short and long. Do you want fur trim? Faux? Sequins? Hooded? Tall collar?”
There had to be a dozen people, at least, all swathed head to toe in tan fabric that showed nothing except their weaponry, and they seemed intent on a single point of interest. John noticed that all of them had one hand on hip holsters, ready to draw.
“I don’t believe in sin because I am an atheist, Mycroft, as are you! I don’t want to wait for some stogey old politicians to emerge from the dark ages of social history, I just want to marry John. Is that too much to ask?”
“Okay. Good to know.” John seemed to doze off so Sherlock settled beside him. To his surprise, John just rolled over and curled up, “I have a question.”
Sherlock laughed softly and kissed the man goodbye. Once they were washed and dressed, there was no more reason to linger. Sherlock called up a cab and kissed the soldier a final time, “It was wonderful.” It had been. “I’m glad I met you.”
It was clear by the surprise on his face that Danny had. “
John looked ill, his face pale and grey, yet he was also determined, “I’m making a mess of this, all over again.”
He woke very early the next morning. The flat was cool but not cold, and with a strange sense of satisfaction, Sherlock saw John’s spare shoes where they belonged, and the small sturdy coat he wore hanging right beside Sherlock’s long wool one. John
try to rape me, I suppose. It wouldn’t physically harm me to be rogered by your pin-prick, although, the thought of having your genetic material anywhere on me is a bit revolting. Getting me pregnant would be an impossibility, even at the height of my heat.” Sherlock stated calmly as if David had not spoken a word. He sniffed in David’s direction before wrinkling his nose, “You probably don’t even need to use birth control. Your underdeveloped bollocks can’t produce more than a handful of barely viable sperm. That’s another reason Mary likes you, you produce a lot of volumes, but you are as good as infertile. Interesting, because I smell her pregnancy.” He paused to sniff dramatically once more, “It’s not John’s, there isn’t a trace of him on her and if she were pregnant with his pups, she’d reek of him. No, she smells, oh my,” Sherlock paused again, taking a deliberately insulting breath in Mary’s direction, “She doesn’t smell of
It was the only tolerable scenario. John nodded, “Okay, we can go on a date.”
John’s embarrassment was fading away, especially after Sherlock picked up the container and examined the picture on the front closely. “What is this?” There were balls of colour and tiny text pockets densely strewn everywhere.
“I don’t hate you.”
“Sort of,” John saw a bit of light die in Sherlock’s eyes and hastened to explain. “I want you to be as happy as I can make you. I want you to be free with me. If you want to do something or know something or experience something, I want to help make that happen.” He hesitated at first but then confessed, “You knew I was checking the flat for illegal drugs. I saw the shoes and they got me thinking about the kinds of things
Mrs Hudson, well, Mrs Hudson was Mrs Hudson and didn’t require explaining. It would be like trying to explain why a hot cuppa was just the thing for nearly any occasion. You just understood or you didn’t.  She provided the sturdy physical framework that sustained his life, a home and hearth return to, the occasional meal and doting scolding. She’d had a wild and colourful life, and taught Sherlock many practical things about being fully alive. She was amusing as well and filled with fascinating stories that expanded Sherlock’s perceptions through the filter of her experiences. That he doted on her in return was just another thing that didn’t bear mentioning, and he always got huffy if anyone brought it up.
“I can take care of myself, John.” Sherlock knew he sounded testy but it was the only way to get John to stop. Sherlock could hold his own against a large number of human opponents in a physical fight, as long as they didn’t use iron against him, and during this season of good cheer, his powers were especially strong, buoyed up by the happy hopefulness of the masses.
Sherlock’s head was spinning a bit, but he took her advice.
“Good morning, John,” Sherlock looked nervous, “I know it’s early...”
“Sounds boring, honestly.”
John knew he was a terrible father and an awful person. He recalled clearly when he’d written that hate-filled note telling his best friend that John would trust anyone but him. He hadn’t taken those words back, lamely attempting to apologise by allowing Sherlock to take care of his daughter but even that had been done in the worst possible way.
Sherlock was touching himself again, his large hand stroking his weeping cock with speed. John spread his knees wider so that he could control the swing of his hips better. If it was going to be fast it was also going to be amazing. John realized he was moaning softly and continuously. Sherlock looked so beautiful, red-faced, sweaty, curled up on his back with his legs high and wide. John looked down and watched his cock disappear into Sherlock’s hole. He felt better than anyone John had ever been with, and already the amount of pleasure he was experiencing was almost disabling. He felt his limbs beginning to weaken as his energy began to lessen but he was so close. With heroic effort, John increased his pace and included a bit of a twist to his hips.
, you bastard. Of course, I’m not taking care of
Mrs Hudson kept her silence throughout the entire trip though Sherlock badgered her with questions. She simply smiled up at him and said nothing. Sherlock was annoyed.
Sherlock felt his cheeks heat and saw Danny’s grin grow, “No. No one has ever had the occasion.”
. Sherlock loves you. You know he does. I know he does. All of fucking England knows he does.” Harry emphasised her words with a sharp slap across his face. John jerked back in surprise, “You are pathetic!” Harry’s voice was accusatory, “You are just flailing about, refusing to look at the big picture because
It was pathetic, trolling for soldiers, but Sherlock had a
The beeping of his monitors woke him a long time later, or perhaps it was the snoring. John was in a squishy chair that was pushed up close to Sherlock’s hospital bed. John was sitting right up, his eyes tight shut, and his snore was discrete and small, but every few seconds he snorted a tiny bit whenever his head tilted too far forward. Sherlock watched as the sleeping doctor snapped upright and resumed sleeping quietly until his head sagged forward once more and he snorted himself upright once again.
Sherlock now had the leisure to examine the strange man he’d brought home, “You’re trying to figure something out, something to do with past trauma. You’ve lost someone dear to you, and you don’t have a handle on how it came about. There are authorities at play, they’ve managed to cut you off from your resources, so they’re powerful. Interesting.”
Several boxes had been hidden in Mrs Hudson’s spare bedroom, and she’d been happy to do so. He was sweating lightly by the time he finished hauling them up, one at a time. Sherlock used a staple gun to affix lights and garlands while Mrs Hudson unpacked a large assortment of delicate ornaments and other decorations, laying them out on the coffee table or mantle. When he was done that phase he set up a tree. He knew it was cheating a bit doing it so early, but the point was to
John understood, stroking his fingers through Sherlock’s curls with gentleness, “In your own time, Sherlock. Whenever you want, whatever you want.”
“Just do it.” He had no fight left in him. He’d already decided to quit using drugs to try and escape.
. You wouldn’t treat someone from your homeless network this poorly, so why does John deserve it?”
“Yeah, well, it’s working,” Danny smiled sadly off into the distance. Sherlock knew that his lover didn’t have much to look forward to. Once the case was solved, or even before, Danny was leaving, and he would be alone. With luck, Sherlock would not be in a similar situation but at the same time, his lover was poking a bear, or if relative predator size versus ferocity were a consideration, John was possibly a badger. The soldier was comparatively short but, he was highly trained, reactive, capable of tremendous physical savagery, and not to be toyed with about some things.
Sherlock’s neck was the next most potent temptation. More than once John found his mouth over the old scars on Sherlock’s neck but managed to keep himself from sinking his teeth in. The first time it happened, Sherlock went rigid with fear, but John licked and kissed at the ragged marks apologetically and made himself nibble his way down Sherlock’s shoulder instead. The omega had relaxed slowly but the next time John forgot himself, Sherlock didn’t even flinch. Instead, he pressed his neck harder against John’s teeth each time John knotted him and moaned softly as John tongued the scarred area repeatedly but didn’t bite. The region grew hot and flushed, and a bit swollen with all the attention. Sherlock relaxed completely after that, and John felt proud that his omega trusted him so implicitly that he kept licking the region almost compulsively, revelling in the happy purr it produced from the omega he knotted himself to.
“Better, John.” Sherlock blinked, “I was inside a rather awful dream for a very long time, John, a terrible, awful, sickening dream. I’m grateful to be awake.”
“That helps me how?” Danny asked, his face doubtful.
Sherlock stayed there for the entire night. When dawn came, he texted Mycroft, “I just needed to think. Nothing happened. Please send a car.”
to try and impress
Sherlock looked extremely pleased. “There
“Sherlock, what is going on? Companion?
Sherlock glanced around, “Mycroft will send the rest later.” John arranged for a taxi to pick them up and sat right next to Sherlock during the entire ride, their hands tangled together. Sherlock felt a wave of peace wash over him as they approached their street.
Sherlock had his doubts. John ignored his pouting silence and enjoyed the cab ride to their destination, “The Museum of London, seriously John?”
Mycroft snapped, “If you hadn’t gone off to destroy Moriarty’s organisation under the guise of your own death then England along with many other countries, would have fallen beneath the Spider’s control right after the death of everyone you ever held dear. You are my only brother and I love you more than I can ever show. I have nothing but respect for what John means to you
“I know, Danny,” Sherlock witnessed his brother being comforting, and it gave him insight on the many times that Mycroft had been there for him, exerting his wide-spread powers to keep Sherlock from suffering, protecting him even when Sherlock didn’t want him to. “We will root them all out. I have a plan.”
John shook his head, simply standing aside and waving Sherlock in, “I just saw your texts. Sorry, I had it on silent while it charged. I’m not used to getting messages during the night, my publicist usually just sends me emails with my itinerary on it.”
John grinned, “Well, then that’s that.” In keeping with their no-point-in-hiding-stuff-anymore proposal, John reached out his hand, “Kiss to seal the deal?”
. John’s eyes were sparkling, and his arm was clutched tight about her shoulder so that their upper bodies were pressed together in order to fit into the shot. He was wearing the clothing he’d had on when Sherlock left 221 B Baker Street.
alpha? Am I in heat, causing you to be addled in the head? No? Then shut up and operate your vehicle! I am not
“We normally eat curries more than anything, and I knew you weren’t going to let me feed you soft foods forever,” John pointed out. “If you feel okay about eating it, then I’m not worried.”
John was happy. It was so good to be home with Sherlock, to have a life with Sherlock. It was very nearly perfect, and if they never crossed the line into being more, then so be it. If this was what he got, then he was already a lucky man. Slowly, day by day, John relaxed and began to pay attention to things that weren’t in small boxes. He was at the clinic when a messenger arrived bearing a garment bag. Inside, John found a gorgeous black suit and a note that simply had an address and a time in Sherlock’s handwriting. “Don’t be late, and don’t argue.” John snorted with laughter but once again, just did as he was told.
“Okay,” John was rattled now, unnerved by Sherlock’s rapid change and general unexpectedness, “I don’t understand.”
Sherlock realized that he'd watched John sleep for nearly thirty minutes, and it had been both comforting as well as relaxing.
. He’s currently in the visitor’s room, angry, and demanding to speak to you.” Mycroft sounded cold. He was deeply annoyed, and Sherlock felt a fresh wave of gratitude bloom inside him.
It took a long time, but John barely noticed, they were both sweating, and Sherlock’s moans had built into long wavering keens. He was using both hands on his cock now, his legs trembling as his body jerked spasmodically. John was beginning to suffer intense arousal and began removing his clothing without thinking of what he was doing. Sherlock had tears flowing down his cheeks, his face red and blotchy with the effort he had expended, “It’s not enough, I can’t come. I need my alpha. I need my John. Why don’t you want me? John, please, I need you so much. Don’t make me wait any more, it’s been years, please? Please? John? Please, I need you in me right now, John, oh god please!”
John found himself being kissed with the kind of skill and thoroughness that he would never have expected from Sherlock Holmes. It was so unexpected yet so welcome that John simply melted into it, gratefully accepting and reciprocating everything being done to him by the tall gorgeous man in front of him. John pulled Sherlock closer still and tilted his head back in order to deepen the kiss further. When their tongues slid against one another’s, John heard a dual groan of pure desire. He pulled back at last, almost panting, and looked up. Sherlock looked so serious, even with kiss-bruised lips and a deep flush on his cheeks, “You’re perfect. You’re just…you’re just everything to me, Sherlock.”
Sherlock’s face expressed his chagrin that his message had been once again misunderstood, “You are. You are
Sherlock went downstairs and was further crushed when John made no effort to stop him.
Sherlock felt an almost unwelcome wave of relief when John tersely dressed his subordinate down. It was bad enough that John would be intimate with him, Sherlock didn’t want to expose himself to anyone else unnecessarily. John took up a watchful pose near the door and indicated that it was all right for Sherlock to continue his ablutions uninterrupted. The shower didn’t take long and the second he began towelling his hair dry, John stepped closer. “Lovely.” The captain came over and took a towel up. He dried Sherlock’s back, making Sherlock lift one leg at a time so he could pat the water off, “I am going to enjoy you so much.”
John’s mouth flapped open and closed for a minute.
Sherlock was a bit sad that it was all over but they both knew what they had been getting into. “Be safe, soldier. I hope I’ve ruined you for anyone else, you’ve certainly ruined me.” It would be a week or more before he could sit easily, and for the next day or so, he’d be staying at home to heal.
. “I’m trying so hard.”
Sherlock didn’t have any fight in him. He was weak, sore, and powerless. He was completely dejected because there was nowhere to escape. So many different parts of his body hurt for different reasons. He fell asleep crying but, in his dreams, he felt a gentle hand rubbing his head and tender lips kissing his cheek and brow. Somewhere in the back of his mind, he thought he could hear the words, “Come back to me. Please. It’s time to come back to me.”
“Via Whitehall, of course. It’s not so easy for men with certain, let’s call them
Dinner was excruciating. John knew Sherlock was behind him on the left, and he swore he could feel Sherlock staring at him during the entire meal. John pushed his food around as convincingly as he could, and ate three bites, but when the man on his right
Sherlock shook his head, signally silently for John to remain quiet. Another voice, male, spoke softly, “I don’t think they’re here, Aggie, let’s check inside some of these places.”
He couldn’t tell but it felt incredibly good just to stand under the showerhead and let it all cascade over him. After a minute, he even forgot that he had planned on fucking Sherlock for three days straight.
“Sherlock is a bloody liar,
John hated himself.
“Yes. We ended very unfortunately but that ending wasn’t a complete one...I have found that I have...” Sherlock seemed to get lost for a moment. Swallowing nervously once again, he looked over to John, his emotions bared and exposed on his face, “John, I have missed you endlessly these last few years. Nothing I have done, overcome, or achieved has made any sort of difference to how I feel about you. I am hoping, praying, even, though I’m not a godly sort of person, but that’s a completely different...what I mean to say...
Sherlock grew instantly queasy. He couldn’t bring himself to even think of John ending it with him now, not just when they were fixing what had already happened.
that I won’t be imposing.” John’s face was stiff and rigid with contained feelings. Sherlock wondered why John had decided to come back to Baker Street.
“Well, I didn’t pop over there to see for myself, but apparently that’s what it is.”
John gripped Sherlock’s hips, forcing him back down each time the omega rose up, causing both of them to groan and sigh with pleasure as their bodies worked. John felt something warm land on his belly, heard Sherlock’s shuddering cries and realised that his omega had experienced his first orgasm and that broke a hidden dam inside John’s mind. Pulling out, he almost threw Sherlock face first onto their bed and shoved his enormous prick back inside until his knot was the only thing keeping him from being fully buried.
“You were a sexy piece of gingerbread.” John still felt very dazed and confused.
The dinner that night was also the precursor to a social mixer. After their meal, everyone was invited to repair to the ballroom where people at first just milled around until drinks were served and lively music began to be played by a group of energetic young adults. Soon, people had paired up and were enthusiastically enjoying themselves. John stood near the back, and politely refused all requests to participate, “Bad leg, I’m afraid. This is as danceable as I get.” Sherlock on the other hand had a very full dance card and spent nearly the entire night on the floor with a new partner for every song, men and women alike. John watched, riveted as his old friend twisted, gyrated, and even hopped a bit. Sherlock never seemed to grow tired, and while he wasn’t openly enjoying himself, he obviously wasn’t hating it either. When he was finally escorted off the floor by a tall, smiling, dashedly handsome man, John fled once again, unable to watch Sherlock be seduced.
Somehow none of that made John feel better but he gave Sherlock a shaky smile and nodded. He would do this. He had to do this. Sherlock deserved every single degree of effort he could muster. John took in a deep breath, exhaled slowly and stood to his full height, “I’m fine.”
John wouldn’t let Sherlock lift a finger. In a different time, Sherlock might have become immediately bored with nothing to do, but after his recent experiences, Sherlock chose to subsume himself in John’s attentions. His soldier fussed, and petted, and doted on Sherlock day and night. He made sure that everywhere Sherlock needed to sit or recline was fresh, clean, and as comfortable as he could make it. He prepared simple foods to nourish Sherlock’s healing body and provided comfort even in the night-time now that he had agreed to share his resting hours with his
Still, the new scent was very distracting, overwhelming the cloud of
“I’ve been planning this for weeks, Sherlock. You and I never get out just to have a good time and we deserve it. I want to be here with you, my very best friend, to celebrate the holiday, any holiday.” John’s eyes were bright and happy, “This is where I’ll always choose to be, Sherlock, right here with you, for everything.”
He felt consciousness leaving him but as the blackness began to take him, Sherlock could hear someone frantically shouting, “We’re losing him! Do something! Help him!”
