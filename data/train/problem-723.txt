Sherlock hadn't bothered to traipse all the way around the property and had no idea any such hives existed. Still, he trailed after his father, glad to have something to do.
Once in the room, they reach for each other, not bothering to turn on the light. Sherlock presses John against the wall, mouth on his neck, hip bones digging into his pelvis.
“This is John Watson,” Sherlock grudgingly offered. “Medical student and soon-to-be army doctor this autumn. He's here for the summer visiting his great aunt.”
Dust motes swirl around them, their breaths uneven. Sherlock can’t resist winding his hand around his cock, stroking himself, riding a wave of carnal bliss. A golden tension coils in his bollocks, a perfect thrust and stroke springing it free. He comes with a muffled groan, ribbons of white semen painting the dark wood.
I had been stumbling around the edges of a revelation for most of my life. Dad and Sherlock loved each other, yes; but what finally became clear to me was how agonizingly
“I don't need your help.” He stood up to face Mycroft directly. “And you don't know anything about this.”
“You shut up!” In a burst of frustration, I lashed out, my knuckles bashing satisfyingly into Tommy’s fat freckled cheek.
He thought of the lake and John’s fervent lips against his neck, stirring a depth of desire he didn’t know he possessed, the way John had reluctantly pulled away, his husky words,
Sherlock lifted an eyebrow, then covered John’s bare foot with his own, sliding it up his leg, the hair on John's calf silkily coarse under the pad of his foot.
For the first time, he dared to imagine a future with John in it. The thought struck him with an intense pang of hope that raced across his features like pain.
“I love you, goddammit,” John growls, his mouth trailing across Sherlock's. “I should have said it years ago.”
“Hi.” John’s voice was low and soft as he smiled in return. “I’ve been watching the road, in case you came by.”
Sherlock looked away, seeming to freeze. John immediately regretted his words, dropped the tag. Shit, he'd assumed too much, rushed things, made an arse out of himself --
The semi-automatic was pleasantly cool and heavy in Sherlock’s hand. The guns, the soldiers, John’s orders -- he was getting hard.
“Thanks.” John had his hand on the door handle, but wasn't making any other motion to leave the car.
Sherlock lifted his fingers, still stiff with cold, and fumbled at the top buttons of his shirt. Whether it was from nerves or the cold, he couldn’t manage to push the simple buttons through their holes.
“No, but we all wish we could say what we’re really thinking out loud.” She grinned and picked up a cupcake. “Someone said the other professor is teaching here this year, too. Is that true?”
Sherlock glowed under his words, knowing they were wisps of romantic fancy, but thrilling nonetheless in their passion and newness. His answer was his mouth gasping against John’s straining neck, hips tipping up hungrily, fingers gripping pale flesh untouched by the sun.
They thanked her and returned outside, Sherlock's mood turning melancholy again. They walked toward the pub as if they could slow time and stretch out the remaining hours of the day, extending summer indefinitely.
Prior to meeting John, such intimacy was not something he ever thought he'd enjoy, not a pastime he ever wasted a moment thinking about, but John had turned all of that on its head. There was an inexplicable chemistry between them that sent up sparks like a summer bonfire, burning away caution and reason.
The years had brought disappointments, disillusionments, failures, losses, tragedy. He knew his own story well enough, but he wondered about Sherlock. Had there been other relationships? Did he have secrets, losses, regrets?
And last night -- this morning, actually -- he didn't even have the chance to see Sherlock’s face. They'd fallen asleep, and Sherlock had vanished again.
“Take me in your mouth,” Sherlock growled, pushing down on John's shoulders, groaning when the wet heat slid over his cock, John crouching, lapping and sucking, his fingers working in time with his mouth.
The basement was a large, well-lit space with smooth cement floors and sterile white walls. Two metal tables -- one covered with a sheet -- were placed in the center, along with a floor drain. Tall cabinets, counters, and deep sinks lined several of the walls. Sherlock was impressed with the modern, lab-like quality of the mortuary.
Plus, he had to admit, he was still miffed with Sherlock, not knowing what to believe about Mycroft’s cocaine remark. If it was true, then Sherlock was an idiot. It was a criminal offense to use cocaine without a prescription. Everybody knew that. The Dangerous Drugs Act had been passed just a few years ago following the war.
It's so much, the moist breath near his ear, the rasp of stubble against his cheek, nerves singing, overstimulated -- Sherlock gasps, his hips jerk, and he comes, spilling hot and sudden over his stomach.
In the dark bedroom, John lay on his back, one arm crooked behind his head, the other wrapped around Sherlock where he nestled into his side.
Sherlock breathes in John’s scent of leather and skin-warmed cologne, memorizing the exact notes. His runs his hands down John’s back, but his coat is heavy, a barrier. Sherlock starts pushing it off his shoulders and John helps, wriggling his arms free from the sleeves.
Sherlock’s heart quickened. “John.” All logic left his head, leaving only a rudimentary question. “Where are you?”
He reaches the top of the landing, Hannah practically glued to him. He waves her away from the door, then presses his back to the hallway wall, out of the line of fire. He places his hand over the doorknob, drawing in a breath. He doesn’t want to go in, but he has to know.
Sherlock can’t tear his eyes from the image, the dogtags dangling over John’s golden skin, his left shoulder unscarred. His smile is confident but not brash, his posture at ease, his body fit. He exudes an easy and commanding masculinity that pierces Sherlock’s defenses, penetrating into his deepest desires.
I noticed a light was still on in the sitting room, so I shuffled toward the doorway to go switch it off. I heard the low strains of music before I saw them. I stood in the shadows, then leaned against the doorframe, watching in my sleepy scotch-induced haze, my knees going a little weak at the romantic scene before me.
Sherlock knew they should be more discreet; this wasn't the private haven of Baker Street. They should have locked the door, should have shut the curtains. But the risk only heightened his senses, his body strung taut and electric.
Tomorrow, Sherlock's mother would commandeer the house, grilling him about train schedules and what he had packed, refolding his shirts, criticizing how quickly he wore out shoes, insisting on a last family dinner together.
“Then I feel lucky.” John slides his fingers into Sherlock’s curls. “Extremely —” he shudders when Sherlock sucks a sensitive spot on his neck, “fucking — lucky.”
John stared at the hotel ceiling, unable to sleep, the soul-searching hours of the night eating away at him. Sherlock was curled beside him, dozing with a hand tucked under his chin. John sighed, frustrated at his lack of sleep and inability to find some way to alter the course of the coming weeks. Sherlock couldn't follow him to the army, and he couldn't walk away from it.
he thought, giving himself over to instinct. He turned the doorknob, floating in like a ghost, a shadow.
She sniffs and flaps her hanky and dabs her eyes and tries to laugh as they share one last cup of tea together in 221B, but there's a sadness running through them all.
“Oh, hell,” John muttered, throwing caution to the wind and covering Sherlock’s mouth in a breathless kiss. Sherlock’s lips were warm, softer than he’d imagined, tasting slightly sweet like apples. John drew back, his trembling fingers going to Sherlock’s jaw.
“I -- John --” Sherlock gave up, working his cock, letting himself be rocked into the mattress. His eyes closed, his mouth falling slightly open. John knew that look -- he was close.
Happy holidays, dear readers, and may you all have a Happy New Year!  Thank you for your comments, kudos, and encouragement this year. I hope 2018 will be a year of positive change. Be kind, be brave, and make a difference where you can.
Sherlock leans against the cold enamel basin, snakes his hand under the tail of John's shirt, runs his palm up John's spine. His head is tilted, allowing John to pay delicious attention to his neck. Pressed so close together, it's impossible not to notice the bulge in John's pajamas that's now rubbing against his thigh.
Sherlock took the brochure back to England with him. He would bring it out at times, gazing at John’s face, wondering who he shared his bed with.
Sherlock squared off against his opponent, fists raised, feet light, ready to deliver or defend against a blow. John watched from a distance, loitering in the doorway to the gymnasium as the boxers circled each other like sleek tigers in a cage.
A breeze skims across his feet and calves and he feels the presence behind him. He knows what it is this time, and he is ready. He shifts his gaze in the mirror and sees the apparition standing just behind his shoulder.
“They were hardly threatening types,” John snorts. “I could’ve wrapped the skinny one around my finger. The big one, though.. he was well over six feet tall. Solid muscle. It’d take a lot of rope to hold him down.”
“Remove everything, please,” the attendant directed with a pleasant smile. “I'll take you to the room when you're ready.”
Sherlock presses back into the pillows, biting the knuckle that started all this. They need to be quiet. They're not alone like they usually are. He swallows his groans, tries to mute his rapid breathing. His fingers tangle into John's hair, telegraphing
He turned to my dad and held out his hand. Dad took it solemnly, then pulled Sherlock into a brief hug, one of those where you clap your mate on the back once or twice. Nothing remarkable.
John shakes his head. “Sounds interesting, actually.” He hesitates, rubbing his chin for a moment. “Any other visitors coming and going that I should be aware of?”
John nods slowly. “I've spent a lot of time with the dead and dying… even more than you, I'd say. Med school, the Army. Hospitals and morgues...
“I keep thinking about the hiker,” John said quietly. “Such bad luck. He went out to a field like this on a perfectly fine day… only he never came back.”
He held it for a moment, regretting that their exchange of letters had dwindled over the past year. Yet it wasn't all that surprising. Their lives had fallen into routines and increasing responsibilities, leaving little time and few new subjects to write about.
Mrs. Hudson patted his arm. “You'd be very welcome here, dear. Now, why don't we have a peek at the rooms you'd be sharing?”
The computer appeared unharmed, but he flipped it open to boot it up and check his files. As soon as he entered his password, the phone rang.
Having come this far, John pressed his finger lightly into Sherlock’s side, feeling the vitality and energy of Sherlock’s body surging through that one small gap. Growing bolder, John curved his hand just under Sherlock’s ribs, his index finger sliding deeper into the hole, his remaining fingers and thumb resting on the outside.
Sherlock can't bring himself to tell John everything he wants to. He's terrified of ruining the friendship they have if John doesn't feel the same way. Best to keep silent.
An all-too-familiar voice shattered the moment. Sherlock whirled around to face the intruder loitering in the doorway.
He eventually places the items back into the box and returns it to the shelf, then rummages a crumpled pack of cigarettes and lighter from his coat pocket. He allows himself an occasional smoke, even though he knows he shouldn’t. Better than the narcotic alternatives he used to rely on in his youth, although the temptation still lingers seductively in the darkest corners of his psyche.
Sherlock gazed back at John, unable to repress an answering smile at his own foolishness. John reached up, brushing away a damp ringlet from his forehead.
Sherlock closes his eyes, John’s words piercing his heart. His breath is uneven, but he forces his eyes open again, determined to read on. He struck with a small shock when he realizes the rest of the diary pages are empty. He rechecks the date of the last entry -- December 2 -- then recalls that John died the following day.
Many hours later, Sherlock made good on his promise to buy John breakfast. They stopped at a small cafe where Sherlock sipped at a cup of coffee and nibbled on a sandwich while John tucked into a shepherd’s pie.
She pulled a pen out of her bag, then picked up John’s hand, turning it palm up. “Here,” she pressed the ink against his skin. “My number. Give me a call after the holidays?”
John’s expression had changed, serious now, his pupils dark, and Sherlock felt caught out, sure that John must know what he was thinking. Blood rushed to his cheeks.
Strangely, he was not nervous, having imagined this a thousand times. He wanted to please John, wanted to explore him, memorize each sound, each shudder and flex, taste him, swallow him whole.
Sherlock wished he could touch John’s hand, slipping their palms together to find a reassuring squeeze. Instead, they walked on side-by-side with a respectable distance between them.
A series of dots was rapidly connecting in his mind, a swirl of possible scenarios drowning out any thoughts about John. At the moment, his attention was focused solely on the puzzle of the hiker.
They exchange a long look, testing each other, neither one willing to glance away first. Then Sherlock feels it, the charge and crackle in the air, the smolder of attraction. His lips curve up, a hint of a devilish smile.
For several seconds, Sherlock didn't move, and John's confidence wavered. But then the elegant hands lifted and, one by one, began unfastening each pearly button.
“Just put your feet together,” John answered. Sherlock did as he was told, and John guided his prick between Sherlock's legs. He pushed slowly into the tight gap between his thighs, Sherlock letting out a sharp breath at the contact. John leaned forward, his lips tickling the back of Sherlock's ear. “Have you ever heard of thigh fucking?”
All their doubts were crumbling, a surge of heat and want rising in them, their mouths nipping, teasing, their touches growing rougher and more possessive.
The slow disrobing, the frantic mauling on the mattress, that mouth… God... those lips wrapped around his cock… That was only round one.
Sherlock looked down at John, splaying his fingers over his chest, dragging his nails lightly through the coarse hair, watching John shiver with pleasure.
He checks his phone once more. Nothing. Sighing, he slips it into his back pocket, mentally switches gears, and opens the bathroom door, rejoining his family.
The sun was brighter when Sherlock woke again, John stretching his arms above his head before looping one around Sherlock's waist.
“No.” Sherlock watches the people outside as they walk by the window. “I'll enjoy the peace and quiet.”
They drive to a park and find a grassy slope under an oak tree. John spreads out a blanket and produces a bag filled with sandwiches, crisps, and several bottles of beer.
They chatted about insignificant things until their food arrived, then agreed on a meeting time to share a ride into the village. They parted ways along the main street, John heading to a bookstore he'd noticed when they first arrived, leaving Sherlock to his errands.
Sherlock thinks back through their steps, calculating where John might have lost it. “We should look back at the flat.”
“Cloves… Botanical name.” Sherlock’s mouth hovered near John's ear. “You smell so good,” he nipped lightly on John's earlobe, “I could eat you.”
“From Greek mythology. He was a great hunter.” John’s fingers are steady as he works. “He was the son of Poseidon, the god of the sea, so he could walk on water.”
“Thermodynamics. At least, I believe that's the topic. Continuing with some work from her university days.” Mr. Holmes walked to the front of the car and dabbed at a few smudges on the headlamps. “Thought you might be sort of an assistant for her this summer. Proofreading, organizing notes, that sort of thing. God knows I'm no use with all that.”
During breakfast I glanced frequently and furtively at my two subjects. Sherlock was drinking coffee while reading the paper. My dad was tucking into beans and toast, scrolling through messages on his phone. They were completely dull.
Sherlock stretched out his legs, and John mirrored his movement. Sherlock extended one leg further, as did John. Holding John’s gaze, Sherlock moved his foot an increment more, touching the tip of John’s toe, black sock meeting brown.
The muscles in John's arm and shoulders flexed as he hewed through a thick limb, the sinewy ridge of his spine visible under his tanned skin. His body was solid, his wide shoulders tapering to trim hips that swayed with every deep thrust and pull of the saw.
Sherlock moved quietly into the room and took a seat at his desk, logging into his account. They worked in silence, but John was highly aware of Sherlock, every atom electrically attuned to his presence.
After awhile, he turned to gaze at Sherlock, tempted to trace his fingers over his lips, to kiss his stubbly cheek, to rest his hand over the slow rise and fall of his sternum. John finally slipped out of bed, reluctant to stir his soundly sleeping bedmate.
John tilted his head, trying to imagine what could evade Sherlock’s control. He couldn't think of a thing. He looked back down at his plate. “Well… thank you for, you know… tricking me.” He flicked his eyes up, smiling, not knowing how to express his gratitude.
Their fingers scrabbled at each other’s braces and waistbands in haste, fumbling ineffectively until they each took over their own unbuttoning, their erections finally springing free.
Sherlock let John walk away, sensing a shift had occurred, that he had let fly a daring arrow and it had hit its mark. Time would tell the rest.
Sherlock opened his eyes again, turning back to John. They couldn't do more than look at each other longingly, not with other couples strolling along the shore and a family splashing in the shallow water.
“Sometimes a shave helps clear the cobwebs,” John clarifies, feeling a bit foolish. Maybe it was a stupid thing to offer. “Or not.”
“If anything happened to your father, I couldn't --” he bit off his words, not wanting to give voice to his thoughts.
He took another sip of coffee, mulling over all the possibilities. Well, life was too short not to go after what you wanted. If he was going to be shot down in flames, it might as well be by Sherlock.
Sherlock rose from his chair and crossed over to John, taking him by the hand. John stood facing Sherlock, a smile playing on his lips.
Harry looked slightly guilty. “It’s a painkiller that can be very addictive. Don’t want Sherlock going down that road again.”
“I’m not riding that monstrosity,” Sherlock repeats. He hears a shocked gasp from Rosie, then steals a glance at her. He’s surprised to see her mouth set in a scowl, her hair mussy, her hand curling into a fist. He almost smiles, charmed by her reaction. So much of her father in her… But no, he’s not getting on that awful thing with its headache-inducing calliope music and sticky children.
They simply looked at each other for several more moments, filling in the blanks of nearly eight weeks apart.
It took a great deal of willpower to disentangle himself, but Sherlock sat up, running a hand through his messy hair. He looked at John. “Tailor shop at 1:00. Think you can be ready in time?”
John raises his eyebrows, caught off guard. That was the last thing he was expecting to hear. “Oh, well… just tried something different…”
Sherlock rolled his head against the back of the chair, fixing John with a bored look. “It's cold and drafty and full of dull ancestral portraits. Musgrave Hall,” he sniffed. “I used to call it Mustygrave Hell.”
He hadn't ventured near John’s house, their last meeting leaving him too muddled to know what to say. It was easier to avoid the situation rather than try to address it directly.
Just then Mike steered toward them, a stunning woman linked on his arm. “Ah, here you are. I’d like you to meet Irene Adler. She’s a professor of human sexuality studies.”
John holds Sherlock’s hips, his pelvis flexing in and out, the slow grind gradually building into a sharp, staccato rhythm. The glassware in the cupboard above Sherlock’s head rattles and chimes enthusiastically with every thrust, a sound that imprints itself on Sherlock’s memory.
We’d already missed the first part of the film, so I tersely agreed to meet her later. Now I had more than two hours to kill. Miffed, I stomped back to Baker Street to wait there. Dad had lent me his spare key to Sherlock’s flat, which he still kept after all these years. I just had it for the day to let myself in after the film.
As he ponders, the distinct feeling that he’s not alone creeps over him like a shadow. He quickly glances at the door, thinking Hannah might have popped her head in to check on him. It’s shut, the room silent. He turns to the window to check if the heavy curtains are drawn. They are.
Sherlock runs a finger along the scar on his arm. “I want to give you a choice. A chance for something better.”
John will worry about him, he knows. He owes him the courtesy of a reply. Sherlock retrieves his phone and listens to John's voice tinged with concern, his eyes fluttering closed when the message ends.
Down slid the black trousers and boxer briefs, revealing hard thighs, firm calves, a creamy white arse where the sun had not bronzed his skin, and, oh, quite a lovely cock, long and lean like the rest of him.
She stopped at a curved booth in the corner, the high seat back forming a semi-private wall. She held out a perfectly manicured hand. “Your table, sir.”
Sherlock took a bite, assessed the silky salty richness of the rice, the fresh green burst of the peas, the yellow tang of the lemon zest. “This is really quite good,” he pronounced, taking another bite. “I’m rather impressed.”
They were both young, and people changed. He was wise enough to know that. And there was still so much of the world he wanted to see. Could he give up all his plans based on a summer’s infatuation?
John moves his hand up Sherlock’s back, guiding him close again. “Strange, to be afraid of each other when we're in a haunted house.”
“We knew each other,” Sherlock finally answered. He held John's gaze, his expression inscrutable. “A long time ago.”
My dad wasn't exactly an open book, though. He had been in the Army, but he didn't talk much about it. I once found a walking cane deep in the back of a closet and was playing with it when he passed by my room.
Sherlock laid there, drifting, feverish, his mind unbridled. He was well aware of how much he had been working. Almost constantly. And it was very intentional. If he kept himself busy, he didn’t have time to think about anything other than cases.
“I'm done, John. I've been thinking it over, and I'm ready to retire and leave London.” He looks directly at John. “What happened yesterday was my fault. I don't want to risk it anymore. I don't want anything to happen to you, or to me… It's time to step away and start something else. And I want you to come with me.”
John swallows, his tongue feeling thick. He forces himself to speak. “Your shoulder… how is it healing?” He’d removed the stitches a few days ago, a quick job done with little conversation, Sherlock in one of his silent moods.
John felt himself turn red. He’d never live that down. “Um, yeah. It was at a panel session about communicating science to the public. In Barcelona.”
The sofa creaks agreeably as John slides deeper, pulls back, and plunges forward again, finding a rhythm that suits them both. And it's a good one, judging by the way Sherlock's fingers are digging into his shoulders and gaze is burning into his eyes.
“Not you two, of course,” Mr. Holmes amended quickly. “I’ve got a crew coming in tomorrow to start digging. Sorry they couldn't help with the unloading today. The timing never quite lines up perfectly on these sorts of projects, does it? Now, you boys should go in and wash up for tea.”
Harry worked from home transcribing legal documents of some sort, and would often take me to coffee shops or museums or a movie when she needed to get out into the real world. People sometimes assumed we were mother and daughter, which I secretly enjoyed.
Sherlock looked at him, his fingers playing over his glass beaded with moisture. “I can't answer that. Our situation is… too clouded.”
He stumbled back to the house, feeling like he was lost in a maze, becoming more and more disoriented with every turn. Mycroft's warnings replayed in his mind, amplifying the futility of his feelings for John. Their romance was pointless. It was going to be painful. But he had fallen in deep. He might even have fallen in love.
John was glad to be concentrating on rowing instead of thinking about Sherlock. It felt good to use his muscles, his arms and legs straining, the sun warming his back. He smiled at Molly, who was peering over the side of the boat looking for fish.
His mind a million miles away, his foot slipped on something soft on the top step. Cursing, he grabbed at the handrail to steady himself. He stooped down and snatched up a pair of black leather gloves -- Sherlock's. They must have dropped out of his coat pocket as he galloped down the stairs like a madman.
He often imagined seeing John just one more time, plotting ways they could meet somewhere when John had leave, finding some way to slip away together. But it would be unwise, too risky. Nor did he think he could bear the pain of saying goodbye again. It was best not to chase after such ideas.
Mrs. Holmes rolled her eyes and waved her hand, dismissing him again. “Go telephone this John fellow.”
By the time he returns, he's soaked, Stamford’s paws are muddy, and John has built a cheerful fire crackling in the grate.
Sherlock was briefly embarrassed to admit the truth, but he nodded his head. “I keep it to remember you.”
He pursed his lips. “Counterfeiters, gunshot, minor leg wound, police don’t need to know. Earl Grey?” He walked up the steps, leaving me to stare at his back.
The carriage ride was working its spell on them, as cliched and silly as it seemed. John wanted to prolong this moment -- this breathless rediscovery, this aching tenderness -- for as long as possible.
Sherlock shrugged and slipped his phone back into his pocket. “You have a certain… rugged style that seems appropriate for the setting.”
As she walks away, Sherlock gazes at the man in the picture, having to admit there is a strong resemblance. He turns the photograph over, but the back is blank. How peculiar, finding these photos — the dead soldier and his own doppelgänger from the past. It’s almost as though he was led right to them…
He sometimes wished he didn't have a body, that he could just exist as formless intellect, no eating or sleeping to bother with, no aches or pains… no desires. At other times, he wished he could embrace those urges, abandon himself to pleasure, giving into lust utterly and heedlessly.
“Of course! That'd be very neighborly.” Mr. Holmes gave Sherlock a little pat on the arm. “Now, I wonder if I can convince Mrs. Turner to make some raspberry scones for breakfast tomorrow…” He wandered off toward the kitchen, leaving Sherlock to brood.
“I was so impressed with both of your latest publications,” Mike interjected quickly, trying to avert a disaster. He nodded at John. “Your analysis of exit wound tissue damage,” he then nodded at Sherlock, “and your study of rare subtropical poisons — both fascinating. Such informative perspectives you each bring from your respective expertise in medicine and chemistry.”
Next to Sherlock, he felt a little underdressed. Sherlock looked impeccable, turning heads as he glided through the breakfast room to their table. Of course, John had seen him slouching around the flat in his pajamas and dressing gown, or looking much rougher, strung out, unshaven, or laid up in a hospital bed, pale and weak. No matter the circumstances, Sherlock was always the most handsome -- no,
Sherlock knew John meant well, but at the moment every nerve in his body was raw and defensive. Mycroft always knew where to strike to make him feel like a failure. “There's nothing to tell,” he answered brusquely.
“Good morning,” he smiled, pleased at Sherlock’s warm response. He stroked Sherlock’s cheek, the stubble rough against the pads of his fingers.
It's been wonderful, Sherlock thinks, stirring sugar into his mug, having John here, working on cases, watching crap telly, reading through John's draft manuscript, waking up together, showering, falling back into bed with damp hair and hard cocks and eager mouths.
She had been airing out every nook and cranny after the summer’s heat, she had explained. The papers had been getting damp, so she took them out to let them dry. She gazed at him evenly as she spoke, something steely in her eyes he'd never seen before.
The kiss is soft but not shy, an offering that John gives to Sherlock with the promise of more if he wants it.
Pressed this closely together, the deeper spice notes of the soap rose enticingly from John's skin. Sherlock dipped his nose to John's neck, breathing in the heady scent.
Sherlock changes course, rolling onto his back, pulling John on top of him. John goes along with the change, adapting to the new position, one knee jammed between Sherlock’s side and the back of the couch, the other leg finding footing on the still warm stones of the patio floor. Nice leverage for some deep penetration, John can't help but notice.
When the housemaid answered, he politely asked to speak to Sherlock. He waited, choosing to study the flowered tablecloth instead of looking at his aunt who was clearly eavesdropping while pretending to do needlework. He would have to make the story plausible for her and anyone else listening on the line.
John wraps his hands around his mug, letting the warmth penetrate his fingers. He forms a thought, dismisses it, then lets it form again. It might be a good idea, or a terrible one. He says it anyway. “I can help you, if you want. To shave, I mean.”
“Look at those eyes and cheekbones. He could be your grandfather or something.” Hannah’s phone buzzes and she answers it. After a quick conversation, she ends the call. “That was Agent Dimmock. He’s just driving up. I’ll go let him in.”
This time John raises an eyebrow. “You’re the one always swanning around in that long coat with the collar turned up, flashing your cheekbones like —” he gestures, searching for the right image, “like some sort of sexy vampire.”
parallel universes, or past lives? What if ghosts do exist? Souls or energy or whatever you want to call it trapped between worlds?
John decided it would be best to try to ignore the exchange of looks in the changing room. “Are you having anything?” John tilted his head at his almost empty whiskey glass.
He attempts to tidy his desk while John is out picking up Olivia at the station. He adds a log to the fire, straightens the skull on the mantle. Liv will insist on putting up holiday decorations like she always does.
“Not yet.” Sherlock placed the needle carefully onto the record, the strains of a waltz soon filling the room. “Do you know anything about music?”
The sun was low on the horizon as they tramped through the grassy meadow. They had exchanged few words during the drive into the countryside, Sherlock seeming preoccupied with whatever strange details filled his brain.
“The truth will out,” John quoted philosophically, leaning back in his chair. He stretched and their knees bumped, sending a jolt of unexpected electricity up their legs. They could have pulled back, mumbled an apology, moved on to the next subject. But they didn’t. Their legs lingered, making the lightest contact, a thin, hot current betraying their own secrets.
“You should really come up and see the view from my room, you know,” he ran a finger suggestively down his beer bottle. “Enjoy the skyline before it's all blown to bits.”
Sherlock sighs, and John shifts, the bed creaking as he kisses his way down Sherlock's chest, to his stomach, past his navel.
Harry was divorced and lived alone. She still kept a photo of her ex-wife on her bedroom dresser. I had a lot of time to explore Harry's flat, since I was there most days after school and whenever Dad had to work weekends.
John sees the soft glow of the lamplight as soon he enters the front door. His pulse jumps, knowing that Sherlock is finally back home. He was gone only a week but it seemed much longer, the flat too quiet, too lonely without him.
“I was just at the lake with Ian.” She paused, her fingers gripping the handlebars. “We sort of broke up. So it's not a very good day.”
They remain sprawled on the sofa, unwilling to move until it's finally uncomfortable being so squished together. They disentangle themselves and pick up the candle, bringing it back to the bedroom. They slip under the covers and Sherlock blows out the flame, turning on his side to gather John against him again.
It's not a terrible idea, Sherlock thinks, his hands sliding up John's back, drowning in his kiss. It's marvelous. It’s long overdue. It's as necessary as air. It's unstoppable.
His feet were damp in the dewy grass, the air heavy with the scent of roses where he waited. He stared at the window, checking for any sign of movement.
Sherlock placed a hand tentatively around his cock, gently pulling down the foreskin to reveal the head. John held his breath, waiting for the first touch of his mouth.
“This place is a powder keg,” John leaned a bit closer. “It’s all going to shit any day now. Did you tell your editor that?”
John holds his thighs, keeping them pushed back, spread wide. Sherlock licks his lips, exposed, aching to be filled. Something touches him there — hot and wet and smooth. Not a mouth or finger, but John’s cock rubbing against him. Sherlock can feel how hard it is, the head swollen, the shaft rigid.
Sherlock kept his gaze on the broken chair, John's words hollow in his ears. He should have expected this, he knew that. But he never imagined how devastating it would be to actually hear it. He didn't trust himself to speak.
“Odd family,” Molly joked, snorting a bit. “Sorry, that sounded mean. It's just, they're really smart, brilliant even. But a bit… different.”
The unmistakable hard length of John’s cock slides between his thighs, gliding along the sensitive flesh of his perineum.
Her brunette hair was bobbed short, a few loose ends wisping around her face. She turned her head and laughed at the young man riding alongside. Sherlock didn't recognize him. Light brown hair, a quick smile, square jaw, muscled forearms. He was tanned, athletic. Likely a tourist.
Someday, their mouths will whisper against hot skin, legs and arms sliding across cool sheets, sharp hip bones digging into soft thighs, and their shadows will dance sensuously across the bedroom walls.
Sherlock veered his bike onto a small dirt path that split off from the main road. He didn't know where it led, but in the distance he could see an abandoned stone barn and stand of tall trees. He headed toward the trees, coming to a stop in a glade of long grass dappled in shade.
I had been trying so hard to act grown up, sneaking sips of wine and wearing eyeliner, when all this time something much more significant had been going on right in front of me. This intimacy, relationship, whatever the right word was, was their secret. And they didn't want anyone -- not even me -- to know.
Sherlock cleared his throat loudly. “You should finish unpacking, John. Don’t want to be late for tea.” He glared at him.
He sits up in bed, half blind when the lights snap on, instantly bracing for something bad -- a punch in the face, a bag over the head, a gun to the temple.
Molly looked guilty. “Yes. I don’t know. All they talked about was cricket or the weather. Nothing really exciting.” She shifted her eyes to John. “What about you? Anyone special?”
It was John’s turn to raise a quizzical eyebrow. In reply, Sherlock switched on his phone and started scrolling.
John looked back toward the boathouse, unable to see Molly or Sherlock. It was pointless to think about Sherlock this way -- he was reserved, posh, inexperienced, in many ways still a boy. But those eyes. That voice. A streak of rebelliousness. A firestorm in a bottle that John very much wanted to release.
I let out an exaggerated sigh. “For fuck’s sake, tell him about Sussex. Don't wait.” I turned to leave, then glanced back. “And stop worrying about me. It's about time you two sorted things out, don't you think?”
Sherlock had contacted Olivia, barely back from her travels, to drive John home -- only that didn't happen. Instead, he and Olivia ended up having a serious chat while smoking stale cigarettes on the rooftop. An important revelation came to light, and now he has to tell John.
A series of images flitted through John’s mind — undressing each other, clothes heaped on the floor, hands smoothing over bare backs and arses, the almond scent of massage oil rising from their skin. They’d sink to the bed, their legs tangling, hungry mouths roving over necks and chests, across stomachs, down to thighs and cocks, faces beautifully contorted with pleasure.
This won't have the same effect once it's all posted, obviously, so consider yourself engaged in performance art. Yeah, that's it. :)
Sherlock’s mouth crooks, his hand curling against John’s chest as he settles into sleep. They doze, warm, sated for the moment, basking in their abundance.
Somewhere deep in his cells he remembers this, a sense of peace and belonging, a feeling he didn’t think was possible until it was rekindled just now. Strange to think how this feeling has always been there, waiting to be unlocked by John. How many times have they met through the centuries? How many were fleeting encounters cut short by war or illness or societal boundaries? Have they ever been granted a lifetime together?
A morbid curiosity won out, and he made his way to the telephone that was tucked away in an alcove of the upstairs hallway. He lifted the receiver, willing his voice to be cool and detached. “Yes?”
The room is cool and dim, his private haven. As they stand by the bed, Sherlock realizes he’s never invited anyone to this bedroom before. Apart from the few days with John at the safe house, he’s led a solitary and celibate life the past several years.
John pulled back slightly, surprised. He traced the tendon in Sherlock's neck. “Alright,” he finally answered, his voice soft. “I think I'd like to know, too.”
He pulled John by the elbow, leading him across the street, past the cafe, to a line of horse-drawn carriages along the curb.
John folded his arms and looked out the car window, annoyed that Sherlock always had to have the last word.
Sherlock watched, sloe-eyed, taking in the way John’s tendons in his neck stood out, the changing pattern of his breath as he worked himself to the brink, the urgent
“Wires, remotes -- amateur stage tricks.” Sherlock rises from his chair and circles the dark room, fruitlessly scanning the shelves for hidden cameras and devices. “Someone must be watching us, listening.”
If only he could do things differently, rework the tangled maze of events that have brought them to this point of being together only fleetingly, their relationship relegated to the shadows. Ghost lives.
Sherlock heartily agreed, wanted nothing more than to ride into town for cigarettes and a chance to see John. After a quick cleanup and change of clothes, Sherlock retrieved his bicycle and set off down the road.
A rush of warmth exploded into spirals of pleasure, his fragmented body floating like tossed petals, drifting, descending, landing. He gradually became aware of John kissing his lips, the weight of his body holding him down, piecing him back together.
He took inventory of his senses, his limbs and digits, the acuity of his mind. Was he a different person now that he'd unabashedly delved into the world of sexual pleasure? Was he duller, more common, crude? Or was he sharper, more worldly? Had he even changed at all?
He's never resented Liv, not for one second. She is, in many ways, his anchor. She's kept him human. Without her, parts of him might have turned monstrous, vengeful... He doesn't like to think about that, either.
When the house came into view, Sherlock slowed even more. He scanned the front yard and was disappointed to find it empty. Making a sudden decision, he turned into the lane, coming to a stop by the garage.
He stopped under a large oak tree and leaned against the rough bark, pulling a slim cigarette case from his jacket pocket. He wedged a cigarette between his lips, struck a match, and inhaled, welcoming the rush of nicotine.
The question was asked casually, but Sherlock’s tongue was suddenly tied. The way John stroked the leather, the phrasing and tone of the words rattled him again. “I… I’ve had some rough spots.”
He reluctantly turned and walked slowly toward the trees, retracing his steps all the way back to the house and his car, feeling numb. Sherlock had not said
I was 14 when Sherlock's father died. I’d never met him and there was no reason for me to go to the funeral, but I wanted to. I'd never been to a funeral before and it felt like a grown-up thing to do. I was in a phase of trying to be mature, wanting to wear a bit of makeup and drink over-sugared coffee with cream and think about what kissing would be like.
“Look,” John finally said, keeping his voice even. “We’re both stuck here, so why don’t we come to an agreement? I’ll take the office from 8 to noon, and you get it from 1 to 5.”
He chewed as he read, delving into a story about a politician’s sordid affair, his mind a million miles away when the door to the flat banged open. John nearly choked on his toast.
John pushed the worst of his thoughts away. There were ways to be careful, ways to keep secrets hidden. If anything was going to come of this frustratingly palpable mutual attraction, he would have to be the one to set things in motion. He just couldn't be a bull in a china shop about it.
He eased off his shorts, stroking his cock until he was hard. The hole in the peach gaped red and lush, glistening and eager. He gingerly pushed the head of his cock into the hole, his body tingling with perverseness. Pale orange juice ran down his shaft and into his pubic hair, dribbling onto his thighs. He had no idea how he would hide the evidence from Maria, explain the sticky mess on his sheets, but he couldn’t stop, didn’t want to stop.
“Ah.” John pulled at his whiskey. He wasn't feeling nearly drunk enough. He wanted to leave, and yet he didn't. There didn't seem to be much point standing here chatting if Holmes just wanted to hook up with Anthea. Where was she, anyway?
John loved how it shifted and changed under his touch, engorging, lengthening. He envisioned finishing Sherlock off with his hand, or dropping his trousers and bending Sherlock over the sink, thrusting from behind, catching glimpses of their gasping faces in the mirror. Arousing, but lacking the depth of intimacy he craved.
Sherlock watched him ride away, his chest hollow. How had everything gone so badly in such a short amount of time? Why did he fall into Mycroft's traps time after time, behaving like a petty child? And now he had lashed out at John, pushing him away, ashamed to tell him about his own weaknesses.
John grinned, then pushed Sherlock onto his back, swinging a leg over his hips and straddling his thighs. “I'm an excellent influence. I've kept you out of all kinds of trouble,” he ran his fingertips down Sherlock's sternum, “introducing you to all sorts of new hobbies…”
“It’s got to be better than your old army digs, I reckon,” Mike joked, trying to make the best of the situation.
“Then hurry up. I’m supposed to be making tea,” Sherlock growls, clutching at John’s arse, his senses heightened with the risk of discovery. Dimmock might be patrolling the house or Hannah might come looking for him if he’s gone too long.
“Your father will be home at six,” Mrs. Holmes said, passing him the sugar. “He's at one of his meetings. History Society or some such thing.”
Sherlock withdrew his hand from John's crotch, feeling a mix of shame and satisfaction. John had responded to him, had kissed him back, but was cautioning him to stop. He was the bosses’ son, after all. His parents’ influence, their connections, were everything to a young writer. If John did anything to fall from their good graces, his career could be ruined.
Sherlock eventually rose from his bed, pulled on his linen jacket, and smoothed down his unruly hair, girding himself for tea. The unpacking could wait.
Sherlock grasped the base of John's cock, his bare back curving downward, his lips parting; John’s neck arched, and he moaned --
“Lie still. The pain meds should be kicking in again any moment now.” Mycroft reassures him. “It’s on a timer.”
His cock is stiff against John’s and they move, hips grinding and mouths seeking. John's fingers wind into Sherlock’s hair, pulling just hard enough to make Sherlock dig his nails responsively into John's shoulders.
Sherlock rolls his eyes at the stupidity of the question but John cuts off any protest. “Just answer it.”
“Oh god,” Sherlock groans, covering his face with his hands, embarrassed at his train of thought. It’s insane. It goes against everything his rigorous scientific training stands for. It’s simply not possible.
Sherlock ends the call and stares at the ceiling. He doesn’t want to get up, but if he stays motionless, he’ll go mad thinking about John. Best to move. Get dressed, tell Hannah to get ready, pack up, drive away.
A devastatingly deft suck and swirl combination had John sliding his hands into Sherlock's hair, transmitting his urgent approval through his clutching fingertips.
He switched on the lamp and fairy lights and started the fire, instantly bathing the room in warmth and easing his mood. He scrolled through his phone, finding a station that played classic Christmas songs: Frank Sinatra, Nat King Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Bing Crosby.
“Oh, right.” John was surprised, and a little flattered, that Sherlock would offer the helpful reminder, his fingers going to the bullet scar. “I have an old injury. It can still be a bit sensitive.”
The next evening John joined them at the dinner table, pulling out a chair across from Sherlock. As he settled into his seat, the corner of Sherlock's mouth lifted slightly in triumph. John had returned, the arrow’s aim true. He poured wine into John's glass as platters of food were passed around.
“They found a long-term replacement. I caught the first train back.” John smiled, assessing the droplets falling from Sherlock’s hair and clothes onto the rug. “You didn't have enough cash for cab fare, did you?”
When John’s fingers curl over his waistband and tug down, Sherlock digs his elbows into the mattress and lifts his hips, helping the striped cotton pajamas to slip down, freeing his cock.
“Europeans think everything is far away,” John countered. They walked around, scuffing their feet at rocks, sometimes picking up a shard to inspect.
Sunlight dappled their skin, the scent of damp earth and gentle rustle of leaves surrounding them. He tugged John to his chest, kissing him with pent up passion.
Tommy howled out in pain and stumbled backwards as boys and girls jeered and shouted excitedly at the fight. Several teachers rushed over and waded through the crowd, one seizing me roughly by the arm.
When both Mycroft and the nurse are gone, Sherlock drifts in and out of sleep, dreaming of a childhood visit to the beach, of leaping playfully onto Mycroft’s back, throwing his six-year-old arms around his chubby brother’s neck, both giggling.
John's hard expression relents into something softer, already sliding down the path of no return. “This is a terrible idea,” he says futilely, reaching for Sherlock, cupping his hands under his jaw, tilting his head, bringing their mouths together heatedly.
Dad said a few more words, sliding his palms slowly up the arms of Sherlock's dark suit, then smoothing his hands down the front. My eyes widened, surprised at the intimacy of the gesture.
Sherlock does a cursory swipe over the paws and abandons the towel on the kitchen floor. He pulls John against him, sliding his cold hands around his back. “Tetchy,” he teases.
Before John even takes a sip, Sherlock starts blurting it out. “Yesterday, while you were sleeping, Olivia was here. I told her what happened, and I intended for her to take you home, but we started talking… And…” He grips his mug with both hands, nervous.
It's not always easy, but John has followed two rules to prevent the worlds from merging too far: Their relationship must be kept simple, and it must be kept private. The two parameters they set long ago.
“Hi.” Sherlock had nothing more original to say, but it was all that was needed. He could feel John’s gaze lingering on his open shirt collar that covered the mark on his throat.
John smiled, glad to see the ruddy face of his old friend Mike Stamford. It was Mike who had extended the invitation to come teach. He’d moved to the States from England a decade ago and they’d kept in touch, occasionally seeing each other at conferences. Apart from gaining a bit of weight, Mike looked much the same as he had years ago when they were both young medical students at St. Bart’s. A lot of history had passed since those days, but Mike was as cheerful as ever.
“Don’t do it.” Sherlock extends his arm, his palm lifted half in a warning, half in a bargaining plea. “John, think about what you’re doing.”
“Now I know you two have a bit of a rivalry,” Mike continued diplomatically. “I mean, that argument you two had during the panel session at the Barcelona conference two years ago — who could forget that? I still see clips of that going around. Legendary.” Mike sighed fondly at the memory, not noticing the deadly glance John aimed at Sherlock. “Anyway, I think you’ll both bring much-needed energy to this department, stir things up, get students pumped up about science and criminology. You two are the best in the field! Now you’re here together—what an exciting opportunity for collaboration!”
As John mounted the steps of the porch, his stomach clenched. Maybe he should just turn back. But no, he was here and it would be a waste to go back now. He took a breath, squared his shoulders, then rang the doorbell marked underneath with a neatly penned S. Holmes.
Sherlock climbed the stairs to his rooms, ignoring the laughs and chatter floating up from the common room. He had no desire to socialize, his mind still turning over a new theory.
John sighed. Bloody stupid peas. He began rummaging through the cupboards. A tin of beans. A box of vegetable broth. Stale biscuits. Rice. Arborio rice, to be precise.
John tried to think back. He really didn't take holidays. He just traveled for work. “I honestly don't know.”
Instead, there is a cup of tea placed quietly on the side table, a long glance up from a screen, a soft ‘You okay?’ This is how they track each other, never pressing for answers, always close by but not hovering, waiting patiently for the shadows to retreat.
When they're done with the tea, he clears off the table while Sherlock disappears into the bathroom. John hears the taps running to warm the water, the clink and rattle of Sherlock moving items in the cabinet.
He backed the car down the lane, glancing at the house before putting the car into gear and driving toward Musgrave Hall.
Sherlock breathed in a waft of cumin, coconut milk, chiles, and turmeric. “Hm?” He asked distractedly.
John stared back at him, wrapping his head around Sherlock’s words. His anger dissipated, but he remained wary, unsure of what was happening.
Heat flushed Sherlock's cheeks, but he held Mycroft’s insolent gaze. “I'm simply helping out a friend.”
John held his gaze, a tension rippling between them that made it hard to breathe. Sherlock was aware of John's eyes flicking down to his mouth, then back up.
The heavy door closes. “Have a seat,” Mycroft says, waving a hand at a chair. He holds up two glasses and a cut-glass decanter. “Drink?”
When he reaches the landing, he swallows and hopes for the best. He enters the sitting room and flicks on the light. The room is relatively neat, the kitchen sink empty, the scent of lemon dish soap in the air. He breathes a sigh of relief. Mrs. Hudson, bless her heart, must have tidied up earlier.
met someone, a person unlike anyone else he'd ever known. A person he wanted to spend every spare minute with and could barely find a second to do so alone.
John smoothed his hair back from his forehead. It had grown long in front, the wave of silver-blond contrasting with his dark blue eyes. He stilled, letting Sherlock look at him at his leisure. John was not shy about his appearance -- he was no bodybuilder, but he was fit and tanned.
John worked him deeper and harder, chasing a raw desire to make Sherlock lose control. He could feel the strain building in Sherlock's body, muscles tightening, the quiver of his cock, and then it happened -- a groan, the jerk of hips, the rushes of warm come flooding his mouth. John stroked him through his climax, swallowing what he could, his fingers slick and gleaming.
Matthew was tall and smooth-chested, my hands running freely over his ass and the dip in his back as the water rained down on us. I had seen most of his body already; there was not much a Speedo could hide, after all. But I'd never touched anyone quite like this before.
John’s relief was soon tinged with regret and embarrassment. He picked at his food with his fork. “Seems I've wasted months limping around like a fool.”
Sherlock smiled under the covers, knowing he’d hit home on all points. Tomorrow, he thought as he turned on his side away from the reading light, he’d rip that needlework off the wall and burn it in the woods. He’d very much enjoy that. He might even ask Mycroft to help. It could be their secret.
To John's immense relief, the number she named fell into the range of what he could afford. “That would be acceptable,” he managed to say, amazed to find himself quite possibly committing to a flatshare with a roommate he'd never met.
John dutifully walks over to briefly peer into the bathroom. “That’s quite a door,” he remarks. “It’s a bit… not opaque.”
John laughed. "Must be nice." He took a sip of wine that Sherlock had brought home a few days ago. A Pinot Noir. "No wonder you were so thin when I first met you."
Sherlock smoothed his hands down John’s lower back, cupping his buttocks as he regained his breath. He felt the heaviness of John’s hard cock on his belly, precome leaking near his navel.
Sherlock slowly leans in and spreads his palms over John’s thighs, gripping his fingers into his flesh through his jeans. John’s eyes widen, awestruck, as Sherlock dips his mouth, brushing his lips against his, clinging softy for a moment. John is overwhelmed with the soft heat of Sherlock’s mouth, the tickle of curls against his forehead, the bristle of stubble on his upper lip.
He's been trying to reach Sherlock for three days. All his texts have gone unanswered. John is uneasy about the silence, so now he's trying to call. He hopes the annoying ringing or incessant vibration will force Sherlock to pick up.
John slowly unfolded it, anxiety flitting across his features. Within moments, he relaxed, relieved.
He took a deep breath, letting it out slowly. He was overreacting. It was just a strange jolt of attraction to a very unusual pair of eyes.
I imagined they sometimes met in distant cities, places they could be anonymous. I distinctly remember Dad returning from a trip to Barcelona looking much more tanned and invigorated than a typical conference attendee. The freckles scattered across Sherlock's cheekbones when I saw him later that same week were proof that he'd been somewhere sunny as well.
“It's been weeks with barely a word from you!” John is shouting and he hasn't taken off his winter coat. “What the blessed fuck is going on?”
The noise was the trigger that propelled them both forward, smashing together in a fury of mouths and hands smearing and groping, falling to the rickety bed, wrestling on the lumpy mattress, gasping and grunting, curved necks and bent knees, hands in hair, hips pressing, humping, grinding.
Sherlock glanced back into his room, then out at John, his expression undecided. He finally made up his mind, then gestured for John to wait where he was. John vanished back into the dark, his heart beating fast again.
Mycroft sniffs. “There was a William Holmes recruited into the British Intelligence Corps at the start of the war. He was at Cambridge, quite brilliant, apparently. He was assigned to the Middle Eastern theatre.”
Sherlock watched his mother usher John into his guest room and silently wished him luck, knowing she would fuss over the curtains and straighten the bed covers, then explain the origins of each piece of furniture and painting.
Sherlock glanced at the end of the dock, knowing the lake was deep enough to plunge into safely. “No sense waiting.”
When he woke, something savory filled the air, the scent detectable even through his stuffy nose. He lifted his head just as John peeked through the crack of the door.
He arrived about midway through the party, food and drinks flowing as fast as the conversation, spirits high. John wanted to let himself be swept up in the buoyant mood, but he felt flat.
John carefully balanced his cup and saucer, looking around at the leather-bound books and ornate furnishings with slightly nervous admiration. “This is… nice. The house, I mean. Very, um, grand.”
“Look,” John pushed on, “about this afternoon. I'm so sorry.” He paused, his rush of words slowing. “I completely botched it up. You have every right to hate me.”
Time was slipping by too fast, Sherlock thought, sand sifting through their fingers as they tried to squeeze out every moment and slow it.
They lie in a tangle of sheets and limbs, the room scented with sex, their hearts beating rapidly. When they finally cool, John pulls a wrinkled sheet up to their shoulders. They turn to face each other, slotting their bodies together, hands drifting over arms and hips.
Sherlock circles the skeletons, one about his own height, the other noticeably shorter. “One male, one female?”
John hooked a finger over the pants, bending down again to kiss the tip of cock that peeked out. Overcome with Sherlock's scent, John mouthed the hard shaft through the fabric, feeling the firmness swell and shift under the wet heat. John slatted his tongue under Sherlock’s balls and pressed up, making Sherlock gasp and swear.
He leaned back against the sofa, more serious now that my question was hinting at his personal life. This was new territory for us.
John was distracted by the rich baritone, but not so much that he missed Sherlock's less-than-subtle allusion to his own mathematical brilliance. The superiority in his manner made John bristle. “A proper mathematical genius, are you?”
Sherlock switches off the light and they lift the covers, the mattress bouncing as they climb self-consciously into their respective sides and settle under the fresh, cool sheets.
He flinched, as if I'd caught him doing something wrong. “No. I'm sure he's fine. He knows how to take care of himself.”
“You don't know anything about me,” Sherlock snarled. This was all going horribly wrong. He stood up abruptly, and John swiftly put down his cup.
The fire pops and crackles, the room growing hotter. John slowly rolls his hips, lost in a tangle of tongues and lips and hair, damp patches of pre-come blooming through cotton. His cock is hard and full, compelling him to find the sweetest points of contact, grinding down on Sherlock in wanton ways. He doesn't notice the sparks swirling around the bed like a glowing whirlwind.
Sherlock seemed to melt down the wall, sitting in a heap on the hard floor. Ignoring his aching knees, John pitched forward to find Sherlock's mouth.
He slips away to hide in Molly’s small office, not wanting to be tortured by their tedious banter. He scrolls through his phone, feet propped up on Molly’s desk, until she pops her head in.
Sherlock's body pulsed with his name, every second without him an eternity. The morning stretched endlessly to lunch, a white void. He counted the minutes until John would join him by the pool for their afternoon routine.
John gazed at the gold band he still wore on his finger. To remove it seemed disloyal. Mary had had no other family. Taking it off would be a step closer to forgetting her, and if no one remembered her, she would vanish forever. He owed her this small token to her memory.
John lets out an incredulous laugh. “Are you serious? We’ve only just met and now we’re going to look at your flat in the middle of the night?”
When John's eyes adjusted, he could make out the strange shapes of exotic plants, spikes and fronds and lush petals, heady tropical scents of spice and sweet twining around them, the air earthy and humid.
After retrieving his bicycle, Sherlock spent the rest of the morning cleaning it, checking the tires, and greasing the chain, just as Thomas had taught him years ago.
Sherlock lifts his eyes from the microscope and shoots a glance at John. He’s sitting in his chair with his laptop open, apparently talking to himself. John lets out a soft laugh and shakes his head.
John checked the back where two cakes nestled in round tin carriers were perched on the seat. “It’ll give us a few hours, don't you think? We’ll drop these off, put in a brief appearance, then find something else to do with the night.”
John halted several yards away, unable to process these odd coincidences. It wasn't until the driver broke into a grin that John fully recognized him. John grinned back, rushing forward.
Sherlock reins in his impulse to keep spinning out observations. “Right… It’s in an excellent location, affordable if we split the rent, and comes with a rather endearing landlady downstairs. You’d have your own bedroom. The kitchen, bathroom, and sitting room are shared.”
“It's a quarter turn to the left with each half box,” Sherlock explained, and John glanced at him with alarm.
I close my eyes, pinch the bridge of my nose, and take a shaky breath. I square my shoulders and follow him, like I always do.
John says nothing more, simply leaning in to find Sherlock’s mouth, enveloping him in warmth and caresses. Their hands work at belts and flies, shimmying off jeans and trousers, socks and pants.
He had been there. It was awful. Sherlock was in rare form -- rude, curt, insulting. She left before John had even uncorked the bottle of white wine he'd bought for the occasion.
He used to dream about evenings like this, wishing himself away from crowded barracks and desert heat and sweaty bodies, fantasizing about a cozy room and a good book, snow falling outside, ensconced in blissful solitude.
Sherlock rose onto one elbow, leaning up to cover John's mouth with his own. John drew him against his chest, knowing he would never have enough of these moments.
I claimed I had a headache and wasn't feeling well when Dad found me later. I was pale and puffy eyed, sitting on an overstuffed chair in a study located off the main room. The other guests were departing, restoring some semblance of peace.
He reaches for an old t-shirt laid out on the bed, shivering slightly as the cool air plays over his bare skin. The room is large and drafty, an unlit fireplace taking up one wall, a desk and chair against another. A thick rug partially covers the floor, but fails to hide the dark stain near the bed.
John thought about it carefully, deciding to take the chance. “Alright. I could have a look at it over break.”
He really didn't mind. He liked sitting here, the two of them, not rushing, just at home together. He enjoyed it, being with Sherlock, sparring with him, watching his expressive eyes, the slow smile that crept across his face that made him feel like the most important person in the world. He coveted those moments, would chase and fight and shoot and argue and cook and leave all the Lauras and Sarahs behind for those unguarded grins from Sherlock.
“The police were here early this morning -- three of them,” she started, “I overheard them talking. They’re completely baffled.”
The deep red color contrasts with the luminous green stains on Sherlock’s fingertips, the pungent, spicy scent released by the tomato leaves shimmering in the still air.
A set of key dangles from John's fingers, throwing off a glint of light. He's kept the keys to the flat for years, never giving them back to Sherlock. Nor has Sherlock ever asked for them.
Sherlock hails a cab and they climb into the back. Sherlock finally speaks. “You’ve been abroad recently.”
I pushed my chair back and stood up, then loitered for a moment, pulling at a lock of my dark blonde hair. “Dad?”
John jumped at the sound of Sherlock's voice. He blushed, stammering. “Oh -- no, I wasn't -- it's just, there's no return address.”
Dimmock bent down to give her a chaste kiss on the cheek. “You must be thirsty after all that,” he said. “I'll get us something to drink. Be right back.”
Sherlock tried unsuccessfully to hide his smirk. They ate without talking for several minutes, Nina Simone's rich voice filling the room.
The scents of lather and tea hung heavy in the small room, intensified by the humid air. They melded into each other, unmoving, their breath in sync. John wanted to say things about last night, but could not bring them to his lips, willing his emotions to radiate through his arms and body -- affection, desire, contentment, gratitude, protectiveness, possessiveness.
Sherlock and John worked too hard, she tutted to herself while refolding the plaid blanket draped over the back of John’s armchair. Here it was, nearly Christmas, and they didn’t have one single decoration in the flat. Instead, they were out chasing murderers and thieves. It was just so dreary.
Sherlock wanted to place his mouth over each vertebra, but he resisted, opting to let John sleep. Besides, he’d had quite a mouthful of John last night, he recalled with a satisfied smirk.
“It's dangerous to try to re-create the past,” Sherlock continued, his voice low. “Perhaps we should christen a new beginning.”
After another minute he squeezed in the juice of half a lemon, poured a slug of white wine into the pan directly from the bottle. He stirred some more.
He would make the coffee today, although he preferred the way John made it. He ought to do more things for John, he thought while rummaging for the coffee on the kitchen shelf. It was almost Christmas, after all, and one ought to do nice things for one’s significant other.
Molly looked positively radiant as Sherlock smiled down at her, guiding her across the floor. An irrational jealousy stabbed at John. He tried to dismiss it, knowing Sherlock had simply come up with an excuse to avoid more small talk with Mrs. Howard.
Around the time I was mulling over relationships, I was playing a game of Cluedo with Sherlock one Saturday while Dad was out picking up something for us to eat.
“You too.” John grasped the chain around his neck and withdrew his dog tags, an old habit of checking his lucky talisman. His eyes widened. One of the tags was missing.
“I’ve had no complaints,” John laughs. He faces Sherlock, a smile playing over his face. He brushes a stray curl from Sherlock’s forehead, then kisses him again.
He finally let out a ragged sigh. “I suppose we should have told you. But it’s never been that easy.”
He had tried to forget -- God, how he had tried -- but failed. Sherlock had always lingered on the edges of his memory, a touchstone of a happier time.
John swiveled his chair to face Sherlock, his pulse racing, his blood heating as the last black buttons were released. His knees splayed, his cock stirring in anticipation.
They're tired. Too tired, in fact, to do anything but lie in the darkening room, one lamp casting a pool of yellow light in the corner. John runs his fingers lightly over Sherlock's temple, admiring the strands of silver forming there.
John suddenly laughed, amused at his own thought. “I just realized you’re the same age I was when we were together.”
Back in his room, he'd spent several hours reacquainting himself with the instrument. It had been more than a year since he'd last played, and he was painfully rusty. Even reading music -- a skill that used to come easily -- took effort. He vowed to practice more often over the summer, and to bring his violin back to uni with him.
“Superficial,” I repeated doubtfully, staring pointedly at the long, thin knife scar on Sherlock’s forearm where his sleeve was rolled up.
He shut his bedroom door and stretched out on his old bed, closing his eyes for a brief rest before they gathered in the library for tea. In the following days, they would be joined by Mycroft and Uncle Rudy, possibly a distant cousin or two. Various friends and neighbors would drop by, some staying for dinner, others for drinks or card games.
When his parents finally retired to the sitting room after dinner to listen to the wireless, Sherlock took the opportunity to slip outside to the garage. He hadn't asked permission to borrow the car, but he didn't want to interrupt their radio program, therefore it would just be more considerate to simply leave, he reasoned.
Sherlock closed his eyes, wishing he could freeze time or hurtle it forward, wishing he could stop the emptiness that was already gnawing at his chest.
Sherlock relaxes against John's comforting weight, a sensation he seems to have known all his life, and they both sigh softly.
I gaze at him, a flicker of a smile tugging at the corner of my mouth, and he looks away, suddenly intrigued by the fireplace mantel. We sip our drinks, testing out this new space we’ve entered, a place beyond business partners, beyond flatmates, beyond friends. We’re something more, as yet undefined, but the possibility is there, still too fragile to touch.
“Alright, everything’s ready!” Miss Smith called out. She popped her head into the room. “Who wants to go first?”
The other circle is the private world he inhabits with Sherlock -- sheets and skin, whiskey and shadows, precious minutes and long separations. There is a tiny segment where the two worlds overlap, and that space is here -- the weekend visits -- and they are powerfully appealing, but deceptively calm. The storms would come soon enough.
Sherlock didn't move, and John feared that he'd made a mistake in speaking. But then Sherlock's lips were on his forehead, fumbling, gentle, his voice husky.
“Ha! Not likely.” Molly popped part of a biscuit into her mouth. “I went to dances with a few different boys, but…”
The blanket and pillow had disappeared from the sofa by the time I returned downstairs for breakfast. I didn’t say anything about it, and Dad said nothing to me except for the usual morning greetings.
Sherlock scanned the room numbers as he roamed down the dim hallway that smelled unpleasantly of fried potatoes and stale cigarette smoke. The sounds of crude laughter and a wailing baby floated through the thin walls, causing Sherlock to wrinkle his nose in distaste.
He paused, now finding his mouth above John's waistband, at a crossroads. He could stop and stay in relatively safe territory, or press on, continuing to explore. He flicked his eyes down, noting the bulge in John's trousers that had become quite evident.
They were standing close, facing each other, Sherlock's back pressed against the wall. Dad held Sherlock's arms in a light grasp just below the shoulders and was speaking in a calm, reassuring tone, his eyes casting up to Sherlock's, searching for agreement. I recognized that stance; it was the same way Dad spoke to me when I didn't want to do something but had to push through it anyway.
I sat through the headmaster’s stern lecture about my unacceptable behavior, glowering at the front of his heavy oak desk all the while. I knew what they thought of me. Just another troubled girl, angry, out of control, raised by a single parent.
After another minute he pops his head in. Sherlock is wiping his hands on a towel, his face and neck covered in lather.
I finally had to admit defeat and slurred good night. I went upstairs and brushed my teeth, then fell into the guest bed, pulling a quilt up to my chin. Stamford hopped onto the bed and curled into the crook of my legs, and I drifted off.
He slides the photos in between the pages of the diary. Maybe, someday, he’ll meet his John. Or maybe the few days in this house is all he’ll ever have with him. He wishes they had had more time. They never have enough time.
When Sherlock opens his eyes again, he sees her. A woman in a green silk dress is standing at the foot of the bed, black hair swept up elaborately, blood red lips, lively blue eyes, high cheekbones accented by a smug smile. Sparks flit around her like fireflies.
Sherlock glanced disapprovingly at Molly’s elbows resting on the bonnet of the Vauxhall that he was diligently polishing, hoping to erase any sign of the car’s unapproved departure the evening before. So far, his parents had said nothing about it or his late return.
I have to admit, all those Startup gifs of Martin started to meld with the WTF Martin. No matter, both inspirations will work.
Ok, so take a deep breath... we're now in the Cave of Despair, which leads to the Forest of Pining. And after that, I'm happy to say, is the Golden Lake of Reunion.
Sherlock stopped on the pavement, taking in the pretty sight. “When was the last time you were truly a tourist somewhere, and not on assignment?”
Sherlock looked at him, a small smile crooking his mouth. “I can't help but notice you're right here, too.”
"No," Sherlock croaked. He sniffed, sighed again. After five more minutes, he gave up and shuffled back to his room, burying himself under the covers. It hurt to swallow. His eyes ached. He drifted to sleep, too uncomfortable to stay awake.
Sherlock does a hasty cleanup, then maneuvers under the blankets, fitting himself against John, settling into a comfortable position.
He felt much more refreshed, wandering along the streets in the late afternoon. It was still jacket weather, the spring sun not strong enough to warm the deep shadows cast by the tall buildings.
John pictures it, Sherlock’s long fingers gently teasing the dusky pink hole, relaxing the ring of muscle, slipping inside. John places his hands on Sherlock’s hips, his thumbs caressing the taut skin stretched over his hip bones.
He rested his head against the window glass, barely noticing when the train lurched into motion. He let his eyes fall shut, the tip of his tongue touching the small cut on his inner lip, letting the sweet pain sting.
“Thirteen stitches and a possible concussion does not equal grazed,” Dad challenged him through clenched teeth. “You can't go home alone like this.”
Warmth flooded Sherlock’s body. He turned in John’s arms, capturing his bottom lip between his own, his hands running over John’s back. He wanted to feel every inch of John again, relearn every muscle and dip and curve.
The rest of the evening passes uneventfully, and Sherlock is secretly relieved that Dimmock is on duty downstairs. He’s not concerned that someone is lurking in the house — no decent criminal would want to be caught yet, not when the fun is just starting — but he does feel better having Dimmock around for Hannah’s peace of mind.
He hasn’t pushed away thoughts of John out of bitterness or a desire to forget, but as a coping mechanism. The first few weeks back in London had been extremely difficult. Grieving and lonely, he had no one to confide in. Who would ever believe such a story? Hannah, maybe, but she’d immediately taken another job in Edinburgh caring for an ailing widow.
“I suppose so,” Sherlock grinned. His expression gradually grew more serious. “I've missed you.” His hand edged closer to John's on the leather seat, not quite touching. “I can't believe we're really here. I’ve been thinking about it for two months. About you.”
“As a nurse, I’ve seen it all. Blood, bones, bits. Speaking of which,” she bangs the cups back onto the tray, “I’ll clear up and then it’s time for your bath.”
John stops, embarrassed that he got so carried away. Why did he say “our bed sheets?” He meant their own rooms, their separate beds, but it sounded far more intimate. And where did that bit about lovers come from? Had Sherlock ever had a lover? John looks at his feet, then glances up at Sherlock to see if he’s mocking him.
John watched as Sherlock picked up the boomerang, holding it carefully by one end. He was in this far, he might as well see it through to the finish.
They shared a poignant smile, remembering the bittersweet end of that summer. John moved from the desk to the bed, lowering Sherlock to the mattress in a soft embrace.
John looked down at his shoes, suddenly overwhelmed. How could he ever leave this place, leave Sherlock?
Everything in the small space was neat, the bed made, an apple, notebook, and pen lined up on the tabletop. But there was nothing personal on display -- no photos or mementos, no colorful quilt on the bed or potted plant in the window.
Sherlock groans deep in his throat and John lowers his head, licking his way into his pliant mouth. A moan slips from John’s lips as he increases the rhythm, their cocks rigid and leaking. Sherlock is on the edge, so close, needing an intensity that frotting can’t quite deliver.
“Morning,” Sherlock replied without looking at him, concentrating on sliding the omelet from the pan onto the plate.
John gazed at her fondly. He'd known her on and off for almost two years, their paths crossing across continents. He knew she had some bloke back in England, some mysterious government type whom she never really talked about. Still, it didn't stop him from flirting with her. It's what he did to pass the time.
John weaves a little as he hangs up his jacket and Sherlock smiles slightly over the top of his book, knowing John was at the pub.
Sherlock looked down, smoothing the sheet with his hand. “No. They'd throw me to the wolves.” He kept his eyes down. “I can tell you that I used to have a nice little consulting business in London.”
Sherlock is now highly aware of his half-dressed state, of John's eyes on his body. He’s frozen in place again, wanting John to reach out and touch him, just touch him…
Sherlock stood up, holding the envelope with care. He'd go see John right away and tell him about the invitation. He wandered into the hallway, still disbelieving this unexpected stroke of good luck.
Although John’s tone was light, Sherlock noted the undercurrent of self-mockery and an edge of bitterness in his voice. Distracted, he was caught off guard when John looked directly at him.
Staying a respectful distance from the hives, Mr. Holmes showed Sherlock how to start a fire at the bottom of the smoker, using a handful of dry pine needles as kindling. He packed in wood chips and few sprigs of dried mint and lavender, using the bellows to keep the fire lit until a fragrant white smoke puffed up from the canister.
They exchange a look over the nurse's shoulder, and the words of thanks Sherlock wants to say can’t find their way to his mouth. “Go,” he says instead, and Mycroft lingers a moment, nods, and seems to understand.
John ignored Mike and kept glaring at Sherlock. “Still pestering Scotland Yard with your outlandish theories?”
This was heaven, Sherlock thought. All the people he loved most dearly in the same cozy room, nowhere to rush off to, time slowed. He tried to imprint the moment in his mind, knowing that autumn was approaching and nothing would ever be the same again.
John gazed back at him. "Glad to help. Anytime." He held the gaze a moment longer, then shook himself. "So, I'll just go get the..." He forgot what he was going to do.
He looks at me with those piercing eyes and doesn’t answer, turns to the door, clips down the steps.
“A bit. Sherlock was a year ahead of me, and he has an older brother who works for the Home Office. Their mother was a mathematician once… She supposedly helped on all this very hush-hush stuff during the war.”
John takes the candle from Sherlock and blows it out, a wisp of smoke curling into the air. The remaining candles and low-burning fire bathe the room in a golden glow.
“I was hoping for a triple poisoning,” Sherlock mutters, stuffing his phone into his jacket slung over a chair, “not decorating for a pathetic office party.”
His shoulders ached and he glanced toward the shore to judge how far they’d gone out. He could just make out the red blanket and Sherlock's long frame lying across it. It was best to keep his distance, he decided. That would be the smartest course.
They kiss deeply, passionately, finally breaking apart, resting their foreheads together, noses touching, breathing each other in.
The house smelled of fresh cut pine and honeyed wax candles, mulled spices and wood smoke. Drinks were flowing, the phonograph spinning, chatter and laughter rising to the ceiling.
John's hand clasped around his own was warm, his expression softening as he gained confidence. Sherlock gradually let John guide the dance, giving way to his cues.
They fumble through digits and contact lists, then slide into an awkward silence, the evening suddenly drawing to an end.
Sherlock snatched it from the man's hand and tore it open, unfolding the letter with a snap. He scanned the paper quickly, his expression changing several times.
“Here we are.” Mrs Hudson opened the door, allowing John to step inside. “It's snug, but the window lets in good light.”
The beer, the whiskey, the endorphins flooding through John's body made the room spin and he closed his eyes, embracing the carnality of the moment, knowing he was alive.
Sherlock nodded quietly, not sure how to respond, so he said nothing. They eventually headed back to the house.
It always took forever for us to leave, the farewells almost complete, then some other thread of conversation beginning, the two of them standing at the top of the stairs, me pulling impatiently at Dad’s sleeve.
I wasn't particularly convinced about any of it (except for the coffee, which I liked), but I was experimenting, trying to figure out where I fit in. Participating in a ritual to mark the end of life seemed like a much more serious addition to my adult repertoire. Plus I felt bad for Sherlock, of course.
John felt a strange sense of disappointment, as if a scoop of ice cream he’d been looking forward to licking had suddenly dropped to the floor. But then another thought came to him. John stared at his nearly empty glass, slowly beginning to piece together a pattern out of Sherlock’s behavior.
“Me too.” She leaned up to place a chaste kiss on his cheek and he held her briefly, soft and sweet smelling.
Harry and Sherlock seemed to enjoy needling each other, sometimes at the expense of the comfort of those around them. Only this time I didn’t get the joke, and I asked her about it on the way home.
His mother entered the room with a folded newspaper, her crossword puzzle partially completed. She swatted playfully at Sherlock's head with the paper.
John smiled ruefully. “I’ve been a soldier and a war journalist half my life. What the hell do you think that's all about then, hm? Not exactly safe choices.”
“You mean while playing dead.” Sherlock frowns, disgruntled. “What am I supposed to do out in the country? I’ll die of boredom.”
John lifted his face to Sherlock's, their eyes meeting, cautiously amazed. John cupped Sherlock's cheek with his hand, drawing their mouths together.
On Sunday morning, his parents would drive him to the train station to see him off, his mother dabbing at her eyes, his father putting his arm around her shoulders and lifting his hand in farewell. It was always the same whenever he left for the new term.
The pub was quiet, the mid-afternoon lull perfect for studying while having a pint. John closed his eyes, his finger holding the place in the textbook as he silently recited the name of every bone in the body.
Sherlock turned onto his back, letting himself float, his ears covered by the water. He could hear only his own breath and the muffled rippling of small waves. He looked up, the stars glittering against the black dome of the night sky, Venus winking far above.
John took another step, his own confusion clarifying as he gazed at Sherlock, falling under the spell of those mesmerizing eyes and dark curls, that long neck, those plush lips. His inhibitions melted and he stepped closer, giving Sherlock the chance to move away. He didn’t.
He climbed the stairs, hung his coat on the peg behind the door, and pried off his shoes. John glanced up with a quick smile before turning back to the simmering pot. “Vegetable curry tonight,” he said. “With peas, of course.”
Sherlock nods. “This is much better than the mustache.” So much better, he thinks. This majestic sweep of hair is making his stomach flit with butterflies, his fingers itch to bury themselves in it. He wants to nuzzle that wave, tug it, ravish it.
“I’m sure too,” John whispered back, his voice rough with desire, silently thanking the universe for thieves and chalets and impromptu holidays, jeans and jumpers and the brilliant, gorgeous man finally wrapped in his arms.
Once they were in the shed, Mr. Holmes began gathering an assortment of supplies, including an odd metal can with a pointed snout and attached bellows.
He was soon pinned under Sherlock’s intense gaze. “Did I make anything up about you when we first met?”
“Hmm. Could be someone trying to frighten you, taking advantage of the ghost rumors, wanting you to leave the house for some reason.”
She quickly hung up, and Sherlock was left wondering what the mystery was all about -- and what he was going to say to John when he saw him.
It was the same icy touch that had pressed on his chest last night. Sherlock gasps at the coldness, wondering why his brain is concocting this strange encounter.
John has turned it over and over in his mind, the reasons for keeping their lives separate and relationship secret all these years, and he’s had to ask himself if, at some deep level, he feels ashamed. He’s dug at that uncomfortable splinter of a thought, but that’s not it. He no longer gives a damn what other people think about who he is or isn't sleeping with.
He is answered with a tentative touch, a hand laid lightly on his back, just below his shoulder blade, cool at first, then warming.
"The mint," Sherlock offered distractedly, still looking down, looking for something to say. "I like it."
Sherlock hesitated, then let it spill out in a rush. “I want to know what it's like. To be inside of you, your legs wrapped around me. Fucking you.”
“Oh, stop it. I think he’s nice.” She smoothed her hair, flustered. “What’d you do to your neck, anyway?”
Sherlock and Olivia are peering intently at the chess board, strategizing. Olivia must be winning, judging by the pile of fallen pieces on her side of the table. Sherlock puts out his hand, reaching for his queen, then he glances at Olivia. He stops.
He placed the toolbox back on the wooden shelf. There wasn't any point to thinking too far ahead. The only sure thing was the present. He and Sherlock should enjoy the time that they did have. And tonight he was determined to make sure they found time.
In the meantime, want to know what the Vauxhall looks like? It really was a fast, sporty little number.
It's been several weeks so far without physical contact. He's let the messages taper off, and, as of several days ago, go unanswered. It doesn't feel good, but stopping pleasurable things never does.
John stood behind his chair, half considering leaving. He didn't want to argue pointlessly with Sherlock again. He closed his eyes, feeling drained.
Sherlock remains motionless, his shoulders lifting slightly with his shallow breath. “I’m sure I will,” he says softly.
“I'm just tired.” He tried to brush off their concern, but wanted nothing more than to go back to bed. He sat down heavily in a kitchen chair.
Surprisingly, he didn't ask about it. Instead, Sherlock’s eyes continued down John's torso to his stomach and the thin line of dark hair that disappeared under the waistband of his faded jeans.
“I could use some help. Our car’s on the blink, and I promised to run an errand for my mother. Think you could give me a lift?”
Then Mary fell gravely ill, eliminating the need to choose. He was wracked with guilt, knowing that he had not committed fully to her. He always hoped that he could change and learn to find satisfaction with a quiet, steady life, but something held him back.
“Molly,” he greeted her warmly, bending to give her a peck on the cheek. “I didn't know you were coming.”
They both turned their heads to where Molly was standing by the red blanket now laden with food. Sherlock looked back at John, wondering what to say.
John found it difficult to look away from Sherlock's mouth, a thin seam of dried blood lining his swollen lower lip. It made him look wanton, over-kissed. John was highly aware of how their knees nearly touched under the table. He hurriedly swallowed the last of his drink.
John pulls open the door, Sherlock’s name on his lips. Before he can fully understand, the heady scent of pine and a cold wave of winter air rise up to greet him, the trembling green boughs of a tree overtaking the landing as Sherlock thuds the trunk onto the floor with a grunt.
Mrs. Holmes looked up and motioned him to take a seat in the chair that faced her desk. She carefully replaced the cap on her pen. “You’ll be returning to university in a few weeks.”
Sherlock fell forward onto his elbows, panting, John's arms circling his waist. John kissed Sherlock's back through his shirt, his hands smoothing over his bare flanks. “You naughty thing,” John murmured, “with your ideas.”
“Where’d you learn to dance like that?” John asked gruffly, still feeling vaguely chagrined for no good reason.
Sherlock looked at John’s photo, handsome, shirt collar open under his suit jacket, professorial with a touch of rakishness. He had written another well-received novel, several essays, a collection of short stories.
He slid the mirror to the side to banish his reflection, exposing the contents of the cabinet. His eyes flicked over razor and tubes and bottles, landing on a slender glass vial. He picked it up, read the label. Lavender essential oil.
“Tea will be served in 10 minutes, sir.” She craned her neck past Sherlock to peer at John. “Nice to have you back, Dr. Watson.”
“The affairs won't be a secret much longer,” Sherlock pointed out, taking a long drink, his mouth burning pleasantly. “The papers will find out soon enough.”
Sherlock’s enthusiasm waned when he remembered John's family. “Your mother will worry if you don't come home.”
“I'll explain on the way,” Sherlock answered, yanking open the door to the street and sweeping John toward a waiting taxi.
Sherlock punched the pillow next to his head with a sudden viciousness. If that bloody little snitch Anderson hadn't been skulking around and reported him to the proctor, he'd be crossing the Channel right now.
Sherlock rubbed the nape of his neck, unsure if he wanted John to meet his family. It could prove to be quite awkward. On the other hand, he'd get to spend an afternoon with John. “I'll ask him,” he finally agreed, not convinced he actually would.
The doctor takes a few steps closer. “I just moved back to London, so…” he trails off, gazing at Sherlock for several moments. He tilts his head, smiling crookedly. “Sorry, but do we — have we met?”
John buries his face in Sherlock’s shoulder, rutting, grunting, gasping as his orgasm ripples through him, white hot, shuddering. He collapses, breathing heavily, barely aware of Sherlock’s hands running up and down his back, easing him back to earth.
“God, I wanted this,” John murmured against Sherlock’s neck, relishing the sounds coming out of Sherlock’s throat, the bulge of his cock grazing against his thigh. He covered Sherlock’s mouth with his own, pulling away with a suggestive suck on his bottom lip. “I want you in my mouth.”
John felt the familiar sweet tension building in his own body, ratcheted even tighter with the knowledge that Sherlock was about to come. He thrusted harder, racing after that white exploding heat.
John nodded his head toward the dance floor, then watched Dimmock’s smile fade when he located her with Sherlock.
Sherlock gripped John's hand tighter, ignoring the pain in his toe. “Now step back with the right, back sideways with the left, together again -- and there's our box.”
John struggles through the doorway with their bags and drops them onto a chair. They busy themselves with hanging up coats and glancing out the window and arranging shoes neatly by the door.
The week had sped by, the days filled with long walks and fittings, book stores and galleries, the cinema and bohemian restaurants. The nights were warm and lush, carnal and lusty with slick and salty skin, drawn-up knees and sinewy backs, hips plunging.
The rhythm soon increases, the air punctuated by hitched breaths and small moans, squeaking springs and slapping skin. Sherlock closes his eyes, letting his body be used, pleasurably ravaged and plundered by John’s thick cock. He relinquishes control, shutting off his brain and offering his body as a vessel for John’s desires. He wants —
For every taste he had of Sherlock, he wanted more, an insatiable desire permeating every waking moment. When he ate, he thought of Sherlock’s mouth, the taste of his lips. When he worked, he pictured Sherlock’s elegant fingers, the wide span of his hands. When he studied his anatomy text, he imagined Sherlock’s lean muscles, sharp hip bones, the weight of his long, narrow cock in his palm.
“I appreciate your help with my book.” She paused. “You're a good mathematician. You should consider pursuing it.”
John chuckled to himself, embarrassed that Irene’s words had provoked him like this. He was just overreacting, probably still jet lagged. He turned to go back into the house, his eyes caught by the view through the window into the living room. Among all the guests, John could easily pick out Sherlock — his height, the graceful way he carried his trim frame, the contrast of dark hair against pale skin, his long throat and tapered fingers, tight arse…
Sherlock had no idea what to write. He really needed nothing. On the occasions that he did want something – a new shirt, a fine bottle of wine, a luxurious soap – he bought it himself on the spur of the moment.
The police had soon arrived, the suspect cuffed, the case solved. It should have been satisfying but it wasn't, because John had not been there to witness it.
Thank you to everyone who followed along and waited patiently for the ending! I really do appreciate the support, encouragement, and comments from readers like you. I write out of love for the characters, for storytelling, and for the amazing community that comes with fandom. Hugs to you all!
They started reflexively at the sound of breaking glass, heads jerking up, muscles tensing, staring at each other for cues to action. As the burst of adrenaline faded, they smiled, suddenly a bit shy.
His fingers curl around the worn brass handle and he pushes the door open, a shop bell ringing above his head.
“I -- I think it's a smashing idea.” He glanced up, surprised again by the warmth in his mother's expression. “I’ll have to ask John, though.”
After they shoved several chairs out of the way, Sherlock returned the needle to the start of the record, and they took up their positions again.
“Holmes,” John practically spat his name out. He stared accusingly at Mike, who cleared his throat and scrambled to his feet.
John eventually emerges from beneath the duvet, grinning, his face flushed, and kisses Sherlock’s lax mouth, plush and pinked.
He finally located the room he was looking for and stopped in front of the door. He took a deep breath, trying to steady his nerves. His idea was ill-formed, not thought through, but his feet had carried him to this tatty rooming house anyway.
“I want you to,” Sherlock growls, sweeping John closer, lowering his mouth to John’s. He kisses him hard, telegraphing the intensity of his desire. John responds, digging his fingers into Sherlock’s back, hungrily returning the kiss.
John ruminated some more, knotting his tie again, finally satisfied with the result. What he did remember without fail, he reminded himself while straightening his shirt collar, was the weight of Sherlock's body against his own, and how right it felt.
Sherlock knows it’s useless to argue, so he scowls instead, fervently hoping that Mycroft catches his assailant quickly so he can go home to recuperate in peace.
He tore off a crust of bread and nibbled at it between sips of wine. John caught his eye. He had been up in his room working diligently for the past day, revising a section of his novel. It must have gone well, because a warm foot stroked across Sherlock's toes, then traveled up higher to the inside of his ankle.
“Hm? Yeah, sure,” John rubs a hand over his stubbly cheek, feeling a bit buzzed and blurry. “Interesting walk home.”
Sherlock impatiently pushed the pants down, lifting his hips, shifting his legs to free himself from the unwanted constriction. Unfazed, John rolled aside, then resumed his position between Sherlock's knees.
A cool stream of air brushes over his neck. He sits upright, sensing John in the room. He glances at Hannah to see if she notices, but she’s absorbed in an article, absently twisting a lock of hair around her finger. The cold mug of tea suddenly lifts from the table and floats toward the kitchen. He’s clearly meant to follow.
But John sees Sherlock's hands shaking, unsteady, a symptom of withdrawal. He doesn't comment, instead turning to the boiling kettle. He prepares the tea, sets the steaming mugs on the table, followed by sugar, lemon slices, and spoons.
One day John exhaled loudly, tossing his manuscript to the side. Sherlock could feel John’s gaze on him, but he didn’t look up.
John held a pen in his hand, his chair pulled up to the small table in his room, poised to compose a letter to Sherlock -- and couldn't think of what to say. Nothing really had happened since he'd last written. Yes, he'd been made captain and the rainy season had ended, but nothing else of interest came to mind.
John smiled as he slowly pulled back, running his tongue over the frenulum, then sinking the shaft deeper into his mouth, sliding down and up again.
He scratched his short beard, still waking up, wishing he’d stopped for a coffee on the way in. Never mind. He could always take a break later. He loosened his tie and booted up the desktop computer, then sat in the worn chair, adjusting the height and back tension to his satisfaction. He slipped on his reading glasses, logged in with his university ID, and began setting up the online components of the course he’d be teaching during the fall semester.
As we lay together, I tried to imagine what sex would be like with someone I truly loved. Someone I’d cared about for decades, wrapping around them hungrily, then having to watch them leave.
He worked through several boxes, the arrangement of the books haphazard at best. He would be able to find what he wanted easily enough; his memory was uncannily detailed. He added another large handful of volumes to the shelf, then bent down to retrieve more.
“Oh, stop.” She waved him away, embarrassed. She tried to hide a smile, looking down at her hands. “I appreciate it, you know. How you always just let me be myself.”
Nearing John's house, he was pleased to see John in the front yard. He was crouched down, repairing a section of the wooden fence. John stood up when he caught sight of Sherlock, a hammer hanging loosely in his hand, waiting for him to come to a stop.
“Okay, okay,” I begged off, “we can practice again tomorrow.” I threw myself into a chair, tired from the day’s drive and mental exertion of coordination.
They finally drifted apart, breathing heavily, the susurration of the waves the only other sound. Emboldened, Sherlock slipped his hand between John’s legs, palming the bulge beneath the thin cloth of his swim trunks.
He didn’t even know why he had come this year. He’d be heading off to Cambridge in the autumn; he could have stayed at home alone in England. But some sense of loyalty and duty had compelled him to make the annual journey with his parents. Or maybe it was a fear of loneliness.
He was afraid the spark that had ignited between them half a world away wouldn't be the same here. The tension that had permeated their initial meeting two months ago had fed into their whirlwind night of passion, ending with Sherlock stealing his laptop and tanks rolling toward the presidential palace -- hardly a typical start to a romance.
“Oh, those look perfect there.” Molly walks by holding a tray of cupcakes and smiles brightly at John, then less certainly at Sherlock. “Thanks for helping out. It’s all sort of last minute, but I thought a little party would be fun for everyone who has to work the night shift on Halloween.”
He finally turns to look at John, who is quietly gazing at him. Sherlock belatedly realizes he ought to reciprocate, and runs his hand over John’s hip, sliding it down to his cock.
A cup slips from his hand and breaks loudly in the sink. Olivia and Sherlock both look up, startled. John stares dumbly at the sharp fragments.
John didn't know if Sherlock had left the trail of porn as a joke, or research, or some sort of test that he didn't know how to respond to. John simply never mentioned it, only sneaking long looks at the clips now and then, becoming engrossed in the animal beauty of two (sometimes three) hot men fucking their brains out on a giant bed or leather sofa.
He kept his eyes open for a partially fallen stone fence among the trees, which would mean he was nearing the hives. The house and gardens had disappeared from sight by the time he spotted the fence, which he followed until he came to a clearing.
John ran his palm up Sherlock's chest, his voice husky again. “Good, because I've got a lot more to show you.”
John gazed at him, all slim dark suit and coiffed hair, his eyes still electric with adrenaline. What he really wanted to know was how Sherlock had gotten a glimpse of the man’s bare shoulder. “And the tattoo? How’d you know that was there?”
His fingers trailed along the inner cut of the lapel down to the button, fixing the line of the jacket with a gentle tug.
John felt for the lubricant and opened it, his hands surprisingly steady despite the surge of heat running through his veins
“I’m flattered that you’re familiar with my work, Doctor Adler,” John nudged Sherlock aside, intrigued.
He turns his attention back to the computer screen, scrolling through his inbox, hoping for a case to distract him. He can’t actually work while trapped in the countryside — he’s possibly deceased, after all — but he’s desperate enough to check for some sort of puzzle to occupy the time.
It didn't matter, because at that moment Sherlock walked toward him and smiled warmly, beautifully, the smile that was given just for him, and John smiled back, wholly, unconditionally, certain that Christmas would be particularly memorable this year.
Sherlock shrugged. “It was a logical assumption. Australian merino wool is quite distinct.” Sherlock paused. “But so was the label that said ‘Knitted in Melbourne.’”
He breathes John in, wood smoke and sunlight, whiskey and mint, runs his hands over biceps, across shoulder blades, the rasp of stubble burning his cheeks.
“I don’t know for sure,” Sherlock admits. “The police made an arrest, but it may have been a job for hire.”
Lost in his thoughts, he almost didn't recognize the figure pushing a bicycle along the side of the road, little more than a silhouette against the evening sky. He slowed, then stopped, the gears whining as he reversed.
Impressions washed over him -- Sherlock on his knees, the crown of curls gilded by firelight, slick fingers and tongue and mounting pleasure, the creak of leather cushions, his own stifled cry of release.
At that moment, the lights flicker and die, the temperature suddenly dropping. John’s eyes snap to Sherlock's. Without warning, a small game table next to Sherlock's chair falls over with a crash, a Scrabble board and letter tiles scattering across the rug.
The best part of my face is my eyes. They're dark blue with long lashes. Sherlock told me once that I had my father’s eyes. I joked that I’d better give them back, and he glanced at me sideways with a pained expression, then smiled.
Sherlock clasped him tighter, sucked the side of his neck, gently biting, hips pumping. John moaned, shuddered, come streaking the tile, glistening, dripping, his body dissolving like sugar.
“Sherlock? John? Are you in there?” Molly’s concerned voice pierces the door, shattering their bubble of frenzied groping.
His mother was doing the caretaking, while he was assigned the role of gardener, handyman, errand boy, mechanic, and anything else needed to repair Great Aunt Helen’s long-neglected cottage and rambling yard.
“The point is, she always said there are things around us that are just beyond our understanding. They're there; but we don't know how to see them. Or if we do, we catch only glimpses.”
He disappeared behind the closed door to face the headmaster, and for the first time I felt like crying. But I didn’t.
“You’re back.” Sherlock stated the obvious, but he was caught off guard by the sight of John in a cream-colored knit jumper, his face more handsome than he remembered.
The flat was in a central London location and owned by a sweet and slyly libertine landlady, Mrs. Hudson. He had helped her with a problematic ex-husband, and in exchange she had reduced the monthly rent. She lived downstairs, sometimes popped in with tea, and said nothing about Victor’s odd visiting hours.
“Those would leave a deeper wound,” John said. “I think it was something smaller, lighter. Whatever it was must have killed him instantly.”
Two days later Sherlock's throat was sore and raw and his voice went hoarse. He sat on his chair in his blue dressing gown, knees hugged to his chest, looking miserable.
“If you hadn’t thrown that first snowball,” John reminds him, pinching his icy arse in return, “we’d be nice and warm, wouldn’t we?”
I lean back in my chair and let my eyes drift shut, soaking in the heat of the fire, the closeness of Sherlock, the occasional clink of ice, and I’m filled with a quiet joy, grateful for the moment.
“Why do we die? Car crash? Heart failure? Bullet to the brain? Could be a million things. But how it happens -- natural or unnatural causes, accident or foul play -- that's the good stuff.”
He finally noticed John sitting on a high metal stool in the corner. Their eyes locked, an unspoken current passing between them.
Sherlock can feel a bulge pressing against his own stiff cock, heightening his arousal. He rubs against John, rocking his hips in answer to John’s probing tongue, a moan escaping his lips.
I glance at Sherlock. He’s wedged into the corner, his head partially resting on the window glass, his eyes closed. His face looks softer in this light, most of the tension gone. He’s drained, unusually tired by the frenzy of questions and glare of camera lights. Sometimes he seems to perversely relish the banter, baiting reporters or embarrassing the police with his sharp tongue. This time, however, he was unusually restrained.
John lowered his bike into a hydrangea bush and watched the window carefully. It would be a disaster if Mr. or Mrs. Holmes or one of the servants caught him lurking outside in the gardens. He had no idea what his excuse would be. He willed someone to come to the window and peer out; two seconds, that’s all he would need to identify the face.
Morning light slants through the sitting room windows in Sherlock’s flat, illuminating the hem of his blue dressing gown. He stares at the wall covered with newspaper clippings, maps, photographs, and receipts, looking for a pattern in a series of crimes, a hidden connection that’s still eluding him.
They hold the gaze, each seeing a vulnerability in the other that is a surprise. They both want to glance away, embarrassed; yet they continue to look, finding something more compelling.
John wasn't sure what she meant by manage, and he frowned a little. Doubt nagged at him, but he really didn't want this opportunity to slip by. Besides, he'd lived and worked with all types of men in the army in much closer quarters. The real deciding factor would be if he could afford the rent. He rubbed his forehead, uncertain what to do. His leg was starting to throb and his head hurt.
“God, I’ve missed you,” John breathed raggedly against Sherlock’s neck, their cocks trapped between their undulating bodies. Sherlock rolled onto his back as John’s mouth trailed down his throat, skimmed to his collarbone, licked and suckled at his nipples.
They stand naked, kissing, caressing in the dim light, the sound of their ragged breathing echoing against the tiles.
Donovan suddenly scraped her chair back and stood up. “You're such a fucking idiot!” She threw her drink into Anderson’s face and stalked away, a few hoots and claps following in her wake.
He pictured this: John’s cock was uncut, thick, not overly long. Hefty. That was the word that came to mind. A pleasing handful. He hoped to soon find out.
Chatter floated around me. Someone had abandoned a half-empty glass of white wine on a shelf, so I stealthily palmed it and took a drink with my back turned to the room. I glanced back. I didn't see my dad and no one seemed to notice me, so I grew bolder and took another swig. I grimaced at the sour taste, but finished the wine anyway.
The day just keeps getting better, John manages to think as Sherlock’s palms run down his chest. Sherlock is in one of his assertive moods, and John is eager to follow his whims.
The thought of John’s touch made him groan, his head tilting back, exposing more of his neck. John kissed him under his jaw, down his throat, hovering over the love bite from the first night. His fingers teased at the pearly button.
It feels deliciously good, the warm, wet friction sliding over his shaft. John's hand embellishes the movements with a steadily increasing rhythm, his mouth wrapped hungrily around Sherlock’s heavy cock.
Sherlock gripped John's waist, using the leverage to rut against him. After a few more delicious thrusts, John grasped Sherlock's wrists and bent forward, trapping Sherlock's hands on either side of his head.
They kissed again, softer this time, fingers gradually pulling at shirt tails, sliding off jumpers, working at buttons, easing down trousers, undressing. They lifted the bed covers, sliding under the cool sheets and the cozy weight of the duvet.
John brushes his lips against the base of Sherlock’s neck. He hears Sherlock’s sharp inhale, feels the shaky exhale. He knows how sensitive Sherlock’s throat is and expertly threads his way up higher, kissing and lightly sucking his skin, his reward a low groan of pleasure.
John watches him from the shadows, taking in his trim waist, sinewy limbs, long fingers and toes. His body is lovely, a Greek god chiseled from marble, one stretching an arm to the highest shelf to satisfy his weakness for sweets. John smiles as Sherlock rips open a packet of ginger biscuits and dumps several onto a plate. At this moment, Sherlock is endearingly human, and for a moment, John’s fears melt away.
Sherlock turned to face her, wary. His parents had never met John, only knowing about his existence through the occasional vague references that he had made. “Doing what?”
John turns his head slightly, just as Sherlock turns his. Their eyes meet, and John’s gaze falls to Sherlock’s mouth. He lowers his lashes and slowly leans down, their lips nearly touching. John hesitates, a wisp of uncertainty holding him back, until he feels fingertips sliding into his hair behind his ear, pulling him down into a tentative kiss.
My feet moved forward on their own, gliding silently toward the bathroom. I don’t know what I was thinking, why I was so compelled to go closer, but I did.
Sherlock smiles, then flips open the cap, squeezing a generous amount of lube into his hand. He circles John’s cock, coating his shaft until it glistens. He adds another squeeze of lubricant to his fingers, then reaches behind him, his face settling into concentration.
He knows the owner. They have an agreement. He needs to fill this ache with something. Salt, tang, flesh yielding between his teeth, heat filling his mouth.
He carefully rolled up his sleeve and eased out the stinger with his fingernail, cursing his carelessness under his breath. His father's words came back to him again:
Sherlock admired John's thighs and backside, using the brief lull to pry off his shirt and socks that had been forgotten. John was soon stretched beside him again, condom snugged on, lube in hand, his mouth by Sherlock's ear.
Sherlock glanced at him, saw the apprehension in John's eyes, then the veil that fell into place, his expression remote.
That would be the end of the matter from his father. He was a man of few words, perennially cheerful, often lost in his own thoughts. Events both pleasant and unpleasant tended to wash over him, leaving him largely unruffled, at least on the outside. He wasn't emotionless; it was more of a shrugging acceptance of whatever the fates cared to dish out. Sherlock marveled at this, wondering what it would be like to be so naturally placid.
It was well after ten by the time they visited Dimmock off-duty at his small house in the village, presented the boomerang, and spun their story for him.
Guided by the moonlight spilling through the windows, they find two large candles decorating a table near the foyer and several tall tapers in the dining room.
Sherlock looked around, finding everything had a memory tied to it -- the glasshouse, the bicycle, the flagstone path and roses. In unspoken agreement, they headed toward the beehives, John pushing his bike through the dewy grass.
“Bloody hell,” John heard himself say. He wasn't usually caught off guard, but the man burned with an energy that crackled across the room. Those piercing eyes, the corded tendon running down his neck, the buttons straining over his chest…
We lived just outside of London near Aunt Harry, and on weekends Dad and I would often take the train into the city to do some shopping or see a film or try a new restaurant. I loved those long Saturdays, just strolling around and chatting with each other.
A look flashed across her face like she was going to say something else, but then she smiled and bumped her shoulder into mine. “Yeah, of you.”
I liked Matthew. I liked how he was slowing things down by kissing me more gently. I liked his mouth on my neck. I shivered when his lips hovered over my breasts, delicately placing them over one nipple, then the other.
John tilted his head to look at Sherlock, clearly reading his thoughts. “Your parents might appreciate a keepsake of you, too.”
The disgust in Sherlock's tone was reassuring. John’s anger gradually dissipated, his voice softening. “Where are you?”
He soon appears in the doorway, the sheet around his shoulders, something in his hand. He holds it out to John.
He pushes open the bedroom window that leads to the fire escape, welcoming the cool air. He sits on the window sill and smokes, his mind back in the safe house, indulging in the handful of hours he shared with John.
Sherlock smiled back, enjoying the pressure of John's hand on his waist, the new ease of their synchronized movements, the tease of their bodies held close but not quite touching. They gazed into each other's eyes, the room around them fading as they slowly turned round and round.
His parents always hired a summer resident, usually a graduate student, to handle their correspondence, edit manuscripts, and run errands. In exchange, the resident received a modest stipend and the afternoons off to work on their own writing while his parents taught. They lived in the villa as part of the family and were always assigned the bedroom next to Sherlock’s with a shared bath across the hall. Sherlock lumped the residents in with the other students, nodding politely, saying good morning, showing them the book store and post office in town when they first arrived.
“And then he had the nerve to ask if he could borrow my car! Can you believe that, after what he did? I told him to sod off.” She slumps back in her chair. “What a dick.”
Sherlock stared down at the empty entryway where John had been standing moments before. His fingers were gripped tightly around the bannister, his knuckles white. He debated rushing after John but decided against it, instead returning to the sitting room to pace.
He can’t remember all the details of what happened. His last memory was of stepping out of a cab… going where? It was night, a cold rain had left puddles that reflected wavy streaks of neon light… a bar? Restaurant? He’d spoken to someone, then left, stepping out the back way into an alley, wrinkling his nose at the overwhelming odor of trash bins and piss. He turned at a sudden sound, then there was a flash of light, searing pain, blackness.
She inclined her head and departed, and Sherlock turned to John, their gazes settling on each other. “It's good to see you. You look well.”
Sherlock accepted it, rubbing at his wet hair, finally settling the towel around his shoulders. John was watching him, standing close, still amused.
They were on an open stretch of road, and Sherlock sat back as the car gained speed, the landscape blurring by, the wind tossing and tangling their hair.
Sherlock rests his head on the back of the couch, his hands loose in his lap. John’s hand drifts closer, his pinky brushing against Sherlock’s, venturing into a few gentle strokes.
They talked more, ordered a third round, not thinking to eat. They started to feel the gin, their tongues loosening.
He couldn't work, couldn't read, couldn't compose, his mind a swirling eddy, recalling skin and mouths and his early dawn departure as he crept back to his own room. He'd slept in late, waking thirsty and flushed, reluctant to move from bed until the day had passed and night freed them to be together again.
He hastens to the door, his mind speeding to his leather satchel – scalpel, sutures, ointments – worried that Sherlock is injured again. It would be just like him, managing to get himself shot or stabbed on Christmas Eve.
John was intrigued, beguiled, maybe more than a bit smitten with a near stranger … his mouth… and eyes… and voice and hair and hands, how he both took control of and gave himself over to John -- that dynamic was scintillating, exciting, and John craved more.
He turned away. That was it then. No chance there. He drained the last dregs of beer, preparing to leave. He’d head back to his room, maybe edit a few more photos before bed. There was one in particular that needed the exposure toned down, the colors cooled a bit…
“I had to see you,” John confessed against Sherlock's neck that smelled of the white smoke used to lull the bees. John licked his skin, wanting to taste it. He wanted to taste every inch of Sherlock's body, wanted to explore him like a bee delving into the hollow of a flower.
When Sherlock gazed back at him with a certain languid look, John peeled off his own shirt, providing a little more enticement. If he happened to flex his biceps and pectorals more than necessary as he removed the shirt, it couldn't be helped.
John pressed himself up onto his hands to gaze into Sherlock’s eyes. “Touch yourself,” he encouraged.
Sherlock's thighs are warm and firm against John’s, but this thought is soon replaced by the heat of Sherlock's hand curling around both of their cocks. God, he loves those enormous hands, but he may love the round ass perched on his knees even more. Actually, he can't decide, because Christ, that hand is moving in enticing ways.
John closed his eyes, unable to ignore what he had kept buried for so long. He understood now that it was possible to love two very different people in two very different ways, one sealed by two years of marriage, the other by a summer of intense passion.
jumped out at him. He selected a few boxes and waited in line to pay, throwing a tin of mints onto the counter at the last minute.
“Please, John.” His voice quakes. He's never wanted anything more in his life. “Please say you'll come with me.”
The sitting room had been transformed -- the fireplace mantle had been wrapped in fairy lights and green garland, more twinkling lights framed the windows, ornaments hung from every nook and cranny, fresh sprigs of pine and berries sprouted from vases, and a sprig of mistletoe dangled from the door leading to the kitchen. A low fire burned in the fireplace, bathing the room in warm light.
“Good, I’m glad.” Although Sherlock’s voice is calm, inside he’s leaping with joy. “We should exchange numbers so I can reach you.”
By the time John eases the tip of his cock into him, Sherlock’s hands are greedy, clasping at John’s shoulder blades, urging him on.
It was a vision that trailed him far too frequently, one that he could temporarily put to rest with a desperate wank in the shower or in his bed late at night. John felt the familiar hunger stirring and he quickly looked away, concentrating on the stream of cars and bicyclists heading into town. The dance was apparently attracting every young person within a 50-mile radius.
“You’ve experienced trauma.” She places a hand on his shoulder, giving it a gentle squeeze. “It’s okay. It’s going to take some time to process that.”
John loosened his tie, then pulled the knot free, sliding it out of his collar. “I hate these things.” He wadded the tie into his pocket, undid his top shirt buttons. “I was engaged once.” He added this information almost as an afterthought. “It didn’t work out. She was a poet.”
This time, they have the luxury of going slowly. It feels heady, surreal, to move to the quiet bedroom illuminated by the glow of streetlights. Loosened shirts and jeans and trousers slither off, pants and socks skim away, and they stand facing, tracing lines delicately along arms, hardly daring to lower their eyes down the length of torsos to the thatches of dark hair and hardening cocks.
“Hm.” Sherlock's eyes traveled over the shelves groaning with books. They were drowning in history right here.
“Then what if somebody’s still in the house, hiding, just waiting to kill us?” Hannah nervously strokes her throat.
“We’ve released no public update on your condition. An internet rumor seems to have sprung up in the absence of information.”
It took John a moment to understand his invitation, but then he laughed. “You’re not serious.” He expected Sherlock to give way with a grin, but he simply raised his eyebrows a fraction. “Are you really serious?”
Sherlock gripped the sheets as John's mouth continued to explore the tender skin of his inner thighs, fingers curving under his arse, sliding up and teasing over his perineum.
Sherlock swept into the shop where he was greeted with professional courtesy. Sherlock introduced John, then the proprietor led them to a wall of deep shelves filled with bolts of fabric and a table piled high with swatches.
Sherlock's hands were so big, so elegant. They were the type of giant hands that could cradle a person’s entire head during a searing kiss…
He searches around and under the sofa, then the desk and tables without success. Exasperated, he hunts Hannah down in the kitchen.
John smiles, delighted at the image of a young Sherlock running about his grandmother’s gardens, digging in the dirt and studying rocks and plants. “That’s lovely.”
Sherlock had his bandaged arm outstretched on the tabletop, and my dad’s hand was extended toward it. I couldn’t see what he was doing, my view obscured by a pile of books and files. Maybe he was checking the bandage or taking his pulse.
The ripe flesh gave slightly under the pressure of his fingers. He pushed his thumbs into the stem end, curious to see if he could force the pit all the way through, thrilling to the juicy yield of the fruit as the pit slithered out, juice running down his hands.
John takes hold of the support beam of the shorter specimen and rolls it toward the door. He grasps the door handle, but it doesn’t budge. He rattles the handle again, but it refuses to open. “Shit. It’s jammed.”
It’s not the first time he’s studied John. Oh, he’s mapped every detail from his head to his toes, cataloging John’s fine hands and shapely ears and long lashes and strong thighs, and, yes, that intimate region that is now hovering mere inches from his face.
Sherlock felt himself blush, amazed that he could still be flattered so easily by John's words. He tugged John closer, falling back into the spell of the night, their lips a mere breath apart. “You're a flirt,” he teased.
“Okay!” Mike jumped to his feet. “We’re definitely out of time. Let’s thank our guests for sharing their insights with us today!”
Now at the cafe, Sherlock dug through the sheaf of papers in his satchel, finally locating the letter from John he'd received that morning. He hadn't had a chance to read it yet, only scanning the postmark to note that it had been mailed in November.
Sherlock opened the envelope, smoothing out the sheet of paper, recognizing the sloping handwriting. John described training a new cohort of recruits
His pale eyes held mine, his face inscrutable. Then I saw the faintest crack in the facade, a tiny tremor as years of secrecy began to collapse. He looked away.
John smiled then leaned forward, placing a hand on Sherlock’s knee. In the dancing shadows of the firelight, he slid his palm to his thigh, leaning closer.
The smile that plays across Sherlock's mouth unfurls a coil of warmth in John’s belly, making him forget everything else except for the sensuous lips he's about to cover with his own.
Sherlock's fingers bit into his scalp, his breath ragged, his bare arse pressed against the glass, his thighs trembling as if resisting the urge to plunge into John's throat. “Fuck -- I'm close --”
The train was stuffy and reeked of body odor. By the time I rang Matthew’s doorbell, my shirt was soaked under my armpits.
Sherlock rolled his eyes then waved the student in, and John left to let them speak in private. He nursed his coffee while looking out the window at the end of the hallway. Several inches of snow had fallen a few days ago, blanketing the campus in a sparkling cloak of white. He watched students rushing to class or strolling to the library, some walking hand in hand.
John tugged Sherlock down to his mouth, whispering his praises before delivering a devilish kiss. “You're a goddamned prodigy.”
“Oh, I don’t know,” she pushed the rice around on her plate with wooden chopsticks. “I suppose if I met the right person I’d consider it.”
Okay, so my ability to maintain slow burn with these two is pretty much nil. The sultry summer is too much! I give up trying to hold them back and will let them do what they so badly want to do.
“Do what?” John peers down at the table. On the board, neatly arranged letters spell out three words.
Sherlock almost smiles, feels his heart rate slowing. He will let Mycroft guide him through this. He knows he can't do it alone.
He reaches out, finds the bottle of lube in the bedside table drawer. He holds it, warming it in his hand. He lifts an eyebrow, his voice a velvety ribbon. “Shall I fuck you… or you fuck me?”
He pulled on his clothes and went downstairs to the kitchen to make breakfast. There was no sign of Sherlock.
Or maybe it was his age, his relative inexperience. Maybe he was nothing but a confused boy to John, tempting, but best kept at a distance.
After lunch, Sherlock retired to his room and read a little, falling asleep after just a few pages. He woke an hour later to find the book still open on his chest, surprised that he'd drifted off. He clearly wasn’t used to all this fresh country air and sunshine, he mused.
Sherlock rubbed his face, attempting to clear his head. He was still a bit drunk, but felt no pleasure in it. He stood up, his balance off-kilter, and stumbled to the door. He leaned against the wall for a moment, debating whether he should take the call or just hang up.
Settling onto the bed, he opens the box and carefully removes the leatherbound diary, then sifts through the photographs. He gazes at John’s image, missing him. He pages through the diary, reading his favorite passages.
“Not at all. And you are invited as my guest, per my parents’ request. There's even a new suit in it for you.”
“Your arse is a block of ice,” Sherlock growls back, nibbling John’s earlobe and squeezing John’s decidedly chilly bum.
The gloves had warmed with John's body heat and gave off the rich scent of leather. He brought them closer to his nose, picking up faint traces of cologne and cigarettes. It was the sort of warm scent that you wanted to wrap yourself in, like a cozy wool blanket on a snowy day.
We fell into his bed, wet hair and skin dampening the sheets. Naked, kissing, practically rolling over each other in a tangle of arms and legs.
“If you came here to tell me you want to move out, I understand. I don't blame you.” Sherlock glanced over his shoulder at John. “I just wanted to apologize properly before you go.”
John followed the directions the young housemaid at the Hall had given him, hoping he was heading the right way. He felt self-conscious, wandering across the immense manicured lawn, into a formal rose garden, through a cutting garden filled with riotous colors, and on toward a copse of trees.
He was fond of Victor but would not call it love. That was a word he vowed never to use again. Their arrangement was simple and agreeable, and it was enough.
Sherlock shook his head. He didn't have a plan; he didn't even know why he'd stopped. John was looking at him, waiting for an explanation. He scrambled for an excuse. “I thought you might like to give it a try. Taking the car out for a drive, I mean.”
The tread of heavy footsteps in the hallway and jauntily whistled tune made them both freeze in place. They waited, tense, until the bathroom door across the hall swung open on its creaky hinges and closed with a firm bang.
“Who was that back there?” he asked, tilting his head toward the stately stone house they were passing.
He sags against the drawer top, still drifting. John withdraws, finishing himself off with a few quick strips of his hand, the head of his cock pressed against Sherlock’s arse. Warm come spills down his cleft, dripping onto the back of his thighs.
