"Hm?" was Castiel's absentminded response.
But before Castiel could reply to that, Dean captured his lips in another intoxicating kiss. And he felt himself responding to him once more; Dean felt him giving himself over to the side that wanted him. When he pulled away for a second time, the reluctance in his shocking blue eyes was even more obvious, but Dean purposefully held himself back from him.
The higher he went, the larger Dean's eyes became and his head fell completely back against the pillow…His hand seemed to have a mind of its own when it moved slowly to run over Cas's side underneath his coat and he felt the tremble in Cas's body.
"Hello, Dean…"
"I *know* that, Cas! And did you just say frolicking? Never mind…anyway I thought that this tie…ya know…it was kind of like how I used to picture where heaven might be when I was a kid…" Dean looked away completely embarrassed now and tried to get the tie, but Cas put it behind his back and gave Dean a look that said "Stop taking my present!"
"Dean are you quite alright?"
Castiel could only stare into Dean's eyes begging for understanding and knowing he would receive none. Dean couldn't know what torment it was to stay away from him, how every time he felt Dean's need he had to physically restrain himself to the point where he'd collapse from sheer exhaustion and pain…all foreign concepts to Castiel.
"Cas…what were you going to say?"
"Dean I know you think I've abandoned you. I know you expect everyone to abandon you, but I will never abandon you. I haven't come to you because I can't bear to see your face when I tell you I can't help your brother because you think I don't want to."
"I…I didn't come because of Sam because I have nothing to offer in regard to him."
Castiel released a breath he hadn't realized he was holding when Dean closed the gap between them. He placed his hand on Dean's wrist and just held the fabric of his long sleeve shirt between his fingers. Dean bent his hand towards Castiel's and hesitantly began to stroke the front of Castiel's hand with his middle finger. Castiel let out an audible sigh.
Castiel looked as if he was about to speak, but then stopped and tilted his head in a beyond puzzled expression.
Castiel froze. Removing his hands from his eyes, he looked to the left and saw the outline of the Dean perched lightly on the edge of his bed. As he pushed himself into a sitting position, Dean flicked his wrist on the wall he was near and an electric fireplace illuminated the room Castiel was currently occupying…and the smirk on Dean's face.
"I've been meaning to analyze more closely the everyday troubles that face…Charlie Brown? And what appears to be a morbidly obese orange feline."
Dean shuddered at the vibration his deep voice made against his sensitive throat. "Cas I don't know if I can't do this…if I want this…"
"An angel cry? Absurd." Castiel thought to himself, but he hadn't been just an angel for a long time and he had the Winchesters to thank for that – specifically Dean.
"Dean…our bond…you alone can make me forget myself and you alone can feel my true form. Just as I can feel you when I'm not on this earth you can feel me."
"Dean…" Castiel's voice had dropped several octaves and one might have thought he was upset if they didn't know the circumstances. "I don't think you understand – "
"Cas I…we…there was no other option Cas. You used that same God damn reasoning with me when I confronted you about making shady back alley deals with fucking Crowley!"
"I love you Dean Winchester. I love you with every fiber of my being and I will bond to you," Castiel gripped Dean's hand and took the initiative to hover over him this time – gaining back a bit of his old self as he tilted his head to the side.
Dean's smirk grew wider as he answered, "I've been looking for you actually and I remembered you saying once that you had come across an old Victorian in Lexington that "spoke to you" " he imitated Castiel's voice, which Castiel found to be slightly too deep. "So I figured I'd try it…I had been wandering around this piece of shit house and then I heard something…you've been calling my name in your sleep for the past half hour you know."
It didn't take any sort of consideration for Castiel to come up with an answer, "N-no."
"Look, Dean we need to look at the bigger picture! We all love Cas, but he knowingly sided with Crowley – pretended to destroy him! God only knows how long he's been lying to us, Dean! He betrayed our trust, especially yours, Dean! Bobby is just trying to- "
"You."
up while we're gone.
Castiel stared at him, utterly dumbfounded by the words that had just come out of Dean's mouth. Silence echoed between them for what seemed like an endless minute before Castiel could reply.
Dean tilted his head to the side in acquiescence and Castiel literally had to concentrate on stopping his jaw from dropping open once again.
"Enough!" Bobby had yelled. "This…" he gestured all around them "is bad enough without you two idgits turning on each other! Bringing up old wounds is not going to help us right now where Cas is concerned so knock it off!"
"How though?"
Dreams of Dean came back thick and fast as Castiel slept – taking a brief moment to rest in the chaos that was his life currently. And this time he did not have Dean's hurtful and cold touch that wreaked of distrust and sadness to hold them back as the dreams pulled at his mind, taunting and teasing him with the bond between he and Dean. Breathing heavy, his eyes continually snapped open, breaking whatever trance that his dreams held him in; only for Castiel to drift back into another dream even more persuasive than the last.
"Every time I see what appears to be a very opinionated cat kicking a rather unrealistically drawn dog off a table in order to eat Italian food I will think of you."
"But why didn't you ask for help, Cas? Why didn't you talk to us?"
"Dean tell me what I can do." Castiel spoke against his neck while inhaling deeply – Dean's scent was unparalleled – a combination of sandalwood, leather, and something characteristically Dean.
"Oh I think if I put on this tie I'll be very funny…Dean don't get up! Dean come on!" Castiel grabbed Dean's hand and pulled him back down, "I'm sorry, Dean…I really do love it! I shall wear it every day!" Castiel was so worried that he had gone too far in his teasing that he was rushing to show Dean how much he did appreciate the little token.
Watching Sam fall into that cage was probably the hardest thing he had ever had to let happen. Seeing him tumble effortlessly into that godforsaken shit hole and knowing what awaited him beyond the gates made him want to…
"I guess so…" Dean walked over to the desk and picked up his bag, prepared to head out for good when a small package crudely wrapped in newspapers and held together with rubber bands and what appeared to be duct tape fell out of the top compartment. A sudden look of apprehension and hopeful sadness washed over Dean's face as he surveyed the small item he had been carrying with him for three weeks now. He snorted to himself and shook his head as Castiel pondered the small package that was causing the muscles in Dean's strong jaw to contract.
Dean didn't even have to turn around, but he slowly did after saying "I honestly didn't think you'd show up…"
"How did you-?" Castiel stared to ask.
Castiel gave s sharp intake of breath as Dean moved between his knees, he felt him slide the trench coat past his shoulders along with the suit jacket so he could have better access to the collar. Dean's green eyes looked so beautiful in that moment as he was trying to unknot the original tie, they were focused entirely on the situation at hand and the tie was clearly winning as it had been knotted for some time. Castiel noticed that Dean's tongue was peeking out of the corner of his mouth as his brows knotted in consternation. Castiel couldn't stop his hand as it reached for Dean's stubble covered face.
"Yes," he said, trailing his hands up the arch of his back in a way that was agonizingly slow.
Dean moved toward him, his hands settling lightly on either side of his waist, ruffling the thin material there. Castiel's eyes closed as he tried to ignore the fact that he wished that the material of his shirt was not separating his skin from his. His back arched against Dean slightly as he pulled his hips to his.
"For what it's worth, Dean…thank you. I've…I've…."
"Cas do you want me to do this or not?" Dean asked shakily, wondering if there were better things he could be doing with that tie…
Castiel looked up at him from his position on the bed, his head in his hands, fingertips running through his tousled hair.
"Well one of us has to be…there!"
Dean's lips were swollen and his cheeks were tinged pink. Cas let out a pent up sigh as he let his head fall against Dean's shoulder, trying to calm himself down. He knew his desire was painfully obvious to Dean, which would explain his reluctance to just let it happen.
He slowly slid the long tie from under his collar, the only sound being the fabric on fabric swishing. Cas' collar was unbuttoned at the top and Dean had a difficult time looking away, especially since Cas was still holding onto him. Without breaking eye contact, Dean reached for the novelty tie and moved upward so he could get the tie around Cas' neck.
Castiel opened his eyes and realized to what Dean was referring to – his wings.
Castiel's eyes were closed and he knew he had brought this sweet torture on himself.
Dean too looked at the scar and then met Cas's haunting blue eyes, "Do you regret it?"
He placed his lips softly against Dean's and gave a gentle suck to his lower lip, relishing in the sound of Dean growl in the back of his throat.
"You don't."
"But you didn't know that, Cas!"
Dean shoved Castiel away in anger, surprising both of them, "You should have asked us first, Cas!"
That was the Cas Dean knew. Dean shook his head and took one last look at Cas who just at that moment looked up at Dean with a completely fake smile on his face, pretending to be enamored with what he thought was the gift. Dean busted out laughing and Castiel's face became even more confused.
Slowly the contents within became visible and Dean became a little more fidgety in his seat, as if he was second guessing his gift.
"Well first thing that comes to mind is you're a dude – "
Castiel gasped and his eyes flashed open, only to find Dean's green piercing eyes staring intensely back at his.
"Cas, that isn't the present. That is a newspaper. Rip apart the paper and you'll find the real gift you dork."
Castiel continued while Dean felt the tears begin to cascade down his face at the recollection of his most hidden memories.
Dean continued to pace his motel room trying to figure out what the hell he did in a past life to deserve all of this. He was finally getting the normal life he always wanted – he had Lisa and Ben, a real family, but that was sure as dead.
"You really are too perfect."
Dean placed Cas's hand on the side of his face as he began to help with the buttons, running a finger down the middle of Cas's chest and stopping when he reached his naval. He could feel Cas's abdomen tighten and could see the growing bulge protruding from his pants – mimicking his own. He realized that he had never seen Cas out of these clothes and took a moment to admire his shirtless body. He didn't consider himself sexually attracted to men, but Cas was no ordinary man – and his body was unlike any other male form in his eyes. He took in the smattering of almost black chest hair that collected into a trail near the waistband of his pants. His body was thin, but clearly defined that ended in a pronounced V shape at his hips, still partially covered.
Castiel increased his pressure against Dean and both were rewarded by the low growl in Dean's throat and gasp turned moan that Castiel let out when he felt teeth slide across his throat. Dean could feel Cas's erection against his lower abdomen and with every movement he made against it the tighter Cas's hold became on him.
town for any leads – try not to "Dean" things
Dean leaned forward and tentatively kissed Cas's bare shoulder blade – earning a rewarding groan from Cas as their bare chests met. Cas ran his hand over Dean's large biceps and reveled in the sensations Dean was creating within him with his hesitant touches. Still straddling Dean – he felt his growing arousal and allowed himself a moment to close his eyes and just revel in the feeling of Dean.
"My wings, Dean…did you forget I was an angel?" He moved Dean's head so he could smile upon his face.
"I've been asking you to be here for days you dick!" Dean accused.
Dean felt his body tightening around Cas and the mixture of pain and pleasure was almost too much to bear – he had never seen Cas so vulnerable, so exposed before him as he was right now – completely at ease with himself and laying all of his happiness down before him to do what he pleased with it. He could feel Cas moving more sure within him and allowed him to move faster, feeling his own member tightening with every stroke. He could hear faint noises coming from where Cas was buried in his neck and realized he was speaking.
"As much as I dislike having to persuade you into agreeing to this Castiel, you don't really have a choice. You're too vulnerable at the moment and I am not losing one more night of sleep worrying about you imploding on a power trip."
Castiel smiled and let out a low chuckle, "Dean you really shouldn't take the Lord's name in vain…"
Cas laid a hand upon his cheek and ran his knuckles up and down, "I have to concentrate to keep them inside of me…but when I…lose myself..." he gave Dean a knowing look, "they appear."
"Don't ask me things I don't understand…despite everything we both know we don't hate you…*I* don't hate you. This isn't my first supernatural blowup and if the three of us continue to ban together I'm sure it won't be my last."
"Ah, but you see, the point is that you must. You have to agree to this."
With no words spoken Castiel shrugged out of his own pants and watched as Dean's eyes travelled unabashedly to the evidence of his own arousal , slightly smaller than his partners, but in no way lacking. He hovered his palm near Dean and slowly began to place feather light pressure along the shaft, not once taking his eyes off of Dean's face. When his finger reached the tip of his shaft he was surprised by the violent reaction he received from Dean when he projected himself upward into Cas's waiting arm, thus burying himself deeper into Cas's hand.
"Please," he whispered.
"But what happens when, you know, you find the big G-o-d…we won't see you anymore."
"Do you uh…do you feel that? They feel like…."
After what seemed like hours of gentle torture, Cas removed his warm, slick fingers from Dean and shifted so he could gaze into his glazed over green eyes. He searched his face with intense longing. Both could feel the others breath upon their face and with an intake of air Cas covered Dean's mouth as he moved his arms to encircle Dean and lift him against him, thus allowing him to run the length of his member down and across Dean's backside before experimenting with his tip at the entrance.
As Castiel's eyes adjusted to the darkness he could feel Dean's body shaking in silent laughter.
Dean opened his eyes and smiled, "Well yeah, I mean I got it for you…don't look that much into it or anything it was just there and…well ya know I just figured….yeah go ahead open it." Dean moved back to an upright position and sniffed while rubbing his nose, failing at appearing indifferent and no nonsense because his eyes belied his true anxiousness of Cas opening the present.
To be honest, Dean didn't blame Cas for ignoring him. Cas was many things – socially inept, comically serious, unbelievably naïve for one so powerful, but also very perceptive and sensitive to other's emotions, which would make him want to steer clear of the Winchesters for a while even if it meant forever.
Paper and rubber bands fell to the floor and what remained in Castiel's hand was none other than a necktie, but this wasn't just any tie…Dean Winchester had gotten an angelic soldier and leader of heaven a novelty necktie.
Bobby being the ever pragmatic one thought it was best to not go in gun's blazing and had suggested that the three of them stick to the old adage "keep your friends close and your enemies closer." This immediately set Dean off because it suggested Cas was no longer their friend, despite the fact he had called to question that very relationship to Cas' face. Dean had regretted his harsh tone after he had said that to Cas, especially after seeing his entire demeanor fall, which he hadn't thought could drop any further.
"Cas…I think there's one more use for neckties that I should really make you familiar with…."
"Oh don't worry I am," Cas looked as if Dean had just delivered him a fatal blow and he leaned back up and playfully shoved Cas' upper body to the side with his shoulder, "But it's not for the reason you think…I'm mad because you didn't talk to me about this, Cas let me finish; you, me, Sam…we're a team we rely on each other because we're all we have on this earth and it really hurt, Cas to think that you didn't share the same trust in me as I have in you…"
Dean stared into Castiel's bright blue eyes and saw his pain as he fought with himself to come up with his reply. That was, until his eyelids closed softly, shielding them from his penetrating gaze.
"Cas?"
Dean's stance relaxed a little bit and he chanced a glance at Cas. He slowly closed the gap between them and realized that despite his reservations he felt the bond between them whenever Cas was in the room. He felt peace when he met Cas's piercing blue eyes with his own green ones and realized he wasn't as disturbed by the idea of loving Cas as he thought he would be – it just felt right.
What time was it?
Castiel stared up at him in blatant shock. Dean loved him? He always knew that Dean cared about him as a friend and at times like a brother, but this declaration…this was not meant casually. What could he possibly say? That this entire time he's been making dangerous deals, allowing innocent people to be killed, and destroying the last semblance of family he had he'd been naïve as to the implications? Not only would that be a boldfaced lie, but it'd be a disservice to Dean who currently was taking his silence as confirmation that he was finished with them.
When Cas could no longer continue lest he finish before he even began with his sweet Dean he gently coaxed Dean from his body and pushed him back down against the bed. His hand which was gripping Dean firmly began to trace higher until he reached Dean's firm backside, eliciting a moan from Dean as he gripped the bed sheets. Cas bent over Dean and began to trace the pentagram on his chest with his tongue, occasionally leaving a love bite, as he slowly entered Dean with one finger.
"With all that you've accused me of doing to you. With all that you've said? Forced me to do? You're going to force me into this too? No Dean. I will not let you do this."
Speaking of which…
Castiel only smirked.
"Gabriel's horn of truth….yadda yadda yadda….forces dipshits to answer questions honestly…" He took a swig of the amber liquid in his glass and tried to decide how to go about finding this holy horn.
"If you're quite finished I'd like to thank you for your gift…"
Well…was….
Two hours and three tickets later – one for speeding, one for ripping up said speeding ticket, and one he assumed would be mailed to one "Mr. Dudley Hyman" as a warrant for his arrest for driving off while the cop was looking up the license he swiped from a demon's vessel he had killed – he had come back to the motel to find it empty with a note that read:
Gift forgotten, Castiel took Dean's face into his hands and leaned against his forehead, smelling the soap and leather coming off of Dean,
"I realized then and there I didn't want anyone else to harm you or hurt you…that I would fight Lucifer himself if it meant you would be safe and happy. That is what our bond is, Dean…it is my everlasting promise to you that no matter your past, present or future I will be there, risking Hell if need be," he placed his hand on his heart, "until the day you leave this world and enter mine."
Castiel just shook his head and smiled, "Of course." He began to slowly remove the rubber bands around the package and was loathe to rip any of the paper as he began to separate the paper from the tape and…well apparently Dean had cut himself on the paper because there were small droplets of blood he had tried to cover.
"No, Cas. Let's get something straight." Dean closed the distance between them and raised his hand to Cas, pointing an accusing finger at him, "It's not that you couldn't make us understand it's that you didn't try. You went behind everyone's back, Cas. You went behind *my* back and you were the only person…angel…*mythical being* who hadn't done that to me! And I'm really pissed off!" Dean's volume had been increasing with each word and became pointed and stinging at the end.
Castiel pushed himself from the cabinet and moved towards Dean silencing him with his quick movement.
Leave it to Dean to take all of the poetry and sentiment out of an angelic declaration of love.
"So…" Cas moved closer to Dean again and took hold of his hands, "What you're saying is…" he smirked at Dean and Dean saw the little crinkles on the side of Cas' eyes, "This necktie is how you see heaven?" Cas was teasing Dean, thinking it was a wonderfully funny insight into Dean's mind.
"Marry me, Cas," Dean said, something that savored strangely of hope lingering in his voice.
"Dean I'm very aware of what my declaration implies and I can assure you I meant it in the manner you're refusing to acknowledge."
Despite the speed limit being 55mph, Dean found it more to his benefit to drive 75mph all the while blasting Zeppelin and cussing up a storm in between smacking the steering wheel.
Dean pushed himself away from the bed; Bobby was of no help and he'd sooner make a deal with Crowley than trust Samuel. There was only one person Dean could think of that was of any real help…but he hadn't seen him in weeks despite the current clusterfuck in progress.
"How could this guy have lied to me? God he's so transparent" he thought and smiled as he shook his head in a similar manner to Cas, but he was still kind of worried Cas didn't like the tie.
Oh he was asking for it, luckily Dean had a few tricks up his sleeve…
The moment Dean felt the cool air hit his chest he moved up the bed away from Cas's distracting ministrations and Cas took his face in his hands so he could look him in the eye. "He's so beautiful…inside and out" Cas thought, "And he doesn't even realize it…" He glanced downward and noticed the angry mark on his left shoulder – the one imperfection on his body, yet Castiel couldn't entirely regret leaving his burning mark on Dean – a primeval testimony to their bond despite the torture it caused him to leave such a painful mark on his Dean.
"Is this war and making deals with backstabbing demons like Crowley really worth the results? Is it worth alienating everyone who cares about you, who lo…love you?"
"I have one more surprise…turn off the light."
Could Cas be anymore devoted? Even in the face of betrayal, war, and loss he managed to put it all aside in order to save face for a "gift" he clearly only appreciated because it was given to him by Dean. For that moment, Dean put aside everything else because he found he could not simultaneously feel anger towards Cas while he lovingly cradled a gift trying to show true appreciation.
"What happened to you Cas?" Castiel seemed confused by this question. "You used to be so…so human or at least like one, but now…"
Dean didn't move as he felt Cas' eyelashes fluttering along the side of his face, his soft dark hair against his brow. His hands were tracing lazy patterns on his neck and he couldn't help but let out a sigh of content as Cas finally deposited a feather light kiss to the outer shell of his ear, right below the lobe. He whispered,
Dean signed and moved himself from Cas, leaning back onto the bed with his hands and tilted his head toward his chest,
"The only thing stopping you is your stubbornness, that and these fucking pants" Dean said, one hand slipping tantalizingly slowly down to his backside, cupping his crotch from behind and causing a visible spasm.
Dean's knees had risen all the while Cas was assaulting his neck and he clamped them against Cas's body, effectively trapping him between his legs. His arms that were currently rubbing Cas's lower back moved to his chest and began to shrug off his trench coat. Cas was more than obliging to helping with the task and moved up slightly so he could remove it completely, giving him more room to move.
"Dean angels are without sex or gender – "
"Cas?"
Dean tightened his embrace around Cas's midsection and tried to persuade his body to relax and he knew what was about to happen.
Slowly, Dean turned around readying a smart ass retort to cover for his lapse, but was promptly silenced by Cas. Dean felt strong arms encase him in a tight embrace, one arm went under his to encircle his waist while the other wrapped around his shoulders to pull him into Cas's chest. The soft, cool fabric of the trench coat against his face, the slight 5 o'clock shadow on Cas's face against his forehead – all of this coupled with the repetitive firm hand rubbing circles against the small of Dean's back caused him to breathe; truly breathe for the first time in over a decade. The tears spilled, soaking Cas's trench coat and thoroughly embarrassing the usually dry humored and no nonsense hunter.
"Hey…it's not every woman….don't look at me like that….ok maybe it's a large quantity of women…I'm not a man whore…Damnit I have standards!" Castiel realized the longer he let Dean ramble the more ridiculous his statements would become.
"Dean…could you help me put it on?"
Castiel paused and gave him an exasperated look that was tinted with humor. "Dean why is it so easy for you to mount every woman within a 5 mile radius of you, but when it's someone you clearly have feelings for you resist?"
"Thank you for the tie, Dean…Now I have two reminders of the heaven I once knew on Earth."
Castiel gently persuaded Dean back onto the bed and admired the visible protrusion underneath his clothes. He placed a finger at his breastbone and traced a lazy line down to his navel where he circled the small dip before tracing the thin trail of hair that disappeared under his waistband. He continued his finger's trail and gingerly ran it along the length of Dean's shaft and was rewarded by his bucking upward.
Castiel immediately spun around on the bed to face him and took Dean's wrists in his hands, "Don't ever think that I don't trust you, Dean…you're the only one I do fully trust. Dean…I'm a soldier I'm not a leader like you are Dean, but I was made one and I was lost."
"Say yes."
When he felt himself surrounded by Dean he lost all breath from his body and buried his face into Dean's neck – taking comfort in the vibrations of his moaning and the musky scent of sweat and soap. As soon as Dean's legs moved to encase Castiel he began to move in and out, gently and smooth so as not to cause Dean any more discomfort, but if his noises were any indication that was slowly becoming less of a problem.
Hours later, Dean was still encased by Castiel's wings, but he rested atop his chest as Castiel threaded his fingers through Dean's soft, short hair…stopping occasionally to place a kiss atop his head.
Castiel blinked. He knew Dean was right…that he had used that excuse. But this was different…so much more. How could he put behind him everything they had shared? He was about to voice this very concern when Dean spoke up.
"Dean…" Castiel quietly intoned, calling Dean away from his reverie.
Dean quirked an eyebrow trying to see if he was just playing with him or not, but when Cas held out the tie in earnest and said "Please?"
The most incredible thing, though, was getting Sam back.
"Who told you that? Dean if and when God returns that will change nothing between you and I. I'm not losing you now that I finally have you."
"Say yes."
"I have always been on your side, Dean. Do you think it pleases me to know I cannot help you with your brother?"
Castiel places his long fingers atop Dean's strong calloused hand and halting his movements.
"M-marry you?"
But the Dean took no notice of his objection as he simply took hold of his hand. He stared at him, confused, as he made no attempt to move but to lightly hold his palm, his thumb running slowly over his fingers.
Castiel looked torn between an answer and Dean noticed Castiel's hand tighten on the cabinet edge as if he was trying to keep himself in check.
"Dean…"
Cas shifted slightly so he could look at Dean and took in his disheveled appearance. Feeling slightly more daring than usual he gave no verbal reply, he simply quirked an eyebrow at Dean as if challenging the validity of his statement. His left hand began the journey down his torso where he had been unearthing Dean's lower abdomen. His eyes never left Dean's, nor did his expression change when he slowly inched his fingers upward with the cloth of the shirt in toe – his short fingernails raking a burning trail up the scant hair of Dean's toned stomach stopping only when he reached his chest.
"God damnit, Cas…" Dean moaned out.
"Say yes, Cas, and I will give you everything I have to offer. Never leave a man behind – that's our motto. And you aren't a man Cas, but you are mine and I will not leave you behind."
Castiel rearranged himself so he could look upon Dean and he held his face between his hands, "You are my reason for living, Dean Winchester. I know you don't understand fully yet what I meant by our profound bond, but I will remind you – yes the day I rescued you from Hell was by God's command, but it wasn't until I glanced upon you myself and looked into your soul that I realized how truly divine you were. Despite the torture you endured, despite your resolve never to hurt another and the anguish you felt when you did your soul remained pure and unbroken. I felt the pain you experienced when you dealt that first blow against one of your own – Your strength, your humanity is what saved you from the hatred of Lucifer's demons…"
Castiel had never kissed another soul before. He never could have imagined what it felt like. His love for Dean always intensified whenever they were together, but he also felt emptiness because their bond was…unfulfilled. When he felt Dean move his body closer, seeking his comfort, his love, he could no longer fight against his waning willpower – he was an angel not a saint. With a low growl in the back of his throat he placed his hand against the front of Dean's throat and pushed into him, strengthening the kiss and brought Dean in closer.
"No. No- I don't. I won't," Castiel added, his voice infused with an emphatic insistence.
Castiel, however, knew that Dean was ashamed he allowed himself to be vulnerable in front of someone. He could hear Dean's heart beating rapidly and felt the knot that was forming in Dean's throat as he unsuccessfully tried to hold back the tears that were threatening to fall. Cas saw the images flash through Dean's mind of his father leaving Sam and him to fend for themselves while he hunted, of Sam telling them he wanted to be lawyer, he saw and felt the shattering of Dean's heart when Sam went to Hell and the realization upon his return that Lisa and Ben were impossible to keep.
Cas really wasn't gonna let him live this tie down was he?
Still holding onto the tie, Dean felt Cas's soft lips gently teasing his own. He never imagined what an angel would taste like and now he would never forget: it was addictive. Whenever he moved away slightly only to go in for another small gentle kiss he took with him purity – like the space where the ocean meets the air. Warmth spread down Dean's entire body and he pressed himself into Cas's body while his hand finally loosened on the tie and moved up to his arm to where the neck meets the shoulder.
"Cas?"
"Cas-"
Keeping his hand to the side of Dean's bulge Castiel ran light kisses up the front of his chest and paused on his tattoo – the pentagram with fire surrounding it shone against the light haze of sweat forming on his chest and he laid his head near it, tickling Dean's chest with his eyelashes.
Castiel's voice dropped an octave with this admission and Dean didn't dare meet his eyes, instead looking at his empty glass in his hand. Castiel immediately regretted his harsh tone and without looking away from Dean reached around and grabbed the bottle of brandy.
"Dean I know you better than you do; I watch every movement, I listen to every word, and Dean, you are such a strong and devoted leader that you sometimes refuse to accept any flaws in others. Yes, Dean I made a mistake, but we all have made mistakes."
The tie was glowing in the dark.
With a final tug Dean's pants were off and that effectively silenced his rambling. Castiel could only look upon Dean with mounting arousal and love. His shaft protruded from his body and Castiel could see the glistening tip was far more sure of this situation than its owner was. He chanced a glance at his remarkably silent partner and where there was once concerned reservation he could see clear anticipation, wondering where this was about to lead.
"Your answer, Cas? Will you let me bond onto you? Will you let me save you? Will you let me love you?" Dean sounded frantic, lustful, desperate…
"I thought that would have been obvious," Cas gave him one final Eskimo kiss as he looked back at him.
Castiel shook his head in amusement, "You really don't get it do you, Dean? You're my Heaven. I've loved you since the day I took hold of you and gave you life." At this memory Dean flinched and Castiel simply placed his palm over the scar covered by clothing. "And I will continue to be with you and love you until the end of time."
"I've broken every other rule, what's one more?"
"You say I am your friend, Dean. You say we are a team. Forgive me, Dean. I need you to forgive me because this war, this fight…it will be worthless to me if I lose you in it."
Dean laughed a hollow sound, "You say that now, Cas…but I'm sure there are more important –"
Castiel couldn't hold back the shiver that ran through him at that. His hands found their way to rest on his arms, neither pulling him closer nor pushing him away.
But he didn't move back or try to justify himself to him as he so often found himself doing. Dean just lowered his lips to his and pressed one chaste kiss against their soft surface. As he pulled back, he felt him unconsciously follow him as if he didn't want to be parted from his touch.
Dean broke the silence, "Cas…what does this bond mean now?"
"I know what you're thinking, Dean." He poured the liquid into Dean's cup knowing a drink would calm him down. "And Sam is not Lucifer." Dean started at this and looked up at Castiel with clear panic in his eyes – if that brimstone munching bastard so much as….
Dean could feel the stretching of his body as Cas began to wiggle his fingers before inserting a third and gasped out in pain.
"Come on, Cas! I know you can hear me! Get your feathery ass down here!"
Dean's brow furrowed for a second as he replied, "I am deadly serious, Cas."
He watched Cas just look at him completely straight faced watching him die of laughter with a look of "I'll speak when you have it aaaaalllll out of your system. Just let me know…."
He advanced on Dean and grabbed him tightly by his shoulders, giving him a quick shake before putting him against the wall, responding in a deep tone, "I was not aware I needed the permission of a *human* who has no earthly concept of my world."
Dean moved a little back and with a groggy voice asked, "Two?"
"It means you are mine and I am yours for time eternal…"
All that Castiel could feel were his hands on his and his body pressed against his so tightly that he could feel his growing arousal through both their clothes. That alone should have made him snap out his daze, but as it was, Castiel was so blinded by the effects Dean was having on him that it only made him want to lose himself even more in his embrace.
Castiel chose to ignore that remark and instead turned his attention to the item, he noticed Dean had stopped walking towards the door and wondered if it was because of the object in question, although he couldn't see what was so important about a small cube shaped item decorated with colored depictions of people and animals in unusual settings with words written above their head.
"Whoa whoa what are you doing?" Dean stopped trying to find the words when he realized Cas had begun to unzip his jeans.
"Dean, I-"
Castiel moved closer to Dean's turned stance and raised his hand as if to stroke Dean's shoulder, but hesitated mid air…fearful that he wouldn't be able to prove to Dean how very much he did mean to him.
"How Dean? How does it feel different?"
They sat in silence for what seemed like hours until Dean broke the silence.
"Nothing to offer? Here I was thinking you were on our side on my side – "
Dean felt Cas smile against him.
Cas began to kiss a trail up Dean's neck, breathing deeply as Dean shuddered against him as he kissed his eyelids, nose, and finally mouth before moving back so he could clearly see Dean. He spoke,
The last time Castiel woke, it was with the remnants of a word hanging on his lips. And he couldn't for the life of him remember what it was that he'd said. He could guess though. Castiel pulled his palms up to cover his eyes, pressing them down lightly as he tried to calm his breathing and the feelings in his that the dreams always ignited.
"And in answer to your earlier statement…I would let you double dip in my Applebees appetizer."
Dean got up and Castiel followed suit. Dean walked two steps and then turned back around. His eyes were tightly shut and Castiel could see the small lines that formed at the sides of his brow – he was clearly trying to make sense of everything and Castiel could sense he was afraid of opening up to this.
Dean walked over to the bed and sat down, putting his right arm around Cas' lower back while leaning over with his left arm to put his hand atop the gift and lower it from Cas' eyes so he could focus on him. Without removing either hand Dean spoke,
"Dean..."
Castiel halted his meticulous inspection of the comics and looked up not realizing Dean was as close as he was despite feeling his nearness. How could Dean stand to be this close to him? Hadn't they just spoken out in true anger at each other? Castiel was about to voice this observation when he felt Dean tugging at one of the rubber bands holding the package together.
Dean knew he didn't want to lose Cas either, he loved Cas and wished none of this had happened. Cas' remained on his face and he gave a tired sigh as he contemplated everything; he was just so exhausted, he didn't have answers and that didn't sit well with him. Instead of trying to find the words he slowly just moved his arms to the sides of Cas' hips and brushed circles with his thumb against the bone, his fingers splayed out on the curve of his lower back. They sat there like that for a few minutes just thinking every emotion they couldn't speak and hoped their actions would speak louder than words ever could or would. Castiel broke the silence.
"Yeah well…tell that to little Jimmy."
"So Cas…if you don't like it you don't have to keep it." Dean made a move to take the present away, but Castiel batted his hand away and moved over closer to the pillow.
Castiel let out a deep groan and Dean felt himself spill against Cas's body while he was filled with Cas.
Dean looked up suddenly having been entirely focused on the task at hand and smirked at the hand on his cheek,
"Oh I'm acknowledging it alright…I just don't know how I feel about."
Dean was silent, he was ashamed to admit Cas had a point, but his pride refused to admit it out loud, "But you're an angel, Cas! You're better than humans!"
"I can't marry you, Dean…I just can't for many reasons and I cannot have you thinking you need to save me" he piped up eventually. Maybe it was pride maybe it was guilt, but he just couldn't bear to see Dean giving up everything to dote upon him and tend to him as if he was some sickling kitten.
Dean leaned in further wanting more, but Cas pulled away. Oh so that was how he wanted to play?
"It's a date."
Castiel moved back a little so he could see Dean better and was immediately swept up by his tear stained green eyes. Without thinking he raised his other hand that wasn't atop Dean's fist and placed it on the opposite cheek and began to wipe away his tears with the pads of his thumbs.
"Dean you know it's more complicated than you're allowing yourself to believe. Yes in the past I have…that is…I've come across as human as you put it but we both know I am not human. So many things have changed for me because of you and your brother – "
To say Dean was hurt would have been a gross understatement. So this is how he wanted to be? Fine. He had already blown up on Bobby and Sam and he wouldn't have this happen again with Cas.
"Well, the first reminder is of course my…lovely…necktie."
The atmosphere of the room only worsened when Sam had suggested that Bobby wasn't completely unfounded in his thoughts,
"Are you shitting me? Like…are you for real?"
"Dean…" He said quietly, afraid to speak any louder, "Dean I don't understand why you're allowing me to receive a gift and hear your laughter after all we've been through."
Castiel had moved his head to look up at Dean, waiting for his response. When he saw how difficult it was for Dean to reply he knew it wasn't a reflection on him – but on the way Dean was raised, how he learned to see the world.
"One little word, Castiel," Dean whispered, bending his head slightly so that he could feel his breath on his neck.
"Vos es mei iam, iustus ut EGO sum vestri…" You are mine, just as I am yours, echoed in Dean's mind. Castiel was allowing Dean to see his soul.
Castiel watched as Dean straightened up on the floor and several emotions passed across his face, Castiel could sense them all – confusion, anger, incredulity, and….hope? It wasn't very strong nor was it at the forefront of his mind, but it was indeed there.
Castiel saw Dean's strong, thick arms reaching over his head and he slide his fingers underneath Dean's arm, causing a shuddering ripple in his body.
Dean's quick intake of air allowed Castiel to tentatively run the tip of his tongue along the seam of Dean's mouth, begging entrance. He slowly moved his hand up Dean's throat and brushed the underside of his jaw with his fingertips before he gently placed his fingers below their melding mouths – slowly pulling Dean's lower jaw down.
Of course that was before Sam had come topside again. Before his brother, his only family, had disappeared, replaced by a cold and calculated hunter.
"Look it's just…well ok on earth we have this image of ya know…a big golden gate and fluffy clouds and naked angel babies flying around in heaven…"
"Oh my God…are you kidding me?" Dean couldn't believe it. Cas thought the Sunday comic's he used as wrapping paper was the gift!
"You have every right to be angry with me."
"Look down, Cas…" Had his voice always been that husky?
"Dad always said I had bad habits…Maybe you're just one of the bad habits I can't seem to kick despite my best efforts."
Dean looked up at this, "Abandonment? You think I'm afraid of abandonment! I don't expect it I accept it! Hell I'm damn near used to it! While kids were making mother's day cards I was wondering how many more days good ol' dad would be gone! And as far as Sam goes….as far as…." Dean couldn't finish his rambling because Castiel had placed his hand on Dean's warm, wet cheek and leaned his forehead against Dean's.
"Hear that Cas?" Dean yelled out to the empty air not expecting an answer as usual.
What on earth was this item? It seemed very mundane to be considered a gift, but he had already hurt Dean enough and he wasn't about to reject a gesture of kindness however inappropriate the sentiment was currently in Dean's eyes.
Frustrated Dean threw his notes aside and crossed the side of the room.
"Vos mos non cado me per vestri pars…You will not fall with me by your side."
Dean could feel Castiel's stubble against his own and realized he was letting him decide their fate.
The necktie was tied and as Dean went to tighten the knot around his neck he pulled Cas in closer, his hands slowly moved up the column of the tie and as he brought the knot up to his neck he pulled Cas in closer until their noses were touching.
"Y-Y-Yes….w-why wouldn't I…" Dean couldn't contain himself. He busted out laughing – he hadn't expected the stars to be *that* bright and Cas' expression was priceless.
"Cas…I can't be without you. I need you to let me take care of you. You are more than a brother to me and damnit Cas I will not lose you – We have a bond Cas and I want to make you bonded to me in the only way I know how. Let me save you Cas like you saved me."
Castiel matched Dean's volume; his warm breath alerting Dean to his nearness despite the harsh tone and he mentally berated himself for the effect it was having on him, "Would you have understood, Dean? I honestly don't think you would have if I had said to you I want a "dead" (Castiel used exaggerated air quotes for this) demon to help me win my war!"
Dean leaned against the bed frame and ran his fingers through his short hair. He'd never forget the moment Sam let him become a God damned vamp as long as he lived.
"But let me ask you something, Cas…"
Dean could feel Cas behind him. He always knew when Cas was there. Only Cas had that smell; that clean, cold smell that Dean could remember smelling as a child when Spring officially came, promising rebirth and happiness.
Castiel moved his arms to lift Dean up front behind his shoulder blades and slowly moved into him, feeling his body tense up and his grip on him become tighter. Castiel murmured words of love and encouragement in his ear and moved his wings so they could enfold Dean completely, wrapping around his back and cradling him tight against him.
Dean was kind of embarrassed, "Well…I saw it and…."
"Yeah…Yeah I'll knock it off. Call me when you find something." Dean had said offhandedly in a brisk tone before grabbing his keys and slamming the door behind him.
"Dean I…I didn't tell you this expecting you to agree or even to understand. I just wanted you to know that you are not alone and unwanted. I'd move heaven and earth if it meant your happiness." He advanced towards Dean and was relieved that he didn't retreat. "Just let me love you, Dean and I promise you'll never have to regret it."
The moment he had Dean on the bed, Castiel ran his hands down Dean's side and began to untuck his gray undershirt. Just as he was about to slide his fingers underneath the material he felt Dean's hands stopping his and he looked up to see the hesitation in his eyes.
"I'm sorry I wasn't aware that in addition to the plethora of knowledge you already had you also wrote the rule book for angels," Dean glared at him at the mocking tone, but remained quiet.
"….Yes, Dean?"
Dean's lips brushed over his skin, teasing his with the thought of what his body was telling him that he wanted it.
"You know, Cas…you really need to learn how to do this, especially if you start dressing up as an agent with Sam and I…"
"Hm?" he absentmindedly replied as he continued to wipe away at Dean's face.
"Do you want me to stop, Dean?" Castiel looked sincere, but something in his eyes told Dean he was only asking to be polite.
"You know, for a human with all of the insight into the supernatural world as you do you're pretty clueless when it comes to me. Do you remember when I told Sam that you and I had a profound bond, which is why I answered your call before all others." Dean nodded halfheartedly, but Castiel was not deterred. "Dean that bond…our bond…trust in that. Trust that I will never leave you. No matter who abandons you or who makes you feel you aren't worthy of love know that I will always be there to protect you and I will always…" Castiel drifted off because he realized he may be revealing too much and was startled that he even allowed himself to admit what he did; even more startling, though, was the depth to which he meant what he said.
"Are you kidding me? I've been on red alert about Sam and you come here because of some stupid horn?"
"C-Calling your name?" Castiel asked, his mouth almost hanging open.
Dean felt an aching shudder fill his body when he felt Cas's tongue caress his bottom lip. The moment his tongue touched his, however, he let out a low moan in the back of his throat and pushed himself further against Cas's body, feeling every inch of him – tight and strong against his own muscular and tension filled body.
Castiel materialized in the room just as Dean called out to him. He looked unusually worn and slightly vexed but managed to appear imposing nonetheless, staring at Dean as if he had been waiting for a reason to answer his call.
"No! I love it! Really…I just…well what inspired you to get me such a tie?"
"That's not the one I meant," he whispered back to him.
"Dean I know what I'm about to say contradicts everything that my actions have caused, but I never meant to hurt you, Sam, and Bobby…especially you. I couldn't make you understand - "
"Castiel," Dean tried.
"Dean? Dean I need you to listen to me." Castiel said all the while rubbing Dean up and down his back. Dean had meanwhile curled his fists into the lapels of Castiel's coat and Castiel lowered one of his arms to cover his hand with his own.
"Dean I'm not going to pretend I don't know what you're talking about. What I need to know, however, is how you feel about everything I just said."
"Dean I can assure you there are no nude children frolicking in- "
"So when you say you…love…me I'm assuming you don't mean it in a "let's go to Applebees and it's cool if you want to double dip in the appetizer" way."
"Dean you asked me to be here and I came…I – "
Castiel knew Dean's noises would be his undoing and began to pull Dean towards the shabby bed, not once breaking his hold. The moment Castiel felt the back of Dean's legs hit the edge of the bed he shifted his weight causing Dean to lose his balance and topple onto the bed.
Dean smiled a genuine smile at Cas, bringing his hand to his face, to which Cas leaned into and place a kiss upon his palm.
"Actually, I believe moaning might be a more appropriate word for it."
Silence was Dean's response.
"You want this." With the grace of an angel his legs slid down the length of his as he pressed his body to his. "You want this." He pressed his hips to his, lowering his face to his neck, he pressed his lips to the tender area of his throat just below his ear. "And this."
"No, Dean."
The background of the tie was black, not too bad, and was very soft to the touch, but it was peppered with obnoxiously bright yellow stars of all different sizes. Castiel inspected it *very* carefully, not sure of how to react to the gift. What on earth had possessed Dean to get him this? He realized his silence and baffled look may be misinterpreted by Dean and he didn't want him to feel bad so he turned to Dean and gave him the widest eyed look he ever had and said with strong emphasis, "You really shouldn't have!" He had heard that line in a movie the boys had left on in the background a few months ago and hoped it was appropriate to the situation at hand.
"Well ya know…your tie is kind of frayed and well…I just think you need to change it up a bit! Not anything dramatic like getting a new coat, but maybe change your tie every decade or so to throw people off!"
Cas bent his head down until their noses touched, "I regret many things, Dean…but I'll never regret you." He delivered a hot kiss to Dean's mouth before moving to the scar. He ran a finger around the outline of the scar and Dean took Cas's other hand and placed an open kiss to his palm as Cas mimicked the movement by gently kissing the palm of the scar. They mimicked each other across each hand, as Cas would kiss a finger so would Dean. Cas pushed his hand into Dean's lips and ran his tongue across the middle finger of the scar as he felt Dean's hot breath over his hand. Dean kissed the tip of Cas's middle finger before running his teeth over the length as he sucked the tip into his mouth and back out.
Castiel could never remember a time before meeting Dean that he ever felt a particular need to help a human or share in their pain or delight. He thought humans to be curious creatures and was ever fascinated by his Father's creation. It wasn't until he gripped Dean tight and raised him from Perdition that he ever allowed himself to feel anything. The moment he laid eyes on Dean he felt a profound bond form between the two of them and he knew that by his actions he had changed both their paths irrevocably.
"Why, Cas?" No yelling, no sarcastic remarks, just a softly spoken question; more dangerous than a loaded gun.
With a growl, Cas launched himself from his attention with the scar and moved to straddle Dean's midsection as he used his free hand to slowly unknot his soft blue tie and discard it to the ever growing pile. Dean looked upward from his downturned head, continuing his assault on Cas's hand while burning blue eyes watched him as he slowly unbuttoned his shirt, the dark sparse hair slowly appearing with the removal of each button.
"Of course, Dean," Castiel looked on innocently, "Why would you think otherwise?" He gave a crooked smile as if tempting Dean to contradict.
"Just stood there…Just fucking stood there while that fucking vamp changed me."
"I'm getting a little tired of letting dream me have all the fun, you know."
"I fucking know what Bobby is saying, Sam and I damn well know what you're saying! It is crystal fucking clear to me what Cas did and I can assure you I am NOT brushing it off or in denial! And as far as Cas' betrayal goes you of all people should know not to throw rocks in glass houses, ok? You aren't exactly a pillar of trust."
"And the second?"
"Well we're not. What I'm trying to say is it's because you're you…that with any other person….man….I'd never even consider, but with you – it's different because I know that we're…well you….I…"
"But that doesn't explain why I can…feel them."
It wasn't until the entrance of a second finger that Dean began to feel slight discomfort. Sensing this, Castiel concentrated on his healing powers to allow Dean's body to become more accepting and Dean suddenly felt a cool, slickness that accompanied Cas's gentle prodding. Castiel felt Dean's body meld against his fingers and moved to plant a gentle kiss upon Dean's lips, chin, and nose before returning to his mouth – opening the seam of his lips so he could mimic the movement of his fingers with his tongue.
"Why?" he asked.
Castiel slowly lowered himself and Dean onto the floor against the bed frame so he could hold Dean tighter, all the while trying not to cry himself.
Dean just started in utter confusion at Cas…what in fucking hell was Cas talking about? He watched Cas carefully inspect the gift he had bought for him, feeling the outer texture and slowly turning it in his hand to read the….wait….
When it became clear that Dean was nowhere near ending his tirade of laughter Castiel shifted and pulled Dean in closer to him as he was still kneeling on the floor. Dean had only one second to react and he felt Cas' legs tighten around his sides as he leaned in, the feel of his cheek against his own as he whispered into his ear, his warm breath tickling the outside.
"Well for one I'm a dude and you're a dude – "
"I can't."
Bobby is off researching and I'm casing the
"I don't know, Dean…why do you continue to call for someone who you lost all trust in? Why do you continue to let me into your life even though I only seem to be hurting you?"
"Say yes and I'll do whatever you want that it's in my power to do," he whispered. "Just let me help you and I'll be everything you've wanted me to be. No more lies and no more regrets – I never thought I'd find a place to call home, but my home is with you."
"No," he replied, the sound came out as no more than sigh.
Castiel chanced a few steps closer to Dean, poised to say something but struggling with the words.
Dean relented and stood up, motioning for Cas to stay where he was on the bed and knelt between his knees.
Castiel looked down and couldn't believe it…
"You know what? I don't give a damn anymore. You wanna saddle up with demons and make deals that go against everything you used to fight against fine. Go. Go do whatever the hell you want I don't care."
Dean glared in a half serious manner, "Yeah well you should have taken me out to dinner first…"
It was the stare that infuriated Dean to the breaking point.
"Come on, Cas! I know you can hear me! Get your feathery ass down here!"
This time it was Dean who silenced Castiel. He moved his hand up Castiel's chest and rested it against his heart. Castiel looked at his hand and smiled, "Our hearts beat together. When your heart is excited I can feel it." Dean turned slightly pink because he knew his heart was rapidly beating. Castiel returned the smile, "And when your heart feels as if it's going to break no matter where you are or where I am I see your pain and I send you my love and reassurance that it will get better."
"Please don't do this, Dean. I can't let you think that you can or need to save me."
"Dean turn around…"
"What do you mean by that?"
There. He had finally said it. His furrowed brow and tense face were trying to remain disconnected and angry; the only real sign of emotion that belied his true thoughts was in the quiver of his supple lips as he finally came to terms with the possibility that Cas may already be lost to him, a gesture that did not go unnoticed by Castiel.
Dean ran his finger down Castiel's tie, its soft smooth texture feeling foreign against his calloused and strong fingers. Encouraged by the look in Castiel's eyes, Dean wrapped his fingers around the tie and slowly tugged Castiel in closer until they were nose to nose, even then he did not let go.
"Marry me, Cas."
Castiel knew that wasn't directed at his answering him no matter what. Why….why indeed? Castiel couldn't answer that question no matter how many times he asked it or who he posed it to. Why…Why had the Winchesters been chosen to fight evil? Why had he been chosen to raise Dean from Perdition? Why did God leave? Why? Why? Why?
"Changed? Things have changed for you? Damnit Cas! I've lost the closest thing I've ever had to a family and lost my brother twice! And you act as if you could care less!"
"Cas if you don't like it you don't have to wear it…" Dean was surprised at the slight twinge of hurt he felt at the thought of Cas rejecting his gift and made a move to take it away, but Cas grabbed onto the other end and tugged it sharply out of his grasp.
Dean grabbed his laptop again where he had pulled up a page on Gabriel's Horn of Truth.
Cas couldn't contain himself any longer once he saw the desire burning in Dean's eyes as he threw the coat off the bed onto the floor. The moment his arms were release he slid Dean's shirt further and soon it joined the discarded coat on the floor.
