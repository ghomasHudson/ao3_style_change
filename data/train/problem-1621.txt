John stifled a laugh. “Well, whatever you want to call it, you seem to be doing fine.”
“We don’t have to, though, if it’s too fast, I’m just–”
“Nice to meet you, Chi,” John said. “Where are your parents?”
“Sherlock?” John knocked on the door tentatively, but there was no response. He pushed it inward cautiously, stopping on the threshold.
“Good going, by the way,” John said under his breath to Mrs. Hudson as Lestrade and Molly went into the hall to get their coats.
“Thank you.” John reached down to cup Sherlock’s face with one hand. “What’s wrong? Did you want me to do something differently–”
he’d just told him his bloody name.
He had also never been superstitious. When he broke a mirror, he simply swept it up. When he spilled salt, he didn’t toss any over his shoulder.
John turned around. “Don’t you think of her as yours at this point?”
Lestrade cleared his throat, breaking the tension like snapping a thread.
"So…" Sherlock swallowed. He glanced over at the group of people across the street, of which one member (a man in his early twenties) was watching them with keen interest. "Now what?”
“John, did you ever notice that she had a skin condition?” Sherlock asked nonchalantly.
“You’ve always been the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen,” he said, a small thrill running through him at being able to say it out loud.
Satisfied, Sherlock went over to his violin and played one of John’s favorites.
“Sherlock, listen to me. Are you listening?”
“Right.” John saw a beer vendor walking down the aisle, so he signaled him down. “Two beers please.”
“That’s not possible,” John said earnestly. “I’m pretty sure you wouldn’t even have to touch me and I’d come at this point.”
But before he could say more, John sunk his mouth down on Sherlock’s cock, engulfing him in wet heat. Sherlock threw his head back, fisting his hands in the sheets. John bobbed slowly up and down on Sherlock’s length as his lubed fingers traced down to his hole, circling around it.
The man pressed on, those strangely intense eyes scrutinizing John intently. “However, you’ve always had a secret desire to be a doctor, and you even passed all the required A levels to do so. Your parents had wanted your older brother to be a barrister, but then he became an alcoholic and dropped out of uni. You took up the burden of your family’s expectations to relieve your brother of it.”
He walked over and sat on the arm of the chair, and reached out to sink his fingers into the curls at the back Sherlock’s head, massaging his scalp.
“Ohhhh. No, no, no. Stupid.” Sherlock shook his head as if disappointed with himself. “He didn’t die, did he? He just killed someone
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock called out as he closed the front door. “Tea, please.”
“It was the last one she made,” Mr. Hatayama said, his face inscrutable.
“Yes,” Sherlock snapped, exasperated. “Now, let’s go to the bedroom.”
“Morning.”
Sherlock turned, his brow still knit, and John stood up a bit straighter, trying to school his expression into something neutral.
Sherlock wasn’t struggling, or fighting back. He was letting John hit him, without protest... as if he thought he deserved it.
, he thought, then went back into the living room and started packing his things.
When he finally got to his first hundred, he strung them through a piece of clothes line and attached it to the ceiling in his new flat. He lay down on his bed with the window open, and watched the colored cranes dance lightly in the summer breeze.
Mrs. Hudson cocked her head, glancing over at Sherlock. He was fiddling with his violin, looking out the window.
The shorter man from the alley was standing at the front of the class. He was garbed in a light grey suit with a red pocket square, and his dark eyes were focused on John. He was smiling, but something about that smile made John cringe.
I am hoping that it isn’t a grievous error that the Thames could be cold enough during a cold snap in the winter to give someone hypothermia. I tried to do some research on this but it was a bit unclear, so if it isn’t, just chalk it up to artistic license.
John could feel Sherlock’s cock getting hard under his fingertips. He continued to stroke it slowly as Sherlock made little sighs and moans into his mouth, and John’s own cock started to get hard in response. He kissed lightly down Sherlock’s neck, nipping at his pulse point, continuing to slide his hand up and down Sherlock’s length at a languid pace.
Sherlock blinked at him again. “Not
Moriarty snapped his briefcase shut. “Tell your friend I know what he’s doing. Also, if he wants to keep his pet, he’ll stop baiting the sharks.”
John chuckled. “I didn’t even make reservations for anything. How about Angelo’s later?”
"I..." Sherlock trailed off.
“I wouldn’t know how to ‘play dumb’ if I tried, John.”
“It’s not a
“I did,” John said, his voice hoarse and a bitter aftertaste on his tongue. He badly wanted to order another drink, but he had a feeling that the bartender wouldn’t sell him any more. He still had half a bottle of scotch at home, but he could stop at the Tesco on the way home and by some more malt.
The carousel night light on the dresser twirled, its light danced over the walls, horses chasing butterflies that were somehow the same size.
It wasn’t until two days later that they tried again, mostly because they were called in to solve a murder of a priest who was involved in an underground prostitution ring, and they were up for a full day and a half. When they finally got home, they had both showered and collapsed into bed–Sherlock’s bed, by some unspoken agreement, which was fine with Sherlock.
He repeated this for a few minutes until John felt like he was going to pass out, and already felt embarrassingly close to coming.
“We did have a lot of wine.”
Sherlock nodded once, his eyes already closed. John went to the bathroom, turning on the shower to hot. It felt so good to stand under the spray, and even though his body thought it was about 8 am, he felt himself being lulled back into a sleepy state. He didn’t realize until he’d emerged that he didn’t actually have his sleeping clothes yet, since the bellboy had to bring up their suitcases.
“I—yes.” Sherlock’s eyes fluttered open, and he was swaying a little on his feet. John grinned, taking his hand and leading him toward the sofa. He sat down, pulling Sherlock down next to him, close enough that their knees were touching. He looked slightly nervous, despite the fact that John had just been snogging him senseless.
“Oy, freak. You’re not allowed on crime scenes.”
“Ah,” Sherlock breathed, rocking against him.
“Stop kissing me like you’re saying goodbye,” John whispered. “This is the beginning, not the end.”
“John,” Sherlock gasped.
The flight attendant returned with his drink, touching his arm and asking him a few questions, but she soon left again once it became clear that John was not going to flirt back.
Stuffing his hands in his pockets, Sherlock jerked his head in what John assumed was the direction of his flat and started to stride away, his long coat billowing behind him dramatically.
"Yes," Sherlock whispered, his eyes a torrent of grey, green and blue. “That doesn’t mean I won’t be bad at this. That I won’t make you want to leave.”
“John,” Harry groaned. “There has to be something else that would keep you going.”
“Leave it, it’s fine.” Carefully avoiding meeting those mesmerizing eyes, John grabbed his wet jumper and turned towards the door.
“Why don’t you sit down, Doctor Watson,” she said, picking up a new piece of paper and folding it over delicately to make a triangle.
John didn’t back down or step back, instead poking his finger into the man’s chest. “If you don’t leave,
“Your arse is marvelous. You have no idea how long I’ve been waiting to do this,” John said. He spread Sherlock’s arse cheeks wide and licked all the way up his perineum and over his hole. Sherlock cried out, his head hanging down and his hips chanting backwards.
“You’re tired, and the bed upstairs has linens on it. Stay here.”
“Alexia.” John crouched by the body, feeling sick.
John stopped short, his hand on the handle of the hall door. “What?” John turned around slowly.
Sherlock felt his eyes pricking, and John leaned down to kiss him again, deeply.
“Really?” he managed to ask.
“Sherlock—” Lestrade called after them.
Sherlock frowned. “Was that… not good?”
“I know, I know, it’s just, Moriarty, he knew I’m involved. You don’t think he—it was because of me that he targeted her, do you?”
Sherlock grimaced. “Before you, there were only two others. Both times, when they were done, it was over. And they didn’t care about… you know.” He made a gesture with his hand.
“Ba!” Rosie said.
“That should help,” he said, replacing the water.
John felt like something was lodged in his throat. “You were going to go back there. Back to Serbia. Before Moriarty showed up. Would this have happened again?”
“Actually, yes, I can swim. I’ve met my share of sharks, and I’ve not necessarily come out on the bottom in those fights,” he said bitingly.
They ran down the aisle to Larry, who was selling hot dogs to a young couple.
“You like this flat.”
“Dammit,” John muttered. “
John's jaw clenched as he tried not to imagine the amount of pain that would have had to be inflicted to cause those deep gashes. Feeling the raised skin under his fingertips was as painful as if his own flesh had been flayed.
After a while, John felt Sherlock’s forehead again. His fever seemed to be going down, which was a good sign. The rest of the symptoms would just have to run their course. At least he’d be here, in case Sherlock got worse.
"I'm not very good at this," Sherlock sighed.
John opened and closed his mouth, his hands balling at his sides. “Who the hell are you? Are you some kind of… stalker?”
“John,” Sherlock breathed.
After a while, John paused, kissing lightly along Sherlock’s jaw. Sherlock’s eyes were closed, his cheeks flushed beautifully. “I know the whole point was to snog under the mistletoe, which I would love to keep doing forever,” John said between kisses. “But do you think we could slow down for a bit and talk about this?”
“Case?” John spotted a taxi, and sighing with relief he flagged it down.
kidding me,” John muttered.
John looked at Sherlock again, and as if he could sense his gaze, Sherlock looked up at John. As their gaze met, his lips slid upward into a grin.
“I’m sorry,” he said, the words coming out rusty, unused.
John just hummed, sucking harder, cupping his hips upward at the same time so that his clothed cock rubbed directly against Sherlock’s. Sherlock’s cock was already unbelievably hard, and feeling John’s arousal against his own, even through several layers of clothing, was overwhelming.
“Shit!” John cursed, dropping his phone. He grabbed the now-scalding material and quickly pulled it away from his chest. “Oi, watch where you’re going!”
“I’m…” Sherlock began, then cleared his throat. John blinked his eyes open, looking down at him.  “Sorry,” Sherlock finished, over-enunciating the word, as if he’d never said it before. He bit his lip, still not looking at John.
“I do,” Sherlock said quickly. “With you. I
The voices got louder as the men approached, and soon they were on the deck of the pool, echoing off the walls.
Sherlock shrugged. “It’s in your nature.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock didn’t look up as he moved another piece of paper to a pile.
Sherlock kissed his cock through pants, and John felt like he was going to faint.
He wasn’t sure how long he had lain there when the door opened slowly, creaking on its hinges.
with you
Sherlock froze. “Our...daughter.”
John walked until it was dark, and eventually found himself at St. Bart’s. He stood in the spot where he’d stood when Sherlock had jumped, when he’d last heard Sherlock’s voice in real life.
With a surge of energy, John sat up, swinging his legs off the bed. He pulled Sherlock up to standing, taking him by the hand and tugging him down the stairs with purpose, almost tripping over his own feet in his haste.
Sherlock grasped at his arm. “Please,” he said, his eyes still closed.
He slipped into bed, feeling the ache in his bones from the long night of travel they’d just endured. “Turn out the light when you’re done thinking,” John said, turning over and putting a pillow over his head.
he wanted to ask. He wished he could see Sherlock’s face, to discern whether it was a joke or…a flirtation.
John furrowed his brow.
“Getting more wine, dear. Get me some, too, will you?” Mrs. Hudson said, smiling broadly.
John felt giddy, pulling Sherlock flush against him and kissing him again. He sucked on Sherlock’s lower lip, just a little, and Sherlock opened his mouth wider in a gasp. John fisted his hand in Sherlock’s curls, snogging him deeply, pouring everything he felt into the kiss.
“Even more than…” Sherlock began, but he stopped himself, clicking his mouth shut.
Steeling himself once more, John opened the door and walked back down the hall. Sherlock was in the kitchen, pouring the boiling water into a French press.
Chi’s face cracked into a little grin. “I do have an internet connection on my phone, you know,” she said.
“I know, I tried to act normal, but he obviously knew. And now he knows my name, Sherlock—”
“And then there’s your brother. You don’t have a passion for law, obviously.” John looked daggers at him, but the man pressed on as if oblivious. “It’s the middle of your first year and you are already suffering, but not just from studying. You clearly want to be doing something else. Your bookbag has all the telltale signs of someone who studied for medical A levels—hydrochloric acid stain on the strap, most likely from advanced chemistry coursework. You also have a patch from Emergency Medical Services at St. Bart’s on the side, the kind they give to volunteers. The only reason why you would choose law over medicine, as they are both noble and profitable professions, is most likely due to familial pressure. Put two and two together with your obstreperous sibling’s drinking, and there you have it.”
John ordered them both breakfast–including some food for Sherlock, hoping he could make him eat something–and walked into the bathroom.
When he finally drifted off, he dreamed of bees buzzing in the honeyed afternoon light of a summer afternoon and of dark curls twined through his fingers.
John stopped abruptly, panting against Sherlock’s mouth, looking up at his luminous eyes, and it hit him: this was really happening. After so long, after so many years of longing, of grief, separation...loss. He finally had Sherlock in his arms, the taste of him on his lips, and he never wanted to let go.
“Since you’re not going to bother asking me if I want to go, can you tell me where we are going, at least?”
“Or you’ll destroy yourself.”
John felt his cheeks heat up even more at the general chuckling in the room.
John sat down on a bench near the ambulance bay. Despite the fact that he must look quite insane, sitting in a hospital parking lot in the dead of night, slowly, methodically, he folded it.
Sherlock, who had been putting his coat on its hanger, froze. “
“You’re bored,” Sherlock said.
“Kiss me,” Sherlock managed to choke out. “
“You have to get to your lecture—”
had–since they’d last lived together. Sometimes it felt as though they were tiptoeing around each other, and the ease with which they had once each seamlessly integrated into the other’s life was lost. But at least now they were together again, in their flat. He had to hope that they would get back to the way they were eventually, even though it would never truly be the same as before Sherlock had fallen.
“Would you like something to drink?” A pretty blonde flight attendant asked John as he was sitting down. “Champagne? Cocktail?”
“Wilson, I presume,” John said, holding out his hand.
Unable to form words, Sherlock just nodded. John smiled, but it wasn’t his normal smile; it was a predatory one, which made Sherlock feel hot all over. John tugged him toward Sherlock’s room one-handed, and Sherlock shuffled after him, feeling extremely uncoordinated.
Sherlock’s eyes flashed with surprise, and something that almost looked like vulnerability. “No, because I
John startled, pulling back, the bliss that had been flowing through him coming to a screeching halt.
Once they got to their row, John took out his laptop before stowing his carry-on in the bin above him. Sherlock was already settling into his seat, pulling his coat over him.
“Hmmm.”
Sherlock held up her hand again. “See how torn her fingernails are? She was clawing at the wall when she was asphyxiating, trying to get out. If you take samples from under her fingernails, we might be able to match it with building materials to find out where she died.”
John raised the other eyebrow.
“More wine, anyone?” she asked, stopping briefly at the dividing line between the kitchen and the living room.
Sherlock’s long legs must have served him well, however, for he made it to the other building with room to spare.
“I can’t believe neither of them even
“He obviously has a lot more connections than we thought. This changes the range of motives dramatically, but we will have to come back to investigate,” Sherlock interrupted. “This new murder, though, it's connected, I can feel it. Come on.” Sherlock turned John around and pushed him toward the street.
“Ahhhh, fuck,” John groaned, arching into it.
Sherlock wrapped his limbs around John, kissing him back. It wasn’t long before he was arching up into John’s hand, his fingernails digging into John’s skin.
(See the end of the chapter for
There was something to be said for taking chances.
When John still didn’t leave, Sherlock opened his eyes again. “I’m fine, John. Just go.” He turned over so that his back was to John and lay still.
“I don’t want you to regret this,” Sherlock said softly. “I don’t--”
Unable to look at Sherlock for one more second without making some kind of embarrassing declaration, John closed his eyes again.
“Sherlock, it’s just a dream,” John said soothingly.
“Sherlock, that water is freezing!”
“Mmm,” Sherlock hummed, closing his eye again. “Headache.”
“Hmm.” Sherlock hummed in lieu of a reply, not looking up from the page.
“No,” Sherlock said quickly. John cocked his head, watching him, and he noticed there was a tiny bit of fluff on Sherlock’s collar.
“John, I...” Sherlock trailed off, his voice sounding strained.
John closed his eyes, stepping back reluctantly. “Happy Christmas!” he replied. He saw Sherlock take another large gulp of wine out of the corner of his eye.
“John,” Sherlock moaned, realizing that he was almost collapsing onto John at this point, hardly holding himself up. Not for the first time, he thought that despite his small frame, John was remarkably strong.
“I couldn’t
John felt himself flush deeply. He released Sherlock’s face and straightened up, clearing his throat. “Good, you’re awake. That’s, um…” he cleared his throat again. “Good."
John looked up to see that Mr. Hatayama was holding a crane. It was perfectly folded and crisp, a light summer yellow color.
John sat down on his bed, his head in his hands and his stomach in knots. He hadn’t realised until that exact moment that he had actually been hoping that this would work, that it would bring Sherlock back.
John took the long way home from the shops, walking through Regent’s park in the dusk. It was late September, one of his favorite times of year. Even though the weather in London wasn’t that variable from season to season, the air had a feeling of change to it, and he felt alive and energized.
He stood up straight and went to heat up some chicken broth, wondering if he had some spare sheets in the linen closet.
John could almost feel the heat of Sherlock’s breath against his cheek. “No. I mean, yes,” he said hoarsely. His throat felt dry.
He’d often come home to find Rosie sitting in her chair as Sherlock did an experiment, explaining his steps to her as if she were an adult with seven PhDs. Rosie would usually have fist in her mouth, eyes wide, hanging on his every word.
“Care to elaborate?” Sherlock asked, squatting next to him.
Mr. Hatayama sat down next to him just as the bartender was pouring the fourth glass, looking at John with a slightly wary look.
"John," Sherlock said. "John, please. I want…”
“Night, dears,” Mrs. Hudson said, closing the door behind herself. John glanced at Sherlock, but he didn’t move or look up.
Seeing Sherlock on the screen, smaller yet larger than life, talking, was almost more than he could bear. But he also couldn’t get enough. Sherlock was dead, but not dead; he was alive on the screen and in memory, but he was only a phantom. John drank more, watching Sherlock awkwardly speak to Greg off-screen.
“I still don’t see why you didn’t rig the election against him, surely you could have done that,” Sherlock remarked.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, his tone clipped. He didn’t offer any further information, reopening his computer and starting to type furiously.
John touched his elbow lightly, trying to reassure him. “So they killed her and then—what, they dumped her body here, trying to make it look like a drowning? But why?”
“Your present is… that I’ll do
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said. “John, I-- Please--”
“Oh.” John stopped stroking him, his eyes darkening impossibly further.
“Indeed,” Sherlock said quietly, his eyes still trained on John.
“No,” John said, shaking his head as he leaned back. He took the stethoscope out of his ears and slung it around his neck again. “I’m just filling in. How’s your pain? Do you need more morphine?”
“Good morning,” he said.
“Call me John,” John said, not looking up from his glass.
Yet here he was, in the flat of one of the most gorgeous men he’d ever
Once everyone was gone, John piled most of the dishes into the kitchen for the morning. Mrs. Hudson’s Ella Fitzgerald records were playing, and she was partaking of her “herbal soothers,” judging by the smell wafting upward.
Sherlock cracked an eye open, but didn’t move further.
Once they were in the room, John turned to face him again. He slipped his hand around Sherlock’s neck, pulling his head down to kiss him once, slowly, before standing back a little. Sherlock watched, his heart beating out of his chest, as John trailed his fingers down Sherlock’s stomach to the tie of his robe. John tugged one end of the tie, pushing the robe off Sherlock’s shoulders, so that Sherlock was standing in only his pants.
about my father,” he growled.
Now, though. After waiting so long, after wanting Sherlock so much, he couldn’t contain it anymore, hide it anymore, not even a little bit. So his impulse was to push Sherlock away, not to deal with it, not to acknowledge the way he felt.
John stopped abruptly, leaning back. Sherlock’s eyes were wide, his breaths coming sharp and quick.
Mycroft shook his head disapprovingly, as if John were a toddler in a tantrum. “I had no choice but to send him to Siberia. He would have driven himself mad in prison, you know that.”
“How the hell do you know how much debt I’m in?” John snapped.
“You thought if we came to Boston we would feel more like a detective team again?” John felt his heart sink a little. Maybe Sherlock was just trying to make them more of a unit in their work partnership again, nothing more.
“Yes.”
“John—”
“Jesus,” John muttered, wading out a little to help a very waterlogged Sherlock out of the river, just as the rain had started picking up to a drenching pour. “You must be freezing, this water—”
“Okay," Sherlock rasped.
John looked back out toward the water, watching Sherlock’s dark head bobbing farther and farther from the shore. Sherlock seemed to be a good swimmer and the current wasn’t fast, but John was still apprehensive. When Sherlock reached the cluster of logs, his head disappeared. Seconds ticked by slowly, until Sherlock finally surfaced again, swimming one-handed toward John, pulling something behind himself.
John chuckled. “Take it easy with the sweet nothings, you’re making my teeth hurt,” he teased.
“When do we have to check out?” he asked between kisses.
“I love you, Sherlock Holmes. I always have, and I always will.”
“Happy Christmas.” Mycroft held out the scotch. Sherlock raised an eyebrow as he walked past him, but he didn't take the bottle.
“Yes,” he said. “Even more than her.”
“You’re right under the mistletoe,” John said.
John watched him for a moment before he went on. “It doesn’t matter to me whatsoever how much experience you’ve had. The reason I was asking all of these questions was because I want to make sure that you want to do this, and that it’s not physically or emotionally painful for you. I… I have wanted to do this–be with you–for
Sherlock had expected Valentine’s Day to be no different. After all, it was their first one as a couple, and John was the romantic of the two of them. As long as there was some kind of shag involved, Sherlock probably wouldn’t object to whatever John had planned.
Looking back after that day, try as he might, he couldn’t remember what he had said while he stood there, except for the last part. “Don’t be dead. Please. Just for me.”
John pressed his lips together.
One Thursday night, John was reading a book in his chair, with a cold cup of tea next to him and the child monitor on the side table. Sherlock was perched in his own chair, his fingers steepled over his lips, watching John.
“Did I get it all right?” Sherlock asked, over-emphasizing the “t” at the end of the last word as he unlocked the door and pushed it open.
“Mmmm?” John breathed, kissing Sherlock deeply, slowly, making him whimper again.
He straddled Sherlock, kissing his pale throat and down his chest, trailing his fingers down Sherlock’s stomach to his belt buckle. As he undid Sherlock’s trousers, he swirled his tongue around one peaked nipple, then the other. Sherlock arched up into him, making a glorious whimpering sound.
“You know, I’m not entirely sure your clothes will fit me.” John peered into a beaker of some noxious-looking substance on the countertop.
“You’ll have to sit up a bit again.”
Sherlock nodded, knowing why John was asking him that question over and over, but feeling exasperated by it all the same.
Sherlock paused, nodding, as if to himself. “Chlorine gas inhalation. I would have to do some tests, but I’m almost certain. The color and pattern of burns, the edema, the material under her fingernails.”
Sherlock opened his eyes blearily, looking up at him with the fondly scathing look that he’d given John many times before... but never when they were in bed together.
“Pleasure,” Sherlock said. “Now, since you live a twenty-minute walk from here, can I interest you in simply coming to my flat for a coffee and a clean jumper instead? My flat is just across the street."
“Do you enjoy swimming, Mr. Watson?” Moriarty said over his shoulder. When he was finished, he dropped the eraser, wiping the chalk from his hands on a rag.
“Jesus,” John muttered under his breath. He was standing in front of the UCL aquatic center, which he’d seen on the news several times that week.
“No, you’re bloody
“Sherlock, please turn around.”
Downing the last of his scotch in one gulp, John walked slowly toward the living room, pausing directly underneath the beam.
“Nothing, nothing, it’s….”
the question is who, and why—”
“No,” Sherlock said, fisting his hand in John’s shirt to keep him on the bed.
John nodded, holding the water in his lap in case she needed more.
“You would have to transfer, probably to Bart’s,” Sherlock interrupted, untucking his violin from his neck. “You have the necessary A levels, so you would just have to submit your application.”
“Breathe,” John said, looking up at him from right above his cock.
“Why are you telling me this?” John felt his throat tighten. “Are you trying to make me feel guilty for being with Mary? Because the only reason I was with her—”
Inside the car was a man in his early thirties, who was wearing a pinstripe three-piece suit. He was twirling an umbrella in his hand and watching John with an expression of curious bemusement.
John cleared his throat, picking up one of the cups of tea and placing it next to Sherlock’s elbow. “So I guess I’ll get my things and move over tomorrow? Shouldn’t take long, I basically only have my textbooks and some clothes. My flat was furnished.”
There was a baby monitor on the counter, along with a mostly-empty bottle of formula. Some kind of experiment was in progress on the kitchen table, tea cups of noxious-looking fluids interspersed with baby toys, and a toddler book on the solar system was sitting on the high chair tray.
“You just keep saying my name over and over again, do you know you’re doing that?” John snapped. Suddenly everything felt too close, Sherlock felt too close. How had it gone on this long? How had he not snapped before this? It felt like he’d been walking on a tightrope for almost a decade, waiting to fall off.
John’s hand stilled in Sherlock’s hair. “Making you come?” John finished for him, his voice very quiet. “Are you saying you’ve never had an orgasm with another person?”
He wished he had tried to save up his luck to use now.
“John Watson,” John said, holding out his hand. “I’m studying at the School of Laws at UCL. I’m particularly interested in criminal law, so if you wouldn’t mind my being here, I think I could learn something.”
The morning sunlight was starting to peek in through the window, threatening to bring him to consciousness, so John groaned and burrowed more deeply into his pillow. As he drifted through what was starting to feel like a terrible hangover, he could almost imagine that he could smell Sherlock’s hair. It was like squinting while looking at the sun.
“Are you still okay?”
be a doctor. You have the temperament, the mind of a healer. If you need evidence, look no further than your actions today.”
Moriarty smiled again, all teeth. “See you at the next lecture. We will be discussing
Sighing as if it were a huge inconvenience, Sherlock opened his mouth and John placed them on his tongue. He grabbed the glass of water on Sherlock’s bedside and helped him drink.
“Are you sure?” John asked. Because there was no going back from this. There was no way he could ever go back to not kissing Sherlock once he started.
“John?” Sherlock blinked up at him, seeming to have difficulty focusing. He clutched his head with one hand. “What are you doing?”
He busied himself, making sure everything was ready. It took him a while to actually clean the kitchen table of any noxious experiments, putting them on a side table and disinfecting the surface. Once that was done, he started to get the tableware and wine glasses out of the cupboard.
John growled, taking him all the way down his throat, as he pressed one finger inside Sherlock, massaging the muscle to open him up.
“Fine, but text me later, alright? I’m putting my number in your phone.” He snatched Sherlock’s mobile off the table and programmed his name and number in. Sherlock didn’t move or otherwise respond, so John picked up his bookbag and strode out with what little dignity he could muster.
As Sherlock waited for an answer, his heart started pounding.
“God, yes,” Sherlock said, his voice so low that he could barely hear it.
of felony-murder. Quite thrilling. Ta,” Moriarty said, grabbing his briefcase and, with one last smile, left the room.
After a few more minutes of the noise, however, he realized that they were in the middle of a city.
“I’m home,” he called up the stairs as he propped his umbrella up to dry.
The phone rang several times, and John was about to hang up when the other end finally clicked.
John frowned. “I’m not going anywhere, Sherlock. That’s not what I’m talking about.”
“An enemy,” the man said without wasting a beat. He looked up at John as if to judge his reaction.
John awoke with a start, realizing immediately that the room was lighter than he remembered. He’d obviously fallen asleep sometime in the night.
“I’m here,” John said. He needed to get closer. He rolled over until he was half on top of Sherlock. God, it felt good, it felt amazing… like jumping into a cold lake on a hot summer’s afternoon, like the taste of a snowflake on his tongue, like listening to a lone violin’s melody. He was home. There was nothing else to it.
John moved a bit closer, sliding his arm around Sherlock’s waist, so that they were breathing each other’s air.
, Mike had said.
Sherlock huffed. “You went on about how the previous professor suddenly went on sabbatical for at least half an hour the other day. Besides, when it’s something about you, I do care.”
If she turned out to be a chemist, Sherlock would probably spout some bravado about not caring, but he’d secretly be thrilled. John didn’t much care what Rosie did, so long as she didn’t follow in her mother’s footsteps: a career murderess who was finally murdered herself.
“We need to get a cab,” John said.
“No, it’s… no. There’s plenty of room for both of us. It would be silly.”
“Now you’re just taking the piss,” Sherlock huffed.
“You’re the one who put it up, not Mrs. Hudson.”
How many times had he lain next to Sherlock like this, aching to turn over and kiss him?
After a long while, John finally leaned back, propping his head up on his elbow.
“Don’t say you’re sorry,” John said, “I want to try something else now anyway.”
This had to be a joke. Someone was trying to drive him insane. Or, more likely, he finally had gone insane.
John took a few grateful gulps, then leaned his head back against the door, closing his eyes.
The thought caught him off-guard. He’d danced around it before, but he’d never actually given it a name. He’d never loved before, never said it to anyone before, and now that John was in his life he could not foresee ever loving anyone else ever again.
“Okay?” John raised an eyebrow again.
“John.” Sherlock almost sounded like he was pleading with him, which just made John angrier.
“Except for the fact that Harry is short for Harriet.”
of burglary as if he were just any other professor. John’s heart was racing, and he felt like he was going to be sick.
Sherlock shrugged. “Your shoes. They are several years old, but have been cleaned well. Your phone is also a hand-me-down, inscribed with ‘Harry Watson,’ so obviously a relative. Ergo, you take care of your possessions, and you don’t have a lot of expendable income. You were also distressed about the amount of money you were spending on the coffee, but you decided that the necessity of studying all night was more important in this case—even though we are about to go on holiday and none of the other law students are currently in the library. Therefore, you needed to do well, even more so than other law students. Scholarship. Easy.”
“With pleasure." John smiled, leading him down the hall to Sherlock’s room.
“Would you believe that I fancied a Fenway hot dog?”
Sherlock pulled off immediately, licking the spit from his lips. “Problem?” he asked, a tightness appearing around his eyes.
Sherlock pursed his lips. “Well. Maybe if it’s above an eight.”
“I need you to fuck me,” Sherlock finally managed, in a rush.
“I think I do,” John said, before he stepped closer, his hand sliding down to grasp the lapel of Sherlock’s coat and pulling him down into a kiss.
“What?” John glanced at him, startled.
“Whatever,” John said, waving his hand. “That was ridiculous. That was the most ridiculous thing… I’ve ever done,” he panted, shaking his head.
Before Sherlock could make a no-doubt scathing remark, a man in his early thirties with kind eyes strode up to them. “Sherlock,” the new arrival said, taking Sherlock’s hand and shaking it. “Thanks for coming.”
A few hours later, everyone was fed and a bit tipsy, and they were all sitting in the living room listening to Sherlock playing “Silent Night” on the violin. It wasn’t snowing, but there was a light frost on the window, a fire was crackling in the hearth, and the lights were twinkling in the dim light. Molly was sitting in Lestrade’s lap, wearing fake antlers (because, as usual, Sherlock had refused to wear them). Lestrade whispered something in her ear, and she giggled.
to know. You can’t tell me that after all this time, you don’t know.”
Sherlock hesitated. “John.”
“Promise me,” Sherlock rasped, his eyes still closed.
John was reaching into his bookbag for his mobile when someone tall bumped into him, spilling the quadruple espresso all over his jumper.
Sighing again, John closed his eyes. “From now on, I’ll let you know when you’re going too far. With me or with other people. Now let me sleep.”
John hadn’t seen Sherlock naked since he’d been back, except when he’d been in the hospital after he’d been shot, but that was only from the waist up.
Everything else in the world dimmed completely. There was no sound, no touch, nothing other than Sherlock.
John looked up from his textbook, blinking blearily to try and refocus his tired eyes. “What?”
“So you know who he is?”
They had a lovely meal, sharing a bottle of wine, and John’s eyes glinted in the candlelight. As they chatted easily over dessert, Sherlock knew he had the perfect moment to do it. He looked up at John, who was watching him, a soft smile on his face… and he started to say it, but for some reason, he couldn’t. It was too much. What if John left again? He couldn’t bear it; he would rather have John like this, than not at all.
“Wow, you two actually have a tree this year, well done,” Lestrade said, clapping John on the shoulder.
“I don’t understand why she has to eat this at all.”
“It happened right before you came back?”
He stared down at the paper again, but he couldn’t bring himself to start folding it. Making the cranes had been part folly, part a compulsion, part a reason to hope. If he folded the last one, that would be it. He would have no more reason to hope, no more reason to do anything.
He heard another blow, much harder this time, and the sound of someone falling to the ground. Without hesitation, John strode around the corner, his fists clenched.
“Stop it, Sherlock.”
John knew his cue; that meant Sherlock didn’t want to talk anymore for a while. “I’m just… I’m going to take a shower.”
“God, yes,” Sherlock said, looking down to see John’s cock between his legs. It was unbelievably hot, and dirty in a way.
There was a little girl tucked in the sheets of the bed. Her head was covered with white bandages, and her skin almost completely faded into the white smock she was wearing.
“An arch enemy, according to him. How many enemies do you have, exactly? Not including the blokes from the alley?”
“John! Are you well?”
They walked down the aisle to a row near the back of the section and sat down in their seats. John looked around the stands at all the people in their Red Sox hats and jerseys. The baseball players themselves were out on the field warming up, but the game hadn’t begun yet.
“Time’s it?” Sherlock asked, his voice low and gravelly, which sent a small shiver down John’s spine. John realized that his hand was still on Sherlock’s shoulder, which was dangerous, but he didn’t want to move back.
“What do we… what do we do now?” Sherlock asked, a bit breathless.
“This way!” Sherlock yelled, veering into an alley to the right. John nearly ran past by accident, stopping short and bumping into an elderly man.
want it, and he had repressed it for so long that it was eating away at him inside. He caught the eye of the flight attendant again, signaling for another scotch. It was going to be a long flight.
After a full week, John was unable to justify a further delay. With more dread than he felt when he went to Contracts class, John took the jumper and walked to Sherlock’s flat one night after supper. The lights on the first floor were on, but it was unclear whether anyone was home. He placed the package on the doorstep, lingering there longer than was truly necessary, oscillating as to whether he should knock. Before he could make a decision, however, he heard some violin music filtering down from the top floor. He glanced up at the window, where he could just make out the outline of a tall, lithe figure silhouetted behind the curtains.
John looked around for a chair, found one by the door, and pulled it over.
“Case on, then?” John asked, walking over to his chair and sitting down.
“You’re doing it again,” John said, without any heat.
“Stop being an idiot.” Sherlock leaned his head back against the wall and closed his eyes.
John stared at him for a long moment, and Sherlock stared back, and John couldn’t quite fathom that Sherlock had actually said those words to him, but then…then it hit him.
John stopped in his tracks, looking over at the car, which rolled to a stop. A pair of sharp, almost threatening eyes were trained on him over the half-raised window.
Everything about the night around him seemed to fade away into the background. He felt frozen on the step, the darkness thickening around him, and the only thing he could hear was the single violin.
John gave Sherlock his best soldier stare, and for a long moment it was like time had been suspended. Sherlock almost seemed to have stopped breathing.
“He didn’t give a shit, Harry,” John said, not even bothering to deny that this was because of Sherlock. “He killed himself without a thought of what it would do to me.”
“I know,” John whispered against his lips. “Me too.”
“You don’t seem very frightening,” John quipped.
John’s hand tightened on the strap of his bookbag as he glanced down the street. He should probably call for help. That would be the most sensible thing to do.
“We were idiots.”
John put his ear to Sherlock’s chest, and he could hear a strong heartbeat. Sherlock groaned, seeming to come back to consciousness a bit, and John sat up again.
“I’m not good at this.” Sherlock couldn’t stand to meet John’s eyes, so instead he looked up at the ceiling.
John cocked his head a bit. “And now…?”
“What do you want, love?”
After depositing the pink case in the living room as directed, John took Sherlock straight to his room, pushing the door open. The whole room was immaculate, in contrast to the general disarray of the living room and kitchen. The wallpaper was a vibrant shade of green, and there was a framed periodic table on the wall next to the door, on another was an anatomical drawing of a bee. The bed was covered in expensive-looking sheets and was made with precision.
Sherlock must have gotten up to check on Rosie in the night, because the baby monitor was on the bedside table, but there were no sounds coming from it.
“Possibly… but the numbers…”
Sherlock twisted John off him, standing quickly and pulling John to his feet before taking off again.
I also took some liberties regarding the general organization of law studies at the University College of London School of Laws, and based it mostly on the way classes are taught here in the US (I don’t know if they hold midterm examinations or whether they use the socratic method for example).
, he told her.
In the end, it was three more weeks before he saw Sherlock Holmes again, and it was purely by accident.
John shook his head. “Okay, let's say you got all of that right...how could you
John inhaled, breathing in the proximity of him, trying to burn the moment into his memory forever; the way Sherlock’s eyes glinted in the low light, the way he smelled just a bit of baby formula and formaldehyde, the creak of the old house around them, the wail of the siren fading to stillness.
“Mr. Watson,” a smooth voice said. Something about the voice made the hair on the back of John’s neck stand up. “Please get in.”
Sherlock harrumphed. That was the actual sound that came out of his mouth, a
“Well, well,” a chillingly singsong voice said. “Nice of you to join us.”
Sherlock didn’t turn, waving him off with one hand as he continued speaking. “So you haven’t been paid in how long?” he asked the man on the screen, scribbling on a note pad.
.” He needed John to fill him, to be part of him, to be inside of him. It was almost a physical ache, deep inside.
“It was supposed to be a reminder of a promise I made.”
He reached out to smooth Sherlock’s hair a bit, and Sherlock shifted in his sleep, starting to wake up. John leaned down to kiss him, as he’d wished he could do so many times before.
“And what do you want, love?” John reached up to stroke Sherlock’s hair, the way he always did after they had sex.
When the fourth inning finally started, Sherlock sat forward in his seat during the entire inning, watching their section instead of the game. John split his attention, trying to watch both, and by the time the inning ended and Sherlock sat back, he wasn’t sure if he had seen anything unusual.
“Bring me some,” Sherlock called.
John’s immediate impulse was to refuse. He wanted nothing more than to stay with Sherlock now, forever, starting right away. But that very impulse scared him more than anything else. He was in danger of falling head over heels for this man who wanted nothing more out of him than a flatmate.
Sherlock opened her mouth to look down her throat. “There’s also some kind of irritation on her throat. I’ve seen these kinds of chemical burns before. There was a dolt of a student who mishandled chemicals in our lab last year.”
Sherlock arched again, moaning, trying to stay still but unable to manage it. At the same time, his brain was spinning, unable to process everything. He was with John, they were so much more than they had been before... but they still hadn’t talked about what they were, what they would be. What did John want? Did he just want to have sex? Did he want… everything else? Sherlock could almost feel his body fighting to get to orgasm, but at the same time, his brain didn’t want to shut off.
He should go back downstairs and apologize. They should probably talk about the fact that his wife, who had almost killed Sherlock once, had then taken a bullet for him. But they didn’t talk about things. They didn’t express their feelings like that.
If Sherlock noticed his soppy contemplations, he gave no indication whatsoever. Instead, he picked up the formula bottle, waving it between his index and thumb.
“What happened to you, Doctor Watson?” Chi asked eventually, her voice so quiet he could barely hear her.
Sherlock was now inspecting the floor of the locker with a magnifying glass. “Not with words, no. With their incompetency, yes.” He swept his finger across the locker floor and sniffed it. Looking intrigued, he pulled a small baggie containing a cotton swab out of his pocket. He swirled the swab on the floor of the locker before replacing it in the bag and sealing it carefully.
. John was willing to take whatever Sherlock would give him, even if that meant maintaining the status quo.
“Who’s hungry?” he asked brightly.
“John’s favorite Christmas song.” Sherlock proclaimed matter-of-factly.
“I’m here to check on you,” John said, pulling himself up to his full doctorly height and stepping over to the bed to pick up her chart, as if he were supposed to be there. “I’m Doctor Watson, by the way.”
He didn't allow himself to deny it anymore: he’d been in love with Sherlock for so long that it was almost like it had settled into his DNA. He had lived with it uncomfortably before Sherlock fell of the roof of Barts, but he
Sherlock arched higher into him, thrusting against John’s cock, against his hand. John held him, and imagined what it would be like to thrust into his body, to be completely enveloped in Sherlock.
John leaned in, pausing, letting Sherlock move back if he wanted, but...Sherlock’s fingers dug harder into John’s chest, as if to urge him on. John’s heart in his throat, he leaned in just a bit more.
“No, I think it’s cute.” John chuckled, poking him in the side lightly. “Sherlock Holmes, hopeless romantic.”
John stopped his thrusts, leaning back slightly. “Look at me,” he said.
“Stupid,” John said into his hands. “Stupid, stupid, stupid.”
John sighed, frustrated. The problem was, John
"Shall we?" Sherlock said, striding over and opening the door for John.
John smiled, a rare smile, and pulled him down by the collar for another lingering kiss. He leaned back fractionally to whisper against Sherlock’s lips. “Now, you take me to bed, Sherlock Holmes.”
And then he got his hand on Sherlock’s cock, finally, feeling the silky skin and teasing the head with his thumb. Sherlock moaned, his eyes fluttering closed, and John chased the sound with a kiss, continuing to stroke him firmly, slowly.
John bent again, mouthing the vee of Sherlock’s hip while smoothing his hands down Sherlock’s thighs. Sherlock felt dizzy, his breaths coming in short bursts.
“Okay, okay, get a room,” John called out good-naturedly, pouring himself some more scotch. He glanced at Sherlock, who was watching them with a slightly peeved expression.
Rosie was standing up in her crib, rubbing her eyes blearily, babbling nonsensically. John clicked the baby monitor off and went to the crib to pick her up.
Eventually, a hot dog vendor came down the aisle, and John flagged him down.
Sherlock’s forehead wrinkled. “I should think it’s obvious.”
Sherlock made a face like he’d bitten into something sour. “Surely there’s another word for it.”
It wasn’t too late. They could still be together, if that’s what Sherlock really wanted.
Chi opened her eyes. “She had cancer too. A different kind than mine. She had lots of spots on her legs and lumps on her neck.”
John crossed his arms. “Okay, putting aside the fact that entering a crime scene unaccompanied is one hundred percent illegal, why are you doing this?”
Chi's eyes didn’t hold the gaze most people looked at him with. Instead, she looked at him with understanding. It was the kind of understanding that only the dead and dying have for one another. He was a dead man walking, and Chi knew it.
Sherlock sat down again, but closer to John’s chest this time, so that John’s cock was behind him instead of in front. He reached back to ensure that John’s cock was nestled in between his cheeks, not inside, but sliding along his opening.
“And a happy new year,” John joked, and then he rolled over to settle between Sherlock’s legs, their cocks sliding against each other.
John leaned back, lubing up his cock with one hand and then positioning himself. “I know what you need,” he said. He pushed in, hard, just like Sherlock wanted.
“I’m not going anywhere,” John said, and he knew, more than he’d ever known anything, that it was true.
“I…” Sherlock started to say.
“Promise.”
John barked out a laugh. He’d never realized he wore specific shoes for dates, but that was exactly the kind of thing Sherlock would know about him.
John frowned. “We were just… you mean,
When Sherlock blinked his eyes open on an unusually cold Valentine’s Day morning, therefore, he hadn’t expected to feel any different. He was on his side, turned toward the window, and he could see snowflakes dancing downward against a white-grey sky. John was snoring softly behind him, his warm body a solid, comforting presence. Normally, Sherlock was an early riser, getting up far before John, always itching to start the day. Today, though… he felt completely content to stay cocooned in the warmth afforded by John and by the down blanket covering them both. For some reason, there was nothing he would rather do than stay here, with the love of his life, until something forced him to leave.
John growled, not wanting to stop, but knowing this would be better for them both if he did. He let go long enough to lean over and open the drawer with such haste that he nearly knocked the lamp off the side table.
She nodded. “What are you and your boyfriend coming to the states for? Vacation?”
“So why do we have to go to a game?” John asked, once they were through security. “You haven’t actually told me.”
John felt his hands clench into fists. “Why?”
“Gone eleven,” John said. “I didn’t know you snored,” he added, grinning.
Sherlock pressed his lips together. “What took us so long?”
Almost exactly a year after he had first been in Chi’s room, John was given an assignment to do a consult in the cancer wing. Time was a wheel, turning on its axis and coming back full circle, tormenting him, it seemed.
On a dreary, grey Thursday evening, John was walking down a somewhat-deserted street toward his flat. He hadn’t eaten anything in a day and a half, and he was contemplating whether he could afford a sandwich, when he heard a sound coming from the passage to his right. It was barely discernible over the noise of traffic, but it sounded very much like the distinct crunching noise a fist made against facial bones.
“They were only hiring men who worked at the stadium and had a rare 100th anniversary Red Sox hat, specifically a red one, which had never been washed. Which, essentially, meant that Wilson was the only hirable candidate."
do you—”
“Your heart is pounding,” Sherlock whispered, his fingers pressing harder into John’s chest.
“It wasn’t your fault,” Sherlock whispered.
After a long while the song ended, and John shook his head slightly to clear it. Stuffing his hands in his pockets, he turned and strode away before he could be spotted.
Sherlock’s expression was inscrutable. “I thought I was being clear, John,” he said, his voice a low rumble. “You do know I hate repeating myself.”
They got to their section, where Wilson was currently checking tickets. He was a middle aged man with a mustache, somewhat portly, and he was wearing a filthy Red Sox hat. It must have been red at one point, but was now a dingy brown from never being washed.
“I’ve been waiting for seven years to suck your cock, I think that’s long enough,” Sherlock said dryly.
, who are all beautiful land mermaids and tropical fish.
, where exactly do you suggest we get breast milk?” John snapped.
Sherlock sighed again. “I just… I don’t care about an arbitrary date where you’re supposed to celebrate love, but... I do. Love you, that is. And any day that you’re here with me is a day I want to celebrate, because that fact in itself is extraordinary enough.”
“John,” Sherlock whined. He was actually
, and Sherlock couldn’t stop
Sherlock raised his eyebrows. “B-body heat?”
“You’ve become more attractive with age,” he said. “I’m not sure that’s entirely fair.”
Eventually, he walked the long walk all the way back to his flat.
He opened his eyes again, and John was bottoming out on Sherlock’s cock, pulling and twisting with one hand at the base, his blue eyes searing into Sherlock’s gaze. But Sherlock still couldn’t let go.
Sherlock looked at him as if that were a ridiculous question.
“Please don’t leave me,” Sherlock blurted out. “Please, John.”
John frowned. “Yeah, yeah she did.”
John scowled up at him. “No,” he said curtly. “Why?”
Sherlock paused. “Caring about them won’t help save them, John.”
John laughed, a new, rare joy in his chest. “I don’t mind,” he said, leaning in for another kiss.
“God, I love you,” John whispered.
Sherlock smiled up at him, looking younger than he had in years. “Breakfast?”
looks. “A Red Sox game, John.”
John rubbed his eyes with one hand, leaning back slightly to look up at the ceiling. They were more than they were before, but it was still viscous, unformed, not fully actualized. After so many years of waiting to be with Sherlock, the burden of longing he had carried for far too long had finally been lifted. The problem was, now John had no idea how to act around Sherlock. They knew each other inside out, possibly better than two people had ever known each other before, but now it was as if they had turned over a stone and found another world underneath.
“Yeah,” John said, still hesitant. “If Mrs. Hudson came up in the morning and found me in your bed though…I don’t know, people might talk.”
John didn’t reply, simply leaning down to kiss Sherlock’s forehead.
John looked out at the street in front of them, people going to work, living their lives.
He walked into his bedroom, looking up at the cranes on his ceiling. He tried to ignore the burning feeling in his chest, his lungs, but it started to consume him like a wildfire. He stood up on his bed and ripped two strings of cranes down, taking them into the living room and throwing them in his fireplace. He lit a match, hesitating for a moment before he threw it on top. As he poured himself another scotch, he watched the paper curling under the flames. The scotch wasn’t numbing him enough, and for the first time in his life he wished he had something even stronger.
“Sherlock?” John said, standing up and rubbing his eyes. He sat on the side of the bed, catching one of Sherlock’s flailing arms.
“I know,” John said, because he did. He’d been imagining this moment for so long, and now that it was finally here—he was about to have sex with Sherlock—he felt completely overwhelmed.
Sherlock was still at the window, his violin now in its case, his hands in his pockets. John sighed, looking up again at the blasted mistletoe.
Now, for the first time since before Sherlock had been dead, they were clear of any obstacles, real or imagined. He was free to tell Sherlock how he felt, finally, yet he hadn’t. He told himself he was just waiting for his moment, for the right time, whatever that could be.
“What do you mean?” he asked softly.
Sherlock’s eyes were so vulnerable, a touch of fear. “Second thoughts?” he asked, in a tone that was certainly meant to be airy but didn’t quite reach it.
Sherlock’s breath stuttered and he blinked his eyes open blearily. For a moment, they just looked at each other.
“Ba ba ba,” Rosie said, trying to get their attention, banging her spoon against her tray. “Ba!”
Sherlock watched him for a moment. “Did she have a phone?” he asked finally.
He nodded once, stiffly. He took the crane, turning and walking out of the bar without another word.
There was nothing he could do, since he didn’t have a way of warning Sherlock. As John was about to turn toward the library, though, his phone pinged. He stopped, glancing downward to see an address and a single line of text from an unknown number:
John slapped his paper to the ground, crossing his arms and looking up at him with amusement and a bit of irritation. “Enlighten me then, genius.”
“Yesss,” John licked his hand, reaching down to hold their cocks together. Sherlock threw his head back, holding on to John’s hips, rocking into every thrust.
This was what he’d been waiting for, and it had been so long that he didn’t know how to handle the waiting coming to an end.
, Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said, his head still bowed.
“Mmph,” was the only response. He was trembling slightly, probably from the chills.
“Not nearly,” Sherlock called over his shoulder.
“Come on, John!”
to play matchmaker, though. And Sherlock never did anything without a purpose.
Sherlock was already a trembling mess by the time John licked two fingers of his fingers and then swallowed Sherlock all the way down. He bottomed out, his eyes watering with the effort, as he circled Sherlock’s hole with his fingers, just barely pressing inward, holding back enough not to overstimulate his already-tired muscle. Sherlock slid his fingers through John’s hair, making small thrusts up into John’s mouth, and John could see it in his face as he started to come. He pulled off again, just teasing the head as he stroked the bottom of Sherlock’s cock with his hand, faster and faster, until Sherlock was coming in long pulses down his throat.
The carousel ran out of steam and slowed down, turning off, plunging the room in semi-darkness, the dim grey twilight coming through the window doing little to illuminate it.
to tell you, now. So you understand.”
“Did it ever occur to you that I have my reasons?”
“Um… okay.” John busied himself by plumping up Sherlock’s pillows a bit, helping him sit up against the headboard.
“Right.” John leaned against the lockers. “So what am I doing here, exactly?”
long. I’ll stop whenever and if you want me to, but… I want to make you feel good, Sherlock. We can figure this out together. And if you decide you don’t want to have sex at all, we don’t have to. We can take this slowly. Is that alright with you?”
John was having trouble stringing together coherent thoughts. “I want, fuck, I want.”
“Of course,” Sherlock replied, as if this too were a ridiculous question.
Without another word, Sherlock started sprinting toward the cab, and John cursed under his breath, running after him.
?” Sherlock asked more urgently, his eyes insistent.
It felt different, somehow, to look at Sherlock’s body now. They weren't really simply flatmates anymore, but they weren’t really something more, either. John tried to keep his gaze at eye level as he helped Sherlock down into the tub.
He could hear Harry sigh, then she sat down next to him, crossing her arms and leaning them against her knees. “You can’t keep doing this to yourself, love,” she said. “Believe me, I know.”
Sherlock curled himself around John, sighing contentedly.
“Wait—” John protested.
“You have no idea how long I’ve wanted to do this,” he said, and sunk his mouth all the way down.
“Cheers,” John said, clinking their glasses together.
John hesitated a fraction of a second longer before he turned and strode off in the opposite direction.
“I have to see what happens during the fourth and eighth innings. The innings where Wilson is distracted by having to keep score,” Sherlock replied,
“It’s just… welcome to London?” Laughing so hard he couldn’t quite breathe, John stepped backward, leaning against the wall of the building nearest them.
John moaned, hands fisting into the bedclothes, his body starting to shake. Sherlock pulled down the waistband with one finger so that he could lick the head of John’s cock, teasing at the frenulum. John gasped, the entire world narrowing down to Sherlock’s hot, exquisite mouth wrapped around him.
“A third year. She—I knew her,” he finished lamely. He cleared his throat and continued, despite feeling like something was lodged in his trachea. “She tutored me last semester. She was brilliant, top of her class.”
“Don’t even think about it.” John caught him, hefting him up to sitting position on the side of the bed, then slinging Sherlock’s arm over his shoulder to help him toward the bathroom. “I promise you’ll feel better.”
Sherlock keened, hips making little aborted movements into John’s hand.
Lestrade put a hand on his shoulder. “I’m sorry, John, I know this is difficult, but I need to know. What was her last name?”
“You don’t play fair,” Sherlock gasped into his neck.
Sherlock looked at him. “You watch baseball?”
John nodded sternly before turning back to his task. He had barely spoken to Mycroft in the last year, but it wasn’t unlike him to show up unannounced.
“Anything good?” John asked, nodding toward the magazine.
This was absurd. He’d only met him a grand total of two times, but the truth was, John already knew that it was a lost cause. Sherlock was one of the strangest, most brilliant and most cryptic men he’d ever known… and he was completely drawn in, despite himself. The man was like a drug, and he was hooked.
“I couldn’t bear it if you...if you left again.”
“She told me,” Mr. Hatayama started again, “that she knew once she… went, that you would quit. She said that I should give this to you later, and remind you why you were folding the cranes.”
“Okay,” Sherlock said, walking back into view.
“Hello, Ken. It’s John. Doctor Watson.”
“Say it again. Please.”
John tilted his head slightly to the side. “‘Red Sox Red-Hatted League’? Doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, does it.”
“Don’t call him that,” John snapped before he could stop himself.
John rubbed his forehead with one hand. “How, exactly, do you know what I really want?”
“So…?” John repeated weakly, trying not to blanch under the intensity of the other man’s gaze.
“Yeah, right,” John said, jumping out of the car.
,” Sherlock gasped, tilting his hips upward into John’s movements. He could do this forever, always, having John on top of him like this, inside of him, filling him.
“How are you doing?” John asked, his eyes searching Sherlock’s face in his doctorly way.
“Or… I know we don’t do it very often, so…” John raised his head to meet Sherlock’s gaze, his eyes dark. “Would you like to fuck me?”
John licked his lips, realizing what he was referring to. “After the wedding, you mean?"
Eventually, he couldn’t take it anymore. Sherlock whimpered, fisting his hand in the short hairs on the back of John’s head, tugging on them as he felt his eyes starting to water.
“Would you like anything before we land?” a different flight attendant, this one a brunette, asked him.
“Good.” Sherlock groaned, equal parts sore and content, as John pulled himself out.
he thought.
“Shh,” John said, smoothing his hands up Sherlock’s thighs again. “We are doing this my way, remember? You’re still alright aren’t you?”
“You just seem so…” John trailed off, realizing he was going to finish that sentence with ‘
“Yoo hoo. Happy Christmas,” Mrs. Hudson called as she entered the room, holding the Christmas goose.
“This is cruel and unusual punishment,” Sherlock said, going into another round of coughing. “I’m not even
“Is this his idea of a joke?” John muttered under his breath, moving into the room and shutting the door behind him.
“Not sure yet.”
“She can’t talk yet, let alone express emotions like love and hate.”
“I…” Sherlock couldn’t seem to form any coherent sentences at this point, his entire world narrowing down to John’s hand, to his voice.
John swallowed, his tongue so dry that it stuck to the roof of his mouth, but he nodded.
“Yessss.” Sherlock sighed, clenching his muscles around John’s hard cock.
“Oh my goodness,” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed. “Look.”
“No.”
Sherlock smirked, then raised up onto his knees enough that their cocks were no longer touching.
Sherlock didn’t say anything, but as lips slid upward into a grin. “With pleasure,” he whispered back.
Sherlock stopped at the ledge, which was a good three feet from the next building.
Instead of trying to keep Sherlock awake, as that appeared to be a lost cause, John decided to wake him up every twenty or thirty minutes. It wasn’t exactly easy work, but Sherlock would make some kind of sarcastic remark each time, so at least his brain function was close to normal.
“Okay,” John said, “Close your eyes for me.”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed, as if his brain was trying desperately to comprehend those words despite the fever. John leaned down and brushed his lips against Sherlock’s forehead.
John felt something tug in his chest again. He pressed his lips together.
Chi was released from the hospital under home care as the leaves began to fall. John helped her father carefully pack her cranes in boxes and put them in the backseat of their car.
Sherlock refused to give the case to Scotland Yard, and John was too worried about him to argue. They caught a cab back to Baker Street, once they could find one who was willing to take them despite the fact that Sherlock was sopping wet.
he wanted John to mark him up as much as possible.
“John, come
Sherlock looked up at the window, as the snow drifted downward outside silently. There was nothing else he wanted, not anymore. There was nothing left to chase after. Sure, there would always be cases, but there would also be John. And maybe someday in the far future, a cottage in the country somewhere, where John would write under a patio while he worked in the garden, and bees buzzed in the background.
“What now?” John asked, eventually.
Sherlock stopped, looking out at the street, obviously trying to seem nonchalant.
“Another top third year student at the School of Laws, dead under mysterious circumstances,” Sherlock mused once they were alone, scanning the body.
Sherlock shrugged. “The royal family of England has no effect on the world one way or another. Unfortunately,
John raised his head to kiss Sherlock softly. “I know. I love you too.”
The only differentiation between the girl and the sheets of the bed behind her was her large, dark eyes, like dark pools of water in deep winter. They seemed bigger proportionally than they should be. John had seen it before in children who were nearing the end of terminal illness.
“Meretricious,” Sherlock said, but his lips quirked upward into a lopsided grin.
Instead, he walked over to his bed and lay down, looking up at the ceiling.
, not anymore. Before Sherlock died, it happened all the time; inadvertent brushes of hands or feet, but now...it was too delicate, this thing between them, like a bubble that could burst at the smallest contact.
He had never loved someone this much, and that realization had been terrifying and immobilizing. Even though he had been back at Baker Street for a year, even though he was committed to staying with Sherlock for the rest of his life, he couldn’t have…everything. To be sure, there were more casual touches than there had been before—Sherlock sometimes lay his head in John’s lap, or casually tangled their feet together while they watched bad telly—but nothing seemed to indicate that Sherlock wanted anything
John cupped his cheek, leaning in to kiss him once, just a brush of lips.
Ten minutes later, John found himself standing outside a building near campus. He glanced down at his phone, then back up.
“I managed,” Sherlock said with attempted bravado, but he seemed exhausted. He dropped the towel from around his waist and slid back into bed, wincing as if it were a herculean effort. He sighed, closing his eyes. He seemed to be breathing a little easier, if only marginally.
“What the hell are you doing?” One of the men tried to push past him, but he stood his ground.
Yet, he couldn’t help thinking about Sherlock inadvertently standing under the mistletoe. John imagined catching him, sliding his hands around his hips, maybe kissing him briefly. Maybe Sherlock would take it as a joke, maybe it would mean nothing to him, but if John was able to kiss him, just once…to feel his lips, his breath, his tongue, the silk of his shirt under John’s fingertips…
Sherlock didn’t move or speak, and John sighed. “Sherlock, I want to talk to you like adults, if we can manage it. Can you please look at me?”
When they got to the bridge over the pond in the middle, John realized he didn’t really want to go back to the room quite yet. He touched Sherlock lightly on the arm, and paused, looking out over the black water. Sherlock stopped, standing next to him in silence.
“Yeah.” John braced himself, pressing his lips together. “Are you sure you want this? With me?”
Physical contact was something they didn’t
“No, I’m not. I’m just not interested.”
Sherlock bit back a retort, because John was always less likely to do what he wanted if he let verbal barbs loose. John simply watched him, arms crossed, not saying anything.
“Wait, so the police never actually ask for your help?”
Sherlock’s lower lip trembled slightly. John only caught the motion because they were so close.
John pinched his eyes with one hand, and for a long moment neither of them spoke.
"I'm not letting you back away from me,” John interrupted, suddenly feeling more certain than he had before in the face of Sherlock’s doubt. “Not now that we have found each other, not now that we have this. I couldn’t wait any longer if I tried.” John dipped down to kiss him deeply once. When he pulled back, it was only a half inch.
“Thanks, Mrs. Hudson. Happy Christmas,” John said.
. Now the coppers are aware they are missing, thanks to our friend.”
John looked up from kissing Sherlock’s stomach in surprise. “Mycroft doesn’t mind?”
But the mistletoe, in their own flat…it was too much. It mocked him, rankled him, made his skin prickle. It was a reminder of what he wanted but couldn’t have.
This was bad. It was really, really bad.
Her breathing was a bit ragged, but her heart sounded good. Her pulse was slow but steady.
Sherlock sighed dramatically. “No one at NSY will take my hypotheses seriously, and their resistance is becoming unbelievably frustrating. So I’m just going to have to solve it on my own.”
Once they were gone, John ran quickly over to Sherlock’s limp form, turning him over onto his back.
“What-- what are you--” John stuttered, his heart racing.
Panic was quickly replaced by blistering anger. “Me?
John rested his elbows on his knees, folding his hands over his mouth and looking at Sherlock again. Sherlock basically had sacrificed everything for him, more than once, more than anyone would. Even without all the things he felt when they looked at each other…
John woke before dawn the next morning with their limbs entangled, Sherlock’s head resting on his chest.
Harry propped her chin on her arms. “A patient?”
Eventually, John broke the silence. “How did you know that’s my favorite Christmas song?”
“It was hers?”
Sherlock framed John’s head with his arms, shifting a little so that their cocks could slide against each other through their clothes. John arched up against him, his hands sliding down to cup Sherlock’s glorious ass, pulling him down hard.
Sherlock didn’t turn around. “I just do. Just as I know countless other things about you— so many things that I had to add another room in my mind palace to contain them all.”
But he never had. And now it almost felt too late.
“I just—you have no idea how long…” Sherlock said haltingly.
John shook his head. Sherlock would definitely not be interested in someone like him. He was obviously rich and seemed abnormally intelligent, and he probably only dated blokes who could afford cashmere jumpers and said things like “obstreperous” without any irony. And there was no way he could handle being flatmates with Sherlock; it would be extremely transparent that John was attracted to him and that would just be embarrassing.
“I’ll tell it to you.” Chi swallowed audibly, and John could see that her lips seemed too dry. He automatically reached for the water on the bedside table and helped her sit up. As she drank, she never stopped looking up at him. Her gaze was deeply unsettling for a reason he couldn’t quite pinpoint.
“I can’t do this anymore, Sherlock.”
“I love you, Sherlock,” he said again, very deliberately, just to get rid of any lingering ambiguity.
“There was for a little while,” he said after a long silence. “But she died too.”
John pocketed his phone, squared his shoulders and strode towards the door.
John snorted. “You’re the most observant man in the universe. You
John must have fallen asleep at some point, because the next thing he knew he was being awoken by Sherlock thrashing back and forth on the bed, his eyes still closed. The moonlight was now streaming across the floor and highlighting Sherlock’s face, which looked ghostly white.
“Fine, just get on with it. I’ve a lecture to attend. Let me know when it’s done.”
John’s breath caught in his throat. It wasn’t really the reply he'd been expecting, and it made him realize how much Sherlock had been holding back. There was so much they had avoided saying, so much tiptoeing around each other in the past year. He was done. He was so far beyond done, he couldn’t believe it had taken him so long to see it. It had been seven long years, and he
John left the door open a crack—he didn’t much care to find the baby monitor right now—and pulled Sherlock toward the bed, kissing him as he went, feverish with want.
Sherlock waved him away. “You can leave now. I’m fine. You’ve done your duty.”
Moriarty threw down the rag, stuffed his hands in his pockets and swaggered back to where John stood. “I suppose I should ask, instead, whether you can swim at all. It can be an important skill, you know. When you’re thrown headfirst into deep water, you don’t always know whether there are…sharks.” The sides of his mouth slid upward, slowly, into a mirthless grin.
Chi looked up from her paper at him. “Have you heard the story of Sadako and the One Thousand Paper Cranes?"
“I’m asking Mycroft–well, really, Anthea–to book the tickets and the hotel. We can’t use the Lear jet this time because he’s taking it to Morocco to mediate some kind of clandestine peace talks between Pakistan and India–”
It took him a month to go back to the hospital. When he finally did, the supervising doctor said nothing about his long absence. Instead, she looked at him with that pitying look, as if he were something broken that no longer had any hope of being fixed.
John took a deep breath. Hope was dangerous, she was right. Until now he had never let himself hope, because Sherlock was gone, and there was no bringing him back.
Sherlock’s eyes opened, slowly, and they were now a light, even grey, like the sea after a storm.
“If you can’t sleep,” John said, as if he was slow. “Or I could look in the emails to see if there’s another case, but honestly after that last one, I’m knackered. I could use a day or so to recuperate.”
“What?” John asked, striding quickly to keep up with him.
John looked completely shocked. “Leave?”
The girl stared at him for a long moment. “Considering I’m the one who’s dying, you seem a lot more depressed than I am,” the girl said bluntly, not answering his question. “Who died?”
“Your turn,” he whispered. He kissed down Sherlock’s torso until his head was even with Sherlock’s still-hard, leaking cock.
“Answer the question,” Sherlock interrupted.
“I know I didn’t say it last night but… I want… I want to be with you. Like this. I know you waited for me to be okay after…” he swallowed, feeling a tightness in his throat. “After. But… we can do this. I want to. You know that right?" John cleared his throat. Sherlock leaned back enough to meet his gaze.
“I had things perfectly under control," Sherlock huffed.
“John.” Sherlock couldn’t seem to find words, any words, to fill an entire sentence because nothing was going through his head anymore other than
John sighed, rubbing his eyes with one hand. Despite his attempts to stay away from Sherlock, here he was, back in the man’s flat. Not only that, but he was staying up all night and watching him sleep.
“When you’re alone. Do you, um, touch yourself?”
John frowned, but before he could prod her further, Lestrade and Molly appeared in front of him, coats on. “Okay, we’re off,” Lestrade said happily, his eyes only for Molly. “Happy Christmas, John.”
“Exactly.”
“Doctor Watson! I am such a fan of your blog. I used to read it religiously before you stopped posting as much,” he said, grinning as he shook John’s hand.
John stopped short. “No,” he said under his breath.
It was almost noon on a crisp fall day, but Sherlock still hadn’t emerged from his room. Sherlock had never been fond of lie-ins, so John decided to take advantage of the rare silence. He took out his laptop and created a blog entry for a case they had finished weeks ago but he hadn’t had time to write up yet.
“Doctor Watson—” Mr. Hatayama began.
Chi watched him for a long moment, then nodded very seriously. “Okay, here you go,” she said, handing him a red square of paper and taking a new one of her own.
Sherlock averted his gaze, suddenly feeling too naked to be having this conversation. He took the tangled top sheet and pulled it around his body.
John turned down Baker Street and walked up the well-worn, familiar steps, opening the door with his key.
“N-need to l-look for M-Moriarty,” Sherlock said, water dripping down his nose.
“We were being idiots,” he said simply.
Sherlock looked a bit affronted. “So what if I do?”
John finally got Sherlock’s trousers undone, and pushed them and his pants off and down to the floor. He had to stop for a moment, trailing his fingers down the expanse of skin, still feeling giddy. Sherlock was finally naked, underneath him, completely at his mercy; he trusted him,
“Sorry, sorry. I’ll stop,” John said.
They ran through it to another street, only to see the cab disappearing around another corner.
“Game?” John walked over to peek inside the enormous bathroom, which included a jacuzzi.
“Now, let’s continue. I believe that Professor Whipple left off with grand larceny, yes?”
Sherlock bit his bottom lip. “The…
The several people who were standing nearby stopped talking, looking at Sherlock.
Sherlock frowned, watching John with avid fascination. “Why pursue something if you don’t want it?”
There was nothing to confirm that they were in the right place other than the sign on the front, which proclaimed that “The Red Sox-Hatted League” had officially been disbanded.
“God, I love you,” he blurted out.
“Because you’re a student with a lot of debt.”
Sherlock was in the kitchen, his back to the entrance, carefully meting out tea leaves into the teapot. John leaned his head against the doorframe, as he often did, and watched. Sherlock’s eyelashes lowered as he poured the hot water into the teapot, his sinewy arms flexing beneath the bathrobe. It was so blessedly boring in its normality, Sherlock making tea.
