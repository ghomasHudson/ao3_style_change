Violet shook her head. “John is too close to the situation. He’s too emotional. It’d do him good to go with you. It’d get him out of his head for a little bit. And besides,” Violet got up to pour herself a cup of coffee just as the kettle boiled. “It’d do you two both good to work a case together. It’s been too long. You’re not the only one who’s been bored. John’s going to get pissed off if he keeps getting left behind or left in the dark.”
Sherlock looks at the phone and frowns. He types a response, the phone making a swooping sound when the message is sent.
John had started at their school almost a year before and had immediately been an instant hit with their peers. He was kind and friendly to everyone, including Sherlock, much to the boy's surprise. By the beginning of the next school year, John had been nominated captain of the rugby team and, combined with the fact that everyone liked him anyway, he had procured quite a bit of power amongst the student body. A power he had used to get Sebastian Wilkes and his half-wit friends off Sherlock's back. In return, Sherlock had helped John pass his Chemistry class.
“Good,” John breathed, pressing his groin into Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock pushed back slightly and held back a groan. John grazed his lips over Sherlock’s shoulder, “God, I can’t wait to fuck you.”
“Cheekbones.” He mumbled, his breathing steadying as he drifted out of consciousness. Sherlock’s mouth tweaked, and he placed a hand on John’s forehead, running his hands lightly through the grey hair. John roused slightly but did not awaken.
,” he tilts his head and studies Sherlock’s face, black eye and bruised chin prominent against the milky skin, “What aren’t you telling me?”
“Baker Street, actually.” John said. The cabbie nodded and changed course, turning down a street to the left. The sudden shift in direction make John’s stomach turn and he steadied himself with a long inhale.
“How the hell are we ever going to last for sex?” John laughed somewhat awkwardly, pressing the tip of nose to Sherlock’s. Sherlock’s eyes widened and he breathed out heavily.
Sherlock knows it’s late. The sky is dark, lightened slightly from the purple/pink hue of light pollution. London is quiet, or generally so. It’s never completely quiet in the city. He looks out the window, only having to turn his head slightly from its position on the arm of the couch.
“You’re an idiot,” John said, sitting up to look at Sherlock’s face, “I love you. I’ve always loved you. I love you more than I’ve ever loved anyone or anything and, listen, Sherlock,” John separated their hands and placed both of his on Sherlock's face, stroking both sides of his jaw with his thumbs, “You deserve to be loved and I swear if I ever find who made you feel that way about yourself I will
Sherlock's arms are pulled around him, pressing him hard and close, like they’re not close enough, even though there's not a millimeter of space between them. John thinks Sherlock would curl up inside him, wrap up in his body and stay there forever if he could. He wouldn't stop him.
“Has he… I mean, do you know if he’s…” John closed his eyes. There was no reason to be nervous about talking to his closest friend about this. He wasn’t in the closet, but he’d never explicitly said out loud that he was bisexual.
"And a chance to socialize with your schoolmates, to boot! C'mon, you're really saying this was at the top of your desired things to do for spring break?" John scoffed. Sherlock rolled his eyes and tilted his head.
The sun was rising as Sherlock ran his fingers through John’s hair, cool fingertips tracing temple to jaw with an enormous affection. His touch felt like home and everything wonderful.
John laughed at that, a quiet chuckle, but it was heavenly on Sherlock’s ears. He hadn’t heard that laugh in a while. His hand found John’s again as the ziti was set aside. His thumb stroked John’s wrists, swiping over his pulse over and over. He froze suddenly, causing John to frown.
Bill shrugged, or tried to, and shook his head, "I'm not meant for campin', John, it’s just not in my blood." He squirmed inside the material in an attempt to escape, but only managed to pull it tighter around him.
“How much longer?” John asked into Sherlock’s ear, following the words with a trace of his tongue at the back of his ear. Sherlock shivered minutely and almost dropped the slide he was holding. He swallowed, and John could feel him physically recompose himself.
"But it's snowing, Daddy! Papa loves snow!" She protested, her eyes glancing back down to Sherlock at the end of the statement. Sherlock chuckled; a deep, just-woke-up sort of laugh. John could just about melt at the sound of it. Sherlock lifted his head and put his hands in Rosie’s blonde curls, pulling her face closer to kiss her nose.
The longer John stares at him, the more set his expression becomes in his steely composure. His hands tighten around Sherlock’s and the detective watches his jaw clench, teeth grinding slowly.
“Are- are you sure? We haven’t done that before,” John whispered, heart beating with anticipation. Sherlock took a breath and nodded, gripping John’s arms tight. John chuckled, “I need you to actually say it, love.”
"Anything interesting?" John asked. Sherlock looked up at him as he sat down and folded the papers in his hands in half. He tucked them into his bag.
John watched and listened as Sherlock talked about his last case, a robbery, in great detail. His hands flew around in wild gestures and John tried his best not to look smitten as he saw Sherlock's eyes light up as he told the story.
“You know we’re not able to move right now. If ever.” Sherlock ran a hand through his curls and realized he needed to take a shower. He sighed, “Sell the house. Mum would’ve hated the idea of it sitting empty.”
So, imagine his disappointment when he arrived home fifteen minutes after his shift to an empty flat.
He snapped out of his reverie and noticed Sherlock looking at him. John shook his head and focused on the man holding his daughter softly in his arms.
John watched from the doorway, a smile slapped goofily on his face. He blew on his tea and then attempted to take a sip. He could not look away from the sight of the two. For the life of him, he could not figure out how he could love two separate people so much at once. How could his heart contain it? Surely one day it would just burst from being too full. He didn’t realize he was staring and did not notice his name being called.
Sherlock whispers, "It's okay, I'm okay," and reaches for John’s waist, pulling him close enough to press his cheek into John’s stomach. John’s hands automatically reach up and settle into Sherlock’s hair and he closes his eyes as Sherlock mumbles apologies into John’s shirt.
“Good,” John says and anger covers his features, his mouth becoming a thin line and his nose flaring subtly. His left had trembles slightly, but he doesn’t care enough to try and hide it, “You,” He pauses and watches Sherlock raise an eyebrow, “You. Utter. Bastard! You- you prick! How could you do that? How could you risk your life like that! The water is below freezing!”
“Doesn’t mean I want her to hear us,” John replied, “You’re loud, you know that? Not that I’m complaining.”
Sherlock sat down on the floor, watching John’s chest rise and fall. He noticed John’s phone still open to an unsent message and he reached forward to lock the device. He tilted his head as he read it, then pressed send, deleting the reply from John’s phone. Sherlock’s mobile lit up, indicating a new message had arrived. He dismissed the message then locked the phone, a smile tugging at his lips.
“Enoch Drebber?” Hope laughed then turned to pop in a Starbucks Anniversary blend K-Cup into the machine. As she pressed the lid down, she said, “You mean Dribbles, Mr. Can’t-Hold-His-Liquor? Of course I do, he was a riot. I loved him, how is he doing?”
Also, OK so I finally entered the 21st Century and now have a newer version of Office... and it formatting is messing with me, as you may have noticed here and there. I also can't figure out the "New and Improved" Review tab, so I feel like I'm missing a lot of my beta'er's comments and corrections. So if anyone notices any glaring errors, please let me know!
“Really?” Sherlock finally leaned over and turned on the lamp. Smirking as he studied John from mussed hair to bare toes then back up, stopping at his silly red pants, he asked, “You’d rather take care of your teeth rather than…?” languidly he waved his hand towards John’s crotch.
“Because I don’t want you to be fucking alone, OK? And if it can’t… since I can’t… I can’t leave Mary, so since it can’t be me, I want it to be
, about your ‘clever girl’,” John soldiered on. “That’s what you call her, don’t deny it, I’ve heard you call her that, many times. It’s your pet name for her.”
“Don’t,” Sherlock’s voice was a harsh and wounded thing. A fox cornered by hounds, a rabbit in a snare. “Don’t touch her.”
He shook his head. Then after taking a shuddering breath, said, “So. This is my life now. Dead army mate. Dead sister. Missing daughter. Wife’s up the duff again plus she’s an assassin who tried to kill my best friend… my best friend who solves crimes as an alternative to injecting cocaine and also just happens to be currently engaged to an American hiding from her own country. And we are all suffering because of my
Violet threw John a sour look. “I’m going to change,” she said in a snit, tugging the short skirt down as she stalked up to “John’s room”.
“I’m not most people,” John ran his hand down his face, feeling tired again. “Hey, Violet, I’ve got a full day ahead of me and it’s after two o’clock.”
“Nope,” Mary said as she parked the car. She unbuttoned her coat so she could pull her gun out in haste if necessary. She studied the figure by her front door. “Amateur,” she muttered.
She paused, her gloved hand on the stone archway. “He was a forger.” She looked over her shoulder, her eyes finally blazing with some emotion. “He helped my friend and others like her get out of the business and become civilians again.”
Not to be outdone, John slid one arm up Sherlock’s back while pulling him closer to him with the arm snaked around his narrow waist. Never breaking the kiss, John backed Sherlock into the wall and proceeded to snog him senseless. As he nibbled on his ear and laved his neck with long, teasing swipes of his tongue, he slipped his hand underneath his dress shirt, skimming his hand up the flat abdomen.
Mrs. Holmes knew that the cabbie meant Blind Mice, which meant ice. She always had a soft spot for Cockneys and their coded ways of speaking. She acknowledged his warning with a nod and shut the cab door gently.
“Too much baggage, Moll,” he sighed. “Remember, I knew them both before you started at Bart’s, back when Sherlock was still using. Mycroft was a condescending, unsupportive prick, but at the same time, Sherlock is an unrepentant addict when using and an arrogant sod when he’s not. They’ve always had a strained relationship as long as I’ve known them.”
“John, now? Now what?” Sherlock turned, confused. Then a second too late, he deduced Violet’s plan. “Don’t you dar-
“He’ll never say no because he can’t!” Violet cried out. She positively vibrated in anger. “God, this is so bloody
, slapping me around. Then I saw her reach into her pocket and take out those zip-tie things, well, I knew I had to get out of the car, whether it was moving or not. Thank God the car had stopped and she hadn’t locked the door…”
“No point, you confirmed Evie Payne-Ellis is not in the house. We’re going to investigate his Soho offices. Remember, he bought all those buildings, not just the one that houses his studio and office. Perfect place to hide a terrified girl and then murder her, don’t you think?”
But once I was in control of myself again, I was able to relegate  Victor to the proper lower level of my mind palace. I cannot delete him. I have tried. But he is too much of my past to erase completely from my mind.”
“You’re right, I didn’t,” Violet agreed amiably. “This was old fashioned detective work with a bit of good luck sprinkled on top. I know you burned the “Sara Govmux” alias the night you ran from the holiday flat in Montmartre, but,” Violet flipped the card over again. “You didn’t burn all of them, did you?”
“Violet…” John took a step forward but froze when Violet started surreptitiously shaking her head. Then she started making small shooing motions with her free hand.
Susan jerked her face out of John’s hands then buried her face into his chest, clutching the lapels of his black motorcycle jacket.  Sobbing inconsolably, she babbled, “Head… there’s a head, a
He decided to eat his fish before bringing up the next painful subject. He was glad he did, it was perfect, quite possibly the best piece of cod he had eaten in an age. Finally, he asked, “Do you… do you think we should tell Dad? About Mum?”
“That’s not necessary. I’m just going to go…” she faltered as a dull thudding started between her ears.
He also wasn’t foolish enough to try for any hostile takeover of territory. He was an old man, the last of his kind, the last Don of Chicago. He was content to rule his own kingdom but at the same time, willing to ruthlessly defend it.
Julia still inched her way towards Violet’s gun. “To try and talk me out it, Moriarty said you were more inclined to mind-games than violence.”
“Don’t give me your false sympathy,” she sneered. “Maybe I haven’t figured out your endgame yet, but you always have one, Victor. You’re a snake in the grass. Slippery, slithery bastard you are and whatever you’re playing at, I want nothing from it. Call it off. Now. I’ll pay Holmes what I owe him this past week and next, but it’s over Victor,” and she rang off.
She was theirs. She was no longer “Lucy Doe”, a little girl lost in the system, but now was legally Lucinda Kay Ferrier and she belonged to them.
She nodded, breaking out in a cold sweat now. “Apologies, excuse me,” she mumbled, staggering to her feet. “Stone,
Violet however nearly tripped on the hem of her dress. She and Sherlock had gotten into epic arguments in the past about her wearing his clothes.
,” Violet narrowed her eyes at Mycroft, letting the last name sink in. “If that meant she could get her daughter back.”
“No,” Sherlock did not turn around. He kept his eyes on the interview room, monitoring Julia Stoner. “Jim Moriarty.”
John devoutly hoped Sherlock would never deduce the truth, or the version of the truth John had received from Mycroft…
“You’ve lost weight,” she immediately deflected. She knew the best way to stave off a brutal deduction was to nip it in the bud before it blossomed. A trick she had learned from John.
John scowled up at Sherlock as Violet rolled her eyes. “Vos, in short, was just a pain in the ass. Born Dutch, but she was no Mata Hari. She had no affinity and no loyalty to any faction or nation. She dealt mostly in secrets. Got cozy with her sources, sucked as much information out of them as possible and either threatened to blackmail them or sell them. It was all about the money. She was basically an Irene Adler, only without the fucking.”
“Something about him frightened you that day, not just normal unease. You were properly scared of him that day you met him in the café, Violet,” Sherlock massaged her temples with his thumbs. “’Something deep inside of me screamed that without a doubt and without a shred of evidence… there was something seriously wrong with this young man.’ That is precisely what you told John Watson. What did you see, Violet? You know I don’t believe in gut instinct or sixth sense or any of that claptrap. You may think you just have ‘funny feelings’ about bad situations, but that’s not because of any psychic phenomenon. It is simply because you have a higher emotional intelligence than most people, including me and my brother. You
“Obvious. Each of the  three victims was  slowly burned, starting from her toes and roasting her all the way up to the top of her head. If you two would have truly studied the autopsy photographs, you both surely would have observed that.”
she thought, steeling herself for the repercussions. She would either get a tongue-lashing or the silent treatment from The Great Detective. Part of her hoped he would start an argument with her. At least she could fight back, remind him that he even said Victor was a distraction… and John and Violet just needed more information to protect Sherlock, to keep Victor from distracting him.
The locals nervously joked about Giuoco “Papa Bella” Bellucci being a mob boss. For starters, he just looked too cute to be a
“Don’t be so sure, they’re going through a rough patch at the moment. He might send you a thank-you card if you bump her off.”
Mycroft pushed his diary and pen away from him. He leaned back into his expensive chair again and tapped his fingertips together. In his mind, he saw his rook moving into the Check position on a chessboard. “Dr. Scott videotaped her sessions with Sherlock.”
John shot Sherlock a filthy look. “OK, fine. I found something and I think it’s important. Violet said that Rucastle had created a jewelry line for some American big-box retail chain, right?”
Mycroft idly wondered how his little brother would react if he found out that Maud Andrea S. Bellamy Holmes had a higher IQ than both Sherlock and Mycroft.
After John pinned the flower to Sherlock’s chest (after threatening him with impalement if he cracked one stupid joke about it), he leaned against the wall, watching Sherlock take the violin out of its case, resting it on his shoulder. It always amazed him how that complicated contraption made from wood and wire looked like a natural part of Sherlock’s body.
“So our killer is just a lazy fucker who outsources the kidnapping and dumping?” Violet asked skeptically.
and I only know how to con-con-conjugate verbs in the present tense,” William whined, not comprehending that what he had learned in three days many people couldn’t accomplish in three months.
Sherlock held the memory stick up and John saw the logo “iStick” on it. “New-ish product. Came out last year. Thumb-drive that has both a USB connector and,” he slide a button on the memory stick. The USB connector  retracted on one side and a Lightening connector appeared on the other, “The compatible iPad or iPhone jack. Should be fine,” and with that, he lifted his heavy brows at John, clearly waiting for John to fetch the iPad.
So he merely looked away from John and fixed his eyes on the dead cat again. But he reached out to grasp John on the shoulder just as a drowning man clings to a buoy for dear life.
“Oh, so he admitted it to you,” Irene sat up, sea glass eyes shining with interest. “So much for not kissing and telling, but since he did,” she leaned forward. “Want to compare notes?”
Once the waitress was gone, Sherlock tore open two sugar packets. As John added milk to his coffee, Sherlock murmured, “Harriet certainly knows your pressure points.”
“I can pose as my sister. Visit Baker Street and ask him for his help. He’d believe me, especially since my stupid twin already went to the Watsons seeking The Great Detective’s help.”
While Anthea had been plodding back to her car, Noelie had indeed ducked into the closest coffee shop, her heart pounding so loud, she felt it echoing in her head. Her escape had depended on her reaching this destination.
Violet’s mouth dropped open. Then she clamped it shut as she nodded. “Makes sense and he got away with it too because like you said, he was… is flamboyant and ruthless. It would be easy for Richard to hide his crazy while pretending to be his twin brother. ”
“Better hurry,” John said. “He left my wedding early. Right after… the waltz.” Worry flickered in his eyes as he blinked his eyes owlishly, struggling to sober up, remembering what happened after his wedding… “I better come with you, actually.”
“Not much manhandling in a pleasant business like that at all,” poison dripped from Sherlock’s tongue as he glowered at Mason.
Anthea did not become the personal assistant to The British Government because she was a stupid woman. She bloody damn well knew who Agent Hunter and AGRA were. She believed every single word of Violet and Mary’s threats. Anthea was more than willing to let them skulk around the Holmes’ manor today. They’d be back in London tomorrow. They had to come back tomorrow. Agent Hunter was Sherlock’s ward and AGRA was Dr. Watson’s wife. They would go looking for them. And when Sherlock looks for someone, chances are good he would find them.
“Harry,” John took a breath. “Our childhood wasn’t perfect but it wasn’t terrible either. And I hated how Dad and his side of the family treated you after you came out, you know that. I defended you, I always defended you, I still do,” his voice was soft now.
Sherlock watched her shuffle away with furrowed brows and his lips tilted down. He was glad he ate lightly today. His stomach had dropped to his knees.
She checked her watch. The other rooms wouldn’t require as much attention as a bathroom did. Just a good wipe-down and vacuuming, then deposit the vacuum bag and garbage bag into the dumpster. Then she’d take a shower. Wipe the tub down again while making sure there was no hair in the drain. Change into fresh clothes and call Uber. She’d take one more bag of trash to the dumpster and not look back.
Lestrade closed those warm chocolate eyes for just a second. When he reopened them, they were bright and damp. “Christ, mate,” he choked out, keeping his hand on Sherlock’s forehead, as if checking Sherlock for a fever.
Mary put her arm around the girl and led her back towards the bar. A few men who had been loitering in front of the door met them halfway there. Choruses of “What the hell?” and “Should we call 999?” echoed around them.
Bodley watched her heft herself out of her seat and waddle over to the peg where a sky-blue cardigan with purple polka dots hung. As Molly put it on, she asked, “Did you need something?”
When there was no response, he let himself in and closed the door behind him. Sherlock was curled up under the thin hospital duvet, IVs inserted, cardiac monitor beeping in rhythm with his heart. John pulled up a chair as close as possible to the bed then whispered, “Sherlock?”
Sherlock sat serenely in Detective Inspector Lestrade’s office, his fingers tented and with his usual smug “I Am Better at Everything” expression plastered on his face.
Still reclined, eyes still closed, Sherlock muttered, “’They always fill me with a certain horror. It is my belief… founded upon my experience, that the lowest and vilest alleys in London do not present a more dreadful record of sin that does the smiling and beautiful countryside.’ **” He paused. “Or seaside, in our case.”
Violet ignored him, of course. She trotted after him, calling his name. When she reached him, she grabbed the back of his parka. “John, goddamn it, it’s not what you think!”
“First of all, saw this at the news agents’ when I went for my run this morning,” he reached for the tabloid on the coffee table and held it up to Sherlock. “Congratulations.”
Victor carefully set his nearly empty tumbler on the coffee table and approached Sherlock. “What are you saying?”
“Yeah,” he huffed, taking her hand. He kept Mary’s hand in a death-grip from the moment they walked into the church for the service, until they went  out to the cemetery to the burial, then back to the church for coffee and little cakes.
John laughed bitterly. “What do I want? I want… I want things to go back to the way they were. I want it to be you and me against the world. I want to go
“What?” Sherlock asked, his breath catching as he realized how close they were. He could feel John’s breath on his chin and could smell the alcohol on his breath. John dropped his hands and rolled onto his back, closing his eyes slightly.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock. For putting you through this.” John said after a few moments of silence. Sherlock groaned quietly, as he had done all the previous times this particular subject had risen.
“I’ll do that. Thanks, Mrs. Hudson,” John looked toward the stairs and eyed the package sitting innocently on the second step. It didn’t look big enough to hold a head, which was a miracle all on its own.
"Sherlock?" The man in question doesn't move, but emits a small grunt. John would usually roll his eyes, but he’s too focused on other things to be bothered by Sherlock’s antics, "Sherlock, I-"
When no reply came after ten minutes, John resigned to make himself a cup of tea and stand against the counter while glancing unsurely at Sherlock’s experiment on the table. It was a rather shocking shade of pink. John decided he didn’t want to know.
John clears his throat, the hesitancy obvious. Sherlock, apparently, finds this slightly worth the effort of opening his eyes and shifting his glance to the doctor. He searches John's face, his eyes lighting up with intrigue at his sheepish, anxious expression.
"We can still hear you, guys," Lestrade says as he gets in his car, and Sherlock laughs at the look on John's face. John, on his part, just decides to walk faster toward the road and waves down a cab.
"My parents thought I needed to get out of London for a bit," Sherlock said matter of factly, and then pushed past John, making his way to the stack of books near Mr. Dimmock's tent, effectively ending their conversation. John stared at him as he walked away. Sherlock bent down to flip through one of the texts while John did
"Very well-articulated," Sherlock replies, raising an arm over his head, the other settling around John's shoulder, "But I concur."
"What?" John asked, shifting slightly onto his better leg. Sherlock looked at him curiously, but eyes shone brightly nonetheless.
When Sherlock eventually made his way back to the hospital room, John was lying on his back in the bed, eyes closed. He was half-asleep if the rise and fall of his chest were to be believed. Sherlock took a deep breath before entering the room, setting down the paper sack on the table at the end of the bed, just as John’s eyes blinked open slowly and lazily.
“Alright. Whatever gets you off. Literally. Well, both of us I suppose-” Sherlock smiled and let his words be wiped away as John shut him up with lips pressed firmly against his.
Just as John got Bill free, Mr. Dimmock clapped his hands together and told everyone to head over to the fire ring.
"It's not a fix-all," John says eventually, staring forward in the direction of the sink. Sherlock turns to him, but John doesn’t let him speak just yet, "You can’t just say I love you and expect everything to be fine."
“Ah- John…” He moaned, and his hips moved responsively. John’s hand loosened slightly on Sherlock’s back and his face pulled back to look at the blush running up Sherlock's neck to his ears and cheeks.
“Yes, John and I have a very healthy sex life,” Sherlock says, and John shuts his eyes in mortification.
"You were up late. Go back to sleep." John whispered, pushing Sherlock back down and pulling the duvet back over his shoulders. Sherlock tried to stop him but was caught in a yawn during the attempt.
“Shut up! Just, shut up, Sherlock.” And he must be doing something right with his tone because Sherlock does, in fact, shut up. John’s breath catches and he has to blink back tears as he continues, “That was… That was before, wasn’t it? Before this. Us. God, Sherlock, if losing you was hard before, I can’t imagine… I wouldn’t be able to… how could you? How could you…” He’s losing his angry energy and his voice fades out to a whisper.
John stands on one side of the kitchen table, holding a mug of tea mid-passage to his lips. Sherlock blinks at him, eyes wide, both hands still and unmoving at his sides. He looks like he can't believe the words that have escaped his mouth, flabbergasted, really. At the same time, however, he seems fractionally relieved, like a weight had been released from his shoulders.
Much to John's surprise, Sherlock is very verbal with his affections, and repeats them any time the words cross his mind. Which is quite often.
“Are you going to try this time?” Sherlock’s voice was quiet and tight. John looked away and bit his lip. Sherlock sighed and leaned away slightly. “I’m meeting Mycroft today. I’ll be back in a few hours, dinner time at the latest.” He pressed a kiss to John's temple before pulling away and throwing on his coat.
“Flu’s going around,” John mumbled. Suddenly, he lifted his head and squinted at Sherlock, “You got your shot, right?”
John, surprised at the suddenness, choked at the length of Sherlock’s cock forced further into his mouth and the come trying to shoot down his throat. His eyes watered a bit as he pulled back, and Sherlock shook under him, finishing against his mouth and chin.
“What did he say?” John asked, feeling his ears burn hot at the last time he had seen Lestrade – visions of ambulances and Lestrade’s amused smile dancing in his mind. Molly bit her lip.
, yes-" Sherlock's voice is somehow quiet and loud at the same time, quick breaths blowing into John's ear. His fingertips press crescents into John's shoulder and in return John resists the compulsion to bite into Sherlock's neck.
“Okay, not gonna ask how you know that, but that’s something to take into consideration, yeah? And what about us, in general? Are we in a relationship, not in a relationship, exclusive, not exclusive? It needs defining.”
– there’s no need to rush,” John found that his speech was falling on deaf ears as Sherlock worked at his neck. John put his hands in Sherlock’s hair and tugged a bit, pulling Sherlock’s lips up to his own.
Sherlock was pulled from his thoughts as a heavy weight settled across his entire body. He blinked his eyes open, but his vision was mostly obscured by sandy grey hair.
, yes," John lets the grey sheets of paper fall to the ground and stands up, bumping Sherlock slightly with his chest. He doesn’t care though, because instantly his lips are pressed against Sherlock's and he can feel a hand being placed tentatively on his neck.
“John,” Sherlock breathed, watching John lick his lips slowly, his tongue dragging along his swollen mouth. John leaned in again, then, caressing Sherlock’s tongue with his own. The hand behind the detective’s back circled around to the front of his pajama bottoms and John’s middle finger ran underneath the waistband.
“That was incredibly hot,” he whispered. Sherlock groaned and moved his other hand from John’s head so he could cover his entire face.
This opened a whole new door that John wasn’t quite sure he was ready to go through. Was this a hint from Sherlock? Was Sherlock ready to take that next step? Was John? John’s experience with sex was largely with women, and really, how much of that would transfer over? What experience did Sherlock have with sex, if any?
A few days after Sherlock's proclamation of love, John is staring at the detective as he falls onto the sofa in a post-case sulk. He's watching Sherlock's fingers twitch as his forearm covers his eyes, the white knuckles shifting minutely.
John spent the time that Sherlock was working daydreaming about where that morning’s activities had been headed. His hands kneading into Sherlock’s bum, Sherlock squirming and moaning underneath him, the sudden pleasure of their cocks touching-
They scrambled to get their pants off, flinging them onto the floor in a careless heap. John pulled Sherlock back down and then, in a move that Sherlock found immensely arousing, flipped them so John was holding Sherlock down against the bed.
“I’ve been here for five weeks, I’ve had enough.” John sighed, looking over at Sherlock. For a man in his upper 50’s, he still looked frustratingly young, if you ignored the mostly grey hair. Well, even then, the grey hair seemed to work for him. He looked tired, though. “Did you go home last night?”
“Almost done,” Sherlock replied, his voice deep and purposefully steady. John grinned and spread his hands over Sherlock’s chest, rubbing his left nipple through his shirt. He pressed a wet kiss to Sherlock’s neck, sucking just enough to leave a light mark.
There was, indeed, a discussion forum open on John’s computer when he entered the living room. A few sentences caught his eye, namely a few blurbs on practical amounts of lube and prostate stimulation, to which John was both turned on and uncomfortable with.
Later, John remembers the rough glide of wool against his fingertips as he reached for Sherlock’s waist, the material slipping from his hands before he could get a hold.
“Y-yes,” Sherlock’s voice was strangled and he was certainly coming undone, “Oh, god, fuck me, John- Oh, god, oh god, oh god-“
Lestrade barks orders at a few subordinates before turning back to the pair. He pauses, mouth open slightly as he watches Sherlock unconsciously put his hand on the small of John’s back.
He’s halfway out of the car before it’s even in park, Lestrade’s yell pushed to the back of John’s mind. He’s quickly assessing Sherlock as he approaches, noting that while he has a cut on his forehead that is being tended to by an EMT, he mostly just looks annoyed. He looks okay. He’s breathing, he’s rolling his eyes, he’s
They've had fights before. Hell, most of their flat-share, friendship, and relationship is composed of bickering and pointed comments. Somehow, and not surprisingly, this is different.
“Joh-!” Sherlock gripped the arm of the sofa near his head and arched his back involuntarily, “Fu- I don’t think I’m… going to… Ah! Last…”
Sherlock’s mouth tasted like salty tears and coffee, and John only wanted more of him. He wanted every laugh, every smile, every cry, and shout, and everything in between. He wanted to devour Sherlock’s entire being and know every last piece of him. It was amazing that even now, even after all these years, John could still feel this way. That he could ache with want and love, even when he already had it. It was a gift that he could barely allow himself to believe.
John froze and pulled back, searching Sherlock’s face. He traced Sherlock’s cheekbone with his thumb.
“It could be about the case,” Sherlock defended, blinking down at him for a moment before glancing back to the mobile. John kept his fingers inside of Sherlock, attempting to get him back to the writhing and begging he had been at a few seconds ago. He saw Sherlock’s eyes widen and felt smug for a moment until Sherlock sat up quickly, pushing John’s hand away.
They fall into a regular routine of ‘I love you’s and neither of them can be bothered to realize how swiftly and strangely their relationship has shifted.
“Nope, no,” John shook his head and reached for the door handle, “I’m not having this conversation. Go be an over-protective arsehole somewhere else.”
It's a normal occurrence, and John's not even surprised when he looks at the clock and it's barely 5:30. That doesn’t make the early hour any easier to face, however.
John leaned away with a wary expression and swallowed, pressing his hand into the sofa cushion near Sherlock’s shoulders, “I was just joking, we don’t have to… I mean, I would like to, but it’s absolutely okay if… I’m not saying we will-“
His lips brush lightly against the detectives, soft for a moment and then suddenly desperate, his hands finding the sides of Sherlock's head. His fingers push into dark curls and a sigh is released between them, and he's not sure which one of them it came from.
“Sloan is in custody, and I’m fine. See?” Sherlock sits up and spreads out his arms to show his point. John closes his eyes and breathes out heavily through his nose before stepping back to the bed and leaning down to Sherlock until their foreheads are touching. Sherlock blinks slowly and gives a smug grin, “Good day at the surgery?”
"I'm sorry," Sherlock whispers, placing a hand on John's knee, which only causes the doctor to glance down and stare at the hand before Sherlock removes it. It's a rarity, for sure, for Sherlock to give an apology, but it's warranted. John holds the phone up to his chin and tries to hold back his stinging tears.
He turned back to the package, lifting it with one arm as he made his way up the stairs, wondering what the hell he was missing.
Lestrade coughs lightly and shuffles his feet, "So, this is happening, now, is it?" He looks slightly uncomfortable, but mostly amused and relieved. Sherlock rolls his eyes.
“Are you just going to keep your hands there or are you going take my pants off?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. John growled and pushed the material down over the curve of his arse.
They don't necessarily try to keep their relationship secret, but it’s also nice to not have the public eye pressed up against a new relationship, so virtually no one knows. John thinks of mentioning it on his blog, his fingers typing the words, only to hold his middle finger over the backspace, leaving the document blank once again.
“Turnip? That’s a new one,” John said as Sherlock pushed the rolling table further up the bed and opened a container of ziti, placing a fork down beside it. He looked up from the proceedings directly as Sherlock. “I know what you’re doing. You don’t have to do it.”
“You’re upset.” His expression was a mask of confusion as he looked between John and the cleaner-than-usual room.
Sherlock feels John's hand slip into his and a sudden calm washes over him. His eyes turn to the shorter man and he can’t think anything except
By the time John walked through the door of the living area of the flat, he was right exhausted, a fact that thoroughly made him resent his useless legs. He fell down onto the couch and let his cane fall along with him. The doctor glared at the offending object for a moment before he lifted his eyes to take in the familiar room.
“May I?” John asked into Sherlock’s mouth. Sherlock nodded quickly and groaned as John’s finger danced over the crease of his pelvis.
"Not necessarily-" John started, though in a split second, the cup was removed from his hands and pressed against Sherlock's lips. The detective took a sip, then grimaced, handing the ceramic dishware back to John.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock placed the lilacs in his hands on the ground in between the two gravestones, “Mum, Dad.” The two brothers stood in silence for a while, lost in their own thoughts. Eventually, Mycroft broke the eerie quiet.
After they’ve cleaned up, both from injuries and, well, more recent activities, John nods at Sherlock once before opening the ambulance door.
"Me as well," Sherlock said, standing up and brushing off his trousers. He hesitated and watched John stand. They hovered there for a moment before John broke the silence.
John squinted at a lump of tent material squirming a distance away and frowned, "Oi! You need help?"
For a while, they forget they’re in an ambulance, just feet away from NSY’s finest, and they can’t help the burgeoning arousal that hand in the air (and their pants). John rolls his hips and their erections rub against each other through layers of pants and trousers, causing both men to gasp.
John laughed into Sherlock’s neck and sighed, “Everyone knows entirely too much about our sex life, don’t they?”
“God, Sherlock… You’re amazing.” John breathed and he looked down at their melded bodies, “Tell me when.”
Sherlock paused and placed a hand on John’s neck, bringing their faces closer together, “I only want you, John. If that makes us partners, boyfriends, exclusive, that’s fine. It’s only you.”
John groans and rolls away, shoving his face deep into a pillow. He's delighted to note that Sherlock crawls back on the bed, placing his hands on either side of John's body and resting his chin on his shoulder.
"But... The snow..." Sherlock mumbled, his eyes closing slowly. John placed a hand on his cheek and caressed his jawline softly.
“John! Oh, fu-fuck, yes,“ Sherlock babbled, his hands sliding through the sweat on John’s back. John gripped Sherlock’s arms to hold him down. He watched as Sherlock’s pupils dilated slightly and smirked.
"Needs sugar." He said. John rolled his eyes, though was careful to avoid Rosie's gaze - he was not fond of the idea of her catching onto that habit.
“Delete it? I can’t delete it. Everything about you is important.” Sherlock frowned and ran his hand over John’s good shoulder. John looked up once again and studied Sherlock’s serious expression.
“Where did I put the key? I know I had it-“ Sherlock frowned as John shoved his hand into Sherlock’s coat pocket and pulled out the key to the flat. He gave John a disapproving look, to which John rolled his eyes and limped over to the door and slid the key into the lock. Sherlock eyed his back from the sidewalk before John turned to see if he was following. The doctor squinted at him and tilted his head.
Sherlock was a sight to behold, his hair in disarray and his cheeks flushed red from the cold. He pulled his coat off and hung it up before stepping closer to John and pulling the teacup from his hands.
"Papa." A voice whispered as Sherlock felt the weight climb over his legs and settle onto the middle of the bed. Something, a hand he guessed, was placed on his shoulder, gently shaking it. "Papa, are you awake?"
They climb into Lestrade’s cruiser and as they make their way back onto the main road, John can hear his heartbeat in his ears, loud and harsh and grounding. He taps his fingers on the seat beside his thighs as they near the flashing lights of another police car and an ambulance.
Groans from the far bed made everyone stop and look. John was stirring, he shouldn’t be, he was still on the propofol drip meant to keep him asleep. Mummy stood from where she was still on Sherlock’s bed and went to him, as Molly carefully made her way to check his IVs.
Sherlock pulled him close and held him as the sobs rocked his body. It was a hard cry, a violent cry. John buried his face deep into Sherlock’s chest. After a few minutes he moved his head so that his ear rested on Sherlock’s chest so he could hear his heartbeat. He took a deep breath.
“Your brother became a drug addict who wouldn’t let anyone close” John hollered “You sister grew up thinking her family was dead and always feeling like she was missing part of herself. Sherlock believed her dead and it nearly killed him as he sunk into drugs.”
“Damn those pictures you sent did not do you justice.” Jim said leaning down and kissing Sebastian’s stomach and abs.
“Poor Molly, she’s had a broken heart so many times, mostly because of you, especially because of you. You treated her so horribly, but then again that’s how superstars treat groupies isn’t it. Then when she finally found someone he as you predicted turned out to be the world best criminal mastermind Jim Moriarty.” Eurus said as Molly started making her tea. “But she’s found love. Brodie is such a wonderful guy, such a highly decorated former military man. I have nor anyone in my network has ever met him but Molly doesn’t know that. Let’s break her heart again shall we. Let’s convincer her that her fiancé, the love of her life, is just another plant but someone out to get you.”
Anthea put a second pack of ice on the edge of the leg by the desk, and then went to the other desk to try and see if she could get back on the network and get help.
Their life was non-stop. This past week in the hospital since waking up (after being unconscious for three) was the longest Sherlock had even been in one place for longer than a few days.
“I remember my childhood, I remember you all. I just don’t remember the days leading up to you trying to kill me.” Willa responded. “I remember the tea cakes and scones with honey at tea time. Mum always flustered that Mycroft wanted so much sugar in his tea, Mum and Dad taking us to the water to play. You were always welcome to play but you never wanted to.”
“That’s Sherlock, our little ray of Sunshine” Mycroft said giving a curt smile. Sherlock just again glared.
She had given him warning that Moran was angry. It was a text never sent though. They found it in the drafts of a phone found smashed in the office area of the hotel.
She was sweet and a bit shy, worried sometimes that she was saying the wrong thing. But she made Brodie smile.
"We were investigating Victor Trevor for drug trafficking and it led us here right into all of this." DS. Lestrade replied.
Sherlock ran his tongue along the length of johns neck and up behind his ear. He nipped at John’s ear before leaning the man back and kissing him.
“They were careful with you, they still need you, and Mr. Lestrade, and me. We’re part of the audience.” Willa said looking past John at Greg. You and I are here for Sherlock, Mr. Lestrade for Mycroft. They’re my brothers.”
Irene figured she was most surprised by Willa’s reaction. Perhaps Eurus was looking for an ally in her campaign against Sherlock and Mycroft. She didn’t find it. Instead Sherlock and Mycroft gained an ally. Yes Willa was mad at Mycroft and their Uncle Rudy for keeping her from her family growing up. But she understood where they were coming from in regards to Sherlock’s mental health. Willa instead was mad a Eurus, after all it was her big sister that nearly killed her.
“Well, it will be quiet at crimes scenes for a while anyway.” Sally gave a small smile. She may have called Sherlock a freak now and again, but in all honesty, he was a huge help. She just wished he wasn’t so arrogant about it.
The walls were charred and even after all these years the smell of burnt fibers hung in the air, now mixed with the smell of dampness and decay. The upstairs was worse than the downstairs; the fire was of course started in her bedroom. Most of the accelerant she made sure to coat the wall between her and Sherlock’s bedroom. Sherlock unfortunately wasn’t in his room. He was curled up in the living room with Mummy.
“We’re going to transplant him to the hospital. The bullet entered his lower chest and looks like he had a collapsed lung, the tube is working a bit but there might be an injury to his diaphragm.” The Medic explained as John was loaded on to the medical helicopter that had landed.
Despite everything, despite all that he had been through and the trials he knew he had yet to endure, he was still Sherlock Holmes.
“Ha,” Mycroft straightened and stared down his nose at her, every inch the English Aristocrat. “I don’t make stupid decisions.”
Having resumed her texting, Anthea’s eyes were locked onto the tiny screen of her Blackberry as she added, “Or Mycroft might, if he makes MI-6 wait.”
“What a lovely new television you have, Dr. Watson. A Smart TV, is it not?” he turned it on. When I was a boy, there were three channels. Now, you can stream any television show you want. You can even surf on the Internet with your televisions,” he scrolled through the menu until he found what he was looking for, “Amazing, it really is, all this technology.”
However the one person she could not get a clear read on was the well-dressed, thin man with the receding hairline standing in her room. She doubted anyone could fully work him out, discover what made him tick. Churchill’s infamous quote about “A riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma,” was meant to describe Russia but it suited Mycroft Holmes much better.
“It’s his building,” Sherlock intoned. “And the next three right down this street. So who knows what additional horrors we may find there?”
he cares about the baby, just not in the way we want him to care about the baby. He’s never going to love Henry as a dad, of course not. That’s
“I’m the one who’s still sick, why I am ordering?” Violet reminded him but Sherlock had drifted off towards the window and his violin. “Jackass,” she muttered as she reached for his laptop.
But her fingerprints and her DNA had been found at places of interest. Not necessarily places that could be considered crime scenes. But rather the homes and offices of powerful people who had resigned in disgrace after a tabloid had published an embarrassing article.
“Well, if George Lucas can alter a well-known and loved film to have that silly green alien shoot first instead of the anti-hero, then yes, we can re-write the past,” Mycroft sounded more like his smarmy self and John found himself wanting to punch him again.
“That means the basement,” Wiggins tried to sound nonchalant. “That’s where the girl’s gotta be at, yeah?”
She would be exhausted by now. Fatigue caused stupid errors after all… he pondered the possibilities for a moment then shook his head, recalling that she had been trained to keep her wits together under extremely stressful situations, which included sleep deprivation.
“You have a laptop. I know, because I had to return it to you last September when Sherlock nicked it from you in an effort to get you to come over and talk to him.” Violet leaned forward, rested her chin in her hand while drummed the nails of her other hand on his desk. “So why can’t you work on your report at home?” She continued to stare at him, almost as if she were bored and was waiting for something interesting to happen.
It's the deep breath before the plunge... some feels, some angst, maybe a little smut since the last chapter was a bit sad...
Twenty minutes later, he got his wish. His head lolled onto his shoulder, he slipped into sweet unconsciousness as the BBC anchorman nattered on about the rotten state the world was in.
“Come on. Let’s go placate your mother. Then I’ll make some excuse for you so you can sneak off for a little sleep before your brother gets here.”
“Of course it’s about the money! Why else did you make a deal with that bastard! I’m not staying here while my children are in jeopardy!”
He wrote “Hand weakness or clumsiness” on his list then grabbed one of the books. He knew some of the younger patrons stared at him openly now, wondering why he used such ancient techniques such as Reading A Book, instead of Googling.
John heard the sound of a coffee mug and then a plate being placed on the nice wood table. “Ta, miss,” John mumbled, not even opening his eyes.
“Oh, come off it, the game is over. You’re a disgraced American federal agent. You’ve been hiding behind the Great Detective’s coat all these months.”
. First friend, first love, first relationship, first heartbreak… this wasn’t just some forgotten fling. Victor’s definitely a trigger.”
“It happened,” Sherlock’s voice was tiny. “John, I’m not deleting that.” John opened his eyes just in time to see Sherlock produce the smallest of smiles. “I couldn’t, even if I tried.” Then he cleared his throat, “But if you need to pretend it didn’t happen, that’s… understandable.”
“Nonsense,” Mrs. Toller snapped. “I’ve seen what you do to your hair on a daily basis plus I do Mrs. Rucastle’s face and hair when she goes out.”
Violet grabbed one of her curls and sniffed. She always just used Sherlock’s shampoo, partially not to set off his olfactory hypersensitivity and partially to be a brat since he always whinged about her nicking his things. His shampoo smelt clean, like fresh laundry drying in the sunshine.
"John, I-" Sherlock doesn't know what to say, finding himself in the unfamiliar territory of feeling genuinely remorseful. John shakes his head, pulling himself up from his chair. Sherlock watches as he pulls on his coat, "Where are you going?"
"Alright, you sarcastic git, I'm coming," John said, jogging over to untangle Bill from the tent. He pulled at some of the poles, but Bill only seemed to get lost further under the tarp, "Christ, mate, how'd you even do this?"
He can feel Sherlock's eyes on him. The heat of his gaze raises the hair on his neck. He vaguely notices the detective moving toward him in his periphery, and eventually, his body blocks the light from the window and casts a shadow over the newspaper.
“Young man, your father is going to hear about thi-OW!” Violet snatched her hand away after Edward bit her and ran away, darting into a wardrobe and shutting the door.
Cemetery, tonight. No matter what else happens, you must not delay, you must go. Immediately,” She lowered her voice, “Before
Sherlock shut that line of thinking down at once then threw the mobile into the sea. He watched the mobile skip across the waves, then float for a bit before finally sinking away. He felt a tiny pinch in his miniscule heart at the idea of being temporarily cut off from John, but the mobile was compromised. He wouldn’t even risk having Lisbeth research the origin of the text and gif. By that time, the messages had malware or viruses or Trojan Horses embedded in them.
John couldn’t place his finger on it, but something had definitely… shifted since The Copper Beaches.
As if he hadn’t been afraid before, the panic finally reached its crescendo as John’s imagination spiraled out of control. Recollections of horrors he had witnessed in Afghanistan bled into memories of The Fall and the aftermath of Sherlock being shot, producing fantastical horrors of his own imaginings of what could be happening to Sherlock
Instead of answering him, Sherlock said, “Kitty lost everything when we won the libel court case Mycroft insisted on pursuing after I officially returned from my Great Hiatus. She got sacked and no other media outlet would touch her. She had no money, lost her flat and had to move back in with her parents. She became desperate. So she started stalking me in order to get a picture of me and Violet together, to sell it to the tabloids in order to recoup her financial losses.” Sherlock shook his head and stuffed his mobile back into his coat pocket. “Stupid, repellant woman, she lost more than her flat and life savings because of her folly, she lost her life.”
Wiggins immediately picked up on the tension. “Right. So, luggage,” he said, scurrying off to help Sherlock and Mary.
They caught up with Chibs and they all started walking with real haste. No one spoke as they ran down the stairs, not risking the elevator this time. Violet’s heart rate ramped up as all their footsteps echoed in the narrow stairwell. As they re-entered the immense garage where fire engines used to reside, they skirted the sadly departed Chester-the-Molestor-mobile.
“Ahhhhh…. Of course,” Mycroft saw the whole picture now. “Since she had been unable to give state’s evidence against Woodhouse-”

“Had to refinance it, the last time your father got in trouble,” Anna whispered. “The mortgage is more than the house’s worth.”
“Have a sleep,” she kissed his brow. “I’m sorry we quarreled. Can we talk about it later? Actually talk, not fight?” she pleaded.
When Sherlock sheepishly nodded again, Victor grinned “You’re always surprising me, Sherlock. Just when I think I’ve got you figured out…”
John and Sherlock flanked Dupin. John could now clearly see the name inscribed in the stone: Marie Arnaudine Rogêt. There were some other words, but they were all in French. The date of birth and date of death were covered up by a rather fat stray cat, sunning himself, purring.
Sherlock had scoffed, deeming the case a “Negative-Three”, but John had pleaded with him to take the case.
But she found herself regretting not visiting the Serpentine before. To her, it seemed very pretty. Maybe the natives had different opinions, but she definitely liked it.
“Fine, yeah, OK,” Violet waved his demand off, more annoyed than confused at his non sequitur. She pushed an errant chestnut wisp off her forehead. “So your hacker buddy-”
, shares in an American insurance company that wanted to compete in the global market, preferring to start in English-speaking countries. But England has national health coverage, so they’d never get a foothold here unless the NHS ceased to exist.”
Even though Edward was far too old for Nap Time… Violet was going to take advantage of it and take one herself today.
“Jesus Christ, what is happening?” John demanded as he tried to re-arrange his distressed face into a more causal expression. “Why did you leave? Thought you were going to call for a ca-”
“In exchange for her assistance, Doña Nalda will receive the money required to bribe the gaolers to release little Mirana.”
” Molly stood up, toppling over her bowl, stopping Lestrade from finishing his thought. Cake and cream and strawberry sauce splashed everywhere.
John startled and whipped around. “Oh, of course,” he groaned when he saw Mycroft, in a smart pinstriped three-piece suit, umbrella neatly hooked over his arm, leaning against the building. “Was this you? Did you pull strings so I would win?”
“Oh, he called me every filthy name in the book and how I was the most ungrateful daughter in the entire world. I bore it as well I as could, after all, I was still only an eighteen year old girl, a very sheltered eighteen year old girl. I was terrified. But I found my courage and told the bastard quite plainly to let the Earl of Winchester know I was  giving up any claim I may have on the inheritance that would have gone to my mother. I also told my father I would keep quiet about how he kept me and Mama locked up in that house all those years as long as he agreed to support me financially for five years in America. If he refused, I’d go public, create a scandal.”
So it was easy for John to slip out of the house the following day. Because of his bulky messenger bag, he damned the cost and hailed a cab. Sooner than he expected, he arrived at the disappointingly modern looking Medical Library of Royal Free Hospital. Really, it looked more like a block of reasonably priced flats than a proper library.
,” he said with a mocking sneer, “I thought he was some lowly bureaucrat who had just enough pull to keep his junkie brother out of gaol after he had gotten arrested again and again on drug busts.” Lestrade leaned his head against the sofa. “No wonder Sherlock never wanted Mycroft to know abo-”
“Exactly so, they no longer have any influence in American events. At the very least, Professor Moriarty would have initiated the ultimate punishment, the Sign of Four.”
He reached up, ran his fingertips down Mary’s cheek and smiled sadly. Then he turned, hobbled to the door, unlocked it and limped towards the room he shared with Mary.
A man with a receding hairline worse than Mycroft’s and wearing a coal black suit burst in unannounced. “CCTV feeds just crashed so we can’t confirm, but the emergency switchboards have gone mad. All are saying it’s
“Eddie?” Violet called, walking down the curving staircase, now carrying the pair of trainers she had brought with her. Her uniform be damned, she’d  wear the stupid blouses, the ludicrous skirts and the goddamned scarf, but she refused to wear high heels when taking Edward outside to play or for his constitutionals or whatever…
“I think you need to leave now John,” Sherlock cut Violet off and turned his back on John, resuming his attention back on the sad, bluish-white corpse on the table.
, to memorize every single detail so he could visit her in his Mind Palace. Her fair face scarred and freckled like a plover’s egg. Lovely hazel eyes sparkled with intelligence and wit. Her luxurious chestnut hair…
Violet sat back on her heels. “I think that’s fantastic,” she said softly as she wiped her wet cheeks with the back of her hands. “Sorry, I’m a bit of a mess.”
Meanwhile, Mycroft slipped in and stood next to Sherlock’s other side, his hand resting neatly on top of his umbrella handle, as if it were a sword he was ready to draw.
“My old lady messed up her back last winter when she slipped on the ice. Said it was my fault for not sanding the sidewalk,” he admitted sheepishly. When he noticed her hesitation, he had added, “It’s only one 50 mg pill. You know my old lady’s a nurse, or was, until she got busted for stealing oxy, anyway,” he ran his hand over his smooth bald head. “She told me to give this to you. You ain’t gonna get addicted and you need to control the pain.”
“Dad, is that why you’re cross with Harry?” Johnny burst out. “Because you’re afraid what happened to Gary will happen to her?” As Jack sat in stunned silence, John went on, “I’m not stupid, I hear what the neighborhood kids say about Gary… and me, I guess. But, is that why you and Harry don’t get on? You think she’s going to get hurt because she likes girls instead of boys and she won’t listen to you when you tell her to act normal?”
“This is not about you getting your adrenaline fix, you drama queen,” John hissed. “I don’t give a shit who the mastermind is, I only care about rescuing that girl then getting my family out of here, which, God help me, includes you, Sherlock.” When Sherlock only gave John a black look, he added: “Christ,
“I wanted to tell you earlier, but I couldn’t. I am sorry. It’s why none of us talk to her. That and she’s become so rude, just like her father.” Carol said.
“Nope.” Sherlock smiled as he leaned in and kissed Willa’s cheek, Willa pulled him into a tight hug.
A rock or chunk of debris hit her shoulder, it too every ounce of will she had left not to flinch or make a sound.
“I’m going home. I’m packing a bag and I’m going to my cousin’s in Sunderland. I just can’t even be around you right now Mycroft” Greg said turning and heading out onto the street.
But it was eventually proven that he was not the perpetrator and was let go. He’d have several other run-ins with him each time he was in London.
Even at home, he was available for them to talk to him, school, personal, or friend troubles, questions about the big bad world. He did his best to answer and help.
“At first I just stayed on the streets. I would sleep in the rugby equipment shed. Shower in the locker room and do my laundry in the custodian’s room. It was a custodian who discovered me at the end of fall term. I was making a meal in the school kitchen. He took me to the headmaster who took me to the police station who took me to child services who put me in foster care.” John said setting the tea down and holding his hands in front of him. “I thought it would be better. I had a room, it was warm. I had food on the table, and they didn’t beat me. But I still had no one. I didn’t know where Harry was. The family was nice enough but they had taken in a lot of kids and never really stat with any of us. So I was merely just existing. I saw Harry again at the trial. My Father was arrested for killing my mother. I guess with Harry and I both out of the house her had no one else to beat and one night he went to far, she fell and died. Harry and I were both brought into the trial as witnesses against our father. I was 17, nearly 18. The trial was so long drawn out over the year. I wasn’t able to take my first option year for playing rugby for Loughborough, which was fine. I had a lot of time to think while held up in that hotel room. Once the trial was over I walked down to the recruitment office and spoke to an officer. Told him what I wanted to do. Be a doctor and be a soldier. They were more than happy to help. I signed up. Did my basic then was sent to King College and did my medical training there. My final years and internship was at St. Bart’s. I worked at a VA hospital for a bit. Then the war broke out. And I shipped out. My first tour in Afghanistan I was in the Helmand province. I was at a more rear base. The worst of the worst were brought to us. There was me, Riley Sutter, Francis Altman and Judith Warner. We were the doctors. Only Riley and I had full military training. Francis and Judith were civilian doctors who were recruited to work far from the front lines. Riley and I were under the command of Major Sholto whom you have met. The three of us were close. Sholto was like a father to me. When Riley and I got close he looked the other way. As long as we brought him back treats when on leave. Fine whiskey, porn, cigars, and other trinkets from Asia and Australia he took care of us. And we helped him get women, clean women. And we all took care of each other. There were others too but Riley and I were his favorites. We did three tours together. The final one being a front of base, front line hospital an hour and a half outside Kandahar. Think M*A*S*H but with no hijinks and no stoppage in the flow of wounded.” John closed his eyes and squeezed the arm of the chair tight.
“I am healing as is Willa. They are keeping her sedated until her throat heals.” Sherlock replied, “How much of an in do you have to the Manor House case?” Sherlock asked moving the magazine to reveal his notebook. Normally he’d do all the note taking in his brain, but again with the head injury and medication, a physical notebook was better.
“For When I am Gone” She read “Couldn’t even write dead. Never pegged him for the sentimental type really, but he was starting to fade from his former madness and glory near the end”
But then Irene called, she had some extra sensitive information that Jim could use in order to find out more information on a government plot he was looking to unravel. Who knew that then call from Irene would keep them in the game with Sherlock.
Willa changed her headband as the dressers practically tore the outfit off of her before starting to sew her into the final look of the night.
“You did everything you could for Mary, Martha said it was Mary’s choice” Mummy Holmes calmly said and she placed a hand on John’s shoulder
In a rare misstep by Jim he had underestimated the importance of Molly in Sherlock’s life. To an outsider she had been a grown adult acting like a silly school girl all while the object of her affections used her for nothing more than a way to get what he needed.
“You and John are lucky, you’re at a better time to be together, and don’t let my grief affect you. You have two months, then you can start planning, and I will be there, I have three months left this time.” Sholto said
The made their way to the head table and waved. Modern tradition put this as the time to have the first dance, before the meal, but it was a long day and they knew the guests would want a full meal after their cocktail appetizers.
John smiled; the wedding, best part about it was the speech. It was interesting to say the least but cute. So tailor fit to John. All the cases, the bloody guardsman, the poison giant, the elephant in the room, the missing Wednesday……. Wait missing Wednesday. That was exactly around the time.
“She didn’t go to rehearsals so after rehearsals and dinner, Ashton Everett, the violinist she introduced us too. He went to her flat, ransacked. He reported it to the police and Anthea said their monitors just got the alert” Mycroft’s voice trembled as he talked.
“They are almost done.” John said as Sherlock helped Molly into his chair before returning to the file with Greg. “Just waiting on Sherlock’s suit, the fabric was a special order.”
“Then shoot up and spray paint a wall, play music, that’s what Sherlock does, that’s what a normal person does.” John fumed.
“You say you know everything about us, and our friends, but you didn’t know that Molly does not have any family in Newcastle-under-Lyme. It was a code we set up after the whole Moriarty ordeal where he got close to her. Too close for comfort. So we set up a code. An, I’m in distress you’re in danger code, alerts her to leave where she is and seek shelter with someone within Mycroft’s organization. If Mycroft is unreachable they investigate. He has a tracker in him you know, in his leg, his false leg.” Willa read
Upon landing at the private airstrip Willa gave the two men hugs and led them to their waiting car as Sherlock made a beeline it to their own car. Willa apologized for her bother as being tired and sent the doctors on their way with a few photos to remember her by before getting in the car with a shivering Sherlock.
The mess tent was abuzz with what had happened in the rec area. Most were starting to spread the gossip. Many of the Special Forces people all said the same thing; the two privet security men were hustlers. That they took supplied from camp and sold them on the black market, and that they were playing both sides, helping out the Taliban as well as the allies.
“Children grow up without mothers all the time.” Victor replied “I did and look how awesome I turned out.”
Alice, Mindy and Donny got up and left. Karen stood and walked over to john and wrapped her arms around him. Killian, Josie, and Joey did the same. The other looked like they really didn’t know how to react. After the hugs, they sat. John remained standing.
“Ok. It looks like he had an attack and it overwhelmed him. We’re going to transport him to hospital and have the doctors make sure ok.” The Paramedic said as the bundled John up on the stretcher. Sherlock just nodded. “Will you and the little one be riding with him?”
Dear sweet Mycroft thinking he had avoided her manipulations, but really his were not as drastic as others. All her gifts he had been reluctant to giver her at first, so a subtle nod, mirroring his body language and an adjustment in the tone of her voice and he would give her anything she wanted, including her visit with Moriarty.
The pale pink dresses looked beautiful on them. The best men were in black suits with light grey shirts, and pocket squares, no ties. Greg was in a black suit with grey pinstripe and a light grey shirt, with pink pocket square. Mycroft would be in a dark grey suit with light grey pinstripe, a pale pink shirt and grey pocket square, no tie. The no ties were Mycroft’s choice, he said he wore them so much in his everyday life; he would take a break on his wedding day.
Moran was in jail but there still seemed to be money flowing. No communications after Moran’s incarceration  but payments and bank transfers.
“I’m in water, the walls are stone, I, I’m in a well, my leg is shacked to the bottom, I can’t climb up” He replied. “Where’s Sherlock?” John asked
She tried to stand but the pain in her leg would not allow it. She looked down at Marisol who was staring at the side of the gap shaking.
He pushed himself onto his back and stared at the ceiling: the sky, which was visible though the rather large gap left by the explosion, was grey with a sort of purple hue. It was going to rain.
Greg had convinced him that two weeks of Disney, Universal and chilling on a Floridian beach would do them wonders, and so the honeymoon package was booked.
The old lady knew how to handle a gun. She was scared when he entered but her hands were steady, the shot rang out before he could even reach the bed.
“Well then there’s a mouthful.” John gave a small smile as he ran his hand though Sherlock’s hair. He shivered.
“How long after Afghanistan did you start feeling better, and not suicidal? Sherlock cautiously asked.
Sherlock tried to mumble again as he gently touch the spot of blood, John hissed as medics swarmed them.
"Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers." Sherlock quipped as he entered the room. "Ooh, a doctor too. What brings you to my bed?"
“Sherlock you are making up your own world based around a story mummy used to read us when we were younger” Mycroft said with worry.
“They’re clothing is actually rather mismatched as well, I think the one on the far right is wearing a Megadeath t-shirt, next to him looks like an AC/DC t-shift with the sleeves ripped off” Anthea relayed what she saw to her boss
“I know Mycroft’s health and injury history I knew where I could injure him and not affect him too much. I do not know anything about Willa except what you have told me.” Sherlock explained.
“OK. I did put the house in her name, in case anything happened in the line of duty. But we can handle this. I’ll call some guys from the office, and we’ll get our stuff out, we can go live at Granma Carols.” Greg said. He wanted to fume and yell put now was not time.
“Almost. Once the lights are up, Mrs. Hudson and Ashton should have lunch ready. We’ll eat and then trim the tree” Mycroft replied.
She reached up into Sherlock’s bedside table looking for anything she could use to defend her and the little one in her arms.
“Detective Inspector Lestrade, you look a little disheveled, long day?” the man asked as he came to kneel in front of Greg “Do you know who I am.”
There was a helicopter too, noises in the front room and a man in all black tactical gear standing over him.
The screen changed from showing Henry to showing another room. Irene Adler sat on the bed starring up at the camera.
Sherlock was quiet the entire cab ride and then the entire walk up to the familiar abandoned flat that had been the scene of their first crime together.
“Victor darling, we have a change of plans, once Doctor Watson is done with Greg. You will take John for your little activity instead of Willa. Willa will be taking Doctor Watson’s place in my next test. I want to test Sherlock fully. With the unknown variable of Willa, my predictions may change. Leave Anthea with Greg. If Greg lives we kill him and Anthea later, if he dies, one less bullet needed.”
“Really, if he hadn’t egged on Moriarty, played along with his little game.” Mycroft said heading to his desk and sitting.
So much was running though his mind. He was worried about John and with John ill that meant he had to worry about Sherlock as well. He didn’t have to worry about Rosie as he knew Sherlock would still take amazing care of her, but would just neglect himself.
She talked about how she sat on the grave and read her son his favorite stories. She told her husband about her adventures in fixing a hole in their wall. She said she cried a lot, and she curled up with a blanket and sang her son a lullaby before leaving.
It wasn’t long before he reached 221B Baker Street, tossing a tip at the cabbie and stepping out into the chilly night air. The street was practically silent, the only sound the distant sirens from busier areas of the city. John stared at the black door for a few moments before glancing up at the window above. No lights on.  He searched the ground, laying eyes on a pebble near his feet.
John woke up to grey-blue eyes staring at him, Sherlock’s nose almost close enough to touch his own. John grinned sleepily.
“Don’t hold back, Sherlock. I want to hear you,” John said as he grazed his middle finger over Sherlock’s hole. Sherlock released a high-pitched moan and his eyes fell closed. John chuckled, “All right?”
"Well, it wasn't meant for you, so..." John smiled down, his eyes sparkling brightly. Sherlock was about to make a smart remark, but was cut off by John's lips on his - a soft and innocent kiss, but full of love, desire. They pulled apart, their faces still close enough to feel their breath on each other.
Later, he lay tucked inside of his sleeping bag, looking up at the shadows splayed on the top of the tent. Mike was silent next to him, only his breathing audible.
John spluttered a bit and cleared his throat, “Sounds… ambitious. Perhaps the bed, instead, though. It was getting pretty difficult to make use of the sofa, even before all this.”
“Yes, you rather well beat that out of him, didn’t you?” John snapped back at him, his shoulders raising in a rather dominating way. Mycroft seemed to fall back a bit on that, blinking at the doctor in surprise. John ran a hand over his face and leaned back against the seat, “Look, we just kissed, we’re not getting married! Let us figure some shit out on our own, would you?”
“I’m not decrepit, Sherlock, I can carry a bag or two.” John huffed and attempted to cross his arms, before realizing the difficulty of the movement while holding the cane. Sherlock ignored his comment and slammed the door of the cab. He made toward the door of 221, but paused and started the looking around, lifting the bags away from his arms.
John grinned against his cock and mouthed at the tip, swiping his tongue deftly over the pool of precome. He took half of Sherlock’s length into his mouth and slid his tongue underneath the shaft. Sherlock bucked his hips and then he was coming, his hand grasping at John’s hair.
“It’s ok Mrs. Hudson, there’s a lot more blood involved in child birth then the telly will have you believe, not very glamorous” John said as he gently reached a bit below his daughters head to grasp her shoulder to try and guide her out.
“Don’t rush speaking love; there is still some swelling in your neck. John is in the bed beside you, Martha is feeing Rosie” Mummy started
Sebastian looked at the door then down at Mary’s body, he moved the cloth over her lower half to reveal the blood.
“And he had them fooled. He was smarter than them, a genius” Karen remarked “I read about it after the suicide off St. Bart’s.”
“I don’t know where my phone is, Sherlock’s is nearly dead I haven’t called yet” John said as he removed the tea towels and some packing tape.
“No!” John cried as he tried to stand only to have the muscles in his stomach tighten and cause him to wretch again. “It’s, it’s not physical, I’m losing it Sherlock, I’m losing my mind and my body is suffering. I don’t work late on Wednesdays I go see a therapist, her name is Diane, and, I, shouldn’t be hiding this from you. Mary hid so much from me, a whole entire life and look where that almost got us, you dead in Magnusson office and”
“Carlton House Terrace is under some sort of blockade” The other paramedic said as he hopped up from inside the elevator “Some sort of explosion much like here”
“Another nightmare?” Mycroft asked sitting on the arm of the chair. Greg nodded “Would you like me to call your therapist again? I can make you an appointment for the morning”
“That was a full charge… what to see it again?” Eurus asked. Victor was howling with laughter beside her.
Not that love was sickening, no, Jim was a criminal mastermind, but that didn’t mean that he didn’t know or feel love. On the contrary, Jim was quite the romantic. That was the difference between Sherlock the cold unfeeling Sociopath and Jim the full of emotions, but still collected psychopath.
As the passengers disembarked form the plane and headed to customs, Mycroft and Greg dug out their cards to go thought the special line at customs. Mycroft picked up his briefcase as Greg slung his backpack over his shoulders.
That proved more difficult than they thought. John weak as he was had a tight grip on Sherlock’s arm. It took some coaxing but soon John released his grip and was moved to his own bed and settled again.
“It is lovely” Mrs. Hudson said tears forming in her eyes. John bundled Rosie up in his shirt and handed her to Mrs. Hudson.
“I can’t really take any of the credit, Sherlock did it all I just watched Rosie” Molly smiled as she sat
Today however John was exceptionally nervous. Today was the day he revealed himself to the group. That he was John Watson and it was he that the bombs had been meant for.
Daddy Holmes tried to explain that Sherlock was not allowed out of bed yet but the consulting detective was being stubborn.
“And you won’t” Daddy said as Anthea returned with the water. “When he wakes, you can sort everything out and make it better.”
It had been two weeks since the explosions and everyone was awake. John and Sherlock had both started physio, Mycroft had done a little but didn’t want to be gone from the room for extended periods of time. He didn’t want to be so far from the man he almost lost.
"You are going down Victor. My brother will put you away for a very long time." Willa said moving in front of Marisol.
“Let’s go see if Anthea is available and maybe this is just him working with someone on the outside. Maybe the Tong got to him. He may have been their distributor” John said heading downstairs to ask Mrs. Hudson to watch Rosie.
Greg pulled up in front of the house. The living room lights were on. He parked and entered. Elizabeth and Andrew were sitting in the living room, they had been crying.
“Of course, and you should see her, she looks like you” Sherlock said as Mummy brought the little one over.
“It’s ok John, you are in the hospital” Mummy Holmes said taking his hand in hers. John groaned eyes twitched wanting to open. “It’s ok John, You don’t have to force yourself if your body isn’t ready.”
“You are the greatest criminal mind in the world, and you’re going to be reducing yourself to this?” Irene said standing and walking over to Jim “This is not the Jim I met, not the man who put fear into me and into Sherlock Holmes.”
