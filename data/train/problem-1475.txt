“Patience, yes, I remember.”
“I know what you’re thinking,” Sherlock says, voice rough.
The feeling of lips on his nape stirs John out of his sleep. He sighs, smiling as he stretches lazily. Sherlock’s body is warm, very warm, against his back. So that’s how it feels then, being ridiculously happy. He could get used to the feeling, really quick. Actually, he might already have.
It takes all of my inner strength not to kiss you awake. God knows you need to sleep after last night (and morning, and afternoon).
“Even so,” John replies, bumping Sherlock’s shoulder with his. “I could have make us something nice.”
It’s quieter than usual within these walls, though. Normally, it’s a place of respite where, every Wednesday, people come and forget about the grimness outside. They chat, someone giggle, exorbitant inflated prices are ignored. Sounds of life form a swaddle, comforting them in familiarity the same way the blanketed wrap comforts a newborn. Today, it’s as though they all sense that the horrible conditions awaiting them when they leave engender an appropriate hush that is usually found at funerals and religious ceremonies. A last observance to the god of the storm.
“Don’t worry, I don’t think neither of us could have prevented it anyway.”
I should also say that I’m not planning on stopping these letters. Only you could have made me. I’m not going to stop and one day, Sherlock, we won’t have to write any of them anymore. Because it’s not a matter of
John never sold his previous flat - the New World is not exactly a seller’s market - but he’s never set foot in it again, not in the ten months since he’s been here.
“How…” He pushes on, suddenly very much aware this could be the last time he’s talking to Sherlock. “How are you?”
Sherlock blushes lightly, reaching down and lifting John up off the floor and on top of him for a messy, urgent kiss. He arches his back, grinding his cock up onto John’s still-clothed one.
But by now you must have noticed the only subject I’ve left unanswered. It’s been driving me mad, Sherlock. I’ve turned the thoughts in my head over and over again, pondering the pros and the cons, and each bloody time, the same - brilliant, breathtaking, unreal - answer presents itself. You… You say that the love of your life is out of your grasp. You say that you’re afraid to ruin something else. You say that you’ll do anything for that person, you’ll even give up your life. You say that place was already taken when Irene Adler began her little game.
I don’t know what to say. I don’t know where to even begin.
“Yes, you did. It might have been in the middle of night, but you did.”
He tries to smile, knowing he isn’t fooling anyone.
Turns out the cubs might have not been his brightest idea. Even though Sherlock seems to be enjoying it tremendously, John can’t help but feel a low anger build in his abdomen. Watching Sherlock right now shouldn’t make him feel all this love mixed with sadness. He should be able to take Sherlock’s hand and let their laced fingers stroke the sleeping cubs. He should be able to smile and joke and tease Sherlock about bringing one home. But instead, he’s alone on his side, unable to focus on what he’s doing, too caught in his own thoughts.
“What I don’t understand.”
"You don't know how the warrior feels? You really don't know?"
At this Sherlock ceased raising his tea cup to his lips and focused on Cheryl with a determined and steely stare.
"If he was only wanting to have a one night stand like you deduced,then why would he go into so much intricate detail to get it?If I was looking for a clandestine type one night stand…"
'There was once and incredibly rich, beautiful, and wise Prince. Tired of idiots and false suitors who were only interested in him for the wrong reasons, the Prince announced that he would live out his days alone and never be married. This Prince lived happily secluded in a tower with only one servant for company. Occasionally, his wicked stepbrother would interfere in his business and check to make sure that the Prince was refraining from making recreational magic potions in his personal laboratory.'
Harry Watson:
"Well get on with it then."
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
John looked at Sherlock and it was enough for Sherlock to realise that Vatican Cameos it was then.
John lay staring at the ceiling of the police cell, still trying to desperately figure out how his stag night, with a man who brought beakers out on their pub crawl,ended with them being incarcerated. It was going fine until Sherlock had puked all over the carpet and the landlord had violently gripped him by the throat as he dragged him upwards.Then John had saw red.Before he knew it they were both being carted off and screamed at by a gleeful looking Sally Donavan ( why was it always her?),with a list of offences.John’s was assault ( though all he did was trip the landlord up and press his face into the sick until he said sorry to Sherlock for leaving fingerprints on his neck and choking him).His thoughts were suddenly disturbed by the man he had informed three hours ago,when they were both thrown into the cell,that he was not talking to him and wouldn’t be for the foreseeable future.
"I really could use some help if you’re not too busy Down there and think you can handle it."
Sherlock Holmes:
Now can you make the tea?-SH
WILL YOU PLEASE SHUT UP MYCROFT
Changes what?Why would it change anything now?-SH
"Indulge me this once…please Sherlock…"
John was cut off by his smug looking daughter.She seemed to have the uncanny ability to say exactly what she meant as quickly and emotionless as possible.She reminded him of someone.Someone tall and ethereal with thick curly black hair.His influence was becoming more evident in her as she became older and he wasn’t sure he liked it.It made it harder for him to focus on staying mad at her.
The warrior could do nothing but watch the Prince in desperation. The warrior was relieved when the pebble and not the Prince, fell from the great height of St.Bart's to the forest floor below. The stone snapped into two pieces upon impact. Both the Prince and the Warrior instantaneously were threw to different parts of the land.
Miss Watson is right.It's becoming dull.
"Is this not custom before a wedding?
“John ….John, you’re not past it.You do know that?Reaching 50 is not…”
"I would love to see you attempt to silence me."
"I could but I think she’d start to wonder when I didn’t turn up for the wedding."
"Drunk…DRUNK! Bloody hell.Have I not taught you anything?"
Harry Watson:
"Only if we can have a rematch within the next 24 hours."
"The thing about Mrs Hudson.The thing you have to remember about Mrs Hudson is……"
"John...the characters in my story do more than kiss..."
"Good. Thank you.I accept.Everything.With you John.Everything.Always."
John has done PLENTY for Sherlock over the years .He jumped onto a madman with a bomb strapped to him.All to save your brother!
Sherlock looked so vulnerable in that moment.He was clearly not used to this.John would have to be the one to take control and that was one thing John didn’t mind doing.
“It’s my birthday.”
"Well…you know that window over there…"
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"So lets go to bed together Sherlock.You must be starving."
"I love you John.I’m in love with you.is that better?"
You know exactly who I am referring to.
John giggled and Sherlock looked down at him incredously before finally bursting into laughter himself.
"No….I know.Two years ago it would have been entirely possible for you to over power me physically but in that time, whereass i’ve had to ‘toughen up’ ,due to the nature of my work over sees, you have become domesticated and jiggly.I deduce then that even with your many past years of army training,coupled with the severe anger levels you are displaying towards me just now, it would still not be enough to physicaly overcome me.It would likely be a dead heat between us."
John could only smirk as Sherlock held his nerve and out stared the death stare of Cheryl.
"Sorry…. reasonable attractiveness…..reasonable?"
"The Warrior joyfully accepted the Prince's half of the pebble and then handed his dear Prince the half of the pebble that he himself owned. He told the Prince that his friendship and love wholeheartedly belonged to the Prince too. That it always had and always will. He entrusted half of the pebble, his heart and soul, to the Prince. He did so the moment he met him. He was just waiting for the Prince to notice and to finally see how in love the warrior is with him."
“As you wish John.Always, as you wish…..”
"I love you more."
John was roused back to the present day by his anxious looking daughter.
"Ahhhh ha! So you couldn't remember it without the book."
THE CASE OF THE NOT SO SECRET VALENTINE
"John why the hell is Angelo here?"
“Don’t you need the book.”
I kissed him.
SHUT UP MYCROFT!
John lay on the cell mattress and Sherlock got on top of him,unwrapping John by undoing one shirt button at a time.He planted a kiss on each newly exposed piece of flesh on his chest,all the way up to the neck.Sherlock leaned into John’s neck smelling his scent as he did so and biting down hard to mark him as his own. Satisfied he was currently giving John as good as he got, he decided it was time to up his game.He leaned towards Johns ear, bit it slightly and whispered.
John. SH
John climbs into the covers and pulls Sherlock closer, until their bodies are almost flush against one another. He wipes Sherlock’s fringe off of his face and cradles his jaw, kissing him tenderly, sweetly. Pretty soon, it turns more heated, and Sherlock climbs half on top of him, both of them groaning in something like relief. This has been a long time coming - forever and ever all converging into this one tiny moment that may seem insignificant to anybody outside, but to Sherlock means more than any words he could ever articulate.
“Let’s keep that on, love.”
Cases are boring John. No case. Lester doesn’t have any cases. SH
“I didn’t mean to wake you.”
“You know what I mean,” Sherlock says, moaning at a particular movement of John’s hips. “Not the way you touched me.”
“Don’t worry about it. It’s alright. Let’s just forget it, yeah?” John says softly and he looks down into the small but somehow increasing gap between their chairs, something almost sick twisting his features as though he’s in physical pain. Sherlock hadn’t meant to cause it, but he doesn’t know where he went wrong and, typically, he doesn’t know how to fix it.
“Good. Me too.”
John gives him his best smile, “So who was it?”
I will for sure.
“Caught wh-” Sherlock begins before sighing, too. “Oh.”
John turns around in Sherlock’s arms, their bodies still sweaty and hot from the brilliant shag they just had. Still feeling entirely giddy, John captures Sherlock’s lips in a long, deep kiss. Hands roaming all over Sherlock’s back, he shifts closer - if possible - and kisses him just a little harder. He still can’t quite wrap his head around the fact that he proposed, that he actually asked for Sherlock to marry him. In complete honesty, it isn’t such a shock in the end. Just a few nights ago he had planned out their lives, their growing old together, and marriage had been the only logical next step.
I’ve ruined it, haven’t I? Knew that would happen. It’s okay, John, I understand. I wouldn’t want to be with me, either.
There’s so many reasons I don’t deserve your love, Sherlock, but I want it.
“Thanks.”
Sherlock kisses his temple softly, “I know.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes, “You did tell me this morning.”
“What do you think?”
With his goodbye stuck in his throat, he closes the door on all he ever wanted, what he always wished for and is now gone.
were the words he used - that was. He made Sherlock almost believe that he was beautiful and worth being seen. Worth being loved.
“That means you’ll have to sleep in my bed again tonight,” Sherlock says, a playful look in his eyes.
We need milk. And seventeen fingernails, varying sizes. Let me know when you’ve procured both, or either.
What is waiting for them is actually a whole lot of different food and drinks all over the table, and a way too overjoyed Sherlock with a spoon in hand. John sighs, putting Rosie in her chair. “Good luck sweetheart,” he whispers, kissing her softly.
They remain still for a moment until Rosie starts to pull on Sherlock’s leg, reaching for him with both arms when they look down. Sherlock quickly leans down to pick her up, kissing her cheek softly and smiling at John. “We should go out for lunch.”
“I’m sorry for being an emotional mess,” Sherlock mumbles.
“Thank you again,” Mark smiles as soon as they’re out. “I’m glad I sent that email.”
I take my pen and start to write my response, but my mind is elsewhere entirely. I try to begin with asking about the cases you’re thinking of working. I try to begin with the melody you’ve written recently. I try to begin with telling you how wrong you are to think I ever thought you were a freak and a sociopath. I try and try again, but there is this ridiculous hope growing inside my head and I can’t seem to stop thinking about it.
Written by
It’s time to let go of the illusion that I’m an ingredient essential to your happiness or well-being. It may have been slightly true in times past, but we’ve -
Sherlock doesn’t reply, but doesn’t take his eyes off of him. In the end, it is the silent staring, not quite an encouragement but almost, that allows the knot in John’s throat to loosen just enough.
promised that to each other, remember?”
“I packed it in this,” Sherlock replies, pointing to the small carry-on bag.
“Of course we can, love. Lots of people are doing it. We’ll just need to avoid touching each other for a while.”
Sherlock nods slowly, not meeting his eyes. John slides a tentative hand between them, aiming for Sherlock’s.
“Should we go, then?” John asks, already turning away.
Of all the places John had believed never to belong again, the quiet, ever so familiar sitting room of Baker Street had been first on the list. Too much had happened between those four walls, too much had failed to happen, too. This is the place where he had once thought he’d watched the years go by, listening to a piece on a too-quiet violin, his eyes closed and heart beating with each note filling the air. It sometimes amazes him to think back on that time, how easy it could have been to simply ask if they could have this forever. He wonders what Sherlock would have said, maybe just nodding or shrugging his agreement, the two of them never breaking this unspoken arrangement never to use words when it comes to such sentiments.
I know you’re at work and I know I’m not supposed to call you at work but I just wanted to say. That thing you did. The one that was good. It was. Good.
“Yesterday. I. I think, John, you’ll find that you were not operating with a full data set,” Sherlock mumbles, mostly into his lap. He isn’t sure he can do this, now that they’re sat opposite one another and it’s real and it’s
“Tomorrow?” Sherlock finally asks.
“I love you too, even when you make me watch… was is it even called again?”
“Good. He’s good.”
“Not hungry.”
Sherlock hesitates, mostly out of stubbornness, because falling asleep with the sound of John’s inhales and exhales sounds better than morphine right now.
“That was brilliant!” Sherlock exclaims when their time is up.
“Hmm. You’ve said that already,” John counters. Because he has. He’s said it every fifteen minutes or so since they’ve been on lockdown. And he’s showing no signs of letting up. And the most infuriating point remains that John can’t find it in himself to mind - not
Sherlock? Is everything alright?
and Salambo06 at
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Sherlock bites back.
. Sherlock pushes it away.
It takes less than twenty seconds for Sherlock to break into the room.
Sherlock watches him as he pours himself a glass of water only to wash it right away as well as his hands for long seconds. John has been, ever since the beginning really, more than careful about everything, and Sherlock had made sure to follow his example. Since he barely leaves the flat, he knows he’s much less at risk, but it reassures John to see him do so.
“Just one then,” John smiles, kissing him softly. “To talk to each other when doubts are too heavy.”
“The sofa is not comfortable,” Sherlock finally replies, not what John had expected at all.
“It has to!” Sherlock yells, disrupting the semi-peace of the early morning around him.
“Hmm?” Sherlock asks, turning again to face him.
Sherlock dives in for another burning kiss, and even though everything in this situation is screaming for some amazing morning sex, John finds that he is more inclined to simply cuddle with Sherlock in what is now their bed all day. He kisses him a bit harder, hoping to pour out all of the feelings currently mixed up inside his head. One of his fingers finds the largest scar on Sherlock’s back, starting around his hips all the way to his shoulder, and he follows it for a long moment, up and down until their kisses turn into something much more soft and lazy.
Want you so much. Can’t really stand it sometimes. SH
“You never ask. You just barge in and deduce.”
John takes a deep breath. “If this is the end of us, I want to make sure you know everything.”
“I know exactly what you mean. ‘One half of me is yours, the other half yours - mine own, I would say. But if mine, then yours, and so all yours.’”
“The flight should have been exhausting.”
and that’s so much better than I ever thought I’d have.” He bumps Sherlock’s shoulder in reply.
“Maybe not, but you know it all about me.”
regret it.”
He wonders how he ever came to be here, alone, fifteen days before Christmas.
“Of course, of course. Keep in touch?”
Sherlock exhales loudly again, not saying a word.
You can’t just ignore me, Sherlock. We’re supposed to be in this together, we’re supposed to be talking. You can’t just leave and expect me to accept it. We need to talk. Call me. Please. I love you.
"So you were planning this?"
Oh yes, a lesson was about to be taught.
"Holmes…please." my words came out like gasps. I felt my resolve, dissolving…he was so persuasive when he wanted to be - no, I firmly told myself, mentally shaking myself from my stupor, you must stay vigilant, you can be the master for once.
"I know. Don't wait up for me. Bye John."
A cry of "Confound it Watson!" bounced around the living room as, yet again, Sherlock had tried to sit down too quickly
Breathless, the two men snuggled on the sofa. Sherlock curled up against the older man like a cat, using his tummy as a pillow, whilst John gently caressed the detective’s soft curls.
The detective didn’t move.
"I imagine you're right", replied Mycroft, "but anyway, luckily for the witch that it wasn't you in the cage. You're so horribly skinny. She'd have a damn hard time fattening you up." Sherlock shuddered again at that word: "fattening". The way Mycroft's rich voice had stressed these syllables and how his pudgy fingers had stroked Sherlock's prominent ribs as he'd said it. Sherlock felt strange and tingly. His fragile little hands hugged Mycroft's girth harder. Many a night after Sherlock would be plagued with strange dreams of being trapped and force-fed by evil grown ups, however these dreams were not always unpleasant.
"Mmf, you sure you're not going to order anything Sherlock?" said John thickly through his massive mouthful.
This simply proved too much for John. The sight of the detective with his mussed hair, red cheeks, gangly limbs and this beautiful stomach, so smooth and curved and that John had packed to the brim with calorie-laden cakes, that was now streaked with the other man’s cum…it was too perfect an image. With a long sigh of rapture, John deposited his seed in to Sherlock.
Yes, Sherlock Holmes enjoyed being underweight. He liked his transport lean and hungry. He needed to be able to feel his bones, to be sharp, and light as a feather. Food just weighed him down, it was a distraction, a necessary evil, it slowed him, made him feel sluggish and useless.
"What do you have in mind?" With his deft, dexterous hands, he began to slowly stroke my neck. "And I don't want to wait. I want to…" he bit me hard on my jaw, "now."
“Wait John wait!” Sherlock leapt up, casting all the papers he had been looking at in to a big heap on the floor.
“Well I’m glad you got some “nourishment” tonight.”
Mycroft crouched down and moved one hand over Sherlock's trouser clad crotch, gently feeling his semi-erect length. The other he snaked under the younger man's jacket and pushed against his side. Sherlock's heart began to beat faster.
“Shh, shh. Let me finish. I’m sorry I got so angry. I shouldn’t have tried to put the blame on you. It was nice of you to take me to those restaurants all the time. Besides, nobody forced me to eat so much food, I did that of my own volition.” John smiled at Sherlock gently, who still looked like a scared rabbit. “It’s not like you actively wanted me to gain weight or anything.”
"I don't know."
After a few moments of contented silence it was Sherlock who spoke first.
"Doctor Watson, are you alright?"
I'd try and be gentler from now on.
"I merely made a few inquiries and knew exactly where to go."
Dear, dear, sweet, Watson…
It was a warm, tender kiss full of promise, but was to be cut short by the sound of John’s rumbling stomach.
***Narrator's Perspective***
Soon Sherlock began finding new excuses to drop in at Angelo's and various other eateries where the owners owed him favours. He would of course order nothing and instead watch John with hungry eyes as he devoured plate after plate.
“No,” breathed John, leaning forward to worship his creation, “you look beautiful my love.” He began lathering the tight surface with licks and kisses.
Now it was John’s turn to stare open mouthed.
“Sherlock, tonight was amazing and I’m so proud of you. Thank you. Please, we must do it again sometime.”
A lightning flash; I whipped his tie from the floor.
He was perfect. A true work of art, surely he must have been heaven sent. He was striking enough in clothes, out of them he was simply stunning. Smooth, like the purest white marble; blotched only where my love bites where purpling nicely. His dark hair was a gorgeous contrast to that snow like skin, and so elegant! A strange mixture of feminine beauty merged with the sharp angles that are granted to the male portion of our race. I swear that there was not one ounce of superfluous flesh on his body, he was all legs, eyes and taught muscle. I hungrily roved my eyes over him, taking in every willowy curve; preparing myself to pounce; ready to ravage him…until I met his eyes.
He started as I speedily turned him over and bound each of his wrists to the wooden pillars of the headboard.
Sherlock began to pant. Mycroft moved his hand to Sherlock's painfully hard cock and gently began to pump.
"John." He sighed, trembling, as my hands ran more and more rigorously over him, he was helpless. I needed to explore him, I couldn't contain myself much longer. My erection was practically ripping my trousers.
The detective opened his mouth, but agonisingly slowly. He’d guiltily fantasised about this before, about being fed. It was terrifying now it was actually happening. He felt his cheeks aflame and his crotch harden. The feelings of powerlessness and arousal were overwhelming.
"Now off you go good lady, I promise this will all be solved in no time at all."
John reached a hand forward to stroke Sherlock’s long sleek neck and pull his head forward, to bring his lips against his.
“So what’s all this about-“ but Sherlock was unable to finish his sentence, as John had cut him off with a deep kiss. He buried his hands in Sherlock’s soft, ebony locks and stroked the detective’s sharp jaw and swannish neck.
No wonder he was offended; his loyal little pet disobeying him.
"Shut up Sherlock" retorted Mycroft, but with no trace of anger in his voice.
Then Mycroft pushed if possible, even further in, he was hitting Sherlock's prostate directly.
The younger man bared his teeth in response; he looked but a few moments away from snarling at Mycroft, even from lunging and ripping his throat out.
As the young lady sitting on the couch opposite the two men leaned forward and proceeded to do so, Holmes snaked a vicious hand, unseen to any observer, across to Watson's lap.
He broke away, lifting his head from my shoulder he pulled back so that our eyes could meet.
"Yes. Fuck me with your fat cock Mycroft. Fill me."
Gently removing his trousers I planted softer kisses on to his chest and wondrously flat stomach. His flushed face, ruffled hair and apprehensive expression where so unlike the Sherlock I knew.
I snaked my hands around him, and lifted him from the chair. He struggled.
It had been an unbearably long time since I had felt that lean yet powerful body quiver beneath my own much broader frame, to make him moan and clutch as I ravaged him senseless. I could easily take advantage of him if I wanted, physically I was much stronger, it was just that mentally he was so dominant and masterful.
"A good question indeed it was your –" again, the detective's sentence was cut short by a ruthless plucking in his lower regions.
I roared his as I felt his hot, white seed erupt against me.
At last at 8pm John came sheepishly through the door.
“JohnIthinkyoulookgoodwiththeweightandifyouwantedtobeinarelationshipIwouldverymuchlikethat.” He told his feet.
The younger man did not need telling twice. Coating his fingers in the oil Mycroft inserted one finger in to the tight little entrance in front of him. Sherlock's ivory flesh was cool to the touch, no doubt due to his lack of insulation, but inside he was delectably warm. Soon another finger was added, then another, stretching and preparing. Until at last...he was ready. Mycroft positioned himself and slowly entered. The two brothers moaned in unison as Mycroft's cock was swallowed by Sherlock's narrow passage. Sherlock loved the feel of his brother's tubby stomach against his arse. Mycroft adored the touch of Sherlock's pert and barely-there butt cheeks, which he couldn't resist giving a quick squeeze. Gently thrusting he traced his hands from Sherlock's broad but bony shoulders, along his emaciated back with the all too pointy vertebrae, back down to his gorgeously narrow waist, which he squeezed hard.
But there were also things that Sherlock was not satisfied with in the story, why would Hansel have to stick out the bone for the witch to feel if he was thin? He deduced that surely it meant that Hansel had put on a lot of weight if he needed to trick the witch, but why was that not written in the story then? He asked Mycroft as much.
Sherlock suddenly looked rather awkward.
The detective only groaned in response. To which Mycroft began to move his hand up and down Sherlock's length harder.
Mycroft smirked, "That shouldn't be a problem brother dear."
***Narrator's Perspective***
Sherlock gasped as Mycroft began sucking heavily on his earlobe as deft hands removed his jacket and began working on his shirt buttons.
He strode over and lowered himself gingerly, and I may add, a little haughtily, onto my thighs.
"No thank you Angelo I'm on a case, but I'm sure that the doctor will order something with pleasure."
But to my dismay, I found that I could not. My eyes kept leaving the paper in front of me and straying over to that lithe figure sprawled upon the easy chair, his long legs draped over the arm.
The detective still appeared very uneasy but at least his mouth was closed now.
“…Maybe not entirely my fault that I’ve put on weight?” John frowned.
Confound it though! Is a man not allowed to appreciate a pretty thing? Is he saying I am not permitted to cast an approving glance over any great thing of beauty without expecting reprobation?
I choked back more tears, and laughed what sounded rather like a sob.
"Yes," said Holmes, gently trying to ease himself away before he felt a commanding nip telling him to remain exactly where he was. Grimacing, with a slightly defeated, and breathy voice he continued, "a sorry story really, it appears he had become wound up in all sorts of gambling debts."
Sherlock practically threw himself on to the black leather sofa, before looking petulantly and defiantly up at his brother; gangly limbs crossed. Mycroft was pacing up and down and looking like he was thoroughly enjoying himself.
For the best part of the afternoon Watson had been hidden under that desk, as unluckily for the poor doctor his detective had returned to Baker Street rather earlier than expected. So now, Watson had every intention of inflicting as much discomfort as he had suffered for countless minutes in that cramped, dark space. So with excited hands he began to unbutton the trousered crotch that was now at his mercy…
His moans filled my ears, gradually growing in volume, until shocked I discovered that my own mouth was joining in.
“Oops sorry,” blushed John, “I didn’t really get time to eat lunch.”
The doctor spurted his hot seed, which Sherlock gently swallowed.
Scanning the room, I finally found the bottle of lubricant, it was on the floor by the bed post.
“Busy, very busy. There’s been another outbreak of flu and there’s so much paperwork.”
With one arm I kept him held down, the other I used to unbutton my trousers. As I went to resume my original position: - holding his hips; he tried to make an escape. I prevented this by quickly grabbing his slender waist and heaving him back on to the bed.
Sherlock reached forward reverently, like a child being handed a precious toy. He took John’s plush stomach in his hands and gently stroked it, patted it, wobbled it.
"You being all mysterious with your cheekbones", John had told him. Sherlock had felt a swell of pleasure at these words, one that even reached his groin, causing it to twitch in response.
If it were even possible, Sherlock felt his cheeks become even hotter.
“Oh no! Not that I meant we’re girlfriend and boyfriend, or more boyfriend and boyfriend, or argh! In a relationship. I was just trying to make a joke!” spluttered the older man.
From the cacophony of screams I heard my name, my first name.
45minutes later, John had practically demolished the huge order of food and was allowing himself to sink in to the sofa.
Later that evening his phone buzzed:
Insufferable man! Damn his pride. Although it was I who had initiated our relationship, it was not long before he knew how to control it. He learned everything at an alarming rate - as was his nature. Soon he knew how to manipulate me and my emotions anyway he wanted - to get anything he wanted from me.
The whole day Sherlock stressed, and paced, and watched the clock, and drank endless cups of Earl Grey, and applied two nicotine patches (this whole messy situation was definitely a two patch problem), and waited, and considered even asking Mycroft for advice and of course didn’t eat. He needed it to be time for John to come home. He needed to make things right.
John reached hungrily forward and caressed Sherlock’s midsection, feeling so very proud of his handiwork. His petite stomach was taut and rounded, sticking out impressively from his small structure.
“Look at me Sherlock.”
He had arrived; Sherlock bound across the pavement and burst unceremoniously in to the elder Holmes' living room.
His pale face grew flushed as sweet little patches of red flared upon his hollow cheeks, as his usually focused grey eyes became cloudy.
It was strangely like that fateful day, our positions slightly reversed, me at the desk, and he on the chair.
I'd often assumed as much and considered the man to have never had any form of intimate relationship, naturally I had no way of knowing for definite. However, seeing that look confirmed it all, instantly any doubt on that matter evaporated.
“John, please wait!”
“Hello Sherlock, I’m home!”
Sherlock sat up also and massaged Mycroft's flabby gut, loving how heavy and warm and pliable it felt.
"Please John, my body is used to this. I'm in no danger. I will eat once the case is over, which should be by tomorrow. I appreciate your concern though. But let's not let Angelo's hospitality go to waste."
"Shhhh, Sherlock. It's time for something interesting!"
Sherlock's pale cheeks went pink at these words, but he did not break eye contact.
“Wait a minute…all those trips to Angelo’s and all the other restaurants…is this another one of your weird experiments Sherlock?”
Boring. SH
"Watson!
Sherlock moaned in to the kiss and melted under John’s touch as the doctor undid his dressing gown and pushed the garment off of him.
He needed his thinness, for him it equalled superiority. It was proof he was better than average. Better than those regular human beings and above their base needs, better than those pathetic people who were dependent on and even addicted to food. Better than Mycroft.
"You're really enjoying yourself aren't you?!" he spat.
“Exactly. I think I might try squeeze in a jog now before work.”
"But of course darling, and soon you will be too!"
But now…
Keeping my thrusts even and controlled I pulled in and out. His loins now standing to attention, created luscious friction against my stomach.
Hitching his legs over my shoulders, I leant on the mattress and began to prepare him. Tipping a generous amount of the cool lotion on to my hand I massaged it in to him, feeling myself hardening in anticipation.
“Cups of tea don’t count Sherlock.”
Sometimes, when his mind needed distraction, he would go in to his mind palace and try to trace back where his odd and eventually somewhat sexual relationship with weight had come from.
My writing was interrupted as a certain detective began to nuzzle my face and neck with smooth cheeks, reaped of any stubble by his meticulous morning shave.
“No John, why?”
Both, it appeared, were also equally surprised by my sudden entrance, as my dear Watson sprang to his feet and extended a hurried hand towards our guest,
“Hello John,” said Sherlock nervously, “How was work?”
Sherlock soon became used to this sort of comment. It was almost a part of daily life for him. His family and many others seemed to revel in making that sort of observation, commenting on his extreme thinness. He has very clear memories of his Grandmother's funeral when one of his uncles, whom he hadn't seen for a long time, said to him in way of greeting: "Bloody hell, if it's possible you look skinnier than ever!" Sherlock was fourteen at the time.
Mycroft Holmes:
Oh please! He make believes being a detective like a child would do.
Mycroft Holmes:
"She’s really not John.Thankfully.Not displaying any of the key indicators of alcohol addiction.Casual and harmless use expected in most teenage cases but still has a while to go before she can be more mature about alcohol consumption in moderation."
John sat another cup on the table and Cheryl placed herself opposite the two of them and they all sat in thought, tea getting cold in each of their hands.Cheryl could take the silence for only so long before feeling compelled to speak.
Wi cant ewe fanky me-JW
"You just told her you loved her with all your heart and more than anything else in the world?"
Sherlock inched closer to John with every word until it was painfully obvious to them both about where this was now heading.Where this had always been heading.Sherlock slowly and sensually pulled John towards him by his belt and wrapped his arms around him before he replied in his husky baritone voice.
"Fuck Sherlock."
Mycroft Holmes:
Am I imagining this or is your big brother and my big sister having some sort of weird playground type slanging match to defend  our honour on the blog?-JW
"They’ll have you John."
Did you really agree to go to your death to protect Mary and our daughter? Is Mycroft being a drama queen or is that the truth?-JW
"We’ll explain better."
Don’t forget to kiss me before you leave tomorrow-SH
Sherlock helped me to make the last card because he felt that it was very important that you know how much I love and appreciate you. I think that you are the most wonderful father and that you have a very fetching name.Thats why I asked him to help me sprinkle it in pink glitter on the card.
to tide them over and tether them to each other, still, through the dust and the arguments and the seemingly perpetual silence. Cancerous almost in its prolonged and intense nature. It made their feelings a dirty, shameful thing.
“How do you do that?”
I can’t believe it has only been four days. It feels almost like a lifetime, but I suppose that’s what it feels like to the one at home, itching, waiting, wanting.
They continue eating for a while in affable silence until John meekly begins: “When you say never… what about… Irene Adler?”
John sighs. “Alright. Let’s go.”
Sherlock draws the tattoo that is now seared into his memory onto a blank page on his notebook and turns it over for her to look at.
John hangs up before he can make a fool of himself, staring at the phone in his hand for a long moment afterward. He does nothing to prevent the bright laughter escaping him, nor about the sudden warmth filling his chest.
brief
It was never my intention to stop talking to you or seeing you or even being your friend. I value our friendship, Sherlock. You have to know that, right?
John Watson
“Come on,” he says, pulling him towards the bedroom.
“...brighter than the morning star.
John takes in the sight in front of him, the Christmas lights shining everywhere, giving the city a certain look of wonder. He isn’t surprised to find himself comparing this particular view with a burning desert miles away. He doesn’t really remember each Christmas spent there; doesn’t really want to anyway. Especially the last one. He rather likes this view better, despite the cold infiltrating his every bone. London always had its charm, no matter what any Londoner would say.
“Maybe I shouldn’t either then?”
Sherlock nods, not moving yet but seeking another kiss instead. John obliges him happily, sliding both hands up his back and into his hair, letting their tongues meet and part for a long moment before pulling apart for air. He can see the arousal so clearly in Sherlock’s eyes then that it makes his entire body shudder.
and Sherlock has never felt so grateful. He’s not sure he would have felt confident enough to bridge that gap, but John, as ever, has courage enough for both of them.
At first he feels calm, peaceful in his decision. Then, he feels numb. Finally, he feels nothing at all.
The tragedies that resulted in the decay among them before the dust ever even came would have been enough. Why this on top of it all, then?, they both wonder, separately. They used to choke on their words before, but for entirely different reasons. They used to revel in their silence, take comfort in the warmth of it, cocooning them in, safe and harmless. Now it suffocates them, cotton wool tufts stuffed into their mouths and duct taped shut.
“I’m afraid you’ll get bored at some point. Of me, of our life, our routine. I doubt that I am what you deserve, that I’ll be able to make you completely happy, that I won’t hurt you again. I wonder whether you also picture the two of us, old and grey, sitting in our garden.”
“Sherlock, you can’t ignore me forever. This is ridiculous.”
I’m afraid, John. Afraid of what you’ll do when you see me in this new light. SH
I thought about all the things you said about Mary, but I’m keeping my answer for a future letter. There is too much to explain, and it shouldn’t be done in a hurry.
Still and always yours,
They remain still for another moment, lips meeting and parting slowly until they can no longer ignore the noises coming from upstairs. Sherlock grabs his hand and holds onto it as they climb the stairs together. Rosie greets them both with a huge smile and grabby hands, laughing the moment John takes her in his arms.
“Alright?” he asks softly, stopping before his mouth meets more bare skin.
“I am.”
Sherlock looks up at him, his emotions so raw and out in the open that it takes all of John’s breath away.
John guides his head just a little lower, depositing a chaste kiss on his lips.
Sherlock reaches for him once more, squeezing lightly at his other hand while surveying the scene as well, tamping his reactions to the signs of expected but never delivered life firmly.
“Please, please, please,” he huffs out eventually, and John withdraws his fingers slowly, driving Sherlock mad with pleasure and an almost-painful tension.
I… I wish I was back home with you, preventing you from being bored.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, smiling, “It might be something I’ve been thinking about. A lot.”
“Were you watching me?” he asks, panting against Sherlock’s mouth.
“I know,” Sherlock says, soft and quiet. “I understand.” Another pause. “I want that too.”
“Can I kiss you now?” John asks softly.
A long minute passes, spent in complete silence. Mrs Hudson’s face changes from concerned to surprised to delighted until tears are pearling in her eyes.
“Not at all. You know, Sherlock, people do come in with their own unique designs. It’s not like we hand them a chart and they pick from it. Well, not often,” she says, rolling her eyes and standing back up. “Is that all?”
With shaking hands, he hurries back to the bedroom to get his phone. That’s when he sees it, lying on the kitchen table: an abandoned pack of cigarettes. The answer comes to him in a flash and, without another second of hesitation, he puts his coat on and heads for the stairs. The icy air takes him by surprise and he blows into his hands, looking around before letting out a relieved sigh. Sherlock is right there, his back turned to him, looking down on the sleeping city.
Sherlock stares at him for a long moment. “You want this job.”
,” Sherlock whimpers, shaking more than ever, and John pulls away, not wanting to overwhelm his now over-sensitive cock. “No, don’t,” Sherlock protests immediately, and pushes back against him.
“Hotter than yesterday.”
Sherlock studies him for a long moment, and so John remains as open and trusting as he possibly can. He needs Sherlock to understand just how serious he is, how long he has waited for a moment like this and how close to being sick with worry he feels right now.
As soon as his eyes pop open the next morning, Sherlock reaches for his phone once again. This time, it takes a couple more rings before John picks up.
Sherlock sighs, deciding he’ll convince John at one point or the other anyway. He comes up with a dozen new points in his favour while John showers but, by the time he comes out, it looks as if John’s worry has only grown while being alone in there. Lost in his own thoughts, he pours himself a cup of tea only to let it get cold while getting sheets and a pillow for Sherlock.
Johns eyes snapped to Sherlock, but Sherlock although momentarily wounded,had not flinched at what she said.His eyes simply remained fixed on her as John spoke.
"Who?"
Well that's  in your favour I suppose.
I have also set the alarm on your phone for half past seven.That should give you plenty of time before work to shower and have a cup of tea -SH
And have satisfying sexual intercourse on a regular basis-SH
Sherlock Holmes:
Me more so than anyone.
John rose from the table and walked around it until he was towering over where Sherlock sat.He extended his arms in a manner which seemed to encourage Sherlock to grasp them.When their hands where joined, John pulled him upwards and towards his body until they where merged together.He rested his chin on the taller mans shoulder and began to sway.Suddenly Sherlock was reminded of the romantic sounding music that surrounded them.John was dancing with him.He hadn’t danced with him for such a long time and yet they effortlessly moved in sync.John began to speak once more, only this time it was now into the shoulder of the detective.
“Do you want me to tell you this story, or not?”
"What do you mean start to go completely mental?"
Sherlock choked on his water as he processed the words John had said. The restaurant owner had an encouraging and wistful smile on his face as he quietly collected the candle he had brought from his establishment. He placed it gently on the table between them.
Sherlock has put my chair back and Mrs Hudson is making me my favourite tea tonight.Sherlock used his violin to get Cheryl to sleep this afternoon.It worked on me to!I'm a bit knackered, so having Sherlock around to help me is working out pretty good.Greg and Molly said we are like those guys in that film.The one with Tom Selleck,Ted Danson and Steve Guttenberg.Only there is not three men.There is only two men and Mrs Hudson.
“Explain?”
I'm also logging off.I'm bored of this entire conversation.Maybe you two should meet up and share a cyanide pill.And I know it's a lot to ask of an idiot, but do remember to delete this entire conversation Mycroft!You'll give Anderson,Lestrade,Molly,Donovan and Mrs Hudson a coronary if you don't!
We all mock you Mycroft.
Mrs Hudson
Sherlocks face began to light up as he looked again in the direction of his blogger.There it was.The spark.The first thing that really drew Sherlock to John Watson.The first but not the last thing that captivated him about the man.
Dear Dad,
John Watson:
"So we have been reliably informed on numerous occasions.You didn’t go to Rosie’s so where did you go? You have a distinct smell on your clothes.A smell I know very well as does your dad.John deduce"
"You have to cut the apron strings a little,both of you.You realise you’ve been smothering me."
John Watson:
John Watson:
“Of course John.As you wish.”
Hold on..how the bloody hell do you know I came onto him on my stag night?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
"Listen Sweetheart me and Sherlock are really sorry we didn’t sit you down and explain what we are to one another sooner.This didn’t start whilst your mother was alive.I’ve always loved him …"
Your precious brother John shot a man on the first day he met Sherlock!
"I have reared that girl up from infancy with you John.Whereas she has your aggression and hot headed ness and her mothers spirit,she also has a little of my perceptiveness,astuteness and cutting attitude to life.Most of all,in that time she has grown up and understands human relationship dynamics and our relationship a little better now.She has eyes John.She studies me everyday and she sees how I look at you.She’s not an idiot."
"Okay let’s see.You said you were at Rosie’s house last night but the clothes you are wearing have been worn all night.If you had stayed with Rosie,she would have given you a change of clothes as she has done in the past when you have actually stayed there."
Sherlock waited a few minutes before answering John.In this time John began to panic a little at the thought that Sherlock had let his words sink in and was trying to analyse if there was deeper meaning in what he meant by them.
John Watson
"Mrs Hudson,there is something we would both like to tell you."
"Do you remember the first case we went on together?"
John Watson:
Greg Lestrade
Pleased by John’s submission,Sherlock began to pace the cell floor once more.Sulkily John sat up and rubbed his head in exasperation, wondering how many hours he had left to suffer this caged wild animal in front of him.
"I’m a Holmes you say.Adding that to the list."
That’s what I’ve needed to say to you.That’s what I’ve always found difficult to say to you.I couldn’t articulate what this exactly is between us into words before.Not with you always bloody staring at me with that look,that condescending, piercing look of scrutiny you do so well.I would…I have crumbled under that gaze before.It’s taken me a long time to write this in the way I always meant to say it to you.Months in fact.I mean how do you begin that conversation with someone who has been your friend first.The best of friends.How do you tell that person,’I quite fancy the prospect of me and you finally putting a label on this weird set up we have and making some sort of verbal commitment to one another’.When is there ever a good time for that conversation?Especially when the person you need to say it to is Sherlock bloody Holmes.Anyway, I’m sorry to send this to you in a text but a letter seemed too formal for my liking,an email or facebook message not formal enough for your liking.-JW
Sherlock Holmes:
John IS a psychopath! It's what he gets off on which is why he is so obsessed with My brother!
“So you keep saying. Just so we are clear, in four and a half hours, we go back to indulging my every whim for the other 364 days in this year.Agreed?”
"Just phoning my taxi John, give me a minute,better reception in the living room."
"I’ve been thinking about this for a while and now I’ve made my decision.I don’t want to call Sherlock my uncle anymore.I hate calling him my uncle."
"Really John?I believe I just explained thoroughly your physical methods won’t work On me."
John shut the laptop over and sat it next to them on the couch.He turned to Sherlock and worryingly pulled the younger man’s hand into his own.
As if saying this had snapped John out of some mental block he had placed inside himself to temporarily forget the woman he had proposed marriage to only months beforehand and who had agreed to be his partner in life,he suddenly began to look guilty.VERY guilty.
John Watson:
Sherlock looked like he might die right there and then of embarrassment when he realised his heart had been cut open and the one person he hid it so fiercely from could now see how hard it bled for him and his daughter.He could hardly meet Johns eyes that night,so John had forced him to by tilting his friends head upwards and holding it at eye level to his.Sherlocks voice had come out pained and weak.
John walked towards the kitchen with Sherlock and began preparing the tea.Sherlock merely sat at the table and continued to stare at his fraught looking partner.With tea in hand John placed the two cups next to one another on the counter and sat down close to Sherlock with head in hands.
" That was a misunderstanding between me and your mother nothing more."
You wouldn't even admit it to yourself far less me.Pointless.-SH
"More than all the mad men out there. Continue to ask us to stop protecting you if you feel you must but it will NEVER happen.There will never be a day that goes by that we will not gladly give our lives or our freedom to ensure your safety and happiness.You’d best get used to that."
Sherlock Holmes:
“Could take a while, Doctor Watson.There are a few positions I would like to test out
He must also think very highly of her as a person-SH
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Harry Watson:
None of your feelings that have concerned me go over my head I'm afraid-SH
My lips merged with his, my arms wrapped around his back and I clung on for dear life, fearing that this would be the one and only time I would be permitted to completely open myself up and to show this man exactly what he meant to me. To show him the depth of feeling that he could stir in me at the most unexpected of moments.
“It’ll be fun Sherlock, I promise. You don’t have to eat it all, but could you try for me, please? I’d really like that.”
Many times it would all end with Mummy crying, Daddy shouting and Mycroft smugly finishing Sherlock's plate, content to be the "good boy". But as the years went by and nothing changed his parents eventually came to accept, if begrudgingly, their son's eating habits and just added it to the list of Sherlock's many eccentricities. He did eat, just in baby-bird like quantities and appeared to be healthy enough. Mycroft on the other hand had begun to look rather too healthy.
“Um yes.”
***Watson's Perspective***
Ten minutes later and there was a huge steaming mountain of spaghetti bolognese, Angelo always gave them almighty portions, sitting in front of John. John dove straight in and ate a huge forkful.
"Sherlock...why are you doing this?"
Stay tuned for the next installment where there will be loving, tender fat John/tiny Sherlock sex, John feeding and eventually kinky Sherlock stuffing.
In later life "fatten" still held power over him. It was what John wanted to do to him, it was what Mrs Hudson wanted to do him, it was what Mycroft wanted to do to him. It was something that he had to be stronger than, to rise above. As for Sherlock the idea of gaining weight was both repulsive and fascinating. Even as an adult he could not imagine what it could feel like. Sure, his weight would maybe fluctuate by a pound or two depending on what cases he was working on and how active he was, but nothing drastic; nothing that anyone other than himself could possibly notice. It would normally be a slight change to the visibility of his ribs, or whether his stomach was concave or flat, and nothing more.
Sherlock inhaled deeply once more,
But of course it did happen again, many times, not every day of course, as Sherlock did not wish for John to become suspicious. Eventually, all these meals out began to have the effect that Sherlock was waiting for.
"Both. Yes. All of it. Everything", Sherlock replied breathlessly.
“John?” whispered Sherlock, holding out his own barely touched portion of Chicken Chow Mein to the doctor. John found it oddly seductive to hear Sherlock sound so nervous and look so timid, it was a completely different side of him that John was just discovering. It turned out he was discovering an awful lot tonight.
"Mr. Holmes, are you certain that-"
"Don't be dense Sherlock, John finds you just as attractive as you find him."
Sherlock moaned gently as John stroked him, his cock straining against the boxers he was still wearing. He nodded, stifling another moan and unable to look his lover in the eye.
He snorted disdainfully.
"Holmes! This here is Miss Merryweather, she's come to see you about a case". All this was said at quite a speed, and with a faint blush crossing the doctor's features.
“Come off it Sherlock. You surely can’t have failed to notice this?” sighed John, pointing to his rounded midsection.
The younger man was so scrumptiously tight and hot. Mycroft began to quicken the pace of his thrusts, shaking all of Sherlock's lanky body and causing his own stomach to tremble. At this, Sherlock started to let out long luscious moans in that beautiful deep voice of his, which only spurred Mycroft on.
“I have taken nourishment.”
With bony fingers stroking his what felt huge (but was actually rather small by conventional standards) belly in wonder, Sherlock at last allowed sleep to claim him.
This wouldn’t do, John thought. He was determined to get some food in to Sherlock. And what’s more, he was determined to make it fun and sexy for the both of them. A plan began to form in his mind…he would just have to buy some supplies tomorrow.
"Mr Holmes! Dr Watson! Welcome! It is wonderful to see you both. Remember, anything you want is yours, and I'll cook it personally myself!" cried Angelo, looking thrilled to see them.
“No Sherlock, not until you’ve had a bit more. I know you, I’m sure you’ve eaten next to nothing today.”
"Surely after this, my dear John, we should be on a first name basis?" Wearing a wry smile, a sparkle of his usual dry humour shone through. I couldn't believe it; the man had almost completely regained his composure.
"Because I like being able to do something nice for you. Angelo's kindness is somewhat squandered on myself."
It had been almost embarrassing, no mortifying, eating all it all under Sherlock’s watchful gaze. Neither had said a word, but nothing needed to be said. Not now he knew how the detective truly felt. To John’s great surprise, it was also most definitely arousing. Sherlock had looked like a kid on Christmas day, eyes starry as he watched the detective devour portion after portion.
After finishing the first enormous plate of bolognese Sherlock insisted that John get another helping of something, ("I know you're still hungry John and besides it's free.").
"Yes. Quite. Well, do call around again whenever you are available and I shall explain everything you wish to know in full."
Raising myself up, I stood at the end of the bed and grasped one hand around each of his jutting hips, I'd learned from previous experience that they made the most perfect handles!
"Yes Sherlock?"
"It is most appreciated Mr. Holmes, I shall stop by again then tomorrow, I hope you will feel more like yourself by then. Goodbye."
"Ah!"
Nonetheless, excuses cannot keep being made for him. He needs to learn a lesson.
Sighing in pleasure, Sherlock watched as Mycroft began to disrobe. This was a rare treat indeed; during most of their couplings the elder man had always remained clothed. As his plush stomach was finally unveiled, Sherlock could take no more.
"You, you, sly old dog you!" Holmes couldn't decide whether to be furious or highly amused, or somewhat aroused…
“Now Sherlock, we’re going to try something different tonight,” said John, reaching in to the shopping bags and pulling out a series of desserts.
"Yes, yes of course, you do appear rather flushed, in all this excitement I hadn't noticed. Are you alright?"
The fairy tale had terrified and delighted Sherlock. Why was it such a big deal that the family was hungry? Being hungry wasn't that bad! Then when Mycroft turned the page and revealed that the kindly old lady was in fact a witch Sherlock jumped in horror. She was going to trap Hansel in a cage and "fatten him up". Sherlock shuddered as these words were read aloud; so many times the same thing had been threatened to him. Not that he'd be thrown in a cage though of course. Could some of the grown-ups he knew actually be wicked witches? He clung to Mycroft with his spindly arms, his brother's solid, squishy mass was somehow reassuring and comforting. It blanketed his minuscule frame. It made him feel safe.
"After all…you did demand it of me." He spoke this with more than a mere tinge of bitterness.
When he was quite bare I flipped him over on to his front. Clutching his cool, worryingly narrow wrists, I stroked the slightly warmer area where his cobalt blue veins ran like ink trails along the white paper of his skin.
"My lap may provide a comfier alternative old boy!"
“Beautiful,” breathed Sherlock.
"Well Sherlock?"
The detective merely responded to this by quickening the movement of his tongue and tightening his throat around the other man.
Angelo's eyes lit up and he looked downright delighted as he went away to prepare another dish for John ("You see Sherlock, John loves my food! This is a real man.")
He loved me, I knew he did, it was just that he had very little knowledge in the way of romantic relationships…or any relationships really! Also at times, he could have a very self-absorbed and childish mentality. I believe it must have stemmed from his childhood in some way. Of course I did love him dearly, more than I could ever love anyone else, but he did have his faults, and they would grate terribly on my nerves. His untidiness, his complete disregard for his health, (I must constantly nag the man to eat!) and most of all his selfishness. It is probably because his merits of character are so magnified compared to the rest of the world that his downfalls are too.
"Yes, yes, there's no problem with our good doctor, do continue."
"Is the good Doctor in today?"
“Amazing!” John started unwrapping a dark chocolate cheesecake and prepared a forkful to feed to Sherlock.
There was an awkward silence for a few minutes, before John moved to join Sherlock on the sofa.
Sherlock looked at his feet, cheeks reddening.
"AH! Arrgh!"
"Tsk, tsk. Temper, temper my dear," said Mycroft soothingly, burying a hand deep in Sherlock's ebony mane. "You needn't be so angry, as I said I've always suspected. But our dear doctor confirmed it all for me. But don't think that I'd never noticed your secret happiness that you thought you kept so well hidden. Your delight when I'd finish your meals when we were children, your obsessive cataloguing of my weight changes, your endless teasing, your sadistic joy if I had put on weight, your prodding and poking; also your own strict control of your weight. Yes Sherlock, you're attracted to what scares yet fascinates you, by what you can't comprehend, by your greatest fear. It's textbook brother. Fear and disgust are two of the strongest evocative feelings."
"Good boy, as a reward for your honesty, I may just well get undressed".
Watson smirked, "I should say the same thing."
“Oh um…yes well. I don’t know. I just enjoy watching you eating and I enjoy the effects of it,” said Sherlock quickly, turning crimson. He knew this wasn’t the whole truth, but he would tell John. Eventually.
"Yes of course, now I'm quite certain that I was apprehended here, by-"
"Ah!"
The patient in question has a mild case of-
"So have you got a boyfriend?Or maybe you would quite like a boyfriend now?Maybe there is Someone you can imagine being your amazingly smart,good looking,grey haired,soldier boyfriend one day soon if you were really lucky."
“Why?..Be honest.”
“it’s private…”
The doctor leaned back in his chair and silently motioned with his hand for Sherlock to begin the tale.
As if saying sorry had suddenly become the worst thing in the world, or a catalyst to start an explosion, Cheryl leapt up waving her arms ferociously in the air before resting them on her hips.Her next words were screeched in levels that Sherlock was adamant only dogs would be able to hear.
Sherlock
John Watson:
"You Would…why?"
The wizard who had set up this evil plan to destroy the Prince and steal his pebble, had not anticipated that it would fall instead and split in two. He deemed it broken and of no value. In his anger he used his magic to separate the Prince and the warrior.It would be the Prince's punishment for destroying the stone. The wizard,in turn, was also thrown to a darkness from which he could never return.
Mycroft Holmes:
"You might not know what the warrior's reply would be but I do, so I want you to look into my eyes when I tell you it, okay? Sherlock...look at me...please..."
When we talked about the blog being cordoned off yesterday, I did not say that it would be permanently removed.This blog entry is active John.Best delete is as quick as you can.
YES-SH
"I’ve met someone wonderful.Someone that I’m deeply in love with and i've decided I want to spend the rest of my life with them.If they’ll have me."
Well you won't mind if I ask him then-JW
John flung his hands up in the air in exasperation as Sherlock swung round quickly from his seating position to fix his eyes on the child studying him.
John sighed and lay back down on the cell bed.He placed his arms over his face as if to drown out the situation he was faced with.As he stretched along the thin mattress, his shirt began to ride up slightly, exposing a patch of hairy bare flesh at his midriff and the top of his blood red pants.As Sherlock mentally catologued all these details about the soldier, he momentarily lost his thought process.It unnerved him that the man could casually lay there completely oblivious to the power he had over the detective.That just looking at him like this could do that to him time and time again.John mumbled a response from underneath his shirt cuff and Sherlock was back on track.
"Girlfriend? NO!Eight years later. it’s still NOT my area John.That’s always been your department not mine."
"Oh did she let you down then,so Sherlock is eating with you now instead."
Sherlock smiled and winked affectionately at John’s daughter before bounding across the living room,grabbing his laptop and wandering to the table with his microscope,slides and various specimens.He was glad he couldn’t see Johns face when his daughter spoke her next words. If he had, he was sure he would have saw the Vatican cameos expression fixed there.
"Fuck yes."……Mrs Hudson….."
He hadn’t the words out before her door was violently shut and locked from the inside.Music began to blare out from her speakers and John could only stand with his jaw clenched and nose pressed up against the outer frame.
“Very well. There is one story I haven’t deleted from my mind palace.My mother used to tell me this particular story on stormy nights like this one.We would get a big blanket and she would insist that we snuggle next to the fire with hot chocolate. She would get the old dusty book down from the top shelf in my room and read from it.”
None of this would ever have happened without the interference of Mycroft and Harry.So you could say it's all their doing.The only reason we are together and having lots and lots of mind blowing sex,is because of Harry Watson and Mycroft and their little argument on this computer yesterday.
John stroked Sherlocks face as he whispered words in a forced breathless manner.
"Wow...wait a minute Sherlock...That seems a bloody strange way to end this story.What did the warrior do with his half of the pebble? You said the prince was transformed into a better person because he gave the warrior his heart but what did the warrior do when the Prince gave him it? Don't try and tell Rosie that story because she'll pull the place around about her at bed time to find out what the warrior had to say!"
"Accurate."
"Thanks For that."
"Anyway stop trying to change the subject! Where were you last night?"
Or I'll Marry you!
“John, …… I think you should know that even with all of that said the fact remains that I STILL consider myself married to my work…however…”
“But John.”
A bemused looking Sherlock stood with his eyes piercing through him,leaning on the opposite door.
Sherlock
"I can see that dear.Didn’t you manage to get a date for tonight?"
Sherlock why would you give up your life for me?
Molly
Sherlock looked at him quizzically before pushing forward in his quest for answers,still waiting on that spark from his conductor of light.John took a deep breath filled with the perfect mixture of relief and disappointment and pretended to look enthralled by what Sherlock was now saying.
As Sherlock continued to pace and to not listen to the words John was forming, his friend looked at him with exasperation and wondered how this man could be so astute and yet so oblivious at the same time.
"Yes John that is correct."
Fuck!Why didn't you say anything?-JW
"I will never forgive you for phoning Irene and not Molly to do that talk with her Sherlock."
"Genius John."
John choked on the whiskey that was soothingly sliding down his throat until that point of the conversation.He was half heaving and half hoarsely giggling, whilst a frustrated and exasperated Sherlock looked on in annoyance.
"Uncle Sherlock will you let me call you dad?"
"This stone was one, but your actions made it two. We each have ended up owning a piece of this stone. To transform it, we each must take responsibility for the part we now have. It had chosen to join us back together the very moment you dropped it from the great height. So you must ask yourself why you did that. The answer to that will soften and transform your half of the stone before us."
Make the tea John and we'll talk-SH
"Because Mr Holmes it’s more romantic that way…"
"The stone you sit clasping in your hands is half of the the same dirty pebble that I gave you at the beginning of our adventures together. It is not the pebble which transforms but the person who holds it precious to their heart. The pebble is merely a symbol of selfless love and friendship. A love and friendship which you now have for me. A love and friendship which has gradually softened and transformed you within. You have been transformed and because of that so have I. Each part of these stones on their own are powerless, they are truly nothing, but when they are joined, they becomes an unbeatable force which nothing in this world can either separate or destroy. That is the stones true power."
“When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.”
"Right. Okay. So You’re unattached like me and looking for that one amazing person that means the world to you.That you would do anything to keep safe and to make happy.The person that makes you live. Fine. Good."
"Then I can say this now.I don’t want to call you my uncle anymore because you’ve never really been my uncle have you?You lied about Santa Claus for me and wrote intricate scientific theories to convince me that reindeer fly around the world in one night ,even though it took you away from an important case and Uncle Greg was pissed at you for a whole month.You came to all the nativity plays about some guys birth you believe is a fictional character from a poorly written fairytale.You taught violin to my class for a semester when the music teacher was sick because you just knew that even with you at home,it could have effected my grades to not practice everyday.You nearly broke the arm off of a flasher that day you took me to the park when I was eight.You called half of Scotland yard to arrest him and nearly got arrested by Sulky Sally yourself.You tucked me in, told me stories about Moriarty,bandaged my cuts,moved the dead body parts to the spare fridge when my friends came round because you wanted them to be allowed to come back,you brought the body parts out as party decorations at halloween when I was older, so my friends would think I was cool and you watched Scooby Doo with me and never revealed the bad guy until I had given up guessing.
Good riddance!
For a second time.
"I’m explaining."
What does it change John?-SH
The Prince continued to be fascinated by the pebble and he took the little pebble with him wherever he went. The Prince was so thankful for the gift of this magical pebble, and for the warriors loyalty and companionship, that from that day on, he made sure to regale the warrior with all of his attention. He also made a vow to be the warriors protector, just like the warrior protected him. So their life together went on. It was filled with adventures, and yet...
“Really, John! Can you give your daughter no credit for this situation? It was the colour she chose when I asked her to pick one for you. She also helped me sprinkle it. If you don’t believe me then have Gavin dust the glitter tube for fingerprints.Surely, as my willing accomplice, Rosie must take her share of the blame in this!I don’t know why this has grown into such a big issue.Why this card annoys you so much. It was meant to make you smile. You have been so sad recently and I concluded it was because you missed having companionship in your life, as you stopped dating after Mary and it’s been three years.I researched this extensively before deciding on the best course of action.A card on an occasion like this, from ones child, is meant to make the recipient feel valued, appreciated and loved.It is not meant to make them launch a full scale inquiry!Does it disturb you because I made an error and wrote John?I’m sorry for the Freudian slip but perhaps I was trying to remind you that Rosie is not the only person left on this earth that deeply loves and values you.”
John Watson:
John pushed himself up and off of Sherlock,fixing himself so that he looked as respectful as he could under the circumstances.Sherlock did the same but noted it would be difficult to explain his shirt being robbed of all its buttons if anyone bothers to ask.John settled down next to were Sherlock lay on the bed.He had chosen to take the floor as being found in each others arms by Lestrade and photographed for facebook ( especially after the red pants incident and before he would have the chance to explain all this to Mary as best he could) was not high on his list of wishes right now. Just as Sherlock began to go to sleep he heard the voice of the army doctor whisper quietly from the space directly beside him.
They both continued to stare at one another as if their lives depended upon it.Sherlock suddenly smirked and moved himself so that he was now leaning over the top of John,half straddling him,with his legs and arms at either side of his eager body.He lowered his face towards his friends,brushing his nose and mouth along his cheek as he slid them towards his ear.
Fine.....
"And I him."…
"You would do that?"
A minute or two passed before John’s daughter decided to speak again.
“Mrs Hudson being a lunatic.”
"Fine…"
“Yes.”
“I remember it well enough.”
"You better hope we don’t, because Unlike you I actually have a real job to bloody protect.God knows what my fit and proper person record looks like these days thanks to you"
"I’m completely and hopelessly in love with you,you stupid dick.I’m that much of an idiot it took this ridiculous night to force me to face up to my feelings and finally admit it." Sherlock tightened his arms around John and held him like he never wanted to let go.
“Mary was right, John .Who we really are, doesn’t matter. Not to them.Not to the ones outside Baker Street that read about our cases and sit in our client’s chairs.The only people it matters to are us, our friends and our Rosie.What you have just written is truly wonderful to me but …”
“You know you can’t actually post it though, don’t you.”
Ohhhhhhhh.....ohhhhhh gosh.
"Yes."
"Turns out I’m the best deducer at a Baker Street…. who’d have thought it!"
Mrs Hudson angrily stormed into the kitchen again.
"So…"
"You thought all that was a good idea,NOT ME! I was quite happy to send the client away, so me and you could enjoy the rest of our night together.However because bloody Sherlock Holmes shit faced or not,cares more about the work than spending time with his best friend! I’m currently locked up in jail on my stag night and have been strip searched!Which is not exactly the type of stripping I imagined would be involved in my stag night.My choice of red underwear has been commented on by the whole of Scotland Yard now,thanks a bunch for that memory by the way!Greg…
Cheryl shot Sherlock a quick, “Thank you for not being a complete bastard”,glance before abruptly, successfully but rather obviously,attempting again to steer the conversation to someplace other than the fact she was shit faced last night.
As if breaking some kind of spell,John’s words and Cheryl’s response seemed to have the power to snap Sherlock out of it.He released his daughter from the bear hug and threw himself up from his chair.As he twirled and skipped and flung himself around the kitchen, he could only say.
"Why are we not in it then?"
Sherlock eyed her strangely, before matter of factly replying.
That doesn’t mean I expect us to …you know…do stuff.God this is awful.Is love meant to make you feel this embarrassed,unsure of yourself,fantastic and yet bloody sick with worry that you’ve fucked everything up with the one person you care about above all others?If it is then it turns out i’ve never actually really been properly in love until now.Is it meant to make you feel like you’ve turned into a sodding sentimental yet slightly pervy cock? -JW
John slid his hands slowly down the torso of the shaking detective and pushed them underneath his suit jacket until they were locked at his back.He used this possessive lock to pull Sherlock as tightly against him as possible. There was no space between them now and no mistaking the effect John was having on his friend. Sherlock arched backward slightly to mildly reduce the contact and to allow himself access to look into the glazed and aroused eyes of the man in swaying in front of him.
Sherlock Holmes is so much more than the legend that’s been built up around him by myself and the media.The Valentine’s story is a symbol of who he really is.The heart as well as the brain. Not a freak, not a sociopath. Sherlock Holmes is the man who commands the whole of Scotland Yard one moment and then covers himself in pink glitter the next, all because my daughter demands it. Sherlock Holmes is the man who prides himself on being the smartest person in the room, but will mortify himself at the drop of a hat, all to show me that I am loved.
His eyes remained on her and hers on his.In that instance Cheryl’s expression changed to one of realisation and happiness.John could only wonder what she had saw in Sherlocks expression to invoke that type of response from her.He didn’t have to wait long.
Then you know.You know how I feel?-JW
---------------------------------------------
John not expecting that particular question,felt his words catch in the back of his throat.He suddenly couldn’t find it in himself to answer.He merely nodded Instead.
"A long time ago your dad thought the same thing"
Mycroft Holmes:
John motioned for Angelo to approach the table.This was a very strange occurrence in such a tiny kitchen space as theirs and as ridiculous as the situation they now found themselves in.
That almost sounds like exactly the same conversation I received from a drunk Sherlock one night in his two year exile.Begging me to look after John and keep him safe because he was,'the only thing in life that mattered to him now.'
He is likely madly in love with her and finds that he can often go through a day not able to think of anything else except his cases and her-SH
Sherlock looked gleeful as he glided towards Cheryl and guided her confused looking self into the client chair.John took his seat and Sherlock preceded to circle her like a vulture.She looked terrified.’She should be’,John thought inwardly as he watched Sherlock read her every move in the last 24 hours.
If you mean Mary...then...no...I don't...
"Doubtful."
"He’s just kidding.I accept! of course I accept.Wait there I need my violin."
When we finally did manage to prise ourselves apart, the room was filled with stunned silence. Neither of us had saw this coming. We spent a good five mins just catching our breaths and staring at one another, trying to work out how we had ended up at this point. It was Sherlock who broke the silence first. He started laughing.He was laughing the way he had done in our very first night together. It felt surreal.It wasn’t the time for laughing, not really.We were the dearest of friends. Our lives together and what we did with them mattered to a great many people. We had just decided to gamble with those lives and things weren’t ever going to be the same again. How could they be? No matter how much we would try and convince ourselves, we had just drew a very final line under the last ten years. What happened from now on would be a new beginning. It had to be. I didn’t feel like laughing was the appropriate response to that. Confusion and being scared shitless was the appropriate response to that. However, Sherlock’s laughter filled the room around us.It was infectious.I began to laugh as well.It was ridiculous.We should have been talking.We should have been working through what just happened.Instead we were standing in the kitchen of 221B Baker Street laughing our heads off.We had nearly ripped the clothes from each other’s backs, that how passionate we had gotten only ten mins before, and now we were standing at a distance with our laughs mingling in the air between us.
"John…. If you …if you choose to do this….you’re…"
I asked him why he had written John on the front of the card. He looked at me with utter confusion before stating that it was in actual fact my name and what else would he possibly have put.When I reminded him that Rosie’s name for me is dad, he looked even more affronted.When I questioned him on his use of pink glitter he became incredulous.These were his actual words…direct quote……
It's getting embarrassing.
John took two steps further forward and focused his eyes on Sherlocks.Sherlock noted he was looking to see if he actually meant it.
“MMMMhhhmmm ….Which I am…very much ….”
John Watson
"Exactly what it sounds like.I overheard Mrs Hudson talking to her friend next door.She was telling her about the early days before Mum, when you and him ‘experimented’ a lot and she didn’t mean with his microscope.It was a different type of chemistry and biology you both specialised in.She completely confirmed my suspicions."
"Much."
"So do I."
MOBILE PHONE CONVERSATION
John I have just got back from a case and have been welcomed by the sight in our living room of you and Lestrade lying passed out on my chair and yours.As I was trying to ignore you both and get dressed for bed, I happened to finally turn my phone on.Ten messages John …..really? What could be this important and yet not important enough for you to not go out and get yourself inebriated with Lestrade of all people- SH
This was enough to break the stupour Sherlock was currently in.He finally touched John that night.He put his hand on his clean shaven partners head and lovingly stroked his greying hair.
As John spoke each word his breathing was coming out in strained gasps and his grip on Sherlocks hand grew so tight he thought he might crush it.Sherlock slowly and bravely lifted the hand not in use and brought it towards the side of Johns face to rest on his cheek.
"Most of the evidence I have gathered over our acquaintance points to it."
"Yes I do Sherlock and it’s locked.I can’t leave."
"Is that what you think tonight is?Me trying to make you my one night stand?"
Lol.This is hilarious.Won't be long before this is all over the papers and Internet.
"I’m not Aunt Harry Dad ….or Mrs Hudson……"
“The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.That might be your best case title yet, John!”
"Calmed down?"
Sherlock Holmes:
"Do you have a girlfriend ?"
“The Prince of Fire”
"If you had let me finish,I was about to highlight to you the fact that you being my blogger and sidekick means you now encompass at least 99.99% of my work."
“In your mind palace,not noticing,yeah I figured.”
A similar and comforting sight met me when I emerged from the entrance of the flat into the living room.There was Sherlock lying sprawled on the couch, cradling Rosie in his arms.Face full of glitter.Faint scratch on his neck from were I had clawed a bit too possessively two nights before. The scene felt normal and abnormal all at the same time.
