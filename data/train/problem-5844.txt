The arena is quiet. So quiet a pin could drop and its sound can still be heard. Tony Stark is on the court, the U.S Open Finale, the standings at 5-4 on the fifth set. 40-30; championship point. The player can be seen taking a deep breath, readying for the serve of a lifetime. What the whole world realizes is that if Tony Stark wins this match, he would have fulfilled the illustrious calendar grand slams in one season, a surely unimaginable feat in modern men’s tennis. Tony Stark tosses the ball upwards, and he jumps. Upwards a little, he’s swinging with a powerful grace, and the serve breaks through the air with a loud crack, the ball moving at an insane speed. The man across him is none other than the Norwegian tennis player, Thor Odinson, a player of explosive power, and he shows it through a jaw dropping return to the two hundred kmh serve. And so the rally starts. The two players hit back and forth, the sound of the ball coming in contact with the rackets, the air being sliced by the speed of it, those were the only things that could be heard from the court. The rally felt like it went by for years, until Tony Stark breaks through. The Norwegian player hits upwards, a grave mistake. Tony takes a deep breath, he predicts. He jumps.
“Nah, I don’t think I’ll bother with that,” Steve shrugs, grabbing one of the magazines Bucky has on the floor. Bucky’s other obsession is with tabloids and teen magazines, which is... weirdly endearing.
“Actually it’s quite the opposite. You came to me. You were the one who- came up with your little foolish analysis and so, on the contrary. I believe that you, Steve Rogers, are obsessed with me. Now have a nice day.” Tony then walks away, drink in hand. It enrages Steve to think that this is how the scenario played out. He’s not willing to let the prince have the last word.
“Just some egg rolls, want some Stevie?” Bucky is his best friend, his brother. His Ma and Pa adopted him as a child after he lost his parents in a car crash and they’ve been thick as thieves ever since.
But it’s all fine. Tony likes his new friends. And it’s always nice to have friends on tour, it can get lonely sometimes. Of course, Pepper and Jarvis are always present, along with the rest of his team and his mom for the most part is also there. Tony has a lot of acquaintances on tour, one would, after nearly two decades. But he’s constantly apart with his
“You know Thor’s won titles, a lot of them. There’s Rhodey, Udaku, Barton, Loki- I don’t own the game” The other guys on tour are fantastic too, is his point. The media has an absurd obsession with Anthony Stark, always has. He wishes it weren’t so. Tony’s greatest joy is playing tennis, and he’d enjoy doing tennis as purely tennis and not like the circus it is now. With him as the apparent ring leader in the media.
“I’m sorry” Tony breathes, a final one. His eyes go blank, the sparkle in them are gone. His face goes blank, that grin he’d like to see still everyday in their workshop sessions. His mouth unmoving, usually full of words, full of knowledge and full of compliments.
Tony’s phone buzzes with a notification. Jarvis looks over to him, “Who is it?”  Tony shrugs. He sees a simple text.
“So, you are a very lucky man Steve Rogers. I managed to have a deal with the office of his majesty the King, and guess what? We both want this to go away.” Angie sounds cheery, but there’s a certain edge to her voice causing Steve to be suspicious. There’s more, there’s always more.
Bucky throws a magazine at him. A move uncalled for. As a child Steve would respond accordingly and throw a magazine back at him, but he is not a child.
“Game, Set, Match, Mr. Anthony Stark.” the umpire interrupts as Tony lifts his fist into the air in victory. After a few seconds, he and Rogers approach the net, shaking hands.
The air force one is a sight to behold. Before his mom’s career, Steve had never even step foot on an airplane. Now, he’s flying trans-atlantic on one of the world’s most expensive and secure plane. The leather chairs are comfortable, and Steve is buried deep in his book, A Little Life, it’s titled. And it’s a touching read. Next to him there’s Natasha, Natasha is the VEEP’s adoptive daughter, she’s also his best friend. Natasha is amazing. She’s brilliant, beautiful, smart, and overall a sight to behold. Dugan, the giant ginger of a secret service agent is on a crosswords race with her, and it’s evident that he’s losing. Bucky, on the other hand is reading politico. Which frankly is an unusual read when it comes to Bucky.
“Well Carol and Rhodey are with me in heart.” His other two best friends apparently decided to skip on spending off season together this time, same with Bruce and Thor.
The air is dry, the world feels grim, Peter’s standing alone in the middle of it. He can hear the cheers of the people, people being reunited with their loved ones, people just cheering- being happy altogether after the news of Thanos being defeated was known. What they don’t know- what they don’t know was the cost of it, what it cost to defeat a giant ugly purple grape. What it means to him, and how much it hurt.
“Congratulations on Rotterdam by the way.” Tony painfully tries to change the subject of conversation.
“I’d like to think that this is a joke, that you’re just playing a prank on me. But I guess present you wouldn’t do that, college you, maybe. You son of a bitch, I can’t believe- that out of
In a flurry of motions, Steve found his hand lying on Tony’s shoulder, earning a reaction from Tony. Moments later, Tony turned his body around, this time, almost pushing- heck, of course he pushed Steve. The nightmare part was that Steve didn’t find his balance. He stumbled- tripped over his own feet, feeling his body slowly going into a horizontal flop.
“I don’t know, Jan. There’s just… I don’t see anything else exciting ahead of me. Maybe I’ll have to change careers, be a pianist or something.” Tony says wistfully. The tips of his hair are being blown away by the wind, and he shivers a little. Tony stands up first, patting down the back of his pants and offering down an arm to Janet. “Let’s go inside, it’s getting kind of cold.”
long. So far, he’s been winning the odd sets with ease, but Rogers seems to have taken a liking to making his life utterly difficult in the even sets. His thighs are starting to burn like hell, and Tony’s struggling to keep profanities away from his mouth- wouldn’t want a warning from the umpire. When he counts the points and takes account of the fact that it’s Steve serving turn, they’ll probably have to resolve the final set with a tie-break. A fucking joy. It’s six to five on a deuce and his assumptions proved to be correct when Steve equalized their games, triggering the ten point tie break. Tony is going to win points like his life depends on it. And his pride does depend on him winning. Tony admires Steve Rogers, heck Tony has loved every minute of playing Steve Rogers. That doesn’t mean Tony is willing to lose to him, though.
Sorry for this VERY overdue update! Good news is I finally got over writer’s block and I’m already  starting the next chapter so the wait shouldn’t be that long. Don’t forget to leave a kudos and a comment to tell me what you think about it!
“And best friends know everything, from birthdays to favorite foods. Better read up Steve” he leaves Angie’s office after that, returning back to the residence.
“And here I thought you were just here to accompany me for breakfast.” he grabs a croissant, readily biting it.
Glasses of wine are constantly being refilled through the night, minutes after everyone dispersed we see Tony lying on his back on the grass. The night sky here is beautiful to Tony. He spends most of his time on tour, travelling the world. Aside from that, he mostly bases himself in New York or London during the season, keen on separating work from home. There aren’t stars there, but here you can still see it. Not much, but it’s there. In another life he imagines himself venturing through the stars, his silly dream after too many hours of Star Trek.
“I don’t condemn it, boys are boys, pro tennis players or not.” Jarvis continues- “Now then, I assume you and the good Mr. Rogers traded contacts?”
“Of course you do, he’s your best friend.” Angie hands Steve a file, inside it is everything he probably needs to know about the prince.
In a short moment of salvation, Steve finds his hands reaching towards Tony’s sleeves. The end results of such action would be the prince falling with him. Falling on top of him.
Thor had been one of Tony’s first encounters in the world of professional tennis. At that time, both weren’t exactly the most experienced player, especially in terms of age. Before their ascendancy, comments were made of how the sport was dying in search of a new star, beyond the gifts of the likes of Sampras, Agassi, Becker, McEnroe, and many more. Entering the tour at 17, Tony was a rising star, slowly turning into a supernova. With a stamina only the young could own, power only a young could afford and shots so accurate, the beauty of it is comparable to couture jewelry in the terms of tennis. In short, there had been no other like Anthony Edward Stark before. Born of tennis royalty, and claiming the title of king with ease unlike no other.
“Thor mentions you to me a lot, actually.” Well that’s an interesting thought. Tony knows that Thor is an extremely friendly guy, and he
Okay so. Tony may or may not have loudly admired Steve’s biceps in the Australian Open. He may or may not have also waxed poetic about it when close-ups of it were shown on television during his viewing of the matches to Pepper.
“It’s not a bad thing, Tony.” Tony thinks Pepper is wrong in this one. Pepper is rarely- or if all wrong. The thing with sports, a player is only as good as their opponents.
“Tony, meet James Barnes. Bucky, this is Tony Stark.” Tony reaches out his hand to Bucky for a hand shake.
“Huh, really? I was practically adjoined with tour because we started the tour together.” And they were. He still remembers the headlines and how people were constantly calling him and Thor the two greatest players of their time- and possibly of all time. He remembers getting questions about Thor constantly at press confrences and interviews- he still gets them until now, and the same is also said for Thor. They were rivals, and being two young kids- albeit one slightly younger than the other, slowly grew a great respect for each other on court, and a blooming friendship off court.
“Mr. Stark has challenged the left corner, the ball is called as fault.” the chair umpire nods to him. Tony sees Rogers place his hands on his hips, as they stare at the screen, the hawk eye starting the replay. The crowd is cheering in anticipation of the result. And Tony is deafened by the screams of his fans when the hawk eye calls it
The moment Steve enters the car, it’s silent. Tony’s hand loses its place around Steve’s shoulder, and the prince straightens up his clothes, taking off his sunglasses. Well maybe Steve is staring, he’s not gonna lie when he says Tony looks exactly like the prince charming he is.
“Hey Angie,” Steve greets back sheepishly. He knows what he’s here for and he’s ready to get it over with.
“Well okay, Tony.” Steve says his name with a smile, and Tony loves the sound of his own name being spoken by Steve. And no, he’s not a narcissist for liking nice things like that. “Let me introduce you to Bucky- sorry, James Barnes.”
“Far as I remember, you’re number one, not under number one, Tony.” That is such a lame joke. He laughs anyway.
True to his words, not ten seconds later, there’s a knock on his door. The temptation to ignore the sound and not let Bucky in is supermassive. But he breaks, and he opens the door for Bucky.
It isn’t that bad. He thinks. The bar is open, it’s free. He’s on his second flute of champagne. Steve sports a black tuxedo, a true classic customized just for him. He talks to various important people he can’t remember the names of, and makes jokes with Bucky and Natasha in the back.
“The prince will pick you up here, and there’ll be a few photographers to welcome you and the presence of the prince. After that, we head to Kensington where you’ll stay for the rest of the trip. It’s a rest day, Steve. The action begins tomorrow,” Steve is glad, but he’s also nervous as to what to come. First, prince Tony(?) is picking him up, so he’ll have to face him the moment he lands. Great.
“I don’t know, but I’ve been listening to people saying it all night,” Steve sighs. Pretentiousness is a disease.
“Just assessing the damage, shellhead.” Steve rubs at his hands, hiding it in embarrassment. Why did he have to do that? “I’ll be back in a bit with that ice, stay still.” Steve turns around and runs up the stairs.
“Mr. Rogers,” typical aristocrats, always having to establish their status on those with lower status than them.
. There has always been talks of the Stark boy. How can they not talk of him when he’s the product of two incredible players? The attention became more enveloping the second they branded him
“And I don’t think I’d be able to call you up.” Oh, did Tony take in the social cues incorrectly? “I mean- I’d love to, it’s just I don’t have your number.” Is Steve asking Tony for his number?
Rogers greeted him with a smile, waving and shaking his hands after running to him and Jarvis at their entry. It seems that Rogers and Barnes had arrived here first.
“Well at least we weren’t stupid enough to keep a monarchy,” Steve is truthfully repulsed at the thought of having to attend tonight’s event. He wished he could’ve just stayed home. But his Ma told him to put duty over preference ever since he was a child. He knows what to do.
“Good. Because I’m sure you lot will be seeing each other often enough. James enlightened me of their schedule, it’s much more simillar to yours than Thor’s, Jim’s, or Bruce’s. They’d make splendid partners for you to practice with.” Tony doesn’t know how to feel about that. On one side, he’s more than happy to spend time with Steve and Barnes. What he’s worried about though, is the presence of Howard Stark. Howard is, after all, the two’s coach, even with his shocking absence throughout today’s practice. Tony isn’t sure how his mental stability will fare through extended contact with his asshole of an estranged father. Probably not well.
“Well you know us James have to stick together.” Tony would love to know if all the James’ on tour have a secret society of James or something.
Tony stands on one side of the court, and Steve on the other. “Maybe we could go up to a hundred without dropping? We’d start over every time it drops.”
“At least let me get some ice,” It’s funny how Steve went over to Tony trying to asses disaster and instead he just made more disaster happen.
we’ve actually won- there’s nothing else, Tony. And it’s all because of you- but you can’t-“ Rhodey stops, trying to collect himself.
“Well it’s nice to meet you too, should I also call you Steve’s Tony?” Tony full on laughs at the comment. Oh what a thought.
It’s been awhile, and Steve feels a little tipsy. He’s been minding his own business for a bit now, which it seems is not what most people do at such events. But Steve is not most people. And apparently, the same can be said for prince Anthony, because Steve spots him near the corner of the room, leaning on a wall with a drink in his hands. Steve makes the executive decision of going over to him.
“Speak now or forever hold your silence, Cap,” Tony speaks to him, a smile on his face. And god, Steve wants to kiss him so bad.
“You know for a fact that I do, Tony. Now why are you asking about Steve Rogers?” she sits down next to him, popping a blueberry picked up from Tony’s bowl into her mouth.
“She would put her hands on mine,” Steve feels Tony’s fingers on top of his own, as if guiding him to play. “Like this.” He guides Steve to playing what Steve knows is the beginning notes of Nuvole Bianche, one of Tony’s favorites.
“I promise you, this specific beach is the best. I know it’s a pretty long way but it’s worth it! And we’d get to watch the sunset there!” What Tony wants, Tony gets.
The muscles of Tony’s arms tighten, burning from the now five hour match. He swings. It’s a smash, and it
what a magnificent thing to watch. All week long Tony has gotten a front row look to Rogers’ orgasmic forehand. The way the man plays is exciting to him. After nearly two decades on tour, it’s rare for Tony to face off against something new- against someone new. So really, he’s allowed to be excited for his match, just this time. Not to mention he wants to see the frustration on Howard’s face when he beats Steve Rogers in a few hours. Sadly enough, the news of Steve’s tutelage under Howard has proven to be true and Tony may or may not be just a little bit envious.
So yes, Angie did call Steve into her office. And Steve of course, is going to heed Bucky’s advice. Currently, Steve is sitting down in the Deputy Chief of Staff’s office, waiting. Being the first son, he takes the privilege of being able to walk around the west wing to the fullest and tries to go take a look and study the work they do nearly everyday, really. Seldom does he skip the opportunity to do it when presented.
- Tony called it. And have fun he did, how could he not after winning his Wimbledon debut as an unseeded player. The world of tennis will never be the same, words spoken by John McEnroe as he sees the young man lift his Wimbledon trophy.
“If you have nothing to do, then you might as well draw me,” what Tony doesn’t know is that Steve had been drawing Tony. Steve always draws Tony. Steve has drawn Tony so much to the point where he can create a portrait of Tony from memory and nothing else. Tony doesn’t know that Steve’s sketchbook is littered with drawings of Tony. Tony on the piano, Tony in the workshop, Tony in the beach.!
“I actually met Thor fresh off the junior tour, we’re… friends.” there’s a hesitant pause in Steve’s voice when describing them as ‘friends’.
Post-meal, Tony drives them to a house. Steve suspects that said house is the villa Tony told Steve about last night. He can surely see the charm in it, how it’s not so massive but also not little, how the architecture is brazen enough, classic enough, modern enough. But
A few minutes later Tony grins to himself. Because finally he’s going to serve. Tony’s currently losing the tie break, a real tragedy. But he’s not world no.1 for nothing. No matter how much Tony just absolutely loathes Howard, his father had once been one of the best servers in the world, something that Tony inherited from the old man. So really, he’ll finish this quickly. No problem.
He puts down the bags of groceries on the counter top as soon as he arrives back to the villa. Eggs benedict, he decides, is the way to go. Steve picked up some amazing prosciutto from the market, and he’d like to make amazing use of it, maybe again for a sandwich later on. Tony walks in to the kitchen when Steve was still cooking.
The next thing he knows, they’re on Tony’s private plane on to god knows where. See, another thing about Tony. Tony has a knack for adventure, and that knack for adventure is accompanied by spontaneity. The thing about Tony is, he tries to live life to the fullest, he’s spontaneous in things that he enjoys, spontaneous in making decisions. And Steve loves how this thing about Tony basically contributes to all his other
“You know it’s almost dinner time, maybe we should go get some food? Eat out?” Steve questions hastily.
“Did you read the article they wrote about you in the New York Times?” Pepper brings down her tablet to look at Tony. On another sofa, Tony has his head on Janet’s lap, her hands running a soft stroke through Tony’s hair.
” A soft voice lulls Tony. His mother. “Antonio, mio caro, I’m so proud of you.” to Tony, there is no greater pleasure than being in his mother’s presence.
Angie walks in with a literal bang, smart suit with a pencil skirt, 4-inch-heels and the grace and power of Washington.
“I’m sorry I haven’t visited you since the funeral... I guess it kind of hurts? I don’t know, Tony. God, I’m pretty confused without you here.” He takes a deep breath.
Tony locks his lips on Steve’s, his head tilted a bit. Steve deepens the kiss, expands his arms to hold Tony, pulling him possessively, letting their bodies be in touch with each other. They continue for awhile, eventually parting for a breather.
They landed in London with quite a fanfare. The city is beautiful, and Steve thinks of how much history is present in every little crook of it. He texts Sam a picture of the streets, updating him about their day. Sam sending stickers back to him. Steve never understood the concept behind replying to other people’s messages with just stickers.
that’s what they all say when asked to describe Anthony Stark. Never before has anyone seen a play more beautiful in the juniors than Tony. They wondered if he will continue to grow, if his prowess will continue. And then, the moment came for his ascendancy. At 17 years old he joined the senior tour-
His players are both tennis players, legendary ones. Howard Stark and Maria Carbonell-Stark. A long time ago Tony was born in the middle of a roman summer, he grew up mostly on tour, going to tournaments and meeting other famous players. By age 3 he was picking up a racket and practicing in the lush grass of the Carbonell villa in Naples, the winds of the coastal city hindering the spins of the tennis ball constantly. Looking back to Tony’s childhood, he spent so much of his time travelling on the tour, he can’t imagine a life without it. And so, he made his mind up as a five year old, excitedly telling his mother that he’s going to be a tennis player. Just like mommy and daddy.
Tony plays a familiar tune and it’s a thing of beauty. See another thing about Tony, is that Tony has all these hidden sides to him. Tony as a pianist isn’t really a sight that’s visible a lot of the times, in fact it’s quite the opposite. Steve knows that there’s a music room in the tower, in the Avengers mansion. He knows that it’s never dusty, and that it’s well played. But private. Steve loves the way Tony sits on the piano, his hands flowing with trained grace. The thing about Tony that he loves is how passionate Tony is in expressing himself to the things he does. Steve decides, there’s no better artistry on earth than what Tony Stark holds with his music.
They’re currently in Tony’s Malibu Mansion, which Steve thinks is absolutely glorious and serene. A few days ago Tony basically commandeered Steve on a road trip, enjoying some sights along the way with a clear goal of reaching Malibu. Back in his war times Steve toured the country a little promoting bonds, but that was pretty much the limits of his travels. Being in the 21st century and finally getting to enjoy the things that surround him has certainly been a great highlight of waking up. The other? The other was Tony. Steve can’t really explain how greatly he feels for Tony, he thinks it’s almost poetic for the future and the past to come together, both anchoring each other to stay in the present day. If it’s not obvious enough, Steve has probably been in love with Tony since he first laid eyes on him, the moment he woke up. And Steve wishes he had the nerves to tell Tony how he feels.
Tony and Rhodey, the good friends they are, have rather conflicting tour schedules, meeting only in grand slams and Master 1000 events. Tony thinks that he should enquire Steve for his number, and possibly his tour schedule. Of course he can always just google that but he’d prefer knowing from the man himself. A part of Tony is sure a lot of their schedules line up. Steve’s is tailored by Howard Stark after all, and he and Howard share a few similarities, favorite events in the circuit being some of them. But then again, what need would Steve have for Tony? It’s not like he needs another hitting partner or a spar partner, him and Barnes are practically attached to the hip after all. In his pondering, Tony didn’t realize that Steve had gone past his defense and just scored the final point of their spar. Wonderful.
they are together. They complimented each other perfectly on court. And true to their testament as ‘brothers’, Barnes had disappeared along with Steve after the USO win. He does remember now though, how the two were a common fixture in the men’s doubles world of the grand slams. Tony at the same time also wonders, why they’re not playing doubles together again.
“I’m gonna be honest here Stevie, we have to talk about the incident. I’m not gonna say much but Angie wants to talk to you so, just say yes, okay punk? Try not to be a smart ass,” Steve didn’t need Bucky to tell him that, it’s not as if Steve was actually that reckless. He knows he messed up, and he also knows that he has to make up for it. For him, his mom, and the united states. Whatever it takes.
And speak of the devil, the moment his plane lands, there’s a car. It’s nice, it’s fancy. And he expects nothing less. Tony steps out of the door as he goes down the stares, and the cameras start to flash.
“Oh that? I don’t know, I don’t really like it pep. Makes it sound like I’m doing a complete monopoly of the game or something.” Pepper thinks it’s amusing, so she raises a simple eyebrow to Tony.
That night, they’re just lounging along the couch. Steve with his sketchpad, and Tony with his tablet. They’re sitting in silence, the comfortable kind.
“You had a great season last year- everyone knows. A calendar grand slam, nearly winning everything, really. Did you do anything special? It was quite astonishing wasn’t it? The only way you’d top that would be with a gold medal this summer, I’m sure.” The mention of the gold medal caused immediate cheers for the crowd, obviously people supporting him.
Steve and Barnes leave first, leaving Tony and Jarvis in the practice court. Tony happily concludes that Steve is one of the nicest guys he’s met on tour. The guy was practically acting as if they were best friends after a few hours of actually befriending each other. And heck, Tony doesn’t even mind! He’d love to have a friend like Steve.
Camera flashes penetrates through his eyes, the moment of the two princes of the western world being spluttered in mess have now been immortalized and will make it to the cover of every newspaper, gossip rag, and magazine.
As the hours drone on, Steve gets bored. He kept drawing and drawing and drawing. He listens to music and converses with Tony. But now he’s just looking outside the window, towards the blue skies.
“Well, you’ll also be meeting Barnes so let’s not fixate yourself on Steve too much, wouldn’t want the poor boy to feel excluded.” He’s heard of Barnes before, mostly through second hand stories from Natasha and Rhodey, Rhodey who faced him in Rotterdam and is now in Acapulco.
Waking up the next morning, Steve has a large desire to explore. He runs towards the town, picking up some ingredients in the local market. Tony would appreciate a nice breakfast. Steve admits that he’s not proficient in Italian, in fact it’s probably the opposite. He just doesn’t really understand it, well at least not a lot of words. Knowing latin though, is something he finds really useful in the path of trying to understand what the locals are saying. So he greets some of them the best he can.
“As a matter of fact, he does, yes. It was quite the eruption wasn’t it? Personally I wasn’t informed that my dad basically got another kid until I saw him here.”
to ask Carol out on a date already.” Rhodey gives Tony a questioning look, as if to ask if he’s out of his mind.
Even after three years of this life, Steve still sees it as a marvel. The fact that he’s doing private air travel? Well that’s a luxury he’s never had and he’ll continue to be amazed by everyday.
his title. But it didn’t matter, because Steve Rogers just disappeared after winning one slam. And that’s weird. He knows better than most how the thirst for championships feels like. After you win you never want it to stop. Which is why, whenever a player other than him wins a slam, they’re always categorized under ‘threats’. You never really see what a player is truly capable of until they’re drowned in the glory of winning, full of new determination and thirst.
“Tony.” He starts. It’s still weird, he thinks. To not have a witty response spouting out whenever he spouts out the name. It’s also weird to not hear loud music bleeding out of the workshop at all hours of the day. It’s weird to not see a grumpy non-caffeinated small brunette on the breakfast counter everyday. It’s weird to just not have him here.
“Mr. Stark, no...” Peter takes a deep breath, he can feel his heart racing inside his chest, his pupils blown wide in shock and fear.
“Of course not. The world has to actually think that you two are best friends. Which means that this little arrangement will be going on for quite some time. But as far as everyone can see, it’s been going on since forever, right?”
“You’ve always had this look in your eyes, as if you’re looking down on me. As if I’m not worth you or worth your time. You just- don’t like me”
“Steve.” She sits right across him, posture straightening up. Angie has been working with his mom ever since her senatorial run, she’s like second family to them, almost.
“A story for another time, I think.” Tony thinks he just fucked things up after only becoming friends with him this morning. Way to go Stark. “I’m not mad at the question, Tony. You can relax.” and Steve smiles at him, again. Steve seems to do that a lot, smiling at people. And it’s fucking contagious.
Tony and Steve goes back to the mansion with their stomachs full, and Tony takes Steve for an official tour of the house.
smoke surrounds him as he steps out to the deafening cheers of his fans, waving at them on the way to his bench. He sets down the bag and takes out the rackets, unwrapping his first one and going to the court, shaking hands and taking a picture with the coin tosser, picking his side of the coin.
“All by yourself?” There’s a body next to Tony now, sitting down instead of lying down, her face floats above Tony.
“Then call me Tony.” he replies. Oh god he’s on a first name basis with Steve Rogers. Why is he freaking out about this?
“I mean, I certainly wouldn’t mind it. He’s a great player. This was of course our first match against each other and I’ve been pleasantly surprised by his quality of play.”
“He chaperoned- coached us. The US team. Brought two players who we thought were dead, basically.” Tony couldn’t think of anyone who fitted the description. For you to be thought dead… well, that’s a lot of time off, is it not?
That night, when Steve went to bed, he can’t stop thinking about Tony. He keeps remembering how beautiful Tony looks, how enchanting Tony is. And what Steve realizes is that for awhile now, his mind has been occupied and taken control of by Tony Stark. And Steve thinks, there’s a beauty in that.
Steve puts down his sketchpad at the sound of Tony’s high pitched yelp. He closes the sketchpad and places it on the sofa, noticing the charcoal stains on his hand. Steve then walks through the workshop in search of Tony. Usually, Tony is always in Steve’s line of sight when he works, an absolutely perfect time to capture the beauty that is Tony Stark. But earlier Tony did say something about working on one of his cars, so perhaps he’s in the other part of the workshop.
“...the main reception starts at 19.00, the reveal will be done there. Madam president you will shake hands with King Howard as a sign of officiating a new step in U.S-England diplomatic relationship.” Angie drones on and on about their agendas, and Steve is getting tired of listening. He knows that he just has to behave, sit tight, be pretty, be nice, and waste taxpayer’s money on a useless ceremonial role in which the monarchy is.
“I’d like to think you’re wrong. I’ve been nothing but civil, every time. Perhaps you’re just overthinking it. And I really would suggest a tad bit of a break for you,”
“I’m so sorry. I’m sorry I didn’t visit, I’m sorry I couldn’t take care of your friends, I’m sorry I couldn’t save you, I’m so sorry”
“I miss you, I miss your addiction to coffee, I miss going on picnics in central park and trying to hide from bystanders, I miss going out for burgers and drawing in your workshop until it’s late. I miss how you’d just spout out ideas for your inventions to me even if I can barely understand half of it, I miss your voice, I miss talking to you. God, I just miss you and your entire being, Tony.”
“What are you gonna call him?” Steve piques at this, that doesn’t make sense. Clearly his name is right there? Is he supposed to call him bro?
There’s a private airstrip in Heathrow London, that same chunk of land is what Steve is seeing as the plane begins its ascend. And then, it’s off to the city. Steve’s personal security detail includes agents such as Dugan, or, affectionately known as Dum Dum, who’s currently drawing his schedule list.
It’s always the same. Inhale, bounce three times, throw, hit. First ball. It slices through the air at breakneck speed, he knows where it’ll land. An ace. Tony throws again, and when he hits it with a bang, you can barely see the ball. Another ace. The crowd erupts. Across from Tony, Steve Rogers has the tip of his feet twisting on the baseline. Tony grins. Again, he throws overhead, a perfect parabola, the ball is waiting for contact. Three in a row. Steve Rogers is sweating now, they’re at eight to eight after all, who wouldn’t be nervous. It’s cute how the blonde’s eyebrows scrunch up in concentration. Tony inhales, and then he exhales. Sometimes calming himself down is necessary, he’d hate for this to go into another long rally, not when he’s so close to the match point. So when he swings at time with his jump, the ball flies yet again. Superb.
“Funny. You said that the last time too, the difference is I won this time.” Steve, hands and body drenched with sweat, walks with him to where Jarvis and Bucky are passed out on the sidelines.
“What was that all about anyways? Disappearing in the height of glory?” Tony sees Steve frown and his face twist in sourness. Fuck. Okay, don’t mention the disappearing thing.
“Okay brat, it’s time for a pop quiz.” Bucky flops onto Steve’s bed automatically lying down and opening the file. “Answer correctly, and you’ll get a sour patch, Answer wrongly, and I get a sour patch.”
And something that he’s newly fell in love with, what he hopes he can continue to love is the way Tony feels in his arms, the way Tony’s lips sync with his. And Steve decides, this time, that this moment isn’t the moment he wants to stay in forever, this place isn’t where he wants to stay forever. Because, what matters, what his constant is- is who he’s with, and that’s Tony. So Steve concludes, that no matter when and no matter where, if Tony is there, that’s where he wants to be. And that includes the past, the present, and the future, an eternity of Tony.
They go to the beach on foot, walking down the pathways until they arrive. And once they’re there, a blanket was laid on the sand and they sit together, enjoying mocktails and making small talk. Another thing about Tony, whenever he talks, his eyes seem to sparkle in excitement. Steve enjoys every moment of Tony geeking out about a mythology, or arthurian legend, or anything. His body language when he goes on ‘nerd rants’ isn’t one visible to members of the public, and it makes Steve feel special. They talk of travelling the world, that the next step should probably be more exploration.
“He requested you for practice with Steve Rogers and James Barnes. And seeing as you’ve always been enthusiastic by the prospect of Steve Rogers, I took the liberty of accepting.” Tony blushes at Jarvis’ comment on Tony’s fixation on Steve.
“No it’s just I have a James of my own at home, might’ve met him a few times. Pretty tall, handsome, grouchy, and pretty overall cuddly. A ten out of ten James, really.” he sees Barnes smiling at that, Steve is just bashfully laughing.
“Steve! Come over here!” Tony is actually turned towards him now, yelling at him to of course step foot into the water. So he sets down his sketchpad and abandons his sandals, walking softly towards Tony.
Steve tries to make a list in his head, what exactly would be the benefits of him going to London and pretending to be friends with a guy he hates, a guy who hates him. First of all, he’ll get out of the bad books of the entire west wing. Second of all, he won’t jeopardize us-uk relations which could be dangerous for the future? He sees absolutely no reason as to why he should refrain from going.
, the entire reason why Peter is even standing here, he’s gone. His mentor, as a hero, as an inventor, as a person. He’ll trade anything just to see the lifeless body he’s holding in his arms rustle- to see his body move, any sign of life from him, because Peter can’t lose him, not anymore. Not again. The world needs him- the world needs Mr. Stark. Peter needs him.
“Well I could always use a good hitting partner, Rhodes seems to be ditching me for other players lately.” Tony laughs good-naturedly. He can see Rhodey rolling his eyes in Tony’s box, and Tony just waves at him joyfully. “I love you platypus.” he says into the mic.
“In the flesh.” In his early years of being world number one there was a player that stood out. Steve Rogers. They called him a challenger to Tony’s reign. Rogers started the circuit pretty old, at 20. Even won a slam, what they thought was his only. Steve Rogers won his first grand slam in the 2014 US Open, without the presence of Tony Stark, its defending champion. After a loss at the world tour finals, the tennis world just saw him disappear. They haven’t heard from him in what now? 5 years? In tennis, that’s the length of an entire generation.
“Are you being cheeky with me? That should be illegal.” Tony lays down, going into a pose “Come on Steve, draw me like one of your french girls.” Steve rolls his eyes at his antics, but he draws Tony in that exact pose anyways.
“And then we’d laugh, and she’d cook.” Tony seems to drift for awhile, a small smile on his face, almost sad.
Another thing about Tony, he cleans up nice. Always. Everything he wears never fail too look amazing and no matter what Tony does, Tony will never look anything less than perfect. Steve feels subpar next to Tony, Tony and his bellowing charms, Tony and his perfect face.  So he stares, maybe too much to the point that it should be suspicious, but Tony never notices. Or he’ll bask in the attention Steve gives him.
his aces, especially at the beginning of the match. They both turn to the baseline, Tony picking up the balls, putting one in his pocket. He kneels down, bouncing the ball-
He looks for Tony to find him ankles deep along the shore lines, the waves of water softly tickling his feet. Steve smiles at the sight. He lays down the blanket, setting down the basket containing their food in the middle of it, and takes out his sketchpad. Steve draws Tony. He draws Tony in the ocean, his hair being swept by the wind. He draws Tony facing towards him, a wide smile on his face, his hands reaching out towards the world. Steve likes to draw Tony happy.
“I know that. But, you two are supposed to be best friends, right? You can’t call him Anthony or prince Anthony?”
“Give everything a try, for me.” And what Tony wants, Tony gets. Steve enjoys everything on the table, loves how the sauces and the fillings melt in his mouth. What Steve also loves, is his dinner partner. Tony has taken the role of tour guide with a child like glee. He guides Steve through the dishes, explains each of them to Steve as if they were the most familiar things on earth, and again, Steve can’t help but marvel at that.
. Tony sees his opponent’s eyes flash with instant recognition of the misstep, ready to return the serve. When the ball makes contact with Rogers’ racket, he realizes where the ball is going-
“I didn’t know he was back. Did you?” Tony inquired to Pepper. A stupid thing to ask, really. Of course Pepper knows. Pepper Potts is undoubtedly the industry’s best agent. She knows everything.
“So Tony, how was Steve?” John leans the mic to Tony’s mouth. “Oh, I think we had a rather great time, even took him to his bench and everything at the end.” the crowd laughs. “Shame you couldn’t have closed it with a kiss- though I reckon five aces in a row beats that.” The crowd cheers at the mention of his game ending run. “I don’t know if it’d beat that, John. But you know what? It surely did beat him” Tony chuckles. He enjoys being a cheeky little shit.
Celebration is always a pleasant thing. But really, after everything is over. There’s nothing more. There’s another trophy on his shelf, a different digit in his bank account, and more numbers to his name. But at the end of the day, he’s alone again. And that sucks. Two fingers of his finest scotch will be poured, as always. The beautiful tune of fingers dancing on ivory. He clinks the glass onto his window overlooking central park. Tonight, he is alone. But tonight, he toasts with the whole city, where the dancing lights of new york joins his celebration. Even if for a short moment only, he feels less alone then.
“Always a pleasure playing with you, Anthony. Now I’m afraid I must go and take a look at my brother, he seems to be in a particularly foul mood.” Thor’s brother is none other than Loki Odinson, a lot younger than Thor at 26, a player of amazing speed and a lot of tricks up his sleeve. The name Loki is one fitting of him.
As soon as he was capable, he was equipped with a coach. Edwin Jarvis was his, a legend in british tennis- one would be after finally bringing home Wimbledon to the brits. Jarvis to Tony was everything he ever needed, a coach, a mentor and eventually,
Dinner is a lovely affair. There’s Pepper, Janet, Jarvis-- accompanied by his wife Ana, and Maria, Tony’s mom. Homecooked fresh seafood and pasta littered their table. And in one of the chairs stood a cellphone with the face of James Rhodes on it, standing on top of books. This is Tony’s family- barring a few other missing occupants. Tony and Janet are discussing her clothing line, how she wants to broach into the men’s section and wants Tony as its face. Janet Van Dyne is a great tennis player- but she also has a penchant for fashion, one would have, to design every single one of her on-court outfits.
“Didn’t know you were still here Steve-o,” He crouches down to escape the hood of the car only to be met with said hood falling down on his head.
“What about a night in instead? Order us some takeout and we’ll binge the Merlin tv show,” what Tony wants, Tony gets has always been a big hole in his resolve. Maybe they can do the whole dinner and walk in the park thing back in New York.
“I think everyone knows him, the same way everyone knows you.” Tony ignores the last part of the comment, surely Steve knew that Tony meant as friends.
All in all, he’d make a bet to himself, try not to drop a set through the entire tournament. Win it again, and then get ready for the sunshine double. He reckons that his friends will stand in the way of him defending all of his titles from last year. Heck he’s already giving up one by not doing Monte Carlo, choosing instead to start clay season a bit later into April. Tony’s currently more focused on the gold though. He doesn’t have a men’s singles gold medal, and he can’t retire completely happy without it belonging to him, not a single chance. He’ll have quite the fight for gold this year, probably, seeing as this would be the last olympic games for a lot of them. Possibly him, possibly Rhodey, possibly Thor. For a moment he entertains the thought of him playing in the 2024 olympics at 36 years old. Play it, yes. Win it? Unlikely. Steve is right, he
The next morning, he wakes early. He changes into running gear and runs along the beach tracks. Steve hears the sound of folding waves and roaring seagulls accompanying his run, the warm sea breeze a nice change from the usually chilly New York. Steve gets back to the mansion to ready breakfast for them both, easily crafting a coffee towards Tony’s preferences, and some french toast to accompany it. Now, all he has to do is wait until Tony exits his bedroom, and then they can eat together, preferably in the patio whilst enjoying the true ocean view the mansion provides them with.
“Good morning Anthony, how are you feeling today?” Tony smiles at the british voice, the man it belongs to is sitting on the table littered with breakfast foods, a cup of tea in his hands.
“Catch me if you can!” He can hear the smirk in Tony’s voice and again he decides, there’s nowhere else they’d rather be.
.” And if it’s true that Howard is Steve’s coach well, that certainly would hurt. Howard Stark is always stuck in the opinion that no one is as good as him, that no one will ever be able to fulfill his expectations, which was his reason for not wanting to coach anyone. So why would Howard of all people- coach the disappearing act of Steve Rogers? Nothing about it makes a single sense. Nothing. His father’s time has always been ‘precious’ as Howard likes to dub it. He couldn’t even dedicate a little bit of time to his son in the past thirty or so odd-years and now he’s suddenly committing himself to another player?
“Well good thing I have good old capsicle here with me,” Steve rolls his eyes. He goes over to Tony and looks at his face, raising his eyebrows. Steve then impulsively lent out his hand to rub at Tony’s head.
Steve can see Tony smiling softly as if reminiscing something from his past “Just a little something my mama taught me,”
“Anyways- I don’t remember doing practice today? It doesn’t say so in the spreadsheet either.” he remarks whilst taking a bite of his croissant.
“But I don’t know, Tony. I miss you, I miss you a lot. And I can’t help but think everyday that well... maybe it wasn’t worth it. All of it.”
He watches Anthony and Natasha dance in the ballroom. He also sees the photographers lining up to take pictures of the two. He summarizes, Natasha is an amazing dancer, Anthony is... just using her for attention. And there’s a chance it might have set him off.
Tony Stark finally rejoins the tour for the Australian Open. First seed and defending champion, and the ultimate favorite to win. Currently though, he’s enjoying a cup of coffee with his best friend. Australia makes splendid coffee, and it’s in his job as a worshiper of the drink to explore Australia’s finest shops. Well, Melbourne’s finest shops. Rhodey catches him up with the gossip that he missed during the newly held ATP Cup. Personally, Tony skipped out on the ATP Cup, preferring its previous Hopman Cup. Rhodey is currently fourth seed, he and Tony are on opposite sides of the bracket, unlikely to meet and play against each other in the Rod Laver Arena. Well except the possibility of a finals between them.
“Let’s stop here,” and so they come to a halt, their secret service agents stopping right with them.
Tony thinks for a bit. Barton, he doesn’t mind, they’ve known each other for pretty long and are somewhat friends. Rogers and Barnes… well Tony isn’t really feeling like answering too many questions or pandering tonight. Heck he doesn’t even know why they’re still in Melbourne. Barnes went out in the third round, and Rogers against him in the round of 16.
“I’m honestly not surprised, with my whole… disappearing thing.” Right. Steve Rogers was dead to the tennis world for years.
He takes a deep breath next. Tony knows for a fact that Rogers makes superb returns, he’d like to see it. But not unless necessary. He lowers down again, bounces the ball-
“Whatcha thinking about punk?” Bucky bumps Steve’s shoulder, getting a response of a dirty look from Steve.
didn’t look tired during his four-set fourth round match against Barton. That orgasmic forehand of his will be, without a doubt, a threat when coupled with his stamina and that speed. Tony won’t be surprised if the match goes on for quite awhile. After a chorus of good lucks, Tony rechecks his shoes once more, saddling his bag and preparing to go out. He jumps his legs up and down a little in the tunnel and finally-
“Second corridor on the left, I’m sorry, Rhodey. I really am” Steve looks down on the floor, unable to look at Rhodes in the eyes.
“Fault!” one of the line umpires called the shot. Tony rarely makes a fault, and he simply just wouldn’t ever make one when it comes to an important point. Tony raises his hand, calling the chair umpire for a challenge.
“Because, you mucked up. And, the royal family are already going here for the state dinner in a few months.”
“To another one, and many more to come.” The amber liquid evaporates in one straight smooth gulp. The tumblr bumps on the marble countertop he lays it on. Now, he rests.
“I’d like to congratulate you on the win once again, I suppose they don’t call you Iron Man for nothing, your stamina has more than tripled this season, my friend.” Thor laughs loudly.
Steve closes their lips together again, this time softer, and he feels how plush Tony’s lips are, the way they’re starting to go redder as they continue to kiss. Steve can see the continuously reddening blush on Tony’s cheeks. This time, when they part, it’s with a smile. And Steve… Steve just holds Tony there, for awhile. Until Tony escapes his hold, running ahead and splashing Steve with some saltwater.
Steve cleans up as they finish, Tony leaving with the promise of ‘The most fantastic beach day out’ an optimistic step in his legs as he walks back to his room, maybe to shower. And wow, imagining Tony naked in the shower, he decides, shouldn’t be a regular thing.
“Don’t be stupid Barnes-“ Natasha was cut off to the announcement of the entrance of the prince. Stupid, annoying, prince Anthony. Who not only is late, but is also strutting arrogance with a goddamn burgundy suit. It almost makes his blood boil.
Tony knew for a fact that Steve and James are close, he’d guess that their relationship is pretty similar to those of him and Rhodey. Brothers. Though he can’t hold the same statement when it comes to brothers on court. He’s seen Steve play doubles with Barnes, and he’s seen just how explicitly
“Rogers is in your bracket, you’re not really projected to meet, though.” Tony is disappointed at this, if only a little. He admired Steve’s play through 2011-2014. But they didn’t meet on court, ever. He
“Steve Rogers.” Tony says to Pepper the moment she enters the sitting room of the hotel suite. Pepper of course, looks down to Tony- “What about Steve Rogers?” she quirks at him.
“Come on,” Tony jumps out of the car and bangs on the sides of the door a little, running ahead of Steve towards the beach. Steve, being the adult he is, unpacks the blankets and some sandwiches from the trunk of the car. Sand isn’t always nice, and they’re probably going to get hungry.
“Look, the sun’s starting to set.” It’s as if the Sun is setting behind the town, illuminating the entire community. And it’s a perfect angle from where they’re at.
“Throw me.” Steve sits down on one of Bucky’s bean bags, his obsession with them is definitely startling. The thing about Bucky is, he’s very different from Steve. As soon as he turned 18, Bucky enlisted in the army. He lost an arm in combat on his second tour and was honorably discharged, at the time it broke his Ma’s heart incredibly. Now, Bucky’s all better. He has his prosthetic and hey, Bucky bitches about it all the time but he’s pretty sure it’s a coping mechanism. But Bucky is doing great. He’s been dubbed a style icon or something like that by everyone. And he adores it.
“Mr. Stark please... please don’t go” he begs, kneeling down next to the body of the man he sees as his mentor, his hero, his father.
“Why of course, my darling.” And Tony leads them to the patio. Under the morning sun, Tony is basically gleaming. His eyes are reflecting the sun’s light, his talking seemingly even more illuminating. Tony’s hair is always a mess in the morning, there’s never a haphazard attempt to put himself together when in between those closest to him is a great trait of Tony that Steve has been honored to learn about firsthand through experience.
“So here you have someone branded as a musical genius who’s a british stereotype and according to you... boring?” Bucky closes the file, his eyebrows raised.
What’s funny is, Tony never heard Thor talk about Steve. Not during Steve’s early career days when Tony was enamored by the thought of Steve Rogers, and not recently after Steve’s return even with Tony’s outright admiration for the player. Tony hopes that Thor never mentioned his past and maybe even present obsession with Steve, he doesn’t know how to escape the awkwardness of that conversation.
“What was he doing there?” This was the first time Tony’s heard of it. To be honest he hasn’t kept in contact with anyone during the off-season. Let alone tune in to watch live matches.
“Relax, I picked something out. And it’s been approved and everything too!” Steve says. “Anyways, what’s up in your tabloids this week?” He asks Bucky out of curiosity. It’s always interesting to know what people are talking about, especially if it’s about him. It’s not narcissism or anything, he’d just prefer to be aware.
“Am I just not pretty enough to be a subject of your drawings, Steve?” If only Tony knew. “You probably think a fruit bowl is prettier than me,”
Tony doesn’t talk about his youth a lot, but he found there are three constants in the stories that he tell, the story he knows. The Jarvis’, James Rhodes, and Maria Stark. He knows that they are the people Tony has always kept close to his heart. The ones he can’t stop to remember when he cooks, when he talks legends with Steve, when he’s on the piano.
The next morning, Steve continues with his routine. He gets into his running gear and he runs along the trails. He again, enjoys the sounds of the waves and the seagulls. He basks in the morning glory of the beach. When returning to the mansion, he’s surprised to see Tony already awake and tapping away on his tablet.
instances!” Rhodey raises his eyebrows at Tony, how would losing a grand slam be winning, exactly? “Oh you know what I mean! You
Steve knows that amongst all the things that Tony is, the one he has most struggled with is allowing his ability to not be ashamed of who he is shine through. The thing Steve hates about Tony, is how insecure he can get when it comes to it. He’d like to hug Tony, assure him with every single compliment and words of reassurance known to men, and perhaps even more. Because, Steve Rogers truly loves for Tony Stark, to unashamedly be Tony Stark.
Sorry for this overdue chapter! I might post another one today or tomorrow to make up for it tho! I hope you enjoy it!
“After marrying Howard, my mom never really had anything of her own anymore… but there was always this. It’s basically her paradise. She’d pick some fruits and vegetables from the garden, even built a birdhouse.”
“So- we’d see more of you and Steve in the future, perhaps? You two seem to be good buddies already.”
They ate and they laughed, and Tony talks of his experiences in Mexico and how he’s going to take Steve there the next time they get the chance to roam free from their duties again.
“I didn’t get to tell you so many things, you know? How sorry I am, how much of a jackass I am, how much you mean to me,”
“I just think he’s interesting, that’s all.” As a matter of fact, Tony had watched every single one of Steve’s matches on television post Australian Open. Jarvis rolls his eyes.
The white house is grand. White tall pillars, green grass, tennis courts. The white house is also a cage. It’s gated for everyone to see, an attraction for people to lurk. People always remarks to him, they ask him, what is it like to live in a place of history?
The Avengers are there to avenge in the cases of lost, practiced to the dot by Tony, by the whole team. More than that, the Avengers was an idea- it will forever be, there to protect the world, to be earth’s shield. In the name of earth, in the name of loss, now- in the name of earth’s greatest defender, the golden avenger, Iron Man. Tony Stark- his best friend, the little scrawny rascal from college who didn’t even know how to use a washing machine properly, who slept in class and worked all hours of the day outside of it. He sacrificed it all- for a world that is undeserving of him.
The loud guitar of AC/DC is a constant in his ears before a match. Soon, he’ll take them off, get a chorus of good luck’s from his magnificent team, and head out to kick ass. He has no doubt that he’ll win- a player never goes into a match thinking they’ll lose after all. Rogers is not only younger, but he probably has one of the best stamina in the entire tour. Rogers went through a whopping amount of three five-setters but he
he pointed out to them both that Steve had, for a fact, broken his winning streak in the US Open. They pointed out that Tony was absent from the tournament, unable to actually
Tony sends her back a few thumbs ups, replying with his own good luck to her. His hotel isn’t far, and he decides to walk there. He puts on his hat and quietly exits the arena, hoping no one would notice him. He subtly remembers that Pepper went ahead without him, muttering something about a press conference. So he’ll be walking alone. And as he walked, his anticipation for the finals didn’t recede. He thinks back to his semi-final match with Parker. The kid is ten years his junior and wasn’t really the best match for him. It pales in comparisson to his quarter finals match against Rogers. He remembers how excitedly people reacted post his match with Steve- how they were all excited that Tony could finally show off his skills properly against someone. A possible challenger.
“I mean, I think I’ll provide you with a bit of a challenge, for one.” Tony knows the truth of the statement. Steve will be a challenge, that’s why he’s categorized under ‘threats’ by Jarvis and Pepper.
man. His coach. Jarvis has known Tony since ‘before he was even in knickers’ as the man usually puts it. Jarvis, for better or worse, has practically raised him for just about the longest time. Personally, Tony can’t imagine what his life would look like without his guidance.
The thing about Tony Stark, there’s so much to him. Tony is a genius, an artist, a lover. Tony likes adventures, and he enjoys tales of knights and dragons. What Steve loves about Tony Stark, is none other than Tony Stark himself. Everything about him, everything that comes with. Steve Rogers is in love with whatever Tony Stark is, and whatever he’ll be. And that’s nothing that can be stopped. Because a thing about Tony Stark, is how lovable he is, how amazingly himself he is, and just how eternally
“But they aren’t like you.” Tony grins at that, but he also raises his eyebrow. This conversation usually happens the other way around. And so, the way it’s laid out now is a little absurd to him.
Speaking of his new friends, Tony realizes that he may or may not have made a slight misjudgment of their characters. He remembers the night after Rhodey’s semifinal and his refusal to hang out with two pairs of wonder twins (read: Barton-Romanoff, Barnes-Rogers). Stating annoyance to the possible incessant questioning. When taking account of today’s interactions, it’s more like Steve has been the subject to his incessant questioning, not the other way around. Maybe if he said yes that night, they’d be good friends by now? what a thought. No use in pondering on the past. Back to today. In Dubai. In the beginning of the tennis championships.
“You can’t see it for yourself, you can’t enjoy any of it. And that’s just not fair, you know? You deserve it, more than any of us” Rhodey looks down to find his hands shaking, and wipes his face to find tears running down his cheeks.
“It’s sweet of you to worry Cap, but i’m not dying or passed out, isn’t that enough?” Tony is holding the ice pack with his own hand now, his and Steve’s hands basically brushing in the process. Once Steve removes his hand from Tony’s head, Tony immediately stands back up seemingly starting to go back to work.
created with that thought in mind after all. He muses on whether or not Steve and he will play each other again in the next few days. Of course it all depends on their brackets and opponents. He’s not going against Steve in the first round though, that’s for sure.
“Oh yeah, Howard said we should just start along? He says Mr. Jarvis would be able to walk us through some serving and hitting practices.” Tony sees Jarvis nods at that.
-subtly Tony can hear the cheers of everyone in the arena but he’s too focused on getting that last goddamn point. Right. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. He bounces the ball,
“I wish I’d known her more too.” He can feel Tony frowning. “Let’s settle in.” Tony makes a motion of grabbing his travel bag, slinging it over his shoulders and entering the villa. And Steve follows.
“Anthony, why don’t you and Steve trade volleys with each other, I had heard Mr. Rogers isn’t quite strong at that. And now you, Mr. Barnes, why don’t we talk about your serve? I believe it to be splendid, but there’s always room for improvement.” The three players nod at Jarvis like a triplet of five year olds. Tony unzips his bag for his racket, taking a couple of balls and putting two in his pocket.
“But I- Mr. Stark please” he’s scared, he’s so scared. He just got back, they just got back. Why is the price to pay so high? life and death- they synergies, and together they take, and take, and take. And he’s so tired of it.
The grass is crisp, the wind is just the right kind of a subtle breeze, and he decides that today is the day. He’s going to visit him. And so he walks, slow and hesitant, still afraid to face the truth of what will lie before him when he meets his destination.
. And in that moment, he feels as if he has been slapped in the face by the Hulk, and more than ever Rhodey wishes this is some cruel joke Tony is playing and that he’ll walk into the room making a remark on how stupid Rhodey is to even for a moment Tony could just die like that- die that easily. But no, it’s real. Anthony Edward Stark, his best friend, is
But it was more than that. When he was young he viewed the prince of England as someone he wanted to be. Anthony was amazing. He was charming and smart. But also, everyone loved and adored him. But then, then he had to ruin it by being a total dick towards Steve. And well- it’s just meant to be. They’re supposed to be natural born enemies. Steve was as close to what America could call royalty, and Tony, well- he’s the prince of England. It’s like they’re arch nemesis’s that are just destined.
Later on in the comfort of his hotel room, Tony broaches the topic of Steve Rogers with Pepper. She’s his agent after all. She’ll probably know everything that concerns him, anything that threatens him, his opportunities. Tony isn’t sure yet where Steve Rogers will fall in the category of his ‘things’. Back in the day, Pepper and Jarvis convinced him to not pay Rogers too much mind, not yet, he hadn’t warranted it yet.
Tony’s pick, as it turns out, was a quaint mexican restaurant along the coast. They go through the whole menu, their table filled to the brim with food, food that even Tony himself has never even tried previously. And that’s another thing about Tony. Tony is adventurous, he loves new things and new experiences. From travelling the world to trying new cuisine, Tony has never been shy with his curiosity. Ever. And the way Tony admires new things is unique on its own, he’s never seen someone so excited for an adventure.
Steve’s thumb reaches out, wiping the tears. His finger lingers there for awhile, and he decides that Steve doesn’t want to see Tony sad, ever again. And he won’t let Tony be sad, not if he has anything to say about it.
After the one hundred vollleys, they did some more hitting practice, trading partners. On top of that, Steve and Tony decided to do a small one set sparring match, Barnes opting out on grounds of tiredness. Jarvis did a number on him. Tony enjoys playing Steve very much, and without the burden of having to win, he played much more relaxingly, occasionally letting Steve score a point pass him on purpose. He hasn’t had a pro- well aside from Jarvis, to practice with for a while now, with Rhodey, Janet, Carol, Natasha, Thor and a variety of his friends on their respective tours.
As if it were yesterday again, food started to fill the table. Different assortments of pasta, shapes and varieties  he sure didn’t know about before.
Tony doesn’t know how Jarvis will manage that, there’s no reason for Howard to relinquish a few hours of his mentees time to play around with Tony after all. He accepts the comforting thought anyway. Even if, Tony can be
“God- I’m sorry, I- I gotta go” Steve hurriedly stands up, patting some grass that stuck to his jeans. He turned around and takes a deep breath as he’s about to leave.
“Sweetie you’re not thinking of retirement again, are you?” he rolls his eyes and gets up, curling his knees to his chest. The outdoor air is chilly.
“There’s some bullshit about you on page 10, and I’m on the cover again.” Bucky looks smug. And that’s because they have a bet that Bucky will be featured on the cover of a tabloid in a month’s time or not, but that was two weeks ago. Now, Steve is two alexander hamilton’s short in his wallet.
“Your father told me he has business in Switzerland this weekend,” Maria looked apologetic, but both occupants of the conversation knew it wasn’t her fault. Howard Stark is, after all, a dick.
“You know what’s funny? Thor never really mentioned knowing you to me.” Tony hopes that it’s not the wrong thing to say. He’d hate to offend Steve.
. Perhaps now the commentators, the millions watching the match through television, the entire arena is yelling. But Tony hears nothing aside from his own voice, the way it erupts. Tony kneels on the hard courts of New York, and he wants to cry. The arena is still filled with gracious cheers when Tony stands back up. In front of them, history has just been made. The two players come forward to the net, shaking their hands and trading a congratulatory hug. Tony Stark sits down on his bench, his body is almost shaking with disbelief. He rubs a towel to his face, takes the effort to put on his full tracksuit set. He waves towards the crowds in his jacket, his face practically glowing from the historical win. And a little later on, when he kisses the U.S Open trophy for the 6th time in his career, when he holds his fourth grand slam trophy of the year, it all settles in Tony. There’s glory, and his chest is practically swelling with pride. There probably isn’t another happier man alive than Tony Stark right at that moment. He had just won four grand slams in one year, completing the sunshine double. There’s also Italy. Monte Carlo. Cincinnati. A few more here and there. And with there only being so few tournaments after the US Open he is guaranteed for year end number one for the fifth year in a row. The longest streak ever.
. Entrusting a child with the brand gifted is oftentimes a mistake, it pressures them, it sinks them, it destroys them. But the same can’t be said for Tony Stark. The minute he joined the junior tour, all hell broke loose.
He walks back in and inspects his room, the grey walls and plus carpeting. And he wonders if he’ll leave the place in just about a year or not. Only time will tell. Steve also notices something else, and that’s the fact that he’s starved. Being starved in the white house could mean stealing something from the kitchens. But Steve is not an expert with that, thankfully though,
The length of the rally was 16 shots- Tony counted. Not bad. His careful observation from the days previous marked Rogers as a mostly baseline player, rarely engaging in volleys. Or any net game, really. That surprised him a little, Howard has always been a serve and volley player after all. Back to the present day. Tony won the opening set six to three, in what resulted to be a pretty long set. Right now, he’s the humble subject of his opponents serve as he observes the blonde’s first ace of the match. Not a serve and volley player at all, it seems. As it looks, the second set is pretty tight, The blonde is leading right now, but just barely. It’s their fourth deuce at five to six, but after that ace, Steve has the advantage, and Tony’s afraid that Steve might just take the set. Long match indeed.
And then there was a comfortable silence between them. Steve wants nothing more than to kiss Tony. To caress him and hold him tightly in his arms. There’s no where he’d rather be than here, with Tony’s shirt half undone and the glaring sun above them. His thoughts are interrupted when Tony pushes Steve into the sand.
“If you share all the time I’m sure Thor and Rhodes would have at least five more majors each- not that Thor is doing badly, anyways.”
“I fucking hate him Buck. He’s so arrogant and just- I want to punch him every single time I see him.”
At this point, he’s come to the conclusion that the prince is the most boring person ever. Literally, ever.
like to dramatically recite his wins and losses and ‘beautiful encounters’ with Tony when given the room. He loves the guy.
“This is the library, of course. It’s probably one of my favorite libraries, and I feel like you’d love it too.” Tony isn’t wrong, Steve does love it. The library, just like most of the house, overlooks the ocean. It’s peaceful. It’s quiet. The pair walks through it, Tony going so far as showing Steve his figure collection. And again, Steve thinks, he’d give anything to be able to always see Tony like this.
? He’s always bitching about travelling to my tournaments as an excuse. And now- the one time I’m in New York he just fucks off to the Swiss alps?”
“Oh fucking christ. Perfect.” Steve isn’t surprised to find Tony as the source of the cursing. His suit and hair a mess and face clearly frustrating, frozen in spot for seconds.
friends. Rhodey and Thor, his two closest compatriots, are close to him in rankings, always minimizing the chances that they meet. Sure they hang out outside the tournament itself, but it’s getting rare and rare becase again- their match days don’t usually coincide, meaning one is always busy when one is not- and vice versa. Right now, Steve Rogers is low enough in the rankings to warrant more meetings with Tony, the draw
“Steve, nice to see you.” The prince flashes him a smile, offering Steve a hand to shake. At this moment, the proper thing would be to shake his hand, but hey, what are formalities between best friends? He grabs Tony’s hand and pulls Tony into a hug, earning a gasp and a shocked look from Tony. So he does have emotions after all.
“Kid...” Tony grunts out, bloody hand reaching out to brush Peter’s cheeks. “Don’t cry... you’ll be fine”
“You know what? Fine. If he wants to take another one of his broken pet projects he can fuck off. Why don’t we go celebrate instead mama? Rhodey and Pepper are waiting, and I’m sure we can ask Janet to tag along if you’d like.” No frowns, no anger. Smiles only from this point on. It’s not like Tony needs Howard’s approval anyways. His career has long surpassed his father’s by light years. Howard Stark could only hope to be remembered as Anthony Stark’s father and nothing more.
Currently, the walls of his room isn’t entertaining. Actually, it never has been entertaining. Steve has been thinking about the file in his hands for the past few minutes now. He also thinks about the fact that a similar file with a similar list is currently in the hands of someone way across the pond. So, with them being in the same predicament, well, Steve just knows he’ll do it better.
See another thing about Tony, is how unashamed he can be sometimes. Steve thinks that Tony is bold, a lot of times uncaring of what others around him think about him. And sure, sometimes it can take a turn for the worse, and people may brand it as stubbornness. But honestly, this thing about Tony that Steve loves is just how unashamedly Tony, Tony can be. He loves how unafraid he is to let himself be free, yet stay guarded at the same time. Steve loves the way Tony isn’t ashamed of enjoying great pleasures, loves the way Tony has never been ashamed to be himself- well, not anymore.
