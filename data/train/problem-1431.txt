Sherlock didn't have long to miss the contact because they finally arrived back at home. He paid for the cab this time and the two went inside together.
Sherlock grinned at Brown. "Oh I don't think he'll be going anywhere."
"Stay?"
Different horror scenarios played out in his head uninvited.
"Goodnight John."
The taller boy jerked around to look at him while the other ='s smile wiltered slightly. "WHo're you?
Lestrade waved him and John into the room, but didn't send in an officer for security. He knew John had that covered.
"Yes. That's why I'm frustrated, John. Our man has more than one brain cell apparently. He must have used one of those random character generators for the password, because it certainly has nothing to do with his life."
John groaned, "What time is it?"
Sherlock twitched away at the temperate then pressed back against John’s fingers.
"In other words, I can take care of myself."
"Never."
"What?"
John glanced up and saw Sherlock looking carefully away and tapping his fingers against his mug. He decided to not make a big deal about it. "Anytime."
He made a mistake in letting himself get involved. It always ended up hurting him in the end.
"What?"
Last note, apologies to anyone who likes Mycroft. If I'm writing him the way I saw him in BBC's version, he's not a nice brother. He really owes a nice apology and then some to Sherlock. If you want an amazing Mycroft, watch Miss Sherlock!
"One time when we were studying, he kissed me. We were a couple after that, I suppose. Never in public though. I mean, it wouldn't have been safe at the time, but we never went to places where it was safe to be open like that." Sherlock changed position, and couldn't maintain eye contact with John. "We did other things, but it hurt. I complained and he offered a solution. I was high for the first time, and it was a solution. It felt like the answer to a lot of problems at the time. I wasn't bored anymore, my mind quieted whenever I shot up. I didn't do it terribly often then. Not yet."
“Must I really urinate in the small cup?”
Sherlock looked down at his attire and shrugged. “It’s comfortable and I hurt.”
“Seriously Man, stop it.” John said as he walked over and rubbed at Sherlock’s back trying to get the heaving under control.
“Oh my goodness you’re getting married this is so wonderful!” Mrs. Hudson exclaimed practically bouncing in place, not realizing she was congratulating them for the wrong thing.
“I’m horny.”
“Can I put my shirt back on?”
“Sherlock you need more than that…”
“But I should…shouldn’t I?”
John sat up straighter, “He was as hot as hell and you know it too.”
Sherlock sighed and crossed his arms over his bare chest and waited impatiently for the tests to be completed.
John was hesitant at first before shrugging his shoulders. “I get how you are…I knew how you were before I agreed we were going to start our relationship.”
I know it's been forever since I updated this story so I hope there is still people out there that want to see an update. I also hope there are new people out there to have fun with this mostly funny story. This chapter might be less funny than normal but its still our great guys.
<><><><><><> “I don’t like you hiding things from me.”
“I assure you I would not.” Sherlock stated from where he was seated at his microscope at the kitchen counter.
John put the paper down so he could look at Sherlock. “You don’t look it.”
“It’s okay Sherlock I already knew…it’s why I stopped by actually.” Mary said smiling. “I think it’s completely wonderful.”
John shrugged his shoulders, “There are things that can be done about that.”
“Well don’t you find it a bit odd that Lestrade would be sending us on animal related cases all the time?”
“I didn’t agree to that.” Sherlock said shaking his head. “I just want to go home after this.”
Sherlock shook his head like crazy, “Oh no….this is a private thing.”
“You…kissed…Molly.” John said the weird sounding words and was still looking at his boyfriend like he was a complete fruit cake.
“So we’re having a baby?” John questioned, ready to spew many words of protest if Sherlock mentioned anything about terminating the pregnancy.
“When did you get that?” John questioned his boyfriend.
Sherlock waited a second and when he realized John was staying quiet he continued. “I know that YOU desire sex and quite often.”
“Mycroft.”
“I do.” Sherlock said rubbing his still sculpted flat stomach.
Sighing, John walked back up the steps and into the house. “Please be quick I am running late.”
Donovan shrugged, “Not really…so answer it.”
John turned quickly when he heard Sherlock’s voice standing right next to him. “What?”
“Precious….you are just so precious.” John said and made a face at how ridiculous that sounded coming out of his mouth.
Thank you for reading!!! :)
“I’m not aborting this baby but I am not stopping cases for at least another few months.”
Mr. Holmes came to the door and looked surprised to see Sherlock and John. “Sherlock, son this is a surprise.” He said and then ushered them inside since Mrs. Holmes had yet to do so and they had been standing on the stoop.
“Hmm”
John’s eyes went wide, “What? How…”
This caused John to start coughing on his own saliva and caused Sherlock to have to pound him on the back to gain his breath back.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You asked.”
It took a good half an hour for the blood results but the second John saw the results his eyes went wide and a huge smile came over his mouth. “Well it’s certain.”
P.S. Thank you for those who left reviews and Kudos for the last chapter!!!
This story of course is semi-AU but I am trying to fit with cannon at least a little bit. This chapter might seem a bit off because I am still currently watching the Sherlock episodes and this chapter was written after the beginning (damn having to pause it to do homework!) of Season 3 episode 1 and through the end of episode 2. SOOO if things seem weird like characters are off and mentioned off kilter I apologize and just remind you that I have Sherlock pregnant so that is just odd anyway HAHA!
“Don’t know.” Sherlock said sounding distracted.
John had to laugh a little at that, “Sherlock they know we’re a couple…have for ages now so why would having a baby be a big deal. I think your mum would be thrilled.”
It only took two seconds for Mrs. Holmes to be at her son’s side and once again catching him in an epic hug. “Oh my gosh!” she exclaimed loudly causing Sherlock to wince.
“You always had a girlfriend…or boyfriend…wife”
“I want this John.”
Mary realized what this REALLY was about. She thought it was the baby but it wasn’t just that. “You think he is going to leave you because you won’t have sex with him?”
Sherlock took the plate and started eating right away to John’s surprise.
Mary laughed, “Sherlock is SO pregnant.”
“This vomiting all the time, I won’t be able to work like this.”
Greg did come with water and quickly handed into Sherlock, a bit flustered.
“Hmm?”
“Yes.” Sherlock got out of bed himself and headed for the bathroom.
“It is not the fact the cow was killed but how it was killed.”
Sherlock smiled a bit more. “I know you do…I love you as well.”
“You are such a drama queen.” John said as they got into the cab that pulled up for them. They had spent a good few hours with Sherlock’s parents and now it was time to go back to Baker Street. Even though he loved Sherlock’s parents he was thankful to be heading back home where he could be alone with the man he loved.
“Then what is the problem?”
“John?”
“You are my friend and have always been my friend, even when I didn’t have friends, and then it just seemed right to become more. I mean everybody thought we were a couple anyway…”
“I do…want to.” Sherlock and when he could tell she needed more of an explanation he tried to give one. “I just don’t have the same desires he does.”
“I’m ugly.” Sherlock mumbled, looking down at a hole he found on his pajama bottoms.
Mrs. Holmes answered the door and squealed in delight to see her youngest son standing at the entry to her home. “Oh Sherlock it’s so good to see you!”
<><><><><><>
“Excuse me?”
So that is what happened Sherlock sat up front with Greg while John sat in the back all the way to Baskerville. They talked about how they would check into the town inn and worry about investigating anything the next day since it would be after 8pm when they arrived at the country town.
Greg was confused to get a question thrown back at him without the answer to his. Sighing he went for it. “Mrs. Harper.”
“They will have a conniption fit.”
“You heard me.”
She shook her head, “Please.”
“So you appear to be about six weeks along.” John said smiling like a fool; he was enjoying this immensely.
“Molly.”
“That would be even odder.”
“Then be happy about this because HE is.” With that she left the bathroom leaving him alone for another few minutes. He then left with a sigh and actually ran into his boyfriend walking down the hall.

John suddenly found himself thinking, unnerved though he was.

John had just enough warning through the meld to straighten up—reluctant as he was to let go of that delectable cock,
For some seconds everyone stood very still and quiet. Within a few breaths’ time John realized that ever so faintly he could hear some sound out among the taller boulders that littered this area, probably dropped here as glacial occasionals over the ages. “In a few moments,” he murmured. He gestured at Bradstreet and Gregson with his phaser. “Fire only on my signal. Flank out.”
He trailed off.

“Energise,” the Captain said, and Sh’lok watched the Transporter room fade away before him while planning his next moves.
And to John’s astonishment and delight, Sh’lok actually
“No,” Lestrade said, and for the first time his voice lightened a little, so that he sounded a little more like the way he normally did when Sh’lok was being alien or different in a way that Lestrade thought was being manifested just to annoy him. “That incredible Vulcan physique hung on until the life-support cycle took over. His body lives. The autonomic functions continue.” And his voice went heavy again. “But there is no mind.”
John stood there thinking for a moment that a man who’d turn his coat once would most likely turn it twice.
Then he looked up. “I’m keeping you from your work,” John said. “My apologies, Mr. Sh’lok.”
Shortly, though, that tunnel came out into a wider space that looked like a small cavern or cavelet that natural forces had produced in the stone—one that showed few signs of the miners’ tools, with only an occasional piece of equipment discarded on the relatively smooth floor.
He wasn’t left much time to keep trying to think of some way to put off killing Sh’lok, as the Vulcan leapt down off the dais toward him, coming down in a crouch that John knew meant he was ready to jump again in a second. Sh’lok glanced at the way John was holding his
John thought. It might have been only the second time he’d ever laid eyes on her, but the sense of calculation that rolled off the woman was, to John at least, nearly tangible. He got a strong feeling that this was a person who did nothing accidentally…
“The creature may or may not attack on sight,” John said. “However,

They both raised their goggles to their eyes. The doctor swallowed and turned toward the console… then threw the switch.
John swallowed. Sh’lok’s eyes were actually halfway to rolling up in his head, his face gone tight in a rictus of what looked like barely-suppressed fury, and the interlaced fingers clutched together, flexed, clutched again. John thought of how many times he’d seen those fingers steepled in thought, or comfortably laced together as their owner gazed at him across the chessboard, and his guts clenched.
“That magnificent mind of his,” Mary said. “But it can't protect him from

“Why waste time?” he said. “If we’re not careful, five years’ll be gone before we know it. Let’s set ‘em up again, Mr. Sh’lok, and see if you can’t teach me to pay better attention to level one.”

—and it was the sound of the anger and fear in the Doctor’s voice that got John his focus back. He waited just the half-second necessary so Sh’lok couldn’t avoid committing to the stroke, and then rolled to one side as that blade came down, burying itself in the sand next to his head. In that moment when Sh’lok was off balance John picked his feet up and rammed them up into Sh’lok’s chest, kicking him a clear two meters away and down onto his back.
John thought. He licked his lips again. “Oh God,
The misery encapsulated within this revelation, and the stony shell of unhappy resignation accreted around it—worn down smooth by who knew how many years of the memory being turned over and over in this man’s mind—left John simultaneously terrified to say anything and terrified

“True,” John said.
“We’ll have to lay in the automatic transporter setting when we’re doing the power bypass,” Hudders said. “A bit inelegant, but workable. Problem is, when we interrupt the engine circuits to tie the power increase into the transporter, it'll show up on Anderson’s security board. But we'll only need a second or so of that to lock it in.”

Dr. Hooper checked the seal on the cubicle door. “Ready, Greg.”
“As I’ve told you many times before, It’s not your atoms that are being flung about, Doctor,” Sh’lok said, settling without apparent effort into his side of the waspish dialogue  the two of them had been cultivating with every evidence of (very covert) enjoyment since
But now there was no hope at all; nor ever would be again.
Fortunately no one had anything worse than a concussion—Giotto had picked that up—except, of course, for the young officer who’d given his life on duty down in the tunnels on Janus VI. His paperwork was waiting on John’s desk. Reynaud, his name was: Jules Reynaud. John sighed at the thought of composing another of those letters to Ensign Reynaud’s family. But that was part of this job as much as the happier parts, and for some time now he had been learning to accept it.
“Scanners ready, sir,” Mrs. Hudson said from behind him.
“That sounds incredibly boring.”
John thought… because an interested Sh’lok was one of the less predictable and more dangerous forces in the universe.
Sh’lok returned the glance, and then simply moved back toward the Horta. John lifted his phaser again, covering him.
“Agreed, Doctor,” John said.
And suddenly the thought of anyone else doing that with Sh’lok bothered him, bothered him irrationally, bothered him a
John glanced over to where the two fallen Security men were being helped up by Mrs. Hudson and her junior engineer. Then he turned to look at Donovan, wondering where else their now-missing visitor might have taken herself. “Condition reports from all decks, Lieutenant—”
“Yes, sir.”
Alarmed, he jogs ahead.
S’kroft simply looked at him, his face still.
“Three of your hours.”
John tilted his head to one side and did his best to listen to the mindspace around them. What he got was a general sense of wonder and desire, but at the moment it seemed to be running in a loop, as if Sh’lok wasn’t quite sure where to go from here.

“How very flattering,” Sh’lok said from somewhere inside the central structure. The tone was dry enough to make it plain that he wasn’t taken in by the flattery… but John noticed that Sh’lok didn’t seem to be in a rush to contradict her, either.
His communicator chirped. John flipped it open. “Watson here.”
Here was Anderson, doing exactly
seemed like too much. Harry’s never-ending struggle with her alcoholism and her various failed relationships—every one seemingly so promising, and every one of them failing within a year—had over time become just too damn much to bear, even at second and third hand.
“Directed at what?” John said.
Sh’lok had staggered back a pace in reaction. Now he turned and stared at the window, and at John, and at the window again—
Sh’lok murmured,
“Phaser report, sir,” Mrs. Hudson said. “No damage.”
Her gaze came to rest on him haughtily. “Thank you, Doctor. That was very gracious.”
Vanderberg rubbed his face in distress. “Without the pump mechanism, the reactor will go supercritical. It could poison half the planet when it blows. But we can't shut it down! It provides heat and air and life support for the whole colony…”

and so many other things, reaching deep, spreading wide. Just touching the thoughts that Sh’lok’s silent wistful hopes had wrapped about the word in the past, both distant and recent, made something in John echo like a struck gong… the sound and feeling of the longing resonances filling him full right out to the surface of his skin. He felt in himself Sh’lok’s certainty that once you were
John thought. And right now he found the difference in their heights to be the last thing on his mind. It was as if while John was touching Sh’lok, all the urgency, all the uncertainty, all the nerves, had begun falling away from him like a shed garment; as if something was saying to him,
“Six hours fifty-four minutes at warp six, sir.”
Nor did it: all he got was another blank look. “Will you take us where we can meet the others?” John said then.
Lestrade looked up in anguished frustration. “He’s dying, and I can’t stop it!”

Appel shook his head. “I can’t, not in any detail. Only got a glimpse of it. But it's big and shaggy.”
What does this mean? Does life mean nothing to them? How are they so cruel?!"
John and Lestrade exchanged a bemused look. John, feeling his being lightened all over again—and in a way he’d thought would never happen—suddenly found it impossible to resist the urge to tweak his First Officer’s metaphorical tail a bit.
Across from him John felt that small smile starting, and opened his eyes to see it, because it was always worth seeing—the expression that no one else on this ship, no one else in this Galaxy, or any other, got to see. John smiled back at it… because it was impossible not to… and then yawned: he couldn’t help it. “What time’s it?”
Sh’lok shook his head. “Illogical, if such efforts continued. Improvements in long-range stellar surveying and cartography over the middle of the last century would have made it plain that stellar density in this region was too low for Deneva as a transport hub to ever become logistically or economically viable.”

had made Sh’lok briefly withdraw from direct confrontation. The move was of course tactical. John’s own Sh’lok had shown him what a Vulcan did who suddenly lost control of a meld: they retreated to a safe place or inner stronghold to recoup.
John said, as if the obvious still stood in need of some justification.
a meld. But that wasn’t an issue now, since
Mrs. Hudson rolled her eyes. “Never mind,” she said, “I’ll attend to it.”
"Donovan, of all the times for you to be an absolute moron, this is clearly one of the worst times." Sherlock scowled, John trying to his confused amusement.
"Why have we never seen or heard of you before now if you're his husband." Sally blundered on, ignoring his question.
"There's been a body found in the Prime Minister's back garden." She said, slightly out of breath.
"John!"
"Sherlock!" Some unseen voice answered.
"Lestrade, I'll be back next week at the earliest for cases. Until then I'm not getting involved. This will give you a chance to prove that your apes can actually do police work as well as you've been claiming they can."
"I've been stationed in Afghanistan. I just got back. And as for why You've never heard of me. Well I can't imagine why Sherlock would want to share any personal information with a bitch like you." John said, giving the speechless woman a cold stare. Sherlock wrapped an arm around his husband and bent down slightly to lay a kiss on his head.
Racing towards each other, the two separated lovers pushed people out of the way to reach each other. And as soon as they did they kissed each other hard on the lips, all of their love and longing for each other being expressed in their tight embrace. After some time, the two stepped back from each other, resting their foreheads against the other's.
"John!" The tall man shouted.
“I don-” John started, only to be cut off by his partner’s voice in his ear.
"What? But this is right up your alley freak. Are you trying to say the Prime Minister is beneath you?" Donovan snarled.
When the elevator came to a stop Sherlock took a deep breath, and John, feeling his husband’s nerves, gave his lover’s hand a quick squeeze. As the doors opened they stepped out onto the floor and started their way across the hall and to Lestrade’s office. Heads started to turn and the chatter began to grow as they progressed. Before they could get to the office, their path was blocked by a pale man, dark-haired man.
“Obtuse as ever Anderson.” Sherlock retorted. “I suggest you leave, before I catch your ignorance.”
"What did you just call him?" John said in a deadly tone. Sherlock put a hand on his shoulder in a failed attempted to calm him.
"Who are you to call me a moron!? You're the freak!" Donovan yelled back at Sherlock. As soon as she said that something changed in the John fellow. All traces of humor vanished from his face, leaving it scarily blank, but with threatening undertones as his posture stiffened and he managed to maneuver himself between Donovan and Sherlock.
“John, this low-life truly isn’t worth emotion. He barely has two IQ points to rub together.” Sherlock murmured, a smirk adorning his lips. John sighed, trying to restrain himself.
"I missed you so much, I was so worried." Sherlock whispered, eyes sweeping John, cataloging all of him.
John was less than pleased with the impression his husband’s coworkers had made at the airport, to put it lightly. He knew being away had been harder for Sherlock than the man let on, and he regretted putting his beloved through that. When he had been deployed he had been under the impression that the detective had had people to help support him aside from his stiff brother, but now, it seemed as though the only other person had been Mrs. Hudson, and despite the fact that she was a nice lady, John felt even guiltier for basically abandoning his lover for war.
As Sherlock reached the airport, he checked his phone again, 1:53. Going over to the arrival board he quickly located John's flight, and it's docking station. Hurrying through the crowds, Sherlock arrived with just under a minute to spare. He was quite aware of his two tails, but right now he honestly didn't care at all. Slipping his hand under his shirt, he pulled out a necklace.
“We’re headed to the sixth floor, that’s where the homicide department is located.” The taller man explained, sending a smile his lover’s way. The pair continued towards the elevator, and once the doors closed around them, they shared a fond look.
"That person has got to be mad to be that happy to see that weirdo." Sally muttered under her breath.
"Let's go John, I've got to show you our new flat. Our landlady Mrs. Hudson will simply adore you." Turning to leave, Sherlock looked over his shoulder and addressed the still silent DI.
"Sherlock!"
"He's doing something. He's taking off a necklace." Sally said, a bit confused.
"Her shoes. The friend owned a unique pair of heels, and their shape were imprinted in the carpet of the victim's room." Sherlock explained, too happy to question the DI's intelligence. This was noticed by said DI, however, before he could ask, Donovan burst into the room.
"Who do you suppose the freak's meeting?" Donovan asked, looking towards her partner in crime (though thankfully not actual crime, as they were with Scotland Yard).
"I'm his husband. And who are you?" John asked, eyebrow raised in a silent challenge. He succeeded in stunning Sally and her silent companion.
“Don’t let him blackmail you into spending time with him, he’s a psychopath!” Anderson griped.
"Fine by me, I never want to leave again. I love you too much." John said, pecking Sherlock on the lips.
“Next time you insult my husband, you bloody fucker, you’ll find more than just your nose broken.” John growled, his voice holding a deadly tone. “Do I make myself clear?” At the hasty nod, John rose to stand beside his bemused husband.
"Oh look! He's scanning the crowd." Sally said excitedly. Both of the officers were a bit disconcerted when they saw his face break out into an impossibly wide and genuine smile.
“Was that really necessary?” Sherlock asked, slightly exasperated.
He knew Sherlock didn’t see it that way, but that didn’t change how John felt about the matter. The way that bint had treated his husband irked him, and made him wonder what other cruelties the brunette had had to face while John was gone. As they had locked themselves inside for a week to get “reacquainted”, he had yet to see the office, but that was about to change. Currently, John was walking slightly behind Sherlock as they made their way to Scotland Yard. As the pair entered the building, John looked questioningly at Sherlock.
And with that Sherlock led his husband outside and towards a cab, all the while keeping his John firmly in his grasp.
"He's putting a ring on. Oh, wait! do you think-" Greg started, only to be interrupted.
"I missed you two, you have no idea how happy I am to be back here. The only thing keeping me going was thoughts of you and our letters." John whispered back, tightening his grip on his husband.
Unclasping it, Sherlock pulled off the ring that had been strung onto it and slipped it onto his left ring finger, clasping the necklace back around his neck. As people started to get off of the plane and flood out into the waiting area, Sherlock used his height to look for the familiar sandy hair of his lover. And once he had, a smile broke out on his face.
Turning towards each other, an unspoken agreement passed between Greg and Sally. If there was something or someone that would make Sherlock Holmes turn away from a case as interesting as this, then they just had to see what or who it was. Because despite the fact that the Prime Minister was asking for their help, this was something that they had to see. So, grabbing their coats, the two stalked after the consulting detective.
Today was the day, and Sherlock couldn't be more excited. His husband, his John, was coming home today. He had been gone for over a year, deployed in the Middle East. He had even been injured, but the military had kept him in one of their hospitals overseas, but now he was well enough to come home. And what was even better, he was never going back. Sherlock could keep him safe, or as safe as someone near him could be, Sherlock could keep him right next to him, right where he belonged.
Long Discussions & Ex Wives
Halfway through their small meal the door buzzed and John went to get it. Sure enough it was Greg there to pick them up.
“I know that.”
“What is?” Sherlock questioned as he walked into the room with tea and what could pass off as bisects if the two men actually went to the shops on a regular basis.
John sighed knowing he shouldn’t offer Sherlock anything for the ache because of his pregnancy. “Maybe you’re hungry…or dehydrated.”
“Right.”
“Bull actually.”
“It had nothing to do with the images on the paper.” Sherlock said actually pouting a little.
“Oh so it takes some hot ass guy to get your blood boiling enough to have sex with your boyfriend.” John said now actually pushing off Sherlock’s legs and getting up to pace the room. “That REALLY says a lot for our relationship, Sherlock.”
“How does the photographs smell funny, Sherlock?” Greg questioned interested.
“Because they are out of character for you!”
Like always reviews and kudos are always welcome and quite frankly I thrive on them!
“Good point.” John mumbled to himself as he stood on the other side of the bathroom door waiting for Sherlock to be finished getting sick.
ANYWAYS I hope you enjoy this once again slightly odd story!!!
<><><><><><><>
“Hush.” John said as he got a needle ready so he could take the blood he needed for the pregnancy test. He had debated on if he should do a urine test or a blood test and had decided to do both. This of course frustrated Sherlock.
At first John had no idea what Sherlock was talking about and then got it. “Maybe you should really start taking a break from cases…” he said gently but by the look on Sherlock’s face he knew he made the wrong choice, especially sitting in a cab neither of them being able to run if things got heated…and not in a good way.
“Rabbits.” Sherlock said a huge smile on his face. “I like rabbits.”
“Not sure what to say…you ‘knocked’ me up.” Sherlock said with a slight smirk on his lips. “You really were a bad, bad boy.”
“I’m sleeping.”
Both Sherlock and Mary looked to the door where John was standing with a plastic sack in his hand. He walked right over to Sherlock and cupped his cheeks. “I LOVE you, you silly pregnant fool.”
“Sherlock you are REALLY not making sense.” Greg said shaking his head in disbelief. “Please clarify.”
“I was trying to remember the date of a case.” Sherlock lied through his teeth, something even HE wasn’t very good at.
“An actual picture?”
John rubbed Sherlock’s back until the other man was finished getting sick. He reached up and flushed the sick away before helping Sherlock to sit back against the bathtub and just taking some much needed breaths of air. “Here sip this…slowly.”
This caught John completely off guard, so much so that he almost fell to the floor since he had been leaning on the back of the chair. “Excuse me.”
“Since you put your spawn in me.”
“I understand,” John said as he put their suit cases by an arm chair and then went to look out the window. They had a great view of the countryside and part of him thought about how this would make for a great Honeymoon spot….well besides the at least partly corrupt government facility in the distance….oh and the fact that Sherlock insisted they were never getting married.
Sherlock looked at John dubiously. “I have never been sexy.”
Sherlock looked at John and despite his brother’s words he explained what he was talking about. “Mycroft got himself pregnant while away at an equine camp in Scotland when he was…” he glanced at Mycroft. “How old?”
“I’m horny.” Sherlock stated again from where he was lounging on the couch in only his pajama pants a t-shirt, surprisingly his normal robe was missing from his attire.
“Oh?” John found this interesting. “Do enlighten us.”
John was confused, but that wasn’t abnormal. “You don’t keep track on the Kitty Calendar…your case stuff I mean.” He said still wondering why in the world they had a calendar full of kitty cats in the first place.
“Tough.”
Sherlock sucked in a shaky breath. “I cannot give him what he needs. You said it yourself…multiple times a day.”
Mary smiled at the two men. “Hey guys I was in the area and thought I would stop by.” Seeing that Sherlock was in his night clothes she felt a little weird. “But if this is a bad time I can leave.”
“This is a fascinating book.”
John was shocked at Sherlock’s behavior but didn’t mention it, instead he stayed focused on the topic of telling their friends and family of the pregnancy. “I want to tell them.”
“You…Sherlock homes…almost had sex with some woman?” John said in complete disbelief.
“I know this.”
“Sherlock you cannot compare sexual hormones with morning sickness.” Mary said as if reading his mind. “You should enjoy it while you’ve got it if you don’t normally have it.”
“I miscarried.”
“Excuse me?”
“Well you are having his child for starters.”
“So you say.”
John finished his sentence in his blog and waited for Sherlock who was taking his sweet time. “Probably doing his hair.” He said to himself.
“Huh?”
“And you are letting him go gallivanting after dead cows?”
“No idea.”
“JOHN!” Sherlock exclaimed and squeaked at the same time a very ‘un-Sherlock’ noise.
Sherlock looked at John with a death glare.
“Have you two not said anything to each other the whole time I’ve been gone?” John questioned as he came down the stairs.
Sherlock shook his head in the negative. “You said I’m precious…what in the world is THAT supposed to mean?”
John looked at the two Holmes men, wondering what Sherlock would say. He did NOT expect what he did say though.
“He is right.” Mycroft said also looking at Sherlock. “I do believe she will be very excited but also wondering when the wedding will take place.” He said the last part with a smirk.
John ran a frustrated hand over his face as he looked at the pictures all over the sitting room of the flat. “This is positively revolting.” He made a face. “Tell me again why we are focused on a cow’s…murder?”
Sherlock shook his head this time. “No…what did you mean.”
“Right.”
“Pardon?”
Sherlock simply nodded his head.
“I told you it has to do with that case about the cat.”
“Why would she lie” John muttered again finding his stocking feet rather interesting.
The fortalice was ridiculously ornate, a shining black excrescence with spiky towers and gilded domes and festooned with fussy repetitive decorative motifs that John Watson, when describing the building to him, eleven point six days ago, had for some reason referred to as “gingerbread”. The peculiar descriptor had caused Sh’lok to look the place up, and he had been so taken by the ridiculous jewel-encrusted idiosyncracy of the structure that he had instantly applied its likeness to the exterior of his locus matrix. And here it was, undamaged by the events of the last hour. Sh’lok was immensely relieved to find it so, for all its silly looks.
They were almost completely one now, swiftly and hungrily flowing together in that darkness as the twinned heats within them grew and fed each other, ready to flare into conflagration. In that last moment when there was still a tiny fraction of separation between them, John opened his eyes, looked into Sh’lok’s, and spoke as he spoke to his ship, his voice reaching everywhere inside the one who was inside him.
He took a breath as long as Sh’lok’s had been, hearing the echoes of that short word.

John let out an annoyed breath. “Lieutenant Donovan, acknowledge that message.”

he realised. Not that he knew how he knew that: just that he did.
“Look,” John said, wiping the sweat off his forehead. “If I get into any trouble, I'll quit. Then Sh’lok wins, and honour is satisfied!”
Even at his most diplomatic, “please” wasn’t a word one heard all that often from this man. John swallowed as his cock twitched emphatically in his pants. “So look,” John said, out loud again, so as to try to regain a

John thought. “As regards logical reasoning, I believe there may be hope for you yet.”
John gave him a resigned sort of

Bradstreet just smiled a bit and let go of Kara, who fastened that stubborn glare on John again.
When even Lestrade was showing such signs of stress, John knew they were all in trouble. But there was nothing to be done about it at the moment. “Recommendations?” he said, glancing at the awful jar again.

“Yes, Captain,” Sh’lok said. “Not only high-definition imagery, but even the fingerprint data. While still on Earth I had had leisure to write a routine for the tricorder that allows fingerprint scanning and analysis when one is using a compatible supernanoparticle dusting medium. The whorls—”
Sh’lok spent a moment examining the edges of the hole. “The same indication as shown at the door, Captain. A very strong corrosive, secreted with great precision.”
“Would I be at all correct,” he said, examining the board, “in saying that I think you’ve got something you want to do that you’d like to ask me about, but it’s weird enough that you’re concerned that I might say no and you might need to go ahead and do it anyway?”
He slid one hand out from under Sh’lok’s and ran it slowly over his chest, down his belly, and stroked his cock, his eyes fixed on Sh’lok’s.
“Oh go on with you,” she said, and gave John a little push toward the door. “I’ve got enough on my plate right now, I’m going to go have to go see Lestrade about my hip again when this is all over…” It was one of the immemorial problems with deriving body replacement parts from autocloning: the custom-grown parts had a tendency to produce the same problems as the originals unless you tinkered with the base DNA, and that could get tricky. “But just this once I don’t mind. Now get

“Twelve years, Captain Watson,” said Tharn, “or twelve thousand, would make no difference. We are ethically compelled to deny your demand for our dilithium crystals, for you would use their power to destroy.”
He put a foot out and broke the beam between the two light receptacles.
Donovan nodded. “Message complete, sir. Switching over.”
Lestrade was carrying a small handheld control. He touched a couple of buttons on it, and Sh’lok moved forward in step with Lestrade. The other
The light of the stone went out. The stone vanished. Their hands were empty.
For the moment he retreated into safer territory, that of the commanding officer dealing with one of his people. “You've been called the best First Officer in the Fleet,” John said, his voice rough with the discomfort of the moment. “That's an enormous asset to me. If I have to lose that First Officer, I want to know
“Perfectly clear, Captain,” Sh’lok said. It was hard to imagine that deep voice going small, but it was trying.
“They are not outworlders,” Sh’lok said. “They are my friends.”
“Something’s happening in the reactor room!” Vanderberg shouted, and went through the hole in the door. Fascinated by the clean sharp edge of the cut-through, John lifted a hand toward it, but paused when Sh’lok reached out with his phaser hand to stop him.
John got up on his knees and leaned down to that head as if drawn by a magnet, the desire and heat fairly boiling up in him at Sh’lok’s dark spicy scent, stronger there than anywhere else on him and so heady. He strongly suspected that there was something else going on as well, and the mere suspicion immediately provided him via the mindmeld with evidence that he was right. From the distant depths to which matters of workaday science had temporarily been consigned, John caught a faint echo of data about the ways in which a Vulcan mate’s body chemistry began altering itself during
John held his face still while waiting for her to give him some kind of clue as to how he should react to this suggestion, whatever it meant.

“Sh’lok,” John said. “If I don’t go,
Their eyes met across the chess board, between levels two and three. Sh’lok’s gaze was absolutely guileless… but after a moment the corner of his mouth twitched. “I can of course—I think your phrase would be ‘talk you through it’ —if that’s your preference,” Sh’lok said, “but the subject can be quite dry and you may find the illustrated tutorial in the ship’s data banks of more use.”
And a second later there was another dragon in that space. It was less long and lanky, more compactly built. Its scales were not red but golden, many edged with black. And nose to tail it was half again the size of the one it faced.

“Ready, Captain,” Dimmock said.
An immediate answer: “Hudson here, sir.” He could hear her working with some panel or other down in Engineering as she spoke, and nearby, the sound of Lestrade cursing softly as he apparently worked at levering a different panel open.
Lestrade shook his head. “It was… upsetting, that’s all. Dr. Hooper assisted me on the surgery on Sh’lok…”
he found himself thinking.
assignment to new vessels, or both, and
Yet today, in the Transporter room, for the first time in months (eight months, sixteen days, twelve hours, thirty-one point six seven minutes), Sh’lok found himself sunk deep in a most unexpected and uncharacteristic wash of surprise. The prosaic nature of the setting may itself have contributed in some small way to the surprise: just another beam-up, the landing party returning from the surface of Halka V, where they had gone expecting from the natives either a slavish capitulation to the Empire’s demands, or a foolish defiance that would end in their species’ extinction. Sh’lok’s attention was fixed on the pad to the forefront always occupied by Captain Watson in a typically unsubtle reminder to his staff of who was the most important among them. But as the shimmering of the Transporter effect steadied down and revealed the shapes of the beings beaming up, Sh’lok—who had been standing waiting for the normal furious demand that the planet’s civilisation be forthwith destroyed—was startled out of his resigned composure by the realisation that something exceptional had happened. The Transport finished, and the shapes that had been nothing but light and incompletely-resolved energy states a moment before went solid and complete; and Sh’lok immediately perceived that whoever the man standing there in the Imperial captain’s uniform might have been,
Sh’lok regarded him with momentary bemusement.

“Cancel,” he said, got up out of the chair because he couldn’t just sit there any more. He looked at Bones, bleak. “Now we know.”
A half glance sideways showed him the phaser Sh’lok was holding on him. John held still—but only just.
“Hardly fifteen minutes, John! The field density between the two universes is degrading very fast—”

labs, and had sent for John and Lestrade when he was ready for them. When they entered the lab they found Sh’lok seated in front of a cylindrical containment module with the creature lying inside. “Come in, gentlemen,” he said. “I believe you'll find this interesting."
The world snapped back into focus. Engineering did, anyway, and so did Mrs. Hudson. She was standing there with her arms crossed and tapping one foot.
“Sh’lok…” He smiled at his Vulcan. Sh’lok had been stroking his face again, his fingers held in a way that was reminiscent of the mindmeld gesture: almost the Vulcan salute, the fingers parted two and two, but gently curved as he touched John’s cheek with the fingers’ backs. “Tell me.”
John glanced at him. “A lot of it?”

permission? …Yet he knew Sh’lok had to.
His thought dropped to a whisper. My
But that was ridiculous. John forced himself to look up again… and to his great surprise, found Sh’lok doing the same.
“A difficult exchange for both of us,” Sh’lok said. “Naturally the urgency of the moment mandated that the most immediate crisis be dealt with first. But I saw in the mother Horta’s mind that some of the killings that occurred before we came here did not involve her and her victims alone.”
“That is an order, Mrs. Hudson.”
And once they’d all decided on who was going to hit whom first, and in what order, they nodded cordially to one another and the fight broke out.
Sh’lok looked up from his hooded viewer with the merest twitch of the corner of his mouth — one that John was learning by experience foreshadowed a rather feral smile. “Captain,” he said, “to
“Yes, millennia before, as the system is self-repairing and self-reprogramming. Its error routines simply failed to fire correctly when the earlier Controller expired. The next time the diagnostics ran themselves automatically, they caught the error and repaired it, so that when the next Controller died, Kara set out and found…”
Sh’lok came stalking in to stand in front of the centre seat and to its left—
“And what happened to the ‘not hurting anyone’ policy?” John said, starting to get furious all over again.
It wasn’t a question as such. In response, the small smile got larger and turned more wicked. “Nothing I hope you will not do repeatedly in the future,” Sh’lok said. “Especially the part where you put your—”
That was the other conjecture that had been tormenting him, and making John shy away from it every time, because the possibilities were just too awful. “On our

events any scientist could ever hope to witness. And here
John’s mind went back to Sh’lok unhesitatingly picking up the blasted-off chunk of the Horta’s hide—perhaps rendered fortuitously inert by the phaser fire, for all John knew. What if the Horta had simply been off-balance for a short time, frightened by what Sh’lok had just done… but was now recovering, and angry?
“I am not sure that being so conscientious about your arrival on shift will make much difference to the way your day will go,” Sh’lok said. He sounded a touch somber.
Bradstreet looked at least as annoyed as John felt. “Yes, sir.”
The whole lot of them piled around the curve in the tunnel, Vanderberg and Appel in the lead: and then for a vital moment they all froze, even those of them carrying the Security team’s purloined phasers, as they saw what was there. Beside John, Sh’lok already had his phaser drawn and aimed at them. John flung out an arm and shouted
John looked down the length of it: a perfect tube cut in the stone, converging what must be hundreds of meters away in a pinhead of vanishing point. “This goes back as far as the eye can see!” he said. “Our best machinery couldn't cut a tunnel like this, not even with phasers.”
Nonetheless caution, also part of a good Captain’s stock in trade, spoke urgently to him too.
“’Maybe,’” John said. “There’s no time for maybes, Bones. We need to know
Sh’lok said after a moment.
“A good clean shot too,” Appel said. “Didn't even slow it down.” He clipped the phaser back in place, his mouth twisting in anger.
Finally even the echoes went silent. John stood in that silence, waiting. For long moments nothing happened.
John looked at the ridiculously complex pattern of tunnels and shook his head. “Into some of these,” Sh’lok said, “a good-sized statistical sampling, I had the Transporter chief drop a spread of remotely powered sensor devices to document them visually, as our scanners were not sufficiently sensitive to provide the necessary fineness of detail for my requirements. Take a look at some of these images and tell me what you see.”
John gazed at that little dot, now very slowly growing, and said nothing… because no matter how much he wished he could, he couldn’t say “No.”
John could think of nothing to do but turn to Sh’lok and produce an expression suggesting he didn’t have the slightest idea what Lestrade was talking about. Sh’lok matched it.

“John,” Sh’lok said, drawing himself up in as much indignation as one could reasonably express while lying on one’s side, naked. “I never guess.”
His tunnel was one that had been cut by the miners through the softly glittering cobalt-shaded stone that characterized this part of the facility. Fairly quickly the miners’ work terminated in what would have been a dead end, but the tunnel continued onward along the same line in the form of one of the uncannily-perfect cylindrical tunnels that were also all through here. It was low, no more than a meter and a half high, and John had to get down and make his way along half-bent over.
You're ignoring them. I protest—” She gestured gracefully at her neckline with the stylus, apparently innocently signalling
John smiled. “Better still. Might as well make best use of them.”
It was shocking, the feeling of
Looking at it, John nodded: he could see the edges still sizzling faintly. With care he stepped through.
The Vulcan turned to them both. “As I suggested to you earlier, Captain, the overall path of a wave of mass insanity that has inexplicably destroyed otherwise old and stable  humanoid-related civilisations—” He half-turned again to gesture at the map on the screen with his padd’s stylus. “—follows an unusually direct path through this section of the galaxy.” He pointed at the far left of the map. “Over here, the Beta Portilin systems; a number of ancient civilisations were located in the tight star cluster there. Archaeologists have given us information indicating that the whole-world affective disruptions began there, and those civilisations all fell, secondary to what appeared to be humanoid mass extinction events, over a surprisingly short timespan.” He moved the stylus to indicate another small star cluster further along. “Then, two hundred years ago, Levinius Five was swept by mass insanity. After that, theta Cygni Twelve, early in this century.” The stylus moved again. “Finally, Ingraham B, two years ago. Nothing since… but the intervals have been growing significantly shorter each time.” Sh’lok sat staring at the screen with a now-familiar expression that John normally enjoyed when it appeared: that of a man presented with a new and tantalising puzzle.

There were of course loose ends to tie up after such a mission. In the immediate aftermath, some members of the slightly-the-worse-for-wear Security team needed to be seen in Sickbay.

John looked up and saw them. They weren’t just approaching; they were running full tilt, shouting something John couldn’t yet make out and careening down onto those stairs, nearly falling down them in their haste.
Sh’lok met his eyes now. “There can be no excuse for the crime of which I am guilty,” he said. “I intend to offer no defence—”
Sh’lok said, and stood up, his eyes raking over the chessboard as he did; then meeting John’s again. “So let’s be about it, Captain. For the game is

He was on his back again with his feet braced on the mattress for leverage and his knees bent. Sh’lok was kneeling between them, his fingers interlaced with John’s as he tried to get control of John’s arms by pushing them straight down so as to pinion his elbows against his sides. Until this moment, John had been resisting him by pushing straight up. But now, slowly, he started to angle his arms out to either side. He would not unlace their fingers. He gripped Sh’lok’s tight in his own, and forced him to spread his arms as John spread his own; pulled him down and pulled him close, until he was forcing Sh’lok to pin John’s hands, more or less spreadeagled, to the bed.
John had initially called the mind meld, accurately enough; and Sh’lok had plainly been in pain from it at first. But that had partly been due to the Horta’s pain, John thought, first the physical pain and then the emotional—and when those had both been at least somewhat assuaged, Sh’lok’s whole mien had brightened. Early that morning, when recording the first hatchling births, he had been like a completely different man.
“Deck five,” he said to the turbolift, and it headed there. John sighed. His ladders-only plan was going to have to wait for another day. Now he had good reason to hurry places.

satisfaction out of this awful day.
The merely physical aches and pains that Sh’lok had brought back with him from Vulcan had felt so unimportant and insignificant in the face of the nonphysical ones that he’d quite discounted them. Now, though, they were beginning to clamour for attention. “Not then.”
And the monitor went dark.

John blinked, shook his head.
They chose up pieces and began. Sh’lok got white, as he always did when John held the pieces hidden in his fists for the choosing.
“I really, really want to investigate the contents of these further,” John said. “But right now…” He stroked his face against Sh’lok’s. “I’m willing to wait. Because your mouth…” He shook his head a little, let out one breath’s worth of desperately yearning laugh. “Oh, God, your mouth. Here, boost up a little, we’ll get rid of these…”
once with speculative appreciation at each other, then back toward POV—and the future.
“May I?” Sh’lok said quietly.
John said. “What is that, a plea for us not to kill it? Or a promise that it won't kill us?” Not that both sentiments weren’t positive, as far as they went.
When Sh’lok was next able to come in contact with the new Captain Watson, he found him on the Bridge, in the centre seat, looking at Halka V with another of those expressions of desperate restraint, a look as of a man in a trap, while Anderson prepared to fire on the cities that had been programmed for targeting in case the Halkans refused to cooperate. Once again Sh’lok offered Watson his next options in this situation, and was astonished when Watson openly refused them. Quietly, with only a flash of anger here and there, he ordered the scheduled destruction aborted. Sh’lok’s concern became so grave that he actually warned Watson in the presence of the crew that he would have to report his behaviour. And—instead of screams and threats, instead of ordering him to the Booth for insubordination—this Captain Watson told him to go ahead, and left the Bridge.
“No storm damage, sir,” Donovan said, calmly handing him a padd displaying the text version of the messages she’d just pulled down. “All stations report normal.” And in a very casual, almost matter-of-fact murmur pitched just for him to hear, she added, “You're ordered to annihilate the Halkans unless they comply. No alternative.”

Sh’lok’s mind murmured into his—reassured, but chasing after the last word on the subject as usual—
The answer was slow in coming back. “I have observed my father doing so,” Sh’lok said, very low. “When he thought no one could see. But then his circumstances are unique. As regards Vulcans in general, however, the behavior seems to lack even narrow cultural currency, and my data sample is essentially a null set.”

It occurred to John that perhaps Going Again In A While wasn’t as impossible as he’d thought. “Water,” he said, and wriggled himself enough sideways to find a way out from under Sh’lok and out of the bed.
The doctor juggled the hand sensor irritably for a moment, then went back to kneel by the Horta again. John looked back at Sh’lok, still clinging to the creature, trembling as it trembled.

She ambled over to the helmsman’s seat and leaned one elbow on the back of it, looking into Anderson’s face as he turned around and actually batting her eyelashes. “You aren't very persistent, Mr. Anderson,” Donovan said, her voice lazy and breathy. “The game has
John therefore spent the next few moments gazing around at the extraordinary space in which they stood. Finally things quieted down. “Well,” he said. “This is… unusual.”
The word was a soft rumble of anticipation and promise.
John kept his face absolutely still. “Thank you, Mr. Bradstreet. Watson out.” He clicked the screen’s comms button off.
“Biology as in… reproduction?”
“Noted.” John got up out of the center seat and stretched. “I see from the morning reports that our Chief Engineer’s out of sorts about the starboard nacelle—something to do with one of the antimatter converters. Best have a look in, wouldn’t you say, Mr. Sh’lok? And then, who knows, after lunch and before we get to Janus VI, there might be time for me to finish beating you at chess.”
“Do we really.” A sigh. “Twenty-five hours is looking kind of brief at the moment, even if we do stay awake the whole time. And if we do, we’re going to be wrecked when we get there. Probably fall asleep standing there in the middle of the President’s reception. Well, not

The humming and the sparkling began. As always, John felt his pulse start to quicken… and concentrated on keeping any possible expression of excitement hidden well away inside.

“I said I haven't decided,” John said as he turned and walked back to Sh’lok,
“Please restrict your movements, Captain,” came the soft dry baritone.
He said it as if it was an insult, and meant to be so. Sh’lok glared at him from under his brows. When he spoke again, some of its wonted power and some of its proper baritone rumble was back in Sh’lok’s voice, and John’s neck hairs stood up at the sound of it. “I

The lady in purple smiled at that. “If you wish to return to your home, you may go.”

The level which the machinery opened just prior to the first appearance of the creature…”

Once more Sh’lok assumed that mild-mannered, emotion-what-emotion, butter-wouldn’t-melt-in-my-mouth expression. “Merely my quite logical relief that Starfleet had not lost a highly proficient captain.”
Another look that suggested John was quite mad. “We will die above in the cold!”
“Who are you?”
John shook his head. “Here I am,” he said. “Doing what I’ve done. Eliminate the impossible, and whatever remains—” He held out his hands in a sort of manual shrug. “Must be the truth, huh?”

he thought.
But also he was most curious to see what kind of reaction would be forthcoming when he once more spoke forthrightly to this man of the danger he was in. Had it been the John Watson who’d earlier beamed down to Halka V, Sh’lok would have known what response to expect — for that man was a creature compact almost entirely of rage, greed, carefully-concealed fear, a certain low cunning, and (to Sh’lok’s mind) fits of near-comical lust… along with the usual Imperially-inculcated bigotry and hatred of competitor species.
“Good!” John said.
“It seems logical, Captain,” Sh’lok said. “The Horta has a very logical mind. And after close association with humans—” and for John at least there was no missing the momentary glance Sh’lok shot at Lestrade— “I find that curiously refreshing.”
John was readier for it this time, but still starting to simmer with a low fury that for the moment felt far preferable to the recurring gut-fluttering fear he’d been working so hard to master.
“Affirmative,” said someone down in Engineering.

His face contorted.
’s long strap between his hands, and this time there was no mistaking what it was going to be used for as his eyes flicked toward John’s throat. At that glance John’s heart simply went sick inside him, for there was no Sh’lok left there at all. And with that glance—like so much polished metal, some machine’s unmoved look—any hope that there might be some last-ditch, unexpected way out of this situation started leaking out of John like the blood trickling down his chest. Even if there’d been time for last words, for goodbyes, there was no one there to say goodbye to.

Sh’lok shook his head. “It has many ways it looks to me, depending on how I’ve filed it and in which locus. I’m not sure what it will look like to you. If you find it, you’ll know.” He swallowed. “But it must be found. Without it, my brain will be in my body and my body will work, and the brain will work as a computer works… but essential parts of my

Sh’lok’s gaze had gone soft and thoughtful.
In his peripheral vision John saw an expression of sudden horror fleet across Sh'lok’s face, wiped away a second later. “Sickbay?” whispered the man whom John knew hated unnecessary repetition more than almost anything.

not. Within moments the bells and the bloodlust and the words of ceremony had dragged Sh’lok under the surface again—still struggling, but impotent in the event against the forces that had killed many a full-blooded Vulcan before him.
John thought,
Bradstreet was looking at his tricorder at the moment. “Captain, that power we picked up on above? We’re getting closer…”
And John stood there realising that here, so very close to the finish line of the race, so close to the last tick of the clock, it was all going to come to an end for Sh’lok… and there was nothing,
When Anderson then reached out to her for all the world as if she was something he owned, or thought he did, and took her by the chin, Donovan declined to act, at least just yet, and simply stared at him.
He was a tall, white-haired man with a face that since he’d been kicked up into the administrative end of things had gone rather hard, settling into the habitual expression of a man more used to saying “no” than “yes”. And right now, to John’s carefully-concealed dismay, he was fulfilling that expectation. “Captain, you're making a most unusual request…”
John said, and smiled a bit.
feel the need for an infinite amount of it.
John swallowed. The hair rose on the back of his neck as the air around him seemed to start going thick with some sort of tension for which there was no merely physical cause. Sh’lok’s shoulders hunched a bit as if he felt that tension too, as if he was at the core of it.
Lestrade looked down at him with a calm that John wished he felt. “What is there to understand, Mr. Sh’lok?”
He shook his head, and a shiver went down his back as John headed into the Bridge for maybe the third time that hour.
Sh’lok,
The sudden irrational image came to him of a starship full of Sh’loks, gathered from hundreds of universes, all endlessly experimenting, endlessly trying to top one another’s results, and endlessly deducing one another (and getting cranky about it when they got something wrong, because there was always
“Better.”
doubled in his hands again as the Vulcan flailed down at him with the weights. John twisted out of their way as they thumped into the sand beside him. As Sh’lok bent down toward him getting ready to strike again, he grabbed Sh’lok by his forearms, and used him to pull himself up. Once on his feet again John braced himself and used his grip on Sh’lok to fling him across the sand and nearly into one of the cut-stone pillars surrounding the space.

him so, that in terms of overall power and precision, John’s mind was no match for his.
boy, I’Chaya!” Sh’lok said, and produced from the air a disreputable-looking leather bag—the one from that other story his mother had read him so long ago: the bag that the King of the Winds had given Odysseus and warned him not to open. This version of it was stuffed full of T’Eyreen’s cold spite and everything else awful about the day, and tied tight shut. The bag’s virtue was such that for the time being, Sh’lok would be able to think about its contents but not be pained by them. Analysis and a full deconstruction of the experience could come later: but not tonight.

is having a good day.
At that John had to stop and turn to face the Vulcan. “Is that a threat?”
For long moments, unmoving, they looked at each other—assuming the term “looked” had any meaning in this context. John stood there with his phaser raised, ready to act, his blood singing with the danger of the moment. The creature meanwhile held its ground, neither advancing or retreating, as if sizing him up—
something said in the back of his head. John had learned early in his sequence of commands that these impressions, when he got them, were worth paying attention to. He filed that one away and examined the rest of the wedding party.
Sh’lok’s face went still and his eyes lit with an expression that John knew very well: deduction, in progress at high speed. “Yes, of course,” he said, “the entire landing party.” Sh’lok gestured with the phaser, his attention already going to the shocked-looking Lestrade. “Captain, stand over there. Doctor, it is time for answers—”

S’kroft stared at him in astonishment. “Thou
Sh’lok sat up on the diagnostic bed, swung around with what under the circumstances was frankly surprising speed, and gripped Greg’s forearm tight. “The Captain let me live,” he said.
Lost in wonder, John shivered as they stood there together in that moment, looking down into it as if from a height. John saw now not only what he’d seen then, but also, through
a body at the moment.”
John snapped the communicator shut and put it away. “Mr. Sh’lok,” he said, looking away.
The men with the bell-frames began to shake them. Slowly Sh’lok turned and walked toward the dais, and John watched him go with another wave of concern. Sh’lok appeared to be having trouble breathing; he looked
A party of six red-shirted security staff was lined up in the office, waiting for John. Sh’lok and Vanderberg stood to one side as John game them their orders.
said the clock in his head, even as she leaned in toward him. John lowered his face to hers, met her lips with his and let the moment stretch.
“I’ll do everything I can, John, to save her.”
“Explain.”
Lestrade shouted from the sidelines.
John nodded. “One less thing to worry about…”
And right now he so felt for her—as out of her depth, for the moment, as he was—that John gave in to the impulse to let her have that.
Abruptly the bells stopped.
John’s eyebrows went up at that, as everyone knew female voices cut through noise more effectively and commanded better attention from everyone who heard them. He shot a dry look of reaction at the others and said, “This is the Captain. Record security research, to be classified under my voice print or Mrs. Hudson’s.”
John thought,
“Additional data…” that dark voice said, dropping even lower, “is always desirable for optimal results. And most valuable when acquired first-hand...”
Abruptly the darkness and the immobility came undone as Sh’lok was forcibly yanked away from Lestrade. When his eyes started working again, Greg gasped for breath at the sight of John Watson, slapping a hastily scooped-up phaser against his hip and shoving the momentarily off-balance Sh’lok back against the diagnostic bed. “Still got questions, huh?” John growled. “Then let’s get you sorted!”
“He might,” Lestrade said, “but we're sure to lose
That didn’t surprise John: there were enough times he’d teased his friend about “those Vulcan ears” and their sharpness (in the sense that had nothing to do with shape). Nonetheless he raised his eyebrows. “Marriage party? You said T’Eyreen was your wife.”
And that turned out to be just as well… because that was the point at which matters became unexpectedly complicated.
“I see no logic in preferring T’Kait over me.”
The quizzical look that Sh’lok somehow found himself able to turn on John both reassured him bizarrely and caused him some pain. “John,” Sh’lok said. “Should I at any point notice your presence in my hair, I very much hope that Dr. Lestrade will be able to advise me on how to proceed, as I must admit the prospect at the moment leaves me somewhat at a loss.”
Though John spoke mildly, Vanderberg knew he was being schooled; his eyes narrowed a bit, but he made no more of it than that. “You'll have it. Just find that creature, whatever it is. I've got a quota to meet. Come on, Appel.”
Sh’lok said, sounding rather as if his patience had run out.
Sh’lok glanced down between them, where two erections were pressed together and being stroked gently by a large and capable Vulcan hand.

She turned and eyed him narrowly. “Are you feeling
He picked up his communicator and flipped it open while Lestrade tended to the Morgs. “Sh’lok!”
STAMFORD
John nodded. “There have been no live contacts with the Federation for over a year,” Sh’lok said. “As with many distant outpost worlds, much routine communication is automated… so nothing untoward was noted for quite a while until some of the communication channels either failed or began repeating data.”
“Not sure Vulcans would put it quite that way,” John said. “In any case, ladies and gentlebeings, being that our First Officer has saved this ship and its crew more times than I care to count, I think it’s a good idea that he should be allowed to continue operating uninterrupted at optimum efficiency. So your Captain intends to drop this matter and move on, and it would make him very happy if everybody else aboard could see their way clear to do the same.”
It lifted twice. “Correct.”
John walked past him out of the diagnostic room and bumped his shoulder against Sh’lok’s in a friendly way,
“Mr. Sh’lok,” John said, “I’m not talking about locations. I’m talking about life cycles.”
A few moments later it was starting to be laid bare. Scales, dark and red-gold, and plates as thick as shields, and fangs like spears it had; and in the side of that massive head, revealed as the last few tonnes of gold slid down and off it, a great closed eye.
“Fascinating,” Sh’lok said. And he really did sound fascinated. “It could explain much, Doctor. My medulla oblongata is hard at work apparently breathing, apparently pumping blood, apparently maintaining a normal physiological temperature and handling similar homeostatic processes—”
Sh’lok opened his mouth and closed it, glancing at John, and then down, and then away into the dark again. Finally, “Good,” he said, “I think that would be… good. I mean. That is to say…”
“Aye, sir.”
Science tunic with lieutenant-commander’s stripes.
“Oh really,” John said. “Well, I think we should look into that.” He stretched, pulling Sh’lok down with him, still stroking the one softly flushed ear. “Being very careful to do it by the book, of course…”
John nodded. “Take charge of the landing party, Mr. Sh'lok. I want some answers to all this.”

“Not worried about that slowing you down now?” John said under his breath, with a smile.
Sh’lok blinked. Blinked. Blinked again.
Sh’lok nodded. “Unquestionably. Tragically so. Yet…” He looked thoughtful. “There might have been difficult outcomes that did

Sh’lok gave John a humorous look, but it was a little edged with something somber. “Let him. He saved your life, and by so doing, saved mine. I think I can resign myself to taking his teasing meekly… from time to time.”
“Mr. Sh’lok—” Dimmock said from behind the Transporter console, sounding most unwilling to attract his attention, but not willing to take the chance of misstepping again.
“He said he was transporting down to the surface, sir,” she said. “Your orders were that no one was to beam down unless you authorised it.” She threw Sh’lok a glance that was extremely dry, but also amused. “And knowing Mr. Sh’lok’s
“Yes sir. Sigma Dra IV rates G on the scale…”
And he swung her around and held her against the console, under the helmet.
He let them all take Sh’lok away into the turbolift and sat in the center seat for some minutes until he was quite certain of his control. Then John went after.
Hey, let me help. You all right?
John swallowed.
Sh’lok shook his head. “No, sir,” he said. “We’re being watched.”

John looked over at Lieutenant Donovan. “Any contact, Lieutenant?”

had begun to reveal themselves. It had been so gradual a thing—irritability that he normally could have controlled with a second’s thought flaring up repeatedly and interfering with his concentration: appetite failing even when it would have been logical to hunger and to eat: and the dreams. The dreams that did not feature T’Eyreen, but rather… someone to whom he was far more positively disposed. And a re-awakening, secondary to the dreams, of physiological responses that Sh’lok for many years had routinely walled away from his day-to-day life as too tiresome to deal with.
“Aye, sir,” Anderson said, sounding most dubious, and glancing at John and then hastily away, as if trying to hide a thought.
“Aye aye, sir.”
He dragged himself to his feet and stared at the helm and the viewscreen. As he watched, Dimmock gazed around blearily as he pulled himself upright again. “What happened?”
There was no other possible word for it, especially not when you could feel it from inside and directly experience the nature of the emotion, the intensity of it.

with an absolute minimum of people witnessing the event. It had been Mrs. Hudson handling the controls in the Transporter Room, and the most important part of John’s treatment—meaning injection with the antagonist for the neural agent Lestrade had used to mickey him—had been handled within about fifteen seconds of him materialising on the pad. Once it had worked, the walk back to Sickbay had been uneventful, as the few crewmen they passed paid John no more attention than usual.
came,” she said. “Eight months ago.”
“He described it to me as meaning ‘marriage or challenge,’” John said. “In the distant past, Vulcans killed to win their mates.”
Sh’lok said silently.
John looked down at Sh’lok in some bemusement. “Such as?”
For moments he was frozen by the sound of a thin ragged wailing beginning far back in his mind. It was like his own when he’d gone out into the dunes all alone, night after night, to unburden himself of his grief after I’Chaya died. But that had receded into silence with the passing of years and the inevitable dulling of a child’s anguish.
By the time John had managed to get to his feet again Sh’lok too was up and coming at him, swinging it roundhouse-style again and forcing John back and back around the side of the dais. Again and again he dodged and jumped back out of range of those deadly slicing swings, his concentration split between watching for the moment when Sh’lok would lose enough focus for John to dart in and get that thing away from him, and the increasingly laborious business of getting enough air into his lungs to keep going.
“You lie!” the woman said. “You know me. You have said that. You came to take back the Controller!”
Sh’lok sat back down and folded his hands in his lap, staring at them like a schoolboy expecting a scolding. John, coming around to the front of his desk, stood there a moment in silence, wishing there was some kinder way to go forward with this… but he couldn’t think of one. Finally he simply said, “Lestrade has given me his medical evaluation of your condition. He says you're going to die unless something is done.
“—and you come back.” She stroked his cheek with the stylus. ”You
Lestrade went to the console over which the device hung and leaned against it, looking up with a combination of fascination and unease. The expression got under John’s skin and made it crawl a little. This was not only one of his officers, for whom he was responsible, but his friend and confidant. But Lestrade had his own pride and his own professional judgment, his own priorities and his own oaths to satisfy; he had as much right to gamble everything on a single throw as John did.
“Very well,” John said, “thank you.” And he ordered himself a salad, because Lestrade had been twitting him again about getting more fiber in his diet, and settled back to eat and see what would develop.
The room flooded with light again, blinding. Sweat popped out all over John as it hadn’t done when it was just the creature in there. A measured ten seconds later—seconds that felt like ages—Lestrade threw the switch again.

“Sh’lok,” the woman said in a voice that at least to Terran ears sounded surprisingly sultry, “it is I.”

“They will be prevented,” said Kara.
John shook his head, turning away toward Sh’lok. “It doesn’t make sense. There are no harmful life forms reported here. Our sensors didn't pick up anything that didn't belong on this planet.”
“I still do,” he said.
he thought.
John turned in the dimness, located the source of the sound. It was very close to him, wrapped in shadow.
“Thank you, Mr. Vanderberg. We'll need your complete co-operation.”
“This looks like it had an accident somewhere along the line…”
“Mrs. Hudson.”
“I saw,” Sh’lok said.
Sh’lok leaned against the door’s broad edge next to him, looking out past John at the slow stream of stars falling away behind them. “A remarkable vista,” he said.
She reached under the front placket of her skirt, pulled out one of their confiscated phasers, and pointed it at his chest.
John thought.
“Tell Sh’lok it worked,” John said.
so fucking sexy?
John thought. “Sh’lok,” John said more quietly, “I'm asking you.
Donovan’s earpiece beeped twice.
A moment later he had flipped John over on his back and seized John’s face, his fingers gripping into the nerve-pressure points on both sides. The meld instantly tightened down into something far more intense and focused than it had been for a while, a conflagration of sensation, of sheer heat and raw ravenous want. There was nothing gentle or tentative about Sh’lok’s contact with John’s mind this time. It was keyed toward showing that it could overpower the one resisting it if it had to, if it

power and class was by itself worthy of note.  John glanced over at the Science station. “What do you read, Mr. Sh’lok?”
—as if power was flowing into him through some obscure, long-open circuit that had just finally been closed. And John found himself reveling in the strength with which he was being held, as moment slid past moment and around him the air grew more charged with every breath. It was an embrace from which he had no desire to escape—which was just as well, because escape would have been impossible. He was locked inside the encircling power of arms that were holding him as if he was something vital, necessary for survival, never to be released again.
“Lieutenant Donovan,” he said, “contact the Halkan council. I wish to speak to them again.”
pressing down toward his throat and started trying to wrest control of it from John), it was finding ways out of the traps the universe kept dropping in his path. Partly it was because he had such good reason to find his way out of them now. The early talent that had crystallized itself out around the tempting target of the
“Stand by to activate your central viewer, please.”
“When?”
“It's possible.” And damn it all, there was that gleam in Sh’lok’s eyes—that indomitable curiosity, that unquenchable desire to unravel the unknown. This creature was a puzzle, one Sh’lok was determined to solve.
And now that other mind, so incisive but so eager to find the truth of something it had never dared contemplate before, was diving in deeper, out of the situational and into the personal, the emotional.
“I am instructed to wait until planet dawn over principal target to permit you to carry out our mission.”
It would be pleasure enough to see that superior little smirk wiped off T'Eyreen's face, but John had far, far better reasons for what he was going to do. He stepped forward and met S’kroft’s eyes.
John thought. “Plot an interception course, Mr. Dimmock,” he said. “Warp factor eight. Lieutenant Donovan, try to contact that ship.”
Sh’lok threw a sharp look at him. “What? I fail to see—”
Anderson glanced up. “Shall I correct orbit to new firing position?”
“No surprise there,” Lestrade said, “as I saw John’s boots in your gut at least twice, and at that point he’d kind of given up on being gentle.” He studied the readout on his padd. “Okay, some deep muscle bruising but no organ involvement. I’ll give you some sub-Q analgesia for that, but it won’t stop you turning all kinds of green and blue in a day or so.” Lestrade put the padd down. “Back in a sec and we’ll do your bloods.”
“I get a sense that you doubt they’ll have much further leisure for it,” John murmured.
unconcealable, unmasterable.
There was another problem, though. At Tantalus V, Sh’lok had been uncertain enough about the technique working even on a human. John shot a glance at the creature that was apparently regarding them from the stony floor. “You really think you can get through to that thing?”
Finally Bradstreet led them to a door at a T-junction of corridors. “Here, Captain,” he whispered.
least
we in this universe?”
There wasn’t much point in drawing this out any longer… at least not for today. “Stand by to beam up landing party,” John said. “And plot an extended orbit to clear disturbance. Watson out.”
His answers and his actions, all carefully couched and calculated, immediately made it plain to Sh’lok that he had no desire to destroy the Halkans: that he found the actions required of him (on which Sh’lok was quite happy to prompt him, via his communications with Mr. Anderson on the Bridge) not merely reprehensible but downright inexplicable: and that this John Watson had immediately understood himself and his people to have stumbled into a place where they did not belong—a place he intended to get them out of with all possible speed.
John saw the distress in her eyes—veiled, but there for someone who knew her well enough to read it. He nodded, acknowledging it, scanned down the text on the padd—which confirmed what she'd said, in much more ugly detail—and handed the padd back to her. Then he made his down to the centre seat, sparing it just enough of a glance to note the higher-backed seat, the padding. Someone had decided that this seat, from which millions of deaths could apparently be ordered and carried out the touch of a button, should be
“I think so. This may be one cell in a larger organism. An incredibly huge organism, in fact.”
It had to be his imagination that behind him he heard Sh’lok say, “No. We’re not…”
But not quietly enough. Kara turned, spotted them—
Sh’lok’s expression, to someone who was beginning to learn them, looked unconvinced. “I'm sure there is an answer. It simply has not yet been discovered.”
Thank God. Doesn’t help you today,
Not that Sh’lok quite dared to admit that to himself. The signs of growing intimacy that he seemed to be seeing in the waking world could yet be proven to be self-delusion. He had enough history of misunderstanding human response not to unequivocally trust his own evaluation of it. Better to remain silent, to make no untoward move that might irreparably damage something precious.
“Um.” A touch of embarrassment, well seasoned with amusement. “A man can’t be everywhere at once, Sh’lok…”
John was waiting for the turbolift door behind him to close. When it did he stood up and stretched, and then glanced around the Bridge. One by one he caught the Bridge crew’s eyes, and they went quiet, waiting for him.
Sh’lok swallowed hard against the ache in his throat. He wanted to pour scorn on this idea too, as something suggested or enflamed by the
“You keep forgetting about level one, Captain. I hope to teach you better before five years are out. At any rate, having also bestowed on the Eymorgs both a mythology of the dangerous uncontrollability of the Morgs, and the pain devices with which to hold them in thrall, the Controller then settled back to ignore them as much as possible and enjoy ten thousand years of intellectual pursuits unhampered by the annoying demands of a body.”
What processes would have to take place, physically, for Sh’lok to be restored to health? Bearing in mind what Sh’lok had told him, John had to entertain the thought that it might involve something as crudely
The next thing he knew, arms in medical blue scrub sleeves were reaching into John’s field of vision, and a hand with a hypospray in it was pressing the live end of the hypo into Sh’lok’s shoulder. Sh’lok let out a sort of anguished grunt and collapsed.
Dealing with the aftermath of the day's events, of course (and as usual), was going to take a while. John had to spend entirely too much time composing messages to Starfleet Command when he got back to the Bridge. As a result his supper was very delayed, and the chess game did not convene, or reconvene, until well after midnight.
Now there only remained the second half of the necessary intervention. His First Officer’s comments about the people the Captain of the
“That is correct,” Sh’lok said. “I am a loss to understand it.” And he frowned a bit. Sh’lok was not fond of being at a loss about anything, and John knew and recognized the look of a man who was not going to stop until he found answers.
The lean dark presence that materialized at his side after some moments simply stood there and said nothing, waiting to be noticed. After a breath or two John managed to look over at those cool patient eyes, which now had a sad cast to them that John couldn’t remember having seen there before. “Captain,” Sh’lok said. “I understand how you must…”
“One…two…three…” Sherlock Holmes counted the weeks on the calendar his stomach beginning to churn the farther he got in his counting. “Four…five…” he groaned and rubbed at his face with his hands. “Five…blood fucking five.” He shook his head and counted again…and again…and again until he couldn’t count anymore because quite frankly he had tears falling down his cheeks. “Not five…not four…God damn-it three would be bad.” He glanced at his watch and realized John would be coming home from surgery soon. Clearing his throat he tried to compose himself before his flat-mate and boyfriend joined him for the evening. “Right…get it together Sherlock, you’ll figure this out.”
“The ice cream.”
John began getting worried, “What isn’t.”
Sorry guys it's been so long since I updated this story!  I hope you enjoy!
“I wouldn’t.”
“Okay.” Sherlock simply said before heading out of the bathroom and then out of the bedroom with his suitcase in tow. He sat it down in the sitting room and then sat down himself to wait for Lestrade to pick them up.
John rolled his eyes, “I don’t plan on inviting anybody else to join us in the examination room.”
John did glare at the Detective Inspector but mostly focused on Sherlock. “You can have the desserts if you eat some REAL food item too.”
Sherlock sighed, “The photos smell funny.”
John sat up his eyes wide, was Sherlock really going to talk on the phone rather than continue to jerk him off? Oh this was so not good.
“Thank you for the permission.” John breathed as he leaned in and pressed his lips gently against the younger man’s.
“Care to stare?”
“Sherlock you know I love you and you know that you can be honest with me.” John said reaching over and taking his boyfriend’s hand.
“Ugh.” Sherlock grunted thinking about all the things he found completely distasteful about being pregnant.
“He seems to think she will be upset with him…with us.” John spoke up as he carried tea into the room. He wasn’t sure if Sherlock would want it but Mycroft always drank tea when he came by.
“I’m Hungry.”
John chuckled a little, “Sherlock I get it you don’t have to apologize.”
“What does that mean?”
“Sherlock!” John exclaimed knocking on the bathroom door.
John sighed and started rubbing his boyfriend’s back again. “I’m sorry.”
Sherlock sighed, “It is true and I’m not sure how I feel about it. Normally I have sexual intercourse with John because I know he needs it and there are times that I do too, but THIS actual horniness is different.”
“Being pregnant, you’re lucky.”
Sherlock groaned but walked with John to the front door of the cottage and knocked.
“You just stated a few minutes ago that you’re horny.” Mary said with a slight smirk on her lips.
Mary knew Sherlock enough to actually understand what was going on while John was completely confused.
“What is going on?” Lestrade questioned as he walked in the flat just in time to see Sherlock grab the bin and start violently vomiting into it. “Weak stomach all of a sudden Sherlock.” He teased not realizing how truthful that was.
Sherlock took the glass and took a few much needed sips of the cool liquid. He wasn’t going to tell John this was the third time he had done this that day. One because he knew his boyfriend would be worried well…as a boyfriend…and two he would be worried as a doctor. Right now Sherlock didn’t want either worried man in this bathroom so he didn’t mention it.
“Ha Ha!” John called after him before going into the kitchen to find something to eat. Of course when he opened the refrigerator he wasn’t surprised to find some sort of severed body part. This time though it wasn’t a body part of a human but of…was that a dog’s…? “Sherlock!”
“It is normal for him to do that and I just haven’t noticed?” Greg questioned not listening to John’s warning.
“Sixteen.” Mycroft muttered.
Sherlock grunted when his mum grabbed ahold of him and hugged him so tightly he was sure he would go into labor right then. Of course he was NOWHERE near time for that sort of thing but he was being overdramatic like always. “Mum stop.” He said after close to 2.56 minutes of cuddling.
John sighed and put his laptop on the night stand by his side of the bed. “The kitty calendar.”
They were heading in the direction of Baker Street, John looking out the window and Sherlock seemed to be doing the same thing when all of a sudden there was a hand in John’s lap, squeezing. John couldn’t help the squeak that escaped his lips. “Sherlock!”
John threw his hands up in the air, “Well there is no way in hell I am going to work this morning without getting you your test. Actually no I am not going to get a test.”
Shaking himself out of his shock Sherlock shook his head. “Nothing…I’m fine.” He answered the question he knew the doctor was going to ask next. “
“I said I was horny not aroused.”
“Of course I do.” Sherlock said and meant it with all his heart.
“Which was a complete bore.” John added. Even he had thought the case of the missing five footed cat was boring and quite frankly down right weird.
Sherlock frowned.
“Oh but you are.” Mary said reaching over and touching Sherlock’s knee in a friendly, comforting manner.
“I said Chickens.” Sherlock said as he started putting clothing into his suitcase.
“Of course not.” Mary said laughing some more. “Greg told me.”
Sherlock just glared.
“Smells of men’s cologne.”
Mary chuckled finding the couple completely adorable. Of course she wished SHE was still with John Watson but after 2 years she had moved on herself and found that she could get over the fact that her husband ran off with his male best friend. “Don’t be embarrassed John…my gosh for a guy who needed sex sometimes multiple times a day you were also very prudish.”
John grinned from ear to ear. “Wonderful!”
John must have been swallowing some siliva because he started choking. When he finally was able to talk he looked at Sherlock in shock. “YOU…Sherlock Holmes went five weeks without a period without telling me without getting a bloody test?”
Sherlock turned to look at John and sighed. “I need cases John.”
“We know Baskerville.”
“Furry.”
John smiled big, this was the reaction he was hoping for. Mr. Holmes walked over and patted John on the back. “Good job.” He said and smirked.
“Do you love John?”
Sherlock sighed, “Fine let’s go.”
“Coulda fooled me.” John mumbled looking down at his sock covered feet.
John nodded grinning like a nutter. “You’re pregnant Sherlock.”
Everybody looked at Sherlock like he had completely lost his mind. It was John who spoke up again. “We are NOT going to Baskerville, there are too many things that could lead to contamination and problems with the pregnancy and baby.” He said this forgetting that Donovan and Anderson were also in the room.
“Going to vomit again?” John questioned as he followed after his boyfriend only to find him standing in front of the toilet urinating. “Oh.”
John smiled big as he watched the interaction and thought he even saw a small smile on his partners face. Now if only to get him to turn around on talking to his parents and the wedding idea.
“Sherlock it really isn’t that big of a deal.” John said getting exasperated by the whole topic because quite frankly all the talk of sex turned HIM on.
“Oh Sherlock.” Mrs. Hudson walked over and gave him a gentle hug like he was going to break if she did any harder. “Congratulations.”
Sherlock nodded his head, “After IT happened.”
Sherlock got a contemplated look on his face but shook out of his thoughts rather quickly. “But seriously it was the OWNER of the chinchilla that you ready to get your rocks off.”
“Sorry?”
“I never thought I would see the day when Sherlock Bloody Holmes is planning to wear sweat pants out in public.” John said with a chuckle but held his hands up in defense when Sherlock gave him a death glare.
“That won’t matter.”
Sherlock didn’t care he was giddy as they all walked to the conference room to talk about the case with the other officers.
“Right.”
Sherlock glanced over at John in bed. They were both on their laptops doing various things but had been having an okay discussion about a Shakespearian play they saw earlier in the week when John decided to bring THIS up.
P.S. Thank you for the reviews & Kudos!
“Mycroft…”
John shook his head, “No we’re going out so get dressed.”
They were arguing about continuing their conversations with friends and family. They still had yet to talk to Mrs. Hudson since Mycroft had made an appearance. John wanted to get her ‘over with’ so they could focus on Mrs. And Mrs. Holmes. That of course was still something Sherlock was completely against.
“Oh.”
“Again I am simply saying you want sex and yet you are with me a man who like you mentioned earlier does not require sex more than once a month.” Sherlock was getting worked up it was obvious in his speech pattern.
John rolled his eyes, “I know what ‘funny’ means Sherlock.”
John sighed and got up. He moved Sherlock’s legs so he could sit down on the couch. He held his boyfriend’s legs in his lap gently. “You are not ugly nor do you look pregnant…and I find you quite sexy.”
“I’m not…”
John was still confused, “He is not even two months along he is not walking any different than before.”
John looked confused at first but then remembered, blushing bright red. “The chinchilla.”
‘Speak of the devil’ John thought to himself as he smiled at his friend, slightly thankful they could pause their conversation, or so he thought.
John rolled his now dilated eyes. “No shit Sherlock.” He whispered back
“But…”
To John’s surprise Sherlock flopped onto the bed with a tired sigh once they were in their room. “You okay?” he asked for the second time that evening. “Do you still have a headache?”
Sherlock couldn’t help but shiver at the feeling of John’s hands on his skin. “I simply thought you should know what my body is doing…just in case something is wrong.”
“I said ‘thank you’ for the water.” Sherlock said with a shrug.
“Riiight…”
“And the dog…parts…”
John ran a hand over his face, “Sherlock you could have slept with Irene ten million times but you didn’t. She called you the Virgin!”
Sherlock looked over at John, his eyes giving him a dubious look. “A child is NOT cute and cuddly, John.”
“You are a queen.” Sherlock said with his best smirk and stomped out of the sitting room to go use the loo. He swore he was using the darn bathroom every five minutes.
Sherlock nodded, “yes nothing.” But as he said this he turned positively green.
“You’re thinking too hard.”
“Are you ready to leave? If we’re going to get to Baskerville by dark we need to leave.” John said still not sounding thrilled but felt like he owned it to Sherlock to go since he had spilled their news all over the station.
Lunch was attempted when they arrived at the flat. Well it was successful on John’s part but completely unsuccessful on Sherlock’s.
___________
Both Mary and Sherlock looked at John like he needed to be carted off to the funny farm right that second.
“Chinchilla guy.”
This caused John to give Sherlock an inquisitive look but didn’t say anything out loud.
Sherlock just glared as he pushed past his boyfriend and flopped onto the bed his head going in his hands. “This is not going to work.”
“Sherlock you are behaving strangely are you sure you are okay?”
“Bin!” Sherlock practically screamed and was thankful that even though he was confused John grabbed the waist bin by his chair and scooted it in Sherlock’s direction.
“She was there…and I was there.”
Caught off guard about what to say Sherlock actually stumbled around his words. “I…I did this time, special case…very special about…about.”
“Yes odd…peculiar”
John rolled his eyes, “Of course we have sex.” He prayed that his boyfriend did not reach for one of the detective’s guns and use it on him right then and there.
John accepted the invitation to cuddle and wrapped his arm around Sherlock. “Okay even more of a reason to get to sleep.”
John rolled his eyes, “First off his name is GREG and secondly we don’t have a case.”
“I think we should go to the police station. I need to talk with George about a case.”
“But they are cute and cuddly…”
“Yes.”
John had NO idea where the suggestive comments were coming from but quite frankly he felt proud for ‘knocking’ up Sherlock…not that it took much effort obviously because they sure as heck hadn’t been trying. Realizing Sherlock was expecting an answer or comment or something he did. “I don’t see it as being bad. We’re in a committed relationship, we just happened to have sex and bingo.”
First off thank ALL of you who have left reviews and kudos they mean so much to me!
“Right yes!” Sherlock was so excited on the inside to have come up for a reason for his yammering. “That case about Mrs. Jasper’s cat.”
“Everybody…that you’re pregnant of course.” John said. “People don’t take kindly to finding out about babies after months of pregnancy.
“John you might want to let him have what he wants.” Greg said speaking up from behind his menu, ready to get smacked if that was to come next. Thankfully it didn’t.
Greg’s eyes went wide and he had to flop down in a chair to keep from falling over. “Excuse…me?”
“Can I sit up front?” Sherlock asked as they got their belongings and headed downstairs. Of course Sherlock got upset over the fact that both the other men insisted on carrying his suitcase down the stairs.
“Hmm?”
“Yes, right.” Sherlock decided to hang up the calendar but before he did he gave it a nice long stare and a good added glare that to his horror didn’t go unnoticed by John.
“How could you possibly have known?”
“Today.”
“I’m just now three months pregnant.” Sherlock exclaimed, his emotions getting the best of him. He subconsciously glanced down at his still flat stomach.
“I swear that little guy just did something to me.”
The kiss stayed chaste and loving but lasted a good few minutes before the two pulled back with equal smiles on their faces.
“I would rather not.” John admitted sympathetically. “But seriously Sherlock can we REALLY talk about this now?”
“A good one.” Mr. Holmes stated glancing at his son’s bouncing leg and slightly shaky hands.
“Die too obviously.” John said just be honest and trying to get a reaction out of Sherlock which he did.
“Do I?” John questioned with his eyebrow raised. “I’m not sure that I do because you sure as hell never tell me.”
Both John and Sherlock looked at each other than at the older man. “Wedding?”
“It’ll be fine Honey.” John said to the other man still rubbing his back.
“It IS a research facility who knows what the heck they are up to.” John pointed out as he finished filling his suitcase and placed it on the floor once he zipped it.
“I can tell when you’re thinking about something.”
Greg ran a hand through his hair. “I do have a case but it won’t be pretty and you probably won’t like it.” he said pointing at John when saying who wouldn’t like it.
“I’m what?”
It was then John realized he had been spacing out and quickly shook his head to clear the cobwebs and return to the land of the living and his possibly pregnant boyfriend. “Yes…sorry.”
“You’re being selfish…once again.” John said after a second of silence. “I don’t understand why you don’t want to have children with me.”
As they pulled up to 221B John paid the cabbie and walked with Sherlock up the stairs and into their flat. At this point Sherlock had ended his call with the Detective Inspector and was heading straight for the bedroom to pack.
“Of course,” John said smiling. “I would have said if something was wrong.”
“I want to make you happy. You just made ME really happy.”
“I take pre-natal vitamins now days father.”
“Humph.”
“Oh…oops.” John laughed again still thinking the looks his boyfriend was giving him were hilarious. “Come on we have parents to surprise.”
This caught Sherlock’s attention and he looked at his boyfriend with a raised eyebrow. “Is she telling the truth?”
Sherlock was quiet for a second before shaking his head. “Forget it.”
Sherlock put his teacup down on the table next to him and looked at his father calmly. “What kind of a question is that?”
“Fuck…” John hissed his head falling back against the seat.
“Oh ha.” John said rolling his eyes. “But seriously Sherlock you tell me point blank that you’re horny. Did you just want me to simply know or do you want me to do something about it?” as he said this he started to run his hand under Sherlock’s pant leg, rubbing his ankle.
John shook his head, “No you Git I am taking you WITH me to surgery and we’ll do a test there.”
“Pregnancy?”
John shook his head in the negative, “There was no time…and now I feel like you are trying to hide this…how I am not sure but what are you hiding Sherlock?”
“Huh?” Both John and Greg said at the same time.
“Really?” Sherlock asked actually sounding relieved. Even though he and John had been a couple for a year or so now Sherlock had still been rather aloof when it came to romance and sex. It was almost like the other man’s mind was so large and working over-time that it couldn’t process simple body functions like sleep and sex.
Sherlock also finished with his packing and sat his suitcase next to John’s before heading for the bathroom. “We are supposed to help figure out if they are doing anything illegal and if so help them finally get shut down.” He explained.
“I kissed her.”
“Right…anyway…” Sherlock cleared his throat. “You always had somebody and I don’t think…wait I KNOW you didn’t simply want the attention or shall I even say it…love…you wanted the sex.”
The elderly woman came to the door and was shocked to see the two smiling men. John actually smiling a true smile and Sherlock an awkward one but a smile non-the-less. “John…Sherlock, normally I come to YOUR flat.” She said as she moved out of the way so they could come inside.
“You okay?” John questioned as he sat down next to Sherlock on the couch.
“Why do we keep getting animal cases?” John questioned as he again looked at the ghastly images all around the room.
Sherlock surprisingly wasn’t thinking about anything to do with termination. Actually his mind was on vomiting…not at that exact moment but in the future. Realizing he should probably answer John’s question he nodded his head, “We’re having a baby.”
John had taken a sip of his tea and now it was being sprayed all over the sitting room floor. “What?”
Sherlock almost bounded out of the police station and out to the curb to hail a cab. On their way home he did something almost unheard of…for Sherlock anyway.
***BACK TO REAL TIME***
John had to admit that was true, “Well as long as it’s not a bloody gigantic hound I am okay.” He then made a face. “It’s not a gigantic chicken is it?”
“Right.” John said as he was thinking. ‘But of course would never make it known that you wouldn’t saying it about ME’.
Sherlock looked at John in disbelief. “You say that like it’s a good thing…well you try being violently I’ll numerous times a day.”
“Hmm?” Sherlock said playing dumb as he started to move his hand up to unbutton John’s jeans.
“Sadistic freaks.”
Hearing the change in tone in John’s voice had Sherlock’s attention. He turned to look at him with his own look of exasperation. “Can this not wait until we get home?”
“It’s after twelve…so therefore it is today that we have a busy day.” Sherlock explained as he turned and rested his head on John’s chest, something he never really did.
Sherlock was a bit taken aback by John’s tone but it also made him feel loved and protected. He made a face when John said the next part.
“Sure.” Sherlock said.
Sherlock glared, “You wanted me to eat something, right? Well this is what I want to eat.”
“Well I will tell you what *I* know.” Sherlock said.
Sherlock was quiet for a second and looked down at his fish basket and sighed. “Who?”
“Right.” Greg cleared his throat and headed for the kitchen, the tap could be heard turning on so John figured he was getting a glass of water for Sherlock, at least that would be nice.
Sherlock put his own computer down rather forcefully. “Would you give it a rest about the bloody calendar?”
John sighed and figured he would be in MORE trouble with the precious comment then he would explaining that Mary knew he was pregnant. “What I REALLY meant was that it’s a great thing that you’re pregnant.”
Sherlock flopped into his chair again and steepled his hands looking pensive but to those who knew him they could tell he was upset about something.
John was completely taken aback and looked at Sherlock like he had five hundred heads (the normal 3 was not enough). “What???”
Not wanting to get on that topic right then Sherlock changed the subject. “We can tell Mrs. Hudson tonight….get it out of the bloody way.”
“And I’m horny.”
Sherlock nodded his head, “I’m sorry for not having sex with you…all the time.”
“Why tell me this Sherlock? Did you want me jealous because it worked? You rarely kiss ME and we’re together.” John said feeling the urge to get up and move away from the other man but he didn’t want to be childish.
Please tell me what you think through reviews and kudos!
“You’re pregnant…it’s how things are supposed to be.”
Mycroft found the whole thing rather amusing but realized the time and stood up. “I must leave, but I will keep on you to talk with Mother and Father.” With that he sat his teacup on the coffee table and headed out of the flat.
Sherlock sighed as he filled in his boyfriend, flat-mate and work partner on their most recent case. Mrs. Harper had found her husband murdered the same way the family cow was killed the night before. Even though it was a connection between a barnyard creature and a human being rather than the normal human, human connection Lastrade thought it was good to bring Sherlock in on the case. The only problem was he didn’t realize how the various images would affect his friend.
‘Right he’s embarrassed’ John thought to himself but nodded to Sherlock. They got a cab and took it home in silence. Both men needing time to think things through…but both were thinking on the same topic.
Once there the men carried their bags into the inn and got their room reservations sorted. Of course this time around Sherlock and John were sharing a room while Greg had his own across the hall. They agreed to meet downstairs for a late dinner after getting settled into their rooms.
“It is?”
John rolled his eyes, “You are not.”
Sherlock looked at the calendar and then glanced quickly at his stomach another thing that did not go unnoticed but the doctor but thankfully in another way.
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he took the cup and went and did his business in the bathroom off to the side of the examination room. He blushed when he brought back the almost full cup.
“Figure what out?”
“Not like we’re having sex anyway.”
John stepped up ready for his hug that thankfully came because Sherlock actually looked like he was in the need of air. His hug from Mrs. Holmes was much shorter but John knew she cared for him.
John smirked.
“Funny?”
“Oh it’s mine only?”
“Yes?”
“Which is precisely why I cannot tell her!”
Sherlock sighed and looked at John who looked back at him in encouragement. “Oh for goodness sake.” He said throwing his hands up in the air, thankfully the glass had been put down at some point. “I’m blood pregnant.”
After about two minutes Donovan joined him at the sinks and leaned back against the counter. “It’s a good thing ya know.”
Sherlock turned his head to the side to eye his doctor. “How does one LOOK horny?”
“Another one?”
Sherlock’s face turned from a pout to a look of frustration. “I like sex and have always liked sex.”
“You’re also very sick most days and I worry about you.” John said softly, not matching Sherlock’s exclamation.
“Yes oh.”
Sherlock was a big shocked by the lack of words his boyfriend was using. “Everything alright?” he meant with the baby but assumed he could be asking John too.
“I sort of almost had sex with her too.”
“Actually…”
“I love you.”
John blushed bright red.
“And the cow?”
Sherlock heaved
Sherlock nodded his head, “Just a headache.” He actually admitted.
Sherlock sighed, “I take you on dates…to the movies and dinners.”
John actually chuckled for the first time since Sherlock’s admission and found that he was beginning to be okay with the idea. It wasn’t that he never wanted to be a father, actually it was the opposite. It had been Sherlock that he decided for both of them that they were not going to be parents. But here they were at his surgery just about to do various tests for pregnancy.
It took a good few minutes but soon the detective was opening the bathroom door looking as white as a sheet. “Jesus Sherlock.”
“Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft…your parents.”
“What?”
“Tented pajama bottoms would be a sign.” The doctor smirked causing Sherlock to roll his eyes.
“I knew before.”
John looked from the monitor and to Sherlock. “Oh yes everything is fine.” He patted his boyfriend on the leg in reassurance. “Do you want a picture?”
“What is with us having animal related cases recently? First the chinchilla and then the five footed cat.”
Sherlock pouted a little, “You make it sound like I have never found a woman attractive or that I have never had sexual intercourse.” He pointed at his stomach. “I have proof.”
