His lips started traveling upwards toward my cocklet and clit. With one swift moment he swallowed down my cocklet and started sucking, hard.
With a pat on his arms to stop, I said, “I am not cleaning this up later and this is a nice shirt. It isn’t going to be dirtied by food. Take me to the bedroom,”
I felt like I was forgetting something but that thought was banished as Tony pulled all the way out until only his tip was in me before pushing back in, faster this time.
With the last squeeze of my nipple that made me let out a small moan. He pulled his hand down and held my other thigh down until I couldn't move anymore.
I didn’t have much time to get used to Tony's tongue just resting on my pussy before he was full on lapping at my pussy.
Tony picked me up. Yes you read that right. I was surprised as well the first time he did it. His reasoning was that he bench pressed and worked on machinery, so he was used to picking up heavy loads. I probably should have been more offended when he said that, but it was our first time sleeping together.
When he started to go faster, I swear I don’t how that speed is humanly possible, my hands went from holding onto the sheet to his greasy, black hair.
Tony chuckled low and sinful that had me shivering before he picked me up again and was leading me to my room when I had one more thing to say.
Being a carrier is literally just a man that has the abilities of a woman. Like bitch I am more of a man than your boring ass middle aged husband who literally was cheating on you with another carrier down the hall named Don. Just because he later left you for him and their kid doesn’t mean you can judge me bitch.
Next thing I knew I was gasping because he was running up one of his fingers up and down my pussy lips before resting at my entrance. Soon he was pushing in and quickly setting a brutal pace that left me panting for more.
“You rest. I got you,” Tony said softly as he continued to pepper me with kisses and clean me up with a washcloth.
As he slipped down my favorite blue and white, lacy bra he kissed down my breast sending shivers down my spine.
I planned the dinner for the day that changed everything and planned to make the Danish dish karbonder for dinner and the Dutch dish oliebol for dessert. Then I headed for bed with the plan to spend most of the day, that changed everything, cooking and getting ready.
Even back when I was born and being a carrier was something to hide because a man having a pussy, dick, and small breasts, while also getting periods and having the ability to get pregnant wasn’t god's will.
Even though the judgy assholes who lived near us would always tell her to stop and teach me to be a man. Well fuck you Michelle of apartment 18 you also think that carriers are just women with dicks.
I squirmed before I looked up into Tony’s eyes as he straddled the lower part of my legs. His eyes were just staring at the wine drip all over my dick and seep into the lips of my pussy with arousal dancing in his eyes.
I closed my eyes as he continued to thrust into me. My hand was tight on my mouth as I continually moaned. I felt Tony’s calloused hands on the hand that was my mouth pulling the hand away from my face as his other hand removed my other hand from the tight grip I had on the sheets.
I had to banish the thought that the red would be a bitch to get out with the thought that this wasn’t the first red substance to be spilled on this bed. That title was for the July period incident that still has me deeply embarrassed even though Tony said that it was fine. At least I was able to send out the red alert text to Tony that told him that he wasn’t a father topped with siren/alarm emojis which makes him laugh every time.
“Yes,” the fellow answered after a moment, his eyes flicking nervously to Benjamino, who was standing at Steve’s left attempting to be unobtrusive. “I know his face well. All the shoe shiners know to look out for him. He is a fascist -” the man spat the word like it was dirty, and then seemed to catch himself. His eyes went big and darted fearfully to Captain Altera, whose attention had been pricked by a word he understood.
Greetings. So, some of you know this already but TheFault_InOurThought and I have some exciting life changes headed our way and with that in mind we are going to have to do some reorganizing.
The Germans were coming. The very air seemed to know it, grew heavy and thick with the foreboding of it. With Charlotte gone, there was only one route of escape left. They would go into the mountains to hide until the resistance could organize enough supplies and a safe route for the family to escape to Switzerland on foot.
“He’s also quite good with his hands too. Truly, Herr Stark I’m beginning to wonder if there is anything at all that you can’t do.”
The children had stopped singing, baffled voices trailing off to follow his enraptured gaze to the scene unfolding meters away.
They’d spent a few months trying to find recruiting officers dumb enough to believe they were past the age of eighteen or desperate enough to pretend that they did. And by then Austria had been desperate. Steve was sure that the only reason it had taken them as long as it had to be accepted was because of how desperately young (not to mention skinny) Steve had looked at thirteen. But the war had changed them all. People were starving, especially in Galicia where people had been starving long before the war had even begun. They were too hungry even to fear the Russian’s guns.
Steve couldn’t help but glance back at Natacha. He couldn’t explain it but he wanted her nowhere near either Mueller or his nephew. He was just in time to hear her telling Emil that he had no need to win the race in her honor as she had every intention of winning it herself.
It seemed to him one moment they were down in the lobby waiting for the arrival of the elevator and the next they were walking through the doors of the elegant double suite that was to be theirs for the duration of their stay.
Tony berated himself. It was one thing to let his thumping (and far too hopeful) heart get mushy over the man’s children, it was another thing to latch onto wishful thinking. He would imagine that many officers were less than genuinely supportive of the Reich, but that was a far cry from outright treason and rebellion. Many of those same men found it within themselves to follow their orders, no matter how distasteful. Captain Rogers was no doubt the same.
"I don't know." Stefen confessed, the word sounding torn from him. The room plunged into silence, but for the sound of harsh breathing.  Tony wanted to scream.
“I’ve been to a lot of coffee houses, Stark, including the Italian’s. There really aint much difference.” Bakhuizen countered and Tony, bored with the line of conversation already, plucked up one of the sweet cakes and gestured with it as he explained.
Anamarie's whisper came back to him and the question she'd asked him. Was he the kind of person who acted on knowing what it meant to be a good man, or did he just wish on stars?
It was an insult, after these many weeks when Dvorak had seen to the training of the regiment all by himself – his long overdue leave was now being interrupted to travel some miles in the rain and snow, to urge along the man's recovery. He was to take Major Rogers and escort him back to the regiment where they would assume their posting. Dvorak had received sobering instructions to answer any resistance with the full measure of the law. While the idea of Rogers facing judicial punishment over something as pathetic as a cold was practically glee inspiring, his enjoyment of the situation was dimmed by his subsequent demotion to a fetching maid.
Steve’s heart sank in his chest with dread. It was the same with two others he asked. Everyone had the same story. The Hall had been gutted. No one was left and if they were they were in no sort of shape to leave.
Mueller was not a neighbor but Steve knew plenty of him. He’d been a policeman in the city for years, an early Nazi supporter long before anyone could even dream of Germany annexing their country. He was SS now, and very proud of that fact.  But Steve hadn’t known he was married, let alone that he had a teenaged son.
They were all moving and talking after that but what really struck Steve nearly deaf and dumb was Artur, who took one look at him and made an explosive noise of delight, zooming toward him like a bullet to target.
“Sure.” Bucky answered with a lazy smile and Steve didn’t protest. Coulson slowly withdrew a small envelope and slid it across the table towards Steve.
Bahkuizen had accused him of cowardice, but that was just the pot calling the kettle black. Everything that dog did was out of the fear of losing his precious family. ‘Famila’ he called it, or some other foreign nonsense. Bahkuizen must have seen his own fate in Dvorak’s face, because Dvorak was dead. He’d accepted that the day his girls had been taken. Some men reserved their suicide for private spaces. Others preferred to perform in public and call it a rescue attempt.
When Joshua clapped his hands together and rubbed them suggesting that they get started Tony was about to insist on offering his help when the man looked him up and down and said, “With you helping it will cut the time in half. I hope you’re good with your hands.”
Our prayers have been answered. The Brothers are to be released into the hands of Cardinal Rossi. I am to journey with the brothers and the Cardinal to Engzall Abbey and then further onto Rome at the abbot’s request to give his report. I must admit the thought of standing before the cardinals makes me sick with nerves, but I am so grateful for the Mercy our Lord has shown the Brothers from Engzall that there is hardly room even for nerves. Arrangements are still being made, and these things take much time and paperwork as you know, so I will likely be here in Dachau for a few weeks longer. I will send word to you when I am to depart, and when I am home again at St. Péter’s.
“Captain Rogers is a powerful man Antony. He has ties to every office in this country, be it military or political. Not to mention he has friends abroad. You called him ‘the favored son’ and I suppose that’s true. He’s a symbol of Austrian strength and nationalism.”
Hammer looked up at the sound of the chauffer's voice and his smile, reeking of smug satisfaction, made Tony’s stomach churn as the butler chortled and sneered at them all. “I wouldn’t hold my breath on him coming back. Desertion is treason, and that’s punishable by death.”
Stefen looked so disturbed at the thought of Tony not being there, that it was hard for Tony to ignore his thumping heart of the way that blood wanted to rush to his cheeks.
Steve had to fight to unclench his jaw before he broke it. Around him he could feel the tension from the others, thick enough to cut with a bread knife. Over in the lounge chair, Pike, a retired Captain in the German Navy stirred, blinking his eyes slowly open from his interrupted sleep before leaning forward and looked at them all, gritting out through his teeth.
“It’s a series of short stories about the life of an adventurer and his brother. They travel all over the world looking for ancient artifacts, battling barbarians, wooing pretty women and the like. The stories could be better in my opinion but the artwork is so thrilling it makes up for it.”
He flashed back to that day outside the music room, it seemed so long ago now, when Tony had admitted to idolizing those old war stories about him. He'd said he'd sobered up, kept going despite the horror he'd lived through because Steve had given him courage. Tony wasn't a boy anymore but Péter still was...
“You’ll have a code book and I’ll arrange for a runner to come for the messages you’ve transcribed. Be sure before you agree. It’ll be dangerous, putting your voice out there. If the Germans ever intercept a broadcast they will be looking for you.”
At the mention of the Captain Natacha perked to attention. She lingered behind as the rest of her siblings filed obediently out the door at Frau Hogan’s insistence, catching the older woman’s eye when the last of them had disappeared.
“I know!” Tony cut him off, grabbing Péter’s arm and then Ian, who was closest, and tugging them in the direction of the truck. “Hurry. Get to the truck. The barrels. Cover yourselves. Right now! Go!”
But father had given him Calico Bush. Mama had read it to him every night even when he’d been sick, and when Mama had gotten sick he’d read it to her. She’d liked when he read to her. It had helped Da sleep. It helped Ian sleep when he missed them. It was all he had left of either of them and James had just thrown it like it was garbage!
The motion of Steve’s head slowed down, his mouth dragging down Tony’s shaft with an uncoordinated scrape of teeth that drove a hiss of pain from Tony even as something electric danced down his spine. He’d never felt this way before, never wanted to take something so badly and come down another’s throat like a perfect heathen, and he’d slept with seasoned professionals. There was no artifice to the way that Stefen sucked him. No skill, too much teeth, and his strength was flagging by the second, but Steve was looking up at him between sweat soaked bangs with hazy eyes that begged him to take the reins, to take them both where they needed to be and Tony couldn’t have turned away for all the angels in the heavens.
As she stepped back into line the little boy on her left (the real Artur) hissed at her that it wasn’t proper to say such things and Maria indignantly hissed back, “And why not? Don’t you think he’s pretty?”
“I think he and Göring are the best thing for Germany. I do. I know they’re very different in their ways, but I had hoped…” Fischer trailed off, leaving the thought unfinished with a sigh. “Hitler is right. We must preserve the German way. Restore Germany’s glory.”
Tony just barely resisted the urge to roll his eyes at the way he managed to make hours sound like months.
“Tony would you please?” He pleaded, looking apologetically at the monk who looked supremely uncomfortable all of a sudden. “I know it’s an inconvenience but it’s just for the night. He’ll be more reasonable when he feels better.”
The Generals wanted the Führer kept alive, and to make a public show of his trail.  They said it was the only way to ensure that the public did not revolt. Hitler was not without love here in Germany after all. They were confident though that the people’s desire to avoid war would prove stronger than their loyalty to a fallen Emperor, but privately Steve didn’t think it would be that easy. Hitler would not go quiet and he was too dangerous to keep alive. A fight was a fight. Stray bullets killed men all the time.
“No more of that!” Tony snapped in warning. “If you lot can’t behave yourselves we won't be doing this again. I have many other things I could be doing with my time.”
that he’d refused to eat potatoes for years. He’d had to get older before he realized there was a whole lot wrong with the secret adventures he and his mother had shared, and a whole lot of other reasons besides potatoes for his nonna to bear such a terrible sadness.
Tony could have made a fair guess at this stage but he wanted to hear it in Stefen's words. He shook his head and Stefen nodded, as if he'd been expecting just that answer before saying, "There is a saying among my people, 'when I die, burry me standing. I have been on my knees all my life.'
Beside him Bucky inhaled sharply. Steve didn’t look at him, though he could feel the anger in his stare. He’d not shared this news before but only because it was as recent as this morning’s round of meetings. He’d had no intention of keeping it secret because there was little point. They’d known it would happen. It was only a matter of when.
Tony had no idea what to say to that and no intention of touching that statement with a ten-foot pole. He knew Farkas was making his decision so he just waited.
Bed. They needed a bed. But Stefen tasted faintly of mint and something deeper, something so Stefen, and Tony groaned, sliding his tongue against Stefen’s and chasing after his taste. He wanted more of it desperately but sharper was the ache for touch, and Tony’s shaking hands stroked franticly over the long column of Stefen’s throat, down the back of his neck and over the breadth of his shoulders to catch on the straps of his suspenders.
Brow furrowed, Steve stepped up next to him to look out onto the street below them. Ants. The improbable thought popped into his head. Artur would have said they looked just like ants. There had been people loitering around outside of city hall when Steve had arrived but there were dozens of them now, forming a thickening mass of bodies blocking the steps. Several young men stood on the steps with their backs to the building and were speaking to the crowd. They were HJ Steve noted, and among the crowd they’d managed to rally Steve could spot at least fifty more. Even from their distance Steve could hear the faint sound of their raised voices.
Bucky blinked at him, trying to calm the rushing in his ears. When had Steve come in? He needed to relax, he scolded himself. Breathe in. Breathe out. The last thing the kids needed was another adult losing it on them. Bucky eyed Steve warily as the children shifted uneasily in their chairs, hyper aware of Steve as he doggedly went through the motions of putting food on his plate. Bucky had to suppress a flicker of irritation as he watched. He'd bet his violin Steve wouldn't touch any of that food.
surprised to find him on the terrace of all places, sitting at the table with a sketchpad open, pencil scratching away at paper. Bucky was happy to see it, as it had been far too long since Stefen had taken the time to draw anything. He only wished it wasn’t the dangerous endeavor of passing coded messages that had brought it back again.
"It's not as exciting as playing hero, but somebody from the family had to make an appearance at the rally. Charlotte agreed."
It was a slight. A cruel and unearned one that a lesser woman would have been crushed by. Charlotte could not pretend that she had not considered tossing her drink over the man’s head when he’d come to her out of the blue with his proposal, like she was a dog he expected to find waiting faithfully at the door for his attention.
Hammer looked outraged, swelling up and opening his mouth to retort but he choked on whatever he was going to say as the lieutenant glared him into silence. The officer looked pained, but not for the reason Tony would have expected.
“Fine, Chavo,” he grunted in reply, praying that was the end of the boy’s insistent questions as his brain throbbed inside his skull like a heartbeat.
If any song is the "title track" of this story it's this one, and as Tony and his new family say goodbye to the happy days of summer and step into a much darker phase of their journey, we'd like to introduce it to you. So, you might be wondering. Out of all the music out there why did we choose a song released in the 1990's as our story's signature piece?
“Tony?” Maria questioned, her brown eyes going wide with worry as the feeling of tension in the room sank in. “Did we do something wrong?”
The Avenger was a beautiful vessel if Tony didn't say so himself.  Steel boned and constructed of his very own high strength plywood. Her cherry wood gleamed brightly in the pale winter sun, her name standing out boldly in gold script. She had two long benches in the back where six men could sit comfortably with moderate leg room, and an enclosed cockpit large enough for two to man the controls.
“Major Rogers is right.” Khalmmer finally said into the silence and Steve’s eyes flew to his. “We are not the monsters our foreign enemies paint us. Only, just last week I oversaw the removal of a band of illegal Jews…”
Steve couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen Natacha cry. She must have when her mother had died, he knew that logically. But no matter how hard he tried to remember, all that he recalled was her pale face and her skinny arms and legs drowning in a black dress. Her vibrant hair had been tamed into a severe bun because her mother wasn’t there to help her get the curls she liked and Virginia insisted that buns were more practical for a funeral.
She’s got a chance to go back home. She’s young and pretty. She could maybe find some fellow willing to overlook the fact that she married outside of her own people the first go around, sit pretty and maybe once a year think back and wonder what might have become of Naomi; but instead she sticks by her, journeys into the mouth of the unknown just so they can be together. She had faith that whatever life they built together no matter how poor would be better than any she could find on her own if she turned her back and walked away from what was right. She must have found who she wanted to be in Naomi’s family… I’m envious Péter. I’d like to be so certain. Wouldn’t you?”
“I know it's hard to see it now but you must trust me. There are people working to put an end to this, people who would do anything to stop us from going to another war. "
At the greeting Bucky slowly glanced up at the children's tutor. He’d been purposefully avoiding meeting Stark’s gaze. He'd prefer to leave that problem for later in the day but one real look at Stark was enough to know that had been a mistake.
Thank you for reading. We know these updates take us ages what with busy lives and how long they typically are, but we appreciate you all so much. We read every comment. They give us fuel and motivate us to get across the finish line each time.
Tony was as anxious as he was curious to know what purpose Stefen could have discovered in the last few weeks to bring about these changes, because it struck him as eerily familiar.
Tony was glad to see Bucky back safe after the horror of the pogroms. They'd stretched all over the Reichland, from Salzburg to Berlin. Anything could have happened to him out there; but that just made Péter's absence at his side all the more noticeable and Tony's chest tightened with dread, certain that them not having entered together meant that Bucky had not been able to find him.
“You should have told me before.” She accused, rising from her chair. “I could have made a mistake with Frauline Werner.”
"Will Father be at home when we get there?" Artur, who was sat on the long seat opposite the seat the girls had chosen, asked halfway through the ride and the baroness had smiled sympathetically at him with a shake of her head and a wink.
“Corporal. Stop by the barracks. I need a change of uniform,” He commanded, leaning forward to ease the pressure on his legs. Riding in side car was like trying to cram himself in a suitcase.
"No. She always sleeps with it. We looked for it to pack but no one could find it. We have to go back!" The others began to lift their voices in agreement, offering a ridiculously long list of items that had been left behind that they apparently couldn't live without.
“Because Hitler sends his troops where they don’t belong to take what never belonged to him.” Steve broke in, rage simmering just under the surface. “Or did you forget that?”
“What did you do?” She finally asked, creeping an inch or two closer. Steve clenched his fists, but by some miracle he held still this time.
They’d attacked. Beat at him with their weapons and torn a screaming Maria right from his arms. James and Artur had jumped on the back of the man attacking him, allowing Tony to get the upper hand. Natacha and Ian had flown at the other as soon as he’d grabbed Maria. The man had swung the pipe into Ian’s stomach screaming he was a Jew Lover. Natacha cut him with something sharp. Tony had not seen what, had not waited more than a second after the man had staggered back from the children in shock before tackling him, twisting the heavy piece of piping out of his grip and beating him with it until he didn’t move anymore.
“What kind of a question is that? Why are you a captain?” He shot back defensively, but Stefen ignored it, pressing on with a patient look.
Steve sighed, his chest was so tight with anxiety he could feel the muscles click and shift over bone. He had a right to feel so miserably anxious and no right to complain. He deserved it. He’d neglected Charlotte these last few months and she wasn’t the type of woman above punishing him for it. As far as power moves went this wasn’t bad. It certainly made it obvious what she had in mind for him to do when she arrived.
It was the dead of night when an armored truck rolled to a stop outside an unassuming apartment building in the city of Berlin. Steve was crouched in the back with fifteen other men, ammunition and gear rattling against his legs. He had a small velvet bag open in one palm, the beads he’d purchased at Pippen’s shop what felt like years ago now rattling softly as Steve and the others were jostled by the movement of the truck. He rolled one of the beads between his fingers fitfully, marveling at the unusually deep red of the coral.
“No one can see you!” the man hissed through clenched teeth. “No one! Understand? Not a stranger hiking, not a child that happens to be wandering, no one.”
“That was a long time ago. I don't think I know this place anymore,” Sam finally said into the silence with a heavy sigh and Steve frowned, turning to counter him as outside the train station came into view down the block.
"They'll call you a defector when you don't report to the next city on the tour. They'll find out and they’ll take us all away!" She hissed, her fingers digging into his coat and twisting. She wasn't strong enough to move him, she knew that in her head, but there was no stopping in her. In that moment she would have pulled down a pine tree if it got in her way.
“Damn you! You and Bucky are both the same. Do you really think I’d die without making arrangements for them?”
Tony touched one of the frames, gently running his finger over the finish. How many battles had the captain fought? Had he been honored for all of them? He must have. He wasn’t that old and yet there were so many of them. There were ten that he could count, gold and silver pelted stars all just as pristine as the butler Rogers employed to run his house.
did he insist upon holding himself aloof? Pure stubbornness, Tony decided observing the man as he silently ate his dinner, doing very little to engage in the conversation Bakhuizen kept up with the children despite Ian’s longing looks and shy attempts to rope him in.
“My word James, are those necessary?” Frau Hogan had exclaimed, shocked at the sight of the weapons.
Her eyes widened even as her brow furrowed deeply in puzzlement, as if she were trying desperately to unravel the meaning behind the gesture and didn’t quite trust the conclusion she was coming to. They hadn’t spoken privately since she’d confessed to poisoning her father he realized. He wondered if he’d even touched her and couldn’t think of an instance. It had been too long since he’d seen her genuinely happy like this, and he knew how quickly this moment would fade. He’d been so wrapped up in Stefen’s recovery he hadn’t stopped to think what she might need from him.
“I don’t think it was that. I think he just didn’t want to mix up the work with his family.” Kirk shrugged. “He was the same way about the wife. You’d see their faces, hear their names on people’s tongues, but then you’d start thinking about it and you’d realize you did’t know anything about them. Not really.
Tony thought privately. It was not as if Stefen had any interest in a celebration, or Tony and the children any reason to think they wouldn’t just be in the way.
Once resigned to the fact that he couldn’t escape it Ian took to his lesson with single minded vigor, determined to abolish the discomfort of finding himself in an arena where he wasn’t capable (where he couldn’t
He was stroking in earnest now, sweat prickling at his temples, one hand rubbing without conscious direction at his stomach. Up and over scars and patches of skin that alternated between deadened and electric with nerves.
That revelation was enough for Steve to pull his eyes away from the curious old woman and shoot Tony a look and the monk just smiled winsomely back. Susann’s eyes looked Tony up and down with amusement. There was a clever gleam in her blue eyes as she murmured, “A monk. I suppose it
Natacha was a leader like him in the Young Maidens and looked incredibly grown up in her uniform, her red hair bright in the late summer sun. She did well, but Péter knew she wasn't well liked among the other girls. Partly due to their jealousy of her wealth, her name, and the station it had granted her, but mostly because Natacha held herself apart and came off as stand-offish.
So here they were, together, Dvořák following him into the breach. And not just Dvořák either, there were others of course, all throughout the Wehrmacht and the Abwehr, civilians and enlisted men alike. There would have to be, one didn't assassinate an emperor without help.
"Is there something the matter Ian?" Stefen turned to the younger boy to snap in exasperation and Tony winced.
. I’m so sorry.” He murmured over and over and over again. When he squeezed her tight and pressed a firm kiss to the side of her brow and said, “It’s going to be okay darlin’. You’re strong,” she believed him.
He started with the barn. A good look through it told him someone had indeed been there. There were footprints, blankets and a few scraps of discarded bandages buried in the hay in the goat pen near the corner. The straw was pressed down in the farthest corner in a shape too big for the old goat who bleated loudly at Bucky’s intrusion and kept sniffing around at his hands like the horse he’d had as a boy.
As the cars made the short trek from the inn to the prison Dvorak contemplated his options. A living man might have fretted over Schmidt’s ominous words. But Dvorak was dead and unconcerned with how it happened, only that before it did, he struck one final blow against the regime. A fatal blow, though they may not recognize it as such now.
A brief conversation was held before one figure separated from the others and hurried back aboard the ship, leaving the woman with the two others (yes it was two now, he could see them better now that they were coming back toward the lamps). And it was two children he noted as they passed by his window. A gangly boy in a cap and a skinny girl with unwashed brown hair in tangles.
Sneak in. Sneak out. Like a whisper. Like a god damn apology. All to rescue a handful of innocent men. And then what? What about all the others?
, here in the haven he’d built for himself, with the family he’d built to replace the one he and Bucky had once had together.
If he could somehow attain the man’s loyalty and get him to adhere to some semblance of sense, Steve knew that there was a chance the children might come out of this unscathed. It was something to believe in surely, a reason to keep fighting.
The silence kept pressing in, that water flooding in his ears and covering his head, sucking him down down down into the black. Steve barley felt the back of the chair hit his legs as he collapsed into it. Everything in him was falling apart, separating into jagged pieces, and yet he was numb to it. Numb to everything because his family wasn’t there, and he was… nothing.
Prince Loki met them at the door, nodding to the attendant who quickly took his leave and shut the door softly behind him.
“Here, James let’s get you dressed.” Tony offered gently, despite agreeing with Natacha that this little production of his was beyond ridiculous. It was not a battle he wished to have this morning, so if James needed to pretend like he didn’t know how to put his pants on then Tony was willing to indulge him. But James was having none of it.
Tony had never forgiven him for that. Not the preventing him from throwing away his life on a forgotten battlefield thing. Tony would never forgive Hughard for taking away his home.
“Better be quick about it Stark. We need to get the kids fed and dressed if they’re going to have enough time for lessons before brunch. Stevie wants them to make a good impression.”
He had his suspicions, but he didn’t like not knowing for sure. He wasn’t used to not being able to predict Stefen. Even at his most stupid and stubborn Bucky could always predict Steve, read him like a damn book, but Stark was an unknown variable who had already proven adept at getting Steve to react in ways that Bucky would not have put his money on.
“Forget it Tony. I’ve already taken care of it so that they won’t bother you again. I really do not understand you at all Stark. You’re the one always urging us to go!” Stefen sat up suddenly with a growl and Tony quickly slid off him to avoid being toppled to the floor.
Ian's gaze moved to his father, the other person in the crowded room he found himself watching closely. He wasn't the only one either. Baroness Schrader had barely let him out of her sight. Probably so she could stop him from making a scene when either he or Natacha inevitably slipped out of his line of sight.
It was too easy to feel a boy again, standing in his father’s nobler shadow, desperately trying to live up to an impossible ideal even as he was reminded that he did not deserve second chances any more than he had deserved the first one; that the day he had first drawn breath was a blight in the grand order of somebody elses perfect world. There was a singular comfort to be found in forging metal: in the reverberation of each strike through muscle and bone, in the singe of spark and flame against hair and skin. Proof that even the hardest of materials could be persuaded to reformation given the right minded hands. There in his workshop, Tony Stark’s hands had always been right and his mind sound, even if nothing else about him ever had been.
Susann’s eyes danced with quiet amusement at his reaction and next to him Tony coughed suspiciously into his hand.
“Surely Jurgan, you appreciate the delicateness of the situation? Count Shrader just financed new headquarters for the entire 8
The thought of losing control of his mind like that in public had shame twisting up his insides, but worse was the thought of losing himself and hurting one of his children (again).
“Susann, you look wonderful …” And she did, every inch of her Swedish heritage from her height to her fine blond hair presented at its best in the simple but elegant style Themen was so known for, but Steve stiffened, feeling the unmistakable poke of her stomach against his, and hastily stepped back as if he feared he’d burn her. “God you’re… congratulations!”
“I’m fine,” he managed to bite out, the words stuck behind his teeth as he swallowed down a groan of pain.
, in so many ways, ways that Steve had not even considered before he knew - god damn it, where was he?!
Artur was beside himself chasing pigeons and then a stray cat napping on a step. Sara gasped and shrieked when the water fountain in the town square shot water straight into the air and droplets sprinkled their faces. The amount of times one of the bicycles Tony had repaired went crashing to the ground as its owner scuttled off to point out some benign object or wondrous new sight, had Tony in a constant state of cringing.
"Only the people can speak Romany and your father speaks to us, though he speaks differently. Our family, we are Sinti. They are cousins to the Roma, but we are all Rom, all family. Bah, what am I saying this to you for? You don't have a clue what I'm talking about do you gadje-boy? " Pietro laughed unkindly and Péter glowered at him.
“So what did you find?” he asked and Pavlok nodded, beginning with the first document in the folder and sliding it across the desk for Tony’s review as he spoke.
? But he flipped dutifully to the pages behind the velvet ribbon as Tony had indicated. For a moment, his eyes raked over the page, taking it in.
It wasn’t goodbye. It wasn’t. It wasn’t. It – Stefen tore himself away, shoving Tony backward until he stumbled against the bed, his whole body aching like he'd been stabbed.
“I’ve sent off an announcement for the papers. It’s done, and there is no sense in delaying. A winter wedding will be fun for all of us. We can be in Switzerland by spring.”
“No doubt we have divine influence to thank for such a miracle. Did I hear correctly that you are teaching the children to sing?” he asked, eyes flicking to Herr Stark who tensed under the man’s scrutiny. “Herr Stark was it. No relation of course to the late Hughard Stark?”
Tony removed the stiff stockings from Stefen’s feet. He began to rub gently at their soles, doing his best to work out the tension in in the muscle. Thankfully his seizers had tapered off, but he still suffered muscle cramps after long periods of activity. The full day they’d had must have been agony, but he’d born every second of it with determined positivity for the children’s sake. He was such a noble idiot at times, and Tony loved that about him. Loved him so fiercely it angered him, that Stefen could think of himself as anything but good. Not perfect, but so heartbreakingly good.
When Tony caught the corner of the captain's mouth tugging upward as if he might smile, he laughed under his breath. What a pair of geese they must appear. He had no doubt that Pepper and Willamina were spying from the kitchen.
“What the hell are you doing Stevie?” Bucky asked as soon as they heard the faint sound of running water coming from the bedroom.
His mind flittered back to the shops. Tony wouldn’t try running far with the little ones. He’d look for a place to hide. Many of the shops had apartments upstairs, attics, cellars… Steve took off like a shot.
He looked up, catching Bucky’s eye across the space through the open doors and realized that the low vibration in his chest was humming, coming from him no less. Bucky winked at him and Steve let the tension in his shoulders slide away, returning to his task.
“Do not play games.” Schmidt said slowly. Enunciating every syllable as if it were a knife slicing flesh.
"There are clergymen imprisoned at the camp. Abbott Farkas has been working with the Vatican to see them released." he explained.
“When I am alone, I sit and dream on the horizon but all the words are missing.” Tony began to recite from memory. “Yes, I know that even in a room full of sunlight, there can be no light if you are not with me. Open the windows, show everyone my heart. Close inside of me, the light that you brought from the street.”
“It’s not been tried on you. Yet.” The man leaned toward him, his eyes glittering and his voice seeming to go softer with every spoken word until it was just above a whisper. Yet. Tony had never been tortured, didn’t know what it was like. Yet. As if he could see the fear in him the agent’s mouth curled into a smile. “I’ve broken stronger men than you, Tony Stark.”
“Do you know what order these go in?” Peter asked, brown eyebrows arching as he considered the pages and Ian nodded slowly. He knew where every word went.
Not in so many words, no, that wasn’t the important bit. I knew he’d been in combat and I could see that he was fatigued. I was a doctor. I treated wounds. Not all of a soldier’s wounds are visible.
The wooden post he was tied to groaned in protest as the ropes pulled against it, and Steve had a fleeting moment to be glad there was enough give in the rope that he hadn’t jerked his arms out of socket falling over like that. But then he remembered the eyes, no doubt those of his captor, and all of his thoughts were consumed with impotent rage. It burned through his veins and into the back of his throat. Caught. He was caught, again. Steve bellowed, an aggrieved roar, his entire body trembling as he struggled to regain leverage and lunge at the threat. So close. He’d been so close.
Rogers had turned the entire office of the Wehrmacht into a circus. That was the major source of Dvorak’s annoyance if he were honest. Why was it always Rogers?  HIs absence from his post along with his sudden disappearance from the public eye had not gone unnoticed, and the army was scrambling to either find an acceptable excuse or render the sort of swift punishments the Führer would expect in the face of such audacity. Rumors had spread about some sort of illness, but that cover grew thin as the days passed.
"He was as skinny as a pole, nothing like now. He had this terrible accent. We all called him our Goulash Rat."
“It’s for liabilities sake.” He announced suddenly, as if the thought had just occurred to him. “It wouldn’t do for Major Rogers to fall so ill under the Führer’s watch. The Reich looks out for its own.”
Péter glared and opened his mouth but Charlotte's hand gripping his shoulder paused, and the baroness gave Bucky an irritated look. "Really James, violence is not the answer to everything." To Péter in a softer tone she suggested, "Your uncle has been making your father soup. It's the only thing he seems able to keep down."
“No! I-that won’t be necessary!” Tony had been prepared for a great deal of things but he would not, could not answer to a whistle like some sort of trained canine.
Steve nodded and abandoned his seat at the bar, striding through the semi-crowded room towards a secluded booth near the back. He’d chosen the location for the meeting carefully because he knew the exits as well as the man who ran the establishment. If Coulson was surprised by his taking charge he didn’t show it, taking the seat Steve and Bucky left open for him. It left him with his back to the doorway, and Steve was no highly trained secret agent but he thought the man had to know. Even so Coulson accepted it, his calm demeanor never wavering.
Tony hummed sympathetically, the way one does, and Pavlok replaced his spectacles and took his seat. Sniffing his perky nose he opened a leather bound binder sitting prominently amidst the clutter of books and other nick-knacks and got straight to business with a professionalism that Tony had grown to admire in the short amount of time they’d been acquainted.
He’d wonder how the boy had known how he liked to drink it, but that was Ian. Quiet and observant and so quick to take care of others.  Tony took a few hearty bites of a sandwich and swallowed before offering him a smile.
The children giggled but did what they were told happily enough, even if Péter did depart with a roll of his eyes and a cheeky reply.
Sometimes, even though Bucky had not been there to see it, he still dreamed of laying his mother down in her grave, her face peaceful finally in death, the silver gleam of her bridal coins twinkling out from beneath the dirt they shoveled over her.
Tony lay there in the dirt, retching and heaving like a pregnant woman. He was splattered in blood and brains, but he wasn’t injured Bucky judged with a critical glance before turning back to the others.
"You're actually going to let me in. I thought this place was off limits?" Tony commented as they reached the door and Farkas pinned him with his good eyes. "Not off limits, just did my best to keep it Stark free. A man needs to find his sanctuary somewhere."
His thoughts scatted like kicked marbles as Tony cradled his face once more and pressed in close so that they were slotted together, breathing in each other’s air. He felt Tony shiver despite the hot heat seeping in from where his chest, arms and groin pressed against Steve. Maybe it was the other way around. Maybe he was the one shivering and maybe it was his heat Tony was soaking up. Or maybe it was both, the chill deep in both their bones driving them close and closer together to share one continuous cycle of brightly burning heat. It was just proof wasn’t it? They were stronger together than apart.
Bucky immediately released her wrists, his hands coming up to rub her back and cradle her neck, and Natacha blinked away a fresh surge of hot tears. He cared about her too much, that insidious voice inside whispered, practical as it pleased. If she wanted to, she could easily be free of him now. He'd armed her with a knife but he still held her close to his heart as if he hadn't. Maybe that’s why she didn’t want him to let go of her.
still clinging to his fingertips; and easy, like drifting into a dream, he was in the parlor at their villa, the leathery palms of Jacob Yinsen’s hands cupping his as they guided to the correct keys, his mother humming quietly as she worked, the words occasionally bursting past her lips in her beautiful soprano. Tony sang them now from memory, eyes drifting slowly shut as he tried to cling to the memory of her voice, the smell of her perfume, the vibrations in her chest when she sang lullabies in the dark.
"Were you aware Captain that he kept them locked in an attic like a pair of dogs, with no respite from the summer heat?" the monk asked coldly, eyes cutting into Steve. Maria gasped again and Steve wanted to flinch. He held fast, not let his eyes fall from Stark.
“Some women just have no taste.” Pike cackled from the corner and Bucky gave him the finger as Parodi laughed.
Stefen jerked violently with a deep groan, but Bucky was there, holding him down, and for the second time now Tony found himself glad.
“Why didn’t you eat this morning?” she returned with a bossy arch of one brow, and it was the miracle of them (his children) that even with his head cracked and his heart bleeding openly in his chest, she made him smile.
“It’s alright,” Steve assured the trembling man in Polish, and the trembling fellow’s eyes snapped away from Captain Altera and back to Steve. “You’re sure it was this man you saw, walking away from the pub?”
going to crash! He gulped a deep breath and kicked off with one leg, sending the sled down the slope.
Stefen’s mouth surged against his, wicked tongue plying low moans out of Tony’s mouth with insistence as he urged his knees apart with a firm hand and settled himself between Tony’s legs, pressing them chest to chest until Tony could feel the hard press of Stefen’s cock again, rubbing against where he was so desperate for friction.
“Ah, yes, I thought that might surprise you. Yes, you’re to leave in forty-six hours precisely and report to Brigade Leader Kessmeyer -”
Right up until the first war, Hill House had been a gem in the crown of high society; but since the Stark’s deaths and the dissolution of the Austrian state in Pola, the villa had fallen into neglect.
“Vienna.” Bucky turned to look at him, waiting. After a moment Steve looked up, brow furrowed in confusion. It was a second or two more before he seemed to catch on to Bucky’s meaning and his mouth tightened.
“What?” he groused through tight lips as they moved to the steps, Jan’s skirts swirling about his legs as she turned.
Cameron turned and quickly scurried down the stairs, Tony following him. It was clear that Hammer had been hard at work, polishing every surface until it shown and filling the hall with those damn red banners.
“Can we compromise? Pack them so that if we do anything fun you’ll have the option to join in instead of having to sit on the sidelines worried about getting dirty?” Natacha crossed her arms stubbornly over her chest and made to open her mouth but Tony beat her to the punch. “And the first opportunity we get we’ll go shopping for something a little less resembling drapery.”
Globocnik, true to form, had launched into a passionate tirade against political Catholicism and a plea for the necessary subjugation of the church.
“You mean the rich and ridiculous?” Tony drawled, shifting once more so that he could brace his elbows against the couch and look down at Stefen who was chuckling at him.
Even though he disliked the Osbornes, Steve had warmed to the idea of inviting their neighbors and the families of the staff to celebrate Péter’s fifteenth birthday. Charlotte had taken the bull by the horns and sold him on the necessity of inviting Péter’s former HJ troop, as well as the Mayor and a few other important city officials. It meant that the staff could not join the party the way they would have when Péter was little. Stevie was sore about that but there wasn’t anything either of them could do.
"What? Angry that you presumed I would be willing to be responsible for the lives of seven children not my own, while you are gone for- what a year, two, three or four?" Tony growled and Stefen's nostrils flared, his brows arching minutely in a barely there and gone again expression of surprise and hurt, that Tony could only read because he was a damned fool.
“The children,” Tony prompted, jerking his head in the direction of the table. The eyes of Stefen and his crowd of hangers on followed him and one of the women, her cheeks bright with too much drink, made a cooing sound.
Gritting his teeth, Steve got up and stumbled toward the toilet stepping over the sleeping forms of his comrades. The water closet was barely big enough to fit him. Ducking his head through the narrow door he was already bumping elbows with the wall. The tight space didn’t stop him from nearly ripping open his trousers and taking himself in hand.
A few feet away Rogue turned from her own work and shared smile with him in the dark, her eyes bright with a familiar inner flame in the lamplight.
It was a moment before Tony's brain could remember anything besides the heat of Stefen’s mouth. Twisting on the bed to get closer, pressing up against his chest, it was everything he could do to remember not to put too much weight on him as he savored Stefen’s. It still terrified him how close he'd come to loosing this. Losing
He couldn't even blame the bruise. The skin under his eye was no longer as tender as it had once been and the bruising had faded to a pale yellow he could easily cover in the morning with powders. He hadn't even thought about the makeup washing off during their swim.
Tony was nearly dragged up the stairs and manhandled into the hallway and perhaps under different circumstances he might have enjoyed it but Stefen was developing a tendency to lug him around like Sara did her dolls and he was most certainly not a plaything.
“How did the Abbot take it?” Tony questioned, imagining that Stanislov had likely been a kitten in comparison. But Pavlok laughed and shook his head.
“What do you mean?” Steve asked, frowning. Tony really believed Péter was in danger. Which he was of course, but there was something more to it that Steve couldn’t put his finger on. “Tony is there something I should know?”
Ian’s eyes skirted over the room until they stopped suddenly, stuck on a familiar shape hanging by his dresser. He sat up, careful not to wake Artur.
It was time then. Tony gave him a wink and surreptitiously slipped through the press of bodies, over to where he’d left the captain’s mandolin, still wrapped up in the same sheet he’d found it under in the attic.
“Ona, you know we’re supposed to report the homeless.” she reminded her, though it didn't really matter. Ona knew that without fail, if they had something to spare either Magda or her mother would always hand it out and send the poor souls on. Even with the administration so strictly against them, word tended to spread amongst the locals where those who were down on their luck could find a sympathetic hand.
Themen was just as Steve remembered it, the green paint on the door was still peeling and the silver bell still tinkled just the same way as they entered – so much so that a chill passed down Steve’s spine and for a moment the woman standing in front of the counter talking to Susann could only have been his Margrit, in one of those fashionable suites she liked (that her mother called mannish) and any minute now she was going to turn around in her bright red hat, and her precisely painted lips were going to spread into an exasperated smile because –
“What are you doing?” Natacha asked, her voice low as not to wake her younger siblings who had fallen into an exhausted sleep sandwiched between her and Péter.
“And when there’s not? What happens when people inevitably realize their savior is a myth?” Tony challenged.
Cameron nodded weakly, wet eyes latching on the captain though he refused to let go of his brother. "What about mama and papa? What’s going to happen to them?"
When Tony stayed quiet Stefen searched his eyes, but for once Tony had nothing to say. His only defense was the stillness of a mouse as the cat’s stare searched the shadows. It was new and uncomfortable and he could say without doubt that he did not particularly enjoy feeling mouse like. He tensed to pull away when Stefen spoke again.
“Come on now, easy does it,” Bucky murmured as Tony extracted the needle and swabbed at the beading blood. Bucky’s face was on the peaky side as he eased up his hold on Stefen.
"Won't Frauline Werner expect to be invited for super, being an old friend of the family? Herr Hammer seems to believe that is the case." Tony reminded him, because there was always a catch (always a boot to drop) when it came to Tony’s personal happiness.
"Which mean's what exactly?" Steve asked once he heard Bucky clomping up the stairs. He wanted to see if it would work almost as badly as Tony seemed to want to show him. Anybody could get their hands on one of the cheap People's Receivers that were manufactured around the country but a military grade radio with a transmitter was not so easily come by.
“I have a condition Harry! You don’t think I’d like to go to school, to join you and the other boys?” Péter swallowed thickly. It wasn’t that he was jealous of Harry, even though every time they met Harry looked older and wiser and brought more stories. It seemed to Péter that Harry had grown up and he hadn’t. Perhaps it was just that. Harry had left childhood behind for something he felt was worthwhile and he had left Péter behind. It was not a feeling he enjoyed and he did not know why his father insisted on it being that way.
More designs, this time concentrated on ships and naval weaponry. Long pages of notes on the construction of a battleship to be outfitted with some new type of torpedo that was giving them problems… Steve faltered. Wait a minute, these were notes, an engineer’s notes concerning ongoing work outfitting the German Navy!
That could be cured no doubt about it by an introduction a fine lady, any fine lady, and several glasses of the houses finest. He’d been sure of it, but the urge to talk to any one of the numerous beautiful things crowding Stefen’s home that night had faded with every drink. These painted birds would kiss you with their lips and then gouge you with their talons if given half the chance. Too risky, just to lose himself in a warm body. Alcohol was straightforward, uncomplicated. Bottoms up. Bucky was damn determined to not feel another thing that night.
He didn't know what she’d done with his prison trousers, but she’d wiped him up at some point and done away with his soled garments. Now that he was more lucid, she was more wary, and Steve more determined to do for himself. He could roll over now and piss in the straw instead of soiling himself. Without a word and cheeks burning with shame, whenever she came to replace the soiled straw with fresh, she’d set the water bucket down beside him with a rag and he’d wash himself as best he could.
It was harder after that to keep up the pretense. Steve wanted nothing more than to fly home and see for himself that things were truly well with the children. There was a small terribly cowardly man in him who wanted to go home, pack all their bags and simply slip away into the night, abandoning everything and everyone else to whatever fate would meet them, so long as his children were not harmed.
“Virginia!” Hammer called anxiously, eyes darting every which way as if he expected to find Pepper hiding somewhere. “Virginia come quick!”
He and Bruce got into line with those lucky enough to not be born Jewish and Tony tried not to think about what a fraud he was. Tried to think only of getting home to Stefen and the children and to be grateful that he could.
"Trust me darling, everything will be fine." he said, louder this time in German. "Now please, come out of there before the good lieutenant here sounds the alarm."
“Herr Stark,” Stefen began as soon as the room was silent again. His voice was dangerously controlled. “I have granted you many liberties because I am fond of you. But you are never to speak to me that way again. Have I made myself clear?”
“YOU GUYS ARE SO IN LOVE, IT’S DISGUSTING!” Ransom yelled from the corridor, and Tony heard a loud crashing sound.
“Nah, I think Stevie here is forgetting who he is, honey. Why don’t you let me remind him?” Ransom said, taking a step. He wasn’t taking this seriously. He still thinks I’m that weak kid on the playground, Steve thought, clenching his jaw. He doesn’t see a soldier that hurt people. That killed people. “I’m gonna remind him real quick, don’t you worry. Come on Stevie, you aren’t scared, are you?”
The building’s big and scary, but he prefers to call it ugly. Captain America should not be scared from a building; he shouldn’t be scared of anything. The team has a silent agreement that he’s the boss, apparently, so Steve sticks to the status quo and tries to lead them. It’s not easy with Natasha threatening to stab someone every seven minutes and Tony not coming out of the garage
What difference would it make? Tony was dating his twin now. His damn twin. That meant it was about the personality, which was a hundred times worse. He had asked his friends for counsel but all he got was “you waited too long, idiot.” Natasha hadn’t even bothered with an answer, she had just snorted and left.
Tony didn’t listened to a word the pastor said. He looked at Steve, and Steve looked at him. His voice was distant to him, but also the “I do.” Was the most right thing he has ever said in his life.
His baby blue suit had a burgundy tie, his favorite color mixing with Steve’s. The garden was decorated with forget-me-nots and red roses along baby’s breaths. Tony’s mother always said that flowers meant more than words, and kept a bouquet of purple myrtles and lavenders at the grand salon at all times. When she fought Howard, she filled the house with peonies, representing the anger deep in her soul. Or Tansies, if she was furious. Of course, Howard never understood any of those meanings, but his mom did. That’s what mattered. Tony looked at  the little honeysuckles that hanged from the walls of the mansion. That was their new home, the home he’ll live with Steve. His real home.
That seemed to humor his twin. For whatever reason, every time Steve was with Tony, it seemed so damn fun to Ransom. He always called Tony ‘steve’s little boyfriend’, and it just didn’t make sense to Steve that he suddenly wanted to bang him. Now that he thought of Ransom, it did. Ransom would do anything to rile him, including hurting Tony.
“I WAS GOING TO BEAT TONY!” Clint cries, stopping the knife with his hand and dodging the other knife with the other. “I WAS SO CLOSE, NAT!”
“You didn’t have to do this,” Tony says, staring at the piping hot coffee Steve made him. The coffee looks delicious, but Tony doesn’t like to hold things, so he gestures at the table. Steve idly puts it there, and holds Tony’s forearm.
“No medical.” Tony says quickly, maybe a bit too quickly because Steve looks at him with worried eyes. “Too many questions, not enough sleep, they’ll alert Rhodey, really don’t need that. Look, you tended to it pretty good, it’s good as new!” He tries to move his arm, but now without his usual amount of caffeine, he can feels the hot pain coursing through his pains. He yelpes, and Steve shakes his head, holding the arm again.
The feeling on his chest whenever he saw Tony was far from good, he knew, but he just couldn’t stop himself. He tried to look away, but wherever he turned to, he found a piece of Tony that just made him queasy with admiration.
“Hey, Cap,” Tony calls behind him, after couple of minutes. It took Steve a while to get his breathing in order again, but his efforts are completely destroyed when Tony sneaks up on him. The man didn’t exactly sneak up, Steve thinks, he was just out of it.
“Tony, god, this is… And you haven’t felt that?” The fact is, Tony runs too high on caffeine to actually feel things, and he was elbow-deep in this new prototype, so he wouldn’t have probably notice it if his pants caught fire. Not that it hadn’t happened. “We’re gonna have to go the medical for this…”
“Ransom-“ Tony said, intrigued. Of course he doesn’t want Ransom telling their sexacapades, Steve thought, his eyes fixed on his drink. He doesn’t want me to hear it because I’ve just been this friend to him, not someone who can know about his dick. Not someone who can make him feel good, make him moan, squirm, make him fall apart in my hands. I can fuck him so much better than Ransom, and he knows it.
5 seconds later, he realized that wasn’t helping his fiancée at all, so he stopped messing with his tie and started messing with Steve’s. “Relax. This is going to be magical. I am 98% sure that Ransom is not going to kill anyone and if he tries to, Bucky would be more than happy to help us. Aunt Tilda is going to snooze off 8 minutes after the ceremony starts, and Natasha promised she won’t spill blood anywhere. I have to get her a Louis bag.” He kneaded Steve’s arms softly, and kissed him on the cheek. “I love you.”
“You know that’s not what I want.” Steve answered, his voice low. They waited. For some reason, New York was as quiet as it could be.
“THE GROOM AND THE GROOM!” He yelled, clearly drunk as...his usual self. “I PRONOUNCE YOU AS GROOM AND GROOM!” His black suit...BLACK SUIT?!
Press smile is different. It’s designed to look in control, designed to look confident. It’s nothing like the real Tony, and Steve hates is every time he sees it.
“Oh, for fuck’s sake,” is not the answer he would’ve expected. “I just lost to honeybear by three days. Three goddamn days.”
Steve’s “I do.” Was loud and clear and in love, and when they kissed, their souls melt into each other. Tony loved this man.
“I’d prefer it to end.” Steve said, taking another sip from the expensive champagne. He needed something stronger, if he wanted to end the night with all Ransom’s teeth in their place. “Do you think they give out whiskeys in here?”
Steve thinks he should keep the sweater, because it looks better on Tony than it’ll ever do on Steve.
“So, birdbrain,” Ransom said, one hand on Tony’s shoulder and one hand wrapped around his glass of whiskey. “So who’s topping between you and Discount Jesus? I bet it’s you.”
“Ransom, why the hell you’re not wearing the navy suit?  I had it in your dressing room!” Tony exclaimed and Steve let his head fall onto his knees.
Of course, Bucky, Sam and Nat wasn’t exactly glad he came. But hey, as long as fists weren’t talking, it was fine to Steve.
The doors open with a whim, and they make their way to the grand penthouse of Tony’s, the whole Manhattan beneath them, shining, glinting, shimmering. They never take their hands off each other, only stopping to let Tony breath (Steve has never thought that the enhanced lungs could work in
makes everything so much more complicated. He focuses on the movie, and looks at the fish doing…something.
Steve’s first blow landed on Ransom’s nose, and Steve was sure even the bartender heard the cracking sound. Then, he landed another on his left cheek, grabbed his arm and turned Ransom around. He kicked him from behind, causing him to fall flat on his face. Ransom cried with pain, and attempted to get up. Steve let him. He wanted to have more fun.
“Not much. New widow-bite, some arrows, maybe the birdhouse Thor had wanted. He’s still stuck on the color,” Tony says, taking a bite out of the stale Chinese takeout. Steve notices a red spot forming around the packaging.
Tony doesn’t have a dreams often, and when he does, they’re nightmares. Not this night, though. This night, Tony sees The Captain, holding Tony, and he almost feels the heartbeat of the man. The skin is warm and hot and familiar, and Tony melts to it. The name rolls on Steve’s tongue;
“Didn't need it” he grunted, at least he’d thought he hadn't needed it. He'd taken twice the amount recommended, only stopping when Virginia stumbled upon him.
Ian in contrast, seemed to have found his third arm. Unlike Péter and James he’d inherited his father's fabled ability with a rifle.
Bucky’s eyes flicked down to his sketchbook expecting to see drafts of the AVENGERS cartoon he’d described to Bucky when he’d laid out his crazy plan; instead he was met with the beginnings of a portrait. A portrait of a dark haired man wielding hammer and wrench illuminated by a rising sun.
“Whatever he promised you, we’ll pay double if you can get us to the station in half the time.” he offered, and that was the end of the fellows wavering.
When he looked up Steve was watching him with a stillness that made every nerve in Bucky’s body go quiet. He stopped twitching and nearly stopped breathing altogether as Steve gave him a small smile and murmured lowly in Romany, "It doesn’t get any easier the more you say it Buck. Trust me, I tried."
Tony read over the document, mildly surprised that his father had parted with so much money just to get someone to take Tony off his hands.
“Captain. So wonderful to see you.” General Schmidt stood just behind the girl, his arms crossed behind his back and posture ramrod straight as he smiled down at the child in a somewhat cold fashion. He seemed to suck the warmth out of the room just by standing there. “Ah and you brought your children. And what a fine recovery they have made. Perhaps our many prayers for them have been answered?”
“His father was a convert.” Stefen supplied in that same very quiet way. It was too damn calm, when all of Tony’s nerves were rattling like there was gunfire going off in the next room. “Under the Nuremberg Laws Joshua could still be considered Jewish.”
He was hand in hand with mama, walking through the groves. The branches so thick overhead and so full of blossoms that he could only see patches of the blue sky. White petals drifting all around them and catching in his hair.
“You are the third of a... disappointing line of tutors. I don’t wish to displace you.” The unfinished ‘but I will’ hung in the air. The fingered whistle went to the captain's lips.
They were all here, but they were damp and their lips blue tinged so Tony’s second task was to get a fire going as soon as possible within the fireplace. Thankfully there was a dry stack of wood left over from whoever had last visited, and it wasn’t long before he and Bucky managed to get a flame going.
They peeled away from the camp with a kick of dirt beneath the truck’s wheels. Bucky racing down the unpathed road like a bat out of hell.
Something indecipherable had passed over her face but she’d nodded after a moment. The unspoken plea ‘don’t let them come here’ drifting between them.
"No." Steve cut in, he would not concede this point "You're my son and I'd die before I let someone hurt you the way I was hurt. If lying kept you safe, then I don't regret it."
“Do you really think it’s wise, getting her hopes up like this?” Péter, who was sitting in front of the coffee table with a weathered book open in front of him as he scribbled in a journal, looked up to say.
It wasn’t going to happen, he thought adamantly, even as he remembered all the ways in which the Reich was pushing the men to have more children. It didn’t matter. They couldn’t force him and Charlotte to, to
“And we've other songs, don't we?” Stark added helpfully. “Songs about flowers and dances and the seasons and... well you remember them.”
Tony opened one eye, frowning when he spotted Maria standing over him, her little red ball in hand. Artur was waiting impatiently behind her, waiting for her to throw the ball back.
“And how old are you James?” Tony asked, emphasizing the child’s real name and grinning at the boy’s disappointed scowl. Maria chose that moment to step forward, out of succession, and despite her brother’s dark glower in her direction the dark haired little girl smiled sweetly up at him and said, “I’m Maria and I’m five. That’s James and he’s eight. You’re smart and very pretty.”
. He couldn’t breathe. He was unhinged with it, circling a dark drain down into something that felt like madness.
“But it’s Christmas.” Sara insisted suddenly as if the idea had just struck her. “You can’t be sick on Christmas.”
There were footsteps approaching outside the door, and he'd been expecting it he realized when he heard a quiet knock on the outside and Stefen's voice coming through the door.
He saw more than a few curious glances and expressions of surprised recognition as he made his way toward the Abbots office.  Nobody had expected him to return here, Tony thought with distant humor. He couldn't blame them for that assumption.
He was here wasn’t he? Bobbing about in rowboat across the lake to go camping, of all things, when by rights there were a million other things he should be doing to keep them all safe.
Bucky had been perched by his window sill, his violin cocked at his throat as he played a familiar tune. A folk song, not unlike the sort the Uncles used to play. This one was about a tiny flower.
