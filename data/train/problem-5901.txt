They settle down again, facing the floor-to-ceiling bedroom windows on the left side of Tony’s bedroom to look out and watch the sunrise as they lay wrapped up in each other. Steve wraps himself tighter around Tony as the smaller man begins to drift off slowly, eyes closing slowly before they flutter back open in a daze.
that he did this! He used Happy as bait to try to kill me, like he’s been trying to do for years! I’ve exhausted every other possibility and this is the only one that works, for Christ’s sake!”
- are we if we don’t even try? God knows that Tony has tried to help all of us enough times. Clint, you remember when Tony heard that you couldn’t sleep because every time you would close your eyes you felt as if you were back under Loki’s control? What did Tony do?”
“Sure.” Happy looks pleased and Tony pats him gently on the shoulder. Pepper enters the living room holding two plates with a slice of pie and a side of cream each, hands them out with a smile, and waits for their verdict. Tony takes a bite and moans happily.
Natasha snorts before she can help it, and Tony tilts his head to see her shoulders shaking slightly with mirth. She holds her hand up for a high five and Tony slaps their hands together, allowing her fingers to curl around his own and give his hand a gentle squeeze before she releases it and her hand falls to the floor with a soft thud.
Bucky is clutching his metal arm, Tony notes, and he looks as pale as a ghost. A thin sheen of sweat is covering the ex-assassin’s face and he winces when he tries to move his shoulder to nudge the arm towards Bruce.
In the next second Bucky’s hands are gone and Tony falls to the floor, gasping and coughing. He resists the hand held out to him by Bruce and stands up himself on shaky legs, once again scratching at his arms hard enough that his nails begin to leave marks. Steve recalls Tony mentioning something about scratching himself until he bleeds and he swallows thickly.
technique, Clint shooting arrows that Wanda attempts to explode with her powers, etc). Tony can only hope that they move to the training room to test out new techniques because, even though the gym may be built to handle everything the Avengers throw at it, the gym was built for fitness purposes and
Bucky holds eye contact with him and begins to feel uncertain the longer they stare at each other. He was never wrong about this sort of thing, but there’s a first time for everything, right? After all, Steve wouldn’t lie to him. He promised that he wouldn’t. Eventually, the ex-assassin sighs and ducks his head in shame.
“That’s enough,” interrupts Steve, voice cold and glare even colder. A single look from him is all it takes to quell the argument before it has even started. “You don’t fight my battles for me, Buck. I get you’re trying to help, but if that’s how you go about it then you shouldn’t even bother.”
Steve rolls his eyes in fond exasperation and turns around to face his boyfriend, who looks upset at being moved until he resettles his chin against Steve’s sternum and smiles up at him. Their hands remain linked and Steve rubs the pad of his thumb over Tony’s knuckles lightly. He’s content to just stand there and stare down into Tony’s eyes forever. Tony is, Steve realises belatedly, wearing his rather large grey Led Zeppelin t-shirt and his black boxer shorts and looks so good that Steve has trouble remembering how to breathe. Even after months of dating, he’s still not quite sure how he managed to get so lucky with the engineer.
Those words are like a blow to the chest. Steve always knew that things between he and Tony would never be the same again and that it would take a lot of time and effort to rekindle their past romance after the war, but he never expected
“That is a question for yourself, boss, since it was you and you alone that programmed me,” responds FRIDAY in a dry tone.
“A simple one,” Barnes responds, shrugging. He stares at Tony shamelessly, situated on the couch opposite with a glass of water in his hand. Tony huffs and slams his own glass down onto the coffee table with more force than necessary.
I have also created a playlist on Spotify based on this fic and it's under the same name as the title if anyone would like to go and give it a listen. Song recommendations are always welcome.
. Tony spends the remainder of his short walk to his car wondering if he should visit Pepper and Happy’s apartment or postpone his visit, until he remembers he has to relieve Steve of his bodyguard duties. They won’t mind if Tony sleeps on their couch as long as he doesn’t throw up again. Happy would vomit just from hearing Tony throw up and probably end up tearing his stitches, and Pepper would definitely not be happy then. If her text messages are anything to go by, she’s displeased enough as it is having Steve in their apartment watching over them like an eager-to-please puppy.
? It wasn’t like things could get any worse between them, and he figured they needed to sort out some of their bigger differences. Tony’s anxiety is eased with the knowledge that, should Barnes try anything, FRIDAY will not hesitate to call in reinforcements. Tony hopes it won’t come to that, but former Hydra assassins are not known for being predictable.
Clint, Sam, and Scott visit him the next morning before Tony is released from the hospital. They express their regrets on how things turned out and apologise profusely, and Tony does the same. He signs his apology to Clint, even though he's wearing his hearing aid, because it feels more sincere. Clint appreciates it immensely. Tony can’t help but be wary of them, though, and he flinches away when the archer goes to hug him before leaving. The look of remorse on Clint’s face when he drops his arms and says, “See you later, Tony,” leaves him feeling far too emotional for his own good.
“There were quite a few close calls, sir, but it appears that the Exremis serum has successfully rootted itself in your body. The arc reactor proved its most challenging competitor and it almost caused multiple seizures, but I can no longer detect any issues with your current health. As a matter of fact, your health is better than it has been for quite a while, sir.”
Natasha and Bruce share a look. Tony’s brows furrow together as he watches them exchange some sort of silent conversation until Bruce turns to look back at the camera. “Steve hasn’t been dealing with your departure well.”
“Oh, I, uh-” Steve stutters, looking directly at Tony. He seems at a loss for words. “I didn’t know you were out of hospital.”
Tony and Nat share a look and then run towards the already open doors of the elevator. The doors close not even a second after they step foot inside, and then they are travelling upwards.
“In case it has somehow escaped your attention, Tasha, none of the people you surround yourself with are normal,” says Tony around a chuckle. Natasha feigns shock, clutching at her chest and gasping with wide eyes. “I know, I know! I mean, I heard one of them is a Norse God – crazy, right? And there’s another that can turn into a huge green guy, and a dude that flies around on wings, and a girl that fires energy balls and messes with people’s heads! How insane is that?!”
Tony chuckles coldly and takes another drink from the bottle currently falling victim to his iron-tight grip on its neck. “It has everything to do with this! You are a liar, and a coward, and the only reason that I’m still alive is because T’Challa showed up right in the nick of time to stop your friend over there from beating me to death.” Barnes’ hands clench into fists beside Steve but Tony ignores him, too caught up in his rant to stop. “And the funny thing is that I wish he hadn’t shown up, and that Barnes had killed me, because it would have been better than having to live in the same world as someone like you.”
Bruce shakes his head with a sad smile. “No, he hasn’t been hiding it. It was actually quite obvious, but we have all been too busy to notice that there was something more than just heartbreak getting him down. We should have seen it sooner.”
Tony blinks at him in surprise and then shrugs self-deprecatingly. “It’s nothing; I would have done it for anyone.”
“I know,” he responds, still sounding like a petulant child despite his bed efforts. “But I need to speak with Nat about something.” He turns to look at her, lower lip caught between his teeth. “It’ll be quick, I promise.”
“Welcome back, boss,” comes FRIDAY’s voice. Tony releases a soft laugh and watches as lines of code and data appear before his eyes before they vanish and the suit is ready for use.
“No, no, not if it’ll make Pep angry. I can’t handle her angry calling me again, especially if I’ll be stuck in board meetings all day.”
“FRIDAY,” he gasps. “Initiate system lockdown; no one gets in here until I say otherwise, understand?”
Natasha pauses in her actions and turns around completely. “Why?” she asks, suspicion leaking through her words.
After minutes of heaving and trying to calm his shaking hands, Tony sits back down in his swivel stool and returns to his research. He’s not even sure what to search for anymore, but he will continue to try everything under the sun and just hope for some answers. He needs Pepper and Happy to be safe. Aside from Rhodey, they’re the closest thing to family that he’s got. He doesn’t realise that he is biting his lip until he feels something trickle down his chin and he wipes it away with a frown. Upon examination, he discovers that the substance was blood and sucks his lower lip into his mouth in an attempt to stem the slight bleeding.
Steve isn’t stupid. He can tell when he isn’t wanted. He sucks his plush lower lip into his mouth and worries it between his teeth and then nods. He glances back at Tony, leaning against the wall and trying not to fidget, and then follows Pepper obediently. They pass by the couch where Happy is sprawled out half-asleep across it and Pepper unlocks the door and opens it for him. Steve pointedly stares straight ahead of himself as he exits the apartment. Tony doesn’t come running after him, nor does he kiss him right there in the corridor like he used to, and Steve vows not to let his imagination run wild again as disappointment courses through him.
Two blocks later, Tony found himself standing in front of a 7-Eleven and smiling. Certainly, they'd have booze in there. Pushing the door open, he felt like he entered the Taj Mahal. In the back, he spotted a sign labeled beverages and started sprinting for it. In his rush to get there, he fell twice. Both times he was seemingly unaffected and got back on his feet quickly.
"Go ahead," he said. "Say what you're going to say." Salinas' face turned red faster than a stoplight.
"Well, maybe I learned from that." Tony shot him a look that said "really?" "Maybe you should, too." Tony rolled his eyes.
"Is there anything you need me to do other than sit here and wear this?" Conroy waved the finger had the sensor attached to it.
The hospital they ended up taking her to was Metro General. It was apparently the closest ER/trauma center. She had to remain strapped to the stretcher as she was wheeled inside and as they triaged her. She figured she probably should lie, but honestly any lie she gave they would probably figure out, so she told the truth. Her name was Carol Susan Jane Danvers. She was born on October 1st, 1959. She had no idea what her social security number was, and she didn't have insurance. No, she wasn't pregnant. Yes, she was sure. She was over fifty, she'd had a hysterectomy, she hadn't had sex in more than a year, and the last person she had sex with was a woman, so she could be certain. It was all incredibly irritating – especially since it didn't look like the nurse taking her information believed her. Despite that, the woman still punched in all the information Carol had given her. Whether it was because she didn't want to put up the fight or because she thought Carol was delirious from her trauma, she wasn't sure but whatever the case, they ended up moving on to the next stage of process – removing Carol's clothes.
"Because I'm not worth caring about." Tony's response stunned Steve into silence. "I mean, look at what I've done. I've put you through hell in the last twenty-four hours. I got shit-faced drunk, and anytime anyone tried to say anything about it, I got nasty and ran away. I mean, I don't think I have a problem, but I do know that's not okay. You shouldn't be around me. No one should. I'm surprised you didn't break up with me the moment you saw me…"
Obviously, she could remember meeting Tony. Again, that fell into the most recent three week period of solid memories. The rest of it, however, she was kind of fuzzy on. Her earliest childhood memories were completely gone. She only remembered the bare facts about her life before the Kree. (Who her parents were, her brothers' names, the town she grew up in, where she went to high school, when she joined the Air Force, etc., etc.) Even after the Kree, there was something off about some of her memories. Some of them seemed too faded; distant, while others felt all too real. To put it bluntly she had big gaps in her memory that she couldn't explain and the memories she did have she wasn't sure if she could trust. That really quite complicated things, especially when she had strangers pressing her for answers.
"I think I'm whole enough. Goodbye." She left the room, not listening to Carl's protests and demands for her to stay. She rolled her eyes. He had to know it was completely useless.
Remember kids, if you don't leave a review, I'm gonna tie you to the bed and set this house on fire!
"I still don't know what to tell you," she said. "It's an inevitable thing that's going to have to happen as we proceed with the lawsuit."
"I don't know about the soup," Natasha said. "But he'll want the sandwiches. I'll bring some to him when they're done."
He answered every one of the doctor's questions clearly and cooperatively, leading him to reveal that he'd been frequently been suffering from bouts of fatigue, shortness of breath, and dizziness. It also made him notice things he hadn't realized before, such as how much easier he cut and bruised. It wasn't until she asked her last question that Tony felt the rug get pulled out from underneath him.
When the driver brought the car to a stop in the driveway, Salinas immediately got out and offered Tony a hand. Tony tried to reject it, but the man was insistent. Begrudgingly, Tony let Salinas help him out of the car and lead him into the house through the side door.
Clint got up and sprinted to his partner, Natasha Romanoff. She was on her knees, digging through the pile of ash, looking for something. Clint bent down, grabbed her by the shoulder, and turned her to face him. The look of horror on her face was one he had only seen once before, and it terrified him to see it again.
Except nothing was normal. None of it was normal. What he saw and what he experienced was beyond the realm of comprehension. It wasn't real, yet it was all too real at the same time. He couldn't get it out of his mind; out of his thoughts; out of his being. This was part of who Tony was now and honestly, he didn't think he could accept it. The thought of being like this forever twisted his stomach so much that he thought he was going to vomit.
Not having a good enough argument for that, Clint relented and let Natasha take on his weight. She helped him down the hall, into the elevator, and all the way back to the bedroom. Nat pulled back the sheets and helped Clint into bed. He laid back as he tried to catch his breath. Concerned, she pressed the back of her hand against his forehead, trying to gauge his temperature. He did not feel hot, but that did not do anything to reassure her.
"A dollar and a quarter?" Clint repeated. "Wow, the tooth fairy must have been feeling pretty generous." Laura nodded.
"Hey," he said. "Are you okay?" Slowly, Tony looked up at Steve and was relieved to see nothing but concern and affection in his eyes.
"Yeah," Tony said. "I met him last year and I've spent time with him since. Doesn't always live up to the legend…"
Carol had a frown plastered on her face the entire ride to the hospital. Despite her insistence to the EMTs that she was fine and that they should be focusing their resources on the people who were actually hurt, they refused to listen to her and essentially forced her onto a stretcher. Well, "force" was a bit of a strong word. It was more like she had no other choice. If she fought back, she'd hurt them, so her only option was to suck it up and go along with what they said. However, that didn't mean she couldn't be angry about it.
"Well, he kind of did." Freeman shot Barton a look. "Stark was drunk yesterday. You know he was, right?"
"Of course, you wouldn't." Lara didn't do much to keep that comment under her breath, causing Bruce to raise his eyebrows.
"Yes, sir." Agent Romanoff did as she was told. She gave the Director a quick rundown of how things went retrieving Captain Rogers from Stark's custody before parting ways and going back where she belonged. From there, Hill and Fury continued to Fury's office.
"Holy shit!" Nina made quick work of the lock and had the door open within seconds. She threw her arms around Oswin's neck and pressed kisses to the side of her face. Oswin laughed at first, but her smile was quickly wiped away by Nina's sobs.
"All of our current research projects are accounted for, but…" Griffith hesitated and swallowed. Pepper didn't release her gaze from him until he came out with it. "A great deal of pure chemical elements was taken from our storage locker."
"I, uh," came slipping out of his mouth. "Yes…? No? I don't know." Slowly, Steve's hand started pulling him backwards.
"What's happening?" she pleads. "What'd you do to me? Why are you doing this to me? Please, make it stop!" A smirk appeared on Knežević's face as he gave his answer.
"I'm just saying we live in strange times." Duran shrugged. "It's best to keep an open mind." Bergeron scoffed at that. "Hey, it's up to her defense attorney how they're going to swing this. Probably would be best to go with mental health/insanity defense, but I'm sure it's nothing your DA can blow right out of the water."
"Sit down. We have something we need to talk about." Natasha went to the living area and sat down in one of the armchairs. Steve sat on the empty couch and looked around. He made sure to make eye contact with every single person.
"Now you can look." Turning back around, Tony saw the door hanging open, the lock having been blown off. He looked back to Natasha, who was clearly unphased by the angry expression on his face.
"I hope she knows she left her laptop and all of her other crap here," Tony remarked once she was gone.
Lara stopped when she reached a page containing a photocopied image of a handwritten note. Just reading the first few lines, she knew it was the damning letter that had been sent to the Avengers, but that was not why she stopped. No, she stopped because she recognized a symbol drawn on the page near Sharpton's signature. It was that of a triangle, trisected by a ring. Nothing elaborates, but it still caught Lara's attention. Before she could stop herself, she blurted out "I know this symbol."
Tony, meanwhile, gently put his hands on either side of Steve's face. Looking into Tony's eyes, he was surprised by how watery they had become.
"Probably not," Freeman assured. "Miss Everhart is a professional. I doubt she'd take any personal problems she might have with Mr. Stark out on him or any of you for that matter."
"It's just two minutes," Drew said. "Just let me say what I need to say and then I'll go back to bed. I promise."
"No problem," Lara said, brushing a stray hair that had escaped her bun out of her face. "Where's Tony?"
Just as she was rolling into Oswin's neighborhood, a police barricade stopped Nina dead in her tracks. Unsure of what was going on, Nina quickly turned around and parked the car about a block away. When she returned to the site on foot, she spotted a woman coming out of the restricted area. She looked like she was an official, so Nina decided to flag her down and try asking her what was happening.
"Great," he tried to lie, but Pepper gave him that pointed look again. "My head still hurts, but it's not as bad as it was before."
Hill jumped into the passenger's seat, giving the driver the address for New Horizons Labs before spouting orders into her comms unit. Steve, meanwhile, got in the backseat with Natasha. The tension was palpable. Steve knew he had to break the silence before it snapped violently.
The anxiety hadn't ceased spreading. In fact, it had only gotten worse. His only worry was now that he was going to get Tony into trouble. While he may have joked about it on the phone, it was a real possibility that S.H.I.E.L.D. could have Tony thrown from the building the second he asked to take Steve out into the public. It was clear they wanted him to adjust slowly, but personally, Steve didn't want to take things slowly. He wanted his freedom. He wanted to decide for himself what he could handle and couldn't handle. He wanted to see what the world had become in his sixty-five-year absence, and right now Tony was the only one offering that to him. It might be selfish, but he wanted to take that opportunity, even if it ended up getting both him and Tony in trouble. In his mind, it would be a hundred-percent worth it.
That was where his memory started getting spotty. He could remember training; the serum and what it did to him; Captain America; Hydra… It all seemed disjointed, though, like he was missing some pieces – names and faces, dates and places. It all seemed to blur together and mesh into one big event that he could barely even wrap his head around. Moments came by in flashes and Steve tried desperately to cling to them as they passed.
The project was progressing nicely, though they were still months away from attempting to tap into the Tesseract's seemingly unlimited power supply. Dr. Selvig was hopeful, though, and if things kept going at this rate, they'd be moving on to Phase Two by this time next year.
. Steve was afraid of all those things. Albeit, for different reasons than Tony might think, but he was afraid nonetheless and for that Steve felt completely ashamed.
Fun fact! You can actually make fake blood out of KY Jelly! I know because that's what they use on the Walking Dead, particularly when they need to cover an actor in blood and guts so that they're not completely sticky all day.
Tony's private office was nothing compared to his and Bruce's lab downstairs, but it was serviceable. Most of the time he spent in here was taken up by doing paperwork and other annoying stuff for SI. As much as he loved his company, there were a lot of things that came along with being the owner of it that just plain wasn't fun. At least now that he wasn't CEO he didn't have as much to do.
He then took off in the direction of the elevator. He heard Happy call after him, but Tony ignored him. Once inside, he shoved his key for the penthouse into the proper slot and slammed his hand down on the "close doors" button so fast, it left a stinging feeling in his hand for a few moments. Bouncing anxiously on the balls of his feet, Tony awaited the elevator's arrival on the proper floor when JARVIS' voice came over the speakers."
"They're okay, though," Laura said. "We're all okay, so don't you worry about us. You need to focus on fighting this." He heard her sniffle. "Fight this, Clint. For the kids… For me… Please, just fight this!"
"You know, my house is just down the street. Why don't we head back there and get you warmed up?" Tony eyed him skeptically. All those warnings his mother gave him as a child about not getting into cars with strangers flashed through his mind.
"Really?" Steve questioned. "Because if we never have sex and never openly date each other, I don't see how this is much of a relationship." Tony's eyes widened.
"No, you didn't!" Sharpton shouted. "I saw the story on the news! S.H.I.E.L.D. had captured Loki in Germany a full day before the Invasion even happened! For him to have been able to escape in the first place tells me that this could have been preventable; that this was all the Avengers' fault! Now you're all being celebrated like heroes, but you're not! All you people are just monsters in masks!"
what struck the tower." Natasha's face snapped into surprise. Carol gave Tony a slightly annoyed look, but he just shrugged. "There are eyewitnesses and security footage. No point in trying to hide it." Carol let out a relenting sigh.
"A little bit." Tony couldn't tell if Natasha was patronizing him or was being genuine. He found himself hoping for the latter instead of accepting the former. "Maybe it would help if you told us what you usually think before you start drinking."
First thing's first, I'm not going to see Ant-Man and the Wasp until next Thursday. Please don't put spoilers in your review. Second thing's second, this is another chapter where I teeter very close to the M rating. Not for anything sexual, but for... Well, you'll see.
"Everyone can always be better," she said. "You just need to keep trying." Stark was silent as he mulled over her words. Carol, meanwhile, propped her feet back up on the foot of the bed. "So, a story for a story is only fair I suppose. Now, I've heard a lot about this 'Iron Man' guy, but I think it would probably be best to hear the story from the man himself. Don't you agree, Stark?"
Immediately, Charles set to work writing down all his ideas. Ideas turned to tenants. Tenants turned to gospel. Gospel turned to structure. The structure turned to government. The government turned to faith; a faith that Charles himself didn't believe in but knew that thousands of weak-minded Americans would buy into easily.
"I've just been worried, okay," she said. "It's no big deal." Clint's eyebrows raised contrastively.
"It's a patient intake forum," he said. "Not a standardized test." Yeah, Tony could see how ridiculous that question was. Conceding, Tony handed the clipboard over to Rhodey along with the pen he'd been twirling absentmindedly.
"It was an accident," he said. "Someone took my phone, started messing with it, and ended up calling her." Natasha frowned.
"Uh," Bruce suddenly spoke up. "Okay, I'm sorry, but I have to ask, when did all the flirting and the kissing start? Not that I have a problem with it. Good for you guys, but did I miss something?"
"I think it's suspicious that Fury's known that she's been out there all this time and never once called her in; not even for New York." Clint's jaw set in a hard line. "What do you think?" He let out a heavy breath through his nostrils.
Stepping out of the meeting room felt freeing. The air felt fresher in the hallway and most of the pressure left his body. Finally, he had the space to think clearly. At least, that's what the initially thought. Shortly after he stepped outside, he heard the door he just walked through open and close again. Turning around, he saw Happy standing there. Tony sighed.
…Or at least he would have if it wasn't suddenly cut off by an inhuman scream and the sound of something hard and heavy hitting the wall. Tony and Steve instantly pulled back and his panicked eyes instantly connected with Steve's. Without even a second of discussion or hesitation, the two ran off – still holding hands – towards the source.
"Shouldn't they be here by now?" Natasha marked the page she was on and set the book down to rest on her stomach.
"I'll be alright," he said, waving off his boyfriend's concerns. "Really, the best thing we can do at this point is stay out of Cabe's way." Reassured, Steve nodded.
"Alright," Carol agreed. "But seriously, you do need to have faith in yourself to make the right choice. That second step is different for everyone. For me, it was going to AA meetings and trying to get myself into a safe routine, but I think that's probably not the complete right choice for you."
Although they had no problems at the airport, when they arrived at the hotel, they found that there were already a handful of reporters gathered outside, desperate to get the first glimpse at the Avengers in months. Although the front entrance clearly wasn't secure, neither Clint nor Natasha had the cash on them to pay off the cab driver to drop them off out back, so they, unfortunately, had to brave the storm. Getting out of the taxi, the two super-spies sped past the press, covering their faces as best they could and giving "no comment" as their response to any asked questions. That probably wasn't how Stark wanted them to interact with the press, but they considered it better than saying something they shouldn't and having it getting taken out of context later.
In other ways, it was still the same New York he had known all his life. The streets bustled with an endless number of cars, buses, and cabs. People filled the sidewalks, all going about their daily business. That much at least hadn't changed. The sights might have changed, but the smells, the sounds, the atmosphere… The city still had its character and it served as a comfort to Steve. New York was still New York. Time hadn't changed that and probably nothing ever could.
So, there are some real-life public figures that make cameo appearances in this chapter. I don't have their explicit permission to use their image in any way and if they or someone who works with them has a problem with this, please DM me from an official account over Twitter. My handle is MewWinx96 and I will remove any reference to them within this chapter if asked.
"What?" Natasha's voice is alarmed, and Tony watches her open her window, so, the two of them to can be face to face. "You have come this far Tony, now's not the time to quit."
"Me too. Go pick a movie; I'll be right back." It's an excuse to check on the rest of the team as well, and Steve isn't ashamed to admit it if asked. But Tony is already scrolling through Prime, and Steve leaves him to it.
Even on a sprained ankle and what is likely a bullet graze on his side, Steve musters up the strength to lift a sleeping Tony into his arms and carry him down the ramp.
"Oh," Steve says, his expression soft. Probably disappointed like most people. "I’ve heard lots about you, y'know."
Natasha, ever the only one able to reign Clint back in, clamps a hand over his mouth. "What Clint means to say is—I hope you both feel better. See you in the morning!"
"I wish I could share your world view Nat. But, I am not like you, in love with someone like Pepper. So, nothing seems magical to me now." He answers.
Sometimes, Steve is like an old man; he still cannot part with his desktop despite owning a smaller laptop. Tony curiously sees the notification from his e-mail, then after the notice fades, Tony sees Steve’s Spotify account.
"Do you think Steve will advance in this competition? Given the applause he received." Natasha asks as she scrolls on her phone. The trio is outside of the concert hall waiting for Steve to emerge, as the judges finalize their decision.
Steve, being taller than he is, dotingly fixes his red scarf around his neck, making sure that the cold air wouldn’t seep into his clothes.
"Can't have that," Tony jokes, roiling up a piece of provolone and handing it to Steve, "people will start to think I don't take care of you!"
"Mr. Stark." The cold tone with which Steve said that immediately threw Tony off-guard. The shock was like being doused with a bucket of ice water. Sure, he hadn't expected Steve to look at him with nothing but love in his eyes and run into his arms like a damn Nicholas Sparks novel, but that was just mean. Tony tried to think of anything he might have said or done recently that might have upset Steve. The only thing that was coming to mind was…
A virus was sent to the Avengers through the mail, infecting Clint but no one else. Natasha rushed into his isolation room with her phone so that way he could at least hear Laura's voice one last time if things went wrong, and Tony and Steve were reunited at the hospital. Meanwhile, SI is dealing with a public relations disaster after the head of their public relations department tried to smear the company on national TV.
designed to terrorist groups for years without you noticing?" Tony was a split second away from saying or doing something he'd regret when Pepper finally broke through.
Instead, Tony channels these comments and turns them into his charming, ‘takes up the whole room’ personality.
Carol, who was sitting at the dining table eating her breakfast, asked, “What language was that Steve?”
The walls are littered with paintings done by Steve especially for this exhibition. Pop up tables are scattered throughout the room with an array of appetisers; prawns, scampi, cocktail sausages, pigs in a blanket, meatballs, spring rolls, vegetable skewers. A chocolate fountain stands in the back left corner, a plate of strawberries sits beside it. Waiters are walking around with champagne flutes, handing them out to newcomers and guests with empty glasses.
He loves his family and he wouldn’t trade it in for anything. He loves his husband, his kids, his best friend, his old friends, his new friends, and his bots that he started to design and create.
Steve closed the space between their lips, kissing Tony softly and slowly. It was over quicker than either man would’ve liked. They smiled at each other like small children before kissing again, this time lasting longer than before.
“Yes Tones you did. You know it’s okay to fall in love right. And you know it’s okay that it’s Captain America.”
Steve exits the coffee shop and Tony falls to the ground behind the counter and sighs. He’s going to be dreaming of Steve tonight.
“Yes, and this right here-” Tony points to the painting of his building in front of them “-is mine.”
Tony opens his eyes and stares at his best friend, “Honeybear, it’s a jacket. Wear it, don’t wear it. I don’t care. It’s comfortable and smells like Steve so I’m keeping mine.”
Tony was breathing heavily and leaned his head on Steve’s forehead, “You sure you’ve never kissed anyone before?” He joked.
“I was thinking of how I should do this and I guess almost dying in battle made me realise I really don’t have any time to waste so here it goes. Tony, when I saw you for the first time in that coffee shop I knew that there was something special about you. And then you gave me your number. I never called though because I wanted to see you in person, ask you out in person. I got to know you, the real you and I fell even harder in love. You’re the best thing that ever happened to me Tony. You make me a better person, a better hero. We may fight, hell our relationship started with a fight, but that’s just who we are and that’s what I love about you. I’m ready and willing to spend the rest of my life with you if you’ll have me. So Anthony Edward Stark, will you marry me?”
Tony never expected Steve to come back, or to call him so to say that he was shocked to see Steve enter the coffee shop at the same time again the next day was an understatement.
"Well, technically he's still handcuffed," Tony pointed out. "So, he couldn't have gotten far. Also, he has one of those special S.H.I.E.L.D. tracker bracelets on, so it shouldn't be that hard to find him."
"The elevator already has that function built in," JARVIS said dryly. "I believe that's why Mr. Stark gave you a key."
"I didn't like the looks of things," the man said. "People were starting to get crazy and all the booze wasn't helping. I saw them crack open three kegs while we were in there and I swear to God there were five more in back." Tony stopped in his tracks the moment he heard the word "booze." He turned and rushed to follow them up to the stairs.
Bruce had to fight to keep his pulse steady. He couldn't afford to Hulk-out; not here and not now. Still, anger couldn't help but leak through. Someone set out to hurt him; hurt the closest things he had to friends in a long time. It stung and all he wanted to do was find the people responsible
Tony smirked in amusement as a very annoyed-looking S.H.I.E.L.D. agent walked into the observation room with a bag of burgers in-hand. He was probably enjoying this a little too much, but he didn't care. Any opportunity to ruffle a S.H.I.E.L.D. agents feathers was an opportunity that must be taken. The agent shoved the bag into Tony's chest.
Carol let the energy flow through her body, hoping that she could burn her attacker off of her. Beta realized this, though, and punched Carol in the mouth with her concrete fist. The move succeeded in throwing Carol off for a moment, allowing Beta a chance to reposition herself so she could better pin down Carol's arms with her legs. Carol wasn't going to let that stop her from trying again. The power flowed through her once more, but as soon as her body started glowing, Alpha fired a beam directly at Carol's head.
"The system is fine," Tony said. "Working flawlessly, in fact. The first thing I did yesterday after talking to the police was checking to make sure that no one had hacked into our systems. I personally double-checked every single system, file, and entry point for any sign we had been hacked and had JARVIS scan the whole system from top to bottom just to be safe. I didn't find anything; zip, zilch, nothing, no nada. I specifically designed my systems so that way if they were somehow hacked, then we'd have enough crumbs to lead us back to whoever stole the cookie jar. It's impossible for any hacker not to leave a trace through my systems. Even
So for those of you who don't know (and if that is the case, I'm sorry to be the one to break this to you) the actor who portrayed T'Challa/the Black Panther, Chadwick Boseman, passed away of colon cancer last Friday, August 28th, 2020. I had no idea he was sick, and it sounds like not a lot of other people did either. It's heartbreaking that he passed away so young - at the age of 43 - and now I certainly know I won't be able to watch Endgame without crying ever again. I mean, Tony and Natasha's deaths were sad, but at least Robert Downey Jr. and Scarlett Johansson are still alive. Now that we know that's the last time we'll see Chadwick as T'Challa ever again... Oooff! That hurts my heart! I also learned following his death that he was the guy who played Jackie Robinson in the movie 42, and I remember thinking to myself while I was watching it "Damn, this guy is good! I hope I see him in other things someday!" Little did I know, I did. My heart goes out to his family and I wish them all the best in this difficult time. Rest in power, Chadwick. You deserve it.
"Well, I expect you'll hear from her shortly," he said. "After all, I don't think she'd like to hear about one of her agents undermining FBI jurisdiction."
Quickly, the Chitauri took notice of Tony and started firing at him. Tony quickly responded, knocking a few out of the sky with repulsor blasts and taking out as many as he could lock onto by firing the miniature homing missiles in his shoulders. He kept weaving through the flow of invaders. A few got away, but Tony chose to ignore them for the moment while he worked on making sure that a few of their friends got through as possible. If only his backup wasn't taking so long to arrive…
A very drunk Tony got into an argument with Steve and snuck out of the hotel room. What's going to happen to him now?
"That, ma'am," he said. "Is more proof to me that you should have never taken my daughters away from me." She was dead before she could give her response.
He heard Laura take a deep breath, as if to compose herself. If Clint were with her right then, he'd take her hand and give it a little squeeze to reassure her that she could say anything to him. Unfortunately, the thousands of miles between them made that impossible.
From that day Charles Elias Mozzarella ceased to exist. He would be reborn as the prophet of a new religious movement; Daniel Adoniram.
"But I do find a lot about that woman concerning." Tony furrowed his brow. "Oh, don't act so surprised. You had to know this was coming." He couldn't really argue with that.
"Yes." With a sharp intake of breath, Jessica brought her hand up to her hair. This was not good. "Do I know you?" Jess let out a stressed laugh.
Salinas' house was a lot smaller than Tony expected it to be. From the outside, it looked only to be a one-bedroom ranch; a very nice one-bedroom ranch, but a one-bedroom ranch, nonetheless. Most politicians tended to buy houses that were much more grandiose than that. However, from what Tony could see, what it lacked in size it more than made up for in yard space. He could see the tops of multiple greenhouses in the back yard and the front yard was sectioned off as if it were garden or a field. It looked rather nice, too, even though it was all covered in snow.
"You don't get it." To his surprise, Dr. Cranston's face was quirked with more curiosity than annoyance.
"Okay," Lara said. "Is it alright if I go in and see him? There are a few questions on this form I don't know the answers to."
Remember kids, you never know how much of an undertaking something is going to be until you actually do it.
Thank you to the guest who left kudos on AO3 and mfaerie32 on FFN for the review! It really means a lot! :)
Shock set in almost immediately. He couldn't believe it. Tony had gotten thrown out of the hotel by the police. How? Why? Those questions and more rocketed through Steve's mind at a break-neck speed. He was so shocked; he couldn't even react properly.
Steve carried Tony down the hall to their suite bridal-style. Although he was trying to enjoy the moment, Tony couldn't help the fantasies the situation suggested; Steve carefully and gently carrying him to their bed and then brutally making love to him. The idea was so tantalizing that it was a shame that it would never happen.
Unscrewing the cap, Tony started to chug it all down at once. He knew it wasn't a good idea to drink mouthwash, but he could feel himself starting to sober up and he couldn't lose that buzz. It wasn't until he had finished the bottle that he saw the two most accursed words on the planet written on it:
At first, the intruders resisted only with words. By Lara's guess, they were demanding Wallace to get the elevators operational for them. Likely, Wallace refused, and he was struck on the back of the head with the butt of one of the agents' rifles. The blow didn't knock him unconscious, but it clearly took a lot out of him as his left hand went to protect the spot that had been hit while his right hand supported him as he leaned over in a kneeling position. Lara narrated the events to the 911 operator, who put in a request for an ambulance along with the police back-up, which according to the operator, should arrive momentarily. That ended up being too long.
Lara was sitting on the floor, playing a game of keep-away with the dog. She wasn't being mean about it. She held a bright green and pink tennis ball in her hand and held it high enough so it would be just out of Lucky's reach if he sat or stood normally, but he'd easily be able to get to it if he stood up on his hind legs or jumped. Lucky didn't seem to get that though, or at least was just intent on using a different strategy to get what he wanted. He looked up at Lara with big, wide, puppy-dog eyes, silently pleading with her to let go of the ball. It was a sound strategy and had worked for Lucky in the past, but this time, Lara was not budging.
The hug didn't last long for previously stated reasons, but Tony made sure to savor every second. Steve pulled back slowly and gently, giving Tony's bicep a rup.
"…I thought you Jesus freaks were supposed to freak out at that kind of shit." Ironically, those ended up being the right words, as he got the exact reaction, he wanted out of the two men with his previous statement with this one.
Stark shook his head. Carol shrugged and popped a few pretzels in her mouth. They were good, though she usually preferred the bigger, softer pretzels to the smaller, crunchy, grocery store variety. However, she would take what she could get. She paused a moment afterward, letting herself consider what she was going to say before she said it.
"Yeah," Tony laughed. "It takes us a while to get any traction, I'll give you that one, but let's do a head count, here. Your brother, the demigod…" Loki looked away at the mention of his brother and Tony used that as an opportunity to retrieve the bracelets he had slipped under the bar's counter. "A Super Soldier, a living legend who kind of lives up to the legend; a man with breathtaking anger management issues; a couple of master assassins…" Tony felt a thankful bit of satisfaction come over him as he clicked the second bracelet shut. "And you, big fella, you've managed to piss off every single one of them."
His head still hurt, though, so that was a negative. When he was in the shower, the feeling of the water droplets hitting his head was pure agony. He even thought he was seeing double at a few different points. He tried taking Excedrin, but like everything else he tried it barely even touched the pain.
"What I said hurt you." Tony fell silent. "I knew it would before I said it and I still said it anyway. I was upset, and I hurt you on purpose and I'm sorry for that. It was bad enough that I already did a complete one-eighty on you, but to imply I was better than you in any way…"
"I can already see that much is true." Adoniram remarked before gesturing for her to follow him. "Come, we can discuss this more on the way to the conference room.
"Everything." Steve looked back up. "How is this possible? How am I still alive? Is anyone else alive? Bucky…"
"Oh my God," she said as she struggled for breath. "We just robbed Stark Industries! I can't believe it! Hey, once we've dropped this stuff off back at my place, do you want to go out and find a place to get smashed? I really need a drink right now."
"Okay," Freeman held up his hands in a reassuring gesture. "I understand. No judgment, no pressure, but you know you're not going to be able to hide that from the public forever, right?"
"What," he heard the second voice said. It was lower than the first. "You afraid that he's going to Hulk out?"
Still, no matter how sorry Rhodey was feeling for Tony right then, Tony was feeling ten-thousand times sorrier for himself. Just to exemplify that, Tony wiped at his face while trying to suck as much snot as he could back up into his nose. It did not work too well.
"Can't give you an ETA, but I should be back to drop off this little guy soon." He just needed to get access to a quinjet, which he knew wouldn't be too hard.
"Well, excellent then," Viv said. "Then we can just jump right into the tour. Is there anything specific you wanted to see?"
"In the State of New York," DeMarcus said. "Trespass against land is considered a misdemeanor and carries a maximum penalty of twelve months incarceration. Meanwhile, accessories to a crime can face up to fifteen years in prison and that's usually reserved for truly serious crimes such as murder or bank robbery. With trespass, a judge is more likely to add a few years' probation to his sentence."
A now ex-SI employee tried to disparage the company on national television and now Tony, Pepper, and Lara have to deal with the fallout.
spy. His secrets have secrets." He then reached into the bag of blueberries he was holding and popped a few in his mouth. "It's bothering him, too." He said with a full mouth while gesturing over to Bruce.
"It looks different," Steve finally said. "But it's still the same. Steve turned to Tony and saw that his lips were still slightly quirked up.
"I'll go find an agent," Bruce said. "They at least need to get the word out to the post offices in Newark just in case anyone's been exposed."
"Emergency protocols have been initiated," she reported. "All civilians are evacuating via the north-west and north-east stairwells. Your head of security advised that we should evacuate to the basement using the south-west stairwell."
Steve knew better than to say that caveat out loud. He did not need to make it explicit when his previous words held the implication so tightly. Still, he was no less shocked when Tony gave his hand a squeeze.
"Slow down." Reluctantly, Lara slowed her pace a bit, allowing Bruce to catch up. He still had to run, though. "What happened?"
"What did you find onboard the downed aircraft?" Hill didn't mince words and got right to the point.
Tony's thought process was cut off by Steve's lips crashing into his again. God damn, he didn't know what had gotten into Steve, but Tony had to admit he liked it and this kiss had to be even better than the last one. Steve was an excellent kisser, but this time Tony got to be even more of an active participant. It was invigorating, the heat that swirled between them with each passing second and when they broke apart, neither one of them could wipe the ridiculous smiles off their faces.
He spent the whole night sitting at the desk, touching the shard and pulling his fingers away, trying to process the information being dumped on him and trying to figure out how to get it to come to him at a much slower, more understandable pace. He started to notice that every time he touches the shard, he'd first be faced with the image of Karl Marx. Every time, he'd be too shocked to speak. It eventually occurred to him that maybe all he needed to do to interface with whatever this shard was speak up. It took a few tries, but eventually, he was able to get over his internal shock and was able to force a word out.
"You can try," she said. "But I doubt you'll get anywhere." She handed the cell phone over to Clint and he smirked.
"She does have a point there, Clint," Bruce added. "You tired yourself out pretty quickly there trying to get out from under my grasp – again, sorry about that – but I have no doubt that you would have just as easily become fatigued if you tried to help out downstairs as well."
Yes, Steve was finally willing to admit it. He had a crush on Tony Stark. It scared him a little, but not as much as it did before. Over the course of the past thirteen months, Steve had slowly come to accept that being LGBTQ wasn't as stigmatized in society as it had been back in the '40s. Hell, according to Tony it wasn't even as stigmatized as it was when he was growing up. Society had come along way in a very short amount of time. Well, there were still groups like the Westboro Baptist Church that took every chance they could to spread their hateful message, but they were slowly becoming the minority. Gay marriage had even been legalized in New York just a couple of months ago. He still wasn't quite ready to come out himself, but just knowing that things were getting better made him happy. Almost as happy as he felt around Tony.
"Stark is safe and with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent." If Hill said anything more after that, Steve didn't hear it. He let out a breath of complete relief.
Not long after boarding, they had taken off. One of the perks of having a private jet was that there were no delays or wait times. Tony was okay during lift-off and for the first ten or fifteen minutes of the flight. Then everything went to hell.
"No," Tony said. "If anyone threatens this planet and/or the lives of the people on it, we will defend them."
"Should we do one of those things you see on TV?" Clint asked. "You know, where they hold a meeting in someone's living room, confront them about the negative consequences of their addiction, and then force them to go to rehab." Lara immediately looked apprehensive.
“I know a lot about you, too, Tony. Or, at least, I used to. This whole Spymaster situation is affecting you more than any of the rest of us, and I just want to make sure that you don’t do anything stupid because you think that we don’t want to help. I stand by what I said about not killing, but if the situation calls for it then I will do anything to keep you safe. I want you to know that.”
“I’ll try,” mutters Tony after a long pause. He scratches absentmindedly at his arms which are crossed over his chest like a protective barrier. “For you, I’ll try.”
Oh, and I decided to do a chapter using some of Steve's POV for a change, so feedback on that would be fantastic. Hopefully next week's update will be on time since I get my summer holidays on Wednesday; woohoo!
Tony huffs and chews on the bread in his mouth slowly, eventually swallowing it and sticking out his tongue at Natasha to show her his empty mouth. She quirks an eyebrow and hands him another. As Tony concentrates on chewing, Natasha coaxes Tony into standing and guides him out of the kitchen and towards the elevator with a gentle hand on his back. Rhodey wheels after them silently. They step into the elevator and Natasha orders FRIDAY to take them to the underground car park, which is when Steve slips past the doors and stands next to her.
“Yep?” asks Tony aloud, setting his StarkPad down on the counter and following the delicious pizza smell towards the microwave.
“How are they?” asks Clint. Tony flinches, and he’s absolutely certain that everyone catches it. He ignores the pity in their eyes and absentmindedly scratches at the scars on his arms before stuffing is hands deep into his pockets.
As he walks down the corridor, baseball cap pulled down over his face to try and shield himself from the eyes of workers and patients and, most importantly, reporters, the familiar clicking of heels against the floor sounds from behind him and he turns to see Pepper walking after him. She doesn’t look pleased, but she doesn’t look as angry as she did earlier, either. Steve gulps and hopes that his worry doesn’t show on his face.
“No,” replies Tony sharply. He then sighs. “Well, yes, sort of. It’s everything, Pep. I just need some time away from every
“We’re going to have to tell them, you know,” says Rhodey, pushing himself forward as the elevator doors open. He swivels himself around as Tony steps in after him and the doors close again. Tony sighs and runs a hand through his hair.
“Yes,” says Tony at the same time that Rhodey says “No” and Tony glares at him, which makes the Colonel huff in indignation.
“Alert the others and tell them to suit up. If Clint’s in the vents, tell him to check it out but not to engage the intruder until Nat and I get there. Tell Falcon to bring Redwing and check the perimeter for anything suspicious or out of the ordinary.”
Steve turns to look over his shoulder at her and, as he’s momentarily distracted, Tony sends her a pleading look. Pepper’s face immediately turns to stone, mouth set in a firm line and eyes narrowed just enough to intimidate but not enough to terrify. She turns her gaze to Steve and Tony watches as the super soldier's shoulders tense and his jaw clenches.
Tony remains on the landing pad for hours with his feet dangling over the edge, watching the sky fade until the bright pinks and purples and oranges have turned into an inky black sky. It’s times like this that Tony hates living in the middle of Manhattan because the city lights cause the stars and constellations to disappear, and he contemplates purchasing a small house somewhere far away in the countryside to escape to on days like this. The New York skyline doesn’t amaze him anymore.
“I killed them,” says Bucky. Natasha’s mouth remains a thin line. Steve doesn’t seem nearly as shocked as everyone else, which confirms Tony’s suspicions that he knew all along and never told him, and he takes a step back in an attempt to conceal his hurt. Clint actually chokes on his own saliva in his shock.
Natasha shoves another slice of bread into Tony’s mouth and waits until the engineer begins chewing it sluggishly before she turns back to look at Steve. She eyes him judgementally for a moment and then slowly nods her head. Steve feels a sense of relief wash over him.
Tony and Rhodey share a look. “Well, I’m flattered that you’ve all come to my aid so quickly, but I don’t need it. Sit down.”
for Steve to have a change of heart, but he never says anything about it. Nevertheless, he acts as unaffected by the kindness as he did before about the rudeness and general dislike of all things Tony. It turns out to be a gigantic mistake on Tony’s part because he actually develops feelings for Steve Rogers and doesn’t that shock him to his very core. It’s not that Tony thought that no one would ever come after Pepper; it’s just that he hadn’t expected it to happen so soon and with
Bucky holds Natasha’s gaze determinedly but a look of shame appears on his face. Finally, Natasha turns to Steve and sighs heavily at the stricken expression that has taken over his face.
“So, what’s this meeting about?” asks Sam, removing the goggles from his face and turning to look at Tony. “I’m assuming it’s important, if you dragged your ass back from wherever the hell you were just to be here.”
“No,” she denies firmly. “I broke up with you because I couldn’t handle watching you fly away in that suit-” She jabs a finger in the direction of the suit he wore today. Tony glances over and the helmet stares back at him, taunting him. “- and wondering if that would be the last time I saw you. I tried to support you, I really did, but you have a death wish, Tony. I’m sorry if I was selfish, but the stress was eating me alive.”
Bruce remains as calm as ever on the screen, while Tony fidgets restlessly watching the scene unfold. “Yes, technically I am a doctor, but I’m not that kind of doctor. And even if I was, there would be nothing I could do to help you. You’d need a highly skilled expert in engineering to take a look at it, and even that would be risky.”
“Hey, Stevie,” greets Bucky from the doorway of Steve’s bedroom. He leans against the doorframe with a towel draped over his shoulder, drenched in sweat from his workout.
“Oh, I have no idea, honestly,” he replies in a dry tone. Something beeps in the background and Bruce looks over his shoulder with a curse, and then jumps up and goes beyond the reach of the camera, leaving Natasha sitting there with an exasperated look on her face.
. I want to be able to go about everyday life without having to drown myself in alcohol, and I want to be able to live without people constantly throwing me looks of pity and whispering about me behind my back. I’m sick and tired of people thinking I’m helpless, okay? I just- I need this.” Tony heaves a long sigh as he takes a left and enters the airport. “I’m trying to take care of myself for once, so your nagging seems to have finally stuck.”
“The Vision has returned to New York for a brief visit, and has requested I inform you that he will return to the Tower once he has done what is required of him.”
At 7 am Happy finds Tony with the blanket wrapped around his shoulders and over his head, knees pulled up close to his chest, body tilted slightly to the left. As Happy draws nearer he sees that his friend is only half-asleep. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out that Tony hasn’t slept well, what with the lights and the darker-than-usual bags under his eyes. Happy keeps from sighing and slowly hobbles around on his crutches until the lights are turned off once more and there’s a cool bottle of water held between his teeth. With a quick glance over his shoulder, Happy rounds the corner and heads back into his bedroom.
The elevator reaches Natasha and Clint’s floor and Tony wipes under his eyes, ridding his face of fresh tear tracks, as the doors open once more. He steps out and sees the two agents standing in front of the TV in silence, looking rather puzzled. It takes Tony a second, but he manages to spot the problem from his place across the room. He stares at it in surprise.
Barnes’ voice is muffled to Tony’s ears. He can barely hear the ex-assassin over the pounding of his heart and the rapid intake of his breaths.
“What are you doing here?” asks Natasha, not unkindly. Steve glances at her and opens his mouth before snapping it shut again.
"I- Tony..." he stutters, at a total loss for words. Tony refuses to look at him and instead stares at the floor, a small and self-deprecating smile on his lips.
“That sounds an awful lot like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder,” mutters Bruce, to which Tony laughs. The doctor’s expression turns cold. “This is serious, Tony. You should have told me sooner.”
The man in question stares at Tony like he has two heads which, okay, rude. “You have got some serious issues, Stark.”
“Tell them I’m coming right up,” he says. The elevator doors open as Tony walks towards them, purposefully not looking over his shoulder at Steve, who is still standing in the middle of the workshop looking lost and crushed. Once the doors close behind him, Tony releases a shaky sigh and runs his unsteady fingers through his hair, allowing his back to slide down the wall of the elevator until he hits the ground and the last of Tony’s resolve crumples. Sobs wrack through his body and his tears create dark splotches on his favourite AC/DC shirt, but none of it matters because he just lost the man that means the most to him in this world. The immense pain in his head caused by the heaving and sobbing almost matches the pain in his chest, but not quite.
“How is he?” he mutters softly. Pepper lifts her shoulders and then drops them in a graceless shrug. She looks exhausted and possibly traumatised, and all he wants to do is bundle her up in warm blankets and protect both her and Happy from all of the bad things in the world.
“Thanks, Colonel.” Tony winces at how his voice cracks, but Rhodey doesn’t comment on it and thus Tony adds it to the ever-growing list dubbed ‘Reasons to Love and Appreciate James Rhodes’.
“We need a place to stay,” interrupts Bucky, giving Steve a look that makes Tony shift uncomfortably on the couch. “The place we were at didn’t work out.”
“I just mean that he needs help,” Clint responds, hands raised in surrender. “Like therapeutic help, counselling,
Instead of returning to his workshop, Tony rides the elevator up to his penthouse instead to take a long, hot shower. How long had he been in the workshop, anyway? He takes his time in the shower to scrub all of the sweat and dirt away and only steps out of it once his skin starts to prune up. Tony decides to forego his usual jean/t-shirt attire and instead changes into his comfiest pair of sweatpants and one of his Led Zeppelin shirts. Walking through his penthouse in his bare feet while wearing his lazy day clothes is freeing in a way that Tony has never experienced before.
"I talked to Pepper and Happy about everything," he said. "What happened in D.C. and everything since… Specifically with the drinking…"
"What?" he found himself saying at the same time as Pepper. Looking over at the redheaded woman – who was now sitting in the driver's seat of the car – Steve could tell that she was assessing him the same way an animal would a predator or a threat. He didn't blame her. For all she knew, he was the one that made Tony sick.
"They have conference rooms available to rent out," she said. "I was thinking once we've had time to settle in, we can use one of these spaces to have our meeting."
The words were completely lost on Lucky. All he understood was that he wanted the ball, she had the ball, and he needed her to drop the ball. He was a dog, not a child. It was completely useless to try to impart a life lesson to him. That was not going to stop Lara from trying, though. She was steadfast and stubborn and was not going to let a dog get the better of her. Bruce would have probably found it amusing if it were not for the slightly despondent undertone to her demeanor.
"I don't understand." She noticed the way Tony jumped a little bit when he realized that someone, he wasn't expecting had entered the room. "What's the problem? You certainly can afford to get a guy to do it, so it's not like you have to do all of the work yourself." Tony took a breath before responding.
He frowned as he remembered the last of that glass of wine a few minutes ago. Oh, well. All that meant was that it was time to get some more.
The third time he woke up it was to cellphone's ringtone. He muttered something resembling an assurance and a plea to go back to sleep before dismissing the call and turning off the phone. He fell back to sleep within moments.
Clint was thrown back across the yard as the missile touched the ground. He could see every panel, floorboard, and shard of glass break apart in slow motion. His family was in that house; Laura, Lila, Cooper…
"Wow," Lara said. "Even when I tell you directly what the point is, you still miss it." She turned away and took a deep breath, needing a moment to collect her thoughts before she jumped back into the argument again. She had just about figured out what she was going to say when Steve made the announcement that he was "finished." Looking back, Lara could see that Tony had furrowed his brow.
"You're free to raid my cardboard box on the side of the Pacific Coast Highway." Oswin couldn't help but laugh at that.
Duran ran back over to Nina, who at this point had completely turned to solid stone. She could see that the woman's brown eyes were twitching away in her crystal skull. Whether this was some neurological reaction or Nina was still alive in there, begging for help in the only way she could was unclear to Duran. She felt a pang of guilt run through her chest and couldn't help but mouth the words "I'm sorry" to the helpless woman. She turned and looked away before Nina's eyes stopped moving.
Happy had explained all of that in a long, frantic ramble of words that Rhodey was just barely able to follow. Since he was at work, Rhodey could not stay on the line long or rush over there, but he was quick to assure Happy that he would be over to see Tony as soon as work let out. Once the call was over, Rhodey set about his work as usual, albeit giving a little more focus to the clock than he normally would.
"I hate to break it to you," Tony said. "But no matter how much you try and how much you plan, it's not going to keep you safe. These people are merciless. They know how to ruin lives." Dr. Cranston tilted her head to the side.
"You can't tell me you didn't strategically plan that to make Stark – and by extension, the company – look bad. For God's sake, the video footage of Stark and Col. Rhodes' fight went viral!" Romanoff took a deep breath.
"Doesn't mean you should," six voices spoke up simultaneously. Carol's shoulders sagged a bit in defeat. Tony gestured for her to come closer.
"Are you kidding me?" Oswin pulled her hand back. "Hell no! I'm not turning myself in and I'm not going to leave Nina alone when there's a madman out there trying to kill us!"
"Uh," Rhodes said. "Let's just say people weren't as progressive about the issue twenty years ago as they are now. I think certainly he would have gotten a more positive reception for coming out. Although, the way he came out still probably would have been a train wreck…"
"Isn't that the truth." Bruce started to back away from the door. "Okay, I'll leave you to get dressed, then." Natasha nodded in acknowledgment.
"No, I'm good for the moment." Pepper nodded and headed down the hall. Tony's face dropped the second she was out of earshot. "I still haven't told her my insurance dropped me for medically experimenting on myself. That's going to be a fun conversation."
"Well, I wouldn't exactly call the air fresh," Tony said. "But I guess you can't be too picky when you haven't been outside in… Well, it's good to be outside, right?"
Thor wasn't supposed to come back. He sent the Destroyer to ensure that wouldn't happen. Somehow, though, Thor had proven himself worthy of wielding Mjolnir and had his powers restored. The Bifrost had been destroyed, and now he and Thor were dangling off the bridge, the only thing keeping them from falling into the black abyss of space being Odin's grip on Thor's leg. Loki had failed.
"I already told you over the phone." He was hoping he could skip the part where he had to grovel about what was wrong with him and just get to the part where she told him what he could do to fix it, but apparently Dr. Cranston wasn't going to play it that way.
"'Salinas has been a follower of the teachings of the Peoples Unity Church of the Supreme Understanding since at least the age of nineteen,'" Romanoff recited. "'He's heavily involved in church activities and appears to be a senior member of the group."
Which was in fact, true. After days of suffering through the detoxification process, Tony's symptoms had seemingly subsided. He never went into a seizure (which was a miracle) but the affects still weren't pleasant to go through; nausea and vomiting; chills and aches; fevers and delusions… It was as far from a walk in the park as one could get and for as long as he lived, Tony never wanted to go through it again.
"What are we?" Steve's eyebrows knitted together, but he didn't attempt to open his eyes or pull away.
I also couldn't resist adding the Gabrielle Giffords cameo. She had been invited to the State of the Union as a special guest of Michelle Obama at the 2012 State of the Union so there was that little bit of accuracy. Also, because of the fact that I kind of look up to her. I mean, I'm sure I don't agree with her on her politics, but I just can't help but admire her strength. Not only did she get shot in the head and survive, but she did her best to continue serving as a Congresswoman afterward. She resigned on January 25th, 2012 to focus on her recovery, but I'm impressed that she held on as long as she did. To this day she continues to make great strides in her recovery and is an advocate for stricter gun-control.
"Hey," Steve said. "Are you alright? You're shaking a bit." Tony tried taking a deep breath in to try to get a grip on himself, but it didn't seem to be working.
Instantly the room exploded into a state of chaos. People began to run about, grabbing things and talking over each other. Some went hastily to dial numbers on the desk phones while others donned bright green safety vests and headed for the exits. Lara watched all of this in a stunned silence.
Before they could go up to the penthouse, they had to make a stop on the level of the lobby, where Lara would be getting off. She had only gone with them to the tower because it was a lot easier and made a bit more sense for her to go there with them and catch a train from Grand Central Station. From there, she would take the subway until she connected at the station for the line going to Nyack, New York, where her brother lived, and she had left her car and cat. Just before the elevator doors opened, Tony grabbed her attention.
"It won't." The firmness in Bruce's voice was unquestionable, easily quelling any doubts Clint or Natasha might have had. The latter nodded her head approvingly.
"Are you okay with me leaving to find someone to help me get you to the hospital?" Steve hesitated a moment. "I promise, no one is going to stick a needle in your eye.
With a few parting words to Cranston, the five of them were walking out of the office at a far brisker pace than when they came in. Despite the situation, Steve wasn't deterred from falling into step beside Tony and gently placing a hand on the small of his back.
"Hey," she said. "Do you need anything else?" Tony quickly shook his head. Natasha, catching on to his wariness, sighed. "You think I'm mad at you, don't you?" Tony gave her a "well, duh" look. "Well, I'll tell you this; I'm not happy, but I'm not mad either. I'm sorry. I picked the wrong time and place to press the issue I shouldn't have confronted you the way I did. Can you forgive me?"
"Well, what were you thinking before you started drinking yesterday?" Lara asked. "Give us one example. Maybe it will give us a helpful clue."
In the kitchen, Steve dumps the bags of cold cuts, some fruit, and the water bottles into a reusable shopping bag to make it easy to carry. He snatches a package of cookies from Clint's shelf, silently promising to replace them, and heads back to his and Tony's rooms.
Tony looks up at the dark sky filled with red and yellow hues, feeling the anticipation as the people around them begin to scream the count down.
Sharon had come over to their shared flat twice, the first was after the new year of this year, and one was after her summer vacation with Steve to Florida. Tony could never deny that Steve and Sharon looked picturesque together. They were indeed the perfect couple. Time would tell when they would decide to tie the knot and then retreat to a suburb with a white picket fence, surrounded by their perfect blonde children. During the two times Sharon was there, he would always go over to Rhodey’s.
"You don't have to do that tonight, you know. I should have said something." He leans against the door frame, watching the way the soft yellow light from an antique lamp plays across her red hair. "I figured the way we blew off debrief would have spoken for me."
Tony watches Steve look towards the audience. His posture is straight, and he has a focused expression on his face. When he gets his cue to begin, he looks back to his accompanist and nods at him, indicating that he is ready to start. The pianist begins playing, and Steve plays the first few notes of
“Why?” Tony presses on, and when Steve’s blue piercing eyes looked straight towards his line of vision, Tony felt his cheeks grow hot. He apologizes instead for pressing on.
“It’s ok Tony, I am happy to share with you,” Steve smiles at him. “It was summer this year when Sharon and I went to Florida for a summer get-away when I realized we are not going to work out,”
"Oh, sassy!" Tony chuckles, and JARVIS heaves another sigh. Steve really does wonder, sometimes, why Tony programmed him to be able to do that. It's amusing, if nothing else.
It's been over a year since he heard the news that said that Tony Stark, the CEO of Stark Industries, was found dead in a hotel in San Juan. The alleged suicide caused Steve to shed a few tears --His fondest memories were being Tony's friend before the country had succumbed to another debilitating pandemic, thus creating another wave of economic recession. Until now, he regrets not declaring his love for his friend when he had the chance.
"But you could have lost," Tony continues frankly. "You can't rely on audience impact always, the judges…" he falters for a moment as he remembers his father's words. "The judges won't care if you entertained the audience; you have to play the music right."
The blue light of the AI's scanner descends from the ceiling as Tony points into Steve's face. "You're a pain in my ass."
Piling his arms with the ice packs, Steve calls out, "Tony, I think JARVIS needs an upgrade!" When he hears no answer, Steve can't help but panic just a teeny bit. When you're dating Tony Stark, someone famous for putting himself in harm's way, it's hard not to. But when Steve re-enters the bedroom, it's to see Tony on his back, eyes closed and breathing evenly. He hates to wake him, he really does, but they both need to clean up and shower. "Is he okay, JARVIS," Steve asks, setting everything at the foot of the bed.
It started two years ago; he was in a bad place: an argument with his father forced him to move out prematurely, he was glad that Steve was there to the rescue. Steve’s old roommate had to leave for Boston, and he needed someone to share rent with, and Tony’s just so happy to fill in that spot.
Tony stares at him for a moment, allowing the words to register. “Did I just hear you correctly? Did you just say that
Tony releases a cold chuckle. “Happy’s in the hospital. There was an explosion and he and Pepper were involved. I flew back to be with her at the hospital. She- She thinks they were targeted.” More silence follows and Tony sighs. “I know it’s a lot to ask but-”
After another hour of kneeling at an awkward position on the floor (which cannot be good for his back) and taking in deep, heaving breaths, Tony finally manages to calm down enough that only his hands and bottom lip are trembling. Slowly, the engineer rises with a grimace of discomfort and stumbles towards the couch, falling face first onto it.
“And my mom may not have, you know, won any mother of the fuckin’ year awards but, shit, she was still my mom. They were my parents and you took them from me. I don’t care if it was Hydra, or Pierce, or whoever the fuck else-” Tony waves his arms around and more of the liquid spills onto his lap and the couch. “
A while later, when Tony has his entire private floor on lockdown so that he can drink his very expensive whiskey in peace, a crash alerts him to someone’s presence. He drunkenly leaps from the couch and nearly falls flat on his face but manages to grab hold of himself at the last minute. Tony swirls around, bottle in hand, and squints in the direction of the dark hallway leading to his bedroom.
Early one Thursday morning, at 4:22am to be exact, Tony is sitting on the floor of his bedroom and glaring at his closet. His back is leaning against the end of his bed as he sits cross-legged and tries to ignore the duffle bag peeking out from between the crack in the door. Ten minutes later and Tony is jumping up and dragging the bag out into the middle of his bedroom floor. He runs around the room, hastily tossing items of clothing and gadgets and important Stark Industries documents into the bag and he orders FRIDAY to check the building to see if anyone is awake while he zips up the black duffle bag.
Natasha rounds the other side of the breakfast bar, nudging past Sam on her way to the fridge. She grabs the carton of pulp free orange juice and pours herself a glass before hoisting herself up onto the countertop next to where Sam is serving up more pancakes. An amused smile is pulling at the corners of her mouth.
Tony takes in a deep breath and walks over to the far corner of his workshop, where the space resembles more of his lab upstairs than it does the rest of the workshop. There isn’t as much of a clutter in this side of the workshop, though, and the workbench is empty aside from a small glass box with a keypad on the front. Tony enters the six-digit code and the small glass chamber opens, releasing a cloud of mist. He waits until the mist clears and carefully grabs one of the test tubes with two of his undamaged fingers, which proves to be harder than it looks but Tony eventually manages to place it in a holder to be left for the time being.
“Love you, honey bear!” Tony calls back, rushing into the elevator and silently praying that the doors shut before Natasha reaches him, because if she does he is definitely going to be put to sleep for a
“Unbelievable. You don’t have to stand up for him just because he’s a fuckin’ alcoholic. He shouldn’t get-”
So, surprise! This fic is back! I'm actually the worst, feel free to give out to me for the three-year hiatus. I never forgot about this fic because it's my baby but I just HATE how it's written and I've been too embarrassed and frustrated to come back to it, but I told myself to cop on so here we are! I make no promises as to frequent updates but I will try my hardest to complete this behemoth.
Clint looks down at his lap in a rare display of awkwardness, or perhaps discomfort. “Sam and myself – obviously -, Wanda, and Bucky.”
Tony spends far too long considering it before he shakes his head. “No, no, that’s okay. I’m needed here. I can deal with this shit.”
“I wouldn’t miss something this huge, Barton,” snaps Tony. His eyes travel to Natasha and they widen almost comically as he jerks a finger to point in her direction. “Tasha, you know he’s been trying to kill me for years! Hell, you saved me from his Elite before! You have to believe me!”
“Got it, boss. The Captain, along with Sergeant Barnes, Dr. Banner, and Ms. Maximoff, have taken the fire escape stairwell and are awaiting further orders.”
All of you are extremely sweet, incredibly kind, and caring people and I love you all from the bottom of my heart. I hope to have another chapter ready eventually, but this is it for now!
“What happened to your hands, Tony?” asks Steve, eyes wide with concern as he takes a step forward. Tony flinches and awkwardly moves his arm to place the bottle back on the table. Steve stops abruptly, and his eyes flicker towards the doors of the cupboard above the fridge which are still flung wide open.
