“Hurry up, John!” Was all he heard back.
“Accept the situation.” John said after the sparks stopped. “Right. One case. Doing what exactly?”
Watson crossed his arms. “You want the truth or something good?”
trying to dye my hair without telling me?”
Mrs. Carson turned. “Yes?”
Watson gathered the empty plates. “So no plans for a second date?” And headed to the sink to start the washing up.
Stamford smoothed the front of his suit and blew out a slow breath. “Okay.”
“Good.” Sherlock mused. “You missed the most important thing but overall somewhat good for a first try.”
John stared at him in disbelief. “She’s already killed two innocent people, you could be the next.”
Oh. God, “Yes.”
“Yes, now put it in” Sherlock urged him as if he was speaking to a child. Watson could feel his temper act up again. Although it hadn’t had much time to calm down. And he was supposed to be his new partner. Temporary partner. At this rate, they wouldn’t make it through the case. This was ridiculous, what was he doing here?
They stared at each other, both biting the inside of their cheeks to stop from saying anything else that could make things worse. But as shit as this situation was, John had to admit this was the most cooperation they had had since... well, their first case.
“Roger. Over. Party’s about to start boys.” Jones said taking off his silencer. Rolling his eyes, Neeson placed himself to open the door for Rogers and Jones. Watson kept watch in the corridor until they went in.
At least now they had a chance to stop Rebecca and save everyone. With another glance around the bar, John knew he could take her out easily, but he had to act fast. He turned to Bishop. “Is there any way Rebecca could be a real person trapped in a fictional character?”
“Yes Stamford, it’s done. We have a finale.”
They managed to get a run-through of the Date Song, with minimal criticism on Holmes’s part about the choice of a first date in an amusement parks. Their acting as they jumped apart at the end made Stamford laugh out loud, and was applauding before they had finished the song.

The left side wall was lined with half circle booths of what seemed like leather, one of which was filled with who they were looking for. John was blatantly reminded they were in black and white as he was blinded by a fat man in a white suit and hat, contrasting with the dark seats.
“Now we’re going to warm up the skin a bit, get the blood flowing. Ready?”
John choked on his words. He was at the end of his wits. All he had were these army tags and he had no idea how they worked and wasn’t ‘feeling’ anything. What was he doing? This was ridiculous, how could he have blindly put his faith into artifacts like this and expect things to magically get better? Sherlock was right, he was an idiot. He could feel the blood soaking through his shirt, could see the cold sweat across Sherlock’s forehead. He closed his eye and bit the inside of his cheek. It was over; there was nothing else he could do. But
SHERLOCK
Holmes looked like he was having trouble breathing.
“The door is that way.”
BOYLE
“What is it doing in Plymouth?” Watson asked instead as he leaned against the half opened sliding door between the kitchen and the sitting room.
There was something about the way his name sounded on John’s lips that made Sherlock shiver.
Sherlock bit back a sharp intake of breath. Intrigued, she hunched over John’s thigh, her bony hip digging into the armrest as she gently brushed her fingers through the coarse hair. She hummed, fascinated by how vivid the color was on the dark hair and quickly reached for her flashlight for a closer examination. It was then she noticed the colour was only on the upper region, confirming John had been careful not to affect her vagina’s natural bacteria.
John cleared his throat, which seemed to snap Barnabas out of it. The man shook his head and readjusted himself in his seat.
“John?”
“If you have any questions…” It seemed like there was something else John wasn’t saying, but Sherlock couldn’t figure it out.
“What?”
“Didn’t need much help there.” Sherlock told John as he looked down to him. John stared back at him full force. He was very close to boiling point.
“I’m afraid that’s confidential.”
“No, Sherlock, this- this manuscript, its Anthony Bishop’s last manuscript.”
She whined as John’s mouth disappeared off her breast and kissed its way down. Sherlock opened her eyes and caught sight of John’s devilish stare, face half hidden by pubic hair. Just that sight made her moan and drop her head back. It was a small pause before Sherlock felt a broad tongue lick from the base of her labia to her clitoris, making her lose the last of her conscious mind.
“You really are enjoying this, aren’t you?” He muttered under his breath.
Sherlock’s eyes slowly moved to stare down at the shorter man, making a point of emphasising their height difference. “Are you already forgetting that you encountered your deceased teammate? We can’t risk killing them if there is any possibility of someone bringing them back to life. What do you think is going to happen then? The only way to prevent whatever they were trying to do from happening again is to keep them in the Warehouse.”
“Certainly sounds like Stamford.”
“Is he any good?”
Small nodded.
Holden turned to Holmes. “First time at the Grove?”
“You know, a spark.”
future.
Thank you so much for reading, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I have writing it.
As they came up to the director, Stamford widened his smile. “How do you do, Mr Morgan. Thank you again for agreeing to audition my candidate.”
Mrs Hudson turned to Holmes, looking in his eyes a moment before she nodded and let him help her up.
“Will you shut up?! I’m working on it!” John screamed towards the speaker, his voice sounding odd against the low beat.
“Because it is.” He answered softly, his face stricken with grief.
“No, oh dear no,” She chuckled and sipped her drink. “Stewart doesn’t come to your table. You go to his.”
“Brilliant.” Watson said without thinking.
feeling vulnerable, who was half naked, her hair ruffled and legs spread wide in the middle of their sitting room, was more concerned about Sherlock than herself. It was there, kneeling, her sensed filled with everything
Oh my God, is Rosa smiling? She never smiles.
Holmes straightened his bowtie in the mirror.
. He needed to forget about that. And paddles. And riding crops. Forget how it felt when—
“Why?” Watson asked.
“I’m surprised you don’t have an artifact for that.” John murmured quietly as he looked around, not really expecting an answer since he wouldn’t hear it anyway.
Amy’s shouting jars them into action. They start evacuating the museum. Jake stares at Amy.
“Apparently so.”
“How?”
“Fuck.” Watson groaned as he pulled his hair again. “I am so fucked.”
“Like I said, too proud to admit it.”
"Not every wooden object you can spin is a dredel. It's called a spinning top."
“I said no.”
“What was that… circus?”
“Please don’t tell me this case will give you the urge to start writing your own detective stories.”
Holmes was looking out the window when Watson walked into Stamford’s office.
Sherlock nodded.
Watson held his breath as Holmes watched her carefully and nodded.
Watson smiled to Holmes. “Yep, that works. Keep the jump. Now start from the top and improvise the song, do what feels in character, have fun with it. After we’ll see what we keep and where we integrate dancing.”
“I didn’t abandon them! I knew they would be fine.”
“Yes, I’m playing Edward.”
He blinked at her a few times as he remembered what she was referring to.
“Revenge is so predictable, wouldn’t you say John?” Sherlock commented with a glint in his eye. “Frankly, I don’t care about your motives, but I will care if you attempt to interfere with an ongoing investigation again.”
You’re the one who insisted to help.
Sherlock looks Amy up and down and sneers. He’s about to start speaking when Jake knocks on Amy’s window.
Not those.
Ms Hawkins turned to Ms Hooper who gave a shy wave.
Their booth was in a well-placed spot, with Lestrade a few tables over to keep an eye on them. The booth was close to the dance floor but far enough away to survey the room, which Ms Adler started doing as soon as the waiter left with their orders.
Pushing down his excitement, Holmes lead the way, the dark blue ornamented carpet muffled the sound of their footsteps. As if on cue, the crowd on the dance floor parted and let them slide in among them. Once they were in the centre, they started dancing as if it had all been choreographed.
“Mr Holmes.”
“Hm.” Ms Adler leaned closer to Holmes. “James Stewart is here.” She kept her voice low so they wouldn’t be overheard.
“Warehouse 3?”
“What look?” Watson asked.
“How did you disappear in Qatar?”
The stairs led to what looked like the break area, but at the far end was a storage space, filled with filling boxes, but there was also a stack of twelve brown boxes next to the racks.
Holmes shook his head, and was seething inside that he couldn’t tell. Her nonchalant reply didn’t help.
“Correct me if it is different in America, but in Police Standard Procedures, to close an investigation involving one or more dead bodies, autopsies aren’t a requirement, but bloodwork is. This means whoever is behind this managed to get this case closed without filing blood reports. They either have friends in high places, or a lot of money.” Holmes concluded with a glint in his eye. This investigation was turning out to be much more interesting than he was expecting.
“He got a phone call, and dusted out.” She whispered and leaned away, fiddling a bit with his tie before moving away to serve another patron.
Stamford chuckled and leaned closer to speak into the microphone too. “And have the crowd miss that precious stunned face of yours?”
“He... He used to be on my team. Well, my last team.”
Fine.
“I was in perfect control of the situation.”
“Sher- Fuck, I- I’m-” John’s words were lost as her body tensed, eyes squeezed shut before a long guttural moan filled the room.
“Making sure you didn’t botch the job?” Morgan told Watson.
“Hopefully, it will be.” Stamford replied with a tight smile. “We’ll be down at the studio.”
“Thank you everyone for being here, it’s rare we get the cast included in production meetings, which is why we had to do it in the evening.” Stamford smiled widely. “Ms Hawkins, if you please.”
After a loud intake of breath, John moaned loudly, bucking into Sherlock’s hand, pushing the finger in as far as she indirectly could. “Yesss. Yes, yes, yes, oh my god, please, don’t stop, don’t you dare stop, Sherlock, fuck, yes.”
“Yes. Well, they gave me LSD, besides that I’m fine. You?”
“Bullshit, you’re blackmailing me!”
“You’re seriously not going to admit it?” John asked, trying not to think why he wanted to rub it in so much.
“You were thinking. Loudly.”
BOYLE
Thank you to the extraordinary Zala for filming, stage directions and helping us with choreography, not to mention how you are a wonderful joyous person. Thank you again for listening to me while I freaked out about how the hell we were going to pull this off. I hope you can make it to the next retreat!
This time Anderson looked like a smiling wall, making the overall effect even more awkward. Stamford arrived into the studio then, with Ms Hooper at his side, the two of them talking in hushed tones and quietly sat in their assigned chairs behind Morgan. By the time they reached the side by side, Anderson tripped and almost hit Ms Adler in the face.
John looks at Sherlock with a frown, looks up at the cabin, at Chester, then back at Sherlock.
Three days.
Be nice. And try to eat something else before your shift.
Watson frowned. “What are those for?”
Everyone answered yes.
BOYLE
“Why not?”
Stamford looked at Holmes from head to toe. “Why should I trust you?”
Anderson took three deep breaths and focused on the music, which helped, but when they made it to the side by side sequence, he had to look away from Ms Adler. He ended up staring directly at Morgan, which caused him to trip and fall.
walked in Beethoven’s shoes on your first day.” John’s eyebrows shot up at the mitigated description of yesterday’s events but chose not to argue. “How do you like being an agent so far?” Mycroft added.
John’s expression turned from confusion to surprise, rapidly followed by concern when he saw at the empty table.
“Following possible suspect. Moved north in the west corridor, turned left, and then took the first door on the left. Proceeding to intercept.” Before he could hear his commanding officer protest, he took the earpiece out so he could hear everything as he inched his way to the door. The man had to be in there, there was nowhere else to go. About six feet away from the door, Watson felt a hand grab the back of his vest and pull him back before a trap door opened exactly where he had been standing.
“Sometimes I do, but it… It takes a toll on you; the long hours, always dealing with criminals, murderers.”
Stamford puffed out his chest. “How dare you break into my set? Who do you think you are? Explain yourself!”
a GPS.” The woman added.
He reached for his phone.
Murray looked at the clock then and smiled. He reached out his hand to Small who reluctantly handed him money.
Sherlock came closer and looked at the matchbook. “Carson owns a Hotel?”
Watson closed the invoice filing box, grabbed a star paper box and followed Holmes downstairs. They heard the front door open and close about halfway down the stairs.
The first thing Holmes noticed when he regained consciousness was the strain on his shoulders and neck. It was only when he tried to move that he opened his eyes. His pupils slowly adjusted to the light, confirming what he felt: Holmes was tied to a wooden chair, hands behind his back, ankles secured to the legs of the chair, and additional rope across his torso. He looked around; there was a light hung above his head creating a cone of light around him, tracing a defined circle on the floor that reached a few feet around him. He couldn’t see the walls of the room, so Holmes tried to make enough noise to get a sense of the size of the room without speaking up. The echo it created was so vast that Holmes had to admit he was lost. He tried closing his eyes and concentrating on the smell, whatever noises he could hear. All he had was dead silence and concrete. There was no way to tell where he was and how long he’d been out.
Sherlock was sitting on the experiment table, his legs hanging off the edge, his blood soaked shirt in a plastic bag behind him. “I could just hide the tags.”
He stared at the black door apprehensively.
“What? Why?” Sherlock asked with a frown.
“Shit!” John swore as stood to pace around the office. “Shit shit shit!” He continued, kicking one of the chairs around the table which tumbled loudly across the room.
“The road? Where are we going?”
That explained John’s comment about recklessness.
“I believe you just dropped your cane to run after and interrogate a drug addict in need of a fix,” Homes replied.
Well, Holt call me to his office and asked me to help get Holmes and Watson to admit their love to each other.
John’s eyes snapped open, listening intently.
They both jumped when a young man knocked on the driver window.
That got Sherlock to grimace before explaining further. “It was in the south of Moscow when we started tracing it. Then it moved to London. Those are the only tangible facts we have. There are two possible explanations; someone just so happened to touch it soon after we had traced it and it just so happened to move to London.”He tried to keep his voice low while they made their way back around to the booth so John could try spotting it again.
John’s eyes grow soft.
Sherlock waited until she heard the front door close before she jumped up off the couch and raced to the window to watch John walk away, shoulders hunched, head low.
For the case. Of course.
How is that even possible? The sexual tension between those two is so thick you could use it as butter for that sweet sex cake they’re gonna enjoy together.
Small nodded, looking relieved.
“It’s worse than Bishop’s title.” Sherlock sat on the window sill.
Holmes chuckled derisively.
“You just love bragging about that, don’t you?”
“Deactivate voice command.” John stated clearly and waited for the confirmation before turning to Sherlock. “What are you looking for?”
he read. There was a handwritten note underlining it that said ‘
“Why?”
Jake, Amy, Boyle, and Lestrade are all lined up along the edge of the barge as Rosa and Holt ride in on the speedboat.
“Good.” John let go of Sherlock and took a step back.
“It’s not a risk if Holmes is in it.” Ms Adler argued.
“Where were you the night of February 3rd?” Lestrade asked.
John coughed and gave his partner a stern look before turning too Ms. Abbott. “What’s the name of your friend?”
Hoping to see him again? It was one thing to read it on John’s blog. It was another to get an outright admission.
“Do you believe any of them could do something like this?”
“I followed a suspect and protected him from the guards so I had a suspect to bring back. I got the artefact to bring back as well. That and he said he wouldn’t leave without it, so given the situation it was faster to take it and get out.” And it had taken him barely two minutes with his hands tied, the brilliant bastard. He inwardly cringed when he realised it was the second time he’d complemented him. “Then I used him to get us out quickly so we wouldn’t miss the helicopter.”
The sound of the fridge opening and closing halted Sherlock’s train of thought. He straightened and saw John put two slices of bread into the toaster.
“As simple as that?”
“Does it matter?”
Watson took a step to the left, looking at a separate, much smaller group of paper clippings and pictures. “What’s that section?”
“What are you doing?” Sherlock questioned, his attention still on the screens. John stopped moving and breathed slowly before turning.
Thank God.
What? Boyle, no. Not you too? God, what is wrong with everyone? It’s as if the case doesn’t matter.
Okay, not as cool as I expected, but still pretty cool for something so boring.
“There were days where,” Ms Hooper said, her soft voice filling in the awkward silence. “We’d stop shooting early because Morgan said so.”
Stay focused on the target.
A loud cough came from the back of the room.
“Fuck!”
“Someone went through the trouble of letting us know about the GPS. If they’re using this particular artifact, then the message is most likely a location. Hence, the invitation.”
“I like what you hear.” John watched as the woman eyed him from head to toe and flashed him a smile.
“I save your life and this is how you repay me? You’re a doctor, you should have a minimal amount of brain function to understand that when someone saves your life they aren’t a threat.” Tall and dark said, insulted. Watson couldn’t believe what he was dealing with. As if he would just let him do whatever the hell he was about to do. It was clear he was using the explosion as a distraction to take care of a personal agenda.
“So where do we start?” John repeated.
But that didn’t mean Watson didn’t want to punch Holmes sometimes.
“What do you mean?”
A derisive snort came from behind the paper. Stamford and Lestrade exchanged knowing smiles.
It suddenly hit Watson: he was the director now. He had been so focused on Holmes the night before, and again this morning, that he hadn’t had a chance to let it sink in. And now here he was, eyes wide as everyone looked at him, waiting for his first morning pep talk.
Somehow, Watson’s eyes closed on their own around seven. He woke with a start when he heard the office door open around eight. Watson slowly sat up to greet Stamford and froze mid-movement when he saw Holmes, alone.
“There are rumors of objects with special properties.”
“That’s it.” Sherlock whispered to himself, his eyes wide, scanning something only he could see. “That must be it, there’s no other way.”
“I’ll be fine.” She waved offhandedly. “Not the first time he’s passed out after drinking.”
Barnabas smiled at him. “What motivates any man? Greed.”
. He had no clue that after they had last seen each other, John didn’t care anymore. He didn’t have anything left to lose...
“It was staged stunt.”
“You have helped plenty in the past two days. Take a few days off. This isn’t over, but you have to be patient.” Mycroft told the new agent. “I’ll leave you now. Good evening.” He concluded as he stood. “Agent Watson, Agent Holmes” He nodded, walking towards the elevator.
SHERLOCK
“Are you alright?”
Holmes nodded.
Ugh. Fine. Just hurry up.
Come on.
“Wanker,” Watson muttered to himself and followed him in.
“Evening, gentlemen,” Lestrade told Stamford and Watson as he stepped in and frowned. “Holmes isn’t here?”
“John-”
He hit send before he could change his mind.
Sherlock rolled her eyes as she stood and made her way around the table. “Hazard warning? John, please, madder isn’t hazardous.”
Moriarty was staring at Holmes with an odd look in his eye. “So, yes or no?”
“I hope I’m not disturbing you, sir.”
“What’s the plan?” John asked, turning around to face them. Mycroft eyed his brother before speaking.
“Just as simple as that?”
“Now. Give me one good reason why I should even consider letting you grab what you came here for.” He wasn’t prepared for the man to smile.
Lestrade looked from John to Sherlock a few times, then leaned his elbows on his desk.
But we can help.
If it hadn’t been for Holmes and Ms Adler cutting in every time Watson was about to say something rude, he would have ruined the movie before it came out.
“Now now, play nice with the new kid in town,” Irene replied with a wink. “Meet Sigerson Holmes, my new co-star.”
Watson shrugged. “I’m not sure how to explain it. The audition, your performance, it helped me see Edward. You brought him to life and all of a sudden I could… I just saw Edward. And then Ms Adler joined you and there they both were, Edward and Jane. I got home that night and, well, you had given such a good performance, I was, um, curious to read your comments.”
“New and eager to invest.” Irene added.
Small shrugged.
Ms Hooper turned to Ms Hawkins, who nodded.
“You’ve been at it for five years, what could I possibly find that you haven’t?”
Molly’s high voice, though soft, felt like it popped the invisible bubble surrounding them. And with it, the input all came back in a rush, like a bucket of cold water.
“Oi, you could’ve gotten stabbed too. And nobody could’ve known about the clock.” John answered, more offended than he should be, but losing his hearing had kind of freaked him out. “And don’t you have an artifact detector or something?”
Jealous?
“Sherlock.” John warned.
Holmes seemed deeply moved. “Morgan, I-I-”
John’s arms tightened around Sherlock as he nuzzled and tongued the crook of his neck. It made shivers run up and down Sherlock’s back. He squirmed and moaned until John bit down.
“What is it now?”
Right, sorry.
“Come on, go show off,” Watson whispered instead.
Ms Hooper looked up at Holmes worriedly. He looked down at her and mouthed
“Oh. Yes. But not significantly.”
Stamford eyed Watson. “A friend of a friend.”
“I said: identify yourself.”
“Here, let me just…” Lestrade walked over to the studio lights lever and switched it on. The metal clanged loudly, shortly followed by a buzzing as all the work lights flickered to life across the room.
The sun had set about an hour ago when they parked in front of Mrs. Carson’s residence. They walked up the stone path and knocked on the door.
It was at times like these when Holmes felt compelled to be a better man for Watson. With everything he had going through his mind, Watson still focused on others. His selflessness was honourable.
Charles, I don’t understand.
“Oh for god’s sake.” Sherlock answered in mock exasperation, but he was relieved by John’s teasing.
Faced with hard proof of Holmes’s mutual attraction, time slowed as Watson tried to keep his head clear. Tried to remind himself why this was a bad idea. Because they shouldn’t. Right? It would be a bad idea to have something happen with someone he already knew, not a stranger in an alley. Right? Then again, Watson didn’t need to be on set. He could avoid Holmes altogether if he needed to. Right?
By the way: I was wearing the army!John cosplay at the retreat while I read. *grin*
Holt pauses and blinks a few times.
“We say whammied by an artifact.”
The shorter man threw his head back, laughing with his whole body. He kept laughing every time he saw his partner’s shocked expression.
Two o’clock, rope display.
“Again,” he whispered, “But with more…” and looked directly at Holmes, “truth.”
“John, calm down, we aren’t suppose to talk about that mission, it’s off the record, remember.”
And yet as soon as Watson let himself give in, dipping down and capturing Holmes lips with his suddenly seemed so easy, he wondered why he had been holding back for this long.
“I thought you said you couldn’t make an artifact tracker because there’s no specific frequency for artifacts.” He began.
“Owner.” The man answered, his tone filled with pride, puffing up his chest at the tall man in the long coat staring intently at him.
Holmes listened to the sound of Stamford’s retreating footsteps and the gush of air as the door opened and closed. He flipped the script close, steepled his hands under his chin, closed his eyes and took a deep breath.
“When did this happen?” Stamford asked instead with a wide smile.
“Because it’s your fault.”
“Yeah, I can’t wait ‘til this is over.” Lestrade muttered to himself.
“Because that’s where it’s heading. We need to leave now or we’ll miss the train.” Sherlock said as he closed the lid of his computer. John walked to his chair with his tea and smiled. The agent may think he was an idiot, but John could tell Sherlock was dodging the question.
A small deliberate movement of Holmes’s hips caught Watson’s attention.
“Is it such a curious question?”
“Everything?”
But that’s the problem sir, they’re not together.
Anderson’s eyes followed her inside before his feet did. Neither Anderson nor Ms Riley noticed the rest of the crew watching as they worked.
LESTRADE
“Why?”
“You think I’m a suspect?”
.” Sherlock corrected as he held the clock at eye level and walked back to the counter.
SHERLOCK
Sherlock didn’t bother to answer and walked to a window, opening it and peering out before quickly closing it and turning to John.
The director sat up in his chair, and nodded when he was ready.
Holmes blinked a few times. “You mean the other night doesn’t count?”
“I’m fine. Thank you.”
He’s that good a detective, huh?
Lestrade snorted. “Whatever you need to tell yourself so you can sleep at night.”
“You been together long?” The question took Sherlock off guard and he didn’t know what answer would be most convincing considering the situation.
Small paused, looked to his right. “Moran.”
“Yes. Oh and um… I’m from London,” Holmes said, dropping his American accent.
No. Dismissed.
Ms Hawkins sat back, crossed her legs and arms. “Whenever you’re ready.”
Diaz just called. They have a name: Lance Turner.
John and Sherlock run through the kitchen. There are a few shouts of surprise coming from the staff. They head out a swing door that leads into the dining room.
“For that we need to know what was used and we need to actually have that artifact to neutralize it.”
“You aren’t even trying to find a way to catch the GPS?”
Stamford turned to Wiggins, who crossed his arms but spoke to Anderson. “Bit of nerves?”
“Shh.” Sherlock shushed with a wave of his hand, looked at his Farnsworth screen where John could see the user instructions. The agent took a breath and then spoke clearly. “Auxiliary.”
“What are you doing? This way!” Sherlock shouted at John as he saw him almost miss the turn.
Where are you going?
“The police said we should get it on Monday,” Stamford replied.
“Loss is a loose concept for a Warehouse agent.” Sherlock continued. “So does the event of your death affect me? Think of it as another case, only you’re looking for the artifact to fix it. But your life; clearly I don’t need to explain the value of your life.”
“Let’s make the universe regret it got involved!” And started laughing.
There was just so much crap crammed in there. It was like a bad game of spot the differences. He waited until the owner was busy talking to customers to get a better look.
“Are you ok? How’s your shoulder?” John frowned in concern as his hand hovered over the wound.
(to Gina)
They pushed Lennox away, making him sprawl on the floor as they each turned towards their opponents, their backs brushing one another as they prepared for the onslaught.
Sherlock is sitting at a table covered with books, newspapers and old maps. There are shelves of books behind Sherlock. A few books are removed and wee see Santiago peeking through, watching Sherlock. John arrives with two coffee cups and a bag of pastries. Amy ducks until he has passed her. John sets one coffee and pastry in front of Sherlock before sitting down. Sherlock pushes the pastry away.
It was only a question of time now before they released him. They had nothing suspicious on him, he was only guilty of ending up in the middle of a suspicious situation. Well, he had followed the man. Watson buried his face into his hands. It wasn’t what he would call one of his best instincts. That bastard. And what about this barometer? And why hadn’t he asked the man why he needed it? Why a barometer? Did it have to do with the artefact? That thing in a jar? How the hell could that thing be dangerous?
SHERLOCK
Because he was Sherlock Holmes, he always had the last word.
“You still want to keep going?” John asked as Sherlock writhed under a single finger.
Ms Hawkins smiled apologetically and shook her head. Stamford sighed and nodded to her.
“Ok. Where is it?”
They watched them film the next scene, and Watson was impressed by their performances. It was a simple scene, but their acting just elevated it.
“Ahhh!” John screamed as he grabbed his head, almost collapsing to the floor. Sherlock turned and grabbed him, holding him up as best he could.
“Pleasure to meet you.” Watson told her, his throat unusually tight as he straightened, almost feeling as if he should salute, choosing instead to fall into parade rest.
Even with the counter between them, it barely reduced the tension, the pull, between them.
John straightened, baffled. “It... I think it’s gone.”
Holmes checked his watch. “How long were we in there?”
“Appearing after coffee would also be appreciated.” John added under his breath.
Lestrade had the good sense to ask June to bring the employee files with her to the precinct. The payslips confirmed that Hank had worked the entire week leading up to each murder. Once more, Lestrade agreed suspiciously quickly with Sherlock that they should head to Hank’s flat immediately.
He took off his jacket and started unbuttoning his shirt as he paced the room.  He was going over what Ms Adler had just said when there was a knock on the door.
“You mean it’s not really there? It’s an illusion or a ghost or something?”
Sherlock’s breath caught in his throat as their eyes met. For the most part it was relief that John was choosing to stay, yet something stirred in his stomach at the idea of getting a physical.
John waited for the rest of the explanation until he remembered who he was dealing with. “How.” He asked patiently.
BOYLE
“Is he the author of those horrible crime novels you keep reading?”
Stamford turned to Ms Hooper.
“Although, I do have a request.” Holmes asked as Watson headed to the wine bottle on the table.
“What?”
“We also had a few sets that came in late. And, well…” Ms Hooper bit her lip and looked uncomfortable. “We ran out of film quite often.”
John paused briefly as if only now realising that was an option. “Too late now.” She shoved the hair dye into Sherlock’s chest. “Now get up.”
Watson chuckled. “What? You’re high on LSD right now?”
“Is everything all right?”
“Any news on Manning?” John asked, sipping his disappointing coffee as the train left the station. He had tried several times to ask Mycroft about it but all he ever got was a somewhat sympathetic smile and an evasive answer. John suspected Sherlock had his own investigation going on. He didn’t have any proof, but he was fairly certain Sherlock was doing it more out of spite at his brother than the actual puzzle. But John didn’t care for their race, stopping Manning was all that mattered.
Holmes raised his eyebrows, silently asking if he wanted to follow.
“Thank you. John.”
“And what did you do with it?”
“Why do you insist on being an arsehole all the time?”
“You did it again, didn’t you?”
“So let me get this straight.”
Still didn’t make sense.
“Right,” She replied breathily. “I’ll, uh, be right back.”
“Are you kidding me?” John’s voice was incredulous.
“I’m just saying we shouldn’t leave it just yet. You said it yourself, as soon as we started tracking it, it moved. So there’s a reason it’s here, right?” John didn’t know how, but he knew, just
The sound of the towboat motor changes, making both Sherlock and John jolt as the boat starts moving.
POLICE OFFICER
brought him back?”
Holmes looked down at him. “That just goes to show you how problematic the script is.”
While they silently waited, John tried to get Sherlock’s attention which was not working since he was pointedly looking anywhere but at him. It didn’t make sense to John. If his partner rationalised everything in here as fictional, then why would he insist John be the bearer of bad news.
If only John knew just how fine he was.
Lestrade leaned his elbows on his desk and took a long look at Sherlock. He didn’t look angry, which was a good thing, but he had this glint in his eye that Sherlock was weary of.
Ms Adler cut in. “Now, now, gentlemen,” she said, “We’re here for a nice relaxing dinner. You two can talk shop another time.”
Thank you to the wonderful @aquabelacqua for playing John Watson (That jumper!). I still can’t get over that grin. Kills me every time.
“Fine. We’re in.”
“Another member of your team, hum.” The agent deduced before turning back to the screens.
“I think he’s talking about Lilly Abbott, the dark curly haired woman from the office.”
of the explanation.
Still doesn't make me mentor material.
What’s a bff?
“What the hell is that?” Lestrade asked.
A few things happened simultaneously, and John noticed none of them. Sherlock’s eyes went wide, his mouth dropped open, and he found himself slipping off the door frame as the words registered.
Ms Adler turned to Morgan with her hands on her hips, clearly used to dealing with him in this state. “What is it, darling?”
“Neeson!” Watson screamed. Neeson was the closest to him.
“Stop the Warehouse from destroying the world.”
“I got some trouble the first day.” Sherlock answered evasively. John stayed silent for a moment, eating and looking around the room. He remembered the building adapted to the agents. He wondered if there was more than his room that had changed since he’d been here. Looking at the mess, the doctor guessed time must be a factor. Looking back at Sherlock, John considered this might be his last occasion to ask as many questions as he could.
The bell above the door rang, and like a frightened deer, Sherlock left.
“I assumed I’d never see him again after he took all of our money and ran off with that curly haired bitch.” She explained, or rather spat out while she stared out the window.
“You’re vocabulary is pitiful. I blame those silly murder novels you keep reading. They’re rotting your mind. And how can you not guess the plot?”
Sherlock smiled fondly. “Yeah, I’m good.”
“We’re going to Portugal.” Sherlock announced as he read the screen. “It looks like we have something to keep us busy while we wait for Manning to sneak out of his hole.” He told John with a glint in his eyes. “Come on.” He added as he stood and walked to get his coat. “The world needs to be saved, again.”
The merchants were still setting up as they made their way towards the last known location of the GPS: the Elvis memorabilia booth.
“We’re not exactly sure how. It goes back to Einstein, and E equals...” Sherlock trailed off as he looked at John’s irritated face. “Somehow, the matter that is in here” He said as he pointed to the glass jar containing the artefact from Qatar. “has just enough energy to move other matter, like you.” He finished as he pointed John who gave him a quizzical look.
“It was sold to a pawn shop. The address is in the file. Shouldn’t take you too long.” Mycroft added as he looked intently at his brother.
“Sounds like a trap.” John mused as he looked it over.
“What? Oh, no, well, I thought this might help ease your waking. Coffee is on the counter.” John’s eyebrows shot up, he turned to see a steaming coffee pot on the counter with milk and sugar next to it. He turned back to look at Sherlock.
Still drunk, and now in a post orgasm haze, Watson didn’t think twice about slipping his arm under Holmes’s head. Or how Holmes put an arm around Watson’s waist and pressed his head on his shoulder. Or how he smiled when he kissed Holmes on the top of his head.
Sherlock release John’s mouth in a gasp. “Ah!”
“Who are you and what are you doing here?”
“Yes, just to get us going.”
"My, no, before that artifact, before... It used to be lovely in here.” She summed, her eyes looking around the room. “Anyway, he was getting so out of hand that Mycroft insisted I go to my sister’s. It took the better part of three weeks until I could come back. And when I came up to see him, the flat had turned into the office.”
“Enough,” Morgan said dryly. “Let’s get this over with.”
Then why the hesitation? Sherlock wondered as his partner licked his lips nervously.
God, will you let it go?
SHERLOCK
Sherlock closed his eyes and spoke through clenched teeth.
Slowly, John relaxed against him, his body sinking deeper against Sherlock’s. Their bodies fit perfectly together. It was bliss.
“But you don’t deny it’s a possibility.”
“She was an Irish immigrant living in Chicago Illinois in 1879 who became famous for an incident involving a cow she was milking that kicked a lamp that started the Great Chicago Fire.”
Utter, sinful, bliss.
SHERLOCK
The information floored Holmes, so much so that he was at a loss as to how to proceed. But he was impressed this woman had managed a relationship with her assistant for what he could only assume was years, and make it work.
“What did he use to get you out of the research facility?”
“I saw him using his phone to open the door. If he worked there, he should have used his key card. He was after something.”
“God save me, I am,” Stamford admitted in a hushed tone and looked at Watson with worried eyes.
Tell me about it.
“Because I want to intercept the package
Holmes smiled to himself. “I have a few theories, but I believe what you said to defend her from Morgan may have played in our favour.”
Watson pursed his lips and slightly tilted his head to the side, but did not move.
“That would be the one, yes.” Mycroft cut in, standing by the desk, fiddling with his umbrella. John suppressed the urge to roll his eyes at yet another dramatic entrance.
“Yes. Now, as a Warehouse agent-” Only Watson cut him off.
“I wasn’t doing anything wrong.”
“It’s fine, you don’t have to, I was just offering.”
How about we help cover more ground? Jake and I can take bow, you can take stern--
look. The look faded away as he watched her walk up to the desk.
“Just admit you don’t know.”
“Yes, I can and I do.” Sherlock had had enough of the recruits constant nagging. “There is absolutely no way to touch it, even with an object. Unless there happens to be a bomb in that tool box, there is nothing life threatening here. Stay if you want, but I’m going back to the Warehouse.” He concluded, his tone final as he stared down at his partner.
SHERLOCK
John’s eyes flicked to Sherlock’s lips before licking her own.
The former soldier eyed the glowing elephant worriedly as Sherlock approached him and slammed the artifact onto the steel plate. If John had felt the effects previously, this was like a wave of electricity crashing around him.
Sherlock grabbed his soiled shirt and stood. He dropped it into the kitchen bin. He didn’t want anything that reminded him of the fantasy. An anomaly, that’s all this was. He had gotten carried away by the endorphin release caused by the pain. All he had to do was keep his focus on the case.
Turner cried like a baby.
BOYLE
What? No, Lestrade isn’t--
The hitch in John’s breath was louder than earlier.
SHERLOCK
“Mm, I
“Look, I know how it is to lose-”
John!
“About?”
John didn’t hesitate. “No.”
John still had trouble wrapping his head around the idea that death wasn’t a definitive state anymore. As much as he didn’t like the idea of trapping people alive, if they were as dangerous as Sherlock was saying, maybe this bronzing thing really was the best option.
BOYLE
Except you two--
“Cocaine.”
“The usual: married, two kids, gambling problems.” The tall man enumerated as his fingers fiddled with the wallet’s contents.
Watson pursed his lips, seeming a bit confused. “So, you and Ms Adler…”
“Joh-” He choked, cringing when he heard the Warehouse alarm system.
Scrolling through John’s blog didn’t help. It hadn’t been updated, but Sherlock read and reread everything, including the links that explained the dynamics of the Dom/Sub relationship.
John rolled his eyes even though Sherlock was right and tried another approach. “We’re...” He hesitated as his mind searched for the appropriate term. “Friends, right?” And yet that didn’t quite cover it. The work was the foundation of their relationship; if it hadn’t been for the Warehouse, they never would have met, let alone become partners and flatmates. There’s only so many times you can save someone’s life and still try to convince yourself you don’t care about them. And there are only so many times you can wank and try not to think of someone when you come and still consider that someone
“Well, I’m honoured.”
Lestrade stood. “It’s not standard procedure, but it should work.”
“Why are you telling me this?” he asked tiredly, taken at a loss to the relevance of what he was hearing.
What was he suppose to do now? Indefinite suspension. How was he supposed to occupy himself all day? It’s not like he had anyone to call. Harry had decided he was as well as dead when he had told her he was going into Special Forces in the army. She hated him when he enlisted. But this, to her, was like a death wish. It didn’t help that he told her at their mother’s funeral. So instead of worrying herself to death, he was already dead to her. At least that had been what she said after slapping him and leaving without ever speaking to him again. Maybe tomorrow he can find a way to expedite his reinstatement. The sooner the better. He closed his eyes, breathed slowly through his nose. Bullshit. All of it.
“Ms Hooper,” Stamford cut in, “I had no idea you were such a good actress.”
Jake gives Sherlock an angry glare. Sherlock rolls his eyes. Amy sits the teenager down on the chair next to her desk.
Why the long face? Did Holmes deduce the fanfiction you wrote about him after his death?
they shouldn’t leave. John was feeling the full force of Sherlock’s all seeing stare and didn’t move a muscle, determination present in every fiber of his being.
“Ready? And: five, six, seven, eight.”
“I’ve been doing this on my own long enough.” Sherlock told Mycroft at the same time.
“Nothing.”
“But it’s what you meant.” Sherlock countered. He rolled his eyes at having walked himself into a corner. The agent’s face was neutral but the soldier could see the glint of mischief in his eyes.
, that Sherlock finally understood she was in love with her.
“I’m going to whisper something in your ear, and you have to promise to keep looking like we’re flirting,” Ms Adler said in a low voice.
Even a blind person could tell you two are dancing around each other. You probably regretted not saying something when you thought he was dead, because I sure did. I should have run off with him. Eloped in the Caribbean. You got a second chance. Don’t waste it by playing it safe.
Holmes led her across the floor. “I always wanted to be a pirate.”
“There he is,” Stamford announced, squinting through the stage lights. “Ladies and Gentlemen, the star of The Dancing Bachelor, Sigerson Holmes.”
“Well dress me like a horse and call me Silver,” Wiggins exclaimed. “Sherlock Holmes, you’ve got some skills.” Wiggins leaned back in his chair then turned to Stamford. “To be honest, I’m not really surprised about Morgan, I mean Moriarty. He’s clearly the villain type, but Ms Hawkins, never saw that one coming.” Wiggins noticed Murray who had his head down and arms crossed. “Oh, I’m sorry Murray.”
“I’m just being friendly.” She said innocently, her eyes travelling from Sherlock to the experiment covered table.
“This means we’re losing our weekend.” Dimmock moaned.
Stamford shook his head. “We can’t reshoot the jump, not after what happened.”
Oh, God.
Screams of pain and running footsteps caught Holmes’s attention.
With a huff, Sherlock flopped onto his back. He didn’t have time for this; he had a case to solve. A case that involved returning to Il Bolero to finish interrogating the staff about the victims.
Who doesn’t know what?
SHERLOCK
“Alright.”
SHERLOCK
With a gasp, Sherlock thrusted back, pawing at John, licking his way into his mouth. He was so wound up that the slightest touch felt heightened. Which made being shoved against the door quite a surprise.
“I can drop you off at the A&E.” Lestrade offered.
“Of course not. But we have a piece of driftwood from the Titanic.”
“No, Mycroft’s minions are on it.”
Ms Hawkins raised an eyebrow. She turned Ms Hooper, who looked embarrassed but gave her a small nod. Ms Hawkins looked around the table; no one seemed to have any objections, besides Watson, but he wasn’t voicing them.
SHERLOCK
“That’s it?”
“As in?”
“Not very no.”
. Strong, intoxicating, delicious
“I went through Morgan’s filmography.” Holmes pointed to the posters on the wall. “Not only are most of his works plagiarism, but they all appeared in the last five years. I’m still waiting to hear back about his school records, but I wouldn’t be surprised if there aren’t any.”
“Such a knight in shining armour. I’m fine. What I mean is, this.” She waved around the room. “This business, you know it’s not just about talent. It’s also about information and knowing the right people. Sometimes, people do bad things, but what’s considered bad, well, it depends on the point of view.”
in the first place.”
Well. I was.
Do you know him?
“Good morning
“What’s that supposed to mean?” He took a step forward, eyes narrowed at his partner.
“Why whammied?” John asked since he didn’t have the time earlier.
“It was nothing,” Holmes lied, the stitches stinging constantly.
“Right, we’ll do until ‘
John’s hand let go of the counter and went up to her breast, her face contorted in frustration, flustered, as she attempted to give herself the push her body desperately needed. She opened her eyes and stared at Molly.
He took a moment to listen. Nothing he recognized, but it did sound good. John finally got out of bed to get dressed and head downstairs for a strong cup of tea. Or maybe coffee this morning.
“I’m more concerned that you don’t feel any sympathy for a woman who just lost her husband.”
The music started and this time the couple fell into the beat together, easing into the mood of the scene, their faces and bodies emoting the lovers coming together at last for their happily ever after.
The same reason I know Santiago doesn’t like your shirt. I observe.
They hadn’t heard Molly come in and didn’t seem to notice her as she stood there, unmoving, overwhelmed by her sudden elevated heartrate. She felt a blush creeping up her neck. She blinked a few times, attempting to breathe calmly through her nose, before realising her mouth had come open when John hissed with pleasure.
A little too seriously? Sergeant Jeffords I am disappointed by your attitude. You once claimed to love love. Where is that love now? Do you not want them to be happy? You don’t think they deserve their  chance at love? The same love you share with your family?
“So time stayed still while we were gone.” John said with difficulty, since his ribcage was constrained between Sherlock’s and the battery.
They were currently doing a walkthrough of the choreography to find their places on the set and mark them, figure out the camera angles, their light and such. Throughout the process, Holmes stayed focused, concentrated. His movements with Ms Adler were technical, precise. Afterward, Morgan discussed the scene with the leading couple. From what Watson could tell, Morgan was doing his bullshit ‘vision’ speech. Morgan’s large arm movements tipped Watson off, as well as the bored look in Ms Adler’s eyes.
Sherlock felt stunned into place. Of course John knew he was watching. But it still felt like he was staring directly at him.
It was almost seven thirty when Ms Hawkins raised the bullhorn. “Thank you everyone, that’s a wrap for today. Set change will begin in fifteen minutes.”
“John, meet Anthony Bishop.”
“That depends. Where does he live?”
Apparently I'm evil to cut here, but the next chapter will be quite worth the wait.
(See the end of the chapter for
His grip on Holmes’s hair tightened as Watson pressed his face into Holmes’s neck to smother his half groan half moans. He hadn’t shared an orgasm with someone in years, and this one was so intense he barely registered Holmes tensing in his arms, trembling as he tried to breath through his own orgasm.
Stamford looked lost. “But-but we’ve hired them before.”
John sounded exactly like a doctor instructing his patient to undress. It was giving Sherlock a false sense of security. After all, he wasn’t getting a physical but getting spanked. Then again, this was probably easier for John than giving prostate exams.
“Alright.” Sherlock conceded to his partner’s surprise.
Watson scoffed. “If I hadn’t been there to help you with Small, he would have gotten away.”
Bloody procedures. This was exactly why Sherlock worked as a private consultant.
She opened her mouth to speak but ended up nodding her head.
Alright, that’s enough.
“Well he has an odd way of showing it.”
“No, I’m fine. I might kip on the sofa anyway.” Sherlock said with a wave of his hand.
Amy leans her elbows on the table.
Watson stared at Holmes a moment. He had his hands in his coat pockets and was looking at the building. His face was barely lit, but his eyes caught the light, making them shine in the night. It would make Holmes seem mysterious if he didn’t look like a child in a candy store.
No. I asked him how long he’s been with Watson.
“John, you shouldn’t let your personal feelings-” Mycroft started but John cut him off.
“I’ve been better. Let’s go!” John answered, his eyes hard, and walked out of the room.
Up next, John's debut as a director and the Premiere! Woo!
Sherlock simply shrugged and followed John over to the next row, ignoring the shorter man’s aggravated look. The GPS was nowhere to be found. Without a word, Sherlock continued walking along the stands, eyes scanning. Grumbling to himself, John caught up with him and joined the search.
“Oh no, he was high as a kite when we found him. Took a few hours before he was sober enough to talk and explain his story.”
She started turning to head to the computer when John stopped her.
“Four.”
SHERLOCK
“Yes.”
You mean be myself?
“Yes, there is, or we wouldn’t be here.” John riposted without waiting for his partner to catch up. “You said it yourself, there is no way it moved here on its own at the exact moment we started a trace. It was told to do so. Maybe you can do it from a computer but you just need to be next to it. Send a stronger signal.” They slowed as they approached the booth, standing out of the way of the alley circulation but close enough for John to try spotting it.
Morgan sighed. “Mr Holmes?”
Ms Hooper nodded to Ms Adler and to Ms Kate. The later winked back, making Ms Hooper blush before disappearing behind the door.
Just go already.
“Who was that?” Sherlock interrogated. John’s mood darkened at the mention of their bomber.
“He’s good. He’s better than good. I can’t explain half of what he does, but he gets results. Fast.”
Jake nods. Amy’s hand drops away from Jake’s face to press her fingers to her ear.
A wide smile “Haven’t figured it out yet?”
“Sherlock-” He wanted to warn him, tell him something was off, that it was probably too much, but he never got the chance.
“Sherlock, you can’t be serious.” John protested in a hushed tone as he caught up. “Aren’t we going to miss Mrs. Carson if we leave?”
He spun around and standing in the doorway they had gone through to access the balcony, he saw the man that disappeared in Qatar.
That voice with the flipped up collar is like ten times scarier.
“Still working on it. Send your minions to get the owner. He’ll be waiting for you in his shop.” Sherlock finished and closed the metal lid and turned to John, ignoring his surprised look. “Warehouse.” He added and with a whirl of his coat, he walked out of the shop.
Fine, go with Santiago.
“Yes and no. We mainly intercept the artifacts that cause trouble.”
Stamford thanked her and quickly made his way offset as the crew went to work. The stage was flooded with people to get ready for the next day. Brushing off Ms Riley and Ms Louise, the lead actors stepped off the sound stage. Mr Anderson followed Ms Adler like a lapdog, while she ignored him. She was focused on her personal assistant, Ms Kate, waiting with a bottle of water by the camera. They spoke in a hushed tone as they walked to her dressing room. Anderson tried to follow them, but was stopped dead in his tracks by the door closing in his face. He looked over his shoulder at the seemingly uninterested crew, grumbled momentarily, and retreated in his own dressing room. A few laughs broke out as Anderson’s door closed, but it didn’t slow down their work.
But he couldn’t help but lift an eyebrow at the mention of mortal peril.
“Oh, my God, I was kidding Sherlock,” She cut her off, giggling, by covering Sherlock’s mouth with her hand. “yes, you can smell, okay?” She removed her hand and laid back down, still shaking her head and smiling.
“I know, but what if I had?”
“This is a date.”
John rubbed Sherlock’s back as he listened to John’s heartbeat and laboured breaths. It took Sherlock a moment to notice John was now trying to take off his clothes. Sherlock reluctantly unwrapped his arms and helped John pull off his shirt.
“Nope.” John confirmed.
Sherlock’s eyes snapped open when she realised what it was.
With a flash of red, John struck the Armor’s side with his axe as if it were a golf ball, knocking him off Sherlock. John kicked its weapon away before moving back to his injured partner.
“You’d be surprised how many people say that but don’t really mean it.”
Sherlock pulled back, finally getting a look at John’s cock. It was beautiful, a dark shade of red, twitching eagerly.
Sir, it’s been an hour. I need to talk to Holmes.
“Tell me, tell me.” Holmes registered he was back to his London accent, knowing it didn’t matter anymore but unable to explain why. “How horrible was it to wear the nurse uniform?”
Shrugging, John reached for a cup. He sat down in his chair, holding the warm drink as if it were the key to ending the lingering pain caused by the alcohol in his system. “Thanks.”
"Yes, but I just thought it still sort of looked like the office."
Stamford blinked a few times before answering. “They were dancing?”
Holmes stopped pacing and turned to Watson. “What?”
“But I just finished my hair.”
“Come over. Let you fill me— Let me fill you in on the case, and then decide if you want to help stop a murderer.”
“Look at you, pulling out all the stops,” Ms Adler grabbed Holmes’s hand as they met centre stage to bow.
John stepped forward. “John Watson.”
After waking up Lennox with a cold glass of water to the face, the three of them left for the club, stepping over the unconscious bodies in the corridor without giving them a second thought. Lennox got shoved in the back of their car and waited while they argued over who would drive. Sherlock won, making the drive a bit tense and silent except for the few turn indications their hostage was giving.
Holmes appeared in the doorway, and Watson’s fingers forgot how to work. He had been so concerned with Holmes’s reaction to the song that suddenly being alone with him felt terrifying, even though there was nowhere else in the world he’d rather be.
SHERLOCK
“Yes.”
“No!”
On the third day Sherlock realised she was reacting to John’s new odour.
Wilder chuckled, Small didn’t respond.
John hummed and squinted at a picture of the knots around the victim’s wrists. He shuffled through to the pictures of the knots on the ankles and looked concerned.
Bandage in hand, Watson moved back behind Holmes and let himself indulge. He used their reflection to imagine what they would look like together. He fought the building fantasy of what could happen in the small dressing room. Tried not to focus on how easy it would be -- so easy -- to lock the door. Bandage in hand, he willed himself to focus on his task, but when he looked down at Holmes, Watson had to fight the urge to slide his fingers along the skin of his neck, lean down and kiss him.
Holmes went to his mark, and after a beat jumped over the chair and landed it perfectly, looking terribly smug.
“Heard anything from Mycroft?” All he got was a short hard stare from Sherlock. That would be a no, then. Sherlock was about to go back to whatever he was reading on the screen, but John wasn’t going to stop there. “How about the artifact activity around the pawn shop area in the past two years, did anything pop up on the computer?” Sherlock sighed dramatically and was about to speak when his gaze crossed John’s icy stare, daring him to do anything other than giving him an honest answer.
Holmes’s voice was almost hoarse. “Just say the word and I stop.”
There was something about how Moriarty said this that sent chills down Holmes’s spine. All of a sudden, he was back in his hotel room staring at the picture of Morgan asking himself exactly the same thing he was right this moment.
She patted his arm. “I know.”
Ms Adler looked Holmes up and down slowly. “You sure know how to pick ‘em, Mike.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Anyway, I can't believe it's over! This was a crazy story but such a thrill to write. I love these characters with all my heart and it was a joy to imagine them try to work together. I hope you had as much fun reading as I did dreaming up this crazy universe.
The surprised expression changed to a devilish smile as her hands twisted the leather, making Sherlock move from his outstretched position to standing straight, his hands in front of him as if bound together at the wrists, confirming John’s suspicion about her intentions.
“I’m usually already gone before the set changes,” Holmes said offhandedly but looked very interested in the crew’s methods.
“Not exactly.”
For this chapter, it helps to know of some basics on nautical terms.
“No hands.”
“Agent. Please. He’s a doctor and a soldier, I don’t know what the Warehouse is thinking.” John breathed slowly through his nose so he wouldn’t permanently imprint his badge into Sherlock’s face. He pocketed it, sniffing loudly as he stared at Sherlock. Mycroft smiled tightly before taking out the same phone model as the one he’d seen Sherlock use in Qatar.
Stamford sighed. “Can’t you just dumb down the choreography for him?”
But the fat man was no longer in his booth. Sherlock grabbed the nearest waitress that fought not to glare at him for almost dropping her tray.
“And how’s that coming along?”
“I’m fine.”
She brought them into the sitting room and offered them a drink. Sherlock silently refused and walked around the room, inspecting everything; John thanked her and asked for whiskey.
“Oh no, it’s much more than that. They need the studio to keep running to be able to...” His words trailed off as Holmes approached the bookshelf next to Watson’s desk, and started looking through the row of scripts.
Holmes sighed. “Sorry, I don’t mean to… it’s just…”
John scrambled to take out the paper Sherlock had given him, carefully unfolding it and reading aloud, reminding himself to ask where these led when this was over. He waited as the GPS processed the coordinates, fidgeting, looking from the screen to the sphere.
Even if it made him a mess inside after each take, Watson enjoyed asking Holmes to do it again, and again. Just as with Ms Adler, spotting the differences in his performance from one shot to the next was fascinating.
“No, silly. Each one is different. Take this chess set, let me see here, it belonged to Alexander Alekhine, no idea who that was, ask Sherlock. So, all we need to do is move a piece every few days.”
“There it is.” Wiggins crossed his arms.
“Why did you come back?”
“There was Phosphoryl Chloride and Diethylamine in the trucks. They are both used in the chemical synthesis process. It’s a highly controversial discovery in the chemistry field, especially with the ongoing military experiments. But it’s not on the black market yet. If they manage to successfully manufacture it and distribute, they could make a fortune.”
“Nice turtleneck.” Lestrade commented without any prompting. “You look like shit.”
“Fine.” John answered as he looked up. Their eyes met and John couldn’t help but laugh. “That was the most ridiculous thing that has ever happened to me.”
“What proof do you have?” Watson asked while Stamford tried to calm himself with another drink.
Sherlock slides over the hood of the car and continues running as if he didn’t just almost get hit by a car. A shorter man with blond-ish hair, JOHN WATSON, runs in front of Jake’s car, mouths ‘sorry’ to Jake and Rosa before catching up with Sherlock.
“It’s not what you think. Give it to me.”
Do you know her?
A shiver went down Sherlock’s spine at the memory. The pain had been so intense, but the calm that overtook him had been such a rush. Would he be able to recreate the effect himself? Hm. If John wasn’t there it didn’t seem so… enticing.
With his lightweight weapon held in front of him, the agent’s right hand held onto the hilt as his left grabbed the carved sheath and slowly revealed the crucible steel blade. A high pitched sound echoed like a battle cry, warning its opponents it was ready to fight. The curved blade seemed to glow in the darkly lit area. Sherlock smiled dangerously at his opponent as he felt the artifact tingle in his hand, its excitement and lust for blood contagious as its power spread up his arms.
“What if I jumped over the fence?”
John shook his head, but he was smiling. “You’re a madman, you know that?”
It’s not that simple.
“God this is tedious. It’s taking too long.” John heard Sherlock whine as he came into the office, walking over to the fridge to put the milk away.
“Didn’t you read John’s file?” Mycroft raised an eyebrow at the agent.
Sherlock tsked and rolled her eyes.
“What?” Sherlock almost barked at her.
Sherlock schooled his features as he stood and prepared himself for the onslaught of questions. “About what specifically?”
Holmes felt like this was it, this was the moment he had been working for all night. Ms Adler would finally talk about the plan. He bit back his excitement and made himself look concerned.
“How? I’ve never died my hair before.”
Instead, he smiled and raised his glass. “Deal.”
SHERLOCK
“Yes, chapter 12 in the manual.” Sherlock started when he remembered. “Oh right. The Caretaker is the agent who has a form of symbiotic connection to the current incarnation of the Warehouse. The link the Caretaker has with the Warehouse permits them to search actively through inventory, sense when the Warehouse is in trouble, and above all be a living body for the Warehouse’s soul to share.”
Her mouth snapped shut and with a last look at the agents she turned and walked through the drape covered archway into the main room. Even thought it was empty and devoid of color, the room still felt warm and welcoming. It was large with pale gray walls and white drapes on the windows and archways separating the areas with a few potted shrubberies scattered in key places. There was a stage big enough to fit a five person orchestra, with a polished hardwood dance floor in front of it, surrounded by small tables with candles. The bar was on the opposite side of the room; high glass shelves lined with bottles of alcohol that shined in the backlight. As they walked past the bar, the barman gave them the stink eye as he rubbed the glass in his hands.
“Good. Now dye my bloody hair.”
He’s right. We need Boyle.
So, accidentally seeing John naked would be acceptable, right?
“In case something happened.”
, I mean… have you gone mad?”
“It freezes time over a limited area for 47 seconds. Plenty of time to take back the artefact and get out of there.”
“What’s stored here exactly?” He asked as he followed him to what he could only describe as the oddest golf kart he had ever seen. It looked as if it had merged with a roller coaster cart with the ramp that would normally be used to hold them in place, only now it just went from one side to the other like a dashboard. Only the dashboard was a 3’’ copper tube.
By the time Holmes and Ms Adler moved on to the fourth journalist, who asked almost the same questions as the previous three, the red carpet was full of the cast and crew.
John's eyes widened momentarily.
“Yes.”
“Holmes, how about you? Changing directors halfway through your first gig?”
Sherlock turned; John’s breath catching as he locked eyes with him and shook his head.
It really was like arguing with an oversized child. “It doesn’t even bother you that someone figured it out before you did?”
This is gonna be great.
“I know. Even I’m a bit surprised,” Lestrade said to Watson’s astonished look.
“Well, you’ve probably had access to my file. Even Mrs. Hudson knows how I take my tea. So I’d like a little background info.”
John struggles and tries to shake away the hand that is taking off his headset. Suddenly John is released. He turns around, ready to fight, and sees Sherlock smashing the headset.
Jake--
A bit of hacking led to John’s military file. It confirmed Sherlock’s deductions about John being an Army doctor, but he couldn’t have guessed John was a Captain. Impressive. Discharged after getting shot in the left shoulder. Hm. Why wouldn’t John try to find work in a clinic? Was his need for an adrenaline driven lifestyle that substantial?
“Tomorrow’s Finale dress rehearsal.” She replied. “Moran, where are we on the set?”
He was rather disappointed to find Lestrade there instead.
John paused.
“Admit it. You’re out of shape.”
“It was. Truly.” Watson was unable to look up, eyes focused on the condensation on his glass.
“Okay, well, you’ve got that one in…” Dimmock looked at the clock on the wall and was taken aback. “An hour. You learned it in an hour. Okay. Well. Uh, do you want to try the date song?”
“Then what?”
“And what if she did?” Holmes asked.
“What’s on for this afternoon?” Watson asked.
John snorted incredulously. “What, like the Warehouse has a surgery?”
Oh, of course.
“Follow me.” The man stood up and tied his suit jacket.
Watson finished cutting him free and helped him stand. Holmes didn’t stop himself from taking the time to feel the fabric of Watson’s clothes, the warmth underneath as he leaned against Watson for support and balance. Holmes hid his face in the crook of Watson’s neck, moaning angrily against the fabric of his turtleneck, wrestling it aside with his nose to taste Watson’s skin once more.
Stamford turned to Watson, who shook his head and grabbed his cane.
If you don’t bother making an effort for yourself, why would you make one for someone else?
Lestrade drives off. Rosa pulls up with the police officer in the passenger seat.
“That probably won’t change.”
John inhales as if to speak, takes a step towards Sherlock when there’s a loud crash to his left. Everyone turns to see Scully staring at a puddle of coffee and broken mug pieces on the floor at his feet.
Watson looked over his shoulder. “Are you worried I won’t let you go to the infirmary if you’ve taken something?”
“How many partners?”
Sherlock’s eye’s flickered towards John. “You can go whenever you please, I’ll be at the Warehouse.”
She continued. “You already know the story, the songs, the choreography, the characters-”
“If I let you do this, and that’s a big if, you do it with your hands tied. You have two minutes. I keep the artefact, and I take you back to HQ.” The man was about to say something when Watson added “This is not a negotiation. You said it yourself Houdini, you can do everything with your hands tied.” The man looked at Watson intently before silently nodding his consent. “Right then. You have two minutes and we have a chopper waiting. Oh and you try anything, you get the gag.” The man rolled his eyes as he stood up.
Damn.
Mrs Hudson took a long drag on her cigarette and looked at Watson, who tried not to look as panicked as he felt.
.” Bishop thought out loud.
“I can’t take all the credit for catching the GPS.”
“Did you even sleep?”
“The energy is unique to each artifact, there’s no general wavelength for artifacts like radioactivity. And they’re part organic, so basically any human could be detected in some way. Just always handle old objects with gloves. Some artifacts even have a distance to stand away from.” Sherlock said with an air of superiority.
Amy discreetly takes out her phone.
He left.
“And you’ll transfer me back without any protests, restore my reputation and never bother me again?” John looked intently at Mycroft who kept his enigmatic look.
What do you think? Cleaning up your mess.
She stared at John’s lips a long moment before meeting her eyes. Sherlock’s voice lower than usual, and much coarser.
What is it even supposed to be?
As they stepped into the Warehouse, John blinked a few times as his eyes adapted to the return of color, which was comforting in a sense. He was relieved to be back and pleased to see he was wearing the battery pack and still holding the elephant.
Sherlock had deemed the tags intriguing, but useless since he couldn’t use them. Never would he have guessed that someone would one day try to use them on him and
As they stepped out of the cab, Sherlock directed his gaze across the street from King’s Cross, and flipped up his collar. They turned, looking around without speaking, for anything out of place, any trace of surveillance besides CCTV. They entered the tube station, moving slowly through the crowd.
“Yes, just going over the scene.” Watson looked down at the script on his thighs and pushed down the urge to find and strangle Moriarty with his bare hands.
It was considerate of John to remind Sherlock the evening was about him, and what he wanted. But Sherlock still wanted to see when John would stop being nice and let the Dom in him take over.
“Over here, dear.” Mrs. Hudson called back, her voice close to him. He walked down two more rows when he finally saw her a few feet down, purple gloves contrasting with her yellow apron.
The next day.
John let the sound pop with her lips and kissed Sherlock deeply, both happy this was something they could do now.
“Distinct callous patterns between your index and thumb. But what I want to know is why the Warehouse chose you.”
Holmes stared him in the eye. “I’d rather
“To solve a murder.” Sherlock blurted out. “Multiple murders.”
“Guards!”
Watson hissed in a breath and closed his eyes to focus on the words, the melody. He shook his head and took a step back. “Oh no. No. This could not be worse timing.”
There were two quick knocks on the door before Ms Hooper appeared, carefully holding a tea tray that she put down on the desk.
“Why didn’t you say anything sooner?” Sherlock reproached.
“You’re suspended.” Watson spun around, shock painted on his face.
“Fine. Good. Perfect.”
“How do you do?” Williams replied, and nodded towards Ms Adler. “Aren’t you a lucky bastard.”
He looked up at Holmes who stared back at him, and after a beat they both burst out laughing.
He turned his head towards the sound of John’s voice, filling him with relief, hope and pride.
She had no idea how long it took, but when she risked going back to the lab with a new coffee, they were gone.
“No idea.” Her eyes widened suddenly. “She isn’t helping on a case, is she?”
“Tend to the artifacts. It’ll help take your mind off things.” She smiled knowingly.
“Right, sorry.”
Good to know.
Bollocks. Most people didn’t deserve the courtesy. Most people were awful, pathetic, lying, manipulative, and greedy. They were the ones who needed self control, who needed to adhere to social conventions.
But if it was true, John could tell it would bother Sherlock and was unimpressed by his high air. “So that’s it. You’re just going to avoid it altogether?”
John suddenly realised that the best way for Lilly to keep an eye on Carson would have been to seduce him. “When did he leave with her?”
Watson thought back to how he had started insulting Morgan to get his attention away from Ms Adler. He had used that tactic often when he was young, to protect his sister. Now, Watson had just been trying to protect her, protect everyone. It was easier if he was the victim of Morgan’s assault. He knew he could take it. Watson didn’t care what that wanker thought of him. He did however, care that Morgan might be behind all of this. He was the one upsetting Stamford and risking all their jobs.
“Seven.”
“And how did you escape?”
“Now?”
Watson woke around ten thirty, relieved to have finally slept more than three hours in a row. He made his way down to set to get coffee and pastries. They were setting up for the next scene when he walked in. He made his way to Angelo, grateful to not have to wait for it to brew.
God, I can’t wait for those two to get their heads out of their asses and kiss already. But it’s no use.
How was John managing to stay so calm and composed while looking at Sherlock as if he were his next meal?
John didn’t need to speak, his answer was loud and clear as he clenched his jaw and stared at Sherlock.
“Mind putting some aside for me?”
“You didn’t exactly give us a chance to do so.” Sherlock cut him off. “We hadn’t spoken a word when you called your guards on us, no matter how ineffective that was.”
She stared at Holmes. “You got all that from the script?”
To which John burst out laughing again, his arms holding his waist, head thrown back. Sherlock couldn’t help but smile at the sight. He wasn’t sure what was so funny, but it didn’t stop a pleased sensation from blooming inside of him like their evening at Angelo’s, knowing he was the cause of this brief joyful moment.
Stamford turned to him. “Which is?”
“A colleague.” Watson mocked.
“No, officially you aren’t involved in this investigation, remember? You weren’t even kidnapped,” Stamford replied. “You and Ms Adler should stay here to rehearse.”
Holmes looked down at her fondly. “Thank you Mrs Hudson.”
John’s eyes widened momentarily, followed by his legs stopping short. “You could hear that?”
“Whatever, get your arse back here before Jones messes up. Over.” Rogers answered. Then Watson heard a bit of a scuffle over the coms.
“I’ll drive.” Sherlock announced.
“I do admit,” Sherlock was looking anywhere but at John. “Your knowledge of pop culture can be useful.”
“Yes.” Sherlock replied before his brain could catch up with his mouth.
Bishop nodded. “Something happened. To her.” He shook his head. “It happened so fast.” He continued with emotion. “One day she was sick, and then she was gone. I threw myself into a new novel, wrote a few chapters, and then, well the story was wrong. My wife was all I could think about. I'd sit in front of my typewriter and close my eyes, and I'd imagine this world.” He lifted his head and looked around with a smile that didn’t reach his eyes. “Then one day I woke up and I was here.”
Stamford and Ms Hooper stood and clapped, the sound shaking Watson back into the moment. He quickly wiped the tears and stood to applaud with them. Wiggins and Dimmock joined Holmes and Ms Adler to bow, but Watson only had eyes for Holmes.
John started fibbing. “Well, you can never really know with artifacts-”
“Did he use the barometer?” John paused, thinking over the implications of the man’s question.
“Movement exercises?” Holmes asked as he joined Ms Hawkins in the centre of the studio, facing the mirror.
Holmes suddenly recognised what was happening. “You really need to learn to carry a notebook around.” He slipped a pen out of his inside jacket pocket, took out the contract and flipped it over.
The woman was waiting for them next to the stairs. “Come on now, haven’t got all night.”
“Your point?”
Sherlock pulled out a business card, white with his name printed in black capital letters in the centre. It had his number and address handwritten on the back.
“What are you?-” John started to ask but Sherlock made him turn away from him again. John looked over his shoulder to try and watch as best he could.
“Nope.” John said lightly, a dangerous smile on his face, the anger evident in his eyes.
“Or, maybe you prefer the couch? It will only take a few minutes. I just need to wash my hands first, you just sit wherever you feel more comfortable.”
It’s not stalking.
Jake rolls his eyes.
“Why am I the one getting scowled when this man is clearly not in his right mind?”
“That is complete and utter bullshit.” John spat back, only to feel his blood pressure rise and a heat wave surge through him. “Ok, ok, I’ll calm down.” He said as he tried to control his breathing, but the steadily rising temperature was making him pant.
“Barnabas.”
“I’ve seen civilians in the middle of live fire before. Some are brave, but you can see in their eyes that they’re scared. He wasn’t.”
“What did you do to the shampoo?”
Lestrade and Holmes waited for them at the stage door. Stamford wiped his forehead with his handkerchief and smoothed his suit before he turned to Holmes.
“25 seconds before cameras are back online. Go to the door on the east side wall. Target inside. Over.” Neeson and Watson took care of the civilians while Jones and Rogers went to the door. Watson stayed next to them, huddle along the north side wall, with his gun towards the door on the west side wall. Neeson checked the room for hidden surprises. Jones smiled while he walked to the east door with Rogers.
was Sherlock happy?
“It has come to my attention that the GPS has been tampered with.” Irene explained patiently. This got an instant reaction from Sherlock; he stood from his chair and silently walked to the door leading to the elevator. Halfway there he pointed to it, his back to the rest of the room.
He wasn’t expecting Sherlock to turn and walk away.
John leans close to Sherlock.
(The inspiration for this fic)
“You don’t like flying?” John turned to Sherlock.
“Because I saw you in the infirmary for the second time today and wanted to talk to you about that.”
“Notes,” Holmes replied calmly.
“Hm?”
“Yeah, yeah, I uh-” Watson turned to Stamford. “Do you have a pen?”
Watson, still leaning against the door, looked up when Holmes stopped in front of him, confused. “And where are you going?”
“Wanker.” He certainly wasn’t going to admit he almost did the first time. “So how long am I supposed to hold this thing anyway?” He asked, waving the makeshift GPS at Sherlock.
She paused, looked at him closer. Holmes panicked. He hadn’t expected her to offer, and the access was much too easy.
“It’s deplorable how the case turned out so disappointing. In my experience, serial killers are usually much cleverer. I once worked on a bombing case which took six days to find his bunker. Of course, it was rigged. Almost lost an arm.”
“How do you know all this?”
“And what exactly are you referring to this time?” Sherlock’s coat was flung over the chair in front of the warehouse computer before he moved to put the violin case on the cluttered experiment table.
“Your audition.”
“I beg your pardon.” Stamford sneered.
“I died!” The man spat back. “Don’t you remember? You were there. It was you who ordered us to go in there while you held back. You knew we‘d get caught, didn’t you?”
set him up to trip himself! Murderer. Mmmurderer.” Holmes repeated, taking the syllables and playing with them, finding himself fascinated with the movement of his mouth from one syllable to the other.
“Oh.” Looking over her shoulder apologetically. “Right, thanks.” And closed the door gently.
Too arousing it seemed. John needed to stop, or this would be over very quickly, which was not something Sherlock wanted.
Lestrade smirked. “But that’s not what happened?”
“She killed Carson.”
“No, of course not. But it was a possible side effect.”
“Like a private detective?” Stamford asked.
“Yup.”
John was about to lose his temper when it hit him how absolutely ridiculous the situation was and started laughing, soon followed by Sherlock.
“It’s a nice alternative when the spanking lasts a while. To give the hand a break, you know?”
“Why did you follow him?”
“You mean you stayed up all night writing?” Lestrade looked impressed.
What did you do?
John, he’s headed towards you.
“There are none.” Lestrade continued.
Sherlock crossed his arms and mumbled. “Haven’t seen it.”
“Without getting the vendor’s attention.”
“I didn’t say you weren’t an idiot, I’m just saying you have a certain set of aptitudes that made the accomplishments of the tasks a sure thing.”
To their surprise, a man approached, casting a shadow over the frosted glass. John was getting ready to explain their visit when something in the glass caught his eye. It wasn’t what was on the other side; it was a reflection of what was behind them.
Usually, when Sherlock was working on something, John had learned by now that it was better to just sit close by in case he needed anything; mostly a sounding board or throwing him a pen.
“That’s not what I said.” Sherlock answered drily as he eyed the soldier sideways.
SHERLOCK
“Don’t
“I’ll take my chances.” Bishop answered in a steady voice as he looked towards Lily with loving eyes.
John conceded. “Alright, what do I have to do?”
“The fire started from a lantern that fell in a bakery and spread to the other houses because of the strong winds and dry temperature. What’s that got to do with endless wonder?”
Not good.
“Do I look like a fucking sidekick?”
“About that,” Holmes smiled, “I don’t understand why he asks her out.”
Morgan growled and grabbed Ms Hawkins’s bullhorn. “Stop!”
BOYLE
Really Sherlock? A deduction two seconds after getting released? If you want to spend the night in jail so badly, just say so.
Ms Hawkins scoffed. “Which
But if the flat adapts to its inhabitants, why hadn’t it changed since he’d been here?
The internet led Sherlock to John’s blog, which contained a link to the
Dimmock looked surprised. “Oh. Great.”
“No, the GPS teleports, not you.”  Mycroft cleared up.
“You’re exaggerating.” Sherlock answered as he turned around to walk back into the office.
“Of course, why didn’t I think of that?” John retorted sarcastically.
“You want to learn? Spot it yourself.”
“Could you sound a little
Lestrade, Jake, and Amy all turns to see what Boyle is looking at.
Holmes pursed his lips. “A few, but nothing concrete. They won’t put anything into motion until principal photography starts. They need a bit of time to prepare.”

Everyone started speaking at the same time, making Watson dizzy, even more so when Stamford started hugged him again. Everyone except Holmes. He was staring at Watson very hard, enough to make Watson concerned.
SHERLOCK
to get you out?” John saw the man smile as he spoke his question.
John gripped his hair again. Sherlock expected John to thrust, only to be directed to move his head around instead, rubbing John’s cock all around his throat.
“Why?”
“Of course not.” Holmes smoothed his suit. “My methods are rational, I consider all-”
Irene or no Irene, it doesn’t change the fact that it’s been six weeks and John still didn’t feel like they were a team.
Slowly, the pain started to overtake him. Every input was tuned down, drowned out by the slow building burn on his arse. The pain was growing, yet Sherlock felt himself relax, letting everything wash away. Everything except John.
“I lost my earpiece. Can you see the target?” Watson yelled.
“Apparently since we’ve just ended a war, the public doesn’t want to see a movie that reminds them of it.”
“No, it’s atrocious.” Sherlock mumbled as he handed it back to John and walked to the other side of the desk to look through the drawers.
Boyle turns to Lestrade with a wide smile.
Either way, might as well enjoy it.
“Mmm, yes.” His brother said knowingly, examining the artifact before turning to John. “Well, it must have been quite a surprise to see your old team member.” Mycroft stated, his gaze narrowing on John’s.
“The drugs for one thing.”
“It’s in Brixton, you’ll have time to recuperate in the cab.”
“Don’t get me wrong, you were an obnoxious arsehole in Qatar and continue to be to this day.”
Watson shook his head as he stirred the sauce. “You still need to have enough energy to sing and dance tomorrow.”
Eyes wide and body tense from the overstimulation, Sherlock fought the urge to push John away. “J-John, I-”
“You’re welcome Sherlock.”
Thank you all for reading.
“When?” John repeated.
“Damn straight.” Wiggins muttered.
“I told you I was fine.” Sherlock repeated as he stood and got his coat.
“Yeah, it’s going good.”
“What do you want?”
Her eyes widened.
Holmes grabbed his trench coat. “There was never any
“And worse case?!”
Damn hard.
“We-” John started to take out his badge only to be cut off by his partner.
He smiled as the cab rolled into Covent Garden. As much as the place had changed over the years and had become filled with modern boutiques and cafes, the place still kept its old London feel. The streets that had led them to the market were filled with people, even though it was threatening to rain at any moment.
Nah, just tourists.
It was the most beautiful thing she had ever heard spoken by John; her name wrapped in a breathless moan.
John’s lust-filled growl fueled Sherlock’s desire.
“Because you can’t touch it.” Mycroft answered for his brother.
John took his hands off the counter. “Look, I’m sorry if I gave you the wrong impression yesterday, but I’m not for hire.”
John was exceptional.
“Fine.”
“Why is there fog? These are completely unrealistic meteorological conditions.” Sherlock mumbled.
“I’ve already said everything. I’m suspended. So either you reinstate me or leave.” Watson started to walk towards his room, not caring to watch them leave, when the man spoke.
Simultaneously, Sherlock had taken a step sideways from the force of John’s shove, making him evade the second assailant’s blow aimed at his own head. The senior agent grabbed his forearm and twisted it, making the man contort his shoulder in response. With a slight push down, the man moaned in pain and twisted his body in an attempt to lessen Sherlock’s grip, resulting in his head smashing into the wall, knocking him unconscious.
Holmes turned to look at her, as she had started squirming around in her seat, seemingly to get a better view past the columns.
Watson tilted his head to the side. Holmes was right, but Watson wasn’t going to concede so easily. “You mean like the last time you jumped over a ramp and smashed your face on the floor?”
“Yes.”
Sherlock smiled at his partner even if he already knew all of this. He was pleased that even though the man read rubbish stories and liked to punch people, he was still capable of intellectual thought, no matter how long it took him to do so.
On instinct, the soldier broke free and spun around, aiming his gun at whoever had grabbed him. Some part of him was expecting a guard, but when he saw the tall dark-haired man he had been following, he was taken aback. He was dressed in a crisp white shirt and tailored trousers and completely ignoring the gun being pointed at his chest. He was looking at the trap door and what seemed like a deep pit. Watson noted he hadn’t heard him come up behind him. His instinct was screaming at him that this man wasn’t a civilian, far from it.
“Look,” Lestrade straightened, “I know this is a very delicate situation, but I wouldn’t have brought it up if I didn’t think he was on to something.”
Without a warning, John punched the man right in the nose, causing his head to snap back as a gush of blood dripped down his chin and neck.
Thank you to @nautilicious for her beautiful soprano voice and for playing the fabulous Irene Adler (I know we can see her tattoos. Does it really matter? Those are awesome tattoos.). You picked up the choreography so quickly and nailed Irene/Jane, I could not have asked for a better partner to dance and sing with.
Stamford looked confused. “But didn’t you say she’d try to get you involved?”
continued. “Call HQ, they’ll send you a copy of my statement. I’ve repeated myself enough today.”
It was the worst moment to feel self-conscious. Sherlock wasn’t ashamed of his body, he had been naked with other people before, but he had never made a show of getting undressed. With a practiced movement, Sherlock took off his suit jacket, placing it over the back of the desk chair. He turned to face John, fingers shaking as he unbuttoned his cuffs.
“Ladies and gentlemen, it is with great pleasure that we have in our company tonight the cast and crew from Stamford Production’s upcoming movie: The Dancing Bachelor.” He paused for applause. “I’d like to invite Mr Stamford to come and say a few words.”
John continued to follow Sherlock through the streets, who was making a point of showing just how fast he could walk. When they stepped into the vendor’s room he was forced to slow down and to follow him through the crowded alleyways. They slowed when the booth was in eyesight. They hovered a few feet away, feigning to look at the clothes on the booth facing it.
“Amazing.”
“Just hold it for now.”
“How come?”
“We need to get you patched up first.”
With a cry, they lunged at each other, blades clinking as they attacked, parried and counter attacked. It didn’t take long before their blades hit and engaged, weighing each other’s strengths before pushing each other away with enough force to cause them to take a few steps back.
Is everything alright Captain?
“Aren’t you going to eat?”
He looked at John. “That was you going easy?”
“For goodness sake, is she ever in?” Murray shook his head. “Go get Watson!”
“Because with their candidate, they had control over the product. They could still make a flop, and seal Stamford Productions fate. But now, with my arrival and Watson’s latest rewrites, this movie has every reason to succeed. It would be almost impossible to make this movie fail without getting caught. They need to figure out how to make Stamford go bankrupt even though the movie is a success.”
“What was that?”
Watson crossed his arms. “Creative differences.”
“Sorry I didn’t call you back sooner.” John apologised, relieved the call hadn’t gone to voicemail.
“Sherlock.” John knew they didn’t have time for the long explanation, but he needed to at least understand what the hell they were about to do.
Time seemed to slow down as John watched his partner travel through the air and drop heavily on the floor.
“Coffee.”
“What the hell is going on?” Ms Adler said loud enough for Holmes to hear.
“Yes. I do what needs to be done.” He justified as he took the violin out of its case and dropped it into the goo, holding up his arm to protect his face from the sparks.
LESTRADE
“John shut up.” Stamford sighed. “I don’t care if he’s a bloke, I haven’t seen you this happy in years.”
Lestrade nodded. “And make what? Heroin?”
“I’m not blind John, have you seen your neck? I certainly saw his.”
“I’m driving.”
Sherlock heard himself gasp.
Even though John was a few inches taller than him, the force of his glare was making Sherlock feel small, jumbling his thoughts as he struggled to find where to start. It stretched the silence, eating away John’s patience rapidly, which made Sherlock blurt out the first true thing that came to mind.
Is this another one of those delightful ‘it came with the apartment’ items you keep thinking is a good thing?
“Nothing made me.” With a twist of his wrist, the monitors sprung back to life. “I made me.” Sherlock concluded, as much to himself as to John.
They didn’t speak as they walked, but Watson was smiling, and he knew Holmes was as well. They made it three blocks when Lestrade pulled up next to them with his car.
Stamford smiled and took the microphone. “Thank you sir.” He turned to the crowd. “Thank you everyone. I can’t tell you anything because we’re under police orders not to say anything until tomorrow’s press conference, but what I can tell you, is that tonight is a celebration night.”
“John! We have a ping!”
The screen display changed.
They found it twenty-seven minutes later near the entrance between a table cloth and a trashcan.
Sherlock pushes John into a booth. Jake comes out of the kitchen. John and Sherlock try to hide themselves with menus. Jake runs towards the exit. An angry cook comes out of the kitchen. He looks towards the exit, then towards the dining room. He sees Sherlock and John.
Her lips were over Sherlock’s clitoris and her chin was creating a pressure over Sherlock’s labia. She held her in place with one arm around her thigh as the other caressed her breast. It was incredible, yet Sherlock was starting to panic. She had never been this stimulated before, it was too much, too much. But John’s tongue never waivered, never paused, kept the rhythm and pressure steady. Sherlock opened her eyes and was awestruck by the sight of John eagerly eating her out, her skin flushed and a bit sweaty from the two orgasms she had given her. It had been so long since she had come with someone else in the room, much less someone touching her, much less John, that It was too much.
“Yes, stop worrying about it.”
The first assailant to hit the floor was the tallest who had tried to punch Sherlock and ended up going down face first, nearly missing Lennox who was attempting to crawl away from the brawl. The three other guards quickly followed suit, either unconscious or moaning in pain on the floor around the agents who had barely broken a sweat.
This has been a crazy ride, and I can't thank you all enough for reading and commenting along the way at every new chapter. How many times I went back to read through them to motivate myself to keep going.
“Our clothing, hair styles and the conveniently placed Chicago sign across the street.” Sherlock explained with a smirk.
Lestrade and Stamford looked at one another.
“Oh, I uh,” The question made Watson shake himself, finding it ridiculous how he couldn’t stop staring at Holmes. “I saw Small talk to him and when they noticed me-”
Holmes downed his whiskey, holding the empty glass in his hands as he breathed through the burning sensation. Worry grew in Watson as he watched Holmes fill his glass and empty it again. Had he stumbled across something deeply personal? Watson was about to tell him he didn’t need to answer when Holmes looked up through his eyelashes, the piercing stare stunning him silent.
Are you kidding me? You’re the Sherlock Holmes. I have been studying your technique for years. It has helped me so many times that I should credit you in my case notes.
Ms Adler raised an eyebrow. “What do you mean?”
Sherlock and John run into the alley. There is a door on their left. Sherlock gets to it first and tries the handle. It’s unlocked. Sherlock holds the door open for John and follows him in. Jake runs into the alley just in time to see the door close.
Sherlock pulls his hand away from John’s chest and looks away. John sighs.
Sherlock wasn’t sure what was happening, but he obeyed.
“So you somehow found them and used them without having a clue what they do, all this just to save me?” Sherlock insisted, one part of him not quite believing what he was hearing, the other surprised that John had the guts to blindly trust his instincts.
Stamford held his head in his hands. “Magnussen was right; I am cursed.”
. It was overflowing her senses, Sherlock had to mentally slap herself to pull back a bit so she wouldn’t start moaning and rubbing her face between John’s legs. If she went any further she wouldn’t be able to stop. She paused and looked up, doubting once more. She had to know for sure. She couldn’t bear to lose John, not now, not after this, how could she after knowing
Watson huffed, but he was pleased to hear it. He turned to the eagerly awaiting performers. “That was amazing.”
Morgan put his feet up on the table. “I’ll rewrite the script. Piece of cake.”
Sherlock knew he was lying, not just by his behaviour, but by the neat stack of paper by his typewriter. He didn’t insist. Instead he watched John trying to not look nervous as he carried the plates over to the table.
As Watson finished speaking, Holmes finished counting and slipped out of the truck, looking like he had not heard a single word Watson had said. They locked it up and as they got ready to sneak back out, they heard the sound of a motor approaching.
Please note this story is set about 2 years after S4 of Sherlock (or as I like to call it: what S4?), and was supposed to be set during S2 of B99 pre-Jake/Amy, but the storyline between Diaz and Pimento ended up in there, so uh, please ignore the timelines and go with it?
“Why don’t you just kill me?” John pleaded.
Holmes frowned, confused.
Frowning, John crouched by the third row on his left and reached for a wooden jewelry box. He didn’t question anything, simply opened it, let his hand search through the jewelry and grab the army dog tags. He passed the familiar chain around his neck and ran back.
Archie looked up and blinked owlishly, “Sorry, sir.”
They ate in silence for a moment, well, Holmes pushed his food around his plate. Digestion slowed down brainwork, and tonight he needed to be on high alert, not just with Ms Adler, but to manage the onslaught of information. Deductions about everyone kept popping into his head:
“I think it’s perfect for our line of work, it prevents any complications.” She paused, leaned in a bit closer. “And, well, to be honest, it’s nice, not to have to fight you off, all the time.”
“Was it?” Holmes insisted, jaw tight.
“Okay. But if you want to stop at any moment, just say so.”
“Why?”
John pursed his lips. “You can’t hire me to be your Dom.”
They all turned to Holmes.
Ms Hawkins rolled her eyes. “Quit your ass kissing, let’s meet the kid.”
“So, how is he?” Stamford asked when he appeared in the doorway.
“I-I’ll be right back, I need the washroom.” Holmes said as he shuffled out of the booth. He stood and hesitated, looking left and right.
“Holmes.” Stamford’s soft tone barely held back his anger.
“Oh, don’t be childish.”
John blinked a few times in an attempt to convince himself that whatever the hell he was looking at was really there. He didn’t know how to describe what he was witnessing other than a mean looking thunderstorm without the rain.
“Ready to sign the contract already?”
Suspect is ten feet from the main entrance.
“Obviously.”
“Oh no. Beethoven’s piano concerto no.5 was his last public appearance before he went deaf.” Sherlock said, his face grave. John didn’t like the face Sherlock was making.
Holmes and Ms Adler walked through the glass doors of The Ambassador Hotel, and into the lobby, Lestrade a few paces behind. It was decorated with cream walls with lush green carpeting, dark red couches, and padded chairs. The furniture was arranged into lounge areas in front of several large windows overlooking the terrace.
There’s a muffled sound, then a crash and the line goes dead.
They stared at each other, neither showing signs of backing down.
“Mrs. Hudson?” John called, his head popping around the corner.
The office/flat came to mind.
Sherlock looked away. “Please don’t.” Even if it was true, even if he was asking as a friend, John had no idea what he was getting into with this topic and Sherlock certainly wasn’t going to discuss it while they were in the middle of a case.
“I’m sorry, I must have misunderstood; you got me suspended?”
“Right. Good point.”
Ms Hawkins froze, eyes wide.
“John, stop trying to pretend you aren’t enjoying this, I can tell even in black and white.”
“No, it’s not. It’s rude.” John pointed out, deadpan.
“What?”
He kept mumbling encouragements to his partner as he checked his vitals, his brow furrowed with worry at the sight of his non responding pupils and paler than usual complexion. He shifted his shirt to look at the wound and his heart sank.
“How do you know?”
She slipped her hand up to his shoulder and nodded to their right. “The tall one with the dark blue velvet jacket, that’s James Stewart. He’s type cast as ‘the everyday man with real-life problems’.” She said with a mocking tone.
Lestrade chuckled.
That’s when he heard... nothing.
No. I’m cold.
Holmes frowned. “That’s unusual. No matter, they can run them now.”
Watson tightened his grip, twisting Small’s arm painfully. “Bullshit. What were you doing in there?”
John turned off the tap and dried his hands, his hip against the edge of the counter as he watched Sherlock.
“We destroyed the research while you took out the artefact. Good plan.”
“Why him?”
the scene.” Gesturing as if he was diving into air at the same time.
“This is a pawnshop, it’s like a museum, old-looking things everywhere; it’s a goldmine for artifacts.” Sherlock explained as he followed John.
“And I thought I took ages to get ready,” she told him with a smile and an air kiss.
CUT TO: BROOKLYN 99 OPENING CREDITS - including the added "Special Guests"
“Why? B-because…” She paused, and after a moment smiled at Holmes. “Could you, um, give me a minute? Just, um, do some voice exercises or something, I’ll be right back.” Ms Hawkins stepped out.
He could feel John sizing him up, like a Captain checking his troops. Seemingly satisfied, John sat in the red armchair and sipped his tea.
“Mr Morgan, it’s an honour to meet you.” With a winning smile on his face, Holmes extended his hand. “I’m a big fan of your work.”
By which she meant shouting John’s name repeatedly to get her to step out of the shower with just a towel and make her lose it.
Time seem to slow down as Holmes’s attention focused solely on looking down the barrel. He somehow would have expected himself to feel a bit more out of sorts about the situation, but Holmes felt himself calm, accepting. The last two weeks had been a thrill and he was ready to accept this as the end, even if it felt more like a beginning.
John watched him get up and walk through the kitchen to the room at the end of the small corridor. The door closed with a clear indication that he wasn’t coming out until tomorrow.
Hm. Arousal then.
Holmes raised an eyebrow at Watson. Ms Adler joined in, waiting for his response and making the audience laugh.
Holmes scoffed. “You killed Anderson.”
SHERLOCK
He didn’t want to go. The dangerous look in John’s eyes was mesmerizing. What would John do if Sherlock pushed? Would he punch him? Would he spank him?
When I was picturing this story in my head, it started off with the opening song to Brooklyn 99, so I feel it’s fitting that it end with the Sherlock theme. Or both, you know, both are good. Like, I’m sure a mash up is possible. Or make the Sherlock theme funkier. Oooh, that could be nice…
The word still felt odd to the soldier. Then again, being where he worked, odd was normal. And he was beginning to suspect he had only seen the tip of the iceberg.
Dimmock and Wiggins burst out laughing.
You know.
Stamford chuckled. “I’m not firing you.”
Watson was already there getting interviewed. Holmes saw him lose what he was saying when their eyes met.
Sherlock’s head tilted to the side. “Technically, yes. It preserves awareness, but they don’t suffer any physical stress. Well, if done properly they don’t.”
Holmes turned away to prepare for the scene. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath, grounded himself and slowly shifted his weight and posture. As music filled the room, Holmes opened his eyes and Edward appeared.
“Are you saying what I did was wrong?”
Watson shook his head. He couldn’t understand how someone so careless could end up working with Scotland Yard. He was starting to understand why Lestrade thought someone should keep an eye on him.
“Where can we find him?”
“Come on.” John looked from the monitor to the sphere.
“Sherlock.” John reprimanded in a hushed tone.
“Afternoon.” Watson nodded.
Sherlock looks Jake up and down and raises an eyebrow.
“He’s dead.”
Sherlock.
“Better stop.” John held Sherlock’s wrists on either side of his shoulders. “You asked for a spanking, not snogging and grinding against the door.”
BOYLE
As he put down his coat on the counter next to the tools, Sherlock figured breaking into the owner’s office didn’t seem like such a bad idea compared to this.
Sherlock scoffed.
“I want you to lead with your left wrist and forehead.” John continued, deadpan. “Say it like you’re a hungry horse and she’s a bale of hay.”
“Good lad, thank you, thank you! You have no idea, I…” Stamford pulled back, brushed off Holmes’s suit jacket. “Thank you.”
He looked up, paused. “Kill me?”
Ms Rosie looked baffled. “What?”
Hey guys, are we having a group meeting or something?
They clinked their glasses and drank.
“It’s fine.”
“What does that have to do with it?”
“Wiggins,” Stamford warned patiently.
“And don’t you forget it.” Stamford shook Holmes’s hand and leaned closer, making sure to keep the microphone away. “Thank you Holmes. For everything.”
“Fair point, but not when you’re about to go bankrupt.”
That’s odd. Sherlock would normally have a retort to that. He loved having the last word. John changed the subject to the case. “So, where are we going?”
Sherlock glanced at the clock. “So it is, but I fail to see why that would make you point your Tesla at me first thing in the morning.”
John stared at the ceiling. “Shit.”
Holmes blushed from the memories of Watson talking about his dancing. “That obvious, is it?”
A gentle kiss on the forehead woke Sherlock. He opened his eyes and found John looking at him with a soft smile.
“What do you mean?” Watson asked. It’s a barometer, it measures atmospheric pressure, and he wouldn’t need to see the man use it to know what it does. He looked intently at the agent. “What does it do beside measure atmospheric pressure?” The agent squirmed in his seat and refused to look directly at Watson. He took the case file and stood up, straitening his suit.
While he paid, Sherlock couldn’t manage to shake off… whatever state of mind had been triggered by that spanking. He needed to get back to Baker Street as soon as possible.
Holmes felt a twitch of frustration but a part of him enjoyed the mystery, the game. He suddenly understood. “You’re a…” Holmes didn’t how else to put it, “consulting criminal.”
Charles. We talked about this.
Stamford ran to Holmes as soon as Morgan disappeared through the door and hugged him. The crew broke out in cheers of congratulations.
You’re about to follow someone you don’t know to observe them. That’s the definition of stalking.
John insisted. “Mr. Bishop, I understand you don’t want to lose someone you love, but this has to end.”
Watson’s eyebrows rose high, and he fought against the rising blush from the onslaught of memories, reminding him just how good it had been. Unwilling to look at Stamford’s confused face any longer, Watson closed his eyes and rubbed his face with his hands. Thankfully, Lestrade arrived, announcing himself with a knock on the door.
Holmes’s lips had barely moved, merely changed angles, making his cheekbones seem sharper. But his eyes were bright, vivid, somehow able to communicate more than Watson knew was possible. He found himself trying to bottle up the image in his head, take a picture, find the words to describe it so he could include it in one of his stories.
“Take good care of him,” she replied and winked at Holmes before heading into her dressing room.
SHERLOCK
by it. This was unacceptable, letting himself get distracted like this.
Watson lowered his cane. “Sit.”
“The LSD was my idea. Frank just wanted to do cocaine. So boring.”
NYPD, evacuate the museum immediately! This is an emergency!
“No.”
“Ms Adler, how was it changing directors during the process?”
Whatever Sherlock’s hips were doing to get more friction was cut short by a firm hold in his hair.
SHERLOCK
The soft sound of Stamford’s voice made Watson’s rage drop. He turned to him with a worried frown.
Holmes smiled nervously. “Good afternoon everyone.” He spoke with an American accent and clasped his hands. “Pleased to meet you all. I, um, well, the circumstances that led to me standing here are really, very terrible, so I understand if this is odd for any of you. I’m not trying to replace Mr Anderson, God rest his soul. I’m here to honour him, his legacy. Hopefully together, even with a tight schedule, we can make a movie in memory of him.”
Watson nodded. “I did, very much so.”
“Act it out?”
TERRY
“You underestimate the motivational skills of live fire.” He joked over the sound of running water, resorting to humour to cover up his awkwardness. He had barely walked into the kitchen that Sherlock was already trying to piss him off.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What’s his name?”
Watson bit back the lump in his throat and blinked away the tears. “I love you too.”
“Maybe
Jake, Amy, Rosa, Boyle, TERRY JEFFORDS , Gina, NORM SCULLY and MICHAEL HITCHCOCK are sitting at the tables. Lestrade is leaning against the wall on the right hand side, trying to ignore Gina’s lustful staring. Holt is standing at the podium hosting the meeting. Sherlock and John are standing beside Holt.
“But it was an accident.”
Once the glass was put aside, John sat back, hands on the armrests, and stared down at Sherlock. Within the blink of an eye, Captain Watson was back.
They stepped into the office and the first thing John saw was the Warehouse computer that seemed to be having a seizure. The first thing Sherlock noticed was the empty experiment table. A large blue flash of light coming from the Warehouse itself simultaneously caught their attention, making them walk to the windows.
Ms Hawkins imitated mockingly, “Can’t you hear yourself?”
“Yea-” John cleared his throat, surprising even himself by how husky it was, “Yeah.” And stood more firmly on his feet but still didn’t step away. Didn’t release his grip on Sherlock’s waist. Didn’t move his forehead from Sherlock’s chest.
But this. This was fascinating.
“I think they tailed the trucks.”
“Why are you meditating? Neutralize it already.” Sherlock opened his eyes as if he were waking from a dream.
“It’s fine, I’ve got it. I think I managed to save enough to eat. Something to drink? I have wine.”
Lestrade stepped closer to Holmes. “Stamford’s right, this is the perfect cover: you’ll have free access to everything and everyone, no one will question what you’re doing since you can always say it’s research for your character or some bullshit like that. You’re the lead, so everyone will do anything to be in your good graces, which means getting them to open up to you easily. Oh, and you can be as bossy as you please, everyone is paid to deal with your moods. They’ll put up with a lot of bullshit, as long as you’re punctual and deliver a good performance on camera.”
“But we’ll let you know.” Stamford added suggestively, making the room laugh.
“It will be worth the wait, I swear. Instead, I’ve chosen this song because,” Holmes paused to give Watson a sidelong glance. “It’s one of those songs you wonder if it was written for you. It’s from one of my favourite movies: Born to Dance.”
Sherlock cried out. The only reason he was still holding the position was because his entire body stunned by the pain. He kept trying to say the words but the link between thought and action had been severed.
“For God’s sake.” John said suddenly filled with adrenaline and barely stopped himself from striking Mycroft. His instinct was the only thing stopping his trained reflexes. “If you’re going to appear out of nowhere, at least do it where you’re not in striking distance of me because I swear one day you’ll regret it.”
“Yes, but even the biggest assholes know what being part of a team means. But with you, you barge in head first and I’m left to follow you best I can and pick up the pieces.”
“Oh no, you shut up. You shut up and listen. We ARE a team. I don’t care how you do it, but get it in that thick skull of yours. I am your partner now and I am not planning on taking any more of your bullshit.” John could feel his blood boiling. He hadn’t felt this level of rage in years. Considering everything he had endured ever since their first encounter, he shouldn’t be surprised he’d finally punched his partner. Now, straddling him, his goo soaked shirt twisted in his fists as he held the man on the floor, close enough to feel his breath on his face. “I don’t care what your issue with me is, I want to save the world as much as you do, but if you don’t communicate, you could be putting my life at risk as much as any civilian out there.”
“Yes, Sherlock?”
Yet the entire time, Molly couldn’t help but flush at the memory of Sherlock rubbing her full, reddened lip with glistening fingers. And she knew Sherlock could tell. How else could she explain Sherlock reading the lab report while she rubbed her bottom lip with those same fingers.
The short version is that Holmes said no to the hospital.
John looked from the paper covered table to his partner who was silently sitting with his stippled hands against his chin; his eyes closed but with movement behind the lids. He was concerned for his partner. With the evidence in front of him, Sherlock’s reaction yesterday was, well, understandable. John wondered if he would make things worse by asking questions about Irene when his food arrived. He scrambled to gather everything back into the file.
“We got searched when we went in and out of the building. It was safer not to keep it with me.” Sherlock said, his attention on his Farnsworth.
.” Stamford looked around worriedly. “Yes, thank you Ms Hooper, tell Mr Wilkes I will be right with him.”
“Did you want some more?” Holmes asked Ms Adler, pointing to the half-eaten piece of chocolate cake.
“I don’t know, it’s just, you don’t seem the type, I mean drugs are so…”
Watson blinked, surprised by the direction Wiggins’s interrogation was taking.
Sherlock’s words shook John so strongly that he didn’t even realise what he was saying before it came out. “I told you to shut up. You are not dying here, not while I’m still alive and able to do something about it.”
“Shut up.” Murray shrugged.
Jake mumbles something unintelligible through Amy’s hand when the suspect, Dean Chester, walks by Jake’s car.
“In case I needed tie wraps.” John answered back in a mocking tone.
“Ugh, I’m not an old lady yet, just call me Mrs Hudson like everyone else does.”
Deduction?
Their plates arrived then, distracting them both from the awkward conclusion of Lestrade’s story.
“When you came in yesterday, you already had a file on me or something?”
John chuckled softly. It was as much of an admission as he was going to get. “According to my new friend Doris, Barnabas is buying an elephant on the 4
And yet John couldn’t help the nagging feeling that Sherlock’s statement applied to two completely different conversations.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No. No plans.” Watson licked his lips. “I uh, I haven’t got a clue what-”
“Who sold this to you?” Sherlock asked as he showed the knife.
John’s jaw dropped as he watched a dark cloud of smoke rise. Somehow,
“Coordinates, accepted. Confirm mission?”
“Is that so Ms.?” Sherlock inquired.
Stamford paused. “Ms Adler will be co-owner of Stamford Productions.”
“I got stabbed in the gut, John used an artifact to keep me alive and now he insists we neutralise it, hence the OR needing to be prepped.” The senior agent did his best to say this as neutrally as possible, but he could still see his brother’s calculating eyes.
won’t do anything. We’re still filtering through the CCTV footage, and we have someone looking into where Manning was last seen. I have a new lead to follow up on. Consider this case closed for now.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed at the artifact. “Then it must be important.” A small smile grew on his lips.
“That’s nice of you to say but really it-”
John huffed a laugh and looked for a clean cup. At least his attempt at humour seemed to temporarily diffuse the ticking time bomb. “Well, as long as you know that the day you decide to fire live rounds for the sole purpose of getting me to move faster, I cannot be held responsible for my actions.” The only reaction John got was a sort of distracted humming noise from Sherlock as his fingers tapped quickly at his computer.
“Help me up.”
Endless wonder. No shit. Well, it seemed Mycroft’s words were spot on.
Judging by the face he was making when I got here, you didn’t need my help to ruin things.
“Napoleon played this violin while he was in exile on the island of Elba.”
But his eyes… Watson couldn’t look away. There was this careless, almost naïve quality to them. It was fascinating when compared to his confident stare, like he could see through everyone.
“How do you do.”
“So he was dead and brought back to life, now coming after you with a taste for vengeance.” Sherlock summarised.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.
Stamford refilled his drink for the third time as he finished telling Holmes the story of that dreadful day. Watson had moved over to the couch, leaving the desk chair to Stamford. Lestrade was sitting on the edge of the desk, arms crossed, still angry at Holmes.
Which precinct are you taking them to?
Holmes grew silent, and Watson regretted mentioning drugs altogether. He had no idea what he was stepping into with that subject and now wasn’t the right moment to broach it.
She smiled. “Pretty quick.”
Sherlock pondered it for a moment. “The story's over. Either they live on in the story or disintegrate.”
Even in their heightened state of arousal, the moment paused and stretched between them. Sherlock’s fingers slowed between John’s legs. Their lips grazed, exploring, gently pressing and sliding as they both took the time to enjoy the moment.
“Nobody can know about this, or that we’re investigating, we’ve had enough scandal around this movie, having the police call this an accident is a blessing. You can’t turn it into a murder.”
Watson felt the urge to burst out laughing. It felt surreal, being one of the only people in the room that knew what was really going on. Then again, they really didn’t, or else they wouldn’t be investigating. But it was… nice, feeling included in the secret.
“Feels like forever.” It wasn’t exactly a lie. The man chuckled as he rummaged through a box. His eyes widened a moment before he looked at Sherlock, whose back was turned, and John on the other side of the room, completely oblivious to them. The man stood up with the box he was looking through and asked.
“Maybe you’ll get one when I come out. If you behave.”
“Like an undercover investigation?” Lestrade offered.
Stamford frowned. “How did he even manage to make it home? It’s not that far, but still.”
What’s happening right now?
Wilder smiled. “Stop worrying. It’ll be fine.”
“Act up?”
John nodded. “So, if it does have voice command, we tell it to...”
“I’m a private detective in Chicago in the 1940’s.”
John licked his lips. Did he know he was staring at the display of leather collars?
What the-ah!
Holmes frowned, then looked amused. “No?”
are you staying for?”
“Yeah? What kind of world?”
“This will sting.”
“I just wish the missus had followed.”
John sat back down on the couch. Sherlock could feel the cushion dip beneath him as John shifted closer to the table. He was closer this time, his thigh so close Sherlock could feel its warmth.
sound disbelievingly.
“But what, John? Really, make up your mind.”
So when Sherlock heard the familiar crackling of electrical energy,that seemed to happen more frequently ever since John had started working as a Warehouse agent, he knew what was threatening to happen and had been for some time now.
“Sorry I couldn’t be of more help.” She apologised, batting her eyelashes at the former soldier.
Santiago, teams are not up for discussion.
Five.
“Who?”
“Nice to meet you.”
“Frank, stop, please, please stop, Frank,” Mrs Hudson sobbed.
“Lestrade says you think Anderson’s death wasn’t an accident,” Stamford pursued.
“I don’t, but you do.”
“You’re a sight for sore eyes.” Watson greeted.
“John!”
The frown morphed into a wicked smile. “You’re not the only one who’s good at more than one thing.”
He didn’t move a muscle, unimpressed by his partner’s answer. “So you aren’t even going to try?”
The ground rumbled as the Armor charged much faster than the agent was expecting. Almost as if the artifact were protecting him, the sabre swung up and to the left, but it was too late. Even though his parry saved him from a blow to the heart, the Armor’s blade still cut his left shoulder.
Watson closed the last page of the script and found himself looking at it with a fond smile. A part of him felt guilty for getting angry and storming into the audition. Now that he had read the notes, he knew Holmes really was just suggesting small changes here and there to give the characters and story more depth. He really was just trying to make a better movie. It had nothing to do with his ego.
John’s eyes opened once more, biting her lip as she looked at Molly from head to toe. “Yes.”
“Here or in London?” John asked.
Lestrade led the way to interrogation room two. He unlocked the door and held it open, but stopped Sherlock’s entry with a hand on his chest.
“Ah, there it is!” Quickly, he pushed off the lid, took off his latex gloves and grabbed the sabre. As he straightened, Sherlock eyed The Armor, moving slowly towards the center of the alley to face his opponent.
Holmes looked at Ms Adler and found himself enjoying the fact the investigation had taken a turn he couldn’t have predicted. Holmes saw Ms Adler’s instinct for survival with a whole new perspective, including what she had said earlier about helping people. This information could easily be used as blackmail.
“I’m the one who should be apologising, I didn’t realise you were recovering.”
“John, we don’t have to… you could just give me a sample and-”
“I’m not sure that’s… a good idea.”
“Yes,” Ms Adler replied. “Three more movies. Writing and directing. With Ms Hooper as your assistant, assuming you still want to work with her.”
John hung the stethoscope around his neck and removed his gloves. He may have taken his time. He liked to be thorough when he could, especially before a surgery, although he may have been a bit enthusiastic about cleaning the blood off Sherlock’s chest and back.
I vote for alphabetical.
“Lights go, sound go, camera go. Ready.” Ms Hooper called.
“Which means?!” John asked as Sherlock called the elevator.
“John, you got stabbed by a knife with a glass blade that started to transform you into glass and then lost your hearing because you made a clock frown.”
That’s when Morgan arrived, sunglasses covering almost half of his face, wearing a three-piece suit with a beret that matched his waistcoat. His presence changed the atmosphere, charging the cast and crew with nervous energy, wondering how the day would go based on the director’s mood.
“Why is this so important to you? Why all the teamwork speeches?” Sherlock asked impatiently. “Is this about losing your team? It happened 3 years ago, how could it still bother you?”
“Fine.” Begrudgingly, Neeson took out his ear piece and threw it to Watson who quickly put it on and moved out to follow the man. Looking through the half open door leading into the corridor, he could see him standing in front of a checkpoint, holding his phone up towards the camera, then to the door. The LED changed to green and he passed through. Watson dashed to the checkpoint before it closed. The man was almost at the end of the corridor, his lab coat lying abandoned on the floor.
Rather than doing so, Sherlock took the bondage strangler case file from the desk, and spread the pictures out on the coffee table.
BOYLE
Lestrade waited to listen to the crew’s whispers before going over to knock at Holmes’s dressing room.
Morgan’s shout snapped everyone into movement, and there was a flurry of action as everyone prepared for another take.
“What did the owner say?” John asked as he straightened up.
“But you’re ok?”
“I’m starting to get why using artifacts in everyday life isn’t the best idea.”
“Maybe, why?”
“I mean you.”
Lestrade shakes Holt’s hand and leaves. Gina unabashedly checks him out as he does and makes a few moaning sounds, making everyone cringe.
No. No one disturbs them.
He straightened when Ms Hawkins opened the door.
“You still could,” Holmes offered.
“Seriously?”
“Not if it looks like a suiciiide.” Moriarty sang.
SHERLOCK
Amy checks her phone for a signal as the sound of a speedboat slowly comes closer. Boyle is the first to hear the sound and turn around.
“I…” Anderson let his shoulders sag. “That’s probably best, yeah.”
For comparing Sherlock Holmes to a petty Private Investigator.
Wiggins pursed his lips, mocking an impressed look. “Alright then.”
It seemed Holmes was doing the same, Watson noted, smirking to himself. Holmes kept looking over to Moran, who was currently loading a few set pieces that needed maintenance into his truck. He was currently securing the load with rope, but Watson couldn’t figure out what had caught Holmes’s attention without asking him directly.
No. This was not good at all.
Peralta, Santiago.
“I think they’re planning to build tunnels under Stamford Productions.”
Watson smiled and shook his head as he limped past Holmes. “I’ll look at it again after filming.” He warned as they walked out of the infirmary.
“Thank you Holmes.”
SHERLOCK
“I thought I told you to go easy on the sequins.”
“Who?”
John is sitting at the end of Rosa’s desk. He checks his phone again.
They hurried off, leaving Holmes and Watson alone.
But with a man? With Holmes?
“It was smiling when I picked it up.” John explained. Sherlock’s eyes widened as he looked back at the clock.
“That’s an even worse idea.” John wrote something on his chart and then proceeded to check Sherlock’s blood pressure. “What if somebody finds them? If I were you I’d keep them around my neck.”
“Good, cause that bite is gonna be there a while.” John nodded towards Sherlock’s neck.
“Always keep a hard copy. They learned that the hard way after Warehouse 3 burned down.”
Sir before you say anything, I just wanted to say that I am so sorry for what happened.
“It’ll be fine.”
Stamford was about to wake him when-
“So you don’t care that you made that girl cry?” John reproached as he watched Sherlock move a bucket of goo over to the table.
They went their separate ways for the remainder of the break. Lestrade went back to his guard post. Morgan went to his chair and moped while Ms Hawkins fetched him coffee. Stamford and Ms Hooper headed over to Ms Adler’s dressing room.
Holmes took a chance. “Why a production company?”
As John aimed and turned on the hose, he watched the armor spin while unbalanced and stab Sherlock in the gut just as his arms had started to strike down.
“Late 1800’s. But that face...” Sherlock wondered as he straightened and closed his eyes. John waited for him to open them, only he stood there, completely still. After almost 20 seconds, John had to speak.
Sherlock stuffed them in her robe pocket and knelt.
Sherlock tried to tilt the receiver so he could hear but John pushed him back with his free hand, his fingers fanned out against his chest as he held Sherlock at arm’s length. Regretting his move, he fought to stay concentrated on Doris’s story instead of the warm body under his hand.
“A world of endless wonder.”
Sherlock switched out the slide.
“It’s not
“I didn’t say anything.”
“Guard down. Checkpoint. Over.” Jones called.
“South west, just outside the city.” He paused. “Isn’t that-?”
“Consultant?” Lestrade returned to his seat and signalled them to sit as well. “I didn’t think you consulted anyone but yourself.”
Sherlock couldn’t believe it. John was going along with this.
“Eight.”
“You think he’s a scam artist?” Lestrade offered.
It took over twenty minutes, but they managed to figure out the pacing of the scene so that by the time Edward joined the game, he got a winning hand. As worried as the extras were at his arrival, they were all smiling by the end.
“It's as if the universe had its own cruel way of telling us that Anderson wasn't meant to be part of the plan.”
“Hm.”
“Headache.”
“You’re thinking about it, aren’t you?”
“Well, that too.”
“Sherlock, you will investigate, and that is final.” John recognised the commanding officer's tone. They stared at each other for a moment before Sherlock sniffed loudly and turned to the computer, his hands flying across the keyboard as he tuned out the room. Mycroft breathed through his nose and turned to smile tightly at their guest. “Ms. Adler, if you will excuse me, I have other matters to attend to. Please give us as much information as you can and during the time of the investigation, I would appreciate it if you didn’t leave the country.”
Sherlock disappeared out of John’s sight as he made a sharp left. As soon as he rounded the corner himself, John felt like he was hitting an invisible wall. He willed his body to keep moving even though he wanted to crumble to the floor as he suddenly felt his insides twist; his head throbbed in pain, as if it had been hit by a frying pan. He felt anger, pain, sadness, betrayal, joy, love, jealousy and lust all at once. He wanted to jump of joy, run around screaming and drop to the floor in tears simultaneously.
“Probably. Still hurts though.” Sherlock smile faded as he hissed in pain.
Lestrade and Boyle are singing a barbershop song together and nailing it. Rosa and John pull up next to Boyle’s car just as their song ends. Boyle notices them and rolls down his window.
Boyle to dispatch, we need a boat to chase a barge.
Holmes rolled his eyes and battered her hand away, but Watson could tell that was a real smile he was fighting off.
“Choose option.”
SHERLOCK
“That is not how an industrial conveyer belt works at all.” Holmes continued, “Turn it off!”
“What besides-?” Sherlock half asked Mycroft.
Please. Fascinating barely describes the depth and complexity of their love.
website, and another to a sort of Wiki-BDSM website. Sherlock found himself reading about subspace, which confirmed that the headspace he had found himself during his time with John was common.
“She’s fictional!”
“Admit it.”
“But why lock it up? If it can regrow limbs and organs, why not use it? It could save thousands, millions of lives.”
Not good. Definitely not good.
“Did you need help with the washing up?”
Sherlock sprinted to the fire hose, dropping his weapon next to it while he released the nozzle and started pulling it free. When he checked over his shoulder, he wasn’t expecting his opponent to already be up and charging at him. It wasn’t even using its weapon. The agent dropped the hose and twisted his body in the hopes of evading the hit, but in vain. The leather armor struck the side of his body, making him crash into the hose reel and crumble to the floor.
“I would, I asked Ms Hooper to check her schedule, she should have been here.”
Watson looked at the floor and tried to hide as much of his neck into his shoulders as he could manage.
“Shit,” Moriarty hissed.
“You okay?”
Something flashed in Morgan’s eyes as he looked him from head to toe. “We all know the only reason you’re here is because of Stamford’s pity. Writing’s the only thing a
SHERLOCK
Me too.
“Alright.” Wiggins was in a good mood. “Let’s do the first meeting one last time, then we’ll move on to the date.”
“You’d be a great partner,” Watson added. “I don’t see who else I could pull this off with.”
“Watson!” Rogers’s voice came from behind him. Watson turned around slowly, not knowing what to say. “Chopper should arrive any second. You ok? You sounded odd on the coms.” The soldier frowned. He hadn’t even heard them call the chopper.
Holt pinches the bridge of his nose. Diaz has a smile tugging at her lips. Boyle is smiling like crazy. Lestrade is trying not to laugh.
Their guest was now frozen with stupor, her mouth slightly open until she frowned, looked from John to Sherlock and uttered. “How did you-?”
“We can do it tomorrow evening, or the following morning even, two nights would be ideal, especially after multiple washings.”
Sherlock felt a gentle press of the leather paddle on the area and stopped breathing a moment.
“Where’s the sneaky bastard?” Jones asked smiling as he came up to Watson, still stunned and pissed at what had happened. The Captain braced himself for what he was about to say.
John knew he wasn’t going to change his mind, now that he thought about it; it was surprising he hadn’t already turned and left already. “Fine. I’ll stay until closing time.” John offered reluctantly.
Holmes looked down and saw the holes and scuff marks on both his knees. He turned to Watson and when their eyes met they burst out laughing.
“Well.” Stamford jumped on the chance to change the subject. “Before we discuss the case.” Stamford eyed Holmes with a serious face. “About the press conference tomorrow, I just want you to understand how important these are for the success of the movie. You must charm the reporters, even though their job is to try and get a rise out of you. They will do anything to get a front page.”
“He’s gone. I don’t understand, he was right next to me, a moment ago, I looked back to see if you were coming as I was talking into the coms, then when I looked back he was gone and he took the artefact. How the hell did he take it without me seeing him? When did he even have the time? I don’t, it doesn’t make any sense!” Watson was looking around for something he had missed.
“You asked, deal with what you get.” John kept his gaze on the GPS but he could still picture his partner’s eye roll. “Um, basic button interface, display screen... So yeah, it can teleport. Either on its own, or when you touch it. Or if you try to push it off a shelf with a stick. Or a trap door-”
Last night was nothing compared to what Sherlock was witnessing right now. John was looking at him with such desire and yet so much restraint. Seeing the man struggle to keep control was somehow making the overall effect even more enticing. Having it displayed at such proximity was giving Sherlock a hard time to keep a coherent line of thought. John must know that he could see it, was seeing it written all over his face, and yet he wasn’t shying away. John was staring right back at him, struggling to keep his breathing under control. The sight of uninhibited desire was making Sherlock breathless and all he could think about was that all he needed to do was give one little sign. One word, that’s all it would take. How would John react if Sherlock leaned in just a little? If he tilted his head and looked at him through his lashes? How long would it take for John to close the space between them?
