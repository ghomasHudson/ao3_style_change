“221B Baker Street,” John replied automatically and immersed himself in his thoughts again. Of course it wasn’t the first time Sherlock had almost got killed during a case, but it had never got to him the way it did now. Yes, there had been nightmares about faceless killers running after them and fatally injuring Sherlock, but they had been just that: dreams. They hadn’t kept him on the verge of a panic attack during his waking hours.
He hadn’t participated in any kind of power play since he’d joined the army and Sherlock had told him about his consensual but questionably safe and sane experiences. Why had he even agreed to indulge Sherlock’s military kink in the first place? He’d been selfish and he ended up hurting Sherlock just like the stupid Dom before him. What if Sherlock wanted to break up with him altogether? To find a better Dom… maybe even a better boyfriend?
, but I could really need your help, John. It’s just till I’m home again, but I have to work a double shift.”
“I’m whimpering and begging you to fuck me, but you still deny me any kind of release. I promise that I can be good for you, but of course you want me to prove it, so you grab my hair and fuck my mouth instead. Goood, Captain!” Sherlock groaned when John bobbed his head up and down on his crotch. John hummed around him, the hand that worked his own cock was moving faster by the minute.
John brushed his thumb over Sherlock’s cheeks to wipe the tears away, then moved his hand to Sherlock’s hair and gently caressed the sweaty curls. After a while, John assessed that Sherlock was calm enough to go on with the scene. “Do you still remember the instructions I gave you?”
John didn’t correct him this time. He had already spent seven months trying to teach Sherlock Greg’s actual name and he knew better than to feel concerned about a lost cause in the middle of a case. Sherlock’s phone pinged with an incoming text. The detective sighed and quickly typed out a response. “Lestrade?” John asked and darted a glance at his boyfriend.
“Damn right you didn’t. What else?”
Lestrade and his team of two uniformed police officers were waiting in a less crowded part of the arrivals area. Greg looked mildly distressed and John had a faint idea that it might have something to do with one of the many text messages Sherlock had typed out furiously.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock answered and complied without hesitation.
The morning had been
He only set the skull back down on the mantle, searching his Persian slippers next. “Where are they? John, where are my cigarettes?” he demanded impatiently. He threw one of the slippers across the room and delved into a stack of papers.
“Is everything alright, Sherlock?”
number by heart, but there was something comforting about seeing the name attached to said number. Sherlock typed out a text message, his thumb hovering over the 'send' button. He felt self-conscious, stupidly so, but she owed him a rather huge favour after all…
John placed his laptop next to him on the sofa, got up rather quickly and glared at Sherlock from where he’d stopped in the kitchen door. Sherlock pointedly slowly looked up from his microscope and met the ex-army doctor’s gaze without flinching.
it was there. He snatched the scarf from John’s hand and wrapped it around his neck.
“Then we’ll have to talk it through again. But for now, let’s also talk about the things we enjoy.”
“There’s something else we have to get out of the way before I can fuck you into oblivion,” John said out of the blue, his casual tone undermining the meaning of his words. “Every time you feel bored, you’re itching for cigarettes. How many times did you promise me you’d quit?” John added a twist of his wrist and Sherlock moaned.
John wanted to disagree, but Sherlock had a point there. “Yeah, maybe you’re right,” he admitted and slowly let go of Sherlock’s hand. Sherlock smiled at him and turned around to follow Greg, leaving him alone to make his way back home.
, YES! Ooooh John. Johnnn, Jooo... fuck!” Sherlock violently bucked up when John took his hand away.
he was getting punished. “Of course I could tell you why I was angry with you, but there’s no point in that. I want you to
He chose everything he needed for Sherlock’s punishment as planned and looked at the small collection of items on the bedspread. Especially one of them reminded John of what was still missing: his own patience in this. He should never, absolutely
When they arrived at Heathrow airport, John was struggling to keep up with Sherlock – not only because Sherlock left him behind to pay the cabbie, but also because he hurried down the crowded terminal with single-minded focus. John had to run to keep up with the taller man’s pace.
“John! Over here, mate.”
The next minutes were filled by the same pattern of sounds: the distinct
The consulting detective stopped dead in his tracks when he spotted two Spanish police officers arriving with their murder suspect. There was no way that Thomas could possibly escape the trial, but he was still struggling against the police officers’ hold on his upper arms. Sherlock focused all of his attention on the suspected man.
John pinched the bridge of his nose with two fingers. “Is she alright? Are you?”
John granted him a smile, crossed the room and locked the door to keep potential clients and Mrs Hudson from walking in on them. Sherlock was still sitting on the sofa, his attention solely focused on John while waiting for commands.
. I’ll be back in a few.” He grabbed their empty teacups on his way back to the kitchen.
“You suddenly started questioning the things we did, right? You think I can’t possibly feel safe when submitting to you even though I do. Very much, in fact. I wouldn’t trust you if I had any doubts about your competence as a Dom, John. I only said the things I said because I didn’t recognise the situation right away for what it was. You didn’t believe me when I said you hadn’t hurt me, so I assumed you thought I was weak, vulnerable. Too vulnerable to play safely or speak up when you’d really cross my limits.”
Sherlock flinched at the last word.
Sherlock rolled his eyes at John’s inability to
“Of course you do,” John laughed and gave Sherlock a little peck on his chin. He darted a glance at the kitchen table that was still cluttered with Sherlock’s microscope and beakers and carried both cups towards the coffee table instead.
Sherlock felt the heat rising in his cheeks and cleared his throat. “The thing that you did yesterday… I liked it a lot, John. It was good,” he admitted and smiled when he was rewarded with another kiss.
Sherlock was utterly satisfied. Not only physically, though. Apparently, a single word was all it took to spice up their morning sex. A single word and a kink that – as he now knew – both of them were up for. The following days would definitely be fun.
Sherlock still doesn't know how to negotiate his kink, but John is a saint.
Sherlock followed him hesitantly. He couldn’t be fooled by John’s carefree demeanour. John was nervous about something; it was more than obvious from his elevated breathing rate and the one too many smiles. Sherlock joined his boyfriend on the sofa and gracefully sipped his tea, pondering on random case facts and John’s behaviour.
John took a deep breath and looked him straight in the eyes. “Still, it’s a pity you’re not allowed to come.”
Sherlock gulped the liquid down greedily. He hadn’t realised how thirsty he’d got in the aftermath of the scene. He set the glass back on the coffee table and stretched luxuriously on the sofa, his head resting on John’s thighs. John raked his fingers through the soft curls and gently massaged Sherlock’s scalp.
“The plane’s going to land any minute now, sir,” one of the uniformed police officers chimed in.
John’s tone hadn’t been distinctly commanding, but Sherlock didn’t want to risk punishment just to satisfy his curiosity. Instead, he simply followed John’s request. It was a welcome pause that allowed him to expand and organise the new wing in his mind palace. John would never call him names that made his skin crawl. He’d never hurt him unless he explicitly begged for it and even then, he’d take care of him afterwards. Sherlock mentally created a secret passage to the small but steadily growing room labelled 'trust'. All of his former relationships, even the non-kinky ones, had eventually tried to destroy it… The dull sound of two plates being set down on the coffee table in front of him brought him back to the present.
Lestrade even texted me the details!” he snapped back.
“Then why did you cry again when the scene was over?” John asked confused.
“Alright, that’s it. Come here, Sherlock!” For a few seconds, Sherlock only stood there, paralysed by John’s Captain voice. “I said, come here! I promise you that you won’t be bored,” John explained with a deceiving gentleness. Sherlock took a few steps towards the other man. “Kneel, pet.”
“Please kiss me?” Sherlock bit his bottom lip in the most adorable way possible.
…” he moaned when John sucked and nibbled at the love bite he’d created earlier.
The sight of Sherlock’s reddened skin combined with the moans that vibrated through his cock had almost been enough to drive John over the edge. He took some deep, calming breaths and ordered Sherlock to lie down on his back. Sherlock obeyed him with a smug grin. He had deduced how he could bring him off the fastest way despite the pants and that just wouldn’t do. “You’re still thinking too much, pet.” John retrieved a bottle of lube from the bedside table and sat down between Sherlock’s legs. “I promised you that you wouldn’t have to think at all for a while, and I keep my promises.”
Sherlock…” John’s sentence ended in a drawn-out moan, his voice breaking on his lover’s name.
Sherlock smiled against John’s chest. “I am now.”
“Night,” the detective replied and grinned internally for the second time this evening. John had obviously noticed that something was different, strange even. Good. No, better than good:
– or whatever it is the two of you are – get in a fight again, I don’t want either of you to bother me with the details or ask for advice.” Sherlock’s tone was harsh.
Two episodes of EastEnders and five denied orgasms later John was convinced that Sherlock had enough discipline play for today. Well, at least he was
“I don’t know, sweetheart. I don’t like the idea of leaving you alone with a man that almost shot you.”
“Sure,” the ex-army doctor replied and smiled at him.
to improve the security system,” Sherlock hissed.
Sherlock had quite a few, but for now he picked his favourite one. John couldn’t possibly miss the grin on his face when he remembered the details.
John turned to Lestrade instead: “What is it with you and Sherlock lately?” He hadn’t missed that Sherlock picked at the DI’s mistakes more than usual.
“Today’s… Monday, right?”
“It’s rough and intense, but I like it. I’m moaning around your cock, tears stream-streaming down my face when you make me take your entire length down my throat, but you don’t care. I swallow around you, want to please you so badly. You keep on fucking my mouth but sssuddenly pull out when you’re close. I’m beg-begging you to let me suck you off, but you say that I don’t even deserve to swallow your cum until punishment’s over.” John withdrew his mouth from Sherlock’s cock to fill his lungs with some much-needed oxygen.
, of course he knew–
“Yeah, obviously,” John giggled.
“I just want to make sure that I didn’t push your limits there and–”
“Duly noted.” It didn’t take much to figure out what that was about. “You’ll also need a safeword. I suggest we take things slow, experiment what we’re both comfortable with, but I won’t play with you unless you choose a safeword.”
Sherlock knelt down between John’s spread legs and braced his hands on either side of John’s hips; his mouth only inches above John’s crotch. John’s rock-hard cock was lying on his lower belly, foreskin fully retracted, the exposed head shiny wet with precome. It was a bit shorter than his own cock but much thicker. Sherlock licked his lips at the mere sight of it and slowly went down on John. “Let me show you just
“Oh, John, thank God you’re finally picking up!” She sounded desperate, her voice shaking slightly. “Harry’s suffered a relapse. Six months, six bloody months wasted in a single day!”
John pushed his jeans and pants off his hips, closed his left hand around his cock and stroked himself in a slow rhythm.
“See, that’s what I meant, dear. He didn’t mean to hurt you or make you worry about him, it’s just because he’s…” Mrs Hudson was struggling to find the right word.
. But we know that she did drown, so the only logical assumption is that she hyperventilated right before her killer shoved her unconscious body into the river. That’s why there were no signs of resistance on her body. By that point, the victim was too weak to save herself; she immediately sank down into the water and died as soon as it filled her lungs, but due to the fact that she hyperventilated right before her death, she drowned without actually asphyxiating in the pathological sense.”
“Sherlock, I asked you something.”
Sherlock shifted a bit and snuggled his face into John’s pillow, but he kept on snoozing. John smiled as he fought the urge to brush a stray curl out of Sherlock’s forehead and continued his way to the bathroom instead. Case or not, they’d probably have a rather relaxed morning.
When Sherlock was eventually done with his experiments on the victim’s blood – he had told Lestrade right away that the 'accident' hadn’t been an accident at all – he allowed himself to focus exclusively on coming up with a detailed plan to make John aware of his military kink without wasting any words on it. Of course it would be sufficient to nick John’s dog tags and place them somewhere else in the flat, perhaps in the drawer that also contained their lube and sex toys, but wouldn’t it be so much more fun to call John 'Captain' during sex and then see how the other man would react to that? Perhaps they’d fall into some kind of role-play, perhaps John would even agree to wear his old army fatigues the next time. Sherlock had imagined it so many times before: olive-coloured fabric covering tanned skin and accentuating lean muscles, John’s dog tags clinking with every movement of his body, with every breath, every thrust, clinking together in a staccato rhythm when John drove them both over the edge…
Part of him wanted to go straight back home and apologise to Sherlock, even though he’d probably be too angry and defensive to even listen… Then again – despite the circumstances – Sherlock would have to learn that acting like a brat got him nowhere. John felt his head spin with the conflicting ideas.
As usual, it was his personal assistant that answered.
"And then... what? Call in backup?" She questioned, sucking on a cherry pit, and he nodded, "Exactly. I said I'd text him as soon as this guy leaves... A rather dull case, I must admit, but John threatened to shoot me if I didn't accept. Apparently, I'm not very good company when I'm bored".
Lestrade gave him a questioning look, but Sherlock ignored it.
Rachel :)
Lestrade sighed, fighting back a smile as he realised what they were up to, and nodded, "Yea. Found in the Thames, same place, same murder weapon..."
"Short-term, yes, not long term".

At the other end of the seat, Anthea looked up and raised a single eyebrow at his rumbled appearance.
He smirked and turned back to the forensic scientist, "Even a
"Just help him!" Mycroft snapped, gesturing at the pale detective on the ground.
Sherlock gave an over-dramatic sigh, and pointed to the ceiling, "Over there in the top right-hand corner. She's huge, you can't miss her".
Silently slipping into the room, John was met with the sight of his daughter standing, hands on hips, glaring at the sitting down detective.
Lestrade smirked, "Don't worry, it's not as bad a it looks. And I'm so doped up on painkillers, I can't feel anything anyway".
Anderson stared at him, "... Why no garlic?"
Startled, the woman jumped, head snapping up only to find-
"Well" Sherlock finally decided, "Mummy said she'd pick us up in half an hour, so, until then..."
He emphasised his frustration by pointing a gun at the detective's head.
Sherlock claimed it was insanity.
"Looking for another out-of-print book?"
"I'm allergic" Sherlock replied simply, and John quickly coughed to cover up his snort of laughter.
"Why?"

But apparently, John was too boring and Sherlock was too eccentric for either of them to have killed her, and so the case moves on.
It took an embarrassingly long time for anyone to notice.

Sherlock let out a dramatic huff, "Why would I bother

Molly frowned, "Oh... well, maybe it'll just take a lot of practice".
, so:
The woman glanced over at him, before giving her boss a knowing look, "I'll leave you to it, then".
Stepping back, Sherlock turned to John, panting slightly, only to find the ex-soldier staring right back at him, eyes wide.
It was in history class, one of his Year 13 subject choices, and his teacher had just started discussing World War 2 and its most prominent figures.
The blonde's frown deepened, "Well... if it's not
The man blinked, "Oh... yes... the sun".
the smart one".
"I've read all of those too".
Molly sat in the café, both hands wrapped around a long-since cold cup of coffee, wondering whether or not it was a mistake to come here.
The pillow still had his scent, fresh soap, leather and expensive single malt scotch.
"And then he kissed you".
" He drawled, "Isn't it rather obvious?"
Only to find Lestrade grinning at him and pointing his phone at the pair.
"I'm pretty sure you could search this flat all day and you wouldn't find anything you call 'recreational'" John continued and-
John had never killed for someone else before that night.
Following the soldier's line of sight, he saw the kidnapper collapsed against the wall in front of him, a single neat bullet hole in the middle of his forehead.
He frowned and turned to face him, "Smith? Seriously? You know that's... like... probably
Knocking lightly, he stepped into the room, only to find Lestrade sitting up in bed and taking to one of his officers.
He silently let out a relived breath as he realised the Inspector had copped onto his antics.
Swallowing thickly against the lump steadily rerising in her throat, she shoved away those

"What do you think, Sherlock?"
"It's... It's Sherlock".

He gracefully ducked under the tape, despite the child in his arms, "And let a murderer go free? Not likely, George".
His smile widened into a grin.
under the man's intense gaze, and he quickly coughed and took a step forwards to distract himself from those piercing blue eyes.
The older man nodded, "Yea. I plan on joining the Yard when I graduate".
"Until he's safely out of the building".
John quickly spins around to face their guests and locks eyes with Lestrade, who's looking just as pale as he is, and then with Molly, who's- who's- who's
She felt tears prickle behind her eyes, and shoved away her coffee cup, hands coming to clutch tightly at each other instead.

It wasn't as if Sherlock had been any worse than his usual self, after all.
"You don't need to know that" came the calm reply, and John struggled to place the accent.
actually that irresponsible".
His hand inched slowly towards his pocket.
Lestrade smiled, knowing that for now, they were okay.
John was instantly on dad-alert mode and sat up straighter, putting down his fork and knife.
"You give up drugs, including cigarettes-"
" His voice broke, "... You
Walking up to the old store, squished between two more larger buildings, he peered in through the dusty window, thankful to find that the place was still open despite the late hour.
"No".
"Dad? Sherlock?"
He got a small nod in reply.
He glanced up from his plate just as Sherlock answered, "Yes, honey bee?"
"Not even close" John replied smirking, "The genius over here, has a
"Dilated pupils" the genius replied, keeping his gaze on John's, "Stiff muscles, blue lips, loss of motor control... Get an ambulance".
"Yes" Gregory replied, before suddenly flushing, "I... I mean it makes sense... I can't stay by myself right now, and I do want to stay in the city so I... yes?"
He smirked in irony.
Sherlock frowned and glanced down at his dark red shirt, "Are you sure?"
"Poor you".
Sherlock was alive.
"Okay then, Sebastian, why did you try to hit my 3-year-old sister?"
"So... Kyle... how do you get on in school?"

He wasn't as young as he used to be, and handling a shovel was more difficult now thanks to his leg and shoulder. Before the war, it never took more than two hours to dig a grave. Now it was taking him four.
Mycroft started, then blinked.
A man that controlled the entire British government.
The man immediately deflated, and John's grin was genuine as he patted him on the shoulder consolingly, "But hey, look on the bright side! Sherlock's going to be around for a long
He'd been trying to find a book for his criminology class for ages without luck, and had finally followed Sherlock's not-so-accurate directions to the second-hand place that he swore by.
Collapsing back against the door, she quickly brought a hand up to muffle her sobs, taking a few precious moments to try and compose herself.
The younger man watched as the fire flickered, the flames reflecting in his eyes, "... He was the one who found me, you know. Back when I... when I overdosed... I don't think he ever forgave himself for not seeing the signs, and I... I never forgave myself for making him have to... He sends Lestrade in every so often under the pretence of a drugs bust, just to make sure that I am, in fact, still clean".
Greg slowly picked up his jacket and walked down the aisle towards the elder Holmes who was, strangely enough, rather
He nodded quickly, stepping into the apartment before the older man changed his mind, and awkwardly hovered at the doorway of the sitting room as the officer put the beer in the fridge.
" He continued, frustrated, thoughts strangely jumbled, "I can't... I don't... I don't
They walked towards the main doors in a companionable silence, and Greg found himself thanking the elder Holmes for it. He was a quiet man, after all, and he appreciated the time to get his head together.
He was tall himself, John distantly noted, a good foot on himself. But he was slight, skinny, lanky even, and he felt like, if he had to, he could take him.
The book he was looking for had been out of print for the last few years, so maybe he

Hearing chains creak near him, he turned only to find a boy not much older than he was take the seat next to him and give him a shy smile.
John frowned, recognising that voice.
Lestrade stared at him, an incredulous grin slowly beginning to make its way across his face, "Hang on a minute... You used to pay criminals to steal purses whenever I was near... so you could
Sebastian swallowed nervously and glanced to the side, and Mycroft followed his gaze only to find the dark-haired boy that Eurus had knelt down besides staring back, calmly.
He wasn't a stranger to smoking then.
How- What-
"Anytime you get the urge to hurt yourself, you'll tell me" He said, reaching out for her phone which she cautiously gave, "And anytime I feel the urge to get high... I'll text you".
"Fine" He pouted, standing up, "And I expect to see you at Mummy's this Christmas".
"Move in with me".
He panicked, briefly, when the detectives found the pink case in their flat, and worried that the offhand remark of "find the suitcase, find the killer" would be taken more seriously.
John frowned, not liking how scared the usually unflappable detective was, and he carefully raised a hand to place on the younger man's shoulder to calm him down.
John tried vehemently to open his eyes but his body refused to cooperate.
Walking into the small room, he was more than surprised to see one Mycroft Holmes awkwardly hovering next to a plate of what most certainly were pancakes, full dressed and with a rather endearing blush on his cheeks.
"That I thought you like".
John stood there in shock, trying to process it all.
"Yes. You look... rather dashing in it. Especially since the trousers are slightly too small".
"So, what, we just sit and wait?"
"Sherlock".
, you idiot" He snapped, "The

being capable of understanding.
But he couldn't not tell her, she was his daughter, his honey bee, and he'd gladly kill anyone who tried to harm her.
"Oh yea?" He smirked, turning to face him fully, "And why's that?"
"Well maybe if you actually
that it just-"
The older detective held his breath.
He shook his left hand and the handcuffs tying him to the leaky radiator rattled.
"What are you doing out of bed?!" He demanded, marching over to the sheet-clad man who's response, most likely clever yet insulting, was muffled by the cushion he had his face pressed against.
She cursed herself for the audible tremor in her voice.
at her.
And tossed into the back of a speeding van.
Sherlock grinned.
"Lovely night for burying, isn't it?"
And it was piled high with books.
The boyfriend gave a small smile, "Well, I'm... I'm doing five subjects for my A-levels. I'm hoping to get a scholarship to Oxford in two years time, to study law".
"... What if he's not gay?"
John frowned.
"Well, people who spoke have a higher chance of moving onto harder drugs. That, and the fact your eyes were slightly red when you called me a liar..."
That and the rumbling from underground, of course, signalling Westminster Station was near.
Now, though, he looked down at it in surprise, slowly reaching out to open the front cover.
Mycroft swallowed thickly, unsure what to say.
"No, not a
, you're really one of a kind, aren't you?" He whispered, staring up at him in such awe that Mycroft felt himself blush again.
John looked up as the bell above the door chimed, and felt his pulse quicken as he realised it was the man from last week.
The elder's arms cautiously came up to wrap around the man's shoulders, and he felt the other sigh again, leaning close enough to speak in a whisper that only Lestrade could hear.
He only realised his mistake by stepping forwards when it abruptly hit him that Mycroft hadn't taken a step back, and then suddenly they were standing chest-to-chest and neither of them seemed to have any issue with it.
"Well how would you feel if you burst into Sherlock's flat and saw John dancing around half naked?"
His theory was only further proven when his internal clock struck midnight the same time he heard the unmistakeable toll of Big Ben in the background.
"Perfect" the blonde replied, "I close up early, around twelve... How about half past?"
"... This is the woman's bathroom".
Mr. Jones, of course, remained as stoic as ever, arms remaining by his side.
Jealous of what?
It was an entire week later before he suddenly became decidedly and irreparably
The startled blonde, wearing pale pink today, stared at him for a moment before slowly, ever-so-slowly smiling and shaking it, "John Watson".
"Immediately".
He froze.
"You kissed him" Anthea stated, and Mycroft nodded.
, you idiot!" He snapped, "Now go! And for the love of god, Geoff, find out the man's name!"
"I used to pay criminals to steal purses whenever you were near".
Knowing exactly where he was only made this overrated kidnapping all that more tiresome.
They both turned back to Sherlock and he gave them a rare grin, "Enjoy your date. Also, John, I won't be home this weekend, Mycroft needs my help again as usual, so... you know... make use of it".
"Yes?"
"That man was aiming at me-"
Sitting down at the edge of the bed, he pulled back the covers until a messy head of black curls appeared, and red-rimmed eyes blinked blearily up at him, skin ashen and paler than death.
He smirked, "Yes. Into my penthouse in London... I don't know why you're so shocked looking, brother mine, it was you who advised it, after all".
Sure, he had a file as wide as his arm on him, detailing all the officer had done from the day he was born until now, but he wasn't foolish enough to believe that a binder could tell him everything about something, least of all everything about a particular human.
The bright police lights did little to brighten the dark evening, and did even less to reveal the features of the dead woman lying face down in the middle of the alleyway.
"Sherlock Holmes you will drink this lemsip or so help me god I will ring Mycroft!"
"Sherlock!" His flatmate snapped, "What on

"It's a
together if Mycroft did say so himself.
"Mycroft".
Lestrade watched in silent confusion as Mycroft left his apartment bock three stories below and quickly walked to the awaiting non-descript black car that pulled up the curb with perfect timing.
"Meaning it's just for him that your force yourself to throw up, is it?" He shot back, turning to face her fully, "You believe it yourself".

Thankfully finding the books organised by authors last names, he began searching, holding his breath as he trailed his finger along La... Le... Li... Lu-
The doctor wanted to throw himself at the genius, but was only able to twitch a finger.
He glanced over at her, the deep flush visible even under such a dim light, "... Everything".
He could already feel his barriers crashing down, and the tidal waves of emotion were all telling him to do the same one identical thing.
"See you, Holmes..."
"DI Les-"
Scrolling down, he read the message and couldn't help but smile.
"Your language is rather-"
She swallowed thickly, suddenly nervously, "Well... I mean... I could always... show you with-"

That would just be preposterous.

"Why?!"

And use it, he did.
John immediately relented.
He abruptly stopped.
Sighing fondly at the comatose detective, John made his way to the kitchen, wondering if there was enough milk left for lunch.
Molly pulled a perfectly made knot out of her mouth.
“John?” Sherlock asked as soon as the shorter man in his arms began to stir. John had slept close to him all night, his face snuggled against Sherlock’s chest. He had listened to Sherlock’s heartbeat and breathing, his right arm curled tightly around Sherlock’s waist to keep him close and feel the warmth of his bare skin reassuringly under his fingertips. He hadn’t said a single word about anything Sherlock had deduced, not even when hot, seemingly unstoppable tears he hadn’t allowed himself to cry for far too long had painted both his face and Sherlock’s chest wet. John had cried and shaken in Sherlock’s arms and Sherlock had let him. He hadn’t said anything in turn, just wrapped his arms even tighter around John’s trembling body and placed soft, loving kisses on top of his head. After a while they’d fallen asleep like that.
“Can I publish the case now?” John asked, hoping that he hadn’t spent the last hour of writing in vain.
“Obviously,” Sherlock replied but couldn’t be arsed to look at him.
Suddenly, a new flood of tears was spilling out of Sherlock’s eyes and he did not know how to stop it. He had disappointed John. His loving, caring, protective boyfriend had tried to keep him save and he had disappointed him. The unpleasant feeling settled heavily in his mind palace.
. No, they’d sorted that one out resolutely.
to say the least, but something about John’s behaviour was off. Emotions were never easy to analyse – let alone when they affected him on a personal level – so Sherlock replayed the events in his mind to work to the core of the problem.
“Spread your legs a bit more and place your hands on the armrests, I want you to keep them there until the scene is over.” Sherlock obeyed him immediately. “Good boy.”
!” John babbled incoherently.
Sherlock knew that it wouldn’t be an easy task, but he could manage. He started with John’s balls, sucking them into his mouth through the fabric and
“What? Why?” John looked up from his laptop. He was writing on a blog entry about the upcoming veteran reunion since the only results of going over their case for hours had been a very disgruntled Sherlock and a mild headache for his part.
The answer he got an hour later was much longer than expected but also very helpful. He sent back a short thank you of sorts, then typed another text message for John.
“Don’t be daft, John, of course it’s my stupid brother!” Sherlock’s expression became softer when he looked at John again. “You look surprised. Why?”
“Shh, it’s all fine, love. You’re with me now, I’ve got you.” John carded his left hand soothingly through Sherlock’s hair. “You’re still alive, you’re still breathing and I’ll always keep you safe, my sweet, beautiful boy.” It took a couple of minutes till Sherlock’s sobs faded to hiccoughing breaths, but John waited patiently. He helped him calm down with gentle, caressing touches and reassuring words until Sherlock was breathing evenly against his chest in a doze-like state.
“I was bored,” he explained with a shrug and again concentrated his attention on the drop of liquid under the microscope.
John smiled as he flicked his tongue over the slit and tasted Sherlock’s bitter precome. He could think of a couple of ways to make Sherlock aware of his authority.
"Cause of death?"
The resulting flinch was the only answer he needed.
"Good shot".
Mycroft felt his heart freeze.
He pushed himself to his feet, straightening his jacket.
John threw his hands in the air. "What the
When he saw Mycroft hovering protectively over his victim, however, he scowled and raised his gun, pulling the trigger as he aimed for the younger man's head.
"... Her friend that's a boy?"
Mycroft blinked at him, silent, and the detective found himself rambling before he could stop himself.
one person be so
She smiled back, their foreheads still touching, "And what would that be, then?"
The detective sighed and obeyed, shutting his mouth as he leant back, and stared the forensic scientist in the eye, daring him to move.
"I'm scared".
John pinched the bridge of his nose and closed his eyes, willing himself not to kill the genius with his bare hands there and then.
"That was rhetorical!" He snapped, "I thought Mycroft had this place bugged?"
"So how do
... No-"
The lump shivered.
"Yes".
She stared, "... Excuse me?"
"Your girlfriend" He repeated, "She's cheating on you. With..."
He pouted, "But now you have each other! I can't call you in the middle of the night for a case anymore, knowing that

of Sherlock...
Except this time, he couldn't ignore it.
"What?"
Taking a deep breath, Sherlock slowly reached forwards and pushed open the door.
Sherlock solves it, of course, just as he solves every case thrown their way, and John briefly wonders what will happen when one day it's their own murders that they're looking at.
"About?"
" He growled, stalking forwards to grab his collar, "Where the
"No, it wasn't, and you know it" She snapped, "Just because there currently isn't a sniper pointed at Lestrade's head doesn't mean you're any less willing to lay down your life for him".
"I can imagine" He replied sympathetically, "Mycroft's even more emotionally buttoned-up than that moron in the shower. I'm surprised he even gave in and kissed you to begin with".
"Rosie, please, will you just listen to me-"
"One day just showing up won't be enough" Donavon finished, "One day we'll be standing round a body, and he'll be the one that put it there".
culprit... after we've gone to the potty".
That had only taken half an hour, as the elder Holmes was rather adapt at hacking into various cameras around London, and Greg had dealt with the perpetrators before and had made a list of their usual haunts.
"John-"
He reluctantly slowed to a stop and turned to face his fellow classmate, "Yes, Graham?"
He frowned, confused, "But I already have your number".
When she finally did find him on the dark roof, she huffed annoyed, and collapsed down next to him.
me? Why couldn't you- What could have
Sherlock and John both turned to him, the former looked the most insulted they had ever seen him and the later doing his best to pull a 'hey! watch it, mate' look on his face.
"But...?"
"Of my sister sitting next to your friend" Mycroft explained, "You were jealous, because you thought she'd stolen him from you... That's why you tried to fight her. To win him back".
He turned back to the boy, "What is your name?"
Sherlock who spent the last three years pretending to be dead.
"Well, you'd know".
"I can't afford London on an Army pension".
He quickly raised an arm against the blinding light that was abruptly shone in his face.
No matter what his illogical feelings were towards the older man.
"Most definitely".
"Oh, don't worry, it's not just you, most people are".
"Hang on, Mycroft? Your brother? What has he got to do with this?"
"Probably something about trying to make friends" the younger brother replied, and the elder nodded, "Oh, yes.
John.
"Fine. He's gone. What's wrong?"
"Oh please" He scoffed, "As if you take crime scenes seriously anyway".
Rachel :)
She slowly reached forwards and picked up another cherry, beyond confused, and placed it in her mouth.
"A binder" He couldn't help but correct, "I... I have one on everyone who comes into contact with Sherlock".
It was time, perhaps, to dig up some blackmail.
" She screamed, storming down the hall, "
They stared at each other in silent for an entire minute, before the elder Holmes nodded, "Right. Yes. Of course, I'll... I'll make the necessary requirements... When are you free to leave?"
... telling you to do?"
And, actually, speaking of John, where he is?"
Sherlock?
"What do you mean 'I don't know how to'?" He exclaimed, "Mycroft, just what
Silence.
"... No, Sherlock" He eventually replied, gathering the small boy back in his arms, "You may be many things... but a freak most

And if later that night, after Mycroft brought him home, after the police were called off, after Mummy simultaneously screamed at him in anger and cried tears of joy, he went up to his room, bone-tired, and found a book labelled
"Yes, here! He broke in for some unknown reason and found me making breakfast in the kitchen in my boxers!"
He heard muttered curses as a key was shoved into the lock of the metal door, before suddenly it was flung open and his senses were filled with-
"Then stop fussing!"
Sherlock bumped shoulders with him and he suddenly realised that he'd just taken a life for this man.
John slowly put down his coat and glanced over at his flatmate, "... I'm sorry, what?"
He briefly entertained the idea of shoving a pen into the man's large neck.
Anderson stood next to him, looking decidedly nervous, and he quickly schooled his features into casual friendliness, "Sure. Is it about the case?"
to act like you have a brain!"
His gaze drifted past to land on the palest of the group, "Him".
And what a better time to do it that on Halloween night?
The police officer's smile slowly fell.
It never came.
"Oh, I haven't even
with you-"
Sherlock stared at him.
"I'll jus' throw it up, not worth it".
She wasn't a bad person, after all, just... useless.
"My name is not 'freak'" He replied quietly, and the boy laughed, "Oh, it isn't, is it?"
about my family,
The bundle in the middle of the bed shivered once more.
Waiting until she had left the room, John turned back to his flatmate, "... Is she insinuating that you punched Kyle in the face?"
"And where did it-"
"DI Lestrade, to what do I owe the pleasure?"
"... Mycroft knows?"
not to do so many times? It wasn't
"... He was delivered to me. By post. I don't know who sent him".

"... What does love feel like?" He whispered.

"Greg".
Steeling himself just outside the bookstore, Lestrade swore for the millionth time that hour of how unfair it was that the insufferable bastard was right.
He merely blinked in response, "So it is".
And besides.
"Then reread them!"
Not sure if it's exactly what you wanted, but I hope you enjoy all the same!
Walking down the hall, he paused at the first door.
"Everything!
But maybe she doesn't know anything.
"... Was that not-"
Sherlock scowled, blinking back the tears, and allowed himself to take in everything about the grinning teen in front of him, blocking out his 'friends' taunts and jeers and
with the majority of the football team. And your father's an alcohol. And he doesn't love your mother, he only stays for you and your sister's sake. And your mother hates being tied down by you. And-"
He found the detective sitting in the back of an ambulance, his eyes closed in exhaustion, and for a split second, he had to stop and prevent himself from running over there and hugging the clearly pained detective.
"Dilated pupils, stiff muscles, blue lips, loss of motor control, and no coordination" He continued, "Focus, John, what does mean?!"
But then again, Lestrade realised, he didn't actually know all that much about the man he called a friend.
"... Why's Geoff on the floor?"
He started feeling the effects almost immediately, as his breathing hitched and his mind got fuzzy, and he was distantly aware of falling back and hitting his head off something sharp.
One rather smug text from Anthea.
"Suddenly came down with the flu" came the no-nonsense response, "The firm sent me instead".
Half a minute later, she pulled back out the stem, only for it to once more be tied in a perfect knot.
"I said I'm fine, Mycroft!"
It'd do good to stand out here all day.
Though, of course, that could have partly done with the bloody murder that was written across bother their faces if they found Sherlock with even just one hair out of place.
"Stop it".
"Yes".
"Jessica?" Mycroft's lips curled in disgust as he straightened up resolutely, "Oh, heavens no. No sibling of mine will have such a boring
He frowned, twisting around in his brother's embrace, "Mycroft? What are you doing here?"
The store would be closing soon enough and despite his urge to chat up the cute blonde, he really

He hummed thoughtfully, "Though I suppose your friend knew all this, based on his expression, and wanted to see you fight. You're close, a bit
"It's a bloody
If it were anyone else, she'd call it arrogance.
The man didn't even bother to correct him.
His voice was rough, brittle, and he coughed immediately after.
"You're just jealous".
After John had woken up, a full four days after his rescue, he hadn't let on that he'd heard Sherlock's every word while unconscious, and the younger man hadn't mentioned it again.
"Police! Put your hands where I can see them!"
He frowned, "The Yard? As in... Scotland Yard? You want to be a detective?"

His face must say it all because suddenly everyone else is turning to follow his gaze. There's loud gasps and wide eyes and one woman down back actually faints but all this does is let John know that
She couldn't help but smile back in return, "So, now what?"

of blankets.
"What?"
Being invited to stay the night at Lestrade's, for example, was certainly unpredictable.
Sighing, he gave the man an irritated look before reluctantly signing for the package, commenting on his affair with the gardener, and promptly slamming the door shut as the man attempted to take a furious swing at him.
Rosie choked on her drink.
"It's nice to meet you, sir. Rosie's told me a lot about you".
There was a man staring back down at her.
Mary was pointing a gun at his head.
"... Yes".
John stared at them for a moment, seeming to be in shock, and the elder Holmes growled, "John Watson you are the
The detective glared, picking it up as he stood, "Fine. I

The younger Holmes, however, ignored him, and continued to look expectantly at his brother, "Well? Are you engaged yet?"
She glanced up at him and frowned.
"I know who the murderer is".
"Yes" came the quiet response, eyes still locked with John's, "And you can cancel that ambulance... I've got my own doctor back".
But that split second was all that Sherlock needed.
He sighed and rolled his eyes, "You're in a hospital bed, Sherlock. You are far from
"Yes!" He exclaimed, unable to fight back his wide grin any longer, and the younger man stared at him as if he were mad, "And you... you... you're

Lestrade slowly blinked as Donavon frowned and Anderson glanced around the flat cautiously.
"What is it
"Of course,
To his surprise, Mike laughed.
"I think..." He began carefully, even as he pulled her impossibly closer, "I think, Molly Hooper, that I'm in love with you".
A burst of gunfire from outside the cell, had all three men flinching away from the door, just as a bloody yet grinning stranger ran in.
Lestrade swallowed thickly, pinned in place by the man's startling gaze.
"What about it?"
at that medical conference, I have to get it myself.
The body parts in the fridge, for example, were all obviously part of Sherlock's experiments, and not because John thought the eyes of his latest victim were simply too pretty to let go of just yet.
He raised a solitary eyebrow, "Really?"
Now, though...
Molly stared up at him, taking in his now-frazzled appearance, all wild eyes and even wilder hair, and couldn't help but smile even as the first tear rolled down her cheek.
He had commented on her weight again.
Shaking her head, she wiped the her mouth, flushed the toilet, and then sat down on the closed lid.
"I don't... What do you mean, move in with you?"
Rachel :)
Greg stared up at him cautiously, noting his slick hair and sharp suit, and wondered just how, exactly, a man of his stature worked for such a measly firm.
And being punched in the face and then offered a quiet night in by a man he hardly knew, was about as strange as the logical and predictive Holmes could deal with.
Turning back around to face his flatmate, he found that he still hadn't moved an inch.
"You're nothing but a freak!" the boy spat, "A stupid, worthless,
He had only just poured the boiling water into the mug when he heard a thud next to him, and John jumped, spinning around and almost spilling the kettle all over himself only to find that Sherlock had migrated from his room, and had just collapsed on the couch.
"She left for her sisters four hours ago".
He slowly nodded, "Alright... But I expect a good case in way of apology, Gavin!"
And he did.
It wasn't like she didn't deserve this, after all.
The younger man blushed adorably and marked the page in the thick volume he was reading, "Can I help you find something?"
"I don't care about what I can find out about you myself" He panted, trailing kisses down his already-bruised neck, "I only care about what you can tell me".
"Hello".
Because, really, he should have been.
sleep, idiot" came the snappish reply, and Lestrade sighed, "Look, guys, I'm too tired to be dealing with your bickering right now. Sherlock, get dressed, we've got a corpse in the river Thames and no idea who put it there".
"... Is that what they used to call you, then?" He eventually asked, voice taught with anger, "A freak?"
voice?!
A job well done, he believed.
"Well what about Sherlock?"
Next to him, Mycroft sighed petulantly, "She'll still be here tomorrow, you know".
"Isambard!"
Sherlock didn't avert his gaze, nor move his head from his hands as he repeated, "Kill. Her".
Sherlock liked to think that he'd won.
Turning back to the body, the ex-soldier bit back a smile as Anderson stared after the detective with a slightly worried expression on his face.
They schemed for the rest of the night and set their plan in motion the very next day.
"No" He interrupted, "No no no no no...
He slowly nodded, carefully placing down the tea cup as it began to rattle in his tight grip.
He shifted on the uncomfortable tarmacked roof, "I just... I thought you might be hungry. You usually have finished eating by now, so..."
, you don’t get jerk yourself off while I’m fucking you!” John hissed and tightened his grip on Sherlock’s hand. He underlined his point with a couple of particularly rough thrusts.
harder to wrap up than anticipated. He made an indifferent sound.
'I could ask you the same,' John thought, but then again everything Sherlock did had some kind of purpose.
Sherlock let the blue dressing gown slide off his shoulders and placed it over the armrest of the sofa. He unzipped his trousers and shuffled them off just as quickly, then efficiently unbuttoned his shirt to get rid of that as well. The black boxer briefs were tented by a massive erection and Sherlock sighed when he finally took off the restricting fabric.
! FUCK, you’re making me come, sir!”
John’s look became serious. “Yes.”
John’s mouth gaped open and his eyes couldn’t decide which of the two men to focus on, but he didn’t say anything. For whatever reason, Greg’s relationship really seemed to get to Sherlock. Greg looked a bit embarrassed due to John’s presence, but neither he nor Sherlock cared to elaborate. He hadn’t had the chance to ask Greg about it the last time it came up, but he’d definitely ask Sherlock about it as soon as they got home again.
John gave him a stern look. “Right... You wait here,
when they weren’t playing, but Sherlock found it appropriate. “Not sure about you, though…” he placed wet, open-mouthed kisses on John’s pecs, sternum and abs. By the time Sherlock reached his lower belly, John was struggling to breathe evenly.
“I won’t have you fainting from exhaustion again.”
John eventually stood up from the sofa, stretched and went past Sherlock on his way to Sherlock’s bedroom…

“John, you– your pants are…” he blankly stared at the red fabric clinging to John’s erection tightly.
, every single one of those things, but he had no bloody idea how to ask for it! He would have to
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably on the bed. “I’m sorry for that, John, but would you please just…”
“Looking for this, love?” he asked with a grin.
“Escape? No, no, no, I’m sure he went to Seville to enjoy the nice weather! Of course he would try to escape!”
“Come on, pet. You know the rules. Thank me properly or we’ll start over.”
“Let me,” Sherlock insisted and helped him plug in the phone. John put his hand over Sherlock’s, hesitating when Sherlock kept the phone clutched tightly. “John, when you read my message, whatever you think about it… let’s talk in the morning. Please,” he begged and slowly let go of John’s mobile.
The steady pulsing sensation in his cock became more insistent and if John didn’t come soon, he would, too. Sherlock moaned around John’s cock, pressed two fingers against John’s perineum and rubbed gently, stimulating his prostate from the outside.
,” he begged, but that wasn’t quite what John wanted to hear.
“Then we’re even now. Do you think you can keep your latest promise? That you quit for good?”
“Yes, sir.”
“I won’t come, sir,” Sherlock said determinedly and looked straight at John. It felt a bit weird, calling his boyfriend
voice,' he thought giddily with a mix of adrenaline and arousal.
“Sherlock?” the shorter man whispered and looked up at his boyfriend questioningly.
“Watch out!” Sherlock called as soon as he realised the man’s intention, but it was too late.
“Yes! John, I swear I’ll never touch a cigarette in my life ever again if it means losing you!”
“Harder,” he demanded breathlessly and John did indeed speed up, but it wasn’t enough; Sherlock needed more, he needed…
Just as expected, John woke up as soon as he could feel the familiar weight of Sherlock’s body sink onto the mattress next to him. Instinctively he turned to his side, cupped Sherlock’s jawline with his left hand and pressed an affectionate kiss against the other man’s soft, hot lips. Sherlock kissed him back enthusiastically and John broke the kiss with a smile.

“I’m okay with most names unless they’re downright humiliating or insulting. You can use belittling ones, but don’t
Sherlock sighed. “Fine, I do have a military kink and I rather liked the way you took charge of that, but can we just…” Sherlock made a small pause, searching for the right words, “…go from there and
John looked thoroughly debauched. A thin sheen of sweat covered most of his upper body and his stomach was quickly falling and heaving with laboured, panting breaths. Sherlock lay down next to John and looked at him adoringly.
“I’m not, but I’m not going anywhere either. I just want to be close to you if you let me.”
“John, I’m sorry. Please believe me, I really am. But this is… you’re driving me insane!”
“Then explain it to me. Please?” He looked at John hopefully.
“Yeah, of course, love,” John said tiredly and wrapped his arm around Sherlock’s waist when Sherlock snuggled up to him. “What about the tears? Are you ok?”
without your explicit consent, scene or not. Is that clear, Sherlock?”
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered barely audible, but his voice was full of affection. He said it again and again as if to convince himself that he had finally said it after all those years. A constant, soft stream of whispered “I love you, I love you,
“Oh, fuck, I’m so close. John, I’m…
John draped the soft fabric over Sherlock’s eyes and tied the ends together behind his head. He placed a hand on the small of Sherlock’s back. “Follow me.” John walked closely beside Sherlock as he guided them to Sherlock’s chair by the fireplace. “Sit down, sweetheart.”
punish a sub when his own emotions still played into it. Sherlock trusted him, submitted to him freely, and John would be damned if he threw that gift away in a fit of rage. He reconsidered their negotiations and both their limits and felt his anger ease by the minute. John picked up the items and went back to the sitting room – this time, he was in the right headspace.
Mrs Hudson came out of her flat when she heard the front door close. “Oh, hello, John!” she greeted him and gave him a motherly hug as soon as he slipped off his dripping wet jacket. “Are you alright? You look terrible, dear!”

an accident. Through my experiments, I found out that her blood alcohol level was rather high, but the truly remarkable detail is that the amount of oxygen in her blood was impossibly high as well, or at least impossibly high for someone who
“You’re angry with me because I’ve embarrassed you in front of the whole squad with my deductions. We’re in your quarters and I am kneeling in front of you, completely naked. You’re tying my h-hands–“ Sherlock’s voice hitched as John swirled his tongue around the head of his cock, “my hands together behind my back because you don’t trust me not to touch myself. I’m absolutely gagging for it, but you’re touching yourself instead.”
Even the prospect of punishment seemed to get to Sherlock. John was glad that he had already planned out the details of the scene during the cab-ride because one look at Sherlock’s face would have been enough to destroy John’s plans if he had to make them now. “Give me your safeword.”
“Because it might help you understand what it feels like when the person you love completely ignores what you need most at that moment.”
“Someone like me?” John repeated, mentally steeling himself for a fight. He folded the newspaper he’d been trying to read and all but threw it on the coffee table.
Three hours and a Bond film later, John checked the rest of his emails and realised something he had been totally oblivious of before: Sherlock had only read that one particular message. All the other ones, some of them received before the invitation, some of them received afterwards, were still marked as unread. So why had this one caught Sherlock’s interest right away?
As it turned out, there were three hours of anxious waiting. Out of boredom, Sherlock had started a new experiment on the average growth rate of mould cultures under different amounts of oxygen, light and temperature. He tried to focus as best as he could, but he felt miserable when John wasn’t home by ten. He checked his phone for the umpteenth time, but nothing had changed. For some reason, John hadn’t even read the message yet! It wasn’t the first time that John was angry with him, but he had never ignored him so blatantly obviously. In fact, John never ignored him. He would become upset, give Sherlock some space and come back when they had both calmed down again. Being ignored was just…
Sherlock mumbled something unintelligible, but John could swear that it sounded like some sort of apology. He breathed a sigh, closed the short distance between them and reassuringly pressed his lips against Sherlock’s right temple in a short kiss.
John chose to ignore the insult. “Why are you so upset about Greg’s relationship?”
“Two days ago,” he admitted feebly.
John made a pensive sound. “I still need them for comparison. Your arse isn’t quite as red as I imagined. Can you take some more?” he asked and let the riding crop swish through the air for effect.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. There were, in fact, six different things that could have helped John deduce that they would stay in London. “We are only going to the airport to help Graham wrapping up the case.”
“See why we have to talk about it?” he asked quietly.
“Oh no, not
Sherlock stood up from the sofa and grabbed the nearest laptop. 'A new password? Really, John?' but it was only a matter of twenty seconds till he figured out the new one. The search results that turned up a few minutes later were consistent. He roughly understood what John was going through, but he had no idea what
. Sherlock was basically drooling with need by now.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock breathed. He was thankful that John helped him yet again to get into position. Moving gracefully with his wrists cuffed together behind his back was not as easy as he had thought it would be. Sherlock sighed when the plug shifted inside of him and nudged against his prostate with the changing posture.
It took a few seconds for Sherlock’s dazed mind to coordinate the movements, but he managed to lift his long legs over John’s shoulders. The new angle allowed John to fuck him deeper, to hit his prostate with every thrust. Sherlock groaned and reached for John’s head, drawing him down into a messy kiss. John could feel his orgasm building low in his spine, coiling tighter and tighter in his belly. “I’m gonna cum,” he panted into the minimal space between their lips, leaning back to fuck his boyfriend impossibly harder. He wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock, jerking him off in a rhythm that was just as frantic. Sherlock’s mouth fell open on a wordless moan and just when John thought he couldn’t possibly hold back a second longer, he felt Sherlock clamp down on his cock, watched thick ropes of come paint Sherlock’s chest and abdomen. John came with a loud groan, his cock buried balls-deep in Sherlock’s arse. He was faintly aware of the last spurts of Sherlock’s come running warmly over his fingers, the feeling of Sherlock’s cock softening in his hand. They both panted harshly, slowly coming down from their spectacular orgasms. John leaned forward and rested his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, ignoring the sticky mess between them. They could worry about cleaning up after their post-sex nap.
“He’ll better make it one of his bloody priorities!” John huffed. He was getting angry again, but he regretted it almost immediately when Mrs Hudson flinched a bit at his loud voice. “Sorry.”
For a while, John didn’t move a single bit. He simply kept on leaning against the fridge; his mind pleasantly confused, trying to make any sense of what had just happened. Sherlock had never even kissed him like that while working cases before! John took a steadying breath, but when he still didn’t move, Sherlock addressed the matter at hand without even looking at him.
Somehow, John’s voice was commanding and caring at the same time.
“Sherlock?” John asked mildly confused.
John was positively surprised by Sherlock’s answer. He let go of Sherlock’s hair and carded his fingers through the ruffled curls instead. “Precisely. I think you’re in the right mind-set now, sweetheart. Stand up and go to the sofa, I’ll need you on your knees again for the next part. Face towards the wall, place your arms on the backrest.”
Sherlock was sitting at the kitchen table of 221B, working on an experiment, when he heard John’s slightly unnerved voice from the sitting room – something that he had been waiting for since…
John opened the bottle of lube and drizzled some of it straight onto Sherlock’s cock. The detective hissed when the cold gel touched his skin and bucked his hips involuntarily. John poured some more lube onto his left palm and wrapped it around Sherlock’s cock. The detective groaned and felt his mind relax a bit. He watched the slow glide of John’s fist over his cock, unable to focus on anything else.
John coaxed another moan out of his shivering, gasping boyfriend when he moved the finger inside of Sherlock in thrusting and bending movements until he felt Sherlock relax around it. After a while, John added a second finger to carefully work Sherlock loose and open and Sherlock responded beautifully by digging his heels into the sheets and trying to push himself even further down on John’s fingers. Sherlock cursed and writhed on the mattress, broken moans fell from his lips and made John’s cock throb in sympathy, but he’d never forgive himself if he rushed through this and hurt Sherlock because of his own impatient eagerness. By the time John decided to add a third finger, Sherlock’s breathing was already reduced to harsh, panting breaths and when John traced light circles around Sherlock’s prostate without actually touching it, Sherlock couldn’t hold back a litany of needy whimpers.
Cons: Perhaps John would even wear his old uniform and the mere thought of it left Sherlock hard and wanting. There was no way he could possibly survive the evening without embarrassing himself or his boyfriend if John decided to wear his uniform.
John stepped back and picked up the riding crop with his right hand, shifting his stance to get a good angle. “I know that you enjoy a good cropping for fun, Sherlock, and we’ll get to that later. But right now, it’s time to punish that impossible behaviour of yours. Telling me to ‘fuck off’? Not a good idea. Not a good idea
He considered the options. It was either a casual evening with some of his friend and a few pints or more wandering about the city and worrying himself sick over Sherlock and their kinky dynamics. “Sounds good,” John gladly accepted the offer. A little distraction from the problem at hand was more than welcome.
Sherlock loosened his grip on John’s cock and fondled his balls instead. With each downwards movement he took more and more of John’s cock into his mouth and he varied the amount of suction with each upwards movement. John was a writhing, groaning mess and eventually his hips jerked up on their own accord. He wasn’t impatient per se, just unable not to thrust into the tight, slick heat.
God, John always became sentimental when drunk. Sherlock shushed him with a quick kiss. “Tomorrow, John, trust me. There are quite a few things I want to say, but if I say them now, you probably won’t remember half of it in the morning. You deserve to hear and remember
“Would you like to have a cuppa? I have a freshly brewed pot of tea and some biscuits, too.”
“Boring, dull, predictable… I know all the details! Why would I read about something I already know?” Sherlock complained. He sat up as he noticed the single cup of tea on the coffee table (one of Mrs Hudson’s) and sniffed at it. English breakfast tea, no milk but at least one spoonful of sugar. John had made it for him, then.
“It’s just… all those things you implied when…” John trailed off and looked away in embarrassment.
“Good.” He let his gaze roam over Sherlock’s body: his soft blackish-brown curls, sharp cheekbones, enticing lips; the way his too tight button-down shirt accentuated his long, pale throat, lean muscles, peaked nipples… “Strip.”
, John decided. He’d talk about it before they’d go to the reunion together. John felt a little more confident when the cab pulled up at the kerb outside of 221B.  He gave a twenty pound note to the cabbie and quickly hurried inside through the drenching rain.
Sherlock licked and nibbled at the outline of John’s cock through his pants, all the while looking up at him. “Can I suck you off? Please let me suck you off, John,” he demanded, voice sounding innocent and completely at odds with the way he teased him.
“Oh, God yes!” Sherlock moaned when the next smacks covered every inch of his pale bum, hard enough to leave visible handprints. After the first twenty smacks John admired his handiwork. Judging by the beautiful sounds Sherlock had made, he needed more. However, John’s hand was beginning to sting quite a bit.
amazing John.
“You’ve really earned this reward, sweetheart, but there’s something you can do for me in turn.” His hot breath brushed against Sherlock’s cock as he spoke.
“It’s filthy and humiliating and you don’t keep that threat, but you know that it makes me even harder… nnngh, I’m close, sir. Please…
“It’s yours, but it’s probably cold by now,” John explained and closed the lid of his laptop. “I could make you a fresh cuppa if you like.”
” fell from his lips until they brushed against John’s lips and instead of backing away, instead of insisting that they were just friends – had always been
“Alright,” John answered in a carefree tone of voice but eyed him suspiciously before he went back into the sitting room. Compared to Sherlock, the ex-army doctor was as observant as a hedgehog, but the way he had looked at his boyfriend a minute ago was proof enough that he had indeed noticed that Sherlock was all but focusing on his oh so important experiment. How could he possibly stay focused on anything now that an image of

pissed off. “Keep talking like that and I’ll give a very clear idea what I’m capable of as a Dom. You think I can’t handle bratty behaviour?” John’s voice was dangerously low, but it didn’t affect Sherlock in the slightest.
Lestrade nodded understandingly. “Why don’t you just join me and the others? Drinking, chatting… the average Thursday afternoon. You look like you could need a pint or two.”
“Alright, Sherlock. You asked for this,” John teased, but his voice was stern. Instead of the punishing rhythm Sherlock was mentally bracing himself for, John circled his hips languidly in small, grinding thrusts that drove Sherlock out of his mind with want.
a lovely way to wake up,” he mumbled drowsily and nudged his head into John’s hand like a touch-starved cat. John smirked and elicited a low, contented sound from his boyfriend when he scratched his fingernails lightly over Sherlock’s scalp. “Don’t stop!” the younger man complained when John eventually withdrew his hand.
Mycroft’s voice echoed through the halls of his mind palace.
“John?” Sherlock asked quickly before his Dom could stand up and looked at him with dilated pupils. The pain of the punishment made him drift around the edges of subspace, but it was just out of reach.
“Believe me, I’m only getting started–” before Sherlock had a chance to finish his sentence, Thomas tried to pull the trigger, but the gun only made a clicking sound with the safety still on. John and the other police officers quickly drew their weapons as well, but they didn’t get a proper chance to aim at the man who was already disappearing into the dumbfounded crowds. Sherlock didn’t have to think twice.
Oh, at least
“I could get used to doing this every day,” John said and smiled.
Sherlock smiled at him. “Very good, John.”
John chuckled. “You’re still not allowed to come, sweetheart.” His voice became stern: “… and I’ll have to punish you if you do anyway.”
“Remember when you said that Lestrade can manage the case on his own? You might want to take that back now.”
let me kiss you now?”
John walked around him and knelt down to uncuff Sherlock’s hands. Due to the soft leather padding there were no marks on Sherlock’s wrists, but John massaged them nonetheless. He whispered into Sherlock’s ear: “I think you’ve learned your lesson for today, but the scene isn’t over just yet. When I let go of your wrists, I want you to move to the sofa and lie down on your back. Put your arms and legs into whatever position is most comfortable for you right now. Can you do this for me?”
Sherlock struggled to keep still whenever John’s lips moved anywhere near his groin, but they never quite touched his cock. Without warning John licked over a small patch of skin on Sherlock’s inner thigh. Before Sherlock had time to process John’s intention, he was already sucking a love bite into the delicate skin. Sherlock’s hips involuntarily jerked up a bit and he mewled in frustration. John licked over the reddened skin once more, sat up and looked at Sherlock’s swollen cock. “Poor boy, you want to come so badly, don’t you?”
“Oh fffuck, Sherlock!” John was done for. He came hard all over his abdomen and hand, but he didn’t allow himself to ride out the afterwaves of his intense orgasm. Instead, he wrapped his hand around Sherlock’s cock, using his own come as lubricant to reduce the friction. Sherlock squirmed under the touch, but he obediently kept his hands on the armrests.
“Sherlock…” John growled dangerously low, but the mad genius wouldn’t listen.
Watson haunted his mind palace?
John’s question turned the warm, tingling sensation in Sherlock’s lower abdomen into a roaring fire. “Yes, sir. Yes, I’m– OOOH YES!” Sherlock cried out and for a split second he was afraid that he couldn’t hold the impending orgasm back. John turned the plug off just in time and watched as Sherlock’s body struggled hard to let go of its slowly receding orgasm.
“Three times, John.”
“Spain?!” Sherlock repeated incredulously. “How the hell did he even leave the UK?”
There was a short moment where they were both rather surprised by how naturally they fell into this roleplay. Sherlock had let nothing on about this particular kink in the past, not that John had noticed.
Sherlock swallowed and took a deep breath before he opened his eyes again. Some things just wouldn’t stay buried in the basement of his mind palace after all. “I’ve got a bit of a history when it comes to my military kink and the BDSM-ish relationship that followed. Things didn’t end well for me last time.”
John had no alternative but to run after the killer as well in order to protect Sherlock. He still had his service gun, now tightly clutched in his left hand, and was ready to use it if he had to. Sherlock knew that as well, but that didn’t give him a bloody reason to run after an armed murderer!
John gave him a reassuring smile. “That’s nothing to be ashamed of. Go on.”
Sherlock felt his patience for talking this through become thinner by the minute. “That’s a natural response of my body when I’m in subspace. I can’t control it.” God, talking about this was even more tedious than talking about Lestrade and his brother! Why did John sound so sceptical?
Sherlock flicked his tongue sheepishly against the base of John’s cock and traced the thick vein on the underside with only the very tip of his tongue. John moaned as Sherlock rubbed his tongue against the frenulum. His cock demandingly twitched upwards against Sherlock’s mouth, but he didn’t take it between his lips just yet. He let his saliva gather before he started at the base again, this time flattening his tongue to slick up as much of John’s length as possible. Sherlock looked up and met John’s needy gaze as he closed his lips around the head and sucked gently. He alternated between sucking and licking at the sensitive glans and John tilted his head back, his mouth falling open on a wordless moan. Sherlock dipped his tongue into the slit and hummed around John’s length when even more precome spilled into his mouth. The mostly bitter tang of it made his own cock pulse and twitch against his pyjama bottoms. Sherlock wondered for a brief moment whether he could actually come from sucking John off alone. Whether his arousal could also peak in an overwhelming orgasm only from tasting and swallowing John’s hot, salty come. He groaned at the thought; coming in his pants would play well into his humiliation kink.
Mycroft rolled his eyes at him in all his 11-year-old glory, "Oh, don't be smart".
"I... No, no, I was... I was not aware" Greg floundered, trying to remember her mentioning anything of the sort.
"I'm fine, I'm fine, don't worry" He quickly replied, walking over to sit down across from the man, "Or... at least... I think I am".
"But it hurts!" He pouted, "I forgot how sore they were..."
"It could be in here" He finished, and the blonde nodded, tugging his yellow sweater sleeves down over his hands almost shyly, "I can help you look, if you like?"
Stopping outside the bedroom door, he paused briefly, before knocking, "Sherlock? You up yet?"

It was an entire week later that the unlikely pair met up again.
Reaching down, he picked the lock on the door in mere seconds, and silently slipped into the penthouse apartment.
Well.
Closing the door behind him, he paused, and smirked at the umbrella rack next to him.
Mike smiled, somewhat annoyed, but gestured towards a bench.
It took them almost an hour to find it, and Lestrade was about to call it quits when suddenly-
Finishing the cup, he wondered vaguely why Mycroft's hands were shaking.

The younger man quickly crouched down next to the dead woman, his movements still just as fluid and graceful as ever despite the three-year-old on his hip, much to the disappointment and envy of the officers surrounding the crime scene.

"Well this is ghastly" Mycroft announced after approximately 0.7 seconds of arriving at the playground.
"There. That's my number".

"I may not have that right" He said tightly, "But
"Hi".
Gregory was lying on the floor below him, unmoving.

The crowd riled up once more, and Mycroft subtly glanced past the angry boy to see Sherlock crouched down in front of Eurus, far away on the other side of the playground, with Greg standing guard in front of them, and a young girl, who he could only presume to be Greg's sister, talking quietly to his youngest sibling. And as if sensing his stare, his brother looked up, meeting his gaze squarely as he gave a small nod.

"Because the only person that I know of who regularly tries to hack my phone, is your brother. And my first name is the only thing on this planet that Sherlock Holmes does not know".
"I'd like it rare" He replied, "Very rare. In fact, you know what? Don't spend any more than five minutes cooking it. Oh, and make sure there's no garlic".
The gun was suddenly pressed into his forehead.

The younger man gave a small smile, "I know. I heard".

"Oh god. Mary" He said, abruptly letting go of the man's shirt and took a step back, turning to face his bride only for Sherlock to grab his arm and spin him back around, "No".

"Drugs?" She guessed, and he gazed down at her, almost curious, "Why do you say that?"

"When I get better, remind me to smother you in your sleep".

"That doesn't answer my question".
"Oh, no reason" He replied, his heart warmed to the core, "Just wondering, that's all".

He found himself heading towards his bedroom, the bed made perfectly, of course.

later as the Inspector wrapped up all arrests and send Sherlock's kidnappers away in patrol cars, that he had a chance to properly talk to the man himself.
John studied him closely.
The genius lurched forwards, flinging himself at the man with a loud snarl just as John managed to grab his arm to pull him back, and Anderson froze, shocked into place as-

"... Oh no".
Then it all happened very quickly.
He grinned, and took a step back into his apartment, "Come on, your nose needs seeing to, and I got takeaway".
He found himself putting on a charming smirk as he eyed up the sweater-wearing blonde, "Hello yourself".
He quickly cleared his throat to distract himself, "May I have your phone?"

"No it isn't. Didn't you get my text? I objected" He replied, "That alone should be reason enough for you

"You have to eat
You'd have better luck finding Waldo".
Sighing, the ex-soldier stepped forwards, managing to catch the tiny beast in his hands, before quickly walking over to the window and throwing her out.
John sighed as Rosie giggled at her phone for the millionth time that hour, lost in a world of her own.
"... Mycroft Holmes kissed you?"
Well.
"She saw him with the redhead".
Waking up in a brightly-lit and sterilised room hadn't been much fun, as all his senses slowly came back to him one by one, forcefully dragging him back from the warm embrace he'd laid in.
The younger Holmes sighed and reached down, his thin body betraying his strength as he easily pulled the police officer to his feet.
Which could really only lead to one, painfully human, explanation.
"Sorry dad, love you, see you tomorrow morning!"
Now what was she doing that for?
"Hang on" Donovan said, suddenly looking up with a confused frown on her face.

Mycroft, with a split lip but proud grin, threw his arm around a shy-looking teen, "Mummy, I'd like to introduce you to Gregory".

"Yes".
He shivered.
When John returned home that night, well after six, he found the genius in the same position, long fingers clasped under his chin and eyes narrowed intensely at the harmless-looking plant.
The police officer cleared his throat, slowly lowering his 'weapon'.
John spun around to face the detective, "Did you just squeal?"
"Come on, who'd want me for a flatmate?"
The woman frowned.
Anthea turned to face him fully, "Mycroft. This is

Before he could question him, however, as that was exactly what his inner police officer was screaming at him to do, the judge strode into the room, and Greg spent the next hour trying desperately not to scream back at his wife.
"Are you... okay?"
"Does Friday suit?"
she's not a bloody assassin!"
Lestrade holstered his gun and crouched down to get a better look at them.
His frown only deepened, and with bated breath, he reached forwards and pushed open the door.
He reluctantly stood up, knowing that his work here was done, but couldn't help but pause at the sight of the detective's smile.
Sherlock grinned.
She shifted uncomfortably.

He laughed, "What could you do about it, kid? You saying you could take me on?"
Four and a half days into his capture, however, Scarface, as Sherlock had taken to calling him, burst into the basement and flung his phone at him.

Greg decided, admiring the man's tight trousers as he strode away,
He drifted in and out of semi-consciousness for what felt like forever, vaguely recalling injections and bandages and nurses and doctors and the only constant presence that remained was a familiar hand holding tightly onto his own.
"... No" He reluctantly admitted, and his brother nodded, "Exactly. So stop your fretting, it's illogical and rather unbecoming".
