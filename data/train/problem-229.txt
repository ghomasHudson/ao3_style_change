“Then there must be one that would allow me to change forms, like you.” A mix of emotions passed across Sherlock's face at John's words. He shook his head and placed his free hand on top of John's thigh and squeezed it,
“No, you don't understand. There is a way, yes. An ancient potion only few could brew successfully. I could do it John, but I don't want to.” John's shoulders drooped in hurt, and he dropped his eyes away from Sherlock's, no longer able to look at him.
“What do you mean?”
“I'm sorry?”
'Experiment or actual emergency?'
He had rowed for hours, the sun hot and high when he had caught sight of land. John was a bit surprised when the merman continued to lead him towards what appeared to be a small cove on a decent sized island. He could see a fort flying an English flag on its highest point. He certainly had had no idea what to expect when he left, but he had not anticipated being led toward land. The merman had stopped about 100 yards from shore to wait for John to catch up with him. When he arrived he gestured towards the small, deserted beach and slipped under the waves. John rowed until the water was about waist deep then he stowed the oars and hopped out, the cool water a welcome refreshment after sweating in the Caribbean sun for hours. As he pulled the boat towards shore he surveyed the island. The sand was pristine and white, a lush line of jungle flora creating a small crescent shaped beach. There were no signs that this beach was frequently used, no dock or even post to tie his boat to, and no obvious path through the jungle to access the beach from inland. The only sign that the beach had ever seen human use was a small wooden structure against the treeline on the northeast side.
'For what?' He asked with an impish grin on his face. John rolled his eyes and smiled.
'Nothing.'
“Can you read this?” John turned to the page he had written that morning, paragraphs in English describing his time at the cottage. Sherlock squinted at the words, then shook his head no. “So, you speak Latin then? Or a derivative of it?”
“I can't. I cannot do this to you, John.”
“Who am I, John?” he asked, his voice adopting a serious tone. John looked up from his mending to glance at him.
“Sherlock.”
“God above,” he whispered to himself. Peering back up at him was a man. He was alarmingly pale, his hair forming dark curls on his forehead, but his eyes. His eyes were the colour of ice, blue and grey, and just as sharp. “Hello!” John called, snapping out of his reverie, “Do you need help?” Where had this man come from? Was there a shipwreck? Had he fallen overboard from another ship? The man's incredible eyes widened with fear when he heard John shout. After a pause, he slipped back under the water without replying. “You there!” John called again. Was the man drowning? Before he had a chance to call for the captain, he was forced into stunned silence. From the spot where the man had disappeared, the creature that he had seen the night before erupted from the waves, moving away from the ship with incredible speed. John watched with his mouth gaping open as he realised the man and the creature were one in the same. In the moonlight, he could see the pale complexion of the man's skin joined together with the great silvery-blue tail.  It couldn't be...could it?
“Good morning,” John smiled as Sherlock set the bag down on the wooden table. He replied with something that almost sounded like 'morning' as he unloaded two decent sized fish, some bananas, and another exotic fruit John didn't recognise. John stood and began searching the somewhat decently stocked pantry for something to skin the fish with. When he located a suitably sized knife he returned to the table only to give a yelp in surprise. Sherlock had sat himself down at the table and was biting into the raw fish, scales and all. He stopped and blinked at John, confusion crossing his face. John swallowed the bile that had risen in his throat. “Sorry. Didn't mean to startle you...it's just...most people cook their fish first.”
He set the paper down on the end table and picked up his mug, maybe another cuppa would bring an idea. Just as he was about to stand another noise erupted from the kitchen. This time it sounded like a small explosion. John left the mug on the table and hurried over. There stood Sherlock in front of the microwave which was billowing dark, thick smoke. A curious scent reminiscent of burnt rubber hung in the air. 'Christ, Sherlock.' John exclaimed. The tall, lanky detective turned towards his boyfriend, his eyes watering from the smoke which was still coming. Before he could say anything the fire alarm began to screech. John grabbed a tea towel and began fanning the smoke away as Sherlock opened the window. 'What was it this time?' John inquired, and Sherlock thought he detected a hint of annoyance in his tone.
'Yes.' he admitted sheepishly, a blush spreading across his face. A smile began in John's dark blue eyes that soon spread over his entire face.
“Sherlock.” John repeated. The merman gave a quick nod and resumed his path to the cottage. John smiled to himself and rushed to walk in stride next to the merman, to Sherlock.
'I wasn't sure which one would be best.' Sherlock offered. 'I bought seven. Then of course tested them all for durability. The sixth one failed yesterday.'
*~*~*~*
'Experiment.' He answered as the alarm blared on. He grabbed a second tea towel and began directing the smoke towards the open window. They heard the door to the flat open and then a familiar voice called out.
“We dock tomorrow,” he started. Would he understand what that meant? “It means that... it means that I will have to leave the ship and go on land.” He paused. He could practically see the merman mulling this over.  Then he pointed to John, then to the ship, and then shook his head no. “Yes, that's it.” John pointed to the ship and then the distant land. “The ship will be docked, and I will have to get off it.” At this, the merman shook his head no violently. “What do you mean, no? I...I have to go.” Again a violent shake of the head, then he pointed at John, then himself and then the water. “With you?” An enthusiastic nod followed. “I can't.” John shook his head and gestured at himself. “I can't,” he said a little louder. The merman repeated the same motions, indicating that he wanted John to go with him.  An idea slowly formed in John's head. If he could just get down to the merman's level, to talk with him face to face instead of shouting down at him, maybe he could get him to understand. He held up a hand, then pointed to one of the small rowboats on the upper deck. “Wait here.” The merman nodded in response and John ran up the stairs to the upper deck.
'I thought I'd ruined Christmas.' Sherlock wiped his eyes with his sleeve. John's face registered a moment of confusion and then he too began to laugh.
I found John's ship's name on Wiki and it was an actual British merchant vessel. I didn't do much research on it beyond that, but I am pretty sure it never had a doctor that abandoned ship to be with a merman ;)
John opened the box and inside was a brand new watch. The face was a gunmetal grey with bronze hands, the band was a mesh of the same colour. 'It's gorgeous. Thank you' John said, immediately putting it on.
Another fortnight passed in the same routine as before, with the exception of Sherlock spending more nights on land with John than in the water. As time went by however, John noticed that Sherlock spent longer staring blankly out at the ocean. Sometimes he would do this for hours at a time, forgetting to eat or not hearing John when he spoke. It worried John, and although Sherlock would assure him that he was fine any time he asked, he couldn't shake the nagging feeling that he was not fine.
'Okay, open.' Sherlock did as he was told and opened his eyes. When he saw what greeted them, he immediately began to laugh. Next to yesterday's offending microwave was a brand new, identical one wrapped in a red bow. Tears of laughter sprang to his eyes when he saw that they had been labeled. The one he thought had ruined Christmas was now labeled 'Food Only' and the brand new one was 'Science Only'. He turned towards John, laughter still rumbling through him.
The first night John saw it he could never have imagined what would follow. He had taken his journal and lantern to the deck, the night air cool against his face and the quiet a reprieve from the raucous noise below deck. He liked to write about his day before turning in for the evening. His journal was a hodgepodge of anecdotes, medical observations, weather reports and amateur sketches of birds and sea creatures. He was describing how he had stitched up the cabin boy’s hand after he had cut himself with a kitchen knife when he heard it. There was a sudden, loud splash off the starboard side of the ship.
'Experiment.' They both called out at the same time. Smiling they met each others eyes for a brief moment.
(See the end of the chapter for
“You mean, there isn't a way?” John's face fell in disappointment. He had been so confident that this was the answer.
“To you, John. Who am I, to you?” Oh. John was slightly taken back by this. Of course he had thought about it, but it wasn't that simple really. They certainly were more than friends, lovers sounded like something from a tragic opera, and they weren't betrothed or married. John thought a moment longer and then said,
One quiet evening, John sat at the table mending a hole in one of his shirts. Sherlock was splayed out on the bed intently studying one of John's older journals. He suddenly sat up and tossed the journal down.
When they did break apart, the merman repeated his motions from earlier, pointing to John, then himself, and then the sea. John's throat went dry and his stomach lurched. He looked back towards the ship, and then back to the beautiful man in front of him. Did he dare? “I...I want to. Dear god, I want to. But I'm not like you.” He glanced down at his legs and the merman's gaze followed. “I just don't see how it could work. We can't even talk, I...I.” The merman brought his hand to John's cheek, thumb stroking his lower lip. John trembled at the touch; god did he want to go with him. The merman took his hand from John's cheek and placed it on his knee, John's entire body flooding with heat when he did. The merman glanced at his hand and then nodded yes. “Yes? Can I still go? Even with legs?” Another nod, yes. “Then yes, yes I will go with you.” The merman smiled with his entire face. He planted a quick peck on John's lips and then pushed off the boat and into the water. He jumped and arched over the waves, just as he had done the first time John saw him. He surfaced momentarily to motion John to follow him, and then swam ahead, breaching again to show John where he was. John took up the oars and took a deep breath. He was uncertain of what was to come, but he was certain of what he was doing now. With a last look up at the ship, he followed the merman.
Breakfast was a mostly silent affair. John eyed Sherlock carefully as they ate, gauging his mood to see if he should propose his idea now or later. He decided to hold off until the afternoon, letting Sherlock take a long swim to hopefully clear his mind and help him feel a little better. When he had returned and situated himself on the bed with one of John's medical texts, John took a deep breath and began talking.
He scooted over to the very edge of the bench, so he could show him. He angled it towards him and the merman audibly gasped when he saw. He pointed to the drawing and then to himself.  “Yeah,” John chuckled. “It's you.” He flipped over to the next page where he had sketched individual parts of the merman and written descriptions beside them. The merman looked puzzled at this and scrunched his brow. “What?” John asked. The merman pointed to the words and narrowed his eyes even further. “Oh, that's what my language looks like written down. Those are my words...about you.” John's blush returned when the merman's face illuminated with joy. John turned to the page he had done the night before, a full page illustration of the merman leaping out of the water. He smiled so wide, John was certain his cheeks would burst if he tried to smile any bigger. “Do you like it?” The merman nodded enthusiastically, suddenly a soft “oh” escaped his lips. He held up a finger, as if to say 'wait a minute' and slipped beneath the water.
Just as he had the day before, Sherlock left the cottage around midnight and returned just as John was finishing up writing. He had his satchel slung across his bare chest, and simple linen trousers bunched at the knees, leaving the fins on his calves uncovered.
The merman shielded his face from the impending blow, making a quiet sound of surprise. John instantly put his hands up, palms flat when he realized just who had touched him. “Dear god!” he exclaimed, both from surprise and relief. “I'm sorry. I'm not going to hurt you!” He reached out and gingerly laid his hand on the man's bicep. “ You just startled me is all. I...didn't expect you to be...on land.” John's words trailed as his eyes took in what was in front of him. The merman was standing about 6 feet tall, a good few inches on John's own height. His dark curls were still wet and dripping, hanging loosely on his forehead. His bare chest and arms were also still wet, but quickly drying in the afternoon sun. What drew John's attention most was the long, slender legs that had replaced the silvery-blue tail. They went on for miles, John thought, and were the same porcelain white as the rest of him. There was one notable difference however; on the back of each of the man's calves he had a dorsal fin, just like the ones on his forearms, only a bit larger, and his long slender toes still had a bit of webbing between them.
His hands trembled as he made quick work of the knots. Was he really doing this? The captain would not be pleased, but sod the captain, this was important. With a grunt of exertion, John began to lower the row boat, the pulleys creaking to life. He grimaced at the amount of noise he was making, certain that someone would wake and discover him, but he kept on.  He breathed a sigh of relief when he heard the boat slap the water. As swiftly as he could, John tucked his journal into the waistband of his trousers. Then he flung the rope ladder over the edge and followed after it. He settled himself on the hard, wooden bench and began to row toward where he had told the merman to wait.
John awoke to warm sun on his face and the sound of gulls screeching and waves crashing. It took a few moments for him to realize he was no longer on a ship; his legs were still wobbly as he stood, having grown accustomed to the rocking of the sea. It was only his second morning in the cottage, but he already felt more at home here than he had in his cabin on the Albemarle. He padded across the packed dirt floor to the washstand and basin and splashed the cool water on his face, clearing away the last remnants of sleep.  He stoked the embers in the hearth and placed the kettle over the flames once he brought them back to life. As he waited for the kettle to boil he returned to his journal to continue chronicling what had happened since he followed the beautiful merman.
“Little.”
The merman nodded his acceptance and a charged silence settled over the pair. John spoke first, “I want to give you something, too. But I don't know what.” He looked around the boat; he had come down here without grabbing so much as a proper jacket, let alone anything he could give as a gift. An idea struck him, so he asked “Would you like one of my sketches? To keep?” This garnered an enthusiastic nod and John laughed as he tore the full page one from the binding of his journal. “Can you...can you keep it dry?” The merman rolled his eyes again and gestured to the bag he had handed John earlier. “Oh!” John folded the parchment and placed it in the bag and tightened the strings.  He handed it back to the merman, their hands brushing as he did. John inhaled sharply at the touch, his skin tingling where the merman's hand was on his. Neither of them bothered to move, though – it was as if time had stopped when they touched. John met the merman's ice-like gaze with his own, both of them searching for something in the other’s eyes. After a minute, though, the merman decided he had done enough searching. In a smooth movement he pushed himself up on extended arms, his knuckles turning white where hands gripped the sides of the boat. Without thinking John leant towards him, pausing for a brief moment, and then took those positively sinful lips with his own. The merman tasted like the sea, and kissed like it too, one minute rough and dangerous and the next moment calm and languid. When they finally broke apart, it was only to push their foreheads together, the merman's wet curls sending drops of water down John's face. “Gorgeous,” John whispered. “Absolutely gorgeous.” The merman made a low, throaty noise in response and John was glad he was seated, or his knees might have given way. John wasn't sure how long they stayed that way, he just knew that those incredible eyes made him feel alive for the first time in a long time.
'Eyes shut.' Sherlock obeyed. He felt John's hand grab his and his heart leapt. John pulled him up and lead him towards the kitchen. The desire to open his eyes was so strong,but he had to keep them shut, he had to let John have his moment. He could tell John had stopped him in front of the counter. Now he was positioning Sherlock in a precise spot. 'You ready?'
'Oh you utterly ridiculous man. Come here you.' He wrapped his arms around Sherlock's neck, buried his hands in his dark curls and stared into his light blue eyes. 'It's perfect. And this Christmas is perfect. And you are perfect.' Then he kissed him, long and deep and slow. Yup, John thought as they melted in to one another, definitely a Christmas to remember.
“You...you can read that?”
~*~*~*~
When he resurfaced a moment later he handed John a bag the size of a large coin purse. John couldn't identify the material, but it reminded him of a shiny dolphin. “For me?” he asked, and the merman rolled his eyes as if to say 'of course', but he also gave a sharp nod. John opened it gingerly and inside was the largest piece of sea glass John had ever seen. It was a deep blue, completely worn smooth by the waves. “Thank you.” John looked up. The merman pointed to the glass and then to John's face.  “Yes, it's for me, I know.” The merman shook his head, a perturbed look settling on his face. He pointed again to the sea glass, then at his own eyes, shook his head no and then pointed at John's face again.  John considered this for a moment and then took a sharp inhale. “My eyes?” He asked. “You got this for me because it's the colour of my eyes?” The merman simply nodded as if this was the most obvious thing, and John should have understood sooner. “Wow, I...I don't know what to say. Thank you.”
'Wait a minute.' John looked up at Sherlock. 'Is that what you were doing with the microwave yesterday?'
~*~*~*~
Sherlock let out a sound that was somewhere between a laugh and a sob, then he brought John's mouth to his and kissed him hard, their tears mixing together on each other’s cheeks and coating their lips with a sharp, salty taste. They broke apart to catch their breath, but pressed their foreheads together, as if it were impossible for them to not be touching.
“This very second if it were possible.”
“I thought you loved me,” he whispered. Sherlock's hand shot out and grabbed John's chin. He tilted his head so that he met those ice blue eyes again.
“That's brilliant!” John laughed, rising to his feet as well. Sherlock beamed with pride as he wrapped John in his arms. John sighed in contentment, enjoying the strength he could feel in Sherlock's arms. When they broke apart, John began to laugh again. Sherlock blinked in confusion and waited for John to explain. “I was never very good at Latin in school.” John admitted through his giggles.
“We'll come back to that brother comment later.” Sherlock huffed at this, but didn't push the issue. “How long will it take to make it?”
“Loqueris?”
'Yes.'
'John?' he called, his mind beginning to spin horrible what-ifs.
“Yes!” Sherlock nodded his head in excitement, eyes bright.
John spent the entire next day sketching the creature...the merman, he supposed,  as best as he could recall. He wished he hadn't yelled last night. What if he had scared him off for good? He hoped he had not and for the third night, he returned to the deck after dinner. This evening, however, he chose one of the lower decks, closer to the water, hoping to get an even better look at the merman if he chose to show himself again. The moon was entirely full and almost directly overhead when John saw the man emerge from the waves. He swam toward the side of the ship, stopping only a few yards away. John held his finger to his lips, indicating that he would remain quiet. The merman tilted his head to the side and considered this for a moment, then slowly nodded in understanding. John didn't dare speak; he couldn't risk scaring him off again. Instead, he took in what he had not been able to see the previous nights. The merman's cheekbones were high and prominent, his lips full and angular like the rest of him. He lazily moved his arms across the top of the water, keeping his shoulders above the waves. John could see his arms were muscular but elegant. A shimmer caught in the moonlight and he realised there were small dorsal fins on either one of his forearms, the scales matching the ones on his tail.
'In the kitchen.' Came the immediate reply, to his relief. 'Stay there. Don't come out here yet.' John's voice had a hint of mischief that made Sherlock's heart flutter. Obediently he sat perched on the edge of the bed until John came in a few minutes later.
“Yeah, that's it. John.” John's heart pounded hard in his chest when the merman repeated it for a second time. He had heard his name in all manner of tones before, but never the way he heard it just now. The merman pointed to himself and then spoke again,
'Yes.'
“Partim, some,” John replied. “Not well perhaps, but some.” Sherlock smiled at John's attempt and drew him into another hug.
John put his journal down and raced to look over the side. He saw nothing, save for rippling waves that confirmed that *something* had made that sound. He mused over this for a moment. Whatever it was had sounded quite large but they were moving away from the deep sea and into shallower waters, their destination only a few days away. He supposed it could be a lone dolphin, separated from their pod. It didn’t really matter anyway, it was gone now. He was about to turn away and return to his journal when he saw it. A large shape emerged from the dark water and arched into the air. He knew instantly it was not a dolphin but was unsure as to what it actually was. A large tail crashed into the water, recreating the sound he had heard before. The creature repeated this two more times, each time moonlight reflected off of its silvery-blue scales. After the third breach, the sea returned to its calm solitude. After a few minutes, John raced back to his journal to sketch what he had seen.
Their relationship was also growing daily. Kissing, John discovered, was one of Sherlock's favourite ways to spend their time. It hadn't gone much further than that, touches here and there, and John wanted to let Sherlock set the pace, unsure at what experience, if any, he had had before.
“Land.”
'What?' he asked.
“Yeah, well, scales aren't really my favorite.” Sherlock shrugged at this and continued eating his fish as John set about scaling and de-boning his. Once his meal was boiling over the hearth, John decided it was time to ask Sherlock something he had been thinking about. “So, I was wondering, can we get up to the fort from here?” Sherlock considered this for a moment and then nodded yes. “Can you show me later? I'd like to see if I can get word to my ship before they leave port again, have them send my things here. It'd be nice to have more than one pair of trousers and one shirt.” He couldn't be certain how much Sherlock had understood but he didn't say no, so John figured he got the general meaning anyway.
“Alright, I can work with a little.” A silence settled over the pair as they stood on the beach, neither certain about what to do next. So they simply smiled at each other. John began rocking back and forth on his heels – his body was exhausted but he didn't want to take his eyes off of the beautiful man in front of him. After what seemed like an eternity the merman cleared his throat again and broke the spell. He pointed to the cottage on the beach and then to himself. “Yours?” John asked, glancing over his shoulder to get a better look. The merman nodded in affirmation and began to walk towards it. John began to follow but stopped short, realizing something. “Wait!” The merman turned around and gave John an inquisitive look. “I just realised, I've never told you my name. I'm John. John Watson.” The merman swallowed hard and paused, then repeated in his baritone whisper,
“John?”
'Oh Sherlock. You actually saved it. I had no idea what to get you.'
One night John awoke in the hours before dawn to find Sherlock sat in a chair by the window. His knees were pulled up to his chin, and John could hear faint sniffles when he breathed in. John quickly tossed the blanket off and crossed the room to where Sherlock sat. He placed a cautious hand on his back and rubbed it in small circles. When Sherlock didn't flinch away from his touch, he rested his chin on Sherlock's head and whispered soft assurances. They stayed this way until the sun began to come up over the horizon. Finally Sherlock turned to face John, his eyes red and cheeks tear stained.
“Ossis femoris!” John blinked in confusion, a slice of what he had determined to be papaya halfway to his lips.
'Fine.'
Most of the smoke had left via the window and Sherlock could now feel the chilled air coming in. That peculiar smell still lingered though, it might be awhile before that cleared out. He was about to offer a better explanation to John, but before he could John cleared his throat and announced 'I'm going out.' Without another word the sandy haired doctor grabbed his coat and headed out the door. 	Sherlock sighed as he heard the door shut. He had upset John. He knew it. And on their first real Christmas. He knew John wasn't overly fond of Sherlock's doing experiments in the flat, but he thought he had come to tolerate them. Maybe he had gone too far this time, although he would have assumed the severed fingers in the custard to be worse than a small microwave explosion. Was it because it was Christmas? Or had he just caused his patience to wear out? This Christmas was supposed to be perfect and now he had wrecked it. He ran his fingers through his curls and briefly considered grabbing a cigarette from his stash. No, he thought. It was bad enough that he still had the stash, taking one from it would most definitely ruin Christmas. So instead he rolled up his sleeves and set himself to the task of attempting to repair the microwave.
“I do love you. That is why I cannot do it. I cannot ask you to become someone else for my sake.” Tears spilled from John's eyes and Sherlock thumbed them away while still holding on to his chin.
“But you are unhappy.” Sherlock's Adam's apple bobbed in his throat as he reluctantly nodded. “Then that settles it, you are going back,” Sherlock began to protest but John interrupted, “and I want to go with you.”
When John met the merman's face again he was smiling at John, and motioned towards his legs, as if trying to elicit a response. As John followed the gesture with his eyes, a blush flooded his cheeks when he noticed the man's complete nakedness for the first time. “I-uh, yeah,” John brought his eyes back up to meet the other man's before they lingered too long. “That's...incredible...how?” The merman's face screwed up as if he were concentrating extremely hard on something. He cleared his throat, and in a deep, raspy whisper spoke a single word.
With a great deal of effort John was able to pull the rowboat far enough onto the beach to be out of danger of washing away, at least for now. He leaned forward and put his hands on his knees, breathing heavily from exertion and dehydration. He closed his eyes and tried to catch his breath when the sudden feeling of a hand on his shoulder caused him to shout and spin around to face the  would-be assailant. His balled up fist stopped short of its mark when he was suddenly staring into the ice blue eyes of his merman.
“You told me once that your people could perform spells and brew potions, yes?”
'Ready?'
John cautiously scooted over towards Sherlock. Sherlock reclined into the couch and extended his arms. John leaned his back against Sherlock's chest Sherlock wrapped his arms around John's waist. Relaxing even more as the weight and warmth of his boyfriend made him feel light and  giddy, almost like he was drunk. Maybe all was forgiven.
“Ossis femoris! Digitum! Cranium!” Sherlock jabbed his finger at John's handwriting.
“John.”
“Sweetheart, where were you?” Sherlock buried his head in John's chest, his body hitching when he breathed. John stroked his hair and let him calm, his heart clenching at the sight of Sherlock in such pain. When his breathing evened out John led him over to the bed and tucked him in. “Sleep, love. I'll take care of breakfast.” When he was confident that Sherlock was asleep, John left the cottage and walked the beach; he would gather some fruit from the jungle in a little while, but for now he had some thinking to do.
The next evening John returned to the deck as soon as the sun had set. He knew there wasn't much chance that he would see the creature again, but perhaps he would. Maybe this time he could catch a better look at it, maybe even identify it.  The moon was even brighter tonight, almost full, and there were no clouds in the sky. He didn't really even need his lantern to see his notes, but he brought it anyway. After a few hours of nothing, the creature once again breached the waves, arching high above them and re-entering with a graceful splash. In the brighter light John swore he had seen...but no, it couldn't be. He waited for the creature to breach again, barely breathing in anticipation. He frantically scanned the waves but saw nothing. A sound echoed from the water, causing John to jump. It had sounded like something had slapped the side of the ship. He stood on his toes and leant over the rail as far as he dared, searching for the source of the sound.
"Of course I am, or I would have left her with Lestrade." Sherlock said sharply.
In the Irene Adler episode, While in Buckingham Palace, Elisabeth has tea with 'Ms Elizabeth' (The Queen) and comes back into their room announces that Ms Elizabeth sends her regards and that her older sister (Violet from the first story) and her have resolved the problem and that the photographs would be arriving shortly and that she was no longer a problem. They had gotten her a new identity and kept the photos.
"Are you- you told him about me?" John asked Mike.
With the distraction in play I was able to take out the guards one by one by sneaking up on them, jumping on their back as I stabbed them through the side of the neck into their wind pipe cutting off their sound and then ripping the knife forward to cut their throats then moving the knife to the side of their necks to sever their spine and to finish removing their head from their bodies.
"Right." John looked around the area again thoughtfully, unsure what to do. "Right ... Yes." He turned to Donovan again. "Sorry, where am I?"
John watched her go for a moment, then turned and began to limp off down the road. After this John was kidnapped by Mycroft, read on to learn who he is. They talk, Mycroft deduces John, John gets angry at him and leaves refusing the money he was offered to spy on Sherlock, and he is texted by Sherlock demanding he come to the flat.
"Vamps. Whole nest of them. Need back up. You two up for it?" Elisabeth asked not looking up from cleaning the guns.
"Okay, bit of advice then: stay away from that guy."
Sherlock is kept in the back of the ambulance with a shock blanket where he starts to make a deduction about the killer before catching sight of John and taking back his words under the pretense of shock. John and Sherlock go off giggling at the crime scene before they are stopped by Mycroft who is introduced.
They grabbed their jackets and made sure Gwen was bundled into hers and made their way outside. At Mycroft's office it was a simple matter of signing a few paper and they were free to leave. Mycroft made the process as streamline as possible so as not have to deal with annoyed Sherlock. As they left John asked, "So where do you want to start shopping for our new flatmate?"
Comments and kudos are life, please comment on any inconsistencies and grammar problems, and please comment with anything you think could happen in the story.
After dispatching with all 8 guards I made it back to my family with only a little blood on my hands from cutting all those carotid arteries.
Elisabeth thought a moment then said, "Deal!"
"He’s gone." Donovan said.
Kudo's and comments appreciated! I know it is a shit summary of the rest of the pilot, but I will be adding more story soon! Also weird spacing since I did it in my phone. And so I can't link where I found the pilot dialogue.

Your limp’s really bad when you walk but you don’t ask for a chair when you stand, like you’ve forgotten about it, so it’s at least partly psychosomatic. That says the original circumstances of the injury were traumatic. Wounded in action, then. Wounded in action, suntan – Afghanistan or Iraq." Sherlock loudly clicked the ‘k’ sound at the end of the final word.
"Yes. Thank you Mrs. Hudson." Sherlock said, as a sleepy little girl walked out of the bedroom.
"You don't know? It's neither. The poison was in the water he served them to swallow the pill! He thought he was clever and talking them into it, but the whole time, they died from the poisoned water." Elizabeth said.
"Er ..." Donovan stepped over to the tape and lifted it for him. "... try the main road."
When they finally made it up the stairs with everything, John asked, "Where do you want to set up the crib?"
John looked at Mike for his reaction then back at Sherlock before asking, "I'm sorry, what?"
"Mmm, yes." John said.
Hearing Lestrade leave, Sherlock allowed himself a small smile, and as soon as Lestrade had left the front door Sherlock, leapt into the air and clenched his fists triumphantly before twirling around the room happily. "Brilliant! Yes! Ah, four serial suicides, and now a note! Oh, it’s Christmas!" He picked up his scarf and coat and he started to put them on while heading for the kitchen. "Mrs Hudson, I’ll be late. Might need some food."
Sherlock threw him a look. "When I met you for the first time yesterday, I said, 'Afghanistan or Iraq?' You looked surprised."
Before John can read on, Sherlock’s voice interrupted him and John looked up and saw him standing at the living room door. "You’re a doctor. In fact you’re an Army doctor."
As the days passed, the little girl started adjusting to living life normally. Though there were a few problems... She refused to sleep except when she was touch one of both of her new dads. She screamed and cried unless one of them was holding her and freaked out when she was left alone with other people, even family like Lestrade, Mrs. Hudson, and Molly.
Sherlock and I came into the the flat to see Rosie perfectly stitching up a girl's arms with tiny medical grade almost stitches despite her age and lack of official training. I also saw Elisabeth expertly and mechanically cleaning two guns.
---------------------------------- Le Time Skip - 7:00 a.m., 221 Baker Street the next day-------------------------------------
Sherlock, looking impressed with himself, said "Spot on, then. I didn't expect to be right about everything."
Please comment and kudo! They make my day.
"It wasn't working for me." Molly said, bashfully before smiling up at Sherlock, as John put his phone back in his pocket.
"I know you're upset but they're fine. It'll be better in the morning. Go ahead and check on them to ease your mind before bed." John motioned with his head as he set down his cup of tea and lightly tugged Sherlock's out of his hands as Sherlock stared at their bedroom door. Sherlock mumbled something and strode over to the door and peeked in to see them peacefully sleeping. John finished his cup of tea and kept Sherlock's cup warm in case he wanted it later. Sherlock shook himself out of the trance he had fallen into and softly closed the door. He walked back into the kitchen and leaned against the counter again. John handed him his warmed tea and leaned against the counter next to him. "You okay now?"
"Did you get the bad cabbie?" Elizabeth asked.
"Oh, don't worry. There's all sorts 'round here. Mrs. Turner next door's got married ones." The last two words Mrs. Hudson whispered.
"No, seriously, what am I doing here?" John asked.
"Of course, yes. Enough for a lifetime. Far too much." John said quietly with no annoyance at how close Sherlock stood as he looked up at him.
"And Harry's short for Harriet." John added.
Elizabeth and Rosie have to be shot with the sedative again to keep them quiet. Rosie is still in too much shock as well as having too much trust in her sister to be hysterical, but as Elizabeth feels the hours tick by, becomes hysterical in her worry over her sister being hurt and being unable to physically comfort and protect her.
Looking confused for a moment, John asked, "Sorry?"
"Harry and me don't get on, never have. Clara and Harry split up three months ago and they're getting a divorce; and Harry is a drinker." John replied.
John grunted as he fell into the other chair by the cold fireplace. "Sorry, girls?"

"But you’re not his friend."
(See the end of the chapter for
"You promised me a case!" Elisabeth said, standing up from her chair.
He thought for a moment, then pulled out his phone with no further complaining, "Mycroft; CCTV footage."
"Well, that's a change. If you are sure? She's a human; you can't just pay attention when you want to and ignore her when you're on a a case." Mycroft asked Sherlock.
"Someone had to take out the 8 guards watching the doors so you two could go in without trouble." I replied, cleaning my hands on the rag Rosie handed me. "Ready?"
"Anderson won’t work with me." Sherlock grimaced.
Rosie and I were now 7 1/2 and 9, respectively. We were just waiting around in the living room for something to happen. Then it did. A hunter came in cut up with her bag in need of help. I deduced that she was a hunter not only from the cut which she was handling as someone used to such injuries but also as someone used to watching their own backs with people who were nit as they seemed and had the classic signs of PTSD from being in the field for too long. Now you're asking, how did I know this was a hunter and not a soldier? Easy, a soldier sees children as mostly innocent though as possible bombs from their time in Afghanistan, but that part of them has mostly stopped. This means that if she was a soldier she would be looking at me like a parent does. This girl saw me as I am, a fellow hunter though younger. She knew that I knew why she was here and that I could be the one to help instead of my fathers, though John didn't quite know that we saw him that way as they were not together yet. The other piece of evidence that confirmed her as a hunter was that she was not looking for our father but for me. No one did but except for hunters.
"So this is all..." John started as Sherlock moved to start trying to tidy up.
"This one did. Will you come?" Lestrade asked.
"Shall we?" Sherlock asked. John agreed and they walked up the stairs with Mrs. Hudson following.
"Who, Sherlock Holmes?" John asked.
"Anything interesting?" Sherlock asked.
"I understand, dear; I’ve got a hip." Mrs, Hudson said, as she turned toward the door again.
Sherlock squinted his eyes at her then replied, "I shall take your case." He grabbed his Belstaff and swept out of the flat, following the little girl to the 4 bodies. She led him to an alleyway in an off the beaten path in a section of London few dared tread except the homeless and those looking for a fix. As such Sherlock knew this area well. Once there, Sherlock was able to ascertain minute differences in 2 of the bodies which told him they were not entirely human. As had Sherlock investigated the bodies, the little girl lugged out of hiding a duffle bag out of which she pulled salt, petrol, and matches.
Please comment and kudo, I need more human interaction!!!!
"Where did you go, young lady?" he asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"What do you think?"
"What the-" Lestrade started to say, before John interrupted his possible cursing with a glare. Lestrade shut up and just gazed at the two of them in amazement. Anderson wasn't there nor was Donovan or I'm sure we would have been subject to some more stupidity but thankfully we were spared that. She soon fell asleep laying on Sherlock's chest listening to his heartbeat, worn out from all the screaming and crying she had done earlier.
"Sorry, you stopped her husband being executed?"
John continued onward. "Look, what exactly am I supposed to be doing here?"
"Given that I know that bloody bastard I'm guessing you are the mysterious brother. I'm John," he said tilting his head in the direction of James who now was fully dressed again. The man accepted the extended hand.
"With what?" John asked sounding completely calm.
"Of course Q," Bond replied, put on his shirt and begun buttoning it up while sending an apologising look John's way. John own look promised that he wasn't done with him just yet but he turned to the younger man who stood next to Sherlock and Amalia.
"Her name is Amalia," Sherlock huffed as if Q wasn't already aware of the baby's name (
"Who does he think he is fooling," Q comment as he watched Sherlock reach the top of the stair, mumble something to the doctor and slowly leading him back in the direction of Sherlock's bedroom with a hand lightly placed in the small of Watson's back.
"Those should be done in ten minutes" he stated and sat down gesturing for Sherlock to do the same.
“‘Three Continent Watson’?” Q lifted an eyebrow.
"Brother-in-law?" 007 raised an eyebrow.
"So this is where you grew up?" 007 asked. The first words they had exchanged since they had met up in the garage in the afternoon and Q had held up his keys and said 'I'm driving' and 007 had nodded.
Q was not happy. He was sitting behind the wheel of his car that he normally would be delighted to drive speeding towards his family home. Because what was the meaning of having a gorgeous green car that he had tinker so much with that it hardly had any other brand then Q anymore if he didn’t break a few traffic laws with it? The source of his unhappiness was sitting in the passenger seat looking out of the window - no doubt memorising the way - and humming along with the radio. Still it could have been worse in the beginning Both 006 and 007 insisted on coming with him. Apparently doctor Watson's wife "Mary" (
"We, ah, work together," Q said.
"This brother of yours seems really special, I look forward to meeting him," John said still smiling but Sherlock could see that his eyelids were getting heavier. Amalia, who so far had been quietly taking in the new surroundings, seemed completely alert.
“We met during a mission in Kabul as I said. He helped me out a bit, he really is a crack shot - I would have him pinned for a sniper not a doctor. Then he preceded to stich me up while he told me exactly what a big idiot I was and asked me if I perhaps had a death wish?”
~ JW ~
"She seemed very fascinated by watching the landscape pass by outside the window," Sherlock added as they walked through the doors.
"Obvious the crime scene is not here. Come John let's go and check her flat." With those words he exited the cinema and hailed a cab. John passed on the last scones to Lestrade who just had entered the scene.
“I… eh,” he began trying to find a way out of this without hurting his father’s feelings.
“Just because I work with computers doesn’t it mean I can’t enjoy a good book. Besides the power went out a lot then I was young, one of the curses of living on the countryside,” Q replied absently as he checked 009 biodata (everything seemed in order slightly heightened pulse but that was normal for an agent on a mission and her tracker placed her exactly where she was supposed to be. Thankfully some agents still followed orders.)
"Oh yes she is. Is studying to become an actress. She is good if you ask me, got the female lead for their end of term project."
Being in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes was weird. It shouldn't really be a surprise but the sudden switch between detective and boyfriend kept John on his toes. One moment Sherlock was rattling of deductions and the next he was kissing John's hair sweetly. It was weird but John wouldn't have it any other way. This was his Sherlock, his partner. Right now they were in a cab hands linked together on their way to one of the fancier acting school in London (John wasn't sure if the name but it was Royal something). The cab was starting to slow down and John gazed over at the man next to him. Sherlock was as beautiful as usually half long curly hair surrounding his sharp face which now was showing signs of big concentration. Before he could stop himself he leaned over and placed a small kiss on Sherlock's lips. Said man seemed surprised at first but then smiled, put a hand on the back of John's neck and pulled him down for a proper kiss. All too soon a female voice broke throw the snogging.
"He patched me up once," was the only reply 007 gave and the phone chinned again with a new text.
"So did you find anything?" John wondered popping himself up on his elbows.
"No need to worry, run along and change now. I'm sure he is waiting for you" 'John waiting for him' and there was that warm feeling in his chest again. With a short nod he let go of Jolene's arm and walked in long strides towards his dressing room. He made a quick job of changing and didn't bother to remove his makeup. In less than 10 minutes he exited the backdoor and saw a short figure leaning against one of the ally's walls arms crossed over his chest. The warm feeling was back. John waited for him.
"Most likely the body was dressed up and moved into place after her death but I won't know for sure until I see the scene" Sherlock said. John accepted this with a nod as the cab pulled to a stop a block or so from Piccadilly Circus. The detective swept out as dramatically as usually and John paid the cabbie and followed him. He arrived just in time to hear Sergeant Donovan greeting Sherlock in her usually fashion.
"Not the crime scene. We are off to the victims flat" he summed up and slipped into the cab after his love.
"On the contrary, there are quite a lot of good complementary colours to purple. I'm sure Amalia and I can find you something while you take a shower," Sherlock said looking dead serious. John had long ago stopped asking questions concerning how Sherlock knew exactly what he needed and for the clothing, well it was Sherlock's family they were having dinner with. Better let a Holmes pick the outfit so he didn't break any clothing code.
"Sherlock, that is classified," he hissed glaring draggers at his brother.
"John, tell me everything the students said about Vanessa!"
"Any lead on the murderer?"
"Should we forget that that ever happened or shall we continue?"
"A second Facebook page, this guy is really nasty, and a possible workplace, but it doesn't open until 15.00 on Sunday's so we can relax a bit more."
"Just tea and toast for me John!" he called out. As said man left the room Sherlock laid there a couple of more minutes taking everything in before he sat up and stretched his body. His muscles hurt a bit but the pain was more a pleasant hum that told him they had been well used yesterday. Swinging his legs over the edge of the bed he padded over to the toilet snatching up another dressing gown on the way. When he had finished his business he headed to the kitchen to find that John already put food on the table. John really could cook but he seldom did it claiming that it was unhygienic to do so in a kitchen with Sherlock's experiments in it.
"We are going to the victim’s school" he decided after taking another quick look in the victim’s phone getting the address. He started to sweep out of the flat but suddenly the memory of this morning and last night with John swept through his head (without permission) and he turned back to grab his partners hand before going of more than less dragging the poor doctor along who had been caught by surprise. It felt nice having physical contact again - from now on he would do it more often. On the street it took longer than usually to hail a cab, some just drove past them - probably because they there holding hand, annoying, it wasn't like they did anything not fit for public. Then they finely got a cab he gave the cabbie (older lady, grey haired, single mother, all kid moved out, seen a lot in her days and didn't even blink at their linked hands) the address and then they drove of he placed a kiss on John's temple showing him that he hadn't deleted what had happened. A faint blush colour John's cheeks (it was really cute, saved and stored away) - he was caught by surprise but like it. Smiling the detective sat back and went through the case once again.
"Yes I would very much like to be in a romantic relationship with you and if I wasn't serious I wouldn't even be attracted to you in the first place."At his words John's face lit up with a big happy smile. He opened his mouth to say something and then
"Sorry if I pushed it too far" he said quietly
"You seems a bit misinformed, he is Q not M," 007 piped in (really couldn't that man learn when to keep his mouth shut, but then Q wouldn't have nearly as much work as he had).
"Ah that" John brought the hand that wasn't on Sherlock's hip up to rub his neck.
"So I'm not an experiment. Good. That's good. And the rest is Sherlock for?" Sherlock huffed a bit. Sometimes John could be so slow.
"Defiantly! He got the talent and can do amazing things with his voice. And when it comes to looks makeup can do amazing things." Kim's eyes sparkled as they talked about Rafael, ohho it was defiantly a crush there.
"Why and how?"
At once fact started to flow over him: John walked without any indication of a limp - he was happy and relaxed - John had taken his blue dressing grown, the colour matched his eyes. The angel of the sun rays told him that it was about 10 am - he had slept longer than usual, John was making breakfast - he should eat something.
"So how do you know this lunatic?" he said once again tilting his head towards James who stood a bit on the side trying to look innocent and failing spectacularly. Had he always been that easy to read or if he was picking up a thing or two from Sherlock?, John wondered.
"We share the bed because it benefits Amalia," Sherlock tried to explain but mummy didn't seem too impressed even if she did drop the subject.
"Excellent"
"You."
"Good afternoon John, you look terrible if I may say so," Mrs. Holmes said walking into the room. John let out a weak chuckle.
"All done?" he question. John nodded and straightened up. Sherlock walked over and offered John his hand, giving him a last chance to choose to back away. Not missing a beat John placed his hand in Sherlock and was rewarded with a squeeze as the resident detective started to lead the way to his bedroom. When they got there they climbed onto the bed and after some tries and rearranging they settled with Sherlock spooning John with the doctor's head resting firmly on his pillow covered arm. The other arm he put around John's waist and pulled him flushed against him. It felt so right finally having John in his arms. They fitted as two pieces of a puzzle knees bend and fitted together. After sharing one last sweet kiss they settled down.
(See the end of the chapter for
"No you don't" he hissed
"Mind telling me what was was about?"
John giggled all the way home. Because honestly, what could a man do? It had been exciting enough then he had walked with is arm linked with Sherlock, but then the detectives protectiveness then he got catcalled and the kiss. Sherlock "I'm married to my job" Holmes had kissed him. Something John hadn't even allowed himself to dream about. He had been a good kisser too, John really hope he would take him up on the offer to repeat it. It was also his flat mate’s reaction to the reviling of his sexual orientation; it was so typical for Sherlock. John was convinced that he was doing some large work in his mindpalace right now so he kept quiet all the way home. Well except for the giggles, he really couldn't help himself. He just enjoyed being close to Sherlock and if he pressed a little bit closer none of them remarked on it. As they approached the door of 221B Baker Street John started to get a bit unsure. Should he pull away? How should they act towards each other? The most reasonable conclusion he came to was to go to bed and discuss this, whatever it was, tomorrow morning. They climbed the 17 steps still tightly pressed together, not wanting to let the other go. John started to pull away when they had entered the living room prepared to say something like: 'I'm going to bed, good night and talk to you tomorrow'. But as soon as he moved Sherlock's grip got tighter and the detective spoke.
It took Sherlock exactly 3 seconds to notice that John had entered the room from his place on the stage. The amount of expressions that played over his doctor’s face was so fascinating. First the chin drop in surprise, the once over he gave Sherlock and then the oh so delicious flash of lust in his eyes before he tried to collect himself. 'Oh no we can't have that, can we?' Sherlock thought as he locked eyes with John and with a smirk playing on his lips kicked his leg high up in the air. Knowing exactly how this move showed off his body. The sight of John slumping down in a chair after his knees gave up made satisfaction pool in Sherlock’s stomach as he did a couple of struts forward before stepping apart and dipping down. Then he got up again his dear doctor seemed to have settled down and in his hand was a print of beer. 'He was staying' Sherlock deducted and a warm feeling spread in his chest. The warm increased as John capture his eyes and smiled at him. 'He likes it' his brain helpfully supplied. This was going to be a lovely night.
"What's the case this time?"
"Well, he won’t be your assistant." Lestrade stated.
Sherlock sped up the stairs and stopped in front of the door to 221B, turned around to watch John limp up the stairs behind him before opening the door into the flat. He walked in taking off his gloves before shoving them in his pockets as John followed him to walk into the sitting room of the flat.
Donovan turned and called to him, "Coming." She turned back toward John as she walked toward the house. "Stay away from Sherlock Holmes."
"In my room. Since she is my responsibility, it will work best if she's in my room, this way I will be able to keep an eye on her."
"Who else hunts in a crowd and is someone we trust despite their being a complete stranger?" She replied.
Lestrade called from the entrance to the house, "Donovan!"
"Ah, Molly! Coffee, thank you." Sherlock interrupted him to exclaim, hand John back his phone, and to take the coffee from Molly. "What happened to the lipstick?"
"How can you possibly know about the drinking?"
"Wha...?" I started to ask before Sherlock shut up me with his next words.
"Yes, how did you know who it was?" John asked.
They shook on it then Sherlock called, "Don’t wait up!" as he grabbed a small leather pouch from the kitchen table, opened the kitchen door and disappeared from view. Elisabeth sat back down in Sherlock's chair.
At the crime scene Sherlock flounced around investigating as John watched them. Sherlock stood up still looking at the crime scene before looking  something up on his phone. Gwendolyn started babbling out words about the crime scene while Sherlock listened. "We have to run, John." Sherlock announced before starting to pull Gwendolyn from her carrier, when she noticed she started to cry and make grabby hands towards Sherlock and John. "She'll stop when we're back." Sherlock announced as he handed her to Lestrade.
Elisabeth glared at him for a moment then bargained, "Case on my birthday, I get to start my business now, I won't go on this case, and you do that thing we talked about." Elisabeth said, referring to their last conversation about dating the flatmate.
Please! I need a beta! As you can tell, unbeta'd un-brit-picked, and not heavily edited. Comments and kudos make my day!! Transcript lines and occasional action descriptions from Ariane DeVere on LiveJournal.
Looking at Mike for his reaction, John looked down then sighed and looked back at Sherlock just as Molly walked in. "Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know..."
Lestrade held Gwendolyn as she freaked out being away from the consulting duo. They ran off after they bad guy that Sherlock had seen in the crowd. After stopping him and that he was dragged off to the jail by the constable, Sherlock and John came back to take Gwendolyn back who was now hiccuping from how badly she was screaming and crying. "Come here, bumblebee." Sherlock said as he took her back and started to pack her back into the baby carrier. As soon as Gwendolyn saw who was holding her, she shut up and let out a giggle.
"Thank you." Lestrade said, bowing out, with a nod to Mrs. Hudson and John.
"Not a word." Mike swore.
Lestrade just kept getting distracted by how different that was from what he was used in in regards to Sherlock's behavior with children.
"What do you think then, Dr. Watson? There's another bedroom upstairs if you'l be needing two bedrooms." Mrs. Hudson asked from in front of the couch, having just come up the stairs.
(See the end of the chapter for
"‘Piss off’!" Sherlock said, smiling briefly at John, who grinned and turned away to look out of the window as the journey continued.
----------------------Le time flashback and P.O.V. skip to John----------------------------
Odd, Sherlock had never felt the need to fill the silence before, must be the influence of the new silent little girl. As they sat there, her breathing deepened into sleep. Sherlock attempted to again lay her down on the couch to sleep. Yet even in sleep, she continues to tenaciously cling to him. Giving it up as a lost cause yet unwilling to go to sleep, Sherlock lay down on the couch in his usual mind palace pose, as John called it, except he held her on his chest with both of his hands.
"Yes. Yes, I think so. My thoughts precisely." Sherlock agreed as they moved to stand next to each other backs to the kitchen to look over all of the sitting room.
So now Sherlock has the little girl at home, now what? And what will happen when John learns what Sherlock has been up to when he was gone? Warning: OOC Sherlock.
It's been 24 hours and Sherlock knew that Sebastian Moran, Moriarty's right hand man was still on the loose and had been the one to kidnap the girls. The girls most likely were fine, since it seemed that they had been taken to hurt Sherlock and were being held by henchmen and not Moran himself. He had managed to narrow it down where they were being held to one location. Mycroft had the Yard back up them up.
"Why?"
"Already working on it, brother. We will find them." Mycroft replied.
"We don't know a thing about each other. I don't know where we're meeting, I don't even know your name." John said.
The girls with their stuff are safely hidden in Mrs. Hudson’s flat to keep their existence secret so they stay safe for now. During the raid, Sherlock has an epiphany and follows the bad cabbie out of the flat, into his cab, and to the building where the famous three way standoff takes place. John wins when he shoots the bad cabbie in the shoulder, killing him within minutes.
Mrs Hudson turned back to John. "Look at him, dashing about! My husband was just the same." John grimaced. "But you’re more the sitting-down type, I can tell."John looked uncomfortable. "I’ll make you that cuppa. You rest your leg." Mrs. Hudson said, turning toward the door.
"Hello. I'm Dr. John Watson." He said, shaking her hand.
Sherlock smiled. "Shot in the dark. Good one, though. Power connection: tiny little scuff marks around the edge of it. Every night he goes to plug it in to charge but his hands are shaking. You never see those marks on a sober man’s phone; never see a drunk’s without them." He handed the phone back. "There you go, you see – you were right."
"She's a witness. Last night her parents were killed in a mugging gone wrong where everyone died but her. I found her and brought her here since she was scared. I just... I wanted to protect her. I want to adopt her." Sherlock's last sentence came out all in a rush.
"Make sure they are safe and keep an ear out for any nightmares." Sherlock said, quietly.
"I’m a consulting detective. Only one in the world. I invented the job."
"Brixton." Donovan replied.
"Harry Watson: clearly a family member who’s given you his old phone. Not your father, this is a young man’s gadget. Could be a cousin, but you’re a war hero who can’t find a place to live. Unlikely you’ve got an extended family, certainly not one you’re close to, so brother it is. Now, Clara. Who’s Clara? Three kisses says it’s a romantic attachment. The expense of the phone says wife, not girlfriend. She must have given it to him recently – this model’s only six months old. Marriage in trouble then – six months on he’s just given it away. If she’d left him, he would have kept it. People do – sentiment. But no, he wanted rid of it. He left her. He gave the phone to you: that says he wants you to stay in touch. You’re looking for cheap accommodation, but you’re not going to your brother for help: that says you’ve got problems with him. Maybe you liked his wife; maybe you don’t like his drinking."
"Of course it was. It was extraordinary; it was quite extraordinary."
"You said around my birthday. It's coming up!" Elisabeth exclaimed.
Sherlock cut him off as he walked by, and said, "I'll tell you in the morning. They need sleep and me and I'm not leaving them now."
"Yes! And I can track her development! This will be the best ongoing experiment ever!" Sherlock exclaimed, keeping his voice low so as not to wake her.

John nodded, grinning, and clambered on to Sherlock’s back, throwing first his right leg around Sherlock’s right shoulder, then doing the same with his left, seating his rear upon the other man’s neck and shifting his weight to balance himself. “Alright, Sherlock?”
"And what's wrong with the landline?" Mike asked.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs Hudson, is on!" Sherlock said, as he walked out onto the street and hailed an approaching black cab. "Taxi!"
"Damn my leg!" John exclaimed. Mrs. Hudson turned back in shock "Sorry, I’m so sorry. I shouldn't have... It’s just sometimes this bloody thing ..." He bashed his leg with his cane.
"Will you come?" Lestrade asked.
"Hmm, okay." Seeing Sherlock open his laptop that's on the desk, John remarked, "I looked you up on the Internet last night."
"Oi! Not so little I'm almost 8!" She exclaimed as she rubbed her eyes. "Hello. My name's Elisabeth. Rosie's still asleep in the bedroom." She said, holding her hand out to shake while pointing back toward beyond the kitchen with her other.
John calmly drank his tea that he had made while she slept, and thought through Sherlock's answer. As unusual as Sherlock's actions were, John understood where he was coming from. As she continued to sleep, she clung to Sherlock as if afraid he would disappear. "I must be going mad, I'm actually considering letting you." John said, pinching his nose. Looking up at Sherlock, John added, "You do realise what a big endeavour this is, right? She's a living human being, she can get hurt. You'll have to baby-proof the flat, and get so much stuff..." John trailed off, thinking through all that was needed.
"I prefer to text." Sherlock replied.
"Sherlock!" Mrs. Hudson said in greeting as she hugged him.
Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade ran up the stairs, when he got to the doorway, Sherlock asked him, "Where?"
"Alright, if you think she won't object." John asked.
"She hasn't spoken. But I think she would be willing to let us change it since it might have too many connotations to last night and her parents' deaths. I think we should name her Gwendolyn." Sherlock said.
"Yeah." Sherlock said.
"Really? I thought it was a big improvement. Your mouth's too small now." Sherlock said taking a sip of coffee, as the smile fell off Molly's face.
"Sounds good." Sherlock mumbled, still looking down.
The taxi pulled up alongside and he and John get in, then the car drove off again and headed for Brixton. The boys sat in silence for a long time while Sherlock sat with his eyes fixed on his smartphone and John kept stealing nervous glances at him. Finally Sherlock lowered his phone. "Okay, you’ve got questions."
"Yes." John said, getting to his feet and turning toward Sherlock as he came back into the room again.
"Yes; and I can read your military career in your face and your leg, and your brother’s drinking habits in your mobile phone." Sherlock replied.
"Well, this is a prime spot. Must be expensive." John remarked, looking around.
As Sherlock stood up, Mike said, "This is an old friend of mine, John Watson."
"Something cold will do. John, have a cup of tea, make yourself at home. Elisabeth..." Sherlock started before he was interrupted.
"She won't." Sherlock replied.
"Case on your birthday, you get to start your business now, you won't go on this case, I talk about doing that thing we talked about. Plus, no consultations without me, leave all the legwork to the clients, and you get one case a birthday." Sherlock bargained.
"Yeah." Sherlock replied.
Sherlock had almost reached the front door but now turned and walked back toward her. "Impossible suicides? Four of them? There’s no point sitting at home when there’s finally something fun going on!" He took her by the shoulders and kissed her noisily on the cheek.
----BRIXTON. The cab has arrived at Lauriston Gardens and Sherlock and John get out and walk towards the police tape strung across the road.----
"What about her? She obviously is terrified and has deemed me the only safe haven thus I shall keep her and John will look over her to make sure she is healthy and she will stay with us until suitable arrangements can be made. Obvious." Sherlock said turning around to continue walking away.
"Because he’s a psychopath. And psychopaths get bored."
"Mike, can I borrow your phone? There's no signal on mine." Sherlock asked, glancing up at his visitors.
Sherlock finds and brings home a 2 year old girl, while John is off at a Medical Conference.
"Fine." Elizabeth grumbled, picking up Rosie and carrying her to the bedroom. "That's all the help I get..."
"Yes, as soon as I catch John up." Sherlock said as he dragged me to his bedroom.
Sherlock looked round, apparently so surprised that he couldn’t even reply for the next four seconds. "Do you think so?"
---------------------------Le time skip-------------------------------
"Rosie, remember you hide in that foliage over there. We'll call if we need immediate medical need or come to you. Until you see us do. not. come. out. of. hiding. Got it?" Elisabeth reviewed the plans with us.
Sherlock nodded, still looking down at his cup of tea.
"Why would he do that?"
Comments and kudos are life! Also if you have any ideas about what could happen in the following chapters please comment them and I will do my best to incorporate them into the story. Yes, the adoption is fast but Mycroft!
The next morning, John came home early to see his best friend and flat mate laying on the couch with a 2 year old girl on his chest, both sound asleep at 9 o'clock in the morning.
"Be quiet! She just fell asleep again."
"I’d say private detective ..." John asked hesitantly.
"Her, and yes I can." Sherlock said over his shoulder as he arrived at the kerb and flagged down a cab. He got in with her and left for Baker Street.
"Gwen's asleep. Hurry up."
"Oh. Now off to bed. You two were supposed to be asleep by now!" Sherlock exclaimed.
"This is not even a 5, Lestrad-!" Sherlock abruptly stopped speaking, hearing a small human whimper come from behind the bins in the alleyway where he was kneeling by four dead bodies. He stood up and strode to the bins before stopping in front of them and crouching down to look behind them. "Are you hurt?" Sherlock asked in a soft voice. Silence. An eye gleamed as the child leaned closer to the light to see Sherlock better and made a soft sound as if unsure. Silence again. Then a small hand reached out. Sherlock gently took it and helped the child out from behind the bins and into the light. Sherlock could see that she was a girl about 2 years old, usually well taken care of but currently dirty and scared, and obviously the child of the murdered couple from the mugging gone wrong that Lestrade had called him in for. She held tight to him as he stood up, hiding her face in his chest while he held her tight.
