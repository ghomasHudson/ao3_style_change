John looks at Sherlock.  Agitated, he’d wiggled around until his leg was bent up on the seat and his gossamer shirt was worked up, exposing the abs that are heaving with his quick, panting breaths.  John places a calming hand on his stomach, another on his chest, over his heart.  “Look at me, Sherlock.”
He reaches up to stroke Sherlock’s nipple, licking his other palm and wrapping it around Sherlock’s beautiful cock.  He’s never thought of a cock as beautiful before.  It’s not a thing he’s even associated with the phrases
Before long, kisses turned to hard-core snogging, gentle touches became passionate stroking, clothing became history, and orgasms burst forth all over John’s chest and stomach.
“Don’t be boring, John.  It shows-off the musculature of your chest.  If you’ve got it, flaunt it.  Now…” he claps his hands together and holds the fingertips under his chin, gazing speculatively at John’s hair.
John hurrumphed and settled in for some two-fingered blogging.  There was a nice little case he wanted to post about an unfaithful husband, his gay lover and their unfortunately fatal sexual shenanigans in a yew tree.  He was thinking of calling it “BLATANT INN-YEW-END-O”  Sherlock had cleared the wife and solved the case in thirty minutes flat but it didn’t make it any less interesting, not to mention titillating.
So after rallying the troops, John resettled his stance, allowed Sherlock a few quick breaths before slipping his hand back over his mouth and FUCKED. HARD. And as our John is a man of his word he did exactly what he said, fucking and slamming and grinding and sucking Sherlock dry. And as Sherlock stood in that cubicle looking bewildered and well-fucked, John lovingly pressed his lips to dazed ones, gently bent down and threaded Sherlock’s feet into those tiny black shorts. He stood there as docile as a lamb as John pulled them up his thighs, eased his arms into his Belstaff, threaded his fingers through his and then followed John out of the centre and across town without a single murmur.
Long, supple fingers inch around from behind his body toward John’s straining buttons.  John stares, unmoving, like a stunned mullet, hypnotised by the encroaching Fingers-Of-His-Fantasies.  Those looong, slender digits have been featuring in John’s rather heated nocturnal musings for some time now.  Upstairs, in his private moments – the very few Sherlock
Lestrade.  And he told you the coppers can’t do anything about it because the bastard doesn’t play after ten at night and eleven on weekends.  And he also pointed out that you play your violin all through the night sometimes and no one has ever complained about you.  He probably has a valid point”
Just as John was about to reach out to grab a handful of lusty arse Sherlock straightened up and casually wobbled his way toward the bedroom, throwing an audacious wink over his shoulder before rounding the doorway.
“Pull your cock and balls out over the waistband, love.  Lean forward and hold the headboard.  I want to… ungh yeth”.  Unexpectedly John was the one to lisp as he got a face full of Sherlock.
John watches as Sherlock smirks and rolls onto his back.  Pink fills his cheeks as he sees the perfect ring of lipstick around the base of Sherlock’s cock.  Sherlock notices and chuckles deep in his chest.  “I’ve never come so hard, John.  You were perfect”.  He busses John’s nose with a kiss.
So it was not too surprising that Sherlock’s plan to avoid Tuesday’s swimming lesson, which he had promised to attend without whining and in an appropriately attired manner, involved extraction from said lesson via other…
John reaches out and gently runs a hand down Sherlock’s arm, grasping his hand and pulling it in, centring it on his chest.  “I know you’ve orchestrated everything that’s happened so far tonight,” he soothes, “but from here on in, we’re going to work as a team, OK?”  He watches Sherlock, contemplating his reaction.  If he doesn’t start-off on the right foot, Sherlock will walk all over him ‘til the end of time.
“Calm down, John” Sherlock said cluelessly.  “Despite Juan obviously being extremely interested in my physical charms I’m not interested in him, if that’s what’s irking you.  I’m not into smooth.  Smooth is boring.  I like tetchy and bossy” he teased as they stripped down and changed.  Apparently this was not the time for teasing, or pointing out the obvious .  John’s simmer notched up to a rolling boil.
Sherlock hesitated.  He wanted to be able to last inside John and at this rate he’d blow before he got half way in.  John made a little whimper again and that was it.  Sherlock slowly worked out the toy and tenderly worked in the new, bigger one.  John squirmed and opened for him.  The toy popped in and he started it humming on a low speed.
.  He raised his hands nervously.  John grabbed them and using one hand, pinned them up against the wall as he grunted and hip-shoved Sherlock’s back to the tiles.  The other hand fell to the top of Sherlock’s head and slid lazily down over his ear and neck, shoving around to grasp his nape.  John’s face moved in close until their lips touched and whispered menacingly, “I can be smooth, Sherlock”.  Sherlock shivered.
John takes a few moments to squeeze his eyes shut and breathe deeply, summoning tranquillity.  He forces his eyes open just in time to see Sherlock emerge from the bathroom.  As clenched shut as they had been before, they now stretch so wide his eyeballs are in danger of bugging out of their sockets.
his man.  Does Sherlock realise this?  His fingers tighten around plush arse cheeks as he frets over this newest concern.  He hears a very put-upon sign.
The lanky, sinuous gazelle simpers at John over his shoulder.  He starts singing the chorus softly, running his hands down his sides, over the torn shirt back, stopping at his undulating arse cheeks,
“Huhngh!”  Hands clamp onto John’s head, clenching at his hair.  He pulls back to run his tongue over the roof of his mouth, savouring the elemental tang of Sherlock.  Before he can lean back in his head is dragged back to the job.
Over the next hour John got Sherlock to let his head tilt back until his chin was up and his ears were under the water.  His hands being busy under his beautiful boyfriend’s body, John gentled him verbally, urging him to listen to the music, deliberately calling the piece by the wrong name so that Sherlock would correct him.  Eventually he relaxed enough for John to encourage him to let his legs bend at the knees and sink slightly so that John could remove his hand that was under Sherlock’s hip.  They celebrated that milestone with a five minute sub-aquatic feel-up, just gentle fingers drifting over pearly skin at leisure.  After another twenty minutes and lots of petting and reassuring, Sherlock agreed that John could remove the hand under the base of his neck.
Sherlock was still running when he decided he’d need lots of hot water, bi-carbonate of soda, a rasp and a nail file to avoid the next lesson.
while he had physical access to John’s sugar crumpet.  There was no WAY Don would be allowed to grope his sweetie’s bounteous gifts!
“Relax, John.  I read this was the best waterproof lubricant, and I’ve tested it and it’s quite true.”  Sherlock scooped up a generous portion of shortening in two fingers.  John felt like a goose.  Like a big trussed-up Christmas goose that was about to be stuffed.
.  Obvious.  A drummer would never face his kit to the wall, even to avoid sunlight.  The reverb from the wall would not only distort sound but leave the cymbals ringing longer than desired.  The rear of the room, if you think of the positioning of these rooms, which are identical, contain the power outlets so is always where occupants set-up their bed and side table for a lamp also avoiding any cold breeze that might get in through old, poorly sealed windows at the front.  The room could have been modified, of course, but as you know Mr Raffles owns that building and he’s miserly and wouldn’t have sunk one more pound into that place than he had to, especially not for renters.”
While John mused, Sherlock twisted around completely, ditched his towel and straddled John’s hips.  He leant forward and placed a gentle kiss on the good doctor’s lips.  He looked earnestly at John.
Sherlock gazed at him levelly.  “I love you, John.”  John smiled.  Sherlock smiled.  “Now, let’s go throw some rocks at his window so I can show you how right I am”
.”  He bent close to Sherlock’s rear.  “Were I to blog this crime against my sanity I’d name it, ‘A Vision in Red’, my love” and pressed his rouged lips firmly to one cheek of that comely rear leaving perfect glossy lip prints.
Sherlock, starting to panic that he hadn’t done enough to seduce the pants off John, renews his efforts at seduction.  Releasing John’s arse, he slides his hands to his hips and spins him around.  John flails his arms out for balance and Sherlock takes the opportunity to crowd him from behind, snaking his arms under John’s, thrusting his knee between John’s thighs, rolling his hips to the beat until his entire thigh insinuates itself up against John’s balls.
Gasping, John reached into the Belstaff and drew out the ripped, red speedos.  “I think it’s rather fitting that we clean up with this rag you created, don’t you, Sherlock?”
"Well I don’t know about Wickham, but I'm certainly feeling wicked, if that's close enough?" he growled against Sherlock's cheek, and gave a tiny nip to the skin of his jaw.  He could feel Sherlock's chest rising and falling rapidly, his hips shifting restlessly.  His beautiful little baggage liked being told what to do every now and then.  "Now, speaking of close enough, distract yourself by telling me what you know about this painting, Darcy."
“Don’t worry.  I’m sure it will all become abundantly clear to me soon.  I just want to ask you – beg of you, really – please, whatever inane contraptions you’ve bought or invented or blow-torched, if it’s potentially harmful to my being could we perhaps leave it at home?  Do you think you could manage to just make this a normal day?  A regular day like normal people have where two people go out and one teaches the other something, without Holmesian mishaps like amphibians, or faulty stitching, or mis-tucked appendages.  Do you think we can manage that?”
with the tight clothing and music and everything, but it was all in aid of a desperate, final attempt at cracking your resolve.  To attract you to me.  To see if you might…want me enough to…to go for it.  Uggggghhhh!”  Sherlock tugs at his own hair in frustration.  “John, you’re making me crazy and there’s only so much a man can take!  Of course I want a relationship!  I just don’t want to push for more than you want to give and I’m frightened I’ve misjudged and I’ll scare you off completely!”
“Yes! Oh god, yes, John. That’s sooo good. “ The fingers slowly retreated. “WAIT! Yes, I promise to come next week. All that. Everything you said. And goggles or… flippers. Snorkels??” Sherlock twisted to look angelically over his shoulder at John.
“I’ve observed all of your reactions to stimulus over a very long time, John.  I applied to myself, the top ten things that received the highest recurring reactions in order to maximise my chance of success.”
“Yes, John,” he says meekly, pulling them out of his pocket and dangling the evidence from one long finger.
Sherlock wiggled again for good measure and tilted forward to place his lips ever so gently against John’s.  A mere whisper of sticky, sexy touch.  Gloss met gloss and both boys groaned.  Hypnotised, John barely had time to form a pucker before Sherlock was standing and backing off.  As he watched silently, his naughty strawberry tart pretended to drop the lip gloss, made an ‘o’ of surprise with his sinful mouth, turned his back to John and bent from the hips stiff-legged to pick it up, giving John an eyeful of the best-filled Speedos on the face of the planet.  And beyond.  Far, far beyond.
John was mesmerised by Sherlock's wantonness.  He marveled at how openly Sherlock displayed his desire so unashamedly to John, obeying his commands, trusting him unreservedly, throwing himself into the scene wholeheartedly.  It threw John into a tailspin, his breath catching, his emotions welling...  John suddenly couldn't think straight, his arms full of twisting, heaving perfection.  He babbled.
John clutched at Sherlock’s arse and could feel his own dampness through the fabric of the Speedos.  Suddenly he
Sherlock, not used to quite this level of bossiness from his little despot, felt rather overcome.  He happily did as he was told and was rewarded with two fingers slipping right up deep where he needed them.
“Down here!”  Sherlock yelled up at the window.  An outline of a figure could be seen behind the net curtain.  “We wanted to speak with you about your drumming”
Sherlock nodded against John's lips.  He obediently placed his palms on his own thighs, running them slowly down and up again, then dragged them around over his side seams, over John's, and back to curl his fingertips around the backs of John's inner thighs.  It was John's turn to shiver.  He reached up and removed the riding crop from Sherlock's teeth.
John had been gifted with Regency regimentals - how fitting - that made him feel quite the thing.  A gorgeous uniform coat with buttoned back lapels, snowy white waistcoat, starched frilled shirt and regimental sword hanging from a shoulder belt, made him stand taller and straighter than he'd stood in a long while. The heeled boots and white leather gloves completed the outfit that must have set Sherlock back quite a penny.  He held Sherlock's brown leather riding crop, the loop of thonging around his wrist.  There had been a small argument over the crop - Sherlock insisting it wasn't a part of an officer's uniform, John firmly stating he wanted to be in the cavalry and besides, carrying the crop made him think of how he wanted to swat Sherlock's generous offerings every time he got a peek at them as Sherlock's frock coat swished, splitting the tails just enough to whet John's appetite.
The stricken man raises his eyes to John’s.  “I’m not easily scared-off, Sherlock, just in case you hadn’t noticed.”  He sighs.  “Did you really set up that song in the club?”
John smiled and let his eyelids drift shut again, dredging up vivid vermilion images from last night.  Itch soothed, the hand slid down, down over his chest, coming to rub lightly back and forth across his belly.  Mmmm it was all coming back to him.  He could still smell the visceral fuck-scent they’d produced, as if the heat was still vital between them now.  John nuzzled his face into the pillow… Ooops!  Scent in the air, no.  Scent on the pillow – yes, very much so.  The good doctor raised his head and drew out from under his cheek a pair of very, very
“It’s no good, John.  You know I can’t concentrate on my rhythm when there’s an alternate one – and syncopated at that – going on two doors down.”
John paused.  Sherlock wasn’t even remotely interested in pleasing him over the last three Tuesdays.  Why now?  He decided to say nothing for now but to stay on guard.  “Okay.  The most important thing, as you said, is for you to be relaxed.  I’m going to get you to lie on your back with my hands and the swing strap under your back, hips and base of your neck.  I won’t take my hands away without us both agreeing it’s OK, alright?”
“Sherlock, my graceful little swan, why are there strings of silicon caulking all over the kitchen?  Are you going to re-seal the tiles?”
“But Sherlock,” John rasped desperately, “the bastard plays so often, if we don’t manage to learn to ignore it we’ll never have sex again!”
“I know, but perhaps I should have specified that the alternative to jumping wasn’t pushing the nearest copper in to retrieve it for you.  Anderson’s still got Thames water dribbling out his ears and I’m the one getting the gruesome pictorial evidence in complaint.”  They crossed with the lights and continued on their way.
“You’re in luck, Sherlock, ‘cause I’m going to bloody give it to you.”  John watched Sherlock writhe as he stripped off his clothing.  He licked his hand and palmed his heft as he reached forward with his other hand and delicately twisted free the plug.  Sherlock’s hole glistened with plenty of lube.  John touched a finger to the plug-stretched skin and swirled the tip around the inside passage.  His own red lip prints nudged back toward him seeking
eyes.  Silvery-green eyes rimmed with smudged kohl glint at him, peering down a nose decorated with a ring in the left nostril.  Seeing John’s expression, an eyebrow punctured with a spiked flex rises knowingly, as a mouth smirks up at one side: a mouth whose bottom lip is penetrated by a ring, a captive ball nestled lovingly against the plump lower edge.  Purple chalk slashed through his artfully messy locks, giving him a thoroughly debauched bedhead.  All in all, Sherlock is hottestfuckingsexJohncouldeverimagine-on-legs.
“I’d like us to try something different.”  A beat.  “I want you to let me come to you.  I want to know how you feel when you make yourself a part of me, and I want you to know how it feels when I lay myself open to you becoming a part of me.  Do you think… could we… perhaps-“
John was stunned.  Sherlock was in a playful mood and had cracked another joke.  Never one to knock back a bit of nasty, his fingers whipped ‘round to deal with dressing gown sashes and was just reaching for the olive oil when-
He’s everything everywhere and it’s the combination of him and this glorious man beneath him who’s made him that way.
“A-about two hours after I observed your reaction to the one d-decorating that exotic dancer in the smuggling case last month.  John please…”
Sherlock smirked.  John laughed.  “Come here you big idiot.  Help me fix this,” he indicated his crotch.
“Ah well, that’s the beauty of a lock, stock and barrel arrangement, Sherlock," he grins gently as he strokes.  "It means you can experiment to your heart’s content, love.  Or at least until you run out of stimulus.”
Sherlock blinks a few times before peaceably rolling and settling, turning his face to the side.  John straddles Sherlock’s thighs and smooths his hands over the acres of perfect skin before him, before letting his lips meander a lazy path from neck to buttock.  He mentally maps the occasional freckle, marking the little beauty spots with a lick and a kiss, each too important to gloss over.
) reticent man’s candour.  A dizzying flush rises up over him at the trust once again displayed.  He falls upon Sherlock, stripping the shirt away completely and running his palms over the smooth expanse of skin.
A whimper escapes John’s throat.  Sherlock isn’t wrong about his top ten.  His confident attitude is indeed, making John crazy for him.  He wonders how far he’ll take it.  Knowing Sherlock, way past decency and beyond.  The thought inspires a smile.
Caveman instincts clubbing their beat into his head, John puffed up to his full five foot seven, fists clenching and unclenching he jerked his head at Sherlock’s Speedos.
Sherlock was still glued to the laptop.  “Well if you’re going to keep ignoring me all day I’m going out.”  John patted his pockets.  “Where’s my wallet?”
“No, Sherlock.  No one’s going to take over.  I mean, if, in time, that’s something we want to try…” John can feel his face heat, “then I’m not against that, but for now, we’re going to be in this together.  No one leads, no one follows, just two people who love each other being together, OK?  Besides, I have a feeling you’ll be quite a bit more…” he gestures between them, “advanced than I in these matters, having only heterosexual practical experience to this point.”
Sherlock’s expression perked-up.  “Yes John.  I won’t have to learn the whole time we’re there, will I?  Can we have leisure time too?”
”Come in, come in.  John, Sherlock, this is Juan.  Juan takes the private adult lessons.  I’ll let him chat with you about your expectations”.  The manager wandered off, blissfully unaware of the screaming silence she left behind.
“No no no it’s not like that.  We’re not here to complain” Sherlock waved his arms about frustratedly.
see-through they can get, John?  You can tell me how many dicks I’m holding up… “  Sherlock continued to babble, seriously worrying the weakened seams had overplayed his hand.
John made a sound deep in his throat.  He hunkered down and licked around where his finger disappeared into Sherlock.
Arms wrapped tightly, they move sinuously, together alone, rocking faster and faster, breath gusting, spiralling higher, shallow and deep until they clasp tighter than ever and...    just....    fucking...
If John knew one thing about his little dumpling it was that if cases were slow and Sherlock wasn’t complaining it was because he had another focus, and John was fairly certain now that the great detective’s mind was focused on Tuesday.   John didn’t know what insane ideas Sherlock was cooking up, but things had gone far enough.  He wanted Sherlock to take that lesson and he wanted his boyfriend back.  It was time to get everything out in the open.  And if he didn’t like what he learnt when he opened that Pandora’s box?  He could always seal it all back together again with Sherlock’s silicon caulk.  He took a seat on the coffee table.
John chuffed to himself as Sherlock giddily jumped up and ran to his bedroom for a specimen jar.  Was there anything he wouldn’t do for this man?  It appeared not.  He looked up as his gorgeous, pink-cheeked lover returned, jar in hand, about to scrape jizz from his chest, and decided he wouldn’t want his life any other way.
John emerged from the cabana to face a maniacally grinning Sherlock with his chest all puffed out.  He was in his silvery-grey Speedos, standing proudly next to what John was pretty sure was a sex swing – on steroids.  John felt frustration brewing in his gut, as if the yeast in the beer he’d been drinking was reacting, frothing and bubbling in there.  Sherlock couldn’t possibly be doing this a fourth time, could he?!
From that moment on Sherlock’s attitude to the crashing and banging performed an about-face.  It was as if he’d taken the kid under his metaphorical wing, and waited eagerly for practice to begin to see what had transpired each day.
This elicited a disdainful verbal response.  "Back on, John?!  But they’re ruined.  Why would you want me to put them back on?"
“He hasn’t played a jazz standard in over two days.  He’s had an argument with his father and is sulking.”
Sherlock finally released John's thighs and reached up to place his hands over John's.  "John, I..."  He swallowed.
He looked over at Sherlock, who was pulling a familiar item out of the bag.  “Sherlock… why is the Trex here?  You’re
The fly decided the cavern of John’s mouth looked good enough for a summer holiday and tried to touch down on John’s bottom lip. “Spth! Ugh. Bloody hell, Sherlock. What in god’s name do you think you’re playing at?!”
“OK John” Sherlock said despondently.  He worried his bottom lip with his teeth as he obediently entered the store.  John placed a hand in the small of Sherlock’s back and led him past the racks of bathers and straight to the change rooms.
“Yes, John.  I consider myself ‘claimed’.  I am yours, lock, stock and barrel.  It’s only fair I inform you that you also, are similarly ‘claimed’.  By me.  To have and to hold, to scrutinise and inspect, to experiment on in the absence of a more stimulating subject…”
Sherlock wiggled his bounteous arse.  “Ooooh I like what I’m feeling, John”.  He winked cheekily and leaning back slightly, staying linked with John’s gaze Sherlock ran one varnished hand down his chest, over his stomach and down into his Speedos.  John’s eyes were drawn like a magnet.  Sherlock milked the moment, swishing fingers around tantalisingly slowly before pulling out and twisting his hand to reveal one stick of rouge lip gloss.  John’s eyeballs were glued to the stick.  As the lid came off with a little
John grunted.  As they walked the detective trawled his mind palace for a solution but, having never been in this predicament before, came up empty.
"But John, I've never...  that was... "  Sherlock growled frustratedly.  He was so shit at feelings.  His John was so good at them, and he was so pathetically hopeless at them.
John smiled to himself, and dropped his head to hide it.  As he tried to control his breathing he caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of his eye.  He cranked his head to the right almost imperceptibly and nearly lost his shit.  His eyes almost bugged out of his head before quickly looking up at Sherlock's face to search for a reaction, but the man was stalwartly staring at the Lawrence.  John let his eyes drop back to the slack hanging placket of Sherlock's breeches, the lax opening allowing a delicious visual of tantalising Sherlockian Sidecock.
“From the first day I was able to deduce that this was a left-handed teenaged boy with glasses.  Several factors led to this decision, the primary two being room selection and drum kit positioning.  The buildings on this street all follow an identical internal pattern.  The drumming is emanating from the front bedroom of the flat, which is inferior in size and privacy to the rear bedroom, which would, of course, be inhabited by the parents of the household, therefore the drummer is not of parental age.  Add to that the fact that the hours the drumming is heard are more in line with school hours and not work hours and you have confirmation,”  Sherlock paused to drag in another deep breath and resumed in the same speed and tone, “Knowing what we do about the position of the doorway in the front bedroom of these flats and the placement of the window, add to that the fact that the window is west-facing therefore gets bright sun in the afternoon hours – just after school when his first afternoon practice session begins – it is not possible that the kit would be set-up on the south side of the room where the wall is short and would have to be placed adjacent to the window where the sun would shine straight into his eyes while he’s trying to play.  That only leaves the space in the front corner of the north side of the room with the kit facing south-“
“John!  How could you be so ignorant?  Have I taught you nothing?”  Sherlock took one of his deep pre-explanation breaths before launching in at top speed:
Sherlock reached up and placed his hands over John’s on the ropes and gently swung the cradle back and forth so that John moved over his length in a swaying motion.  It was utter bliss.  He looked down at his love and saw how abandoned he looked, and felt so much love and tenderness well up in him he thought he’d burst.  What if he ever hurt this man?  Suddenly feeling fiercely protective, he caressed one hand over his face, running his fingers around John’s lips where they enveloped his cock.  John hummed in encouragement and the emotional turmoil and visual feast had him ascending before he was aware of himself.  He gasped and came in a surge, pouring himself into John’s welcoming mouth until he was limp, still gripping the ropes, hanging over John like a slack puppet.
“SHERLOCK!  WHAT THE BLOODY HELL HAVE YOU DONE TO MY BOLLOCKING CREDIT CARD?!  TESCO’S REFUSED IT FIVE TIMES AND I HAD TO LEAVE EVERYTHING THERE AT THE COUNTER.  EVEN THE
The two men stopped for traffic.  Two police cars sped by, lights flashing.  John watched Sherlock gaze longingly after them as they sped off into the distance, no doubt toward some grizzly crime.
”  John matches word with action and sways forward to tap his tongue lightly against his lover’s nipple.  The skin ruches tightly, bewitching him.  He taps again, forcing a small moan from Sherlock.  Oh.  What a lovely sound.  He swipes a lick with the flat of his tongue this time, hoping for a longer sound and is rewarded with a moan that John feels in his core.  “God, Sherlock.  Even the sounds you make get me hot!  Let me hear you.  I want to know what makes you feel good.”
Sherlock hums as they ascend the stairs, coats over their arms.  John goggles at the luscious bottom in front of him as it sways from side to side as Sherlock climbs.  ”God Sherlock.
Nervously Sherlock waved a hand in front of John’s face.  If possible, John’s eyes narrowed even further.  Sherlock swivelled to see why.  Juan’s gaze was locked on Sherlock’s crotch.  The suicidal idiot wiggled his eyebrows again, licked his lips and stuck his hand out in greeting.
Sherlock posed patiently in the room, congratulating himself on completely overwhelming John.  With a bit of luck John would go all night and they’d oversleep in the morning.  He looked up to find John lounging against the doorframe regarding him in a rather too back-in-control-of-himself manner.
“Indeed,” he smiles.  He pets down Sherlock’s back as he closes his eyes and enjoys the feeling of his beautiful lover, quiescent in his arms.
Sherlock’s shoulders lowered as his neck extended giving him an extra two inches.  He eyed John disdainfully.  “I never guess.”
The absurdity of the whole conversation suddenly dawned on John and a snort-giggle burst forth from his nose and mouth.  He dropped a hand down to pet Sherlock’s hair as the urge to laugh grew until he was shaking with the effort to hold it in.  Sherlock peered up at him for a moment, before tentatively smiling.  John opened his knees and Sherlock shuffled forward to get closer to his John, who was now openly laughing.  All felt right in Sherlock’s world when John was happy.  “Come here and give me a kiss, you git”
“Oh that’s better.  Words of one syllable, now.  I’ll have you on straight noises, soon,” he teases.
As he got half way down the hall he heard a low-level humming coming from the bathroom.  “Sherlock?”  he called through the door.
John’s focus is such that he gets lost in his labour of love, investigating armpits, the dip of a waist, the hollow of the small of his back.  Everything is tasted, sniffed and kissed until Sherlock is a trembling mess.  When John moves down to the crease of his buttocks, his sweetheart squirms in anticipation.  He flutters a soft lick in the cleft, teasing his breath over the new moistness there.  Sherlock gasps and pushes his hips off the bed, bowing his back to chase John’s caress.  John gives it happily, licking again, deeper and longer, seeking Sherlock’s taste with his tongue.  He’s rewarded with captivating noises of pleasure, urging him on to further passion.  John sits back on his heels, freeing his hands to tenderly part Sherlock’s cheeks so that he might burrow closer closer, nose deeper into the most personal of intimacies.  John falls, without hesitation, astonished somewhere in the back of his mind that he has no objection to this most louche, private act.  He revels in Sherlock’s complete surrender, indeed, in his
John’s eyebrows were up in his hairline by now.  He’d never heard Sherlock use ‘sorry’ and ‘please’ in one breath, unless he was faking sincerity for manipulative purposes, but right now John could detect nothing but sincerity in Sherlock’s visage.
John snatched it and walked to the lounge, muttering about errant laptops and absent boyfriends.  Nobody listened to him anyway.  He might as well be deleted.
John had to draw on all his reserves not to smile. He rose to his feet and pressed his lips to Sherlock’s Cupid’s bow. He finally grinned and Sherlock allowed himself to look relieved. John nudged Sherlock’s head to the side so he could nuzzle that glorious length of neck giving it a good long lick and a suck, drawing blood to the surface. They both had a little kink for this. They quite enjoyed marking each other territorially. It was fucking HOT. Sherlock groaned languorously, his head hanging forward.
Deaf to John’s pleas, Sherlock froze.  His mouth still full of John, he tried to calm his ire by taking three deep breaths through his nose, but you try doing this with a mouth full of doctor and see how calm you get.
from John signalled the end of any chance at satisfaction.  “Sherlock, please don’t go off the deep end again.  It’s just drumming.  Can we please try to ignore it today and perhaps get back to what we were doing?”
“Wrong, John.  How can you deduce so poorly?  It’s not a man, it’s just a boy – a teenager, about sixteen.  Slight build, left handed, terrible attitude, frequent masturbator, dread locks, wears glasses, mixed race – English father and Afro-Caribbean mother – with porn mags under the mattress.”
doing with it?” he asked, checking he had enough cash for Tesco’s.  “Why’s my credit card not in here?”
As John glances around, the thumping song segues into the next, a deep, pulsing heartbeat of a noise, powering up through his feet to resonate in his core.  It’s an Aussie’s song, well, a remix anyway.  He recalls hearing it live in Sydney when it was first released.  The singer was on tour back at home, and they were untangling an intrigue set up by a demented fan.  As her voice throbs lowly through the speakers, he remembers thinking she had the best belly laugh he’d ever heard.
Sherlock looked down innocently, swivelling his head this way and that, making out like his cock wasn’t hanging about three inches down past the bottom hem of the black silky shorts. “What aren’t they covering, John?”
As they covered the rest of the distance I will tell you, dear reader, that pang of guilt was due to the fact that Sherlock had spent every hour John was away from the flat that week “preparing” those Speedos for today’s lesson.  The preparing involved utilising various results of experiments on lycra, and how the application of bi-carbonate of soda and hot water, along with various gentle acidic reactant agents would inevitably – yet invisibly – weaken the integrity of said lycra.
John had been waiting in the luxurious pool house for over half an hour while Sherlock bashed and crashed about poolside doing mysterious things.  It wasn’t like it was a hardship lying on the chaise sipping boutique beer but he was worried Sherlock was setting up another huge avoidance scheme out there in the vast, deserted country estate.
Sherlock sidled up to his slack-gobbed captain, threw out one hip with a hand on it, leant forward from said hip into John’s panting space and…
John froze.  Sherlock's voice pierced the veil of fog, and he was right.  The thought of that lechy Lothario seeing an aroused Sherlock was the only thing that could bring him to his senses.  Chest heaving, he stepped back letting Sherlock’s arms fall, and let the cold water splash over both of them before taking two steps away to regard Sherlock.
“Look at you, Sherlock!  You’ve only got the sling strap under your waist now.  I’m so proud of you.  How do you feel?”
Sherlock is burning up inside, John’s finger snug in the tight channel, his other hand petting along Sherlock’s back.  He cautiously pulls out a little before pushing back in, deeper than before and draws a shudder from his beloved.  John works his finger slowly, slowly, never giving too much, keeping it easy until time floats by and Sherlock starts to grind back against his hand.  When he’s up to three fingers, it gets a little difficult to keep the angle right, and Sherlock is getting more demanding with his undulations.
Another child ran past, screaming at full volume.  A moment later it was as if a flood gate opened and mothers and children and yelling staff came pelting through the exit as if there were a herd of beasts bringing up the rear.  “Please try to keep your children calm!” The staff were barely audible above the din.  “It’s only a few frogs!  We’ll have them rounded up and caught in no time.  There’s no need to leave!”
“Well derr, it’s obvious!  Look at the fingertips of ya left hand – stringed instrument.  That, added to the fact that you’re left shoulder is slightly higher than ya right and you’ve got a bit of a darker patch of skin on ya neck where ya chinrest sits says it’s a violin.”
“Yes.  Tight clothing - tight enough to hug my arse, and sheer enough to show my torso, areas your eyes are often drawn to - tinted hair, fuck-off boots, eyeliner, a scent by Bulgari, four types of piercings, and a confident attitude.”  Sherlock hesitates.  “The blatant, sensual dancing to That Song was added as a sweetener.”  John could hear the capitals.  “I feel a bit nostalgic over that song to be honest.  It was the first time I was entirely sure of your attraction.  When she sang it you were quite unaware that you were staring at me the whole time,” he ventures wistfully.
“If you don’t get your brilliantly luscious arse over here right now, my little pancake, you’re going to miss out on the best rimming of your life that I will be administering to said arse right after you finish off what you started here not thirty minutes ago AND, NO, DO NOT SPEAK YET because I have deduced while you have been talking, that the no-doubt dreadlocked bugger two doors down has ceased drumming while you were postulating on his parentage and I would like to take advantage of the silence to get you reacquainted with your rhythm before he gets reacquainted with his.”
John, unused to a modest or grateful Sherlock, felt greatly moved.  He had to clear his throat a couple of times before responding.  “You’re so very welcome, Sherlock.  There’s not a lot I can teach you that you don’t already know, but this I can.  And now, I think we’re getting a bit pruney, so let’s hop out for a bit and have a rest and something to eat.”
Red was his favourite colour on Sherlock, well, when said items were a bit not normal, that is.  Items such as heels.  Or stockings.  Or lacy panties.  Or lipstick.  Or nail varnish. Or items that would appear in their future sexcapades but that, for now, were just a body-thrilling anticipation.  Very red items which Sherlock quite indulgently donned for John, loving nothing more than to see how he could make his beloved army captain’s cock rise to the vision of his sweetheart in sexy red things.
John slid his left arm diagonally over and across Sherlock's heaving stomach until his hand settled over the centre of his chest.  "Now listen carefully to me, Sherlock.  First, I want you to loosen that gorgeous cravat so that I can suck on your beautiful neck.  Do it."  Sherlock immediately raised his hands to fumble with the length of linen, drawing it down and to the side, and undoing the collar button of his shirt, exposing the left side of his neck for his John.  John rewarded him with a soft kiss and a lick.  "Perfect.  Good boy," John murmured against Sherlock's neck.  "Next, I want you to place your hands on the backs of my thighs and leave them there until I say otherwise.  Do you think you can do that?"
“I thought we might go out for a walk.  I ordered us some lunch to take with us.  It’s lovely out, but we could stay here and get naughty in the bathtub if you’d rather…” John trailed his fingers through the bath water toward Sherlock’s lap, jerked back and shouted, “Jesus, Sherlock!  That water’s freezing!  Why are you sitting in cold water?  This had better not be some experiment on the stages of frostbite or something!”
What was he thinking?  As crazy as the last three Tuesdays had been, what would they have been like with somebody else?  Well for a start, there would have only been one Tuesday, and it would have involved John sitting poolside reading a novel for an hour, then walking home.  Case closed.  There wouldn’t have been mad, hot cubicle lust with the Black Shorts of Sex.  There would have been no beautiful Red Sherlock bending over the bed in a blaze of red velvet heels.  And there would most definitely not have been any Sexy Sheer Sherlock nor any smiting of Juan by one BAMF Army doctor – take that, Lisping Caramel Spaniard!
“Oh John.  Between us and our immediate families where else is she going to find more people to talk to?” he whispered, without taking his eyes from the window.
Needless to say Sherlock felt every single bit as sexy as he looked.  This was evident in the way he channelled Naomi Campbell, sashaying down the hallway in a Red Blaze (yes, it required capitals, believe me) toward a sadly unsuspecting John, whose eyes nearly bugged out of his head.  Twice.
ever know.  You’ve just spent a week telling me about the life of a kid we’ve never met just by listening to him play the drums, for god’s sake.  I mean, it may all be rubbish…….”
whilst simultaneously swirling his tongue around and around inside the vacuum. Sherlock started panting and thrashing and squealing into the towel. John had trouble staying with him as his arse jiggled and wriggled against his face but he attacked Sherlock’s hips in a pincer move and relentlessly drove his tongue forward, never giving quarter.
“Jooohhn.  I fancy you something rotten.  I simply can not go another day without my lips on you.  Can we please go home and shag ourselves stupid?”
Sherlock’s eyes bulged.  He needed no further prompting.  He backed John up against the wall and reached down for his belt.  John closed his eyes and let the tensions of the morning wash away as he sighed and whispered to Sherlock,
Poor confused John tried to breathe.  He checked his dumpling was fully dressed, grabbed his hand possessively and marched out of the change room slamming some notes down on the manager’s desk as he stalked past.
John opened the door to find his naked detective sitting all-too-innocently in the tub, hands resting in his lap and looking all delicious.  This required further inspection.
John, still in a man meat trance, obediently went to his knees like a zombie zeroing in on brains. “Exactly where would you like me to tuck it, Sherlock? I mean, these pants just aren’t meant for a man of your dimensions and certainly not for swimming in. Where on earth did you get them?”
John demonstrated his skill by drifting his fingers up and over Sherlock’s nipple.  The left one was the weak point, the chink in his armour, the one that always made him squirm.  He placed his lips on Sherlock’s neck where they felt most at home and bit his sweet spot just under his right ear, double-stopping his tongue against the flesh pinched between his teeth.
John stands stiffly, staring at himself in the mirror while Sherlock circles him like a shark, humming and hawing.
God.  He’d forgotten the lyrics.  He remembers now how appropriate they were to his one-sided obsession with Sherlock.
Once everything was as he wanted, John tucked a hand under Sherlock’s hair to clasp his nape and drew him down for a gentle kiss.  He climbed on the bed on his back and gestured for Sherlock to straddle his chest.
Sherlock sensed his sleeve may have contained a bigger trick than he originally thought. He was starting to deduce he’d shorted-out John’s brain. Time for a re-boot, perhaps. He put on his best coy look lowered his head and fluttered a lash.
Sherlock covers the hand over his heart and slides it down his chest until it hits a little bump in the road.  A bump much firmer than a simple nipple could possibly be.  His breath stops.  Completely.
He presses his lips to the centre of Sherlock’s chest, tracing little nips and licks across his skin.  He drags his mouth across the ivory column of his neck, stopping to nuzzle into the corded muscle as Sherlock tilts his head in encouragement.  Sweet sounds fall from his lover’s lips as he blindly reaches for Sherlock’s hands and places them on his hips, encouraging him to reciprocate.  “Touch me too, Sherlock,” he gasps.
Moving quietly and cautiously, still clutching the Speedos, John lifted away the sheet revealing the miles and miles of back and consulting arse beneath.
“-I’ve noticed an increased level of preoccupation in you this week.  Is it all to do with Tuesday?”
Sherlock drags those long, supple fingers up John’s back, eliciting a shiver.  He feels his ridiculously tight shirt being dragged out of his trousers and the action being repeated, only this time from underneath the fabric.  “Oh Joohn.  I can feel the horripilation of your skin!”
Normal transmission resumed on Sherlock’s face.  “Oh thank god, John.  I thought-“ he shuddered. “Nothing.  I can’t even say it.  Just so that nothing happens to it you’d better hide it in here” he deadpanned, turning and bending over the kitchen table.
"Oh, when you beg so nicely... Here, remove my glove for me, love."  John splayed his hand and placed the tip of his index finger in front of Sherlock's mouth.  Sherlock bit delicately at the seam until he could feel John slide his finger slightly down the leather.  The middle finger was presented and again, Sherlock carefully took the tip into his teeth and held while John's finger slid down.  After the ring finger was done, Sherlock re-bit John's middle seam-tip so that John might remove his hand from the glove.  John reached up and took the glove from his teeth.  “Perfect boy,” he whispered, lovingly stroking the soft kid across Sherlock's lips and down the side of his face.  Sherlock heard the gauntlet plop to the floor.
“Mmmmn?”  John stares at that little ball, nestled under Sherlock’s lip.  His tongue darts out to moisten his own lips.  Sherlock groans.
The crop was in his left hand and he employed it to wiggle its way inside the placket.  John trailed the leather keeper down the left side of Sherlock's dick.  He could feel his gorgeous boy shudder in his arms.  John manoeuvred the keeper until it rested beneath heavy, full testicles, raising and lowering the crop's shaft to create a gentle bouncing of the balls sitting on the fold of leather.
Sherlock could see the untamed glint to John's glazed look, the savage heat on his face.  He looked totally unfocused, unaware of his surroundings and Sherlock huffed a nervous laugh and struggled prettily in his grasp.
“Something’s happened.  He hasn’t finished a single piece.  He’s started nineteen pieces and played them all perfectly fine, if a little aggressively, but hasn’t seen a single one through to the end.  It’s almost like when I’m…”  John heard Sherlock’s indrawn breath.  “No!”
” John hissed as he elbowed him in the side.  “I think this might be a bit of a big revelation for her.  That’s what she’s been working out.  It’s a bit massive” he whispered.
of dealing with this. One of those ways is to get Sherlock all lovely and riled up, and then just, well,
There was a tense silence, where only the soft sounds of their panting could be heard.  They stared at each other as they slowly calmed.
Juan posed before them in all his cocky caramel perfection.  John noted arms of smooth, muscled skin – were there only two of them? – legs that ended in a disgustingly perky arse, and a face made up of parts sensuous enough to melt pants.
To him, Sherlock’s body was like a beautiful and complicated instrument.  John had tenderly and carefully been studying, observing and nurturing his knowledge of it and now that he had mastered it he had no trouble bringing to life all the little dynamics no one else would be able to coax from it.  John acknowledged this was because Sherlock’s instrument would only ever be mastered by someone
At John’s silence, Sherlock laid his head in John’s lap and clutched at his hips and whispered, “Please, John.  Don’t be upset that I want to float your spunk.”
He stilled momentarily. “Is everything OK, my love?” Sherlock nodded vigorously and pushed back against the invasion. John groaned softly into Sherlock’s ear.  Soft, dark curls tickled his nose as he drifted it along that acreage of neck.
A soft wind fluttered the feathers of the pigeon roosting on the shoulder of the bronze.  From its vantage point it could see two rapidly moving heads – one sandy, one dark and softly curled.  Beneath those heads an inquisition was in progress.
The taller man shook his head slightly, as if to clear it and meekly responded, “I know, John.  I know I need to learn but you know I’ve kept my word – I haven’t jumped into the Thames to retrieve evidence for over a month.”
Sherlock wedged a hand between himself and the bed and whimpered, rubbing as hard as he dared, while John settled in with a steady rhythm.  As he fucked and ground his hips into his beloved’s hind quarters he ran his hands all over that expanse of back, and down those endless legs revelling in the beauty before him.  John is a smart man.  He could see that all that beauty wasn’t just physical.  What he was witnessing was a man of pride and strength, who was willing to trust him enough to lead him to places of pleasure without fear of humiliation.  John’s chest swelled with pride that it was
“Obvious, John.  Listen to what he’s playing.  And he’s playing it technically solid and true, regimented, not with feeling.  He’s learning it for the school musical where the drums have to keep everyone in time, not to show-off his skills.”  Sherlock punched his phone, held it to his ear and wandered over to the window and threw it open.  “Mycroft!  How are you, brother mine?... Nothing, can’t I just phone to see how you are?... What music?...  I can’t hear anything, Mycroft.  I think you’ve got tinnitus… Mycroft?  Hello?  Hello?  HA!  Hilarious, John!”
“SMOOTH?!” he yelled in the thankfully empty change room.  “TTTHHHMOOOOOOTH?!” he mimicked nastily as he planted his hands on Sherlock’s chest and pushed him forcefully toward a shower someone had left running.  “Why don’t we just pop in here and I can show you
“Yes.  We’ll just go get changed and meet you poolside.  Come along Sherlock!”  John grabbed the elbow of the Belstaff just in case and marched them from the office to the change room in double-quick time.  Sherlock scurried along after him.
As they kneel facing each other, quick pecks are dropped onto John’s lips.  “As if I’d be bothered.”  Peck.  “If
So Monday evening saw Sherlock leave John at the kitchen table, plugging away at his two-fingered blogging while he quietly slunk down the hallway and shut himself in their room.
But all this is nothing compared to the shirt.  Oooooh the shirt.  Innocuous enough from the front – if you ignore the fact that the fluorescent lighting emanating from the bathroom renders it sheer – the back is a ladder of lateral rips and tears that shows more skin than it covers.  Waaay more.  The creamy skin of Sherlock’s endless back is there for John’s eyes to feast upon, for his imagination to
“And what would you need- no, once again, I’d rather not know… What about the Trex, Sherlock?  Are we thinking of making some kind of pastry treat to take with us?”
John can’t understand it all, it’s too much, he’s too open, he’s whirling, he’s out of control, can’t comprehend, can’t centre himself .  He’s everything all at once.
types of piercings?  Surely you mean three.”  John points to Sherlock’s brow, nose and lip.  The git lifts one corner of his mouth, his confidence back in a big way.
"Sherlock, Sherlock, what are you doing to me?  My beautiful boy, my gorgeous marvel.  You're being so good for me.  So perfect.  Look at you.  You want me to see you, don't you.  You want me to see how affected you are, how much you want this.  You get off on me knowing how much you get off on me knowing.  Oh God," John groaned into Sherlock's neck, pressing kisses up and down the length.
Sherlock had a bit of a think about that. John had been working on him for weeks to take swimming lessons and no amount of distraction (with naked bits) or cajoling (with tongues) or negotiation (with pouting) had swayed John from his path. So here they were at the local leisure centre. But Sherlock was not a Holmes for nothing. He still had one more trick up his sleeve.
from the dance floor and toward the coatroom.  His arms are stuffed into his jacket unceremoniously, and cold air hits his face as he is thrust through the door of the club toward a magically waiting cab.
As John wandered away shaking his head he heard Sherlock shift and the low humming became audible again.
Sherlock stills.  He stares intently, searching for something unknown to John.  After about a million thundering heartbeats, his face relaxes into something more open and vulnerable than John has ever witnessed.  “You, John.  Just you.”
His voice came slowly, monotonically, “He’s like me, John,” he intoned.  “He’s got something big on his mind and he’s using music to get his mind to work.  That’s why he can’t concentrate on any one piece.”  Sherlock came out of his trance and swivelled to face John.  “John, we’ve got to talk to him.  We’ve got to introduce me to him so he knows he’s not the only freak out there.”  His eyes dropped.
the bloody poetry, you know.  The way you were moving your body on that dance floor was poetry in every sense of the word”
“We’ll just get Lestrade to bring lots of crime scene pictures to us here.  We’d only have to go out for a nine or a ten.”
John sensed something afoot. Sherlock asked way too prettily, and since when did he start saying ‘please’ unless he was begging in the throes of passion? He probably had some cockamamie plan he thought would distract John. Well his little sweetmeat had much to learn. John took a deep breath and steeled himself before pushing open the door and coming to an abrupt stop.
“Sherlock!  Thank God you’re home – get in here.  This gear you left on my bed…..I can’t go out in this!  I look like a tosser.”  John tugs uncomfortably at his shirt, and tries to dig a finger under the centre seam of his trousers, which are trying to migrate up his arse, taking his pants along for the journey.
“John, don’t you see?  When I’m worshiping your body I have music already playing in my head.  How can I possibly focus with a competing rhythm?  This boy is putting me off!  There must be something we can do… An ASBO perhaps…?”
Before he knew it was coming, John felt a tear race up and over his eye and down his cheek.  He tilted forward and pressed his cheek to Sherlock’s and linked his hands behind Sherlock’s neck
“Interestingly, the lifespan of sperm can actually be extended when ejaculated into warm water, such as in baths, spa pools, warm springs etc.  You see, the proteins in the semen-“
For three Tuesdays now John had been pushing (and Sherlock had been pulling, like some demented tug ‘o’ war) his love into swimming lessons at the local leisure centre but to date Sherlock’s toes had failed to make contact with the water.  John was determined today was the day.
Sherlock’s agenda demanded he lead this scenario but the delicious temptation to follow John’s order was too much for him.  Dressed in all his fiery finery he felt feminine and fucking gorgeous and he just wanted to please John in whatever way John desired.  He
"God, yes.  Delicious, tantalising, plumpened, fat, perfect Sidecock, Sherlock.  I'm naming it.  It's getting a capital letter and everything.  All I can see is Sidecock belonging to you and in a building full of fucking masterpieces it's still the prettiest thing I've seen all day."
hear a difference.  The playing wasn’t as crisp, as articulate as usual.  It was much more laid back.  He told Sherlock what he heard.
“Sherlock that’s extraordinary.  I can’t believe how interested you seem in learning now, after avoiding it for so long.  What’s going on?”
John’s gaze dropped again. There was now an extra visible inch. His eyebrows rose and his eyeballs glazed over. “Although we did have fun in the cell, as I recall… " John’s voice drifted away…
“Ah, John… I’m almost ready, but I think there’s a thread hanging down on my bathers. It’s annoying my sensitive skin. You know how sensitive my skin is, John. Can you come in and remove it for me? Please.”
Sherlock grinned at him over his shoulder.  “Mmmm that’s it John.  You’re safe now.  Just stay hidden here forever.”
John dragged him up, kissed his dazed lips and gently turned him around positioning his hands for him against the tiled wall. He nudged one of Sherlock’s feet to widen his stance and pulled back on his hips. “Thrust that delectable arse out for me, Sherlock” he growled into Sherlock’s ear. John could feel goosebumps rise along Sherlock’s spine. He ran a hand down his back a few times to gentle him a bit before gripping his own cock with one hand and sliding his other up Sherlock’s neck and around and over his mouth. “You must be quiet while I’m fucking your arse, my sweet. If anyone comes in we’ll be chucked out before you get off and we don’t want that, do we.” Sherlock obediently nodded then shook his head under John’s hand.
“Don’t try to be bloody demure with me! You know exactly what I mean. Those shorts, they’re… they- they’re… "
no modesty. That’s why you’ve come half-way across the city dressed in underwear masquerading as bathers, two sizes too small, knowing full well you wouldn’t be able to attend class in them. You know, I should make you go out there in them. I should make you walk out there and get in that pool with the others with your cock hanging out your pants. The only thing stopping me is the fact that the rest of the class are children, and we’d be arrested. And I’m pretty sure we can’t count on Mycroft to bail us out after that last thing with the turtles... and the cheese.”
The next few days saw John just about at the end of his tether.  Sherlock was driving him mad over the drumming.  He had to somehow turn things around so he could get some peace.  Well, as much peace as you could get with a frequently practicing drummer two doors down.  They were clearing away some mugs and plates from the sink together when John had a thought.
John knows that Sherlock often guesses, but the guesses were based on other, more sound deductions so he never squabbled with him.  Ignoring the hairy eyeball he asked, “Well what about the mixed parentage and the dreads?  Explain those!”
Of course, where they were involved, nothing could be simple.  Just as Sherlock was starting to get that glazed look in his eye that indicated boredom - approximately four minutes after arrival - John noticed the detective's attention sharpening.  His distraction was such that John had to apologetically answer for him several times as they were introduced around by the host.  Having reached his limit, John excused them and steered Sherlock toward a quiet corner, only to be informed that one of the footman-dressed waiters was relieving the guests of their valuables.  Unfortunately his and Sherlock's idea of a 'quiet resolution' to this situation differed greatly, and now they were the only guests remaining after the boisterous tackling of the ‘footman’, the recovery and redistribution of the pelf, the formal arrest and giving of statements, and the trickling away of shocked and/or excited guests.
Without looking up Sherlock said, “If you stay like that for much longer, John, I’ll think you’re broken and may have to trade you in for a less defective model.”  He finally looked up and smirked, “Although I can think of some interesting things to pop into that mouth whilst it’s open…”
Then Saturday night and Sunday arrived.  John felt like The Hunchback of Notre Dame, but instead of hearing bells it was drums.  Sherlock, on the other hand, was fascinated.  He was pacing around the living room, hands steepled, index fingers stroking down and under his chin.
“Ha!  Knew that’d snap you out of it!  Of course I don’t doubt you.  I’ve known you too long and have seen you solve too many cases to doubt you, you big idiot.”  He leaned in and pressed a sweet kiss to Sherlock’s indignant lips.
Agh.  Now he remembers tossing off that night to the thought of running his hands all over Sherlock while the detecting angel danced in front of him.  Droplets of cold water suddenly sprinkle down on John’s face, making him jump guiltily at his carnal thoughts.
“Sherlock!  I’m the one in control here this time, so you don’t need to worry about being put off your rhythm.  I’m quite capable of performing,  drum beat or no, so just lie there and enjoy,” he threatened.
Sherlock turned to John with widened eyes and an excited grin.  “See!  I told you.  I haven’t played my violin since they moved in and she knows, she
The boys were cuddling on the floor in front of the sofa, John stroking his cutie’s locks back from his forehead, when he recalled an unjustified deduction.  “What about the frequent masturbation and porn under the bed, Sherlock.  How could you possibly have known about that from his drumming?”
John chuffs a laugh as he parts Sherlock’s legs and settles between them, supporting his weight on his arms, either side of Sherlock’s shoulders.  The position presses their cocks together, and every breath has them slipping and sliding against each other in delicious friction.  Sherlock bends a leg, pressing it to John’s hip, gathering him in closer.  John stills and looks down at Sherlock, lets his eyes fall to the plump, lush bow and, unable to wait another second, lowers his head to sip sip sip at the offerings.  He inches back to check in on him and breathes in reverence at the intimacy of the moment.  Sherlock is gazing up at him, eyes wide, pupils blown, the fingers of one hand twitching in the air beside his head.  He leans in again, offering something longer, sweeter, swiping a quick little lick along the seam of Sherlock’s lips before pressing and retreating.
“OK, that’s that.  You’re perfect.  I’ll just be a few minutes and then we’ll go.”  Sherlock whirls and strides toward the bathroom.  John stands rooted to the spot, stuck in stunned-mullet mode.
the bedroom.  The drumming stopped and the boy’s husky voice could be heard to shout, “What the bloody bollocking hell?  Who the crap is chuckin’ rocks into my room?”
John stiffened.  His arms came down to his sides and his hands clenched.  He stuck out his chin and exhaled.  “Sherlock, look at me.  Look at me right now.”
“Ah, John,” he started carefully, ”do you think we should explain that I only need to learn the very basics – floating and a bit of paddling – just enough so that I don’t drown John.  John.
First step required a bit of dexterity and lube.  Done.  Next, he drew a chair up to his mirror and circled his mouth with the sticky gloss.  Then his nails – in retrospect, probably should have done those earlier as they need a bit of time to dry… damn.  A quick crack of the door to check on John:  “
"Ooh…"  Sherlock panted and shook as he felt John gently unhitch the wrist loop from around his balls.  He heard the crop clatter against the floor.  He felt John's hands smooth up his stomach and over his pectorals, coming to rest over his heart, cupping the thud under his palms.  He could feel John rest his cheek between his shoulder blades then, after a while, press a kiss to the nape of his neck, nosing his queue out of the way.
John blinks himself to life.  “Sherlock,” John protests, peering concernedly at the straining buttons, “that makes it look even
Maintaining eye contact John moved his hand down to Sherlock’s thigh and scratched it upward slowly until he reached a rapidly hardening cock and gave it a good, firm squeeze.  The hand slipped around the back and grabbed a palm full of bounty and squeezed again.  Two very aroused boys panted in each other’s faces.  Fingers edged closer to crease and pushed Speedo into crack.  Sherlock pushed his hips away from the wall and into John’s heat.  John started rutting against Sherlock’s thigh.  He dipped his head and in his primal haze, sucked and bit at Sherlock’s neck, marking what was his.  He leaned back to survey his handywork, feral lust clouding his vision…
.  I don’t know why I didn’t think of it first-off.  We just have to find someone who can let us use their private pool”
Things had gone quiet.  John looked at Sherlock and saw faint worry and what he thought may have been
“Would you now consider this semen yours, mine, or perhaps… belonging to the universe?  Because I was thinking, if the two proteins were mixed as they are here, I could test to see if-“
Just then they arrive at the centre.  Shrill voices emerge from inside.  As they’re about to step up to pay a small boy runs gleefully under the turnstile, chasing after something moving so quickly it’s just a green streak.
John leant forward and laid a quick peck on Sherlock’s cheek before drawing slightly back to peer down at his own cock clutched in his hand. He marked time around Sherlock's entrance, ringing the pucker with his swollen head before marching slowly forward until seated to the hilt.
“We’ll be requiring Juan less lesson than we thought.  Sorry.” (sounding anything but), and rushed them both outside as quickly as he could.
John reaches up to grip purple hair, tugging Sherlock’s face into closer proximity to his.  “Sherlock, if you are toying with me…”
John gazes at newly-minted boyfriend.  He’s never heard Sherlock dwindle-off.  Sherlock always makes Statements with a capital S.  To see him unsure and slightly bewildered is disconcerting, but to know he feels comfortable enough to expose that in front of
As he gazed up at the window in awe, Sherlock’s smile widened into a full-on shit-eating grin.  He turned excitedly to John.  “Oh yes, YES!  The game has a new player, John.”
John placed his hands reverently on those luscious globes and gently pressed his thumbs inward to spread Sherlock’s cheeks revealing the sweet pucker within. Again John paused, this time just to reflect and let his brain absorb all that he was thankful for. How on earth was he lucky enough to be here in this tiny cubicle with this lanky angel, being momentarily in command of said angel no less? John thanked someone for small mercies, then stopped musing and like the good tiny tyrant we know he is, he
Eyes still on the screen, Sherlock waved his hand around imperiously.  “Yes, John.  Vegetable shortening”
Whilst begging Sherlock had started gripping John’s head and thrusting against his face and to tell the truth, John couldn’t take much more of his sweetie’s gripping and thrusting without wanting to jump him, so it was no skin off his nose to surrender to Sherlock’s request. Without standing up John grabbed Sherlock’s hips and spun him about face. He slid his thumbs into the waistband of the little black shorts and dragged them down to just below the crease of Sherlock’s buttocks. John indulged one of his cutie’s little kinks and employed his best army voice, “Bend forward and put your hands on the wall, Sherlock. Now.” Sherlock shivered all over and immediately complied. “Do you want me to lick your arse? Do you want to feel my tongue in your hole, Sherlock? Or should I spank that naughty arse for all the time it’s wasted today?”
While John is struggling with reality vs fantasy, Sherlock leans in, busses a kiss on his cheek, slithers around in front of him, grabs his hand and takes off for the dance floor.  Bodies snake and twist sinuously around them, pulsing with the beat like one, huge, swaying beast, each swept up in the collective rise and fall of the tide.  Dazed, John peers up at Sherlock, transfixed at the sight of the diaphanous fabric clinging to Sherlock’s febrile frame.  Sweat already runs down his body, forging a glistening path between his pectoral muscles.
"It's hardly method, John.  Haven't you heard of gentlemen having to choose a direction in which to dress?"
He closes his eyes and draws in as much breath as he can, sampling the air for their scent, drawing the very marrow of their pairing out of the air and into his lungs where he can hold it deep within.  His eyelids fill with sparkles as his lungs beg for release.  He opens his eyes and sees Sherlock watching him.  Without a word, Sherlock leans in and covers John’s mouth with his own, coaxing it open, and takes John’s exhalation for his own.
“Therlock, ith it?”  Sherlock froze like a deer in headlights.  Oh no, this was soooo not good.  Juan had a Spanish lispy inflection to his English.  He couldn’t imagine this was going to improve the situation any.  In fact, John was going to go ballistic.
“Well done, John.  It’s just too sloppy, not up to his usual standard.  But there’s a bit too much control for alcohol.  I’d say it’s more laid-back stoned.  Wonder if it has anything to do with dulling the hand pain from yesterday or just youthful caprice.”
"It's lucky I love your pouty-face.  In fact, if you come over here and put that pout on me I'll cook your favourite dinner."
Clothing launches over John’s shoulder as he complies.  He checks himself and pauses for a moment, standing patiently at ease before the bed, offering Sherlock a chance to study what he beholds.  Regardless of Sherlock’s impatience, John knows he will need to observe and inspect.  He holds for another breath before his body decides any further scrutinising can wait until later.  He circles Sherlock’s ankle, thumbing the hollow alongside his Achilles.  He sees the hairs rise on his shin.  “Goose pimples.”
“Nah, shut up, right!  I’ve had a fight with my dad because of a black eye from a fight at school, then I fell off my bike and twisted my wrist when I had a brand new stupid piece to learn for the school play.  I went to a party to try to mellow out a bit, if ya know what I mean, and met a girl I thought I could be friends with only I’ve stuffed-up even that now!” the ghostly voice wailed.
John's breath was quite stolen away.  The lacing was so slack John could see that Sherlock's cock was firming, but not yet so firm as to be stiff.  It was John's perfect, most favourite state of Sherlock's cock - thickened, so as to have heft, yet not so tumescent as to be stiff beyond pliability.  John loved nothing more than taking Sherlock's cock in his mouth in this state, where it was fattened yet supple enough to mold against the roof of his mouth with the flat press of his tongue.  That exact perfect state of cock was now visible through the slack opening, and if Sherlock was throwing down his gauntlet then John was absolutely picking it up.
He pushed a stunned Sherlock through a cubicle door and locked it firmly behind them.  He started shrugging off his shirt as Sherlock watched in surprise.
Sherlock’s eyes widened and he shuddered.  “I wonder if he’d like to come out with us to see something at Ronnie Scott’s.  We’ve got to steer him toward jazz instead of reggae!”
“Sure, sure you’re not.  Listen here – you’re just gonna have to get in line, mate, because I’m having a bit of a shit time right now, thanks.  I’m trying to settle in to a new home and a new school, and I’ve just had the worst week of my life.”
"But- oh, well it's all a matter of perspective, John.  Sir Thomas was criticised for being too flattering in his portrayal of the Prince, as he was known to be overweight and... that's so...  it was said to be too elegant a likeness but - uh – oh oh oh ohhh - the perspective of the artist is...the perspective, the perspective, John.  John.  Please."
Grey eyes popped up, and a toussled head swivelled toward John.  “It’s true.  Well, depending on your diet, that is.  Sometimes is sinks if it’s thin and watery.”
Sherlock tugged on the string and John ripped the waistband down as far as he could get it but his chest impeded the journey.  “Hang on and lift one leg for me”.  Sherlock huffed a laugh and cocked a leg up so John could stretch the togs all the way off until they hung around one knee.  “Thank fuck.  Now give me back your cock and tilt forward”.
After the debacle of last Tuesday’s non-swimming lesson, dear reader, John had determinedly gone out and bought Sherlock a pair of regular old Speedos.  In John’s mind, there wouldn’t be any way Sherlock could possibly derail his lesson with these in the way that he had last Tuesday.
Now John found himself and Sherlock alone on opposite sides of the salon.  John was sucked toward Sherlock like a puck across an air hockey table.  His view of the pantaloons was now uninhibited by the dress coat, as it had been shucked during the tackling.  John could see Sherlock's perfect lanky form from the toes of his boots through the charcoal waistcoat with dove grey fleur-de-lis, to the top of his gentle curls, drawn back into a dashing queue.  Breathing deeply to steady himself at the arresting sight, John drew up on his left, looking up at the painting that was consuming Sherlock's attention.
Juan, John fumed.  In John’s head the enemy was attacking via water, and he was the bloody idiot who’d sent him the co-ordinates.  Well there was nothing for it – bugger the Army, under the circumstances he was going to have to commandeer the Navy.  He was going to have to marshal some subs and a pissing bloody periscope to keep an eye on this
“John? What’s wrong?” His little love had the gall to blink innocently at him, unfortunately to no effect as John’s gaze was distinctly southward.
“Of course I love you, you bloody great giraffe.  And you love me – you must, to have gone to all this trouble,” he laughs, touching the lip ring reverently.  “So come on – let’s get naked.”  He grabs Sherlock’s arse cheek and pushes it toward the giraffe’s bedroom.  “In here’s okay?”
John felt his ire deflate.  “I’m sorry, Sherlock.  I thought you were only thinking about the leisure time afterwards…”
“What on earth’s happening here?!” John laughed, looking up at Sherlock.  His laughter died a slow death.
Afterward they shower lazily together, kissing and laughing, then get ready for the walk across town to the leisure centre.
A moist mouth consulted his cock and found it in need of some major satisfaction.  Sherlock’s head bobbed gently giving John much, much pleasure.  John sighed again, dropped his head back against the cubicle wall and placed his hands on Sherlock’s head, caressing the soft curls.
John moaned deep in his throat sending vibrations all along Sherlock’s length.  Overcome and overwhelmed, Sherlock dropped one hand to cup John’s face and looked at him and cried, “I love you, John!  Take everything... everything I’ve got to give” and you can bet that that great man lying underneath all that beauty going on above him heard and saw all that vulnerable, unconcealed rawness and did indeed take it all – every last drop.  He took it all inside and wrapped it up in his own heart and swore he’d protect it with his life, if it came to it again.
to feel his mark on his lover.  “Sherlock!” he panted.  “Quickly!  Get the fucking drawstring undone.  I need to touch you.  I need to feel
.  He gave it a nicely judged six seconds for maximum impact, then slung his hip in the other direction and nudged the table back a smidge.  John’s hands thunked from the keyboard into his lap.  Slinking forward Red Sherlock raised one obscenely shod foot and placed it on John’s upper thigh for another stunning moment then leant forward and placed his beautiful red-tipped fingers on his delicately strapped ankle and voluptuously dragged those fingers up his smooth stockinged leg, taking at least a whole minute to reach the zenith.
Sherlock sat obediently and looked expectantly at John.  The good doctor placed his hands on Sherlock’s knees, took a deep breath and began.
The contents of Sherlock’s slide seemed to be fascinating.  “No, John.  It’s just that once you place your bodily fluids into my body I consider them to be my property, and I can therefore do what I like with them,” he calmly murmured into the microscope stage.
Sherlock placed a long index finger on John’s lips and carefully let his foot slide down John’s side, bringing his other around so that he was straddling John’s hips and, linking his arms around his neck slowly sank down onto John’s lap.
“John,” Sherlock breathes, wide-eyed, “my John.”  The Fingers stroke John’s cheek.  “I know I calculated everything perfectly, but I still can’t believe it worked.  That I’m here, touching you, hearing you say you love me.”  Sherlock looks slightly startled.
John pressed Sherlock back against him again with his right hand, whilst reaching into the pantaloons with his left.  He touched the tips of his fingers to cock, feeling the straining length against his sensitive, recently un-gloved skin.  He knew Sherlock was close.  It wouldn't take much to tip him over the edge, and John wanted to be right there with him.
“Sure, Sherlock.  In a bit” he murmured lazily, absently stroking.  The silence stretched comfortably.  He didn’t want this peaceful feeling to end.  Eventually Sherlock cleared his throat.
Sherlock’s eyes met his blankly.  “I don’t want to ever hear you say that again.  You are NOT a freak.”  John grabbed Sherlock’s face between his palms and moved his own right up into it.  “YOU… are the most incredible, luminous…
John returned to the action at the front line. He could see Sherlock was nice and relaxed now and he was able to slip his tongue back in quite easily and wiggle. He spread Sherlock’s cheeks even wider and made a seal around the pucker with his lips and
Sherlock reclined on the lounge in Baker Street, stretched one long leg over the back and languidly enjoyed a moment of rest.  John was out getting provisions as they’d let the cupboard run down a bit this last week.  He let a hand drape across his chest and closed his eyes, enjoying the feeling of being thoroughly debauched.  John had really let him have it when they got home and he was in no position (well, many positions, actually) to refuse his bossy little autocrat after the way he let Sherlock take the reins at the pool.  Who would have known swimming lessons would be so rewarding.  He wondered what his reward would be if he got up to paddling…
John hissed. “Take the towel and stuff some of it into your mouth, for god’s sake”. Sherlock docilely did as he was told.
Sherlock prowls closer to John, nudging in between his legs.  John grips Sherlock’s hips and leans forward to ghost his nose across the golden trail of hair under his navel.  He gifts a kiss to his belly before fumbling clumsily with the belt buckle.  “Shit!”  He hears a puff of a snort from above and mutters, “shut up.  I’m trying to be seductive.”
It seemed they were destined to always be on duty.  Tonight was supposed to be a thank you party in honour of Sherlock and himself, for the recovery of two stolen paintings.  A wealthy collector was about to place two valuable paintings on permanent loan to The National, when they had taken an unexpected detour en-route to the gallery, and the boys had been engaged to recover them.  The grateful owner threw a party in the private salon where the paintings were to be displayed - what wonders money could achieve! - and John spent the past fortnight convincing Sherlock it would be rude if the guests of honour weren't in attendance.  Admittedly, it wasn't quite as difficult once it was revealed the guests (befitting the era of the artworks) were to wear Regency period costume - Sherlock loved a good excuse to look fabulous in a tailored outfit, and off he hied to his indefatigable tailor.
The thought forces a growl from John’s throat as he lunges to capture the head between his lips, suckling gently and running his tongue across the slit.
All quiet on the Baker Street front.  No whirring.  No grunting.  No deliveries.  No home improvement injuries.  Sun was shining, birds were singing.  John decided he was due some quality time with his love, taking a walk and some lunch in the park.  He phoned downstairs for some takeaway and went in search of Sherlock.
Sherlock stood staring at an unfinished portrait of George IV, hands clasped behind his back.  The private room of The National Gallery still held a few traces of evidence of the lavish party held within but a few hours earlier.  Most of the napkins and stemware had been removed, along with the host, guests, staff and police.  A few stray side tables and empty champagne bottles remained to keep the two handsomely clad boys company.
"Jesus bloody wept," John whispered under his breath, eyes mesmerised by the buttocks straining the stitching of the pantaloons currently lovingly encasing Sherlock's magnificent cheeks.  John watched the gentle wobble of said cheeks as Sherlock strode ahead of him, hessians tapping out an echo on the marble floor of the National.
They laughed as they got John naked and positioned in the sling.  It was a bit different to the floating one.  This one was more like a laid-back cradle with spots for John to put his feet that reminded him of the stirrups in the surgery.  He suddenly empathised with the many women he’d so casually ordered up into them.  To say he was feeling a bit vulnerable was putting things lightly.
Bloody need to go do that typing course…”  Excellent, he’d be backspacing for ages.  Next the red stockings and over those the hopefully-never-to-be-swum-in Speedos John bought him.  Pull drawstring tight and tie.  And for the jewel in the crown – those heart-halting heels.
The moment the pair are through the door, John takes a deep breath and tries to settle his nerves.  Just the thought of getting his hands on Sherlock is mind blowing, so he’s going to have to put his libido on lock-down in order to focus.  He wants this to be something more than just fucking, just lust-filled sex.  More than something Sherlock could get from anyone in that club.  More than something
But poor John was on overload, experiencing a whirlwind of emotions and had tuned-out Sherlock’s voice.  The cave man club beat was pulsing away harder than ever as he continued to stare startledly at Sherlock’s half-exposed cock.  But heaped on top of that was a maelstrom of feelings: relief, for one, (at not having to let Don Juan near Sherlock again) embarrassment for another, (at being about to walk out on a booking for the third week in a row) and sheer, bloody anger (what the HELL was wrong with the manufacturing industry these days, anyway?!)
“-here so that we can improve the chances of you surviving the next time The Work finds you spluttering around somewhere between the surface and the depths of The Thames. I will not watch you almost drown one more time. Now come out of that change room before I come in there and drag you out.”
John simmered with bile.  He wondered if this guy could make speaking sound any more like a sex act if he tried.  He couldn’t believe he was paying for this.
And as Sherlock told John about the case, the back of his tricky mind was already thinking about next Tuesday, wondering about the veracity of the claims on sex toy packaging, and just how waterproof ‘waterproof’ meant…
Sherlock’s eyes narrow.  The perceptive organs shift over John’s body quickly.  His mouth tightens.  Leaning forward, he drops his head down to John’s ear and with lips touching the whorls, murmurs, “It is, you know”.
"Is one of those directions 'north', love, because that's how you appear to be dressed at the moment?!"
Was Sherlock complimenting him?!  At the thought, John shivers again.  “Are you OK, John?  Are you cold?  I can assure you, this fabric will feel all too hot when we get to where we’re going.”  Sherlock reaches out and runs The Fingers through John’s hair, elegantly mussing it in a way that John wouldn’t be able to manage with a mirror, product and half an hour.  John stands there submissively, overawed at all this Sherlockian attention.
Sherlock swallowed, got up from the table and slowly approached John, hands out in a calming gesture, to kneel at John’s feet.  “I’m sorry, John.”  John’s eyes widened.  “Please don’t give anyone else your semen.  I-I…I don’t mean to lessen the importance of your ejaculate by experimenting on it, If anything, it’s the opposite – I only want to use
He slides the button through the slit and lowers the zipper – not an easy feat on jeans this tight – and hears Sherlock sigh in relief as his cock falls out, heavy and full.
“Oh no, I’m not finished yet.  I’m on a roll here.”  John waved his arms about, gesticulating dramatically.  “I could go visit the sperm bank, see if they need any donations.  How about I drop back in to Baskerville?  I’m sure they’d remember my face down there.  I could pop in for a quick wank in case they’re a bit short on supplies for their heinous and illegal doings.  What about-“
him – they roam and map John’s skin as if they were committing it to memory for future sculpting, they touch as if John’s skin were braille poetry, his elegant fingers sensitively skimming, reading the words of yearning on John’s body.  Right now, however, in the real world, as he stares so hard he goes cross-eyed, the Fingers-Of-His-Fantasies are about to make contact with the tiny pieces of plastic currently holding his modesty together.  Target acquired, Sherlock fastens the button over his collarbone, knuckles brushing his suddenly damp skin.  John shivers.
A rustling sound emanated from across the room as John peered over his newspaper to see his dishevelled lover adjusting the focus of his microscope whilst peering into the eyepiece.  “Sherlock, even for you, that’s a bit apropos of nothing.”
While he had been speaking, Sherlock had edged closer and closer to a stupefied John, slipping his hands onto John’s arse, pulling him close to his undulating hips.  John edges his shoulders back to focus on Sherlock’s face.
John jerks a mini thrust up into Sherlock in response.  “Bloody hell, you feel so good inside me, John.”  Sherlock starts to rock, undulating on his lap.  His movements get stronger and multidirectional.  John watches him dance, breathless with wonder.  The figure of eight movements from the club make an appearance, forging a dirty grind across his pelvis.
John looked up from his paper and waited for Sherlock to elucidate.  The silence persisted.  The detective was frozen in place but John couldn’t see his face from his angle.  He stood and approached Sherlock carefully, trying not to disturb him lest he was on the verge of something but when he glimpsed his face he could see it was stricken, frozen in shock.
“Oh no, John.  That’s what the silicon was for.  I’ve loaded everything up with fresh batteries and reinforced the seals with caulking.  I’ve tested it all in the bathtub.  It holds under hot and cold conditions”
Sherlock tilts his head, darting his eyes over John.  John waits, allowing Sherlock to process whatever he observes.  Slowly, Sherlock’s hand comes out for the coat and he hangs them both on the rack.  His arm drops and he settles in front of John, waiting.
“He’s frustrated.  He’s playing his most difficult jazz piece before his father’s even home and he’s rushing through it, bashing it out with no finesse, skimming over the mistakes instead of stopping and working on the difficult passages.  And he’s making gratuitous use of the crash cymbal.  It’s not going to improve like that.  He’s just playing to get his frustrations out.”
“John, he’s totally mastering it today.  He’s hitting every cue and gliding through sections he normally trips-up on.  He’s so upbeat and smooth it
Sherlock did a little mental happy dance.  He had never heard anything more welcome.  Under the guise of wrapping himself in the towel he lowered his head and allowed himself a small secret smile.  His little despot was reacting perfectly.  Lesson averted.  He looked up with his most innocent expression.
John sat stupefied for about four heartbeats before scrabbling to his feet and traveling Sherlockward like a homing pigeon.
Now this was not the first time these boys had kissed with lipstick involved but it was the first time they had
“Okay, Sherlock.  Baste me” he grinned.  Sherlock leaned forward and kissed him, touching his fingers just behind John’s balls and rubbing in slow circles.  The groany sound that came out of John was slightly embarrassing.  He was so wound up he was already halfway there.  When Sherlock’s fingers slid back and swirled around his opening he moaned into the kiss and lifted his hips in the sling.  He could feel Sherlock smile against his mouth.
“Yes, of course it is.  Blatantly.  Well if I’m not going to get sucked-off I think I’ll go make some tea.  Want a cup?”  John knew the best way to make Sherlock stew and burn to explain his deductions was to feign disinterest.  He smiled to himself as he put on the kettle, some small consolation for his unforthcoming orgasm.
“Yeah, why wouldn’t he.  It’s all so evident.  Seriously, though, some of these other things are a bit of a guess, surely ”
John reached up and grabbed the ropes above his shoulders that lead to the frame above, causing the cradle to swing slightly in the water.  He felt wanton and floaty.  It was a very seductive feeling.  He cracked open his eyes and saw Sherlock preparing another, slightly larger toy.  Sherlock turned and startled when he saw John’s open eyes.  He paused, waiting for communication.  John pressed his feet into the cradle and lifted his hips toward Sherlock in unspoken agreement.
John gets to shucking his shirt, and sits on the edge of the bed to remove his socks.  He quickly undoes his belt and trouser button before beckoning Sherlock to him.  “Come here, gorgeous.  I want to finish unwrapping you.”
The dreadlocks are more what I imagine you would consider a ‘guess’, John, but I have concluded that it is highly likely given the probable nature of his hair from his mother’s side, its ‘nappy’ tendency to kink readily, the fact that dreadlocks are a rebellious thing to get considering their relatively modern association with Rastafarianism and pot-smoking which would make them almost irresistible to a moody, hormonal, rebellious, teenaged boy who plays the drums.”
beats from two doors down!  As John wormed another slippery finger into the bounty before him, twirling and scissoring, receiving a decadent moan, he recognised the song and came to the conclusion that he might just be able to work
“Sherlock,” he started, “we need to go to the office first today to meet the manager.  I’ve arranged a private lesson for you and she’s going to introduce us to your instructor before we begin, OK?”
If there was anything that encouraged John more than his little tasty cake squirming his arse around on him, it was when he started talking during sex.  Any kind of talking really – his usual intelligent observations made John get hot for Sherlock’s brain, his tentative coy comments make John squishy in the belly, and when he dropped an octave or two and
His experiments with the sex toys had certainly paid off.  And speaking of paid off, he had to remember to go put money on John’s credit card.  He would have used his own but the toy sites were so engrossing and John’s wallet was right there within reach and he’d have them paid before John would know anything ab-
pair of Speedos.  Flopping his head back to the pillow John swept his eyes down the luscious body lying in a state of dishabille beside him.
Unexpectedly John feels an extra hand in his crotch.  His eyes spring open to find Sherlock lazily gazing at him through slitted lids.  Sherlock, seeing the Speedos still very much in evidence, mentally shrugs and decides to go with Plan B.
Moved, John rolls his sweetie over again until he’s on his side facing so that John can spoon him.  He runs a hand up and over Sherlock’s chest, pressing his palm firmly over his heart.  They fuck leisurely in the morning sunlight, tending to each other in ways only two people deeply in love can do.
“Don’t be silly, John.  We’ll just ask him some pointed questions…”  They’d arrived under the window of number 217 and Sherlock bowled his handful of rock chips up at the second floor window of the building.  Net curtains fluttered in the slight breeze and as the window was half open, many of the rocks would have made their way
“Don’t ‘But John’ me! I am tired of waiting out here. I’m cold and, quite frankly, starting to look weird lurking around in a change room in a pair of trunks with nowhere to go so, please. We’ve been through this again and again, and you agreed to come-"
Reggae, however, emphasises the first and third beats of each bar, and is much more rigid and tight in its rhythmic structure.  There is a similarity in the use of syncopation, but it uses more snappy drum beats, staccato fills and has a fluid, soulfulness to it.  The drum beats often double or imitate the horn parts so there has to be more structure – no uninterrupted soloing like you get in jazz.  Reggae also uses a splash cymbal and a cow bell quite frequently, which is that horrible hollow sound you can hear every afternoon that makes me want to go over and offer to milk their cow” he ended with a growl.
Sherlock’s eyes widened.  “I think I may be able to help there, John.  Did I tell you about the media mogul I once helped out of a tricky situation?  One of his newspapers was involved in a phone-tapping scandal.  He had this amazing property and told me I was welcome to use it any time…”
John reached out his arm and curled it around Sherlock’s shoulders.  No reaction.  He shuffled in close and placed his other hand on a still chest.  He could feel Sherlock’s heart racing under his fingers.  “Sherlock?”  John smoothed his palm down and around the chest as he hugged his shoulders.  “Are you OK?  What have you discovered?”
John felt a mixture of emotions rush up and hit his chest.  Bottoming wasn’t something he’d done before and the thought of handing over all control was quite alien to him.  But if he was honest with himself there was also excitement bubbling there, and keeping in mind who this man was to him, and how Sherlock had put his trust in John today he thought perhaps the time had come to open himself to this.
before clambering down the stairs.  “What are you going to say?  Come out, little drummer boy!  We want to see if you’re everything Sherlock says you are?!”
“Wot?  That’s it?  Have nothing to say any more?  I’m outa here.  I’ve got Les Mis to prep for so just bugger off back to 221b to your poncey violin, and take your bloody doctor with ya”
Sherlock carefully adjusted the swing’s height in the water so that John was low enough to suck his cock.  He quickly stripped off his Speedos and got on the inner ledge of the spa and gently tilted John’s head back.
John was busy grinding his very impressive erection into Sherlock's arse, grinding in small circles as he pulled Sherlock as close to him as two men in Regency costume could possibly be.  John's brass buttons were pressing into the back of Sherlock's waistcoat like hard little conkers, and his white gloved fingers were probably leaving imprints on Sherlock's hips.
Sherlock, touched by John’s thoughtfulness, smiled widely and grabbed his hand, lacing their fingers and pushing them into his coat pocket.  John felt the infamous red Speedos lining the pocket of the Belstaff.
Sherlock nods, meekly moving through the door, arse-wiggling abandoned for now.  John follows, closing the door tight, and turns to find Sherlock kicking off his shoes.  He removes his quickly, too, before stepping into Sherlock’s sphere.  “Here, let me…”  John skims open the buttons fastening Sherlock’s cobweb-fine shirt, holding his gaze.  As the last button slides free John ever-so-slowly peels back the left-hand side, and allows himself to glance down.  He draws in a sharp breath at the sight of a snug, glistening little bar piercing.  John smiles to see it’s not just any ordinary bar, but a custom job; a wee striped bee at one end, six tiny off-set honeycomb hexagons at the other.  Pouting between is Sherlock’s rosy nipple, raised and proud, begging for attention.  “How long have you had this?” John croons, touching his little finger to it, mesmerised at the skin’s reaction to his caress.
He removed one hand to suck on a finger and ever so lightly swirl it around Sherlock’s blushing rosebud. Groaning came from both men. “Sshhh!” John warned, although he wasn’t sure which one of them he was telling. With both hands back in place John leant forward into battle, and dragged a tongue from the back of Sherlock’s balls all the way up the crack of his arse. This elicited such a moan John did it again. And again. He returned to the pucker and swirled his tongue into the hole spiralling deeper with each turn about the rim until the tip of his tongue was fully into Sherlock by a good inch. A loud moan carried across the echo-y change room. “
Sherlock fully meant to honour his agreement with John and go to his lesson, it’s just that he hoped to distract John well enough that the lesson would go by without anyone remembering to mention it.  He felt, given his tools, fairly confident he could achieve this, and if not, there was always the back-up plan he’d arranged with one of his homeless network…
“I listen to you John.  And I never delete anything to do with you” Sherlock sung out from the bedroom.
“Sherlock, wait!”  Too late.  Sherlock was only pausing by the door to grab a fistful of little rock chips from around the base of the succulent Mrs Hudson had left on their hall table,
“Is this what you imagined, John, when you heard that song in Sydney?  Did you picture me running my hands over my body, or over yours?”
It is impossible to think with Sherlock all up in his space.  His nearness, his focus, his warmth, his fragrance are intoxicating.   After all this time John is finally facing the very real possibility – it would seem, certainty - of intimacy with Sherlock.  He feels overwhelmed.  In the warmth of the cab Sherlock snuggles close, drifting that pierced lip over John’s neck, sipping at his skin, tasting and no doubt, cataloguing a million different factors, filing them away for future data mining.  A terrible thought occurs to John.  What if this is just-
John takes one last, long suck and smiles as he hears a soft whine.  He gently pushes Sherlock back enough to stand, grip his hips and reverse their positions.  “Lay back on the bed, gorgeous.”  Sherlock reclines languidly, throwing one arm above his head, running the other down his stomach provocatively.  “God, you’re a picture.  Look at you," he marvels.  "You’re fucking enchanting.”  He reaches under Sherlock and peels his jeans down the endless legs, stripping his socks too, until his sweetheart is completely bare.  He eyes the piercings glinting in the ambient light, winking at him in invitation.  “I’m dying to kiss you, but I don’t want to hurt your mouth.”
and for the first time in almost three weeks, the little drummer boy two doors down actually made them SMILE.
“I’ll be very gentle, John.  I’ve been thinking about it for ages.  I’ve brought some toys we can use in the spa to help you relax…”  God, how the tables were turned!  Two hours ago
you do to me will feel exquisite.  Observe!”  He gestures to his straining chest.  “My body begs for your attention,” points to his ruckled nipple, “my skin craves your touch.  How can any touch you bestow upon me feel anything other than superb?” he chides.
“Sherlock, why do you-  no, forget it.  Sit down, please.  We need to talk”  John heard an indrawn breath.  “No.  I don’t want to hear it.  Just leave whatever you’re doing and come and sit down.”  John gestured to the lounge in front of him.
Juan flicked his eyes between John and Sherlock a few times.  “Oooookaaaay.  Bery interethting.  I thall enjoy to be inthructing you together, yeth?”
John made himself a cup of tea and wandered over to the window.  The day looked gloomy out there.  Absently, he watched some birds fighting over something on the rooftop across the street.  Nothing much case-wise lately either, although Sherlock, surprisingly, wasn’t being difficult about it.  Why
It worked.  Sherlock smiled.  “Oh you have no idea.  I’ve been thinking about it all week.”  He paused.  “I know I’m not floating on my own yet but I also know I’ve achieved much more than I would have with anyone else.  Thank you for being so patient, John.”
“Ack! Ah, even though I’ve been very bad, trying to get out of swimming lessons, would you consider bending me over and fucking my arse right now because I think I’m going to have trouble walking if you don’t and I’ll promise to come back next week if you do. Please, John. Please. Will you, John. Please? Ugh.”
dressed to the left until I heard your breathing change as you watched my posterior earlier.  Your panting made my transport decide to re-dress itself northward, John.  It's your fault the line of my pants is less than perfect."
He was plonking away at the keyboard an hour later when he heard strange noises coming from Sherlock’s room.
could get from anyone in that club.  He wants to start as he means to go on.  And he means to keep Sherlock.  He means to keep that gorgeous, wild thing in a constant state of bloom.
“I know, Sherlock.”  John petted and gentled his shivering lover.  He straightened and ran his palm over his detective’s rump- “Oh!  What have we here?!”
Sherlock got excited and wiggled on John’s lap.  “Oh that’s really quite good, John.  I glued fur to a diving glove to see what it would feel like under water and it’s wonderful, John.  You’ll like it”  He looked at john expectantly, with such hope, like a little boy waiting for Christmas.
John swiveled and bobbed in one dashing move, pushing his face into the opening of the breeches.  Before Sherlock could comprehend what was happening he pressed a moist kiss to said Sidecock, and dragged a slick line up it with his tongue.  Fuck he tasted good.
John’s mouth moves without sound.  Sherlock raises The Brow at him until he scuttles up the bed to settle against the headboard.  He gains a lapful of lusciousness, and John automatically bends his knees so that his man might settle back against them.  God.  Sherlock
“Actually Sherlock, scrap that request.  I think I just went off-grid for a second there”  He rubbed his palms up and down Sherlock’s thighs.  “It’s just that I miss you from our bed and I’m probably a tiny bit jealous of the time you’re spending on whatever you’re doing.  I’m actually really looking forward to Tuesday.  You’ve got my curiosity piqued.  As to the swimming, we’re going to take it nice and easy and there’ll be no pressure on you at all.  I’d like it if you could float by the time we leave but if that’s not possible then we’ll just take our time and revisit, and keep at it until you can. OK?”
John, having tasted fresh air in the hall, had every intention of doing just that but he wasn’t about to let Sherlock have all the control.  Without budging he demanded, “Reach up and take down the Speedos, Sherlock.  Expose that glorious arse for me, but only pull them down at the back.”
John let his sticky finger drag up a few inches of Sherlock, whilst simultaneously biting through the fabric to gently but firmly gather some scrotum between his teeth. Another gasp.
He moved on to Juan and blinked.  Juan was ignoring John and smiling widely at Sherlock, teeth parted to expose a bit of tongue, eyes raking up and down Sherlock’s body, eyebrows mobile as two randy caterpillars, cheeks pinking in arousal, shorts straining.  Deduction:  …
“John,” Sherlock whispers, slightly unsurely, “to be honest…well…I’d planned out everything up until this point, where it suddenly gets all kind of vaguely hot and sweaty.  I’ve imagined so many ways things could go that it’s all a bit of a kaleidoscope of limbs and lips, and that confident attitude you like would only get me to
John’s neck extended northward, indignantly.  “And just what is that supposed to mean?  Are you saying you don’t consider my feelings on the matter important enough to ask permission?”
John took a small step back and fingered Sherlock’s crease to discover the sparkling end of a red-jewelled butt plug.  “Oh Sherlock.  You are soooooo wicked.  Have you made yourself ready for me, hmm?”
“Sherlock Holmes, get your beautiful arse out here.  Right now.”   Weird.  Why did that sound like déjà vu?
Sherlock adopted an air of distain.  “Really, John, I do think you need to lighten up a bit.  It’s only a bit of ejaculate.”
“John.  You were doing quite well.  You were relaxed and easy, watching me move, running your eyes over me, thinking about running your hands over me.  Probably remembering a time you wanked over the same fantasy – Australia, I’d say, going by the song that’s playing and your recollection of our case down there – and you were having quite a nice shiver at the memory when that burst of water brought you to your utterly ridiculous senses and you tensed-up and (quite falsely) recalled this is all fake and that I’m not really looking at you with lust and desire, but am appropriating a mirage in order to fool some hitherto unknown criminal lurking out there somewhere in order to work a case.”  He draws in a much needed breath.  “A case which…” and here The Voice lowers even more, “…doesn’t…exissst”.
Knowing how Sherlock hates to repeat himself, John doesn’t bother asking if he’s sure.  “Run that sticky hand over me, gorgeous.”
to master it and to date there was only one virtuoso.  Only one man was permitted to reach every high note, bow such trembling vibrato, coax every grace note from its anima.  For John’s touch, even Sherlock’s open strings would sing as sweetly as any harmonic ever would.
Thursday:  “Oh dear.  Medical problems.  He’s injured his hand, could be from a fight.  Possibly a fall.”
“John!”  Sherlock’s whisper was scandalised.  John’s rant paused.  He looked over to see Sherlock’s pale skin even milkier than usual.  His expression was a cross between just-sucked-on-a-lemon and did-someone-fart?   “You can’t just give anyone your precious-“
Next John re-took the crop in his left hand by the tip, and skimmed it down Sherlock's body.  He carefully lassoed the leather wrist loop around Sherlock's balls and cock, then reached up and tapped the keeper against his lips.  "Open up again, love.  That's it.  Perfect.  Keep that between your teeth until I say.  Now tilt your head back a little, I want some tension on your balls.  That's it, just right."  The riding crop was now vertical along Sherlock's torso, straining between his teeth and testicles.  It was an arresting sight.  "God, if only I could take a photo of this, you sexy piece.  If you want to stop, just tap me on the thigh and we'll stop immediately.  OK, beautiful?"  Sherlock grunted.
Pushing off the doorway John drifted across the room to place his hands over Sherlock’s.  “How beautiful you are, Sherlock” he murmured.  “You’re always the dreamiest man in the room, my naughty little crumpet, but tonight you are just…
So with a few nervous giggles, they worked together to get Sherlock into the swing.  John spoke soothingly to him when Sherlock tensed up and went to baulk or thrash in fear.
Sherlock paced the living room, agitated and rattled.  “I’ve tried going in to The Yard to complain about it to Gary but he doesn’t want to know about it.  After all the help I give him.  Ingrate.”
“I’m not going anywhere, I promise.”  John stroked his fingers gently in the water around Sherlock’s body, being careful not to make splashes.  He tried to distract his student.  “This swing of yours is brilliant.  I can only imagine what you have planned with it for later…”
John looked uncomfortable.  “No.  I’m sorry.  I should have thought it through a bit better before we started but I’ve fixed it and everything should go better now.  You’ll be floating and paddling in no time” John smiled hopefully.
“Oh god oh god oh god oh god I bloody LOVE you, Sherlock!” he roars to the heavens and he’s never felt so tethered and so free at the same time.
“Oh that’s good John, because I needed to talk to you about that, too.  I’ve gained permission to use that pool and-“
He slid a hand up John’s thigh, thumb zeroing in on one of his favourite spots when he suddenly lost his rhythm –
“ENOUGH!” Sherlock’s face had purpled.  John’s eyes widened in surprise.  He was concerned he may have gone a bit far, as he’d never seen Sherlock work himself up, well, at all, really.  Except in excitement.  But in anger?  No.
“John, please!” he admonished, “we’re in a change room” the little hypocrite had the audacity to murmur.  The fact hadn’t bothered Sherlock one iota a fortnight ago.
John leaves a goodly amount of spit on Sherlock’s hole and presses in a finger. “So we’re clear on this?” John asks in a low voice, eyes never leaving their mission . “If I fuck you now, next Tuesday you’re going to voluntarily leave the flat, without whining, with bathers I deem appropriate, and travel across town to attend a swimming lesson so that I don’t have to worry about you drowning next time you decide to jump in The Thames, hmmm?” John removed his finger and whilst watching the target carefully, pressed in two.
John cleared his throat and had a quick look around.  The salon was still deserted but for the two of them.  He peeked again at the trews and groaned.
Sherlock slumps against his chest and John immediately brings his legs in a little more to stop from slipping out of him. He doesn’t want to lose the connection yet.  “Mmmm, John.  Indescribable," he garbles into John's neck. "It’ll take aaages t’ sort ‘n’ catalogue all that."
John lined himself up and pushed home.  Two sets of tears nearly fell from the relief.  It was impossible to say who needed the friction more.
He cocks one eyebrow at his cutie, “Oh Johnnnn…”  he teases as he tugs the Speedos languidly from John’s grasp.  “What fun we had with these. Are you looking forward to seeing me in them again today?”  Outrageously, Sherlock drapes them over his face and inhales deeply.  “Mmmm.  I can smell us both, John.  I think I might need some encouragement for my lesson, John.  A bit of incentive to attend, hmm?”
