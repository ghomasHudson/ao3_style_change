“Clearly I am insane,” Dean mused to himself, closing his text book and stripping, “or there’s a ghost in my room.”
“I had ulterior motives in inviting you and your brother here for Christmas,” Cas admitted to Dean, his face bright red, and Dean being a shit decided to play with him.
“My brothers want to shove a stick up my arse to punish me for being gay…” Cas admitted, now almost crying. Dean didn’t know what he was doing by the time he had Cas pressed up against the wall of the bunker, his prick rubbing against Cas’ leg as he pinned the bawling boy against the wall. “If you’re going to punch me do it quickly, don’t say anything, at least in respect for the friendship we held once.” Cas began to blubber, only for Dean to shut him up with a kiss. Cas responded quickly, letting his hand trail down to Dean’s surprisingly still hard meat. Dean moaned into the kiss as he removed Cas’ shirt and began to work on his pants. Dean began to drag them over to the table so he could fuck the seemingly enthusiastic boy when he stopped and looked at Cas.
Castiel did not understand Dean’s ‘video games’ he had watched Dean play them countless times, but he could not work out how they worked. He had freaked Dean out a few weeks ago by turning the newest console off just as he came into the room. That had been amusing to watch. Dean and Benny both freaking out. Two buff jocks. Acting like they saw a ghost…
Dean grinned to himself after the beautiful man left. No not beautiful. The man had been sexy and cute at the same time. And with his features carved into his brain, Dean closed the shop, thanking the lord for the fact he lived upstairs. When he was upstairs he got out his favourite sketch book and attempted to draw the man from memory, colouring his face in as well. But when he got up to the body he got stumped. “What was he wearing again?” dean asked himself, realizing he hadn’t been able to stop staring at the stranger’s face to look at his body. “Shit.” He cussed, pushing himself from his desk and grabbing the half completed female doll that he had intended to make brunette. But now it was going to be a red head. He worked all night, turning it into a beautiful red head with green eyes. He also put her in a beautiful dark red Lolita dress and some of those classic Lolita shoes with the bow in dark brown. Shaking his head, Dean removed the brown shoes and replaced them with black ones. It took him three days to make her perfect. But by the time he was done he had also started the Angel for his ‘tree’ to look like the man who had commissioned the red headed doll.
“Hi Chesh,” I smiled at the dark grey tabby kitten. She was only a few months old, but right now seemed to be the same size as me.
“Castiel! He’s my angel friend!” Dean told the old man, he had worked out how to say Castiel’s full name a while ago, but still hadn’t realised that Castiel was a ghost.
“I wish I could fix things my pet,” Cas told Dean, bending over and kissing his lover’s lips, “however my brother has requested my presence, so I must leave you alone with your hand until I return tonight.” Cas smirked, nipping Dean’s lips.
Dean’s next girlfriend was either psycho or a genius. The first time Castiel saw her she sensed him immediately. And she told Dean that. Castiel hadn’t heard her name but she had dragged Dean out to buy lavender and sage, which she said would rid the house of any ghosts.
“Jesus Cas! I knew you were innocent but I didn’t think you were this innocent,” Dean giggled, sobering up when he heard Cas huff angrily. “Sorry Cas.”
“Slicer to cut the sandwich once it’s done, a tomato knife to cut the tomato, a bread knife to cut off some fresh bread, a serrated knife… would a serrated knife do the tomato… I suppose… oh well, and lastly a butter knife.” He was murmuring to himself, not paying attention to my question. He was also worrying me with his obsession with knives…
Almost a year after Sam and Jessica got married they came home with a gorgeous little boy. Named in honour of his uncle who was taken much too soon in their eyes. But Dean wouldn’t have had it any other way. And he said so as he and Castiel moved on into the next life, together.
“Okay, I’m going now,” Dean made his way towards the door where Castiel stood, still in his towel. “Cas! When did you wake up?” he asked, finally realising who he had been talking to the entire time. He stared at his friend’s chest for a moment, swallowing thickly as he tried to hid the underwear behind his back.
“Then why are you blushing?” Dean enquired, raising an eyebrow… I considered telling him I’m gay… but in reality I’m not sure, I’ve only ever liked one person, Dean. Sure I’ve found other people attractive, I’d have to be a robot to not. But I don’t think it would go down well if I told him I was more attracted to him.
“Oh dear lord I’m going to be kissing Dean Winchester,” I realized, getting a worried look from Charlie as I visibly paled, my heart clenching again.
“I have several blondes, they’re the most popular, take your pick…”  Dean beamed. Ducking behind the counter and pulling out a box which contained the doll for Anna. Browsing the dolls, Castiel found the perfect blonde doll with blue eyes. He carefully picked the doll up and cradled her like a baby.
I sit with Dean on a rare moment of freedom. Crowley is preoccupied with his mother’s arrival in the states.
“So she wants me to fuck a kid like you?” the man who was currently straddling him, “very well.” Was all he said before he began to attack Dean’s torso with his mouth, his teeth scraping and drawing blood. Causing Dean to mewl in pain. The man took off Deans ‘clothing’ with a rough movement that tore the material. Dean felt his voice hitch as he begged the man to stop.
“Sam go pack a saddle bag! Only essentials or things you can’t live without! And get Adam to too!” Dean practically yelled making the younger, but taller, Winchester hold his hands up and leave the room.
“Okay what about friends?” Sam asked, raising his eyebrow, “oh wait! I forgot you push everyone away because you’re a total Grinch.”
“Well it’s Christmas sir,” a brave waitress spoke up, her slender hands clasped together as she grinned like a lunatic.
“I'm usually free,” Castiel blushed, giving Dean the dolls with the instruction to hold them whilst he opened the car doors.
“Have breakfast first! You don’t want to pass out and drop our dolls!” Claire sighed, walking into the kitchen and opening up the fridge.
“Roughest love I’ve ever heard,” Michael laughed, making me blush and Gabriel laugh. “Fine, Castiel you and Gabriel will escort your lover back to his kingdom, but if he turns on you, kill him. But you better leave as soon as possible.” Castiel and Gabriel watched as their brother strode out of the room, obviously unpleased with the plan the twin brothers had concocted. Castiel said his farewell to his brother before bolting to his room and pouncing on a lounging Dean.
“Give it back Gabriel,” Dean sighed, snatching the ring out of Gabriel’s hand and carefully placing it back in the box which he placed back in the larger box.
“Nope!” Cas called as he ducked out of his bedroom, locked the door to prevent the unlikely escape of his toy and headed towards the hall in which his brother had turned into a battle planning hall. The people who wandered around the halls bowed to the young prince as he made his way down. When he entered he found his brothers fighting already so he kept his mouth shut and listened.
“Ward of the state I’m afraid,” Gabriel explained, giving up on his endeavour to acquire some of the steaming goo, “keeps running away from her foster homes.”
“Don’t know…” Dean told him truthfully, watching the man sit up and pull him closer, rubbing his hand down Dean’s side making the blonde shiver.
“Sure that’s why it was a pain in the arse, not because Cassy put a butt plug up your but before we left,” Gabriel mocked, making the blonde blush and look at him with shame in his eyes.
It should be noted, despite the late hour, Castiel Novak was in fact not asleep but in the bathroom, neck deep in a hot bath. So, when Dean made his way upstairs to find Castiel’s bedroom dark, he was sensible enough to assume Castiel was deep asleep and not turn the light on. However, this made it rather had to distinguish what was what, and he fumbled around for a few minutes in the dark before finding Castiel’s drawers. Castiel however, at the time Dean would manage to find which drawer contained his desired prize, would return to his room; with only a towel wrapped around his waist. To find a rather splotchy faced Dean stretching a pair of batman briefs and staring at them as though they were fine diamonds.
He would give anything; beg, borrow, or steal; ransack heaven and hell and any realm in between to find some way to let this past-Dean know that he would be back.
He dropped his head back down on Cas' shoulder, snuggled back into his side and said, "Mornin' Cas."
Billie sent Jack there before, we just gotta figure out how. Maybe we can make some kinda deal with the new Death.
Cas wasn’t helpless. A little bit naive in places, even though he was older than Dean could really wrap his mind around and also happened to be a bad-ass warrior of heaven who could—and did, once upon a time—kick the living crap out of Dean without so much as breaking a sweat.
He tried to pat the burgers into shape like Dean had shown him, but he always seemed to use either too much force—which caused the raw meat to ooze out between his fingers—or too little—which left the meat in a shapeless lump totally unsuitable for frying.
They were currently perched on a slope behind their motel high in the mountains, looking out over the misty trees that fell away before them, in the gray light of predawn.
And Castiel knew, if another apocalypse came knocking right that second and he had to choose between saving the world and staying locked forever in Dean’s arms, he would let the world burn.
Dean sleepily ran his fingers through Cas’ hair and tried to keep his eyes open, not wanting to miss a single second of their time together.
Dean stood transfixed, staring dumbly at the ecstatic pride on Cas’ face and was therefore completely  unprepared when the angel pushed something soft and squishy into Dean’s chest.
Castiel stood in his new room in the bunker clad in an old T-shirt and jeans that Dean had lent him… and one sock.
He stood in the kitchen of the Men of Letters bunker, his trusty trench coat set aside, the sleeves of his button-down shirt rolled up, and his shoulders drawn up in tension as he squinted down at his hands in concentration.
He had looked at Dean in surprise and had seen that the hunter was still sound asleep. Dean had looked so peaceful, and Cas had thought he was sleeping better than he usually did, so Cas had decided not to wake him up.
Dean wasn't sure what he found more surprising when he woke the next morning, the fact that Cas had stayed with him all night, or the fact that Dean, at some point during the night, had turned onto his side and snuggled up to the angel, throwing an arm over his middle and resting his head on Cas’ shoulder.
Well, maybe Sam can make the deal, I kinda killed the first Death and Billie, so maybe they won't wanna talk to me, but we'll figure something out.
Dean seemed to take Castiel’s silence as an affirmative answer and reached out to grab some of the offending beef.
Which really should have been Dean’s first clue that fate was waiting just around the corner to smack him upside the head with a two-by-four.
Cas was pleased that Dean didn't seem to be upset at where he found himself and instead had returned comfortably to his side.
Cas couldn't stand out here all night, however. There were many more people in the bunker now and one of them was bound to wander down this hall eventually and see him lurking outside Dean's door.
Cas smiled over at him and gestured expansively in a way that seemed to indicate everything from here to the horizon as he said, “I wanted you to see this.”
Sam had thrown his hands up into the air in exasperation and turned back to packing his own bag, muttering something under his breath which sounded suspiciously like “Mother hen” that Dean had chosen to ignore.
All of the angel’s attention was immediately laser-focused on the sweet treat in front of him as he practically devoured it. Dean was already making a mental note to start shopping for a deep-fryer for the bunker’s kitchen.
He also wasn't sure exactly when Dean had become okay with it. When he had stopped jolting awake, reaching for his gun, before realizing it was Cas and telling him to stop staring at him while he slept because it was creepy.
“How about tonight? I’ll treat you to dinner…” Dean suggested, handing Castiel the dolls and letting him put them in the brown car. When the dark haired man stood up he tripped slightly, but didn’t fall into Dean’s arms, “See you’re already falling for me.”
On the fifth of May of the next year John and Mary came home with a new bundle of joy. According to is name was Sam. Dean had already gone into protective big brother mode and didn’t trust anybody around Sam. Well anybody other than his parents and Castiel. Castiel found it adorable when Mary had Dean hold the little baby when they were showing him off to extended family. John’s brother Bobby said that he looked like a naked mole rat, which made Castiel confused, how did a baby human look like a rat of any kind?
“J-just think about my offer Dean,” Sam begged quietly, we will set a place for you. And with that the younger left the room, leaving Dean alone as he heard his brother bid his staff a Merry Christmas.
Dean had closed his eyes for barely a minute when he heard the dorm door open, “Balthazar get lost, Dean’s asleep… no… I’ll ask him tomorrow… okay…” Cas’ voice murmured before the door closed. There was a few shuffling sounds before Cas presumably went into the adjoined bathroom. Sitting up Dean rubbed his eyes and glared at the door. After a moment Cas came out of the bathroom, half naked and extremely dishevelled.
“They kept telling me I was sick, they were going to throw me into an insane asylum,” Castiel hissed.
“I…” Dean unfortunately would not be able to finish that sentence that night as he fell into Castiel, passing out from all the alcohol in his system. Castiel had been cheated out of an answer that by this point everyone should have figured out by now. Which, was that Dean Winchester, of Lawrence, Kansas, was completely, madly, head-over-heals, and every other cliché in the book, in love with Castiel. And the only two who had not figured this out, was the two, rather dense, men themselves.
“No Santa Claus,” Crowley remarked, licking his lips and grinning, “for tonight, as a figure of your past I will be playing the part of Christmas past, lucky me!”
“Come in in a few days’ time, I believe there’s one that’s nearly finished…” the man smiled at Castiel. His eyes looking over Castiel, as though committing his features to memory.
“With your shoes by the door.” Dean huffed a sigh of relief and sat back on the bed, clutching his thumping head in his shaking hands.
“Sorry Cas, seems like your name sake is missing, and mum won’t be home with cat food for a while… how long do you think you’ll last without killing me?” Dean laughed, picking me up and going over to the couch where he laid down with me on his stomach. He switched on the TV and went to the recordings, flicking on some show called Dr. Sexy…
“Meet us by the Christmas Tree when you get off!” Charlie grinned, dragging me off as I stared at a grinning Dean.
“You never approved of your brother’s choice in partner, always preferring… what was her name, Jess?”
“I can, would you like me to play you a song?” Dean asked her, walking over to the keys. Castiel managed to move just before Dean could sit down. Dean began playing the song Castiel taught him, the one that Castiel had been playing when Dean had come home; the only song Castiel ever composed himself. Dean had shown great promise as a little kid and proved to be a fast learner.
“N-no please Benny! What’s gotten into you?” Dean begged as the older man pulled the boy up so his dick was in front of his painfully erected prick.
“Well dah! I mean I am right next to you!” Gabriel laughed, “also totally missing out on hot sex with your brother to do so!” he added making Dean gag. Dean blocked out the laughs of Gabriel to look to where the newcomer had come in and was taking off a familiar tan coat, his equally familiar dark brown hair sticking up as though he had only just rolled out of bed.
“Feed me!” I complained, jumping off his chest and sniffing the obviously fake fruit to make my point.
“No, you no longer own this place,” the ghost explained, making Dean’s eyes go wide, “you now work for the owner, earning less than half of what you used to.”
“Sorry, we might have to leave without them soon,” Castiel instructed the three brothers, looking at the youngest who was holding Sam’s hand and rubbing his eyes sleepily.
“I have two brothers…” Dean pointed out, looking at Castiel who merely shrugged and told him to grab them both.
“No thanks,” I blushed, tears already threatening to spill. Sam being a really intelligent young man noticed and smirked.
With one last glance at the little girl Dean jogged after Gabriel, tumbling after him through the door and into a warm, gingerbready smelling house – a smell that instantly reminded him of his mother earlier that night. “Where are we?” Dean asked, looking around the vaguely familiar room.
“Fuck it,” he gave up, pouncing on me, knocking me into a lying position, licking and biting down my body, making me moan his name.
“Merry Christmas Dean…” Castiel smiled, cupping Dean’s face with his hand before suddenly remembering something. “Do you want to spend New Year’s with me and my family, I know we haven’t been seeing each other long bu-” Dean cut him off with a quick kiss.
“Dean…” Castiel felt his breath hitch… was it creepy? A little. Was it sweet? Incredibly. Did he love it? Absolutely.
And yet now, to his despair it was void of life, having been turned into a clothing store. Not a person was in sight as snow lightly sprinkled down around them. “W-where is everyone? Where’s Benny? Surely he wouldn’t let this happen!” Dean muttered, looking around for any sign of life. And yet he soon found himself facing the final ghost, a troubled expression on his face. “What happened?” he finally asked, leaving it at that simple question.
Dean was scared to say the least. He was a prisoner of war! His father, the ‘honourable’ lord Winchester gave him up to save his own hide. He gave up his sixteen year old son. Who was soon to become the sex slave of some bloke named ‘Castiel’? So yeah he had every right to be scared. His baby brother needed him! But no. instead he was stuck in a metal box, that only had holes in so he could breath and nothing else. He couldn’t see where he was going. He didn’t care. All he wanted to do was run home. But it was too late for that; he must have been hours away from home. And judging by the heat he was somewhere in the East, which meant the metal box would soon become a small personal hell.
Castiel woke up to Dean fighting with his parents about something. Castiel looked outside to see Dean getting into his car and speeding off.
“Oh…” Benny said, standing up properly, “never thought you’d consent to a man fucking you.” Benny smirked, tilting the shorter’s head up to look at him.
“Dean?” I tried, looking at him and begging him to pick me up. Only looking away when I heard Sam come into the room, holding a small dish with tuna on. Licking my lips I dug into it, not noticing when Dean left the room and Gabe came in, throwing himself onto the couch, with his head in Sam’s lap.
“Working so hard on Christmas Eve dear brother?” Sam grinned cheekily, making Dean scoff, “don’t you know it’s a time for being with your family and friends?”
Dean lost track of time as he sat and stared at the ring, remembering every amazing moment with Cas. “I thought you had come out of the closet years ago Dean,” a familiar voice mused, making Dean snap his head up to look at the door. In the doorway, stood a very familiar face. Sucking on a lollipop was Dean’s brother in law Gabriel, his lips quirked into an amused grin. His head was full of golden brown hair, and his eyes were nearly the same colour. He was a much shorter than Dean too, looking more like a Christmas elf than anything else. And the absurd, bright red Christmas sweater did not help his case.
“Of course,” Crowley agreed, Dean squeezed his eyes shut, listening to the snap of Crowley’s fingers. Dean only opened his eyes when he felt the air shift into a warmer tone, the scent of gingerbread cookies infused into the otherwise homely feel. To his delight Dean found himself in another familiar setting, but this one was a happy one, it was the lounge room of Gabriel’s father’s house. Dean smiled to himself, not caring when Crowley cocked his head in curiosity, but before he could ask Dean why he was smiling two people burst into the room, laughing and carrying on like fools in love.
Dean pushed himself away from the gravestone, scrambling away from it as quickly as possible. He didn’t stop until his back hit another headstone. Five years, five years until Cas couldn’t deal with it anymore. Did he really love him that much? “No. No. No. No. No.” Dean whimpered, covering his mouth with his hand to stop any whimpers that try to escape his mouth, “is this really my fault?”
“Punishing my slave,” Castiel shrugged, before leaving his room, Dean protesting all the way down to the horse they were going to be riding.
“T-they’re meeting us somewhere else…” Benny said much too quickly, before walking to the blonde and crouching slightly so they were at eye height. “Tell me honestly, what did those cunts do to you?” Benny asked, studying Dean’s face.
“Wasn’t Castiel the name of one of the old occupants of this house?” Ellen asked Mary who nodded and mouthed something to Ellen.
“Oh Dean, I'm sorry did I awaken you?” Cas said, his very formal way of speaking making Dean’s erection perk even more. Blushing Dean answered his best friend.
“Yes my cherry pie?” Castiel asked, looking at the man who was so beautiful it should have been illegal.
“Do I really look like that?” the ghost version of Gabriel mused, making Dean roll his eyes, “ no wonder your brother married me!” Before Dean could respond he was cut off by the doorbell ringing. Sam walked towards the door and opened it with a large grin, ushering whoever it was out of the cold. By their figures Dean guessed that it was a pair of females, but before Dean could ask who it was, they both dropped their hoods revealing more familiar faces. Charlie and Dorothy, two of Sam and Dean’s shared friends. Dean watched quietly as they interacted with Sam and Gabriel, their smiles bright as they brought over a pair of bags filled to the brim with neatly wrapped presents.
“Don’t you get lonely?” Dean asked, making Castiel smile sadly. But part of him was astounded at how well the three year old spoke, although he wasn’t surprised, Mary was a very intelligent woman.
“Where the fuck is the camera man?” someone yells, I look forward to see that there’s nobody manning the camera. Behind it, on a chair sits a gorgeous young man who is scribbling in a notebook. Another model?
“W-well Bela Talbot had a reddish-purple mark on her neck and Balthazar wouldn’t give me an answer…” Cas quietly admitted. Reddish-purple mark? Bela Talbot? Oh… Dean couldn’t hold in his laughter.
“Cas?” Dean asked groggily when he woke up and saw the mess of hair that he was so used to grabbing…
“Open it and find out,” Dean grinned, watching as Cas carefully plucked it out of his hand and opened it up, his eyes closing and a frustrated huff left his lips. He opened his eyes once more and pulled out the ring to inspect it, his eyes watering when he read the inscription.
“Wait… you dumped Benny for Cas?” Sam asked, coming over and getting disheartened when he saw… me as a cat.
“What? How?” Dean cried, looking in the window to see himself dressed like a waiter, serving a family with a couple of kids, “I’m a waiter?”
“Don’t swear in front of your mother boy,” John growled, appearing next to Dean and lifting him up as though Dean was made of feathers.
“I think he wants to help you find the human Cas,” Sam laughed, showing Gabe something on his phone which made him laugh too.
“H-hi Dean,” I stumbled, becoming increasingly aware of my nudity. Especially when he pushed himself off me, blushing when he saw mini me, which I turned my legs into each other to hide, sitting up in the process.
“Depends on if when you become king if you chose to marry me,” Castiel replied, backing Dean into a corner and kissing down his neck. Tugging at the harem pants he wore to take them off.
“You were going to propose,” Cas bit sadly, although Dean could tell he wasn’t upset with Dean this time, but with himself.
“Yeah, but I don’t really want to talk about him,” Dean whispered, “I’d much rather find out how you’re so beautiful.”
“Not my area unfortunately,” Gabriel apologised, “but if she doesn’t find a good home soon she will likely end up living on the streets, doing anything to survive.”
“I guess it is true, our son has become a monster,” John sighed, making Dean growl deep in his throat.
“Are you going to follow them?”  Crowley asked, appearing next to the door to the kitchen and peeking in.
“They’re idiots, but if they’re anything like us they’ll realize their feelings are mutual eventually, probably sooner considering Sammy is a nerd,” he promised, kissing me.
“I won’t mind,” Castiel told the boy who grinned and told his mother how Castiel replied before they both went into the kitchen for lunch.
“Dean the kitten is climbing to find you!” Sam called out, taking photos of my struggle. I got up three steps before Dean appeared at the top before running down and picking me up.
“Well he wasn’t home when I went in to tell him I was off for school… I didn’t even think about him being missing…” Gabe explained, taking m from Sam’s hands to cradle me.
“NO!” Dean spoke attempting to defend himself, not noticing Castiel drop his hand and pick him up bridal style before walking to his room and throwing the boy on his bed.
“Yep! You smell like Castiel, but the humans say he’s missing, master Sam told me that made master Dean sad,” Riot said, her voice bouncy, like the happy dog she was.
“You do know me Dean,” Castiel promised, “my name is Castiel.” Dean’s expression changed pretty quickly from confusion to fear back to confusion.
“Memento,” was all Dean offered, pulling out another pair and giving them the same treatment before deciding that they were the pair he was going to take. Castiel held his hand over his mouth and stifled a giggle, Dean’s face looked so innocent.
“P-please,” Dean stuttered, not able to finish his sentence, causing Castiel to flip him over, at which point he began to struggle to break free of the obvious lunatic’s vice like grip. He squeezed his eyes shut as a finger invaded his arse, bending and wriggling before it was pulled out and joined by a second finger, which joined in on the wriggling action before he pulled them out and pushed them back in, scissoring them around and brushing against whatever flesh they could find on the inside until Dean squeaked. Castiel rubbed against that spot a second time, causing Dean to make more lewd sounds. Castiel leaned closer to Dean, his mouth nibbling on the latter’s ear before he breathily asked, “My little pet, do you want my cock to hit that spot?” Castiel pulled back to find Dean bright red, before the boy began to rock his hips against Castiel’s fingers. Castiel took that as a yes and pulled them out and picked up his discarded oil from earlier. He didn’t even use it earlier.
This of course was good for Dean who found himself admitting more and more lately that he found Cas cute. And that was a bad thing because it meant the other eighteen year old was a distraction. Even thinking about him made Dean get distracted, the caramel haired male realised, pushing himself away from his desk and stripping out of his shirt and jeans, leaving on only a pair of boxer-briefs. “If I can’t study with him here. And I can’t fucking study when I’m alone!” Dean complained out loud, walking over to his bed and lying down. “Then I’m going the fuck to sleep!”
He was probably fine. There was no reason to panic. (Especially not at a disco. Seriously, what kind of a band name is that, Sam?)
He reached over, pulled the covers down on what he had already subconsciously started to think of as
Cas trudged down the hallway, feet dragging. Between the hunters coming back wounded and Jack getting injured while training, Cas had been healing a lot of injuries over the past few days.
The concert had been a bit much for Cas, who was still not used to loud sounds that weren't related to battle. When Sam had decided that Jack's concert experience wouldn't be complete without joining the mosh pit, Dean had taken pity on the overwhelmed angel and pulled the ripcord, telling Sam that he and Cas would meet them by the main entrance after the concert was over.
Dean didn’t seem to be angry with him, or disgusted at his feelings, which had been a worry for Castiel.
Dean's breath came in pants as he shuddered and shook. Slowly, Dean's breathing evened out, returning to a more regular rhythm.
Dean stood across from him and cradled Castiel’s hands in his own as he began to guide them through the process of forming the hamburger patty and Castiel tried to set aside his shock.
Castiel glanced down in confusion to find that his hands were coated in raw beef, having subconsciously crushed the hamburger while he was focused on… other things.
Cas paused for a second before realizing he was too worn out to worry about whether Dean was awake enough to realize what he was saying.
Now Dean would wake up thrashing on his bed, gasping for air and Cas would be there, talking him down, reminding Dean that he was free. That he was away from Michael and that the dreams weren't real.
Dean took a careful sip of his coffee and let the blessed liquid slide down his throat and curl warmth through his body from the inside.
His search for the missing sock temporarily abandoned, Castiel opened his phone to find that he had dozens of unread messages.
And Cas had been so eager to get it for him, braving the noise and the crowds and using his skills to win at a rigged game just so that he could give the bear to Dean.
Then, breaking through the wordless static that his brain had become, came one thought, one possible course of action, shining like a beacon in a snowstorm.
“NO!” Dean blurted out, accidentally shouting it way too loudly for the small room, as he raised a hand to stop Cas, who had started to stand up.
In the end, it was the easiest thing in the world for the two of them to slip under the covers, to tangle their arms and legs together until Cas wound up with his head pillowed on Dean’s chest.
“We meet him early morning, about three am, why? Want one last fuck before then?” Gabriel asked, receiving a glare from his brother, which only managed to make him laugh. “I’ll take that as a yes, how about when little Dean-o wakes up I’ll go ‘scope the area’ to give you some alone time, okay?”
“Always,” Castiel whispered, his voice breaking as he brought the phone even closer to his face, his entire body tensed, leaning toward the screen.
Dean realized that he’d probably been standing there staring at the angel for longer than was generally considered appropriate and cursed himself for being such a love-sick idiot. Again.
At this, Castiel felt a pang of a different kind. He had been gone for many months before he and Jack had finally made it back. Dean sounded as though he had been so sure that Castiel would be back soon. It must have been difficult for him to realize that that wasn’t the case.
No, instead of watching where they going or observing the people around them as he had been doing with such fascination since they had arrived here, Cas was staring down at where his hand was nestled safely in Dean’s with the softest smile Dean had ever seen on his face.
He spoke quietly into his lap when he said, “I used to see the sunrise all the time, when I was an angel, but I never had anyone to share it with before…”
Castiel looked from his own messy hands to the pan smoking and sizzling quietly in the sink and couldn’t help joining in with Dean’s infectious laughter.
He refused to think about how much easier it would be to fall asleep if his angel were here with him, and when exactly had he started thinking of Cas as
Later, when when Sam and Jack were buzzing with excitement in the back seat, ecstatically reliving their favorite moments from the concert, Dean drove home with his hand firmly held by one blissfully happy former Angel of the Lord.
Dean stood looking down at Castiel from the doorway, his slight smile not enough to distract from the lines of tension creasing his face. He looked nervous.
Dean’s mind blanked out. He was suddenly completely unable to process anything that wasn’t Cas’ face.
When Dean had woken from those nightmares, Cas had been there and that had been enough to reassure the hunter and lull him back to sleep.
And Dean wouldn't let his worst enemy anywhere near the swamps of Florida during mosquito season without bug spray, let alone someone he...
There were a thousand things that could hurt the angel now and he didn't know how to avoid the majority of them.
The angel, who was normally even more of a grump in the mornings than Dean was now that he actually slept on a regular basis, had woken Dean up half an hour ago and dragged him out here because… Dean couldn’t remember why. Something about the scenery.
Dean held his stuffed bear in his lap (he wasn’t going to set it on the table, you never know what kind of nasty things could be on there) and watched as Cas took his first tentative bite of the deep-fried sugar-coated dough and couldn’t help but smile at the way Cas’ face lit up like a kid at Christmas.
“Yes Claire?” Benny asked, stopping his stirring of whatever he was stirring. He leant over the counter to get a better look at the little girl. She was clearly too young to have been alone and yet she clearly was.
“Happy Birthday Dean.” He whispered to the human, smiling when Dean sat on the bed and looked at him.
“Castiel only raped him once, he had been drugged, every other time they had sex it was consensual.” Castiel had butted in, slapping his mouth over his mouth and looking away from the queen.
“I-I’ll go get the first aid kit then…” Dean informed me, rushing to the other side of the kitchen and reaching for the top shelf but wincing as though he had hurt himself.
“Cas, the human one, had a new kitten in his room after Mick told him he’s not allowed another cat…” Gabe explained, reaching over and scratching me behind the ear.
“Bullshit,” Cas laughed, trying to look over the impossible line of girls ranging from thirteen to twenty, “Dean would never whore himself out.”
“I-I'm fine!” he said quickly, trying to push me away from him. I merely blinked confusedly and reached over him to check his temperature to make sure the flush on his face wasn’t due to a fever.
Just as he was tidying up for the night his employees began to make a hubbub, singing loudly and off key to songs Dean recognised to be Christmas carols. So naturally Dean pushed himself away from his desk with an angered huff, leaving his office with a scowl. “What is all this ruckus?” he shouted over the loud pandemonium. He watched longer as the employees stopped in their tracks, no patrons left in the restaurant to ogle the outburst. In the kitchen door stood Benny, the head chef and one of Dean’s long standing friends. He looked almost disappointed.
Dean didn’t remember falling asleep but after an hour he was startled awake by a cold chill. He groggily opened his eyes, rubbing the sleep out of them he looked around the room until his eyes landed on a well-dressed, older man with dark hair and eyes. His body was thin and skeletal with hollow. Between his bony hands he held a black walking stick. He almost had an air of finality, a solemn air. It was the air of death. “Are you the third ghost?” Dean asked meekly. The man nodded quietly, flexing his fingers around the top of his walking stick.
“Come on Dean, there’s one last place I want to take you,” the spirit sighed. Dean nodded quietly, closing his eyes when everything began spinning and opening them when he heard crows screeching in the distance.
“Dean there’s a kitten on your shoulder!” Dean’s cousin Jo squeaked, pulling me off his shoulder and scratching behind my ear. I admit I involuntarily purred at the touch.
“Meg, you might be my niece, but if you don’t get the fuck out right now I will kill you.” The man growled, throwing something at the woman who ducked out of the way and left the room, shutting the door behind her, cackling to herself as she went. The man turned on the lights, allowing Dean to see his assailant properly for the first time. Dean didn’t understand why at the time but his heart skipped a beat as the man looked at him, his blue eyes teary as he looked at Dean, his thin pink lips muttering the word ‘fuck’ repeatedly. The man was no older than twenty, being younger then the woman he called his niece, but he must have had seen bad times, because his eyes seemed older than he was. The man, Dean would later decide was beautiful, with his tussled hair and abs that seemed out of place on such a kind, beautiful looking man.
Dean woke me up the next morning when he got out of bed. He probably had work to get to. Meowing at him I signified the fact that I was awake and hungry. He took me with him as he ran downstairs, filling up the little bowl Mary got me and pulling out his slice of pie, which he happily devoured. He kissed his mother when she came into the kitchen before breezing out and off to work. Mary watched me eat as she herself ate some cereal, kissing Sam as he bustled in, late for school and being called for by Gabe who I assumed must have stayed the night. And John as he came in for a kiss before heading off to work as well. Mary then went and did her daily chores, not realizing that I escaped out the window to go lay in a warm patch of sun on top of Riot’s kennel. Riot was Sam’s well trained dog. I doubted he would attack me. And if he did I’d just jump onto the fence and get back in through the front. Riot watched me whilst I watched the giant ball of fluff. “If cats can understand me can you?” I asked, tilting my head at the dog.
“Sorry Lil Cas, Sammy said aunty Ellen was brought pie,” Dean laughed, picking me up and placing me on his shoulder where I stayed until we walked through the door and got bombarded with questions.
“W-where’s C-“ Dean began to ask, stopping when Castiel came into view and dragged him into his room, Sam and Gabe following behind. Shutting the door, Gabriel looked at Castiel who looked at Dean who in turn was looking at Sam who was looking at all three.
“H-how? Y-you’re dead!” Dean cried, backing into the wall, the kind, warm smile on his mother’s face never ceased, whereas his father watched him with an expressionless face.
“Thank you,” he replied before continuing, “after he quit working for you, you told everyone in the same business appalling lies about him meaning he never got hired again.”
“Probably passed out in the alleyway,” a woman grumbles next to the set, her arms crossed. Abaddon, the manager here, “Dean, take the photos.”
“How about you start by opening up shop,” Benny grinned, “and don’t worry, I’ll let you go in time to go fix things with your pretty boy,” he added, winking at Dean who merely laughed, trying to hide his blush by ducking his head.
“Maybe you should go to your brother’s Christmas party tomorrow, rather than staying alone in that old cold house of yours,” Benny offered but Dean merely dismissed the thought with a wave of his hand.
“This song is beautiful,” Cassie commented, watching Dean play. Dean grinned cheekily and continued to play, “what song is it? I don’t think I’ve ever heard it.”
“Oh you’re only a year older than me… I was scared you would be a lot older or something…” Dean blushed, not able to stop the nervous words spilling out.
He made a mental note to apologize to Jack on Dean's behalf for the barrage of prayers the hunter had undoubtedly sent Jack's way.
Sam had been running himself ragged, keeping their new band of hunters safe, looking for ways to stop Michael. Dean couldn't abandon his brother to do all the work alone, no matter how much he longed to hold his angel close and just tell the world to go to hell.
“Yeah,” Dean said, his hand returning to rub the back of his neck again as he explained, “It’s got the same number as your old phone. You’ll be able to see any calls… or texts you missed while you were…”
Castiel felt delight stretch his mouth into a wide grin as he looked up at Dean and said, “I did it!”
good. Dean could count the number of people in his life that had ever had that kind of faith in him on one hand and there were even fewer that he had trusted just as much in return.
A glimmer of hope filled his eyes at whatever he found there. He asked breathlessly, “What… what are you trying to say, Dean?”
Dean braced his hands on the sink and told himself that they were just words. Just three little words were all that stood between Dean and Cas being together after all these years. And yet, the idea of actually saying those words out loud left Dean in a cold sweat.
Cas nodded expectantly and settled back against the headboard, seeming content to wait for Dean to put his thoughts in order.
But, if there was one thing that Castiel had learned after a decade of following the Winchesters around, it was that no power in heaven or on earth could make Dean talk about his feelings before he was damn good and ready.
That was before Michael. Now Dean was having nightmares with almost the same frequency and intensity as he had when he had gotten back from Hell.
A few hours of messy cleanup and one giant bonfire later, the four of them had packed their aching bodies into the Impala and headed for the nearest motel.
Cas had flowed through the nest like warm honey, gliding gracefully, lethally along, taking down vampire after vampire.
Cas seemed to deflate a bit at that and his face fell slightly as he fiddled with the edge of his own mug of coffee.
Dean cleared his throat and turned back around with a grin that looked a little forced, staying where he was on the other side of the room as he suggested, “Now you try one.”
Dean had taken pity on Castiel and formed the first batch of burgers himself, and was now standing across the room frying them, humming absently, as Castiel tried to form the next batch.
Intel had come through from some of Eileen’s contacts about a vamp nest in a small town a few states away, and Sam, Dean, Eileen, and Cas had taken off as soon as they’d all been packed, leaving a note for Jack telling him where they’d gone in case he returned from his latest trip to heaven before they got back.
“I had a lot of time to think, while you were… gone,” Dean said to his own lap. “Hell, I must have replayed what you said at least a thousand times.”
Dean was practically dead on his feet, yet here he lay, in the dark, staring up at the ceiling, waiting for the blessed peace of sleep to come claim him. And sleep was being a bitch.
“Do you want to walk around a bit? Maybe do some more people-watching?” Dean asked once they had finished eating.
Castiel was about to ask why he would need to know what calls he had missed while he was essentially dead, but Dean cut him off with a nervous chuckle before he could get the words out.
Dean Winchester didn’t look like much, just the same as almost every other new baby boy, but Castiel felt a smile tug at his lips as Dean whined slightly in his sleep. Tomorrow the house would be flooded with well-wishing family and friends.  As the couple placed their son in his crib and retired for the night Castiel found himself staying and watching over the sleeping child.
When Dean arrived home I zoomed out of the house, making him follow me, but I tried to get him to follow me. Even if that meant hiding a little bit. I hoped if we got to the shack we built he would work out who I was. But by the time I got inside, he was fast enough to pick me up. “How did you know how to get here? And with the way that only Cas and I knew?” Dean asked, looking around.
So Dean followed Death, weaving between the headstones, for what felt like an eternity and yet not long enough. Until finally Death slowed to a stop, standing silently by a stone, and nodding to it. Dean took it as an indication to read the inscription.
“Cas… you’re killing me man!” Dean huffed, covering his face with one of his arms and laughing bitterly.
He begged through text, knowing she would be at the fair anyway, scouting out the new girl who was apparently working at the kissing booth.
“Sure, if you promise not just to go on about making dolls,” Castiel agreed making the caramel haired male perk up. Taking the dolls Castiel bid farewell to the man and went out to his car, stopping when Dean raced out calling his name.
The day after tomorrow, Dean would be flying home to Kansas for Christmas, and wouldn’t be able to see Castiel for two full weeks. And to the drunken mind of the twenty-one-year-old, this was a perfectly reasonable memento of his friend to take. Not a picture or something the other man could have willingly gave him, no, it had to be his underwear. This was for reasons still yet unknown, at least to Dean Winchester, who was heavily in denial about his crush on his best friend. Who, for the last twenty minutes, had been attempting to shimmy up the drain pipe to access Castiel’s room from the outside.
know Benny Lafitte,” Gabriel declared in an overdramatic tone, gasping as though Dean had just insulted his mother… Dean stared at him incredulously for a moment before Gabriel sobered up, “you used to be more fun,” Gabriel told him before appearing slightly closer and grabbing his face, twisting his own wrist around so he could move Dean’s face to look at the kitchens where a familiar face was laughing at something a small, pretty woman had said.
After ten minutes of tedious silence, Dean had dropped the girl at her place, not even saying goodbye, and gone to the one place nobody except him, his brother and Cas knew about. They called it the bunker. When Dean was in the abandoned bomb shelter he quickly shed his pants and clutched his hard cock. He had put off screwing that girl; he didn’t want to take something so important from someone. Not when he had lost it in a less then special way. But the downside to that; he was now so hard he had spots clouding his vision. Dean’s hand rubbed down his, in his opinion, massive shaft as he bit his lip and imagined the babe from his favourite porno, casa erotica 13. Only to yank his hand off his dripping member when he heard the bunker door creak open. Dean practically jumped into his pants, the denim rough against his manhood. Dean sat down at the table he and his brother had brought down there and pretended he was asleep. Only to be ‘woken up’ by a very disheveled Cas. “Cas?” he muttered, acting as spaced out as he possibly could.
However this story is not about their careers or the like, it is a Christmas tale, and we need to begin.
“Nobody in your room hey Dean?” Sam’s voice cut in before either of them could try and make a logical conclusion.
“No…” Dean whispered, his heart clenching and unclenching as he went short of breath. His fears were confirmed when the man turned around, being swallowed into a hug from his brother, his enchantingly blue eyes, his face all but drained of colour from the cold and yet his nose and the high points of his face was all read. He looked just as beautiful as he had all those years ago.
“D-Death?” Dean gulped, before laughing weakly, “I think I’ll stick to ghost of Christmas yet to come,” he added, getting only another nod in response. Dean scrambled off of the couch, his skin prickling under the gaze of the man, but not in the way that Crowley had made his skin prickle, no this feeling was much more grave feeling to it. When Dean was standing he looked to the man for direction, but rather than leading him through a door, this one merely lifted his cane and connected it back to the floor with a snap and the world began to spin around Dean and suddenly he was outside the Soup Kitchen he had seen full and bursting with life just a few hours ago.
“I told you he had a boyfriend!” Sam grinned, coming into the kitchen and stealing one of the piping hot pancakes.
“Prince Castiel, take care of him, he’s a bit of a doofus,” Lisa teased, poking her tongue out at Dean who playfully glared back at her.
“Gabriel I am your brother!” I meowed, beginning to freak out. Don’t give me away. I’m your brother! I’m a human! Gabriel kept me in his hand as he went to his room and picked up his phone, calling a family friend who had been talking about adopting a cat lately.
“This will be our first child’s room,” she smiled, pressing her hand to her stomach lightly, “do you think this room was a man’s or a woman’s?” she asked her husband who leant on the door. Castiel huffed a light laugh. It had been his room originally, but after his death Anna had taken it, hence the fainting couch which was a much more feminine choice.
“It was quite difficult to shoot the ducks in the little booth,” Cas said, before leaning closer to Dean conspiratorially—which made Dean hope that his face didn’t look as dazed as he felt—and confided, “I don’t think these people know very much about guns, Dean. The sights on all of the weapons they have are completely off true.”
“…she said it was the prize for one of the games, and I just had to try and get it,” Cas said, positively vibrating with excitement.
Before Castiel could finish his question, Dean had crossed the distance between them in two long strides, gripped Castiel’s face in his hands, and plastered his lips to Castiel’s.
Which was how Dean found himself standing in a quiet pocket on the Kansas State Fairgrounds watching the tide of humanity pass him by in a deafening roar of laughter, happy screams, and more bells and whistles than he had ever heard in one place, all highlighted by flashing, brightly colored lights that lit up the night sky like it was broad daylight. Without Castiel.
Dean stood across from Castiel, hands now unclenched from the counter and dangling limply at his sides as he stared mutely at Castiel’s face.
Dean gave himself a stern look in the mirror and told himself to march right out into the room and just fucking say it already.
Surely if Cas had had a problem with this he wouldn't have let Dean snuggle up to him while he slept, and he definitely wouldn't have put his arm around Dean to make him more comfortable.
And it was also odd that he had been scanning the crowd waiting for Cas to come back for—he threw the cold and soggy elephant ear in the trash and checked his watch—twenty minutes now.
“Thanks, Cas,” Dean said, and he couldn’t have stopped the grin that broke out on his face if his life depended on it.
Cas closed his eyes and focused on slowing his breathing enough to match Dean's as he slept and settled into the familiar, quiet peace that accompanied this ritual.
Dean almost always preferred to be alone when he was cooking, often shooing everyone else out of the kitchen so that he could work in peace.
He was pondering why that suddenly seemed like such an easy, natural thing to do when he realized something that hit him between the eyes like a freight train.
Dean’s entire body sagged in relief as he gathered Cas up in his arms and pulled him in close. He let out an unsteady huff of air and turned his head to place a quick kiss on Cas’ hair, at which Cas honest-to-god giggled.
His hair was mussed, as though he had been running his hands through it, and the set of his shoulders told Castiel that Dean had most likely been pacing restlessly since he had delivered the phone.
And it worked. Before long he had formed a perfectly acceptable hamburger patty. It wasn’t a very even thickness and not nearly as round as the ones Dean had made, but it was actually usable.
The bright lights and smiling crowds had seemed to fascinate Cas, and Dean had been reminded that the angel hadn't had much experience with large crowds before. Hunting was lonely work and the types of monsters that they usually went after tended to avoid cities.
"Dean," Cas tried calling to him again as he dodged Dean's blows, "I'm here. You're in the bunker. You're safe. Everyone's safe. It's okay."
The shaky dregs of adrenaline that were left in Dean’s system oozed into his bloodstream, pushing his weary muscles to tighten and his hands to shake.
Castiel scooped up some of the ground beef hesitantly and began slowly and carefully patting it into shape.
And maybe fact that Jack and Cas—and any other angels who happened to be on earth—were effectively human, unless they needed their angel mojo to protect themselves or others, had thrown Dean for a bit of a loop at first.
Cas gentled his tone. "Dean you're okay. I'm here. Sam is here. Your mom and Jack and Bobby are here. Everybody's safe... Michael is gone."
Dean brushed his knuckles down Castiel’s cheek and said, simply, “Wanted to do that for a long time. Never thought I could.”
Castiel wished, for at least the hundredth time since his return, that he still had the power to read Dean’s mind.
Dean was vividly reminded of the look on Sam's face when he had caught Dean packing extra sunscreen and bug spray in Cas' bag before they had left for a hunt last week.
Instead, Dean took a deep breath and went for something a little more honest. “I would love to watch the sunrise with you, Cas.”
He cleared his throat again and looked out toward the horizon, suddenly unable to maintain eye contact.
Maybe if Dean just stayed here, with Cas, forever he could pretend that all of it had never happened. He knew that if he left this moment, everything would come crashing down on him again, memories would resurface and he'd have to face them.
Hell, the entire reason the two of them had decided to work this case together was so that they could have some time away from the bunker, alone.
Dean mentally rolled his eyes at the sappy turn his own thoughts had taken even as he felt a warmth that had nothing to do with coffee curl in his chest and wind its way around his heart.
The anger in Dean’s messages left Castiel’s chest aching with sympathy as he sank down onto the edge of the bed.
Castiel froze, unsure what to expect from Dean when the hunter saw that Castiel had made no progress whatsoever.
Dean glanced back at Cas after about a dozen yards to make sure that the angel wasn’t getting overwhelmed by the crowds, only to find that Cas wasn’t people watching this time.
When the angel had asked him how many of those nightmares Dean had had while Cas was gone, he had looked away and growled, "Enough."
Cas had no idea how long they stayed like that, holding each other together in the dark. Finally, Dean's grip started to loosen, and Cas realized that Dean had drifted off to sleep again. Cas shifted slightly and gently laid Dean back on the bed, pulling his blankets up to cover his chest.
A voice in the back of Dean’s mind tried to argue that it was embarrassing, that Dean should scoff and tell Cas exactly why it wasn’t something that he should give to Dean. That it just wasn’t something that ‘real men’ should do.
Hands that had once cradled the most precious thing in all the multiverse—Dean Winchester’s soul—as Castiel had torn through innumerable squadrons of demons to fight his way out of hell. Hands that had woven and stitched the very molecules of Dean’s body back together before delicately suspending his soul safely within once more.
“Come on,” Dean said, cradling the little bear to his chest with one hand and grabbing Cas’ hand with the other. “I’m going to get you that elephant ear,” and he yanked Cas into the crowd.
Cas therefore had two options. He could give up on getting any actual rest with Dean and go back to his own room to overanalyze the situation all night, or he could pluck up the courage to face Dean and the possibly extremely awkward conversation waiting on the other side of this door.
Dean jumped across to turn off the stove and move the blackened burger pan to the sink. He turned back toward Castiel with a sheepish grin on face but then looked down and burst out laughing.
“You can stay there… if you want,” Dean offered haltingly as he rubbed a hand over the back of his neck.
Not that he had made a habit of that even when he had had the power. Dean had been very clear that it was an invasion of privacy.
seep into his skin like sunshine on a cold winter’s morning, flowing down inside and twining itself around his heart. A gentle stillness that settled something deep inside Dean, and he wondered if this was what true peace felt like.
Dean moved over to wash his hands at the sink and Castiel took the opportunity to really look at him.
All those nights during heaven's war, when the sights and sounds of his brothers and sisters dying had become too much, he'd been desperate to find something, anything, to forget the horror for a little while.
“Just because he’s a little bit more human than he used to be, it doesn’t mean he’s helpless, Dean,” Sam had said.
But the smile which broke out on Cas’ face—which Dean swore shone far brighter than any neon lights ever could—made it all worth it.
Not to mention, Cas seemed to be okay with their current position. His breathing was deep and even, and Dean could hear his heart beating calmly in his chest. If Dean hadn't known better, he would have said that Cas was asleep.
They wandered farther through the crowds, the deafening noise and chaotic sights fading into the background as Dean’s focus narrowed down to the hand clutched tightly, possessively in his… and his own internal panic.
The very first day that they had been back, Cas had chugged a cup of coffee that was way too hot and burned his damn tongue.
Dean rolled on to his side and stared at the pillow that Cas had used last night, a slight smile playing on his lips when he remembered the warm safety he had felt that morning, waking up in the crook of Cas' arm.
When they finally pulled away to breathe, Cas looked as stunned as Dean felt, his eyes staying closed for a moment longer than necessary before blinking slowly open.
“Dean! I did it!” Cas proclaimed loudly as soon as he was close enough to be heard over the roaring crowds around them.
"Dean, you're not going to be able to breathe until you calm down," Cas said sternly, his fear for the hunter growing every second he wasn’t able to draw breath.
…And if he kept telling himself that, maybe the knot of unease in his gut would get with the program and loosen the hell up already.
His smile—which was normally small and quiet and rare—was wider and more carefree than Dean had ever seen it.
After weeks of of hemming and hawing, trying to process Cas’ confession, and subsequent death and resurrection.
They broke apart again several minutes later when the acrid smell of smoke broke through their love-clouded daze.
Cas chuckled and rolled his eyes a little, like Dean doing anything to hurt him was the most ridiculous thing he had ever heard of, which was… good. It was
But then he hesitated. Dean had gone to all the trouble to set up this new phone with his old number. He had seemed to want Castiel to understand what that meant, emphasizing it until he was sure that Castiel had understood, even though he had clearly been uncomfortable talking about it.
Cas was still standing across from Dean in the little pocket of calm they had found, and he was looking more and more worried the longer Dean just stood there thinking furiously and staring silently at him like a moron.
They pulled away to breathe some minutes later, staying close enough to share each other’s breath, Dean seeming as reluctant as Castiel to lose this new-found closeness.
Castiel had to pause to draw a shaky breath and wipe the tears out of his eyes before he could continue reading.
Dean told the voice that it could take everything it had to say, bundle it up into a nice tight ball, and shove it.
His eyes flew open as Dean reached across him to the bedside table and slapped the offending alarm off none too gently.
Dean cleared his throat and discarded all of the snarky responses that had immediately clamored into his brain when Cas had finished speaking. (Seriously, having sarcasm as a reflexive defense mechanism when conversations turned emotional was a royal pain in the ass.)
"Good morning, Dean." Cas' voice had come out deeper than usual, which the angel told himself was just because he hadn't used it in several hours.
Cas himself was still getting used to having powers one minute and having none the next. The only time he really had them now was when they were hunting, and hunts had been few and far between lately.
They shared the ear in an easy silence, letting the noises of the festival wash over them. Dean had a little bit of trouble eating without getting the sticky cinnamon sugar all over his new little plush friend, but he managed it.
Dean’s head swam as he poured a decade’s worth of love and longing, every impossible, awe-inspiring thing that he had ever felt for Cas, into the kiss.
It shouldn’t even be that big a deal; Cas had already done the hard part and told Dean how he felt. All Dean had to do was find some way to let the guy know that he felt the same.
Anyway, here you come along, a freakin’ angel of the lord and you just keep choosing to help me no matter what
panicked slightly some hours before when Dean had turned and grabbed him around the middle, snuggling closer.
But today, out of a clear blue sky, he had walked up to Castiel and offered to teach him how to make the hamburgers he so loved.
Cas didn’t seem to think so, though. He looked up at Dean and beamed a smile at him that a thousand sunrises couldn’t hope to outshine.
The bear had vibrant green eyes and was wearing a tiny little faux-leather jacket with a matching goddamn green heart embroidered on the back.
Dean was just about ready to find an employee and have them page Cas like some lost child, when the angel in question came walking out of the sea of humanity surging around him like Moses parting the Red Sea.
His eyes shone with confidence, flashing in the brightly-colored lights and reminding Dean of a night so many years ago in a dusty, warded barn when this impossible, beautiful being had strolled right into his life and upended everything he had ever known.
But Castiel cut him off impatiently by crossing the room in two quick strides and slamming his mouth over Dean’s.
…Because fried food is delicious, not because Dean would secretly do just about anything to keep Cas smiling and happy like that… Shut up.
Cas held on, determined to let Dean be the one to let go first; Cas had nowhere to be, he would hold on as long as Dean needed him to.
was the sexiest thing he had ever seen, no matter what he was doing, and find some way to just roll with it.
He rushed to explain, “I mean, about you not being able to have what you want. About… about me not feeling the same.”
Dean seemed to sense Castiel’s skepticism and rushed to continue, “I just got your new phone set up.” He hesitated before holding the device out for Castiel to take. “I was able to program it with your old number.”
Castiel’s eyebrows furrowed as he opened his messaging app and saw that all of the text messages came from Dean.
Cas had gently moved his arm around Dean and the hunter had immediately snuggled in closer and had rested his head on the angel's shoulder.
Dean cradled the warm mug closer to him as he waited for the heavenly elixir to cool enough that he could take a sip without burning his tongue.
The hopeful tone sent another aching spasm through Castiel, even as his heart warmed at the fierce determination evident in Dean's messages.
Castiel smiled down at the screen, they must have been so excited, the day that they had defeated Chuck. He felt a slight pang that he hadn’t been there to share it with them.
Castiel may have been incapable of forming hamburger patties to save his life, but one thing he had always been good at was paying attention to Dean.
You can say all of this and more about the creator of the multiverse and Dean will agree with you one hundred percent.
He could tell by the way Dean said the words that there was some significance to them which Castiel did not understand, and he felt his head tilting slightly to the side as he took the phone and asked, “My old number?”
Cas’ face dipped briefly into a look of concern as he said, “After I won, I offered to help the man fix his gun sights but he just scowled at me and told me to leave.”
“Home.” Dean huffed out a laugh, running over to the front door and gliding his hand down the wooden door.
“D-Dean that was amazing…” Cas spoke softly, trailing his finger in a circle on Dean’s chest. Dean just laughed.
He then proceeded to close the door and remove his clothes, shedding down until he was in the buff and then climbed into bed with me. I immediately curled up on the pillow next to him on his king sized bed. Blushing at the fact that if I woke up human we would both be naked… in the same bed. I let those images lull me to sleep…
It would be nearing on twelve am when Dean would finally realise that the kitchen window was not only lower than the bedroom window, but the lock had been broken in a particularly heated nerf war. They were still finding nerf bullets around the house in some unlikely areas. It would take Dean another half hour to figure out how to get through the window without breaking anything. He would break three mugs and a plate getting in.
“If it gets any bigger, I'm going to need a bigger mouth.” Dean groaned, yelping slightly when Castiel hit his prostate.
“He probably just heard the name somewhere and created a face for the name,” his wife Deanna replied, but she wasn’t really paying attention to her husband, more to the baby who she was making faces at. Outside a car pulled up, signifying John was home from work for the day. He came in and made a surprised noise at the sight of the collection of people. Dean came barrelling out and hugged his father before anybody could move. Castiel laughed at the little boy before deciding to go hide in the library for a little while, at least until Dean’s family had left.
As Castiel flicked on the light, Dean flinched, hissing at the sudden brightness of the room. “Dean?” Castiel asked, not quite realising how drunk his friend who stood before him was. Dean held up his finger to his lips.
“Dean?” Castiel asked, placing one of his hands above Dean’s arm. He couldn’t touch the boy unless he forced it, but that usually gave him headaches, and he didn’t think that was a good idea at this point in time.
“I think he said his name was Gabe…” Sam said, getting worried when Dean began to have a coughing fit.
The stage, unluckily for them wasn’t too far away, and they got there in record speed. As the blue eyed male attempted to leave for the stage, he felt himself being pulled back into Dean’s arms with a light tug of an unrelenting hand. “Dean I have to-“ Castiel tried, only for his sentence to be cut off by Dean’s lips, something he melted into happily. Their hands stayed by their sides, clasped as they kissed, not noticing people staring at them or their brothers about to interrupt.
“What do you think happens to children on the streets?” he said in way of answer before he once more raised his cane before clacking it back to the ground.
“Dean! Oh my lord what happened?” She asked, walking over in quick strides and grabbing Dean’s wrist, dragging him to the kitchen. Me still in his arms. Inside the kitchen, Ellen and my dad stood, talking about me. Stopping when they saw Dean and his eye.
“Fuck. Me. Master.” Castiel needed no more encouragement, bouncing the younger on his lap making Dean mewl and moan, his voice so loud Gabriel could probably hear it.
“All I know is the last owner of this house was a woman named Anna,” John told his wife, “and that she passed away twenty years ago, leaving no surviving children.”
“Awe… you’re so cute! But we told Cas he wasn’t allowed to have another cat. I guess you’ll have to go to a new family little one!”
“Dean, I like you too,” Castiel laughed, grinning harder than he ever had. And unlike in the television show, this will not end with him dying, in this house we respect our gays and would not kill them right after the confession, let alone kill them by confession because holy mother fucking god that was… eventful. “I have since the moment I met you, I mean how could I not, you’re amazing. You do stupid things sometimes, like break into my house to steal my underwear.”
“No, I still have work to do,” Dean groaned, “as nobody has agreed to work tomorrow I might as well not come in tomorrow anyway.”
“Either way what’s done is done,” I told him, kissing him and helping as he maneuvered us into a position that he could fuck me from without hurting me too much. He slowly pushed himself into me, holding me tightly and I clutched to him, hissing in pain from the unfamiliar feeling of his length inside me. When he was fully in me he stopped moving and held my face to calm me down.
She’s worried. I shrug it off, tell her I’m fine. I’m fine; I think I’m trying to convince myself too.
“Could someone imaginary teach you how to play piano?” Castiel snorted, “or teach you stuff you didn’t know about the American Civil War?”
Dean called his shop girl as soon as Castiel left, asking when she was getting there as he had a doll to finish. She arrived not long after the call and Dean went to make the clothes for the angel. A dark blue suit with a blue and white silk tie and a light brown coat. It took him nearly half the  day to sow the small clothes, but when they were done they made the little angel doll look like Castiel. After dressing the doll he went to work on making little wings. He decided they needed to be black to match his hair, they were nearly done when he got a text saying where Castiel lived and that he would be home in an hour. Dean pushed himself away from his work station, he dashed downstairs to tell Jo, his shop girl, to close up and go home. She did as she was told and Dean had a quick shower, getting himself into a black suit with a red tie. Grabbing his keys Dean drove his baby, a 67 Chevrolet Impala, to pick Castiel up. All but running to the door of the small house, Dean knocked on the door nervously.
“I guess my subconscious wrote it and that was the only way I could get myself to play it,” Dean shrugged, “I don’t know, I’m no shrink.”
“Perfect to raise an army of children?” the man – John – joked, making Castiel wince slightly, he didn’t understand modern humour.
“But.. I- where- Benny?” Dean asked to many questions, sitting up, only to fall back on his back and crying in pain.
“Why am I a cat!” I cried, sitting down roughly. Rubbing my eyes with my paws as tears began to build up. “I want to be human. I want to hold Dean when he holds me! I want him to love me. In every sense of the word.” I practically howled.
“You can just call me Cas,” Castiel told the little boy, remembering the nickname Anna used to call him.
Dean looked around, finding himself alone in his room once more. Without missing a heartbeat, Dean flounced into his walk-in-wardrobe and flicked on the light, making a beeline for the box of things he couldn’t bring himself to throw away. Inside were various things such as family photos (Mary and John at their wedding, Mary holding him, Mary holding Sam, Dean holding Sam, first birthday’s for both brothers and a Christmas picture from their last Christmas as a proper family), a photo of him and Benny when they were in collage (they were drunk and shirtless, Cas was in the background with his hand over his mouth and his eyes wide, on the back it said ‘they decided to go skinny dipping’ in Cas’ handwriting), several photos of him and Cas (them before they got together, having fallen asleep resting against each other whilst studying for finals. One just after they got together where they were holding hands and Dean was flipping off whoever took the picture as Cas laughed with his whole body. A picture where they were kissing, Dean’s arms wrapped around Cas’ body to hold him as closely as possible whilst Cas had his hands weaved into Dean’s hair. One of Dean reclining on a couch in a female slutty Santa costume with Cas in a female’s slutty Elf costume on his lap, this time they were both laughing at something.), a small plush bee that Cas had won him at a carnival – Dean later winning him a teddy bear that was almost as big as him, there was a poem Cas had written him and a small, white box. Dean picked up the box and looked at it, his heart clenching painfully in his chest.
“So you were stuck at boarding school on Christmas?” Crowley asked, suddenly on the top bunk of one of the four beds in the room. Dean ignored him as he watched his younger self climb into his bed – one of the bottom bunks, closest to the window – and hide under the scratchy, woollen blanket like a scared child.
“C-Cas, what will happen when you get bored of me?” Dean asked, looking up at the slightly taller man. Cursing at his rather short height.
“More? More?” Benny asked, holding his hand to his chest as though he had been insulted before a big smile spread across his face, “of course Claire,” he told her, ladling  some soup – which Dean assumed was what he had been stirring – into her bowl making the little girl grin and running off to eat the soup before it cooled.
“What are you looking for there, Dean?” Castiel asked, lips quirking as his drunk friend pulled out yet another pair of his underwear and stretched them slightly before returning them to the messy drawer. A drawer, I should mention, that was perfectly neat before Dean had arrived.
“Merry Christmas to you too Deano,” Gabriel snorted, his eyes landing on the ring and his mouth gaping open in confusion as he suddenly appeared closer to Dean and plucking it out of his hand before he could complain.
“So my mother and yours pulled you out of school yesterday, ruining my big speech,” Dean grinned, looking down at me with those impossibly green eyes.
Everyone filtered in like they had before, this time greeting Dean, some in shock. All glad to see him. But the one person he was nervous to see wasn’t there yet, and that filled him with more anxiety than he described, and so when Gabriel began the story Cas would arrive during, Dean excused himself, saying he needed some air. And Gabriel agreed, saying that it had to have been too much Christmas for him and that he needs a moment to himself.
“My name is Castiel Novak and I died in 1870,” Castiel told them quietly, “my father was a merchant, my mother the daughter of a lawyer, my sister was the last owner of the house and I have been watching over your sons since they were born.”
“My arse hurts,” Dean began, giving Castiel a wicked idea, he pushed Dean onto the mattress kissing him but not touching any other part of the sore boy’s body.
“I have an adopted daughter and a two adopted siblings,” Castiel smiled handing Dean the doll which was then carefully placed in a box like the red headed one. Jotting down who each of the dolls were for Castiel fished out his wallet from his pocket.
“No, all you said is that you wanted to leave,” Crowley smirked, looking around the room in disgust. He had every right to turn his nose up, before Dean’s eyes was the dormitory he had spent his nights in during his teenage years, after the death of his mother Dean’s father had gone off the rails and that also sent Dean off the rails, by the time he was thirteen a permanently drunk John could no longer could deal with Dean’s rebellious personality and sent him to a boarding school.
“Me? Not have anything to prepare us with?” Dean laughed, picking me up by the waist. He walked us over to his car where he threw me down onto the back seat before shedding his shirt and flannel and climbing on top of me. Grinding his hips down on me so our groins rubbed together making me unable to breath. “Are you sure you want this?” he asked, stopping mid rock.
“I’m going to stop you there!” Dean interrupted, covering his crotch with both hands, “I do not have an erection.”
“I wish I was allowed to take care of myself,” Claire pouted, “all the adults who are supposed to care don’t.”
Late on a December night, not long before Christmas, Dean had realized he had no Angel for his ‘tree’. Basically a bunch of empty, lidless hat boxes he had stacked up in height order and painted green with baubles and tinsel. He had even poked real fairy lights into it so it would light up. But he had no angel. He begun to construct it, but didn’t know what hair or eye colour to give it, let alone skin colour or clothes to give it.
“I wonder if I’ll get to see what I got early!” the ghost version of Gabriel mused, peeking over Charlie’s shoulder as she placed various gifts under the tree, “oh hey she brought you one too!”
Castiel opened the door to Dean’s shop, inhaling the familiar scent with a small smile. Noticing the beautiful, albeit older, lady Castiel said hello in the most charming way he could muster, assuming it was Dean’s mother. “You must be Castiel! Dean told me so much about you! I'm Mary,” Mary smiled, rushing around the counter to hug Castiel.
Mary and Gabriel left Castiel and Dean alone for a little while after that, at which point Castiel shed all his restricting clothes and climbed into the bed with his lover, cuddling the blonde until he woke up.
“I have to get Sammy from the hospital, how about I drop you off at my place and text my mum that you’re okay, she went out with her friends for the day,” Dean told me, making worry about Sam.
Castiel was lounging on the remnants of the fainting couch in his old bedroom when he heard it. The front door creaking open and a pair of voices. He could make out one of the voices was male, and the other female. Phasing through the furniture and floorboards Castiel floated towards the voices, more so out of curiosity than anything else.
“And you’re Dean’s imaginary friend aren’t you,” Mary asked quietly, “that’s where he got the name.”
Dean awoke on Christmas morning feeling like a new person. He practically threw himself out of his bed. Almost slipped in the shower in his rush. Nearly forgot to get dressed before leaving the house. But the one thing he remembered was to pocket the ring for Cas, because he was finally going to set things right with Cas – whether Cas took him back or not.
“But would you like to keep me company until my manager comes?” I ask shyly, watching him brighten up.
“Yes you are Gabriel,” I purred, smiling sympathetically at my brother who gaped at me as Dean began to climb the stairs with me still in his arms. “Will they be okay?” I asked, Dean, curling up on his bed as he stripped and joined me.
“You fifteen ladies go in front of Cas, he needs me to be there cheering him on,” Charlie teased, continuing up the line as I felt myself begin hyperventilate. Charlie was next to me sooner then I realized, probably sweet talked her way to the front to kiss the girl and get to me before I passed out. “Come on Cas, you have to do this, you’ll regret everything if you don’t,” she talked, her voice soothing me as panicked.
Dean Winchester was said to be one of the most beautiful people in the world. His green eyes could be compared to many things, but none of them compared to their beauty. His hair was softer than the feather of a dove soaked in the milk of an ass and dried in the heat of a dragon’s fire. But once again the colour could be described as many things, but the most agree with is caramel. And for the sake of your dignity we won’t go into his skin… and he was seen this way from the age of nine. But at the age of sixteen, two years into the war, he was taken from his home because his father valued his own life over his son’s. And this is where our story starts.
“Gay? No I am not happy, why would I be happy about this Dean! I’m a fucking abomination!” Castiel cried.
“Benny by this point is awaiting his hanging, we’re in your room and your mother knows who I am,” Castiel told the pained boy, scooping him up in his arms and hugging him.
“Sam loves her, but she’s more of a supportive sister figure, so he will take it really hard… so he will grieve, but that’s natural,” Dean sighed.
“Better slow down there brother,” Benny snorted, making Dean turn around to glare at the head chef.  Benny was in his coat and hat, ready to leave for the night, “in fact perhaps you should just go home.”
“I hope he says yes,” Claire smiled softly, before looking down, “if you’re going to adopt me does that mean I have to go back to my foster family first?”
“I don’t know he’s been depressed since you two got together, he was nuts for you,” Gabe put in, getting a sharp jab in the gut from Sam and get dragged away by Michael to get scolded.
“Good. The bastard deserves it!” Dean spat, turning onto his back and laughing bitterly. Castiel took this opportunity to straddle his lover and looked down at the beautiful boy.
“Very chick flick moment of you,” Dean’s voice cracked nervously, his face going bright red as Castiel stepped into his personal space, face hovering closely to Dean’s. Dean could smell chocolate and mint on Castiel’s breath, making his heart flutter. Thankfully they were both too love struck to realise how terrible Dean’s own breath smelt, both lost in each other’s eyes, hearts pounding as their fingers intertwined.
But that was because they were. “Cas,” Dean mumbled sadly, looking at the young pair, one being him in his nineteenth year and the other being the first and only person he really fell in love with. Castiel Novak was handsome from every angle you viewed him from. He had surreal, blue eyes that could not be compared to anything else on Earth in Dean’s opinion, at least not without downplaying their beauty. And his hair was generally messy, due to Cas’ absentmindedness, but Dean thought that was just part of his charm. “Dean?” Cas’s voice was deep and rough, sending chills down Dean’s spine, and if he hazarded a guess it was sending chills down the spine of his former self.
