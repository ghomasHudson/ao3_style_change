John focused on just breathing in Sherlock’s scent for some minutes, blocking the world and its exhilarating demands out. He literarily melted in the hug; he would have probably tumbled to the floor if it wasn’t for Sherlock’s firm hold around his chest. Grounding him. Soothing him. Keeping him safe. Safety; a strange concept for a crime-fighting PTSD-crippled ex-soldier; yet he found it, oh, how he wished he had realized it sooner; he wished he had realized sooner that safety was in Sherlock Holmes’ arms. His grip tightened. The concept of Sherlock moving away from him became unacceptable. Yet, he was embarrassed for being so needy; he was a grown man in his forties, no longer a hormone-meddled teenager, he should be over the clingy phase. But…
The closest thing to humiliation he ever felt made his skin crawl. The detective let out a theatrical groan. Enough of the emotional idiocy already, yesterday had been enough for a lifetime, as far as he was concerned. It was moments like these where Sherlock wished that the diagnosis of sociopathy wasn't just an excuse he thought of when he was a young and insecure man, struggling to understand his fellow humans and failing to care the slightliest about their moral compass. A sarcastic smirk fought itself on his face; for a person so opposed to labels he appeared to love hiding behind them. Sherlock Holmes, always the paradox- even to himself.
“Not soon, now” John couldn’t hide a small smirk. If her little majesty decided to be bossy again, not everything was lost.
The truth is, he doesn’t. Most days he just thinks he looks tired and old; with the bags under his eyes and the lines on his face. And the extra pudge around his middle he had gained over the years- not enough to worry or consider changing his lifestyle- but noticeable in comparison with his shape in his army days. He had been attractive, once. Then life happened.
The easiest thing would be to just tell him. That would also mean, however, to put everything in the open, and that was… terrifying to put it mildly. Because sure, they had been beating around the bush for the past half hour, sort of arriving at the conclusion that they both wanted this relationship but were quite uncertain of actually allowing this desire to have drastic consequences. Technically, given what they had already done with each other, they should have already passed this stage- but somehow they managed to skip the negotiation completely. Because fuck it, nothing about them could ever be easy, now couldn’t it? To admit… just how much his best friend meant to him made it real. And real meant out in the open. Which meant terribly vulnerable. John wasn’t so sure he was ready for that.
“Sherlock” he started in his calm doctor-voice “Do you hear me? Do you know where you are?” Said Sherlock abruptly snapped his head to face John directly, making his own neck crack with the suddenness of the movement. The blinking stopped suddenly, and instead he watched Sherlock’s face go into deduction-mode. Oh well, whatever made him happy, John supposed. Sure, an actual answer (or reaction that wasn’t medically suspicious) would have been nice, but as long as the genius wasn’t bolting on him, John considered it a success. Sort of.
smile, that special smile exclusively reserved for the doctor, and John felt some of his anxiety melt.
“Sherlock rarely sleeps and my old bedroom is Rosie’s room now. On nights where he does need to sleep, I’m taking the couch.”
"This is about Sherlock, for fuck's sake-" By the sound of his name, the detective was jerked out of his momentarily trip to his Mind Palace. His ears perked up. He was the content of the mysterious phone call! This was getting better by the second, what a great puzzle to keep his mind occupied! He wondered whom John could possibly talking about him-
So far, Sherlock didn’t even comment on the bed-situation. His nonchalance made John feel silly for being so touchy about it with Bobby.
Something so incredibly unlikely that he would have laughed at anyone who suggested it. Something… he had never admitted himself he longed for until the moment that it happened. The moment when Sherlock – mad genius, world’s only consulting detective, insufferable bastard, assistant-parent, John Watson’s Sherlock – brushed his lips softly against John’s.
“We’re done here.” Sherlock softly pulled his blogger closer to him, who gratefully sagged against him. The detective felt eyes upon his back, until Lestrade’s hushed orders made them disappear. Silently, all the Yarders left the crime scene to give the pair some privacy. Lestrade squeezed Sherlock’s shoulder on his way out in an appreciative gesture, and Sherlock nodded in his direction.
In the mornings he would chide himself for thinking this coldly about his Sherlock, especially when he was greeted with a small peck on the lips, or a quick side-hug. But still. John always had been doubtful in nature; and the past events only enforced him in his believe that it wasn’t wise to wear your heart on your sleeve. It could easily be broken like this. Sherlock broke his heart, once. The stiches he applied afterwards were still too fresh, the wound was still healing. John just didn’t want to take any risks, that’s all.
“Well, that’s our call!” he announces cheerily and busying himself with some oven-gloves, while the camera team rushes back over. Rosie is delighted at the attention Antoni directs her way as soon as the cake is out of the oven; cooing at her and showing her all the different yummy fruits that will go on her very special birthday cake.
John chuckled at the genuine question in Sherlock’s voice. “It’s a nice way of saying ‘shut up or I’ll throw you out.”
his shame, pressed his lips tightly together and turned, so Sherlock could see his face. An open invitation for deduction, which he normally dreaded. Sherlock thus had started to read him as less as possible. But now, the keenness of those sharp eyes and the conclusions of this ever-working mind felt far less exposing then to answer those questions.
John huddled his face into the soft pillow that smelled deliciously like Sherlock and let out a content sigh. He was beyond relief that not only the day ended, but that it ended with a sleepy detective in his arms. He knew that he should mind. After all, they weren't in a romantic relationship (something John only considered in theory, since it seemed impossible in practice), and it wasn't usual behavior for mates to spoon their mates in bed. But he didn't. He just couldn't bring himself to care one fucking bit, because Sherlock was alive, Sherlock was alright, and in this moment Sherlock was
. Something small, yet significant seemed to be missing. Before the fall, silence was easy and comfortable, now it was tense; they used to share causal touches in the enclosed space of their home, now John kept his distance; there used to be a glimmer of warm trust in John’s gaze whenever he looked at Sherlock, now there was always a small glimpse of doubt. Sherlock didn’t anticipate that he’d miss it. But he did.
Sherlock abruptly stops scanning the file and looks up at John with a calculating gaze. John knows he’s being discreetly deduced but has no idea what exactly Sherlock is looking for.
“Well, I….” Sherlock didn’t miss the momentarily hesitation. “Look it has been some shite months and we owe Mycroft a lot, and we both-“ He shot the detective a glare that clearly read ‘But especially you’- “haven’t been very grateful about it”
“It was the mid-wife. Had an affair with the father. Murder-weapon will be found in the garden pond.” he finished his deduction hurriedly, no longer caring about showing off his intellect. Not when John was obviously having a panic attack, a panic attack he very obviously noticed but ignored in favor of boasting.
Also, I've been thinking. I'm not really feeling the PATD lyrics for this fic anymore, so I'll be leaving them out from now on.
, John now remembers), places a reassuring hand on his shoulder and tells him they’re here to help with that. For the first time since his life has suddenly been invaded, John genuinely smiles. Bobby points that fact out, too, not unkindly.
His deepest fear. It might seem feeble, perhaps, childish even, but… the intensity with which every single gentle action on Sherlock’s part made the desire to… feel like this- cared, and cherished, and
Rosie eyed him suspicious for a second, before – finally! – she gave into her need for comfort. John saw it as a tiny triumph when she shyly buried her face in his dark blue shirt and let out a quivering breath. At least she wasn’t pouting anymore. At least, she let him in. Soothing, he massaged her scalp in circles – a technique that worked wonders even when she had been just a little baby. They stayed like this a little while, until the quiet sobs, evidence of the mood the toddler had worked herself into, lessened. Just when John thought he might never get his answer and proceeded to feel helplessly empty and at the mercy of a god of chance he didn’t believe in, Rosie, indeed, used her words. Or, one word, to be precise. One word, uttered quietly, but uttered with tones of great despair and need.
He closed his eyes, tried to stop breathing through his nose, but he found himself sucking in the smell greedily. The sound of his own elevated breathing was unpleasantly loud in his own ears, he silently hoped that John wouldn’t notice. He almost jumped when a warm hand touched his thigh. John noticed.
Which humiliated him deeply. He had tracked down Moriarty’s web, alone. He survived months of torture and pain, without ever being terrified for one second. Because he knew it had purpose for his work. He knew it was the right thing to survive, and he had been arrogant enough to assume (correctly) that he would. After all, Mycroft wouldn’t let him die. And he couldn’t die, not with John Watson waiting for him at home.
Lestrade sighed, knowing then and there he had lost the battle, and did the least he could do: Pushing the very noisy and very interested Donovan and Anderson out of the room, before closing the door quietly behind himself. The voices behind the wood became louder and could still be heard clearly in the hallway. “I tried” Lestrade mumbled to himself, feeling like a right idiot for having himself thrown out of his very own office.
“s alright” John mumbled, now lightly kissing along the elegant column of Sherlock’s neck. The detective gave a fully body shudder at every contact against the sensitive skin, which made John grin against the heated skin; pleased that he had found one of his partner’s sweet spots.
John momentarily tightened his grip, before he eased out of the embrace altogether. He didn’t look at Sherlock, but he didn’t have to for the master of deduction to pick up the sense of shyness and vulnerability still surrounding his blogger. Another strong emotion washed over him. To protect John, to please John, to make him
“Excuse me for a second” he mumbled with his smooth baritone voice laced with fondness, while he rubbed his slightly wet eyes with the back of his hand. “There’s something I have to do”
As eager as he had seemed before, the lack of response made him visibly insecure. When there was one thing that John Watson cared more about than his pride, it was Sherlock Holmes’ happiness. And if there was one thing that made him more uncomfortable than a moment of humiliation, it was an open display of Sherlock’s insecurities. Because he knew very well they were there, buried deep below the surface of a self-proclaimed sociopath. Sherlock tried, he tried so hard, and John was about to lose his cool because he, for once, wasn’t the dominant part of a romantic relationship?  Seriously? What the hell was he doing? Fleeing because this bloody gorgeous man managed to catch him off guard? This might be a once in a life time chance (tho John hoped it wasn’t) and he was going to blow it over nerves?! Hell no! If Sherlock, who was so foreign to relationships, affection, feelings, wasn’t afraid to show John what he felt, why would he be? He invaded Afghanistan, god damn it, he could manage to kiss his best friend. Except… that it was
There was no sound for some minutes except for John’s sobs. He should probably say something, Sherlock thought. Anything. But the generic so-called comforting phrases like “It will be okay” felt inappropriate, for they were hollow, they didn’t really
It wasn’t often that John Watson had a bad day. Sure, he had ‘this day is fucking surreal what is actually happening’- days, but one might guess that’s a common by-product from working and being in a relationship with Sherlock Holmes.
“Alright then.” The younger man mumbled under his breath, before cupping the doctor’s neck gently, and bringing their lips together. John was too shocked to register the kiss for some seconds- an overwhelming sensation of warm! Soft! Sherlock! Flooding his brain, before he caught up on it- and returned the sentiment, with vigor.
“I just know my ways to woo my doctor, hm?” John grinned up at him sheepishly, relived that all the anxiety and tension of the past week, and especially the past hours, melted away.
When he knocks lightly at Sherlock’s door and finds both him and Rosie engaged in animated “conversation” about the pop-up animal book his daughter (and Sherlock) adore beyond imagination, he has to grin.
Almost two decades later, he found himself constantly saving one ridiculous madman. Then again, it was kind of the same thing, wasn't it? After all, John was pretty positive about the fact that Sherlock Holmes somehow managed to become his world. He couldn't quite put his finger on the exact point in time where his addiction began, all he knew that Sherlock suddenly fully occupied his heart. Sneaked inside quietly, almost unnoticed and remained, against all the odds.
“He won’t leave you, Sherlock. But you” he sighed. Maybe this was the chance to finally give him a lecture to get through his thick scull. “the things you do… the stupid, careless, dangerous things, they scare him.”
to ask John today. There was a question that had been ghosting around his mind for the past two months, but he never had the nerve to ask it out loud. It was still a foreign concept to him to be anxious about speaking his mind, but damn, this was important. He had gathered up enough courage multiple times, but always chickened out in the last minute. The risk of John declining was… devastating to be honest. Sherlock honestly wasn’t sure how he would take a rejection. Still, he
John shifted a little, in an attempt to take some weight off his aching leg. “Still…” he trailed off, feeling his neck and ears grow warm under his partners intense gaze.
After around two hours wasted on the most boring case in history, Sherlock was greeted with a pink explosion that must have erupted in their kitchen. It was everywhere, covered every surface neatly and most of John’s clothes.
It was a sight he could get used to- a flustered Sherlock held a certain charm to himself that the doctor felt himself been drawn to. Just another side of Sherlock he slowly unwrapped, to learn a little bit more about the fascinating man behind the billowing code and snarky intellect. This Sherlock was almost… cute? He held an innocence, a genuine wonder that John really couldn’t explain. All he knew was that he wanted to see more of him.
John rather enjoyed the half a day off, picking Rosie up from Mrs. Hudson’s and taking her to the park; in high spirits as he was, indulging her every wish. Sherlock was nowhere to be found, unsurprisingly, but slipped into the hotel room quietly out of nowhere just in time for Rosie’s bedtime routine.
was not only unsettling, but also downright humiliating. He had been humiliating himself a little bit too often for his taste lately. However, he couldn’t concentrate enough to put his indifferent mask back on. Not with John’s hand not leaving his thigh the entire ride home.
John knows it’s a joke, but if he really, really wanted to, he could read something into it. He doesn’t, but he has to avert his eyes from Sherlock’s face. That look he sees on it makes it harder for him to ignore the flush of something deep in his belly at the prospect of Sherlock finding
“I’m sorry” They spoke at the same time. Surprised by the statement of the other, they looked at each other. “That was probably…. Not what you had in mind. I’m… I’m terribly inexperienced and-“
“I am,” he answers, feeling that they wouldn’t stop pushing if he hadn’t.  He has the feeling that this week was going to be an endless circle of him having to voice his emotions and them hugging it out. He isn’t so sure if he felt comforted by the prospect or horrified.
John parted them after some seconds, only to smile and whisper hoarsely against the younger man’s lips: “Thank you. God, Sherlock, thank you so much” His voice broke at the last syllable, as a he laughed like he hadn’t laughed in months, while tears streamed down his face. In a surge of joy, he hugged the lanky detective against his chest tightly, covering his whole face with butterfly kisses.
“You’re not observing. Clearly, you’re missing the clues. Your conclusion is wrong. If you take all the variables into account, the inevitable outcome-“
. The silence was soothing and relaxing, and John almost drifted off to sleep, when a soft, deep baritone voice broke the security of the night.
They started sharing a bed. John, still overcome by a very special sense of embarrassment, was grateful for it. It was easier to fight the urge to close in on himself when he wasn’t alone during the night, in the mornings. It was easier to feel calm and not work himself in a state of anxiety for
Before Sherlock could make a snarky remark or really any comment to save the situation, John was off in the kitchen, probably preparing himself some tea to calm down. The detective let out an irritated breath. All these…these social norms, and silly sentimental gestures... he couldn’t make a reason out of it. All he knew was that he somehow managed to upset John, which probably lead to less hair petting in the near future, which the detective very much pitied. He’d have to apologize eventually. But this action was so despite him when he didn’t know what he should feel sorry for.
John stares at the ceiling of the hotel room, a quiet simmer of excitement still bubbling around in his stomach. His filming had been finished after the shopping trip and the Fab 5 were busy with their respective interview recordings scheduled for the day.
"There we are" John smiled. Sherlock didn't look at him, but held his friend's hands just as tight as he had held the jumper seconds before. "C'mon" John managed to free one hand from the death-grip, but kept the other securely wrapped around Sherlock's cold palm. "Let's go home".
bed, feigning indifference, while he was clearly buzzing with nervous energy. John allowed himself a small smile, when he dropped the dressing gown again to crawl under the covers instead. Sherlock made a nearly inaudible sound when the mattress dipped with the newly added weight when John laid down on his side of the bed, facing the detective. Even in the darkness, John could make out that the detective’s cheeks and neck held a rosy color. He was worrying his lower lip between his teeth. Thinking. Deducing.
“Still I don’t- I don’t understand. Everything is so confusing” he groaned low, annoyed with his own inadequateness of dealing with emotions. “Every time I think that I figured it out, a variable changes, throws everything into chaos again”
“I love you, too,” John smiled, before continuing his story. And if he noticed Sherlock inching even closer to him, he didn’t comment on it, just silently enjoying the happiness it brought him.
“It’s kinda tough juggling a family and the work we do” Greg remarked, reminded of the time when his girls were still young and all the evenings in the office during which he missed them dearly.
It takes another ten minutes until Antoni re-gains his composure (and until somebody calms Jonathan down about the disappointment of not having been able to “touch those curls, honey!!!” and instead having to witness the “grossest thing ever”). When he does, he has enough gusto to criticize the barren state of the actual fridge (in total: milk, one carrot, Indian take-out leftovers, pickles). John’s not proud of it, so much so that he can’t disagree. It
He shouldn’t care, he was Sherlock Holmes! But when it came to John Watson, he cared very much so. He didn’t want John to be disappointed in him. He wanted John to like him, which was absurd in itself. Nobody ever liked him. He was an insufferable egocentric bastard, the kind of person you’d avoid. But not John Hamish Watson, no sir, who limped proudly into his life and refused to leave.
John is too astonished about all of this to pretend he’s humble about the way he looks right now. Because, damn, he looks
John, for his part, felt like someone punched him right in the face, in the best kind of ways. Everything was tingly and warm, relief mixed with affection and a deep fondness bloomed in his chest, seeping through every pore. Finally. Something… had always been missing, something… more…something big. Something he now saw in the stormy blue eyes of his mad genius. He bit his lower lip, suddenly overcome by a deep desire to cry, and laugh, and dance, and kiss Sherlock until they were exhausted and giddy. He coughed clumsily, to overplay the small noise escaping his throat.
Without another word, the particular man was gone, coat billowing behind him dramatically. Greg suppressed an eyeroll. Always the dramatic, that Sherlock Holmes. He considered his next moves, while idly staying on the floor a little bit longer. Just as he was about to mentally prepare himself for some greasy takeaway and a lonely night in front of the telly, his phone made a noise. Unlocking it, he started to smile like an idiot at the messenger id.
“I’m mad at myself for feeling this way, I try to keep my distance during the day but at night… I realize how much I… I missed you, Sherlock”
He’s had had troubles to feel attractive, to feel desirable, ever since he got shot. His chest, formerly one of his best assets with his defined tone of muscle and broad shoulders, became something he hid. He hadn’t taken off his shirt when sleeping with his countless post-war girlfriends.
The other man just smiles and listens; in all his short time with John Watson he had never heard the man talking so freely and animatedly as he is now. Karamo thinks idly to himself about just how much is gained when we tear down the walls we built around ourselves.
He tried again. A fellow student this time- Victor Trevor. Handsome, likeable, quick-witted Victor Trevor. It must have been somewhat closer to love, then. And it ended, of course it did.                    “Look, Sherlock. You’re so… much. And yet you’re… just not enough. I’m sorry”
But he did not waste any time on self-pity (there was enough time to ponder about his error once John was fast asleep during the night), but inched closer to the huddled-over, shaken form.
“Well, I didn’t ask him to save me, did I?!” John stopped his lecture to look at the younger man in disbelieve. The detective, by the time sulking and looking away, thought himself victorious when he was met with silence. However, Sherlock realized his mistake the second he met his friend’s eyes. There was a momentary flicker of an emotion Sherlock couldn’t quite place, before the doctor narrowed them to thin slits. How much Sherlock would adore the display of sentiment on the canvas of John’s face, not knowing what it meant, alarmed him more than he’d liked. It alarmed him so much, that he forgot to sulk for a second. He watched his friend take some deep, shaky breaths – a method to regain his composure – before his blogger closed his eyes and turned away from him.
“Oh, don’t be so melodramatic, I was fine” “How can you be so fucking oblivious about the whole thing?!” Now he was screaming again. He didn’t want to scream. But Sherlock as pushing his buttons, he was pushing them so damn well. “All I’m asking you for is to be careful. For me. For us. Isn’t that enough?!”
Still, it was sort of surprising. John’s right hand was wandering from thumbing a perk nipple softly, to Sherlock’s hip, daringly lower- while he kissed the younger man’s neck with vigor he hadn’t felt in a long time; while he scratched his friend’s sensitive scalp with skilled movements- lower still, until…
late, and the doctor didn’t give two flying fucks about it. This might be the most important moment of his life since Rosie was born, and he wouldn’t let it be ruined by his schedule. Or so he thought bravely, so he was ready to voice it and in a fit of passion throw the sneaky detective against the wall to show him that John Three Continents Watson wasn’t just some blushing virgin that shut down because a fucking Michelangelo kissed him- until everything deflated when he met Sherlock’s eyes.
John was angry, quite often so; being a passionate and temperamental man – a man of the heart so to speak. Sherlock had been pretty sure that he didn't have a heart. He had been so confident about the absence of any traces of sentiment in his system (the metaphorical heart everyone thought he lacked), he had been so sure. Until that one question on that one faithful day stirred him, turned his whole existence upside down. 'Iraq or Afghanistan?' The look on John's face that day! Sherlock couldn't remember the last time someone had looked at him with this amount of unmask astonishment and admiration.
This moment was the turning-point for both of the Holmes brothers; the atmosphere shifted, forgotten was the petty animosity that laid between them when they were in London. Here, they didn’t have to pretend to be their larger than life personas. They were just the Holmes brothers. And that was more than enough.
The physical stimulus kicked in instantly but worked against the desired effect (Data: Memory. Collected: Last evening. Content: John playing with my hair feels nice. Connotation: SHUT UP). The man resisted to let out a huff when he vowed himself to clear his hard drive of all these useless sentimental thoughts he seemed to produce.
They lay out the game plan and say some motivational stuff, before the production assistant calls it a wrap. The guys now explain to him when he’ll be spending time with whom, starting tomorrow with Blonde Guy, who wants to start renovating the flat right after. They’d be staying in a hotel for two days until it’s done.
He leaned against the dark side of the wall, hidden in shadows of a setting afternoon sun, and scratched the bumpy fabric with his fingernails frantically (Physical stimulus to ground him, bind him to reality, before he could get lost... lost somewhere... deep ... deep down in his mind). His breathes grew more and more shallow, the world was spinning even more than before, and with mild panic Sherlock registered his insides turning, right before he was sick over a rosebush. Instead of passing, the nauseous feeling intensified even more and John arrived just in time to watch him barf spectacularly for the second time.
On other nights, however, he would re-emerge again around 3 am (sometimes there were traces of a nightmare on his form, sometimes Sherlock would pick up the clues that he hadn’t been sleeping at all) and hug the detective lazily from behind. Sherlock would always tense the first second into the touch, and then relax completely. This was still new for them, and didn’t take place often (too seldom, as far as Sherlock was concerned. Although he still wasn’t sure how to ask for this kind of thing without appearing pathetic. So, he didn’t.). Yet there was something tender, and utterly familiar about the gentle pressure of John’s hands on his torso, or the warmth that radiated from him, warming the detective’s back in a soothing way. John would stay like that for some second, and Sherlock would let him; just savouring this close contact, this moment of affection and tenderness, and peace between them.
“We’ll figure it out” he whispered. If he was reassuring himself or the sleeping detective, he wasn’t so sure.
He was working himself up about the different possibilities, unable to form a rational thought. He really wanted to get away, in order to return with a clearer vision about the situation they were in.
, so he pressed his lips in a thin line, and shook his head a little. Slowly, he sunk down into a sitting position, for his knees where now shaking violently, to curl in on himself, to hide. His head was spinning from the intensity of the panic attack. A panic attack for
After a case, Sherlock usually sleeps up to 18 hours. He had mere seven so far. His face reflects extreme resentment about this fact.
John wasn't stupid (against Sherlockian believe) he knew that Sherlock normally didn't do touch. But that he had been allowed to fulfill this scarce need of encouragement, of adoration – to bring warmth to the attention-starved parts of Sherlock's psyche- was bliss in itself.
God, they could really be a family. Sherlock Holmes was a wonder, and the single greatest thing in John Watson’s life. How in the world he did deserve such a compassionate and thoughtful partner, he didn’t know. He didn’t really care much either, though. This beautiful madman was going to raise their daughter together with him.
He had always thought about Sherlock from time to time, in a way considerably different than one would usually think about one’s best friend but it isn’t until the Fab 5 cheerfully forced their way into his life that these thoughts become more refined and prominent in his mind.
The moment the phone dialed it dawned on him. He was phoning fucking Mycroft Holmes. He was about to invite Mycroft fucking Holmes over for tea to talk about feelings. Despite all the heroic devotion, it was still
“Me too” he murmured, lowly, right into the detective’s ear. Sherlock took a sharp intake of breath.
John shrugs, not really used to being asked about his feelings (it feels… nice, if not a bit… vulnerable? If that makes sense?). “A proper nursery has been on my to-do list forever. But I’ve never gotten around to it (here, both Bobby and Tan look at him with so much kindness in their eyes, that John feels really touched all of a sudden although he doesn’t really understand why). It would make her so happy. And if Rosie’s happy, I’m happy.”
He didn’t think (a rare occurrence for a genius), he rushed up those stairs before his brain even had the chance to check in on him. Something about John caused him to short-circuit like that. When his consciousness went online again, he was two steps inside of the doctor’s bedroom. A small line of blue moonlight illuminated the tossing and turning figure on the bed. Sherlock’s heart gave a painful squeeze.
It really had been a long time coming. John couldn't even blame Sherlock, the last months had been too much for them. Especially for the self-declared, certainly not so sociopathic sociopath.
Would Sherlock allow him, to carefully take him apart, bit by bit, to put him back together again in the mot sensual kind of ways? Maybe the younger man wasn’t nervous because he didn’t feel comfortable, but because he felt too comfortable, too enthusiastic, didn’t know how to take out this new experience within him? Maybe he needed John to… lead the way?
His favorite so far included learning that Sherlock had been obsessed with pirates and space, thus resulting his strong determination to become a ‘space pirate’ some day.
“I’ve been neglecting you the past days, I apologize. It wasn’t my intention” John shook his head lightly, suddenly too emotional to talk without his voice hitching. It was frankly embarrassing how sentimental this dumpster of a day had left him, but John felt like he was only a single straw away from breaking; either having a cathartic cry or take Sherlock and escape out of the country.
He was just slightly dozing off, face pressed against the softer part of John’s stomach, when his make-shift pillow moved around a little bit, fishing his phone out of his pocket. Sherlock didn’t even have to open his eyes to know it was a text message from John’s sister; probably something about the on/off marriage with her spouse, or something equally mundane. John chuckled quietly, shaking the bundle of detective attached to him in the process.
“Don’t be” Sherlock mumbled, breaking the kiss after some seconds but keeping his lips only millimetres away from John’s.
In the next second, Sherlock stands (interrupting British Guy mid-sentence) and announces his departure to the morgue.
Sherlock did, what Mycroft would recognize everywhere at any given time, his ‘pirate voice’. It hadn’t really changed much since he was a child, and hearing it now brought back some memories and emotions the politician hadn’t remembered and felt in a very long time.
John saw it before it was coming and stopped it at the very last second. With perhaps a bit more force than necessary, he held the detective at an arm’s length.
He gave a shaky smile back, letting himself be dragged towards the crime scene, passing some Yarders whose presence normally delighted him but today caused an overwhelming sensation of distress in his chest. He wasn’t ready to be among people, he realized suddenly, and yet here he was. Exposed.
He also gained a lot out of the afternoon, felt suddenly so much closer to the weirdly wonderful Holmes brothers. John felt grateful to be accepted to witness the vulnerable side of Sherlock once again; he found it strangely endearing like any other part of the utter madman- Dear God, he was totally gone on the detective. One hundred percent enamored. What a beautifully frustrating mess.
Naturally, Sherlock did it again. Or found himself almost doing it again, more precisely. The waking thing, mind you. The week went by in a blur. They didn’t really talk- not about what had happened, not at all – John retreated in the evenings relatively early, leaving Sherlock more often than not sitting alone in the dark, eating himself away on crippling self-doubt. John didn’t have another nightmare- or, more precisely, a nightmare that Sherlock witnessed- until five days later.
Not even a month ago, he didn’t get nervous at all, and now he was getting nervous for no apparent reason. He didn’t sign up for this.
Lestrade was the first to notice them, making a low sound to acknowledge their presence (not even batting an eye when he saw Rosie). John felt the attention immediately shifted to them, felt confused, questioning stares in his sides. The array of officers was downright tiny in the living room: Lestrade, Anderson, Donovan; and of course, Sherlock. John could hear two more working in the kitchen.
Once they were in semi-privacy, multiple things happened at once. John opened his mouth to let out a hearty swear about Sherlock’s dramatics, while the detective pulled him close,
The sound of the breaks interrupted John's stream of thoughts. After paying the cabbie, he unlocked the door, and tugged Sherlock to their flat; all the while with a detective sheepishly trailing behind him (and
Although he seemed eager to go to the bathroom seconds ago, John lingered a little bit longer- enjoying the domesticity and quiet after the adrenalin rush; enjoying touching his best friend’s shoulders in soothing circles, feeling the bones and warmth underneath the silky shirt; enjoying this new and intimate dynamics they found themselves in.
Now that he located the source of the doctor’s negative emotions towards him, the next step should involve finding a suitable solution. Glad he actually found a reason, the detective added ‘apology’ on top of his imaginary list. He scribbled down ‘tea’ but crossed it out again, it was too plain, it wouldn’t do. John was genuinely upset. Not all the tea in the world could fix that. Same goes for ‘Buying milk’, although this one could at least be considered out of the ordinary. Before he could monitor it, ‘Hug’ was added to the list (Well, nothing wrong with that. Hugs were considered as a appropriate possibility to cheer up an upset companion. Shut up. I don’t want to hug John, shut up!) No, too much baggage with this one.
, pardon me. Right. John Watson had lost his mind. Or Sherlock Holmes had lost his mind. Maybe they both did lose their minds. Which made a three-year-old the only sane person in the flat. Lovely… just… lovely. Was he certain he had woken up this morning? Maybe all of this was a really weird dream, it had to be, not in a million years would Sherlock… would he?  “Technically, I just did” If the grin would grow any bigger, John would have to punch it off his face. Or kiss it off his face. Preferable the second of the two options (Woah, where the fuck did that come from?!).
The night they shared wasn’t repeated; they didn’t even share a bed again the next three days, because of the case. It was just how Sherlock was, consumed by his own intellect, by the excitement, the thrill of it all. John on the other hand, was consumed by Sherlock. At times like those, where he laid in their bed and stared at the empty space beside him, he wondered if he was too fast to get invested, too fast entering some sort of game. After all, it could be a game for Sherlock, John wouldn’t know.
Mycroft was leaning comfortably against Greg, allowing himself to relax enough to give up his usual distance when it came to public displays of affection. This wasn’t public. This was family. He could be himself here, he could snuggle into his partner as much as he wanted, basking in the warmth and security of loving and being loved in return.
His life is a complicated mess, but most of the time he’s really, really happy about it. About Rosie. About Sherlock. Life is… good. For both of them. Even without Mary. This, here, he realizes, doesn’t feel nearly as anguishing as when Sherlock had been gone. Without Sherlock, John had been
Kudos, Bookmarks and Comments are very welcome! <3 Stay tuned for next time, for the infamous visit of Mycroft!
His fingers twitched against his thigh, restlessly, while he increasingly became aware of his own breathing. He tried to focus on something else; swallowed but his mouth was uncomfortably dry. There was a lump in his throat that simultaneously complicated breathing and made him feel like throwing up. The closer he came to the address, the lesser he had his panic under control; and by the time he left the cab on shaking legs, he was pretty sure everyone would notice. Maybe he should just…. Turn back to endure another torturous cab ride and-
When Rosie finally admitted defeat and was tucked in for the night, the sky was full of millions of stars.
Although he wasn’t really familiar with the protocol here, he was pretty sure that ‘clothed orgasm from kissing’ was ranking pretty low on the ‘attractive’ scale. He tried to hold on, he really did. He didn’t think John would be straightforward enough to gently trail his hand lower and lower over his hip and- It took him completely by surprise.
Tingly warmth shot through John’s body in pleasant waves. No matter how often Sherlock made sure to say it, it never ceased to touch him so profoundly.
At this, Sherlock looked up. Uncertainty was painted all over his features (so it was embarrassment, ha, call me the Sherlock Holmes of sentiment deduction!), which made him appear so much younger than the thirty something he was.  John gave him his most encouraging smile and squeezed the cold hand holding him back. Sherlock looked at him, huffed, looked at him again and then to the side.
“Do you think he’ll leave me?” The detective stared at the hunched-over form of the so-called ‘sociopath of Scotland Yard’ and asked himself once again how he somehow managed to gain the trust of this peculiar human being. Sherlock loathed talking about emotions. Yet here they were, sitting their butts flat on the hard floor and pouring their hearts out. The situation was paradox at least, if not simply ridiculous.
“You know I love you” Sherlock continued, kissing the doctor’s nose affectionately. “And I love Rosie. I need you, I need you so much, and I will probably never stop trying to make her the happiest girl in the world. She deserves it, because she’s wonderful, just like you, you’re both so wonderful and I still can’t believe that I have you in my life”
“Rosie, hand.” he tried to put some authority in his voice, but instead it sounded desperate and defeated. His hands were trembling.
Gently, but confidently, he was leaning in, closing the distance between their lips again. Sherlock made a small strangled noise of approval, which was drowned out, when the doctor started kissing him in earnest.
’. He didn’t say. It was too soon. It was too big. It would be too much. Instead, he doubled his efforts, hands roaming freely all over Sherlock’s back, and hips, and tights; kissing him breathlessly, massaging the detective’s tongue with his own- he was drunk on this moment, highly intoxicated with endorphins, his head was swimming with the force of his own arousal. He was far gone- he was really not as much in control as he’d like.
When he looked back at his friend’s face, said friend had put all his defenses up. John instantly felt bad for getting hot-tempered.
“All princesses sit in the backseat, that’s the rule.” Greg actually took his hand off his partner’s knee to high-five John for that one.
Again, John turned his head, and let the detective’s searching gaze read him. He was an open book, anyway. Where was the use in spelling his insecurities out, when Sherlock could realize them with the blink of an eye? Still, when he felt those familiar eyes set their focus so intently on him, emotions stirred up in him, consuming him, a nervous excitement flooding his body, an itch to just-
John closed his eyes, trying to calm down his suddenly racing pulse. He knew he should been angry at Greg for mingling. But… he couldn’t bring himself to be. Instead, he felt a lead lift up his chest, as his only, but most well-kept secret had been unravelled. He had been too much of a coward to address the issue himself, but now that it was out in the open… There was a small silence, awkwardly stretching between them.
John didn’t think to receive such a genuine sentiment from a man who was currently throwing his clothes around, but here he is (John wouldn’t admit it to himself, but he really needed to hear that. Insecurity was his ever-present companion these days. It is nice to hear that he at least
John Watson, being a single parent and widower of a best-friend-shooting assassin, dismissed all thoughts about romance in his life. He simply wasn’t made for it, he figured. But now, now he felt like he might explode with love for Sherlock – Sherlock, of all people! The Sherlock he wanted to be with ever since he asked that question at Barts all those years ago, the same Sherlock who had betrayed him, died, came back, watched him marry, made him so fucking angry, the same Sherlock who had kissed him. This very Sherlock had affectionate feelings towards him, the same affectionate feelings John had treasured all these years.
Greg honked twice and drummed a little melody with his fingers against the steering wheel, already lost in thoughts about campfires and marshmallows.
They fell into silence again. Greg considered following Sherlock’s advice, but found that now was not the time, nor the situation to act on his romantic fantasies. Not with a brooding detective sitting on the sleazy old leather sofa in his office, presumably one straw away from throwing a massive fit. Greg would be glad, if it was just a fit, actually. A fit he could handle. But he knew how Sherlock could be: Self-destructive to the point of a mental breakdown.
, in his own twisted way! John really didn't understand why he had gotten himself so worked up over the matter, but he did. He thought, in a fit of early morning passion, that some of Sherlock's reservation towards sentiment and some of his fears concerning his past would be healed if he shared a moment with Mycroft (as far as two emotionally frozen aristocratic assholes could share an emotional concept like "a moment"). The idea was, frankly speaking, insane. But John's gut kept demanding him to pick up his phone.
The touch was feather-light and only lasted a second; but this second was enough for John to realize three fundamental things at the exact same time:
John Watson wanted to bang his head against the wall but vowed against it (he was a father after all and had to pose as an example for his daughter). Questions swirled in his mind, questions of ‘how long’s and ‘why now’s and ‘this better not be an experiment, I swear to God’s, but they all vanished when a smile replaced the smug expression on Sherlock’s face. It was that kind of smile that made the corners of his eyes wrinkle and crooked the right end of his mouth a bit more upwards, creating a charming display of genuine happiness. It was also one manic glint in his eyes away from becoming the smile Sherlock would share with a triple homicide crime scene with no weapons to be found, but John choose to discreetly ignore the fact.
His own words still ring in his ears when he meets British Guy- Tan, he’s really getting good at their names- at their car
“Well, too bad, you’re going to, anyway” Sherlock shot his blogger a glare which, he hoped, communicated his non-consent with this situation. “Since when are you on
“So, Sherlock,” Antoni casually starts, and John almost drops his cup. He hurriedly tries to overplay his sudden flustered state (Antoni’s not buying the bullshit he’s selling, though) while wondering if Antoni somehow is a mind-reader, too.
Taken aback by the open display of gratitude, Greg stumbled a little over his own tongue. “You’re welcome, Sherlock”.
The sound of a phone startled both of them. Greg checked the message quickly, without missing the disappointed look on Sherlock’s face. ‘I’ve informed Dr. Watson of your heroic efforts. -MH’
John watched silently as Sherlock entangled himself from his brother; his face open and almost…. Shy? Mycroft’s icy mask had melted once more, and the smile he gave his brother was the most genuine John had ever seen. It was the closest to a ‘You’re forgiven’ they would ever get.
“This reminds me,” he mused, his voice quiet and warm, “of the time back in Afghanistan where we slept under the stars…”
Figuring laughter would probably wake the wrong reaction, he instead shifted a little bit, that his own erection was lightly poking a milky white tight. How had he not realized before that Sherlock wore nothing more than a tight pair of black cotton boxers, which left his strong thighs exposed in a casual, yet sensual way? How did he miss the way those boxers were now stretching telltale over a sizeable bulge in his crotch?
He didn’t know and couldn’t find the nerve to ask. It was typical for the detective to stay silent about emotional attachments, and although it didn’t bother John most of the time, it left him feeling antsy and on edge now. At some hours during the days, he would be sure about Sherlock’s mutual interest, at others he was lead to believe that this was nothing more than an interesting experiment for his mad genius. Something he would grow
Sherlock nodded, dumbly. “I want to be her legal guardian as well” he added, quietly. “That she can grow up with a real family”
The statement had caused something to shift, he could feel it fluttering in his chest, similar to the way he had felt the day before, yet so very different. The way his heart suddenly clenched made him feel…. Vulnerable? Young? He wasn’t used to register so many emotions, and those were heavy and huge and overwhelming. He found himself once again at a loss of what to do about them. But at least now, he wasn’t hyperventilating and throwing up all over the place.
Frantically, he dashed through the rooms of his mind palace, but instead of their usual order, they were wretched in utter chaos. Information was crossed out and painted over, and juggling around, while her face appeared in every room he manically opened.
“I. Don’t. Want. A. GODFORSAKEN. Coffee!” He started hissing, but worked himself into a full scream at the end.
It was sort of messy, really, and Sherlock was clumsy at best, but the determination was there- and really, John couldn’t think of a single more arousing thought than a Sherlock who was actually
He watched his daughter run towards the detective with a gaze filled with relief and doubt. Had it been a bad choice to lay their little family out in the open, for everyone to see? For everyone to judge the mistakes they might made, the mistakes that normally stayed hidden in the security of 221B Baker Street. A different feeling than anxiety sunk in John’s gut, although he couldn’t quite place what it was. All he knew was that he suddenly wished they had stayed on the stupid pavement. Passer-by’s were one thing. Colleagues were a complete different. He didn’t want anyone who he had to face every day to know how much of a flop as a father he was. Would there be sneers? Concern? Hell, pity?
Not only has he showered, oh no, he also donned on the least hideous (Sherlock’s opinion) jumper he owns.
Well. It wasn’t exactly a Shakespearean sonnet, but it was touching and sweet, in a very Sherlock-kind of way. Which, really, was more than John had ever hoped for. Emotions weren’t easy for his friend, John knew that. He struggled to understand himself, to read others, to translate them into words. He might never hear it back. But really, that was okay. Everything was going to be okay, as long as they stayed together.
strong, stubborn, trusty doctor and army captain- scrunching up his face in an expression of pure anguish and despair. His eyes behind his closed eyelids were moving rapidly. Sherlock watched helplessly how his best friend clutched the blanked so hard that his knuckles created a hard contrast to the softness of the sheets, shivering by the intensity of the nightmare he must be experiencing.                    Sherlock might have stood in the doorway until the waves subsided, unable to do anything but stare and feel his heart sink in his chest, when John wouldn’t have started to whine- actually
Mycroft had been almost certain that Sherlock had erased most of their time spent together, seeing that they didn’t dwell in memories often; and even if they did, they weren’t this detailed, this clear, this vivid. ‘Night Hawk’, had been the name of
“I should join into… saying things we usually leave unsaid” Sherlock raised his eyebrow in an attempt to appear indifferent and bored, but there was a vulnerable glimmer in his eyes. It was the same kind of vulnerability he had worn all evening of the day before.
The girl held his glare for some seconds and didn’t move an inch. Her brows were furrowed and John could tell that he was one wrong move away from more tears. Oh, how he hated when Rosie cried because of him. Or because he failed to resolve whatever trouble she was having. When he failed to help her. Realizing he didn’t think of this approach yet (he was a crappy father, thanks for noticing), he tried to place a gentle hand on his daughter’s hairline. Normally, it was Rosie’s favourite place to be touched by her father, but during her frustration, she shook his hand away forcefully.
“I made t-“ he started, and stopped when he saw the way John was looking at him. Something was different than the last time. Something was different than every other last time he saw John after a nightmare. This… something was sparkling in the doctor’s eyes: Small, and lost and…. Vulnerable. Something in those eyes caused a surge of protectiveness to wash over him.
And when John stumbled out of the shower and Sherlock sat in his chair, clad only in a wine-red robe and loose pajama pants, the doctor took him by the hands and they danced, without any music; and laughed, without any reason; until they stumbled into the bedroom.
” pass over his lips. An emotion he couldn’t quite place flashed in the taller man’s eyes before he drew John I again, to kiss him more forceful this time, as if he urged to pour all of his emotions into one single touch. Once they would be nestled together on the sofa, hours after the current moment, John would suddenly understand that his phrasing evoked the strong emotional reaction out of his partner. The last time Sherlock had heard them uttered out of John’s mouth, he was hiding in the shadows of a weeping willow while the doctor looked down at his gravestone. Ever since then, the verb “miss” was only placed in past tense, since there was no longer any need for this kind of sentiment. John didn’t need to miss Sherlock anymore, technically. Still, he couldn’t help but do, sometimes. Sherlock got easily lost between cases and experiments and being amazing; leaving John behind; soppy old John Watson to be nothing more than subtext, white noise in the background.
“I’m happy with Sherlock,” he hears himself say. “Being with him is like… being alive. When I lost him, it was like loosing myself. I didn’t know how to… go on. I’m just… it’s the best thing that has happened to me, having him back. Aside from Rosie, naturally. It’s awful to say I’m happy because my wife is dead but… but I am.”
John had always been a physical man, who needed physical closeness to uphold a certain level of emotionality. But somehow Sherlock fucking Holmes managed to be an exception even when it came to John's preferences. The little touches and hugs (not to speak of the glorious-totally-platonic spooning incident from the night before) were enough to make him more giddy than he had felt with almost all of his former girlfriends. Always something special, that damn Sherlock Holmes. What a fucking tosser.
Later, the doctor would also realize that Anderson and Donovan had probably been watching the whole thing, but right in this moment, he couldn’t care less when he heard a low whisper and a sound of someone being elbowed in the ribs.
Sherlock stopped firing deductions at an instance as soon as he noticed his little family standing sheepishly by the door. Honestly, John almost felt a tiny bit stupid. Missing his other half enough to wander in the middle of a crime scene he knew nothing about and where he was no help at all. Sentiment. Sentiment always made a fool of him. With a graceful turn, Sherlock faced John with a small twinkle in his eyes (John gave a small smile in return), and focused his attention instantly on the little girl by the doctor’s side. His demeanour changed at an instant; the superior air around him disappearing in favour of the bright smile he had solely reserved for Rosie. A reliving rush of belonging warmed John’s insides. It was almost enough to forget his insecurities. Almost.
“John, stop.” The detective cradled the doctor’s face securely in his hands and smiled a small smile.
Of course, he had picked up the signs, but thought perhaps John just felt a bit under the weather, like he had the past three days. Maybe, if he had taken down his ‘genius detective’ attitude long enough to take a look at his friend properly, he would have shortened this experience for his troubled friend. But he didn’t. The realization punched him in the gut.
John shook his head, amused. “I know, quite a bummer. He might poison my jam as a payback”, he joked. Pleased with himself, he watched the older Holmes stifle a smile, just he realized he also never shared a genuine laugh with the politician.                                                                               For calling the man ‘brother dear’ only some hours earlier on the phone, he sure as hell wasn’t familiar with him at all. It was easy to be sassy over the phone, but this felt… different.
“You’re quiet,” Tan notes, while casually sipping his Starbucks latte and driving them to a shop John isn’t familiar with.
“What doesn’t make sense, then?” John snaps irritated. How dare Sherlock be so blasé about the whole thing?! It had been a big deal for John to admit it to himself and an even bigger deal to talk to Sherlock about it. And he just treated it like it was basically old news to him. He feels tempted to slip into a small temper tantrum, when he sees the look on Sherlock’s face.
Now they were both looking at him- so genuine and kind- that John wants to punch something. He shouldn’t let all of this get so much under his skin. He was doing this to
considering it and- oh God- he had acted like a fucking teenager yesterday. That was your masterplan, sentiment? Getting drunk and making John jealous? Really?! Well, mission failed. That must have been the opposite of attractive.
John Watson, bless his heart, snorted a short laugh. It was the kind of laugh that Sherlock knew so well, the kind of laugh which was so breathtakingly intimate; it only took this little laugh to crash down everything around him.
Irritated with his overly sentimental mood, John pushed the half empty mug around on the table's surface. There was no use in predicting Sherlock's future behavior. If he knew one thing about the Holmes all together, it was that they never behaved as predicted.
Nights, where John Watson suddenly grew very quiet and doubt himself. Nobody noticed, of course, for the good doctor tried to keep his private life as private as possible. Nobody noticed, except for the man who always noticed, no one less than the world’s only consulting detective, John Watson’s best friend, Sherlock Holmes. Who choose, so very un-Sherlock-like, not to comment on the matter, wheatear out of friendliness or pity John wasn’t so sure. On these nights, the great captain, the great doctor, the proud Afghanistan survivor crumbled in the early hours of the morning in the solitude of his bedroom over the prospect of being a single-parent. He wouldn’t admit it, but he was clueless most of the time, just trying to make the very best out of the twisted situation they found themselves caught in. And he was scared. So fucking scared most of the time.
John is happy for the momentary distraction from his gloomy thoughts and spends the rest of the drive telling Tan about some of the funny stories that have happened to him and Sherlock (and Rosie) over the years. He feels at ease around the other man, a feeling that doesn’t come easy to him.
cried. At least…. Not when he knew Sherlock would notice. An unwanted memory of a graveyard on a rainy Monday afternoon forced itself into Sherlock’s mind. He stomped it down.  That was then, this is now.
In the moment the doctor’s eyes flew open, his dominant fist connected forcefully with Sherlock’s jaw. There was a sickening sound when Sherlock’s teeth crashed together, and a gush of blood splattered through his now split-open lower lip. The detective staggered backwards with the force of it, crashing into the doorframe. John was heaving, gulping in deep breaths of air, as if he’d been suffocated. Sherlock was too shocked to move for some seconds, rooted right to his cramped spot against the wood, a sharp blinding pain throbbing through his whole lower jaw.
“John” he started, voice quivering annoyingly. He cleared his throat and tried again. “You know you’re the best thing that has ever happened to me, yeah?” John’s eyes softened and his basically turned to putty in his partner’s arms.
Leave me a comment, some kudos, or a bookmark (or all, if you feel crazy) to let me know if you liked it.
John really doesn’t know how to handle all this genuine positive emotion directed his way. He really,
Contrary to Sherlockian believe, Lestrade was quite good at picking up clues: “This damn series of robberies has been driving us all nuts the past week. Sorry for keeping him so busy.”
The politician already put is icy mask back on, and was already in the middle of standing up, with a forcibly polite “It is getting rather late, I shouldn’t take up any more of your time”, when the unexpected happened. John Watson vowed to mark the day in his calendar.
It would do him some good to get out of his head for a while, the constant pondering and emotional turmoil back and forth- always between confessing his undying love for the genius or bolting the flat- was exhausting him. He felt like he missed something, something
I'm thinking about adding a bonus-chapter that is more smutty than my usual style, would you guys like to read something like that?
“I’ll wait right here” Something akin to relief flashed in those eyes, before John lowered his gaze in apparent embarrassment. Then he stood, a little shaky, a little awkward, a little lost, and staggered towards his drawer, pulled out a random boxershorts and t-shirt, and vanished in the bathroom without a word. When the shower started running, Sherlock released a breath he didn’t realize he had been holding. The next twenty minutes, he busied himself with changing John’s bedding, putting on pajama pants and a tattered shirt, and making two fresh cups of tea- always with a sense of peace surrounding him.
. John’s heartbeat was far too frantic, he could feel it thrumming through his veins uncomfortably, and his skin was clammy and cold, goosebumps surrounding the warmth of Sherlock’s grip. He was mortified.
“Does she now?” he mumbled, voice low and pleasant against John’s stomach. The doctor smirked (Sherlock could
Not just a little bit. That hurt a lot more than John thought it would. The wort part was, that Sherlock was beating him at his own game. John realized with a start that they would need to have a conversation about this as soon as Sherlock was sober again, because otherwise the uncertainty would spiral into something destructive.
After Rosie is fast asleep and Sherlock excuses himself to take a shower, John is left alone once more with his thoughts about the day. Even though the shopping trip happened hours ago, he still feels the exhilarating rush of confidence deep within him.
John can’t really describe how a game of rugby, a couple of refreshments, and snippets of conversations has managed to give him back some of the confidence he thought he had lost since the army. He feels good and capable and strong- and can’t stop telling Karamo this all the way back to the hotel.
Life decided to be kind to John's scarred heart as Mary started her first day at the clinic on the very same day. They fell in love fast. It was a lighter feeling, nothing heavy, nothing lifechanging- but it was nice, John decided. It was nice not waking up alone. It was nice to have someone listen. It was nice to have someone to talk to, who responded outside of his head. Day by day, he fought himself back to normality. Until that very evening. The bloody evening where he wanted to make his new life official and Sherlock crashed back into it.
Sherlock’s heart melted, and he beamed brightly. John laughed, because for once in his life everything was going so fucking perfect. Sherlock made everything perfect, so he grabbed him around the hips and lifted him up (earning a surprised squeak from the detective), to dance around in their still very glittery, and very
“Suppose you still don’t want to hear it?” the detective asked breathlessly, parting just enough to speak against his doctor’s lips.
Which was a stupid thing to want, an unreachable thing. People like him- eccentric freaks with questionable morals- didn’t go well together with people like John- good people. The best people. The best damn person Sherlock Holmes had ever met. Why would John want to be with
“Not cleaning, I presume,” Bobby states bluntly-and just like that, the floodgates are opened. Just like that, the Fab 5 go from ‘Hi, we’re nice and harmless’ to full on action mode.
Well. Technically that was true but… that wasn’t the point. ‘Right, the point is that you’re being a dick about something I care about, shutting the two people who constantly worry about you out’, Mind-John offered with a sly smirk.
Of course, Lestrade decided that very moment to be attentive. He fixated John with an unidentifiable gaze and the doctor tried his very best to act indifferent about it. “Tough day?”
‘Sad sight’ might be the theme of the day, John thinks to himself, when he watches his closet (still standing in Rosie’s nursery) being turned inside out. He didn’t even realize he owned this many poorly-fitting jumpers. While British Guy merrily throws everything to the floor, Blonde Guy engages him in conversation about the room. They hadn’t had the time to really make it homey, it’s practical, but not pretty. The guy (
a) Sherlock and Mycroft might be a bit out of character in this one; but bear with me. I just realized that I didn't want to write another heavy, kind of sad chapter, and proceeded to create something light and heart-warming instead.
had the potential to be so much more. To be something beautiful, something true, the only thing that mattered. Something to live for; because the only thing that mattered so much more than cases, and crimes, and deductions -Sherlock realized in that fraction of a second- was John Watson’s well-being. His happiness.
John’s heart gave a nervous flutter at the proposition, but he knew Sherlock well enough to know, that he would most likely buzz on about the case and his own brilliancy in it, make some notes about the interesting soil he found under the victim’s fingernails (yes, John actually listened to Sherlock’s never-ending litany.) and then crash, to sleep at least ten hours.
Once they arrived at Baker Street, Sherlock stayed true to his word, made a whole pot of Oolong, and turned their sofa into a blanket-nest. John was stuck with the intense emotions, when he returned from changing out of his sweated-through clothes and could do nothing more except for standing in front of the sofa and trying in earnest not be overwhelmed with the amount of affection directed towards him.
Sherlock stopped the pacing right in front of the detective. There was a wild look in his eyes, but Greg didn’t miss the spark of vulnerability underneath. Sherlock was clearly bothered more than he let on. And who would blame him? The man had zero experience when it came to relationships. And John was a good one, John was a keeper. Sherlock, apparently, was rather crap at keeping.
Even now, countless hours and failed experiments, carless dangers, almost deaths and temper tantrums later, his doctor still watched him with the gentle adoration that made Sherlock's stomach feel funny. Clients came and went, cases rushed by, experiments excited him and faded, but John stayed. John had been the one variable which never seemed to change in Sherlock’s life. Even after his 'death' the dear doctor didn't abandon him; he was reserved and angry, of course he was, but he didn't leave Sherlock alone. The silence and tension lasted a month or so, until John casually asked him what he thought about the title of his newest blog entry about their latest case ("The nightingale’s bride"- almost painfully romanticized, but I suppose it serves the clientele well, John') and gave him one of these open, warm smiles which seemed to be reserved solely for Sherlock. He tried to remain indifferent on the outside, but something in his gut twisted almost painfully when John finally looked at him again.
Mind-John silenced him with a chuckle. Things were so much easier with him. His eyes wrinkled a little at the corners when he smiled at Sherlock. ‘Stop bickering. You’ve more important things to do. The real me is just next door, angry and disappointed because you snapped at him when he was trying to help’
The next hour was filled with stories told in that quiet and warm voice, stories about unexpected beauty, stories about why people were more important than things, stories of survival and hope.
John sighed, He could try to lie to Scotland Yard’s best detective inspector / one of his closest friends, sure, but John Watson wasn’t much a man of indulging in effortless trials. Instead of thinking of some white lie, he met Greg’s eyes very briefly and gave a sheepish shrug. “I guess so” After a pause, considering he could trust Lestrade, himself a father of two: “She’s been in a mood all morning. Hard to believe if you see her now” He sighed again, a little deeper this time.
“What a fantastic deduction, you clever genius!” Sherlock flinched, feeling an unexpected pang of hurt, hearing the usually well-meant words of praise in such a sharp tone.
John wished he could just crawl in there and get him the fuck out, but he couldn't. All he could do was hold the shaking figure close to his chest and pray. He had never seen anyone cry so gut-wrenching.
A short while later, John was laying on the queen-sized hotel bed (he had the suspicion that Bobby might have something to do with the fact that they were in a single bed room), listening to Rosie’s sleepy snuffles from the crib by the window and Sherlock’s shuffling in the small bathroom. Naturally, he freaks out about this. It was kind of presumptions of them to believe that they- two grown men, best friends- wouldn’t have a problem sharing a bed.
John gave him that look, that look that said “Are you seriously such an idiot?” and pulled him into a soundful kiss.
John carefully draped the soft cover over both of them, before he instructed Sherlock to face the wall. Sherlock looked at his suspicious, but yelped with two strong army doctor arms wrapped tightly around his waist and drew him close to John's body heat.
“He was about to stab you, you mad man. What the fuck were you thinking, Sherlock?” The doctor’s stormy eyes fixated Sherlock in a steady gaze. Sherlock had trouble holding it. The emotions in this one single glance (anger, frustration, sadness) made his heart clench painfully. But he tried to play it off, being the stubborn man, he was.
Instead of saying anything, John pulled his insecure best friend into a tight hug. It was slightly awkward, with John’s come damp hand trailing over Sherlock’s back, the heavy smell of ejaculate hanging between them, and John’s straining erection poking Sherlock in the stomach. Whatever end Sherlock had for this sentence died in his throat, when he allowed himself to let himself fall in the security of his blogger’s embrace.
The mood was light and friendly, the world not so hostile and gloomy at it seemed to John hours before. A sense of anticipation and eagerness washed through him when Lestrade clapped Sherlock’s shoulder friendly and dismissed him with a good-natured: “Take your two Watsons and get outta here!”
“John?” Sherlock sounded completely worn-out, barely clinging to consciousness. The first orgasm with a partner was always intense, John still remembered, so he wasn’t really mad that Sherlock made no move to return the favor. There was more than enough time for that.
Sherlock didn’t answer immediately, instead he took a deep breath to calm his racing heart, he fumbled a folded paper out of his coat pocket (his coat thrown mindlessly over one of the kitchen chairs) and came over to his doctor.
Yet, he couldn’t stop it, he realized as he turned to his side and viewed the crumbled pillow where John had been lying hours prior with a sense of longing he couldn’t quite comprehend. What he wanted was… childish and…below his intellect but… still. He wanted it.
Greg helped John load all his things in the boot and took Rosie right out of his arms, to cuddle her.
Out of nowhere, the door to the bedroom (formerly known as ‘Sherlock’s room’. Upstairs bedroom is a nursery now. Sherlock’s room is the bedroom of the flat.  Sherlock rarely sleeps, so John gets the bed most nights. If Sherlock decides to sleep, John takes the couch.) swings open to reveal Sherlock Holmes in all of his early morning glory. His hair is ruffled, and the dressing-gown is pulled protectively around his body; his cheeks still glowing from sleep-warmth (not that John notices any of those things. Nope. Absolutely not.)
When John paused in between stories, to take a sip of tea out of the flask Greg had prepared ours ago, Sherlock didn’t waste a second and pressed their lips together. It was short, but heartfelt and conveyed enough emotion to make the doctor a little bit breathless.
. Mycroft clearly was bothered, upset and deeply guilty – of course he had observed before, but he refused to see- because it always had been so damn easy to blame all the bad things in his life on Mycroft. And Mycroft swallowed it all, obediently taking all of his hate and anger, and still came running after one single call.
Sherlock grumbled to himself, but made no further move to protest, since his favourite little human was occupying the backseat with him. They would have lovely chats, just like they always did, on this surely immensely
When the detective arrived at the table, he ignored Greg’s happy “Sherlock, mate!”, and grasped John’s hand. He proceeded to pull the doctor in a standing position, already half-way dragging him towards the exit.
In all of his thirty odd years of existing, nobody had ever doubted that there was something wrong with him. The doctors, his parents, the other kids, his fellow students, the Yarders… everybody knew that Sherlock Holmes was odd. That there was something… unusual, something strange about him. How could John tell him that it was alright to be this way? How could John not
“Told you we would figure it out” he murmured into the darkness, before he let himself be pulled to sleep; safe and sound and happy.
Maybe had been a coward, excusing himself to the shower not even ten seconds after his lips left Sherlock’s surprisingly soft ones. It wasn’t really a kiss- a romantic and significant display of deep affection and a promise for more; it was more like a tentative question, a hopeful suggestion, nothing more.
After a while of this back and forth, John decided his single bed was becoming too small for two people sleeping in it on a regular basis, so instead of retiring to his own room after going through his bedtime routine, he went to Sherlock’s room. The first time, the detective was absolutely baffled, a remark possibly already on his lips, but something in John’s easy smile and the way he cuddled closer into Sherlock’s expensive sheets, stopped him.
Greg stared at the mess for some seconds with a patient resignation, before he turned to look at the other mess in the room. Sherlock had slight down against the wall and was now seated on the floor, knees bend and face buried in his hands. He looked young, so insanely young; it was so easy to forget between the coat and the arrogant demeanour, but Sherlock was so damn insecure most of the time. For some moments, there was silence, except for Sherlock’s hurried breaths.
The first thing John noticed when he opened his eyes slowly was the absence of light in the room. His fondness of open shutters was a remnant of the long army nights under the stars. It was those nights where he learned to value the cold shimmer of moonlight and find peace in the bluish darkness of the evening sky. He never shut his shutters again, even if the hard ground of Afghanistan was nothing but a distant memory.
John fidgeted anxiously, wishing he could clench his tingly fingers, but he still held Sherlock’s hands, and he’d be dammed if he let go now. He could feel the detective’s frantic heartbeat all the way in his palms (that certainly wasn’t healthy), and the doctor part in him hysterically cackled at the thought of sending his best friend into a state of shock with a love-confession. With growing uneasiness, he watched Sherlock blink at him rapidly; and really, at this point he was halfway through the door, to get his medical equipment and the ugly orange shock blanket. After all these years, he had done it. He broke Sherlock Holmes.
Shyly, he peeked up to gauge the doctor’s reaction, but the older man was already focused back on the telly, chuckling quietly at their antics. Sherlock closed his eyes and listened to his own heart flutter in his chest, while he buried his nose a little deeper in John’s soft jumper, calming with every breath that extended the midsection of his best friend. While the telly quietly gurgled in the background, and John idly played with his hair, Sherlock allowed himself to feel safe and secure and cared for. For the first time in a long time, he dozed off in front of the telly, with a smile on his face.
He didn’t know where this strike of caretaking came from, but he was grateful for it. If he actually tried to solve this problem with logic, his head might explode. Or his heart shattered a little more. This conversation was much too big to hold it so early in the morning. They weren’t ready. Hell, they’d probably never be. But, that wasn’t the point. The only point was to give John the feeling that he was cared for. That he wouldn’t be left alone again. That Sherlock was
“Speak of the devil and he is bound to appear!” Greg almost shouted, laughing. Sherlock came straight towards them, gaze never leaving John. To say the doctor was surprised was an understatement; but after all he should have known better than to switch off his phone. Sherlock Holmes never did anything half-assed, and if he set his mind on something, he’d do everything humanly possible to get it. John felt the urge to giggle, with the ridiculousness of it all.
When the yellow “do not cross” tape of the crime scene came into sight, John felt like it welcomed him; like a colleague, an acquaintance, almost a friend. It was part of his extraordinary lifestyle as much as the eyeballs in the fridge. ‘Who am I kidding?’, John thought to himself when he paid their fare and stepped out of the cab. An ordinary life would kill the adrenaline junkie in his heart. He tried with Mary, and it had worked for some time. But during this time, emptiness creeped inside of his body and stayed; infecting all the tremendously normal aspects of everyday life. He needed the excitement, he knew. He needed the running, and the eyeballs, and the crime scenes and the insufferable git of a flatmate. He was addicted to Sherlock.
They stood and stared at each other, what a ridiculous scene; two grown men having a staring match across a messy living room. John tried very hard to fight the insecurity and embarrassment out of his expression; God knows he didn’t want Sherlock to think he was
“Up already?” John entered the picture, all friendly doctor charm and comfortable jumpers, and Sherlock just couldn’t
Careful not to startle the tense man, the doctor placed a warm hand on his friend’s back, gently tracing his t-shirt clad spine. The movement drew a low, but muffled purr from Sherlock. He was possibly glowing, John could feel the heat radiating from his skin through the thin cotton.
He couldn’t imagine his life without Sherlock. Couldn’t imagine being truly alive when Sherlock wasn’t with him. Losing Sherlock… he doesn’t even want to think about it. Not when it’s like this. When everything is so…so…
That at last, stirred the doctor to action. More forcefully than necessary, he pushed the detective’s hands away from his jumper, and made a move to entangle himself from the blanket-cocoon. Hot shame burned deep within him- here he was being open and considerate about his feelings, and Sherlock did nothing but
He silently closed his door, put on his blue dressing gown and threw himself gracefully onto the bed to think.
Sherlock raises a mere eyebrow in return, rolls his eyes at the havoc running in his home, gently lifts Rosie (who had made grabby-hands at him the moment he showed up) out of the carrier, turns on his heel, and shuts the door right in John’s face.
was missing something here. But he didn’t understand what it was, didn’t understand what John’s motifs were and his complete lack of control over this situation frustrated him immensely. He was a deductive genius, it was his whole purpose in life to understand clues. To put together variables.
The detective’s lips curved into a playful smirk. “Don’t call me that” he replied, before he jumped from the counter, and poked his partner in the rips.
The production team has waited three whole days. It’s almost a miracle at this point. A sunny day in London.
When John emerged ten minutes later in a dressing gown and his medical kit, he didn’t look Sherlock in the eyes. He continued to not look him in the eyes, while he sat the injured detective down at the kitchen table to treat his rapidly darkening bruise. They stayed silent the whole time, until John pressed a cooling-pack against the injured area. They didn’t talk when they sat down at the couch, and John turned on the TV. They didn’t talk, for two whole hours, until John stretched, stood up and mumbled something about getting ready for his day at the surgery.
for you?  That it’s a necessity- a set of dull niceties I decided to play along to- out of which I gain nothing? Do you think it means
A sense of possessiveness and pride welled over him, a feeling that had been unfamiliar to him before he had met the doctor. There was no use in fretting over other people when you just didn’t care about them. But John- god, John- he was sure he would never get over the thrill of holding the doctor’s hand or embrace him or just watch him in moments like these; in moments when he didn’t try to impress anyone, in moments when he didn’t put on a persona, in moments when he just was
John feels like a right idiot for making this guy concerned, when all he does is trying to be nice to him and improve his life. He shouldn’t make this hard, it’s a fucking blessing as it is. The flat is not even near child-proof and he should be fucking worshipping the ground where this person walks on for lifting this weight off his shoulders.
So now, when he swayed gently from side to side to the soft melody, a rare sense of…. Freedom filled him.
“Oh, shut up you!” With this heartfelt exclamation, the now very late doctor let go of the soft fabric of his favorite Sherlock dressing gown to cradle the detective’s face in his hands; to pepper every inch of creamy white skin that he could reach with light kisses. The subject of his attentions let out a surprised squeal (ha, didn’t see that coming?!), before he snuck two long arms around the doctor’s waist to pull him into a warm Sherlock hug; the kind of hug as elaborated before was the best kind of hugs. John was absolutely content to stay like this for the rest of eternity, but alas, that’s not the way the universe had planned for him today. His phone vibrated angrily in his coat pocket, which was currently encircled by a Sherlockian underarm. “It’s Sarah, she’s not very pleased that you’re about to miss your first appointment of the day” John groaned and buried his face in the crook of Sherlock’s neck. He inhaled the musquy, clean,
“Stop, I’m fairly disgusting right now” he laughed lightly, but Sherlock just smiled and hugged him even tighter for emphasis.
again; so loving, that it made John’s heart throb forcefully. Sherlock didn’t love him. That wasn’t possible.
Mycroft drew a shaky hand through his auburn hair. “I’m sorry” the heartfelt exclamation was so unexpected in phrasing and intonation, that Sherlock forgot to play his usual self for a moment. Instead, he sat upright, slightly gaping at his brother.
- not even John. John, who had seen it all pretty much on that night carefully buried in the darkest corners of his mind-palace. A corner he never visited voluntarily; but where his mind sometimes took him in the deceiving safety of sleep (But he was fine, thank you very much. Nightmares? Sherlock Holmes doesn’t do nightmares, don't be ridiculous, John).
And suddenly, John felt very very bad. Sherlock wasn’t a man of emotions or affection, but he tried, for John’s sake. And now, he brought himself to initiate the most intimate contact they had shared (so far), not because he felt himself pressured under a social circumstance but because he
“Of course, I do,” he murmured, voice softer and gentler than Mycroft had directed towards him in a very,
). He wanted to cry even more because he felt so safe in John's arms. The feelings which overcame in this moment were probably the strongest he ever witnessed since his childhood. Strangely enough, he felt a little bit like a child again when he hid in his best friend's embrace. The soothing touch relaxed him (Normally, the idea of other people touching him nothing but repelled him, unless these other people were John. John was the expectation for everything).
answered because he was a bloody smart genius who had expanded his “nature” mind-palace wing for the occasion).
“I meant to ask you all week but didn’t work up the courage to do so” John spoke softly, timidly, a little shy perhaps. “I’d be very happy if you’d be my plus one”
Instead of answering, Mycroft smiled, brighter than he had smiled all day (hell, probably all week) and splashed some water in Sherlock’s direction.
the outdoors. Spending time in the woods with his favourite people was about the best thing he could imagine doing with his free weekend.
He watched the slender chest rise and fall in a clam rhythm and the usually tense features of Sherlock's face softened. The man looked younger this way, almost innocent. What a strange thought, to describe Sherlock Holmes, of all people, with the attribute "innocent". But then again, in his own way he was, wasn't he?
At that exclamation, John looked up in surprise, self-deprivation forgotten for a second. He stared flabbergasted, until an involuntary giggle slipped through his lips. “Sorry. It’s just, I thought I’d never see the day where a posh bastard like you swears” He covered his mouth, still smiling despite himself.
Who was he kidding, he would -undoubtedly! - loose John at some point, because nobody in his right mind would want any kind of deeper
, time to drag your head out of the gutter, John Watson). Of course, John had noticed all these details from the start (He wasn’t blind, dammit), but still… it’s a whole different level if the most handsome genius in London was potentially interested in… what? A relationship? Friendship plus?  John couldn’t be arsed to care, as long as Sherlock wanted
Sherlock’s heart gave a cold squeeze when he realized that maybe this was the reason John didn’t want to stay in with him, tried to hide their relationship. He shuddered involuntarily, and his vision blurred for a moment. He should be used to be deceived like this by now.
“Don’t give me that look, you always use up all the warm water” Relived that John didn’t actually get it (although he came pretty damn close), Sherlock forced a tight smile on his lips.
He wasn’t running away- you only run away from things you’re uncomfortable with. And he wasn’t. He loved it,
Perhaps he still felt daring when he entered Sherlock’s/their bedroom 15 minutes later. He had expected to just grab his dressing gown (he forgot to take it with his pajamas to the bathroom) and persuade Sherlock to join him for an early night (to maybe… continue what he had started. Or never mention it again).
“John” he winced at the vulnerability in his own voice. “I…I don’t understand” he admitted, helplessly.
And now, as he climbs into bed and buries himself deep in the covers, his back turned to Sherlock in an attempt to hide all of his sudden emotions from his friend’s deducting glance; now
“I won’t do it again, I promise!” the detective interrupted him loudly, desperation written all over his face. John normally would second-guess the honesty of this statement; Sherlock was an extraordinary liar, so much so that he didn’t even realize he made a promise he couldn’t keep. But something was… different about this exclamation. Something big and complex, something which made John’s heart swell with fondness for the man in his arms.
“That’s the common response” John carded his fingers through the mahogany curls, and there was a small silence for some minutes.
Mary wasn’t… Mary hadn’t been easy, but during those moments he missed her so dearly, and it felt so sincere. Although being mysterious and not at all what she seemed, she had been a wonderful friend. A silent reassurance at his quivering side in times of doubt. He had loved her, once, and he learned to love her again, but differently.  The reality of a life, a life of their family without her, crashed down on him with full force and shook him violently with silent sobs. John hated himself for this weakness, for feelings so raw, so alone- but he couldn’t help it. This wasn’t the way anything of this should play out, this just wasn’t right- Rosie deserved parents, she deserved a mother, and not a father who drowned himself in self-pity as soon as he wasted thoughts about her future. But shit, why did he have to fight alone? John Watson didn’t want to fight alone anymore, not this battle. And, miraculously (actually no, the man wasn’t a genius observer for nothing), a gentle presence would pick up his violin at four in the morning and play a soothing tune, a tune so familiar, so safe, so home, so… Sherlock, that John Watson suddenly didn’t feel alone anymore. For as long as they were together, wrapped in the security of the flat in 221B Backer Street, they’d figure it out. They always did in the end.
“I’m not giving you cigarettes, Sherlock” The young man gave him what supposedly was his ‘intimidating’ glare, but his otherwise rather pitiful posture destroyed the effect he hoped to create. He just looked a little lost, not at all like ‘I am smarter than anyone in this building’ Sherlock Holmes. He had more resemblance of the ‘I really cannot cope with the world right now, please just give me my damn drugs; please just let me escape’ version. Greg pushed these thoughts back in the dark corner of his mind where they belonged and stood up with a heavy sigh.
“I know, Sherlock” The detective closed his mouth with a click. “I know” John continued, voice small and breathy, and… sad. “what it was all about. I know you had to do it. And I’m… I’m grateful you did it, but… God I sound like such an asshole, don’t I? You sacrificed yourself for our safety, for
Once the intensity had faded a little, his trail of though shifted back to Sherlock. How the hell would Sherlock react if no other than the brother he loved to hate would appear on their doorstep; not out of pure spite but because John asked him to? He would most certainly feel betrayed. And sulk the whole day afterwards.
“I’m sorry I hurt you”.  Sherlock’s voice was muffled by the thick material of his brother’s expensive overcoat, but the statement hung in the air with all its gravity nonetheless. Hesitantly, the government official placed his hands on his brother’s bony shoulder blades. Something about their position made Sherlock seem so… small.
The chaos was over. The rooms were no longer littered with dreadful memories and- oh! There was John's room! Open, filled with light and security Sherlock had never known before. It was over.
“That women yesterday” his hands were trembling lightly. “The nurse, with the teeth gap and the strong Irish accent, she had given you a paper- her number, no doubt. And I assumed, falsely as I now realize, that the whole sharing a bed, and kissing and….sexual thing would somehow create an exclusive bond between us, so the prospect of you flirting with her was… it did….” He groaned again, for he was unable to find words that did not make him sound like the inexperienced idiot that he
After a small amount of time was spend in this fashion- John stubbornly ignoring Sherlock, and Sherlock regarding him with an unreadable, searching look- the commercial break seemed to break the spell between them.
“He’s been married for ages, took you long enough to figure it out” rumbled a low voice right next to John’s ear. The doctor jumped at the sudden appearance of his best friend (always as quiet as a cat), and turned himself just in time to watch Sherlock steal his scone and take a hearty bite.
John let out a quiet ‘uff’ sound that was mostly for show, before he closed his arms securely around his daughter. He blinked up at his partner drowsily, and snorted when he realized the condition the Holmes brothers were in.
The first time Sherlock noticed it, he tried to ignore it.  He should be used to it, by now. John had pretty violent episodes of night terrors in the first year that they’d known each other, caused by his PTSD. Although he never talked about it, Sherlock could tell it was wearing him thin, and at the same time embarrassing him deeply. Still, they happened so frequently, that the flatmates even developed a routine to deal with them. Sherlock would play Vivaldi’s “Summer” (John’s favorite) on his violin at the first sighs of a nightmare (which was, more often than not, the muffled distressed noises travelling down the stairs), steadily increasing the volume, until the noises upstairs came to a stop. Then, he’d prepare two cups of tea, place them on the coffee table, and wait. John would emerge some minutes later, looking like death. He’d smile to thank Sherlock for the tea, but he wouldn’t speak. He’d plop down on the couch beside Sherlock, turn on the TV. They’d watch some crap shows about cars or teenage pregnancies in silence, until John drifted off to sleep again. Of course, the doctor never acknowledged it in the morning; and Sherlock would be dammed if he tried to touch the subject.
Panicking slightly, John doubled his efforts. They were around two blocks away from Baker Street. He was eager to get to the safety of their flat, away from the glares. He crouched down on Rosie’s eyelevel and settled for his best ‘no nonsense’ glare. It worked on Sherlock, after all.
"Sherlock?" John asked, while eyeing a especially cheeky curl on the detective's forehead. "You don't have to answer, but ... it is...it would be important that you're honest with me. Can you do that for me, Sherlock?" A small nod against his skin. John took a deep breath before he addressed the elephant in the room: "The crime scene trigged some memories, right? It was about
The detective finally took his own hands away from his eyes and regarded his doctor with an unreadable gaze. Calculating. Deducing. Hoping, perhaps.
“There are some highlights,” John jokes to deflate the empty feeling he gets in his chest when all the awful stuff that has happened in the last years catches up with him. Being shot and PTSD, loosing Sherlock and loosing Mary and somehow loosing himself along the way.
So now, when he stood there and made it seem like it was the easiest thing in the world to get over Sherlock, John finally snapped. It didn’t happen as one would suppose from a passionate man like John Watson. There was no yelling, or punches, or tears. Just a clenched jaw and one, icy comment: “Stay away from me for the rest of the evening”
“Do you mind if I take the first shower? I feel disgusting” John continued in the same, light tone- like something significant hadn’t just shifted between them, like this was supposed to be
"I'll be right upstairs if you need anything" John assured him, before he turned around, in his mind already between his soft sheets (hell, this day had really exhausted him. He was getting old).
Sherlock, however, wanted to bang his head against the window violently. He was used to this intense emotions in the safe space of his (their?) bedroom or hidden away in his mind-palace, but having them now out in the open
‘Not exactly subtle there’ John thought to himself, smiling slightly about this crazy situation they were in. Everything about them was sort of a beautiful mess; nothing had been easy, nothing had been planned; they were broken, broken for different reasons- but this thing between them was
Okay, maybe that wasn’t that witty. Or hilarious. But it did the trick of overplaying Sherlock’s increased heartrate. John always saw, he didn’t observe. Surely, he wouldn’t observe this time, as well.
So now, as he stood on the pavement and tried desperately to reason with his very uncooperative daughter, he felt the very opposite of assured. He felt the very opposite of proud and strong and badass Captain John Hamish Watson – doctor, ex-soldier, crime fighter, his daughter’s superhero. Instead, he felt as if all the people walking by judged this poor excuse of a father they saw. A pretty pathetic guy who had ‘overextension’ written all over his forehead. He couldn’t even handle calming his Rosie’s mood when she was a mere toddler. Did he seriously think at times that he passed as a decent father?
Sherlock stared down at the small box in his lap, which contained a nicely decorated cupcake. It was richly covered with raspberry frosting and smelled sinfully good.
Greg clasped John’s shoulder in a friendly manner while he sat down next to him. “This is going to be great, I’m sure!”
are extraordinary. I’m just ordinary. I get scared that I won’t be ... able to keep up with you. That you’ll leave me” The ‘again’ hung between them in the air. It didn’t need to be addressed. They both knew it was there.
John only nodded, and hoped Sherlock would be able to put the pieces together on his own and didn’t make him actually voice them. The idea of talking about his insecurities and anxiety somehow made him awfully embarrassed. Although Sherlock was his partner, John still didn’t feel fully comfortable to share his vulnerability with him. He was used to being tough and strong, stripping the layers of control and authority off to lay all his fears bare did impress him. It always took a lot, but when he did, after he shared a part of himself he strongly disliked, he always ended up feeling more connected to the younger man. Still, it didn’t mean that this trust came easy.
But in the enclosed space of the cab, his senses were heightened. The strong smell of the other man’s sweat – earthy, and musquy, and John – reached his nostrils, and he really shouldn’t find the sensation in any way pleasant, but he
‘And I’m thankful, too. It’s good to know he has a trusted companion on Danger nights. -MH’ However the politician knew about the whole situation was beyond Greg, but he long ago stopped questioning the ways of the Holmes brothers. They simply knew everything, except for how to interact with other human beings.
At this, he crumbled in on himself again, hugging his own knees, making himself as small as possible. Hiding.
"Sherlock" he tried again when his friend didn't react right away. He sat a bit more upright (Sherlock tightened his grip on John's favorite jumper) and proceeded to stand up. The world's only consulting detective looked up at him (Since it obviously didn't occur to the self-proclaimed genius that he might needed to stand up as well in order for this to work) through a tousle of wild curls and gave him an utterly lost look, while still fisting the poor Jumper for his dear life. Gently, as gently as he could, John entangled his friend's grip on the fabric and took the large hands of a scientist, of a violinist, of a scholar in his smaller, sturdy, worker hands. He pulled until the tall body came to a wobbly stand.
As he typed agonizingly slow (John and technological advances- a never-ending journey of discovery), Sherlock started contemplation about the domesticity of the situation they found themselves in. It was oddly…. nice. He wouldn’t mind integrating this in their everyday lifes. Which was strange. Sherlock Holmes wasn’t fond of…. people. Of…affection. Of…touching in general.
BUT Sherlock wrapped up a case only the night before and John has been navigating between early shifts, helping Sherlock as best as he could, and being a dad; so the flat isn’t really cluttered (alright. The
Yet…so vulnerable. John had to remind himself of the significance of this moments between them- they were about to change
Sherlock wasn’t an idiot. He knew hugs and confessions wouldn’t keep the nightmares away instantly. He knew it would probably take much time for John to trust him again. He knew they had many obstacles to overcome, and he knew they had demons they need to fight. He knew John might never feel the same way he did, hell he didn’t even know if John would want this close contact to continue. He knew nothing, basically, only that John was vulnerable right now, and that he had probably never been more in love with him.
“You’re not awful for being happy. You’re allowed to live,” Antoni speaks gently, his own voice sounding a little bit wet. John’s glad they don’t have any of this on camera. It feels much too personal, much too intimate to be broadcasted all over the internet.
It was nothing either of them felt the need to discuss, it just sort of happened. At first, the detective just quietly slipped into John’s bed when he thought the doctor was fast asleep, to curl up behind him, sometimes fisting his hand in John’s shirt. They doctor pretended not to notice, pretended to be asleep (although he was 98% sure Sherlock knew that he was just faking it), pretended that his heart wasn’t beating in his throat every time they shared some casual touches.
While he was endeared by Sherlock and his fascination with things; he was buzzing to clear his head, to get some distance, just to look at them in a different perspective. All his thoughts circled around their relationship, around their emotions, around the chaos of it all- coming to no point whatsoever.
