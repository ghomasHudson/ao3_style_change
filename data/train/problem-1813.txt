“What makes you so sure?” Sherlock asked as the pair rounded a corner onto a street, whose kerb was lined with cars, and he knew they were getting close.
John looked at Sherlock, then at Lestrade, then back at Sherlock, and then to the empty space at his side, as if expecting another Watson with a PhD to materialise. “Me?” he asked after a moment, pointing at his own chest.
to the sights of London acting as a backdrop for the masterpiece that was his partner in life and in crime.
John’s world went quiet, his focus narrowing to his index finger wrapping around the cool metal of his trigger. He let out a slow breath, watching and waiting until Matvei’s forefinger gave the barest twitch against the trigger before John pulled back on his own.
“Do you have anything to say to other university students who feel their safety is threatened in wake of Laura’s death?”
When John didn’t respond straight away, Sherlock averted his gaze, the skin on his cheeks going pink.
John followed as quietly as he could, rolling the rubber soles of his trainers from heel to toe with each step across the gravel to keep from making too much noise. His gun was gripped in both hands as he rounded the corner, and his eyes were immediately drawn to a metal ladder with chipped blue paint lying on its side, leaning up against the wall. The doctor came to stand next to Sherlock, who was looming next to a large, industrial, metal rubbish bin that was pressed against the wall under a high window. One of the hinged plastic lids was propped open with what looked to be scrap metal, broken plastic, and bits of rusty scaffolding. Sherlock was laying his gloved hands – when had he put gloves on? – on the closed lid, appearing to gauge its sturdiness. “Need a boost?” John asked on a breath, tucking his gun back into the waistband of his jeans and lacing the fingers of both hands together, palm up, before half-kneeling beside Sherlock. The man looked at him with an expression of surprise before giving a smile of gratitude, wordlessly accepting the offer with a silent nod. The doctor braced himself as a gloved, long-fingered hand gently gripped his shoulder and one black shoe that probably cost more than his fucking rent slotted neatly into the platform his palms provided, and with one smooth heave, Sherlock was on top of the bin, steadying himself with one hand against the metal wall of the warehouse, and John was standing and brushing little bits of gravel from his hands.
"And, what, he repays you in dry-cleaning services for the time you stopped people stealing his ham-hocks?" John asked, smile quirking his lips.
Their footsteps slowed as they came to stand before the monument; there were a few people around, milling about, chatting near the railing at the edge of the pavement overlooking the river, pausing on their bikes to take in the sights, sitting on benches. Sherlock gazed up the short set of stairs to where a gilt-bronze statue immortalized Buddha.
“I said,” John began again, and Sherlock didn’t dare open his eyes for fear the sight of the fond smile he could assuredly hear in the older man’s words would send him into a swoon, “you’re
“Not a chance-” He stopped in his tracks, eyes opening a fraction wider as one of her green-clawed hands fisted the lapel of his blazer.
The comment had her rolling her eyes, though her cheeks did tinge the slightest shade of pink as she came forward, hips swinging suggestively and heels clacking against the hardwood floor. “Ah-ah-ah, you don’t get to come crawling back now, Johnny Boy,” she teased, and brushed past him to grab the finishing touch to her costume - a stereotypical nurse’s cap of white with a centred red cross.
Greg nodded, and grinned. “Yeah, she’s somewhere around here; she’s Little Red Riding Hood, if that helps you find her. I didn’t want to dress up as a wolf in gran’s fucking nighty, so I’m just a werewolf tonight,” he explained, gesturing to himself. “But I’m not sure where she is. I’ve been a bit busy trying to keep people from snorting lines in the bathroom and breaking into the rooms upstairs to shag,” he huffed with a hefty roll of his eyes, and John grimaced.
John’s smile was infuriating. “I actually have tomorrow off. And I’ll email my patients. Sometimes therapists have emergencies, too. There are other therapists, and I can do make-up appointments; or even Skype calls. Don’t worry about my schedule. That’s for me to fret over.”
John didn’t even acknowledge the biting comment regarding his own therapist. “Brilliant,” he whispered, before he’d even realised he’d moved his lips to speak.
“What do you like? Strong, sweet, dry…? There’s all sorts of stuff here,” the blond said, rummaging through the selection of bottles.
Toast eaten and coffee quaffed, John stood from his chair, holding his hand out for Sherlock’s dishes (he rolled his eyes at the toast crusts left behind on the on the plate - the picky git) and walked them to the sink. “I have to take a shower,” he announced, and turned to find Sherlock slowly rising from his chair with a devious grin. “What?” John asked, freezing with his hands half in the sink, a look of caution on his face.
“Hmm.” Victor hummed, raising one hand to stroke at his own chin in an over-dramatic display of pondering. “Price of admission today… I’ll take you on your knees for ten minutes, how’s that sound?” His grin made Sherlock want to gag.
He did have to let go of Sherlock’s hand, though, however reluctantly, when they arrived at John’s flat; he quickly paid the cab driver and left a decent tip before he led the way out of the taxi, up the sidewalk, and through the front door. They walked in silence up the stairs and down the hallway, and wordlessly entered John’s flat. The quiet would have been odd, except John knew the precise reason for it; they were both exhausted. Sherlock wasn’t even a week sober, was running on little food and less sleep than John would like, and had had a gun pointed at his head on two separate occasions in one night. John himself could feel his eyelids drooping; he was sore, physically and mentally drained, concussed, and eager for a reprieve.
“So,” Sherlock rejoined, and John’s eyes widened momentarily, looking almost surprised at the sound of his voice, but the expression was reigned in as the other man cleared his throat.
Sherlock knew was beyond John, but it was clear that Sherlock knew - and when he met the man’s eyes again, he could tell that Sherlock knew that
of arousal that I am not currently experiencing,” he said, bluntly but carefully, “but that’s certainly a closer answer than embarrassment or discomfort.” He paused a moment, opening his eyes to look at the ceiling. “Well, actually, embarrassment likely plays a role, no matter how unfounded.” He’d meant to throw John a wry sort of grin, but when he looked at the doctor again, John was frozen, eyes wide and unblinking with shock, cheeks ruddy, and Sherlock’s brow furrowed in slight worry. “What’s wrong?”
Cringing inwardly and outwardly, John took a deep breath, squared his shoulders, and turned around. He had his eyes shut for the first few moments, anticipating the sounds of disgust, but after a few moments of quiet, he dared to open his eyes. The look he was met with wasn’t one of repulsion, but one of fascination. And it wasn’t just that - swimming in Sherlock’s eyes were layers of emotion; awe, curiosity, revelation, and a hint of sadness. John felt impossibly small under the focus of that gaze.
John could practically see the slitted serpent’s tongue slithering out of this git’s mouth. “Who are you?”
A noise of desperation sounded from the back of Sherlock’s throat, high-pitched and needy, his hands grasping at John’s shoulders, searching for purchase as John’s mouth moved relentlessly against his own, lips parting to slide a wet tongue over the crease of Sherlock’s. The brunette let out a whimper, but it turned into a yelp when John captured his lips in another bruising kiss. Despite himself, Sherlock lifted his chin to break the kiss, heaving a laboured breath and wincing at the dark ceiling. “Jo-
John successfully made it past the crime scene tape without incident, and made his way slowly back to the main road. He shouldn’t have been disappointed when he didn't see Sherlock there. But somehow, his chest grew heavy with despondency all the same.
The titles were seared into the insides of Sherlock’s eyelids from looking at them so much where he’d written them in his notepad, and he ruminated over what leads they might bring to light (that he hadn’t already tracked down and discarded). He sat silently at the window seat in his grand-mère’s salon and looked out the large window at the lavender fields, plants toussled lightly by a playful breeze, puzzling over what evidence he was missing, when a nudge at his arm brought him out of his reverie.
He was already dressed for the day, in a dark green jumper and his jeans, so it only took a minute more to get ready. He slipped on his trainers and watch before taking his jacket (now thankfully dry) from its place on the hooks by the door alongside Sherlock’s. Before he opened his door, he fingered Sherlock’s coat pockets for a set of keys, which he found with little effort, and put them in his jacket pocket to join his own. After one last check to be sure he had his wallet and mobile, he opened the door to his flat and turned the lock on the inside. “Alright, I’ll be back,” he called behind him. “Call me if you need anything, yeah?”
surprisingly - after scanning all of the articles, while there was no explicit mention of Sherlock’s name, in each article, without fail, there was a mention of an “anonymous tipper.” Sometimes it was in the middle of a paragraph, tying right into the investigation, and other times it was an offhand mention in small, italic font in a brief acknowledgements section at the end of the article, where no one would see it. John grew frustrated as he wondered just why no one so much as inquired as to the identity of this “anonymous tipper,” skimming the comments sections in each of the articles to check and see if a member of the public came forward to claim responsibility for the tips themselves; but he came to the realisation soon enough that the anonymous tip, obviously, was not the main focus.
John thought as objectively as possible about a hypothetical scenario where any of his other patients had somehow wound up in his flat in Sherlock’s place. Frustratingly enough, in every other made-up scenario, John saw himself turning his patients away; or, at the very least, phoning the authorities, or someone better equipped to handle people who potentially posed a very real threat to themselves. In none of the posed hypothetical instances did John see himself dressing a patient in his own clothes and burying his fingers in their hair. His fingers twitched around two sets of keys in one pocket as he remembered the phantom sensation of soft, thick curls.
As an afterthought, John jammed his hand into his pocket to make sure his own phone was silenced. Didn’t need the same thing happening to him.
But a look on Sherlock’s face out of the corner of his eye stopped him. The man looked almost crestfallen, even as he offered a small “see you” in response. John turned back to face Sherlock fully. The brunette didn’t move, only stared back, looking between John’s eyes, a hopeful look blossoming in his own silver irises.
John watched him go with a sigh, and then turned back to Lestrade, who was dismissing the other police officer. Once the other had left, leaving the two barely-acquainted men alone by the car, Lestrade crossed his arms and looked at John.
until his eyes were level with Sherlock’s navel, but the taller man didn’t get to appreciate the sight of mischievous blue eyes shining at him from such a lovely vantage point for long before John was working his way back to standing, his hands leaving a searing trail of heat wherever they fell, up Sherlock’s thighs and over his hips to fall once again at his waist.
The door closed behind him and he didn’t bother to lock it. The squeak of his wet shoes against cheap linoleum and then hardwood joined the din of his laboured breathing and his racing heart to negate the deafening silence of the room. The sporadic lighting that had tortured him outside contrasted greatly with the lighting inside the small room; there was a lamp on a small table by the bed in the corner of the room which filled the room with a soft light that enveloped Sherlock in a blanket of warmth. Though the light was still far too many colours and he swore he could
“Okay.” He tried his best to relax in his seat without letting his guard down; this was the second time in as many days that John had been without his gun in a situation that bloody well merited his having a fucking gun. He made a silent pact with himself to carry it with him from this point out, always. Not that it’d help him now, he thought dismally as the car rounded a corner onto a less-populated road. A few minutes of tapping his foot and monitoring his own breathing went by before he decided to fill the silence with something other than the woman’s fingernails tapping at her phone screen, and the rain tapping at their windows. “So,” he tried, “what’s your name?”
He added the toiletries to the bag and zipped the duffel closed, before shouldering it with a grunt. Thankfully, it was small enough to likely not be a nuisance once he got to Tesco. Bag packed and mind relatively distracted from the subject of the contents of Sherlock’s pants drawer, John made his way back through the labyrinth of dirty clothes and scattered books and papers to the kitchen, where, begrudgingly, he snatched the near-empty pack of cigarettes and the lighter off of the table. Because if he was going to make Sherlock suffer through withdrawal, he’d give the man a brief respite. And who could say, maybe John would end up needing them just as much at some point.
“What?” John asked, looking with wide eyes between Sherlock and the crime scene, now observing the bustle behind the red tape like a small child would, with no small amount of fascination and intrigue.
However pleasant and intriguing the concept, Sherlock pushed his thoughts aside for the time being, and his focus narrowed on the structure that loomed before them in the distance; painted white with intricate architecture and a black roof of a distinct style.
Before John realised what he was doing, he found himself reaching for a syringe and snapping the needle off of the end, and then reaching for another and giving it the same treatment, before tossing them into the rubbish bin by the sink. In his mind, he justified his actions by telling himself it wouldn’t do Sherlock any good to work with him through his detox, only to put him back in an environment with drug paraphernalia strewn about and easily accessed. After a few minutes, a neat accumulation of needles and syringes and plastic baggies had found their way into the bin, and John sighed tiredly to himself as he made his way into the small, adjoining bedroom.
He doesn’t really know what any of this means. But he’s brimming with happiness. And he decides, as he relaxes fully into the mattress and into John’s warm embrace, that he’s okay with not knowing tonight. Maybe tomorrow, he thinks, they’ll talk. They’ll wake up in each other’s arms, and John will insist they talk about it, because that’s just something that John would do. Where they go from there has yet to be known.
Sherlock didn’t know. He knew that John Watson looked ordinary and was anything but. He knew that John Watson was the human embodiment of juxtaposition. He knew that John Watson was a puzzle. But he
A few quick finishing touches for Mary’s makeup and a final application of fake blood to John’s neck and uniform, as well as a little bit of product to coax his hair into an artful state of disarray, and the pair grabbed their phones and wallets before making their way out the door.
And John, not one to back down, took the dare. “I reckon it doesn’t. Intoxicants don’t- they don’t do anything to
But the minutes ticked on and the bell over the front door remained drearily unrung, and John finally decided he couldn’t stall any longer lest he risk falling asleep on the tube ride back to his flat. With a heavy sigh, he picked himself up out of his chair, hissing in mild pain as he put a little too much pressure on his leg - Sherlock had been right, he did have a limp, and it was, indeed, psychosomatic, according to his therapists. After leaning on his desk a few moments to regain his bearings, he packed away his papers into their appropriate file folders, placing them neatly in his desk drawers, slid his laptop into its bag, put on his jacket, and shouldered his messenger bag before making his way out and locking up the office behind him.
Rosie lets out a tremulous breath that puffs softly against his neck, and he holds her close as he purses his lips in thought.
, he remembered with a grin from their impromptu coffee-date-turned-investigation at the coffee shop over a month ago. Had it really been that long since then? It felt like just yesterday; but in another sense, it felt like years had passed. The thought was evicted from John’s head when Sherlock spoke.
” Sherlock bit out sardonically. “As if that’s some grandiose accomplishment. They’re imbeciles, the lot of them.”
“So tonight we just need to take what we picked up from this hit and take it to the river?” one asked, and it was met with a grunt.
“John,” he addressed, the warm, smooth baritone curling around John’s name like the most luxurious pashmina scarf. “I don’t wish to come across as callous, but… for the next couple of hours, or however long it takes us to get anywhere on this case, I’d like to put our personal relationship at the back of my mind. I cannot have my focus clouded by-“
- and was now making a cut in the layers. The slit-throat effect was finally beginning to take shape.
His charm was certainly practised, likely something he’d perfected in university or in the army to tempt and lure young women to his bed.
A lavish costume that was black to match Irene’s lipstick (and her soul, Sherlock thought sardonically) was laid out neatly over the maroon duvet, and Sherlock had to force himself not to roll his eyes yet again at the absurdity of it all.
Leaving the telly on to create background noise, John retrieved his phone from his desk and returned to his bed, sitting down and pulling up the news website and navigating to the story on Laura Tanning and her death. In addition to the information they’d provided on the news story he’d just watched, the report online included time and cause of death, information about why she was by Kew Gardens, her relationship with her killer, and a list of forensics experts and detectives who had worked on the case, including interviews from other members of New Scotland Yard’s police force: Thallia Williams, Phillip Anderson, Tobias Gregson, Sally Donovan, Gregory Lestrade, Charles Dimmock… No mention of Sherlock. A whole list of people being thanked for their contribution to the case , no matter how small - even a groundskeeper at Kew Gardens was thanked for his time in the article - and yet, not one mention of Sherlock’s name.
John smiled, strangely enamoured. “See you,” he said back, voice perhaps a touch too soft for a casual farewell, and he tucked himself the rest of the way into the cab as Sherlock gave a light-tipped smile and shut the door. The doctor watched as the folds of Sherlock’s long, sweeping coat caught a sudden gust of mild wind as he turned away, sending the dark fabric fluttering out behind him in the breeze like a dark cape.
John’s nose wasn’t broken. He was thankful for that, but he still managed to soil six tissues with blood whilst in the back of the ambulance, waiting for the bleeding to subside. His concussion was diagnosed (though he didn’t need anyone else to tell him he had one) after he’d squinted and winced as lights were shone in his eyes and he was asked all of the rudimentary, obvious questions. Doctors really were the worst patients.
worst patients, John thought as he watched Sherlock grouse and sneer at each hand that prodded at him, loudly declaring that he
Except, this time, when he looked at it and thought of smooth metal in his hand, cool to the touch, the phantom sensation of the same cool metal against his palate, or against his temple, or under his chin, vibrating with the trembling of his hand, was notably absent. He found himself walking across the hardwood floor of his flat before he fully realised it, the door falling closed behind him with a soft ‘click’ as he strode evenly to stand next to his bed. One hand reached out to slowly pull open the small drawer of the nightstand, before reaching into the shadowed compartment, and his fingers wrapped firmly around a familiar grip.
“Well that makes two of us, then,” John said, his smile bordering on salacious. Sherlock’s throat bobbed with a swallow, and his eyes watched the pink tip of John’s tongue dart out from between his lips to moisten them in a quick motion before he asked: “Can I get you a drink?”
Greg’s entire body sagged with exasperation and his annoyance was tangible in his voice when he spoke. “Sherlock,” he groaned, sounding exhausted as he turned to look pleadingly at the younger man. “Please. I made you a deal; if you do this, I won’t go telling your brother.”
It couldn’t be entirely blamed on the alcohol, the fact that Sherlock’s core body temperature seemed to skyrocket when he was forced to stand mere inches from the rugby player with sandy blond hair, but it certainly contributed.
“So,” John began as he drew up to walk by Sherlock’s side. “We’re just going to… hide out across the street from this place, then?”
he said, and John was stuck between gawking at Sherlock’s sudden enthusiasm, and the fact that said enthusiasm was brought about by someone’s suicide - not to mention it being likened to a blessed fucking holiday.
“You’re taking up the entire bed. And you’re not even under the coverlet,” Sherlock said, his voice heavily laced with fondness.
Something in John’s eyes shifted at the question. “Are you?” he asked cautiously in return, and Sherlock could hardly breathe. He looked away.
He made his way into the kitchen, finding an electric kettle and setting it up to heat water obtained from the sink as Sherlock flopped down in his chair with his mobile held in front of his face, thumbs flying over the keyboard on the screen.
Sherlock shook his head. “Not exactly; somewhere near there, though. There’s an old factory outlet just east of it, and I have a suspicion that’s where they’re located. We’re going to meet someone who can give us more information.”
When the scarf was removed from his mouth to gently scrub at a semi-dried bit of blood beside his nose, Sherlock spoke. “Okay. Or we could just split the rent.”
John continued staring Sally down, his brows furrowed in anger and annoyance, his hands balled into fists at his sides. He’d opened his mouth, ready to verbally rip into this girl, but Sherlock had interrupted him, beckoning him to duck under the tape he was holding up for him. “Come on,” Sherlock repeated in a tone that said,
“Hey,” Molly greeted, “I ran into some friends; I’d like for you both to meet Mary and John,” she said, looking to her left where the two blonds stood, smiling pleasantly. “John, Mary,” she continued, “this is Irene and Sherlock.”
John smiled, slowly, adoringly, and soon he was beaming, and had to duck his head to avoid looking like a complete maniac. “I think- I think this is all happening a bit… fast,” he said carefully, and when he looked back up, Sherlock looked more than a little embarrassed and even more scared. “But,” John continued, and worried his bottom lip for a moment before continuing, “I think… I think I’d like that.”
“There’s a door,” Sherlock murmured quietly from where he was peeking around the corner, looking at the side of the second warehouse. “I’ll climb atop that large bin and look in the window to be sure there’s no one inside, and we’ll go from there-“ the man paused in his running commentary when he looked back, and John blinked at the sudden lapse in the detective’s speech, followed by the pair of quicksilver eyes that swept over him and fixed on a spot near his abdomen. A moment later and John realised Sherlock was looking at his gun. He anxiously wet his lips.
I indulge in? Or would you rather just get to diagnosing me and recommending me to one of those loathsome twelve-step programs?”
What Sherlock could see of John’s profile from his peripherals turned absolutely scarlet at the insinuation, and Sherlock would be lying if he said his own cheeks didn’t gain a rosy tint as well. “Oh- no, I- um-” John tripped over his words, and Sherlock found it impossibly charming, however inconvenient it was.
John let it go. “Yeah. He’s been coming almost every week,” he said, before really thinking about how much he should be telling the other man. Not only was it against the rules, but it was also slightly immoral, to divulge this sort of information.
Several long minutes later and John saw lights up ahead through the thick curtain of rain, and suddenly, the sounds of the rain hitting the car were stopped. Which meant they were under shelter.
” Sherlock reiterated, beginning to seethe under the gaze which was growing impossibly more amused with each passing moment, but the amusement turned to regular cheer in the DI’s eyes when the back door of the car opened again and John climbed into the back seat with a small grunt of effort. The doctor sighed as he settled and shut the door.
“I don’t care if I’m caught,” Pavel said, voice low, as menacing as the look on his face. “I’ve nothing to live for anymore. You took my
“And now,” she continued, retrieving a small box from her vanity, “for the finishing touch.” After a brief moment of fussing with something Sherlock couldn’t see, she parted her black lips, which she’d glossed over with a slightly shimmering green gloss, and fitted a pair of small porcelain pieces to her teeth in her mouth.
it seemed like such a grand piece of information. Nevertheless, Sherlock tucked the detail away in a folder that sat on a familiar deep, black cherry stained oak desk, in a new, small room in his Mind Palace with two twin armchairs and the lingering scents of tannin and cheap, but subtle and pleasant cologne.
Keys, mobile, and wallet tucked in their respective pockets of John’s dark, well-fitted jeans and black Haversack jacket, John made ready to take his leave; but on the way out of the door, one foot over the threshold, he caught himself. As he turned his head, his eyes fixed on the single drawer in his bedside table, something in his stomach churning as he thought of what lie inside.
Secondly, kissing was rendered dangerous, as water had a tendency of getting into noses and slipping into mouths, rendering things messy, as well as making it rather difficult to properly breathe.
Sherlock grabbed a half-empty pack of cigarettes from one of his coat pockets and drew a smoke out of the pack by the butt, before lighting it cooly with the bunsen burner and extinguishing the small, gas-fueled flame for the time being. He took a long drag, letting himself imagine that he could still feel the burn at the back of his throat, that he could still feel the sensation of the nicotine high that hit after the first drag, that he could still taste the bitter tobacco on his tongue. The smoke that was expelled on his relieved exhale hung in the air like miniature, low-level cirrus clouds, slowly dissipating. Letting the fag hang from his lips, both of Sherlock’s hands moved to nimbly snatch up the two small, clear baggies of white powder; one filled with heroin, the other containing citric acid. He needed no assistance from measuring instruments, as his practised, chemists eye aided him in pouring near-accurate amounts of each substance, with the addition of a small amount of water from a nearby water bottle, into the small, metal bowl over the bunsen burner, which he then ignited.
There was a rustling of items and of feet, and in the brief pause in dialogue, John turned to Sherlock, easily catching the man’s attention.
The final verse of the song ended abruptly, leaving Sherlock and John still pressed to each other, breathing labouredly - but not from exertion. Sherlock searched John’s eyes in a silent question; one that the blond seemed to understand, because he nodded, and when Sherlock nodded back, John pulled hastily away and grabbed Sherlock by the wrist, pulling him back through the crowd.
Thank you endlessly for clicking your way here, for reading, for leaving kudos, for sharing your thoughts - anything and everything is appreciated. You all are the reason I'm here. So THANK YOU. You all are what I'm thankful for this Thanksgiving. <3
John watched as the man turned away, flipping his umbrella merrily beside him as he retreated, his free hand tucked into his trouser pocket. The doctor let out a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding, and looked down at his left hand. The mysterious man’s words echoed in his skull, but it morphed into the sounds echoing around the warehouse, and he turned around to find the source -
“Proof of the battles I’ve lost,” John amended, the heavy feeling in his gut only growing more prominent. Sherlock looked back at his face, eyes hard.
The trio entered the building and Sherlock noticed John looking around the vast interior of the main lobby with barely-suppressed awe. The detective slowed his pace to walk just behind Lestrade, and John followed suit. “You’ll get used to it,” he murmured, just loud enough for John to hear, and his heart attempted to jump its way up his throat at the quirky grin John gave him as he responded:
I think it's worth noting that this is my very first attempt at writing ACTUAL smut, so I hope to God it was worth the wait. If you have any thoughts, feel free to let me know in the comments below; I live for your feedback, and every word I read is so immensely appreciated.
They both whipped their heads around to look in the direction of the door, their visages mirroring expressions of bewilderment as they looked at who had interrupted them.
The forwardness of the comment had something in John’s chest tightening, but he played it off as best he could, giving a light huff of laughter as he continued cleaning away the blood. “What, you planning to move in?” he asked, meaning for the question to be light-hearted.
quickly,” the man said, an out-loud observation. “A soldier’s folly. Loyal and trusting to a fault.”
“Something like that,” Sherlock said as they rounded a corner onto a less-populated side-street. “You’ve your gun on you, yes?”
In hindsight, he needn’t have been worried about the answer he would receive. John’s lips stretched into a wide, toothy grin, and his eyes shimmered in the dim glow of the streetlamps. “
“Rachel here will actually take care of you, if you’re going to be hanging around,” he said with a nod in the young secretary’s direction, and the woman smiled politely at them both. “In the meantime,” John continued, “it was nice meeting you, Greg. I’ll, um… hullo,” he said, smile soft and kind as he peered around Greg to the very clearly annoyed young man who was staring rather pointedly at the exit. “Would you like to step into my office with me?”
“Watson!” Greg, his shaggy dark brown hair all askew, nose painted black and whiskers drawn on his face, fangs in his mouth, and fur peeking out from the cuffs of his flannel, stumbled out from the sea of people to greet John with an enthusiastic clap to his shoulder. “Glad you could make it, mate. And this is- wow, this is incredible,” he commented, suddenly very serious as he inspected John’s neck, pointing at the gaping wound with a clawed finger. John had nearly forgotten about it.
The man’s smile was one John would compare to something he’d seen on a shark. “Dr. John Watson,” he greeted smoothly, something in his tone making John’s spine stiffen. “I know the leg has been better for you as of late, but we both know what the cold and the damp does for both your leg and shoulder. Please, take a seat,” he said, and motioned with his umbrella briefly to a chair that was sat a short distance away from John.
“Oh, Christ,” he murmured, because of all the solid, smooth, cylindrical things to find in the back of a man’s pants drawer - or anyone’s pants drawer, for that matter - well, he had a pretty good idea of what it probably was. It certainly wasn’t a gun, anyway. So when he withdrew his hand and a sleek, black, silicon rod that measured a suggestive and salacious eight inches in length and a good four inches around came into view, he really shouldn’t have been surprised. “Fuck’s sake,” he groaned, feeling blood rush rapidly to his face, and he hastily put the decidedly
John thought it sounded rational, but as his gaze unwittingly flickered to the pale expanse of Sherlock’s abdomen, adorned with the occasional mole and baring a light dusting of dark hair below his navel, in the moment he’d likely feel a lot differently. “I don’t need a shower,” he compromised, “I just need to wash my face and hands.”
He’s been in John’s room before, he thinks to himself. Not always with John’s permission. But this is a special case, isn’t it? He looks down at Rosie and thinks that, yes, it is acceptable for him to put Rosie to bed and wait in John’s room until the man returns home.
Sherlock hummed, his head tipping back slightly in a slow nod. “Sister. There’s always something,” he mumbled to himself, before fixing John with a focused stare once more. “Anyway. Your experience?”
anything…” The man’s voice trailed off as he looked between the two men in the back seat via his rearview mirror.
Silently, he relented, and gave a sigh as he started towards the car, listening to the woman on her phone tailing after him in her heels. Once they were both in the car, the vehicle pulled back out of the warehouse and turned around to head back, presumably, into the city.
John noticed something in Sherlock’s eyes light up at all of the information that had just been divulged, as if it had confirmed whatever he’d already known, or as if hearing it all together connected so many different facts in his head. He swore, if Sherlock were thinking any louder, he’d give away their hiding spot.
; and John smiled softly and nodded in understanding. The small smile that took hold on Sherlock’s face was triumphant, and John’s chest swelled with pride.
I'll risk the repetitiveness to say thank you again so much for reading. You're all fantastic. Thank you thank you thank you for sticking with me. I am so incredibly sorry for the brief hiatus, but I'm glad to be back.
Up until this point, Sherlock had been content in ignoring the fact that he was very much infringing on John’s personal space, his property, and taking up his time; and while these were things the young detective normally didn’t give any thought to, he found that John was quickly becoming the exception to just about every guideline he’d posed for himself.
“Relax, John,” Sherlock reassured as he opened the back door of the taxi. “I’m hardly going to report you… but you should take care when you clean it; the gun oil does stain your jeans.”
With a small hum, Sherlock walked off, brushing past a clearly-pissed-off Sally, and John dutifully followed.
"Where are you going?" John called from behind him, seemingly in distress; and Sherlock realised the reason for the distress a moment later when he heard the distant
“No, it’s alright.” The brunette let out a sigh. “She told me I had to stay here for thirty minutes. Then I can get my things from her and leave.” He wondered why he agreed to the deal in the first place.
He closed his eyes in preparation for the familiar feeling of calm and sharp focus, but when Victor pulled the tourniquet off of his arm and retracted the needle, something felt off. And then Sherlock opened his eyes to see Victor’s shit-eating grin. And then the room tipped sideways.
Sherlock set his cup down on the counter. “I met her my first year at Bart’s,” he began. “We’ve shared several chemistry courses over the past few years. Our acquaintanceship has been convenient for the times in class where partners are required,” he said, his face morphing into one of mild distaste.
Yellow crime-scene tape was stretched across the length of the road, with police cruisers with lights on parked on either side of it. There was another length of yellow tape stretched across the road a ways further down, blocking off the area, which John noticed was, of course, surrounding the café he and Sherlock had visited earlier in the day.
John stood, setting his tea aside, letting the newspaper fall forgotten to the floor. “Yes... yes.” He looked between Sherlock’s eyes, seeing the mischief there. The corner of his own lips quirked up in an almost-imperceptible grin as he played along. His voice softened, but stayed firm. “Enough for a lifetime.”
He left the photo where he’d found it, face-down next to the picture of Paris, and turned with a small sigh to round the bed to gather his clothes. But when he rounded the bed, his eyebrows nearly disappeared into his hairline in shock and mild panic when he found his clothes, along with Sherlock’s, mysteriously missing. He cursed softly. Not wanting to take a page out of Sherlock’s book and grab a sheet from the bed to wrap himself in, and not wishing to stroll about the flat starkers just in case Mrs. Hudson came snooping, he looked around for another viable option - and found it hanging on the back of a glass-paneled door that led to the bathroom.
“So’s Sergeant Donovan,” Sherlock said, and nodded his head towards where Sally had come up near them, and John’s eyes widened as he realised.
Despite the horrid start to his morning, John had managed to pull himself together, and, after cleaning up the mess in the kitchen, he’d forced himself to shower, choke down some food, and get ready for work. And while he had stumbled into the office a full two hours early, he considered it far better than sitting alone in his flat. That being said, he was longing for his bed at the moment; a feeling he’d tried diligently to fend off by downing a few cups of coffee over his lunch break. But that only gave him a bit of a twitch in his fingers for a while, and the crash that followed was arguably worse than his initial fatigue.
in,” he said, “and they are more than a touch uncomfortable.” He raised a hand to stick his pointer finger and thumb into his mouth to twist and pull at one of his fangs. “Hhow go yoo geh veeze phucking phingz ouh,” he murmured to himself, and John laughed again.
When he got inside and caught up to Sherlock, he was giggling, and he looked up to find Sherlock smiling, far too pleased with himself. The taller man broke into a softer, more subdued fit of chuckles as he looked around the main part of the café and then led John off to the side, near the bar, where a group of people in blue smocks like Anderson had been wearing were congregated.
The doctor blinked at the reflection of the closed stall door before he remembered that he was washing his hands, and hastily rinsed and dried them before collecting his watch and making his way back to his office. When he returned, the man with the greying hair was notably absent, but the young woman at the desk suddenly looked about as tired as John felt.
Despite his better judgement, John stopped, and he fought with himself internally as he weighed his chances; if he didn’t play along, the man may very well pull a fucking sword out of his damned brolly and run him through. The bastard looked the sort to do it. After setting his jaw, John turned around. “What?” he asked, clearly irritated.
Sherlock’s smirk remained. “You’re thinking that it’s awfully nice of me to make you such a lovely and well-balanced breakfast,” he said teasingly, eyes shifting to the plate of toast still in John’s hand.
That's right; it's taken us eighteen chapters and nearly 100,000 words, but I do believe we have finally earned that Exclusive rating.
A beat of silence passed before the other man smiled. “Information.” John’s frown deepened. “Nothing indiscreet,” the man continued, and John didn’t even have time to wonder just
know all of that?” he asked breathlessly, completely awe-struck, and perhaps a little star-struck as well.
The sun, already beginning to set over the city, cast a warm, orange glow over the River Thames, which shimmered as the deep moss of the water mingled with shades of fiery orange and crimson, while a more mellow apricot and hints of gold danced among the other colours to paint a beautiful tableau that, once upon a time, long ago when Sherlock had first been brought to the city for holiday as a young boy, he’d marveled at.
John, feeling the fool for not recognising the source of Sherlock’s distress sooner, turned and shuffled his feet to scoot his wheeled desk chair across the room to settle before the bed. “Hey,” he said quietly, one hand reaching out without hesitation to place on Sherlock’s leg. He could feel the man subtly trembling. “Do you want me to go and fetch some things from your flat for you? A laptop, a charger for your mobile, a book?” He realised belatedly that he should have offered far sooner.
Sherlock pursed his lips. “Be sure to have people checking flight records and security footage from other airports, in case they’re trying to trick us by showing up a few minutes from Heathrow so we just look there,” he said, and ran a hand through his still-slightly-damp curls. “London City, Gatwick, Luton, Southend…” He let out a sigh and let his head loll back against the headrest.
, however, was a chaste, sweet press of dry, slightly-chapped lips against another set in a similar state, the kiss innocent yet somehow loaded with an impossible amount of things left unsaid and promises that had yet to be made and fulfilled. It was a move born of a sudden influx of adoration with a hint of yearning; and it was over all too quickly.
“Right,” he said at length. “Do you, um… mind telling me what this is, then?” he dared to inquire, looking back at the girl, who had yet to look up from her phone.
The feeling in John’s chest evaporated and was replaced by dread, heavy and lead-like in his gut while his head whirred with the realisation of what had happened, and he watched as Sherlock’s blood drained from his face, eyes widening in absolute terror as the man came to the same conclusion. In an instant, though, John was being shoved roughly back, and before he could question just why the bloody fuck Sherlock was shoving him away, the brunette made an obnoxious amount of noise clambering in the opposite direction as commotion broke out in the main part of the large room.
“Fair point,” he said, and pushed off of the wall, dropping his cigarette to crush it with the heel of one posh Yves Saint Laurent before starting off down the pavement wordlessly, clearly expecting John to follow.
Not a kill-shot, John thought to himself as he closed his eyes and took a fortifying breath - but it’d give Sherlock enough time to get to relative safety. A quick peek through the broken windows of the ploughing machine revealed Sherlock had indeed managed to cover what remained of the distance between him and the stack of wooden flats they’d hid behind before, where he was sitting, back against the wood, head tipped back, eyes staring unseeingly at the ceiling. The man’s chest visibly rose and fell under the pale fist clasped against it with quick, heavy breaths, his lips parted as he panted, and after a moment of gathering himself, Sherlock turned his head, meeting John’s gaze immediately. And what the doctor saw in those eyes, bright and nearly black with how wide his pupils had dilated, was adrenaline, excitement, a hint of fear, and something else; something undefined.
, but it was the first time that counted. He’d said it in looks he gave Sherlock, in the swipes of his tongue and the thrusts of his hips, in the brushes of his lips against Sherlock’s mouth and skin, and twice aloud while his inhibitions were lowered by alcohol. But this was the first time that really,
“L’était une p’tit’ poule grise, qu’allait pondre dans l’église.” His voice is low, soothing, a gentle rumble in his chest as he begins to sing. “Pondait un p’tit’ coco, que l’enfant mangeait tout chaud.”
Diligently, the detective-doctor duo followed the Detective Inspector through the propped-open door and down the hallway. “He’s back here in his office,” Greg explained as they walked. “Night cleaning crew found him.”
The car fell silent, but it didn’t last long, as Lestrade pulled into a lot filled with police cruisers not a minute later, and he quickly parked and turned off the engine. Without prompting, Sherlock opened his door and stepped out of the car, pulling his coat snugly around him and jamming his hands into his pockets as he walked alongside the DI towards the front doors of NSY. A presence quickly made itself known at his other side, and he fought back a smile as John found his place beside him, meeting him step for step.
“Here,” the doctor said, and Sherlock opened his eyes and turned his head just enough to take the water from John’s hand, now that his own weren’t shaking quite so violently. He offered a careful, silent nod of thanks before gently raising the cup to his lips to quench his thirst.
, before sticking the end of it in his mouth to hold it steady. As an afterthought, though, he removed it from between his lips and looked up and back at John. “Keep watch, will you?” he asked, before the torch was in his mouth again, pointed at the doorknob, and both his hands, each wielding a metal tool, began their assault on the keyhole.
“What is?” John asked, taking his hand back the moment it was released, and he watched as the other man turned to start ambling away again.
But the more time he spent in figment-John’s presence, the more Sherlock fretted over just why this man, after less than a month, had managed to tip Sherlock’s self-centric universe on its axis enough to garner his own suite in his Mind Palace. There were very few
He wanted to scream. He wanted to burst out from his hiding spot and fill all five of their smarmy heads with lead for even
“Social lubricant,” Sherlock responded. “I’ve been told I’m far better to get to know when even slightly intoxicated.”
Lestrade just sighed and scratched the back of his head. “I… Sherlock. I believe you. You know I do,” he said. “But the man was clinically depressed - his records show it. And until you can give me firm evidence besides a couple fag ends that may very well have been put there in a bloody
With a shaky exhale, Sherlock raised a tentative hand to rest against John’s chest, just over a tear in his battered jersey, and the heat that radiated from the spot of contact grounded him. He began to move, reservations swept away with his inhibitions as the alcohol in his system took its course. His hips swayed, knees bending, body moving where John’s hands gently guided him. His other hand found its way to John’s waist, much to the other man’s delight, if the grin that spread across his face was any indication.
it had been foolish of him to broach the topic. Here, of all places. In a break room with the door propped open. And in the way he had broached it; John was a hopeless romantic (he owned
“Please,” he croaked out, unable to remember when his mouth had gone so dry. His head tipped back against the wall behind his chair, groaning when his head throbbed unpleasantly as a result of the mild contact. He listened to the soft sounds of the cup being refilled, followed shortly by John’s gentle footfalls on the threadbare carpet in an easy gait, before the man sat down in the chair next to him.
unnecessary, in Sherlock’s opinion. “I’m a doctor, Sherlock,” the man added, his tone taking on an edge that was a little more serious. “I’m not going to let my patient go out and try to care for himself when neither of us know what’s going to happen. That’s not how I do things. Unfortunately for you, you’ve crossed paths with a doctor who cares a bit too much.”
“You’re incredible,” the man said, voice soft, and Sherlock, stunned, stopped walking and turned to face the other, whose face was an open book, filled with as much wonder and admiration as his words had been. “That’s… incredible. You fixed them up with a flat?”
“You’ve rather shown your hand there,” Sherlock quipped, unable to stop the grin that tugged at the corners of his lips. He heard John’s intake of breath - the man was likely close to an aggravated outburst - but he must have caught sight of the smile on Sherlock’s face, because the air escaped him in a puff before he let out a dry, soft chuckle.
“Ah, ah, and who’s this?” the woman - Sally - asked, looking John up and down before looking back at Sherlock. “Your boyfriend?” she asked, clearly teasing, and John looked in time to see Sherlock set his jaw.
John rolled his eyes. “I’ll buy you a new one. Come here,” he said again, raising his other hand to the back of Sherlock’s head to steady him as he brushed away the blood on his cheek.
Now, though, as he stood erect and sturdy, the familiar and somehow comforting weight of the cold metal in his practised grip gave him a sense of security; and something in his chest roared to life at the promise of
Could he really be blamed, though? Compared to the years he’d spent in the armed forces and his life prior, the last year of his life had been a miserable and monotonous experience; he had observed the world blurring around him in pallid tones of murky slate while he limped through his own pathetic shell of a life, trying and failing to find a true purpose. Being a practitioner helped in some ways, but he still felt like he was living in monochrome. And then came Sherlock; an enigmatic and youthful man whose mere existence demanded the attention of those around him. He was an invasive force, burrowing his way into John’s mind and heart and carving out a place just for himself. He made John’s mind whir and his heart pound in a way he hadn’t known since he was wielding a gun in a desert, and this time around there was much less fear and much more excitement.
professional. Solving crimes is what I do.” He caught John’s eyes in a sidelong glance as they walked. “And, if you think about it, going by myself is far more dangerous than having a soldier with me.” He cracked a grin. “Not to mention the fact that I
“I’m the new kid here,” he said, gesturing widely with his arms and giving a small smile. “I knew what I signed up for. And it’s not really that bad. I’ve actually-- oi!” His attention was diverted to something behind both John and Mary, and the pair looked around, started. “Sorry,” Greg addressed distractedly, pushing past them, “I’ll meet up with you both for drinks later. I’ve got to take care of thi-- Chelsea!” His attention was fully torn away as he stormed off quickly to a gaggle of girls, half of them giggling, half of them shouting, surrounding a young girl wobbling on her feet and grasping another’s shoulder for support. “You’ve literally only been here ten minutes and you already look like you’re going to be sick?! Take it outside! Take it outside!”
Sherlock looked down at his feet to hide his smile, and pushed away from the counter to face John head-on. “Enough about me,” he murmured, a flush rising to his cheeks as he dared to meet John’s eyes again. “What about you? I will say, the makeup is impeccable,” he said, eyes trailing down to John’s neck.
“What are you thinking about?” The question wasn’t intrusive, just inquisitive, soft, genuinely curious. Casual conversation.
“This is my favourite shirt,” John murmurs sadly, hand sliding up Sherlock’s side to brush his fingers over the dried stains on his chest.
Sherlock seemed to search John’s face curiously for a few moments before relenting. “7D Montague,” he said at length, and sat forward a bit from the wall, body gravitating just a touch closer to John’s as he spoke. John kept carefully still. “My laptop is on my desk, plugged in. My mobile charger is by the bed. Don’t mind the mess,” he added, “and my keys were in my coat.”
“She’s looking for a rebound, evident by the vibrant shade of red on her nails and lips… but she’s not completely ready to let go of him. The small, heart-shaped locket around her neck could be from a family member, but every time she looks at another man, she bites her lip and her free hand moves to fiddle with the locket. So, he left her. Sentiment, she would have gotten rid of it if it were the other way around.” He finished and let out a long exhale through his nose, jaw setting as he readied himself for the inevitable outburst;
"If they did have a flight booked for today," Lestrade cut in, "they won't make it to the first gate. We've sent out their photos and aliases - since I doubt they're using their real names - to surrounding airports to make sure they're on every no-fly list anywhere near us."
And while Sherlock longed to prolong this and bask in the lights flashing behind his eyelids, in the breathy pants breaking against his clavicle and the feeling of his and John’s intertwined hands working them both to climax, he knew he wasn’t going to last forever. As it turned out, he wasn’t going to last another full minute; with a few more steady and firm strokes of his and John’s hands, Sherlock’s lungs filled themselves to capacity and his entire body seized. His back arched away from the wall a final time and a moment later, his release was painting his own stomach white. His eyes opened to find John’s eyes boring into his with a look of unbridled awe as he came, and the next moment his lips were captured in a kiss that had no right to be as earnest and tender as it was.
“L’était une p’tit’ poule brune, qu’allait pondre dans la lune,” he sings softly, swaying back and forth in time where he stands, Rosie now completely calm in his arms despite the occasional sniffle as her breath struggles to even out. “Pondait une p’tit’ coco, que l’enfant mangeait tout chaud.” The room falls silent with the end of the song, and Rosie’s tired eyes squint after a long moment, making a pitiful noise when she reaslises that Sherlock isn’t going to continue.
Waking up next to Sherlock had been one of the more pleasant side-effects of the man’s withdrawal; it meant he slept in, and John was treated to the sight of soft morning light cutting through raven curls, of a dried trail of drool drawing a line from the corner of dry, parted lips to a small damp spot on the pillow, and the sound of a barely-there snore. Apparently these sleeping habits didn’t transfer over to sober-and-healthy Sherlock’s life. He was back to keeping odd hours, which meant John woke up alone; even after a night of drunken, enthusiastic shagging. Which, it turned out, John didn’t mind at all, because
“I’m not implying anything!” Sherlock said with mock-innocence, stepping aside and sauntering slowly towards the door, “I’m sure Sally dropped by for a late-night study session and just
“You’re a medical man, what’s your diagnosis?” Sherlock asked, his gaze steady, and while his expression remained stoic, John could almost assuredly see the smug smile in his eyes.
“Do you want me to say that I’m attracted to you?” he asked on a breath, a sight less self-assured than he’d intended it to be.
“What makes you say that?” John asked curiously, tilting his head slightly and settling comfortably into the conversation – complaining about police officers being daft was certainly an interesting way to start a session, but he’d take it. “I rather think they’ve got to be at least somewhat competent – they caught that serial killer a few days ago, didn’t they? It was all over the news,” he said, recalling the headlines from earlier that week. A grisly story, it had been, for certain. John, for one, was impressed by the cunning of the police force – it took a lot of work to catch masterminds like the mass-murderer they’d recently apprehended, didn’t it?
“Sherlock?” Greg called after the young man, but it was too late, as the main door was already closing behind him. The detective inspector began to follow, but seemed to realise that any attempt at restraining Sherlock and persuading him to do anything other than what he wanted to do would prove to be laughably futile. Instead, Greg huffed an aggravated breath and ran an anxious hand through his silver hair. Then he turned his gaze to John, who had since risen from his chair to come and stand in the doorway of his office, gazing bewilderedly at the exit. John turned his head to look back at him.
In the days since, he’d been a wreck; high almost constantly as he fought physical and mental exhaustion, strove viciously against the physical need for sustenance, and battled valiantly to dismiss the distracting puzzle of
The weary detective paces across the sitting room for what he estimates to be roughly the six-hundredth time this evening, attempting to hush the wailing infant. His efforts are in vain.
After a few long moments, the dark-haired man looked up at John, and the doctor could feel the man surveying him with his keen eyes. “Five minutes?” he asked, after what felt like an eternity.
“Gesundheit,” Greg quipped, and John had to bite his lip to stifle a grin at the remark combined with the eye-roll Sherlock gave that threatened to make his irises disappear.
the voice with the Irish lilt continued as both of John’s hands came to settle on the subtle dip just above Sherlock’s hips, and the brunette opted to take the advice of the song and follow John’s lead.
The look on John’s face at the barrage of demands and questions would have been comical if Sherlock weren’t so determinedly focused on the task at hand. He struggled a moment to push himself to his knees on the mattress before he inelegantly clambered to the foot of the bed, since John seemed to be taking his sweet time to remove himself from Sherlock’s path.
“Should be fine. And I’ve got you with me. You could just carry me if I collapse.” The small grin that crossed his features did not go unnoticed by John; he snorted dubiously.
“Fun?” John asked with a raised eyebrow, and his eyes darted down to the rather repulsive-looking corpse on the ground in between them, the only witness to this ridiculous conversation. “Ah, there’s a man. Lying dead. Right here,” he clarified with a point of a finger, in case Sherlock had forgotten.
Sharing a shower was not nearly as sexy as Hollywood or written erotica would have you believe. Firstly, there was no way in hell was John going to risk slipping to kneel on the hard porcelain bottom of the tub - his knees were still aching and the slightest bit bruised from the night before - to suck Sherlock off, and he imagined Sherlock wasn’t going to risk it for him, either. Not that he minded; he really did need to get ready for work, and blowjobs, while they could be quick, were time-consuming nonetheless.
“Just grabbing something! Go ahead, I’ll be right out,” came the response, and Sherlock frowned and rolled his eyes, but he followed the doctor’s command and left with a huff, letting the door fall closed behind him. He all but bolted down the stairs and burst through the front door to see the familiar car sitting by the kerb, an impatient-looking detective inspector sitting in the front seat, thumbs tapping anxiously on the top of the steering wheel. Once the man saw Sherlock, he raised his eyebrows - likely in response to Sherlock’s state of dress, the detective thought - but thankfully didn’t verbalise his thoughts on the matter once Sherlock got to the car, opened up the back door, and dipped inside to settle in the back seat.
I figured I should mention, though I'm sure it goes without saying, that the addresses I have used thus far in the story are fictional. The Montague Street address is a nod to canon, and according to Google Maps, Montague Street is adjacent to the British Museum. 7 Montague is also a hotel or something. So yeah, it's all fake, it's all lies; it's all for the sake of the story. I figure it doesn't matter to most of you, but I thought I ought to mention it.
“You always say that,” Victor murmured with a soft tutting sound and exaggerated sadness, but his expression morphed into one of pleasant surprise when Sherlock deposited a fifty-pound note in his outstretched hand. “Fuck, alright. Hold on,” he murmured, and stuffed the note deep into one pocket before wandering off into some dim corner of the room.
Sherlock stared at the proffered hand for a few seconds longer than strictly necessary, trying desperately to quell the not-entirely-unpleasant churning in his gut, and as the synthesized xylophone that came through the speakers was joined by the rhythmic, percussive sounds of hands on an acoustic guitar, he raised his cup to his lips and quaffed the remains of red-hued drink. The heat that seared his throat was no match for the flame in his chest as he set the emptied cup down and looked back at John, whose eyes were as bright as his blinding smile. He slid his hand into John’s, only able to admire for the briefest of moments how lovely the juxtaposition between his long, pale fingers and John’s shorter, thicker, tanned digits was, before John was pulling him away from the counter and into the group of undulating, swaying bodies.
“Just that. We’ll board up with Warren and be off.” Another grunt. “Can’t wait to have food with actual
syringes wouldn’t be so careful,” he said, and John’s stomach tightened at the fact that he knew this was a bit of personal knowledge. “No track marks on his arm; likely injection site is on his leg.
The answer came in the form of a dismissive wave of Sherlock’s hand, followed by: “not at all. Though I don’t really pay most of the time.”
John’s eyes widened, and his cheeks coloured. “Oh, no, we’re not- Mary and I aren’t together,” he said with a shy smile, and then he blessedly answered Sherlock’s unspoken question with what he said next. “I’m actually not seeing anyone, at the moment.”
“Are you always this tense?” John asked, the question posed with a chuckle and words trailing into an almost-imperceptible slur.
“I certainly hope you’re not seeing those therapists any longer, and if you are, fire them,” the man continued, voice a bit softer now. “Because they’ve got it the wrong way round. You’re under stress this very moment, and your hand is perfectly steady.” His haunting smile widened into something that almost made John sick. “You’re not haunted by the war, Dr. Watson. You
It was the exact same room as earlier, and there was no stereotypical, blood-curdling scream in the background. The only differences in the room this time were that there were a few ultra-bright florescent lights on stands in the corners of the room, there was a piece of rope that was tied to the bare rafters of the ceiling that was frayed at the end, and there were a small number of people draped in blue milling about, talking in hushed tones, jotting down notes, going about their own business. It was quiet, but not excruciatingly so; for all intents and purposes, it was a rather calm atmosphere.
“John? Did you pack any decent trousers in that duffle you got from my flat?” he asked as he quickly typed out a response:
Greg, however, seemed to understand completely, as his shoulders sagged and his lips pursed, and he let out a slow breath through his nose. “Yeah. He, um. He’ll do that.” He gave John an apologetic glance. “Sorry about that. But thank you for your time. Seriously.”
While John was well aware of the fact that Hollywood panache was further from reality than he could ever imagine, there was a certain amount of drama that came with stuffing wound-packing-pellets into a young lad’s stomach as he bled out on the cot in an infirmary in the middle of a blistering desert, screaming incoherently the names of loved ones back home; or the pristine stillness and silence, accompanied by the din of small, medical instruments against metal slabs in cadaver labs.
John opened his mouth to speak, but caught himself as the statement registered, and he just looked at Sherlock, the realisation of just what that meant blooming in his head. Apparently, his epiphany registered on his face as well, because Sherlock did a double-take when he looked back at him, and then shot John a withering glare.
“It’s proof of your resilience,” he began, “and of your vitality. Look,” he gestured, and John followed Sherlock’s pale fingers with his eyes as he brushed along the scar tissue. “Scarring; proof of healing. A body that heals is a body that is alive and fighting,” he said, each word falling reverently from his lips. John let out a shaky breath. “Proof of bravery,” the man continued, pressing his palm flat against the gnarled, pink flesh of the exit wound. “Proof of the battles you’ve fought.”
, in the middle of the city he’d been in love with all his life, Sherlock was going on nearly a month sober, out of the dismal chasm of detox and being a perfect pain in the arse once again, and John couldn’t be more happy. Everything was more vibrant; the colourful leaves on the autumn trees were breathtakingly beautiful, the greens of the grass appearing more lush and alive than usual, and the sun, God, the
John let out a slow breath. “Tough stuff to be hooked on,” he said, and leaned back in his chair a bit, watching as Sherlock gave a mild shrug. “How did it start? Do you remember?”
“Well, fuck,” John said, thoroughly put-out. “Looks like we missed it.” His spirit deflated as he watched people in uniforms bustling about down the street behind the tape. The tall buildings surrounding the area combined with the dead of the night meant that John could almost hear clearly the orders being barked by whoever was in charge, and he could feel his mood starting to sour. He knew he’d been excited for this, but he hadn’t been aware of just how
he thought to himself with a grin as he made his way off campus to catch a cab. Normally, he’d be immensely put-off by the idea. But now, he basked in it.
Fuck,” Greg cursed as he pulled a set of handcuffs from his belt and moved to kick John’s gun far away from the body on the floor, before standing with his feet on either side of Pavel’s thighs, gathering his limp hands behind his back and clamping the metal of the handcuffs snugly around his thick wrists.
As he’d sat up and warily took in his surroundings, pieces of his memory slotted back into place; Victor with a syringe filled with
“You’re ridiculous,” Sherlock narrowly avoided sputtering, and turned on his heel to storm off towards the bed.
At the prodding, Sherlock took a moment to look between both of John’s eyes for any sign of deceit, before launching into his reasoning.
was the reason for his heart leaping into his throat when he spotted a silhouette leaning against a building a short distance down the pavement that shouldn’t have been as familiar as it was.
“I was introduced to cannabis in sixth form when the boy I shared a room with in the boarding house was an avid smoker. My first experience was uneventful, and I quickly found the culture around the consumption of marijuana, including binge-eating and discussing contemptible excuses for philosophical epiphanies all rather trite… I had been under the impression, previously, that intoxicants would aide in my… my desire to slow down.” Sherlock frowned at the blank wall as he finished.
having someone to look after him,” he said, jabbing an accusatory thumb in Sherlock’s direction, which had the younger man scowling in affront. “Besides,” the DI continued, “from the looks of things-” his chocolate eyes scanned the two bodies on the ground, “-I’m not entirely confident you would have weaseled your way out of this one, Sher.”
, he thought to himself as he handed the cabbie a handful of pounds and exited the car. The rain greeted him again and John cursed lightly to himself as he shut the taxi door and jogged across the pavement to a door with the number seven marked on the front in chipped chrome markings, and he dug the unfamiliar set of keys out of his pocket. Thankfully, the front door to the building was unlocked, and he let himself into a dimly-lit foyer with a set of stairs to the right and a hallway to the left. Figuring 7D was upstairs, John plodded his way up the staircase to the upper floor, where doors to 7C and 7D greeted him. He was able to find the correct key to Sherlock’s door on the first try, and he was thankful for it, because he wasn’t sure how he’d react if another tenant from the building witnessed him entering Sherlock’s flat. But he got through the door without incident, let it close behind him with a gentle ‘thud,’ and felt around on the wall next to him for a light switch.
to stay over. Happens all the time,” he said, and turned back towards the pair, looking between them and then up and down Sergeant Donovan. “And I assume she
“This is the most - ridiculous thing - I’ve ever done,” John managed between his laughs and heaving breaths.
“Great. I’ll be here. And you have my number; I’m just a phone call away,” John added as casually as he could.
Sherlock fixed John with a look that John couldn’t quite decipher. “Because I have no interest in searching for another therapist when I have a perfectly acceptable one right here.”
“I am feeling better,” Sherlock murmured as he typed out a quick message to a number saved under the contact name
Sherlock the anonymous tipper, who seemed to have a place in nearly every news article he found? If he was, why was Sherlock remaining anonymous?
