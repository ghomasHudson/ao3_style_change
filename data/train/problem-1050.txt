I done to John? Broke him in a million ways but in the end I killed him. I told him I loved him then shot him too. Watched him die. Was saving Mycroft,
“I would not have been forced to highlight the matter had the doctor not been 45 minutes late for his follow-up with you due to their exploits.”
His heart threatens to wrench free from the fragile cage of his ribs at the mere thought of what he intends to do, so he stamps his anxiety down by focusing on the sound of John; the creak of the floor under his heavy, weary tread, his mutters and amused huffs as he encounters remnants of Sherlock's various experiments, his contented sigh as the aroma of the steeping tea drifts to his nose.
There are parts of John that Sherlock can't quite imagine because he has no data. They are sometimes blurry or shifting into various forms throughout Sherlock's fantasies. But he had felt that part of John
suggests he's being as generous in calling it that as an adult is when they call a child's scribbles 'art.' “It’s not
He takes a deep breath and the scent of John is unhelpfully supplied by his manipulative mind; calling him back to the fantasy. He growls in frustration.
Sherlock just shakes his head back and forth, putting on a look of innocence. I glance down and see the glint of metal of a rather menacing sword pushed back under the chair he is sitting in. He has his foot atop it in an effort to hide it from me.
There's the sound of a door clicking shut and then perfect bare feet thudding over the ratty carpet as John quickly approaches from behind. Sherlock nearly groans aloud.
"Sherlock? Sherlock? Come back to me." John crouches over Sherlock's prone body and slides a hand around the back of Sherlock's head into his soft curls. He feels along the back of Sherlock's neck down to his spine and up to the base of his skull, checking for signs of injury. He cups him gently around his jaw with both hands and tilts his head back. He's surprised when Sherlock's breathing picks up, his lips part, and he lets a soft whimper slip from his lovely lips. His stark black eyelashes flutter against the porcelain white of his cheeks.
"Oh, hello," she says, sounding as if she's pleased to have just found something that she'd misplaced.
- as an insult. John sighs and frowns slightly as he looks towards the fireplace. The air in the room feels heavier and colder as Sherlock presses his lips together hard and mentally curses his lack of verbal filters.
Captain Watson gestures to the anesthesiologist. “Make sure he is under, will ya? I don’t want him coming out of it and going into shock." He turns to look over his shoulder and catch the eye of a nurse. "And nurse, push some antibiotics into his drip. It can’t hurt to get a jump on any potential infections.”
“Just... don't stop... holding… talking… yeah?” John feels the warm liquid cutting a path from the corner of his eye down his cheek. “I’ll try-”
Sherlock is becoming quietly addicted to John, and fighting hard to control stray thoughts that all revolve around his doctor.
Undeterred, he picks up John's wrist, just as he had done to the woman who'd been murdered. John sucks in a breath as the cold delicate fingers encircle his sleep warmed skin, tightening a fraction before Sherlock turns it. He studies the underside of John's wrist. Then he uses his other hand to flex the palm back so he can get a closer look at the creases. He drops it without a sound or comment, but his brow furrows. He suddenly swoops down to crouching.
Feeling Sherlock's body shudder against his own and listening to him struggling for breath now, a cold realisation of what is really going on settles into John's chest. He used to have anxiety attacks like this all the time when he first came back from the war. Any little thing could trigger it. It's no wonder, really. Sherlock rarely eats or sleeps; both which contribute to the likelihood of a panic attack. Add on top of that how worked up he seems to be lately and some past trauma and you have a perfect formula for a breakdown.
It hadn't passed John's notice that, since the night when it all fell apart, Sherlock hasn't really been looking at him - not like he does when he is deducing someone deeply. That piercing, analysing gaze used to be directed at John several times a day, often without reason. It was more like habit or a touchstone that seemed to help Sherlock center himself. He suspects Sherlock has been avoiding deducing him deeply for the same reason John had trouble looking at himself after that last blanket incident. John was hiding - hiding from himself - from the changes that had been happening inside him in the way he felt for Sherlock. Hiding so well that he didn't even know his own truth until he'd been forced to confront it by almost losing Sherlock.
Well, it's not as if he hasn't thought about it; about how their life together is everything he never knew he wanted. With or without the physical intimacy, they have a wonderful, if unusual, domestic arrangement that he never wishes to end. And if Sherlock wants to make that official, John will gladly do so. He will write it in blood, if need be.
"It’s my Chairman. The police have been on to him. Apparently they’re telling him it was a suicide." He looks up at Sherlock with a raised eyebrow. The ruse is obviously up.
Almost the entire file is stuffed full of extensive political and historical background information about the influential Singh family and the tumultuous Jharia region. The family has ties to royalty and considerable circles of influence that reach all the way to the highest cabinets of India's government. There are many family members engaged in powerful political offices that have gained numerous outspoken and passionate rivals over the years.
... and she always said that the secret to a happy marriage is that the commitment is not something you do once in a church in front of a bunch of people, it is something you do
“Don't want to go, Sir…” McDonnell's voice quivers, barely slipping through the mask over his nose and mouth and, Christ, has the boy even gone through puberty properly yet? He sounds so young.
John brings his hands, still held like he is in a stick-up, to rest gently on Sherlock's upper arms to ground him in the here and now. Sherlock doesn't tense to this touch, but sinks a little deeper into his shoulder, his breaths starting to even and slow.
growl and go pliant. It makes John gasp, choking on his muffled words, and Sherlock plunges in, plundering his mouth. Their tongues tangle. That is a bit like Medieval John,
The odds were extremely low now that the next chamber would be empty. After a long moment Sherlock lifted his head.
“I couldn’t bear to let them fall apart,” A nervous voice interrupts the quiet of the museum. Sherlock looks up and narrows his eyes on the skinny, young man with curly brown hair and hazel eyes, shifting anxiously from foot to foot. “Not with how much she cared about them,” the young man,
Sherlock hadn’t just closed the door on a relationship, he’d slammed it in the man’s face and bolted it. John had smoothed it over so quickly and shown no other clear signs of interest. So, Sherlock assumed he had somehow mistaken John's interest; that it was only himself projecting his own desires onto John. Wishful thinking. He
"The flower. VanCoon's death -" he's right in front of me now; hands swishing elegantly through the air as he paints a mental picture of the connections, "They are meaningful to
when it comes to Mycroft's role as a Liaison. His 'minor position’ within British government affords him the ability to protect the interests of their kind and ensure the populace remains ignorant of their presence. However, in Sherlock’s opinion, Mycroft often takes liberties with that power; manipulating and interfering with matters outside the scope of what is strictly necessary.
Sherlock blinks at it, scrubs at his bleary eyes then stares at it some more. His name printed in that careful, slanted scrawl and drag marks over it from John's hand. He lifts it and touches it gently to his lips, then puts it carefully in his pocket and turns away from the glass case.
of yours, or John’s blog anyhow. Agreed to... look the other way, so to speak. Then it was just a matter of that young fella, the boy that did the Moriarty broadcast for The Game Master. Just an innocent, really. Didn’t know what he was doin’ at the time... still it was John that got Mycroft to go easy on him; give him an internship instead of a prison cell… That’s just John all over... Good heart pays off in the end, I suppose. Good havin’ people in your corner, init?”
In the sudden quiet of his new stillness, where even his breath is held hostage in his chest, the sound reaches his ears of John’s rapidly retreating footsteps, thumping up the staircase to the ex-soldier’s room.
“My scar? No… I could do without the pain, but… the scar makes me who I am. I don’t think I’d be who I am… or
"Careful." John steadies him as he lowers himself. Sherlock groans with pleasure, his chattering teeth beginning to taper off as he sinks lower and rests his head back on the edge of the tub. His muscles begin to uncoil in the warmth and, though there's a dull throb in his head and ribs, he thinks that this might be the best thing he's ever felt.
“And I may have implied that the nurses lack the skill to be entrusted with the adequate care of gerbils,” Sherlock mumbles.
A soldier, a healer; you find me and are driven to protect me.” Sherlock stops short of explaining all the other ways he knows John is Justus and all the other iterations of that man; the way he smiles, the pure joy in his laughs, the spark in his eyes that reaches out and sings on every nerve in Sherlock's body.
“Hello, Sherlock.” Hopkins speaks gently to the top of his head. She sees the blood matted there and the patches where the hair is thin revealing swaths of pink scalp and areas of shorter, finer hairs growing back in.
As he moves towards the bed, he pauses and picks up his shoes. He examines them carefully, turning them over in his hands.
.” John narrowed his eyes on the small amount he could see of Sherlock. Sherlock's head was turned away and he’d slumped further, as if Victor’s hold on him was all that kept him upright. “Sorry… I was…”
John rubs at the back of his own neck as he carefully considers the situation. He knows what he wants to do. God he wants to grab and snog Sherlock senseless - he wants that with every fiber of his being - but he'd promised himself he wouldn't do stupid shit like that again. He can't. Especially when it's quite possible that the signals that Sherlock is giving off aren't altogether voluntary but are simply a product of the temporary disorientation and behavioural changes that sometimes accompany concussions.
“I mean, I think it was her - it's just… I don't know him - John, I mean... Think he's ahead of me in studies but... Um... he's friends with Mike Stamford, who's in anatomy with me and we've... Well... there's this kind of study group that meets sometimes and he - John - shows up around the end of it sometimes. He and Mike go do things together… I don't talk to John directly or anything - but… seems nice... Everyone likes him... Funny... Lent me some paper once.” She smiles tentatively at them and they both lift their eyebrows to tell her to get on with it. Irene drums her long nails on the table.
On the table, the body of McDonnell jerks and Captain Watson feels the heart’s wall tearing in the palm of his hand.
Sleep did not come easily but when it did it was with images of Sherlock dancing behind his eyelids;
“If they're goin’ straight for tongue down your throat, you're kissing the wrong boys, Love,” John muses.
“Hardly.” Sherlock shifts his hands a bit, still clasped in the center of his back, and deadpans, “Does this appear very convenient?”
“It's not there,” John says absently. Sherlock lifts his head to give him a quizzical look. John has lifted his upper body to stare down at the man wrapped around him. He knows his smile looks lazy and drunk.
He sweeps his eyes from John's bare feet, up his legs, over his tightly wrapped housecoat to his neck.
as the case of an apparent abduction of a young girl from a powerful political family in the Jharia region of India.
John. He just knows you’re-” Sherlock’s mouth snaps shut suddenly and his head jerks back as if he’s just realised that he's said too much when he almost said something truly catastrophic.
Sebastian. He was murdered," Sherlock says, at last breaking his silence, with a tone that almost seems like it's a plea. I cock my head at that, curious at the rawness of it. It seems
John rolls over with a groan of displeasure. It's an ungodly hour and there's a loud and insistent pounding on his door. He squints bleary eyes over at Mike's bed, hoping he's going to handle the intrusion, but the bed is empty.
Fortunately, John has learned some subversive tactics of his own fighting insurgents in the deserts of Afghanistan. Sherlock has set his demands and made his strategic objective quite clear. John’s own objective is simple but immensely more difficult to achieve.
John looks Sherlock over slowly, letting his eyes linger on his bare legs; pale and thin but muscled. He lets his eyes drift over the sheet to the long column of his neck. He feels his tongue slide across his lips.
He digs and digs at the memory, but he can’t find the missing scraps. He tells himself that he can’t draw a conclusion from what his fragmented and distorted recollection seems to indicate.
Sherlock leaps up over the bench, startling Molly back into her seat in his haste to get away. He bursts through the side door, skids down the hall, flies up the staircase, and doesn't stop until he's in the little lab behind the offices on the third floor that no one ever uses, aside from himself.
“What is?” Stinson’s eyes have slid closed again and his voice is murky with the pull towards sleep but his brow furrows in an expression of concern, as if he isn’t half drooling into his sheets. Watson looks him over and smiles grimly then slowly flexes his hands, arms, feet, calves. He rolls his shoulders and his spine to try to relieve the strain lingering in them. At last he leans back, half propped against the wall behind the head of his bed with one arm behind his head to cushion it and the other hand resting lightly on his stomach.
I glare over at Sherlock who has put his arm up to call a taxi. “Because he didn't have it all worked out? He was there all of 5 minutes before you laid into him.”
John chuckles softly, “Yes, well we know from the state of our kitchen that you may not be the best judge on the whole
a quick learner." Green-blue eyes fix on John with a fierce edge. "If you were to initiate and demonstrate appropriate technique, I am certain I could employ an inductive methodology to master the needed skills and excel quickly in creating a pleasurable experience."
fault. Human beings typically have a predictable pattern of behaviour. Statistically speaking, given the frequency of your vehement rejections of the idea of being precieved as in intimate relations with me, there should be no cause to consider any other scenario than you putting up some form of resistance to shedding your clothing. That variable
"I don't think-" He means to say that he doesn't think that's a good idea and he should probably leave immediately but then he's swaying dangerously on his feet.
I can at least do my best to not be an easy mark. That means I'm going to have to find a way to make ends meet without taking funds from Sherlock's case.
Shivers are racking Sherlock's body. He is throbbing painfully. He is afraid to close his eyes and endure further emotional injury in service of this unobtainable fantasy but he can't do this without John. He has tried; it never works.
“So, showing up drunk, pounding on your door, and falling on top of you when you opened it were not my finest moments and very much a first impression I would've liked to have improved upon… didn't do so
Stamford waves him off with an offer for coffee later. Sherlock tentatively accepts, surprised at how genuinely eager this old acquaintance seems to reconnect.
“Oi. Wait one fuckin’ moment.” There is a different type of warning laced through John’s tone now. It raises the hairs on the back of Sherlock’s neck.
"There is no reason to fight this." He rocks his body against mine and I can feel his plush rump, slide against my throbbing cock through our clothes. I suck in a deep breath, grabbing at his hips in an effort to still him, but the sensation still shivers through me like the aftershocks of an earthquake.
He can taste John on his lips, feel the inside of his thighs pressing into John. His hands are gentle and warm and he is so very afraid to hope - afraid his imagination is misinterpreting the information, skewing it to reflect his own desires. Sherlock shakes his head back and forth, gritting his teeth to keep in the words pressing against the back of them from escaping.
John’s eyes have gone darker, red rimmed, he’s been crying or he is about to. He is standing in front of a door,  221A is printed neatly on it in Gothic letters.
“Jealous someone else is getting all the credit, Cap?” Stinson half opens his eyes and smirks at Watson. They are bloodshot and out of focus but he still manages to instill them with that dark spark of humour he is known for.
“I shoot with my right hand,” I say instead, glancing over at him as the cab pulls into traffic. He's typing on his phone again.
Not sure if I will continue. As usual, you can likely convince me there is more story to tell with your comments.
The figure narrows its eyes and fixes Captain Watson in a cold glare. It shakes its head again, returning its attention to Billy.
Sherlock blinks several times. Then he looks down at himself and around the room. John can almost see him sifting through all the information before he finally answers. He meets John's gaze once more.
. He always finds it is better to delete everything from before and during those nights. Review of such things only risks a vicious cycle where he'll find himself uncovering a renewed need to deaden determinantal emotional responses.
When John has at last delivered him a mug of tea, Sherlock allows him to place it on the table before he springs into action. He snaps open his eyes and swiftly reaches out to encircle his fingers around John's wrist. Sherlock gently but persistently pulls the solid man over and down on top of his own reclining body.
It’s only when I see the rare flicker of tension in her face, and note how she's shifted back in her seat with a wary stare fixed on me that I become aware of just how viciously I've reacted. The sound of my roar is still echoing in the room, I am gripping the arms of the chair tightly and leaning forward, practically snarling at her.
“Hopkins,” Sherlock mutters, not looking up but lowering his hands from his feeble attempt to cover his ears. “Did you bring me tea?” His attempt at his old imperiousness makes her smile.
Angelo’s smells as delicious as he always remembers it. The scent of rich sauces and fresh spices envelopes Sherlock the moment he steps in the door and his stomach gives a grumble of anticipation. He looks down, puzzled, trying to recall when he’d eaten last. Some sweet, flaky thing Hopkins had shoved in front of him at the coffee shop. She has John’s skill for slipping food under his nose when he is deep in thought. He hardly realizes he is eating until he finds his hand reaching for an empty plate of its own accord and the taste of food lingering on his lips and tongue.
A shiver ripples through Sherlock’s gaunt frame. He tips his chin to his chest but fails to hide a flickering of what can only be described as mortification before quickly whirling away, coat flapping around him like an exotic bird unfurling its wings. His long legs carry him quickly in the opposite direction down the dark alley.
quite helpful in resolving that double murder case they’d been working on, but thinks better. John seems unmoved by logical arguments on this matter; probably due to some acceptation related to gifts and
Keep talking. Keep it together. "Been rubbing people up the wrong way and getting their fists as thanks since I was seven. It'll heal."
Just when I think that things are about to tip over the edge and he might actually do something absurd; like a switch flipped, his interest turns off and he spins away, walking towards the window.
There is something more to the expectant gaze this evening. There is a soft pink heat to Sherlock's pale cheeks, in spite of the cool night air, and something simmers right below the surface of those piercing, quicksilver eyes. There is none of his usual air of pompous indifference. Instead every muscle is tightly coiled and primed for action as he leans forward, almost onto his toes, as if issuing a challenge for John to speak.
I cast around wildly, as if some clue to John’s whereabouts could be read from the oppressive air around me. I felt Tom grasp at the back of my jacket, and with a clenched fist, held me there, as if he sensed my next move would be to charge around the house tearing open every door I found. He knew me well, for I would have done, had it not been for the following words.
As they finally moved against each other, John knew that with Sherlock he had finally managed to unwrap the truth.
Fucking Mycroft Holmes. He had expected something like this, from the moment his father had called him to his study to finalise the details of the charity dinner. There was only one reason that Victor knew of, as to why the elder Holmes would mysteriously offer his services.
“Yes, but that was when he had a little brother called Sherlock who was the apple of his eye and softened his heart”
One particular gentleman present at these merry gatherings perplexed me greatly. He never came in company but yet preferred to sit in the receiving room amongst the throng sipping wine and watching all with bright eyes that spoke of a keen intellect. He watched me too, tipping his cup in acknowledgement but mindful of the boundaries that had been set regarding my availability for the purposes of entertainment, until one evening he approached and sat at my side.
“I must go”, I whispered, and leapt out onto the floor, wincing as I stepped upon a shoe discarded from the day before, and grasping with frantic hands to catch up the clothes I had shed with such lustful intent. My own bed lay neat and untouched, and so I dashed through the door that connected to two chambers and diving, rolled madly around on the covers. John laughed heartily at the sight of me.
John’s mum was in the kitchen when they went down, the kettle had just finished boiling and she poured the steaming water carefully into three lilac mugs, a pyramid teabag in each. She was small, like him, slim with dyed blonde hair, lank and greying at the roots that signalled a re-style long overdue. There was an air of resignation about her, as if she’d given up a long time ago, undernourished and pinched, prematurely aged but no more than forty-five, the signs of a person who no longer cared about their own appearance or physical wellbeing. But her eyes were soft and kind, that same deep, hypnotic, navy blue.
“Mr ‘olmes?”, he said, scratching at his no doubt, lice-ridden head, keen dark eyes staring out of a dirt-streaked face.
A quiet sort of bliss settled over us after our night of high adventure, (and perhaps that alone should have given me pause – but how was I to know dear friends, what was to come?) For many more days than I cared to keep count of we barely left our rooms, doing little else but eat as we needed to, sleep and fuck in an endless languid cycle until I barely could stir without wincing at the dull ache in my muscles. There was little of the first on my part despite John’s continuing frustration and copious amounts of the latter of course, a fug of sweat and sex pervading the air of our chambers and a most alarming increase in our laundry bill which we could little afford. It was just as well then, that soon after John received a formal invitation to take up the position of clerk at Charles’ chambers. Charles called by himself to bring the news, late one Friday evening, and after making ourselves decent for the first time in days, spent a merry few hours in our company, leaving red-faced and drunk sometime in the early hours. And quite how he made the journey unmolested is a story for another time.
(Fat, Sherlock had said, untruthfully John had to admit, although next to Sherlock’s thoroughbred proportions anyone would appear fat).
“Well, if we do, it’ll be Mycroft’s fault, won’t it?” he shot back, as he ruffled his fingers through his shower-damp hair.
There were still so many things to talk about, John’s almost-fight with Victor, the cleaner, the missing cameras and the doctored images on the hotel’s own system, and everything crashed round in his head on a loop, mixed up threads and no idea which one to pull first. He knew what would help, but that was out of the question for now.
So Mycroft was planning a cosy little Friday night get together was he? Ha! He was obviously concocting some fiendish plan to drive John away now that he had become the focus of Sherlock’s attention. Mycroft never could stand not being the centre of the universe the selfish bastard. Anyway, he had Greg, so why should he care so much about who Sherlock was screwing?
“This is terribly British” John said, “sitting on a park bench drinking hot beverages out of a flask, although not at three in the morning…that’s just weird” he moved a little closer, resting his head on Sherlock’s shoulder, the warm weight of it anchored him.
He wished he could have shared it with Sherlock though, this bath was more than big enough for two, and it seemed such a waste of hot water and extra work for the servants who had to carry it all up and then down again.
He hesitated. It was tempting, but he didn’t have any idea where to look and for all he knew, Sherlock could just be having an epic sulk in his room at home. That was also a weekly occurrence. Maybe it would be better to risk the wrath of Sherlock and check in first with Mycroft, his older brother. He was a Phd student at Cambridge and should be home for the Christmas break by now.
John slowed his movements, burying his head in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, fighting to come back to himself.
‘Not an outright no then… that’s…interesting,’ Mike smirked, tapping his bottom lip, as if deep in thought.
“I am a legendary swordsman you know John” he breathed hotly in his ear and felt the faint tickle of soft blond hair on the side of his face.
- There were a range of punishments for sodomy in the 18th century, ranging from pillory (the stocks), to imprisonment, to execution by hanging. Public executions were held at Tyburn gallows on Tyburn Hill of the prisoners from Newgate prison until after the late 18th century.
“Rumour has it” said Irene, and John groaned again, the sheer volume of rumours surrounding the guy were just getting ridiculous, “the teacher’s don’t know quite what to do with him because he’s actually smarter than them”.
“Quite” the parson said, losing his stiff and formal countenance as his lips turned up into a smile. “Who gives this…man…to be joined in wedlock?” he asked the question to the room at large and I blushed as his eyes swept the assembled guests.
He hadn’t been led astray, hadn’t been abused, or damaged, or used, if anything, he had used them, addicted to the endorphin high of sex, a fuck to get his fix.
“Well from what I gather, there’s been a fucking lorry load of those, so you might want to narrow it down a bit more please”
how to do this. It was just like a dance, like a pas des deux, where they'd need to move together, and John would be dangerously restricted if Sherlock held himself too stiff or clung round John’s middle like a limpet. He sucked in a breath and held it, then let it out again slow, and steady. He did it again, and then again until his pulse stopped hammering quite so fast and dropped down to something resembling normal. The message had yet to reach his limbs, which felt weird and floaty, like they weren’t attached to his body. They were close enough that Sherlock’s chest was pressed tight along the length of John’s spine and it felt safe, and warm, and…right. He allowed his mind wander and imagined how it might feel, what everyone would say if they rode into school like this one day. How everyone would stare at him, at both of them, and wonder if it meant they were together, that John had chosen him. Everyone knew John Watson’s bike was sacred and Sherlock would be the first one, the only one ever allowed to ride it with him. He let out a sigh, wishing it could be true but at the same time softly scolding himself for such useless, childish fantasies.
Warm familiar hands stroked up my spine as I heaved once more, cheeks flushed hot from the exertion and the humiliating circumstance as John, my John coaxed and soothed, whispering words of comfort that I could not hear. I wiped off my mouth with the back of my hand and stood shaking, hands gripped onto the curved stone rail for support.
There was barely time to catch our breath. As Charles had said, a red gate stood off to the right, and hovering by was a small, skinny figure, a boy of no more than ten. He ushered us through, wide-eyed, and from thence into the back door of the terraced house beyond, up a steep narrow staircase, through an empty room with only bare sacking cloth on the floor, through an adjoining door to a short wooden ladder leading up to an attic.
A great booming voice loud enough to rattle the teeth in my skull called out from behind us. How had I missed him? The large familiar form of the landlord Mr Oxley, swung back the hatch door on the side of the bar and squeezed his portly body through the narrow gap. He reached me in two long strides, bodies parting like the sea before Moses and clapped a hand to my shoulder with such force that I staggered under the weight of it. “Your lad was startin’ to get worried up there, just on me way to give ‘im a drop of me finest red, calm ‘im down a bit like, settle the old nerves”. He winked and waggled the bottle under my nose most suggestively. It was of the same type we had procured on that fateful night, and which had been so instrumental in the downfall of my innocence. How drunk we had been then, how enraptured with one another. My heart swelled yet again .
The voice came from far away, niggling at the edges of his consciousness as the world faded around him again, the cold, dank graveyard giving way to a bright, searingly hot summer sun. Sweat dripped down his forehead into his eyes and he brushed it away, holding a hand to his face to shield it from the glare. John looked down to unzip his thick winter coat and found it already gone, replaced by lightweight khaki’s and a worn beige t-shirt, eliciting bitter memories of the not too distant past.
“Oh fuck!...what if he sees you?, you’re underage” John glanced around nervously at the pair of officers, currently chatting amiably to a young couple in matching jackets, sure they would notice any second, as if Sherlock had a massive flashing sign over his head that said ‘seventeen’.
“But he’s with John, they left together, I don’t know where they were going but John didn’t have any of his things with him, so not home…..anyway, for all we know he might have told him to piss off”
John sat on the edge of the bed , deathly pale, “She heard us…she fucking heard us, she was in the whole time, her bedroom next door, the sounds you were making Sherlock, you do tend to get a bit vocal”.
John swore under his breath, sweat already running in rivulets between his shoulder blades and coating his upper lip with a wet, salty film. He gritted his teeth and thrust harder and faster, not sure how long he could last at this pace. He leant further over Sherlock’s body, taking his hands from Sherlock’s hips, instead, winding his left arm around the thin chest and pulling him up lifting his upper body from the cushions. They were both almost upright now, kneeling, John positioned between Sherlock’s spread thighs, turned towards the back of the sofa now, Sherlock bracing himself on the headrest with one arm. The other arm reached back past John’s waist to clutch desperately at his thrusting arse, trying to push him further inside, shorter shallower penetration in this position. John bit down into the soft skin of Sherlock’s shoulder, muffling his cries and moans
“The drink is the lesser of the evils, Sherlock, this is not a trifling matter”, he began, “The Physician informed me the effects can lay dormant, you may feel quite recovered , but further exposure however brief may awaken a craving you may not be in control of. You wagered with your life last night…how could you be so careless?”
He was lying. And I did not know why. It was ever my curse that my lover would be the one I could not read.
“Obviously I was wrong Harry or I’d hardly be standing here now, would I? But John’s no fool, and I know how damn lucky I was to get that second chance…did you know I let him punch me first?....stood there and told him to do it….and he did”.
John couldn’t help but snigger at Harry’s indignant face “He just forgets to filter sometimes….you know?” he followed her into the kitchen and began opening cupboard doors.
How the hell did he manage to sneak around so quietly? He should teach a masterclass in stealth Sherlock thought angrily.
Of course, she thought John was straight, hadn’t for a second considered that he and Sherlock were together. Sherlock gave her a withering look and felt strangely satisfied as he caught John glaring at Seb, eyes narrowed darkly.
“You have to hold my head still and pound into me until I start to choke, until my eyes water and drool runs down my chin, and I just kneel there and take it, would you like that John?”
“So what if I am? And who the hell do you think you are anyway, you cheeky little bastard?, my father owns this hotel, I can have you sacked you know…in fact I think I will”, he moved to get up but slumped back down again, legs turned to lead by a too- quick intake of alcohol.
“Will I get high from this?” he stammered, because he had to say something, anything to break the tension, because Sherlock was looking at him with a smug air of satisfaction, like he knew something that John didn’t. It was unnerving, being stared at by those eyes, that were too many different colours to count, and how could he know that unless he was staring back just as hard.
“My god, are you alright?” his heart was racing as the two of them tumbled back, John landing on his arse and the old man sitting heavily in his lap, the ignorant gits around them all acting like they hadn’t even seen an old man almost fall to his death on the train tracks.
Sherlock stiffened and drew a sharp breath that hissed over his back teeth (Kudos Mycroft, you have chosen well) as Sebastian grinned evilly at him.
I breathed a sigh as his arm slipped from mine, lingering for a moment to squeeze at my hand in a gesture of love and reassurance, before taking our place in the procession that led to the wide double doors, thrown open to the night. I came to see quite clearly, that in terms of our dress we had been most conservative, our only concession to the unconventional being the elegant masks that concealed our identity. Many others had gone much further than this, and I fully confess to the shock of it, to see men dressed as ladies and ladies as men, full elaborate costumes and finery which made me feel so dull in comparison, in raven black from head to foot.
John had just winked at him and said “I guess it adds character”, knowing very well that Sherlock had been the one to put it there.
He pulled John down for a messy kiss, the back of his thighs burning with the strain of the position, unfamiliar now.
She was already eyeing him appreciatively and holding out a delicate hand, French-polished to perfection, for John to shake.
This arrested John’s attention back to me, I was pleased to find, and he leant in closer, the brush of his leg against mine beneath the table causing my skin to burst afire. I supped anew to quell the dryness in my throat.
“At least the evidence I produce will be admissible in a court of law” Anderson retorted “unlike your ridiculous ramblings…who do you think you are Sherlock, bloody Nancy Drew for fuck’s sake?”
Not dead then , that was something at least, although it did just feel like he’d been hit by a truck, a solid six feet two inch truck with fists of steel. John sat for a minute, head cradled between his knees, as the scrawny jack russell licked enthusiastically at his ear.
Harry nodded in satisfaction at his stricken face “Well, I guess I’m going to say it anyway…I told you so”
They ate in silence, the only sounds, chewing and gulping. John found two chipped mugs in one of the cupboards and filled them with water from the kitchen tap, handing one to Sherlock.
“And take this as a warning Sherlock, if I catch you again, I’ll take you both in. Public indecency? Tut…tut…whatever would Mummy say” Greg gave a throaty chuckle as his footsteps retreated back the way they came.
John tried to twist round in the cramped space all too aware of how closely pressed together they were, wincing as a stack of old cleaning brooms clattered to the floor.
“Your turn”, said Victor, waving his empty bottle at Sherlock as the two girls that had been eyeing them up for the last half hour, finally got the message and moved away, disappointed.
Mycroft, as was to be expected, was highly amused, taking in Sherlock’s discomfort with his customary penetrating glare.
If John was waiting for the dawning light of realisation to shine in his eyes then he would be standing there for a bloody long time.
He was being deliberately provocative and rude, in the way normally reserved for…well everyone other than John to tell the truth. This affected air of indifference was so hard to maintain while his heart threatened to beat out of his chest. A cold sweat prickled at his skin and slowly ran down his back.
The look he received from the dark-haired boy was almost grateful as the passed through the portrait hole and crossed the common room, heading for the stairs that would take them to the sixth year dorms. The only other occupant in John’s room was a boy named Oliver Rose who was currently in the sick bay recovering from a close encounter with bubotuber puss. He wasn’t expected back in dorms before the end of term.
“Not to you maybe, and believe me, none of us have a fucking clue why that is yet – no offence mate – but the rest of the general population? Treats them like shit on his shoe, mostly”
John caught vague snatches as the door swung closed again, Sherlock seemed to have stopped hurling hospital equipment around but continued to shout at full volume, an impressive feat for someone, who half an hour ago lay motionless in bed.
“We do share a dorm you know?” Sherlock whispered darkly sending shivers down John’s neck and spine, and a few brief seconds felt like an hour as they stared each other down.
“Well, come on,” John said with a huff of disbelief, “you must know…he was being a massive knob back there. You shouldn’t let him treat you like that.”
“Yeah, but on his own…been following him for a least half an hour and the twink boyfriend aint here….Trent’s on the lookout though…he won’t get far…”
He had agreed not to see him until today, but the total lack of contact was owing to the fact that Sherlock was in trouble – yet again.
John lay nervous and tense, hands folded loosely across his chest, uncertain now that the roles were reversed and so Sherlock spread himself along his body, lying between John’s parted thighs, erections pressed together, smoothing the tension away with body heat and soothing strokes down his sides, kissing him softly.
"Nothing at all John, and I thought you of all people would appreciate the more conventional means of breaking and entering employed by muggles the world over…..besides, the lock has been protected against counter-charms, this is the only way to get what I want”
The true nature of the household having been revealed to me, and finding me not averse to this loose morality but conformable instead, my mistress sought to capitalise on what she saw as a tractable temper by releasing her flock to ensure resignation to my fate. Her design was to show the happiness of that little household and the life of great pleasure to be had therein. But I must confess even then, the wants and desires awoken in me by my most attentive and gentle bedfellow had caused the last of my modesty to melt away like dew in the summer sun, and besides, my fear of being cast out had made such a vice of necessity as to render refusal unconscionable and even if my cage door had been opened would have stayed.
That we were the subject of gossip too was brought to our attention on the morning of the third by our landlord. He met us upon the landing as we came back from a bath which we had shared, more water on the floor than in the tub by the time that we were done. We were stripped to the waist with only our drawers on when we were brought up short by his broad burly figure, clearly ogling us both in our state of undress. From the corner of my eye I could see John’s shoulders shaking with mirth as that good fellow grew hot in the face, not knowing who or what to look at next. He settled on my navel and the trail of dark hair below it.
Sherlock let go and bent himself fully over the back of the sofa now, thrusting back to meet John. He must be close now, exhausted, they both were, but he hadn’t touched his cock yet, and John’s fevered brain wondered if he had got it wrong again, virgin inexperience, that he should be doing more. Left hand back on Sherlock’s hip, he reached around that fragile pelvis and found Sherlock’s hot, heavy cock, bobbing, neglected. Already slick his palm slid up and down the length smoothly, pulling back the foreskin, flicking a thumb over the head, as Sherlock bucked and moaned frantically.
“Worked”, his tongue clicked against the roof of his mouth on the final letter, “You set the rules, I just followed, but it’s clearly over, so I’m just taking a small reminder”.
“May I?” I asked carefully, and crawling to the end of the bed I plucked the letter from his hand. I read it over, swiftly, finding it much as he’d said. Lady Watson had fallen ill but a week ago, and had now succumbed to a fever. The physician had attended and declared there was nothing further to be done but wait, and in her delirium she had asked to have her grandson at her side at the last. There was a still a small chance, but her fate now rested in God’s hands. “Will you go then?”
Just lube then. John twisted free of Sherlock’s grip, flipping onto his back and sitting up to rummage in the bedside drawer, his stomach clenching as fumbling fingers made contact with the tube he needed. He lay back down, leaving a little distance between their bodies as he flipped the cap and squirted a generous amount onto shaking fingertips, spreading it down his hot, heavy erection. The cool sensation, intensified without the usual latex barrier, made him suck in a breath, so close to the edge from Sherlock’s slow teasing that he wasn’t sure he would even get his cock in before he shot off.
He took a moment to really consider what had brought him here – his own base desires, true, but some distinctly more bitter lay underneath it all. John Watson, stalwart and loyal had suffered nought but trouble since the day he had agreed to look at a flat with a mad stranger (him) which he had only just met, and almost four years later Sherlock’s toxic presence continued to hurt the man he had come to….love.
Mycroft sighed and rolled his eyes, it hadn’t even been one week… and he had had such high hopes this time, but then this was Sherlock after all…
“Ha” So I see you have cause to doubt your young prince eh?  Kept you dangling while he cast his net in more bountiful waters did he! I thought as much boy, I can see it written all over your face.” His tone was mocking.
They were a wonder to behold and I longed to join them, turning my beseeching eyes on Tom, my former downcast spirits now fully revived.
Sherlock had run off somewhere, and his bath was likely turning cold, but damn, he had smelled so wonderful anyway when John had kissed him outside, like jasmine and fresh rain in springtime. He had half expected a punch and was elated that the boy had kissed him back and more besides. They just had get the chance to do it all again.
They stood, frozen as John strained his ears to hear, just catching the sound of footfall coming from the floor above and two voices, carrying faintly down the stairs. They were exposed here, standing in the empty, echoing foyer, only the Great Hall and the staircase lying between them and their imminent discovery.
, but which from this distance looked like an angry slash of black cut deep into the stone. John shivered. There was a definite something about this place, an unreal, almost dreamlike quality. Who knew what lay beyond that dark, gaping doorway? Well, Sherlock, for one thing, who had disappeared from view again, his lanky shape swallowed by impenetrable shadow. John held his breath for a heartbeat, ears straining to hear any sounds of movement from inside, and he let it all out in a huff of relief as Sherlock called to him with an impatient, “Oh do hurry up and come in John, before it starts to rain again.”
It was a turn-on, watching Sherlock struggle underneath him and John wondered what that said about him, this aggression, the willingness to hurt and be hurt, and whether it was always like this between two men, sex, hovering on the brink of violence.
Fell’s lips parted in a shocked gasp. “Your brother cares about you very much! I would not be here if he didn’t!”
“I’ve been great, Maggie. John, this is my neighbor Maggie. She lives across from me, and that’s her husband, also a Jon,” Bill said, giving Maggie a tight smile. “John and I were in the army together.”
“Sherlock Holmes! Speak to us! Speak to us now!” the medium cried, apparently deciding to give it another go.
“I think that would depend on who you asked,” Sherlock said, exhaling a cloud of smoke. He reminded John of a dragon, all long elegant lines and reptilian pale eyes.
“You like women who know tricks, my fine friends, I know just the place!” a jovial voice called out. A man of a very small stature with a cane emerged from the shadows behind them, grinning brightly. Fell couldn’t quite be certain, but he was almost positive a sloshing sound was coming from within the cane he carried. “Some of the best women in Paris who know all sorts of tricks.”
Her eyes had rolled back and they were glowing with a yellow light. Her head was pressing down against the back of her shoulders and her mouth gaped, a black hole in the flickering light. Noises escaped her that sounded like choking.
Gently, slowly he began to move down John’s body, pressing soft kisses down his jaw and neck, licking along the collarbone and pausing to nibble gently on each nipple, sucking and flicking with the tip his tongue until they stood firm and erect. John clutched at his head, fisting handfuls of soft dark curls as Sherlock worked him over until satisfied with the soft shivers and moans.
John cupped his face and turned Sherlock’s head to get the angle just right, swirling that hot, delicious tongue around his lips and mouth. He felt delirious, this couldn’t be real, no-one had ever wanted to kiss him this way, but yet here he was, Sherlock the freak with no friends, being thoroughly snogged by the most gorgeous boy he had ever seen, and even better than that, it was more than apparent that John Watson was thoroughly turned-on by him.
And so he did, trying not to focus on John’s pained grimace as he thrust firmly forward, almost halfway and eased slowly back, feeling the delicious drag and friction of the tight muscle against his cock.
He should have told him, told John then and there this morning, the fact that his only significant ex, the one who had broken his non-existent heart was back, and was asking to see him, but honesty had never been Sherlock’s strong point, and old habits die hard, as they say.
Sherlock ignored him and batted mama’s hand away, from where her fingers were twisting lovingly in his curls.
Sherlock bounded up from the sofa, legs in a tangle of quilt and John, and shoved him along insistently towards the bathroom, he grabbed the towels from the table on the way.
Weston sat back heavily, and only then deigned to look up, fixing me with a nasty sneer. “There is no business for you here,” he glanced at Tom, “you or your pimp.” Tom took a half-pace forward, deeply offended on my behalf, and began to protest, “Sir do not address him in that manner, I…” But I placed a warning hand upon his arm and he stilled again, the tension radiating out from him nonetheless. He must understand that to react with violence to such insults would be a grave mistake of which Tom have the worst of it should this interview turn sour. I did my best to appear contrite on his behalf.
“Of course, definitely” John shoved his hands down into his pockets felling inexplicably awkward. Sherlock turned to go.
“That’s not even the point Sherlock…. Did you even stop and think before you jumped right off the deep end? How the hell could you do this to yourself again? Christ, for someone who’s supposed to be so damn intelligent you can be incredibly fucking thick”
It was just supposed to be a look, a moment of voyeuristic gratification to take with him when he left, not a frantic fuck. Shit, he should slow this down, because Sherlock had all but told him that he had never done this before. But Sherlock, apparently had other plans, as always, and once that decision had been made he saw no sense in holding back.
Twenty minutes later, feeling not quite as composed as he could be, he locked his door before joining the gang in the corridor outside, praying none of them could read the explicit fantasy that had just played through his dirty mind.
He wished he could believe that himself. Moriarty was determined to recruit John to his gang and no-one ever dared to say no, well, everyone except John, and he had made his family a target because of his stubborn determination to go it alone. But working for Jim’s street gang meant doing jobs for Mr Magnusson too, breaking into the posh houses to steal papers and ‘secrets’, a dangerous game to play, cause it was harder to run if you got cornered in a house. He could blend into city streets quite well, and no-one ever seemed to notice a small, very ordinary-looking boy as he brushed by.
“Lawyers?....a more contemptable band of blaggards I have yet to find. It is a mistake to put too much faith in them and expect that their documents hold all of the answers and truths in the world….pardon me for saying so, your Mr Worthington seems a solid young man, but give him a year or too and he’ll be as crooked as the rest of them”.
“Into town, Holburn”. His eyes flicked away from mine unable to hold my gaze, thus confirming my suspicions.
John panted heavily, out of breath and right on the edge. What if someone had heard them? It would be pretty damn obvious what was going on in this room right now.
In the end it wasn’t so bad. The officers came to take statements, both of which were scant in detail on the actual crime because Sherlock had no recollection, and the perpetrator had fled the scene and disappeared into thin air before John made it back to the room. John’s only useful contribution he felt, was a description of the cleaner who had held him up for five minutes in the corridor, blocking the way with an industrial polisher for what now, in retrospect, was an unreasonable amount of time. A man, fifties, overweight, brown thinning hair and a lazy left eye, something they might have to ask him about again should it prove pertinent. Sherlock bristled at the suggestion of a sexual motive, a reasonable assumption given the fact he was naked at the time, but Mycroft intervened and the line of inquiry quashed for the time being.
“Let me take this off” John moved to unfasten the rotund belly and Sherlock’s hand shot out to stop him
And there, leaning against the bonnet of a sleek red Audi convertible, was Victor fucking Trevor, talking animatedly into a shiny black i-phone, obviously sobered-up now with a smug, irritating smile on his face.
“What else can I do? I thought about it. You got yourself in a mess again, and I’m going to help you get out of it. But one step at a time eh, I would be an idiot to believe you could kick this overnight, I know that you stupid arse, but that doesn’t mean I’m going to be all, yeah, fine ”
Greg had to snog the person on his left, which happened to be Molly who he obviously fancied rotten. She didn’t look too upset either and happily puckered up amid whistles and catcalls from the others.
He had a pretty good idea, and so it would seem, did Sherlock. And he wanted to, just to try, just so he could see, so he would know: and that would be okay, it really would, except now it was real and not just a fantasy in his head or a vague tingling of anticipation that something might happen. That brush of fingers as you passed by someone in a crowded club, a second glance, squeezing past and putting your and on their waist for balance. How many times had he slept over at a mates house, and lain there in the night, sweating and shaking and feeling like an arsehole because you really just wanted someone to turn over and touch you or just do something, anything, and you were crawling out of your skin with want and feeling like a perv cause these were your friends for fuck’s sake…. and then sad-wanking over pictures of the half-dressed pop star centre-fold in your sister’s Smash Hits mag, which you now had to hide under the bed because of the come on it, and buy her a new one pretending you spilt tea on the first.
“Then go to her,” I said in earnest, sitting up, sheets pooled around my waist, “Put your mind, and hers at ease.” At the next my voice was more hesitant, “And if you are amenable, please impress upon your father that I bear him no ill will…. and perhaps we may yet make amends with him. Is it not beyond hope that he might yet see reason?”
His eyes darted frantically, unable to move his head, taking in as much of the scene as he could, as his senses slowly adjusted to the absence of light. He couldn’t see shit, just vague shapes in the dark, a skip, industrial bins, maybe the vague outline of a door. Impatient feet shuffled in the darkness as a wide looming shadow detatched from the rest, the barest hint of a large bulky frame. The figure surged forward, fast for a man of his size, and reached out a heavily muscled arm towards him, hand clutching his jaw in a vice like grip as he twisted John’s head from side to side, huge sausage fingers digging in so tight he feared the bone could break as his teeth were forced into the soft flesh of his cheeks. He tasted the sharp copper tang of his own blood as it began to fill his mouth.
Or had he? Well, he had been the one doing the penetrating, not the other way round, but that still counted right? John was a little confused. Did it only really count as losing your virginity if Sherlock fucked him? He wasn’t sure. He would have to ask Sherlock that. Oh shit! He was gone wasn’t he? John had his number in his phone obviously, but there had been no goodbye this morning and they hadn’t made any further plans to see each other. But last night had been so amazing. Sleeping with someone he had only just met, especially when this time yesterday he had been obliviously heterosexual, was insane, but Sherlock was beyond beautiful and he had kept his promise and made it good for John. His phone was lying on the pillow, he was sure he hadn’t left it there earlier. John picked it up and switched it back on (he had definitely been avoiding Sara, at least subconsciously, several missed calls, guilt returning) The two most recent texts were from Sherlock. He opened them.
“Outside? Are you insane?” John hissed and then jumped in surprise as Sherlock’s finger pressed down against his lips, soft and warm
He dressed swiftly, pulling his nightshirt over his head and discarding it on the end of the bed. The ring he then hung on its chain against his chest, quickly covered by first shirt, and then waistcoat and finally a light linen overcoat.
John lurched forward, but Greg was quicker, grabbing his arms in a tight locking grip and pulling them behind his back. He struggled, grunting and wriggling to free himself, livid that Greg would do this to him when he wasn’t the one who had done something wrong, the rational part of his mind offline. Greg spoke low, growling into his ear from behind. John could feel the tight press of his body and the strength in his arms effectively restraining him and his feet scrabbled uselessly against the ground. It was his day job and he was bloody good at it. John was going no-where.
He paused then, wrestling with something in his heart and finally with a soft sigh of resignation leant forward and kissed me softly on the cheek. And with a last swift nod to John, and a flash of wonder in his eyes that he had not been thought to take liberties, he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him. We were alone.
A moment of instant sobriety cleared his mind as he pushed Sherlock out through the doors before they both ended up in a cell to cool off for the night. There was a definite pattern emerging here.
All he could see were John’s eyes, red and pleading, spilling hot, angry tears that he had never wanted Sherlock to see, and all he could hear, as loud as a gunshot was the sharp crack of bone as John destroyed himself at Sherlock’s hand
For his part, he continued his licentious course slipping down lower over the smoothness of my abdomen until he could twine his fingertips in the coarse curls which garnished my burgeoning manhood.
John inched forward, crowding him against the cold slippery tiles. His eyes raked over Sherlock’s body and he stood frozen, pinned by the intensity of his gaze as it flicked from his face, to eyes, to mouth, to jaw, to neck. He paused and ran wet fingertip over the jugular vein and Sherlock felt a tingle of hypersensitivity. A bruise then, he thought, shaped like John’s mouth. John’s eyes ran down his body and he felt exposed in the way that he usually made others feel, when he stripped them bare with his cut-downs and barbs.
“The last one to squeeze a noise like that out of Sherlock ended up in A&E, fuck, I wish I was eighteen again”.
“What the fuck Sherlock! That is NOT okay – what did I tell you the other morning about doing sneaky things to me in the general ‘arse’ area?”
“Damn it you bastard” he squirmed as John gazed down at him, amused, “What do you want, for me to beg you?”
Sherlock watched in amusement as John’s throat contracted, a “Nngh” sound squeaked out, then “ you are quite scarily upfront about kinky stuff… do you even have boundaries Sherlock?”
Sherlock’s long, slender arms slid around his body from behind as he stood, John’s back pressed against his naked chest, inhaling the sweet smell of lavender soap coming from his short blond hair. He could feel the slight press of two taught nipples on his shoulder blades, but whether that was from arousal or the air on wet skin, he didn’t know.
Get over yourself Watson, he’s not going to bite…well, not much…. but maybe just a little, he hoped, as he sauntered down the driveway doing little to conceal his spontaneous lop-sided smile. Two girls that passed by him stopped to giggle and stare. Oh god, smooth move you idiot. Girls, yeah, he had almost forgotten about those. If only his classmates could see him now – straight John Watson the most popular kid at school, a string of pretty girls in tow, falling in love for the first time with a bloke.
“Brother’s,” said I, “We are all brothers are we not? I can think of none here more fitted for the task”.
“Like a prisoner who waits for the axe to fall upon his neck…I would have hoped my brother would have found me by now, if he had been able. But there has been nothing. Truly, do you believe he would have left my life to the fates if he had been in a position to prevent it? If Lestrade was dressed in a robe and carried a scythe I would think nothing of it”.
The light assaulted my eyelids even when tight closed. I groaned, and pulled the covers up over my head which too hurt most abominably, a relentless pounding made worse with every breath I took. How I ever came to be here, I really could not answer. Faint memories swam across my mind of carriage rides, my head in John’s lap, his coat about my shoulders all the better to keep me warm, and kind hands that gently stroked and petted at my hair and down my shivering spine.
It was annoying when John just ignored him. Especially when trying his utmost to provoke a reaction. Anything was better than the high-pitched whine currently banging around in his skull. Sherlock rejected the chocolate bar, pushing it aside, lips pressed firmly in a thin line. He had managed the crisps, therefore, as far as he was concerned he was done. John just snatched it up angrily and stuffed it in the backpack instead, along with the flask of tea and two plastic bottles of water.
“No problem”, Sherlock smirked, taking a sip of his own and dunking a biscuit in, waiting till the tea soaked through before cramming it into his mouth, whole. “Oh, and he’s a top by the way”, he said through a mouthful of crumbs, wiping the back of his hand over his mouth before taking another, ”And I told him you’re a power bottom…I hope you don’t mind?”
John loosened the towel from around his waist and let it drop to the bed. He sat up on his knees and then dropped forward, hands supporting his weight , down on all fours.
He was balls deep now and John brought his legs up to wrap around him, arching to meet each thrust head thrown back against the pillows moaning incoherently, body slick with sweat, cock glistening with leaking fluid dark and flush against his body. Sherlock leaned forward slightly, sliding an arm around John’s back, their chests touching, John’s cock trapped between their bodies. He sucked deeply at John’s neck, feeling the heated blood rise to the surface, vessels popping and bursting under his greedy lips, hips thrusting faster and harder, shoving John further up the bed.
John sat, in his usual place, facing out into the restaurant, head bowed over the menu, even though by now they both knew it by heart. Force of habit then.
He nodded at John who continued, stoic and calm, “The other loser jumped me last weekend on the way home…it was a warning to Sherlock to lay off digging shit up on his boss…we think he might have been involved in massive fight at some club. The owners wife…we were just trying to look out for her, neither of us knew it would turn into a shit-storm”.
The minute he’d stepped through the door he knew it, the words ‘tough shit they were out of Twix I had to…’ dying on his lips, the cans and packets crashing to the ground as he’d ran, leapt, hurled himself across the room to the figure lying prone on the floor by the window. And still it felt like wading through treacle, taking just too long to get there, and scared of what he’d find when he did.
He sighed and rolled his eyes. Eating was boring, a pure mechanical exercise to fuel his transport, nothing more. Sherlock ate the bare minimum, because it was simply dull to sit there like a cow in a field chewing the cud.
“I don’t even know you anymore…it’s been too long…you can’t just come back and say stuff like that Victor…stuff you should have said back then”
‘Such an affectionate little thing he said you are, that will go very well with the gentlemen when you come to it my dear’.
“Bye then”, she walked slowly towards the door and paused with her hand on the handle, “Just…. don’t do something you might regret later John”.
It’s fine, its fine, the voice in his head repeated like a mantra, last night was good, it would be just as good again. Sherlock wanted to be with him, he didn’t care that John was new to all this, they could take their time, they had all night after all. He took another gulp of water and swished it around a little, wishing for toothpaste or mouthwash. He placed the mug down and watched silently as Sherlock pushed back his chair and moved around the table to stand in front of him.
And what of Irene? Betraying my misplaced trust to deliver me to a life of debauchery and corruption at the hands of a notorious bawd in return for pecuniary advantage?
He would spare them both the details here, needless to say there were a variety of interesting implements involved in the proceedings.
I cast my mind back to the night of the masquerade. The way she had looked at him, a smile here, a touch there, a simpering word, drawing him away. Uninvited touches, mocking glances. Knowing all the while where my heart lay, if not his, testing the strength of our attachment, the strength of which only served to fuel her desire for the chase. It had all been a game to her. She must have been there, concealed behind the curtain and heard our exchange… heard John’s declaration of love. It seemed my protector that night, Mr V, had the right of it, my self-confessed rival had won.
They pounded down the alley, skidded around the corner and continued on, away from the direction of the Amersham Arms. Sherlock’s long legs gave him the edge and John found himself pulled along in his wake, fighting for breath, lungs screaming.
‘And so…what say you Sherlock? Have you thrown yourself in with another bad lot? Do you think me a coward and a fool?’
Sherlock nodded, wandering over to his bedroom door and turning to wait as John stood and walked across the space towards him. His palms were sweating, the only outward sign of nerves as he ushered him silently in and closed the door behind them, blocking Greg’s view when he craned his neck to peek inside.
The driver got down to hand her into the carriage and they clambered up behind, sharing the seat opposite her. The drive back was wonderful, every jolt and sway pressed him up against John’s shoulder and leg. Sherlock bit his lip and looked out of the window to hide his blushing face with no idea why this felt as good as it did.
“You’re fucking mental” he gasped as they rolled over the cold damp ground. He looked up to see several worried faces peering down at them where they lay, mud-soaked and panting, Jim and the other lads had melted away into the crowd.
Sara cut him off – “Sherlock?” she said, incredulous, “What sort of ridiculous pansy-arse name is that?”
“When I woke, just now, you weren’t here…” Sherlock opened his eyes then and loosened his grip slightly, but still held on, needing the tangible feel of skin on skin to convince himself that John really was here, and he wouldn’t disappear again. “You can’t leave…you’re not fucking allowed to…not anymore”.
Sherlock had no idea why he was telling her this, an old woman, laden with bags from a recent shopping trip, but something about her calm steady gaze just invited confidence, and the words began spilling from his mouth.
He walked slowly towards the bed and sat down, and tried not to notice the smug look currently levelled at him.
“No. You made that about as clear as mud John, but then absolutely nothing about you seems to make any logical sense”.
‘A name, just tell me your name, that is all that I want’ he called, ever determined to satisfy what was more than mere curiosity.
“Perhaps”, John smiled softly, with something of sadness and longing in his eyes, “And it seems now that I am an orphan too …I wonder what is to become of us?”
But he could feel something else as Sherlock ground down against John’s thighs with his arse while he let out a soft little moan, writhing like a wanton tart.
He meant it, Sherlock could tell. He felt a thrill of excitement run through his body. It wasn’t just words, an idle threat, John would lay hands on that person, James Tanner, in pure unadulterated violence.
Maybe he should make the effort and go tonight, he’d done nothing but moon around the flat all week in between classes and his best mates’ patience had obviously worn thin. He shoved the pillows off his head and sat up with a groan, his body still stiff and sore. The bruises on his ribs had mostly turned a sickly green, but he didn’t need the painkillers anymore. Popping pills just made him think of Sherlock, abusing his body again. John hated that hazy feeling, like cotton wool in your head, and that idiot did it for fun? Living with a parent hooked on tranquilisers and an alcoholic sister kind of kicked any sort of urge to experiment right up the proverbial arse.
And then, as if to oblige my voyeuristic desires he sighed and stretched, rolling over onto his back as he did so, with an arm flung across his eyes to block out the light. He did not wake, chest rising and falling with the even measure of deep, contented sleep and so I was favoured with the full exposure of all his naked charms. It was a most perfect form. Such delicacy of complexion, such smoothness of skin, furred at the centre with soft blond curls the blushing peaks of two nipples poking above, erect from the night-cooled air. His limbs were so exact in shape and form, gently muscled arms to hold me tight, strong, firm thighs the power of which I had lately felt, the relentless delicious thrusting as he fucked me still fresh within my mind.
“Ah, awake at last master Sherlock? Your mama says to call you for breakfast and that you and she are going out this morning, so you’re to dress warm”
But could I? My desire not to disappointment bloomed strong, so I gritted my teeth and bore down, facing the pain and chasing it willingly, determined to submit to John’s pleasure whatever I foresaw I would cost me, misguided young thing that I was. John, however, had not taken leave of his senses as I had done, and seeing his lover, eyes clenched tight in agony, he halted, the head of his cock just barely within me.
“He would have more luck with Molly Hooper” Sherlock chipped in “but not with a rude picture, the old-fashioned way would work better…ask her for dinner, she would like that”
“You’re such a filthy pig John, you wouldn’t dare do that at home in front of mum”, his younger sister Harry, a second year, squeezed onto the bench beside him, back after a bitching session with Clara, her best friend.
John stared back wide-eyed. Sherlock couldn’t be serious, could he? John swallowed thickly. He felt a tight knot of anger in his chest but answered as calmly as he could. “Oh, you know – something about the way he touched you. He was pretty rough mate. I mean, look, he shoved you in the back, right between your shoulders, that must have
His heart began to hammer when he pressed send and a sick feeling spread from his gut and up his chest at just the thought of it, the buzz when it reached him, his face when he saw who it was from.
Sherlock had never said just where he had done this stuff, but it could hardly have been under Mycroft’s nose in his own sodding bedroom. Off your face meant careless, he already knew that from the bitter experience of an alcoholic sister and mother – go so far down that road and you abandon any attempts at hiding your vice from the people you love, he doubted whether Sherlock had been any different in this respect.
Sherlock breathed as he yanked John’s jumper off over his head leaving them both naked from the waist up. He shivered, “Bed?”
“You’ve just seen him fuck off with someone else. Listen John, save yourself the trouble, he’s just a desperate little slut. That kid should have a revolving door in his jeans, his dick’s in and out that often. I’d say you’ve had a lucky escape”
Sherlock was awake when he got back to the dorm, sitting propped against the head board with at least four fluffy white pillows behind his head.
“Not a bit, I just couldn’t help thinking how your mouth would feel, all warm and sweet compared to your cold lips”.
And to add to his problems, just this morning Mycroft had summoned him to the study, tight-lipped and tense, on his desk another plain envelope, much smaller than the last containing a small silver flash drive.
“Please Greg….I can’t….don’t” he stuttered helplessly, and Greg pulled off with a wet pop, cock slapping down onto his abdomen, hard and dark.
“Fuck off Harry, for god’s sake, you know that’s not how it works…I don’t have random gay nights…if I like, I like, end of”.
“Don’t you get scared though,” John said. “Out here at night, on your own, I mean? It is pretty isolated.”
So John kissed him again and it was different this time. He put his hands on Sherlock’s face and angled his head to the side, and then a hot velvet tongue was pushing past his lips into his mouth and swirling around inside. It felt so wonderful and strange to taste another person like this, and a boy besides, but it felt so very right.
Sherlock climbed the long staircase to his room, inexplicably nervous tonight. It felt different, it meant more, something had shifted in the last few hours, the balance had tipped and he no longer felt quite so in control. His mind was still racing, a heady mix of anger, lust, blood and John. He passed by the guest room, desperate to simply throw open the door and just take, breathless with just the thought of it, but he held back, it wouldn’t be right and this had to be right tonight…it just had to be…
Sherlock had no doubts as to the truth of this statement, financial ruin and social annihilation would be the least of the Wilkes’s trouble would they even dare to cross Mycroft again.
He coughed, nervously. ‘This aint no Molly-house lads’ he said, with an expression of real regret as he brought himself together and looked me in the eye, for we knew how things stood with him, ‘And people talk…namely, about those bonny young lads what are currently sharing a room that has only the one bed, which they are known to be currently sleeping in together and doing god knows what in…except I do know, he added, ‘having been there meself many moons ago’.
He did? John thought to himself. John often helped out behind the camera for various official school events. He’d picked up the skills from his mother, an artist and photographer who'd specialised in weddings and studio portraits. But John knew he’d definitely remember if Greg, the editor and head of sixth form, had asked him to do something like this, so the only explanation was that Sherlock was giving him some kind of an out, an excuse, however flimsy.
“Right mate….whatever you say….I’m not staying to watch you get your cock out….I’ll just help you pull your zip down, and here…” he placed one of Sherlock’s unresisting hands in front of him, so that he stood, unsteadily, braced against the wall “and try to aim straight cause mum and Harry’ll go apeshit if you piss on the floor”
James Tanner, school dickhead and bully. He was a thick as pig- shit, inbred, homophobic lowlife. He had singled Sherlock out at the beginning of the term as the lucky recipient of his own particularly repellent form of abuse. Usually he just ignored it, treated him with the contempt he deserved.
“And Sherlock…Just so you know… I’m going to make sure that bastard knows exactly what he’s missing out on…I’ll take great pleasure in rubbing it right in his smug fucking face….the fact that he can’t have you” John added, voice rough with suppressed emotion.
Sherlock had warned him more than once in the last few days that this would be inevitable at some point, that if their paths didn’t cross by chance then Victor’s own curiosity would cause him to seek John out and posture, like two stags in a rut competing over the territory that was Sherlock.
Sherlock bites John’s lip and palms him between his legs, just to remind him they only belong to each other now.
He nodded and hummed in the right places, just enough to convince the man in front of him that he was listening and not actually scoping every suit that entered the room, his stomach tied in a thick knot of jealousy. He was so far out of his depth here, amongst the Armani and Westwood and Paul Smith, amongst the trust-fund kids and old money, and the women dripping in jewellery expensive enough to pay off the average mortgage.
“Tell me again of how it shall go tonight”, I asked, as John reached out for the soap on a shelf by our side and I fished between my legs in the water for the washcloth.
And just as we were to enter, with John standing close at my side, a footman rushed up, near breathless from exertion and John paused, frowning while he waited for the lad to calm himself and spit his message out.
It sounded so stiff and formal and just plain weird. Intrigued , John turned to see a breathtakingly beautiful young woman, dressed like a nineteen forties movie star, blood red lips and perfectly rolled hair pouting flirtatiously as her eyes traced over every inch of Sherlock. John felt a clenching in his chest and narrowed his eyes in annoyance.
“Hungry?” John asked hopefully, ravenous now in a different way, not expecting a positive response. Sherlock’s eating habits, he had noticed, seemed erratic at best.
Sherlock nodded his assent and moved up the bed to kneel beside him, resting his hands lightly on the top of his thighs, as he waited for John to pull himself together and unbutton his bloody pants. He fumbled like a teenage boy who hadn’t worked out the mechanics of a front-fastening bra, ready to rip the damn button off if it didn’t slide through the hole this time. They pushed the heavy wool together, down Sherlock’s thighs.
His lungs felt too small as he tried to draw breath, like trying to suck in air through a drinking straw, a lot of effort for not much reward. He stumbled forward blindly, reaching out for Sherlock’s arm as he surged across the crowded dance floor, the most direct route to the bar. (if they got separated in here they would never find each other again). It was unlike anything John had experienced before, easing past gyrating dancers, same-sex couples snogging and groping openly, hands caressing his back and his arse as they made their way through, cheeky winks, the odd squeeze that made him yelp in surprise. Sherlock kept glancing back at him, checking to see he was okay, laughing at the stunned expression on his face, utter shellshock. Sherlock on the other hand, looked in his element, shimmying expertly around the tight press of sweating bodies, batting off wandering hands playfully, pointing at John when someone tried to go a little too far, mouthing ‘sorry, I’m with my boyfriend’ as John’s chest swelled with pride. They made it to the bar in one piece, John the slightly more ruffled of the two, he pushed nervous fingers through his hair and smoothed down the creases in his t-shirt.
Irene pouts as she lies beside him in her underwear. She kicks her long legs up into the air and holds them there in a shoulder- stand on the bed, wiggling her perfectly painted toes.
“I’ll bloody kill that bloody Glen for giving my address to Mark’s fucking smackheads” she said, more to herself than to them,
The sound of a door banging closed below and the bellow of a female voice, his mum home from work made them spring apart almost guiltily, Sherlock half-rolling onto the floor at the same time as John attempted to clamber over him. With an “oof”, he fell to the carpet, John sprawled across his legs as each tried to rise at the sound of footsteps on the stairs.
“Spare room probably” John answered, taking the cup from Sherlock, he refilled it and handed it back, “just till I tell her, I don’t want to give her a fucking heart attack”
‘I confess it, the soft curves and breasts of a woman are but a half-empty glass in a desert, your thirst is slaked but for a short time while you are slowly dying for want of more’
John was aware of the note of disappointment in his voice at the sudden lack of stimulation, however inadequate it had been, as Sherlock flopped down in front of John, turned onto his side and tugged at John’s arm, urging him to mirror his position, John’s chest pressed to his back.
“We will be happy, I will make it so. Never doubt what I feel and what I would not do to see you in health and comfort. I know we are but boys, but I will be a man for you, always, for none has ever touched my heart so deep and so true”.
Rubbing at my eyes, I stretched my legs out with a wince when Sarah came back to light the lamps that evening.
“You’re late,” Sherlock said, his deep voice calling down from the window above. He was wearing a mask again and this time it was a dark floral baroque sort of pattern that reminded John of bad wallpaper.
The late hours took their toll on John and he overslept. He hadn’t noticed through his excitement the night before that he was exhausted. His bones ached with it, pulling him into a numb, coma-like slumber he couldn’t shake. Even when he woke, he stayed in bed, groggy and contemplative. His first thought upon opening his eyes was to call Sherlock but what would he even say? Was he overreacting? He lay staring at the ceiling, thinking over what had transpired the night before.
“Maybe some other time. Just because it’s so late, I’d probably fall asleep before you even started. I want to be able to enjoy it,” John said, his voice going soft and gentle.
He couldn’t help but notice the lingering, worried looks that Billy gave Gideon as they maneuvered him onto the examination table. The lad was really very thin and had an almost feminine way of moving. Billy continued his manic chatter as he reached out and assisted his lover in taking off his outer jacket. “But, er, listen, sir. We’re a little short on cash-”
On the dim streets of Paris, where heeled boots and carriage wheels echoed and the setting sun cast long shadows where temptations could linger, a tall, thin man in dark clothing walked, accompanied by a stout fellow in white clothes. They were a study in night and day. The shorter of the two men had pale, white-blonde hair and, despite being under orders not to draw attention to himself, he was attired in a pale suit that was several years out of fashion and more than a little shabby. His blonde hair fluffed up like a halo around his round face. As he spoke, his hands were wringing together in a worried frenzy.
Their rooms in Sweden had been dimly lit the night before that fateful walk, which made John’s memory of that evening all the more foreboding and haunted. Holmes had perched himself in a chair, with his behind on the top, balancing with his feet planted on the seat, puffing away at his pipe like some dragon on a mountain, his mind hoarding facts like gold.
“No. I’ve been calculating how much money we’ve wasted on charlatans and magic acts. There is no contacting the spirits, Violet. Once the dead are departed, they do not return,” John told her firmly. He truly didn’t mean for his tone to be so snappish, however she ought to know-
- Not beta'd or Britpick'd, and for once this is a gift for me, not Mags. I work in a medical environment in the US so I've been under a lot of stress lately, so the medical aspects of this are based off what I've experienced and might not be true in other areas of the country or world.
“Of course. I would be happy to oblige you.” She let her hands slide over his body. “In many, many ways.”
He has occasionally found it a necessary tool for cases. It smooths the way, opens previously locked doors and makes people that otherwise would not be helpful relinquish useful information. However, he considers that attempting to turn that skill on John would be dangerous in more ways than one.
Sherlock tries to catalog the sudden onslaught of sensations. The curling of that searing, hot serpent tangling itself through his muscles, around bones and squeezing vital organs. Things shattering and hemorrhaging from the pressure. Heat eviscerating his insides, the chemical cascade confusing pain for pleasure, sending little electric shocks radiating through him. Tension in muscles he'd forgotten he had as his body tries to contain the damage. Swelling as blood pools form in his lower half from what must be internal bleeding. Blood rushing away from the brain so fast that his vision is going gray.
Yet, it’s there in her eyes for anyone that looks close enough. I stare at her face a long time, a familiar uneasy sense of wrongness taking root in my gut. Her big, deep, innocent eyes tell the truth that is carefully shuddered behind a determined stoicism. Beneath it all, she is
Sherlock nods slowly. It is difficult to shift his way of thinking but, no matter how fixated Moriarty and The Game Master had become on him, it now seems illogical to believe they would not have had similar ambitions in a world where Sherlock did not exist. He feels another part of that darkness clinging to him slide away.
Sherlock’s breath catches and they are being drawn together; perfectly paired particles held in a state of quantum entanglement propelled by the overwhelming forces of attraction.
causes me headaches. He takes another step towards me. His head is tilted to the side quizzically, as if I'm suddenly fascinating. I'm not sure what he sees as he slowly draws closer. It sets my nerves tingling with danger. The scent of him rolling over me like the oppressive atmosphere before a storm; both subduing and agitating. I'm suddenly reminded of the last conversation we had; Sherlock's request that seemed to reveal...
“Alright. Just like that.” The camera pulls back as it is handed to someone else. The man with kind, blue eyes, blonde and silver hair and military posture gives a warm, slightly nervous smile.
“No. You never remember, as far as I have deduced.” Sherlock sighs. He has often wondered if it is a small mercy for John to forget the truth and only be driven forward by what seems like his own internal compulsions. Sherlock is cursed by memories. Too many memories. A vast accumulation of devastating failures and glorious successes with John that forever haunt him.
"Of course," he says flatly, but they continue to stare at each other. Some sort of silent conversation is happening, and I can't take it.
“Ah, you found your words.” He strains as they start down the stairs and he has to work to counterbalance the gangly detective to keep them both from pitching forward and tumbling head first. “I was just getting used to finishing whole sentences,” John laughs. Sherlock’s head sags against his chest and lulls from side to side.
the arrogant bastard I know and-” He stops short, startled by what he'd almost said. He glances at Sherlock, who is sprawled out with his eyes still closed. He makes no sign he heard or was following what John almost said.
Sherlock's lids slowly peel open. His eyes immediately affix to John. They're radiant, light blue flames searing into him. He's pinned to the spot for a moment, completely mesmerised. It takes all his restraint not to blurt out all the words that he'd so carefully planned since they parted, or, at the very least, tell him once again how spectacularly gorgeous he is. That's unlikely to go over well when Sherlock is just barely conscious from an injury
makes John pulling on this persona in this moment feel as false as Sherlock pretending to be a priest. John's voice drops lower to be more soothing. “We’ll just ignore it and it'll go away after a bit once you relax,” he says, with his mock confidence.
out of earshot, of course... In fact, I told John that second time you ran off on him - left him alone while you went off with the serial killing cabbie - I said
“When I awoke we were in… well, it must have been your bed chamber. I was…” Sherlock closes his eyes and takes a steadying breath. “Your arm was on my chest over where my wound had been but… the positioning was as if you’d collapsed from kneeling beside me… I was covered in your blood. As if you had-” Sherlock makes a motion; miming slitting his wrist then turning it down so the blood would pour out. “You were dead. I… I was confused- young- had never seen death so close and… admittedly, I panicked and fled. I told no one of the incident… I watched the death rituals for your from afar. And after that day, I discovered that precisely fifty seven minutes after I am clinically dead I rise again.”
For a moment Mycroft doesn't respond. The gaze he has fixed on me is cold and analytical; as if he's weighing and measuring me against a thousand rubrics in a flash. His expression betrays no clue to his stream of thoughts or the conclusion he reaches.
can possibly come of this. Especially since every time he looks at John his mind scrambles, his heart thunders and he feels his natural defenses melting away like ice cream beneath a warm summer sky.
Sherlock peeks over his knees and see John's eyes scanning over his frame for injury, horrified by the idea of having harmed him in some PTSD fueled night terror. Finding no visual indication of physical harm but taking in his crumpled, trembling form, John's face plunges into mortification. “Oh, God, I didn't -” He looks down at his own groin, apparently fearful he had become aroused in his sleep and tried something sexually aggressive with the man pinned beneath him.
Sherlock flinches, as if he expects John to strike him, but doesn't move to stop John from wrapping his arms around his thin, shaking frame and pulling him close. John is shaking too as it all crashes down on him.
"Sherlock," I gasp, the truth of who is kissing me hitting me at the same time that his name leaves my lips. "You're - What are you doing?"
“My last vision before I died that first time was you arriving by my side as I bled out… cradling me to your chest with a look like… like the sun had fallen from the sky.” Sherlock risks a glance at John. John's mouth is agape like he wants to say something but can’t. He snaps his mouth shut and shakes his head back and forth.
Mycroft would likely scoff and dismiss Sherlock as being overly dramatic for such thoughts but, in this moment, Sherlock doesn't care. He's wet, miserable, and emotionally drained. He has every right to be a bit maudlin about life right now.
... what I really want to do is to grab him by the hair, jerk his head back, and suck on that place on his neck that made his breath hitch.
“Alright, clear off! You’ve places to go, people to see.” Lestrade ushers Sherlock to the staircase and gives him a pat on the back, remaining on the landing as Sherlock jogs down the stairs. “Oh, you needn’t go to NSY later. I know Hopkins would be happy to see you but, after John’s little impromptu performance, he didn’t have such free run of the place to arrange something. Nearly got himself and that Stamford bloke sent to the mental ward.”
look for Kali, but he must have done, because I hadn’t come home to a body and there’s been no more attacks.
Like Moriarty, The Game Master’s carefully orchestrated scheme was to force the impossible choice; to make Sherlock
John thrusts forward his lips and narrows his eyes in an expression of irritation. “Yeah, I didn’t much like it either but I had to get us out of there before the police arrived.” He shrugs, the anger sliding away as quickly as it had come on. He settles into something darker, brooding, his shoulders slump a little as he leans forward, looking at the floor.
Sherlock's fingers twitch at the hem of his own blue robe. Even the silk feels like too much against the painfully needy flesh below; too soft, cool, and not the right texture. The memory of thick, callused fingers tracing the lines of his body replays across his flesh. Everything is throbbing. He shudders. The beginning of something much more humiliating, like a whimper, is working its way up his chest to his tightly sealed lips. He sways on the spot, crushing his eyes closed in an effort to recalculate; take in this new information and recalibrate. Instantly he sinks into his Mind Palace.
John's hands; strong and warm. John's hands with calluses from playing rugby. John's hands that know the shape of his skull and how to make his body tremble with overwhelming pleasure. John's hands that know the tempo of Sherlock's pulse dancing under their fingertips… that once traced fire over his cheek and pulled him in for a kiss, that stroked softly against his lips, that pressed in, that know the swirl of his tongue against their pads, that moved against his tongue-
Sherlock stares at him blankly and then walks to the bed, sitting down on it. It's been cleared of the suitcase which is now zipped and sitting in the corner. The towel that was below it has also been removed and the covers have been turned back. Sherlock wonders if John expected to have to haul him to bed as he had needed to for the bath. He can't comprehend why John is going to all this effort for him.
, though.” He winks at her and her cheeks flush a lovely pink. Her laughter is like everything about her, soft and shy. He will have to be gentle with her, which really isn’t
mistakes. He finally lifts his head and slides out of the booth. He tosses a large bill onto the table;
purposes. He’d been so stupid and selfish and Sherlock had every right to hate him for using his weakness against him in such a cruel way.
Committed to his new experiment of attempting to acclimate himself to intimacy with John, Sherlock waits four days after the first incident to initiate contact. Exposure is the key; without threat of full engagement. He needs time - time to be close to John whilst observing and adapting his reactions at his own pace. It is a fine line to walk, but he tries to embrace the challenge as he would any reconnaissance for a case, and looks for the right opportunity to present itself.
He feels the panting of hot breath against his neck, as it had been in the coffin. The breathing is uncertain, but clearly desirous. Sherlock can't go as deeply with his fingers in this position, but he can still make himself believe that those fingers are John’s. John's fingers wouldn’t be as long his own anyways.

A spark flashes across the back of Sherlock’s brain and he dashes off to the little lab in Bart’s basement.
; punching and shooting bad guys with that hatefully adorable sparkle in his eyes and that arousingly reckless half smile on his face.
Concluding there is nothing more to be gathered in his room, he rises, slips on a housecoat and cautiously exits towards the kitchen.
“Perhaps... There’s a reason the message was there at the bank..." He taps his leather clad finger to his lip, staring off into the distance. "
"Whoa.. um.." John steps back but Sherlock's hand darts out to grasp his ankle and hold him in place. "Um. Ok…" John mumbles, heat beginning to crawl from his chest to his cheeks. His heart is pounding. Sherlock is pushing up the cuff of his pajama bottoms to examine his ankles.
"Yes and I can identify a rugby player by the calluses on his left hand and brief physical contact with his musculature," he says stiffly without looking up. His skin is flushing even hotter at the memory of blurting out that deduction when John's hand caressed his cheek. He tightens his jaw and forces the air slowly in and out of his constricting chest. He diverts his eyes to the window and tries to focus on the city zipping by. They must be getting close now. This cab ride has taken a small eternity. This is torture.
It is maddening that he can't focus and he is rougher than needed with John; his nails digging into the flesh of his back and the meat of an arm out of frustration.
He opens his wardrobe and takes out pajama bottoms and a t-shirt. He moves to the dresser and pulls out some new pants. He slips into his clothes quickly, instantly feeling more like himself.
“We're going to get you patched up, Private McDonnell.” As Watson crouches to lock the boy in a reassuring gaze he finds the young man's eyes wide with terror and awe. He is gazing over at an empty corner, his lips moving soundlessly in something like
John grins, only partially because of Sherlock's indignation and the other part for him now showing none of the previous signs of panic.
“We’re going to see Sebastian.” I look over at him and he is staring at me with an expression that has opened up just enough to have a little softness and sadness on the edges. “Need to learn more about what Van Coon was into that might have lead to someone wanting to murder him. The tactics… defying security at the bank and the flat, getting into a locked room - had to be a professional job. ”
It takes Sherlock several minutes before he realises that John never removed his pants. He'd simply sat him in the water, briefs and all. Sherlock shimmies out of them and hangs them on the faucet to drip dry. He's feeling better, warm and sleepy but functional - no longer at death's door. He pulls the plug to drain the water and stands, turning on the shower to rinse the suds off of his body. He then decides to wash his hair as well, buying time before he has to deal with John.
Yet, no matter how much John tried to rationalize that persistent hunger out of existence, the feelings had only intensified with every mind-blowing deduction, every adrenaline-fueled chase across rooftops and every quiet, scotch-tinted evening sitting by the fire exchanging stories and witty banter with the marvel of a man. That fierce desire for
... it was possible that there were some half-conscious moments where he’d let his feelings be known. He lowers his head letting out a long breath.
Sherlock’s eyes remained shielded but beneath their forced blankness John thought he saw a hint of uncertainty, confusion and impatient need.
…. Whatever you're doing…” Giving in to him will ruin everything we're trying to do. The mission - the whole blasted facade. Even if we don't get caught, it's sure to ruin
He turns and his eyes find the figure he hadn't previously noticed in the corner. He is instantly struck by its beauty. It is a work of art, full of impossible contrasts; skin like flawless white quartz set against stark black hair. Plush lips and oval face punctuated by sharp cheekbones and nose. Wide, almond-shaped eyes that are piercing in their intensity and brightly burning, like the sun reflected on the surface of the ocean.
is rude, arrogant, dismissive and, in general, repels anyone with a shred of dignity or modicum of self-preservation... Which you'd know if you hadn't spent over half the time in my presence inebriated." Sherlock appears furious; teeth gritted and head held high with fists balled so tightly at his side that he's probably hurting himself. John is learning, though - learning Sherlock's tactics like he would learn an opposing team's pattern of defense. John tips his head to the side slightly.
, then." When Sherlock's eyes slide to John, he already has a humoured smirk on his face and a spark of playfulness in his eyes, which he tops with a waggle off his eyebrows. For a brief, glorious second Sherlock's lips twitch into a crooked smile before he suppresses it. His expression hardens again, all the light going out of his eyes.
I shake the idea off and sink further into my coat. I'm just a pawn, anxiously watching the pieces shuffle around me, incapable of discerning their strategies. It’s useless to imagine that I can work out what either of them is aiming at when I can see so little of the bigger picture.
and he at last admitted to himself that there was never going to be a time when he did not put Sherlock before
The door buzzes again, making Sherlock jump, and Hopkins sighs and rises to walk to it. She chats with the man in the doorway quietly and then shakes her head and shuts the door behind him. She scratches at her eyebrow as she slowly returns to stand by the table.
accent of yours or…” John’s grin widens and his eyes have not left Sherlock’s lips, that are starting to burn and tingle at the intense interest. After an eternity, John’s eyelashes flutter. He licks his lips and looks up into Sherlock’s eyes from under heavier lids.
John. He's killed before. Has a reputation, or he wouldn't have left the calling card." In his excitement he's moving towards me again, eyes wide with the thrill of working it out. "The origami flower. He'd staged a perfect suicide, why leave evidence? Why leave clues? Unless..."
I look down at his hand that is reaching for the handle of the taxi. I'm struck by a surge of panic as I realise that something is happening here -
in his personal space, looming over him. Watson hadn't even heard him move. For a moment he is just caught within this stranger's gaze. His eyes are breathtaking, dark blues and greens, slivered with ribbons of such pale blue that it is almost white, like snow capped mountains or great, churning, foam topped waves of the ocean. They are intense and knowing. Watson peels his eyes away, clears his throat, and steps away to get a closer look at the patient.
He forces his mind back to the task at hand. He feels fuzzy around the edges and pain is gnawing on the back of his brain. Distantly he wonders how he can find something that is missing when he doesn't even know the shape of it. It has disappeared as if it
“I have a terribly dark and demented mind which I have endeavored to fill with every manner of fact about the worst misdeeds of humanity... You're the
It was slow going. He exhausted easily and everything took more time with limited mobility in his left arm. He ultimately spent three weeks packing and making arrangements. He gave most of the possessions to charity, then took himself to a little bedsit. He wanted to move back to Baker Street, but so much had happened. Sherlock had never come to him in the hospital nor sought him out after discharge. There were no texts, no phone calls, no indication that he wanted contact with John at all. So he had to believe that Sherlock needed his space or perhaps was too busy cleaning up the remainder of The Game Master’s scheme.
“I shot him,” Sherlock says flatly a coldness curling into his limbs and making his teeth and fists clench.
“I don’t know, Sherlock,” John responds calmly. His voice is hollowed out and he is still gazing at the fire. “Honestly, I don’t know why you even proposed this. What sort of
For a moment he says nothing and I think I really might have to tackle him and hit him. Exposing my needs like this, then shuting me out to deal with it on my own, is a whole new level of cruelty.
familiar, yet it now has slipped from your mental grasp... I've forgotten something. I can feel it but..." Sherlock frowns down at his own lap.
“Not exactly,” Sherlock sighed. “But I do like it. It’s quiet out here, I can think, and it’s large enough to practice in should I wish to. And I’m the only one who gives a damn about the place so why shouldn’t it be mine?”
“Exactly mate” Greg nodded enthusiastically as he knicked a piece of John’s toast, pulling a face a the sweet taste of inch thick strawberry jam.
“You’re good, better than good really, but you hide at the back of the room, like you don’t want anyone else to notice you….why?”
Sherlock shoved his hands deep into his pockets, clenching his fingers against the cold. It wasn’t like him to forget his gloves on a day like this and he missed the touch of soft black leather against his skin. His knuckles knocked against the hard outline of his phone, and he drew it out, even though it hadn’t made a sound all day, obstinately silent, no word from Lestrade yet on the new development in the Cromwell Court theft case. No word from John either. He had slipped back into the domestic routine so easily, only accompanying him to crime scene’s a couple of nights a week, and always at the clinic during the day, making up for the time spent nursing him after the shooting in June. Mary had a hand in this too, he knew that, had anticipated this exact scenario, John slipping out of his life and into a new one as husband and father-to-be while Sherlock and solving crimes faded into the background.
“Yes you do…you just tried to steal from me, unsuccessfully I might add, but I could point you in the right direction if you’ll accept my kind offer, that is…so how about it?”
He kept walking, head down, and increased his pace to just short of a jog. The car followed and sped up slightly before gliding to a halt twenty metres or so ahead. The rear passenger door popped open.
Greg beamed approvingly “Good to have you back John, cause the little shit never listens to me…and you…” he rounded on Sherlock once more “ this time use your bloody key, or Mycroft’s installing bullet proof glass in your little escape hatch…okay?”.
He pushed the denim down, and the cool waft of air on his thighs was like a dam breaking, as lips mashed together in a frenzy of tongue and teeth and five fucking years of needing this again, brought to its inevitable conclusion. John was laughing, and Sherlock was too, pulling off clothes and desperate to be naked, on each other like horny animals in mating season.
And a second too late Sherlock realised what he’d just implied. John could see it in his face, the way his eyes widened and how his mouth snapped shut, and then he was moving fast, scooting away from John’s side, backing across the mattress to get some distance between the two of them. Because somehow during the course of their short conversation, casually sitting a respectable distance apart had changed to shuffling a little closer and leaning in a bit more on the pretext of hearing the other speak, without either being fully aware they were doing it.
The stupid annoying git looked even more ridiculous than usual as he attempted (and failed) to look cool, smoking one of father’s Cuban cigars. He was irritatingly smug in the knowledge that he would not be the one forced to let a perfect stranger sleep in his bed,( not that anyone would want to anyway)
(Come on Watson, for fuck’s sake, you can’t just hover in uncomfortable silence, you had your cock inside his arse last night).
The morning dawned bright and crisp, the promised frost staining the dirty roads white, as dazzling a day as you would ever get in London at Christmas time.
He thumbed through his contacts for Greg Lestrade’s number, no time to worry about whether he was doing the right thing, “It’s John, any chance of a lift mate?”
“I love him you know, just in case you were wondering…but don’t worry he’s never said it back, not to me…I don’t think he knows how to love…just takes what he wants and fuck the consequences”
“Then why come here at all? Why say those things you said? You’re a fucking liar John, and the worst kind of bloody hypocrite….so Fuck You!”
“You’re an idiot then Sherlock” he said, voice sounding much more composed than he felt, “Did you really think I was just going to punch you, fuck you up against a wall and then just walk away again?”.
“What does that matter Lestrade….I explained how the paint on the victim’s clothes could only have come from the warehouse on Maxwell Farm Road….unreliable?....what do you mean inadmissible? Anderson could have searched until next year and he wouldn’t have come up with that……listen Lestrade….you either take my word or…..well on your head be it…..your ‘team’ are a bunch of fucking imbeciles” he stabbed at the screen and threw the phone across the room, where it knocked a stack of papers from the desk onto the floor.
He would just have to suffer in silence or perhaps have a tactical wank before John climbed back through his bloody window.
“What the hell do you need Dutch courage for?” Mike looked suspiciously sheepish and John almost face-palmed right then, the earlier comment now made perfect sense.
He wanted to, but he didn’t, a sick masochistic need. The whole situation just too fucking weird, the wife the kids, it was a bad, bad idea….
He didn’t add the element of personal acquaintance to his statement, because John remained at present, thankfully unaware.
“Well on that bombshell….. you can go first then ….” John pulled him out into the corridor, and pushed him into a cramped little room, away from eight pairs of accusing eyes. Sherlock staggered a little and banged his shin on precarious stack of old office chairs, then raised his head and looked slowly around, taking in his surroundings with a mild sense of panic in his gut.
John’s ‘lying through his back teeth’ face – Sherlock would recognise it anywhere, as in ‘no Inspector, I most certainly did not threaten this low-life criminal with an illegal army-issue handgun’.
Mycroft’s unctuous tone rang across the hallway. As if this was just some chance encounter, thought Sherlock. He had been hoping to avoid any further sight or sound of Mycroft today. This morning in the car had been bad enough, listening to his patronising drivel. He didn’t care that Mycroft knew what he had been doing last night, having sex. Mycroft always knew, one way or another. The point that really annoyed Sherlock was , how could Mycroft possibly know how he felt, and what right did he have to make him feel so cheap and disgusting? (Well, probably a significant right on that last point he conceded grudgingly).
Sherlock gasped as John pulled out a bit too quickly and took his hand away from his cock. His whole body seemed to throb with the loss, arse empty and so fucking cold. But John turned him around then, placed hands on his shoulders and pulled him in, warm, and solid and real, a violent kiss to punish him, an oral attack, he wanted Sherlock to give in. He felt the cut re-open again, and tasted the copper tang on John’s tongue.
“Look at that fucking sucker on your neck Homo, Jesus Christ you’re such a dirty fucking queer” the idiot leered as he came up behind him.
“You lot go on ahead, I’ll catch up in a minute,” said John, sweat beading his forehead from a brutal after-school rugby practice. He kicked off his sodden muddy boots and groaned, his knee caps clicking as he bent at the waist to pick them up.
John rubbed his hands vigorously through his short blond hair and a wild spray of droplets splattered the surfaces around him, some landed, to Sherlock’s satisfaction, on Mycroft’s impeccable, crisp-edged silk shirt leaving a dark stain on the light blue material. He snorted loudly at Mycroft’s expression of shocked incredulity before returning to gaze impassively out of the window, catching a cheeky wink from John in the reflection of the tinted glass.
“That bad huh? You know, my Dad used to hit me sometimes, when he was tired, or pissed or just plain couldn’t stand the sight of me or my little brother”
“Like getting the hell out of here now and seeing just how fast I can get you out of that fancy suit and make you see stars…..”
A harried young maid took our hats and coats, and I for one was glad to be relieved of them, my shirt adhering to my back with a faint sheen of sweat from the residual warmth of the day. But the rooms at least proved cool and airy, the sashes pulled up to take advantage of the breeze, drapes billowing like the sails of a ship into the open space. The dining room was laid out in full, the large oak table set for twelve at my reckoning, a large party indeed for mid- week, and there, in the chairs by the fireside sat the portly old dowager and her pretty young charge.
“Bossy” John chuckled as he bent his head to Sherlock’s cock and sucked him down deeply with all the enthusiasm of man denied his heart’s desire for far too long, which he had if you thought about it, even though the one who had denied it was him.
The room was light and airy with a pleasing prospect on the west side, over the square, but I was to see none of it. As soon as I stepped over the threshold John clicked the lock upon the door and turning, caught me up in his arms. If I had been a maid I am sure he would have lifted me from the ground, but I bested him in height by four inches or more and so we tripped and stumbled our way across the room kissing with a hunger born of desperation until I felt the press of the bed at the back of my thighs. He laid me down and kicking my legs apart a little, settled himself between them, his body pressed to mine, chest to chest, and bending, continued his glorious assault upon the soft, untouched skin of my neck. He licked and bit and sucked from clavicle to jaw while his hands held me steady, sure fingers twined into my errant curls. Oh the piteous little whimpers and moans which issued from my lips at this exquisite torture that defied all attempts to describe with mere words. The rough and smooth of a hot tongue sent spasms of fire and ice along every nerve and fibre as I shivered at the cooling wetness he left upon the surface of my skin.
“Really?” Sherlock stared up at the garish neon sign, incredulous, “That, is a fucking travesty, a gross abuse of the English language”
Sherlock’s brow furrowed as he thumbed through his phone with his right hand, flipping back and forwards compulsively. He raised a cigarette to his lips with his left, sucking in his cheeks to drag deeply as he inhaled, holding the smoke in his lungs before tilting his head to the side a little to exhale. He rubbed his left thumb absently at the corner of his mouth, cigarette still poised between his fingertips.
John was buzzing, and not from the large amount of alcohol he had just poured down his neck. No, the real reason was, that for the first time in god knows how long he had successfully got one over on Sherlock Holmes.
“Ah! Fuck!” Sherlock jerked reflexively, pulling up his left leg to give John easier access, cradling it to his chest, whimpering softly as John continued to work around his entrance, not quite giving him what he wanted…needed.
The news that Sherlock was turning heads had hardly come as a surprise, tall, dark and handsome, a terrible cliché, but in this case, annoyingly true.
Sherlock thrust his arse back as John finally pushed the first fingertip inside, totally past caring how slutty he looked, as John added a second and a third, probing and stretching him open as Sherlock pushed against him, fucking himself on John’s hand, reaching down to grip his neglected cock.
That just left the underwear, plain black wrapping concealing the best fucking Christmas present he had ever had in his life, even better than the Raleigh Chopper bike of 1983 or the second-hand ZX Spectrum of 1985, the last present he got from his dad before he died.
John stands there, shifting nervously from foot to foot, eyeing his phone and every car that slows at the intersection. He blinks in surprise when a sleek black car with tinted windows rolls up beside him and an attractive woman steps out of the driver seat. She moves around and opens the back door,  looking directly at him the entire time.
time together on the couch pulled him back from the edge. It was a haven. A harbor in the storm. He waited until they got home and then he surrendered to the need, pulling him down onto the couch.
“Alright, alright,” Billy says turning back to the camera. “We just want to say-” Billy looks at Gary and Gary, who had been shifting nervously, smiles back warmly. Something seems to pass between them and they both visibly relax .
John moves forward from crouching to kneeling with his knees bracketing Sherlock's hips. Then he rises up on his knees to sink his fingers into Sherlock's hair so that he can search for any unusual lumps or wounds on his scalp. Almost the instant John's fingers press against Sherlock's scalp, Sherlock lets out a loud, low, jagged sound. John jerks his hands back in surprise.
John reached out and pulled him close, branded Sherlock with those heated touches on bare skin, marked him with fingertips dug in hips and then emptied his essence deep within Sherlock’s body, leaving Sherlock’s entire chemistry altered, irreparably changed by absorbing that essentia of John. There is no going back... and it’s

So the dark truth remains, if he had slipped so low as to use drugs last night it must be the result of something particularly cataclysmic. Cold fingers of fear wrap around his insides as he considers what might be
Sherlock nods, stepping even closer. He can feel the heat radiating off of John, as it did last night. He watches John slowly rock forward in that unconscious way he often does, like a magnet on the edge of a strong field unable to resist being drawn in. It is one of those idiosyncrasies of John's behaviour that makes it easy for Sherlock to imagine more.
when it came to women. That was obviously not completely true as he’d looked hard enough to gather her measurements. There was Mycroft indicating the detective didn’t know anything to do with sex, which seemed to contradict his friend’s own drugged confession that sex was painful and violent. Yet Sherlock had seemed naive, somewhat disdainful… even oblivious towards all things sexual.
"No. He can't." John cuts in just as Sherlock opens his mouth to agree. He steps out from behind Sherlock to interject himself physically. Both men turn their eyes on him but John just straightens his posture and plants himself firmly with his expression unwavering.
Not removing his arm from Sherlock's waist to steady him, John turns back towards the bed and gently propels Sherlock into motion. It's more physical support than Sherlock needs, frankly, but Sherlock doesn't object. It's comforting.
I shake that thought out of my head and jog after him, catching up just as he steps onto the escalator. As I step on behind him and it carries us downward, I glance back to ensure the guards aren't pursuing us. They aren't, of course. I almost want to laugh at the irony that Sherlock (the man who
Dinner. Wherever you'd like." Sherlock nearly jogs the last few steps and has never been so relieved in his life to see Sargent Donovan turn her angry glare on him.
He wraps his fingers around that silky, hard length and thinks he might explode right then. His hands clamp around the base of both their cocks because he
Sherlock whimpers, words dying and anger instantly deflated as he is pulled under by that throb of need.
own suddenly dry lips at the sight of him. Sherlock watches him do it. Then he continues to watch John's lips long after his tongue is gone.
“An enemy?” Surprisingly, her smile grows and there’s a sparkle of amusement in her eyes. “Interesting. Which one?"
You were brilliant. I was stunned. Couldn’t believe my good fortune that I found you and that you invited me in, asked me to come along. Of course I’d be your assistant, the bloody skull, your audience - whatever you wanted. I knew I was saying it out loud. I couldn’t help it.
- and I didn’t want you to not want me as a flatmate. Who wants to live with the pining bloke that you’d had to reject right out of the gate? So I played it off as a misunderstanding. Didn’t risk it again. I was a coward, really. Couldn’t bear to lose you. I’m sorry.
My mind returns to that image burned in my brain of Sebastian disparaging him over his skill. Though all vulnerability had been immediately shielded by a familiar, cold mask of indifference, I can't deny that the flicker of pain in his eyes inspires a fierce, irrational protectiveness in me. I want to counteract the sting of Sebastian's insults and to take the potency out of whatever backhanded, degrading methods of seduction he is trying to use on Sherlock. I lean closer, my mouth just behind his ear and my voice pitched lower.
of all things. It's making it difficult to concentrate and he's fairly certain he needs to be concentrating right now.
"You've met your doctorly obligation to confirm I won't perish. I'm fine now." He draws his legs up and folds them crosswise, then looks down, picking at the cuff of his pajama pants. "Do not feel obligated to remain."
John squares his shoulders to Sherlock, unfazed. He is looking up from under his brow, eyes hard and attentive as they watch Sherlock. For all intents and purposes he looks like a soldier waiting for the right moment to strike.
Henry blinks for a few moments in disbelief. Then an enormous grin overtakes his features “Yes!” He exclaims, lifting higher. He claps his hands together, as he twirls in the air. “She loves me!”
“I have tried to find you earlier in your life. It seems our paths cannot cross before you are 26. I have tried to avoid you because…” Sherlock looks away, his insides rattling with the memories. His eyes are drawn back at John. “You always find me. It seems like a random happenstance to you but it is like magnetism, an invisible force acting in powerful ways that we only know exists by the inevitable results.”
creeps over Sherlock like cold fingers of doubt. He is, in fact, killing John by slow but persistent measures. Sherlock and his twisted life are a poison that gradually eats away at everything decent and human.
Hot liquid burns at the back of Sherlock's eyes and a tremor begins to shake him from the inside out. John, who had begun to move forward, stops and looks up at him with eyes wide and full of concern.
Sherlock steeples his fingers at his lips to hold the swell of emotion down; trying to think. He can see his hands trembling, but if he lowers them he isn’t sure what kind of humiliating grief mixed with gratitude sound will escape his lips. He turns away, closes his eyes and sucks in a deep breath. There is a weight lifting from his soul, leaving him feeling pleasantly emptier; a little more capable of breathing.
The image cuts again. John is standing outside a door to a hotel room; Room 207. He places his hand on the door and bows his head shaking it as he sings,
“Deceased. Hardly a threat to anyone anymore.” There is an eye roll in his words that reminds me that,
He sighs, flips the chart closed, props his elbow on the table and rests his chin on his fist, letting his eyes drift closed for a moment. By necessity he dips into unconsciousness easily, but sleeps lightly; listening for any signs of distress in the patients lining the room.
was dead. As a footnote in a broadcast later that day he learned that a low level government official named Mycroft Holmes died of
The wounded soldier glances back at the figure in the long coat who frowns then disappears. The soldier turns his wide, green eyes back to Captain Watson and nods weakly.
“Don't actually need CPR just now, Sherlock,” John coughs out, trying to laugh off the bizzare and awkward gesture. He keeps his hands firmly gripping Sherlock's thin shoulders so, if nothing else, he can prevent him from doing something else erratic.
“He was just a kid,” Captain Watson grits out and his eyes are bloodshot, glassy but burning fiercely. “A fucking kid that hadn't even had a chance to live.” He slams his bloody fist down on the table and the instruments clatter and clank to the floor.
Sherlock tunes him out again. It’s easy when he is so utterly depleted that everything begins to lose definition. The whole hall seems to throb and his vision blurs on the edges. He narrows his gaze on his dorm room door. It's straight ahead, at the end of the hall. That's all that matters. Just a bit further.
“This is my…” Sherlock hesitates for a half second, apparently considering what term to assign to me “
Once we pull out into traffic, I take a moment for the casual intimacy of sitting together in the back of the cab to settle around us before I broach what has really been chafing me since I first saw how Sebastian Wilkes treats Sherlock.
of things. He can deduce the miniate of intricate details that are solid and quantifiable, but when it gets down to the
Released from John's gaze, Sherlock sucks in a breath and forces his gaze to the window. He sits up straighter and relief washes over him to see police lights ahead. As the cab slows, he shoves too much money at the cabbie and nearly leaps out of the still moving car, fleeing before John pries more out of him. Unfortunately, within a few steps, John is right beside him again.
When he’d found himself with his lips over Sherlock's mouth, forcing air into his lungs, that had seemed natural too. This type of resuscitation was not completely foreign John as a doctor. Though using it on someone having a panic attack was hardly conventional practice, John had done it on instinct. Soldier and doctor calm, he'd given his frantic friend the only thing that he possessed to convince him that he could breathe; air from his own lungs. There wasn’t any question about it; Sherlock was falling off a cliff and John intended to do everything in his power to pull him back. He would keep Sherlock alive, even if he had to breathe for both of them.
worked it out,” Sherlock retorts, and I realise he is holding open the taxi door for me. I huff and slide in, then scoot over for him. As he gives the address to the cabbie, I scowl out the window. I could say that it’s not fair to compare Dimmock to himself since Sherlock is obviously
It was three months after the incident when John mustered the courage to return to Baker Street late one evening. It was with the certainty that he was ready for the next step. He had spent long hours contemplating everything that had been and was at last ready to see the true extent of that look in Sherlock's eyes and to reveal the feelings he had never been sure were welcome since that rejection at Angelo’s that first night.
Sherlock’s mind is spinning as his fingers instinctively tighten around that length and begin tracing it.
“I’m sure he’ll take a look at it once he’s solved the case he's working on now.” I shift forward signaling my readiness to exit the car
"Yeah. Yeah, of course they do." John practically beams at Sherlock as if pleased that a little explanation is all that is required. "I'd say mine is blue." He pinches his dark blue shirt between thumb and forefinger, holding it out as if it's evidence. "Mike's is orange. A lot of girls like pink." He tilts his head to the side and studies Sherlock for a moment. "Purple, isn't it?" A huge triumphant smile brakes out on John's face as he nods to himself. He leans a little closer as he gestures at Sherlock. "Yeah, purple has got to be it. Your shirt, your sheets - all that same color."
“She cared about them so much. So tender and reverent with them, I couldn’t help but admire her.” He bows his head a moment and Sherlock opens his mouth to speak but Andy cuts in again, looking directly at Sherlock through the glass.
“No." His tone has a sharp edge of irritation over the air of flat disinterest. "Molly is a mutually beneficial acquaintance. We barter; exchange favours for goods and services." His tone goes flatter. "Most of my associations fall within this realm."
“I am well aware of their idiocracies and behavioural tendencies.” Sherlock’ snaps defensively, a hand slipping in the coat pocket and closing around that little book of notes.
“Meant to be viewed up close.” He turns and jogs away, his words trailing after him, “A commentary on shifting perspective and reality’s subjective nature.”
are you apologising?" Sherlock hides the shiver caused by John's hands sliding over his body by impatiently wrestling out of the robe as it pools behind him on the bed.
"Oh - oh, no. Yeah. Sorry, sir." John clears his throat. "Sherlock is just -" John steps back, opening the door to reveal the room and Sherlock standing by the bed hurriedly trying to maneuver his way into his dressing gown. With his usual swift gracefulness, he likely would have managed to get it on before now but with his bruised ribs he is caught still mostly naked and scrambling.
As the anesthesiologist injects some more sedative, Watson leans over and sets to work again. He picks the little pieces of metal peppering the wound.
John’s personality did not alter, but there were small shifts in his behaviour. He began working more than usual at the clinic; frequently picking up extra shifts. He seemed determined to date any female he could lay hands upon, though he rarely made it beyond two dates with any of them (even with Sherlock’s non-interference), and he never sat on the couch with Sherlock anymore. In fact, he seemed to avoid the couch altogether.
“Sherlock, just-” But before he has a chance to force his eyes open and finish his sentence, Sherlock is upon him with such speed and momentum that John's head snaps back the little distance he’d managed to lift it off the ground with a blunt thud against the hard cement. He is forced to swallow his own muffled cry of alarm as Sherlock’s plush lips seal over his thinner ones. There is a few seconds where John is frozen in confusion and then Sherlock is pushing air into his
At least he has the medical training to make a go at reviving him and patching him up before he gets thrown out on his arse for good.
is all John can think. He stays there patiently waiting for this all to be explained. It is the only strategy that has kept him sane existing in proximity to the world's only consulting detective.
I decide that interacting with a normal human being is necessary for my sanity and so I slide into the que of a young woman with long, straight, strawberry hair and an attractive smattering of freckles over her cheeks and nose. She seems sweet and kind and nothing like a certain brooding, silver-eyed, dark-haired flatmate.
The room is spinning. His head sags forward and he feels himself sway from side to side and suddenly John is beside him, guiding him back to lay down on the couch. He is staring up as the doctor  hovers over him, filling all his vision. There is alarm in that expression. His lips are moving but Sherlock can't hear him over the thunder of his own heart. He can't move. His body is not his own.
The shift in Sherlock is so minute, you wouldn't see it unless you were watching closely and knew him well. Something goes dead in his eyes and his face goes so neutral it is hauntingly empty.
Adrenaline swells and thrums through my veins as I consider each man, estimating their skills as a fighter. Two are likely ex-military by the way they hold themselves. The taller of the army blokes has dark hair, broad shoulders, callused knuckles and a steely gaze. The more I size him up, the more that that familiar, primal bloodthirst sings through my veins at the idea of tangling with him.
John moved to cover his friend in their now familiar arragement, but Sherlock threw up a hand and said John couldn't lay on him because the younger man would not be able to curb his arousal. John was set spinning again and found himself having a serious mental break trying to figure out what was going on.
“Mornin’” John proclaims amiably. He briefly lifts his eyes to Sherlock and flashes a genuine smile. As his eyes slide back to the pan before him and the smile fades on his lips, Sherlock perceives the weariness just beneath the surface. He watches John as he stretches to crack an egg into a second pan and his face contorts in pain. He pulls his arm back with a hitch and rolls his shoulder with a faint groan.
Sherlock loves it when John shows his more assertive side, though it has never come to that on their ‘first time.’ He always starts out so careful and tender as if Sherlock is a virgin - as if their bodies weren’t cosmicly designed to fit together.
Sherlock closes his eyes against the feeling of lightheadedness. That smile, so genuinely fond and devoted, along with that spark of joy in his dark blue eyes, ignites an ember in his stomach. Sherlock digs his fingers into the tops of his thighs to resist reaching out to touch him.
“Stupid thing was, I was trying to protect him and instead... Well, he was bloody near devastated when we all thought you jumped. Two years Boss rarely went home; nearly slept in his office. If he wasn't there he was drinking, alone, at some bar. Not a wonder his wife got lonely. It was like he thought he had to punish himself, make himself miserable, 'cause he'd somehow failed you.”
“There’s work to be done,” he calls over his shoulder, clearly trusting that I will follow after him.
What I am. I just…” Sherlock stops and hangs his head. He takes a deep breath and everything about him sags.
It throws me off balance, making an odd, achy sensation expand in my chest as I meet his gaze. It's like something is missing that was there before and I'm not sure how to recover it because I'm not even sure what
“Right, then.” Captain Watson rises to his feet. “Into battle.” He gives a nod, that the entity can't help but think is directed at it, then he pivots and marches back towards the operating theatre.
"There’s little use in pretending, I know who you’ve been with and it's not difficult to deduce what you’ve been up to." He pops the last two words like small explosives. He's shockingly angry; eyes cold and lips curled up around his teeth like he's ready to bite.
Sherlock looks around the room with eyes narrowed in suspicion, thinking surely this must be a cruel prank. He's not
Sherlock knows that the answer should come easily. Obviously John has permission to touch every part of him - he needn't ask. But the fact that John
Less than. I seen what lookin’ out for you was doin’ to 'im... Was gonna lose his job over you one day.” Donovon tilts her chin up as if challenging Sherlock to disagree. Sherlock looks down, his mouth tightening.
“She’s a good one to have,” Lestrade affirms. “Imagine we’ll be keeping you right busy once we’re both at it. You’ll be needing that
Billy looks down at the body splayed open on the table. Men and women rush in frantic motion all around him and yet they are already starting to fade, to slip into smoke, like something from a dream. The only one pulsing in and out of vibrancy is Captain Watson. Billy's eyes are drawn to him, watching the strange play of light each time the Captain touches the body on the table.The figure watches him too with a slight edge of caution and irritation as it regards him.
"Indeed," his smile is wintery and the way his eyes remain cold and sharp is disturbing. The silence holds a beat too long in which time my brain races off in several directions trying to calculate the threat here. His video surveillance of our sitting room means he will have seen me read the file. A bit not good - prying into government secrets like that. But the bigger threat is that he realises I've solved it and wants me to reveal the culprit (defeating Sherlock's efforts to protect the girl and her bodyguard).
“Nine. Trapped alone on a deserted island, what three things would you take?” Sherlock balances his glass of sctoch aloft as he curls himself snuggly into his sitting chair across from John.
Most of the wounded ex-soldier’s efforts at restarting his love life had been met with as soul-crushingly dismissive and slightly disgusted rejection as Anthea had recently dealt him. He’d found himself having to be considerably more blunt because somehow the idea of a “cripple” being interested in getting a leg up seemed completely bizarre to everyone, as if his manhood had naturally shriveled up and fell off as well. He had concluded that in his current state it was hard to imagine anyone looking at his gnarled and lame body and even considering being with him sexually.
"No. No, I’m not, Sherlock," John says with a bemused smile. "That not what I was asking. Do you know what's happened
He focuses his silvery eyes on those of his reflection. The pupils are blown wide and he looks, for all intents and purposes, as if he is
“Trained monkeys could do better, John. I said as much.” His voice is gravely and John wonders if it's not from screaming at nurses and doctors. He paces swiftly to the window and brushes aside the curtain with the back of two fingers so a small sliver of muted light creeps in. He gazes out a moment.
Sherlock flourishes a hand, then steeples his fingers together over his lap. He scans John's relaxed demeanor, trying to measure his openness and adjust his approach accordingly. “In place of some appalling or imbecilic gift inflicted upon me in the name of
“The point is, we forgive and we stick together,” Billy gives Gary’s arm a little squeeze and interlaces their fingers.
Sherlock bites back the urge to smile and directs his eyes to his phone so if his sudden rush of joy seeps through it can be interpreted as directed at Irene's messages instead of revealing his ruse. He waves a hand dismissively in John's direction.
He still had the key and since he wasn’t keen on talking to Mrs. Hudson before he knew where he and Sherlock stood, he let himself in quietly. He took a deep breath, threw back his shoulders and pushed open the door to the sitting room. For a moment his muscles immediately tensed in preparation for a fight as he took in the sight of Sherlock, apparently under attack.
“Have you got cash?” Old habits die hard and if he is going to sit there and pretend he hasn't been pummeling someone just moments before I walked in I'm hardly going to be the first to tip my hand by sharing the details of how they've decided to come after me.
Watson tries to see that being's brilliant essence within the swirl of light and it stings; burning through him as if every synapse in his head is trying to fire at the same time; sensation and memory and thought all emploding. Everything he is, was and can be seems to be happening all at once.
He is smiling, large and warm. Yet, there's something unpleasant I can't put my finger on within his bright expression.
He might as well have scratched it into the floor with his dying breath. It spoke volumes, while saying
John was his conductor of light in more ways than one. John steadied Sherlock; made him... respectable. Likable. Better. He not only cast a light into the dark corners to allow Sherlock to see things he could not see alone, he also amplified Sherlock’s light so that the people around them could at last see all of Sherlock. Because when John saw beautiful, wonderful, brilliant things in Sherlock, the rest of the world learned to see it too.
"Mmm." It may be a sound of acknowledgement but Sherlock lifts his eyes again and they are dark and expectant as they search John's face. It's as if he's waiting for John to do something.
but he's starting to question if even that was real or if he'd deluded himself. He hardens. A smile that's really a suppressed snarl takes over his features. It's rare that he gets this furious but she'd gone for the jugular with that deeply personal attack and he's done being polite.
He is sitting on a stool in a small room, mostly cast in shadows. He looks down and strums his bandaged fingers over the guitar in his lap. He chuckles to himself, readjusting his fingers. “I'm a bit rusty... Nothing like what
. He feels the coldness of John, like ice pulsing in his own veins, and the horror of it makes Sherlock gag.
“Sherlock.” John’s right hand pushes firmly down at the base of Sherlock’s spine as both a clear directive, reasserting that Sherlock should stay still, and a reassurance that John knows what he is doing. John's left thumb is stroking back and forth along the inner seam of his leg and arse and Sherlock can feel everything inside winding tighter at that gentle caress. Sherlock loses the ability to breathe.
Sherlock’s eyes brighten slightly. And the finger returns to tentatively curl through the fine brown hairs clustered over John’s sternum, exploring their coarse texture and twisting then unwinding them individually around a long, elegant finger.
"I suppose I deserve that," John grumbles from the other side of the door. Sherlock spares a moment to glare at the door again. Then he flits and flutters around the room, shoving at piles and reassessing everything about the space with growing agitation. At last, he stops and spins a circle while sinking his hands in his hair. It's then that he realises that his hair must be a wild, unkempt mess from his night of studying. He ruffles it gently in the way that usually tames it a bit. He smooths his dressing gown one last time, telling himself that these efforts are
The car pulls up outside 221B and John commences hauling his drugged friend out of the car while Anthea does her best to ignore their existence. He mutters goodbye, though he knows she will neither hear nor respond, then he props Sherlock against himself and guides him inside.
Here John is, like a criminal, compelled to return to the scene of the crime. No doubt all this charm and kindness has been a ploy to smooth things over so that he can ensure that his shameful secret will remain buried. John has a reputation to maintain, after all, and Sherlock’s awareness of his
Bloody well deserving of a gold star or a sobriety chip or something for how well he was doing quelling any suggestion of wanting more. He was doing a spectacular job of it…. Right up to the moment he
John's fingers bump lightly over the row of buttons down the center of his shirt, tracing the line of them over the fabric from sternum to navel then back up again. His eyelids are heavy and drifting closed.
“Needs must”, I answered coolly, “I understand you worked the ports in the North for a time six years ago?” “That I did lad, twenty years served, keeping records at the Liverpool docks, trading, cargoes, immigrants….”
The ‘him’ in question was currently standing by Lestrade looking innocently amused by the entire embarrassing show. He made his way swiftly back across the room, keen to be anywhere else than here right now, Mycroft’s club or even Serbia had a certain appeal compared to this…
I think then, that you understand our position. We had a secret and one that we wished to remain so for now, but above that, she knew me for a whore from the minute I stepped through the door. So, it would seem did another of her lodgers who on seeing me had proposed to have me at any price if she could part me from my protector.
I turned to stare at him in confusion until struck with the most startling moment of clarity and relief. It pierced through the rising tide of blind panic in my mind that somehow there could have been a mistake in our coming here. But no; I nodded in recognition and stepped forward with a purpose renewed, ignoring any curious glances thrown our way for the richness of our attire for this place, silk cravats and finely tailored waistcoats at odds with the simple working men’s garb. For once I thanked providence for my slender form and quick, light feet as I bravely used elbows and shoulders to move easily through the press of bodies, carving a path for Tom behind me without an eyebrow or a fist for that matter raised against us. True, there were a few slopped beers and stubbed toes and a generous lungful of smoke for our troubles, but we made it through to the back of the room to a small oak door to the left of the bar. It sat incongruous, the space before it kept free of tables or stools. Nothing to show it as anything remarkable, but beyond the point the rest of the building was private, admittance at the sole invitation of the landlord himself, and so it remained habitually closed. It led, I knew, to the aforementioned dining room and from thence to another door to the stairwell with access to the all the upper floors and private guest rooms. A corridor veered off to the right of the stairs towards a narrow galley kitchen at the back of the building. This I knew from memory, as for the moment I stared perplexed as the way through remained resolutely, frustratingly barred.
He sank into a seat near the back and prepared himself for two hours of mind-numbing boredom, spread his jumper across the pitted wooden desk, laid his head down and closed his eyes. He drifted away almost instantly, as the sounds of chatter and movement from the rest of the class grew muffled and indistinct. He was back bed, John’s bed, his warm breath on the back of Sherlock’s neck as they slept. He could fell his heart beating the pulse in his neck, the blood pumping round his body, the smell of sex and sweat, the remnants of aftershave and deodorant, cardboard from the unpacked boxes by the window and the scent of stale beer on denim jeans. And his voice telling Sherlock how beautiful he was.
“Ha…yes…yes he was” he felt his cheeks go crimson with embarrassment. Mrs Hudson was just like someone’s Nan to an onlooker, but John felt sure she had lived the sort of life where absolutely nothing shocked her, so two teenage boys having sex wouldn’t even have raised an eyebrow. He felt a swell of fondness – they should go back and see her at Baker Street, him and Sherlock.
I ripped off my shirt with scorn, setting my curls askew, the colour raised and blazing with anger across my chest. Anger at myself, anger at Charles and anger at the injustice of a world that would deny me my lover in plain sight, condemned as something to be hid and scorned.
“Don’t be thick…the impending risk of hypothermia gives me the perfect excuse to take all your fucking clothes off”
Sherlock still though it one of the best decisions he’d ever made, unorthodox but cathartic, for both of them.
They parried back and forth, both steadfast and determined to press his point. This was not John’s fight though, it was mine and mine alone. I forced my unwilling limbs to motion and faced my accuser, the destroyer of my happiness, and if I was to fall it was also in my power to bring him down too. I had no reason to feel shame and held my head aloft, no more the cowering boy he had forced himself upon.
John gasped and reached out a trembling hand, running it gently over the dip of his waist and pelvic bone, drawing circles around his hip.
“It isn’t on your phone Elsa, I’ve just checked” Kate appeared in the background, long red hair tied back in a ponytail, a simple jeans and t-shirt, she looked like a student not a stripper, John thought, although what the hell did he know?
