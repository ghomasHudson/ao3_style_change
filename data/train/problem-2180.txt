Sherlock gave a small derisive snort. “Yes, a wedding, John. That’s what people do when they want the world to know they belong to one another. Now, if you’ll excuse me” he said, and he got up and walked towards where Rosie was.
also a talented author,  and the best friends fandom can offer! As always, these two talents are not responsible for the errors I incur in after they have given their seal of approval, and I decide to make last minute changes! This is the next to last chapter! I rearranged things so they would not be too long. Hope you enjoy!
“I guess so. I came to London to live with her. This life, without her, in London, isn’t for me. Once I get divorced, I want to go home. I want to take Nyla. I guess I will have to conform to have her half a year. Ahhh… what a mess Sherlock. If I had known she was going to turn herself over to her family this completely, I wouldn’t have happily agreed to move.”
John, who not so long ago would have turned around and walked away, now quietly followed Sherlock for a bit. Once they went inside, he stayed in the sitting room, looking at his phone. He got up to show Sherlock a picture. It was the day of Jackson’s birthday. Luther and Sherlock, walking away, hand in hand. Sherlock was closer to the camera, and his smile was beautifully captured. “I would never ask you to regret someone who made you feel like this. Honestly, it’s what I strive to do now. Make sure I show you how much I care in public, as much as in private.”
“John to the left, and Sherlock to the right. You guys are both ‘Father’.” She said, her eyes daring them to disagree. They both appeared to know better. Rosie wrote down “Nana Hudson- Grandmother”. The men proceeded to battle for Mrs. Hudson.
Sherlock took them both in his hand and worked in a tight fast motion that finished John off. He let John go before he over sensitized, but stayed where he was for a while, until John caught his breath. Then he lay on his side, next to him, bundled in the sheet.
Sherlock now turned his attention to the card. Which really wasn’t a card at all, but a letter. After opening it carefully, using gloves and a letter opener, he was relieved to find only a piece of paper. It read;
Had he? Had he already? If he did, it had been the worst. No. He was still walking. So confused. Lost? In London? The lights looked too bright. Since when were these streets so noisy? Where to find Wiggins? Funny that! Wiggins now worked for Sanof, didn’t he. This wasn’t the right neighborhood. Nothing looked familiar. He was out of practice. His Belstaff looked out of place. He walked. His legs were made of lead. He saw her text in his mind; “...don’t do something stupid Bumble.” Walk, Holmes, walk.
Sherlock sat down once again in front of Dr.Q. ”I rather think we tore down our old relationship and are building a new one. In this one, I try my best to communicate. It's still a challenge for us. I was honest with John about the extent of my health issues resulting from the gunshot and the drug use. I hadn’t told him about the recent cardiologist visits. I lay out that it was the one of the reasons why I haven’t dealt with cases over a 6, other than a couple of exceptions. The most important reason is Rosie of course.”
“Feel free to take your time browsing about. All of those are things that interest me personally. The insects were a gift from a patient turned friend.  Coffee, or tea?”
“You got all of it Sherlock!” Said Dylan, bumping his fist to Sherlock, who just looked at the hand, nose wrinkled.
So Sherlock nodded, and they went. Some of the locals said hello to John, but didn’t stay to talk. They talked the case over, happy to have finally solved it. Sherlock predicting how Stewart would proceed to arrest the suspects. John talked about the veteran they had helped, how he was doing better, and had accepted to go into rehab. They continued talking once they left the pub, walking close together.
“You know what?  I can’t take it anymore!! Another room isn’t far enough. You think my life is boring, I say it’s purposeful. I have a daughter to be there for, to be present for. And yeah, there has been no partnership lately, and certainly no affection coming from you. So, maybe I will relish time without you. Maybe I will take my daughter and let you be! No more little girl depending on you, no more partner to point out your errors and hurt your tender sensitivities.” John wanted to poke Sherlock out of his mask, wake him up...
Charlie and Nyla had spent three weeks of her school holidays in the States with Charlie’s family. They had just come back, so Lizbeth, together with Linda Stamford, were taking the girls to the Apollo Victoria to see “Wicked”. John was catching up on work, while Charlie was catching up on chores, such as shopping for food, arranging for laundry service and registering Nyla for daycare, from the comfort of Sherlock’s library computer, where they were talking over the state of their families. While Sherlock told her of his on again status with John and his summer with Rosie, Charlie told him about her visit with her family. They wanted her back. Her old job wanted her back. Her best friend wanted to set her up with an old crush of hers. The only problem was custody with Nyla. Charlie was not about to let her daughter go. Neither was Lizbeth.
Molly came to the bar after “Bang Bang Bang” looking all flushed and happy. “Oh, he’s in a good mood! All happy and quite tipsy. You know they paid for this.”
“Well, that my body did need to recuperate from it. I didn’t go to the club and when Luther texted I told him I was on a case, which is true. I also continue to feel mortified about calling out someone else’s name.”
“Of course I will sweetheart! I wouldn’t miss it for the world!” and when he looked up and saw his family smiling, John knew that was well worth sacrificing the conference for being with them
by the amazing Chryse, Sherlock loves John from the day he meets him. This is the most beautiful love story!
It was a good thing John had asked Greg to record her, because he was absorbed in looking at Sherlock, who was immobile, cheeks flushed, eyes moist, mouth slightly opened.
“Green shirt. The night I first went with Luther. Why didn’t you come to me, then? Oh. You were with someone else.” Sherlock looked away. “Gianna, still?”
John came over and looked. “Shoes? Those look like Adidas tennis shoes. Weren’t they popular a while back?” he asked.
At this John stepped towards them. “Mr Reids, I strongly suggest you go back to your gym. Sherlock is here on police business.”
“He informed me that everytime I had been with him, I called out your name. Always. From the beginning. It was never he that mattered John. He was just- company. Someone I could be with when I thought you didn’t want me anymore.”
John kissed Sherlock and made sure he was comfortable. Sherlock was very sensitive, it had taken some practice for them to get things just right. He needed a firm touch, and little foreplay, since that tended to over sensitize him. There had been no more penetration after that first time, Sherlock never mentioning it or requesting it, so they had used hands, and mouths, and different locations.
The bar pushed the show for rather early in the evening, but it was fine nonetheless. Mycroft’s face, when he saw the young redhead, was simply priceless. The young man had no doubt perfected his act. His tease dance to a remix of “Crazy in Love” was admirable and managed to lift even Sherlock’s spirits. His main act, of course, was the sketch with the umbrella to Rihanna’s “Umbrella”. Greg was thoroughly enjoying Mycroft’s open mouthed astonishment when he saw the auburn haired dancer in the black corset and high heels. Sherlock was happy seeing Mycroft laugh and applaud, just let go and enjoy himself. After it was done, the floor opened for dancing, starting with the grooms, who danced well together.
I will be adding songs linked here and maybe some others that I listened to on repeat while writing this; Will You Take Me Home
John had put this off long enough. It was past time. Still he felt his presence. Still he felt the nerves. But this was the final ritual. John walked towards the grave stone, overrun with weeds he did not touch, next to his mother’s. “Jonathan Hamish Watson”. John walked around a bit, and took a deep breath.
Rosie went through the whole process again. “John just helped me open the honey jar. He insisted on supervising the whole experiment, even though it was just a tiny one. He took pictures though. If you want I’ll have him send them to you.”
When he came back, she hugged him. “Child you have such talent!! Why have you been hiding this?” He had added little sketches of Sherlock on the bicycle, Molly, Billy, and them at the sushi restaurant, Rosie, handing a bowl of strawberries to Sherlock, she with a knowing look, he with a guilty one; the wording to that one said “When was the last time you ate, Sherlock?” There was a full page colored sketch of Sherlock and Charlie, dancing, Sherlock looking stunning, Charlie beautiful with a happy smile. One of Rosie and Pepsi, arms around each other and covered in mud, laughing after losing a race during the picnic. The last one was of Sherlock, during the picnic, sitting on the blanket, against a tree, with his arms around his legs, looking up at some bees with a dreamy expression and a small smile.
Sherlock, John and Stewart joined Nelson in a car to first follow the route and familiarize himself with it a bit. Sherlock took the opportunity to look around various bus stops paying attention to the schedules and maps available. Nelson was a patient and friendly man, who knew about Sherlock and was happy to talk with John as the detective “did his thing”.
“Señor del Cielo, que paso aqui?” She asked, looking at all the scattered materials. “Rosie, are you alright? Mr. Holmes, what happened here?”
John had been looking at him in concern. His eyes had been soft, caring? He had felt his torso with a doctor’s detachment, but his voice had been shaky. He was concerned for his ex-partner. Sherlock had been alarmed to see John’s eyes were moist and scared. Associations with the fall? After all this time? Even after he explained, John was still upset. Then, unexpectedly, he had pulled him down and kissed him. Sherlock’s heart had already been racing with the adrenaline of the chase and the capture. The kiss stopped any foreign thought processes. He stepped back, trying to breathe, to make some sense of this unprecedented behavior. John had never kissed him in public. Not even when they had been in the hot, early days of their relationship. Just as he took in a much needed gulp of air, John did it again, holding on tight to him, pushing his body against the detective’s.
Mrs H knew what John was feeling. She had seen it in Sherlock many times since their break-up. John was jealous. Though personally, Mrs Hudson didn’t think Sherlock’s relationship had any real future. Sherlock was adamant that they were not romantic and that Luther had a family to go back to, she didn’t tell John that. Let him. Let him feel what Sherlock had more than once. It might just rightly wake the daft man up.
“None of that. I just thought you wanted to pace and fret and would not like me in your room if you were not in it.”
He kissed Sherlock’s cheek, “This is for when I was flirting with you at Angelo’s that first night.”
“Partner? What kind of partner have you been to me the last six months, John? You don’t even talk to me if it’s not about Watson!  Unless it’s to chastise me about my behaviours in front of people who are not important. When we are out in public the only sign you give of knowing me is the way you point out my errors. You can’t even look at me, much less touch me! We haven’t slept in the same room for months! That is what you call a partner? I thought you would have
His dates were set up online, there had been two women, ready to have a good time in bed. John wasn’t looking at dating as a way to find that special someone that could be an ideal mom for Rosie.
Sherlock paced the living room floor, his hand shaking against his thigh (‘playing an invisible tambourine’, was how Greg thought of it.) “It’s a question. Say someone was bi and had lots of relationships and sex with women. Then he had a long term relationship with a man. Not quite two months after they are broken up, the man starts dating women. Did he ever really like sex with his ex-lover? Or was he just ‘making do'?”
They addressed communication skills, how Sherlock used vocabulary and grammar as armours, and could be very precise and hurtful when he had time to prepare what to say. However, he could experience verbal shutdowns when confronted with unexpected emotions or arguments. Doctor Quentin recommended that Sherlock be more open with the people in his life and let them know this happened to him, so when they experienced it, they did not think of his silence as Sherlock being dismissive, but of needing some time to regain his words.
The girls worked on their project, washing the dolls’ hair and writing notes about the results. Then they tried different methods to curl the remaining dolls’ hair, again leaving their hair to dry. After a lunch of pasta, the girls and Charlie played karaoke, with Rosie being the best voice. The dolls’ hair resulted in various different degrees of curls, each technique and doll properly documented, the process filmed and the mess picked up.
Luther had smiled, but thought it might be better to delete it from his phone, Iyanna would not like it. Before he did though, he added it to a small file he kept on a memory stick at work. Both men were nicely dressed, out in public. Sherlock’s curls flying in the wind. His face, smiling wide, looking forwards. Luther, three steps ahead, looking back at his face, smiling too. Some kind of sentiment in his eyes. They were holding hands. There in his office, Luther printed the photograph, a small size, just enough to keep in his work journal. Iyanna rarely came to his office. He wouldn’t hide it, if she did.
Luther couldn’t keep his eyes off Sherlock for long. The music was beautiful, Sherlock was mesmerized. Sitting in the balcony seat with him, a small smile, his hands together as if in prayer, the Detective moved his head softly to the gentler pieces.
Molly looked at him, with a little grin on her face  “... not be available to his ex all the time? John, what do you expect from Sherlock? Have you thought about it? Because I do get the feeling he is quite determined to show himself he can be independent. After all, he is single now. You’ve dated, it would be alright for him to find someone.”
“Yesterday, when Charlie was over, she talked about Lizbeth’s behavior. It seemed odd to me. Figured there was something I could find out. They should talk. Charlie should know.”
“Ah! There’s always something! It’s Molly who is from Edinburgh! Must have been the punches. Well, come on. Time to eat.”
“John... Yes! yes, husbands!” He lowered himself to the floor, next to John and held on to him for a long while, enough for John to move and sit against the chair, bringing Sherlock into his arms properly.
He decided to leave Bart, even though he hadn’t finished his experiment. As he started to go home, he had an idea. He decided to check something first;
After their climb, they left Luther and Jackson in favor of searching for ice cream.  They each got a cone, and Rosie took hers and went to join Pepsi on a queue for face painting. Sherlock realised John had not known about his meltdown and the real reasons for his stay at Mycroft’s. He had thought either Mike or Lestrade would have told John. He was grateful neither had. He did not want his ex partner to pity him. Left by themselves, John quickly brought up the Yard and DI Donovan. Sherlock told him some stories about Hoyt, the newest Anderson. The two ended up laughing at the unbelievable antics Donovan had to put up with. It was almost like old times.
When the girls were each in front of their respective groom, Mike said, “Now, as a symbol of the commitment you have promised one another in front of everyone you hold dear, each take a ring, and say the line John, then Sherlock can repeat it.
The first thing John noticed was that the 17th step did not creek anymore. Sherlock opened the door and stepped back again, his body slightly swaying, his fingers playing the tambourine on his leg.
Sherlock turned his face to John’s and looked at him with his familiar intensity, “Luther and I are still friends, no break up. I do not need any more of those.”
Sherlock talked with two of his underground girls, Claire and Kaia, who had been showing the desire to get off the streets and pursue an education. They were to board in the basement flat, which had also undergone a transformation, and discreetly help Mrs Hudson with things such as shopping, dropping off dry cleaning, being undercover companions and housekeepers for her as needs arose. This way, there would always be two people at 221B to keep an eye on her, if Sherlock and John were away on a case, or on a holiday.
“Don’t get too used to it. Most likely wedding jitters.” Mycroft said, but he had the faintest smile.
“We did. But I knew he would go back to the States and he knew I have my family here.” Sherlock said, wanting the Earth to open and swallow him whole.
“Oh, no danger of that this time around. And I have some suggestions about what you should wear. It has to be something memorable.” And so the two friends bickered and laughed and by the end of the afternoon, Sherlock had something to show his anxious tailor.
“John, are you sure these are Sherlock’s issues? You told me he had changed when he came ‘back from the dead’. Could you be projecting Mary’s behavior on him?”
“Extraordinary! Simply extraordinary!” John piped up; he had been thinking it quietly ever since he had been able to make sense of Sherlock’s words.
Sherlock found a lady friend of Michael Garland, one of the researchers. He went to her job, and on her break, treated her to lunch, telling her that there was probably someone from the group involved in criminal activity. The girl, Nancy, opened up to Sherlock, about a fellow researcher of Michael’s, a talented young woman named Lauren Farris,  who had actively flirted with him, to get his notes on the tests, copying them to add to her own. The woman had a side experiment, she believed the medicines in the trials could be used for many diseases more than the two that were being tried. She had been pushing the idea of manipulating the subjects’ immune system as necessary, working at a molecular level to eliminate proteins that caused healthy cell death.
“I wouldn’t have accepted that from Meghan. Hidden relationships are so not on. Didn’t it bother you? Why didn’t you snap him out of that?”
John was working at Barts as the Veteran’s Program site director. He was enjoying the setting up of the program and the assembling of the teams and locations needed to keep the program growing. He was already thinking though, that once the program was running and functional, he could cut back his hours to participating doctor, or make up his own position as consulting administrator, so he could have more family hours. The lessons learned were clearly present in his brain. More communication, more attention and more affection. That both he and Sherlock were determined that this new relationship would work made all the difference in the world.
They heard Ms. Lane’s announcement: “Every year a child is picked to sing a solo for their own cause. This year, the chosen singer asked to sing to a very dear family member, a song chosen by herself…” This was Rosie’s cue to go to the stage. “Ladies and gentlemen, families and friends, our soloist for the night, Ms. Rosie Watson!"
Sherlock rubbed John’s ring. “I have married an Army Captain. My dream has come true, Dearest. I’m so full, I can’t breathe properly. John, we are together. Our rings match. We belong together.” If there was moisture in their eyes, or some wetness on their cheeks, neither of them commented.
They got to the bedroom and naked in record time. Luther pulled the covers off the bed and got the lube.
At that, John’s chest felt a pull. Having Sherlock here would have made the experience so many times better. John took a deep breath. Tried to think about the set up for tomorrow.
Sherlock took her hands away from her face, “I believe these people, very unlike you, did not have enough intelligence to carry out their plans. You, on the other hand love, were just brilliant!”
John looked alarmed for a moment, then took in what this looked like. He laughed, pulled a chair next to Sherlock, and put a hand on his back. “This is Rosie’s night. This has to do strictly with her. She doesn’t know about this bit yet. Please, look at this. I would like you to fill this out. If you want to. If you don't, nothing will change. Just…” John took the papers out of the envelope and presented them to Sherlock.
“I never thought of giving this to anyone other than you. Even when we were new flatmates, I wanted you to have it, you liked my army stuff so much, but there was no ‘normal’ way to go about giving it to you. Then I just, kind of made myself forget about it.” He took Sherlock’s hand and made sure the lion was on the top. “This is how it’s supposed to go.” Sherlock put his hands on either side of John’s face and kissed him. He took his sweet time. When they took a break to breathe, Sherlock turned the ring around again so Watson was seen on top. “So, we have gone from friends who co-parent, to boyfriends who live apart, to- what are we now?” he asked.
“I’m high-functioning sociopath, addicted to drugs, and done. How will talking with you help? I refuse any type of medication, or trips to hospital. I will go ahead with the overdose in its stead.”
“How about the night after the show we bring you to the hotel? Would you be alright with that, John?"
“Well done, Watson. That was truly brilliant, how you hid in a safe place and managed to call me! You are so brave, little bee.” Rosie took a watery breath and hid her face in his neck. When she had calmed down some, Sherlock talked to her in a gentle voice, “Little Bee, could you please show me the notes you have received? They must be in your school bag.”
“Shut up!...” He said, flustered nonetheless. “It's just good to see you… I don’t know?...happy? Finally over the breakup?”
If there had ever been a moment for crawling under a rock and dying, this was it for John. But then he looked up he saw Sherlock, who looked as if he were about to pass out and/or cry himself. So he took a deep breath, smiled and said,. “So you are going to make sure these two don’t crash on the floor?”
“Sod it John! Piss off! Serious parenting? What about when she was a newborn and her mother ran away to Asia, while you were dedicated to drinking yourself stupid? Who did all the fucking serious parenting shite? Who walked her all bloody night when she was desperately missing her mother and retched non-stop  because of the formula? What about when you were drunk and irrational? Depressed and missing your murderous wife? Or later, so tired from work you couldn’t even think?
It had been hard enough for him to cover how affected he was by seeing John again: he had to remind himself John wasn’t here because of him. He had to bring forth everything he and Dr.Quentin had talked about, that John had been responsible for the breakup also. He had to try to stop himself from staring, or from having physical proximity or contact with the ex-blogger, since that would only encourage him to remember the last time they had... The addition of Luther’s presence, the Birthday boy’s Grandfather!, was just unfair. Sherlock’s brain was reeling, as if stuck on buffering mode.
“John? Are you coming back, or did Lestrade scare you away with his boring conversation?” Sherlock, his curls like an almighty halo, John’s t-shirt on him, slim fit.
“Lizbeth, what Sherlock is, with such bad taste, trying to convey is how miserable you will be when she actually moves back, close to her family and her old friends, and starts moving on.”
“Hi sweetheart! Sorry I’m late! I came as soon as I could! Too bad some people do not have the courtesy to answer my texts.” Said John, not acknowledging Sherlock.
“Oh loads. The man was not alcoholic. He was taking his meds and one of the numbers I found was from his social worker. He was about to get a placement in a housing building. He wouldn’t have just disappeared, John. Unfortunately, the other number was not answered, but I’ll try again, I also found a scribble on a coupon, and I have pictures of the sketches he made. I still have to identify who the person is.”
This chapter begins and ends with a concerned Big Brother. Mycroft knows Sherlock can be a pain, but he is his Little Brother. He may be the Ice Man, but the one constant in his life has been caring for Sherlock. He will not sit down idle and watch him be hurt. Meanwhile, John takes advantage of the location. They are after all, away from home, they are young and in love and, this story is and "E" one. Moriarty might have made an agreement of sorts with The English Government, but still has some things to say. Will it be enough to send Sherlock on a solo mission to stop him?
“These are very impressive, John.” commented Dr Gates said as she looked through them. “I especially like this one, the looks between Sherlock and Rosie are very emotive, the background characters well drawn out.” Beverly’s expression was filled with admiration. “So what was the aftermath of your surprise? You were worried he would balk at the responsibility, or that he would be overwhelmed.”
“You are still very angry at him.” Said Beverly. John’s therapist. He had gone to Ella, but he had to admit he felt judged. She knew him for too long, she had been there for him when Sherlock...went away? when Mary died, when he and Sherlock finally started their relationship. She had looked so sad when John had gone in and told her why. Ella had given him a card, looked him in the eye and said. “I will not be seeing Sherlock either, John. I have no professional distance left for this. I’m so sorry.” So now he went to Beverly.  He supposed any therapist he went to was made aware of the importance of secrecy. She listened and nodded, which was fine with him. Today though, she seemed more present.
“Of course, dear. Make yourself at home. I’m summer cleaning.” Sherlock took a seat next to her armchair, his shoulders against the arm rest, and hugged his legs, losing himself into thought.
To my readers and commentors and those who left kudos or took a look, know that you have made this writing and posting experience 100% better for sharing this story with me. Also a special thanks to Johix for the beautiful art! Thank you all!!
“Well, Donovan was being a pain, something about the Superintendent visiting and kicking out non-personnel people. The one you tripped for calling me an ‘ageing twink’ not the one whose nose you broke. I needed access to police records and registrars, so I came here.” he said.
John groaned. He had known there would be an issue with those, though he had dared to hope she would forget them. They had been a present from Sherlock, her last birthday they were still together.
“Well, Rosie would stay overnight, she could be at Mrs Hudson’s until he gets home. He usually answers texts with Rosie’s name in them. I wonder what is going on?” John asked.
Luther looked at him, as if deducing him again. “He went dancing at the disco, where I’ve been DJing, and man, can he dance.”
“Yes, but I find myself still doubting. All of the fighting, the bad times, should we be trying again? He left, but now he says he will stay. If I bring him home, and he leaves again, I just won’t be able to get over it...”
“I’m certain that is none of your business. Now I will go see him. If you haven’t ordered to keep me away from him.” John said.
Sherlock positioned himself, knees on the bed, hands on the frame, the bigger man moved his hands along Sherlock’s legs, kissed his shoulders, and his back. He gently entered Sherlock, holding on to his hips, and went as deep as he could get. Sherlock shivered. Luther kissed him, rocking, gently, one arm reaching around, holding Sherlock’s chest.
“True, but I would have followed you.”  They kissed and that night, John made sure he made Sherlock say his name, even though he did it softly, as Rosie was in her room.
The DJ looked at Sherlock for a while, thinking. He seemed to come to a conclusion then answered; “If you two are truly broken up, what you do is your business alone, baby. But you should only do what feels right to you. Both of us have to be ok with this”.
“Well, now we know what to focus on. Self acceptance and self worth, communication, effective, loving  interactions, reacting sensibly to a partner’s expressions. There are no guarantees that you can retake your relationship as it was, John, but you can certainly work to ensure the relationship you can have with Sherlock from here on, be it as it may, will be real, communicative and supportive.
“Your specialist is Sherlock Holmes.” said John, looking at the detective, crouched down, Belfast dragging on the already dusty, sparse grass at that side of the park, his curls all flying around in the wind, no gloves today.
Sherlock went to bed with a man other than John, for the first time in 9 years. They stood in the room next to the bed. Luther was big. And gentle, and kind. When Luther took off his shirt, and exposed that toned, gorgeous chest and those strong arms, Sherlock remembered what desire felt like. Just plain
“I only agreed to consider working with the program so we could open something similar at Barts. It would mean a couple of conferences here and at Coswells. I have no idea where Fazel got the commute plan. I have never even met the man! Please, Sherlock. You and Rosie are the most important people in my life. I would never accept a position that would take me away from you!! Please believe me love,” John could barely contain his panic.
“No, how could you know? She never says a word about what she does with the other. You two cook together? She actually eats?”
The man reached his car, and got away. John had the presence of mind to press the 999 on his phone as he reached Sherlock. Still alive. Oh Christ, he was reaching up. John stopped Sherlock’s hands from touching his neck and the blood that covered his shirt.
Two weeks later, Rosie went to Mrs Hudson: “Nana, do you know what happened to Sherlock? He can’t eat, cause he’s doing that thing where he puts the tiny bit of food in and can’t swallow. And he’s complaining about noise. He’s grumpy, but trying to hide it. Did he have a migraine? Or maybe one coming in?
Sherlock disengaged and got up on wobbly legs to get flannels to clean John up. He also gave him a glass of water and then covered him with the comforter. He took a long time in the shower. John started to get worried.
“The bloody work is not everything, Sherlock!! You have responsibilities other than your fucking cases! You have a daughter who looks up to you, who asks incessantly about you while you don’t even bother calling, not to mention a partner…”
Now, Sherlock was curled up in the small couch, pretending to watch reruns of the The Great British Bake Off, from the time it still had Sue Perkins on, but he wasn’t commenting on any of it. John gave him his tea cup, and sat next to him, promptly getting an armful of Sherlock, his soft curls settling in the space between his shoulder and his neck. John put down his cup, made circles on his chest with one hand, kissed the curls, carded them with the other hand. He thought Sherlock had fallen asleep, but he turned around and asked “bed?”
“I thought you would figure that out. You don’t have to keep them now. You could wait until you retire.”
“Oh!...so are we meeting Sherlock at the station? What are we going to do in Cardiff, anyways? Will we go on a case?”
There really was a lot to learn from Mary Morstan. Not only was she an assassin, she was also a master in creating new identities. Your friend isn’t the first husband she left behind! She was a master at diverting funds to unsuspected places! It’s believed she has hidden a small fortune in different countries.Tempting, don’t you think? Really not much hope as to finding it, but you would think the girl would have the right to know her mother was a genius too, albeit an evil one. Those notes about her being just like her mum where just put in for revenge, and to satisfy Douglas. The poor sod thought he had a chance with me. I just had some fun. How long do you think I will get, with no proof against me and paper notes covered in Douglas’ DNA?”
Something was wrong. He felt it. Just one more hour and he could pick Watson up from school. His skin itched, his arms, his scalp. The lights were too bright. He could hear Mrs. Hudson clinking the spoon on the rim of her teacup downstairs. He had trouble staying still.
“She should be on my side. My parents are both deceased. Yours are alive, it will appear you have three!” Said John.
“I guess we can do it, for Rosie. Thank you for the information John. I believe it will prove relevant to the case. I will let you know. And, I...will answer your texts.” He hung up without waiting for an answer. But at least, there was that.
Now, for the first time, John felt fear, cold and pitting in his stomach. But, no. Sherlock would never agree...No. not even after all those things they had said…
The notes had started with infantile messages “Aren’t you ashamed to have two fathers?. A pretty girl like you deserves a mom.” and “Stay away from the detective, he’ll make you a freak like him.” The last ones showed a definite escalation. “I have already instructed you on how to look for your mother’s hidden accounts. If you continue to ignore me, I will abduct you from school. You have no idea who I am, but I promise you, you would never see your dads again.” and “We are done waiting. You have failed in providing us simple information you could have found in your own home. Expect to be with us anytime today.”
When John had gone over what he had said, Harry just listened quietly, eyes down hands on her Ginger Beer. When he got to what Sherlock had said, she interrupted.
Sherlock worked all night long at cleaning the flat. This had been the longest time John had been away since he came back to Baker. He had gone for a holiday at Harry’s (He had asked Sherlock to come with, but Harry and Clara lived in Cardiff). From there he had gone to a medical conference. Sherlock had been sure he would have died of boredom if he went, but he hadn’t counted on dying of — loneliness? heartache? For Rosie, of course. He had been in an absolute strop when John told him of course he was taking 3 year old Rosie with him, and during the conference she would stay with Harry. Three weeks in total. They were finally coming home.
At the reception, Sherlock gave his best man speech and John couldn’t help but noticing the difference from the last time he had such a task. Sherlock was happy. It was noticeable in his eyes, his looks for the grooms, his rare smiles. He spoke about Lestrade, how much he had helped Sherlock when he had been a lost, confused young man, and how, in spite of Sherlock’s temper, he had remained a true friend.
“Ms O’Keillie? The substitute director you got fired, when your ex came to his senses, threw you out with the trash and took you off of the child’s papers. You made such a racket the higher uppers never called her again.” Reid growled.
So John scolded him for not getting himself checked out, not knowing he had been a mess, not knowing he was currently thinking of how to carry out the numerous experiments he had thought up that featured John’s beard. Experiments on himself especially. That beard against his face, his neck, the roughness, the tickles. Oh no! His traitorous body, the flat was so hot, or Sherlock was getting sick, he was positively feverish. Kept looking up to John’s face. He had to pull a towel over his lap to cover the obvious, and sit on his hand to stop it from reaching up and touching the doctor’s face.
"He didn't care that we left" Chuckling John nodded, Hamish didn't even look back once the boy came to drag him away John was content at the moment but the way Hamish easily left was heartbreaking. He wanted tears, yelling, but he got nothing.
Hamish was short for a three-year-old but not too short for the doctors to worry but it didn't stop John, he knew what it felt like to not reach the top shelf and have Sherlock lean over him to pull it down easily because he had trees for legs.
“It’s been two years” His mother shrugged looking even more worn out then she had “Some young thing came stumbling in town and caught his attention and I woke up one morning with all his things missing”
“No, I’m afraid we can’t,” Mycroft forced an empathetic smile, “but I suppose that’s why I’ve come after all,” he paused, his gaze softer, searching for a spot to get lost in. “I owe you my deepest apologies, John. The last time we met, you were right. Feeding Moriarty information about Sherlock was the biggest mistake I’ve ever made. It’s cost my brother’s life, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to get rid of the terrible guilt that’s taken hold of my heart.”
The survivors still cheer. They notice only Voldemort’s body, but not all the other ones lying in the Hall. And John decides, then, that the war, the deaths, will never have been worth it in the end. Not if no one’s learnt their lesson.
John huffed. “Alright,” he said, not entirely happy with it but knowing his friend was right. “Just a few, and then we’re leaving.”
John went into the kitchen and fetched her a glass of water. “Here”, he said, handing it to her. “I could also give you something to help you sleep, if you want”, he offered. He supposed Helen was too anxious to get any sleep at all.
Suddenly, John's hand was holding his, and before Sherlock could even begin to ask, he felt his whole body contort. It bent in all directions, his eyes sinking into his skull, his arms stretching out. It was as though he was being sucked by a vacuum cleaner. And then…
Before Sherlock stood the man he most trusted. The person he loved and valued the most in the world. And yet, in the blink of an eye, he had turned into a complete stranger.
It had only been a few minutes since John had left – Sherlock was fruitlessly trying to pluck the E string of his Stradivarius – when he felt himself being torn apart, as if he were fading. He panicked at first, thinking he was moving onto another existential plane (maybe Heaven, or Hell, or perhaps a different form of afterlife from some religion he’d deleted from his mind); but after some moments, he opened his eyes and found himself out on the street, standing just a few metres from John.
“Oh,” John said, frowning. “Right, um... sorry,” he apologised, offering a shy, if awkward, smile. “I’ll just... go make breakfast.”
“Don’t worry. I’m okay”, she assured. “It will never be easy to live without Julia. But now that I know what happened to her, at least I’ve found a little peace. It’s not perfect”, she said, “but it’s better than nothing.”
There was something in Sherlock’s expression that John couldn’t quite put his finger on. He would’ve said he looked sad but… that wasn’t it. It wasn’t just sadness. Was it anger? Denial?
“It’s not, though I do suppose it was the only logical way for me to react; but it was still wrong of me to ignore you after everything we’re both going through.”
John chuckled fondly, taking Sherlock’s hands in his. “I’d love to have you as my partner”, he smiled back.
“I need to tell you something, but... I’m not sure how you’ll feel about it,” he said, trying to break it slowly.
. It would’ve been a good way to escape his boredom, but he didn’t need to sleep. Therefore he couldn’t. Oh, how he envied John, who was in bed upstairs.
Sherlock watched as John raised his wand and began to cast different spells. It was so strange to see him do so. Sherlock couldn’t help but stare, mesmerised. The traces of John's wand upon the air were elegant, and from his mouth emanated all sorts of enchantments, which would’ve been foreign to Sherlock’s ears had he not known Latin.
chair!” Sherlock complained, fruitlessly: Mycroft couldn’t hear him, and John was ignoring him so that Mycroft wouldn’t think he was mad. Which was stupid according to Sherlock, because it was obvious Mycroft already sensed that John wasn’t in his right mind since he’d died.
Mycroft brought his hands to his chin, thinking. John’s psychological records only included PTSD from the war (Mycroft knew it wasn’t just the longing for adrenaline that used to make him uneasy, but of course he’d never tell him). But this wasn’t like that. John wasn’t nervous or in panic. If he were, why would he talk to somebody who wasn’t there?
"What did John's father do when you went into labor" Jolene lost her smile and John sighed he knew what Sherlock was trying to do.
Now, he wants another child but he won't pop out babies every time Sherlock feels as if they last don't need them anymore, and going through sleepless nights again after finally gaining his full eight hours was something John just wasn't willing to give up yet.
Knocking on the door Mike and John walked in to see Sherlock spare a glance before continuing what he was doing.
"I'm sorry you were saying?" Molly hesitated maybe this wasn't the best idea but she couldn't back out now.
After this chapter, I'll be going back and editing the holy crap out of the story and fixing it the best I can. I wanted to do the whole Study of Pink but the episodes are an hour and I'm lazy.
Climbing up them three steps felt like twenty, he came face to face with his mother she looked older and worn out, she had developed a whole head of grey hairs and more crows feet but she kept that charm to her, the one that made her look innocent and warm.
Molly stood on the gallery watching as Sherlock hit the body he had looked good while doing so if she may add.
He just didn't find it fair, the thought of leaving Hamish with strangers and children who most likely didn't even know how to spell their name was horrifying, Hamish was a bright three-year-old and they are going to ruin his baby.
"We are gathering all the evidence we can discover but as of now we have an extremely limited list," Sally hesitated, she presumes that's all she had to repeat.
The tears rolled down her face and the redding of her face indicated that she was either extremely sad or happy, her hand loosely clasped over her mouth made it hard to understand.
“No instead I put you both through something worse, growing up without him probably would’ve been better than putting up with his bullshit”
"The doctor said he's right on track and how that John should start leaking now" The shorter man slapped Sherlock's arm mumbling how some things are meant to be left unsaid.
Just seemed like the cycle was repeating but it had skipped John and went straight to Harry, who drunk herself to rock bottom but didn't care.
"You still contact him," Sherlock said glaring at her as if she just betrayed the world with her choices.
"Couldn't Harry help?" John snorted at the man's question, Harry couldn't help herself if she wanted too.
Once he got shot John had packed up his things and went back to the place that made him run in the first place, the place that held so many bad memories but yet it always held him back in life so he had no idea why he was back. but here he was hand trembling smiling bitterly.
Hamish was a social toddler so John wasn't worried that he would have a problem because it was Sherlock that was having such a hard time with the thought of Hamish being with strangers for hours on end.
Once the teacher smiled at Hamish and showed him his cubby he was racing off with a red-haired boy to the playmat.
She needed to go home, not be in the dingy room he rented so they could talk, she needed to be elsewhere, he has broken her mind and body and she helped him do so. How was this her life?
In the years he was gone he contacted his family once a year and maybe sending cash if he could manage it but the principle hurts and he just wasn’t ready for the misery that was behind that closed door, he needed more time, maybe when he's older and established so he can throw it in his father's face. Maybe then.
Patting Sherlock's back awkwardly John sighed and pushed him off "Get a case and we'll visit this discussion in due time"
While the others complained about not being able to sleep, the heartburn and the endless need to relieve themselves John had none of it yet, he didn't gloat he just simply told them that every pregnancy was different it wasn't a shock when half of the other parents started despising him.
"I don't know yet bear" Walking out the building unto the busy street Jolene tried to hail a taxi, but one by one they all passed her up, starting to get pissed she tried again and with luck one pulled up to her.
Jolting out of his sleep John gasped for air, sitting upright he realized it was just a dream and he was no longer in Afghanistan. Falling back on his bed still breathing heavily he couldn't bear it in anymore, he started to shudder as he sobbed.
"It’s me mummy" Between the choked out sobs coming from his mother John managed to get her into his embrace, he could the tears seeping into the old ratty jumper he wished for a split second he hadn’t left his mother.
Of course, there were many nights like that one and each time Sherlock would caress his belly and tell their baby about the case he had that day, it was a beautiful sight but John never stayed up to hear the ending.
The ride was silent, John felt like the spotlight was on him, the sudden confession put so many thoughts in his mind, so far he was nothing like his parents, Hamish was a happy toddler and he had yet to have the second child but the 'what ifs' popped up.
“I felt so angry at myself for even thinking that he’ll stay after everything he put us through, I was stupid and shouldn’t even lingered around that long, but I kept telling myself that you and your sister needed a daddy, that I couldn’t put you through what I went through” She laughed bitterly.
"What are you doing bear?" Feeling his little hands on hers she squatted down looking her son his eyes.
“When did he leave?” His mother hadn’t mentioned his father in her many letters she wrote him over the years and he certainly didn’t ask about him, but he was curious as to when the man decided that beating the same women got boring.
Noticing Sherlock stopping John turned around "What happened" it happened in seconds, John Watson had a tall lanky body hanging on to him for dear life, "We need another" the words were muffled but John understood them.
John’s father was an abusive drunk who buried it wonderfully well, his wife was a homemaker by force he demanded someone to carry his children while cooking and cleaning. He needed a maid, not a wife.
Sherlock didn't find it logical for his child to go off to school with a stranger and a bunch of germ-carrying ankle bitters, he wasn't pleased that John thought Hamish was ready to just leave.
"He?" She flapped her hand at his question, it was much too early to know but she felt in her heart that the baby was a boy, a joyful, fussy boy with her blond hair and Harry's blue eyes.
That night John laid on his back as Sherlock had his ear pressed against his bare belly and since all the movement caused John to become overheated, the shirt was tossed somewhere around the room while Sherlock slowly rubbed his stomach and talk to their child John slowly relaxed and drifted off.
"She's known about you for quite some time now" He just sounded unfazed at the matter like the situation was nothing new that this has taken place before and he's gotten over the being shocked bit of it.
Now at six months exactly John was starting to wish he could have stayed five months, he couldn't sleep properly anymore and poor Sherlock was getting the rough end of it.
Sherlock noticed John's stressing and reached to grab his hand and while John wasn't expecting it he accepted it gladly. Calming down John squeezed Sherlock's hand.
"Plus I want to start picking up more shifts at the clinic" Catching Hamish as he was mid-run towards Sherlock, John picked him up kissing his cheek in the process.
"I would stand to hug you but it's been a bit difficult lately" Nodding Jolene understood, she had been there and done that twice and was glad she never had to do it again.
"But we are not certain at the moment because it just looks like a suicide" Clearing his throat Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade allowed his sergeant to go on.
"He's going to school Sherlock" Closing his laptop John stood up, "He can't play with us forever he needs friends"
"We believe they are somehow linked to each other but as my sergeant said we are still gathering information"
"I see you're going through that brain of yours but just know it benefitting all of us" Sherlock watched as John and Hamish walked out of the kitchen without waiting for Sherlock to say anything.
The both of them straightened their clothes While Sherlock hailed a cab John thought it over. Were they ready for another child? Hamish was merely three and freshly potty-trained and John had some difficulties while he was in labor, they would have to have a deep talk about another baby.
"That wasn't so bad" Walking down the street towards the busy sidewalks Sherlock and John walked close together, fast and swift as always.
"1345 Harley st please" The ride was quite, John had fallen asleep and Jolene was too stuck in her mind to try to entertain John she had finally left she didn't think she could but she did and it felt amazing.
It had been roughly four years since she shamefully found out she was pregnant with John and even though she wouldn't change it for the world the bruises that Harry left behind and the violent remarks he yells were something she wished to change.
"Both your father and his father were abusive drunks, but the only difference was that your grandmother left him and it stayed like that, but I left and came back,"
"It's best I get going I wouldn't want to upset Harry by me being here" Nodding his mother seemed to understand, Harry was the one to hold grudges to always throw them in your face whenever she needed to win in an argument. It was never safe to do anything to Harriet Joan Watson.
The parents all nodded they all seemed to think that the fairly young teacher was a miracle, she relaxed the parents down, the children and has an email specifically for questions, they deemed her an excellent fit, even Sherlock had nothing to say.
Shrugging Jolene continued "It's one of those things that you see you shouldn't do but go for it anyway"
His father worked at food processing plant, tossing ingredients into large steel bowls but instead of doing it the right way he made a shortcut which caused him his job and the business to recall the food and that resulted in them losing money.
Jolene had many regrets but her children were never one of them, they were her greatest gifts and returning them just wasn't a choice ever.
"Mike Stamford, we worked at Bart's together" John nodded taking the mans outstretched hand, shaking it firmly while leaning on his cane.
Kindly turning down her invitation to lunch John needed to get out, it was a mistake coming back and he didn't want to face Harriet while they hadn't had the best relationship John was there whenever she needed a timeout and he was guessing when he left it made it harder to do so.
Her hands slipped away to wipe her own tears away “oh John” she sighed “you certainly knew what you were doing”
Before anyone could protest chimes on phones went off, it was one simple word with that stated "Wrong!"
“Bigger on the inside, yes”, John repeated. He sighed. He realised he would have to contact the Ministry; and if he had to be honest, he would rather have drunk three pints of Polyjuice Potion. “Look, Sherlock, I wish I could explain everything to you right this instant”, he said, “but I have to go down to the Ministry. We need help.”
So he’d just pretend he was alright. Break the silence, not let him suspect the storm that was going on inside him. That’s what he told himself as he tried to sustain the conversation about metaphysical energy and God-knew-what.
He knew it must’ve been Sherlock who left that note. It wasn’t his typical handwriting – it looked much less neat now, almost like he didn’t know how to hold a pen – but he’d signed it:
“I loved you, Sherlock,” he confessed. “I still do. But it’s stupid, because you’re dead and there’s nothing I can do about it now. I had so many chances to say it, but I never did. I wish I had,” he said, biting back the tears. “I don’t know if you felt the same, but at least if I’d told you, things could’ve been different. We could’ve been more than friends, or something... who knows? But I didn’t take my chance when I still could. I’m sorry.”
It took him a moment to realise what had just happened. One minute he’d been back at Baker Street, and the next, he was in Regent’s Park. It was pretty much like yesterday, when he’d shown up in his living room without meaning to; the only difference now being he didn’t black out for three days.
As a slightly uncomfortable silence began to fill the room, Sherlock decided it best to change the subject of the conversation. “So, any plans for today?” he asked.
“Downstairs”, Sherlock exclaimed. “The dentist’s practice, remember? I paid it little attention earlier, it didn’t seem too important. It’s Helen’s mother’s! Dolores Stoner! It would be the easiest thing for Roylott to sneak in there and let the beast out through the back window", he explained. "A window
John chuckled. “The Confundus Charm would make them confused and probably forget about the case for a while. And the Imperius Curse is… much worse”, he said. “He’d have complete control of their actions; he could force them to close the case or something if he wanted to.”
, playing his violin at four in the morning or shooting at the wall. He should be here to smile at him, to ask him to come along to a crime scene, to calm him down after a war nightmare; but
John pursed his lips, thinking. “I dunno”, he sighed. “Perhaps… a Confundus Charm, or the Imperius Curse”, he suggested.
Whatever had attacked them fit Helen’s description. It must’ve been what killed Julia, and now it had come to kill Helen as well. It wasn’t anything like Sherlock had ever seen before, and John had driven it off with
“John,” Sherlock said, looking out the window. “You’ll probably want to brew some tea. We’ve got a visitor.”
John took a deep breath. “I have to wipe your memories”, he said, barely audible. “I’m sorry, Sherlock, I really am”, he apologised. “But we’re only allowed to tell family. Partners, relatives… Not friends.”
“Oh, like I said, I found it most impressive. I don’t suppose it’s something easy to do,” Mycroft said, honest. Because even though the mere fact of his brother’s afterlife was impossible, here they were. And frankly, he was intrigued by it. How did he do it? Moving things, having John hear him... He was also frustrated, anyway. He needed to understand, and yet he couldn’t.
“Do you think I’m not?” Sherlock said. John opened his mouth to respond, but Sherlock was quicker. “I’m angry too, John. I’m furious. Believe it or not, losing your own life is no fun. I know what you’re trying to do. That’s blended scotch. It’s 68% alcohol and you’ve brought
“Not really. He’s here, I hear him, and wherever I go he goes too. Seems he’s tied to me or something,” John answered. “And there’s the skull thing as well,” he added.
“My ex", Helen smiled, somewhat shyly. “I must've mentioned her. We broke up about a month after Julia died", she said. She turned to Sherlock. "Have you found anything, then?”
When he opened the door, he saw that John’s bedroom couldn’t have been worse. The lights were off, there was dust everywhere, and judging by the smell, he hadn’t showered in ages. It was, in fewer words, a cave.
When John came to 221B’s door he had maneuvered two used Fuji Sunrise Shimano bikes, two helmets and one backpack on the tube. His prize was to see Sherlock come downstairs in new, skin tight cycling clothes. Bottoms down to his knees, black with blue lining that matched the color of his eyes, a matching jacket and a white t-shirt. The black trainers were new, too. The git. John stared appreciatively.
When Sherlock said yes, John looked around and found a bottle of lotion he made use of, as Sherlock watched. Then he put his hand on him, stroking slowly and steadily first, then when he was hard as a rock, John grabbed Sherlock’s hand guiding him to hold John in the same way. Sherlock did, and he also rubbed his own cock against John’s, which accelerated both men’s pleasure. Sherlock came first, and John saw him in the throes of a passion that he, John, had provoked. Sherlock had looked magnificent, and John knew no other lover would ever compare to him, that Sherlock would always be The One for John. Then he was back chasing his own climax, after which John kissed him and couldn’t stop himself from looking at him. He did get up to find some wipes and flannels to clean them up. As he cleaned his partner, Sherlock opened his eyes, and John saw insecurity in them.
Sherlock needed to keep a tight grip on his emotions. The events of this night, had left his feelings heightened and raw. If he abandoned himself to John’s will, they would all tumble out and their night would be over too soon. So he took John to bed, asked him to lay in the center. Their few sex encounters since their reunion had not been favourable to full nakedness, and during their sport “dates” they had always been fully dressed. It had been a while since they saw each other naked, not hidden under the covers. Even now Sherlock forced himself to focus on each body part, instead of trying to process the whole of John’s body. Now he focused on his scar. “
John felt hungry and not at all sleepy, so he carefully got up and went to make himself some tea. The fridge was full of leftovers. He picked some cake, lemon and honey. He took it to the sofa in front of the fireplace. As he ate, he thought of how gorgeous Sherlock was, and how in love they were. To think he had left! He had thought he needed freedom, he needed to date other people. What an idiot. The women he had been with were mostly lovely, and willing, and it had been exciting in the beginning, but he had missed Sherlock terribly. John smiled as he thought of how the few men he had flirted with while they were separated had never stood a chance. He never could hold a whole conversation with them, much less date another man. John knew now, he had needed that time. The separation, the sense of losing him to someone else, to be able to drop the shit, work on his issues and tear down what was not working. They had a new relationship. This was built on the foundation of their long standing love, and also on their iron will to build it up, to make it strong and durable.  John startled and realized he had been falling asleep. He went back to bed. Sherlock opened his eyes, and cuddled with him
The day was a sunny, happy day. The closest of friends and family spent the day with the grooms at the Holmes’s. Harry and Meghan had prepared a karaoke game, in which Sherlock refused to participate, but John did pretty well, although the winner was Mack, with a surprisingly emotional rendition of “Hallelujah”. The grooms had hired ponies and horses for riding. They had a light lunch and then it was time to start getting ready for the wedding.
“He said not separated. He said I am broken up from him. It’s been 6 months and 3 weeks now. So this is my business, alone. I want to go with you.” Sherlock said, determined.
He caught up to Sherlock just in time to see his face go pale and his mouth fall open a tiny bit, as the man, who only had eyes for Sherlock, said, “Hello, baby....” At the endearment, Sherlock’s cheeks flushed pink, his lips hinting at a smile. ”... I’ve been waiting for you.” John felt his stomach clench and his mind go blank. Punch in the guts, lack of air, ‘No. MINE!' thought his brain, and he had to clench his hands to stop himself from doing something ridiculous, like throwing himself on this giant of a man.
They had a pleasant evening with Molly there.  Rosie was very happy to have her men together under the same roof. She played chess with Sherlock, and she sang some songs with her Karaoke app. She insisted both men put her to bed.
“Dunno…,” said the man. “The young one said he could help with it, if I tried a periment medicine. He even gave me some money.” He showed them a 50 pound note.
“Oi John! Why didn’t you answer Himself’s texts? He even called you, and you didn’t respond. Now he’s in a major state! I think he’s reduced Anderson to tears.”
“No, in all, he was pretty subdued. He seemed less stuck up than he has been lately. More present.  He busied himself taking pictures of Rosie’s work.”
“Photographs will not allow you to discern the tiny particles of powder the man has on the lapel of his shirt. No, it is by observing the position of the speck, tracing it’s most probable trajectory that you can deduce it is a remainder, not of sugar from a donut the man did not consume, but of the poison his dying body tried to but could not effectively rid itself of.”
“Oh, you should get dessert? You only had salad, baby, you ate like a bird. If you were hungry, you should have had a proper dinner.” Luther said, as Sherlock traced a line of kisses down his chest and moved his hands over the plains of Luther's chest and abdomen. Live in the transport, turn off the mind.
Sherlock turned around to face him, his own face contracted in a grimace, his hands pulling at his hair, “John you need to be safe! You can’t let him get to you! If something happens to you…”
“Gentlemen, we must go. Harris this is not about who takes me to the ball. I work with John. I called him because of his expertise with the victims. Please let us get to this meeting in time. Stewart is a perfect representative of the Yard. He is more than able to ensure our safety and our respect for due process. John…”
Pretty Ms. Ruiz turned her big brown eyes from Sherlock to John. John cleared his throat. This was just the kind of oversharing that drove him crazy, but it was already done  “The correct term for what we are…” He said, looking at Ms. Lane; “...is ‘broken up’.”
“You berk! This should have gotten at least a couple of stitches! You could have gone to Mike! Now I’m going to have to clean it. It’s infected. Come.”
To my Betas, co-conspirers, and friends, Thank you! Without you both, this story would still be incomplete, on my Google Docs.
“No hospital, please, and no nothing more. I’ll get through it. We should go to a room for the IV...Mike, you are friends with John…”
So Daddy Holmes let Sherlock take his arm, and he walked him outside, to the back, filled with flowers, happy people and fairy lights. Where Mike Stamford stood, with fairy lights behind him, making him look as if he had a halo. Mycroft stood at the right, smiling for once, with Greg next to him, so happy. On the other side were Mrs Hudson and Meghan, looking especially gorgeous. Mummy came up to kiss Sherlock and then try to wipe the lipstick away, causing Sherlock to close his eyes and breathe deeply.
Mrs Burns, looking disheveled, talked to him. “Mr Holmes, we have been calling you and Dr. Watson. Rosie is unaccounted for! She was present in all her morning classes, and at recess she was with her friends, Peggie Stamford and Nyla Woods, but she did not report to her afternoon class. The security officers at the exits maintain there has not been any students leaving the school without their parents."
John moved to comfort her, but Sherlock waved him away. “Lizbeth, your family is not opposed to your marriage. They don’t particularly dislike Charlie, they care more about you leaving London, when you have only just reconnected with Andrew.” Sherlock had stopped circling around and stood in front of Lizbeth
“How could I forget that, Molls…” his words sounded a bit slurred to himself. “...I fucking lived it. Yes he was a selfish, arrogant, dick. I left him. I couldn’t take it anymore! I remember. But he was not suppose to let me go! He was supposed to fix it, Molly! He’s the Great Detective, of International Fame! Why couldn’t he show me how to solve our shit? This wasn’t supposed to happen? Sherlock with someone else?"
Jake Stewart was increasingly agitated. They finally, finally had a solid lead on the “Disappearing Veterans” case. Mr. Holmes had located a witness who knew of a meeting. It was time, they had to approach; and here was Mr. Holmes looking fed up, and close to him, locked into a staring match, were D.I. Harris and Dr. Watson, both intending to accompany Holmes.
“Yes, and more. I never expected him to allow me to adopt his daughter, much less to be the one to offer it. I thought maybe he was using that to get us back together. It seems it was but part of a deeper purpose.”
Sherlock went back to work. He talked with people, and made an effort to communicate. Six weeks after the wrecked night he had arrived at his brother’s door, he felt confident enough in himself to return to Baker street. Mrs Hudson, who called daily, and Watson were as happy as he was.
Wilson smiled and answered, “Like I said, we are looking into places to start over in. He sent me to scout London out. Way too lazy to get his butt on an international flight." Wilson took out his phone. “Here they are,” he showed Sherlock the picture. “He is Howard”
Rosie had long decided that experiments were better done at 221B. John was just too fussy. Sherlock, on the other hand, reminded her of proper scientific method, and let her be. He was handy helping with the clean up, even if John didn’t believe it. So on Thursday, after school she and Sherlock were heading to the stores to find some of the things for the experiment. Nyla was coming for a sleepover the next night. A first in the new flat! Once at the store, they found Nyla, and her mom, Charlie. Rosie nudged Sherlock, who reluctantly went to say hello
John took him in his hand, and stroke as he thrust. Sherlock came, his face a portrait of pleasure, arching his body up, almost knocking John off. The Captain was done for when he saw his partner, his face a portrait of pleasure and debauchery , and felt the muscles contract and squeeze him, and came hard, his mind wiping out. He came back to Sherlock pulling him towards his body desperately, his breath hitching, trying to roll into himself. John disengaged and Sherlock curled into a ball, breath shallow and too fast. His face in John’s chest. He was trembling.
“I don’t see how this ‘investigation’ will help Charlie…” Lizbeth had broken into a sweat, she was twisting her hands.
“Like a right arse. I want to live my own life, but I’m not out to hurt him” They moved along to talk about Rosie and school.
Sherlock was somewhat frettish, but he was determined to prove to himself that he could be found attractive and be attracted to someone other than John. They talked easily for a while, about being a DJ, and an exotic dancer, and DJ, Luther, told Sherlock he was taking a break from his home in NY, where his youngest son and his ex wife lived. He was head of a security company, back in London to visit his daughter. The DJ gig was a favor for his club owner friend, a bit of fun.
John went to him then, a kind smile on his face and his eyes shining. He put an arm around Sherlock’s waist, his hand on the small of his back. He used the other hand, on Sherlock’s neck to bring his face to his. John slowly rubbed his face against his, first the left side, then the right. “Is this good?”
“It seems the two of you should have an open dialogue about these last months, talk about things you have learned, things you are doing, where you are in terms of each other.”
“Would you feel better if I told you I don’t know what I feel? Do you want to hear how confused I am that you let me adopt Watson, after taking me off her papers in the first place? Or how pissed off I am at myself for sleeping with you? And no. You are most definitely NOT coming into the home YOU CHOSE TO LEAVE!” Sherlock was in a fury, totally oblivious of his manners.
Sherlock stayed back with Stewart, going over the notes on Rosie’s computer. “These look like they have two authors, Mr Holmes.” said the younger man.
“I know. We don’t have to. I’m not a virginal girl scared by sex with my ex-lover of years!! Furthermore, I do not appreciate you bringing this up in the street. Manners, John.”  Sherlock hissed.
“I’m starving! When did we last eat,  Wiggins?” Sherlock looked exactly as John remembered post case, hunger included, John thought.
“So you look at the evidence and find the clues other people overlook.” Wilson laughed and shook his head.
Donovan nodded, but said, “Better yet. She’s smart. And it’s a good head on her shoulders, not just daydreams.”
Sherlock only nodded, made an indistinct hand gesture and went inside. John wasn’t fooled. He was flustered and speechless because it had meant something.
most important person in his life. The chats they had, late night or over dinner, he hadn’t had the likes of with anyone else. The things he had shared, the things Sherlock had shared with him, John had certainly never shared with any of his girlfriends. Friendship? Definitely.  Affair of the heart? The heart? Sherlock had told him he was not into women, so yeah, he was gay. But John? Three Continents?
“Molly, for goodness sake, don’t be idiotic! That was then, and this is now. Bill is a proper pharmacist. He works as head of Sanoff review teams for new medicine.
Sherlock didn’t text again, and the rest of the trip was pleasant enough, as Wells stayed away from John. Gianna texted, asking John when he would be back. They had gone on a date and it had been pleasant. They had exchanged various texts. He answered her and asked her out for a second date. She accepted.
Beverly smiled, relieved. “That is a good step, John. Let’s hope he can acquire some skills to help him participate in a discussion without having a meltdown.”
The men are together at last! They are both working to make this time better than before. The past has ways to budge into their lives, but new ways must be found to deal with it. Therapy has helped John accept that people can grow and change for the better, no matter who they came from. Living together again, celebrating occasions big and small strengthens a relationship. Expressing a desire to live with a person for the rest of their life, also shows love and growth. A home for their future, will be the stage to their commitment.
He had once said that he didn’t consider himself anything but mind, and that the rest was just transport. He had been, in a sense, right; but what he’d never taken into account was how just much he used to rely on his body. And he hated this newfound sensation of uselessness.
. Didn’t anybody understand? He didn’t want company. He didn’t want anything to do with anybody, living or dead. Instead, he wished that maybe, if he closed his eyes for long enough, he’d sleep for a thousand years. He just needed to lie down and vanish into nothingness. Hopefully, he’d cease to exist, or he’d forget that he did.
He hated this whole situation. He felt useless. What good was he here? He couldn’t do magic. All he had was a gun. He couldn’t even use his intellect in their favour - he knew nothing about spells or magical creatures or bloody
Sherlock smirked. “Perhaps”, he said. “And if he got away with murder once, what makes you think he wouldn’t try again?”
And if John had no sense of self-preservation left, Sherlock was running out of options. Because there was one thing he was not willing to let happen: he would not have John Watson die on him. He would not let him starve to death, nor would he let sorrow consume him.
something he could do: experiment on himself! There was so much to learn about the spiritual world that he hadn’t explored. What if he
Sherlock nodded. He seemed to be onto something that John couldn't yet see. It was truly impressive, John had to admit, how Sherlock was handling the case. He knew almost nothing about magic, and yet, here he was, figuring everything out as though he had studied at Hogwarts himself.
He meant it. He’d been about to say it so many times, but he never had. And he regretted it, because even though he would’ve surely died all the same, at least they could’ve made the best of their time. But now, it was too late. It was too late to kiss, to hold each other. They belonged together, but they’d never get to share the life they deserved.
People celebrate in the Great Hall, but it’s not over. They cheer and jump and hug; the wails and cries of the injured silenced, too weak for anyone but the healers to notice.
John narrowed his eyes. “So... you can’t leave the flat?” he asked. “I guessed that. I mean, you would’ve said something about how useful it is when you want to run after criminals without been seen.”
perform magic", Mycroft had clarified. "Sherlock doesn't miss a detail. Should you cast the tiniest spell miles away, he would know something was off. I don't think he'd jump to the conclusion of magic… but I wouldn't risk it if I were you."
He couldn’t remember what was going on. It had become a bit of a blur. He quickly scanned his surroundings. He was at St. Bart’s. He could see John. There were some people standing around something on the pavement. Were they...? Yes, most of them were from the homeless network. But why were they all gathered up? Oh, it must be a corpse. Surely. Was it Christmas after all?
He controlled John’s every move via CCTV: every time he left the flat, everything he did inside it (at least what he could see from the security camera across the street), his strolls across Regent’s Park, and so on.
Sherlock watched powerless as John reached his gravestone, sat down against it, and swallowed sip after sip. “This is it,” he said. “Your grave.”
“Yeah”, John said. “Most wizards describe it as a black cloak, so it’s not strange that you thought that’s what you saw. This thing… it, well…” he sighed. There was no way to put it nicely, he supposed. “It suffocates people and eats them”, he said. “It’s one of the most dangerous beasts in the world.”
The place was desolated, naturally. Not many people liked to go there at night, possibly because they heard too many ghost stories. Sherlock would have laughed at the irony, but right now, all he was was concerned. There was nobody around to help him. He was counting on John’s limp to buy them some time, but he had no way of knowing if Lestrade had gotten his message, and he had to fear the worst.
“Oh, I see he hasn’t told you,” Mycroft spoke. The shock was finally washing off; thank God. He could speak more easily now. “I was watching the CCTV last night. Nothing out of the ordinary, except for a floating skull,” he said, raising an eyebrow.
“I had anticipated that he’d try something like this, I had a plan. I was going to fake my death. But... it all went wrong.” If Sherlock’s voice was breaking, John thought, he was trying truly hard not to let it show. “There was an airbag; you couldn’t see it from where you were standing. I had to hit it when I fell. But I didn’t. I missed it by half a metre, I think.”
Sherlock’s eyes opened so wide they were nearly popping out of their sockets, and his pitch rose by a few octaves. “
He tried to keep his dignity as high as he could, his tone firm. But his eyes betrayed him, pained, searching for an answer they couldn’t find.
He considered the possibilities. Julia’s case couldn’t have been closed just after three weeks, that alone was fishy. But it
But Sherlock remained immobile, staring blankly at the cabinet. John frowned. They had to go after the Lethifold, they had to find more clues. Why wasn't Sherlock coming?
Greg had been thinking a lot since last week; mostly about John, naturally. He’d been sick with worry, and he was even disappointed in himself for not having seen the signs. But there was also Sherlock.
brilliant. Roylott had considered every little detail. He had planned Julia’s murder carefully and coldly. It was, magical or not, at least a 9 in Sherlock’s scale.
just been his imagination; but then Sherlock’s voice reappeared, softer. “I’m sorry. I didn’t stop to think it would actually shock you this much to hear me again.”
He couldn’t believe it. She must know why he’d come. Everyone had been talking about Sherlock, even before he’d fallen to his... even before he’d fallen. His name was on every single news channel, and so was John’s, in one way or the other. And if Ella was as good a therapist as she thought, she must have been reading John’s blog as well. He hadn’t posted anything since, but that didn’t stop hate comments from being thrown at him on all of his blog updates. So she wanted him to say it out loud.
“I don’t know”, Helen said. “I suppose so. It was a present from Grimesby; Julia only accepted it so she wouldn’t have to worry about rent while finishing her studies”, she explained.
“Not much. I ought to start looking for a job, but that can wait a few more days,” he replied. “I might go out for a walk. Helps me think.”
“Roylott had always known that this was a possibility. So he made a plan: to keep Julia close, in case he should need to get her out of the way. He gave her this flat, just above your mother’s practice, because it was very strategically located. He had easy access to the practice, so he used his magic to hide his beasts there; and then, when he realised that Julia had finally convinced Mrs Stoner to leave him, he let one of the beasts out through the back window and into Julia’s bedroom. It was a flawless plan: the area the windows lead to is closed; it can’t be seen from the streets or alleys. There would’ve been no witnesses at all.”
John felt himself leave his body, peacefully and slow. And as Sherlock finally held him in his arms, the world was brighter, kinder; and he was younger as their lips touched, that long-awaited instant filling them with joy and relief. They were reunited, the dark nights slipping away, peace finding them at last.
He kept watching the CCTV that night, even after John had gone to bed. After an hour staring at the empty living room though, he was beginning to wonder if he too should get some rest and go on with his investigations in the morning. But suddenly, something caught his eye.
I'll probably write a short sequel. And who knows? I might write more of this ficverse after that as well. Please let me know if you'd be interested in reading that!
“Well, yes. That’s basic for the plot. How would he have met Whoopi Goldberg if he couldn’t?” John said.
Mycroft’s words were genuine. This was no moment to be an iceman. That was reserved for enemies, for shielding himself; but right now, he knew he had no right to ask for John’s forgiveness. Both of them had been torn apart by Sherlock’s death, and the least he could do to make up for his mistakes was to tell him the truth. John didn’t deserve to live with such uncertainty, such lack of answers.
Sherlock leaned in to take a closer look at the corpse, but nothing could’ve prepared him for what he saw: a tall, pale dark-haired man in his thirties, dressed in a suit and an expensive coat, with a significant amount of blood coming out of his forehead. Was he... was he staring at his own body?
This wasn’t good. Sherlock hurried to the kitchen, deciding he must make good use of the little time he had left in the flat before John walked too far. He quickly scanned the room and found what he needed: a pen and paper. Struggling, he wrote:
Helen shook her head. “I don’t think so”, she muttered. “She and Mum argued a lot because of that, actually. Although”, she added, “they were starting to settle their differences not long before Julia died. I remember her saying.”
He turned his gaze to Sherlock, who was frowning, his hands pressed against his mouth as though he were praying. John knew that gesture: Sherlock was trying to deduce something.
Sherlock remained silent for a moment – well, he was actually speechless, to be precise. John had heard him, he was almost sure. But that wouldn’t make sense, would it? He’d never shown any sign of being... what was the word, psychic?
“Experiment,” Sherlock corrected. “Yes, I guess. I figured I should be able to do it, but it’s actually so much harder than it seems,” he sighed.
He hung it on the fridge door just as John climbed down the stairs. All he could do now was hope that Lestrade would see it.
After some minutes of fighting with a pencil, Sherlock finally managed to write a note. It was scribbly, as if it’d been written by a five-year-old, but it was legible enough. He picked it up, holding it against the window and hoping Mycroft was still watching them.
“You were unconscious for most of that time!” said the doctor, exasperated. “Look,” he sighed. “I know you’re a bit stubborn and proud, but... you don’t have to play robot all the time, let alone right now.”
Yet here Sherlock was, all chances of having the future he’d dreamt for the two of them ripped away from him, his sacrifice being the proof of his sentiment. All that remained was the evaporating fog of his hopes, blurry, fading; impossible from the very beginning.
He passed Sherlock his gun. While it was true that it wasn't the best weapon against magic, he needed Sherlock to be able to defend himself.
They left, and so Sherlock and John were left alone, finally. Sherlock was starting to wonder if he’d have to be the one to start the conversation, when John spoke. “Sorry.”
“Oh, you’re getting a new one?” Lestrade asked, turning to face his friend. “That’s, um, good,” he smiled.
There was seemingly nothing out of the ordinary. The only strange thing he did, Mycroft noticed, was talk to himself. Perhaps he was thinking out loud, wasn’t he? Lots of people did that. Still, that wasn’t like John. His time in the army had trained him to keep his thoughts to himself. So the only other possibility was...
“That’s what I should be asking you,” Lestrade responded. “Seriously, John, this is no joke. This much alcohol could kill you! Do you really think that’s okay?”
When John opened the door of the flat, it was quite obvious that Sherlock remained invisible to him. He walked to the kitchen and put the kettle on.
It was larger in size than John would have imagined, but he recognised it at once. A Lethifold. It was sliding under the window, but it wasn’t touching the wall - instead, it glided above it. The beast’s skin was jet black; and had John been a muggle, he too would have easily mistaken it for a cape.
He came closer to the cabinet, wand still in his hand. Pointing it at the padlock, he spoke, “Alohomora.” The cabinet door unlocked. Clearly Roylott hadn't thought to protect it from wizardkind. He must've thought he only needed to worry about Muggles.
That was why he’d come back to John, why only he could hear him and Sherlock couldn’t walk away. It all made sense! The reason he was here was that he
. It could only have been him. The only other possibility would’ve been that John had done it, but why would he? Even if he had wanted to be found, to be helped, there was no reason why he would sign it like Sherlock.
for me and still this is how I’m paying you. But I can’t help it,” he spoke, his voice small and his vision swelling with tears. “I’m broken, Sherlock. There’s a part of me that’s not completely there and
It wasn’t grief for his own life that he felt, he realised; it was rage. He was furious at Moriarty for spoiling everything. He’d known, of course he had. He’d known of Sherlock’s plans to tell John about his feelings. One would have to have been blind not to realise how in love they were.
Greg knocked on his bedroom door. “John?” he asked, but there was no reply. Why wasn’t he surprised? He knocked again. “I’m coming in. Better be decent,” he warned.
“You’re bloody brilliant”, John said. He approached Sherlock slowly, standing just a few centimetres from his face. Tiptoeing, he planted a soft kiss upon his lips. “D’you know that?” he asked under his breath, looking into Sherlock’s eyes.
“My god, was that really the name? They weren’t very creative,” Sherlock commented, raising his eyebrows. “Anyways, you know how the ghost can go anywhere he wants?”
But aside from that, it was the one thing most people failed to notice about Sherlock Holmes: the fact that he, under his cold ‘high-functioning-sociopath’ facade, actually had feelings. He wasn’t a machine. He was odd, yes, and he hardly ever thought with his heart; but he was human after all.
“And good evening to you too, John. I’m glad to hear you’re looking after yourself,” spoke an unexpected voice from the sofa.
, per se, in the flesh and bone. And it felt so wrong, ‘cause Sherlock was right here! Eternally loyal to him from beyond the grave!
John lifted Sherlock’s chin, making him look John in the eye. “It’s alright”, he said. “Now, listen. There’s a patrol on the way; they’ll be here any second. I need you to be nice, okay? Please”, he added. “For me.”
But he hadn’t been, no. He was a genius, a mastermind. John knew firsthand. It wasn’t just his military record that he could read from his tan or Harry’s drinking habits from John’s mobile. It was the traces of Anderson’s affair with Donovan in his deodorant. It was the Woman’s password in her pulse. It was a policeman’s drug addiction in his chin and a saleswoman’s false identity in her fingernails.
“Well then,” Mycroft sighed, standing up. “I’ll be on my way. You know where to find me if you need anything.”
In fact, when John stood up to look outside, he saw Mycroft hastening to the door. This couldn’t be good. Mycroft was generally well-mannered. He always said hello to Mrs. Hudson before going upstairs, and rarely did he walk into the flat without knocking, despite owning a spare key. But today, he’d straight up rushed inside, nearly knocking down the door to the flat as he opened it.
There wasn’t much he could do aside from talking to John, but things had changed that afternoon. John was quiet, numb, pensive; and Sherlock guessed he couldn’t blame him. He refused to accept both Sherlock’s death and his afterlife; but after Mycroft’s confirmation of all the things Sherlock had told him, his I’m-just-hallucinating hypothesis had faded into something impossible. And no matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t ready to face reality. So he’d retreated to his bedroom (to think, Sherlock presumed).
Sherlock nodded, slowly taking that in. "So what do you do now that I've found out?" he asked, not sure whether he wanted to know.
“I… I can't go in", Sherlock muttered. "It's got that… charm… thing", he tried to explain, struggling to find the right terms.
-Brief descriptions of corpses (they're not relevant; you might as well skip them if they make you uncomfortable).
John swallowed. He slowly put down his cup, fingers trembling. “So he lied. Sherlock, when he said he was a fraud. He lied to me and then he... jumped.”
“Oh, thank God you’re okay!” came Helen’s voice from the bedroom, and John sighed with relief. She rushed towards them. “I was so worried!” she said, her voice shaking, as though she was about to cry. “I heard noises, and then I couldn’t find you anywhere, and I… I thought that thing had killed you both.”
A million questions crossed his mind, overlapping. He tried to catch up with his train of thought, struggling to comprehend what had just happened - he didn’t even know where to begin.
He hummed. “And you watch telly. You know why I’m here. I’m here because–” he paused, his voice breaking.
,” Sherlock spoke, his eyes filled with fear and impotence. “Please listen to me: don’t do this. Stay alive, for me. I didn’t die for you to do this to yourself.”
