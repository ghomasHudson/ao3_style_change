“You really thought you could up and leave your family Castiel? No.
.” They throw their hands up, weighing them. “Even ol Zach had to admit it was creative. Great for us actually. You wanted a villain, we just filled the shoes. I mean, I honestly didn’t think you had it in ya though. I figured you’d run off, sow your wild oats and run back with your tail between your legs. BUT NO, you’re out here in the middle of damn no where running the resistance, adopting babies with the mortal enemy of your mother. Because WAIT FOR IT,
“Well you could’ve fooled me. Do you honestly believe they care about you?
"Alright! Alright!" Dean says going inside and grabbing his things before heading for baby.
, but this is weird even for Gabriel standards.
“Sorry.” Cas drops his head.
Cas thinks for a moment, looking back to the irises and then up at his brother. Nodding weakly, practiced, “Yes, Gabriel.”
. Falling back asleep a little easier each night. Tonight, he sighs, the weight on his heart bearing harder and heavier the closer Claire’s wedding comes.
“You like that?” Mary smiles, wiping his cheek causing little Sam to laugh gummily, “oh yes you do.” She runs a hand through his tangled hair.
Castiel thinks.
“Goodness,” she laughs, “Cas, honey. Would your mom be ok with you eating lunch with us?”
Cas watches Dean make his way to his room as Sam sways to his own off beat.
Absolutely not the night he purposely pushed away Dean Winchester...
"Totally worth it babe," Dean smiles looking up at Cas as they bring their hands together.
... Somewhere along the way Castiel had planted a half dozen rose bushes in a variation of bright unusual colors of his own devising, (white, green, blue, purple), in his garden.
Anna and Cas both turn quickly to inspect the commotion.
She sighs heavily, “I’ll try, off course. I’m not one to back down from a challenge.” She smiles ruefully, playfully smacking his cheek before turning away towards her car.
“THIS IS WORSE THAN THE NOTEBOOK!” Jack cries out shakily, squeaking as he falls over onto the floor.
Cas is throttled back into reality. No longer in the colorful, warm garden-
Dean’s eye practically leave his head, “YOU’VE NEVER- How’ve you never played tag? You know-”Dean taps Cas’ shoulder. Catching the older boy off guard, he stumbles back. “Tag you’re it.” Dean laughs giddily, feet rocking back and forth as he prepares to run.
“Hit me.” Jack pops up, sobering best he can. Hair sticking up every which way statically.
Cas rolls his eyes, "Gab, I've drank alcohol before. I've been to a bar."
Suddenly the meddling voices stop.
Cas laughs, “I got that idea when you stabbed me.”
“And before you ask, don’t worry. Dad’s not coming near that door. I told him I was on my period.” Claire leans back into the couch, arms behind her head and cheeky smile wide.
Another bee flying by catches Cas’ attention. Snapping him out of his spiraling thoughts. He scrambles off the bench hurriedly, heading straight for the pond. Cas smiles outwardly, practically skipping as he follows the new bee along its route to the lily pads. Another one of his favorite gems in the garden. The bee buzzes out into the array of crisp white, pink, green lillies. Cas hums letting himself sit down in the grass.
kinda, but she stopped caring about ‘
"You get a room jerk!" Dean says shoving his beer at Sam.
“Don’t bull shit a bull shitter.” Gabriel calls over his shoulder, “Remember who taught you half the spells you know.”
“You’re such a peculiar being Castiel.” They look over Cas in awe for a moment before clapping their hands moving on with a laugh, “
“YES! Here, sit, sit.” Claire ushers Jack over to an open chair near the couch.
Around lunch time Cas is sitting on the front steps eating the pb&j sandwich Claire had practically shoved at him. Saying, “
“Wait wait wait.” Claire throws her hands in the air, “Hold up, dad, our father, was the rebellious child?” Her voice practically squeaks.
“Of- of course.” Cas stutters, in awe of his brothers display. He’s witnessed Gabriel do a lot,
Dean takes a deep breath, "Bobby, I'm serious. Cas and I,
“Ok, alright.” Gabriel laughs lightly, patting his brothers chest. “Just keeping you on your toes. Yes, the cake is all good bro. Remember I’m in charge of it.”
chase
is fine.
And that's when the mystery man looks up and looks straight at Castiel. They both freeze for a moment. Castiel pushes past a girl to get to the railing slowly. Neither has any idea how long they hold each other's gaze but Castiel is positive he can feel this guy's soul. Suddenly the mystery man blinks, shakes his head and turns to face a tall beautiful, blonde haired woman in a tight red dress. They both smile wide and hug tight.
“What happened to him?” Jack ask aloud, rummaging through book, when a word in one of the passages catches his eye. Winchester. He’d heard that name at the Inn before. Stories about two brothers and their own inn out west. “I think I’ve heard of him, maybe.” Jack squints, thinking hard.
“It’s old magic darling, as long as just a smidge of it is in place-.”
"So..." the man says putting his hands in his pockets.
me boy! And are
“DEAN!” Cas starts running before his mind can catch up with his feet. “DEAN, WHERE ARE-“
"Bitch," Dean yells half heartedly, examining the drivers door of the car.
. I’m fine.” Cas sits up fully, voice rough as he clears his throat.
He could still run. He knows he could make it the short distance back to the house. Back to his family. It’s dark, practically pitch black but he knows his way through the field. Warn them in time to-
he thinks again.
Anna smiles, knowing how much Cas loves the photography pieces, "Ahh yes, Reichenbach Falls, beautiful in person. Have you ever been?"
, Gabriel could be in your mind in a flash. But the brothers had a long standing deal. They’d sworn not to use each other’s powers on one other, unless the situation was dyer. “First off we have plenty of tables already. There’s like twenty tables ready to be set up. So unless Claire and Kaia are throwing a real rager, we’re set. Now, you’ve got 10 pound luxury bags under your eyes and you’re running on fumes around here. You practically tore my head off earlier when I asked if you wanted coffee.”
“CLAIRE-” Jack jumps forward trying to stop her, but she just slaps his hands away, “That’s dads- or Uncle Gabes! It’s private-” The two of them getting into a slapping match.
Cas feels it instantly. The power thrumming through his blood as he reaches across the field in all directions. Reaching across the night air for any sign of Dean or Jack...
“What does that even-“ Jack decides quickly to not even try to understand that, shaking his head. “Ok, back to the items on the table.
Home? Nothing to do and no one there.
"Come on, I wanna show you something real quick. Don't worry we'll be back later guys," Gabriel said pulling Castiel up.
,” Gabriel snaps his fingers in front of Cas, “Cas, you
. His mother would drone on to her so called friends. As Castiel had grown older, he’d seemed to find a certain beauty in them. He found solace in his time in the gardens. His time away from
“Oh?” The voice pipes up, head tilting curiously.
"Hah! No! Like you'd know to order," Gabriel laughs turning to Cas and then looking over the crowd.
“I’m here for the boy Castiel.” They toss out airily, eyeing Cas.
Cas turns around, looking back down the stone path. “Gabe?” He calls out. Spotting the man in question fifteen or so feet back, kneeling in the pathway. Gabriel’s hand swiping at the stones by his feet. A blank, stoic look in his eyes.
.” They mock sigh before laughing, “Does he though? That
? Jack’s not- Jack’s-“ he takes a step closer, quietly. Jaw setting as he continues darkly, “Jack’s just a kid. A
ready to race! It wouldn't win against a damn smart car! I want you to fix it Singer! And fix it
Cas smirks, "I don't know if I should be mad at you or proud because that guy... well he..."
He goes to sit in the chair like he has countless nights before without Dean’s knowledge.
“That’s why they started the war.” Jack adds trying to follow along.
"Yes," Castiel says not even really thinking.
“MOMMA! Mom!” Dean skids to halt, practically colliding into a women sitting upon one of the benches. A bundled toddler in her arms. Dean throws himself over the empty seat beside her.
more importantly me?
“Cas?” She calls, looking through him.
” Smiling brightly.
Cas chokes out, coming back to consciousness blurily. Sweat coating his brow as his hands clutch his chest, pulling absently at his soaked tee as he tries to catch his breath.
Dean stares down Sam as he wipes his hands and walks around the car, trying to avoid Sam's gaze, "I gotta get back to work ok?-"
On any given day you might find the owner of the Beehive Inn painting the shutters a new shade, mowing the lawn, tending to the exotic flowers and vegetables, following along to a YouTube video and attempting to fix something he’s not qualified to, guiding a guest or two along in a class on herbology, or maybe just visiting with his children over a cool glass of lemonade.
As the wedding moves closer, Gabriel makes a troubling discovery...
“You got it, be careful boys.” She smiles kissing Dean’s forehead.
“Of course she did.” Cas sighs standing and dusting himself off. “Can you please help me get the tables down from the barn? I think there’s a few Kevin missed if I’m counting correctly.” Cas removes his hat, taking it with his tools to the shed. Already moving on to his next activity. Gabriel can practically see his brother buzzing.
Cas laughs leaning into Dean’s palm and soaking it in. “Come here Dean, it’s late.”
Jack runs his hand along the photo, not feeling anything off putting or magic about it. It’s just an average photo. “It’s real... I think it’s... Is this during the war? I’ve never seen photos of him during it.” Jack let’s out softly.
“Gabriel?” Cas calls out to him once more, now heading back towards his brother. But Gabriel lifts his free hand swiftly towards Cas. Motioning for him to stay silent.
Cas chuckles and goes to kiss Dean's knuckle when he see's the purpling bruse.
"So?.." Gabriel says bringing Castiel out of his trance.
“Tell me everything.” Rowena presses, practically shaking, eyes wide.
Claire carefully sets the photo down and glances over the trunks contents as well. Her eyes being drawn to a brown leather bound book in the trunks lid pocket.
"Morning Dean," Bobby says coming over to the car, "You're here early."
“Check.”
There on a page. No date but the same familiar scrawl of their father, a little more scribbled than the other entries. “He never said it but he didn’t need to.” Claire looks to Jack.
“Castiel.” A crisp voice calls out roughly, nearby. He doesn’t need magic to know who’s behind him.
Hello again honeybees! Welcome back! Feel free to follow along on tumblr as well (geekiest-angel-inthegarrison). Enjoy!💛 Chapter 2 is now updated with the rewrite! (Sorry again for the slow updates work is a little crazy💛)
“Well you know, it’s a touchy time. The worst is at night. He had a nightmare two weeks ago that sorta kicked off everything and blew half the fuses in the house. I just fixed it without telling him because I didn’t wanna freak him out worse and blow the other half.”
, no. That’s just their name. Some people think they’re called lillies,
,” Jack sniffs, “Ohh Halloween Claire!-” he exchanges a bright look before returning to reading, “
“Burgers from your bar, pie, he still won’t eat anything green.” Mary shakes her head.
"Seriously... I'm not just getting drunk so I can get laid, Gab," Castiel says putting his drink back on the bar.
It’s a tattered polaroid from years ago. A time neither Claire nor Jack can remember clearly. Five men—
"Jesus dude! How many cups of coffee you have this morning?" Sam laughs coming around the front of the car laughing as Dean slides out slowly.
"Hells yeah! Two bros, one club! Let's do this!" Gabriel jumps.
Jack’s father. And he’s not going anywhere.” Cas stands his ground forcefully.
” Dean hugs her legs, earning a giddy laugh from his brother as he makes a funny face.
“What if we sent the invite from Dad?!” She grins, tackling her brother.
Dean pauses and looks up at Bobby. Bobby knows that look.
“There has to be more,” Jack urges, turning to Claire.
Claire pats his head, smiling softly before reading on for her inebriated brother. “
“What do you think you’re doing,
“Oh.” Deans face contorts for moment, obviously confused, before laughing easily, “You’re
"Let ‘em have his prom for tonight," Cas answers beginning to massage Dean’s head again.
“My god, I haven’t even got to the part about you yet.” She laughs lightly.
“STOP! Something! Back there.” Jack tries grabbing the book but Claire pulls it away from him. Flipping back the pages slowly.
. He’d sworn he heard Jack crying but now he’s all turned around- Why had he thought Jack would be outside in the first place? It’s so late and how had Cas ended up outside in the first place-
“You could’ve led with
“YOU’RE NOT BLOODY SURE?!” She smacks his chest again. “WHAT IN THE NAME OF-”
broke it! The nerve! Better put a leash on your boy here Singer before-"
"Crowley as in... Crowley Sports Enterprises, Crowley?"
“Chairs?”
"Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!," Dean says holding up his free hand, "Let me explain! I didn't fight anybody!"
“No,” she laughs airily. “I mean
"Oh yeah," Dean laughs half heartedly, "Sam... he... he scared the crap out of me this morning while I was under the Mustang."
.” Cas bites out icily. Raising his hand, extinguishing the candles in basement with a snap of his fingers. Leaving Gabriel in the dark
"I've got your back baby bro!" Gabriel slaps him on the back.
Jack breaks out of his stupor, “What do you mean blank? It can’t just end like that Claire. For dad to lose someone he obviously cared so much for, a week or so after I was born-.” Jack swipes the book away, looking for himself.
tables.”
In the words of his best friend he decides with a smirk, “What the hell.” And heads for Dean. Cas finds Dean asleep on his stomach on his bed fully clothed on top the covers. Cas smiles taking the blanket from the chair in the corner.  He drapes it over his friend. He takes Dean’s arm that’s off the bed and places it on Dean’s side.
"Alright, alright. Crowley," Dean admits.
But Dean releases his hand, calling out an “Awesome!” And nothing particularly horrible happens. His hand looks the same, he feels the same. Maybe a bit warmer perhaps. Cas folds his arms around himself.
“Around the inn. I’ve heard the name Winchester, and in dads book he mentions,” he points down towards the opened passage, “The Winchesters. Do you think-“
"Man it's been two days, I'm not a miracle worker-" Dean starts, standing up.
“Good for you.” Cas tosses out dryly. “But I- I really don’t give a damn.” Cas tries to come across strong, but he’s taken off guard. His mind swirling;
"Dean!" Cas laughs taken back by any type of spontaneity from Dean, "What about work? And the Mustang? It's Wednesday! We can't leave!"
"I'm Castiel," Castiel smiles as Dean and him go to the bar to switch numbers.
“Not that.” He eyes her.
“YOU WHAT?” Jack panics, swinging around to her before he sits.
The first night being some weeks ago, he’d been so distraught by the troubling memory he lain in bed crying silently until his alarm went off. Memories he’d blocked for god knows how many years flooding back unwarranted. As the nights went on though, he awoke more coherent,
she’d fumed,
Bobby moves to sit on the hood of the car, Dean sits next to him. "Well you know, you've been spending a lot of time here lately and when Sam asked about doing this car you jumped on it. If you and Cas are having problems or fighting it's normal. Hell I can't tell you how many stupid arguments Ellen and I got into in our first year."
Jack sniffs weakly, head buzzing, as he stretches out against the couch on the floor, “Yeah... yes... no... shut up my head hurts and you’re spinning. Oh god I feel weird.” Warmth running through his body.
“GABRIEL I SWEAR-“ Cas starts, hands so close to ringing Gabriel’s neck.
Dean's face drops against Cas' chest, "I... it's for..." he takes a deep breath, "It's a birthday present from Sam to Jess. 1963, her dad had one just like it when she was little."
Bobby grunts, "Uhhmmm, everything good with you and Cas?"
“I don’t know, a wedding?” She turns on her heel, mischievous gleem twinkling in her eyes.
“Where are my manners?!” She rushes forward, offering a perfectly manicured hand, “Ms Lavender Opal on behalf of
, twenty one year old boy with no-“ he grinds his teeth. “
“Thank you.” Gabriel calls out weakly.
He's driving down the road, windows down Metallica low in the background, and he has no idea where he's going.
the bee suddenly buzzes off of the iris. Cas loses his focus, the hum of the garden coming back in full force as he shakes his head. Reaching out frustratedly as the bee buzzes away out of reach.
“Wait, you’re telling me those flower came all the way from India?!” Deans eyes bulge, looking quickly to Cas.
“Is there something you’d like to discuss?”
Dean walks into his room to find it dark, then hands wrap around him. Hands that then traced over his body before there were lips placing soft kisses behind his ear and along his neck. The brush of fingers along his waist as his jeans are undone. Then hands on his hips pushing the clothing to the floor before running up his sides and pulling his shirts up with the motion, only pausing to allow the lips on his neck to move. Once the garments are over his head, the lips are back on his body, this time moving over the freshly exposed skin. Also without the extra fabric, he feels the hard body pressed against his is naked as well, and very obviously enjoying turning him into a boneless puddle on his floor.
“You’re the best Christmas present ever,” he says shyly.
“I don’t know if I can do that.”
“Saving your ass, Sammy.”
“Why?”
“I find that I’d much rather be back in that room with you,” he deadpans.
Sam snorts, “Babe, I love that you still hope that’s true.”
“Dammit Cas, I know you’re up to something. And Alexa keeps asking me if my coat is warm enough, if I heard any good music lately. You two aren’t the subtle twins.”
“Marry that girl.”
“No Lex. Let’s just go to sleep.”
“Lex, he loves you more than anything. I’ve never seen him so happy as he is with you, or more upset than when he’s not. I know something’s holding him back, but I’m not sure he even knows what that is. When we were talking that day, he seemed excited, but at the same time, he wasn’t getting some of it. I thought it was just because it was with me,” he shrugs and sits again.
“Of course not,” his laugh holds zero humor.
“Sam?”
“What do you want?”
“Nope. Sorry Sam, she hasn’t exactly asked you to perform brain surgery. Just figure it out,” he reaches for a cold beer.
“Yes.”
“Did you?”
“It was a bit overwhelming. Like with each thing the buzzing in my head got louder.”
Dean looks down then back up at Cas, “you, uh, busy?”
A few weeks pass and now Dean is finding it more and more amusing to tell Sam to “marry that girl,” every time Alexa does something he approves of. Like now as he eats a cookie from the batch she’s just taken out of the oven.
“Oh,” he deflates a little.
She pretends to think about it a minute, “nahhh. I’m trying to figure out what to get your brother for a birthday gift. But I can multitask,” she winks.
“Umm, silver?”
“You’re terrible.”
“Right, well the next morning after breakfast I suggest we start actual planning instead of just the honeymoon. Again his mood shifts. Then after showing him everything, even some that were absolutely terrible just to get a reaction, he still couldn’t give me an answer, so I told him that was the deal; he had to figure out what he wanted before we talk about it again.”
“Shut up, man,” Sam gets up to storm off.
“Yes, and I didn’t enjoy those times at all. I’m not enjoying this time either. I want to know what you’re not telling me about tonight, what scared you, and why you’re acting like this now.”
“This isn’t working for anyone, you need help over this hurdle, Cas and I will help. But you have to do the next step on your own. We have the rest of today to start talking again before we go back to work, so that’s what’s going to happen.”
Sam sighs, “I don’t know. It’s all hearsay, but it sounds like it could either be nothing, or a whole lot of something bad,” he admits.
“But Cas!”
“Oh my god. Lex, I, I’m so sorry. Was that all?”
The car turns silent again; the only sounds being the engine’s rumble, and crunching snow beneath her wheels.
“I’ve tried Sam, she doesn’t want to put the burden of whatever she’s dealing with on us.”
“Mom needs us up in Mountain Home, Idaho. Told us to be careful and get sleep though.”
Dean’s eyebrow raises in apprehension. “What is it?” he asks, walking over with his coffee and donut.
“I hate you. You always get the easier kid,” he glares with false anger at Cas’s smug grin.
“Why is it so damn important to you?” she lets her voice raise as well.
“That’s not exactly what I was going to say. I meant,” he takes a deep breath, blinks, clears his throat, and licks his lips,
“Be annoying.”
Dean stops in his efforts to undress his angel, “really? Is it like a few hours or an all-day kind of thing?”
He brushes a nonexistent strand of hair from her face, “Yeah, ok. Just be careful,” he leans down and gives her a kiss, “Love you.”
She opens and starts to fiddle with things uncomfortably. While doing so, she misses Dean recognizing that her bed has been slept in recently until he voices the question, “Lex, did you,” she looks up at him and sees him questioning the unmade bed, “last night?”
“Go ahead and take a seat. Be with you in a second.”
“I understand. But perhaps you can try telling me what’s made you upset.”
“Merry Christmas, Sam,” Alexa smiles as they share a soft kiss before climbing in the backseat.
“Alexa, a word?” Cas speaks up while the brothers talk.
“What about him? You heard Lex, he’s not coming near it either,” His tone is cold as ice, and there’s no arguing with it. “I can do this.”
“Then let’s hope Dean is more successful.”
His lip quirks slightly at the corner, “you’ll make a fine Winchester, you’ve already got the lingo down.”
Sam chokes out a laugh, “Yeah, well, it’s that or drink until we’re distracted enough to not worry. Pretty sure you’d need two liquor stores for that.” Cas sighs and walks back into the bunker with Sam.
“Morning.”
“Alexa, you know that doesn’t,” he stops as she abruptly gets out of bed.
“No,” he tilts his head at Dean’s sudden shyness.
Opening the door he he finds his mind running at full speed,
“That could work.”
They’re both quiet for a moment before Dean speaks up again, “and you haven’t brought that up to her.”
“I should get my head out of my ass, and stop being an idiot?”
“Dean,” Cas’s tone is low and borderline threatening.
“Heads.”
Dean watches him fidget and takes another gulp before setting it on the table. He leans back and crosses his arms, “that’s not it. Remember Lily Saunders?
“He’s as bad as Cas sometimes. He texted me, wait. What time did you call him?”
“Yeah basically. I bet it’ll go fast with both of us.”
“Ok, different tactic, what do you already have thoughts on?”
“Probably, um, come on,” she takes his hand and ends up walking to her old room.
He can’t remember the last time he had a dream like that about someone he was actually with. Enjoying the memory before it fades, he hears the door open and close. There’s rustling of clothing hitting the floor and then the bed dips under the weight of his boyfriend.
“Kinda.”
“Cas?”
“Party pooper. May not rain then.”
“You, Cas, and Lex.”
Cas shakes his head and runs his hand through Dean’s hair, “that so?”
She sighs, “yes. Well I bought two things from there, but, yes,” she stands, “hang on.”
“You don’t have to apologize for that. You need a distraction,” he runs a hand through her hair and kisses her shoulder.
“I’m just saying, it’s been the plan for months now and there doesn’t seem to be much progress.”
Dean finally relaxes and stands back up again, “I won’t do it again, now, let’s get some grub and figure out what we’re walking into, huh?” She nods and with a few swipes to rid her cheeks of stray tears she stands as well and they head back out. They take their time and scope out the town. Walking into a bar for some lunch, they quickly figure out it's a hunter hang out. Word travels fast about the ‘newbies’ in town and they quickly have a list of accused to check out first.
“Yep. So we good with the questioning?” It’s his turn to nod. “Ok cool, see you in a bit baby,” she continues to walk to the shower.
Dean nods and stands, “Ok, then.” As he passes, he pats Sam’s shoulder. Sam just rests his head in his hand and stares at the map up on his laptop, instead of watching as his brother leaves the room.
“Well, Cas and Lex will figure out the best plan for her, while we figure out a plan for you.”
Still not believing it, “yeah, like how we bicker, and fight, and have tried to kill each other all those times; Stuff of legends,” he scoffs.
It’s not for long, and she wakes up when Sam starts kissing her jaw. “Hey,” he smiles as she blinks her eyes open.
_____
“I sent Cas to the store to get snacks and stuff for the day. We’re not going out in this, so I figured a day in would be, um,” he runs his hand over the back of his neck, “fun.”
“What would they want though? What could we have that they’d need or want?”
“So what happened?” Sam asks.
“Again?” Dean couldn’t have heard that right.
“Well it’s not my fault.”
When Cas and Alexa return Sam proudly holds up the notebook, “can we go over it later though? I’d rather apologize first.”
“Sam,” she whines upset he may have ruined their vacation.
“She won’t talk to me. Can you guys try? As much as I hate it, she’ll tell you two more easily than she will me,” he huffs against the island.
“Yep,” her hands glide over his back and down his sides. When her nails gentle scratch at the hem of his pants he lifts his hips to let her slide them off.
“I could drive,” the angel smirks.
“Cas, man, I can’t lose you again.”
Alexa quickly catches on to his concern. “I promise, Cas. I’ll watch out for him.”
“If it were only that simple, he,” she purses her face, “he didn’t even actually DO anything. But THAT’S basically the problem.”
Sam watches as she gets under the covers and pick up her phone. She starts typing and scrolling when he asks, “what are you planning?”
“I do!” Sam’s anger breaks.
He smiles sleepily as he curls around Cas’s warm form.
“You still are. I’m just still more of an expert on Dean than you.”
“I’m gonna show you,” she holds up the bag.
“I think I’d be willing to hear you out. Help me get me stuff from my room?”
“How would I know that?”
“Course not. There would have been some very different tactics if that were the case. And I could say that you were the one to use sex to get me to stop talking about Dean’s birthday.”
“Because then you end up bottling it up and never talking about it! I can’t deal with that.”
“Yeah, and get this,” he scans the screen until he finds what he’s looking for, “Here, ‘they’re saying it’s ‘A’ again. Not sure if you ever heard of them.’ ” He doesn’t see his brother almost choke and widen his eyes as he continues reading. “ ‘Cruelest SOB you ever wanna meet according to the stories. Could be the reason it’s been quiet on the heavenly front lately.’ It continues too,” he finishes almost angrily.
Noticing the shift she has to admire in some respect how he’s able to control himself. “How are you able to handle this?”
Dean runs his hand over his mouth and keeps his eyes on the road. The rest of the drive goes quickly with little conversation. When they get to the hotel and check in, Dean takes his time getting to the room because he knows Alexa is going to be on him about what they’ve been hiding. Entering the room, Alexa drops her bag on the bed, then sits at the foot, crossed-legged.
“IS,” he corrects.
After a short time all four meet back up in the garage. “You guys have everything?” Sam asks restlessly, while watching Dean and Alexa load up Baby.
“Yeah?” he’s already walking towards the bathroom.
They look up when Dean clears his throat. Sam’s smile at seeing his brother falters when he steps aside and ushers Alexa in, “now here’s what’s going to happen, you,” he points at Sam who gapes at him like a fish, “are going to take the night and do what you know you need to, while Alexa does the same.”
“Of course not, do you want to change though?”
“Dean,” the tone is so soft Dean finds himself looking up. “The fear I felt, was that you afraid I left you?”
“Yes, but we should go in,” he takes Dean’s hand in his, “in a minute.”
Sam stares stunned, “how, how do you know I’m worried about something?”
“You, uh, you know you never said all he did to you,” he tries unsteadily.
However when they’re on a nachzehrer case with Mary, things come to a head. Coming up with a plan that Cas and Alexa would stay behind with the lock box, while the brothers and their mother would draw them back to the house. Apparently the plan didn’t make its way to the nachzehrer, because while walking back they see the angel and huntress cutting through the small pack.
Sam’s lips twitch into a smile, “yeah, yeah, course.”
He shrugs, “time in the cage with him I guess. And I have you to look out for now. But, uh, they went upstairs already?”
_____
“Exactly, Sam, they think it’s her. I’m not going to hand her over to them!”
She drops her eyes, “and the two nights before. Probably tonight too.”
Sam on the other hand is finding it less and less amusing, “Dean would you stop? It’s not funny anymore.”
“I heard the door,” they talk over each other. When they realize it they take a breath and step back from each other.
he thinks stretching his aching body.
Seeing Cas in the driver seat she sends a prayer for him to stop.
“I know, this is just, well, I don’t know. I guess I’m just used to always going to him.”
“Sam, duck!” Alexa warns as she throws the angel blade with graceful precision into the vamp’s head.
“I thought I was over this whole ‘Alexa makes me stupid’ thing.”
“Dean, what’re you doing?”
With a single nod, the matter is settled. “You’re right. And I promised Cas I’d look out for you. I just can’t help feeling that we should’ve given this to someone else. Why did we take it anyway?”
“I, um, I can try a little harder,” Dean admits with a shrug. “We’ve kept our distance since it started.”
Dean switches positions so that he’s kneeling in front of her. “Sam was freaking out just reading the email. I didn’t think his head would be in the game, he’d be too busy protecting the idea of you.”
“Sure, let’s go with that. Because I know for a fact he wants a life with you.”
, Dean thinks fondly with a shake of his head. His lips continuing to kiss the soft skin.
“They’re helping us? I wonder what that cost.”
“So you, uh, still wanna get married then?”
Dean sighs and sits across from him, “dude, I get it, but if you really want this, it shouldn’t be that hard.”
Alexa shakes her head, “you had fun on your birthday, didnt you?”
“Uh uh,” he shakes his head. “That,” he points, “should only be for Sammy.”
Dean coughs, “Uh, no, actually. He had to move on to a case up north.”
Dean groans and scrubs his hand over his face, “what the hell happened? We were gone three days. You guys seemed fine when we left dinner.”
“Wait, you didn’t?”
Dean tries to understand that but then shakes his head, “nope, I’m gonna need more than that. Should I sit too?”
“Huh,” they start walking when the girl in question comes up to them looking a bit out of breath.
“Dean,” he warns, “sleep. I JUST fixed the bulbs remember?” his body shakes with a relaxed laugh.
“Yeah,” his tone screams restrained anger. “Have you heard any of these rumors?”
“Not what you said last night.”
“No of course not. It’s mine.”
Then he came back to his room and, must’ve passed out. Oh yeah, and the dream.
“Might be smart to buy stock in them, babe,” he wiggles his hips and Cas’s hand lightly smacks his arm.
“I didn’t tell her Sammy, I swear,” he barely gets out between laughs.
“Red Rock, Oklahoma. About four hours from here.”
“Then,” he thinks then turns back to her with wide eyed realization. “He showed you each time we died didn’t he?”
“I thought you left, Cas,” he holds up his hand to stop Cas’s protest. “I thought you left, me,” he breaks eye contact and looks at the floor. He hears Cas shift and still can’t bring himself to see what he’s doing.
“I love you too Dean. Merry Christmas.”
“Still raining huh?”
, she thinks to herself as she gradually parts her lashes. The task is a little harder with the added weight of tears.
He nods then clears his throat and hoarsely says, “I thought I finally pushed you too far and that was you breaking up with me. I thought you did regret your decision.”
“Go to sleep Dean,” he says with a smile in his voice, and Dean just KNOWS a roll of his eyes.
“Why would I talk to Sam? I’m sure he’d be much more comfortable with you.”
“Because if you weren’t there’s nothing that would stop you from figuring out if you want to marry your girl in a church, in the spring, while wearing a black suit and a tie that matches the bridesmaid dresses.”
When Cas’s ass backs up into Dean’s crotch his brain short-circuits,
before going to the bed and laying down. Being part of the Winchester’s family has proven to Cas one thing, running doesn’t solve these things, just causes more misunderstandings and wrong assumptions. So instead of leaving he waits for Dean to come out of the bathroom.
“Oh. Um, yeah, I’ll go with you if you don’t mind?”
Sam wakes up as a loud crack of thunder echoes through the room. His first instinct is to reach for his gun, but realization dawns on him as he registers the sound of heavy rain hitting the window. He lets out his breath and relaxes back down behind Alexa. When he does she turns towards him, “just a storm,” she mumbles without opening her eyes, and wraps her left arm around his torso.
“It’s not like we sit there and share deep dark secrets, Sam. With you, I try, but then nothing happens.”
“So almost losing Cas made you talk?”
“Yeah, that’s the thing, I think we may need to make him uncomfortable. And besides, you can go all Vulcan mindmeld on him,” he cocks his head with a grin.
“Love you too, Sweetie.”
She doesn’t laugh. “Really Cas, it’s nothing. Just a bad dream. Came to get water,” she finishes her glass, “and now I’m going back to bed. Speaking of which, why aren’t you in yours’?”
“I never said that. But if that’s how you feel,” she gets up and starts to leave the kitchen.
“Well,” Sam says, throwing an arm around Cas’s shoulders, “Now we wait.”
Cas looks down as Dean seems to have started moving in reverse, “oh, then you should go, bring back previsions, this calls for a completely different set of plans,” he leans in and pecks the confused angel’s cheek.
“It’ll be an IOU then.”
Dean turns to his brother but only finds a closed door.
“Cas, if you’re up for it, do you want to go out?”
“Very well,” he crosses his arms.
“Better,” he leans into her touch. “You?”
“Our lives Dean,” is as far as he gets.
After the third night, Alexa can feel the exhaustion of avoiding Sam with every inch of her body. It’s not the actual avoiding that’s tiring, it’s the fighting everything in her that’s saying she should be next to him. She’s almost done with her second cup when he walks in. The hour would normally suggest he just got back from his run, but this is very much a just opened his eyes Sam Winchester.
Alexa closes her laptop and agrees, “Sounds good, you want the shower first, princess?”
“Ready?” she seems in a hurry to get out. Cas nods and stands to follow her.
In the other Winchester room, lazy kisses are being traded back and forth until a distinctive engine rumbles to life. Quickly Alexa jumps to the window. Throwing her jacket and boots she heads outside ignoring Sam calling after her.
Crumpling up his burger wrapper, Dean stands and stretches his back. They both ignore the pop that sounds as he does so, “Well, I say we get our beauty rest and track down this asshat tomorrow.”
than he felt the jolt of fear,
“So that’s why you came back,” he sounds defeated.
“Not in this,” before he can explain that it’s not going to stop anytime soon, Dean continues. “Besides you have an IOU to fulfill,” his hands slip under the hem of Cas’s shirt and press against his solid abs. Somehow the angel’s skin is always the perfect temperature, and sometimes Dean can get lost in the paths formed by the lean muscles under it. He smiles and presses his forehead against Cas’s shoulder, how did I get so damn lucky? “Then we’ll get coffee and grub.”
_____
“Dean had a nightmare as well,” he casually lets on he knows what’s wrong then continues, “about me. So I left him some space to sort out his thoughts before talking about them.”
“You said it, man, not me.”
“Well, whenever,” he’s cut off by Dean.
“Sounds good,” she starts to walk away when Dean interrupts her.
“How long you’ve been up,” he breathes her in and aimlessly runs his fingers up and down her back.
“That was still two days ago though,” Dean gently reminds her.
Cas lifts his head but lets it tilt to one side, “I didn’t leave Dean. I started to, but stayed here until I felt your fear about something. Are you alright?”
“Yeah,” he agrees and sags in his seat. “I just, how are we gonna do this?”
“No. I apparently have to work extra hard to keep you focused.”
---------------
“I wouldn’t go that far,” he accepts the beer.
Dean laughs, “man, you really embraced the whole vacation thing. Complete with the lack of enthusiasm to get back to reality.”
“Dean, stop.”
She sighs into the embrace, “fine. But what do you know? I thought I was the one Cas goes to for the girl talk.”
“Lex,” he rests his head against the door before punching it, “dammit!”
No way can he deny her that. “I know, I wondered the same thing a few times, but we had to take it because if we had passed it on, it could lead to them hunting you. No way would any of us let that happen. So, we go in knowing the truth, figure this out, and get the hell back home.”
“But you do,” Dean gathers, “what do you want?”
“Are you alright?”
A second later he hear wings and Cas is standing in front of him holding the slip of paper, “here you are Dean.”
“Me? Did I hurt you? Lex, I would,” he stops as her hand clasps over his mouth.
“Lex, just tell me something. Please. Cas said he talked to you about what helps Dean sometimes. Why can you talk to him but not me?”
“Yeah, probably right. It’ll take longer than that to just gather enough alcohol to get Cas wasted anyway,” he smiles.
“Dean Winchester, this relationship will not work if you think so selfishly that you think I would be ok with that choice.”
Cas pulls back, it takes all his restraint but he does, “Dean.”
Dean turns from his duffle, pointing a bundle of clothes at her, “That’s handmaiden,” he says seriously, then breaks into a smile, “And if you don’t mind?”
“You got it, man,” Dean winks over the roof, then walks around to give Sam a quick pat on the back.
“We’ll figure this out and then be home before you know it. But for now let me see your phone, Sam said he sent you the info. I don’t know why he didn’t send it to me,” she stops her rambling when he doesn’t answer, “Dean?”
“Sorry I fell asleep,” she starts sitting up.
“Um, what?”
“Well I suppose there’s no hurry, the rain isn’t going to be stopping anytime soon.”
“I’m very confused. Is this, is this a normal aspect of human relationships?”
Sam makes it a whole two nights before he’s done. He corners Dean and Cas in the kitchen while Alexa is out, somewhere.
“She’s not in there?” he looks around Sam into the room.
“Cas, you’re not planning something with Alexa for my birthday are you?”
Bunching up his pillow a few times he huffs, “yeah, well, you ain’t gettin' any tonight,” and pulls the blanket over his shoulder. Cas shakes his head with a content smile and turns the page.
“Right. Look, I know you went through more than me, but it was just like a perfect storm for me. Everything was so good, and so it hurt that much more. You guys told me what happened to you, but seeing it,” her eyes glaze over as the memory replays, “it hurt so much more.”
“What about Cas?”
“What- oh sorry, you want this bed? I can move.” She starts to get up.
“Dude. Did you really not listen the entire time she was looking at those magazines?”
“OK, everyone back to their normal beds tonight people!” Dean calls as Cas and Alexa walk out.
When the final head is thrown in, Cas and Alexa share a smile. It’s then Mary turns to Sam with her mom-voice, “Samuel William Winchester,” both brothers’ eyes widen at the use of his full name, “you need to marry that girl,” to which he groans and Dean doubles over laughing. “What,” she asks confused.
“She’ll hate me.”
“I’m gonna get some water,” she mumbles as she leaves him alone in their room. With a groan Sam runs his hands over his face and through his hair before falling back onto his pillow.
The angel easily sees it coming as Dean is looking him over for injuries, “Dean,” he sidesteps and smoothly slices off the head with his machete, “perhaps we should postpone this discussion.”
Dean clears his throat while Cas looks over his menu with a smug grin. Whatever silent words they just had, he seems to have won. When Katie comes back over to their table she tries to pick up flirting with Dean, but he refuses to make eye contact. They quickly order and start to talk amongst themselves.
“Not the events exactly,” she starts toying with the blanket between her fingers.
Cas tilts his head, “probably more like all-day, why does it matter?”
“I wasn’t exactly talking about that, I just came back from fixing the light bulbs,” he turns onto his side and scoots back against Dean, effectively becoming the little spoon, “I am very much in favor of going back to sleep, especially since Sam and Alexa won’t be up for a while either”
When they’re finally open she feels a hand wrap around hers ever so slowly as to not scare her even more. Her gaze goes from the soft, warm, encompassing hand,
“Sorry, I thought you were in danger Dean,” he drops his head.
“Worried, but good.” Her tone does nothing to disprove her words.
again, things are fuzzy. He does remember a sober moment with Sam, something about love.
“Sam,” she pleads.
“I’m fine Cas.”
______
“I suppose. What intel shall I gain from your brother than?”
Dean think as Sam quietly starts to speak again. “What I’m trying to say is, we could do all this, plan it all out, and then, never see it happen.”
Another week later Alexa figures out what they’ve been missing in the case and goes to make the call to the county clerk. When she closes the door Cas turns to Sam in complete seriousness, “Sam, I believe you should marry that girl.”
Sam watches her go before Dean clears his throat, “Sammy?”
“Dean, as tempting an offer as that is, perhaps we should wait until you’re awake. You know, with your eyes actually open.”
“Huh? Oh yeah, don’t need my phone, wasn’t much to it, just Red Rock, Oklahoma, crazy Hunter going after angels. See? All there is,” He flashes a fast smile and wink in her direction.
“I can be focused,” she purrs.
“Right,” conversation falls as their food comes. Eating with a job to do now, they quickly finish and leave the diner, and a jilted Katie, behind.
Inside the Impala, Dean turns to Alexa, “So, moping or drinking?”
“Steaks, baked potatoes, corn on the cob, and salad, with pie for dessert that I’ll make later so it’s fresh from the oven after dinner,” she rattles off proudly.
“Woah! Calm down, man, all I’m saying is you should think about it now,” he gets up and starts to walk out. “I’m gonna put our stuff away and shower.”
“What?”
Sam stops at the door, “it actually is Dean. When Cas comes back, tell him Lex and I will handle this one.”
“Just a benefit."
“The dress. That’s all the bride. You get to be surprised.”
“Ok. That wasn’t hard. So no to dress, but what about suit?”
Dean walks through the aisles trying to remember everything that was on the list he forgot on the war table when he grabbed his keys. Sighing in defeat he texts Cas.
Cas’s own eyes fill with water, the amount of emotion he’s feeling is a combination of Dean’s and his own. He kneels in front of Dean and cups his face, running a thumb across his cheek to brush away a tear, “you are infuriating, stubborn, headstrong, defiant, trying, downright maddening, childish, and irritating,” he takes a breathe, “but you’re also brave, strong, determined, defiant, driven, adorable, funny, and still the brightest soul I have ever seen,” he continues to hold Dean’s face with one hand while he brushes hair from his forehead with the other. He pulls Dean’s head down until his forehead is resting on his own, “leaving you will never be my decision Dean.”
Sam stirs in his sleep causing Alexa to hover her hand over the blade, but then he lets out a sigh and relaxes. Her, not so much. She lays rigid holding her phone waiting for the boys to say they are on their way. Eventually she feels herself drift off.
“Why did you bring me?” She asks on the verge of tears. “Sam should’ve come with you; not me.”
“This is stupid.”
He thinks back, the stab of fear was shortly after he closed the door,
“Relax Sammy. Cas knows I don’t mean it.”
“What’s the plan?”
Dean voices his concern, “so wait, you got everything on the list,” she nods, “washed Baby,” nod, “and just invited Sam for shower sex before ‘marinating’ dinner?” Again she nods and smiles at his disbelief. “What’s for dinner?”
“See, focused,” she kisses his chest as she rolls off his lap and to his side. “Now, you think the band shirt is really a good gift. What about something for Baby? Do you know where they’re going on their trip? Maybe we could get them something for that.” She notices Sam looking at her with an odd look. “What?”
The angel knits his brow as he looks up at the hunter, “I don’t like that plan.”
“Do we have anything planned for Dean’s birthday?”
“Later, Angel,” Dean says, giving him one more quick peck as he comes around to the driver’s side. Sam and Cas stand there quietly until Baby is out of view.
“We close up in a bit; at 2. In fact,” she pulls her phone from her apron pocket, “you’ll probably be our last table.”
“Just see if you can figure out why they’re fighting or why he’s being all mopey.”
They sit and she walks to the table, “What can I get you?”
The angel smiles at his mumbled sleep drunk words, “no Dean, what do you do?”
“But why?”
“I’m hilarious,” he says against Cas’s neck. His body inches closer and stretches before relaxing back to sleep. The corner of Cas’s mouth quirks up as he returns his gaze to the outside storm.
“Of course Dean. Anything else?”
______
“Perhaps we should wait til morning.”
Alexa shakes her head, “He’ll be fine Dean.” She watches as he presses his lips into a thin line and nods before she gets serious, “As much as it sucks, Dean, you gotta get him out of your head on this one.” He throws her a skeptical look. “As much as possible anyway. We’re both already too close to this and we haven’t even gotten there yet.”
“I’m trying. But I can’t run through it all in my head by myself. Just please, sit down,” he looks up with a pair of hardcore puppy eyes.
“Oh, right, here, take Baby,” he hands him the keys, “be extra careful though. I don’t trust those other asshats on the road.” Cas knows not to ask questions and instead nods and closes the door behind him.
“Cas, what the hell are you doing?” He pulls the vamp off the angel and flings him aside. The vamp, momentarily surprised by the action, takes a beat before he charges again.
“Come on Cas, I’ll make it up to you,” he winks. “Besides, wouldn’t coming back to a peaceful home be easier than, well, this,” he shrugs.
“I just called to see how they were doing and Dean may have picked up on that things were, off.”
“That’s what I said!” Dean’s voice comes through.
Looking at the time, and getting a little tired of going in circles, they decide to start fresh in the morning. However, Dean decides it’s time for food again and Alexa thinks it’s also a good chance to dig up what they can on their suspect. After ordering, they head back to their room. Alexa reads through some articles as she sips at her milkshake distractedly. Apparently this new hunter just arrived and tried getting everyone else on his bandwagon to take out the angels. He’s convinced they’re trying to manipulate humans into saying yes, and then using them to make war and destroy humanity as a whole. Although Dean and Alexa have to admit there’s a small sliver of truth to that, it’s clear this guy is a bit too fanatical for his own good.
“You ready?” Dean asks before the couple gets out of Baby.
“Son of a bitch Cas! I told you about doing that.”
“Samuel Winchester, you stop this instant. I will not have you blaming your family for something Lucifer did to me.”
“Cas, how do you get him to talk? I can only get him to tell me when he reaches that point, and he’s right, it’s a long way there.”
Sam calls over to his brother when he sees him enter the kitchen, “Got something.” There’s definitely something troublesome in his voice.
“What?”
Alexa sits up panting in the dark, her tank top wet with cold sweat.
She stills as it sinks in, “But I-, What? You said this was someone hunting angels. I never did that! Where did they get that idea? And when I had to kill, it was in self defense…” She spaces out and Dean jumps to her side.
She fills the glass again and takes a few sips, “fuuuuuckkk,” she says softly to the empty room. Finishing her glass again, she returns to Sam, prepaid to at least try to tell him something. Instead she finds him softly snoring with her pillow clenched to his chest. She settles in and kisses the top of his head, “night Sweetie. I’m sorry.”
“I won’t lie, it’s true. But it’s true for every damn couple out there. That’s life, dude. Is that really what’s been holding you back?” Sam nods. “Then you know what you have to do, Sam.”
Cas’s confusion doesn’t leave as he looks out the window, then sits at the table. “Dean, explain.”
Watching them walk down the hall Dean throws his arm around Cas’s shoulders, “so did you guys have fun wedding planning?”
Dean only slightly jumps then rolls his eyes and sends a prayer, “hey Cas, you wanna just bring me the list, Babe?”
“So now what?” Sam asks.
“Did you just use sex to shut me up?”
Miles away though, Dean and Cas are stumbling into the door of their cabin, smiling and laughing like fools. “Cas, Cas, stop, I need to breathe you asshole. Stop making me laugh.”
Dean sighs, “Fighting is normal Cas, we fought a bunch of times before too.”
Sam stares in shock for a moment then looks to his brother who is about to bite through his lip to keep from laughing, “dammit Dean!”
In the room Sam’s almost dressed when he hears Baby pull away. He reaches for his phone and sees the text from Alexa. “Huh, guess I’ll see what Dean’s planning,” he pockets the device and grabs his jacket on his way to his brother’s room.
“So what, you want me to go through the list with you?”
“Come on you sap,” he takes his hand back and they quickly gather their things and head into the bunker. They’re met with uneasy quiet causing them to share a look of question. Walking through the halls they finally come across Sam in the kitchen staring off at nothing, a cup of coffee that, being as its after noon, is more than likely ice cold, between his hands. Dean nudges Cas back a few steps then turns to him, “change of plans, talk to him and I’ll see if I can find Lex.”
The angel blushes at the sincerity, and tries to hide his smile, “thank you Dean. You’re my favorite as well.”
_____
Dean sits a moment in silence than gets up and hugs her. She melts into the touch as he smoothes her hair, “my brother’s an idjit,” he suddenly feels like Bobby’s term of endearment is aptly fitting. “He wants to marry you, I don’t know what he’s thinking.”
Dean crashes his lips, and everything else, into Cas knocking him to the floor. “I, love, you, Angel,” he says between kisses. The desperate kisses start out as a way to solidify that Cas is actually there, but quickly take a much more passionate turn. “Need you,” he kisses the soft lips until he can’t breathe. He quickly pulls back and inhales as much air as he can before attaching himself to Cas again.
“Course,” she walks over to him, slightly concerned, “what is it?”
The two don’t notice Dean come up behind her until he clears his throat, “We should get going. Sammy, behave yourself. No keggers, got it?”
Dean wakes up, a loose term, with a pounding headache and a vague memory of Alexa passing him shots. Then things get a bit blurry. And loud. REALLY loud. But it was also fun. There were smiles, and hand holding, and stolen kisses while Sam danced with Alexa. And damn, his brother got up and danced with a girl, willingly. Happily. Everyone was happy. Then they came home, somehow,
“Yes Dean?” he looks up and meets the soft green eyes looking at him.
“Thank you,” he drains the rest of his bottle and leaves the room anyway.
“We were, mostly,” she starts to continue but Dean stops her.
“Hold up, ‘A’ as in Alexa? That’s- What? Seriously?” Dean can hardly believe this is about the same woman that smiled and made donuts, which are currently forming a knot in his stomach, beside his angel last night. There’s gotta be some kind of catch here. “Who sent this?”
“What? I’m not planning anything. I was just thinking that maybe we go out for some drinks and dinner or something.”
“I don’t know, Cas, I may be too tired to drive back now,” Dean grins.
“Okay okay, I’m sorry Sam. I won’t do it again.”
“Ain’t the first time I drank too much, Cas,” he huffs a tired laugh.
, she shrugs to herself. After paying their check, they head to the first name on the list making quick work of scratching it, and the next one, off the list after a short discussion. At the third address, their conversation doesn’t make the hunter a suspect, but instead, he gives them another lead.
Sam sits for a moment staring at the table like a scolded child, “no,” he says quietly.
“Apologies Dean,” he leaves again. Dean takes a few more steps when Cas appears again to say, “she said mint chocolate chip,” then leaves.
“So you think Sam isn’t actually unwilling to plan, just that there’s something else going on?” She sits next to him.
Alexa smiles, “First hour? They’ll at least try to stay sober.”
*** A few aisles over ***
“Be annoying. Don’t let her not tell you. If you have to use your dominate strength, do it. Obviously you know what is too much, but block the door, hold her still, things like that.”
“So no. It was only three days, didn’t he take a damn break?” His anger explodes and he jumps out of the bed. “I knew we took too long getting to you,” he starts pacing and runs a hand through his hair again.
“Merry Christmas Lex,” Sam gives her forehead a kiss. Wrapping her arms around his warm middle, Alexa quickly gets comfortable pillowed on his chest. He wraps an arm around her back and rests his head against Baby’s window.
“No. Thought,” her breathes are coming a little easier now, “I,” now she can’t find the words.
“Yes, dear.”
The hunter slowly wraps his limbs around the angel and nuzzles into his side. Finding his hand on pure instinct without opening his eyes, he places a gentle kiss to its palm, “make love,” he smiles proudly at his romancing. Or perhaps it’s a remnant of his dream slipping through.
“See ya, Cas,” Alexa says before stealing another kiss from Sam as she gets in shotgun.
“Of course Dean,” he goes back to reading.
Tears well up in Dean’s eyes,
“What?”
“You changed tenses there.”
“Hell no, have you met us? We’re stubborn assholes. We snarked and bickered the entire drive to a case.”
“No Lex, wait. I’m sorry. I just, I don’t know what I’m doing, okay?”
Dean rubs her back, “I gotta admit that I noticed a pink bag in your haul that day, was that the one thing you bought already?”
“No. But I may have caused them to leave earlier,” he scrubs his hand over his face.
“Hmm, you could,” he blindly reaches for Cas’s hand. Finding it he gives a squeeze, “but I probably should. Keep me from worrying too much about what we’re walking into,” he lets go if Cas’s hand and stands, walking over to gather clothes for their drive home.
Just when it’s starting to whisper to him-
"Deeeannn," Cas laughs lightly.
"I'm sorry Bobby, but he had it coming," Dean said looking around.
The mystery man and his friends had moved down to bottom floor to the outer corner so some of them could dance. His back is to Castiel, Castiel takes one last deep breath, confidence building. And then mystery man turns to look at something up over his shoulder and Castiel freezes. The strobe lights hit him just right, his smile is in Castiel's words
"Of course, of course. I'll even get you a new drink," Gabriel winks.
"Dean? Dean? What are you doing here? Is everything ok?" Cas says trying to calm down the man in his arms.
"Cas wait up! Babe! I don't even know where you're going! CAS!"
“I’m good, ‘m great. Just-.” He motions ahead to the book.
Cas exclaims jumping back but holding the bruised hand, "DEAN!
.” She slaps him again, harder.
"Finally!" Sam exclaims after staring for a good a minute.
“Dean didn’t just-” Gabriel sighs, hand heavy upon his nose, “Your Dad and Dean they… they’re kinda complicated. They kinda saved each other I always thought. But again, it’s not my story to tell. Simply put he was the love of your dads life, ok? The two of them went through literal hell together and came out semi sane. And that was before the war. Then they went through it and- my opinion is, they’re the two most stubborn idiots I’ve ever met. Absolute idiots.” Gabriel grinds out, repeating firmly, “It was a long time ago and it’s complicated.” Gabriel shakes his head, running a heavy hand through his hair.
"Yes Crowley," Bobby rolls his eyes, "We fixed it, just liked you said, returned it in the short time frame just like you said, and had it ready for the race this Friday just like we promised."
Dean's seen enough. Not only does he despise Fergus Crowley, but nobody treats Bobby like that.
“Woo hoo!” Dean bounces, waving Cas to the edge of the blanket. “Come on, I’ll share my sandwich with ya.”
"I gotta get back to my brother, but I better here back from you soon Cas!" Dean says backing up.
. We've never been better. I mean yeah we're not perfect but hell who is! But we're not on the verge of killing or leaving eachother like everybody thinks! We're just... different," Dean says with a huff.
“I don’t like it when you work with mother,” Cas admits quietly, Gabriel barely hears the admission, the boy clutching tight as he hides in his face into his brother’s side.
"On my own legs Mr. Winchester-Novak," Cas smirks picking up his trenchcoat and things before heading towards Dean.
and grinning as a certain Winchester-Novak chases him out the doors.
An hour later Cas is being pulled away by Kevin. Something about a mishap with the hay bales.
"Goodnight Dean," Cas whispers.
Cas tries to follow it but the bee flies off further into the bushes where he can’t follow. He falls onto the bench defeatedly, his head falling back, staring up at the clear sky.
"Hey," Mystery man calls out and turns around smirking.
"What if I didn't do anything?!" Castiel interjects.
, he thinks. Because truth is since they both went back to work 2 months ago it's been difficult. Weird hours, half awake conversations over take out, hell the last time he went to sleep with Cas in bed was before the wedding! Now he's lucky to catch an armful of his husband in the morning or maybe share a smile over coffee. Sure there's been two or three weekend days where Cas didn't have to go in and it would be just like it used to be. When Dean could watch Cas sleep in the morning and bask in sweet mix of pine and what else is it he always smells like?
"Awhile OK, just... Drop it," Castiel says sternly.
"WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?" Castiel splutters spitting the drink back into the cup.
“STOP-“ Cas growls, tears threatening to fall but he shakes them off quickly, turning towards his attacker, hands outstretched, palms open, and ready to fight. His magic thriving through his body now, amber glow evident. Power coursing through his palms veins, begging to be released.
Cas starts to argue but it dies on his lips. The two of them walking in comfortable silence down the path. The purple ivy just starting to bloom with its little flowers, creeping up the trellis’ of the pathway. It’s quite serine. Cas is about to start up a light conversation with Gabriel about the cake he’s baking, when he realizes his brother is no longer beside him.
“That’s ok.” Dean shrugs easily. “We’ll stay right here. I have to stay where my momma can see me too.” He swivels around, bolting into across the grass. He turns back, “Aren’t ya coming?”
"Oh you better believe it. I'm a manly man," Dean winks down at Cas.
Cas wants to protest. Wants to, but his voice just won’t. Watching the little family before him. Spending the last thirty minutes or so with Dean. It’s felt the most normal he’s ever felt in his life.
"Not leaving you alone," Dean says stubbornly.
But Cas’ smile falls, “I’m not supposed to leave the pathway. My mother she’ll- I’m sorry Dean.”
. You really believe you belong here. I mean I’ve heard the stories about your little setup or whatever. But I just had to come see for myself-”
Jack moves on, carefully looking through the trunks many contents. It’s filled to the brim with neatly packed books, photos, vinyl records, folded clothes in the corner. And that’s just what they can see without moving anything.
"Oh yeah, cool," Castiel says talking his drink that arrived from the bar.
Bobby opens his office door and peers out to meet Crowley's soulless gaze. Bobby quickly heads towards him, "What is it now Crowley?"
“Pretty please!” Claire interrupts him, hugging Jack tight, throwing her arms around his waist, “You’re just so tall. OR you could just use your mind?” She wiggles her brows, blue eyes twinkling. “I mean I would but I’m just a plain old non magical human.” She pouts, bottom lip out.
Crowley looks pissed now, "Don't you
“What would you suggest?” Jack ask.
water lillies, and they’re not wrong. But the higher classification is lotus or Indian lotus.” Cas stops, cutting himself off, dropping his head. Softly, “Sorry, sometimes I talk too much.”
"Come on. I wanna show you the top story! It's CRAZY up there!" He laughs.
"Of course you are babe. Keep telling yourself that," Cas laughs patting Dean on the chest and going around to the door.
may have helped conceive Jack but that’s where his fatherly connection
"You really know how to let a boy down," Dean says pretending to be upset.
“February 10, 2001, Deans become distant-” Claire reads over the last word confused, “What the-” flipping the pages back and forth. Finding no passage between December’s lengthy Christmas passage which went on for two pages, going in depth about Claire’s first steps, the inn’s holiday plans, and the clipped February passage. She begins reading even faster, “April 5, ‘01: Sam insist everything will be ok, that Dean just needs space sometimes especially when he gets into a certain mindset but I’m not so sure anymore. I know how Dean is but... Naomi and the coven are getting closer every day. I haven’t told anyone yet but I feel them growing closer, growing stronger every day. Dean would be furious if he knew. But he has his secrets and I have mine. Soon it won’t matter though. Soon he’ll be across the country doing what he does best and I’ll be here. All that matters is that he’ll be safe. Ps: I almost forgot, Claire said her first word the other day, flower.
"Yep," Gabriel perks up taking a swig of his drink.
Jack purses, fingering through the records, Led Zeppelin, Metallica, Fleetwood Mac, ABBA-, “Well we shouldn’t invade his privacy.” He stops abruptly, wait a second, he flips back. “Also we’re finding out a lot about him today. I thought he hated Fleetwood Mac.” Jack raises his brow, holding up a copy of Fleetwood Mac’s Rumors on vinyl.
Cas was immediately at his side, a steadying hand on his forearm, keeping him from raising the gun. Before he could ask why, the car parked and the driver’s door opened to reveal Benny.
“What do you want to say to him?”
I was out earlier. It wasn’t actually that fun.
“Wait,” Dean said, as Benny joined them at the door. “You set this up?”
While the October weather holds, Dean starts on the outside of the house. He finds the storm windows stacked in the basement and pulls them out onto the grass to hose off and thoroughly wash. It’s nice to blast his music as he works, with no worry of neighbors hearing it much less getting mad and banging on his wall. Sure, he’s stuck in the middle of nowhere but there’s a freedom in only having to answer to himself. As long as he gets the work done, he can set his own schedule. He can sleep late if he wants, eat cereal for dinner and popcorn for breakfast. No nine-to-five grind, not even Bobby and his questions about Dean’s day. It’s nothing but Dean time.
“You’ve demonstrated a lot of really great coping skills in response to a very difficult situation, Dean. It shows how far you’ve come since we first started here together, and while you should feel really good about all that, we haven’t yet touched on the substance of the actual memory.”
“Good. He’ll be mad I got to see you and he didn’t.” Sam says it lightly but Dean knows it’s his way of asking what’s going on.
Cas leans in and kisses him.
cat toy all in one.” Wait, is it a vegetable? Or a fruit? It has a pit like a peach or a nectarine. He’ll look that up before he talks to Cas again. He puts some bread in the toaster and then scoops the innards into a bowl, getting out some olive oil and a lemon he’s bought mostly for putting in his hefeweizen. As he works, he hears the clacking of the avocado pit smacking against his baseboards.
“Do you know,” Cas begins, settling himself on the bed alongside Dean and propping himself up on one elbow, “how many things I like about you?”
“All right son, you got this,” he said, banging his palm on the chain link since he couldn’t clap with a beer can in one hand. “Base hit’s all you need.”
Still pale, Sam’s brow furrowed with resignation. “I’m beginning to think you can’t die.”
That’s enough to startle a bark of laughter right out of Dean. He sees Henry turn around at the sound but Cas gently guides him forward and Dean feels yet another debt of gratitude. “Okay, t
As Dean watches, Officer Novak gestures to a handful of older kids on skateboards. His posture straightens as he waves them over, and Dean’s pretty sure if he had a whistle he’d be blowing it to get their attention. He’d bristled when Dean called him out on not having anything to do, but here’s living proof that playground monitor is apparently an important part of his job description. The boys exchange glances amongst each other, then begin to ride his way. Dean frowns; it seems a ballsy approach for kids who are about to be reprimanded for flaunting a no skateboarding law. The three boys approach the cop, one even doing a cool flip with his board as he steps off it. Their backs are to Dean, but he can see Officer Novak speaking seriously to them. He looks them over one by one, then reaches out to the boy in the middle. Dean tenses  from his vantage point in the driver’s seat. Cop or not, it doesn’t seem right that he should be putting his hands on this kid. As he watches, Officer Novak places one hand on either side of the kid’s helmet and wiggles it a little. Then he nods and pulls some papers out of his pocket, handing one to each kid. To their credit, the kids seem respectful, body language casual like getting these citations or whatever is something they’ve been through before. There’s another moment of conversation before the boys roll off again, not walking away sheepishly with their boards tucked under their arms as Dean would’ve expected.
“Oh, I do.” She smiles. “I wish I had more satisfying answers for you, but the truth is there’s not one way that this happens or plays out in the aftermath.”
You gave me a scare.”
Cas freezes at the sight of the message. How did he not see this coming, especially when one of the very first things SavetheDrake ever said was that he lived in the same neighborhood as the theater? Of course he saw the flyers for the rally, they’re everywhere. He stares at the message, reading the simple words over and over like there’s a hidden code he needs to decipher. The more he looks at it, the more he’s struck by the way it seems to have been sent so casually, devoid of all the angst Cas has put himself through. And that’s part of what gets him. It
“He wasn’t alone,” Dean says bitterly. “Crowley was driving, like that’s going to help anything.” His anxiety begins to flare again. Jody had promised him he’d be safe, but clearly she couldn’t control what Alastair did. Nobody could.
Dean searches his face for signs that he’s joking.
Dean whips his head up. “Oh. My friend--” already that’s weird. Is Chrysler his friend? Can you call someone that when you don’t even know their name? “He knocked over a glass of water into his co-worker’s lap in the middle of a meeting.”
Balthazar winks at him knowingly. “The fickle muse! I imagine you are beholden to her.” At the door, Cas has to lean the step ladder against his thigh when Balthazar reaches for both of his hands. “Such a pleasure to meet you. And now you always know where to find me.”
>>Do you need anything?
“You do that. I’ll sit inside where it’s warm and watch you.”
Dean reaches for his hand. “That’s fine. I can just lie down with you for a bit.” Cas won’t want to eat any time soon and when he does, Dean can heat up some leftovers. A night off from cooking sounds pretty damn good, as does stretching out alongside his husband.
It’s not like things are suddenly and magically different, but Dean has to admit that being open with the people in his life has left him feeling less isolated and desperate.
But he pulls on the panties as gracefully as he can with Cas sitting and staring at him.
Dean nudges him with his shoulder and they begin to walk again. “So, I shouldn’t demand my soup back?”
“You, too.” Cas realizes he’s already sweating. Sighing, he joins the crowd of people on the sidewalk. On the bus, he takes out his phone to reply to the message he woke up to.
Headaches.
Dean kisses the corner of his mouth, his chin, the tip of his nose. “Okay. What does that mean?”
Dean doesn’t believe him. Not when they’re scarcely having sex anymore, like Cas doesn’t want to touch him. Maybe Cas is afraid of hurting him further, maybe he can’t get past the sickening way Dean’s been tainted, either way, Dean feels it for the rejection it is. And why shouldn’t Cas change his mind? This new knowledge means he’s been duped. Dean is fundamentally different from the Dean Winchester Cas thought he was meeting all those years ago. He’s not the same person Cas dated and asked to marry. Dean feels like the life they’ve made together was built on supports made of sand, that everything they thought was true is shifting and lurching, eroding beneath them.
“Tory’s on her way,” the man says. “Sorry to bother you on your day off, but she seemed really agitated.”
Donna finally steps into the room but before Dean can even say anything to her, a door near the front of the room opens and the milling about comes to a quick close. He and Donna take seats together near the aisle and as Dean watches, the current chief walks out, with Alastair at his side. Even though they’re near the back of the room, Dean can’t help it, he flinches and tries to make himself smaller in his seat. If Donna notices, she doesn’t say anything, her eyes forward and her face composed.
“Yeah,” he agrees.
Dean clenches his jaw so hard that it hurts. “Sam, don’t tell me what I need to do.”
Sam grew up in the same household as Dean. He saw what their father leaving did to the family. Sure he was a lot younger when the family broke up, but he had a front row seat to watch their mother struggle to provide for them. Sometimes Dean compares his small apartment and barista job to Sam with his signing bonus and bright future, but he realizes they’ve both found ways to make sure they don’t have to depend on anyone else for their happiness.
Then he remembers there is no God, no universe sending him signs or trying to teach him a lesson. Just his own free will and, apparently, shitty fucking luck that’s brought him to this inglorious moment.
“In any of those scenarios did he catch you off guard?” Dean thinks for a moment, then shakes his head. “Did you have Henry with you?”
Balthazar buys their tickets and Cas thanks him. “Did you want a snack?” he asks as they pass the concession stand. Cas considers popcorn, but before he can say anything Balthazar adds, “It’s disgraceful what Americans consider appropriate portion sizes.”
“When’s yours?”
Screw that.
He lets himself inside. It’s strange to be home in the middle of the day. Usually there’s an hour or so when he’s waiting for Cas to come home, but now he has the entire afternoon stretching out in front of him. He could take a nap or a shower or lie on the couch and watch a movie. He doesn’t do any of those things, though, spending time walking circles around the downstairs, just trying to get his head in order. It isn’t until he feels his phone vibrate in his pocket that he remembers he needs to let somebody at the garage know he’s not coming back. The text is from Cas, asking how it went, but Dean ignores it to text Charlie instead. He leaves Cas on read until Charlie texts back a prompt “Enjoy!” and then he sits down, his phone in his hand.
Did you get rained on this evening?
“Thanks again, dude.” Dean’s eyes are on the donuts now and as Cas watches, Charlie slaps his hand away from the lemon-filled.
Meg also knows him well. “Since when do you do vague, Cas?”
Dean locks eyes with him and Cas finds himself caught off guard by having his full attention. Then Dean nods towards his hand. “And coffee too!”
“Really?”
“Okay if I choose?”
“I’m glad you have someone to go to those movies with now,” Gabe says when he’s done.
Dean doesn’t even have to think. “No, never.”
“Did you eat, Anna?”
“I know she likes coffee and Dean said she likes ‘nerd stuff’ so I found some Lord of the Rings themed coffee beans and I bought her a pound.”
“Can I—is it possible to try the regular way first? And if it doesn’t work, then do the sedation?”
Did you ever feel like your life is a series of bad timing?
You ever use one of those?
In his apartment, he goes through some deep breathing until he feels steady enough to try the coffee. Instead of drinking it though, he lets his fingers trail around the surface of the cup, as if he can still feel the lingering warmth of Dean’s touch.
“Hang on,” she says, as he’s pivoting to the door. “I get it. When magic happens, you want to recreate the circumstances as best you can.”
Dean rubbed at one eye with the heel of his hand. “They think I’m obnoxious. That I come in and interfere with what you’re doing.”
But when he picks up a chip again, Cas steadfastly ignores him.
Dean smiles with relief. “Absolutely Uncle Bobby.” But what Eileen says next makes his blood turn cold again.
It’s neither the time nor place for any sort of discussion about last night. And he doesn’t need Cas spending a minute of his precious time worrying about him. “Fine. Lazy. Came back to my place and did some laundry and that was about it.”
Dean grumbles a little bit to himself under his breath.
“Your dad. That’s… “
Dean takes Cas’s hand as the sky becomes streaked with darkness.
“Be good for Jack,” Dean tells her when they’re ready to leave. “We’ll be back before you know it.”
“I’m sorry. I’m sorry,” he almost chants, burying his face in the mattress as Cas reaches under him to undo his pants.  Cas ignores him, and pulls his hips up and his clothes down until he’s bare-assed and presenting.  Cas kneels on the bed behind him and frees his own cock again, digging the nails of the other hand into Dean’s side.
Dean closes the curtain before Cas can see his grin and takes a few deep breaths. He has a pretty good idea where this is going and it’s enough to make him blast his already-interested body with cold water for a minute before getting out.
Cas looks at him evenly, unaffected by his heated response.  “If you wish to put a stop to this, you can do so with a single word.”
The fire crackled merrily as Dean’s breath grew ragged and finally he could resist no longer. One hand went to Benny’s thigh while the other found itself in Cas’s hair. He had a few moments to think he was going to get away with it before both mouths were gone and his wet skin began to form goosebumps in the air.
Blinking away the tears that have filled his eyes, Dean huffs out a sigh. “You’re gonna make me say it?” She waits. “
Cas goes teary-eyed again, but he tries to hide his trembling lip behind a drink of ginger ale. Dean pretends not to notice, looking instead at the cat. She jumps up onto the coffee table, tail swishing as she approaches the vase of flowers.
Dean imagines Alastair’s face crumpling in disappointment. It’s not his ultimate goal but it would still be satisfying to see. “Well, I guess I’ll find out tomorrow.”
Cas nods. “I’ve had that happen. You two have come a long way,” he ventures.
to. Cas suffered through weekly phone calls, interactions so blandly predictable that he could practically script them. He doesn’t subject his characters to those conversations, but it hasn’t escaped his notice that he also has a tendency to orphan his protagonists.
“But you couldn’t feel it.”
“I should have checked with your first,” Cas says miserably. “I’m sorry if I set this whole thing in motion.”
“You’re a hero,” Dean says and kisses him. “Are you hungry? Should I start dinner.”
“I know it’s not your thing, but…” Cas takes a deep breath and Dean forgets how to breathe altogether. “I want to take you on a date.”
Cas’s face is flushed pink in the cold. His lips look chapped and Dean keeps finding himself staring at them, wondering how they’d feel. “I’m going to continue looking.”
“That day is part of why I decided to go back to Kansas,” Cas admitted softly. “It seemed like we’d scarcely gotten our bearings after that when my dad got diagnosed.” He took a deep breath and finally said something he’d been meaning to since they reunited. “I’m sorry I didn’t write to you.” He hurried on before Dean could respond. “Let me rephrase that because I did write to you. Twice, actually. But I’m sorry I never sent the letters.”
“Forget I said a thing.”
“And no way in hell am I asking Dean out.” Even saying the words has his stomach flipping in a most unpleasant way. There are so many ways that could go wrong. His brain starts to whir, unable to decide which scenario is the most likely to leave Cas mortified.
By the time that realization made its way into Dean’s dick-drunk mind, Benny smacked him a few more times, counting each one out loud. Stuffed at both ends, Dean managed to get enough of his brain working to understand that
“Where’s Dean?”
“That’s good to know.” Cas crouches down. “Seems like you’re having a bit of a rough night.”
“How is Cassandra Angell even friends with such a cynical man?”
“No, stay here.”  Dean reaches for him.
“Absolutely not. It’s not easy to find someone who specializes in recovered trauma, not to mention someone you click with. You like Billie, right?”
“You make my life very difficult,” Cas finally said. He climbed off Dean and called for a truce, busying himself by brushing the snow off his jeans so he wouldn't have to meet Dean’s eyes, green as the spring that wouldn’t arrive for months.
What are they going to tell Henry? Will Dean’s blood still be staining the parking lot when they next drive by? Henry deserves better than this, better than him, but Dean refuses to fuck him over like that. Making a decision, Dean forces his fingers to unclench and the tire iron falls to the ground with a long, sharp clang.
“What happened?” There’s a rough edge to Cas’s voice, like he’s prepared to come in guns blazing or swinging a sword or something and that allows Dean a weak laugh for the first time since this happened.
“My future totally ripped self is insulted.”
“I got this,” he said with renewed determination, and Cas sunk back against the pillows as he felt Dean take the tip into his perfect mouth. First time or not, Dean put his mouth to good use, and Cas knew he had plenty of experience being on the receiving end to know what felt good. He licked and sucked, pressing the flat of his tongue just under the head, working until he could take in more and more. He worked diligently at his task until Cas’s hips were thrusting up to meet him. Somehow, as the pleasure began to cloud out everything else, Cas found enough brain cells to tug at Dean’s hair. Dean moaned (he filed that way for future reference), the vibrations taking Cas dangerously close to the edge, before he tugged at Dean’s shoulder until Dean pulled off.
Dean can only shake his head. “Sorry.”
“Dean.”
“Okay,” Gabe said, getting his attention. “Where are you starting?”
“You do hear a lot about it with regard to the military but
“I know, but Dean said she likes a bit of a sweet, so take a piece back up to her from me.”
“I like showing you off,” Cas says, his voice rough. “I like letting people see you but making sure they know you belong to me.”
“Yes. Your neighbors would like to request some music from the current century, if that’s not too much to ask.”
Dean finally gave up and walked away. Cas looked at Charlie, his face aching from smiling. He felt light and giddy, like he could float above the treetops. She regarded him with an appraising look, eyes squinted and jaw working. “I have an idea,” she said.
“Your place is hot as an oven,” she agrees, and Cas thinks maybe he’s won this round. He should know better, though, because after a strategic pause she adds, “Probably even hotter with Dean prancing around half-dressed upstairs.”
“I’m trying. I signed up for a class.” He smiles at Eileen, making sure to face her for the next part. “Luckily, I have the world’s best personal tutor.”
“Why?”
Instead, he’s managed to flail to the point that their friends have probably decided Cas stays with Dean out of pity.
This was it. There was no coming back from this. The alcohol had left Cas in such a state that he buried his head in his hands, shoulders shaking.
Dean and Cas gave each other small smiles. “Turn that thing on,” Dean told Ash. Gabe looked surprised but he didn’t interfere.
“Castiel. I know we spoke on the phone, but it’s nice to officially meet you.”
“Mom,” Anna begins.
“Hurt?” Sam supplies. “Betrayed? Devastated? Cause I think all those would fit.”
While it seems like a light-hearted reply, Dean worries he’s been rude. His fingers hover over the keys wondering if he needs to apologize, but then he sees Chrysler is typing.
They talked about sleepouts in the tent in the Winchesters’ backyard where they had to play rock paper scissors to see who had to walk Sam back to the house in the dark when he inevitably got too scared. They talked about the Fourth of July parties, with the long, beautifully done up tables and all the neighbors arriving with their arms full of food. Cas mentioned a dessert Mary used to make, one with chocolate pudding and a graham cracker crust and tons of whipped cream.
“It’s different for everyone—“
Now Cas does join him on the bed. “Dean, getting drunk in the middle of the day can’t be your way.”
just w o w
“I’m gonna go check the security system. Will you check on Dean?”
of their sons.” A moment later he asks, “Are you still having sessions with Michelle?”
They’re both giggling hysterically when Dean slams the door shut again.
It’s too much. Cas is paralyzed, unable even to pretend he’d been out for the evening and he’s only now seeing the message. He’ll try again in the morning, he decides, and immediately feels slightly better for giving himself this breathing room. He’ll sleep on it and surely it’ll all come together tomorrow.
The day passes agonizingly slowly and, despite his vow not to think about it, he’s distracted at work, making stupid mistakes. The frustration over the mistakes causes him to make more mistakes, a cycle that leaves him with a raging headache before the work day is even through.
“Did you ever want to?”
The three of them sit around Bobby’s table to eat, and Dean observes that Bobby seems to have stocked up on Henry’s favorite foods. He also points out that he and Sam were expected to eat what Bobby put in front of them. “I’m starting to think you like him best,” Dean says.
Dean laughed softly. “Of course she did.”
Dean slumps, forearms on the table. “Why is this so hard?”
“Tell me,” Cas says but Dean can tell by the way he’s holding himself that he’s braced for something bad.
“Least I can do,” Cas says, and they sit there for a long while in contented silence. Dean can hear a bird outside singing its tiny heart out.
“I’ll add it to the tally.”
“Tomorrow,” Jody said. “Oh, and you'll need to have fifty candy canes ready to hang on the tree.”
“I work from home.”
i like this guy already. You got his number?
“I’m on my way. I love you.”
And yes—as Rowena has gently pointed out—he
They shake their heads.
“Did you google your symptoms?”
“Yes?”
Dean can’t help it. He tells himself to leave it alone, but each morning finds him out on his balcony. And every day finds Cas’s balcony door steadfastly closed, the curtain decisively in place. There’s no hint as to what’s happening there, whether Lady Marmalade is healing nicely or if she’s taken a turn for the worse. He pushes that thought out of his head along with the memory of kissing Cas. He doesn’t want to think about the way Cas sagged against him, about the softest brush his lips or the warm palm against his face. None of that matters any more and Dean needs to shove it all down and tuck it away somewhere.
“How’d it go today?” Cas asks, after kissing him hello. Dean knows it’s ostensibly about work but Cas is damn well aware it’s therapy day.
A gallery opening sounds truly terrible, though, he thinks as he climbs into the Impala. Standing around looking at art. It sounds so...pretentious, but it makes sense that it’s the sort of thing Cas would enjoy. Dean can look at art and tell you if he likes it or not, but he has no idea why something appeals to him. Besides, it always feels like a trick. If he were to voice an opinion, no doubt his uneducated viewpoint would mean whatever he’s partial to is garbage. Kind of like Sam and his fancy wine tasting. Every wine tastes exactly the same to Dean, maybe more or less sweet but that’s about all he’s got. No doubt Cas took twelve classes in college all about art history or appreciation or whatever and can have lengthy discussion on that shit.
It’s an odd question, but Dean knows the answer. “Well, seeing as he fucking snorted when Alastair said it, I”m guessing so.”
Cas smiles and Dean knows that was the right answer. “Let me go get that started.”
“No, um. Fisting?” Jesus Christ, Dean gets it. He’s being punished for every bad thing he’s ever done in his life. He’s willing to turn over a new leaf if only God will send a sinkhole to open up directly under his chair and save him from the rest of this conversation.
“You’re right,” she says immediately, so agreeable that Cas knows better than to trust it. “Nobody needs to choose.” She shrugs, doing her best approximation of the little girl in the taco commercial gif. “Why not both?”
“It sure is.”
“What’s going on? I’m in no rush.”
“Or bang down the door.” Dean sighs. “I miss our cat.”
Dean laughs. Yeah, that’s about right.
“You what?” Cas and Charlie said in unison.
“But her favorite color is yellow.”
“It’s perfect.”
“No,” Cas says again, the corners of his mouth turning down.
“So, previously we talked about dissociation.”
, as Dean texted one night.
Content warnings for Dean having increased suicidal thoughts and ideation. Another character shares her own story of being abused by her uncle who was a priest.
Speaking of Sam, he texted pictures from the wine tasting weekend, and Dean has to admit it’s good to see him away from the office for a change. Eileen’s captured him walking through the vineyard, rows of vines heavy with grapes on either side of him. He’s smiling, the sun on his face. In another, the two are standing in front of a giant wooden cask, Sam’s arm easily around Eileen’s shoulders. She’s tiny, tucked into his side, her eyes bright and her smile wide. His mother texted back a series of heart and wine glass emojis. Dean responded
“Touché.”
Hannah asks, indicating his bracelet.
How's everybody doing? We've got covid-19 in my state, to the point that we're under a state of emergency. It's hard to find that balance between being concerned and prepared and letting anxiety run wild. Y'all having that same issue? I'm playing a lot of FreeCell a distraction....
He doesn’t really expect her to judge him for having a husband but it’s nice when not even the smallest look of surprise crosses her face. “And how long have you two been married?”
While this fic is done, I'm not going anywhere. You can find me on twitter and tumblr...don't be a stranger! Thank you for being a part of the journey with me.
“Uh, sure. I’m Castiel.” Balthazar’s apartment is a mirror image of Cas’s, but it seems to have an extra bedroom. His furniture is black leather, modern lines accented by a sleek glass coffee table. The seating area is defined by a pristine white rug and Cas immediately knows the man doesn’t have a cat.
“Did you remember to thank it?”
Cas wonders if he’s the only man on the planet who doesn’t care about cars. Between this guy online and Dean, it seems like everyone’s favorite topic. Cas doesn’t own one, never has. He has his driver’s license but to be honest, learning how to drive is one of his least favorite memories. How in the world are you supposed to pilot a chunk of metal, glass, and flammable liquid at high speed all the while trusting that other people doing the same thing will stay in their lanes? He loves to walk when he can, and when he can't, public transportation is a complete blessing. He’s not sure why he feels defensive about the whole thing; no one is judging him one way or the other. Still, he imagines Dean pulling up alongside another guy in a fancy car, pictures Dean giving the other driver a little lift of his chin in acknowledgement while Cas looks on from above as his bus lumbers past.
“It was…” Dean sighed. “Cas, what are we doing?”
She smiles. “If you’d like your mother to come back with you, that’s perfectly fine.”
“Cas,” Meg tries, but that’s as far as she gets before she’s full-on laughing.
“So many directors mistake confusing their audiences for actual plot.”
She continues to meow.
That good feeling disappeared in the middle of lunch, when he heard a burst of familiar laughter coming from the back corner of the cafeteria. He looked over his shoulder and saw Dean, settling in at his regular table, a tray in his hands. He looked like he didn’t have a care in the world and Cas’s stomach knotted so violently that he thought he might have to spit out the bite of sandwich he was chewing.
Charlie tries again, but her smile looks a bit tentative. “Hello, sir, I’m Charlie.”
“That must have been extremely upsetting for you.”
“Does this mean you had another encounter with that handsome new neighbor?”
“I, uh, find myself in a bit of a pickle,” Dean says, and already that’s wrong.
Laying a hand on the small of his back, Balthazar guides him closer. As they approach the display Cas can see tiny pin pricks of color placed at random on each canvas. Hoping to gain some insight from the titles of the works, Cas moves a little closer, but each one seems to bear only the word “Untitled” plus a number.
And they’ve all worked out pretty well for you.”
Cas is beaming at the two of them. “So, how’s second gra--”
Cas leaned in and kissed the corner of his mouth. “You need to sleep.”
“Shut up, Novak,” Dean grumbled, working to regain purchase. He pulled his knee under him and pushed off from the bank to center his weight and climb to his feet, but with one leg straightened, his water-logged jeans clung to the muck and he toppled further down into the creek, landing on his knees. The water wasn’t deep, but the current was strong enough to keep him down, his face only inches from the surface. Cas watched as he struggled, his green eyes filled with panic.
“Maybe you can’t see it, but…”
“Okay, you two can wait right here and I’ll bring her back when we’re done.”
“I thought it ticked all our boxes. Great location, room and a yard for Henry, workshop for you.”
Cas knocks, then tries to arrange his features into something neutrally pleasant as he hears footsteps approach. He sees a shadow darken the peephole and a moment later, the door is flung open. A man stands there, dark blonde and handsome in a way Cas would describe as
“Never mind, I’ll tell him,”  Cas says, pulling the phone back and now Dean will never know if he would’ve whimpered “Pittsburgh” into the phone or not.  Dean writhes as Cas crooks his fingers again, as if passing along the message. “All right, mother, I have to go. We’ll see you soon.”
“And after this interaction, what do you imagine he thinks?”
He has no idea what his brother is going to say next, but he knows he doesn’t want to hear it. “Do not, Sam.” It comes out louder than he intends and he sees a few of the other people still enjoying their ice cream look over at him.
“I could eat. I really want to shower first, though.”
Sighing, he backspaces again and calls it a night.

“You gave it to me.”
, but every door he throws open leads to more emptiness. Frantically, he pulls open closets, even jerks open the built-in drawer under the window seat but there’s nothing. He can’t catch his breath, he can’t find his phone, he doesn’t know what to do and the thundering of his own heart is making it impossible to hear Henry’s thin cries. He runs from room to room, looking out windows to try and get a view of the yard from above and that’s when he sees it: a single light in the workshop.
Charlie turns her gaze heavenward in a silent supplication for strength. “Do you want me to pass him a note from you? So he can check the box for yes?”
“You never bloomed,” Dean finished, and they both laughed. “That must’ve been really hard, though.”
“I just...I don’t want you to regret this. I don’t want you to think you’re getting somebody you knew a long time ago and then you find yourself stuck with
“Ow,” Dean says, rubbing at his arm for effect. “When did you get so strong?”
Fun fact: My husband and I have those same words inscribed on our wedding bands.
“He said--and I quote--’your mom seems like someone who is used to having people do what she says.’”
all around town, though.” He slaps his hand against his chest at the word “mine” and the sound echoes through the tension filling the room. “Hey, tell enough people and maybe Alastair will come back and finish the job. Is that what you want?”
Once, when Chuck directs a question his way, he even puts the empty spoon into his mouth, clanging it against his teeth.
“You can hold me while I have it on.  In fact, it’s probably better if you do.”
This is where Cas would expect Charlie to catch Cas’s eye in a moment of solidarity. A look of
, a test he managed to fail. So, yeah, he messed that up
<<Yeah
“Ok, but. But you and Charlie…?”
“Cas, I’m scared.” His voice is barely above a whisper and there are those tears streaming down his face again even though he’s not crying. He buries his face in Cas’s shoulder and tries to remember what he knows is true. Cas is here. Dean’s safe and Cas loves him.
Dean lets Cas lead him back to the couch. “What we do is not ‘messed up’,” Cas says, complete with air quotes, and Dean feels something inside of him relax. This is his Cas, the one with the air quotes and the laugh so wide his nose crinkles, the one who clings to him in bed some nights like Dean’s the only thing holding him together. The cold, disdainful Cas he’d replaced him with in his absence begins to turn into so much mist in his brain. “We’re two consenting adults and so long as we’re both happy with what we’re doing, that’s all that matters. But if there’s something you don’t like, we need to talk about that.”
Cas gets him all the way inside his room and slams the door shut behind him. “That could change at any time.”
“The fucking worst,” Dean supplies.
Dean will never get used to those sorts of things coming out of Cas’s mouth, especially when he has his head tipped in that quizzical way like he’s considering what to have for lunch. “You’re a menace,” Dean tells him. “I have to go be with my family now.”
“I know, but I’m already up.”
Twenty minutes later they’ve pulled off the highway. Dean fills the tank while Cas opens the trunk and rummages through his bag. “We’ve got a ton of food, but I’ll grab us some drinks inside.”
He pulls out his phone and texts his sister.
“You are so beautiful,” Cas murmurs, wrapping his arms around Dean’s waist and pressing a kiss to his sternum.
“I won’t always know the right thing to say, but I’m here.”
Nothing that exciting. Unless embarrassing myself counts as a crime against humanity.
“Nah, that would’ve been worse, I think.”
“Dean.” Dean doesn’t answer, pretending to focus on adjusting the ice. “Dean, what’s going on?”
Cas tells himself he’s just looking out for his friend, but that doesn’t explain why he gets distracted for long moments watching Dean wash and dry his hands or why he should be better able to focus when he disappears into the back, but finds he feels strangely impatient.
His phone buzzes with a text. He checks to see who it’s from, unsurprised to see it’s Meg. Approximately 97% of his texts come from his best friend.
He’d watched his mother piece together two jobs and put herself through nursing school to keep a roof over their heads. Depending on her shifts, she’d reluctantly left him in charge of Sam in the evenings or early mornings, but he hadn’t minded. He felt good about being able to help the family. He’d offered to get a job himself, but Mary had refused, telling him he needed to focus on his school work. But he didn’t love school the way Sam did. Sam had a love of learning that Dean couldn’t comprehend. Whereas Dean did the bare minimum to get a passing grade, Sam could never stop himself from delving deeper, wanting more. Dean only spoke to his teachers when they asked him to stay after class; Sam went in early to ask them questions and inquire about additional readings.
“You need something for your head?”
Oh yeah well you sound like a goat with a cup of tea
“That’s amazing,” Jack says at the same time Rowena mutters, “Oh, so it’s
“So, I’m in the elevator and Dean comes into the lobby—”
Cas will be the first to admit that he’s not one for confrontation, but when he sees the way Dean’s father is glaring at him, looming over him in a not-so-subtle attempt to intimidate him, Cas has a moment of clarity: John Winchester is a bully. He’s a man who doesn’t care about right or wrong, he only cares about exerting control. Cas has dealt with his fair share of bullies over the years and while he doesn’t blame Dean one bit for falling into old patterns--the guy
” Cas raised an eyebrow. “You were afraid to touch it.”
“And you’re not hurt?”
Taking a deep breath, Dean fixes his gaze a little bit over Sam’s right shoulder. “I remember being in the garage and one of Dad’s friends…” Dean keeps playing with the language in his mind but none of the words feel right, especially not when he’s dumping the very concept on his brother for the first time. “Molested me.”
Dean wants to slam the door right in his face, but his eyes are so wide with concern, and they’re so fucking blue. Dean steps back to let him into the apartment, and prepares himself to have the bandaid ripped off of whatever hope he’s been carrying around inside.
“I knew you would.” he adds, leaning in for a kiss and Dean has to put a hand up to stop him.
sick. At the same time though, there’s something about the gesture that feels exactly right because he’s been going through some shit and this? This is a straightforward acknowledgement of that. It’s not whispered behind his back, it’s not done with an ambiguous
“I didn’t mi—” The answer is reflexive but Dean cuts himself off. “I know what my dad asked of me wasn’t right, but… I’m so proud of how well Sammy turned out.”
“That so?”
With the lunch recess approaching, people are streaming through the lobby and some of them are starting to stare. Sam tries to smile reassuringly, to give the impression that nothing is wrong, but out of the corner of his eye, Dean sees the police officer on security duty start to take a step towards them. Sam gives his head a little
He knows the drill by now. “Yeah. Rufus’s friend. From Sioux Falls. Name’s Dean.” They shake hands and Dean wonders how people stand living here when even the smallest bit of information is passed from person to person like a virus.
Cas pulls him close, hands loose and easy on Dean’s waist. “Pretty sure we took a vow that covers that.”
Sam gives Dean a bitch face, one tinged with smugness. “It’s easier for Eileen to read lips if she can sit facing you.”
Cas finished the apple, tossing the core in the compost bin by the raised gardens before pulling his bike up from where he’d left it on the lawn. By the time he arrived at the park, players and spectators had started to converge and it was busy enough that he had to walk his bike. He left it at the rack and wandered closer to the field. Dean’s team was warming up, the coach hitting balls to them. As he watched, Dean dove for a grounder, snagging it easily and jumping up to throw it directly to the first baseman’s waiting glove. He brushed some of the infield track dirt off his pants, then took his cap off to smooth his hair before putting it back on again. Cas smiled to himself and tried to remember to look at some of the other players as well. He made his way slowly around the field until he saw Hannah and Inaias standing behind the bleachers. Sam and Kevin came over, each with a bag of Swedish fish.
Cas considered that for a moment. “I think...we never know how good we have something until it’s over.”
Not like he can blame those women, whoever they are. Given a chance to spend some time in Dean Winchester’s bed, he’d be all over it. That self-awareness adds a tint of jealousy to his reaction to Dean’s return home and he finds himself even more irritated at the prospect of being an unwilling audience. Not enough to actually say or do anything about it, though. In those moments, he’s grateful that he can only make out a mere hint of voices. No way could he face Dean in the elevator if he was privy to all his bedroom talk. It’s just the bed, really. Maybe Cas could leave a can of WD-40 anonymously outside Dean’s door.
“I promised to love you through sickness and through health,” Cas says, voice steely. “Through good times and bad, and that’s what I intend to do.”
“It’s kind of personal,” Dean says.
“Goodness, Dean,” Cas says mildly,  “Do you kiss your Dom with that mouth?”
“Look, people do all sorts of jobs. They work hard and you know what they need when they aren’t working? A way to relax. Maybe that’s watching a movie or something. Maybe it’s reading a book.” He elbows Cas. “That’s all you, buddy.”
From hearing them chatter, it appears the flowers are for a friend who will be performing a jump rope routine in the talent show. Purchase in hand, they skip off happily to find their seats.
“Pittsburgh.”
Sam signs something quickly to Eileen and she nods. He turns to the waitress. “Let’s do one of the prosciutto and one calamari.”
“What did you think?” Balthazar asks as they step back onto the street, heading for a wine bar nearby that he recommends.
He nudges Cas’s hands with his feet in hopes of getting the massage re-started.
“Nah.” Dean leans back in his seat. “A free beer is a free beer.”
Cas stands and considers. “Tea sounds okay.” He takes a step toward the kitchen, but Dean hurries to his feet and waves him off.
“That’s great to hear,” Charlie says. “So you’ll be back?”
Dean grins and logs out. It’s no Victrola, but he does own an actual record player and this seems like a perfect time to pull out some vinyl. He sets the needle down carefully, reveling in the few seconds of crackling hiss before the opening notes of “Whole Lotta Love” begin to play. He sings along as he makes himself dinner, bringing his bowl of cereal back to the couch to eat.
“Was that good?  Did you like it?”  Cas asks and all Dean can do is nod and make an inarticulate pleased sound.
They sit around the table eating pancakes, Dean winking at Henry when he squirts a little extra whipped cream on his stack even after Sam gives him
.” Rowena coughed delicately at that.
“Oh my God,” Dean says. “If I find an Office Max catalog under the mattress….”
He lets go and Cas leaves his hands where they are. As much as he wants to touch, he would never deny Dean anything. Besides, he’s beautiful to watch as he lubes up his fingers, reaching to open himself up. Cas loves the way his lips part delicately, the way his breathing quickens, a flush spreading from his face down to his chest. He watches for as long as he can, fully intending to do what Dean says, but without even meaning to, he finds himself pleading. “Dean. Dean, please let me touch you.” Dean gives him the smallest of nods and Cas’s hands are on him in an instant, one hand gripping his hip while the other reaches to slip a finger, and then two, inside him.
Dean locks eyes with him for just a moment, but it’s enough to steel his resolve.
Ever since Benny came in with his ridiculous calendar on Monday, Dean was struck by the idea of setting up an official writing area for Cas, complete with a sign on Winchester & Son letterhead that says
Billie smiles. “It’s not easy. It takes practice and dedication but sometimes knowing your limits is the greatest sign of strength.” She gives him a moment for that to sink in. “And I know you hate the term self care, but treating yourself with gentle kindness—in whatever way that means to you—is giving that frightened child still inside you what he needs.”
“Can we get out of here?”
He thought he’d have to put on his best sheepish smile, but instead he finds himself swallowing hard as he heads toward her. “Hey.”
He shakes his head at her and oh shit that was a mistake. “I’m good.”
It’s not that he’s worried he offended her, not
The tea is the perfect temperature now and he takes a fortifying swallow. He starts writing and soon finds the words flowing. The words pour out of him, the bustle of the coffee shop fading into a background of perfect white noise as he loses himself in the story. He’s in the zone, entranced by that all-encompassing absorption that scratches the itch in his brain nothing else seems to reach. It’s why he writes. He’s engrossed to the point that he doesn’t realize anyone has approached the table until Balthazar snaps his fingers. “Earth to Castiel!”
“I told you, I hadn’t even seen him the first time I was there. It’s not like I’m being creepy. Besides--” Cas cuts himself off when their food arrives, then leans in afterwards. “I don’t even know if he’s into guys.”
“I tried, Cas. I don’t care what ‘they’ say, I need you to listen to what
She nods. “That’s an adrenaline response.”
Dean hands him his coffee. “Look, Cas, I’m a busy man.”
Dean shakes his head as he finishes getting dressed. No surprise that Sam’s a lawyer with his nose to the grindstone to make partner while Dean’s grinding coffee beans.
Naomi waved a wooden spoon at her husband. “Hey! Speak for yourself. I’m not nearly as old as you and I’m totally cool, right, Castiel?” Cas grabbed an apple from the bowl on the counter and took a big bite, gesturing to his full mouth as he headed toward the door. Naomi laughed, “Smart boy. Have fun!”
Cas takes a deep breath and tries to organize his thoughts before relating the conversation at the coffee shop.
you.”
Reaching across the counter, Charlie grabs his hand. “You never scrub up until we’re closed for the day.”
Dean tosses one arm around Rowena and the other around Jack. “But have you ever seen such attractive librarians?”
“Have fun. I’ll be here when it’s time to get dressed.”
Aw boo hoo did the liberal get his feelings hurt. Maybe pray to your lord and savior Rupaul.
Cas looks nearly panicked, searching Dean’s face with wide eyes.
It somehow feels like a trick question. “Yes?”
“Can’t help it if I’m the son she never had.”
“I don’t mean it like that.” Cas tried to put words to what he meant, tried to find a way to tell Dean that this was too important to him to treat lightly. But the alcohol and the panic now churning inside him kept the right words out of his grasp.
know is there’s no way Cas would get on that plane if he knew. Cas has been looking forward to this trip for what seems like forever, and Dean isn’t about to let an early heat stand in the way of his well-earned vacation. Right now it’s nothing more than a telltale prickle under his skin, but Dean knows it’s coming. It won’t be the same without his mate here, but he handled it on his own for years and years before he met Cas. He can go back to his old methods just this once.
