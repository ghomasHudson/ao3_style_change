“What if I could get your brain and your body off simultaneously?”
“DAMN it.” John had landed on his hip, hard.
“Very good, sir. Please just remain behind the rope.”
“Yes, alright, send it through,” Sherlock snapped, waving the young woman off.
“Mmmm.” Sherlock tipped his head back, presenting his lips, and John smiled, moving back in to kiss his mouth.
, and his mouth had fallen open.
“London,” John croaked, hating how his rusty voice cracked on the word.
into the DVD player. They were halfway through
“Ahem.” A very loud throat clearing sounded near Sherlock shoulder. They looked up to find John looming darkly over them.
Eventually the day came when the dragon looked at the Little Hobbit and noticed that he was growing pale and wan living underground. He realized that a creature of green, and sun should not live this way. Though it pained him, he made his decision.
“Oh God. I’m so sorry.” John winced. “I didn’t realize how stupid this would be when I asked if you wanted to work in my mum’s office this summer. You aren’t even getting paid. Look if you want to skive off, I can take over.”
“War is dangerous, soldier.” Kira clapped John on the back. “Surely you’re used to it by now? Sherlock, do you have time to meet with Shakaar before you go? We need to talk some details.”
“Oh, you just wait and see what I’m going to do to that cock. Your
After they’d shared thick slices of the cake around, and moaned about how good it was, Mrs. Watson declared it time for presents. Sherlock dashed back upstairs to find the things he’d gotten for John from inside his trunk. Suddenly feeling shy, he slipped the small box holding the bracelets into his pocket, and carried the bag of sweets downstairs.
John and Sherlock spent the rest of the day on the beach building sand castles and swimming in the crystalline waters.  Each cry of a gull, or rush of a wave felt like a keepsake to tuck away. They dined at a cozy table for two at a nearby Wizard taverna they’d discovered for dinner, dipping fresh bread into olive oil, and feeding each other bites from their plates.  When a photographer came by and snapped a picture of them, John paid the man, and accepted the print proudly. Sherlock’s hair was a mad riot in the humid air.
“I do a good bit of my own potion work at home, but I’m not set up for brewing anything sensitive there. Borrowing space here is a suitable alternative . . . we have an understanding.”
“I liked girls too, and that was  . . . so much easier. It was expected. I didn’t mean to  . . .”
Another twist to one of his sore nipples, and Mycroft exploded. His orgasm ripped through him, waves of sensation buffeting him about like a leaf before a tidal wave. Noises, someone keening, and then quiet as the tsunami finally receded leaving him utterly wrung out.
“Speaking of which, we’d best be quiet.” Sherlock held the door open for John.
“God, I wasn’t sure at all, but I tried.” Mike groaned. “I need at least a B on this.”
John looked adorably silly in the netted hat. For just a moment, Sherlock spared a thought at how ridiculous
“I wasn’t gorgeous. I was a mess.”
“Thanks you lot. It was a good day.”  John smiled on the walk back to Hogwarts.
“Ah, yes, the house elves.”  Alastaire nodded.  “Their bodies were cremated, but their heads were always saved as a memento.”
“No, definitely not.” John shook his head. “I’m swearing off relationships for awhile. Going to concentrate on my studies.”
“May I have this dance, sir?”
“Oh, no, it’s not. It’s been ages since I saw it, but I remembered I liked it. Very twisty. It’ll be right up your alley.”
John almost choked on his mouthful of tea.
John lowered his glass to see Olivia standing beside their table. She’d removed the flowers from her hair, and changed out of her pink dress into a long black tunic top and leggings.
“Premonition. Gut feeling, you know.” Sherlock waved a hand about.
“Well, you should have written that, then,” Sherlock said with a cheeky wink.
The long rutted roadway ran through a tunnel of tall grasses, finally breaking out into an open, bare field with a one-story farmhouse waiting ahead.
John smiled as he moved to examine the space. Pieces of driftwood, shells, and some pretty stones had been brought in and arranged in patterns on the floor. One set of stones clearly spelled “FUCK.”
“God, you smell good.” John nuzzled at Sherlock’s neck, kissing under his jaw.
Sherlock ground the heels of his hands into his eyes and leaned back from his desk. He’d been up most of the night surfing data streams. Falsifying reports, and covering his tracks hadn’t been too hard, but he wanted to be thorough. It was one thing to juggle records, but it was of course another to account for missing items. Sherlock knew his shell game wouldn’t last forever if people went out to physical warehouses and counted inventory, but if he could just keep them off his trail for awhile longer . . . He was startled when his phone rang. John’s alert sounded preternaturally loud in the quiet of the office.  He never called though. Sherlock whipped his mobile out and thumbed it on.
Harry had drawn herself up with some semblance of dignity to look down her nose at John. “Does Mum know you’re here?”
While the crops had flourished from the clouds hanging over Dakhur province, tempers flared with everyone cramped together indoors. A new influx of refugees had outstripped their current housing, and a shanty town of hastily-made shelters and tents appeared the field past the dorms almost overnight. When the first clear day dawned, people stirred gratefully, welcoming the sun, small cook fires, and lines of colorful laundry popping up like the first Honeybell flowers of spring.
He should have known that Sherlock would have no such hesitation.
“Ah well, no worries.” John tried to smile, feeling a bit like a git already.
“Christ, you’re a bunch of picky bastards. Cross Keys, then?” John offered.
“You’d be surprised.” John quirked a smile.
” John said. “He’d be in trouble for being with me.”
“Yes.” The fey creature glanced up as he slipped the phone back into his pocket. “I consult with the police when they are out of their depths which is quite often, but I also take on private cases on the side when things are slow.”
They stood pressed together at the door, waiting the minute for it to open one last time.
Sherlock allowed a smile to creep over his face as he glanced back up at her. “It is fantastic, it really is.”
“You played beautifully in there. That was .  . . amazing.”
“Well, that didn’t work out as planned.” John chuckled.
John continued to rummage inside the storage space, making an inventory. “Oh, look there’s a tent here, a lantern, firewood, sleeping bags.” He turned clutching a sealed bag labeled as
Sherlock surprised himself, eating more than he thought he could. The blinis wrapped around some sort of cheese filling were especially good.
. . .” Sherlock ground out.
“You’re right that was good,” Sherlock said, popping the tips of his fingers and thumb into his mouth to lick the last traces of ice cream and chocolate sauce away.
John slid his hand to Sherlock’s waist, giving a little squeeze. Sherlock jumped.
“I’m looking for Anne Williams,” he lied smoothly. “I was hired to find her for a sizable inheritance she’s slated to receive. I hope you can give me her contact information.”
“Oh, and do bring your lady. Sarah told me you’ve a special someone? We’d love to meet her.”
“It’s the 18th Century Goblin Rebellion,” Tom said.
“Can I do anything?”
“Just arrived in fact.”
“Yes, sir, sorry, sir. We weren’t informed you were coming.” The voice was much more accommodating this time.
This one was just a slip of a thing, a brunette with her hair in a ponytail lying on her back, somewhat protected by the low walls around her. She was stroking her little tits, pinching at the nipples, and begging the three men fapping their cocks around her to paint her with their cum. She writhed so prettily, bright red nails stroking over herself, it was mesmerizing. A number of gawkers had gathered just to watch the show.
“Maybe there’s something in the games room? We could poke around and find things we like there.” John shrugged. “It might lead to something.”
“So, Holmes’ Fine Honey was born.”
?” Sherlock felt his voice rising.
of what might come to be,
“Oh that.” Molly waved a hand carelessly. “Just something I got roped into. I prefer time spent with the college crowd to be honest. Speaking of Irene, how are you enjoying her company? She seems pleased with you.”
to Bajor.”
The heat clicked on as Sherlock glanced over to find the woman staring open-mouthed at them, her hairpin lost somewhere in the car’s interior. Realizing the loss, she looked down and cursed.
“We’ll have to share. They were mad expensive,” John whispered.
Sherlock's infertile Beta brother had already gifted them with a small ocean of baby things in preparation for their expanding family. The flat was filled with all sorts of new furniture, pastel fripperies, and a baffling array of high-tech equipment that John wasn’t sure how half of it worked, and he was a doctor, forgodsake. Mycroft tried to play the cool and collected government official, but he was quite undone over his two nieces, and they hadn’t even arrived yet.
“He won’t stay long,” Sherlock said. “He never does.”
“Look, John I need to tell you, this was an aberration. I never do this. I don’t want you to think . . .”
John snugged down happily against him. He smeared kisses along Sherlock’s jaw, mouthing down his throat as the man gradually reassembled. John worked his way slowly back up, and Sherlock turned in his arms to catch his mouth, welcoming him in for another round of deep, languid snogging, tongues tangling lazily together. John’s heavy cock pressed invitingly against Sherlock’s warm belly, and he rocked a few times, enjoying the tease of it.
“Alright.” John didn’t look happy, but he allowed Sherlock to crawl into his lap, hugging him tightly, bending to kiss him until they both forgot what they’d even been talking about.
“Yeah, okay, I hope so.” John tried to smile.
“I was busy on a case,” Sherlock bristled. “Besides, he has no right to check up on me. I am an adult. I’m perfectly capable . . .”
“John? What are you doing here?” Sherlock looked exhausted, his hair unruly as if he’d been tugging at his curls, but he was long and lithe and gorgeous all the same. John wanted to devour him in great heaping bites.
to the waiter. John sighed and asked Sherlock to please get him a steak and chips or the closest equivalent.
Sherlock spent a week plodding through his regular duties. He clocked in and out of patrol, scanning the ID chip attached to his uniform, working mechanically through his watch. It was only the beggars they occasionally had to roust that punched through his fog. He made sure the Bajorans weren’t hurt as they sent them on their way, slipping them a few folded bills if his fellows Cardassians weren’t watching. He ate his unimaginative meals in the mess, sitting near his squad mates, grunting if addressed, keeping quiet if not. It was after hours, when a skeleton staff remained on alert, that he came to life and his real work began.
"Promise me you'll visit soon," John said. The bed shook, trembling slightly as the suitcase shifted restlessly underneath. "Ha." John huffed out. "See, even the luggage wants you to come."
Sherlock’s long legs had already carried him to the car parked down the street when John finally caught up with him. He was tucked into the passenger seat of the Vauxhall, head down.
She looked smart. Irene could tell these things instantly. It was harder on the intelligent ones, dealing with the laws the NeoConservatives had passed since coming to power. They'd eliminated higher education for girls, put restrictions in the workplace. Oh, there were still a few employment options left for women outside the home, domestic staff, childcare, and the like, but for those needing more money than the pittance these brought, there were few options.
Things weren’t perfect. John had two papers due on Monday, and an exam next week, and he was sure he would get a river a crap from the team at next practice over the naff photo, but yeah, he squeezed his boyfriend’s hand and decided things were rather good. John released Sherlock’s hand and scooped up a huge bite of creamed chicken.
John crowded round as Sherlock scrabbled at it, finding a small indentation that allowed him to pull it open. The electronic display they uncovered lit up the shed with an otherworldly green light. Sherlock’s grin split his face in the eerie glow. “John, we found it,” he breathed.
“You’ve got an Aston Martin?” John whistled, impressed.
Sherlock pushed through the door to the sound of bells chiming pleasantly. He held it open for John to follow.
“No, I just . . . I haven’t been writing home much lately.”
“Dunno, I guess the old bat wants to save money. Lord knows she won’t pass the savings on to her staff.” Donna said with a sneer.
“I don’t know.” Sherlock tilted his head, his eyes twinkling. “You’ve got the height for it.”
John held the manila envelope up for inspection, flipping it over to view both sides. There were no identifying marks that he could see. It felt light in his fingers, just the ordinary sort of thing you might use to send an inter-office memo. He shrugged.
“Nope, no, I’m not asking . . .” John felt a wash of horror flood over him. “Sorry, nothing like that.”
“How well do you swim?” John asked Olivia.
“Course I don’t want that.” John had drawn closer, so close he could feel the heat of John's body as he slid in between Sherlock’s knees.
The gloomy weather of the next month matched his hollow mood, raining almost continuously day and night. Sherlock showed up on time to teach his classes, ate when John sat with him and urged him to finish his plate, and started Naavi on some basic security on the console in the farmhouse. The younger man had been thrilled at the offer of more challenging work duties, and his enthusiasm had been a spot of bright in some otherwise very dull days.
“I know you didn’t know her very well, but I thought you might like to know.”
“I have plans to take you in every room in this house,” Sherlock growled, but he did move back enough to allow John to close the door.
just had a new grandchild born.” He tipped his chin toward a plump woman dressed in winter white.
“Yeah, hello this is John Watson. I’ve called before about the double bed in 221 at Baker Hall? There are two of us in the room. We NEED two beds.”
“Claudette, I didn’t know you were in England,” Sherlock exclaimed turning toward the young woman.
“Not so big now, hmm, Posh Boy?” John teased, licking and nipping his way to just below his ear. “God I want you,” John growled, “Want to take you apart, want you naked spread out in my bed, want to fuck you so good . . .”
“No, no I’m certain I said we needed the blue cover on these ones. Hurry up and finish, and you can run and fetch me a coffee when you’re done. Two sugars.  There’s a good lad.” The man had the audacity to wink at him,
Sherlock peered into the bag of sandwiches and pulled out the Orangina inside.
“Oh, alright. You can have ONE piece.” Sherlock selected a small sliver of soft brie and held it out to his puppy. John gratefully licked every trace from Sherlock’s fingers with his warm, soft tongue, and sighed.
“You’re on.”
“Ah, that’s lovely.” John touched Sherlock’s arm as he nodded toward the lights.
“Problem with the florist.”
It was all John could do to sit through the rest of dinner, listening as Harry complained about a customer at work, remembering to eat his dessert as he watched Sherlock nearly fellating his spoonfuls of cake and cream, wrapping his tongue around the base of the spoon to lick it clean.
“Oh, GOD,” Sherlock cried, his head thrashing on the bedding beneath him.
“Unfair advantage.” Sherlock sniffed.
“Ooh, which one?” Sherlock reached down to rip open John’s pyjama top, sending the buttons pinging around the room. John huffed out an angry noise, but did nothing to stop him.
“You never.” Sadiq looked shocked.
“That’s right.” The man winked, extending a hand. “I cannae hide it. Independent war photographer, and man-to-know, John Watson.”
“I actually found a bit of honey.” John held up the small jar, smiling as if proud to be a decent host. “I know you like it in your tea.”
“I did, actually.” Clara warmed quickly to the topic. “Just the stuff you get at the gardening store though, nothing special.”
“Oh, you were so good. I still think of that concert your mother made you give. You were fantastic.”
“I’ve got something that might help you, upstairs,” Sherlock said. “You look  . . . wet,” he finished charitably. John looked like a drowned rodent, his slicked hair plastered to his skull. He looked cold.
“Alright,” Sherlock said finally pulling back. He let a hand slip down to give John’s bum a healthy squeeze before releasing him.  “I’ll see you tonight.”
“Yes, of course.”
“Alright, we can talk details tomorrow. It’s close to dawn. You need more sleep.”
John demonstrated pointing his wand toward himself.  He felt a shimmer as the spell slid over him. “There, chuck, something at me.”
“What the hell?” John muttered behind him.
“Victor?” John frowned. “And why is that?”
“It has come to me to inform you that Gul Ulric Holmes was killed last night during a routine transport trip between Cardassia and the moon on Bartok 9.”
Sherlock used the toilet grateful for the moment’s quiet. He washed his hands when he was done, and splashed cool water over his hot face. He avoided looking at himself in the mirror as he grabbed a towel off the rack and mopped himself up. Sherlock took a breath as he opened the door, and paused. He could hear Irene’s voice in the hall.
John glanced at Victoire and she nodded. The two of them had been playing Beaters together going on their third year now. Like a well-oiled machine, they took off at top speed together, narrowing in on the bludger that dogged  Alastaire Holmes.
“No, Anne, it’s okay. I’m tired of hiding. I knew this day would come. Now I don’t have to worry anymore.” Kerry looked up, bravely wiping her face.
“We all need to do our part. If you’re not for the Resistance, you’re for the Cardassians,” Kira stared them all down in turn. “Do you want to work for the Cardassians?”
“No . . .” Sherlock shook his head trying to process the shock. “Was it  . . .”
“Mmm, yes. Delicious.”
John removed the final piece — Butterflies in the Stomach — with a flourish. “Ta da! I knew all those years of med school would be good for something one day.”
“So, how’s the new job going?” Sherlock asked Victor when he’d run down.
Sherlock HAD come to the study session in the library the night before, breezing in to spout off all he knew about rearrangement reactions and the Hoffman elimination. Irene had gotten so frustrated, she’d thrown her textbook across the table at the wall. After calling them all idiots minutes before, Sherlock had turned instantly contrite, telling Irene she simply wasn’t approaching the material in the right way. He started again, slower, explaining things differently until everyone was nodding.
The driver let them off at the front steps where security officers scanned them before a servant escorted them indoors. The building was two stories, covered in a warm-colored stucco in the Bajoran style outside, but once they’d entered, the heavy furniture, potted plants, and dark wall-hangings were instantly Cardassia.
“I know, it’s not exactly the space port, is it?” John smiled just before he stepped into Sherlock’s orbit, tugging him down to seal their mouths together.
“Well, of course, we were glad to.” Mrs. Watson flashed a smile back. “It was horrible last night. Just horrible. How is your mother, is she . . .”
“Well, I’m holding you to that, now.”
Sherlock turned to avoid the worst of it, sniggering. John would have splashed him again, but he realized the mum with the magazine was fanning her now-damp reading material and giving them a dirty look.
“You as well,” Sherlock managed before cutting the connection.
John recognized the two women who soon joined them from class. They introduced themselves as Anne and Gwen. He had to hide a smile behind his fist as he watched how visibly Irene preened at welcoming them. Anne was short with dark hair and a baggy animal-print jacket, but Gwen was a pretty thing, tall and thin with her crinkly blonde hair back in a braid. Irene frowned when John laughed at something Gwen said and touched her arm.
“What?” the dwarves exclaimed rounding on the Little Hobbit. “You’ve known all this time and said nothing?”
“What?”
“Now, the back door?”
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed. “you can.”
Sherlock watched, aghast, as some young slip of an
“Yeah, we best cool it a bit though.” John stepped back.
“Thank you.” Sherlock felt something warm and unexpected glowing under his breastbone.
“Well, Anthea helped of course.” Greg looked a bit chagrined.
Sherlock stopped, embarrassed as Lupaza crowded in to watch.
“Yeah, I agree!” John laughed and clinked glasses with her.
John found his attention soon wandering though. Recent advance in antiviral medication began to pale next to the sight of the long, rambly man curled over his laptop nearby, one knee hugged to his chest. Christ, those legs were simply never-ending. The cool computer light washed over his profile, highlighting those gorgeous cheekbones in exquisite detail as he peered at his screen.
“No, no, it’s fine.” John waved her off. He smiled and took a sip from his glass of wine.
“Yes, I suppose I can,” John said, feeling in a bit of a daze.
“You are?” John’s beautiful eyes widened in surprise.
“I’ll have the locks changed soon.”
He clicked off the telly, and moved to take a shower and begin his own preparations.
“I’m sorry,” Sherlock said in a rush. “I didn’t mean to worry you. It was dark, I know we should have waited like you said, I just . . .”
A cloud passed over the sun, and John shivered.
“I vote they should stay,” Naavi said solemnly, looking pleased at being asked.
John greeted the rest of them. Teddy slapped him on the back, looking good in his Aurors’ black, and Owen introduced a pretty, shy-looking woman with long dark hair beside him as Rhea.  “She moved here recently from France.” Owen informed everyone proudly as if he’d had something to do with it. Sherlock greeted her in her native tongue, and soon the two of them were nattering away in French, her shyness falling away.
“Yeah, okay.”
“Thank you so much,” John said.
Sherlock glanced over and watched as his date for the evening, Irene Adler, did roll her eyes. He had to stifle a laugh. The band started into a rousing tune that Sherlock recognized, and he stood, holding a hand out to Irene. “May I have this dance?”
“God, Sherlock, I’m sorry. I didn’t think . . . it’s been awhile.” John drew in a ragged breath, still trying to get his bearings.
“Nearly a week,” John said dully.
“Yeah, okay, fine,” John huffed, resigned.
They reached the right place soon enough, a spot where the river widened and slowed, caught between wide flat rocks. A rope swing hung overhead from a sturdy tree branch over the deeper water. Sherlock had but a moment to admire the idyllic view before a more-compelling sight caught his eye, that of John stripping away his clothes.
“Yeah, can you imagine?” Harry turned to watch as a mother conjured a stream of water to quench a small child who had burst into flames. The woman twisted to scold a taller boy nearby. “
Sherlock hummed and leaned back against him. “I won’t be a minute.”
“American telly show. I saw it when I was kid.” John smiled. “It had this bloke who could make weapons and things out of stuff lying about, bottles, gum wrappers, light bulbs . . .” he trailed off as Sherlock stared at him. “Ah, it doesn’t matter. What do we need to do?”
“Hmm. It’s not half bad,” Sherlock said, working through his plate with small, careful bites.
“Damn right.” John sounded angry, though the kisses he dropped over Sherlock’s face were achingly tender. It felt like drops of water falling, like warm spring rain thawing the frozen ground after winter. With a cry, Sherlock cracked open. He hauled John’s mouth to his own, and kissed him hard, every fiber of being crying,
“Ah, John, good evening.” Mycroft crooned as if this were a completely usual turn of affairs.
“So I’ve heard,” Kai Opaka said thoughtfully. “Sherlock, I know I don’t need to tell you. These are dark times for Bajor. We are reaching a tipping point where things can go either way toward the light.” She held a palm open near a large candle on a stand, “Or toward the dark.” She unfurled the other toward the shadows of the room.
“Yeah, that sounds like a good idea,” John said. “What about you, do you need the loo?”
“Is that it? Are we free to go?” Sherlock asked the officer.
"Why?"
John spat into his hand, grinning and wrapped it around them both.
John sighed with relief, lowering the board to see the perfectly centred dart. “I never should have doubted you.”
“What?” Sherlock raised an annoyed eyebrow.
His hands mapped Sherlock’s back feverishly, running over whatever he could reach
“Oh, love, I’m sorry about earlier, you know I am . . .”
“Yes.” Sherlock flushed a bit. “I’m sorry. I have enjoyed our conversation, but I needed to be seen talking to someone to blend in.”
“OH, sweetie. I didn’t think you two would be back until tomorrow.” June Watson came down the stairs tying her old dressing gown, her hair up in some rag curlers. John felt something loosen and let go at just the familiar sight of her.
“What about your lab?” John flopped into a chair. “You’re a scientist. That’s part of who you are.”
“Johnny!” Harry cried, dropping her bag to the floor. She grinned ear to ear as John rose to give her a hug.
John took the stairs down to the beach. A number of holiday-makers were still out, enjoying the views, snapping pictures, playing in the water. John walked along the shore, letting the wind blow against him until it started getting dark, and he had to make his way back home.
“He’s been working with New Scotland Yard. There’s a bloke he checks in with . . . Graham Lestrade or something?” Victor shrugged. “Why don’t you go see him?”
“Ah.” John was surprised. He was certain the striking man was going to name some bar or flashy nightclub as his answer.
“Good, then. Neither wild horses nor scary brothers can drag me away.”
Only a few minutes late, the Gryffindors filed down from the dorms to join the rest of the graduating class. As one, they moved to take their seats before the large stage that had been assembled once more before the lake. John had a dizzying sense of déjà vu as he looked around at the risers of spectators gathered, and the colourful flags hanging above the stage. Had it really been a full year since he’d sat here watching Sherlock graduate? A lump formed in John’s throat and he had to swallow several times to clear it.  Harry and his mum, her belly just starting to round were sat somewhere on the rows of benches watching.
“Congratulations, John.” Both their heads snapped up as Mycroft appeared again from out of the crowd.
“With any luck, she’ll actually follow through, and some real good will come of it.” Sherlock reached for his glass.
“Boring.” Sherlock waved it aside.
“You’re right.” Sherlock nodded. “I do have plans.”
John sneaked glances at the others sat around the table, and tried to pick the right spoon from the display of cutlery next to his plate.  The dining room was a huge, drafty place, and the Holmes-Blackwell family and their guests only took up only a small portion of the long table that lay in the center of it. John tried smiling at the blonde girl sat across from him, but she merely ignored him to spoon up her soup.
John startled, turning to see that a strange man had slipped into the chair beside him. The low light in the tent had left him half in shadow and all John could truly make out was a very patrician profile.
John felt something sinking through him like a lump of lead falling through wet paper. He swallowed deeply, and tried for a smile. “Yeh, it’s a rotten thing.” John shot a look at Sherlock, but Sherlock was busy fixing a strap over his shoulder. “I expect we’ll manage somehow though.”
“Ugh. I don’t want to bother with
.” Anderson frowned as he leaned in to peer more closely at Sherlock.
“Aaah, you liven up the place.” Victor busied himself transferring fried potatoes onto a plate. “Coffee’s ready if you want some.”
“No, don’t get frustrated. It’s a puzzle that can be solved like any other.” Sherlock raised an eloquent eyebrow. “You just need to take logical steps to get there.”
“Can you start home tomorrow?”
“No doubt. So, is there anything else you needed?” The man’s sharp, clear vowels could have cut glass.
John laughed as he settled his bag over his shoulder. “You git,” he said fondly, reaching out to pat Sherlock’s hip.  “I was still going out with Maria at the time. It wasn’t really a date.”
“Good afternoon, my name is Reginald. Is there something I can help you with?”
John still had his necklace on, the pendant slipped to the side. Sherlock threaded his fingers around the cord to pull it back around to the front. “You kept it.”
“Holmes, you’re needed.”
“Where’s Sherlock, then?” Some part of John had hoped to simply ignore Victor until he went away, but it was difficult to pretend a gorgeous, over six-feet tall, muscled man in a white tee shirt, old jeans, and a ruffled apron wasn’t cooking breakfast in the kitchen.
Sherlock stopped in his tracks. “John, why are we walking? Take my arm.”
"Garden. I need to see something outside," Sherlock informed the guard as he marched past.
“I did. Open the box, Sherlock.” Mycroft smiled slightly and nudged it closer toward him.
“Wait, let’s be sure.” He turned to scrabble at the ground, finding a few clods of dirt that he tossed at the fence. Nothing.  “Come on.” Sherlock’s voice fairly crackled.
John chuckled. “God, I love you, sweet.” He put a hand down to splay over Sherlock’s extravagant stomach. “Love them too. God, they aren’t even here yet, and I love them.”
“Of course, love.” John took his hand, tugging him back to the warm, yellow kitchen, and whatever smelled so good on the hob.
“What does one
A lazy bee buzzed over their heads as they crested the small hill, and John got his first good look at the property.  The gardens swept down to a beautiful two-story whitewashed home, the sort you’d see on a picture postcard surrounded by the appropriate flowers and rolling vineyards beyond.
“Yes, no . . . I’ll let you know.”
“Oh, look. The glass is all cracked.” John sighed.
“It is,” Sherlock agreed, raising his mug for a careful sip.
“Yeah, it was hard, that dinner at your parents’.”
Sherlock had plenty of time to store his gifts in his trunk before John and his mum returned home. They bustled in with Indian takeaway, and a burst of fresh air. Sherlock accepted a hug from John, and moved to help him pull down plates and silverware to set the table. He had thought to tell him about the happy accident of stumbling on the Wizard shop that afternoon, but John was full of talk about the office, and a funny story that Donna had told him. Sherlock found himself mumbling, “I just browsed some shops.” when John finally asked how his day went.  They ate dinner in the kitchen, moving to the living room to watch a show on the telly with Mrs. Watson afterwards.
“Oh, here, let me.” John stood to help her shift it onto the shelf.
Dr. Callum showed up sometime later with his wife, Anika, an East Asian woman with silver in her hair. John shook hands all around, and proudly introduced Sherlock. The night became a whirl after that of meeting people, and trying to remember faces and names.
His alarm bleeped somewhere rudely nearby. John moved to shut it off when he realized he couldn’t move with the dead weight pressing him into the mattress. He glanced down to an inky riot of curls spread against his chest.
“Nuuumbeeer?” Sherlock drawled near his ear.
‘Please, sir if you’re going to eat me, do it and make it fast.’ The Little Hobbit screwed his eyes shut tight, bracing himself.
“Yes. If I allowed myself to remember everything, my Mind Palace would become horribly cluttered. So, I periodically tidy up and put the rubbish in the bin. And then, every so often, I haul the bin out to the skip, and it’s gone for good.”
Teddy snapped back to normal in a flash. "Sorry," he mumbled, and sheepishly shoveled up a forkful of beans.
“Hey. My mum paid half-price for this I’ll have you know.”
John had reassembled himself to something appearing normal when he breezed back into the room, wearing flannel pj bottoms and an old tee.
“Probably me.” Gwen laughed. “Irene is rubbish in the kitchen.”
John sank to one of the desk chairs, huffing out a laugh. To think he’d been hoping for a smooth move in . . . a reasonable roommate, something close to the loo, but far enough from the elevator that they wouldn’t get all the noise. This was shaping up to be anything but easy.
On their walk home, Sherlock reached into his pocket and pulled out a cigarette on auto pilot, lighting it with a muttered spell. He took a drag, exhaling the smoke with a sigh. It was only when he glanced over at John that he remembered himself, and froze.
“Hmm.”
“How do you know all that? I never said,” John gaped. He was so surprised he forgot to play the doting boyfriend.
A photo of the area taken just a few hours before filled the screen. Sherlock zoomed in to what looked like a barren field under their cloaking device . . . and massing around it on the road sat at least twenty large scale vehicles, and a swarm of Imperial soldiers in full battle gear setting up what looked like particle canons.
“Damnit. John, I didn’t know. They shipped me offworld, back to Cardassia Prime.”
“I haven’t even told you what it is.”
It was after dark by the time John returned to the dorm room. He was annoyed to see that the folding bed that Residential Services had promised still hadn’t made an appearance. Sherlock was nowhere to be seen either, and John spent a few quiet minutes on his laptop wondering if he might show before packing it in for bed. There was nothing for it. John changed into pyjama bottoms and an old tee, flipping back the duvet, to settle in for sleep, being careful to stay as close to the edge as possible.
“How do you know he’s not a pirate?” John stuck out his chin.
“Okay.”
"Tell me that we're going to have nothing but the truth between us now. No more secrets, okay?”
Pauses came as his sore flesh was caressed, and a tongue moved to trace over the newly forming welts. His nipples were grasped and cruely twisted. Mycroft floated somewhere above his body reveling in pain that became pleasure that became pain again. A heady cocktail of chemicals flowed into his veins and he writhed at the intensity of it.
Sherlock's birthday party doesn't end as he'd expected at all, and the boys must rise to the many challenges thrown their way.
A player named Javier Hernández was traded to the Manchester United Football team in 2010, but the talk about the Tories wanting to water down a law restricting pesticide use in the UK is absolutely a modern-day news event.
“Soooo . . .  Victor Trevor.” John leaned in slightly across the table. “You told me you’d made him up out of whole cloth. He really exists?”
“No, it was very generous of you to increase your gifts to St. Mungo’s.  Oh, how impolite of me, I’m Penelope Murthwaite.” She nodded, introducing herself to rest of the group. “I chair the Board of Trustees at St. Mungo’s, and we were SO thrilled when Mr. Holmes decided to double his donations to the hospital this year.” She swung back to address Mycroft. “I couldn’t help noticing, Mr. Holmes, that you’d specifically involved yourself with choosing a recipient for the training program scholarships several times now. I simply wondered if you might like to become a member of the scholarship committee on a more permanent basis?” She waited, eyebrows raised expectantly.
A burst of laughter at that.
Colour had risen over Dom’s face. “We were just talking,” he mumbled saved from adding anything more as they reached the heavy doors. The group whooped at finally escaping the dark halls for the honeyed sunshine outside.
“Right, I’m only saying this once. I have no plans to leave. Not unless Sherlock asks me to go.” John lifted his cup to drain the last of it. “Even then, I’d probably get on my knees to ask him to reconsider.”
Sherlock rolled off his bed and crossed the room, sticking his fag between his lips to throw open the window with both hands. It wasn’t that he’d forgotten that it was Christmas exactly, it was just that with no one to celebrate with,  the day hadn’t held any particular significance.
The man, Shakaar seemed more welcoming. A small smile creased his handsome face as he extended his hand. “Sherlock, how do you do?”
“Okay, where do we start?”
“Perhaps we do need a word,” Sherlock said softly. “A safeword.”
“Alright,” Sherlock took a deep breath, “but only if you’ll be my insightful, kind, fabulously fit, beautiful-voiced, intelligent boyfriend.”
All sensation stopped as the warmth left his side. John couldn’t help the sigh of frustration. It was a bit maddening not being able to see anything. He pulled at the ropes on his wrists.
The man lifted a jar of his spring clover honey to the sun, admiring the way the amber liquid caught the light, then tipped it to the side to check the bottom. Oh, he was looking for a price tag.
Victor spent several minutes explaining the thrills and spills of surfing as John nodded encouragingly.
“I’m a light sleeper.” Sherlock rolled his eyes. “I doubt I’d sleep through you having a nightmare. You’re quite vocal.”
“Bugger this music,” John said as it cranked up even louder behind them. “Hey, are you hungry?” he near shouted.  “Let’s get out of here. You owe me a dinner.”
“I fucking love you. You know that, don’t you?” he rasped.
“Christ, Sherlock, I’ve hurt you.” The pain in John’s voice just made the wet come faster.
Sherlock had gone back to the bar for another round of drinks when a familiar voice called out.
“Who’s my kitty, who’s my good kitty?” John growled in Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock was able to find caches of field supplies, food, and even some ground transport vehicles that he had shipped to another warehouse that John gave him as a site the Resistance had easy access to. They’d agreed that it was best if John didn’t tell anyone else about him, and just “happened” upon the things that Sherlock was setting aside as happy windfalls.
“Letter?” he said imperiously, holding out his hand.
“Oh, John. Good luck with your mother’s wedding,” Victoire said, leaning over to pat his knee.
Sherlock shut his eyes for a moment, gathering himself, trying not to shake visibly.
“No. It’s meant to demoralize us, break our will,” John said glumly.
“I suppose so. I’ve nothing better on.” Sherlock shrugged his shoulders back a few times to loosen them after so long hunched over his work.
Despite Sherlock’s reassurances, and even the fancy new jumper, John still felt something like a small, squat garden gnome next to the tall, elegant poshness beside him. They joined the group queuing out to the platform.
“Poor thing. You do look a bit peaky,” Irene agreed. “Here, this is just the thing.” She pulled another pink page out of her bag and thrust it at John.
John sauntered into organic chem with a little spring in his step. It was amazing what a little consistent rest could do for your disposition.
We welcome your kind comments and kudos. 😊❤️😊
Sherlock’s hand was on him now, moving slowly and steadily, and John closed his eyes and relaxed into it, breath quickening. Three times Sherlock had him trembling at the edge, and three times he had backed away—thankfully not with a blast of sharp, cold air, but with a loss of contact that left John wanting. With each renewed climb upward, he seemed to surge just a little higher, relax just a little deeper, so that each return back to “normal” brought more and more pleasure. He was expecting yet another rise and sharp drop when Sherlock leaned in to kiss him. Sherlock grinned and whispered, “I will. In ten seconds, I will stop entirely. So you will have to get there before I reach ten. One… two…” John’s mind was racing. He was so very ready for this, and his body rocked forward with each increasing number until he found he was so far past ready that he was actually holding himself back at nine, waiting for that deep, rich voice to reach ten. When he did, John came hard and fast, rushing over Sherlock’s hand. The hand that was... still moving. “Twice more, John.”
“I understand.” John nodded, feeling a familiar dark hole opening up in his own chest. “Listen, there’s a family therapist office I think would be really helpful for you and your parents. I’m going to suggest that to your mum. I won’t tell her anything we discussed, but I think you really need to talk to her. Maybe a controlled, safe space will help. What do you think?”
“You’re on,” Owen said, slapping him on the back.
John caught Sherlock staring at him with narrowed eyes, understandably confused about their sudden excursion and now John smiling like a loon. John shrugged and entwined their fingers and giving Sherlock’s hand a gentle squeeze.
Sherlock shifted carefully on the outcropping of rock that he’d fallen on, only a few meters down the side of the cliff. He ran down a mental checklist on himself, stretching each limb carefully.
“So, was he quite fit? Did you fancy him?”
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDdRHWHzwR4
John licks his own thin, chapped lips.
A small knot of teenagers happened by, laughing, and giggling. One of the boys palmed the rear end of the girl ahead of him, and she turned to slap him, the moment halted when they spied Sherlock and John nearby.
Finding himself bound in a chair with no memory of how he got there is NOT how Mycroft envisioned his day beginning.
Johns resolve crumbled, he wanted to share it, but this moment was too perfect to ruin, he stumbled over his words as he replied, “I.. I'm just not ready to talk about it. Please. Can you trust me?”
“Where is your home?” Sherlock asked the younger woman in Bajoran. It shocked her so much, she answered him immediately.
“Name’s Connor,” his new friend said, extending a hand.
“Something like that.” Sherlock moved to the table to set plates and silverware down. “And you’re an army doctor just back from Afghanistan.”
A pall hung over them thick as fog as the day continued, despite the aggressively cheerful weather outside. Sherlock couldn’t shake the pain that had gathered inside his chest, and John kept a hard silence, answering questions in clipped monosyllables if at all. Naavi lay back down to rest as the other three spent the afternoon clearing out the barn. There were rotted sacks of feed to clear out, the cattle intended for them long gone. Sherlock and Lupaza hauled them outside into a midden pit while John swept behind. It kept them too busy to think for awhile. Lupaza insisted they eat something for dinner, and they forced themselves to comply, not wanting to waste the replicated supplies, though no one had much heart for it.
“Me too, John. Do you think you can sleep now?” Sherlock asked.
He couldn’t help thinking about the angry, wrapped-in-himself man who’d first arrived here, caring for nothing but escape. It seemed light years away from when he had laid eyes on John Watson and thought only of how to trick his way past the man. What a fool he’d been.
Somehow Sherlock continued his investigation even though images of John making love to large silicon toys just down the hall plagued his mind. He was able to interview the last Alpha in his dressing room, a disarmingly pretty man named Steven. Although he played hard and loose with the truth, Sherlock tripped him up and finally got the information he was looking for.  Sherlock left Steven weeping in his make-up chair as he swept into the corridor, confident that he’d have a full report for Angela in the morning. He spied the Beta named Gary again, and stopped him, asking after John. The man informed him that the Omega had already finished for the day and gone home.
They neared a branching road that veered sharply upward, and Lupaza turned onto it, punching the accelerator. The engine whined, straining at the steep hill, but Lupaza merely frowned, gripping the steering bar tighter. After several tense minutes, they reached the crest of the slope and leveled off. Sherlock realized he’d had his shoulders up near his ears, and tried to relax the cords of his neck.
“I’m getting the vibrator.”
“Oh, Sweetheart. He sounds like an utter wanker.” John reached out to spread his hand over Sherlock’s heart.
“God, there it is.”
“Sherlock around?” Victor asked, looking about.
Sherlock felt his cheeks redden slightly. “Alright.” Sherlock pretended to sigh. “I’m a freelance journalist. I was hoping I could score a story here that might help me land a full-time position with a big paper.”
"You're not taking this seriously," John says, rolling over before flattening himself out on the bed next to Sherlock. He unties the knot and starts a new one. Sherlock watches John's fingers intently as he connects the two cords with a double-surgeon's knot.
On a warm night it might have been too much, but the extra heat just felt nice and John aimed a pat at Sherlock’s arm before slipping all the way into slumber.
The panting turned to moaning, Sherlock’s hands clenching and unclenching on the arms of the chair. The sight drove John wild. He increased the speed of his thrusts, fucking through Sherlock’s feet until he came with a shout.
“Oh, John,” Sherlock breathed.
“You’ll need to wear these if you want to get in close.” Sherlock passed John a netted hat and a pair of heavy canvas gloves.
“So, what’s your story?” The Bajoran woman leered at him on their second trip outside. “I can’t recall ever having one of your kind worried about our kind.”
Deciding he had no chance of escape, the Little Hobbit bravely stood to accept his fate. Instantly the dragon dove out and pounced, caging him between outstretched talons that pinned him to the ground.
“Oh, you’ve lovely hair,” John said. “I knew it would feel nice the moment I saw it, so thick.”
“You can’t keep saying things like that,” Sherlock said, rubbing sleep from his eyes. He arched his back, stretching over the mattress to unkink muscles gone tight.
“Yes, sweet?” John waited, watching the serious expression gathering on Sherlock’s face with a small frisson of alarm. “Something wrong?”
“Hey, hey, we might be able to get this working up at the house!” John bent to retrieve it from the muck, wiping it clean on the hem of his jumper.
John watched as the muscles in Victor’s bared arm flexed. “Yeah, alright.” He found a cup from its place in the cabinet.
“Bed,” John muttered when they resurfaced for air.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, unsure of what to say.
“No, it’s okay, it’s fine,” John hastened to tell him, reaching out to pat at his shoulder.
“Is this a new place?” John asked nodding toward the general direction of the van outside.
“Mark it.”
“Oh come on. I’m sure there will be alcohol and food later.”
“Lieutenant Holmes, Sherlock, you made it.” He clasped Sherlock’s arm warmly.
The man moved to the bathroom, and Sherlock let his eyes close, relaxing as he listened to the sounds of his “bedwarmer” turning on the taps and moving things about in the next room.
“No, he cannot,” Sherlock said firmly, his arms coming up to hold John around his middle. “It’s not something clearly defined by the law, nor is it something he would want dragged through the courts. He’s bluffing. Anyway, despite himself, Mycroft actually likes you. I could tell.”
“Thank you, sir. I appreciate that. If you don’t need me for anything else . . .”
“Yeah. But where?”
“I don’t want to step on the food.”
“Yeah, hope Mr. Stanwell isn’t in today.” John had already grown weary of their local hypochondriac.
The shot widened out, moving back to show the Omega’s hand and bottom as he eased the rest of the dildo into himself. Johnny’s face contorted into a grimace of pleasure/pain as he pushed the knot at the base inside.
“Ha,” John snorted. “Best not to court bad luck.”
For dessert, Mrs. Watson produced a large glazed strawberry-topped cake that she’d smuggled in from a bakery earlier. She rose to turn down the electric lights. “No magic on this one, please, lads,” she warned as she lit the small collection of candles on the cake with a match.
“It’s a chameleon fish,” Sherlock explained. “They have a way to change colour with their surroundings. We’ve been working on a way to use the chemicals in their skin to brew a potion that will work on humans.”
“That’s incredibly unusual.”
“Yes, hang on, let’s not forget my date .  . .” Sherlock turned, gesturing to John behind him, taking it all in with a grin on his face.
“Let me see your orders, please.”  The clerk held out his hand, and Sherlock dutifully passed over a data cube. The clerk slotted it briskly into his reader pad.
“Until she opens her mouth,” Sherlock said darkly.
“No, it’s fine . . .”
A quick strafing of the net identified four possible sites in the area that the Bajoran detainees might have been transported to. Sherlock quickly broke into the databases, searching for signs of recent activity. When he found a military building that listed five new undocumented inhabitants several hours earlier, Sherlock’s blood ran cold. It wasn’t even a regular prison, listed instead as a medical research facility. Sherlock could almost feel his mind cycling up to a faster speed as he began to plan.
“Oh, how about your recent acquiring of  . . .” Mycroft proceeded to rattle off a list of all the supplies that Sherlock had lifted in the last few weeks as if he were reading them from a printed page. Sherlock’s heart sank through the floor. “The theft of these items along with your search for one Watson Harriet,” Mycroft continued, “combined with your recent encounters with a Bajoran male matching the description of Watson John has led me to believe that you have indeed been in contact with the man.”
“Why not?” Sherlock turned to nuzzle into John’s palm.
John laughed. “It’s good to have someone like that at your back.”
“No, all the way over here.”
“Ta.” John went to the coffee pot on the bench, pouring some into a nearby mug.
“You are so welcome, Jean. But oh, you poor dear.” Grand-mère  Holmes patted John’s cheek as he and Sherlock stood in the  hallway ready to depart, rucksacks and bags of baked goods weighing them down.  “Left at Hogwarts all alone next year.” She clucked her tongue in sympathy.
“Yeah, I suppose you’re right.” John’s brow creased in a way that made Sherlock want to soothe it, but there was packing to be done, and laundry to run through the dryer.
“No, no, take mine,” Sherlock said, popping up to drag a spare chair over. He squeezed himself in at the corner, against John’s elbow.
“No, it will be warmer, and light out.”
“Yes, let me just finish here.”
“Sherlock come back to bed with me.” John held out a hand. “If you’ve nothing on today.”
Sherlock’s mouth opened and closed wordlessly several times like a gormless fish.
Sherlock opened his eyes to see the tall woman dressed in red. She had a briefcase sandwiched between her feet on the floor as she gripped a bar with one hand, and held the phone she was reading with the other. A bag of Omega ginger sweets, freshly bought, bulged out one pocket of her long coat. Ah, not only bonded, but expecting a pup with her Omega as well. A closer inspection revealed crayon streaks on the side of the briefcase. Not their first child then. The Alpha smiled at something on her screen, then pocketed the device, gathering her things to exit at the next stop. Sherlock felt an almost visceral longing as he watched her leave, visions gripping him of going home to a flat where his own mate and pups waited to greet him.
Fathers and teachers,
“Thanks, I hope so.”
“Right.”
“Indeed, but only if you’re in it as well,” Sherlock said.
John smiled gratefully "No, what?"
“Wonder what all that was?” John looked toward the door, calculating if it was worth it to call Mike and ask.
“No, I expect not,” John said. He couldn’t imagine playing weddings or parties and the like paid enough to live on. Surely this talented man taught music or played in a symphony somewhere.
“No, I’m alright. Need to get back. Point of honour, don’t you know.”
When John’s hand closed over his cock, Sherlock felt a bolt of electricity run through him. He shivered at the intensity. He reached out, running his fingers over the lines of John, the heat of him, reveling in the contrast of crisp hair and the smoothness of hardening flesh. He was gratified to hear John gasp.
“But, that’s fantastic!”
“Hey sorry to bother you, mate. I wondered if you had a pencil sharpener I could borrow? Mine’s gone completely missing.”
It occurred to Sherlock to wonder what sort of meals John had access to on a regular basis. He certainly made short work of his breakfast, clearing his plate quickly before having seconds.
Deciding that this was a mystery that could wait for another day, John headed back over to Sherlock, who was still happily looking through boxes.
“John, he’s your roommate, you must get him into the study group.” Irene pounced on John again.
“Pleased to meet you,” the brunette said, offering a hand to shake while the ginger one struggled up a tight smile.
~~ THE END ~~
“Ha ha ha,” John grumbled, crawling back up.
John shook his shoulder. “Come on, we’d better go.”
John.
We move through space with our whole bodies, not our feet,
“The bath is big enough for two. Besides, perhaps we can manage a bit of
John snuggled into the duvet, into Sherlock, and was gone, slipping into peace.
“Ooh, that was just lovely, wasn’t it?” Molly turned to him, eyes shining.
“Having a spot of bother?” Mr. Holmes asked, motioning to the tie looped around John’s neck. “I can help you with that.”
“Whatever it was, it was enough to convince the Kai that you were the real deal. Congratulations. Welcome to the club, such as it is.” Kira stuck out her hand.
“I didn’t know you were in Molly’s study group.” Sherlock poked the edge of a notebook sticking out from a stack on his desk, lining up the edges.
“Oh, bit of this, bit of that.” John sighed, closing his eyes.
“Does it feel different to be with a man? You’ve only had girlfriends until now.”
John took a deep breath, catching a whiff of coconuts and tropical flowers, and tried to follow Sherlock’s instruction. At first John stumbled, tripping over Sherlock’s feet. He cursed himself.
They tried to simply push the rock aside with their combined strength, but the boulder had been set by magic and would not be moved by any other force. A great melancholy descended over the group at their failure. The dwarves were nearly ready to concede that their journey had been in vain when the little Hobbit felt compelled to speak.
John sighed. He truly was a bit weary, and now Sherlock was ordering him around the yard. But he was intrigued. And Sherlock seemed to have some idea of what was going to happen, whereas he had none whatsoever, so...lackey seemed an apt role for the time being. He made a mark in the frozen ground with his foot.
“I decided to take a little dip in the pond while completely pissed it seems.” John raked his fingers back through his hair.  “If Alastaire hadn’t seen me, I’d probably be sleeping with the fishes about now.”
“Yes, exactly.” The smile that lit up Sherlock’s face was a beautiful thing. He whirled back around to point to a section of his work, and John couldn’t help noticing how nicely his button-up shirt strained across his broad shoulders.
John replied with a sweet kiss. "Of course, love."
“What’s that mean?”
“You filthy thing, I’m going to keep you full of babies,” John growled directly into his ear. “Fuck you again as soon as these are out, keep you so fat and round you can hardly walk, all stuffed . . .”
John’s eyes slid closed.
Although John usually insisted they both eat something for breakfast, the next morning he was just as eager to get down to the beach as Sherlock was. After a quick wash, they threw on clothes and headed out.
“Glasses?”
John’s face softened as he leaned forward to squeeze Sherlock’s arm. “I’m sorry, love. I don’t mean to harp on. So, what’s good here?” He glanced over the menu.
The creature, who had once been Sir Boast A Lot, dozed on a pile of treasure that another dragon had gathered before his arrival, dreaming of plump, lazy sheep. He’d not been hunting for several days, and it seemed his stomach would soon need to be appeased. Something in the air alerted him though, and he twitched awake, rousing to sniff a new presence in his stronghold. Carefully, he moved back into the shadows, sinking beneath a pile of coins to hide and plot as the intruder made his way into the great hall.
“Very good. I’ll be right back."
“Apologies, I didn’t mean to intrude, but I thought it best to announce my presence.”
“Now, now, Violet, let the boy breathe.”
“Okay,” John said, tracing a finger along Sherlock’s cheekbone. “God, you’re so beautiful. I’ll miss seeing your face.”
“I can’t . . . we can’t. It isn’t allowed.”
“Hmmm.” The man’s strange pale eyes continued to regard him as though he were a specimen under a microscope. John found it unnerving.
John nodded, his hand slipping down to grab Sherlock’s backside, pulling him flush against him, and it was Sherlock’s turn to gasp, and writhe, trying desperately to keep silent. John moved his mouth down Sherlock’s jaw to explore the line of his ridged neck. The touch over the sensitive spot felt like fire ripping through Sherlock’s veins.
“It’s hard to believe,” Sherlock said quietly.
“Oh, John.” His eyes were a kaleidoscope of colour when his lids finally drew back open.
“There’s been a ring of murders in the shipping district,” Lestrade said. “It didn’t seem connected until we had three bodies show up in a row in very similar conditions.” Greg gestured toward the hanging photos with a sandwich half. “All were stripped to the waist, appear to have died from strangling, but showed a number of shallow knife wounds over the chest and back.” He took a large bite of his sandwich.
“Amazing. So you’re some kind of mind reader?” John asked, impressed.
“Oh! What’s number 69?”
“No it’s fine, things are fine.”
Sherlock looked so hurt, that John scrambled to reassure him. “NO, love, no. Of course not. Okay, fine. We can try some of it. What the hell.”
Sherlock stalked across the length of the room looking like a panther with his muscles long and loose. He bent, scooping up a towel he’d left in a heap and ran it over his face, across the back of his neck under his arms. John swallowed trying not to stare at the full curve of his arse, willing his brain to start working again.
John sighed and dropped the scarf into the give-away pile. It would do better at a charity shop than cluttering up the few bags he planned to take away with him.
Sherlock’s flatmate had lived with him for three months before he’d managed to notice the repeating pattern in John’s nocturnal behavior.  John’s part time schedule at the surgery kept him to a fairly regular bedtime if they didn’t have a case on. Weekends though would see him out for a pint with friends, or taking some new woman he’d met in a coffee shop or in line at Tesco’s out for dinner. The women never lasted long of course, not with Sherlock interrupting with urgently escalating text messages over the course of the evening . . .
Sherlock stepped into the downstairs rec room where the party was being held, his feet nearly silent on the plush, white pile carpet.
“So, next Tuesday.” John lingered, not wanting to go now that he was back in the beautiful man’s orbit.
It was inevitable. A few days later, the next round of executions were announced on the news feeds, Bajorans rounded up in the cities, another televised horror. The mood around the camp was palpably sad. Even the babies seemed to be crying more fretfully.  Most work was abandoned as people gathered in vigil, and that evening, a communal ceremony was held around the fire pit that had been set up behind the barn. Sherlock appeared briefly for the main part of the ritual, but as soon as things devolved into singing and drinking around the fire, he quickly excused himself. He didn’t think people wanted to test their civility with his Cardassian features that evening.  John nodded sorrowfully, letting him go. Many of those at the farm were losing people they knew.
“This is unacceptable.” John stepped forward, his face a rictus of anger. “We stick together, or the Empire has already won. YOU KNOW THIS.”
“John’s right. He doesn’t like it when you bother him.” Molly nodded. “He’s a solitary sort.”
“You’re coming to my birthday party next week?” Sherlock smiled slightly. His mother had insisted that his fifteenth birthday celebration be a huge and monstrous affair to top off the holiday season. She seemed to have invited most of the high ranking families in Dahkur City, and many from the neighboring towns as well.
“Yeah, yeah. It’s working fine. I just had to replace a bit of wiring.”
“Mummy, I’m with JOHN now. I know Mycroft told you.”
“Oh, I’m sorry. I hate these things.”
“He’s a traitor,” Kira cried, straining at the hands that held her back, looking nearly feral. “Look at the logs. He’s been communicating with the Obsidian Order all this time.” Kira jerked her chin toward the console where an image of Sherlock and Mycroft calmly discussing their father’s death sat frozen on display for the room.
“Nothing special,” Sherlock said.
“But first, breakfast,” John said.
“It was a pleasure, John.” Mycroft extended his hand across the table next.
“I hope you don’t mind, Mrs. Watson,” Sherlock added.
Sherlock nearly choked, so quickly came his release. John followed shortly thereafter, falling apart spectacularly in great heaving cries.  It was as if a flood-gate long sealed shut had burst free, and John sobbed open-mouthed against Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock petted over him, soothing him with those long, elegant hands.
“What happened? Did you have a fight? Was it more of the . . .” she leaned in, dropping her voice, “nightmares.”
“Well, neither should any of these people. This is illegal, but look it hasn’t stopped
“Hey, how was your day?” John asked fondly.
“Mols, what’s wrong?” John leaned in to catch her eye.
“John, I wanted to let you know I managed to do some digging online for Harry.”
Sherlock bent again to grab a bottle of water, bringing it to his lips. His long throat moved, muscles working as he swallowed.  “I don’t know.” A small frown knit his brows together. “People don’t mind me in study sessions, but they tend to get tired of me in social situations.”
“Oh, God.” Sherlock dropped his head back
“Blessings to you as well.”  The woman nodded, looking confused but grateful.
“John, Sherlock, thank you again, really.” Mrs. Watson said lifting a metal box from a drawer to the front desk. She opened it to count out a few notes that she handed to John. “Here you can take this from petty cash, and go buy a dozen donuts at the shop across the street. Nigel doesn’t need anything fancy for a meet over a two-story town house. Get yourselves a drink while you’re there.”
John broke off, pulling back to yank his clothes away, cursing as he had to lean back to tug his shoes off. Sherlock lay panting until John returned, sliding in over him to kiss him again like he wanted to push him through the mattress. John’s steely erection slid over Sherlock’s still clothed one, and he groaned at the feeling of it.
John smiled as Sherlock climbed gracefully out of his truck looking long, and lithe, like some kind of jungle cat as he stretched his back. John moved to join him on the front steps, pulling him into a flurry of kisses as he unlocked the door, not letting up as they fumbled the door open, and stumbled into the front hall, half kissing, half giggling.
A short bark of laughter escaped John’s throat before he cut it off. “You’re a soldier,” he said sounding dazed.
“Poor tykes. At least I was older then they took my Da.” Naavi shook his head.
A noise in the corridor drew their gazes toward the door as a tall man with a small mustache stepped out of the dark to join them.
“How do you know he came in today?” John said, surprised, though really he shouldn’t be. His lovely man was something of a mind reader at times.
John sputtered.
“Mm hmm.” John nodded his assent, burrowing closer to Sherlock as he sighed.
“Hmmm. I’m almost afraid to ask.” Mrs. Watson chuckled catching Sherlock’s eye.
They checked out, taking their bags with them to store at lockers at the museum. It was crowded, but they enjoyed the day, rambling around, taking turns deciding which exhibit to see next. Sherlock chose “First World War Collections” after John’s “Dinosaur Babies” pick. John drifted off to view a display of old munitions and bullet casings before looking up to find Sherlock peering at a case, reading something on the wall. The reflection of Sherlock’s face in the glass stopped his breath. An utterly bereft look had settled in to twist his handsome features.
“If you must know, I fancied myself something of a pirate.”  Sherlock looked a bit sheepish. “I use to stomp about with a wooden cutlass, my wellies, and a tricorn hat my mother bought me.”
“I’m sweating,” Sherlock grumbled. “The babies are making me feel hotter than the surface of the sun.”
“Make me,” Sherlock teased.
“Hungry?” Sherlock asked as they pulled apart.
John moved back, finding the packet on the bed. He peeled open the condom, rolling it down over the erection he had almost forgotten about as he focused on Sherlock’s pleasure. He quickly slicked his cock, and moved in to line himself up with Sherlock’s stretched opening, holding his weight on one arm as he eased inside. Watching Sherlock’s blissed-out face for any signs of pain, he sank into the gorgeous welcoming heat. John’s eyes slid closed as he bottomed out fitting himself flush against Sherlock's body. They sighed in unison. John didn’t want to ever move again, but Sherlock bucked his hips impatiently, and John took the hint, pulling himself half out, only to slide back in.
“I’ve never had to cheat to get top marks.” Alastaire bristled.
“Mycroft has his ways.” Mrs. Hudson brushed him aside. “The important thing is you have the address now. You can pack up and go after you finish your tea.”
“Okay.”
“I do.” Sherlock tried not to smile too widely, pleased that John remembered that after all these years.
“It wasn’t hard.” Sherlock looked a bit sheepish. “The secretary in the office had the password to the system written on a post-it note on the side of her desk.”
“Oh, stop, it’s fine.” John knocked his hand away. “Ignore me. What else do I have to do today but help carry your FIVE pairs of dress shoes to the beach?”
John thought back to last Monday when the lads had caught him in his red pants trying to get his clothes on before anyone noticed.
“Well, good,” Sherlock huffed, “I told you I’m . . .”
The brightness of the wide glassed-in space filled with plants felt like the promised land after the dark of the hallway. A woman with a long sweep of icy-blonde hair stood with her back to them using her wand to gather blooms from a variety of flowering bushes.
The adrenaline that had shot through him as he braced for John’s inevitable break-up had ebbed away leaving him weak-kneed and quite undone. “John, I’m sorry . . . it’s just, I thought you were breaking up with me.”
“Broke up via text? Well, that is low,” Sherlock commented.
“Ach no, don’t go all mushy on me now, laddie,” John said, shaking his head. “Don’t want to ruin that poncy, arsehole thing you’ve going on.” The man grinned widely as he lifted a hand to Sherlock’s back, steering him toward the exit. “Dinnae worry, the lasses will lap it up.”
Sherlock continued his ministrations, stroking and rubbing down his torso until he reached John’s penis, heavy and straining against his belly. When Sherlock’s large hand wrapped around him, John nearly arched off the bed.
Sherlock stood and squinted at the sun before picking the spot for his quadrant contraption nearby, asking John to help him set it up.
“Good, what else?”
Officials bustled about directing the young Witches and Wizards and their families to take seats set to the side while the testing went on in the center.  John spotted a number of Hogwarts students throughout the mix, and waved at a few he knew.
“Just don’t shag your boss,” Sherlock said.
“They’re spelled glove liners, guaranteed to keep your hands warm and dry, and impervious to harm. I thought you could use them for Quidditch.”
the warmth of your back
John grabbed a disappointing meal of mince and tatties with the rest of the team at the dining hall by the sports fields, and headed off for the library as soon as he could. Irene, Molly, and Mike were already there when John found the small study room on the lower level. He greeted everyone warmly, and thanked Irene for setting up the space.
Professor Pinworthy smiled as the plate swung her way. “Ah, my dear boy. Strange as it might sound, we were all young once,” she said choosing her own cake. She winked as she took a small bite, wiggling her fingers to shoo the plate of cakes back to a table.
“What else have you done, how else do you define yourself?”
“Alright, love, alright.” John petted a hand across his back. “I promise.”
“John I’m sorry if you’re disappointed . . .”
“You’re welcome.” Sherlock disappeared behind his newspaper again.
John gasps at the speed with which Sherlock whips one of the cords around his wrist while holding the other wrist firm to the mattress. Sherlock's eyes go dark, and John shivers as he ties the cord to the bedpost.
John tipped his head back and ground against Sherlock with abandon, completely oblivious to anything around them. When the song ended, morphing into something smoother, John realized two pertinent facts, they were both getting hard against each other, and Sherlock’s mother was somewhere nearby.
“Victor Trevor!” the high-pitched female voice trilled after an indistinct burble.
The prince flew for several days, encountering angry villagers who shot flaming arrows at him whenever he drew too close to a settlement. At last, exhausted and sore, he found a dragon’s lair in the mountains that seemed to have been abandoned, a perfect place to curl up and lick his wounds. To his wonder, the prince discovered that as a dragon, he had a magic of his own. For protection, he willed a large stone to block the entrance to the underground chambers, securing it with a spell. Only he or someone who knew how to crack the code written over the entrance could summon the magic to open the door.
“Thanks for playing, I had fun,” Olivia turned at the door.
John snorted a laugh, and they continued eating more companionably.
“Nope. I’m not giving him the satisfaction. I’ve made up my mind.”
Sherlock pitched his voice to carry over the trashy dubstep beat, and John responded almost immediately, eyes snapping open to fix on him. His movements were slow, his pupils dark, almost overtaking his irises, but he recognized Sherlock immediately, and made no protests as Sherlock grabbed his wrist to tug him away from his place of honor in the pit of debauchery. The other dancers groaned collectively, and a few made to halt their progress, but Sherlock hadn’t studied fencing and three forms of martial arts for nothing. He elbowed and shoved any protestors aside, quickly making a path for him and his flatmate to the nearest exit. They tumbled into the cooler air outside with relief. Sherlock finally allowed himself a deep breath as he rounded on John to grill him on the reason for the spectacle of the evening.
“Oxford?” John lifted an eyebrow.
“I’m new,” Sherlock said shortly. “Jumja fruit.” He gave the password John had sent him.
“Thanks, Bianca , this was splendid, really nice of you.” John dropped a hand to her forearm, and squeezed.
Owen tried to convince John to return with him to the U.K. over the course of the evening, but John remaining firm in his decision. They ended up back at the villa passing a jug of sangria on the terrace as they watched the full moon shimmering over the ocean. It left a bright trail over the water that looked completely solid, as if you could step out onto it and walk right off into the horizon.
“Oh, I missed you,” John moaned, trying to pull Sherlock as close as possible, running his mouth and fingers over as much of him as he could reach.
“Thank you, sweetie.”
John flicked his gaze across the classroom to where Alastaire stood already briskly stirring his ingredients into his cauldron.  As if he could feel the weight of John’s eyes, the git looked up to flash John an irritatingly smug expression.  John pulled a silly face at him, and redoubled his efforts to get his potion brewing. Alastaire preened like a peacock later when Professor Lestrade proclaimed his mix the best in the class. John licked his lips, and looked at the clock again.
“I can’t tell you that.” A pained expression crossed Sherlock's face. “I mean, I do care, John of course I do. It’s just that, I’ll bollocks it all up. I don’t know how . . . to do this.”
When John had retrieved the story, they were able to lay the pictures on the small coffee table side by side to compare. The illustrations were almost exactly alike except that in their story, the inscription over the door looked like a pattern of dots.
“Yeah, true. In the past, but . . .”
“I understand,” Sherlock forced out between his teeth, “things just fine, Mycroft. Is that all? Am I free to go?”
“John, I hated my father for grounding me,” Sherlock whispered. “I kept wishing him hurt or dead all last fortnight, horrible things, and now . . .” he broke off as a sob bubbled up his throat.
“You alright, then?”
They enjoyed the sensation of simply rolling against each other for several long minutes, feeling their ardor build before John reached down to fondle Sherlock’s erection.
Sherlock paused to draw a breath, and a small titter rippled over the crowd as students giggled behind their hands. The adults shifted uncomfortably.
John cracked an eye to find Sherlock, a riot of curls silhouetted against the sun, looming over him.
“Alright, just let me use the bathroom, and I’ll be good to go.”
“John.” Sherlock left off licking his spoon to regard him. “You are going to be an excellent father.”
“I love you too,” Sherlock sighed, the relief that flooded him a giddy, heady thing.
you anything.”
“Bye, Kira,” John said.
Sherlock made certain John wasn’t glancing backwards as he followed him across the intersection and down the darkened street. John kept up a lively step, whistling to himself, and Sherlock quickened his own pace to keep him in sight. He moved close to the building fronts, slipping behind a group of blokes out on a stag do when John did happened to turn his head.  The detective had left his distinctive Belstaff at home, wearing simply dark jeans and a black shirt to better blend into a crowd, but there was no sense in giving John a direct view of him.
“Hmmm?” John’s voice came muffled against his curls.
“God. I think I saw stars,” John croaked. He was dimly aware that he might have been yelling when he shook to pieces moments earlier.
“Nope.” John looked down at his sandwich with a frown. “Got stood up.”
while people are being killed en masse.” Sherlock stabbed a finger to cut the call.  Sherlock stared at the blank screen in horror for several minutes as the reality of the situation sunk in before folding down over the console. He lay his head into his arms, defeated, and let the tears come.
He skimmed past MENTAL EXCITEMENT, NOVEL READING, NYMPHOMANIA, and OPIUM HABIT, and was just wondering about OVER ACTION OF THE MIND when there was a sudden
“Thank you. I did too.” John kept his eyes on his plate as he scooped up another forkful of eggs.
“Yeah, what do you think about teaching a class in that? Maybe we could get a few others to lead some Bajoran defense classes, set up a ranking system. Give them something to work toward.”
“Oh, Sherlock. He does love his little games, doesn’t he?” His mother trailed a shrill little laugh as she moved to take her husband’s arm. “Mycroft we were hoping you could take a look at the portfolio while you were here and see if Basil’s stocks are in the right places?”
“Okay.” Sherlock passed him the keys.
“No I guess not, I just wanted to make sure . . .”
“Sherlock?” John groaned, groping around beside him.
“I don’t mind telling you, you’re not at all like Sherlock’s usual picks. You’re just lovely, dear.” She reached out to pat his arm.
John Watson was in love.
Sherlock retrieved his coat, and they lingered in the lobby until Sherlock’s Aunt Lily and cousin Olivia appeared. Mycroft excused himself saying he had a conference call to take, as Mr. and Mrs. Holmes fell into conversation with another couple. Sherlock and John found a love seat beside a large potted plant to share. It didn’t offer much privacy, but it was the best on offer.
“Alright.”
and fill them with your honeyed words and touch
“Certainly, sir. Simply fill this out.”
“Come on.” Sherlock moved ahead, feeling his way along the wall when he suddenly blipped out of sight.
“Hey, stop worrying about it.” John beckoned Sherlock to join him.
“You want to come, don’t you?”
John’s full consciousness poured in. His horrid roommate had obviously joined him in the bed last night as John now found himself plastered along his backside, an arm thrown tightly around his middle. The man glared frostily over his shoulder, but his wild head of curls sticking every way somewhat ruined his posh arsehole act.
“Oh, no. Just no.” John rose to his feet.
“Oh, yes, and I almost forgot.” Sherlock scooted forward to dive back into his bags. He rooted around until he produced a mobile. “I got you a phone to use. It’s got all the latest trace-blocking technology and it’s paid up through the year. My number’s in the contacts, so you can let me know if something comes up and you can’t make a meeting.”
The weather had dipped to raw as the days slid into winter proper, but Sherlock kept up his habit of after-work walks, simply adding an extra layer or two to his outfit. He’d found a shop a few kilometers from his flat that sold jumja sticks and he enjoyed the chance to stretch his legs, traveling back and forth there on foot.
John gasped in surprised when Sherlock leapt up suddenly, his long limbs a flurry of motion. He  flipped John neatly onto his back to scramble on top of him, his thighs bracketing John’s hips. John’s cock went from half-hard to full attention in a heartbeat.
“Mmmm,” Sherlock agreed, moving his hips up to meet him.
Sherlock squirmed, melting into the cushions as John licked stripes up his rotund abdomen, pushing Sherlock’s shirt even higher to reveal his swollen breast buds.
“You keep calling me those names.” Sherlock peered at John’s face. “They were meant as a joke . . . for the weekend.”
“My God. Must you two do that at the
02. California Girls
John’s eyes fluttered open. No more blindfold. John’s throat hurt, and his nose was clogged. He ran a hand over his face. It came away wet.
“I’ve been with a man before.” John leaned in to press his check to Sherlock’s chest. “It wasn’t anything . . . formal. It was quick. His name was Andrew.”
“Yes.” John nodded. “I can, and thank you, Sherlock, you don’t know how much this will help.”
The other hand slid into his hair, scratching lightly over his scalp. It sent shivery trails down his spine that blossomed suddenly into pain as a handful of hair was grabbed up and pulled, hard.  John arched back into it, easing some of the pressure. He could feel the warmth of Sherlock’s body against his side, and he leaned into it, finding it grounding in the swirl of sensations. God, had he ever been this hard?
“Gland games,” Sherlock drawled, making his pronouncement as long and disgusted as he could manage. “It’s ridiculous.”
“Doesn’t he look handsome?” She reached up to brush imaginary lint off the front of Sherlock’s jacket.
“All right, fine. A drink, but just as friends, okay? I’m just not up for anything else right now.”
“Well, I’m not working as a SLAPPER,” John huffed.
Sherlock dropped a kiss to John’s softening penis, tucking it safely away before rising to stand before him.
“John, I’m so sorry, I had no idea that Mycroft . . . “
“You nearly killed me.” John grinned in reply.
“I do, just not as often as you do.”
“Oh, this is part of the Ocean Institute,” Sparky informed them later. “They study the sea life. They have an aquarium as well. You might want to visit it. It’s over at
“I can’t do it.” Sherlock pushed the cube back toward him, but Mycroft refused to take it.
Sherlock set the vibrator going again, before grabbing the lube to slick up his fingers. He leaned forward to take John’s cock in hand, sliding the foreskin along his steely length. John made an unearthly sound of relief.
“If it got back to the mystery woman that several people were looking for her, it could tip her off, but one? I could certainly be what I say, a smitten chance encounter.”
He strained upward meeting each of John’s thrusts, a humming building under his skin . . . suddenly it was all too much. Sherlock fell apart with a cry, pumping out hot splashes. John drove into him with a few more thrusts before grunting out his own release. He collapsed heavily over Sherlock, lying as if stunned, while Sherlock waited for the world to coalesce back around them.  Sherlock squeezed his eyes tight feeling a tear sliding out from underneath the lids. Others joined.
The children agreed readily, relaxing with relief.
They guests were herded next door to a room in a side building where drinks and nibbles were on offer amidst tall floral displays and more swathes of pink draped about the room. The bridal party stood to receive well wishes against one side. John shuffled along with the crowd alone having lost Sherlock’s parents in the crush. When he came to the attendants standing politely nearby, he instantly zeroed in on Sherlock. An older gentleman was shaking Sherlock’s hand, droning on about how much he’d grown. John could see Sherlock was struggling to respond appropriately.
“Mmmm, I want
“Course I did. I got it ages ago.” John reached into a back pocket to extract a small item folded up in lightweight paper. He passed it over, and Sherlock held the crinkled package for just a moment, turning it over, wondering what it was.
“Excellent idea. Shake the cobwebs out. Sometimes all you need is a change of scenery for a fresh perspective.”
He slowed the car a bit, looking for a place to turn off. He found a small lane that led down toward the sea.
They got ready for bed in record time, finally stripping down to crawl under the covers together.
. . .” John shuddered, finally emptying himself into Sherlock’s mouth.
John spent his days reading, cooking and tempting Sherlock away from his work for a board game or a more adult game with some of the “toys” in their bedroom. He truly couldn’t imagine being happier.
“What are you drinking?” John lifted the bottle from the floor where Sherlock had left it. “Why don’t I put that in a glass for you?”
“I’ll sound the fire alarm, and get everyone out right now,” Sherlock huffed.
“An excellent suggestion.” Sherlock scratched at the mess drying on his belly.
“All right then. See you later, Vic.” John waved, hustling Sherlock back to the stairs.
“You too, John.”
“Oh, sorry, I forgot to take it off.” John reached up to remove the jewelry, but Sherlock stayed his hand.
“Shhh, it’s alright.” John patted his side. “Here, budge up.”
“Together?” Sherlock frowned.
“Oh, that’s Annie,” the waitress said, surprised, peering over Sherlock’s shoulder as she set John’s steak and kidney pie to the table.
“Why did you get this? It’s adorable.” John couldn’t resist reaching up to tap it a last time, watching as it flickered its wings cheerfully at him.
Sherlock nodded. He hadn’t come with anything the night before but the clothes on his back. There was nothing to gather up, nothing left to use as a reason to linger another moment.
“Oh, hello.” Sherlock's cheeks pinked up rather charmingly when he realized where he was.
“Stir more frequently than required, and cut ingredients into smaller pieces.” John read dutifully.
"Well John, it is rather anticlimactic to state the obvious."
“The women are in charge at my house. Men come to us for  . . . recreational scolding. I have health care, and benefits, and none of my workers ever get the sort of treatment you received here tonight.” Irene reached forward to slide a finger under Molly’s chin, tipping it up to the light to better examine the mark marring her pretty face. “I’d like to offer you a job.”
By the time Sherlock had finished a long explanation of Mycroft, his brother who ran the British government, and occasionally Sherlock, and recounted the mission in Kabul, and his work as a consulting detective in London, the car had pulled up at a private airstrip where a small plane waited on them.
“You absolutely nailed it.” John licked his lips, and just like that, Sherlock went hard.
“John, no!” Mrs. Watson cried as John launched himself head-first at Jenno. The old man folded, dropping the torch as they hit the ground, but the weapon remained in his grip, firing crazily around them.
“Do you mind if I offer Kira room at the house?” John turned to ask Sherlock.
Eventually John worked his way back toward Sherlock’s flat, stopping in at a small grocery to buy a few things with his remaining money.  He got back into Sherlock’s building by following another resident on their way in. As he reached out to knock on the door for 2B, it suddenly occurred to John that if no one was around, he’d have no way to get to his things.
Warmth spread over Sherlock at the laughter that spilled out of Molly. An overwhelming need to do her a good deed suddenly struck him with some force.  Glancing about the room with a practiced eye, he finally located what he was looking for. “Molly, come with me.”
“I know something that would make it even lovelier.” John leaned in, propping his forearms over Sherlock’s shoulders.
“Good. I can’t wait to put all this mess behind us.”
“You lot, stay here.” Teddy yelled at the rest of the team as he, and Victoire, and John pushed off on their brooms to join the melee overhead.  They flew in quickly.
been seen together. It might not be safe for you to stay in Kabul either.”
God, he could do this. If this was the only way Sherlock wanted him, if a sham boyfriend was the only sort of relationship he could handle, John would be his man. Gladly. It would be okay, except for . . .
“Welcome Master Mycroft, Master Sherlock, and honoured guest.”
.  Sherlock waded over to the rocks. He pulled himself up onto a wide flat shelf, staining the surface dark with the water sluicing from his body. The stone was deliciously warm after the cool of the water. Sherlock stretched out, luxuriating in the feel of the sun shining down on his chilled flesh. He closed his eyes, a happy rumble in his throat.
“Why aren’t you going to the distribution center on Wayborne street?” Sherlock switched back to Cardassian for the benefit of his fellow soldier glaring daggers at them all.
When they broke through the trees to view the house, John’s mouth dropped open. It wasn’t just that it was a huge, posh Georgian manor, which was intimidating enough, but it was the exact image of a house from a book he’d loved as a child. In it, a boy called Timothy had lost his parents, and been sent away to stay with a kindly woman who turned out to be a witch, the good sort, with a magic garden in the back. John had read that story until the pages fell out. It wasn’t that he’d wished his parents dead, but Mum had been sick already, and Dad falling in to the bottle, and the idea of a magical house where no one yelled or threw things had been a fabulous escape.
Sherlock leaned in to press a kiss to John’s cheek, and just like that he didn’t mind anymore about his bum leg or falling on his arse like a prat. He was standing, looking at one of the most beautiful places on Earth with truly the most stunning man at his side. Being upset about anything just seemed bad manners.
(See the end of the chapter for
“No, it’s fine.”
“The ground is frozen. We need something sharp. The surveyors post!”
“Good. Now add 1,596 to 3,192.”
“Yes, we could check that one out too if you like,” Sherlock said. “It should function much the same.”
“Okay.” Sherlock wrinkled his nose. “But what if I don’t like something?”
John looked up from the papers on his desk to regard the older man. “Yes, I did, thanks, Sarah dropped it off.”
“That would be entirely up to you.”
John appraised the steadily growing tower. “Okay, there are lots of the blocks that we wrote on still easily accessible. I think we should focus on those.”
Victor swayed unconsciously toward him, and Sherlock felt a reckless wave of some nameless wanting wash over him.  In a few swift strides, Sherlock had Victor plastered against him. He wrapped one hand around the back of Victor’s neck, the other digging into the meat of one arse cheek as he pulled him into a deep, open-mouthed kiss.  Victor startled as if hit by a jolt of electricity, then melted into Sherlock’s embrace obviously enjoying the taste of another man’s spunk as much as the warmth of Sherlock’s tongue probing his mouth. Sherlock crowded Victor against the wall, and ground his own hot erection into the answering hardness at Victor’s groin. They both groaned, increasing the pressure of their thrusts until they were bucking against each other with no more sense than a pair of rutting dogs. Sherlock felt when Victor came apart, his rhythm stuttering as his release ripped through him. Sherlock followed shortly after, sadly unguarded as the bliss whited out his senses. He didn’t see Victor’s fist rising until it had clocked him across the side of the head and he stumbled back, dizzy with the pain.
last night. You can’t fool me with all of your ‘this is sentimental nonsense’ grumbling.”
“Oh?” Mycroft cocked an eyebrow. “What do you think?”
Again they stood sandwiched belly to belly outside the bedroom door waiting for it to open.
John would have been happy to simply ignore the git, but Professor Lestrade had obviously picked John to be his star pupil. Alastaire took it as a personal insult, and doubled his efforts to best John at each class. If it weren’t for the fact that he needed excellent grades in Potions to get a spot in a hospital training program, John would have slacked off and just let sodding Alastaire have the limelight. The ponce was actually quite good at potions.  If only he could be good at being human, they’d get on so much better John thought with a sigh.
“You can since it was your idea.” Sherlock’s deep chocolate of a voice was even more potent in the dark.
Sherlock tottered to join the queue at the ticket booth, the two of them waiting their turn.
John looked up, guiltily, caught out. “Hey, love.”
Sherlock finally took a deep breath, and lifted his chin, launching himself into his prepared words. “Good afternoon, staff, students, alumni, family, friends and . . . others. You will listen to many long-winded speeches given at this graduation ceremony today – in the company of which I must include this very talk of my own, so I do apologize at the outset for that. I will endeavor to keep my words brief.  Much advice will be bandied about today, most of it well-meaning, some of it garnered from past experience, and some of it simply extrapolated from feel-good editorials found in the people section of local newspapers. Some of you will receive token gifts of quill sets, and heirloom pocket watches as if this will somehow arm you for your life after school. For you will be told that you have been prepared for the future after your years of hard work at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Quite simply most of what you will hear at this ceremony will be complete and utter bullshit.”
“Alright, and you had to give me this in person, because  . . .” Sherlock fingered the smooth of the metal.
“Yes.”
Teddy and Owen looked chagrined. “Sorry mate, we were just having a bit of fun,” Owen said. “Winding you up.”
Mycroft raised an eyebrow. He regarded John for just a moment before clasping his palm, shaking it as solemnly as if he were greeting some head of state. “You as well, John. I do wish you the best in your upcoming endeavors.”
It wasn’t easy, the car gave no extra room for easy maneuvering, and Sherlock cried out when John accidentally kneed him somewhere tender, but John managed it all the same.
As Sherlock went to inspect the lab equipment, John began opening the freezers. His whoop of delight was as heartfelt as Sherlock’s when he discovered that the first one was filled with frozen meat. He found steaks, lamb chops, pork loins, and several whole chickens.
John sighed. Reluctantly, he helped Sherlock empty the back of the cupboard, spreading the toys across the carpet of the bedroom floor for further inspection.
They fell into long, slow snogging, wrapped under the duvet, ignoring the world as warm lips and breath, and tongues wove magic, sliding together. John slotting his thigh between Sherlock’s, feeling the double pleasure of both of their cocks stirring slightly to life.
“No,” Sherlock agreed, nuzzling in close, bending to find John’s lips again.
“Ugh.” Sherlock mock shuddered. “Pumpkin, cutie-pie, muffin, If we go with French, they have
in California besides go to Hollywood and the beach?” Sherlock wrinkled his nose.
“Shame about Wimbourne.” Owen grinned before taking a swallow from his mug.
“That can easily be arranged.”
“That’s all right, then.” Owen grinned, selecting one for himself. “I’m a keeper. Need to bulk up.”
“No, the expanded space is still contained within your room.”
John kissed his mouth quite thoroughly before moving along Sherlock’s jaw to smear kisses down that impossibly long pale throat. No matter how many times John had touched Sherlock in a day, it seemed he still craved more, more skin, more drugging kisses, more pressing as close as possible, more . . . John bit lightly at the juncture of shoulder and neck, and felt Sherlock jolt against him.
“Oh, Sherlock.” John shook his head.
24. Wild Honey
Sherlock didn’t clap eyes on John again for days. He’d been busy for the better part of a week interviewing a number of staff with the British embassy, mugging and joshing, doing a puff piece on “Brits in service abroad” for the folks back home. Most of it had been stuff and nonsense, but he had managed to extract helpful information from one of the secretaries about her boss, the liaison with the military forces. Sherlock was almost certain he’d nailed the embezzlement scheme to Mycroft’s satisfaction. All he needed was a few pictures of a meeting between Mr. Big Brit, and Mr. Afghan drug lord cum contractor and the deed would be done.
John, stood, illuminated in the dim light of a street lamp, panting, his fair hair tousled fetchingly, his shirt askew, half unbuttoned, his eyes wide and guileless, and the most disarming smile playing over his lovely mouth. Sherlock sucked in a breath trying to gather his forces when the scent of John washed over him, and Sherlock nearly choked.  The cologne that John had put on earlier seemed to have intensified, deepened, becoming infinitely more complex as it mixed with the earthy smell of John’s person, and the tang of his sweat. Sherlock tried swallowing as his mouth had gone completely dry.
The emotional component of Sherlock’s contentment was the most unexpected. He had no frame of reference for the way he felt about John. He cared about what John thought, and about what he wanted. He enjoyed John’s company to a degree he wouldn’t have believed possible. With John, he felt seen and valued, safe and loved.
“Oops, pardon,” she said, scurrying around them. “Damion, come on.” She scolded the smaller one crossly, tugging on his arm. “We’ll miss the portkey if you don’t hurry up.”
“Yeah, but even that won’t get Dahkur into the running for top spot. Oh look, you’ve got syrup all over you. Have we any napkins?”
“You don’t want to know.” John smiled. “Speaking of bands . . . you’ll never guess who I saw in Heidleberg, at a house party?”
John leaned forward, and opened his mouth. It only took Sherlock’s clever fingers a few moments to find him. He popped something onto John’s tongue that exploded in a metallic, salty brine when he bit down. It wasn’t his favorite, but it was interesting. He moved it around in his mouth as he chewed, focusing on the feel and taste of it.
“John, I’m so sorry, I realized I kept prattling on about your girlfriend. I just assumed, and I never gave you a chance to say any different.”
Sherlock sprawled obligingly across the bed as John crawled over him, pushing the covers back. He popped the lid of the bottle to coat his palm with the fragrant slick, letting it warm a moment before sliding his hand over Sherlock’s beautiful cock, rotating his wrist with several passes, coating him tip to root.
Later, when John returned to his dorm, he was horrified at the pounding sound that greeted him on his floor. Of course the noise only grew louder as he approached his room. He unlocked the door and stepped reluctantly into the wall of noise. Sherlock, for once, was at his desk, calmly reading something on his laptop as the eerie screeching sound that might charitably be called music rolled out of the speakers beside him.
“No, no, I’m fine.”  Sherlock found himself feeling suddenly tongue tied. Although he’d dreamed about John coming for ages and ages, he’d never quite planned out the visit beyond wrapping himself around John and holding on tight. It suddenly occurred to him that he had no idea what a good host needed to actually do.
“My middle name is Hamish. I hate it though. Always feel like I’ve done something wrong when I hear it, like my mum is calling me in for a whipping. Still, Sherlock and Hamish – has a nice ring to it, yeah?”
“Well, yeah, I got used to some heat in Afghanistan.”
Almost in a trance, Sherlock dropped in beside him. John pulled him close, urging Sherlock to lift up and wrap his legs around his waist. John’s hands moved to hold him in place, comfortably cradling his arse. “Mmmm, can’t hold you like this on land.”
“Yeh, okay.”
Dom dug out a pack of cards, and they enjoyed playing some games as the train travelled the miles back to London.  Everyone waved good-bye and scattered at King’s Cross Station leaving John alone as he shouldered his bag, and searched for his mother.
John punched his pillow into place, and tried to find a more comfortable spot to lie on.  He’d been hoping Sherlock might be at the room when he got home, but no such luck.
“Good,” Kira said. “We’ve finally got enough beds for everyone sleeping there.”
John debated letting Sherlock know he was coming. In the end, the decided to leave it as a glorious surprise. He knew Sherlock would probably have to work part of his visit, but any time together was better than nothing. John felt ready to burst by the time classes ended on Friday, and he could finally get away. He’d gotten permission from Professor Pinworthy to leave school, and traded prefect duties to have the weekend free and clear. John had only a sketchy idea where Sherlock’s new flat was, but he had an address, and that was good enough to be going on with. John could hardly believe it, but it looked like Operation Sherlock was actually happening!
Sherlock took his hand in his own, the man’s tomfoolery melting his edges despite his best efforts to remain unwelcoming. “William Sigerson.”
“Darling, I can’t tell you how long it’s been since I had a good soak at a spa.” The woman beside Sherlock tipped her glass back to drain it. “Where has that waiter gotten off to? I’m feeling half parched this evening.”
“Ooh, bitter rivals?” John raised his eyebrows.
“That’s horrid. That’s just horrid,” Victoire said shaking her head.
“You’ll send an owl once you two are back?” Teddy asked as those leaving  took their places around the walking stick that served as the portkey.
“John.” Sherlock nudged the man passed out next to him. A thin shaft of light illuminated a slice of his sweetly-slack face, tipping his long fair eyelashes in gold. John snuffled and made to roll deeper into the pillows.
“Of course I know . . .”
“Come here. Come up here.” Sherlock wiggled his fingers.
“So, we have our measuring stick, an old surveyor's stake, some rope, and the moon, and it’s about an hour to midnight. However shall we pass the time?”
John felt like an utter rat but he pulled Rhys against him anyway. “Oh, God, yes..”
“How did you do?” John asked.
“Oh, right . . .” John breathed, and bent to slide Sherlock’s cock in between his waiting lips.
John followed his gaze to see Teddy with his arms around a revived Victoire on the ground. The pair of them seemed to be trying out for an "ecstatic snogging" competition. By the looks of things, they were in the lead.
“I can see you aren’t one for stew.”
Since we've had John in Spain, I've been listening to Spanish guitar almost obsessively. Here's another song that is just divine -
“I’m a general practitioner at the moment, though I was a field surgeon in the army for awhile.”
“Well, I should like to think so. I’m not shagging just anyone these days.”
“Mycroft, what the blazes are you doing here?”
Sherlock was completely overdressed for the hardware store in a bespoke pair of trousers and a dark blue button-up shirt that he’d at least made slightly casual by rolling his sleeves to the elbow. John was upset to note the lingering bruise on his left cheekbone was still slightly visible.
“Oh Sherlock, as the old adage goes,
“Mmmm.” Sherlock hummed, dropping his covering to prowl over the bed, settling himself to straddle John’s legs.  “Where were we?”
Mycroft snorted. “So, what’s been happening with our little project?”
The girl closest to John snickered.
“There, you go, beautiful man. There you are.” John’s voice dipped into pure gravel as he growled against Sherlock’s ear, his hand playing magic on his body below.
“Hmmm?” He could feel John’s smile against his lips.
“Never!” Alastaire said. “It’s over here.” He lead the boys back across the room to a long chest of drawers, and knelt to work the bottom one open.
John sobbed when his orgasm finally rolled over him, pumping white stripes over his belly up to his chest.
“Do you want another drink?” Sherlock raised his voice to be heard over the noise.
Sherlock and John exchanged a look. John leaned in to whisper at Sherlock’s ear.
“Hmmm, most Cardassians I know seem to prefer long, dull allegories about a duty well performed.”
The teacher began the class, and the bubbles of conversations around them stilled as eyes moved to the front of the room. John tried to focus on what the professor was saying, but it was hard going. He was so aware of the man stretched out in his chair next to him, his long legs neatly crossed at the ankle, arms folded across his chest.
“I generally don’t take missing persons cases, but a man emailed me recently that his fiancé, Kerry Williams, died five years ago. Then, several weeks ago, he saw her on the telly in the background of a news story.”
“Come here, you gorgeous woman.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Buggering hell,” John said, laughing. “I guess I’m a kept man now, eh?”
John sighed, and pushed up to sit on the edge of the bed, reaching out to silence the noise.
Sherlock licked over all of John’s cock, no spot left unattended as he caught the sticky stripes with the flat of his tongue, greedily gobbling up the treat. John groaned at the pleasure that shimmied through him. Sherlock scooped up another dollop of honey, dripping from two fingers, that he smeared over the tip of John’s cock. Almost purring, Sherlock lapped over the crown, guiding it into his mouth to take all of John inside, sinking down, sheathing him in wet heat.
“Come ON, JOHN! There’s not a moment to lose!” Sherlock bellowed, reaching for the door.
“Sshhhh.” A finger against his mouth surprised him. “Calm down. Tell me your safeword.”
Again, John moved in beside Sherlock and helped carry the thing over to the tent.
“Don’t you know it.” Irene grimaced, taking a sip from her take-away coffee. “It’s too early in the morning for crowds
“No, no, it isn’t just you!” Sherlock punctuated his words with his hands flung into the air. “We should have talked about it, discussed things. I know. I ran off. It isn’t how it’s done! I shouldn’t . . .” Sherlock hands fluttered about like confused birds.
“Interested in his welfare. Exactly how long have you and Sherlock been
“Oh God, Mike. It’s not . . . we’re really not,” John sputtered, swinging toward his remaining friend.
“John . . .”
“Ah, you must come back when you have more time.” Angelo pulled such a disappointed face that John almost laughed.
English: "This is my treasure, John. He just arrived from Great Britain."
“Hey, I’m not that short!” John grumbled playfully.
John was so beautiful as he danced under the flashing lights, grinning and moving his hips in ever-changing patterns.
“John, I’m so sorry.” Sherlock looked about to cry. “I ruined it before, and now I’ve ruined it again.”
"Ta for that. What do you propose for Sherlock and me now?"
“Oh, silly boys, you’re both good for each other.” Mrs. Hudson laughed. “Sherlock, you needed someone, rattling around in that big house all alone. And you, John. You’ve just blossomed being here. You’re a good fit. Not like me and my husband, Frank. No, that was just a physical thing.” Mrs. Hudson drained the last of her wineglass.
They laughed as they pounced on each other, pushing, tickling, breathlessly trying to gain the upper hand. Sherlock swiped a hand along the back of John’s knee, and the man nearly shrieked. Sherlock couldn’t help grinning. He knew where John was most ticklish too.
With a sigh, Sherlock reached out to take the present, pulling the paper and lid off to reveal the gold pocket watch nestled inside. “Father’s watch.” He said simply flicking his eyes back towards Mycroft.
“The boss will be with you in a few minutes.”
John was totally non-plused, “But, but, really? You already knew?”
“Yeah, I found some in the freezer. Want another?”
“The person you were sleeping with before we got together. It was her, wasn’t it?”
“However, to begin mok’bara, one must learn the basic forms, so we won’t be sparring anymore today. What we will be doing is some calisthenics to build strength, and then a run through of the first form of movements. Alright spread out, make sure you have space to swing your arms.”  Sherlock clapped his hands and watched as the teens dutifully spread out to begin their practice.
“John . . . and I  . . . know one of them, Kira Nerys?”
“Hang on a minute. Yeah . . .” John looked up, searching his memory. “There’s
“Mmmm,” John agreed, snuggling down into the bedding, letting his eyes slide shut.
“Do you know me?”
They’d avoided this awful conversation as long as they could.
Sherlock rubbed over his back, soothingly, and bit by bit, John relaxed against him, and it was okay. It was more than okay. When Sherlock gently asked about his injuries, it wasn’t a problem to talk about it.
“So, what advice did Sherlock have?”  Teddy whispered as John scanned the page. Sherlock had left him his old Advanced Potions book, and John tried his best to decipher the many scribbled notes jotted in the margins. His observations generally improved every potion in the book significantly.
Sherlock kept his hands in the loose manacles to hide the fact that he was now a free man, at least partially. He wondered if the tool might help him open the lock to the vehicle’s back door even if the lock was outside when he realized with a start that the gentle movement of the truck in motion had ceased. They had stopped somewhere.
A cry ran through the crowd as the countdown reached zero, and the cloaking field around the farm shimmered, and winked out. The sky looked even darker black, the scattering of stars piercing, unforgiving points of light. Sherlock couldn’t help glancing at the large central bonfire roaring in the central plaza. They were naked, exposed, throwing light and movement out to whoever might be watching.
‘Well, they can have the jewel, but they can’t have you. You’re mine now.’ The dragon flew to the entrance where the great stone blocked the entryway. With a few muttered words, the boulder creaked and rolled to the side. The band of dwarves camped outside were greatly surprised when an enormous dragon poked out to chuck their beloved gemstone at their feet.
The man slipped a hand under his kilt, sliding up the back of his thigh to grasp onto an arse cheek again. It felt better than good. John lost the thread of what he was doing as clever fingers moved about, probing and stroking. When his friend worked his hand around to grasp his erection, John jolted.
So John tackled him onto the bed and kissed him until they were both too breathless for words.
“Hot weekend, eh?” Mike winked.
number?” John lifted his eyebrows.
Tensions that had risen during prep time only worsened as exam week proper rolled in. Students walked the halls like zombies mumbling under their breath, fingers twitching at phantom wands as they practiced a last tricky bit of a spell on their way to class. Teachers and prefects alike were on high alert watching for any casualties from magic gone wrong that needed emergency transport to the infirmary. The ghosts of the castle had taken to hiding away from all the fuss and bother, except for Peeves the poltergeist of course. He seemed to have made it his sacred duty to jump out and scare the life out of any first years, already at wits end, walking the corridors. Madame Comfrey had taken to passing out calming tonic at meal times to any who requested it. The entire school felt like a wave of nervous energy ready to burst over the thin dam holding it in place.
“We can try,” Sherlock agreed, “but it won’t be inherently stable.”
“That was cracking good.” Dom, the other twin, nodded from farther down.
“I’m trying something new. Experimenting with some skin scrubs, and lotions. Might branch out with a whole new line.”
We welcome your kind comments and kudos. 😊❤️😊
“It was a bit salty. Maybe something else?”
“You may call me Kai Opaka,” she said with genuine warmth.
plenty.
“You’ll write dear. Make sure you’ll write, yes?”
“Yes.” Sherlock turned his head to lay a kiss to John’s palm, grateful.
“You were so engrossed in your evidence boxes, and then I was so engrossed in getting you off, that I guess it slipped my mind.”
"Hate phones.” Mycroft waved an elegant hand about. “They’re always bugged.”
Sherlock rumbled something in reply that John couldn’t quite catch, and he realized what had started innocently enough had turned into deliberate  eavesdropping on the men outside. He decided he had two options here, be a man, and step up to make himself known, or be a mouse and sneak off the way he’d come hoping they hadn’t noticed him.
Thankfully the problem areas in the fence were easy to find, places where it had ripped apart.  They were able to solder wires back together easily enough with the maintenance wand they’d found. Lupaza had been helpful if not friendly holding the ends together, and they walked back to the house in a reasonably companionable mood.
“John, don’t you trust me?”
– Sun Tzu.
Sherlock flicked his gaze toward John, surprised. He’d met the
Sherlock had no words for the feeling of being held safe in John’s arms. He let himself relax by degrees.
John staggered back to his dorm, an arm flung around Mike as they wobbled up the stairs. Someone had started a drinking game at the pub, and never one to shy away from a challenge, John had knocked back a few more beers than he’d intended. Mike was a bit pissed as well, and the both of them giggled uproariously as it took them three tries to get the door to the corridor open.
“Hey, we’re not the one yelling ‘Who’s my good kitty?’ in the middle of the night.” Teddy mocked in a funny high-pitched voice. He caught Owen’s eye and they both snickered.
The females tended to group in clumps around the main bar and at the tables. The males, on the other hand, took up much of the dance floor, and the smaller bar where a fit blond man with no shirt was cheerfully pouring orders at an astonishing speed. Sherlock found himself following the movements of the barkeep, his arm muscles shifting as he hefted bottles, and worked the taps. It was somewhat mesmerizing.
(See the end of the chapter for
They read until their voices were sore, and John yawned wide enough to crack his jaw.
“Freedom.” Sherlock echoed, raising his own glass to touch rims with John’s.
John let himself in the front door a bit nervously, wondering who or what might greet him that evening. He’d called Sherlock as he left the office, but had only reached his voicemail. All was quiet when he walked into the foyer. When he called out for Sherlock, he heard a muffled reply from the back of the house. John found him in his workroom, elbows deep in honey as he bottled what had dripped from some honeycomb into his vat.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, yeah, right.” John looked over at the mass of dark curls just peeking out from the blankets, and reached over to touch his boyfriend’s shoulder. He gave it a bit of a shake. “Sherlock.”
“Sorry they didn’t have pinot noir at the bar, I hope merlot is okay.”
“I'd say two,” said Sherlock, “maybe more if we can catch some fish.”
, on his front step.
“Why don’t you get behind the driver’s side? There’s more leg room for me behind my Mum,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock picked that moment to appear at John’s side. “I was in luck.” He peered into his bag. “They gave me a break on the strainers even though the sale ended yesterday.” He looked up and spotted Sarah. “Oh, hello.”
“See, it’ll be fii . . .” John leapt onto the beds, rolling into the middle.
“My mother . . . and other relations are under the misapprehension that I am currently in a relationship with someone. If I show up at said wedding unattached, they will take it upon themselves to begin matching me up with a ‘suitable partner,’ if not at the weekend, then over the following months.”
.”  Sherlock turned to John for back-up.
“So what’s all this, then?” John asked. “Doing a bit of remodeling, are we?”
“Oh?” John raised his eyebrows.  “Where are we off to?”
“Well, then it’s unusual, and certainly bad timing, but not the end of the world,” Clara offered.
Sherlock felt the brief moment of weightlessness swoop through him as the vehicle dived sharply downward. Everyone called out as the sight of the ground rising to meet them filled the windscreen. Lupaza pulled up at the last second, hitting the ground with a thump rather than a crash. They slid, bumping wildly until the vehicle came to a halt just before careening into the massive stone wall rising over them.
Sherlock fell back against the seat at the car started moving. Deprived of his sight, his other senses kicked in keener. Quick stops and starts soon morphed into long uninterrupted stretches of driving telling Sherlock they had left the city limits behind. The Bajorans in the front seat muttered quietly to themselves, and Sherlock could only catch a few phrases “border guard” was only one he heard clearly. He could feel that car was moving west toward the mountains as they traveled along the more uneven surface of country roads.
Sherlock led John through the front rooms back toward the kitchen. The parlors were the most opulent side of the house whereas the kitchen had a smaller, more homely scale to it. He should have directed John to come in by the back door he thought with a wince as John stopped briefly to admire a framed Turner on the wall.
“We need more data.” Sherlock shook his head. “Do we have this book here?”
“Any time.” John smiled wishing he’d had more to give. It was hard, what could he say? He missed Sherlock sometimes so much it hurt.
“Yeah, okay, no worries.” Dejected, John left the room to hang the pages on the doors to the stairwells.
“JOHN, for God’s sake, can you put the phone down, and just have dinner? Christ, I sound like my mother.” Harry dropped her head into her palm.
After Irene had promised to actually feed the fish and check on a few things, Sherlock and John were able to make their good-byes, escaping the vortex of manic energy that was Irene Adler.
They’d been standing, grinning stupidly at one other for several moments when Sherlock’s rational thought processes kicked back in.
“Bitch.” John said taking a pull from his bottle, and the two of them collapsed into giggles.
Bianca ushered them toward a door leading back to the main viewing hall. “I enjoyed seeing you today, but since we are short-staffed, I fear I must cut our tour a bit short. You can visit anywhere else in the open areas you like, and remember the leviathan viewings are four times a day on the half hour.”
“Where is Oscar?” Sherlock looked about for Felicia’s dog.
“Oh, GOD, stop, stop.”
John hadn’t had any more night terrors, not since the first one. He’d had trouble dropping off with Sherlock gone though, and he woke each morning feeling as if he'd hardly slept at all with a vague memory of strange dreams that left him unsettled.
“Erm, yeah, okay.” John smiled.
“Yeah, of course.” John shifted his weight awkwardly. “Listen, can you hang on a mo? I just want to check on my Mum, see if she’s still asleep.”
Sherlock had been so engrossed in his observations that he hadn’t noticed the newcomer until he'd taken the seat beside him.  The stranger had close-cropped hair, a tight black tee, and an earring with a skull dangling from one ear.
“You. Ex-army doctor. Invalided home. Working as a GP now, but you miss the excitement of field surgery. . .”
"What are you thinking?" John gasped when he was released from the kiss.
Sherlock laughed, a deep, rich sound John could feel down to his bones.
Something sparked in the corner of Sherlock’s eye. He turned to study it as more bursts of light followed.
Sherlock stared off into middle distance as if he were a million miles away. He blinked a few times before focusing on John again.
“Okay, alright.” John held up his palms in a calming gesture. “We can go, but is it safe to travel through Muggle space like that?”
“Um, yeah, it says dress robes. I’m sure we can scare up something from your cupboard." John smiled. "Thank you, Sherlock.”
“John, since I’ll have you there as my date, I’m sure I don’t need to worry about that.” Sherlock narrowed his eyes slightly.
Sherlock led them past a stately front entrance to a smaller door around the corner. John stumbled a bit following him inside. After the bright sunshine, John had only the vaguest sense of cloaks hung round the small coatroom, but a pleasant herbal, yeasty smell greeted his nose as his eyes adjusted. A bubble of laughter sounded from a room farther in, and Sherlock grinned.
‘I won’t go.’ The Little Hobbit shook his head and stood up, bringing himself to his tallest height, which next to a dragon was hardly anything at all. ‘I won’t leave you. Don’t you know, where you are is my home now.’ He flung himself against the dragon’s side and held on. In that instant, a shimmer of pure magic rippled over them, and he found himself embracing not a great beast, but a tall thin man with eyes like summer rain.
Sherlock almost ran the last few steps to John’s front door.  It was half-way open. Something prickled Sherlock’s spine as he pushed it further open to enter. The place was a shambles. Everything had been tossed over or ransacked. The lovely chairs Mrs. Watson had inherited from Holmes manor lay broken on the floor. Sherlock ripped off his veils, and tore through the tiny house. It was hopeless he knew it, but he searched for clues, for anything that would tell him what had happened. The food was gone, the pantry and cupboards stripped bare. He flung himself into John’s room.
“But what about Emile? I’m confused.” John tugged at his own collar as if it chafed him. With an exasperated sigh, he yanked open several buttons. Now it was Sherlock’s turn to stare at John’s bared chest. His skin was the lovely golden hue he remember so well from all his clandestine wanking sessions with the
“Thanks, John . . .” Sergeant Donovan looked grateful as John put an arm around her shoulder and squeezed.
“You’re welcome. Happy Birthday.”
Sherlock felt the last cognitive gear still spinning in his brain grind to a halt.  “You have?”
“Do we need a safeword?”
“Mummy probably had an assistant pick it out. It’s not really her style.” Sherlock lifted an eyebrow. “We have a few minutes before we need to wash though. Perhaps we might find something to do with our free time . . .” He trailed off as he lay back, stretching himself luxuriantly across the confetti-strewn sheets like a birthday gift waiting to be opened.
“Remember, I’m not made of gingerbread. The ‘no teeth’ rule is back in effect.”
“Hey.” John moved closer.
never paid them enough attention, did they?”
“Army doctor,” Sherlock corrected from across the room.
They each took a moment to gather their senses, then John cuddled up to Sherlock and whispered in his ear, “I love you.”
“Ah, glad to hear you DID eat occasionally.”  John took his dish to the sink, and busied himself making another cup of tea before returning to the table.
, James he’d been called. God, he’d been ex-military too, hadn’t he? Sherlock felt like throwing up. “But I thought you only did the solo videos.”
“Yes, let’s.” Sherlock said, shifting his feet on the slightly sticky floor. “I think I’ve had enough of FIRETOWN.” He threw his hands wide as he named the band.
Sadly Sherlock’s mind wasn’t on his work at all during class, and when his Vitamix potion caught fire and exploded in a puff of red smoke, Molly sent him a worried look amidst the laughter from the rest of the students. She sidled up to Sherlock during clean up to talk to him. “Something wrong, Sherlock? You don’t seem yourself today.”
“Despite its power being off, the phone undoubtedly contains a number of tracking and surveillance devices.
Sherlock thought he just might burst into flames from how beautifully John held him, all but devouring him, lips and teeth and tongues joining together in a dance that threatened to melt every last nerve in his body.
Sherlock kept his own puppy close “Heel, boy!” as he located and greeted the hostess.
They played several rounds, taking turns with being “it.” John couldn’t help zeroing in on Sherlock’s deep voice when it was his turn, as the man hopped about the pool evading capture. John decided then he’d have Sherlock or die trying. Sherlock dashed off into the deep end and John followed listening to the sound of Sherlock’s splashing to guide him. Finally, he had him cornered against the wall. John reached for him, the two of them laughing as Sherlock writhed like an eel. John moved to grab him about the waist, finding that his trunks had slipped again, and his hand encountered bare skin all the way down his flank to the smooth upper swell of his buttocks.
“To be honest, Irene. I’m not feeling well.”  Sherlock knelt beside the edge of the water.
“Ugh.” Sherlock mock shuddered.
“Heidelberg.” Sherlock filled in the blank. “I don’t have to be in Heidelberg until September.”
John cupped his cheek and kissed him. “I love you, too. But don’t think that means you’re getting out of giving me a foot massage.”
“Alright, fine, so you fucked things up. Tell him you’re sorry.” Harry crossed her arms over her chest.
“Yeh, guess we’d better get cracking to keep up with you two.” Dom smiled as he helped himself to scrambled egg.
“Then how ‘bout if I don’t make you wait until afterwards?”
“Oh . . . right. Yeah. God, I’m an idiot.”  John raked fingers back through his hair. “Look, I can go, leave you to it. I’m sorry. I . . .”
“Blackbeard.”
It was a simple thing, a press of lips, a breath of air, but it rocked Sherlock to his very core. Sherlock parted his lips, and John’s warm tongue sought entrance. Something electric crackled over him then as their tongues met and danced over each other. It was  . .  . amazing. He simply had no idea.
“Ah.” It occurred to John suddenly, and he wasn’t sure why it hadn’t hit him before, that Mycroft had lost his father at a very young age too. He might have been seven or so to Sherlock and John’s infancy at the Battle of Hogwarts, but he had grown up fatherless all the same. John felt such a wave of empathy for Mycroft wash over him just then.
Later, when Mrs. Watson was in the loo, Harry nudged John as they carried plates and leftovers back to the kitchen. “Come on Johnny, what say we get out of here, and have some real fun tonight?”
“John, I’ve lost it. You have to help me.” Sherlock’s eyes remained shadowed, dark beseeching pools.  “Help me, John.”
The kiss was sweet as summer sunshine. It went on and on, filling him up, burning all the shadows away.
Sherlock stood. The erection tenting his trousers might have been awkward if John hadn’t been suffering from the same state. He reached out to take John’s hand, pulling him gently around the table, down the hall to the stairs. As if in a dream, Sherlock led John slowly, inexorably toward his bedroom on the first level. They moved through the door, over carpet, toward the large four poster bed.
“Enough.” Sherlock shoved in front of the idiot. “Put that away now, soldier. There are children present.”  Thankfully, the man obeyed, however reluctantly, and reholstered his weapon.
“Steady on, mate.” Tom glanced over. He had a quill stuck behind each ear. “At least you’ve got that great brain of a boyfriend to help you.”
“Not too bad.” Sherlock hastened to not look so ill that his mother would feel the need to call a doctor in. “Just a bit sick. I don’t feel up to a party.”
John looked up to see Victor and Sherlock moving their way with drinks, heads and shoulders above much of the crowd, looking like a panther and a snow leopard parting the sheep.
“Good morning, boys.” Mr. Holmes beamed. “You looked like you two were having fun last night. I’d have thrown out my back dancing like that.”
“Christ, you won’t see stars like this in London,” John said with some reverence in his voice. “It’s beautiful, isn’t it?”
“Oh, good for you.” Claudette winked at John hardly looking ruffled at being caught out at all.
“ ‘Who is there, who dares disturb my rest?’ the dragon roared.
“Hey, let’s play a game,” John offered, clapping his hands together.
Sherlock gave a low chuckle. Again, he began the slow push/pull of the beads, now stimulating John’s prostate with each stroke. The sensation was a maddening tease. John grew impatient, and shoved his hips back against the largest bead, bearing down and sucking it in. He groaned at the sudden fullness and firm pressure against his prostate.
“Gang signs?” Lestrade asked, coming closer.
“Come on, eyes on the prize, Watson.” Teddy nudged him. “We don’t want the Slytherins getting top marks today do we?”
“My Aunt Debra. I was a ring bearer. I hardly remember it really. I was three at the time. All I know is it was blazing hot, middle of the summer at some garden. I seemed to have stripped down as soon as the ceremony was over. Someone caught me running toward a fountain completely starkers.”
“Oh, sweetheart.” John couldn’t bear not kissing Sherlock any longer, and climbed up to find his lips.
Sherlock flashed a slightly manic smile as he scooped his keys and wallet off the top of the dresser. In one fluid movement, he stepped to grab his long coat from the wardrobe, and swirl it over himself.
“I think the private residence of Gul Dukat will have sufficient security that we won’t have to fear for anyone’s safety tonight.”  Sherlock put on his most reassuring smile.
“Prophets, what are you wearing?” John murmured, his hands quickly finding their way under Sherlock’s draping sheet.
“I promise I’ll have an answer for you by tomorrow.” Sherlock nodded.
It was a large cylinder a bit taller than Sherlock, and seemed to be made of some kind of metal painted over in bright orange. When he rapped a knuckle against it, it rang hollow. Immediately Sherlock began to search over its surface.
“Sorry,” John called out, and moved to swim back to the far edge of the pool.
John grunted, and they sat quietly watching the waves and the birds darting across the sky in companionable silence for some time.
“No, better not.” John shook his head. “We’ll need it later.”
John smelled amazing, sweetly warm, and salty, sleepy like Saturday morning with nowhere to go. Sherlock groaned, burying his face against the damp strands of hair plastered to John’s nape, inhaling deeply. John roused as he nuzzled at him, kissing and licking over John’s neck in an instinctual need to groom and soothe.
“That’s all that was left, TEDDY. If you want it done better, you go get the supplies next time.”
“God, that was perfect, come here, come here.”
John pulled the ridiculous ruffled robe over his head with a sigh. Graduation required dress robes and John was attending graduation
“I know but if I hadn’t involved you . . .”
Sherlock smiled sadly. “I think there are a number of people who would disagree with you on that.”
John slaps Sherlock's bum as he stands.
Dearest readers, I sit in front of the Mirror of Erised watching kudos and comments coming my way. Help make it true before I waste away here! ^.~
The inconvenience of the night before, in fact the whole pain and suffering of the last several days had evaporated like mist in the dawn with John’s arrival. Sherlock was more than happy to let bygones be bygones.
John typed back.
Sherlock tensed up, looking ready for a fight when Mycroft returned, but John kicked his ankle lightly under the table, and Sherlock settled back into his seat.
.”  Sherlock fell back to the sofa with a huff. “Stupid, stupid . . .” he trailed off muttering, running a hand back through his hair.
“Mmmm, I’d love your hands on me. I’m going to pretend, this is you touching me.” Johnny ran one hand over his sweet little erection, while another remained to fondle his chest, rubbing and pinching harder at his nipples. A flush spread beautifully over his body, turning his golden skin peachy. It contrasted so nicely with the dark sheet under him that Sherlock was certain it had been selected specifically.
John decides a life back in London is the one for him after all.
“Well, that’s personal.” John winked, hefting his beer. “But I think Molly owes me my next drink.”
“Yes, thank you,” Sherlock muttered.
I miss you.
“Brilliant.” Sherlock turned to peel “Mr. Sherlock Holmes” up as well, turning the small sign over to find a similar etching behind it: 5, 48, 53.3, W. “So, we were looking for who you really are in a very literal sense.”
John reluctantly retrieved the dart board from the cabinet. It was large enough to cover his face and chest, but left the rest of him alarmingly exposed.
“Hi.” John hesitated a moment before moving to the kitchen. Sherlock watched as he found a glass, and filled it from the sink.  After emptying it with several long pulls, John left it on the counter, returning to the sitting area.
“In a moment. I do need to check a few things quickly on the net.”
“You have to wear this later, when we don’t have somewhere to go. I want to . . . unwrap you.”
“Me?”
“Oh, all right.” Sherlock huffed, caught out.
“Alright, yeah, what of it?” John looked nervous now.
“Okay.”
The bus took them farther away from the Cardassian areas that Sherlock knew, and deeper into the Bajoran sector that he didn’t. Sherlock all but pressed his nose to the window, peering through his veil as the brightly-coloured shops and eateries slid by. When John rang the bell, and the two of them alighted onto the pavement, the strangeness of the new neighborhood swept over Sherlock in a great rush.
“I’ll see you this afternoon.” John took a deliberate step back.
John felt a lump rising in his throat. He reached over to place a hand over Sherlock’s. Sherlock turned his palm up, and they held hands until Sherlock had to change gears as they slowed to enter the lot for the grocery. John grinned at the turned heads as they exited the Aston Martin. It wasn’t the usual thing you saw outside a shop in Eastbourne. They could have taken Old Bessie, but Sherlock knew how much of a thrill John got from watching him drive the sports car.
“Good.” John nodded.
They chatted a bit, exchanged details of the day when John sighed.
“You didn’t ruin anything, love,” John said stroking a hand down his back. “The greatest Wizard in our generation doesn’t need to spend his summer making copies for the likes of Nigel Beedles.”
“I’m assuming you need to get back?” Sherlock raised an eyebrow calmly.
Sherlock obligingly reached out and shut off the small bedside lamp. He settled down against the relaxed from of John again, allowing his steady breathing to lull him into his own peace, falling into a deeper sleep than he’d had in ages.
“John, it’s lovely having you over again.” Clara smiled as she passed the large bowl of spaghetti across the table. “I added mushrooms, just the way you like.”
"All right, John." Sherlock wouldn’t have thought he could actually fall asleep on the floor like this, but the evening had been exhausting, and he drifted off. When next he opened his eyes, thin morning light filtered in through the small window.
“Thanks.” John reached for it, only to draw back, surprised when he found the plate now covered with Cornettos arranged in a circle.
“Ah yes, the lovely Irene,” the prefect cut in. “I hope she’s improved. I so enjoyed talking with her over the weekend, delightful woman. I called to express my gratitude, but I also wanted to invite you to a gathering I’m having at my estate next week. You’ll come and bring the lovely Miss Adler with you?”
“Yeah. It was a great trip.”
Mrs. Hudson rose to her feet, looking flustered. “I could clean the tea things before I go . . .”
“I don’t know about intrigued. Some of that stuff scares the crap out of me.”
the time.”
“Yes, Dr. Watson, I think it needs extensive treatment,” Sherlock purred, a cheeky smile pulling at the side of his lips. “Loads of care.”
“Go! We’re fucking going.” John yelled in his ear already tugging Sherlock out of his seat as the frenzied crowd erupted onto their feet around them.
“So, you got a job in London recently?” John prompted.
“What are we . . .” John began.
“Muh roomie, he’s a bit of a prick, you know.”
It didn’t take much before Sherlock was spilling out about his last days on Bajor, the academy, his recent return, and the promotion . . . though he edited a good bit out.
John adjusted himself slightly before opening the door. Mike was indeed standing in the hallway, smiling, holding a notebook.
This wasn’t anything new. Sherlock had certainly done this before, gone down on his knees for hard, hungry men, probably even in this same alleyway. Somehow though, it had never been quite like this before. Every sound that John made, every twitch of his fingers in Sherlock’s hair was like fuel tossed on the fire burning through his core. He wanted John to take his pleasure from him, to feel every swirl of his tongue, every ounce of his emotions as he hollowed his cheeks and pulled along his length.
“Ta.” John pulled the chunk off the end of the knife and popped it into his mouth. A tangy, sweet explosion greeted him as he bit into the resisting wax. It wasn’t the straight sweetness he was expecting . . . it was complicated.  “Mmmm, God that’s delicious.”
Sherlock and John giggled as Mrs. Watson raised an eyebrow at them. “Very funny,” she said. “Harry, be a dear and get the ginger beer from the cupboard, please.”
His alarm clicked to life.  Blue eyes popped open, soft for just a heartbeat, before sense seeped in and they grew sharp, almost accusatory.
“I’m . . . I mean . . .” Sherlock stammered completely unsure what to say now that John had told him that most Muggles hated homosexuals.
“I never joke about dancing.”
“The jars are all six pounds,” his vision said. “Would you like to taste that one?”
“Yeah, no worries.” John quirked a smile reaching for a ham sandwich. “It was a stupid trick, but no harm done.”
“Yes, certainly.” Sherlock nodded.
“My old therapist kept suggesting I take a trip to the shore, and I kept shrugging her off. If only she’d known all I needed was to be kidnapped, spend a season in a dystopian prison, and meet a gorgeous genius to spend a day at the beach. Easy peasy.”
“God, it feels like forever since we first started out here, doesn’t it?”
before, and had never told him? They’d be having words later.
“John, no . . . no.” Sherlock pulled back slightly to kiss the wet off John’s face, making a game of peppering over him with little smooches until John laughed, a half-broken sound that was better than the noises he had been making.
“Okay you two, let’s off to bed, it’s late.” Mrs. Watson shooed them from the kitchen when they were finished eating. “Sherlock I tried calling your house, but the landlines are down. We’ll try again in the morning.”
Sherlock missed sleeping every night curled around John. One of his roommates had definitely snitched, informing the Head of Ravenclaw that John was sneaking in to his bed fully half of the week. As the four idiots who shared his dorm room looked equally guilty, Sherlock presumed it had been a group effort to out them. It was lucky he was one of Professor Mobius’ favourite students. The punishment had been nearly non-existent. He and John had merely had to clean the teacher’s chalkboard by hand for a week, but the door to Ravenclaw had been spelled not to admit John into the dorm again. Professor Mobius had been surprisingly kind about the whole thing, but firm. No boyfriends in your bed at school.
The dancer whirled back to his feet and leapt toward the front of the room, finally giving a good view of his face, and John nearly choked.
Sherlock moaned softly, rutting against him, setting up a messy rhythm.
John looked simply edible. His pale hair flipped back fetchingly from his face, while his dark button up shirt hung open at the neck, several beaded necklaces swinging across his chest.
“So what if it’s weird? It might be a clue of some sort. Do you mind if I continue?”
“It might be a relationship of the past,” Sherlock said, waving a hand. “So hard to track women  down, you know, always changing their last names. Still, no matter. If you could give me some contact information so that I might alert her to her inheritance? It is a sizeable sum, and I’m certain she’d want to know.”
“John, neither of us bake, I fail to see the appeal . . .”
“All right ya sorry sods. Quidditch practice after dinner tomorrow.” Teddy glanced toward the dark dorm windows and the Quidditch pitch somewhere beyond. “Let’s see what everyone’s forgotten over the summer.”
Sherlock moved, and John leaned off the bed to grab a bottle. He returned to squirt something slippery over his hand.
“What?” Sherlock asked around the hot mouthful.
“You’re not losing your touch? Huh, John?” Thomas grinned. “What, is she blind?”
John continues to temp Sherlock away from his duties, a temptation of the very best kind, though he'll be damned if he'll admit it.
“Yeh, sure. It won’t move like a Wizard photo though,” John warned.
After making their way through a few more personnel and scheduling issues, the group finally reached the end of things. John rang the chime that signaled the close of the meeting. Chairs scraped across the floor as people rose, the burble of conversation drifting past as they dispersed.
“How was the play?” John asked.
“Me . . .” Sherlock managed before John pulled him into a kiss that worked quite as well as an
“Oh God. It’s okay.” Harry pushed a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “You took enough shit from Dad as it was. It probably would have killed him sooner to have a queer son.”
Someone else entered the cell as Sherlock leveraged John to sitting. Sherlock tensed, ready to fight, but the newcomer hailed him jovially in Bajoran.
He licked his lisp when Sherlock wiped his mouth and fingers fastidiously on his napkin.
Talk turned to some dungeons and dragons podcast everyone was following. John only listened with half an ear as he and Sherlock kept sharing smiles, fingers still entwined as Sherlock stroked his thumb over the back of John’s hand. Just that simple touch was enough to send a ripple of heat through him.
It had become something of a weekly tradition, their card game on Third night. Instead of betting money though, they’d taken to wagering small items they had on hand. Sherlock laughed and shook his head. Furel was a generous soul, but his ability to bluff at cards was abysmal.
“Yes, of course.” She smiled.
The return trip was much easier than the first time they made their way through the maze like warehouse in the dark. As it turned out the light switch for the massive space was located in their new living quarters, so it was a simple matter to walk between the storage units of food without having to hold hands to prevent losing each other. Of course the fact that they didn’t need to hold hands didn’t stop them from doing exactly that.
“There will be NO fighting.” Sherlock insisted. “If any fighting goes down, we will draw attention to our taking a soil reclaimator, and attention is the LAST thing we need
Owen looked up at his approach. “Johnny, my good man.  How goes?”
John backed away, feeling his cheeks on fire, and moved to find Sherlock in the small aisles, sorting through the rows of allergy medications.
“Sherlock!”
“John, the civilians . . .”
“Well, yeah, but Christ, it was IN me. It’s not like I wanted to just leave it lying about . . . after.”
“Come on, let’s talk somewhere more private.”
“Yes, I guess you’re right.” Sherlock nodded. Of course he knew all about the bombing of the vehicle maintenance facility three days ago. It was all over the newsfeeds.
“It cost me a pretty stack of leks.  I wasn’t about to let it go,” she clucked.  “Now, how have you been sneaking out of your house, Sherlock Holmes?”
“Kate, how are you?”
“I’m sorry, Vic. We didn’t mean to keep it a secret. It’s just Teddy and Owen both have jobs lined up at the Ministry of Magic, Tom and Dom have their dad’s shop to return to, and I’m off to St. Mungo’s in the autumn. This summer is our last chance for a big trip together. We can knock about, see the sights, have some fun before all the next stuff happens.”
Someone was already snoring.
“Are you two getting married?” Olivia asked, eyes wide. “Mum says it’s legal now. Two men or two women getting married.”
“Oh, yes.”
John must have made a sound because Sherlock turned to look his way. He smiled as he reached out to take John’s hand, and the odd sensation passed with the familiar press of their palms together.
“You know where John’s mother is.” Sherlock felt a shiver roll up his spine.
“I trust this light isn’t enough to bother you?” A sneer lifted the corner of his lips.
“Ta, Mycroft.” John took the magnifiers with a grateful nod. He placed them to his eyes, and whispered “Find me Sherlock.” The magic lenses zoomed right in on the Ravenclaw moving in to take his own place on the rows of chairs before the stage. As if he could feel John’s eyes, Sherlock turned and ran his gaze over the stands. John waved wildly, feeling a bit silly, but the smile that broke across Sherlock’s face as he found John was ample reward. Sherlock lifted a hand briefly in reply.
“Ro Anton.”
The club they were off to ended up being farther away than expected, and it took many debated twists and turns before they arrived. As Harry promised, they were waved in without needing any ID. Soon enough, they joined the crowd inside jostling under the coloured lights and loud music. The place was called "The Stoplight,” and featured a number of traffic lights flashing around the walls in some quirky décor theme.
In the bedroom, John stripped off Sherlock’s clothes, then his own. “It’s time for another game,” he said.
“Hello,” the man said mildly, looking over his reading glasses. He was a compact sort of fellow with short, sandy hair, someone who had lived a bit, leaving a softness to his face that creased as he smiled at Sherlock.
John snorted. “That can’t possibly be true.”
Alastaire chanced a quick glance over his shoulder, and no more, but it was clear he’d gotten the message.  He streaked toward the ground with the mad ball, and the Gryffindor Beaters right behind him. The green of the field rushed toward them at an alarming speed, but at the last moment, the three Quidditch players pulled up. The unwitting ball kept going, slamming into the turf. In but a moment, it wrenched itself free from the ground to continue its grim chase. John and Victoire swung in, on it in an instant as the ball zoomed back up.
“Thanks,” John said, rubbing his damp hands down his thighs. “I appreciate that.”
“Adjunct operative with MI6,” Sherlock said, popping a panel in the car to extract a cold bottle of water that he handed to John. “This was a one-off mission. I did tell you when we first met.”
“Sherlock, fuck, SHERLOCK! Hang on. The medics are coming.”  A sob bubbled up from John’s throat and he clasped a hand soaked in violet over his mouth. Blood. Cardassian blood.
“John, close your mouth”
Heartfelt groans echoed around the table.
“Gods, bleeding Gods. I’m sorry . . . I . . ” Sherlock was cut off as two Cardassian guards on patrol turned the corner and spotted them.
“Aaaaah.” The sound rumbled pleasingly from the back of Sherlock’s throat. “Why yes, Dr. Watson, I do believe that IS all for you. If you can handle it, that is.”
“But you are ashamed to be seen as homosexual.” Sherlock turned pale eyes filled with a world of hurt his way. “It matters to you what people think, people who know you professionally.”
“John, I wanted to let you know that I heard back from St. Mungo’s about the healer training scholarship.” Lestrade steepled his hands before him on the desk.
“I’d assumed you were a doctor working here when I saw your name.” The side of Sherlock’s mouth tipped up wryly as they both glanced at “Dr. John Watson.”
Sherlock humphed in reply.
“What?” John nearly dropped his wine. He set it quickly down on the table.
They lay, just breathing, feeling the pump of their heartbeats slowing, almost gliding into synch. Finally, John moved to grab a box of wipes to clean them up.
“Yes,” Sherlock agreed, slotting himself closer.
And, in the words of Lao Tzu:
“John, it’s good to see you. You look well.” Sherlock’s face had gone smooth and composed, though his eyes remained active, darting back and forth over John’s face.
They found an alcove with the number “12” affixed over it easily enough. They were the only passengers waiting besides a mustached man with a deep accent.  He greeted them awkwardly in English, but when Sherlock answered him in French, the two were soon babbling away together. John decided it was as good as any time to try the language spell he’d been working on. Muttering a few words, he swished his wand beside his head.
“Yes. Yes, rings, a wedding, yes.” Sherlock nodded so fast he made himself dizzy.
Through sheer determination, John’s mum chivvied them into feeling normal again, finding Sherlock some spare pyjamas, and filling the kitchen with lit candles, and the rich smell of steeping Jumja tea.
John turned so that he could face Sherlock. He reached up to lay a palm along his check. “Oh, you beautiful man,” he whispered. “If only you could truly be mine.”
“That’s right . . .”
“Yes,” Sherlock said, pulling him in to a tight embrace, his lips seeking out the soft skin under John’s jaw.
The space wasn’t nearly as intimidating when they could see it, just a rectangular room with a number of waist-high walls bisecting it. It was easy to move about the maze guided by the light from the computer screen. John could still detect the faint sour odor of piss from when they’d been forced to make a makeshift toilet in a side of the room, but thankfully it had dissipated in the intervening months.
“John, he’s fifty-five and married with children.” Sherlock snorted.
“God, no, it’s perfect.” John moved closer to slide his hands around Sherlock’s waist. “I just don’t want to go out now.”
One request please. While I adore encouragement, I absolutely freeze up at comments like "I NEED MOAR" and "when is the next update?" These sorts of comments make me never want to write again, and take up a quieter hobby like quilting, or gardening, or juggling.  I'm sure people mean well, but please, don't. Thanks!
“But there are no hobbits for miles and miles from here. Few people have even seen a hobbit, they never leave their shire. I felt certain no one would be able to read . . .”
“See ya later, John.” Mike nodded as he passed.
“I’m not
“Good night, Love,” John murmured.
“Old like a skeleton,” John said.
“John.”
With a slightly surprised look, Mycroft accepted John’s hand, clasping it firmly for a quick pump. “You as well, Dr. Watson. I hope you’ll consider what I said, though . . .”
Many thanks to the nonny on Tumblr who gave me the prompt of docking/foreskin play for this next chapter. Since this was a new thing for me, I did some online research, like you do. I felt Sherlock who learned to fold Sydney Opera House serviettes from YouTube would have approved. Hope you enjoy! ;)
Sherlock raised his eyebrows dramatically.
“It’s easier to just do the magic.”  Sherlock shrugged.
“Of course I will.”
“My dog, John, I have to find it.”
“Shit, I forgot to call my sister. Do you mind?” John motioned to the phone.
After piling some plates with food, Claudette and Sherlock herded John away from the group back to the chairs in the herb garden. John and Sherlock settled side by side on the chaise lounge he’d been spread over earlier as Claudette slid into the chair beside it.
Teddy shook his head slightly so John moved to stand by their potion.  Joanne joined her cauldron with a pleased smile, and a Slytherin, Rhys Winters stepped up to claim the third.
Dropping his flowers John moved closer and found a rectangular protuberance about the size of a large walk in cupboard extending from the side of the building. This section did not correspond to any part of the building on the inside, or anything on the blueprints.
A stronger wind whipped over them and John shivered. “Let’s head back.”
“Alright, let’s have one.” John nodded, feeling up for just about anything.
A fortnight of dragging along was finally punctuated by the  first Quidditch game of the season. Gryffindor had the Slytherin team as their first opponents, and everyone felt on edge, hoping for an early win. Teddy gathered the team in the locker room for a last-minute motivational yell. John sat next to Owen on a bench watching him rub at a rune stone he kept in his pocket for games. “Good luck, good luck.” He muttered under his breath.  “What, it can’t hurt,” Owen said when he caught John watching.
“Ow, Get off Harry! I’m not done yet.”
“No, we agreed,” Kira said. “We need food for the Resistance first.”
“Oh, you know, eat nibbles, drink too much booze, mingle with people.”
Sherlock made polite noises and allowed the conversation to flow around him.
“Good morning.”
“That was Mummy.” Sherlock bent over, balancing on one foot, to tug on a shoe that didn’t quite want to admit his foot.
“Irene, I don’t think . . .” Sherlock began.
When it was done, John moved to poke his head out the back door, but Sherlock was already there, coming back inside.
Things settled as they sat down to dinner, dishing up all of John’s favorites, and a bottle of white from the wine cellar.
“I beg your pardon,” Sherlock said, surprised. “I seem to have the wrong room.”
“Hmmm?”
John was a bit disappointed to find the usual crowd around the table at dinner, but no Sherlock. Gwen and her friend Anne seemed to have joined the group permanently, and Bill had added in a bloke called Collin, but no tall, posh mad scientists were to be found. John dug into his chicken casserole with a sigh. Everyone had agreed that a night out was just the ticket, and they debated on which spot to pick.
“I’m no one’s lab rat.” John shook his head.
John couldn’t stand it another minute. He moved his arm under Sherlock, gone pins and needles, and rolled the man closer onto his chest. He wrapped both arms around him, leaned his cheek against the top of those dark curls, and breathed in lingering traces of tropical flowers and the sleepy scent of Sherlock. Oh . . . God. They fit perfectly. John blew out a breath of relief at finally getting to hold him like he wanted to.
“Sorry, that’s long gone,” John said. “You’re going to have branch out a bit, try some new things.”
“Ugly as a benno dog.”
“Yes, congratulations.” Sherlock chanced a smile.
“Unique, hmmm?” John smiled in reply.
“It’s not that far, let’s just walk it,” John said after seeing the line at the transit stop.
“Yes . . . Fine . . . Of course . . . Oh . . I’m sorry to hear that.”
They made love, simply, slowly, swapping kisses, and sliding hands until a shuddering orgasm rolled over each of them once again.
“Oh, it sounds absolutely DELIGHTFUL.” Sherlock waved a hand about in the air, bringing it to rest on a canted hip, “but plans are still a bit up in the air, you know. John will have to let you know.” He shot John a positively besotted look.
“No, really. I don’t want to trouble her. It’s her birthday celebration,”  John said. “Just let it go.”
John wanted to sink into the ground, be swallowed up by the cool dark earth, burrow his way down into the roots and rocks, and curl up like a little seed.
Sherlock’s mouth pressed into a wobbly line, trying to make up his mind if John were teasing him or not.
“I’m here,” Sherlock agreed, keeping his hands firmly wrapped around John’s waist.
“Okay, then. What else might fall under your brother’s definition of ‘clever’? Some of the other codes were related to the doors they unlocked: the nursery rhymes about food to enter the pantry,
Sherlock caught John’s eye and they burst into sniggers hastily muffled behind their hands.
“John.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow. “It’s just luggage.”
“Arithmancy.” John said more firmly stepping back as he grabbed Sherlock’s upper arms to keep him at bay.
“I’m not sure how you can stand it, John, sleeping with one of them.” Lupaza scowled. "And a traitor at that. Fucking spoonhead."
“Thank you, so much.” Sherlock took a large gulp of cold water as he watched John settling into a nearby chair with a glass holding something darker. “Thank you also for agreeing to meet with me.”
John’s mum had driven them into London that morning and dropped them off at a tube stop. Sherlock had been bursting with curiosity about the train system, and John had promised to give him a tour.  After quick hugs, and an apology again about how things at the office had gone, John’s mum had waved good-bye as they descended into the station.
“What would you have me do? Stage a coup over the High Council itself?  The odd are low for any reasonable rate of success.”
“Aw, Sweetheart.” John tightened his arm around Sherlock’s waist.
John snorted.
“Oh, shut it.” John sighed.
Somehow the boys made it to John’s house without incident. Sherlock managed to fix his half-torn veils well-enough to cover his face. He followed John from the temple with his head ducked as the shorter boy led the way through the maze of passages that made up the old quarter.
“It’s not that hard. Anyone can pick up the basics.” Sherlock shrugged.
“Sherlock had highest marks in general chemistry last year,” Molly piped up. “He’s in this class.”
Sherlock went to a dull soiree in honour of the junior cadets without a complaint the next weekend he was allowed out, even agreeing to put pomade in his hair. He was relieved beyond measure though to find Molly there as well. His façade of perfect manners only stretched so far. He ended up pouring out his whole sad, sordid tale to her while she fetched him cups of punch and patted his hand.
“Keep talking, I’ll follow your voice.” John reached out with his hands.
John would be back at school by Sherlock’s birthday proper, so they’d made one day serve as a stand-in birthday before he left. John had sneaked out early to buy tea and pastries at Bertha’s and woken Sherlock with breakfast in bed. They’d spent the whole day doing whatever took Sherlock’s fancy, having ice creams for lunch, and spending the afternoon in the Museum of Magic before washing up at an American-style restaurant that sold hamburgers and chips in gravy for dinner. John had given him some small gifts, silly things he’d picked up in shops over the week, some scented soaps, a wooden frog with a bobble head, a bag of toffees that let you whistle like a bird after you’d eaten them. Tomorrow morning, John had to catch a portkey back to London, and the two of them felt completely unprepared.
“Also freust du dich nicht mich wieder zu sehen. Wie schmerzhaft.” – Not so pleased to see me then. I’m hurt.
“Oh?” John slung his bag into the back before climbing into the front seat.
“Oh, ta.”
. He was breaking up, falling apart . . .
Harry snorted out a sudden giggle.
John sighed, and tried to concentrate on the words the professor was scribbling across the board.
“And your guest, sir?” She raised an eyebrow toward John.
“Oh, well, that’s not right. Let me just check my computer.” After a few moments, the woman returned. “That’s strange I see a ticket filled out for that request, but it was marked as completed.”
“Of course. That guy wasn’t serious though, you know. You were the one he really wanted to go after. Lupaza was smokescreen.”
~~@~~
“Come on, love. You hardly ate a thing yesterday.”
“Fuck. So’s drinking yourself blind, stupid drunk, and nearly every Westerner in Kabul manages that any night of the week.” John leaned closer, his eyes dark and wanting. “Come home with me, William.”
“I’m sorry, I know it isn’t much, not what you’re used to . . .” John looked about the room, waving a hand, embarrassed.
“John, here.” Sherlock handed him a wad of folded bills. “And this is the information I told you about yesterday, the times, the maps.” He passed John a small envelope. He’d copied all of the information out carefully by hand from the data cube, crushing it in a garbage compactor after. You never knew what sort of tracers might be on it.
“What the hell? I’m coming with you then.” John looked so brave, Sherlock almost faltered.
Felicia’s smile turned down slightly at the edges as she straightened. “He’s being punished. He was a naughty boy earlier today. I’ll let him out later. ” She gestured across the room, and Sherlock peered through the moving crowd to see that Oscar was indeed inside a small cage in a far corner, a muzzle strapped over his face. He’d slumped dejectedly to the floor watching the party progressing without him. He was a gorgeous specimen, and Sherlock could see his shock of light blonde hair and icy blue eyes from across the room.
“What? What are you on about, man?” Owen squinted at him over his glass.
“Already a chemist, hmmm?”
“Mmmm.” Sherlock returned the smile. He felt stiff after sleeping on such a thin mattress, and he stretched, enjoying how it brought him in greater contact with John.
Sherlock still smelled a bit like an ashtray, and he still felt too thin, but holding him was like coming home. They hung on to each other with eyes closed, until John’s mouth found Sherlock’s and then they did their best to near consume each other for the next few minutes.
“If he kisses you again, I’ll have to send him a hex through the mail.” Sherlock held the door open for John to follow him inside.
John didn’t need much more of an invitation. He dove in, swallowing Sherlock’s length down, holding what he couldn’t reach in his fist. John sucked and hummed, pumping his hand up to meet his bobbing lips, and Sherlock sang an aria of groans and deliciously cut-off noises.
“Irene’s  . . . she’s no longer part of the picture. It’s time for plan B, I need a place to take them, somewhere safe . . .”
After a time out of time, they finally drew apart just enough to catch their breath, arms still wrapped around each other.
“Oh, no, that’s sounds fine. I’m sure Daddy can use his GPS to find something.”
“Well, now I’ve talked your ear off with my ramblings. I’ve probably bored you stiff.”
“Mols. Thank you. For everything. I don’t know when I’ll see you again. I’m going to have to go underground.”
“May the Prophets bless you.” John clutched at his arm. He looked like he wanted to do more, but the burly guards at the front of the car watching them seemed impatient to go.
“You helped as well, John.” Sherlock grinned. “Still, we can’t rest on our laurels. We’ve yet to put it to practical use.”
“Do you want some?” he asked the dragon politely before he tore into the feast before him.
12. Dance Dance Dance
Sherlock had given the contents of the other cabinets a cursory inspection a couple of days ago, but now, with John by his side, he was ready to examine them more closely. In his emotionally compromised state, he had paid little attention to the television or DVDs. He was chagrined to realise that there was actually a complete entertainment centre, including a large collection of CDs, as well.
“Feeding the fish? Is that what they call it in the UK?” the young Witch laughed.
John found a blanket that didn’t smell too awful, and he tucked it around them pulling Sherlock close, wrapping them together.
They resumed their reading of The Hobbit after eating, John taking the lion’s share that day. When they got to the part with Smaug, the dragon, Sherlock snorted.
“Yes, yes,” John mumbled ripping off his shoes and clothes as fast as he was able.
It would do him a world of good to get out in the sun a bit more often.
“Fantastic. And that’s the honey inside there?” John moved a bit closer to squint at the sheet of beeswax. He flinched as a few bees moved his direction, but they merely landed on the hand wrapped around his cane for a moment as if sniffing him out before flying away.
“Is this him, then?” The passenger asked, a man with a burn scar marring his forehead. “The one we’re taking?”
John sighed, and opened a paper he needed to work on, and thankfully the awkward moment passed. Finally as the clock ticked deeper into the night, John yawned, and closed his laptop with a snap. He put things away on his desk, and grabbed his bathroom kit to go brush his teeth and get ready for bed. When he returned, Sherlock hadn’t moved from his desk. John cleared his throat.
“I may be the most observant man in Britain, but even I can’t see through fabric.”
They piled into Harry’s small car, waving to a slightly worried Mrs. Watson who watched from the door as they backed out.  Harry’s car made some odd grinding noises until she got it into gear, but then it seemed to be functioning well enough.
“I’m hurt.” Mycroft took a seat next to him with elegant poise. “Can’t I simply want to see my baby brother?”
“God, I didn’t want to like it, and then it went all sweet.” John sighed. “Is that all of it?”
“Good morning. Coffee?” Victor spared him a quick glance before giving something a quick stir.
“Because,” Mycroft swung his penetrating gaze upward, “we need a substantial victory on our side or the high command is going to wonder why the Imperial Army and the Obsidian Order are failing so spectacularly to keep Bajor secure.”
John started on the buttons on Sherlock’s shirt, his tongue between his teeth, until Sherlock batted his hands away to disrobe faster. John pulled his own things off, desperate to be against him, now, right now. Stripped bare, they came together, John stepping into Sherlock’s outstretched arms. He ran his hands almost reverently up and down Sherlock’s flank, feeling the light hair over warm, soft flesh, gripping a handful of that arse that never stopped enchanting him. John pressed his nose against the wall of chest before him, inhaled deeply, enveloped in all things Sherlock, as the man hugged him tightly. John moved, snuffling over to find a small puckered nipple, and he licked over it, once, twice. Sherlock groaned deeply. John grinned, pleased with himself.
“We’re going live in one minute.” Naavi grinned at Sherlock from his seat at the console. “If nothing cocks up that is.”
When the manager appeared, Sherlock passed him a very professional-looking business card on heavy stock that proclaimed him as a private investigator.
“Oh, don’t sell yourself short, soldier. It’s vital what you do here. An army crawls on its belly, and survives by its security.”
“What’s the score?” Teddy asked somewhat breathlessly.
“Look at that bedhead. I should wake up with you more often.” John pushed away the hair that flopped into Sherlock’s face, following it with a soft kiss to his forehead.
“I was wondering, if you might like to go for a walk some time? Down by the city gardens?”
“God, I lost track of time. I’m sorry I forgot to call. It was late . . . so I just stayed over.”
“I want you to tie me up again, but hold me down, take me from behind. A little rough.”
“Oh, fuck, yes!” John reached out, burying his fingers in a soft mass of curls as Sherlock’s mouth worked over him.
“Did you finish checking the main hub?”  Sherlock reached them in a few brisk steps.
They located clothes strewn across the floor, pulling on enough to be decent, and after a quick trip to the bathroom, found Victor setting platters of food to the glass and chrome table in the kitchen. The good smells wreathing the room had John almost whimpering as his neglected stomach grumbled to life.
“Lovely,” John breathed watching them twist away now that his fright was over. By mutual consent they took off swimming in the clear water, following the school of brightly flashing fish until they went too deep and they had to return to the shallows.
“No, it’s safe.” John carded his fingers through Sherlock’s hair, smoothing it back over and over. Sherlock almost purred at the wonderful feel of John’s fingertips over his scalp.
It was hard on Sherlock watching John and his mother drive off the next morning, leaving him alone at the townhouse. John lingered in the foyer saying goodbye while his mum started the engine outside.
