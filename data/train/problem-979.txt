But he came back after almost a year. He looked good. Happy, even. He took me out for coffee, just us old friends. We talked. I asked him how he was doing. What had happened to him to shine like he did. He didn't want to say it at first, but after I pushed him, he said that I earned to know the truth, that I deserved it. Thanks to me he got clean, got his life back on track, and he finally told me that he had met someone. That he had fallen in love. And that he was going to do everything in his power to keep this person in his life. That was about four years ago. He kept his promise, and I only saw him using a couple of times since then. But he never felled back into the destructive lifestyle he had lived for years. Because there was someone for him to live for now. He whined the last time he shot himself up. Telling me that he was so scared that you would find out and leave him. I told him that the only way to prevent that from happening, was to stop doing it then. And I know he did. A day before his so called suicide, he came to me, asking for help. He told me he was about to break the heart of the man he loved to save his life, and he needed the homeless network to help him out. So we did. He came to see me when he raised from the grave, to thank me again for my help, and to tell me he was back again, and that you had given him the black eye. Which you had all the right to do, if you asked me. He was here two weeks ago, asking if we wanted to look out for three men, but came back last week to tell us that he narrowed it down to two. I didn't speak with him anymore afterwards. But I can assure you, John, he's not shooting up. He would have come to me to do it, because he doesn't trust anyone else to look after him when he does, and I would have done everything in my power to prevent that from happening."
John turned onto his side, trying to think about something else and ignore the awoken lonely butterfly fluttering in his stomach again. He had ended that chapter, closed that book. He just couldn't feel like that anymore. It was too much.
"Yes. We didn't really get into a fight. I... I kissed him, and he ran off. I really thought he was angry with me."
John had ended the phone call with Esmeralda and assuring her he would inform Gerald. Then he had made tea for Sherlock and himself, putting a cup next to Sherlock's elbow, (replacing the full cold mug that was standing there) and then he sat down in his chair with his novel, which he wasn't reading. The fire was burning and the rain was ticking against the window. It was comfortable inside, If you could ignore the dark cloud hanging above Sherlock's head. His mind wandered off again. Thinking about how to fill his night now he wasn't going to draw. Maybe he should give Greg a call, seeing if the man had any time for a pint in the pub tonight. "You can draw something at home, you know." Sherlock said, breaking the silence.
I woke up in a military hospital miles away three days later. The whole village had been destroyed, as was most of our camp and our hospital. I managed to get in touch with my sister a day after that. She was drunk, called me names and told me that it was unforgivable that I managed to miss my parents funeral, for what reason whatsoever. She said she hated me, that she never wanted to see me again, and angrily she hang up the phone.
"Yes you bloody did. God. You have no idea how many times I had to control myself not to snog you senseless, to just go for it and see where it would take us. But you stated you were not interested in such a thing. And I really didn't want to lose what we had."
The next page was an image of a heart. Sherlock could see where it had been cut to investigate before it went down on this piece of paper. When he turned the page he looked into the face of a younger (and skinnier) Mike Stamford. Sherlock smiled at the sight. Even though he didn't know the man back then, he knew the picture was very accurate. This sketchbook was full with drawings of body parts, muscles, bones, and portraits of his classmates and friends. This sketchbook was full until the end. As was the next, and the next. Sherlock looked down at the now empty box next to him and was a little disappointed that there were no other drawings left. With the last sketchbook still in his hands he thought about it. His thoughts went back to the last picture John seemed to have drawn. How was it possible to give a piece of paper so much emotion? How did John manage to put it on paper, to even make Sherlock get moved by it, just thinking about the loss in that last picture? It made him feel uncomfortable. And how could John have hidden this skill from him? It seemed like the man had drawn for the most part of his life, and quite good actually. But he had stopped after the saddest drawing of all. Sherlock stood up to search the rest of his room, looking for scribbles or pencils but he didn't find any. So John really didn't draw anymore. But why? It seemed like a favourite past time for a lot of people, and it would definitely beat the stupid novels he was reading now almost every night when they were at home and he wasn't working on his blog.
He pulled that one with him too and slammed the door open. Suddenly he was standing still on the pavement in front of the pub. Where had he gone?
Instead of going straight to the cafeteria, Sherlock walked towards the door heading outside. With any luck there were some smokers in the class, and that way they could both cover as much suspects as possible. When he opened the door he saw three people standing around a big bin that was used as an ashtray. The rain had finally stopped and even the wind was slightly less than over an hour ago, and Sherlock stepped outside.
"Aren't we all? But no. With that brain activity they could be just as well be goldfish, pretty. They're all just subjects now. I can't see them as humans anymore. They are way beyond that state."
At that time Sherlock had decided to step out of the door and join the chilly classroom. He was wearing tight jeans. Sherlock was wearing tight jeans. Only tight jeans.
Sherlock looked at his phone. It was almost three forty in the morning. He looked at his roommate slumped in the chair and a tiny smile played his lips for a second, gone before Ava was sure she had seen it.
Sherlock bumped against his shoulder to let him know that he was ready to leave, and together they walked towards the exit. Sherlock was talking to him, but John didn't listen. His mind was too occupied with the feeling of creating something again. He couldn't wait until it was Thursday, the fact that they were here   working a case for a moment forgotten.
"Yes. She's strapped in the back. She was the last one to turn before you showed up. No conversation skills, that one. She does moan a lot."
"I feel as if I'm on a cloud. As if my heart is to big to fit in my chest. And I have butterflies in my stomach."
It was true. It was something he had never said to anyone, ever. And now he said it. He even said it to a attractive woman who was definitely interested in him. Yes, it was an act, he was supposed to act as Gerald's boyfriend. It was not real. But it was.
"It all happened in such a short period of time. There was a man in the village, where we used to go for our shopping and just to hang out and interact with the villagers. You know, playing football, rugby, that sort of thing. We helped them if we could. There was a man that had a market stall and sold herbs and spices. I used to go to him and trade food for his spices. His name was Sadeq. His grandson Ahmed was helping him, and he spoke a little bit English. One day, the old man was working on the roof of his house, and cut himself pretty badly in his hand. Ahmed knew I was a doctor in the camp, so he came looking for me there. Of course I went with him to help his grandfather. I stitched him up and gave him medications. Antibiotics, painkillers, things like that. After that, we spend a lot of time together. He reminded me so much of my own father. We couldn't communicate, but with a bit of creativity we managed to understand each other when Ahmed wasn't there. It was as if Sadeq could see beyond the soldiers outfit. We connected, and we both felt it. I went by his house at least once a week, but if I had the opportunity twice or more, helping him and his family. He lost his wife years before, and he took care of his sick daughter. Her husband was taken by the Taliban, and they didn't know what had become of him. His daughter had a stroke the year before, making her invalid. Sadeq lived with her and her son in their little house. I helped out where I could. Not only with medical treatments, but also with food and I helped out fixing the house. One day, after almost four months of me helping them, he showed me his drawings, and he had asked his grandson to act as a interpreter. He then asked me if he could draw me. I said yes. He made a beautiful piece of art of me, if you can imagine that. It was breath taking. So, a few days later, I decided to return the favour. I drew him. A portrait. When he saw it, he cried. He took the sketchbook out of my hands and looked at all the pictures I made there. He was so happy to find someone with the same interests. I gave him more than half of my pencils, and he was so grateful for it. His grandson translated for us again. He told me that I was a good man. That he had known it from the start, but he now had seen my soul when he looked at my sketchbook. He told me that I had a beautiful soul, and that I was a gift of Allah. He called me the golden angel.
"But I am, and knowing that you'll be sitting here doing god knows what is distracting. So you need to go with John. Go and enjoy the rest of your evening. Drink one on me, okay?"
"Almost no brain activity, Non-communicative, Unemotional and the most disturbing of all, contagious. They seemed to have developed an taste for human flesh. And when they bite, they spread the virus."
He was thankful that Sherlock had given him something back. Something he thought he would never have again, even though Sherlock had no idea that he did something like that. That was part of the reason this feelings towards his room mate came up again, stronger than ever before, nothing more, nothing less. And it had definitely nothing to do with a certain raindrop making its way down, leaving a small wet trail behind.
But thank god John had broken his gaze, closing his eyes and taking a few steading breaths, just to open his eyes and look at Sherlock as if he no longer saw the man. Then he started to work.
"I saw him. I saw the state he was in. God. Any other man would have died. John was certain of it. I could see it in his face. He's a doctor, he knows these things."
"Please, please stop. No more. Please." It was nothing more than a whisper, almost inaudible, until Marc interrupted him.
"I does doesn't it? That never stopped you before. And besides, we've been inside this house for ever." He said, still looking at John, a grin on his face.
Instead of going down that path of thoughts, Sherlock shook his head and sat himself up on the sofa to rubbed his hands across his face. Maybe John was right, and he should do something in the house. That was a kind thing to do for him, wasn't it? He wanted to do something that made John happy, just to see if that made the man turn colour also, so he could save that image in his mind palace with the rest of the information he had stuffed there about John. But he was definitely not cleaning or cooking.
John emptied his glass again, but did not take off to his bedroom to hide, as Sherlock had expected him to.
And...One time, I did. I killed myself. It was our anniversary. The day we had met, three years before. I went to Angelo's, sat at our table. Ordered your favourite and an expensive bottle of wine. I felt I needed to say goodbye to you, somehow. I went home to my apartment, drank whiskey, I put the gun against my head, and I pulled the trigger.
"That because I'm a pretty girl and I'm smart. And because I'm behind glass. It's safe for you to like me. You've got nothing to lose."
He walked towards him and swung his arm around him. Within seconds Sherlock was slumped against him, crying freely. Clenching his hands on John's back.
He had travelled the world, tearing apart terrorist cells, drug cartels, he had caught serial killers, child molesters, rapists. And he was about to die in the hands of a middle aged amateur painter in the middle of London. Beaten half to death, laying naked on the cold ground in his own piss, vomit and blood. Of all the stupid things he had done in his life, this may have been the stupidest. He should have never walked out on John.
"I don't like her, John. I don't 'like' people. You know that. But I do respect her work until now."
Sherlock didn't even want to move. Everything hurt. He couldn't open his eyes properly, but he could imagine what he looked like. He could feel the bruising's burning all over his body. He did always bruise easily. His body would be red and swollen here and there, the dark blue and purple would take time to show up, at least a few hours. He was really not looking forward to that. His body would have all different kind of shades. He moved again. His hands were getting more blood now the blood flow wasn't cut of anymore due to his own weight. They had started to tingle and now it felt as if they were on fire. He heard a stool behind him scrape over the floor. And Marc was standing in front of him again.
"You're an extraordinary man, John. Full of surprises. I've been watching you, you know. You're a skilled artist, so focused at your work. But there is something about you. You're more than you want to show to the outside world. You have a certain look in your eyes, dangerous. You look bloody hot with that body of yours, hiding away in those jumpers all the time. No, you caught my eye at first sight, and I could barely contain myself in the bathroom last Tuesday. But seeing you like this, dressed to kill, I know for sure that I want you, all of you, every inch of you." David leaned in closer and lifted John's hand from the bar, bringing to to his mouth. David dropped his voice even lower.
Sherlock was tilted onto the stretcher, and both John and Greg followed the medics out, heading towards the hospital.
John rushed towards the glass and looked at the spot on her cheek. Sherlock swallowed. He stood up and grabbed his phone.
"I'm happy for you. Not everybody gets the chance to find someone to love and get the same in return. Ow, hi Carla."
Energetically he stood up from the sofa, his blue dressing gown swinging dramatically around him, when he went towards the stairs to John's bedroom, barefooted as always.
Yesterday he had gone off to work, only to find Sherlock exactly the same as he left him that morning. Lying on the couch in his pyjamas and dressing gown, his eyes closed an his hands in front of his face, completely gone into his mind palace. The man in question was now sitting behind his microscope, totally unaware of John rummaging around in the kitchen behind him.
John stared at the items in front of him, letting the feeling of gratefulness and something else he was definitely not acknowledging wash over him, and before he could change his mind, he got up and reached for his phone.
They ate and talked. Sherlock joined them again after a few minutes, getting a look from John, which he ignored, and after dinner they talked and drank some more.
"I told them that you are private. And that you haven't drawn in a long time, and probably are a bit insecure about your work. You told me your work was terrible. But I have to say that i know you lied about that. You've managed to impress the teacher."
That left David Wolf and Marc Jenkins. His heart jumped at this step forward. Only a week in, and they already narrowed it down to two possible suspects. He lifted his head to share his deduction with his friend, but John was staring in the flames. The glass of whiskey in his hand, his face relaxed and his thoughts far away. Sherlock's lifted the corner of his mouth and put the papers on the table next to him, just to pick up the glass and take a sip. He let the liquid roll over his tongue and closed his eyes. He swallowed it down, enjoying the feeling the alcohol left in his throat.
John's lips turned into a smile against Sherlock's skin, while climbing onto the bed to sit behind him. Sherlock was sitting with his back towards John, completely naked. The smaller man's hands tickled along Sherlock's shoulder blades and then stroked his biceps in a promise for something more, earning him a deep rumble from Sherlock's throat.
In the army it had been even more difficult to keep it for himself. They were packed up together at the other end of the world, there wasn't much room for privacy. Of course some of the boys saw him work, they peeked over his shoulder and asked questions about it. But John always kept them at bay. Telling them to mind their own business and bugger off. As a captain he was out ranking them, and that helped, of course. Although he always managed to be one of the boys. Some of the people he had drawn had seen their own portrait, but definitely not everybody.
Maybe you changed your job and became a trauma surgeon again, doing what you do best. Working under stress, fixing people up, saving lives. The tremor in your hand is under control, so you could do that again, you know.
"Of course, John. I'll make sure it will be safe here. No one will see your work but me, is that alright with you?"
"It seems like the infected cells are starting to feed themselves on the healthy ones again." Sherlock said, looking at the stream from the microscope.
"He might be. I need to rush. Thank you again, Nita. I couldn't have done it without your help." John squeezed the woman's arm and turned away, heading towards the Mainstreet again.
It has been several months after the case of the missing models. After they found the body's of the four men burried in the abandoned neighbours' garden, Marc Jenkins was charged with the torture and murder of the four victims and the kidnapping, torture, and intended homicide of Sherlock. Sherlock had made a statement when he was well enough, and thank god he didn't want to observe and study the paintings the man had made of him or the other victims. From what Greg had told John about them, he really didn't want to see them.
"Sherlock. You've had surgery just four days ago. And yesterday you couldn't even stay awake for more than one hour at the time. Of course they won't let you out of the bed."
there was a droplet of rain falling from Sherlock's hair onto his collarbone, rolling down towards his chest, just to follow his path down towards his belly button. He saw the skin shiver where the droplet rolled down, leaving a small wet stripe behind.
John sat a plate with food in front of him and took a seat at the other side of the kitchen table when Sherlock looked up at him.
But if this was hell, why was the angel still here? He tried to smile at the angel, to make sure that he could see that everything was just alright.
The two men were sitting in their chairs across of each other, sipping their tea's, warming up from the cold outside. The fire in the hearth gave the room a feeling of security, making the room smaller and giving it a nice smell. John was enjoying it. He and Sherlock were discussing the course members they both talked too and they discussed their cover.
Sherlock took the rental and drove to Baskerville alone, eager to begin working this case. It was different from the cases he normally had, and he really liked the chemical aspect of it. When he entered the room of the lab he saw that Ava hadn't been sitting still. There was a table placed against the left part of the glass wall, with a computer screen on top of it.
"Good, good. Listen. If you see Sherlock or if he contacts you, please tell him to contact me, will you?"
"Hell yes. I'm going out with a bang and I'm taking everything to do with this virus with me. You press the button and then you have about ten minutes to tell everyone to get out."
Beth screamed and moaned and she tried to get closer to Ava, only to be retained by the cuffs she was in.
"Sherlock?" He asked the body laying on the ground against better knowledge. His heart pounded in his ears and the thought of losing this man made him nauseous. The butterflies in his stomach raged in terror, the one that had bitten into his heart began spreading venom. This couldn't be happening, this couldn't be real. He just got him back. He needed him.
Marc Jenkins. He was going to kill that man! Sherlock looked high or drunk when he got into the car with that man, that was what Mellon had said. But it had been no more than five minutes after he left the pub. He had no time to use something in that short period, could he? And he drank two pints. He knew Sherlock couldn't handle to much alcohol, but two pints wasn't exactly much.
Sherlock was staring back. Their eyes met and locked to each other for a moment. He felt his cheeks redding again and he swallowed again. His eyes went down to Sherlock's chest, trying to only see the shadows and the lights, the skin tones and the muscles. It sort of worked, until there was a droplet of rain falling from Sherlock's hair onto his collarbone, rolling down towards his chest, just to follow his path down towards his belly button. He saw the skin shiver where the droplet rolled down, leaving a small wet stripe behind.
John told him that he had drawn even before he could walk properly. He loved it. His parents encouraged it. But when he got older, his drawings became more personal. He started to draw things that he didn't want to share. It became something private, a way to express himself towards himself, a way to handle the world around him. He kept drawing, but he didn't share it with anyone anymore. It had become his life journal. Some people around him knew about it, but most didn't. He went through High school, carrying his sketchbook around with him, played rugby, studied hard and was a popular boy. He made his parents proud and his sister jealous. Then he went to medical school, carrying his sketchbook around with him, putting his emotions on paper. He studied hard again, was still popular, played several sports. And he kept drawing for himself, never showed his work to anyone. (All did Mike Stamford see some of it, being his roommate, when he left some unfinished work on his desk.) There were girlfriends that wanted to see it, or even asked to be drawn by him. But he had refused every time. He never felt comfortable enough to share it with anyone.
"There has been an experimental study going on, but there has been some... misfortunes." Mycroft said.
John rolled his eyes dramatically and smirked at his roommate. His eyes went down and up again, and the smirk on his face became even bigger.
He shook up when someone opened the door to the bathroom. It was David. For a second he felt the pinch of jealousy come up again, until he saw the man's face. There was no smug expression whatsoever on his face, and he even seemed to be a bit worried.
They didn't talk about the drawings again. When Sherlock got into the living room the next morning the sketchbook was gone. John was acting normal again; the emotions of Thursday night seemed to be buried away somewhere. Sherlock was thankful for this turn of the events. He had no idea how to handle a situation like that. And neither did John apparently. So they both just acted like it never happened.
"He's just out of surgery. They had to operate him to set his dislocated knee back and to fix a ruptured testicle."
But John's heart had turned out too big for him to handle. And it almost destroyed him. He had come back from the war empty. Nothing to return to, nothing to look forward to, nothing to keep his big heart satisfied. John was diagnosed PTSD, was depressed, had a psychosomatic limp, a tremor in his dominant hand, and was looking for a way out. Sherlock suspected that he had considered taking his own life, and if his old roommate hadn't bumped into him in the park, he might even had done it. Thank god for Mike Stamford.
"Yes John. I'm not a child. Now. If you'll excuse me, I'm going to pack my bag, I suggest you do the same."
Inside the bag there was a bottle of wine they had discussed the previous evening, a full pack of cigarettes, and a package with butterscotch cookies she told him she liked so much.
The group walked behind her. John was walking next to David Wolf, talking and laughing. Sherlock was right behind them, walking with the much more reserved Liam Murphy, who was talking in a soft voice about the closing art shop in the centre of town.
"Well, that was a deeper conversation than I had meant it to be. You two should go home now. Enjoy each others company. Trust me, I'm a teacher, I know such things."
John stood up from his bed on which he had been lying, trying to read, but his mind to far away. The room was barely lit, but John could see the redness of the detective's eyes.
"Yeah. Always 'fraid you'd find out he was using. Always sayin' he'd lose ya over it. That it would kill em. Complete 'nutter, that one."
"Partly. And because of your investigation in my previous models. How did you think you could keep yourself anonymous, mister Holmes? Did you really think people wouldn't figure it out?"
Sherlock kissed the tip of his fingers and touched the top of the stone with them. Then he turned around and started walking towards the love of his life.
"I was so lost without you. I wanted to kill myself, every morning I picked up my gun, put it against my head and asked myself if this was the day I would end it all. It was tempting, sometimes. But then came the day I met you. The most extraordinary, arrogant, childish and brilliant man I've even seen in my life. I loved you instantly, you know. Well, maybe not the first time at Bart's, I was a bit overwhelmed by you then, but definitely the day after.
John was looking at the people coming and going at the hospital. It was half past three now, a time people came by to visit their loved ones that were hospitalised. But Mycroft could see that the man didn't notice any of them.
It was the first time he saw one of the brain dead in real life. And the one once called Clive was walking into the room.
They took a cab to the art school. It wasn’t raining this time, but the sun was already settling itself behind the horizon, making the air drop a few degrees. John held a folder in his hand in which he could stack his work later tonight. Sherlock was wearing those ridiculous tight jeans again, and had put on a jumper that John had never seen before. By the looks of it, Sherlock had purchased it himself. It fitted him perfectly and even though it was a jumper, it still looked posh as hell. John looked out of the window and smirked.
The class dismissed for coffee and tea and the occasional smoke. John waited in the classroom for Sherlock. He hadn't seen him the whole day, and he felt the need to be close to him. When Sherlock got out of the room walking towards him, john saw that he was wearing one of his jumpers again.
John hesitated. This woman looked smart, and she was definitely not high. Should he lie? No. Too much at stake.
But it didn't matter. Without John, nothing mattered. When he woke up the next day in a hospital, he almost couldn't believe it. Someone had found him and had felt empathy for him, and had made sure he was treated. He was given another chance.
"Yes. After two hours of sitting still I can use one of these." He said, pulling his package out of his pocket. He put a cigarette between his lips and thanked David for lighting it.
Sherlock watched the black screen in front of him for a few seconds, before clicking it down, and conducted himself back into the sheets with statistics.
When the cab stopped in front of 221b, Sherlock had stepped out of the cab, letting John handle the payment, and he had let himself inside. He took the stairs two at a time, and when he entered the apartment he went straight into his bedroom, slamming the door so hard that John would hear it and wasn't going to follow him. He had shrugged of the stupid jacket and had thrown himself onto his bed. He cried silently. Tears running down his face, his eyes swollen and his cheeks burning. He felt as if he was a small boy again. Just like in bygone days, before he was capable to control his transport and emotions. Just like before he had created his shield and to learned to detach himself from his feelings. He had managed to take a distance from the pain. It just wasn't worth it, feeling alone and misunderstood by everybody around him. Hiding away in his room and crying his eyes out, because the other kids thought he was a freak and even the adults including his parents had their opinion ready for him. They all thought he was strange, broken, needed to be fixed. So he made his shield, cutting him off from all the idiots roaming this world, making it capable to live his life, making sure he would never feel the pain or anything else anymore. Alone was what he had, what had protected him. I had worked for years.
When Sherlock ended the call he leaned himself against the wall behind him, trying to steadying his heart beat and breathing to a normal rhythm again. It was a good thing John didn't see him like this. All flushed and wobbly, only because the man said that he thought he could be sweet, adorable even. The only one who had ever said something like that to him was his mother. And that didn't count. Every mother thinks their offspring is adorable.
"Sherlock. You'll be sitting half naked in a freezing room for at least four hours tonight, while there are fourteen people staring at you. You don't want to sit there with a growling stomach. Now, eat."
God, They are really good with turning around each other, aren't they? But there are thing you can bury deep, but can't keep from coming back up.
At this moment I am lying in an abandoned alley, hidden away in the shadows, hoping they won't find me and torture me and keep me alive just to mess with my mind and trying to figure out who I'm working for. They don't know who I am, but somehow they figured out that I'm not who I said I was. They held me for two days, but I managed to escape. But they did instigate some damage to my transport. Not to severe, but still enough to distract me and slow me down. My body is shaking, there is a nasty cut on the back of my head that doesn't stop bleeding, and I'm very thirsty. I haven't had anything to drink for almost thirty-eight hours. And it's hot here. I notice that I have difficulty focusing my thoughts. I think I will not survive this one. I am crying. I am crying, not because of the pain they gave me or the ending of this all, I am crying because I will not see you again.
When he came back this time, he managed not to moan or move. His head felt clear, strangely clear, although his vision was probably still blurry. He couldn't even open his eyes anymore because of the swelling. Breathing was hard, laying still was hard. He thought he had never been in so much pain before. He tried to make a mental map of his injuries, to keep his brain busy and his mind clear.
Sherlock never was one of the popular blokes, quite the opposite. Hiding away in the library, the laboratory or his dorm room, shutting everybody out and minding his own business. Where John's heart had been too big, Sherlock's mind had been. Unable to shut it down, caressing it, but hating it at the same time. Just as John he was self destructive. John had been unable to turn his heart off, too care less for the people around him, and it almost killed him. Sherlock had tried to shut his mind down, finding relief with his drug use (or abuse, if you believed his brother) but it nearly took his life on several occasions. And he felt like it didn't matter at that time. If that was what it took to shut it off, then he had to take it. But just like John's mind had overruled his heart on occasion, telling himself that he could go on, that there must be something to live for after all, the same thing had happened to him. The heart had told his mind to try and get clean, to use his abilities for the good, and so he tried several times.
"We have to wait for at least two hours before we can go further. Stay. Smoke with me, and tell me about yourself and the psychopath that thought you were an angel."
"Is it? I heard Esmeralda say to him that it looked good. She never gives compliments if they're not earned." The other man (Han? Hank? Harry?) mingled in. Sherlock just shrugged again. He took a big inhalation from his cigarette and shot the bum away.
In the cafeteria, John laughed at something Donna said, taking another sip of his coffee. Marc was talking to Phil, and before John could have joined them, he was greeted by Donna, who was curious about him. She was asking him all sorts of questions about his art, his work, and eventually his relationship status.
The monkey screamed when Ava entered the needle in its arm. The sedative made the monkey go quit, and within a few minutes it appeared dead.
He slowly opened his eyes and when the angel saw he looking at him he lowered himself down next to his face.
"So, Ava is there alone at this moment, she did run several tests that I think where pretty clever. I won't bore you with all the details about them, you wouldn't understand them anyway. She even managed getting samples of infected brain-tissue from one of the subjects. She locked them up in a cage normally used for the bigger apes."
She soundly retreated back against the wall, while Sherlock was banging on the glass. It worked. Clive staggered towards him, and pressed his face against the glass.
Sherlock felt confused. How could John have noticed that? What about John? How could he fall for someone when the other was right next to him?
"I... Ehm. Thank you, Ava. Thank you for our conversations and your wise words. I'll do something with them, I promise. Thank you. It was good to get to know you. Well... good luck, I guess."
Instantly Marc's foot was on his chest. He kicked him hard down. Sherlock tried to breath. It was difficult and he was afraid he would suffocate. He felt the leather belt hitting him again. On his head, in his face, on his body. He tried to put his arms in front of his face, but they were kicked away. The man started kicking him in earnest now. Ribs, arms, hips and head. The world went black again.
"I'm sorry John. It's my fault. I got him focusing on the work here, and we lost track of time. I need to get some rest anyway. We can work further tomorrow."
Package? What package? He took a bite of his toast while standing up to check the desk in the living room. There was indeed a package. It looked like it was a carton box wrapped up in a dark brown paper. Curiously John picked it up and brought it with him to the sofa. He sat down and turned the package in his hands. Sherlock said it was for him, so he should be able to open in without being scared that it would explode or have some extremely contaminated experimental tubes inside. But still, it was Sherlock, so who knew?
"No. Not right now. There are some other samples still in quarantine, but we need to wait for a few hours before those are ready to look into."
Sherlock nagged when he finally picked up the phone after it rang for the sixth time straight until it went to voicemail.
John could just hear the confusion in Sherlock's voice, and despite the big slip he just made, he had to laugh at it.
"Just text me the details. I'll come back at you when I'm finished collecting data. Goodbye brother." Sherlock pushed the button of his phone with one hand and grinned at John.
He put down the papers in his lap and reached for the tea John made him, sipping it, knowing that John would appreciate that he didn't make this cup for nothing. Sherlock settled himself comfortable in his chair, his legs tugged underneath him, and just listened to the mysterious man in front of him.
I lost everything in one week. My parents, my sister, my surrogate family in Afghanistan, my army job, my future as a surgeon. Everything. When they send me back to England three weeks later, they gave me my possessions that they had found in what was left of the camp. All the letters from my parents had been destroyed, as were all my photo's, clothes, and almost everything else. Except for my sketchbook. It looked as if it hadn't been in a war zone, and I almost left it there. What was the point? It was filled with emotions, pain. Eventually I did took it home with me, don't even know why. But I did. I never picked up a pencil after that."
The second time was during his absence. He was convinced he was going to die. He was severely dehydrated, bleeding from a nasty head wound and almost starved to death. And although it was about eighty degrees in the shade where he was hiding, his skin felt ice cold. He was going to die, and the only thing he could think of, was that he would never see him again. He had missed him so much, and now that he was almost finished, almost ready to go back to London again, he would never go home to him. It was all he wanted, it was what had driven him, kept him going and kept him sane. To just go home and see him again. It was selfish to think like this, to see John as something he had earned, and it was stupid to cry over it, definitely because he already was dehydrated.
Marc started to lash out, strike after strike hit him. On his back, his shoulders, his bum, his legs, everywhere. Sherlock growled at every hit, trying to keep his mind clear. There had to be a way out of this. The last strike was hard on his ribs, and he made a pitiful sound because of it.
"As you al can see, we have a new student today. This is John." She said, gesturing towards him. John smiled a bit and raised his hand to greet everyone.
Nita turned around to John, who shrugged his shoulders and looked very guilty. He had told Nita what happened, so when she saw the look on his face, she knew enough. They were on the right track.
The corner of John's mouth twitched up in a small smile, thinking back at that moment. The shy butterflies in his stomach came back, carefully exploring if it was safe to show themselves again.
Sherlock took a step back, letting go of John, who was looking bewildered at him. Hastily he took another step back, panic clouding his mind.
" I'm going to go and sleep now. It's not even late at night anymore, but more early in the morning. I suggest you try and do the same. We have a long day tomorrow, you and me. I think I'll might paint you tomorrow again, when the colouring has evolved further. You're skin changes so quick. It's just beautiful. To bad you can't see yourself. You are truly a piece of art like this. One of the best models I ever worked with. I do hope you manage to stay alive for at least two days. The fun is not over yet. And do you know how hard it is to find a good model these days? But, when your job is done, I know who will be my next muse. Although doctor Watson's is a bit old for my taste, his skin does have more of a golden tone. I do think he'll make a beautiful bruising canvas, don't you think? Or maybe he looks better scattered with blood? We'll see."
They went to work together. Both at their own computer, asking questions and sharing thoughts about the matter. Somehow they made a good team. They sat at their desks for hours until a beep made Ava look up.
When the pause was over and they got back into the classroom, John walked next to Sherlock. Happy to know that he was allowed to stare at that man for at least more two hours without being questioned.
"This makes you quiet doesn't it? She has a husband and three children outside the facility. We told them that she had died. They buried an empty casket. It's sad. She was a great neuroscientist, I learned a lot from her in the past, and I was looking forward to work with her here. But we only got a full week before she got bitten."
Sherlock studied him. The skin was in a state of disintegration, the teeth black, eyes white, and he was scraping his half hands across the glass, trying to get to Sherlock. It was a horrific, monstrous sight. And Sherlock felt a spike of fear. If the virus got out it would be a disaster. He had done his research. There wasn't anything like this in the world, and out of curiosity he had seen some episodes of different television series and some movies. Most of them were complete nonsense, but there was one series that had established an sort of realistic view of what would happen to the world when something like that really happened. And it wasn't something to look out for. The man in front of him suddenly pressed himself harder to the glass, screaming. Sherlock could see Ava behind him with ano empty syringe in her hand. Clive turned around and swung an arm at her. Ava let herself fall back, but the remaining fingernails scratched her cheek. Clive took two steps towards her, and fell down.
Lower back: Persistent pain lower back and on top of the buttocks area, swelling at the base of spine; Bruised tailbone.
"Yes. Normally I'm going to another place, but some friends of mine wanted to meet here. Unfortunately, they called it off while I was already on my way. So I thought it would be nice to stay for a pint or two before Gerald arrives."
When Sherlock looked up at the woman at the other end of the glass he saw she was staring at him. A little frown on her forehead. Was she deducing him?
The man's sock index was nonexistence. How could he live like this? The rest of John's bedroom was army tidy, as usual, but the drawer with socks was like a crime scene. (At best a four, but still.) There were loose socks, socks turned inside out, a few bundles of a pair, which had to be separated to be certain that they were a matching pair, obviously, and he even found a sock with a hole in it. It was a right mess. John's life would be a lot more easier when Sherlock was done here. He sat down in front of the cabinet, his long legs crossed in front of him, and he took out all the socks, making the drawer empty, and started to search out pairs. He threw the sock with the hole in it over his shoulder, and added another one with a hideous pattern on it. (Really John? Grey with blue stripes?)
I always tried to hide my affection for you, wishing you would never figure out what you meant to me. But now I wished that you had. I wished I could have taken you with me and that you were here. Holding me, comforting me. I still would cry, but my tears would be of happiness, of the fact that I had the chance to have you, spend my life with you, knowing that you admired me as much as I admire you.
A pause. A diary? Did he see it like that? And he was lying again. He showed some of his work to Sherlock. Did John gave him a look inside his diary?
One day he was gone. I saw him again several weeks later. Clean shaven, pretty clothes, and apparently off drugs. He asked me if I wanted to help him with a case. All I had to do was keep my eyes open. He offered me money for it, which I declined, because we were friends. But he left a couple of hundreds for me anyway. I helped him out that time. And the next, and the next, before he came back to us. Back shooting up, I mean. It had been almost a year since his last rehab. We bought together, used together, and when he overdosed himself I called an ambulance for him. I remember when he came back, he told me that if it ever happened again, that I had to call a certain number, and to look in his pockets for a note.
"God... What did he do to you?" John mumbled, putting his jacket back over Sherlock's chest. Softly he touched his forehead with the back of his hand. Sherlock whimpered.
"She told me about your history together. She told me about your addiction, getting clean and eventually staying clean. And the reason for it."
When his cigarette was finished, his head was still working full speed. He needed to make it stop. Or at least slow down a bit.
After a few minutes, Sherlock lifted his head from John's shoulder, his cheeks wet and red from crying. He pulled back a bit.
The next day, Sherlock didn't talk to him, ignoring him once again, and went to bed early that night, something he almost never did, and especially not when he was on a case, and definitely not two nights in a row. Something was wrong.
"What? Don't be jealous, Pretty. You'll always be our number one. And we need John, don't we? Look where it got us without him. And besides, if you can have both of us, why can't I? I promise I'll share him, gorgeous."
"No, let me finish, this is important. I want you to understand what you mean to me, Sherlock. After your fall, it just wasn't worth it anymore. I tried, Sherlock. I tried for Mrs Hudson, for Molly, for Greg. But not for myself. I just couldn't handle it. It was as if I was back to before I met you, when I had come back from Afghanistan. My life was empty, the world grey. Every morning and evening I would take my gun out and weight it in my hands again, wondering if I was going to do it today.
After one and a half hour, Sherlock felt his back getting irritated. He shifted a bit on his chair which Esmeralda noticed, and she immediately called for a break.
"Sleep is for the weak? God, look at this! You're brilliant! Let's work this out further, shall we, handsome?"
Mycroft walked into the small waiting room of the hospital at the intensive care unit. The tapping of his umbrella matching the pace of his footsteps. Detective Inspector Lestrade was sitting on one of the uncomfortable chairs. Mycroft walked across the further empty waiting room and took a seat next to the inspector. Greg looked up. His eyes were red, as if he had been crying. Had he? Or had he just worked too long? No. Definitely crying.
"Why aren't you answering your phone?" John asked while closing the door behind him. He put his nose in the air an sniffed.
Silence again. Sherlock could almost hear John's mind working as hard as his own. What did he mean by that?
It was already late at night. John was almost asleep in his chair when Sherlock had started talking again.
"In the break you will have plenty of time to get to know each other, but I would like to begin our class now. As you all have noticed, it isn't getting any warmer in here, and I don't want you all to freeze in here. Today we will start with a new model. His name is Gerald, and he's an experienced art model, so we can take our time with him. He will be our subject for the weeks to come. And we will start with a face slash torso study."
"Don't worry, Doctor. I'll keep this door closed. And he can't do much harm outside, can he?" Ava said.
"It doesn't hurt, much. The skin is dead, and somehow I still have function in this arm. Although I can feel the strength getting less."
Underneath the bandage John could see discolouring of the skin, open wounds that didn't really seemed to bleed, and a beginning of gangrene.
I thought it was a stupid thing to say. Be patient, wait till death come's for you, instead of finding death yourself? Two weeks later you were standing in front of me, and it became clear to me why he had done it."
“six weeks now. I'm really bored out of my mind, as you can understand. There's just so much I can do on my own."
"No I haven't. Not since you two started the case with the missing models. How's that going, by the way?"
Damn, this was embarrassing. While he pulled the sweater down around his chest, his head down as to see what he was doing, he glanced up trough his eyelashes. He could see the beginning of an erection in the other man's trousers. Bloody hell.
And it was as good as he thought it would be. Finally it happened, it was something he had fantasised about for years. John wanted to do it again. He wanted those lips on his own again. He wanted all of that man. What did he have to lose? But it was Sherlock. And he had seen the confusion in his eyes afterwards. Not just confusion,but something that looked like pain, or fear. Sherlock was probably now hiding in some drug den, shooting up, getting high to forget that this had ever happened. For God's sake! Why didn't Mycroft call him back?
The tense came back in the shorter man's shoulders, and Sherlock wished he hadn't asked John about the drawing.
"You are not in a position to tell me what to do!" Marc screamed. Sherlock could hear the man stand up and walk towards the place where his tools were. By the sound of it he returned with his leather belt thing again.
"What's that sound in the back?" Sherlock asked. Ava's voice lost a bit of the natural lightheartedness Sherlock was getting accused to.
"Good? Are you kidding me? It is perfect, Sherlock. Absolutely perfect. I... I just... Well, thank you. I want to thank you. It's very thoughtful of you, very sweet."
"I do suggest you bring a map with you next time, so you can take it home with you. And if you think you are ready, maybe you can look for a set of pencils of your own? It never hurts to work at home, getting familiar with the different densities of the pencils and to find out which sort of paper you prefer? Until that time you are free to use ours, of course."
"Are you sure?" He asked Sherlock tenderly, his hand going down and cupping Sherlock's cheek. Sherlock brought his own hand up and lied it on top of John's.
Sherlock needed to clear his mind. To get the picture of his room mate out of his head so he could focus back on the case. He stood up and went for his violin, picking it up and putting it under his chin. The soft sounds filled the room and his head, pressing almost every thought about John aside.
Within minutes John was fast asleep. He didn't even take his trousers or shoes off. His face was buried deep in his pillow, his blanked only covering part of his back.
Sherlock looked at John. It had been two days since he woke up in the hospital, and his eyes were capable to stay open now.
Sherlock's voice had dropped, and it was softer than usual. John tried to smile, but failed at it. His eyes were sad.
"About eight years ago, I was living in some crack house at the other end of London. I was using at that time, and I went onto the streets to sell my body for cash. Not something I am proud off, but it happened. It was my life back then. One night, I was walking the streets and a car stopped, asking what it would cost and I was about to step inside to go to some abandoned alley with that man, when a strange young man appeared behind me.
"Your man is very gifted." She said. Sherlock lifted an eyebrow and went to stand beside her, looking down at the sketch in front of him.
"I'm going in to get some coffee and warm up a bit. I've still got at least two more hours to sit still for you guys. See you inside."
Chest: Pain while breathing in. Tenderness on chest, Muscle spasms of the rib cage; Heavily bruised ribs.
Ignoring the bruising's on the skin in front of him, John lifted the jacket from Sherlock's body to look for other severe injuries that needed medical care as soon as possible.
Sherlock blinked and stayed quiet, looking at her. She looked back. She didn't even flinch. Interesting.
"I believe you're lean, but not that lean, pretty. It will never fit. You can't come inside through there."
They made it on time to the art school this time, and they split up as soon as they were entering the cafeteria, talking to different people, their main focus on the three primary suspects, until Esmeralda came to ask them to follow her to the classroom.
John laughed along with the man. He didn't really know David. They had chatted a bit before, he did have a little row with him when he felt jealous about Sherlock, he had borrowed the mans sweatshirt, seen him getting aroused but the man spend the breaks outside to smoke, so he was mostly targeted by Sherlock.
“Good afternoon to you too, mister Holmes. My name is Ava Jones, working on this case for just one month. When the first mutations were taking place, they called me over to have a look. Never left since."
"Bloody hell, Sherlock! You're unbelievable. What would have been the point?!" John yelled back, turning around, facing him again.
"Yes, John. That would be lovely. I'll just get something on me and I'll join you in the cafeteria, alright?"
Sherlock inhaled from his cigarette, folding his arm around him to keep himself warm. David lit himself another cigarette and started talking again.
"Aren't all artists? Ow. You might have a talk with your man. I might have given him the wrong idea."
You know, this is the second time I cried in my whole adult life. Sure I've shred tears before, but those were out of physical pain, or part of an act. I once told you that I had full control over my body. You are the only thing except pain or drugs that manage to let me lose that control. My transport reacts on you. It does things out of itself, ignoring my instructions. You make my heart rate speed up. You make my skin blush and feel overheated. You make my head spin and my cock hard and you even make me cry. You did all of that. One man with all that power over me. I would never have thought it possible.
Where a heart should have been resting sat an ugly hole, singed flesh meeting singed clothes in a battle for domination. A fire in the heart, dancing and heating up whatever it captured, until eventually it reached its final end and took what it had burnt to the grave. Dead is when the spark in the eyes is extinguished, yet unlike fire is utterly without smoke. Sherlock was burnt, scarred with heat from the one man who managed to claw the heart he considered to be nonexistent out his chest and wrap his reaffirming hands around it. Hands that were bruised. Hands that were broken. Hands that were scarlet.
"Can I tell you a secret?" He whispered, as if this were a genuine secret he was about to exploit. Sherlock nodded and lent in slightly, placing one of his hands on top of John's.
"Sherlock can't you just tell me, my head hurts from trying to figure this out." John asked hopefully.
"I know you well enough to not expect either so I honestly don't know, how about you help me out instead?" John suggested, hoping Sherlock would just give him a straight answer but being thoroughly disappointed.
To see him dead was to die himself, there was no him without the man who made him who he was, there was no Sherlock Holmes without John Watson stood by his side. Dead is permanent. Dead is forever. Dead is not only for the dead but for the living, the ones who had to pick up the pieces and wake up every morning alive but not, breathing yet still struggling for breath. Sherlock couldn't breath, he could feel the hands round his throat but they were only his own, clawing at the exposed flesh to find some kind of release from everything surrounding him.
"No need, I'm certain you were irreversibly in love with me to begin with." Sherlock joked back somewhat reluctantly.
"Oh come on, don't you want to fall in love with me?" John teased, poking Sherlock with his free hand. He didn't know why exactly he wanted to have a staring match with Sherlock anyway, perhaps it was because he was a sore loser or perhaps he just wanted to see what happened.
"I thought we were meant to be a cute couple, not bickering teenagers." Sherlock commented, letting go of johns hand just to wrap his arm round his back. John rested his arm on sherlocks waist and led them inside the screen room.
"Light blue and a little dark blue... but with bits of green in the middle and gold in one. Basically just every eye colour mixed together." John described, feeling slightly embarrassed but not knowing why.
"What other languages can you speak?" John asked, having heard his friend speak multiple tongues on many occasions.
When he opened his eyes again there was only one John in the alleyway, but Sherlock knew better than to believe the other one was gone. A small part of him wanted the not-John to stay, the rational part of his brain overwhelmed by the side of him yearning to hear his voice one last time. If an illusion of his best friend was the only way to do this, then so be it.
"Am I allowed to distract you?" John asked, really wishing he could look away but not understanding why.
"You said friend or lover, which one do you think?" Sherlock asked in return, still not having looked away.
"No, it was in the taxi earlier." Sherlock clarified, meaning he had won as they'd been interrupted by the cabbie.
"When I was working in the tents on the front line a soldier came in with half his leg missing, and we had to stop him from bleeding out so we could seal the wound. I was in such a rush I sliced my hand open with the scissors I was using to cut his trousers back." John explained, leaving Sherlock at a loss for words. Of course he understood John was an army doctor and therefore would have seen traumatic circumstances on the battlefield, but he still couldn't imagine having to tend to someone with half of his leg missing and still remain sane.
John was a soldier. A soldier who fought for the freedom of his country and his name, fought for their sons and daughters who he would never meet but never had to. He risked his own health and fortune for the idea of a what if, the idea of a better life for the blank faces that opened him doors or carried his shopping when his shoulder failed him. Sherlock was usually the blank face, but not in the way others were. Emotions were a weakness, hope was for the hopeless and sentimentality was a gun to his head, but John was the bullet. John was warm hands and soft voices and lights twinkling in the sky at night, eruptions of gold and silver on a diamond plate or leaves crinkling beneath your feet. He was everything that ever was and nothing at all at the same time.
"Do I know this person?" John asked, attempting to narrow it down even slightly. Sherlock smiled but it didn't reach his eyes, as if he were hearing a really bad joke.
When they got home Sherlock instantly walked into their bedroom and closed the door, stating without words he wanted some time to himself. John didn't mind, instead making himself a cup of tea and sitting with his laptop to look at the news. It was just full of boring politicians with their mixed opinions on Donald trump so John decided to just tweet instead, responding to some of his less invasive followers.
"Well in that case." John said, and without hesitation lent down and pecked Sherlock on the nose. He had finally come to the conclusion that perhaps doing these kind of things with his best friend wasn't that bad after all, as long as it made them both happy who cares where it led them. Sherlock looked up at him shocked, but then a smile appeared on his face.
John could still feel sherlocks gaze burning into the side of his head and turned to meet his eyes, thinking if he caught him staring he'd look away. But he didn't. John found himself stuck in an involuntary staring match in which neither intended to loose, determined to beat Sherlock instead of the other way around for once. His bright blue eyes bore into his, seeing things no one else saw and somehow appearing like he was reading johns every thought just by looking at him. John raised his eyebrows and Sherlock smirked slightly, still refusing to look away and instead shifting so he was ever so slightly closer. John didn't really understand what was happening or why he'd allowed Sherlock to trap him with his eyes in the first place, but there was no way he was going to look away when he had sherlocks undivided attention. It made him feel special when he knew Sherlock was only thinking about him, as if being able to capture the great mind of Sherlock Holmes was a prize worth boasting about, so he enjoyed the moment while it lasted.
"Did we pass?" John asked jokingly, but if he'd of been looking at Sherlocks eyes that moment he would have caught a flash of sadness gloss over them.
Sherlock looked up to see John crouching before him, warmth radiating from the tan colour of his skin and the light blue of his shirt. The detective smiled slightly in return, reaching out to place a hand on John's shoulder, but there was nothing there to touch.
"Budge up." John said, nudging Sherlocks legs so he could sit down. Sherlock only moved them briefly whist John got comfy before placing them down on his lap, knowing John didn't mind the intimate gesture anyway. John picked up today's newspaper and skimmed over the front page, nothing interesting catching his eye so instead picking a random page and beginning to read. Sherlock had closed his eyes, probably to visit his mind palace, and had rested his hands beneath his chin in what looked like prayer. They stayed like that for quite awhile, neither of them acknowledging the others presence but still knowing they were there, the fact that they were besides eachother was enough. At one point Sherlock twisted onto his side, his cold feet pushing underneath johns leg to steal his warmth. Sherlock was always cold and it had just become something John associated with  his friend, another trait on the long list of things he noticed about him that others didn't.
He'd been dead for only a short period, not long enough for the body to wilt away but long enough for the limbs to be stiff, like a puppeteer had sculpted the perfect murder scene and left it hanging for someone to stumble across. There were no deductions made apart from the obvious, so obvious is was scrawled in blood above the matted grey hair on the wall.
"Thank you love, let me just pay for this and we'll go sit down." John shook his head smiling and passed the money over to the girl, who had been listening to their short exchange.
"There was a study conducted in 1989 assuring that simple eye contact could make a person fall in love with you. In this study two opposite sex strangers were asked to gaze into each other's eyes for two minutes, which in some cases was enough to produce passionate feelings for each other. Eye contact is a powerful stimulator of love and affection, when you look someone directly in the eyes, their body produces a chemical called phenylethylamine that may make the person feel in love. If you want to make someone fall in love with you, one of the first thing you should do is to look into their eyes." Sherlock stated as if he were reading from a website without reason, but John understood why when he mentioned the chemical. He was surprised for a whole minute before deciding to just accept it as one of sherlocks quirks, choosing to wait and listen to Sherlock explain himself before thinking about it too hard.
"That's a perfectly sound observation there but I listen to classical pieces made by musical geniuses, not cheesy songs written by overpaid industries."
"Shouldn't you buy me dinner before asking a question like that?" Sherlock said smiling, and John couldn't help but smile at the clever idiot.
"We're friends, and friends care about each other. Maybe one day you'll actually try and make it look like you care about me too." John huffed. Sherlock looked genuinely hurt by John's comment and John felt slightly guilty.
John's heart thudded in his chest as he tried to take in the possibility. Sherlock never corrected anyone, not even once. It seemed ridiculous, impossible even, yet there was no one else to sort through. Sherlock was still watching him but now his expression was clear as day, afraid and vulnerable and looking as if he was ready to jump out the window. Sherlock had figured out John had reached an answer, and now he was frozen in his chair waiting for John to say something.
Sherlock was nothing now, not that he was ever a something to begin with. John made him something, made him the man Mother's scolded their children to be and hopeless souls ran to for help. A man with a brain which would cure the universe but could not cure himself, no matter how many drugs he pumped into his veins or how many times he shut out the world. The drugs didn't make him numb, they made him more aware of his own mentality and overall weakness in the grand scheme of his existence, but he longed for them now to just shut out the real world for just one moment.
"Who could've thought you enjoyed watching other people suffer." Sherlock replied, glaring up at him with a pout. Sherlocks hands were warm around johns and he decided there and then he would tickle him again if it meant seeing a pouting yet affectionate Sherlock.
"My mother once took me to be tested for autism and the results were rather alarming, but it did explain how my mind palace technique works so well. Apparently my case of autism means I'm good at remembering languages and numbers, however if I don't actually want to learn it I may as well have never heard it in the first place." Sherlock explained, looking slightly uncomfortable. John caught on soon enough.
"I think we're a bit of both." He whispered as the adverts had already started and it felt disrespectful talking over them. Sherlock however didn't seem to care.
"Doesn't matter, you're more important." John whispered, squeezing his hand for emphasis. Sherlock smiled ever so slightly and rubbed his foot along johns leg, warming them both up.
"Lover." He said flatly, and that was the grand conclusion. Sherlock had little to no friends and the people at Scotland Yard were out of the question. He had shown his feelings towards Molly very clearly and there was no one left to sort through, no one apart from one person. John recalled what Mrs Hudson had said the very first day he went to look at 221B to consider moving in.
Looking over at Sherlock lying on the sofa with his palms pressed together beneath his chin he wondered what he was thinking about. It wasn't unusual for Sherlock to just disappear into his head recently, after they had returned from the pool he hadn't spoken for days. John had been warned by him that it would happen the very first conversation they had, but it didn't mean he wasn't hurt by the silence. Right now he was just about done with Sherlock ignoring him, so he stood up and walked over to the sofa. Sensing someone watching him Sherlock cracked his eyes open, glaring up at John with accusing eyes.
"6 minutes and 37 seconds." He answered, meaning they'd had more than triple the amount of  constant eye contact needed to 'fall in love.' John was surprised at the answer, not realising he'd really stared at Sherlock that long without even looking away.
"The storyline wasn't as horrendous as I thought it would be, however the ending was unjustified." He stated, making his reply sound like he was a genuine critic.
"I don't mean it like that! I'm glad we're talking and everything, it's just not something I thought I'd ever talk about with you." John amended and Sherlock relaxed ever so slightly.
During the film the main characters were seated inside a cinema watching an old movie together, staring into each other's eyes and slowly leaning in. John smiled as he thought about Sherlock, and had to urge to just sit up and kiss him too. Instead he turned his head and placed a kiss on Sherlocks jaw, seeing him smile out the corner of his eye. Sherlock pulled him closer despite the armrest separating their chairs, and John snuggled further into Sherlocks neck. He could feel Sherlocks breath gently blowing on his head, and wished for a moment the film would never end so they could stay like this forever.
"It bothers me that people are so nosy, but it's just an article written by someone trying to promote their website. Why should I care what it says?" John replied, saying it to himself as much as to Sherlock.
"We already have." Sherlock stated, which was true as John had sought out his friends eyes as soon as he could see them. Now that he knew they'd started he was nervous and unable to explain why. Sherlocks eyes were beautiful really, sparkling blue mixed with emerald green and a hint of gold in the centre. But it was the way he looked at him that always encaptured his attention, as if he were the most interesting subject in the world. For someone who saw as much as Sherlock did being interesting to him was something John considered an achievement.
"She was always our biggest fan." John said, trying to break the tension that had filled up every corner of the room. It didn't work. Sherlock stared at him, unresponsive to the comment. John tried a different approach.
"Oh you know, just collecting my staring contest prize." John answered cheerily, turning around and taking a sip of his tea.
"Well I'm 37, just so you know for future reference." John admitted, curious as to why Sherlock smiled at the information.
"The mystery person. Friend or lover?" John said, for once putting Sherlock at a loss for words. There was silence in the flat.
"Thank you, we're very happy together." John replied with a smile before Sherlock could say something rude. The girl smiled widely and handed over their change, wishing them a good day as they walked away.
"You always were a drama queen, still are actually." John said, finally moving his arm now that it had actually gone numb. Sherlock didn't move away, instead just rested his head back down more comfortably and allowing John to rest his arm on his shoulder. They were basically cuddling now with Sherlock leaning against johns chest and John with his arm around him, but both were comfy and neither wanted to move. Sherlocks curls were tickling his chin, they smelt like coconut shampoo and hairspray and something that was just Sherlock. Said man continued to flick through the newspaper but quickly reached the end, throwing it to the floor and stretching his legs so far they hung off the end of the sofa.
"Then you either lose or I'm coming with you." Sherlock said, smiling as john frowned in fake annoyance.
"But that's not fair, it's an inescapable human reaction to respond to being- ah- tickled." Sherlocks voice went higher as John tickled him again. He narrowed his eyes at him in warning, but John was finding his newfound power way too much fun. It was kind of hard to tickle someone when you couldn't see your hand but the risk of him missing was worth it.
Silence hung in the air as the two men took each other in, caught up in the moment of serenity and peacefulness. Sherlock leant down slightly to place his violin on the table, before linking his hands around John's back.
It was a simple thing really, but Sherlock had blown it out of proportion and set about figuring out the best single seat in the entire cinema and how much they'd be allowed to drink so they didn't have to leave half way through. He wanted to pick a cinema that was near to Scotland Yard so if a case appeared they could leave quickly, but he also wanted a cinema far enough away that they wouldn't hear police cars every 5 minutes. John just sat watching him, feeling half annoyed and half amused by his boyfriends odd behavior. It was 7:00pm by the time Sherlock was done fussing they had already missed the showing of fantastic beasts, a film John had been dying to see since it came out, and collateral beauty, which had been recommended by Molly as it made her cry. But no, they'd missed both viewings.
"It doesn't matter, we need rules." John stated, only now finding it challenging to maintain eye contact with Sherlock as he felt as if his penetrating stare was actually burning holes in his eyes. Sherlock said nothing as he waited for John to state the terms of their 'study' but the doctor was finding it hard to focus as usually he could look away and think, but now he couldn't and sherlocks eyes currently took up 70% of his thoughts.
"Because I care about you a hell of a lot more than I should." John answered honestly, smiling slightly.
"Shh it's okay, I'm here. I've got you." John whispered, trying to calm the flow of tears now soaking through his jumper. He rubbed his back and pulled Sherlock completely into his lap, allowing him to wrap his legs around his waist and bury his sobs in his neck.
"How about we go and curl up in bed instead? You'll hurt your back if you sit here all day Bear." John said, using the pet name he reserved for Sherlock during moments like this. Sherlock nodded slightly and untangled himself, wiping his eyes on his sleeve as more tears started falling. John took his hand and pulled them both up, pausing to wipe a tear dripping down Sherlocks jaw away then leading him towards their bedroom. They climbed into bed after stripping down to their boxers and John pulled the cover over them both, entwining his legs with Sherlocks and allowing himself to be pulled closer. Sherlock allowed no space between them, his head resting on johns chest and their hands still joined beneath him. With his free hand John continued to play with Sherlocks hair, curling the black strands around his fingertips.
"So you mean... you don't know how to keep your heart from being broken?" John asked confused, trying to work his head around what Sherlock actually meant. Sherlock just stared at him, watching the cogs turning in John's brain.
Many described death as peaceful, a passing from one end to another beginning, a life cycle that can't be stopped or controlled or even predicted, however those who knew different walked with the weight on their shoulders that they were different. They knew what others refused to accept. Death wasn't peaceful, not for those whose life was stolen in a fallen heartbeat, crushed by the power of time combined with nature. Death stole from the virtuous and the poor, the guilty and the saviours. It didn't care what it left behind as long as the deed was done and the life that once shone radiantly with health and fortune was lost.
"Moriarty wanted to kill me, obviously. But he didn't want to do it at that very moment, even though he could have just made the call and no one would have ever known what happened. Instead he said... he said he wanted to burn me." Sherlock stared, zoning back in for a moment to check John was following.
"We both know that's not true. You saw what I was like when you came back, I never flinched when I saw you in a room like a normal person would if they saw someone supposedly dead. It was as if I was used to seeing you there, it was as if you'd never left." John replied.
"Do you even know how old I am?" John asked, slightly embarrassed he was almost 5 years older than him.
"You said I could distract you." John replied, moving his hand off sherlocks arm and lightly brushing his fingers against his stomach. Sherlock breathed in and a little sound escaped his mouth, making John smile.
"Well lets just suppose for a moment we are good for each other, what would you say then?" John questioned, his heart rate speeding up at where the conversation was heading.
"Well it changes everyday you see." John replied, earning himself a glare. Sherlock plucked the newspaper out his hand and turned his back to him, resting against johns side as he began to read. Johns arm was trapped beneath Sherlock awkwardly but he was afraid to move it in case the detective moved away, not allowing himself to consider why he liked Sherlock laying on him but letting himself enjoy it anyway.
"Sherlock, whatever it is Moriarty said Im not going to move out, I like it here and a sentence isn't going to change that." John said honestly, giving Sherlock a reassuring smile.
"But it's alright because I love you." John stated, grinning when he felt Sherlocks arm rest on his shoulder.
He clicked onto Sherlocks account and scrolled through his recent tweets, tutting at how unsubtle he was. They were yet to decide whether or not to tell their followers about their relationship status, however Sherlock was making his view on the matter more than clear.  Once he grew bored of this task he stood up and knocked on their bedroom door to alert Sherlock he was coming in, before pushing the door open and taking in his boyfriends form sprawled across the bed. He smiled at the tussled brown hair and beige dressing gown twisted around his middle, loving how he made their king size bed look small with his longs limbs.
"You amaze me." Sherlock replied, not knowing any better words to express how he felt for John Watson.
"You're upset aren't you. Something that happened at the pool upset you." John deduced, praying he was right otherwise he'd just be making a fool of himself in front of Sherlock. As suspected the consulting detective stood up quickly and stepped over the table, storming over to his seat and throwing himself down dramatically in the chair. John followed him and sat down in his armchair, meeting sherlocks eyes.
"But you were really staring at me, lost in thought but still grounded in reality enough to connect what you're seeing with your subconscious." Sherlock said, his voice still deep and intimidating but much softer than it was when he deduced others.
A sob escaped his lips as he took in the blood in his best friends hair, the blood on his hands, the blood coating his clothes and skin and eyelids and mind and soul and life and he couldn't bare to be so close to the putrid smell that triggered the part of his heart that he longed to be rid of. He collapsed back against the wall, clenching his eyes shut and yanking his shaking hands through his hair.
"The song you were singing, it's a duet isn't it?" John asked, recalling Mia and Sebastian sitting side by side at the piano; Sherlock hummed in reply.
"Promise." John stated, waiting anxiously for Sherlock to explain. Said man sighed and joined his hands together under his chin, staring at John but not really paying attention to him.
Once Sherlock had calmed down he pulled away slightly, keeping one hand on Sherlocks waist and using the other to wipe away his tears.
John dutifully recalled the events of the previous night to Mycroft, who promised he would look into Sherlock's mysterious disappearance. Now that Mycroft was involved John was slightly more relived, but still left the Diogenes Club in search of his friend. He spent all morning and afternoon searching, looking everywhere the detective might take refuge, even in some of the more unlikely places where he might be recognized, but he couldn't find him anywhere. Not even a trace. This discovery- or lack there of- didn't entirely surprise him. He assumed that if Sherlock didn't want to be found it was unlikely anyone would be able to track him down, but he was hoping that he had left some sort of clue for John to follow. He had come to him after all, surely he couldn't have assumed John was so drunk that he would forget the encounter completely. In his frantic state John didn't think to look for the detective in the place he'd always been, and would always come back to.
"I am fine, Molly. Thank you for your concern." He was expecting her to come along at some point. Lestrade or John must have informed her of what happened and he knew that Molly would not be satisfied with second-hand news, not when it came to Sherlock.
By the end of the day, and after hours spent watching Sherlock observe, experiment and deduce, the case was finally solved. John could see how happy Sherlock was to be back to work. There was a spark in his eye and unmistakable confidence in his every word- not that Sherlock was self-conscious, but he became more self-assured when working, more energized, more intense.
“Did you like that?” Sherlock asked with a smirk. He gave John’s cock one long, slow stroke and watched as the doctor’s eyes practically rolled back in his head.
Sherlock had always kept things from his own life private, but John had finally found out when his birthday was and had made a point to remember so that they could both celebrate it quietly the next year, knowing that Sherlock would be opposed to any large gatherings. They had even made plans for what they were going to do. And now here he was a year later, celebrating all by himself.
John couldn't help but grin. He'd always considered himself a capable doctor but he felt extremely pleased whenever Sherlock complimented him- or did something as close to complimenting as Sherlock Holmes could. It made him feel special, mostly because Sherlock rarely commented on anyone else's intelligence or capability unless he was insulting them. But there was something incredible about how certain Sherlock sounded whenever he said anything like that. "Fine," he huffed, "but you're doing everything I tell you to."
As soon as the door to their flat was open Sherlock disappeared into the bathroom and John stood rather nervously by his chair waiting for him to return. Even though he wasn’t expecting anything in return he had gotten Sherlock a present and he was slightly worried that the detective wouldn’t think much of it.
Arriving home he noted that Sherlock was suspiciously absent from the living room and a search of the rest of the house showed that he wasn't there either. After getting his laptop to update his blog John text him.
Lauren looked over at him for a few seconds, trying to work out if he was in the right state of mind to be doing anything. “Are you John?”
“What now?” Sherlock snapped. John looked affronted for a moment before Sherlock seemed to realise what he’d said and went over to John and wrapped his arms around him. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you.”
It was clear that Lestrade wasn't convinced, but John breathed out a sigh of relief when detective inspector dropped the subject. "So, did you find Sherlock then?" he asked, a note of hope in his voice. He may have seemed sceptical on the phone but it was clear that Lestrade wanted John to be right about Sherlock being alive as much as John did.
They sat happily watching telly and sipping their tea, both glad to finally be home together. Sherlock had snuggled under John's arm with a blanket spread over him.
The insecurity in Sherlock's voice pulled at John's heartstrings. He'd been angry at first, when he realized the deception of Sherlock's so called suicide, but even so, how could he be angry at him after everything he'd done? After everything he'd sacrificed and the time he'd spent away from everyone, roaming the world alone looking for Moriarty's men to keep them safe. He couldn't be angry at him. It was never something he'd been good at before either. He'd been frustrated a lot, that was a certainty, but not angry. And not now, now that he knew what had happened. Now that he understood.
At seeing John’s clear eyes and hearing his voice Sherlock’s resolve broke. He collapsed on top of John, burying his head in John’s chest and wrapping his arms around the man as well as he could in their position. John was still a little confused but it was obvious that Sherlock was upset, so he did what he could to try to make him feel better.
"I know," Sherlock replied, confident in the knowledge that John would always be there to pull him back from the edge.
He quickly fired off a text to Mycroft telling him who the culprit was and then ventured into the bathroom. It was full of steam, no doubt due to the fact that John insisted on taking scolding hot showers. Sherlock started undressing, having decided to join him.
But Sherlock didn't listen, he pushed through the discomfort of having his arm freed, lined himself up with John and lowered John's hips until he was sheathed inside him.
John was silently cataloguing Sherlock’s symptoms hoping to figure out exactly what was wrong, though no overly concerning symptoms had presented themselves as of yet. “We should go to bed.”
He turned around to find Mrs Hudson standing by her door, clearly having been woken up by the noise he and Sherlock were making. "Did we wake you up, Mrs Hudson? I'm so sorry."
“Sherlock, just wait a minute.” John was trying not to lose his balance as he kicked the door shut, but Sherlock continued pushing them together.
John dropped down in front of him, cleaned him up and then lay him down across the bed. “How’s your head?”
After John calmed down Lestrade helped him over to the sofa and lay him down on his side, covering him with a blanket. He tried to disentangle Sherlock's scarf from John's hands where he'd been clutching it tightly but John wouldn't let go. He was holding on to it as if his life depended on it and he kept whispering, "I'll be back. I'll be back."
Sherlock only nodded. He didn't like to admit his weaknesses if he didn't have to, but he knew there was no point in lying to John.
John couldn’t help but smile at the look of excitement on the detective’s face and the spring in his step as he went to his old room to gather everything he needed.
"Before you start sulking, no, John didn't tell me. My observational skills aren't as non-existent as you seem to believe. But that's beside the point," Lestrade continued, "You need to be honest with him, and you need to let him take care of you. He's been sitting at your bedside for nearly three days now, I only managed to get him to go home a few hours a go."
His worry had started to lessen a few weeks after his return seeing as John seemed happy with the way their relationship was going, but the niggling worry was always in the back of his mind.
Lestrade was standing over him with his hand on his shoulder and wearing a concerned look on his face. "Are you alright, John?"
Sherlock grabbed him by the back of the neck and crushed their lips together. As he did so he finally managed to meet John’s thrust with his own and their screams of pleasure were muffled by the other’s mouth.
He watched as John reached his hand out slowly towards him and lightly stroked Sherlock’s forehead, the gesture bringing a heaving sigh of relief with it.
"Sherlock Holmes, if you ever, ever, show such a blatant disregard for your body and its needs that you pass out again I will personally tie you to a chair every single morning to ensure that you eat a nice big breakfast before your brain can even think about a case. Is that understood?"
Sherlock looked up when he heard John. There was something in his voice. Sherlock tried to deduce what it was but John’s expression gave nothing away. He cleared his throat nervously. “Of course, you are a doctor after all.”
Somehow he managed to slip off Sherlock, who grunted mildly in discomfort. He then pushed himself off the detective and lay beside him reaching his hand out to Sherlock's who was still holding onto the headboard. Sherlock let go once he realized what he was doing and accepted John's hand.
He had stored all the memories of the wedding in John’s room in his mind palace, cherishing them forever. He had never deleted anything that pertained to John in any way, especially time that they had spent together, but this held a special place for him. Whenever he saw John’s wedding ring or his own, or their suits placed carefully in the closet, or the photo album Molly had so kindly organised for them all the memories came rushing back and he felt a swell of happiness.
"Hello, John," Lestrade stammered out, as shocked at John but for a completely different reason, "Where uhh... where's your shirt?" he asked hesitantly.
He went over to the kitchen and prepared two mugs of tea. When he came back into the living room John was in the exact same position. He put the mugs down on the table and shook John’s shoulder slightly.
Once at Baker Street John was able to minimize the amount of fussing from Mrs Hudson before they made their up to their flat. The first thing Sherlock did when he got there was put the kettle on but as he was taking two mugs out of the cupboard John slapped his hand away and led him over to the sofa.
He grabbed Sherlock's hand and brought it up to his mouth where he started sucking Sherlock's fingers. Sherlock gasped, clearly picturing John's tongue working away at something else. While Sherlock was distracted John started undoing his shirt, slowly revealing Sherlock's chest to him.
Life was never quiet or predictable when living with Sherlock Holmes, and most definitely not when sleeping with him, and John thought that he secretly liked it. Liked to be kept on his toes, not knowing what was going to happen, though he could definitely go without any more injuries or accidents for a life time. Sherlock's accident may not have caused that much damage but John had still been scared to lose him. Still was, on a daily basis, and he suspected Sherlock was too. But that was their life, and they would never give it up for anything.
He'd cried the first night, unable to keep his emotions in check. He'd cried with the relief of seeing Sherlock alive and the pain of not seeing him awake. For the short few moments between the doctor's arrival and his revelation of Sherlock's state John had thought that the news were going to be terrible. That Sherlock might not have survived, that he'd suffered irreparable damage, or that he would never wake up again. He winced when the doctor told them all of Sherlock's injuries; concussion, broken ribs, punctured lung, broken arm, dislocated shoulder and a wide array of bruises of his back and side where he had taken on most of the impact.
Sherlock ran up the stairs to 221B, John following close behind him. After the case was solved they had gone to Angelo's for dinner and then walked back to Baker Street. As tired as John was from the day's work he didn't think he would be able to go to sleep now, and he was sure that Sherlock would not be able to either.
Sherlock's eyes roamed the scene before finally settling on John and narrowed in confusion again. John was getting more and more worried about the state he was in, it was clear he had a concussion, though John was unsure of the severity. He had to keep him awake and talking. "What happened?"
"I can't calm down, I need to do something." Sherlock finally took off his coat and scarf and threw them unceremoniously over his chair, then stalked off to his room. John didn't even have time to question what exactly he was doing when the detective came into the kitchen balancing his microscope dangerously with only one hand. He went to his room a few more times to retrieve microscope slides and other substances that John didn't want to think about.
Matt counted Sherlock’s respiratory rate, unhappy with the results he had. “He’s in respiratory distress; he’s tachypnoeic and cyanotic. Do you want the cannulation kit?”
John looked at him with a dubious expression on his face. “Do you remember what happened last time you tried to cook something?”
The water running down his front had now removed all the shower gel John had carefully applied. "I guess we're done here then," John said teasingly.
The detective examined John quickly, coming to the conclusion that he probably only had a minor concussion. Nevertheless John needed to go to the hospital.
Sherlock laughed and nodded in agreement, then reached his hand out behind John's neck and John placed it on Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock didn’t protest when John held his hand and pulled him towards their room, which was Sherlock’s old one. John tried changing into his pyjamas but as soon as he got rid of his clothes the detective didn’t let him put anything else on.
Back in the real world Sherlock’s clock was going off. He managed to rouse himself from sleep quite quickly and looked down at John. The doctor was sleeping peacefully, arms wrapped around Sherlock’s waist and head resting just under Sherlock’s chin. Suddenly he gave a contented sigh and a small smile played across his lips. Sherlock felt a smile of his own coming on and suddenly he didn’t want to wake John up, but he knew he had to.
“I just…” Sherlock stammered, unsure of how to reply, “I didn’t know if it was something you’d want, much less with me. But… I thought that it would be better to ask and have you say no than to wonder what your answer would have been.”
The paramedics shared a look between them, silently deciding that it would be best to keep John busy. Besides, it was always helpful to have an extra set of hands, especially from someone who knew what they were doing. “Monitor his GCS, keep talking to him,” Matt said. He looked at Lauren, “I’ll take over ventilating.”
John came home later than usual on Friday and was ready for another round of brilliant deductions from Sherlock when he noticed that the detective was actually asleep on the sofa. He had his head thrown back over the edge and his hand was hanging over the side, papers spilled all over the floor where he had dropped them. It was no surprise, he had been working non-stop for the past few days, barely taking a break to eat or sleep.
"I don't know," John shrugged, "where have you been for the past seven months?" His response was sharper than he had anticipated, but it had to come out sooner or later. He hoped Sherlock wouldn't close up like he usually did when they were discussing anything that didn't pertain to a case because they needed to talk about this.John needed to know, for his own peace of mind.
The doctor asked both John and Lestrade to leave whilst he examined Sherlock. John left with a promise to return as soon as he was allowed and left with Lestrade in search of some coffee. They sat quietly sipping their drinks before Lestrade finally broke the silence.
He sat down on his chair and looked longingly at the one across from it. He felt his heart clench at the thought that it would never be filled again. There would be no more dashing off at a moment's notice, no more experiments in the fridge and no more violin playing at night when he was trying to sleep; there was just silence. He continued to smoke, attempting to blow smoke rings as he had sometimes seen Sherlock do. Once he'd finished it he stubbed it out on the ashtray that Sherlock had stolen from Buckingham Palace.
That prompted John to take control. He moves and starting pushing his feet down on the mattress which allowed him to control the thrusts and he barely felt Sherlock moving now. He was too far gone, desperate for release, overwhelmed with pleasure. When John felt the burning heat boiling inside him he clamped his mouth down on Sherlock's neck, muffling his cries as he lost control.
But Sherlock didn't seem to hear him. He was still thrashing in his sleep and now ran the risk of hurting John as well as himself. Sherlock was becoming hoarse from all the shouting and the sheets were getting more and more tangled around him. Short of throwing a bucket of cold water over him John was running out of options.
John grinned, but complied. This time Sherlock was the one who grabbed him and deepened the kiss. Their tongues merged together, hands struggled to find a place to rest and their eyes shut tightly against the floodgate of emotions a simple kiss between them could bring. So many times it had been a reassurance that they were both okay. Whether it was after nearly dying, or an injury, or a nightmare, it had become a big part of their relationship; the need to reassure themselves that they were there, in one piece, and together.
The next thing he knew something was being enclosed around his neck. There were hands gently touching him and he felt something rigid underneath him. The warmth was gone and he tried to protest, but his one feeble attempt was cut off by a bout of coughing which left him clutching at his chest and wheezing.
"Mycroft," Sherlock called out, looking at his brother, unsure of how to show his gratitude without seeming overly sentimental, "thank you," he added sincerely.
Sherlock couldn’t respond, but he tried lifting his hand up to squeeze John’s. He didn’t quite manage it, but John saw, and knew what he was trying to say. John always understood him.
It seemed Sherlock had not been the only one in need of some rest. As John awakened from his short slumber on the sofa he glanced over at the kitchen where the detective had been looking down his microscope just moments a go. Now, however, he was stretched across the table, his head resting on his arms, having finally succumbed to sleep. John walked over quietly and leaned over him.
John bowed his head down slightly and laid a soft kiss on Sherlock's lips. "Up you get, we have a case."
"I'm pretty sure the intent is there, Sherlock, but things happen, people change, I suppose. I'm not making excuses for them, much less for murder, but not everything works out the way people expect it to."
When no response was forthcoming he immediately sat up. His worried gaze settled on the usually pale detective noting how Sherlock seemed completely drained of colour now. His pulse was visibly elevated and he swayed slightly, at which point John grabbed him by the shoulders to make sure he didn't fall off the bed and hurt himself.
A nurse had come in a couple of times while Lestrade was there, only to check Sherlock's vitals and leave once again. He hadn't asked her if there had been any progress because John had pestered the entire staff enough in the two days he had spent here. Every time he asked they would say the same thing, that they could only tell if there had been any lasting damage once Sherlock woke up, which he should do soon. But John, seeing no progress, had continued asking them if they were going to do anything until they had to threaten to kick him out, regardless of Mycroft's influence.
Sherlock tried shrugging nonchalantly. “I thought they might come in handy at some point.” He didn’t want to admit that he’d had them for weeks now, and had been hoping for this exact outcome.
John hummed in agreement and attacked Sherlock’s lips once again. They lay on the sofa for a good half an hour kissing and cuddling until John sat back up and brought his hand up to the bandage on his head.
Sherlock only nodded and shut his eyes once again. He was beyond exhausted, and his chest was killing him. He could feel the oxygen flowing into his burning lungs, and it was the best feeling he could imagine. Beside him, John watched as the mask fogged with each breath he took. He tried to stop himself from constantly watching Sherlock’s breathing, but after seeing him so still and lifeless, it was almost impossible.
Lestrade seemed to accept the facts easily enough- it wasn’t the most surprising thing he’d come to find at a crime scene- and watched as Sherlock supported John and they walked slowly towards the road. “Where are you going?”
"I'll bring it up in half an hour," she shouted from her flat and John thought it best not to argue anymore. She had been worried sick as well. Mycroft had to be the one to tell Mrs Hudson what had happened because John hadn't had the heart to, not again. After Sherlock's death John had been the one to tell Mrs Hudson and he couldn't bring himself to inform her this time.
There were times when he tried to articulate his feelings. He succeeded on occasion but more often than not he simply enveloped John in his arms, as if he could transfer all his feelings for the man by touch. He used his lips, his hands, every part of his body to ensure John knew he was treasured and loved. He wanted him to know how grateful he was for having John in his life. John who always followed, John who always worried about how little he'd eaten and slept, much like he had last night, and so Sherlock decided to show his appreciation as best as he could.
As soon as Sherlock woke up he was going to eat and take a day off. His body needed to recharge after being neglected for so long and John was going to make sure nothing like this ever happened again. Not only was it extremely worrying that Sherlock's blood sugar had been low enough that he actually passed out, the circumstances under which it happened were rather embarrassing for the detective.
John was so relieved to see Sherlock awake and talking that he just sat there staring at him for a few good seconds. He never thought he'd get tired of the view, not after all the time he spent looking at an unconscious and unresponsive Sherlock. The detective seemed unperturbed by the scrutiny and instead gazed back at John with the same intensity.
"You needed to get it out, Sherlock. You needed to talk about it and from now on it'll be easier, you'll see. I'm not saying it's all magically going to go away, that's not how things work, but I'm here. I know what it's like to watch innocent lives being taken in front of you; I know what it's like to feel guilty. And it's no use. The fault should lie with those who committed these horrible acts, not with those who tried to stop them. Please believe me."
"Certainly not," Sherlock said as he walked towards the house, Lestrade and John already ahead of him.
“Fuuuck, Sherlock,” John moaned. “I mean it.” He took a steadying breath and tried to calm himself down, but they were both too keyed up.
Sherlock’s right arm was stretched across the bed beneath the crook of John’s neck and his left arm was wrapped around John’s waist. He took the opportunity to wrap his hand around Sherlock’s and bring it close to his chest. He felt the smooth metal of his husband’s wedding ring, placed in Sherlock’s elegant and long finger by John.
John, deciding it was too early to try to go back to sleep again, simply spent the next few hours watching Sherlock peacefully asleep and running his hands through his hair. At about 8am Sherlock started stirring again and finally opened his eyes.
Finally realising how long he’d spent under the shower Sherlock turned off the water and got out, wrapping a towel around himself. As he made his way up the stairs to their room he saw John walking down towards the kitchen, no doubt on his way to make breakfast. Sherlock sneaked in a quick kiss before John left and then made his way to their room and quickly got dressed.
"Young enough." John reasoned, pressing closer to Sherlock still. After a few comfortable minutes of silence he suddenly felt a wetness on his shoulder and realised Sherlock was crying. At first they were little tears, but they soon turned into sobs that shook his body and hurt John just as much.
"They even have a website, people really do have no better way to spend their time." John commented, stifling a yawn mid-sentence.
"I find them quite fustrating to be perfectly honest." Sherlock stated, tingles going across his neck as John brushed against it with his fingertips.
"Friend." Sherlock said immediately, but John knew why. She's had a thing for Sherlock for as long as John's known her.
"Then why were you crying?" Sherlock asked, obviously not missing John's teary eyes from a few moments ago.
"Hey Sherlock?" John called from the kitchen whilst stirring the milk into his tea and absentmindedly tapping his foot.
"For- for telling me to stop bring such a coward and live my life, for t-telling me to come out to you and then... l-later on telling me to do it again. For telling me how proud she was that I'd found you." Sherlock chocked, his voice breaking half way through. Tears welled in Johns eyes too as he remembered the look of pride on her face as Sherlock walked down the aisle last year.
"I know, I kind of googled it when I couldn't figure out what colour they were." John admitted, grinning sheepishly.
"The only thing you do condemn is you winning, how long has it been?" John asked, opening his eyes to peer around the room for a clock he knew wasn't there.
"You asked whether they were a friend or lover, so my response is it depends who you ask." Sherlock repeated, looking exasperated with John's slowness.
"I'm always unreasonable, I thought you would have caught on to that by now, or perhaps I overestimated your abilities in deduction." Sherlock replied, looking grumpy. John suspected something was bothering him, he only ever got defensive when he was upset.
"Yeah?" John replied, smiling at how cute Sherlock sounded when he was in a situation he didn't quite understand.
"And I couldn't let you die." John replied, wondering how he'd move the conversation onto the bigger picture.
That moment when everyone's excited because it's Friday, but for you it's just a day between cases...
"What do you want?" Sherlock asked in his deep voice. John frowned thinking about what to say, his temper flaring in annoyance.
WARNINGS: Slight mention of war wounds, subtle talk of suicide, but mostly just a whole lotta eye contact ^-^
"I know that, I'm just glad I moved in and got to know you, the real you. The one who's ticklish and idiotic and brilliant, even though you think putting thumbs in our fridge is a good idea." John said, watching Sherlocks eyes crease in the corners as he smiled.
"City of stars, are you shining just for me? City of stars..." John finished his part, watching as Sherlock played the last note before singing to the silence.
"I wanted you to run at the pool." John said, thinking they may as well go back to the beginning and slowly work their way forward. Sherlock looked at a point just above John's eyes.
"Stop saying I, you aren't him, you aren't real you aren't him you aren't him." Sherlock said, his voice raising slightly and his vision going blurry. The not-John lent in closer so Sherlock could see him even through his tears.
"A look in somebody's eyes, to light up the skies. To open the world and send it reeling," they sang, and despite the fact Sherlock was still playing John wrapped his arms around his boyfriends waist anyway, swaying them side to side.
"You looked away and the rules are whoever looks away first loses." John replied, maintaining eye contact with Sherlock just in case he somehow manipulated the rules.
"What did you feel when you knew Moriarty knew?" He asked, curious to know the answer himself but also knowing it was important for Sherlock to understand.
"City of stars, are you shining just for me?" John sang softly, looking up into Sherlocks eyes which seemed to sparkle in the light.
Sherlock never really considered what John had done to get over his death, but now above all else he wished he could just ask the man one last question.
"Improbable, but the same rule applies reversed." John accepted this and nodded slightly, his attention focusing solely back on sherlocks eyes. When you focused on something for too long it became something else entirely, and since they had first made eye contact it was like they were seeing each other in a new light. Johns neck was aching slightly from looking down but he didn't notice, he only saw Sherlock and Sherlock only.
"She wore jumpers all the time too." Sherlock said quietly, not needing to elaborate for John to know who he's referring to.
"I'm sorry if it's not my place to say but you two are such a cute couple." She said awkwardly, smiling at them both as she counted out the change.
"It was fate Sherlock. Remember, you were always written to end up alone." He whispered, and suddenly the John next to him was covered in blood, a hole where his heart should be yet his face still twisted in a smile. Sherlock flinched away and clenched his eyes shut, knowing what he saw wasn't real but the wounds on John's real body were. That wasn't the John he knew, the one he loved, that was the damaged version who whispered words only Sherlocks brain could come up with.
"You've missed this, haven't you?" John asked between kisses, noting how responsive Sherlock was to his every touch.
He strode towards John and wrapped his arms around the doctor’s waist before bringing their lips together in a deep kiss, tongues venturing out, deepening the kiss, prolonging the pleasure. John responded quickly, tilting his head to give Sherlock better access and cupping the detective’s face in his hands.
“I don’t think I could either,” John admitted. He didn’t want to rush things, especially with this being Sherlock’s first time, but he couldn’t hold out much longer when he had Sherlock spread open right in front of him.
As soon as Matt came back, carrying a backboard and plenty of blankets in his arms, 221B went into a frenzy. Mrs Hudson had been sent to put together a bag of Sherlock’s clothes and medications, John gathered up the paramedics’ equipment and Lauren untangled all the wires so that they could slide the backboard behind Sherlock.
John was left standing by the door wondering when exactly Greg had become such a close friend. He was glad for it, of course, especially at a time like this, but it still surprised him how much Sherlock had come to accept Greg as well. The detective wasn’t exactly known for being fond of people- John and Mrs Hudson aside- but clearly there was something about Greg that Sherlock just seemed to accept.
John smiled down at the detective. He knew exactly why Sherlock was asking him to stay and he couldn't argue that Sherlock's presence would also be helpful in keeping his own dreams away. "I would, Sherlock, but I don't know if you've noticed but you have a chest tube coming out of your body."
"I would like a shower," replied Sherlock as he got up off the bed and made his way downstairs, John following close behind.
"It wasn't enough, I know," Sherlock continued, "But it was the best I could do under the circumstances, and I'm sorry about everything I put you through, John. I never meant to hurt you. I didn't mean for any of this to happen but I didn't have another choice..."
After a short relay of the facts John deemed the case a 7 which would hopefully get Sherlock out of bed and to the crime scene. He should have known it would never be that easy.
John moved up further until his mouth was lined up to Sherlock's ear. He moved his hands to the front of Sherlock's dressing gown, which had been knotted at some point, and started undoing it whilst whispering softly.
Just as Sherlock had suspected John only had a minor concussion and the only thing he needed was rest and for Sherlock to make sure to wake him up every couple of hours.
As per usual the first thing they did was remove their jackets and put the kettle on. John kept rubbing at his back, but it was a difficult spot to reach. He took a couple of tablets for the pain, hoping that they would actually help, and prepared their tea.
His phone was on the table along with an empty mug of tea. He walked over, pulled the folded blanket from under John's feet and draped it over his sleeping form. He laid a soft kiss on John's forehead but it seemed that was enough to wake him up.
John looked behind him and spotted none other than Mrs Hudson calmly walking out of her flat. He felt all the blood rushing to his cheeks and quickly tried to compose himself.
John chuckled, unfazed by Sherlock’s words, and sat down next to the grumbling detective in a scarce patch of emptiness on the bed. “Come on, get up. We have a case.”
John moved forward once again, on his hands and knees, and crawled forward until he was close to Sherlock. He closed the small gap between them and joined his lips to Sherlock's, tongues playing out, small nips being delivered. While John was distracted Sherlock's hand snuck into the drawer and he took out the lube. He coated his left hand with it and dropped it on the floor and then brought his hand between John's legs.
Thursday came and Sherlock didn't stir when John kissed him goodbye, even though he was actually awake.
In a split second the room was filled with laughter. Sherlock was so relieved and so happy that anything could make him laugh right now, but the sound of John’s laughter seemed to propel his own to continue and suddenly he couldn’t stop. He laughed with joy and happiness and relief and excitement. John did the same, his brain only now catching up with the reality that he was engaged to the man he loved.
John was about to say 'I told you so' but didn't even have time to get the words out before the detective's eyes rolled back in his head and he suddenly went limp. John cursed under his breath and lay Sherlock down gently on the bed, covering him up with his dressing gown. He removed the pillow from underneath his head and placed it instead under his feet. He hoped Sherlock would regain consciousness quickly; he should have given him something to eat the night before, but he looked so tired that John wanted nothing more than to let him sleep and this morning he had been a little too distracted to try to force Sherlock to eat his breakfast.
"Not if you keep doing that you're not," John said, worried that Sherlock would dislocate something. "You know you really should go to physiotherapy, right?"
Sherlock started slowly divesting John of his clothes. He started with the jumper and shirt, leaving a trail of kisses down John’s chest until he reached his trousers, at which point he undid the belt and started lowering them down John’s legs. John, in turn, toed off his shoes so that Sherlock could get his trousers past his ankles. After removing his socks John applied the same treatment to Sherlock until they were both completely naked.
They both sat down and dug into their food. John was starving since he hadn't had much time to eat today and seeing as he himself was planning on making something for dinner he hadn't eaten on the way home either. Sherlock was also hungry and they barely said anything while they ate. John broke the silence a couple of times to congratulate Sherlock once again on his cooking and his ability to keep everything from John.
“John,” he called out quietly, shaking John’s shoulder and running his fingers up and down his arm, but John gave no sign that he heard him and just continued dreaming.
He walked slowly up the stairs to his room, supporting himself on the banister. He was completely exhausted. He'd certainly missed running around London with Sherlock, but running around London after a Sherlock who clearly didn't want to be found and without being able to actually ask anyone if they'd seen the detective on account of him being dead and all had drained all the energy out of him. At least the exhaustion would keep the nightmares away. But when John finally entered his room he realized he might be facing a different problem altogether.
He brought his hands up and gently laid them on either side of Sherlock’s head, bringing it up so that the detective was looking him in the eye. After a chaste kiss and another short cuddle Sherlock seemed capable of speech once again.
John broke the kisses and brought his hands up to Sherlock's back, trying to be gentle as he examined the bruising, but there were times when Sherlock still hissed in pain. Whenever that happened John lightened his touch and ran his tongue over Sherlock's neck to keep him distracted. When he was finally satisfied that the bruises were healing as well as they should he settled the dressing gown over Sherlock again and gently wrapped his arms around the detective.
Sherlock had not only made the first step but he had since then taken extra precautions to ensure he never neglected John. He was always very much aware of where John was. He tried to take better care of himself, though that didn't always go the way he wanted it to, so that John wouldn't have to worry as much. And most of all he tried to make sure John knew how Sherlock felt about him. That was the most important thing. John had to know that Sherlock was better now that he had him in his life. A better detective, but most importantly a better person.
John was keeping a very close eye on Sherlock who was picking at his food dismally, more so than usual, which was strange especially when he hadn’t eaten properly in days.
He looked out the window and the darkness told him that some time had passed since what he now recognised to have been the ambulance ride to the hospital.
While he sat in silence he finally thought about the repercussions that the last few months had on Sherlock. John had felt alone after Sherlock's 'death', but he had other people with him. Regardless how difficult their relationship had been Harry had helped him through Sherlock's absence to the best of her ability as had Mrs Hudson and Lestrade. John had pushed everyone else away, regardless of their insistence that they could help and that he needed to talk about it. His therapist had been useless, as usual, and eventually John decided that he didn't need to waste his time with her anymore. He had instead allowed other people in, not too much, but more than he usually would and after a while he had felt slightly better, but never whole. Not until Sherlock came back.
"Still with me?" he asked, but John only grunted in return, he would be asleep in less than five minutes. Sherlock got off the bed and went downstairs to fetch a heat pack and a towel which he promptly brought over to the room.
The man who claimed not to feel, the self-proclaimed sociopath, felt things deeper than anyone else. The man who claimed to only have one friend had sacrificed himself for the life of three. The man who closed himself off from everyone had opened himself up to one entirely and unconditionally.
Sherlock then started sliding down until his head was right between John's legs and John had to hold on to the headboard when Sherlock's tongue slid out.
John felt Sherlock stirring against him, bringing John back to the present moment. The detective curled up slightly in bed, bringing the two of them closer together.
“Nothing, we were just cuddling and you were running your fingers up and down my arm and that was it. It was just nice.”
John continued rubbing his neck for a few more minutes before getting up to make dinner. “Does this mean you’ll actually come to bed with me tonight then?” John asked from the kitchen.
"Yeah, probably just hasn't eaten the whole day. It's why I didn't want him working any cases yet in the first place."
He had come to Baker Street specifically to leave Sherlock the case files after John text him desperately asking for them before Sherlock started shooting the walls in boredom.
Sherlock was used to fighting his body when it came to sleep but he could only fight it for so long, and when he finally gave in he was dragged under until his body was satisfied it didn't need any more rest. Even after he woke up from his 'post-case crash' he felt sluggish and slow, his body and mind still recovering from the overload and slowly returning to normal again. He was glad to have John with him at times like these- he was glad to have John with him all the time- because he always knew exactly what Sherlock needed. A day spent quietly in bed eating, talking, dozing off and just generally recovering to his normal hyper-aware and accelerated state of being. And what Sherlock needed John provided.
“Wait, there was more,” Sherlock said, squinting his eyes in John’s direction. “You were there, too. At least I think you were. Could’ve just been in my head though. You often are.”
Sherlock arrived a few seconds afterwards. He was dressed in his suit with his usual purple shirt- John's favourite- but no suit jacket, probably due to his cast. His hair was neatly arranged, not the usual disarray of curls and he was smiling nervously at John.
Stubborn as always Sherlock sat up as soon as John let go of his hand. He grabbed the dressing gown that was currently draped over his body and put it on properly before turning to look at John, who was still very much naked.
“Husband,” Sherlock and John corrected at the exact same time. Anderson looked shocked for a moment before looking down at their fingers and seeing the silver rings encompassing them. They hadn’t made an effort to hide them, but aside from Lestrade they hadn’t told anyone at the Yard.
“God, yes.” John carefully draped himself over Sherlock and started exploring the detective’s chest. His hands roamed over every exposed bit of skin and his tongue followed closely behind.
He came straight over to Sherlock who had been sitting in his chair visiting his mind palace and his plans for tomorrow. He sat down on Sherlock’s lap and brought his hands up and over Sherlock’s shoulders, embracing him. He laid his head down on the crook of Sherlock’s neck and planted a soft kiss there.
John leaned over Sherlock and laid a gentle kiss on his lips at the same time as his finger entered Sherlock. He felt the detective taking in a shuddering breath beneath him.
Sherlock had never been one for nightmares, luckily, but John knew exactly what it was like to wake up still feeling the remnants of the dream wrapped around you, unsure of what was real and what was not. “I’m right here, Sherlock, and I’m awake, see? I’m fine.”
Sherlock grabbed him by the back of the neck and pulled him in for a long kiss. John wasn't one for public displays of affection but after days spent sleeping alone and barely talking to Sherlock he was glad to have his detective back.
When he got there Sherlock was already asleep. He discarded his clothes and put on his pyjamas and then slipped into bed. As soon as he was lying on his side of the bed he felt Sherlock shuffle over and nudge his head against John. Even in sleep, Sherlock always sought John out of comfort. He lifted his arm up, allowing Sherlock to lay his head on John's shoulder. John then started rubbing small circles on Sherlock's back, and so they both blissfully slipped into unconsciousness.
The night went surprisingly well, Sherlock- mostly- refraining from deducing all of John's friends and even having a couple of drinks with them. John had more than a couple, but he wasn't quite drunk yet. Nevertheless he missed Sherlock and as soon as they breached the threshold of 221 Baker Street John had him up against the wall.
He still struggled to accept the fact that Sherlock had killed himself. There had been no signs, but then it was always difficult to tell with Sherlock, the man who hid his emotions behind a mask and never let anyone in. It had been clear to John though, that Sherlock had been growing more and more agitated as the case wore on. The man who always kept his emotions in check had snapped at the mere thought that John had been taken in by Moriarty's lie, but he never should have doubted John's loyalty. It had been tested time and time again, from the very beginning to the very end. Only the day after they met John had killed someone to protect Sherlock and he would've sacrificed himself at the pool had it meant that Sherlock got to live. But in turned out that, in the end, the only person John needed to protect Sherlock from was himself.
Sherlock stood open mouthed for a few seconds before returning the pressure of his brother's hug. When they broke off he was surprised to see that Mycroft was smiling.
It was clear that John was unhappy with the plan but he complied anyway. He paced the length of the room over and over again until he felt a buzzing in his trouser pocket; a text from Lestrade.
They strolled out of the cab and John leaned slightly on Sherlock as they made their way to the door, something the detective didn't miss.
"Enjoying that, are you?" Sherlock asked as he worked his finger in and out of John. He moved slowly- agonizingly slowly- until John had to keep pushing back to try to get more of him, but he kept pushing his finger back out of John's reach.
Lestrade's face took on a rather strange look. Some combination between surprise, happiness and relief. "Where is he?"
"Good. Now lie on the bed, stomach down, and close your eyes." He waited a few seconds until he heard the rustling stop. "Have you done it?"
It wasn’t a full minute later when John was leaning over Sherlock’s writhing form, two fingers deep inside him, while he kissed the detective thoroughly from lips all the way down to his chest over and over again.
He went downstairs to see who was at the door and was surprised to see Mycroft. Sherlock hadn't actually visited his brother yet but the newspapers and a well-placed text by John had informed Mycroft that his brother was back at Baker Street.
When John arrived he gave Lestrade a pleading look, hoping that the detective inspector wouldn’t make a big deal out of it.
As Sherlock pondered that, John tried to replace the images that had been stuck in his head for the last few days.
John laid back on the sofa and held Sherlock against him, their hands held together over Sherlock’s chest, as though they had always belonged there.
“Did you see his face?” Lestrade asked, still laughing. “I thought he wasn’t going to move, he looked so shocked.”
In truth, there was nothing else in Sherlock’s mind but John. And he drew on every emotion, every feeling and thought and memory and he played. He played for John like he’d never played for anyone before, exposing himself and everything he was feeling, hoping to convey in music the thoughts that he sometimes couldn’t convey in words.
The kettle clicked off at that point and John moved over to the counter to fill their mugs with water. Sherlock was quickly behind him, wrapping his arms around John once again, bringing them together at the front in line with the mugs. Once John put the water in, squeezed and took out the teabags Sherlock added the milk and did one final stir. Soon enough their tea was ready and they moved over to the sofa.
He left the ice pack on for a few more minutes before removing it and bringing the covers up to Sherlock's chest. He ran his hands through the detective's curls and kissed the top of his head before leaning back on his own pillow.
John grinned at Sherlock who seemed to be over Anderson’s comment after seeing the look on his face. The detective smiled back at John and got back to work.
John’s head hung close to Sherlock’s, lingering closer and closer until he lay a quick kiss on the detective’s lips. “You okay?
Later on at night, after they both got ready for bed, John prepared a glass of water and Sherlock's medication and laid it out on the bedside table. Sherlock himself was sprawled out on the bed, eyes closed, but it was obvious he wasn't asleep. John crawled on top of the bed over to Sherlock. He started leaving a soft trail of kisses down Sherlock's exposed chest, all the way up to his neck again and gave Sherlock's lips one deep long kiss.
Shock and surprise passed over Mycroft's face once again before his expression settled on something much more amiable; happiness. He had always felt that John Watson had been a sort of blessing in Sherlock's life, someone he could depend on to help him look after his little brother, and he had not been mistaken. That Sherlock was finally realizing how much John meant to him and was actually doing something about made him feel extremely pleased.
Sherlock spent the next half an hour biting into a pillow and grasping the bedsheets as he tried to control the moans and groans that threatened to be pulled out of him by the sheer power of John's mouth. It seemed the doctor had taken quite a liking to a particular part of Sherlock's anatomy and he was determined to make Sherlock pay for his comment about John's endurance.
They had gone the long way around back to the flat, and John was satisfied with an anniversary well spent. There had been no emergency calls or cases, which was surprising, but a welcome reprise. He had a sneaky suspicion that Sherlock had ensured they would be left alone.
“Glad I could be of service,” John replied. He sat up on the bed, carefully pushing Sherlock out of his lap and they both stood up. “Time for a shower. Are you coming?”
John saw Sherlock's eyelids flutter and kept calling out to him, trying to give him something to pull him back to consciousness.
He remember Sherlock involving him in the investigations from the beginning. Astonishing him with his deductions and his brilliant mind. Surprising him with his lack of knowledge of anything he deemed superfluous or simply dull. Worrying him with his self-destructive behaviour.
Sherlock spent the next week idly around the flat. His return had now been revealed to everyone, whether personally or through the large number of papers that had publicized it. He had yet to receive any clients and he was still waiting for Lestrade to get back to him about working with the Yard again which left him with nothing to do all day. The most deducing he had done pertained to John. He was so bored that everyday after John got back from work he tried to deduce what patients he had seen. It wasn't nearly as enticing as a real case would be but it served to keep any dark thoughts away. While John was at work Sherlock usually sat around the flat making an exuberant amount of tea for himself and had taken to the habit of always having one cup ready for John when he got home.
John unwrapped himself from Sherlock and yawned. He was still tired, and he knew Sherlock must be as well. Regardless of what he'd taken he hadn't slept properly for days and that must be taking its toll on him.
Throughout the last three years he had grown to know and love John Watson for all his loyalty, intelligence and unpredictability- John Watson who, unlike love, was still a mystery to Sherlock- and the detective was looking forward to spending the rest of his days side by side with him.
It was late afternoon once they reached Baker Street. John had spent a long time at the restaurant trying to coax Sherlock into eating an acceptable amount of food and even managed to convince him to share a dessert.
Their room was bathed in silence once again for the next half an hour, Sherlock still asleep and John still happily thinking about their wedding and the enjoying the feel of Sherlock all around him when the sound of a phone ringing broke through the quiet haze.
They both settled back down on their respective pillows. Sherlock's pillow now being John's chest, and held each other close, neither one willing or capable to let go. The last thing John felt before drifting off into a peaceful sleep as Sherlock rubbing small circles on his back.
They were lying in bed, Sherlock on his laptop and John practically asleep when Sherlock interrupted his slumber.
