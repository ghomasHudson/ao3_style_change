They were wonderful tools, Tony told the Illuminati, extraordinary, strange, messy, so very tempermental, so hard to quantify, or use.
Jessica Drew used the red ring as a tool, switching between it and indigo depending on the day, on the mood. She could use one some days and the other another, never close together. “I’d get vertigo if I tried to go back and forth,” she tried to explain to Carol, “it’s too different, too much.” Steve could use red too, but it left lead in his stomach, left his hands burning, his heart pounding hard in his chest, it was so hard to take off when he put it on, and he couldn’t seem to use it to do anything but hurt. Luke used it to hurt too, but Luke could use it right. Luke could use violet one day, blue the next, green the next, and red the day after that like no one else on the team could switch between them.
The white ring stayed with Sue Richards nee Storm. None of the Avengers could use it and she certainly could so why not give it to someone who’d find it useful.
None of them would know what that meant, would they? They wouldn’t care enough to think about the—the implications. He knew that. He had to be right about that.
You have great love in your heart. Or, the Illumani takes ahold of another power they do not understand.
Osborn watched as Stark muttered to himself, staring at the ceiling, talking to something only he could see until he couldn’t talk anymore.
Hand, V: It was that ring. That’s where he got that power. We need to find out where he got it. (Dialogue lower--almost inaudible) How to stop it.
“Oh,” Tony blinked quickly. “I’m hallucinating again.” Steve made a noise Tony couldn’t identify and covered his face with his hand. “No, Tony. You’re not.”
His doctors told him the truth. The actual physical torture was going to take the least time to recover from. Cuts would heal. His hearing would never be the same again, but the loss wasn’t permanent in the ear it out in, it had never meant to be. His broken leg was more of an issue—it would take at least several months to heal and there was nothing that could be done for his ankle. There were also, apparently, several unintended consequences for being confined for months. His muscles atrophied. He was dangerously underweight. He wasn’t going to be getting in any work, and he certainly wasn’t going to be a superhero for a very long time.
”Translation for the blue ring was rather simple actually. It represents hope. Hope. Steve loved that ring. Tony closed his eyes. Steve and Peter, both of them couldn’t get enough of it.
The only Avenger who could use the black ring was Sentry, him and Reed Richards who gave a strange nod when putting it on for the first time. Black never felt right and neither did yellow, but weapons were weapons and no one ever needed to like a weapon to use one.
“I had it the whole time. Osborn,” Tony would not give that man the satisfaction of tripping on his name, “he tried, but he couldn’t use it. Not once.” Steve still looked slightly confused. No, not confused, he understood what Tony was saying. Concerned.
The Illuminati had taken individual rings, divided them the same way they divided the Infinity stones. Well, not exactly the same way. They each took a stone and never talked about them again. This was clearly a more acceptable subject.
Steve nodded, still looking at Tony and not down at what was in his hand. “I did like it. Thank you Tony.” A frown seemed to grow on his face and Tony rushed through possibilities on what he could have possibly done wrong this time. “How did you get ahold of this? I’d have thought the government would have gotten it.” Or Osborn hung in the air.
Tony could use yellow, with Extremis, it made him feel strong like green and violet didn’t. Luke loved violet, just like he loved blue and red and green. Violet left Tony sick and jumbled inside, not bad, just a little uncomfortable. But, when he wore it, suddenly Steve’s wounds would disappear during a battle, blasts that would have hit suddenly disintegrated, he could sense danger like Peter, could fly without his suit. He could do so much more with it than almost anything else so Tony kept the violet ring on his finger and ignored the trembling when he used it, every day growing a little more comfortable, growing to admire the feeling, and the stars.
If Doctor Strange said anything useful for the rest of the meeting, Tony didn’t hear it. He didn’t leave the room either. Later, he would play back the meeting in his mind, with indigo as compassion, with white as some all powerful force, something about black and resurrected corpses, but then he heard none of it. He kept very still, and very quiet, and tried not to think so hard about the ring on his left hand.
Norman Osborn had a problem. Norman Osborn actually had several problems, too disturbing and numerous to name, but the problem that he personally considered a problem was using the orange power ring without completely disintegrating the person in front of him. While that fact had several obvious disadvantages, in his opinion, due to the public relations hassle, in several others, due to the death of several people involved with Osborn’s experimentation, it did come with the rather useful side effect of him being rather reluctant to use the ring if he didn’t want the person in front of him dead. This also, in turn, came with a few disadvantages to the people Osborn did want dead.
Hartley, I: Are you listening Victoria? Osborn just killed three of our own goddam people. What the hell--what the hell have you gotten us into.
I think about Steve. It was not an answer he wanted to say out loud, but there are no secrets from Xavier. “Ah,” he said, and went back to the ring, “I don’t think,” he said, very carefully, “this works that way for me. Not exactly.”
he told himself, against every instinct in his body that rebelled against the thought. Not when he took them away, hid them through the entire war. It wouldn’t be right, to give them to the friends he hadn’t betrayed, but Tony was selfish, and he kept the one. Tony wore black gloves with his uniform, and a ring underneath his gloves. The ring was too large to hide under them, but it hardly mattered if he always kept his hands under his gauntlets, his face under a mask. He had an entirely new title and never felt more like he was made of metal.
could have healed him. Tony hasn’t taken the violet ring off since Steve died. He’d healed so much from it, repaired bullet holes like they were never there, sealed over burns, healed in way doctors and sometimes even magic never could. He’d wondered, darkly, in a whisper, in the back of his mind, if it could bring back the dead. He wondered what would have happened if he’d fallen to his knees beside Steve’s body, bloodstained shield against his chest and tried. Tony stared at the ring. The Steve in the corner of the room looked at him like he wanted him dead.
T’Challa, face clear of his mask, raised his eyebrows. “Stark, correct me if I am wrong, but are there still not Avengers who could use these? Or could you not keep them as property of SHIELD, Mr. Director?”
Tony could never make that one do anything. Not even for a second. Every member of the Illuminati had tried and not a single one could make Steve’s ring do anything. Is that what they were lacking? Why couldn’t he have invited someone, anyone who thought something good could happen in the world.
Director of SHIELD muttered a confession in a room without cameras, held a funeral in the rain, and the world kept on turning.
And then six hundred children died in Stanford, Connecticut and when Steve Rogers went to retrieve his blue ring before leaving Stark tower, it was already gone.
Tony did not want to keep it at SHIELD, but he would if he had to. Leaving them in the back of his office sounded like such a waste, but leaving them with people he sees every day makes his stomach drop even more. He touched the blue ring on the table. He can’t feel it through the armor. “This seemed like the best place for them.” T’Challa looks at him, assessing, and then nodded, then reached out to test the orange ring, frowned when he couldn’t get a reaction. He’d had great success with green, created giant green hands, and then a map of Wakanda.
And if Steve reached out and touched his hand, Tony faded too fast back into unconsciousness to notice, where he dreamed of a world where Steve was alive.
When Osborn retrieved the blue and orange ring from Stark’s office, he’d assumed the blue was defunct. But he knew Stark used the violet one time and time again. He ripped it from Stark’s finger when he locked him up, and Stark made such a horrified face the first time Osborn tried it, but it settled once nothing came from it.
Or perhaps arrives is the wrong word to use. Arrives implies the box came from somewhere. That it was delivered by an older FedEx employee who would pronounce your name incorrectly or even teleported in by some super villain or socially unaware scientific friend who didn’t find it extremely creepy to send their friends sudden mysterious items and, as Tony Stark and his cameras saw the box arrive, he was already mentally putting money on this being Reed Richards. As far as Tony could tell, the box came from nothing and nowhere. No recognizable particles surrounding it, no evidence that anything had entered the building. It was not there, and then it was.
But Steve is holding his baby, and Tony’s not in space or Siberia, he’s here in his house by the lake, and he trusts Steve, he does, with all his heart.
Morgan is a jewel. His and Pepper’s child, with her little face and little hands and little feet, glowing and gurgling.
But then, as soon as Natasha and Scott leave after lunch, which was a tense and sombre affair, even though it’s normally fun and lively with Natasha around, Tony thinks: Peter.
She glances at Tony with a knowing softness in her eyes, and Morgan’s in Steve’s hands, hands whose violence Tony is intimately familiar with.
,” she says, firmly. “Once you’re well enough to have a proper meal, we can go somewhere nice and…” She trails off, probably wondering how easy it will be to find a fancy restaurant that’s still in operation given the state of the world right now.
you do with it. It’s not mine anymore. Although if you do throw it away you might want to smash it to pieces first—you’re real good at that, I know. Just in case any enterprising thieves try and make away with our garbage. But I mean, it’s up to you, it’s not my fucking responsibility anymore, it’s yours, because none of you would
And Tony thinks about the Winter Soldier with his vibranium arm and the wreckage of his parents’ car, and Siberia again, Siberia. Steve choosing his parents’ killer over him. But he shouldn’t worry about that. If they try this, they probably won’t succeed and they probably won’t live. Bucky Barnes shouldn’t be a concern at all.
Pepper gestures at Tony with her hand to let him continue, and he says again, “It came to me in a dream, as things often do.”
Time was Tony might have made a scene. But he’s matured, mellowed in imminent fatherhood. He’s just here to see Steve, that’s all. He grabs a chair and sits down. People in the group go round in a circle and talk, and Steve listens and offers them reassuring remarks and comforting comments. It’s that
He gives her a pained look. “You should know I’ve made many enhancements to it but I’ve taken great care to preserve its
everything you are. So here we are.” Pepper takes Tony’s hand and kisses the centre of his palm. “I love you, Iron Man.”
“Then you can come talk to me any time you want, outside of this group.” Steve’s face is lined with weariness. Even his hair’s flat. Tony just stares at him obscurely through the dark lenses until he gives up. “Stay if you must, but try not to draw attention to yourself.”
“Yeah, and Papa found me,” she says cheerfully. They hadn’t made Steve one of Morgan’s oddfathers, in the end; he’d just become one of her fathers, playing nearly as big a role as Tony. He only spends every other week at the lake house; the rest of the time he’s at the Compound, with Natasha, directing what remains of the Avengers team in their efforts to stabilise the universe, and he’s still running his little support group, which gets smaller every year.
“Yeah, I have her.” Steve smiles, small but fond. “She just told me you’ve made her Morgan’s godmother. That’s wonderful.”
“Steve, have you seen my ‘Proof that Tony Stark has a heart’ memento?” Pepper says, conspiratorially, and takes a sip of her white wine.
“Let’s duck this meeting with Fury and the guys,” she says, her voice near-whiny, “I’m feeling awful. Can we just—“
Perhaps, in another life — had either of them been born in another decade — they could have even been something to each other, similarly doomed.
“I should have said something,” Steve interrupted. “He seemed wrong, he seemed off. I couldn’t put my finger on it.”
For a moment, every sensation is too much. His shirt collar, starched, is pressing against his neck. He can still feel vodka and tomato juice, the taste warped unpleasantly by the time, on his tongue. The crick in his back will be a full blown ache by tomorrow. His head hurts.
in her long green dress, tips her champagne flute towards Rhodey—her first glass of alcohol in nine months. “To Rhodey,” she says, “Morgan’s oddfather!” And Tony follows suit.
Steve doesn’t look surprised, but he doesn’t look ready to give up yet either. He takes out the arc reactor from his pocket and offers it to Tony. “Here. You might want this back.”
to an impeccable landing, so gentle that after weeks suspended in nothingness, Tony barely even gets to savour the sensation of their spaceship coming to a stop on solid ground.
“This was years ago. We’d”—he jerks his chin in Steve’s direction—“only just fought. I needed to make you a new shield, because I didn’t want to be unprepared for any eventuality. I didn’t even want to
“We should get chickens,” he says, without really being that invested in whether they shoud actually get chickens, but Pepper starts seriously considering it and listing the pros and cons of getting chickens, and that’s nice, too.
Just what? There’s no endgame here. He’s not trying to get anything from Steve. He’s certainly not getting laid. If he calls this off, he loses Steve.
The whole team is here, this time, and already bickering over the ground rules — how unfairly biased is this towards people who don’t have a way to fly, shouldn’t Tony agree to switch off his suit, shouldn’t Janet have to agree to not use her wings — and Tony couldn’t help, now, catching Steve’s level gaze.
“Well, she’s definitely looking for Thor, or his human identity, anyhow,” Tony types and talks at the same time, relaying the information to Thor via identicard. “I made it sound like I had information. I said I could take her to a hotel I thought he was staying in. She agreed to meet me.”
It’s some time before he can throw the funeral itself. He’s waiting for after shakes of the disaster to pass, feeling that it’d be wrong to take up space while good men and women — men and women who’d never betrayed them — still lay unburied.
“No, yeah, no.” Arnie’s flustered. Steve still can’t tell why. He puts the pen down on the table and follows his friend out of the kitchen, his hands in his pockets.
Steve raises both of his hands in mock surrender, wondering what the hell had provoked this reaction. “I, er. I come peacefully. Just wanted to say hello.”
He sits quietly with the team on the helicopter, but doesn’t stick around for the lunch the rest of them go out for.
The man grunted, and, with some effort, pulled himself up on his elbows. As he set up, Steve saw his hands were cuffed together with a long chain, heavy metal. His face was dirty, dust clinging to his well-defined, flat cheekbones, an un-groomed beard taking up most of the real estate of his chin. His eyes, a bright blue-green, were alert and aware, calculating.
The floor is solid under his fingers. The helicopter shakes slightly with each rotation of the blades. The air is stale — dust settles in his hair. Cold wind whooshes against his face as they land.
He knows he’s trying to reason himself into this. This is how it always is when he’s trying to drink less — the little rationalizations don’t matter as much as the goal.
With a jolt, Steve realized he was looking at his own face. For a moment, as they locked eyes, he thought he saw something flicker over his other-self’s face; hatred, so pure, so vitriolic it made him shiver.
He reaches over, running a finger, gently, over the back of Tony’s hand, feeling the bones in his knuckles. “I thought it was the future,” he says, “the mistrust, the— the division. But had been the past, all along. Naïveté. Too much trust.”
He hates the sympathy he’s imagining behind Stark’s dark glasses, the warm blue eyes he can call to mind a little too easily. He hates the comfort he draws from his touch, hates the fact that, even now, he trusts Tony to have his back. Even now, he expects them to work together seamlessly, knows they’ll be on the same page. He can’t stand it.
Steve doesn’t argue. He glances down at the seats, mulling over the evening. “… You kept our old toys,” he says, after a minute, unable to avoid pointing out the elephant in the room.
“Nope,” the Wasp told him cheerfully, “he’s still down in the workshop. C’mon, Cap, let’s go fetch him.”
He squeezed Tony’s upper arm before he left, quick and friendly, and Tony’s expression, briefly, reflected a delighted sort of surprise.
“What if it’s someone like,” Doris casts her eyes around, looking for an appropriately unappealing target, and lands on Steve, “Steve Rogers.”
He crosses the room, fiddles with the mike. When he glances up, he sees another figure in the doorway, framed in shadow, wide shouldered in a way only Steve Rogers and Thor are. The spiky hair and military posture leave only one possibility.
Tony was seated on the counter, his face tense, upset, and leaning against the wall. Future Steve was talking to him, using a ruler to gesture as he spoke.
“That must have been strange, for you,” Tony said. He was eating cake carefully with a dessert fork, eat bite a perfect proportion of icing to dough. “Any thoughts?”
He’s civilized. He’s not going to lick that off. From the way that Cap’s dark blue eyes catch on his hand, Tony is near-sure the thought has occurred to both of them at once.
He stops struggling against the chains, saving his energy. Tony knows his strengths and limits better, perhaps, than anyone on earth.
“Well, just say you’ll join me in a toast, Steve.” Tony says, reveling in the first name terms he’s pulled them into, in the newfound ability to tell Steve what to do.
“They wouldn’t believe that,” he says, with conviction he doesn’t feel. The war is too fresh, too recent, too real.
He doesn’t know who’s on the ground; no one had bothered clueing him in. CNN informs him that confirmed sources place Captain America and Spider-Woman on the response team, and he wonders if it’s the ex-SHIELD crew, mostly, that Steve is rolling with.
He doesn’t look great, either. The dress uniform he wears is scuffed, grey dust on olive green fabric. As always, he’d been fairly torn up in the battle. Most of his cuts have healed, but the deepest one, a long gash on his cheek, peeks out from under bright blue stitches.
He tried, valiantly, to be polite, crossing to the other side of the room. For the next while, he chatted idly with Thor and Clint, tolerated the Wasp fretting over the length of hair which would look best on him, now that she could compare them side-by-side, and then, under the guise of grabbing himself snacks, he gravitated back to towards the couch. They were in a public space, he told himself, any eavesdropping would be accidental.
Tony tips backwards, and backwards, and backwards, until finally he’s laying on the couch, his feet over arm rest, his head on Steve’s thighs. The effort of it makes him dizzy.
The sleepiness is gone, replaced with a deep, thrumming anxiety. Tony wraps the bandage around Steve’s ribs and lets his hands linger on Steve’s pecs, feeling the steady beat of his heart, freakishly low.
isn’t the kind of conversation he’s ever had to have; with most of the his partners, he’d either already been experimenting, or they’d had bigger problems to worry about.
Automatically, Tony checks him out, lets his eyes roam casually over Steve’s body. From a distance, he looks clean shaven, hairless, but Tony knows he’s covered in fine, near white-blond body hair.
Now, watching Rogers mingle with the party guests, he wonders if he’s the only one who can feel the aura of danger coming off the man, the potential energy. You can pull a living thing out of the frozen ocean, shove it under bright lights and the eyes of a cheering crowd, but can you ever wring the last cold droplets out of the fiber of its being?
Steve knows, now. It’s a relief, probably for the better; nothing will happen, still, but Steve will know why. Steve, who had clearly had the time to develop his own issues based on his soulmate’s stubborn silence, will have closure, and Tony doesn’t have very long left anyways.
He steps back out of the light, following Tony at an unhurried pace along the perimeter of the room, and feels himself all but disappear to the party guests. It’s an odd feeling; their eyes scan him, taking in the uniform but not the face, and move on with no glint of interest, recognition. Used as he is to immediately attracting attention, he can’t decide how to feel about it.
Tony looks down, his eyes on their hands. “Let me take you back to the tower, Cap,” he says, “spend a night with the team.”
As Jarvis serves coffee, they banter back and forth. Thor’s fun, easy — Tony gets the feeling he could get wound up but chooses not to.
Tony’s gearing to reply, something along the lines of never preventing female fun if he can have it, but Natasha beats him to it.
His soulmate is here. For the first time ever, she’d seen something he’s written to her. For old times’ sake, he shakily doodles a dandelion.
“Remember,” Tony mutters, low enough that only Steve’s super-soldier ears will pick up on it, “7-20-69.”
They don’t see each other for about a week. Tony drafts several text messages, ranging in content and intensity from,
Steve leans back against the bed and glances up at him, craning his head up, and Tony feels a little thrill of anxiety. As much guilt as he’d felt wanting to be hurt, it’s magnified at the idea of hurting, at the idea of being given this kind of trust and using it to—
Outside, the heat is unbearable, immediately warming his black suit jacket to an uncomfortable degree. The hot metal of his chestplate seems determined to catch his sweat and hold on to it. Still, he’s cold just under the skin, the kind of uncomfortable, jittery cold he doesn’t seem able to shake these days.
Once he’s done with the right hand, Rogers offers him his left. He can’t know how this looks, Tony thinks, digging his fingers into the seams of the second glove to free the zippers. He’s the kind of guy who’d freak out about something like that.
When he falls, he falls hard, the world spinning around him. He chokes, motion sick for the first time in his life, and vomits all over the inside of his own helmet. He hasn’t eaten, so it’s liquid, bile and alcohol mixing, the smell of it enough to have him dry heaving again.
They have come into the possession of discarded Stark Industries weapons, ones long ago taken off the market. The only issue is that every single item is somehow mangled, disarmed, or damaged. Tony, who had overseen the destruction of the discarded technology, knows full well that they’d beyond repair, that, even if he had wanted to help, he’d practically be building them from scratch.
He doesn’t participate in Hank and Thor’s idle speculation behind him, his eyes trained on the sea-weed covered figure they’d pulled out. A thought, insidious though almost certainly false, has just occurred to him.
By now, the fact that Cap likes him is old news. The paparazzi have caught them together — sometimes with girlfriends, sometimes without — at various diners, sporting events (what’s Tony supposed to do, here, when the guy likes baseball so much), and the like. People ask him all the time to finagle Cap into product sponsorships or charity events or photo ops, and Tony doesn’t, because he’d rather Cap keep liking him.
“I think I know,” Tony says, barely conscious of the words coming out of his mouth, “what you lied about.”
Tony reaches down and wipes the corner of his mouth with his thumb, and Steve leans into the touch and lets him pet his hair for an indulgently long time.
Steve, Tony realizes, is on the verge of crying with excitement. It should be a happy moment, and yet—
“I’m not just anyone,” Steve says, “and— well, I barely know you. But I’ve wanted this for so long, and if you’re willing to try…”
Then Steve picks him up and fucks him against the bathroom wall, because Steve doesn’t try to fix things that aren’t broken.
It’s nearing midnight (a strange time, Steve reflects, for a meeting). It’s a quiet, clear night, the moon a few days away from full overhead. Before the serum, Steve had never been able to see the face in the moon, but now it stands out crisp and clear, its mouth crater open in perpetual surprise. He remembers telling this story to Iron Man, who had laughed, shaken his head (
She locks eyes with Steve. And there it is again, the gaze, the gooseflesh, the overwhelming feeling of being observed, being
Confused but moved, Steve heeds his desperate plea and steps back, leaving the lab in sure, long strides. He doesn’t know that this means, what it could be, but he doesn’t want to watch that man have a heart attack, or a stroke. Perhaps Stark is a man incapable of confrontation. Still, though, it’s incredibly obvious he’s hiding something, and Steve plans not to let it go.
He holds the door to the building, too. Inside, the gala looks about how he’d expected it to; bright, warm light, sparse crowds of sharply dressed men and extravagantly dressed women. Even in here, Steve thinks, half annoyed and half impressed, Tony is easily the best dressed, the most handsome. The man’s ability to stand out in the crowd is unmatchable; Steve’s eyes follow him easily, everyone else in the room turning into background noise.
“They always come right after you’ve said something,” he points out, “if you don’t go to med, you have to shut up.”
“Good evening,” Tony says, and gives a little laugh, aiming to disarm with convention, “this is all very dramatic, isn’t it? If I didn’t know better, I’d think I was living on the pages of a Gothic novel.”
Tony makes a point of leering, the kind of joke leer men give people they can’t possibly find attractive. He lets his eyes linger on every place the suit fits too tightly; the biceps, the neck, each perfectly outlined ab. The pants are a little baggier, but Tony has a vivid imagination and Captain America probably has a big dick.
And then he catches Steve staring, his anxiety clearly visible through his awful, awful poker face. He must know Tony won’t dump him here alone, right? If nothing else, Tony’s driver will certainly be ready to take him home. He’s not heartless, over here.
“Oh, yes,” Amora is saying, her voice melodic yet somber, easy to make out, “yes, quite new. I’ve been looking for an old friend. I know he’s made a home, of sorts, here. I’m sure he must walk among the finest members of society here, but, alas, I’ve had so little luck…”
“Thanks, Steve,” he says, glancing down at his computer monitor. No living family. No records, probably, except for this one, decades old, hanging out unobtrusively in cyberspace. He wonders what the last time had been that someone had thought of Steve Rogers.
Shakily, Tony follows the instruction, wobbling slightly as he stands. He’s not going to walk; he can feel that.
Tony’s hand slips sleepily down Steve’s side and onto his lap, resting just over his groin. Steve hums and turns to look at him, having misread the gesture.
Firstly, that he was right. He’s unworthy of being Steve’s soulmate. He doesn’t deserve him. He hasn’t even revealed himself to Steve, yet, and he’s already managed to hurt him so badly.
He sits in board meetings, dully paying attention to words he could recite in his sleep. He’s on TV, smiling for the cameras, cracking just-clean-enough-to-air jokes, saying things just controversial enough to be interesting. He goes to space, stares at the earth impossibly small behind the glass window, and feels nothing.
He’ll give it some time, he decides, see if the effect wears off or if Steve gets desperate enough to follow his advice. He knows their people are interrogating the captured coven, and he’s made sure what the hell did you hit Cap with is at the top of the list of questions. If it’s serious, he hopes to know sooner, rather than later.
He has time. Stark hasn’t booted him out of his house. No one is threatening his status as a future team member. He’s going to have many opportunities to find the skeletons in Stark’s closet, and, goddamnit, he’ll take all of them.
Alarms wake both of them before the first rays of the sun even think about poking out from under the horizon. Avenger business.
Whenever they seem to separate, and he turns to look for Steve, Steve is inevitably close by, ready to catch his eye. It’s not until the end of the night that Tony takes it as anything but a willingness to leave at any time.
And then, just like that, Tony was crying. He was a quiet crier, his face screwed up on itself as though to keep the tears in, eyes squeezed shut.
“It should be,” Future-Steve promised, “and it’s your best option. There’s not a lot of time left, and… we miss you. We need you. We could make you happy. We could keep you safe.”
That night, as he pens the final lines in his journal, he remembers the flowers he’d once drawn on his arm. He doesn’t have roses to look at, now, but clover grows in the grass just outside the tent. On a strange whim, he steps outside and finds the most perfect clover flower he can, brings it inside, under the light, and tries to capture its rounded, slightly spiky softness, over his wrist, smearing ink on his thumb to shade the spaces between the petals.
When Tony brings his free hand up to rest on the side of his jaw, Steve arches into the touch, dragging a fine little line of drool behind his lips as he moves.
“I didn’t do that,” Tony said, frowning. “I hadn’t even gotten started. Someone on your side must be trying to get you back, after all.”
For a few long moments, his upper arm remains unmarred. Then his arm tingles, and here comes the neatly printed response, written in an inept, rounded uppercase of someone trying to disguise their handwriting, “
Steve barely wrangles him onto his feet and into the shower, where he leans heavy against his chest and closes his eyes.
Steve glances down. Tony can see him picking his words, figuring out how to say the truth without being truthful.
“It’s not my first time being undercover,” Steve says curtly, staring straight ahead of himself. “It’s a single night. I can handle it.”
It’s not going to be the same, really, parading him around now. This isn’t about social status — it’s entirely for Tony’s benefit.
Except, suddenly, Tony was stumbling back, and Steve had him by the hand, by the wrist. Tony was digging his heels in, and, as the portal started to close around them, future-Steve was yanking him bodily back in.
Then again, he wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for a few unannounced, last minute rescues from team members. It’s not exactly legal, but he can tap into their comms, listen in for a little while before coming down.
For a moment, he thinks, jealously, that she’s about to take him home with her, that he’s been hanging around for nothing, but she only squeezes his hand and says something about seeing the state her car is in, and then the two of them are left alone, standing the open plan semi-privacy of the Ultimates compound.
Decades in the future, Steve will learn exactly how rare this is, will read percentages; thirty percent of soulmate couples experience a single event in their lifetime, ten more than once, a tenth of a percentage able to maintain a consistent exchange. He will learn about the brain scans, the theories underlying it; moments of intense longing, moments of soul-similarity, ley lines and magnetic fields.
"Yeah." Tony presses his forehead against Steve’s shoulder, leaning most of his weight on his immovable frame. “I think I’m in love with you.”
It was bit of a shock that Tony Stark was only twenty-five, a year younger than Steve. Steve wondered why he’d never known, never thought to check, how old the man was. It wasn’t really that he looked much older — though, with the wrinkles under his eyes, between his brows, he kind of did— but the way that he carried himself, the authority and wealth he seemed to convey.
He picks up the shield, its familiar edge slotting so perfectly into his hand that he must have been made for this, he watches the shield whiz over him, its silver underside blurring in his vision, feels the walls shake through the floor as it hits and reverberates, feels the floor shake as two men fall, gunshots, catches the shield, Jesus, who is that, isn’t he Tony Stark—
suddenly much more honest, much more personal, than he’d been planning on being. None of it had come through.
“Ah. Well. Nothing surprising there.” Tony clicked his tongue, and then seemed to force himself to focus on different matters, “If you’d like to shower and change, I’ll have Jarvis bring down some clothes for you. You can meet us three at the party.”
Tony keeps thrusting, not bothering to count the time in his head. He tries to pull back when he’s about to come, but Steve catches him by the thigh and holds him in place. He gags, slightly, as he swallows. It’s messy. Dribbles of white roll down Steve’s chisel-cut jaw, his blue eyes dark with arousal and oxygen deprivation. The imprint of Tony’s sweaty hand is still visible in his short hair, bedhead messy. He’s breathing heavy, warm breaths against Tony’s thigh.
Still, he heads back for his own room. He’s been given a journal, and, in the spirit of investigative work, he starts to write down the encounter.
Tony sits and waits, feeling strangely blank now that he has asked. He can hear Steve rummaging around the closet, and he takes a second to imagine everything that he could pick up. His brain has always done well with possibility, with potential energy, and he sees the shapes of many items, of many acts, unfolding in front of him.
Tony gives up on talking to him before then and goes to strip off the suit in the laboratories upstairs, taking the time to rinse off not only the flight gel but also the vomit. He’s sure he still must smell, but he’s also sure he won’t be the only one.
Steve frowns down at his hands. His left palm still sports a long, deep slash mark, the kind of defensive wound one ends up with after trying to catch knives with bare hands. Bright blue stitches outline the cut, the color insultingly cheery.
Tony skims down the page and finds nothing more of interest, the single quote stretched out into an article’s worth of speculation, and pushes his fear down. God, fuck clickbait.
It shouldn’t be sexy. It’s certainly not what Tony’s used to in bed — he’d probably hear more out of Natasha in one night than he’d heard of Steve in their entire relationship — but Tony finds it honest, charming. He’s the object of Steve’s single-minded concentration, his pleasure Steve’s objective.
“I was hired,” the man says, stepping forward, “to ensure the failure of your little project. How long do you think it’ll take your team to fall apart without you?”
The guy’s depressed, out of his element. That much is clear. Out of everyone, he talks most to Jan, whose husband always cuts the conversation off within two minutes of it starting. And that’s fine. Jan is pretty, approachable, doesn’t make random comments about Cap’s backside. She spends far more time with Rogers than Tony ever does, attends every team meeting, hangs out around the compound. She doesn’t have another job. She’s also a woman. Tony, whose interest in Cap is entirely platonic, should not feel jealous.
He lies, as Jarvis holds the box out to Rogers, “I’m sure it’d look better in your humble home than it ever did here.”
Steve’s fingers graze lightly over his arm, but he catches himself, draws back. “I’m going to have Jarvis call your doctor.”
“Look,” Steve says, throwing his hands up, a little defensive, working towards angry, “if you don’t want me here, I’ll go.”
“I don’t have a landline,” Steve continues, after a beat. “I’ve never had one here. I’ve been here a year and I still try to find the goddamn thing.”
Iron Man had told them he wouldn’t be able to make it. Iron Man, Steve remembered, still fretting over the cake, which looked messy at best despite his best efforts, had also encouraged Steve to bake.
The following day unfolds less like a fight and more like some kind of thriller. Tony can imagine the music going quiet when they find the island. The drop of the nuclear bomb, even from behind his forcefield, is near-cinematic.
He reaches over and feels along the coffee table, hoping to find painkillers, or whatever, or anything of the sort. Mercifully, Jarvis—
The sleeve of Steve’s henley has hiked up on his arm, revealing perfect, smooth skin and a peach fuzz of soft, blond hair. Tony squints and reads writing on his wrist, in the neat cursive he’s come to know so well, half exposed before the sleeve cuts it off,
Like Steve, he’s bound hand and foot, his ankles chained to the feet of the chair, his hands behind him. Unlike Steve, he’s gagged, a long, sparkling green cloth wrapped around his face, more stuffed in his mouth.
It’s soft and slow. Tony feels the texture of Steve’s skins, the parts where his chapped lips turn coarse. Steve nips at the hollow of his throat, undoes the buttons on his shirt with big, deft fingers, and Tony can feel himself finally hardening.
Tony lands down next to them more heavily than he’d intended. Relief has done almost nothing to ease the horrible knot in this stomach.
Steve’s left the bathroom door slightly ajar. Tony follows him, his bare, damp feet sticking unpleasantly to the tile, and finds him sitting on the edge of Tony’s marble bathtub.
The only soap opera he finds is in Spanish, which Tony speaks and Steve doesn’t. He seems content to watch anyways.
Cap reaches in and pulls the present out, holding it up to let its scratched surface catch the light. Tony watches his micro expressions; the surprise, the burst of nostalgia, just a little mournful. For a moment, he wonders if he’s miscalculated, and then Rogers grins.
“Close the partition,” says Tony, gesturing to the partition between them and the driver, who’s probably heard everything even from the other side of the limo and will need to be paid off. “Tell him to turn on some music, too, while you’re up there.”
Steve is stacking up chairs, because of course he told everyone there was no need to put away the chairs; he would take care of all that. “I don’t think of it like that. It helps me. To do what I can to help others. I have to keep looking for ways to do my part.” He glances at Tony. “You didn’t seem like you needed any support.”
Steve’s jaw drops just like Pepper’s did. “You figured it out? Tony, you’re amazing.” He reaches out with both his hands and Tony steps forward to hold them. “I… You know, this is horrible to admit, but maybe there was a part of me that was hoping you wouldn’t.”
“Aw, that’s sweet.” Tony puts his hands on Rhodey’s shoulders. “I hereby appoint you Morgan’s oddfather.”
Tony gives her a rueful smile, and she drapes herself over his back, hugging him from behind. Steve looks embarrassed, wiping his face with his sleeve, but he’s perfect, and Tony thinks—yeah. This is it. This is, at long last, it. Where all his nightmares and all his dreams have finally led him, to the place where this moment is the only moment. Not the next moment or the moment before; not grief over the past or anxiety about the future, but this moment, complete in itself, absolute and all-encompassing.
The next time he sees Cap, it’s under far less pleasant circumstances. It turns out they ought to have been worrying about the Pyms; Hank, it turns out, has gotten into the habit of throwing his wife around, and, the night when Cap and Thor had been drinking wine at Tony’s, he’d gone too far. As Betty Ross fills them in on the situation and the history, her usual terseness mixing with a low, guilty note, Tony sees the set of Rogers’s jaw and knows he’s going to do something about it.
Steve falls in line behind Tony, his shoulder set, his face impassive, until they climb back into the car, sitting uneasily side by side.
“Seems like you’ve got a lot on your plate already, Stark.” He says. His tone is gruff, no nonsense, military. Last name, no “Mr.” or “Dr.” in front of it. In this world, something about this feels honest to the point of naïveté. Tony wants to reach over and pinch his cheek, just to see what would happen. “With the— whatever it is you do.”
He feels the need to beat Steve to it, to say something that will exonerate him, but he can’t think of anything.
He’s gone up on the roof half in hopes of being found. Steve’s not a coward; he knows they must talk, eventually, just as he’d known they must eventually work together. He doesn’t know what to expect. Tony’s a decent man. He won’t out Steve, though whether he’ll be okay with Steve staying on the team or not is up in the air. Steve will respect his boundaries, let him take the lead.
under his breath, but that’s not what matters. He’s used Steve’s real name, which he’s never been told. Iron Man knows, in secret, and though he could have told Tony Stark, this is the kind of dick move that could shatter their friendship. Tony shouldn’t care, shouldn’t feel like he deserves even this scrap of a relationship, and yet anxiety flares in his chest at the thought of being caught in the lie.
He remembers a chilly night sitting out on Arnie’s kitchen floor, remembers the roses in the vase, the way that Mrs. Roth’s face had gone pinched with worry, remembers,
It’s a beautiful church, the same one he assumed he’d marry in. Light filters in through the open stained glass windows. Bird sing outside. It’s a bright, sunny day. He’s bought a bouquet of roses, Osiria blooms. The red tips on their white petals make him feel like the flowers had been dipped in blood.
It’s not about the body; Tony, generally speaking, plays the other side of the field. There have been exceptions, of course — Tony isn’t planning to go out without having tried it all, thank you very much — but, despite what Jarvis says, he’s perfectly secure with himself as a straight man.
) but then grown less sure of his own assertions as Steve had pointed out his view of mouth, nose, eyes (
Tony recognizes the song that comes in the first few notes. Leonard Cohen’s deep, simmering voice joins him before Steve does.
She’s stronger than him, a combination of thousands of dollars in biological enhancements and thousands of hours of rigorous training. In a moment, she’s got him on his back, her knee over his neck. He barely catches the motion of her going for the gun in the bedside table before it’s in her hands.
Steve gets up, and Tony flops over on his side to watch the way his back muscles move when he stretches. There’s something poetic, he thinks sleepily, about the he looks nude among the expensive fabrics lining Tony’s closet, pale pink skin against deep reds and golds. He could take a a picture.
Tony Stark woke up in a pristine white room, looked around, and looked up. Steve Rogers looked back.
“Iron Man.” The chatter in the room broke off; Strange was fixated his eyes still locked on the ring he was holding in his hand, a frightening, intense look on his face. “Do you still have the box? With the markings that these arrived in.” Tony had barely gotten out a “yes,” before Strange swept toward the door with a quick, “bring it to me,” as he left the room, muttering about Wong and languages under his breath, taking the ring he was holding with him.
Red was for anger, apparently, and Tony’s mind went, well that was obvious. He thought about Steve and Luke, about Namor and Jessica and thought yes, yes that looks like rage. Steve hates that ring; Jessica couldn’t always make it work, and his heart constricted.
He remembered reading, after Afghanistan, that one’s body started to cannibalize itself after a few days and his sleep deprived brain found that was psychically funny. Carol was in the middle of talking to him when he sat up and laughed. She stopped and turned toward him, eyes wide. “Tony?” Her voice couldn’t decide if it wanted to be hesitant or questioning. A blonde orderly passed by the window and all the hysterical joy left him in an instant.
“Each of the rings, they all,” Tony coughed, re-evaluated, rephrased, “while you were gone,” not dead, never dead because Steve wasn’t dead, “Strange translated that box. We—I mean—this group met up,” Steve tensed and Tony soldiered on, “took the ones that worked, but, we found out, apparently, they’re based on—well it’s stupidly magical nonsense who even knows how these things actually run it defies all explanation.”
Until he’s almost murdered by the Mandarin and he realized someone needed to have some power here. And he realized exactly who could handle power.
Stark stared at the corner of the room at something clearly only he could see. Osborn’s eyes were slits as he waved a man in.
The Illuminati were not the type of people Tony wanted to be around for an extended period, as much as he might like certain members on an individual level. It turned out the smartest men in the world made an explosive group.The people he did like to spend time around, however, seemed to not be on speaking terms with him, so he supposed he’d have to deal with what he could. The Illuminati were, while not always personable, certainly trustworthy. He kept his suit up, still, and his voice altered. This was not the place to be vulnerable.
But that was when his future self entered the room, wearing Steve’s clothes, fresh and clean-shaven. Steve glanced him up and down, frowned.
“No, that’s alright,” he says, and hops up to sit on the edge of the tub next to Steve, “what happened?”
“And you, uh…” Steve didn’t know if he ought to bring it up. It didn’t seem right. “… not being there. For some reason.”
Should have asked Jarvis. Should have just bought something. He didn’t know why he’d decided to bake at all; perhaps, and now he felt stupid for it, he’d thought he’d impress Tony Stark with something old fashioned, something heartfelt.
His dick responds automatically to Steve’s hand, hardening under the familiar touch of his firm, calloused fingers. Steve knows exactly how he likes it, and he throws his head back, muttering an appreciative, “There you are, darling,” as Steve strokes him to full mast.
“Hi, Tony,” the Wasp said. Though Steve didn’t know her identity, he knew the Wasp’s friendship with Tony Stark was old, “Are you busy?”
“Thanks.” Steve said, drily, and couldn’t help pointing out. “You’ve barely aged. In fourteen years.”
Tony feels cold dread in the pit of his stomach, anticipation of failure, of rejection. This, he decides, is the feeling he likes least.
He feels like he shouldn’t be peeking, but the weight of the mystery is too large to ignore, now. So, deliberately softening his steps, he shuffles over to the door and pushes.
“It wasn’t you,” he says, “As the… the lies got under my skin, I think part of me would have been upset no matter who Iron Man was.”
“Paintings?” Steve asks quietly, and Tony wonders how it had been that this had been the stray thought they’d shared, what or who determined what was important enough for a soul bond to carry over.
“You’d be okay without me, wouldn’t you?” He asked, speaking so softly Steve could only barely pick it up, “I’m leaving all my money to the Avengers. Iron Man, I—“
The spell is broken. Cap startles, glances up at him. Tony grins in response and pushes away from the table. “Well, ta-ta. Duty calls.”
He’s paranoid, as he always is, that Stark weapons have somehow gotten out, that whoever it was that had been close enough to reroute a shipment of communication technology could almost have been close enough to get their dirty mitts on old blueprints, on things he’d ordered for the Iron Man, for the team.
He can feel Cap’s eyes on his back as he leaves the room. Privately, though, his mind elsewhere; he’s imagining everything he could do with Cap’s time, if he wins the bet.
Tony walks out quietly and sits close to him, so close he can half feel his body heat, can smell the earthy, spicy cologne through a day’s wear. Jasmine, he thinks. The scent underneath is jasmine.
The feeling of betrayal returns, coiling tight and cold in Steve’s gut. The whole time with the Illuminati, had Tony expected to meet resistance from him? Had he expected, all along, that he’d need to go up against Steve to protect his secret?
It’s almost cute to watch the guy fumble at the finger food tray, cute in the same way that a lion is cute when you slap a tutu around its neck. He won’t take his gloves off, but he’s clearly uncertain about crumbs and food juice on the brand new, shiny red leather, property of SHIELD. Tony watches him reach for the skewered shrimp and immediately pull his hand back, and realizes he’d never had a choice to begin with.
“Luck’s got nothing to do with it, old boy,” Tony says, “you’ve just got to believe your own bluff.”
“Are they in here?” Steve calls, and, before Tony can sit up enough to see what he means, he cracks open the inner closet door. Tony hears his short, surprised intake of breath. “What’s all this?”
want to prolong this, to keep Steve here, for the last time, in his reach. There’s some addictive about breathing the same air as the man, and it’s intoxicating to get all to himself.
At first glance, it seems to make sense. This man, much more than Tony Stark, fits his conception of how Iron Man should be. His face is open and honest, each expression easy to read (
It’s not even that Cap is delicate in bed. He’s hardly the perfect gentleman. He holds Tony up against walls, throws him over his shoulders, blows him in the coat closet at fancy parties.
“It won’t work,” he says, playing for time, “Tony will have an alibi. He’s always around people or in his workshop, with with cameras on. Even if he isn’t, his suit keeps track of where he is.”
“It doesn’t count!” Steve says, immediately ready to defend the girlfriend he’d been so upset with moments ago, “He was—“
Before he can correct him, Steve reaches over and picks Tony up. It’s a gentler gesture, lighter, and though Tony’s masculinity refuses to let him label it as “bridal style,” one of Steve’s hands is under his knees and the other on his back.
His hands shake as he clicks on it, the fear bone deep, and reads, skimming down to find the meat of the story:
When he gets home, his dark suit still wet from the slushy late fall rain, she’s already waiting for him in the kitchen, an amber drink he can’t identify balanced between her fingers.
Rogers runs his fingers over the interior of the helmet, his expression distant. Tony wonders what he’s remembering.
“Aand he catches on,” the man says, “but he’s made it so wonderfully easy, hasn’t he? I was half tempted to just step back and take the credit when he inevitably backstabbed you.”
That night, he drifts off to sleep in the same medbay cot, feeling the same removed half-relieved resignation.
to the rambly blog maintained by one of his most devoted followers. If nothing else, the guy is a true believer.
It doesn’t look how he wants it to look. Steve’s out of practice. He feels a brief pang of disappointment when the flower doesn’t fade away, but it’s the resigned disappointment of a man who had not won the lottery; deep inside, he’s always known his chances were near zero.
century, had been to assemble a record collection. Tony hasn’t been to his apartment, but he’s seen Rogers steadily collecting new jackets, new books, new shoes. He has a new keychain, a little white thing with with “I
Tony is sitting in the Cap tribute room, his back against the wall and legs stretched out in front of him, dress shoes pressed against the stand of the original helmet, the version that hadn’t gone down in 1945. In his hands, he clutches the 1951 collectible action figure which had been a comfort item as a child. In hindsight, he’d been obvious.
Steve reaches down, running his fingers, rough, calloused, over the deep lines in Tony’s forehead, the sharp divot of the bridge of his nose.
A veritable bouquet is blooming on his arm, far more flowers than Steve had ever sent before, roses and lilies surrounding the hydrangea he’d drawn before. Tony’s eyes catch on the carefully shaded petals, the delicate lines of the flowers. He knows without flipping his hand over that Steve’s dark inky thumbprint is printed over his own.
“I’m still taking you, one day,” Iron Man had said, and Steve had thought nothing of it. Their shoulders had bumped against each other. Iron Man had smelled of machine oil and rich, musky cologne.
Steve sits back on his haunches, satisfied. Tony has parted his legs to let him work, and Steve grabs him by the knees and forces them back together with a short, derisive laugh. Dirty talk has never been his forté, but the laugh seems to say it all anyways; did Tony think he was going to get what he wants, get Steve inside him, get to feel good right now?
“I hope you don’t mind flying,” Tony counters. He reaches over and takes Steve by the wrist, and doesn’t let go. This, at least, is allowed to them here.
“Well, I’ve got yet to see any proof he’s even real,” Steve says, drily amused, “must be a busy, busy man.”
Elsewhere, he’s putting on his gloves, smooth red leather on calloused skin. He’s in the helicopter. He’s worried about landing. He’s worried about Iron Man. He’s had a cup of coffee brewed too strong, and it stays acidic on his tongue now, ten minutes later. He can’t stop thinking about Iron Man, can’t stop trying to slot him into a picture. He remembers—
Danvers had once explained to him the difference between horror and terror, right before she had shown him some horror movie. One anticipatory, one reactionary. But never had he understood the difference more than when he had seen the suit be yanked by the vines, and then pulled apart to pieces. Just like he hadn't understood relief so clearly when Tony had shown up in those stupid socks (because his feet had shitty regulation) seconds later.
"Of course it will," Natasha said. "They're sickeningly in love, and as soon as Steve opens his mouth, Stark's going to understand that, now that you've got him thinking about his relationship with Steve. All that's left is setting up a way for them to talk, since Stark's holed himself up, and getting Steve to understand his own feelings."
"I think I'm in love with Tony," Steve said, his voice faint even to his own ears. "I think—I love him."
What the hell. “I miss my best friend,” Steve burst out, and belatedly wondered if that had sounded too childish. “I miss him, and it’s all so stupid because he’s right there and yet he won’t talk to me.”
"No, listen," she said. "And Stark, let's talk about him some more. When we thought you died, it messed him up, and he won't admit it. Everyone was suspicious of T'Challa since he quit the Avengers, but Tony actively tried to be friends with him. Up until he thought T'Challa had killed you. It was like a switch had been flipped; you know that Tony has his dark, powerful side—everyone does—but he sent James after T'Challa for you, convinced the entire world to avenge your death, held one of the grandest funerals a person could ever have, went all the way to forge diplomatic alliances with Attuma..."
Why did she even bother? For all her past crimes, it seemed likely that she was just cursed to live with two dramatic idiots for the rest of her life. (Damn it, their drama was starting to rub off on her too, wasn't it?).
"No, you know what? I'm over you boys," Natasha said. "This is ridiculous, Steve. Even for you, even for him. It's not good for you to keep it inside, either." She smirked, satisfied as a cat—and for someone who liked to throw people’s words back at them, Natasha was decidedly pleased.
"I care about him," Steve said, feeling the need to be outraged. Something about the turn this conversation had taken, something about the way Natasha was stating things, was leaving a funny taste in his mouth. He set down his fork and decided that he didn't care for what she was implying. "Natasha, what are you—I told you, I miss him, not that I'm mad at him."
"What—oh, you sneaky, conniving spy," Stark said, eyeing the mug with thinly-veiled admiration. He looked up at her. "I've been looking for those beans, thought I hallucinated that cup of coffee last year. What am I doing for you?"
Unfortunately, this was not the first time that Steve had come to this conclusion, nor would this likely be the last. Every time that Natasha showed up at his door, she’d smile this terrifyingly pleased smile and every excuse and obligation he had would fly right out of his mind and out the window. Steve was such a sucker.
"Depends," Steve said. He delicately placed the cake plate underneath the coffee cup, and was struck by the oddity of a New York cafe serving food using ceramic dishes.
“No, really,” he said, and half-heartedly batted away her hand when she reached for another piece. “I can’t even imagine what—I know he cared about her.”
. "Hi. Uh. You're kind of scaring the other patrons... um, here. And, uh. Maybe if you stop snarling at each other? That would... that would be great. Thank you."
The coffee cake was a spectacularly great idea. He'd gotten two slices of it (and a thing of biscotti for Natasha), and now Steve was in heaven.
Natasha was starting to miss the jungle monsters. At least they knew what was going on, and what to do. "Do I look like I want you to make his funeral stick?" she asked. "I want you to walk up to him and tell him everything you wished you had told him when you thought he was dead."
"Don't worry about it. Marketing reference," she said. "Anyway, your mood has improved. Can we talk about your best friend now, or should I wait for you to finish the second slice?"
...and couldn't get past the thought of Tony, desperately trying to avenge his death. Of Tony, and how strangely he had looked at Steve when they had all had breakfast in Wakanda. Of Tony, and the even stranger expression on his face when T'Challa told them about the crown's instability, and how Steve had thrown himself on it like a grenade. Of Tony, and how—
"I don't know what that means," Steve said, and scraped the first cake container clean with his fork. "Put together, I mean."
"What can I do for you, Romanoff?" Stark said, hunched over a gauntlet when she stepped into his workshop. "How's the calibration on your stingers?"
"I'm not telling Captain America that I think his ice cream choices are suspect, either," Stark said.
Natasha sighed loudly again. "It's almost as if you think I haven't already taken care of that," she said, and leaned over to look into his coffee cup. It was empty, because Steve had finished it. She made a face at him. "Honestly, Steve, I know dying and coming back to life can cause memory loss, but do you even remember who I am? Quick, what's my callsign?"
He likes that about her. He likes the lack of sensitivity, the lack of weakness, the way she takes charge of situations. He thinks it’s cute when she teases him over his emotions. He likes that she just lets him take care of her, has no issues using his money. He’d never liked to soothe, or reassure, to have to be the strong one.
He could sleep with a beautiful woman in his sleep, he thinks, and then has to stifle a laugh at how that sentence had come out, the awkward repetitions, the sentiment.
How many sides can Tony have? How many masks can one man wear? And how can Steve know, really, which one of them is true?
He finally runs into the man himself three weeks into his stay at the tower. Steve’s insomniac, again, and this time he’s wandered down to the lab. It’s locked most days; the Wasp had known the code but he hadn’t. This time, though, the door is slightly ajar.
Five months into sleeping with Cap, and he still hasn’t gotten the guy to stop bodywash as a three-in-one. One day, he promises himself, Captain America is going to condition his hair. Shampoo, at least.
Two of them would go undercover into one of the galas she was expected to make an appearance at and attempt to glean more information, find out the workings of her inner circle. Steve dyed his hair and donned the black suit of a bodyguard, where his build wouldn’t provoke suspicion, hoping to overhear rumors from other staff at the event. Tony could simply go as himself — no one would question his place at the event, nor the fact that Iron Man may be close on his employer’s heels.
“Oh,” Steve says, and then shrugs, like it’s no big deal, “you’ll send me the time and dress code, then.”
The missing men make Steve feel that they have failed to grasp some fundamental part of the case. It wouldn’t be unlike her to kill or bewitch for attention, of course, and yet…
“I couldn’t have asked you to stay,” Steve said, “Not if your life was on the line. But I’d miss you, Tony. Not as my boss, or the team’s benefactor, but as a friend.”
Two nights later, Tony slides the little red crop into Steve’s hands and whispers, close to his ear,
Steve rolls his eyes, his expression settled into a distant sort of fondness, and obediently keeps his trap shut the rest of the way.
The car key slips and slides in his sweaty hands. Distantly, he considers how driving with a migraine compares to driving drunk. He considers if he’s being irresponsible. He considers if he has any other option. He drops the key, bends down to pick it up, and—
The room is poorly lit, as these rooms tend to be, and small. There’s no furniture, just metal hooks jutting out of the cement walls. Steve shivers, feeling the chill, wet air on his bare arms, and tries to brute force the cuffs open. They hold steady, the metal unyielding, and Steve breathes in deep, pushing down the rising tides of fear, discomfort.
Tony watches him go, feeling a strange mix of failure and relief. Then, as he’d wanted to all along, he strips off his blazer and socks, takes off his belt and tosses it on the floor.
“But that’s impossible.” He says, glancing over to Tony, who meets his eyes and desperately tries for more muffled words. He’s paler now, his eyes — the exact same shade as the newcomer’s— open wide in some emotion Steve can’t quite read. Surprise? Fear? “Tony Stark is Iron Man. I saw the suit come off.”
