Dean crossed the room swiftly. He sat down on the bed and took Cas’s face in his hands. He traced the corner of Cas’s lip with his thumb and stared into his eyes. Cas’s stomach swooned at the touch and green eyes surrounded by gorgeous freckles. Cas was awake now and he was burning alive.
As suddenly as the parade had started, the parade was over. People began to pack their chairs, coolers, and kids in a flurry to get out before the traffic started. Sam mimicked others and stood to pack up the chair he had been sitting on for over seventy-five minutes. The parade had lasted way longer than Sam had thought but he had enjoyed every minute of it. Sam felt a small hand grab his arm and turned to find Eileen standing next to him.
“Nah, he has plenty of time for that. When he hits five and has a bit more coordination, he’ll actually be on a team with real practices instead of them throwing yellow vests on the first kids they can wrangle. Lily’s pretty good and takes it seriously but all her siblings play soccer too. Jack is more interested in playing with the other kids and picking grass. I think this is more for parents than anything. Gather the kids in one area and pretend that they’re playing a sport while the adults chat. It’s more like group babysitting. The refs get community service hours to put on their college applications.”
Cas smiled at the hot chocolate he was making. More of their first night together was making sense now. Dean had kept throwing out references Cas didn’t get. Dean would explain sometimes but more often than not said that Cas needed to get out more. Cas just needed to find the marshmallows to top it off the hot chocolate so they could drink up and then...Where did he put them again? Cas focused on the marshmallow search to keep his blushing face hidden.
It was the yard that really sold it for Dean. The front was open with a giant maple tree that sat close to the house. The back yard had a large barn with enough space to park at least four vehicles in the stalls below, a small workshop, and had a hay loft that was completely empty minus four bales of abandoned moldy hay. There were three oak trees in the back. One was nearly completely dead just out the backdoor but it still stood proud. Near the back of the house was an abandoned garden with a fence that was falling apart. The rest of the yard was large and overgrown with now-dead wildflowers and prairie grass before the edges reached the dense forest. There would be so much open space if Dean were to cut the grass he would need a riding lawn mower to do it.
Sam looked around. The darkness of the growing night had set in and it seemed peaceful outside. Inside the house was no different. Dean and Cas were sitting close enough together that their legs were touching from the hip through the thigh on the smaller loveseat. Their argument petered out and returned to normal conversation. It filled Sam with a sense of relief that some things never changed like the bickering and lack of personal space between the two of them.
“How did you sleep?” Cas asked as Sam heaped eggs onto his plate. Returning to healthy eating after his week of splurging was going to be a shock to his system but right now Sam couldn’t bring himself to care.
Cas had a questioning look too. He signed a question to Eileen and she shook her head and shifted nervously too. Dean shrugged when Cas met his eyes. Cas nodded. They would ask the Mr. and Ms. Terrible Liar later. He didn’t know what the pair of them were hiding but they obviously didn’t want to talk about it now.
Not that Dean had been going around macking on Cas or that he and Cas had ever come close but someone telling Dean Winchester not to do something made him want to do it more. Sometimes the sight of Brandon’s slightly disapproving face when he and Cas used on one of their nicknames or when they inevitably stood too close like they do made Dean want to lay one on Cas right there in the nuts-and-bolts isle. Just to poke fun at Brandon. Not for any other reason. Instead, Dean would use this opportunity to rile Cas up a little as an outlet for his bad behavior.
That night was a long one. Dean tossed and turned as much as his cast would allow him. It wasn’t until the early hours of the morning with Cas, Jack, and Sam still on his mind that Dean slipped into a restless sleep. His dreams were distorted and lacked any sense of direction.
Angel radio had begun to hum in the back of his mind when they had made it back to their plane. It almost as incomprehensible as the first time Cas blew past him in the shack. If Dean truly focused, he could just make out the words if he leaned on Cas’s mind for the interpretation, but they didn’t have time. It sounded like the first angels were beginning to stir from their dreams.
And that was how Dean found himself at the local animal shelter four months ago, face-to-face with Bruiser the Bulldog.
Cas talked about the angels breaking down the door to try to take Jack. Eileen told them about them trying to take on the angels and their quick defeat. Dean didn’t meet Sam’s eyes at the mention of that. He had failed to protect all of them, especially Eileen, in that moment. It was then Dean’s turn to tell about him leading the angels on a wild goose chase until they lured Cas out. Cas took over the story after that.
“Hey dickhead, next time you decide to pull my ass out of the frying pan wait a little bit. Kinda sucks being one of the first ones awake and having to fight some demons hell bent on killing you. Nice to know you care about me enough to make sure I’m the second one off the plane but you got very lucky that the next group of angels woke up quickly,” Balthazar yelled making eye contact with Cas. He winked at Dean after that.
Mary brought up the topic of Jack liking Dean’s voice once when Dean was handling a fussy Jack while Cas showered before dinner. Dean had been preparing to pull the lasagna with homemade garlic bread out of the oven when Jack started whimpering in Sam’s arms at the table. Dean asked Sam to trade him spots which Sam agreed to.
A loud and disgusted scoff came from the man. Sam watched Dean’s back tense as he walked away but didn’t turn around. Jack was chatting to Dean unaware of the entire situation that was unfolding around him. Matt had Lily in his arms too.
Duma’s eyes softened for a moment, “No angels currently have enough grace to heal an injury that extensive and keep heaven powered. We are the weakest we have ever been Dean which is why we needed Jack’s grace to begin with. You would need dozens of full powered angels to begin to heal the damage ripping the grace out of a Nephilim.”
“If the angels can do all that, why doesn’t she just fix your leg?” Mackenzie asked with eyes narrowed.
“Papa’s got ya, Jack. We’re gonna get through this together. It’s okay, buddy,” Dean would whisper soothingly to Jack hoping the forced, false calmness in his voice would ease the kid. Cas would be on the phone nearby with the doctor trying to determine whether to bring Jack in for a visit.
Dean was growing stronger thanks to the work he was doing around the house and the physical therapy sessions with Cas. There was a rush of pride when he noticed that the bands didn’t have to be tightened as much as his thigh and calf muscles returned. He was reaching greater strides in his physical therapy and Cas was always quick to compliment him when he had done well or improved. Dean was achieving greater things and felt strong enough to accomplish projects that he hadn’t anticipated he would have the ability to do.
When the grace flickered, Dean was temporarily brought back to the hillside. Outside the sphere of protection, the swirl of grace that surrounded them faded ever so slightly in response. He could make out lightning strikes scattering throughout the sky but nothing else.
There were four options ahead of them. The first was more surgeries. A lot more surgeries to try to correct what was going on with his femur and knee. Dr. Sands said it would likely be upward of five surgeries and it would take years to go through the process. The words micro-fracture surgery was thrown out at one point too when Dr. Sands talked about repairing his knee and femur. The entire time he would be in intense pain with no promise of fixing the problem.
When the receptionist asked Dean when he would like to return Bruiser, Dean said he wasn’t planning on it. That was the truth. He never planned to return Bruiser to begin with but he had called the shelter looking for answers. After hearing more about Bruiser’s life, Dean knew he couldn’t abandon the poor guy like all the people did before.
Dean’s thought wondering how so much of the Winchesters had rubbed off on the guy but good taste in cars wasn’t one of them. Must have been Sam’s doing.
Cas would eventually break Dean’s “no painkillers” rule and gently coax Dean to take them after hours of pleading with him. His eyes were always full of concern as he watched Dean swallow down the pills and waited for the pain to diminish to a tolerable level. By this point, Dean would be a pale, shaking mess that was simply too exhausted to fight back.
Not surprisingly, everyone at the table had picked up on Dean’s foul mood and quickly shifted to talk away from the hunt. They must have though Dean was jealous of Sam returning to hunting. While there was some bitterness still there from that, the truth of the matter was that Sam got to leave and come back and his title never wavered while Dean was with Jack everyday and was still nothing as far as Cas thought.
Mary opened the door slowly. She looked tired in her bathrobe but smiled when she saw Dean and Jack. Dean held up a finger to his mouth in the universal sign of quiet and shrugged the diaper bag off his shoulder. Mary gestured with her head for Dean to come in. They had set up the play pen the night before for Jack to rest in and Dean made his way over before he heard Mary whisper, “Wait.”
Until life shifted again when Jack was five months and three weeks old. Dean had been catching up with Mary in the kitchen after ending a ghoul who gone off and killed three people when the lights of the bunker flickered and went out. The red emergency lights came on casting an ominous glow. It took a shared look for Mary to rise to her feet with Dean close behind trying not to favor his leg. The alarm hadn’t gone off but something was clearly happening. Worry settled into his gut at the ominous glow of the red lights.
He immediately tried to give off calming and caring vibes to keep the woman at easy. He didn’t want to scare her off by intimidating her on accident. Years spent working with victims, Sam knew that he could make himself appear helpful and friendly despite his stature. It was his specialty and he was good at laying it on thick if needed. It was a point of pride of his not that he tried not to brag about.
Sam opened his mouth to ask a question, but Cas spoke up first, “You’re probably wondering why the hive is going over here instead of the yard?”
This Cas who had once been so overwhelmed one day not long after Dean’s apology that he had disappeared for a few hours when Dean had fallen asleep on his bed cuddled with Jack. Dean knew in his gut something was wrong immediately when he came downstairs and Cas was nowhere in sight. He had been unusually quiet the previous few days. Dean checked Cas’s room and all over the house before going out to the barn to see if Cas had taken his truck somewhere. His mind replayed the previous incident over and over like a broken record every step to the barn. He had fully expected Cas and the truck to be gone.
Dean flipped the angel blade in his hand and brought the blade down directly through the head of the demon. Dean pushed off the demon and pulled the angel blade out of the head with a sickening crunch. Knee creaking in protest and pain, Dean stood tall and walked towards Billie.
In the future during the occasional movie night or while he slept, he would be allowed to remove it if he didn’t move his leg much at all. But Dean would need extensive physical therapy and time before that was even a possibility Dr. Sands warned.
He knew it wouldn’t work. The day before proved just as much. However, he had drank the Kool-Aid in small hope that maybe this time it would work with more angels. Like it had with Jack. Maybe life would return to normal. Or he would at least be out of pain.
Sam watched the scene carefully. It wasn’t often he got new learning experiences of the non-deadly, non-trying-to-eat-you-alive type. Dean had put on a pair of well-used and thick gloves to pull the new hive out of the back of the truck. It looked like a larger than an average two drawer filing cabinet but it was made of wood. It appeared to have two handles could pull open the respective drawers but that wasn’t what they were. The handle was a wooden piece screwed into the box and slightly above that was a metal sliding component that could open a door small enough for bees to crawl through when in the open position. The bottom appeared to be a removable tray.  The top of the box was a large and carefully crafted lid that could be pulled off the top.
“Everything alright, Cas?” Dean asked as he shifted his eyes from the rearview mirror to the man in the passenger seat.
The rest of the day was spent trading off naps with one person always watching Jack closely. Sam, Eileen, and Mary received updates on Jack much to their relief. Apparently, Sam had been very worried so nearly all the hunters based out of the bunker had heard about Jack’s incident. Eileen face-timed them around lunch so she and Sam could see him. The overwhelming support they were receiving made Dean’s cheeks hurt from smiling.
The minutes ticked by slowly and the angels trickled back in after spreading Naomi’s threat across most of the bunker. Naomi stared at Dean the whole time and Dean stared right back.
Dr. Ellie Sattler followed Dean as he climbed back into bed. She forced herself into Dean’s arms and started purring immediately which made Dean laugh. With Sattler (Dean had started calling her) purring in Dean’s arms and Dean re-tangling their legs together, Dean fell asleep and stayed overnight for the first time.
“Kaia, focus on me! Please!” Claire shouted. Dean looked up and saw Claire’s hands on the sides of Kaia’s face. She was forcing Kaia to look in her eyes. The rift grew immediately as Kaia stared into Claire’s eyes. Claire was trying to keep Kaia’s head focused on her. Rowena shouted the incantation and the rift shimmered into almost full existence. Now, it looked like the wasteland Dean recognized.
Time was an especially funny thing when it took a small two-hour road trip to travel a distance Sam had been meaning to go for a long time. Almost two years and a half years, if Sam was remembering correctly.
Dean expected a lot of answers but a dramatic eyeroll was not one of them.  Sam responded, “Sounds perfect to me actually.”
Cas had clearly rehearsed the reasons he wanted to sell honey. Dean couldn’t help but think that part of Cas’s pitch sounded like the MLM schemes that bored housewives do. He wasn’t trying to stop him but he wanted to make sure this was something Cas was going to do because he wanted to, not because he was worried about their living situation.
Maybe they could even take a trip to the beach. Cas would build a sandcastle with Jack and Dean would watch from a nearby towel while he soaked up the sun and drank virgin margaritas. He would have to find something Cas could wear and be comfortable. Dean would help Jack play in the water and collect seashells or whatever shiny thing happened to catch Jack’s attention that day. He may even be able to take the brace off for a few minutes to sit and enjoy the waves washing over him. Dean had been able to take standing showers for a while now and had recently been approved for small, relaxing movie nights sans brace. Yes, they were going to do big things this summer
Cas began to pack some of Jack’s most personal things as the days ticked on. He went out of his way to avoid grabbing things that Dean had in his possession. When Cas did have to ask him something, he never mentioned what it was for despite the fact they both knew. Cas asked about which car would be the best to take and Dean handed him the keys to car that Dean had spent the morning working on to make sure it wouldn’t break down. They didn’t talk about it. It hurt too much.
With a quick sign of “yes” from Eileen, Jack bounced off Eileen and back to Sam and proceeded to ask the same question with slow signing while speaking out loud. Sam signed “yes” back too.
Sam snapped a few more pictures before Dean turned and saw Sam’s phone. Looking to see if Jack was paying attention, a single gloved middle finger was raised in Sam’s direction and Dean said, “Judge me all you want, asshole. I ain’t getting stung trying to look macho. Been there, done that, took some Benadryl after.”
Once sitting, Dean rubbed the back of his neck. He waited for a minute before he gestured vaguely at the door and said, “Well that was about as much fun as getting frozen in carbonite but we should probably call it a night.
some demon in Dean’s brain said to him forcing him to sigh with resolve and begin to gently shake Cas awake.
Dean squirmed in his chair for a moment and glanced around. Six hunters were spread across the room reading. Conversation floated down from the war room from several other newbie hunters who were chattering about what they should wear and bring to the excursion tomorrow.
Fifty-seven people of the eighty something rebel camp had decided to become permanent hunters. Some were former hunters who had been the first on the frontlines during the angel war. A few others like Perla supported the organization but wouldn’t be boots-on-the-ground hunters. The rest were just people who decided to continue to fight the good fight.
Jack just nodded but his eyes shifted out of focus. Who knew how long it would be before Jack had time to get around to that with all his Heavenly duties. He looked a little lost again and more like the guy who stumbled into their kitchen not that long ago instead of a kid hanging out with his family.
“Alright, that’s enough of that,” Dean interjected as Cas opened his mouth to answer. Dean snatched the phone from Cas’s hand rudely.
A few weeks later, Sam became Uncle Sam and Eileen became Aunt Eileen. Cas checked with both of them before bestowing such a grand title while noting how many nights Eileen had spent in Sam’s room instead of her own as the primary conclusion to support his argument that they should both bear the title. Nine nights consecutively had been their longest and most recent streak per Cas.
“Morning Gloria, sorry to say you’re stuck with me. What can I do for you?” Dean said. Sam noted that Dean appeared relaxed with this woman.
“Aunt Ei, this car is my favorite! You can has it,” Jack said while also somewhat signing words he knew. He shoved a black Impala model into Eileen’s hands and once she signed “thank you” back he took off again.
“That dose is quite high for that medication long term. Normally, I would be worried about the lack of forward progress coming off the painkillers but given your status… I think it’s fair. I going to prescribe some new, equally powerful pain killers to help the transition and pain. I’m not sure how much you’ll need to have an effective dose so take them slowly and don’t overdo it to start with. They should help reduce the pain immensely, maybe even moreso than your other ones, and you can be on these long term without any lasting damage. They may cause tiredness and nausea among other things so no driving or operating machinery until you have firm control over your dosing. The most important thing is they cannot, under any circumstances, be taken with alcohol because alcohol weakens the binding agent in them and can cause some severe side effects.”
Dean was told by his surgeon one of the rare times he was in his own room that they did what they could to repair his leg but the damage was extensive. They had a few pins in his femur to help them realign. His knee was broken into small pieces and they tried to realign them too but pins hadn’t been an option at that time. They would not know how much function he would regain until he fully healed but they were hopeful.
“I don’t know I’m trying but there isn’t a way to put the grace back after we removed it the way we did. You know that. We talked about that. I’m just trying to find a way to save Jack before he stops breathing again. I have a spell here but I need more time to complete it!” Tears filled her eyes but her retort was ringing with honesty and desperation.
Sam held out both of his hands to help her to stand. Eileen squeezed his hands as he pulled her to the feet. One of Eileen’s fingers rubbed into Sam’s and, for a moment, they stood holding hands until Dean cleared his throat behind them.
Dean guessed he could understand that. Doing work for the sake of working can be rewarding. Honestly, whatever Cas wanted to do with his spare time, Dean would likely support. As long as it wasn’t too dangerous. Or if that meant hanging out with Chad.
Between each band was approximately two to four inches of space. The bands were cushioned on the inside and had industry strength Velcro adjustments that connected to the plastic/metal skeleton of the brace so Dean would be free to adjust the tightness of the bands based on the pants he was wearing. The stiff plastic/metal skeleton ran from the very top of the first band down his leg all the way to the bottom of last band on both sides of his legs.
“Sam told me that none of the other houses you boys looked at worked out. I know it can be hard finding something you both agree on but you’ll know when it’s right. Finding a house with all the features you and Cas both want just takes time,” Mary said sympathetically.
“We’re good, Sam,” Dean replied. It wasn’t a lie. It wasn’t the truth. It just was. This was Sam and Dean. Even when they were bad, they were still good. Some of the tension left Dean’s body and he felt drained.
The soft sound of Dean setting the bags down on the bed allow Sam to focus his groggy mind. Part of his mind replayed Dean's promise when he first moved out here and it entertained him. Looking at the house and it's occupants now, you would never guess that promise had been made.
Worry and concentration crossed the doctors’ faces. They leaned into view the screen better. When they started pointing and talking, the technician closed the blinds to the room so Dean couldn’t see in. Dean was left alone to wait in silence. He no longer hummed.
Dean twisted the handle and with a grunt threw his entire weight against the door three times before it begrudgingly creaked open and the rain outside splattered against Dean’s face. He turned back and was prepared to run back down the hallway to grab the discarded angel blade and gun but the shadow of Death appeared at the end of the hallway.
Dean tapped the folder against his leg and waited for Mackenzie to do anything. She was sneaking glances at him like she was expecting him to do something.
Naomi had spoken with such sadness and certainty that Dean felt a rush of empathy towards her. Part of him believed her immediately. Looking at Cas’s face to gauge whether the information had merit, Dean saw shock, sadness, and disbelief in his eyes. The silenced stretched for a long moment before Cas spoke.
“If I was still an angel, I could heal him without a second thought. Dean wouldn’t be in pain or have to suffer. If I had done things differently that day, maybe he never would have gotten hurt. This is my fault.” Guilt riddled Cas’s voice and the sadness in Sam’s struck a cord in Dean but was so small in comparison to the humiliation he was feeling. Of course, they blamed themselves when Dean is the one who was messing everything up by not even being able to heal right.
It was lifetime of memories and feelings in one. It was the fights they had and coming back together. It was prayers and hope in each other. It was the good moments between bad ones. It was the big wins and crushing loses. It was small, fleeting moments in the bunker with family. It was their defining moments. There was doubt, loss, confusion, and desperation. There was hope, faith, kindness, and humanity wrapped in there too.
Not knowing what else to do, Dean gently pried Cas’s fingers off the steering wheel. They had gone almost stiff after hours of non-use. When they were free, Dean gently helped Cas turn to get out of the truck. Cas immediately reached out and grabbed the front of Dean’s shirt and tugged Dean half into the truck and into him. As Dean stumbled forward, he used his arms to brace himself against the seat of the truck so he could stay standing. Dean heard a sob come out of Cas.
Now, there was his family plus their little extended family with Jody, Donna, the girls, and Rowena. Even new Charlie and new Bobby would have been fine.  Now there were over 150 people crammed into the bunker and about 20 angels left behind on Hannah’s unofficial orders to assist the humans in their recovery. A nice gesture overall from the angels but adding close to 200 bodies to the mix did nothing to improve Dean’s mood. For the first time ever, they had run out of rooms and beds for people to sleep in. There had been people even sleeping on the floor the first night.
Her note mentioned this would allow Dean to continue his physical therapy without question because the town had a grand total of exactly 1 doctor, 3 nurses, and a receptionist none of which could design a program for Dean. Meaning Dean, Cas, and Jack would all be seeing the same doctor who would likely become intimately familiar with their lives and still have to rely on Mackenzie for Dean’s leg. She patched everything to look official and Dean felt a twinge of pride in his chest. Mackenzie would be getting a looped in email soon so she knew what to expect if someone from the office called. She would likely still be his official physical therapist and Sam had insisted Charlie make that abundantly clear so Dean wouldn’t stop going. He was still doing his physical therapy with Cas most nights but Sam and Charlie didn’t need to know that.
After their second hook-up which was just as spine-tingling as the first, Dean said goodbye to Cas with a kiss on the cheek. That sent another blush all the way up to the tips of his ears. Dean then bent down said goodbye Ian Malcolm and Dr. Ellie Sattler.
Cas nodded and Dean felt his should relax a little under his fingertips. The guy was still on edge despite Dean’s assurances so Dean held his shoulder a little longer before letting go.
“I hate to start it this way but Cas, any idea on what caused the rift?” Sam asked carefully. He looked apologetic when he spoke and all eyes shifted to Cas who had tensed at the question.
Sam thought again as Eileen’s conversation bounced around his head like a ping pong ball. Shaking his head and letting his subconscious unravel his newfound discoveries, Sam headed back outside.
Dr. Ellie Sattler continued her quest for affection. Even after Cas brought over the steaming mugs of peppermint hot chocolate, neither cat could be deterred by Cas trying to convince them to vacate the area. Both cats followed Cas and Dean to the bedroom door which they had to close in their cute litte faces.
Dean scanned Cas’s head looking for injury and not spotting any brought his eyes back to meet Cas’s.
“There are a lot of people in the bunker. I think Toby or maybe it was Brian said he used to be a mechanic-”
Not long after physical therapy started, Cas had decidedly dubbed himself Dad one day which quickly became Daddy so Jack would have an easier time saying it. When Claire and Alex found out from Jody about Cas’s new name, they thought calling Cas “Daddy” was hilarious and Claire even called him to tease him. Garth somehow found out too and welcomed Cas unironically to the “Daddy Club” via text one night. The name stuck even though Cas didn’t get the implication.
“With Dean and Cas. Did you noticed anything weird?” Eileen asked before she fluffed up the pillow on her side of the bed.
The garage remained empty for the while it took him to leave but the hallways were filled with the typical commotion. A few people said hello to Dean which he returned with a half-fake nod or smile. No one gave him weird looks or asked him where he had been much to his relief.
“Heya Sammy, thanks for joining us. I’m fine. Just couldn’t get my leg into this stupid brace and fell over. Just trying to follow the doc’s orders and make sure that I’m trapped forever in this stupid thing,” Dean lied.
The rest of the drive was easy. Sam read out any replies to the picture he had sent and Dean pretended to be grumpy about it. Putting the bees in the yard was a different story it appeared. The beehives were spaced out in the clearing behind the barn and some had even moved to the outer edge of the forest.  Dean parked the Impala in the barn while Cas pulled his truck somewhere else. Jack was still asleep after a day of excitedly petting animals. Carefully extracting Jack from his booster seat in the back, Sam offered to carry Jack inside and was told to let him rest on the couch instead of taking him all the way upstairs.
Instead of putting the new hive with the established hives, Cas parked his truck around to the opposite side of the barn. There was a narrow strip of land between the boundary of the dense woodland and one hive already occupied this narrow space. Dean had put his hat, flannel, and gloves back on and was already in the bed working to undo the straps when Cas came up to Sam with a few spray bottles in his hands that he had retrieved from the barn.
Dean turned to find a brunette woman looking at him in earnest with a baby in her arms. The woman was behind the table for a bakery and had an apron wrapped around her waist that was clean and neat. She smiled at Dean when he looked at her and the hint of a Southern drawl underlaid her words. The baby in her arms was mixed race, stinking cute beyond belief, and around Jack’s age.
The lightbulb in Dean’s head went off then. They knew a blonde angsty teen that could fire a shotgun and didn’t take any shit. That teen came with a former angsty teen, a badass deputy sheriff, and possibly the happiest Minnesotan deputy to ever exist.
Dean still hadn’t been given a title and it was beginning to drive him mad. Jack was almost four and a half months old now and watching Cas get called Daddy and Sam get called Uncle every day sent a large twinge of jealousy throughout his body though he would never tell a soul that.
A deep part of Dean wondered if he was worthy of a title considering he spent the first two months of Jack’s life hating him. Maybe Dean just needed to keep his head down and continue caring for Jack like he had been doing for almost three months as a repentance. Maybe he still had to earn the right to have a title. All Dean knew is he wanted to be something to Jack. He continued to help with the kid anyway he could and hopefully, sooner rather than later, Cas would see that.
Alone finally, Dean stepped forward. There was no use in prolonging the inevitable. Balthazar stepped forward and roughly laid his entire palm on Dean’s forehead. Dean shut his eyes against the sudden feeling and his mind flashed that he might be getting smited.
Two days ago, Dean and Cas moved out of the bunker. Their bags had been packed along with a few boxes of selected books and supplies Sam had been willing to part with. Dean’s bed had been loaded into the back of Cas’s truck. Another mattress would be moved to Dean’s room for when he visited. Dean didn’t have much that he thought would be worth bringing though his possessions had multiplied by the time spent in the bunker. CDs, Vinyl’s, DVDs, books were all packed. The things he wasn’t taking were stored in a spare bedroom and down in the dungeon.
Time lost meaning. Jack’s steady breaths came over the monitor and Dean didn’t let go of Cas until his tears had dried up and his breathing was stable. Only then, did Dean help Cas back into their house and into his bed.
“Formula isn’t the same as breast milk, Dean. Now, please give me Jack so I can feed him,” Cas said with an exasperated sigh.
When Sam returned to them about 2 hours later, he was shaken and it took them a while to draw the details out of Sam at first. Cas learned from TV that it was a sign of friendship and comfort to offer people tea in times of distress. Sam sipped at the mug Cas brought to him until he sighed and started talking about Eileen. Once he started talking, the flood gates opened up.
Dean felt pride bloom in his chest at the praise for Jack and was mixed with an odd feeling he had never felt before. Mackenzie’s hand felt nothing like Cas’s chest. Almost wrong. He didn’t enjoy the former nearly as much as the latter.
He had calmed down enough to let Dean hold him now but Cas took the seat next to Dean, probably to keep an eye on Jack and Dean knew that Cas would not have handed Jack to anyone else in the moment, not even Sam or Eileen, despite being utterly exhausted. Jack was still fussing a little after his meal so Dean settled for rubbing small circles on Jack’s back just like Cas had taught him in their first few days together to try to soothe Jack.
David and Loretta were the nice older couple that enjoyed seeing Dean, Cas, and Jack come in. Loretta loved to comment on how big Jack was getting and would always give Jack small treats when they visited. David’s favorite past time was walking around the store mumbling “I just had it” in search of whatever thing he had set down “a minute ago.” They were technically retired and only worked when the store was the slowest. Dean adored them and their easy-going nature.
Naomi started talking, voice light and untroubled, “Dean, do you know why I threatened to hide you instead of kill you?”
The rift shimmered as Bobby stepped through leaving Sam and Dean alone. Dean was torn. He was still pissed at Sam for hiding the whole Jack/grace thing until the plan was in motion and not giving them away out but this was his little brother. He loved the kid and he was going to a place where Dean couldn’t protect him. No matter how old Sam got, Dean would never be comfortable with a plan like this.
The sounds of books falling slowly faded in the library as the last few clattered to the floor with resounding thuds. Dean felt Cas move his hand across his back and linger lower as he cautiously looked up. The contact through his shirt warmed his back.
A fruity tootsie-roll was handed to Dean who unwrapped the former ground candy and tossed it into his mouth without a second thought all while holding the baby and the shy young girl who had tagged along with Natalie’s family named Mira. She was the child of some of their friends. With Dean’s lap full of kids that weren’t his, Jack demanded help putting on his newly acquired beads from Cas and paid his dad a chocolate coin once all five chains were around his neck. Eileen received a chocolate kiss and returned the kiss by giving Jack a peck on the cheek causing Jack to laugh and giggle. Sam got half a nougat because once he had opened his candy Jack asked for a bite. Jack unwrapped a second and third chocolate candy for himself and ate it quickly with his back turned away as if that stopped Cas from watching him like a hawk.
After the house lights went up and the final stragglers made their ways to other parts of the Museum, Dean found his way to the stage. He beamed with pride at Cas and gave him a hard kiss. Turns out, Dean was surprising Cas by picking him up from work for dinner and a movie after seeing Cas in action.
Mary laid a hand on Dean’s arm, jolting Dean suddenly who had been watching the couple intently and thinking something about forgiveness, murky ponds, and loss. With a jerk of her head and eyebrow raise towards the kitchen, Dean followed Mary and Cas to give them space. Sam and Eileen joined them briefly for dinner before retiring to Sam’s room early. They emerged late the following morning looking pleased and content. Things shifted in the bunker after that. Sam was the happiest Dean had seen him in a long, long time and Eileen fit into their band of misfits like a final puzzle piece.
Dean had his phone. He knew Cas had tried to call him. For the first time ever, Dean didn’t answer when he called. Cas’s heart broke a little more.
Telling her he would be over in just a minute, Dean turned back to find the space where Cas had stood completely empty. He tried not to let himself worry but the sense of impending doom was hard to dispel.
“Yes. When I mentioned I was single last weekend, Sam asked if I would be interested in joining him and Eileen on a double date with his ‘single, firefighter brother who has a cute dog.’ You can, of course, back out if you are uninterested now that we’ve met.”
Hunting wasn’t the only thing he missed. He was also excited to be able to drink beer again. The painkillers he had been prescribed and alcohol didn’t mix he quickly established. It took him exactly two head-in-the-toilet vomit sessions to figure that out. The painkillers are what he needed in the moment to keep the pain at bay so the beer in the fridge had been largely ignored as none of his family drank in front of him in some weird solidarity. Dean missed beer though. Pretty soon a cooler full of beer after a hunt wouldn’t be such a distant fantasy.
Cas stood waiting for Dean on the front porch. When Dean climbed the front steps after watching Sam’s car disappear down the drive, Cas gave him a sympathetic half smile meant to offer comfort.
Dean hadn’t been so lucky. His adrenaline had acted as a dam and been responsible for holding back the flood for the three or four seconds as he looked around the clearing and located Sam and Cas. Then, the dam inside him burst and he was hit with an explosion of pain like one he had never experienced before.
At the end, Dean was shaking without pain pills or additional whiskey to help numb the pain from his fall to the floor earlier. He felt his forehead glisten with sweat too. After getting the brace in the proper position, they helped Dean get into bed properly, Cas brought Dean the PB&J he had made and left the room. The brace had already eased some of the pain in his leg but the bulk made Dean squirm a little as he tried to get comfortable. Dean had never felt more tired or more useless than this very moment.
Cas appeared from the dining room just in time to see Jack take three teetering steps before promptly falling back onto his butt. Jack’s stunned face combined with his first steps made Dean laugh. It looked like Jack was trying to decide whether to cry or not at his sudden fall.
Years of both of them missing the looks from their friends, family, and more. Years of things like their world’s Charlie calling Cas “dreamy” after getting nearly all her information about Cas from Dean. Years of replaying that damn student play in his mind for more than one reason. Of Dean going quiet when he saw that cute lesbian couple playing Cas and Dean after demanding the Sam and Dean characters move apart. Sam still thought of the high he got from the conversation by the Impala where he got to say Deastiel, Sastiel, Samstiel, and Casdean with Dean growing increasingly defensive until he yelled at Sam to get in the car.
Cas stopped speaking appearing lost for words. Dean could already feel his home fracturing under his feet and the future he envisioned breaking. Dean should have known this would come up eventually but it still hurt. He recognized this pain. This was the same pain when his house and mother went up in flames.
Dean leaned forward a bit from his position next to Cas and said, “Jack has been learning about sharing in his playgroup after an ‘incident’ a few weeks ago. He wasn’t involved thankfully but the teacher sent out a very heavy-handed email to every parent with a “Teaching Sharing” Outline. Every time Jack shares we tell him he did a good job and we are proud of him. Jack really likes the group so we’ve been practicing extra hard. Isn’t that right buddy?”
By the time Sam, Dean, and little Cat made it back to their spot, the distant sounds of the parade were making it’s way down the street. The crowd had thickened and the atmosphere was buzzing with anticipation. Despite everything weighing on Sam’s mind, he soon lost himself in the festivities. It was cheesy but so fun.
Cas passed a bottle to Sam and he read Cas’s scrawl that read “Sugar Spray” on the side. The liquid inside the bottle looked like regular water though Sam could see what he assumed to be a small layer of sugar on the bottom.
Green eyes met blue and Dean felt like he was drowning as a heavy silence stretched out between them. There was so much more that needed to be said but neither seemed to be able to bridge it. They were officially fake married to raise their adopted kid easier. That was that. The matter was settled once and for all.
He was drawn away from watching Cas as Mary wrapped him in a hug. Another mom hug that felt soothing and like home. Dean tucked his head into her neck and breathed in her smell. She smelled just as he remembered and the familiar pang twinged in his chest from their complicated relationship. Right now though, it felt like she had missed him as much as he always missed her.
It was Cas’s turn to blush at something Dean said. Of course, Cas thought he was the laid-back sibling.
This was not supposed to happen. If his cat had been her normal, anti-social self the one time it actually mattered, then Cas wouldn’t be in this situation to begin with. He wouldn’t be busted up in the ER on a date gone very wrong waiting for his long-term, casual hook-up to pick up his keys to feed said only-an-jerk-when-its-convenient cat.
“You really want me to trust another mechanic when I have to drive Jack around for hours tomorrow,” Cas shot at him, slicing through Dean’s excuses like a knife.
The pitter patter of Jack’s small feet running from the doorway to the side of the bed is what Sam heard next as his eyes worked to adjust to the light. He made it to the side of the bed in no time and he bounced on the balls of his feet directly in front of Sam’s face.Jack was wearing a set of monster truck pajamas.
Dean glanced at his wrist but he had left his watch on his bedside table. The black and white analog clock hanging behind the receptionist’s desk read 3:05. The woman continued her tirade loudly next to Dean as he strained to read the small print on the forms. For all the progress he was making, they might as well have been in Enochian.
Within a second, Rowena was shouting orders at Charlie to look for a spell, any spell that seemed like it would work. Charlie nodded in understanding. Charlie and Rowena began to flip through books when bangs sounding on the door rang loud and clear through room cutting through the silence like a knife. The banging was incessant like something was trying to break down the door. Outside Dean heard a snarl and the bangs against the door became more frantic and were delivered with more fervor. It didn’t sound like angels.
Cas’s face shifted for moment. Dean saw a brief flicker of hope and longing there. Dean’s breath caught in his throat. The angels were offering Cas the one thing he wanted more than anything else in the world. The one thing Dean couldn’t give to Cas. Dean would give Cas anything to make him happy but he couldn’t make him an angel again.
“Be better if Cheryl would just give people their prescriptions. She’s making them show IDs like 90% of the people picking up today aren’t regulars who’ve been coming for years. That’s why I waved you over so you wouldn’t have to wait. No Jack and Cas today? Can’t remember the last time I saw one of you without the others.”
Dean would take any number of bad days whether it was his, Jack’s, or Cas’s because the good ones full of fixing the house, singing to their favorite songs, and having paint fights were right around the corner no matter how cheesy that sounded.  Maybe life was just that: taking the good days and bad days and letting it build a home.
Charlie was still passed out on the table in the library but her bleeding had mostly stopped from the pressure he had applied. It looked better than anticipated now that he had cleaned it up. He had managed to stitch it up with little to no fuss. Dean didn’t want to waste time moving her though until after Sam’s group had gone back into the rift because it would be a slow move to lessen the risk of her reopening whatever had closed. After all, they would have nothing to do for hours while Sam spent hours walking back to the rebel camp so he could take his dandy sweet time helping Charlie down the hallway.
In Sam’s hand was a paper that looked like a schedule and a manila envelope. Dean had forgotten about the weekly schedule for everybody in the bunker. He hadn’t forgotten that Sam had been the one to send Dean on the errand to buy a bulk quantity of those stupid envelopes to catalog cases easier. He wanted the ones with the tabs.
Despite it going from a frigid winter to an early spring, Dean would be drenched in sweat by the end of everyday he spent working on the house. His back-up knee brace and replacement pads saw more use too because Cas insisted that Dean wash his regular brace more frequently after telling Dean how bad it stank after five consecutive days of tearing apart the floor in March. What had actually happened is that Cas brought his extra brace to him and said if he didn’t change it right there, he would change it for him because he stank like a rotting cow. Dean smirked the whole time he changed his brace which only served to make Cas roll his eyes in irritation.
Story Time that night approached like any other night. Sam and Eileen had been away on their first long distance hunt together since Jack’s birth and returned just in time for dinner. Sam said he would stop by since he hadn’t been to Story Time in over a week but the last Dean had seen him he had been whispering in Eileen’s ear in the library with a sickeningly sweet coy smile that made him equal parts happy for his brother and grossed out. They were lost in their own little world that Dean wasn’t shocked that by 6:58 they hadn’t arrived and likely weren’t coming at all.
Dean’s ears burned and he felt his face flush as Mary smiled at him with pride and happiness in her eyes. She had been watching from across the kitchen table. Her head rested in her hand and her hair waved around her face. She told Dean that it wasn’t surprising that Jack liked Dean’s voice so much and said it reminded her of how she used to calm him down as a baby just by singing to him. She looked fondly at the both of them but there was still the faintest hint of pain in her eyes when she recounted the memory.
Dean could read Cas easily enough to know that he was more than just concerned. He had frozen on the other side of the car with the diaper bag strap over one shoulder and the car seat in his other hand.
“Which makes five since we moved in almost nine weeks ago,” Dean spit out with the defeat in his own voice sounding pathetic.
Eileen focused intently and met Sam’s eyes the entire time as she reiterated, “I don’t think Cas lives in this room. At least not anymore.”
Dean was actually good with kids even though nobody would be able to tell if they were watching Dean in that very moment. After all, Dean had practically raised Sam, there was that shifter baby incident, the whole thing with Lisa and Ben, and during most hunts involving kids Dean was the one who connected with them. All the skills he had gained and his natural caretaking instincts (as Sam so delicately put once before Dean threatened to punch him) seemed to be at war with the logic in his brain telling him to drop this particular baby and run.
Dean was hoping that Chad wouldn’t be here today but Dean knew that since it was a Thursday that Jaqueline would be at home with the kids and the parents would be doing whatever it was old, retired people did. That meant Chad would be lurking around the corner just waiting for his chance to have a go at Cas. Dean would have to stick close by to avoid that happening.
The air between them was heavy despite the crisp night air filling their lungs. Dean longed for Cas to answer. He longed for him to look at him. If Dean didn’t get through to Cas, he didn’t know what he would do. He needed to do something. He picked the stupidest thing he could think of. He made a dumb joke.
“Lost it. Have no clue where in the house it could be hidden. Claire and I had a bet on when you would find out. I bet that I would tell you before the end of the week and she bet I wouldn’t. Honestly, I was hoping to find the damn thing to avoid it all together.”
In his desperate rush forward to save Cas, Dean had been closer to epicenter of the explosion. He had been thrown backwards much more violently than Sam. His left leg, his knee in particular, took the force of the fall and the explosion. His feeble mind tried to think back to the moment he landed and he was briefly remembers the snap he heard before losing consciousness.
Dean heard the sound of footsteps behind him and turned to see Jody come through with four strangers. She looked stunned at the body in the center of the room.
He recognized three of the four instantly. The fourth was a petite dirty-blonde who saw Castiel and smiled before shifting into a slight frown as she studied him next to Dean. She looked a little confused by what she saw and turned her head questioningly to the angel next to her. Dean had seen every vessel but there were so many of them he struggled to recall the name of this one.
“Jack was crying and I couldn’t get him to calm down. The lights blew in our room and I think it which freaked him out even more …”
One night, he overheard the nurse on duty telling Sam that sometimes they caught Dean whispering quietly to himself when he was by Cas’s beside. It reminder her of a prayer.
The notebook was set slowly against the table. Eileen leaned forward to rest her chin against her hand. She studied the paper and then looked up. Their eyes met and Dean went still. Her gaze was intense and she studied Dean. Her gaze traveled up and down before focusing intently on his face. Dean felt like he was on trial as Eileen’s eyes narrowed. Dean silently hoped that she would give him an answer. Slowly, Eileen pulled the notebook close to her and wrote her response.
It became part of Cas’s mission to read a book that would shape Jack into a good person every night before bed. Story Time had been “What sound does the cow makes?” or any book that they had bought while shopping in town they thought was cute. Now, it was rigorously selected books from a Cas-approved list. Story Time was strictly adhered too in Jack’s schedule: 7:00pm sharp. Be late and suffer the wrath of Cas.
Dean turned to look at Cas with disbelief on his face. Cas had said that so casually and acting as though it was a perfect normal request. Like Dean would be doing him a favor. Cas looked a little too chummy and happy at his concocted plan. He looked like he was proud of himself too. He wanted to help Dean, that much was obvious. Even if Dean could only admit it to himself, he needed some help. He needed to do physical therapy and it would be nice to take the night off baby duty if he was jumping back into his PT.
“Excuse you, I happen to like my truck. Kind of like how you love your car,” Cas said sounding mildly offended.
“I’m taking Jack and we are going back to the cabin. Jack’s presence is obviously making you uncomfortable.”
Cas turned a curious gaze towards Sam and Sam shook his head in response. The toll of the sheer amount of rich food he ate throughout the day was making him feel bloated and he vowed that he would have a salad the rest of the night. He replied that he was good and thanked Cas for the offer.
Mary had a hard time with Jack in the different way. It wasn’t that long ago in her mind that she had left a baby and toddler of her own behind. Dean witnessed her heartbreak firsthand once when she accidentally called Jack “Sam” one day. The anguish on her face had been immediate and she had excused herself for the remainder of the day. The following days brought only sightings of Mary. Dean eventually lured her back out but that had been a particularly bad episode. Mary had good days and bad days with Jack but she was slowly adjusting like they all were.
Sam hesitated. He glanced over to where Jack was sleeping, “Jack really is getting so big and strong.”
The relief in her voice made Dean sink into her hug for a moment before releasing. Eileen hugged him next. Like most things about the formidable Eileen Leahy, her hug was fierce and powerful. Dean signed to her that he missed her when she pulled away and she replied the same. Charlie gave him a fist bump before rolling her eyes and stepping in to give him a brief hug. Bobby clapped him on the back.
Dean wanted to ask for one more minute. Just one more minute was all he needed. Instead, he gently passed Jack over to Cas slowly. His fingers grazed Cas’s hands as they finished the hand over. Cas looked like he wanted to say something but he swallowed his words and turned towards the car seat they had set on the floor. Rowena was chanting louder and drowning out all thoughts. Dean felt his heart wilt.
In that moment, Dean felt his heart falter and imagined Jack and Cas leaving him here in the bunker and returning to Heaven. Cas may have been lying to start with but the temptation of a safe place for Jack to grow and the promise of being an angel again could cause Cas to switch sides.
Dean forced himself off that train of thought back to the present and back to the person sleeping next to them.
“It's you, Dean. It's always been you. Death-defying. Rule-breaking. You are everything I lived to set right. To put down. To tame. You are human disorder incarnate. I was going to use the grace to fix that. To kill the creator of your disorder. But I’ll have to settle for finally getting to reap the great Dean Winchester and God’s favorite, broken angel. I’ll make this quick. I have a lot of other business to attend to tonight thanks to you. Your death will set the path for putting things right, once and for all.”
Sam had stayed the night on the new couch after having helped carry it in. After a small but filling breakfast of Poptarts and cereal because none of the kitchen ware had been unpacked, Sam had slowly made his way to the door and back to his car. Cas and Sam had hugged goodbye at the door. Sam had said goodbye to Jack but Jack had fallen asleep in his playpen in their living room an hour before.
Dean leaned forward to capture Cas’s lips with his. He channeled everything he had been meaning to say since, well, forever into it. After a moment, Cas was kissing him back. Gentle compared to fierceness coming from Dean. The stubble underneath his fingers and the soft feeling of Cas’s lips sent Dean straight to Heaven.
Dean took a deep breathe before saying as calm as he could muster, “Well, the only other options are staying with Cas and Jack a majority of the time and not helping you out a whole lot or staying here and helping Cas and Jack find a move-in ready home.”
The smallest groan escaped his lips and Dean immediately withdrew his hand so Cas wouldn’t catch him touching his arm for so long. Just as slowly as Dean came around, Cas blinked his eyes opened. Instead of taking in the surroundings like Dean did, he just laid there. He met Dean’s eyes and stared at him trying to draw answers from him without having to ask.
Cas would narrate the story from a rocking chair a few feet away. Dean made sure that the few hunting duties he still did around the bunker never interfered with Story Time or anything Jack related for that matter. If Jack or Cas needed anything, Dean was there and Story Time fell squarely into that category according to Cas. Sam had gotten the gist quickly thanks to a snappy Cas and rarely ever asked for anything after 6pm anymore on order to give Story Time and Dean’s physical therapy a wide berth.
Cas was always there even when Dean didn’t see him. Adapting to being human still and having to raise a baby meant that Cas left a lot of messes in his wake. He wasn’t dirty by any means and picked up reasonably well but Dean swears to Chuck that the binkies were screwing and reproducing like rabbits.
He glanced up at Eileen. She looked even more confused. Dean guessed she had started talking again but he had accidentally ignored her yet again. Eileen raised her eyebrows at him. She looked concerned and caring.
The black ooze shot over them in that moment like a striking viper hitting Billie in the chest. Billie’s face twisted to rage and then fright as the black ooze engulfed her completely and pulled her into the black swirling circle. She let out a scream but the black ooze smothered the sound. Billie disappeared into the empty nothing.
Dean speared some scrambled eggs on his fork and brought it to his mouth. He speared a tiny bit more and offered it to Jack who appeared uninterested.  He had just started “solid” foods which Dean thought was an oxymoron because that gross baby food was more mud consistency than solid. Eggs weren’t on the list of Cas approved food yet but he was making the bottle with his back turned to Dean so he figured he might as well try.
Two hours, a thick stack of paperwork, one check large check and several smaller checks later, and the house officially belonged to Cas and Dean.  The kids agreed to knock more money off if Cas and Dean agreed to file all the paperwork with the town because they didn’t want to drive back to file with the county since they lived hours away. They seemed to be in a hurry until the oldest grandson went to hand the well-worn keys to Cas. The grandson paused and frowned before looking around the dining room they were in. The sale of the house became real then.
Dean knew that something like this would happen eventually but did it have to be with a neighbor he hadn’t even met yet? He feels his pocket for his wallet and prepares mentally to write a check to replace the bin while apologizing profusely.
"Wait, you said you were going to tell me how you met Cas. You never even got to that part," Jack said with a frown on his face. He looked like he was worried he was being duped.
Dean used to be able to jump over bars and fight literal vampires. Now, he had trouble bending his knee to the 120-degree mark without wanting to pass out from the pain. Mackenzie was right there encouraging him the entire time. She helped Dean bend as needed and assisted him in moving his body as she saw fit.
The next morning, Sam did not wake peacefully. He had slept in from his late-night talk with Eileen and the activities from the day before. He woke up feeling spent lie he did after a difficult hunt. There was a restless itch under his skin.
They ate in silence for a few minutes while they each mulled over the story. Jack still seemed troubled by something but Dean was going to wait him out. He would open up eventually. It didn't take long for Jack to interrupt the silence.
“Before we get started, I want to let you know that everything I am about to say and talk about has been downloaded to a file that will send out to three people unless I disable it. I also have… friends from local law enforcement swinging by at the end of your appointment for a potential stalker. If you try to do something to me, someone will know. They will get you.”
The two sides of his mind that had been fighting relentlessly for days now immediately clashed with a splash of a deep voice reminding him of the wrongness of the two men living alone together. There was a little thought that whispered,
“Jack isn’t dead. He’s just a baby and he’s fighting to stay alive. So why don’t you do something useful and help him out,” Dean replied angrily. The whole plan was failing. Nobody had reappeared from the portal since Jody and Donna had the last time. For all Dean, knew, Sam, Eileen, and Mary were fighting against angels at this exact moment. Jack’s breathing was so harsh that he could hear him gasping behind him.
“That sounds good. It's probably not a good idea for people to think you didn’t like your adopted son in our fake-marriage.”
Dean scoffed at that, “Doesn’t matter if I’m fine with it. You and Sam apparently are making all the decisions around here so I’m just gonna let you guys decide for me to be fine.”
With a step forward, Sam was gone. Dean waited by the rift for a few hours and watched it shrink until it closed completely. Left in the library, Dean was truly alone in his thoughts. He had already spent hours watching nothing happen but now there was no going back.
In the end, Dean held back volunteering despite how much he wanted to prove to himself and everyone that he could do it. The pitying eyes and gentle rejection would sting the worst. Instead, he said he would man the portal from this side and make sure Rowena could do so safely. Sam thought that was an excellent plan.
Letting his mind focus, Sam heard Jack shouting in glee in the hallway. A loud, clumsy knock rapped against the door before the knob turned and his nephew was opening the door. His blonde head poked in and he smiled brightly at Sam.
An explosion rocked that little clearing sending out a blast of pure white angel grace in all directions. Later, Sam would tell him the explosion caused power outages for a 60-mile radius and the equivalent of a small earthquake was detected. In the moment, however, it felt like an atomic bomb had gone off in that clearing.
Things had been going smoothly until Sam suggested the this newly formed organization work with angels as needed. Chaos erupted immediately from all sides. The apocalypse hunters did not want to work with the angels. They had tolerated them solely on Sam and Eileen’s word and their immediate assistance but would not trust the angels to have their backs with everything that happened in their world.
so many angels of late. We can fix the mess that has happened in the last ten years once and for all.
“Kathy, I have your mom’s honey right here. It’s going to be $10,” Cas said kindly despite his tense posture. Kathy hadn’t said a word and was frozen. She silently handed over the money and departed with a quick thank you nod.
Charlie gave a head nod for Sam to continue. Sam explained that while at the camp he had the idea for an organization like the Men of Letters based in the bunker which was a bigger version of what he was already working to establish with their allies. Some of the rebels turned hunters would be stationed throughout the country after training. Some would remain at the central base which was the bunker. Sam was going to reach out to their current hunter allies to help train and form the organization.
Cas’s face was lit up like a Christmas tree and was clearly relieved that Dean had gone along with his plan. Dean felt himself practically preen at the sight. If saying yes to Cas made him this happy, Dean would do just about anything to see it again.
More questions rattled off from Mackenzie and they gave her truthful answers until the exhausted physical therapist asked, “What do I do now?”
Dean just nodded. The pain ebbed away leaving behind a dull ache. Dean could taste the familiar twang of metallic blood from the inside of is cheek. He must have bit it at some point. Gathering himself for another minute, Dean shut the door to the Impala with a noticeable rough shove. He followed Cas inside slowly.
“Someone had to be with Jack and I’m sure Dean would not have wanted you or Jack seeing him like that even if he is too young to remember. I wished I talked to the doctor more. You wouldn’t have hesitated. I had a million questions but I was worried that asking them would cause Dean to run out of the office. I just wish I could do more to help him.”
Cas took off with Jack down the hallway and disappeared from the library. Dean watched him go before glancing back at Eileen had moved to the war room with her gun trained on the entrance. Charlie was still passed out on the table in the library. The old familiar feeling of being seconds away from a fight settled into Dean and he prepared himself to go down swinging. Dean followed her and leveled his gun at the door.
Dean still hadn’t gotten used to seeing Cas’s surprisingly strong forearms everyday when he rolled up his sleeves or noticing that his figure was no longer an unidentifiable block but a fit human shape. Not that Dean had been staring at Cas’s form intentionally. He wasn’t just some angel shoved into a vessel anymore but fully human who was learning how to get in tune with his body. It was like seeing the girl in Rom-com (sans Michael Caine) get the makeover and suddenly they just looked different. Still the same person just better. It was hard not to stare.
Right, Dean was supposed to come with to “grade” their fledgling hunters on firing guns. Or drawing demon traps? Or was it fighting indoors? He really didn’t know but Sam asked him to come to an abandoned house in an empty field away from civilization so if it blew up no one would be the wiser. Dean couldn’t exactly say no because what else did he have to do. Sam and Cas said jump and Dean wasn’t even supposed to ask how high.
Hiding a smile behind his hand, Sam watched and tried to keep from laughing as Cas struggled not to roll his eyes. Instead, he yelled towards the doorway, “Dean!”
Cas’s eyes flicked open for a long moment and Dean was drawn to his gaze. Cas stared at him with intensity in the way he did when they were alone.
When the others weren’t holding Jack, Dean was. Late at night, when all the women had gone to bed and leaving Dean and Cas alone, Dean would just hold Jack. He tried to memorize the way his face bunched up when he was about to cry and the way Jack moved his arms when he laughed. Cas didn’t protest when Dean brought Jack to his room every night and Dean would fall asleep listening to his breathing. The late-night bottles were no longer a bother and Dean found those quiet moments of feeding Jack uninterrupted in the kitchen in the early morning hours to be a blessing. Dean could feel his heartbreaking and the kid wasn’t even gone yet.
Suddenly Cas grabbed his arm and Dean met his eyes, “Dean, we need to find a way to give her time. Those demons are going to come through the door any second and it will be a blood bath.”
Dean doesn’t know how long he tried to crawl across the clearing and later on he would have to piece everything that happened next from semi-formed memories and Sam’s retelling. There was one thing he does remember clear as day.
Cas was still standing there and waited a little longer in the pose he had adopted when negotiating with Naomi before turning to Dean, Cas’s eyes shined apologetically as he offered a hand to help Dean up off the floor. Dean accepted the help and let Cas take much of his weigh as he pulled him to his feet. Once standing, Cas didn’t release the grip on Dean’s wrist. The met each other’s eyes for a long minute. Dean couldn’t get a read on what Cas was thinking.
Cas glanced up at Dean. His blue eyes were wide with panic and had a glossy shine to them. His hair was wild with disarray. He was wearing one of Dean’s oldest and most holy Metallica t-shirts and a pair of worn blue sweats. He looked frazzled and like he was coming undone.
“You think I would ever be foolish enough to make another deal with the Winchesters. Let me remind you the last time I made a deal with your lot, a certain former angel stabbed me in my back,” Billie said with her voice evening out and her eyebrows raised in false query, “Granted the promotion was worth it but I would never make the mistake of dealing with you again. Unless, I get what I want up front.”
“I have a broken toe! I would deem that pretty critical. And painful! You people don't care about anyone!”
The house looked nothing like the one he remembers. The house he saw two and a half years ago could have been one they would have squatted in while on a hunt when they were young and dumb. Long before their backs acted up if they slept wrong and back when money was spent on better things like impressing the patrons of a local bar and booze. The house had been livable but just barely so. The house he saw now was a home. A cozy, well-loved, family-centered home.
That didn’t answer Sam’s question at all. Dean’s response also didn’t mention Cas sleeping in his own room or in his own bed or by himself either. An expert at telling part truths while skirting around the question was a Winchester specialty and Dean still had the skill down to pat.
Dean braced himself for some anger directed at Jack from the apocalypse world escapees early in the talk but surprisingly the room was calm. While Dean and Cas were away, the truth about Jack’s grace removal had quickly spread. A few people had been disgruntled at the thought of a half angel baby but Charlie vouching for Jack and Claire punching the man who called Jack an abomination had settled things down quickly.
The way to the local clinic was a quick stroll. Dean introduced Little Miss Catherine Jefferson to Sam on the way who giggled from her place in Dean’s arms as Sam tickled her stomach. They chatted about the weather until they reached the clinic and Dean groaned audibly when he saw the line out the door.
Rowena got up from the table with a knowing look and Dean felt forced to meet her eyes until she turned away. She walked back to her party without another word.
Sam watched Dean swallow before gesturing the woman forward who didn’t move. Dean turned his head to the side and said, “Cas, Kathy is here.”
Cas leaned against the wall holding a hand over the cut to his side. In his other hand, he clutched Jack’s grace. There were small cuts scattered across his face and other exposed skin The left sleeve and side of Cas’s shirts were ripped and torn to bits as blood-stained skin poked out underneath. The t-shirt had one long gash where Dean is assuming a knife cut him through the shirt. The flannel was in worse shape than the t-shirt and the left side was near obliterated from taking the brunt of whatever had happened. The top sleeve of the flannel barely hung by a thread.
“Dean, I would love for you to help me. We’ll need to go home and research designs so we don’t need to pick anything up today.”
Cas smiled a sad smile and his entire body language came off as understanding and defeat. It was like he read Dean like a well-worn book whose owner had read it until the binding fell to pieces in his hands. Cas knew exactly what was going on his brain.
The event scheduled for the day was a 4-H fair. The morning was a show where any of the town’s kids could bring out a pet and have it judged in hopes of getting a ribbon. They just had to fill out a form a few weeks beforehand to be included and have a spot reserved in the barn. In the afternoon, there was some shows where the actual local 4-H would have a few small events. Cow judging and smaller horse events were promoted but they weren’t planning on attending too long as Dean joked the year before had been “more boring than watching Sam’s hair grow”. The rest of the week was filled with activities for the community but Monday was an easy day at the fairgrounds. There was no rush to get to the fair and everybody took their time getting ready that morning. Sam enjoyed his cup of coffee with Dean’s cinnamon rolls.
“I can take care of the ki- Jack for the night. I know you always prep his stuff beforehand and if you show me how, I’ll make sure to reheat it properly. I’ve dealt with dirty diapers before. If anything goes wrong or if I have a question, I’ll wake you up. Promise.”
Dean could feel his brain slowing down as he entered an almost hypnotic state watching Cas. He felt his own eyes flutter a little bit as he eyelids grew heavy and felt his chin begin to drift for his chest. The wooden library chair was both surprisingly comfortable and ungiving in that moment.
“Well, I guess that’s because you wouldn’t. Tell me what happened when you woke up from your point of view.”
“I’ve been trying to date you since the fourth of fifth time we hooked-up! Hell, I thought we were basically dating the last four months.”
Cas sprinted away with the grace in his hand, down a far hallway, and disappeared from sight. Spinning around, Dean saw that Jack had been shoved Claire’s unsuspecting arms.
Try as he might, Dean couldn’t keep a smile off his face. He grinned at Cas who looked even more suspiciously at Dean.
Mary rose to her feet and raised her chin which brought her to her full height.  She stepped away from the safety of their faction and faced the angels in clear defiance. The strength from her permeated the air and every eye was watching the mighty Mary Winchester.
Charlie had also emailed a digital copy of all the paperwork to both Cas and Dean. While Cas enjoyed texting and taking pictures, he still didn’t like using his cell phone all that much. Charlie knew this and that was why she had also faxed a hard copy over to the printer in the office/library on the second floor which is what Dean was holding now. He kept shifting through the package and mentally complimenting Charlie for being so thorough. He should be prepared to owe her at least one favor and a fruit basket for getting this done so fast.
Sam grimaced painfully from the sarcasm and pain that was dripped off out Rowena’s every word. He was probably recalling the painful conversation before Jack was born where Lucifer bragged on killing the witch. Sam always had a soft spot for her and with Eileen thought to be dead, that blow had hit him harder than expected.
Kaia nodded quickly and blushed. Claire flashed her a rare and sincere smile before turning back to Cas. Her look shifted to smug and Claire crossed her arms confidently.
There was a lengthy pause as Dean absorbed his words. That wasn’t the answer he had been expecting. Dean thought it would be much more like the grand bestowing of names like Cas had done for himself, Sam, and Eileen. A magical reveal to put everything into place.
There was a brief flicker as Cas looked up and gauged the situation. He finished with the customer he was working with and slid over next to Dean leaving virtually no space between them. Cas gestured the woman forward again and Sam instinctually stepped forward to follow her.
He froze at the entrance when he noticed Cas struggling to make the bottle and hold a fussing baby. Jack was moving his little body in the unhappy way babies do and making small noises of displeasure. Cas was saying words of calm encouragement while measuring out formula into one bottle. It appeared one bottle had been spilled on the counter already and the weird formula smell caused Dean to crinkle his noise in slight revolt. It didn’t smell bad per say but cooling formula also didn’t smell pleasant. It smelled sweet and bitter which confused Dean’s sense of smell.
Dean made an effort to be more present every day and was regularly put on baby watching duty because his cast made it difficult to move around the bunker. It was surprising easy and convenient people soon found out to shove a baby and run away from an unsuspecting man who can’t chase you. His newfound duties also gave Cas a chance to take naps, shower, eat, and continue to recover. Dean even took Jack for night duty once or twice a week. It helped give Cas a much-needed break not only from fatherhood but from adjusting to being a mortal man.
When it came time for dinner, Dean made a one of Cas’s favorite homemade dinners from scratch complete with an apple pie. Cas had been unusually quiet at dinner which made Dean’s Spidey-senses tingle but Dean just brushed it off as an overreaction. It had just been another busy weekend with a toddler. A full stomach and good times left Dean wanting to crawl under his covers so he couldn’t blame Cas for being tired.
“There is no way I can fix the house and raise Jack. It needs a lot of work and I don’t know how to do any of it. Even if I did work on repairs myself, I won’t have time to do that and care for Jack. The only way I could possibly raise Jack on my own is in a home that is move-in ready. So I can’t get the house, not without you with me. Not without your help and support. You never gave me your answer so the house won’t work.”
“Mr. Smith, Mr. Smith, and little Mr. Smith, how are we doing on this fine day?” Dr. Stern greeted as he entered the room.
“I volunteered because it made the most sense and we determined it would be easiest on you and everyone involved if I was your partner.”
“Charlie just responded. You’ll love this. She asked if she could borrow the hats for Comic-Con. She said, ‘If he says yes or needs to think about it, tell him he looks good cuz I need those hats. If he says no, tell him the hat doesn’t work with his head shape.’”
Cas frequented Dean’s door. Cas would talk to Dean asking him to let him in or simply sit at the door like he was hoping to will Dean out in sheer determination alone. They all tried texting him too which caused Dean to throw his phone in anger. The phone shattered against the wall and the loneliness overwhelmed him. He was trying to stay strong but he didn’t know how long he would last. The pain he was experiencing was excruciating but he refused to cave and take the pain pills because if he did once then he would for the rest of his life.
Mud was splattered across the both of them and the cold rain soaked them to the bone.  Dean looked over at Cas. Cas’s face was contorted in pain but he never let go of the grace.
Cas led his way to Dean’s door. It was Dean’s night with Jack. He felt so drained from the day he just hoped Jack would sleep soundly throughout the night so they could both get some rest. He flicked on the lights to his room and noted that Jack’s crib was still in Cas’s room which meant they still needed to move it. The thought of pushing it through the hallways made his leg ache and his body felt more fatigued.
The weekend Sam was supposed to spend helping Dean look for their Dad before returning to Stanford never ended. The divine apocalypse Sam and Dean stopped allowed the world to continue relatively unscathed. All the stuff after that with Metatron and Amara, tablets and trials, marks and spears, angels and demons never slowed time down. Time just kept on spinning.
Sam and Mary had been responsible for giving Kelly a hunter’s funeral and hiding all evidence of Jack’s birth. Sam and Mary had been responsible for answering the local authority’s questions about why the deranged serial killed Nick Vaught tried to murder their family after being reported missing for so many years. It’s not like they had any other plausible explanation for why Dean and Cas showed up in the hospital in the condition they were in. Sam and Mary had been the ones taking care of the Nephilim that they carefully hid from the world.
“I have two questions for you. Where is the Nephilim? And where is the rest of your party? We came in expecting more to be here including your brother and Castiel.”
Sam and Mary showed Cas the ropes of infant care and he adapted it fast. Faster than it took him to do anything ever. It was like Cas was made for this. Dean still refused to hold the newborn even after they had returned to the bunker the following week when Cas was strong enough to travel. Wherever Cas was, Jack was there too. Dean went from never leaving Cas’s side for weeks in the hospital to avoiding him altogether.
Dean had wiggled his way through the conversation that day out of luck and years of experience that came from lying being his job. But this wasn’t a case where he would leave the town and never come back. Natalie had known Dean had avoided giving her his last name twice and was able to deduce the exact house he had bought. She seemed friendly enough that Dean was sure if they ran into each other again she would greet them. She was just the first of many people they would meet. Cas and Dean needed to have answers to questions that would continue to roll their way. The more they delayed, the more interest they would draw, and then they would be screwed.
Questions about Jack’s diet and growth were all answered. Even their recent move into the house in a new town was discussed. It felt like Dr. Hines wanted to know every intimate detail about their life so when the next question came, Dean couldn’t say he wasn’t surprised.
Once Dean even asked Rowena to hold Jack for a few minutes because he had to grab something from another room for the plan. She looked uncomfortable holding Jack but Dean had assured her that she could handle it for a few minutes and left with a roll of his eyes. When he came back, he found her cradling baby Jack in her arms, eyes warm and nurturing. She moved his shirt down a little because he stomach had been peeking out and patted his stomach soothing. Rowena immediately softened to Jack and Dean let her have a few minutes before pretending to come back later. When Dean actually came back in, she pretended to be disgusted but Dean knew the truth. Still if Rowena had been this soft with Jack, what had gone wrong with Crowley?
The house felt bigger now. Dean knew Cas felt it too. They walked a little more carefully around the house because it wasn’t just a house anymore. It had once been a house where a man and a woman had loved each other enough create a life together. They raised their kids and then their grandkids in the house. It had been a home.
If he had shocked Dean by having two cats, that was nothing compared to the horror Cas felt when he turned around to see his tortoiseshell next to Dean on the couch and sniffing his outstretched hand.
Dean bragged yesterday to anyone who would listen at Jack’s pee-wee game about the “non-profit” Sam and Eileen ran. Sam could feel the soreness in his cheeks from smiling at every person who congratulated them. It had felt good being bragged about until the small talk ran in repeated circles and the constant introductions wore thin.
“Your brother snores, Sam. Loudly,” Cas replied dramatically while a “Hey!” was shouted in protest from the kitchen.
The pain from each step was practically unbearable but the panic he was feeling was worse. They had checked for ghosts before buying the place. The house was warded. Nothing should have been able to get in. Nothing in town suggested a monster nearby and Dean had been checking the paper online every day.
Cas dove back down/up into nothing and searched desperately. Their time was running out. Dean could feel Cas fading from the exertion and the grace was extinguishing rapidly. His vision was shifted back and forth to the field their bodies were in. The sphere still contained them but it was opaque enough that Dean could make out silhouette’s crumpled on the ground. The figures surrounded them in all directions, arms and legs outstretched like they fell from the Heavens. Dean hoped briefly that they were the angels before his attention was redirected.
Dean took the phone and put it down next to Sam, “Hey Kit, Dottie’s on deck and your turn to pitch.”
Natalie smiled knowingly and jostled her own baby a little, “That I get. Does your friend have a name?”
“I have a better idea,” Cas says as he stops petting Bruiser and straightens up. He meets Dean’s eyes with an intense stare before continuing.
“Fine, but if this gets weird or you so much as mention the word massage to anyone else, I’m calling it off.”
Cas erased his message and decided to go for it. Trying to be safe though, Cas had a few stipulations before they got down and dirty.
“Thank you for the surprising cooperation, Dean. I just realized I’ve been incredibly rude in assuming you remembered me. My name is Naomi.”
There was a pause and the papers stopped ruffling together behind Dean. Sam stopped what he was doing for the first time and Dean saw him replay the conversation in his mind before responding, “That sounds like a lot of back and forth.”
Dean did however keep his cool. They were expecting him to freak out which is why they had gone behind his back again. It was why they planned it before talking to him. It was why they cleared the room. His family thought he was a bomb waiting to explode.
“We’re not in a war anymore, Sam. We are being exterminated. Before, those angel dicks would leave people who weren’t rebelling alone for the most part and focused swatting those of us with guns. Now, doesn’t matter who you are or how old, if an angel comes across a human they try to kill them. Saw them kill a 4-year-old kid last week, can’t get that out of my mind.”
The lights flickering pulled Dean from a deep sleep. Sleep called to him and he was tempted to slip back into it’s embrace. The memories of the day before rushed at him and he immediately pulled himself off the bed. His watch read almost 8pm meaning that he had slept for almost double his four hours.
Cas must have been fighting like crazy at the opposite end of the hallway if the blood drenched floor was anything to go by. Bodies were scattered around the hallway from the fight. Cas looked injured and his blows were coming slow to the two remaining demons that were coming at him. Cas must have been ambushed trying to get out of the door. Dean’s mind quickly counted eight fallen demons when Cas fell backwards against the wall and his angel blade skittered away from him. Dean whistled loudly drawing the attention of everyone in the hall. The demons immediately turned and charged Dean.
The angels stepped back and Cas glowed brightly from the flood of angelic grace for a few seconds longer. It almost looked like he had gotten his grace back before that faded too. He rolled his shoulders experimentally and closed his eyes for a brief moment.
Dean didn’t know when he had stopped listening to the nurse and turned to look at Cas. His mind had drifted off and he had focused on watching Cas leaning slightly over the glass incubator still too afraid to reach out and touch. Where were thoughts like this even coming from? That was his best friend watching their kid struggle to breath and Dean was playing make-believe. He needed to shove his weird, sleep-deprived shit down and focus on helping Cas get through this. Dean couldn’t help many people now but he could spare Cas from a little bit of pain.
“In this story, like the best stories, it starts with two people falling in love. Daddy and Papa met in the park on a beautiful September day and fell in love. Not long Daddy and Papa met, they got married. They loved their little family of two people. They had a big farm with dozens of chickens, a few pet goats, and lots of room to run and play. As time went on, Daddy and Papa realized they had too much love for a family of two and they needed to share it. Daddy and Papa thought long and hard about what to do with their extra love. They decided the best way would be making their family of two into a family of three.”
Poultry and livestock animals were in pens on the floor. Chickens and ducks pecked at fallen food and cows of various sizes and colors munched slowly on hay. Goats screamed for attention and nibbled on any fingers that came into their holding pen to try to find food. There was even a mini-horse with styled hair and a big ribbon on the butt. It was all interesting but the smell was a little too much for Sam.
An exhausted Cas was slumped against his truck which must have caused the noise Dean heard. Dean was tempted to shut the door again but concern for Cas forced him to stay peering through the partially open door. Sam approached Cas and Cas’ hands rubbed his chest where the stitches were and over the circular scar.
Two angels, a former angel, and a physical therapist all looked at Dean like he was crazy. The blood on Dean’s cut palm rose to the surface. Dean clenched his hand to let Mackenzie see that the bright red blood was real before turning to Balthazar.
It took his brain exactly one fraction of a second for his easy contentment to be displaced with something grander. Suspicion, unease, and the thrill of solving unknown all rushed into him. He remembered the book and the bet and felt like he was wide awake.
Cas had bad days too. He was entitled to a few of them due to his age Dean would joke the next day when Cas walked around on eggshells. When the look of distance and being lost began to cross Cas’s face, Dean would do everything in his power to stop it in his tracks. Sometimes he wasn’t successful and was left picking up the pieces of Cas. Sometimes he was successful and Cas would lean on Dean when he needed reminding that things would be okay. Maybe the same way Cas would save Dean, Dean could save Cas.
“You’re not asking us to keep draining Jack’s grace to keep it open. You’re going to ask us to drain it all at once,” Dean said calmly.
This was just another thing Dean wasn’t to be concerned about, he was just supposed to put his head down and do whatever work got thrown at him. Be the grunt. Be the good, obedient soldier. The fight from him drained immediately. He would do what he was told because what did it matter anyway.
“She’s usually not that friendly. Go slow,” Cas said uneasily while praying his cat would not bite Dean.
“Sam, Eileen, and I discussed the phone call and we added on a few of our own requirements. You would have to be comfortable with the person helping you and they had to be prepared for you to fight back for a long time when you get uncomfortable. Just like you did tonight."
Claire went to speak and Cas just held up his hand with a firm glance. Claire rolled her eyes and sighed before looking down at Kaia and shaking her head. Kaia reached out and touched her hand. Dean turned his gaze back to Cas to let him explain.
Dean didn’t have any words for that. Charlie was right. He was worried about Jack growing up in the bunker. He had been for a long time. Jack shouldn’t grow up in the center of an organization surrounded by nothing but problems, monsters, and death. Not if they could help it. He deserved a normal life with a normal yard that had a regular swing and homework.
Dean looked up when Cas didn’t reply. His eyes were soft and considering. He had a half smile on his face.
Sensing Dean’s instant hesitation, Sam stepped in and said, “I guess I’m a little tired too. It would be nice to nap and relax before tomorrow.”
“Trust me, it’s not God he is praying to.” Sam responded to no one in particular. Dean had heard him and he was right. Only one person has ever earned Dean’s repeated prayers and he was already in the room. He prayed to Cas. He prayed for Cas. He prayed for Cas to wake up. He prayed Cas could give him one last miracle.
Everything was falling into place. Mary had stuck around to help Sam, Dean, and Cas as needed though she was the first to volunteer for the grocery run to get some space. She was trying to be more involved no matter how much she struggled with it. Cas stayed with them and Dean learned more about the human version of his best friend. Jack had grown on Dean to the point that the happy little baby made Dean’s days better just by being there. Eileen had returned and given Sam his spark back. Now all Dean needed was to get the cast off the following week and life would be almost normal.
Turning around, Dean saw Cas coming back to the counter pushing Jack in the cart. Yeah, Cas did look good today Dean would have to admit. He was wearing an old blue flannel, a white t-shirt, and a pair of Dean’s former jeans that hugged his thighs just a little too tight. Since starting the garden, Cas had been visibly bulking up from all the outdoor work.
This time Mackenzie stopped and waited for him to acknowledge what she said. That was probably a good thing because what she recommended didn’t sound all that beneficial.
Jack was spending some time with Sam and Eileen so Cas could get a much-needed break from fatherhood per all three of them. Dean didn’t understand how ditching one baby who couldn’t walk to take a grown man who can barely walk to an appointment 30 minutes away from the bunker to the new-age physical therapy clinic was “getting a break”. Apparently, Dean couldn’t catch a break and neither could Cas.
Cas drove them back to the bunker in relative silence. The radio filtered in songs from the local classic rock station Cas had switched to when Dean clambered back in with his crutches and the noise quietly filled the rundown truck. Cas had been all up in his personal space more than usual at the end of the appointment and they hadn’t talked about it since leaving. Cas would occasionally glance sideways at him but Dean was lost in thought thinking about the appointment.
Jack proceeded to lose his mind for over two hours in the middle of the night. Nothing could calm the kid down. Not Dean talking to him. Not Cas rocking him. Not a pacifier or toy in sight could settle the crying baby. A disheveled Sam found them in the kitchen during the second feeding attempt to ask if everything was okay. Apparently, Jack was waking up the entire bunker. His lungs may not always function like they were supposed to but they were working damn well that night.
A small sigh came from Jack has he picked up his fork and poked a scrambled egg.  Cas smiled victoriously. It was so domestic. It was like something he would have watch on one of the old motel TVs when they were kids and life like this was an impossible dream.
It wasn’t long before they were talking about movies, tv shows, and books they both enjoyed. Of course, all of hers predated Michael going berserk and nuking half the planet. Dean was excited to show her Game of Thrones much like his Charlie had shown him. It wasn’t long before she was yawning and Dean was mimicking her.
“That… makes sense,” Cas relented. The tension left his shoulders and he met Dean’s eyes with a softened look.
Sam disagreed. Whenever Dean or Cas mentioned the honey and bees, it was always mentioned together. Cas never mentioned it as solely being his and said that Dean helped a lot. But Dean never was one to take credit no matter how involved he was.
The defibrillator went off again. Cas’s heart beat for a moment and crashed again. The resident called for another round.
A huge wave of grace washed over him and eased his grogginess immediately. This continued for a long moment, much longer than normal, before Balthazar pulled himself away and the feeling of grace faded.  Dean shifted his weight from his right side to the left and felt the familiar twinge of pain from his thigh down to his knee. Dean shook his head. All the angels save Naomi came forward and placed their hands on Dean. His skin crawled as so many people touched him. Dean wanted to shrug them off and retreat. He looked up and met Cas’s eyes who watched him with concern. Dean nodded at Cas’s unspoken question and closed his eyes.
“You don’t want to mention your fake parents? You can be close to them if you want Cas, dinner every Sunday and matching sweaters to boot. It’s your fake life.”
Eileen briefly offered but we figured for similar reasons as Sam’s that I was still the best option.
Cas was kind but blunt like that. He would tell Dean exactly what he was to Jack so Dean wouldn’t have to wonder anymore. If he wasn't anything to Jack yet, Cas would say so. If he really was something, Cas could tell him. In a way, Dean was almost relieved he would finally know where he stood with Jack. And Cas too.
Cas had been so relieved that Dean offered to take him the next day that he was still excited the following morning.  Cas’s mood immediately lightened the cloud that had been hanging over both of their heads. Dean was determined to make the day good and not be a jerk that he tried to keep the smile on the whole day. For the most part, he did so. The only thing that felt the wrath still burning in him was the houses. Frankly, most of the houses sucked and he made sure that Cas knew his opinion. He ignored the fact he wasn’t moving out of the bunker despite what part of his brain kept saying.
Short and fluffy Sam chapter where we get a lot of Dean and Sam before some long angsty Dean chapters. Sam chapters will get longer as the story continues and I swear things start going down at the farmhouse very soon!
a very grumpy and very tired Dean thought in the middle of the night when he tried to tiptoe to the bathroom.
His temper bubbled back up to the surface. Dean knew he was being shitty to Cas. He didn’t need to be reminded and that he hadn’t done a damn thing but be useless all day. Dean wasn’t holding up his end of the bargain. He didn’t hold Jack once to help Cas out so what kind of shitty father figure was he being on top of that. His head hurt, his leg hurt, and he was exhausted both mentally and physically.
They weren’t long into their drive when Dean noted that Jack was sleeping in the backseat. Sam used this time to read out responses from their friends and family about the latest Dean picture.
The plan Dean spent a few too many hours mentally compiling the night before was simple enough. He made an outline of benefits and costs. He practiced arguments for and against his current plan so he could be prepared for what was to come. Dean fell asleep smiling that night because he finally had everything figured out.
Dean had been talking to Sam the entire time but his eyes never left the former angel. Baby Jack was cradled in Cas’ arms and Cas was talking soothingly to the six-month old. Pieces of his one-sided conversation drifted over to them as they silently watched Cas begin to rock Jack in slow motions.
angels, maybe they just need find where the angels are. More angels to stop this whole thing right now. I have… I have a crazy idea,” Cas whispered.
Cas felt the smallest crush forming in the back of his mind at the cute scene. He brushed it off because his likely hood of seeing Dean again was slim to none and this was just his hormones running high after having sex. Dean had thanked him for the hook-up before stepping out the door. He even had gone on to say that he usually didn’t see the same person twice because he didn’t date but Cas was simply too “awesome” to miss out on. Dean rubbed his neck when he admitted that and looked confused by his own statement. Nothing left to say, Dean departed and Cas was left feeling weird.
“Don’t worry about anything Sam is saying. He’s just excited for the two of you. I’m sure he hasn’t told too many people.”
He hadn’t intended to start trying the literal following morning. Dean was going to lie low for a few days, out of sight and out of mind, so he could give everybody plenty of time to cool down. It would allow things to return back to normal in the quiet bunker and ease the transition. He was going to hang out in his room mostly and only leave when necessary. But when Dean’s stomach growled and rumbled the next morning in a betrayal to his plan, Dean painfully made his way into the kitchen cast, crutches, and all.
Dean’s nervous energy spiked and he glanced around. The curtains for the windows were open and he didn’t see anyone out there. His therapy was always done in Dean’s room. Occasionally, Cas’s room was used but either way Dean preferred the security of a locked door. He may have overcome a lot of things but he still had hang-ups he refused to think about when it came to…  what they did together.
Dean didn’t have time to think more than that before one of the other monsters made a grab for this other arm. Dean instinctually swung the crutch at the monster who ripped it out of his hands before shattered the crutch over her knee. The third monster rushed him and punched Dean in the stomach hard enough to knock the wind out of him but earned a punch from Dean in return. The fourth monster had snuck around Dean’s back and grabbed one of his free arms as the first monster did the same.
Having a few minutes to find their way back to their group, Sam decided to push about something the nurse had said in the clinic, “So Bianca seems nice.”
“Even if I wanted to help, I can’t. I don’t know a spell strong enough to keep a portal to another world open. And for days? Forget it.”
Sam didn’t budge though and apparently the fear of getting hit by Dean was outweighed by the pity he felt. The standoff continued for a few minutes before Dean accepted Sam’s help. Once upwards, Dean used the crutches to drag himself, his useless leg, and monster brace out of the garage and to his room. Sam followed closely behind with the second brace, bag of reusable pads and wraps, and new prescription silently.
Usually for their regular trips into town, they brought Cas’s two-tone, eye-sore of a truck. The truck was better suited for their larger purchases and Dean was hesitant to risk Baby’s integrity for smaller purchases like paint. Their home repairs supplies were simply too messy. Dean would always insist on driving Cas’s truck too unless it was a physical therapy checkup at Doctor Stern’s office.
When Dean’s knee had given out after a standing exercise, Mackenzie had caught him and bore his weight until Dean was able to get his feet underneath him. For a girl who looked roughly the size of a twelve-year-old, she was strong. Dean knew he should stop judging her based on her tiny physique and gender or Sam would chastise him but damn if he wasn’t feeling a little emasculated.
With a flash of black light, Billie was thrown backwards into the wall and disappeared from the room. The table behind him had a symbol similar to the angel banishing symbol that they had used so many times before. Most recently when Dean had almost blasted Ishim who was threatening to kill Dean. He hadn’t in that moment because of the threat to Cas. Ishim would have survived, Cas might not have.
Dean glanced up and saw on the cover were two men standing next to each other with a baby girl in their arms. They looked like a happy family Dean observed based on the fact they were all smiling and in one big group hug. The book looked short enough that Jack might be able to make it through despite his cute little baby yawns.
