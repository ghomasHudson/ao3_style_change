Castiel and Jimmy had grown up with a cold and distant mother, an absent father, and disastrous brothers. Their whole lives, they’ve only known to rely on each other and no one else. The word ‘family’ had never truly meant something special for them because the family that they had by blood weren’t people Castiel and Jimmy loved.
“Fine.” He set the almost-empty glass back down and looked Castiel in the eyes. “My brother, Sammy, was on a three-day school trip over the weekend and fifteen-year-old me thought it would be amazing to steal my father’s booze and tell a few of my friends that we’d have access to alcohol. So they invited me over to their place, and, you have to know they were a bit older than me, had some more people come there. There had also been that girl from Spanish class and I was hanging out with her and talking about stuff that I can, for the love of God, not remember the slightest anymore. We ended up making out in some corner of the house and I was really drunk by the time she led me upstairs, like
The admission made Dean smile widely but the moment was interrupted by the waitress returning with their drinks. She smiled politely as she placed their glasses in front of them and Dean was almost too concentrated on keeping his eyes below her mouth to reciprocate it, though he was sure he at least managed a little twitch of his lips in return. Cas and Jimmy thanked her politely and Dean thought he must’ve seemed like the biggest jerk on earth just sitting there and not saying anything, not even meeting her eyes. He wasn’t even sure if he knew what color her hair was…
“It’s hard to imagine you talking about the weather.” Dean laughed. “Well, I’ll think about it.” He gave Jimmy a promising and small smile.
three times in a row because, as happy and excited as Sam and Charlie had been after winning their game, the two of them were still super bad losers and their pouty faces were priceless.
Dean could already be mind-blowingly tight around his mere shaft, but he had never anticipated that this was what it would feel like to double penetrate someone, and he had been grateful for the cockring around his balls and shaft since that had been the only thing holding back his release at the maddening tightness around him.
He needed to get his hands on that glorious dick right the fuck now.
With a fond smile, Cas reached for the black, satiny blindfold Jimmy was extending him and held it in both hands as he stepped back towards Dean. “Tell me if it’s too tight,” he rasped, gently guiding the cold fabric to Dean’s eyes before shielding them away from their sight and covering them with it as he tied the ends together at the back of his head. After that, Cas righted the blindfold and slid it further down the bridge of his nose to take away even the last bit of light that came through the slit underneath his eyes, depriving him of his sight completely so that everything he saw was just black. “Do you still see something?”
The pale, emotionless face. Those green eyes fixed on him, his lips in a tight smile; a sad one. A smile that says he’s content about something, but won’t ever be happy about it. The freckles stand out even more now that his face is almost white.
“It’s close. But not as intense and I don’t feel like floating after I come but… yeah, it comes close. And I think I trust you two enough to close my eyes and take in that feeling a little longer.” He smiled sheepishly at them and stroked his hand across Jimmy’s back where he still rested between Dean’s open legs.
“Just me?” Cas asked with a small smile, his gaze softening in his fondness as he met Dean’s hooded eyes and received a shy nod in return. And he knew exactly what Dean was asking for with this; he wanted Cas to stay inside of him as they’ve done so many times before. By now, he was pretty certain that Dean had a kink for keeping them inside no matter when or where, but he still liked to know for sure, so he lowered his voice into a soft one and said, “Tell me why.”
Castiel frowned, giving his twin a critical look, asking, “Are you serious?”
“He’s still as deeply asleep as it gets, so… should we start now?” Jimmy asked, already impatient with anticipation and excitement.
"Fuck, yes!" He yelled, his eyes rolling into his skull as he all but writhed underneath his boyfriend, melting under the ministrations of Cas’ filthy and long tongue. Within minutes, the Dom had worked his muscle all the way inside until he was as deep in Dean's ass as possible while his hands kneaded and spread his cheeks apart to plunge his tongue in even deeper, and Dean was desperate for it, rocking his hips back against Castiel to fuck himself on his tongue. He moaned so deep, that the reverberation of the throaty sound went right through his entire body so that he was sure even Castiel could feel the vibrations of it where his tongue was connected to him, making him moan with pleasure in response. It spurred him in deeper even, more than it should be possible, and Dean groaned loudly, biting into the pillow while muffled curses spilled past his lips in his state of ecstasy and pleasure.
Even though they have talked about this before, there were a few tears streaming down Jimmy’s face and Cas realized he had glassy eyes as well, filled with emotion. Dean didn’t like to talk very much, hated to express his feelings when it meant it would leave him vulnerable like this, so it meant a lot to Cas that he had put his thoughts into words and said them out loud. And it was obviously just as special for Jimmy as it was for him.
Smiling slightly, Cas explained, “While it might be a kink for some people, it’s a paraphilia called somnophilia or, as you might have heard before, sleeping princess syndrome, in which an individual becomes sexually aroused by someone who is unconscious, as we might know by now. The problem with it is that it is illegal because, even though a person has previously given the affected person consent to have sex with them while sleeping, they still aren’t able to give it right before it’s happening. But if someone like you, Dean, is enthusiastic to be at the receiving end and allows this to happen, – is even delighted about being woken like this – then it won’t be a problem for people like Jimmy.”
“Yeah?”
And so they spent their last days organizing and discussing the procession, cooking and watching TV together and making out in bed or on the sofa.
Panic rose inside of him as he spun around with wide eyes, and he felt like his stomach dropped when his gaze landed on Michael’s leer. His eyes were dark and lustrous, and Dean felt like the whole world stopped at once when he said, “So, you’re the guy my brothers are fucking. Tell me, were they really worth ditching me for?”
It was all Cas needed to know if their feelings were mutual and his breath hitched as Dean’s hold tightened around his fingers as if letting go would mean they’d had to part immediately.
Cas was enjoying this very much and he had to admit that surprising Dean with a warm enema, inserting the inflatable nozzle into his wonderful hole, and starting the water flow was truly exhilarating.
Following, Sam said, “She has some stuff to do. After that, she’ll be doing some grocery shopping for Christmas Eve and tonight. She said she wanted to prepare something for your arrival.” He tapped the countertop of the kitchen island as he watched his brother sifting through the fridge, hands landing on the beer Sam had stowed there.
As Cas started praising him while telling him to drink a bit of the water, Dean got a sort of dreamy look on his face and peered up at him with those expressive eyes as if trying to understand what was being said, and it was so cute, that Jimmy felt a familiar ache in his chest. In the end, they managed to make him drink some water and even eat some pieces of the chocolate bar Cas was offering, which helped Dean get back to himself faster. And once Dean rested his back down on the ground again, he was grinning lazily and blinking up at Jimmy with a knowing look right before his gaze flicked down on his own body, taking in the mess Jimmy had created.
Dean’s warm, bare feet touched his ankles and Castiel turned to face him slowly, a small and content smile gracing his lips. It felt right having him here in his bed, like it was where he belonged all along. “Am I allowed to touch you?”
“Nah,” Dean said, grinning brightly, “It’s a long time ago. We’ve slept together once, then decided to stay friends.”
Leaning in to graze Dean’s lips with his own, sliding his tongue across the tender and plush flesh, Cas whispered, “Just the thought of you drives me crazy, and now you’re doing this, for me… You’re perfect.” Dean’s breath hitched at the words and Castiel took his opportunity to press their lips together and kiss him in an all tongue and teeth kiss, swapping spit like they were dying to taste each other.
Cas was there, right beside them, when Jimmy carefully pulled out and helped Dean into a sitting position. The blonde was still panting heavily, his eyes red and his cheeks wet with tears, but he took the glass and drank all of the water given to him anyway. His hair was an absolute mess and he looked so exhausted, that Jimmy was sure Dean felt like sleeping for the next week, even though he wasn’t even done yet.
She waited for him to continue talking but nothing came, so she carefully asked, “So, what’s the problem then?”
After a moment of intimate silence, Dean nodded his head slightly and whisper-sighed, “Yeah,” which made the twins smile fondly.
Either it was the noise it made or something else, but Castiel watched Dean stir, his face turning, brows furrowing, and lip twitching just the slightest before the blonde peeked up at him sleepily and bleary-eyed, the green of them glowing like fire in the lingering light of the downing sun, and a soft smile gracing his lips. “You been watching me sleep, Cas?”
As he began to sit upright again, Jimmy stroked his hand across his legs, right underneath the rope, and Dean knew the moment his Dom saw the bruises in the shape of Cas’ fingerprints in the meat of his thighs from last night because his lips parted and even with them being outside and surrounded by life, Dean was able to hear the breathy moan coming from him. Experimentally, Jimmy brushed his fingers over the still tender bruises on either side, tracing the shape of Cas’ fingers, and it sent a spike of pain and electricity through him that was like a straight line to his cock. This time, he couldn’t control what left his mouth and a low groan rumbled in his chest, making Jimmy grin lopsidedly and Dean knew Castiel was having his fun watching them. He loved leaving bruises on Dean like this, even if they weren’t always intentional. But with all the sex they had and how rough Dean liked to be treated, it didn’t even need to be an impact play scene to leave him bruised and marked by his Doms, which he found was absolutely fucking hot.
“I thought I’d find it there,” Jimmy answered, coming to stand at the foot of the bed and taking the pillow Cas handed to him with a thankful nod. “Alright, lift your hips, Dean.”
Dean met Cas’ eyes before Jimmy’s and then Cas’ again, stopping to stare at Jimmy and asking with barely restrained anticipation, “You wanna give me a massage?”
us. Never.”
“Okay, got it. And thanks again, Sam. We’ll remind him to give you a call tonight,” Jimmy said, handing the address to the driver who took it with a smile and started driving immediately, to Cas’ relief. “Yeah, bye.”
“You don’t,” Cas answered, his voice gentle.
Almost choking on his bite of the sandwich as that made him laugh uncontrollably, Dean said, “Okay! That’s it. You’re not getting your surprise tonight.”
Ignoring the renewed feeling of anger threatening to overwhelm him, Cas took a calming breath and said, “That’s no excuse, Dean. You know that. If he hurt you the first time, how could he do it again if he was truly,
“I admit that, since this has been going on, I have read a lot about polyamory and from what I understand about it is that there are different forms of it as well. I’ve read about two forms of polygamy. One, polygyny, where one man marries multiple women, and polyandry, where one woman marries multiple men, and so polygamy is rather universally heterosexual.” Dean nodded his understanding once and blinked a few times, his hands had gone still in his lap. “Polyamory, on the other hand, means that anyone of any gender can have multiple partners where the gender of the person or their partner does not matter. And it differs from an open relationship in that polyamorous people are drawn to relationships that are emotionally involved, they tend to view their relationships equally rather than assign labels like ‘primary’ and ‘secondary’. Those are intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the informed consent of all partners involved.”
about giving and taking. It’s about not taking more than you need or giving too much. There is a balance between these and we are merely giving you what we want to give you, Dean. You didn’t take anything from us that we didn’t already and happily want to give you and if we say you mean the world to us, then we just love you so much, that we would give everything for you. You shouldn’t want to give us more than you need, Dean, because what you’ve given so far doesn’t compare to anything we ever dreamed of. It’s already enough because
There were still bruises covering Dean’s asscheeks, some barely visible, others dark red and purple, and Castiel made sure that he didn’t accidentally hurt his boyfriend by digging his fingers too deep into them. Jimmy must have seen him working on Dean’s butt because he asked, “Does it still hurt?” in a soft and gentle voice.
“Shut it, Sammy,” the blonde responded, feigning annoyance, but Jimmy could see right through him.
The best thing about a scene in the morning was that his body buzzed pleasantly with the new-found energy that the scene had provided him still running through his veins and keeping him stimulated.
“That’s right. Jimmy and I would love to give this a try if you would want to.”
His entire night was spent restless and without peace no matter how many times he listened to Dean’s calm and slow breathing, no matter how often he pressed his nose into his hair and heard his boyfriend hum contently, pushing back into his chest. The fact that he had to go to work in the morning didn’t help either, it just made him feel worse – they had had to delay their scene from Saturday to Sunday because Jimmy had an important appointment.
Nodding, Dean said, in a quiet and shy voice, “I want it for me.”
“Yes, please,” Dean begged, cheeks still wet with tears and body still trembling slightly.
and talked about that time he had tried it with a girl and how he wanted to try it with Dean as well – which the blonde had politely declined to avoid any incidents.
Then, he took the end of the rope and pulled it through the O-ring of Dean’s collar and the blonde shivered slightly as he realized why Cas had asked him to angle his arms. Now, he only needed to tie the rope off so that it was fastened to his collar and he was done.
“Gr-green, Castiel,” Dean swallowed once and Jimmy frowned, meeting Cas’ eyes.
Sam didn’t like where this was going at all and he started getting nauseous. “So, he abuses Dean?”
For a brief moment, he felt a dark thrill of possessiveness and pleasure when he looked at his boyfriend’s sloppy, used, and open entrance. Milky liquid poured out of it and down the back of his thighs and Cas shuddered as the sight sent a new wave of desire through him. Dean’s hole was a little too red and over-stretched after so many rounds of truly vigorous sex and though part of him knew they should have been gentler, the dominant part of him reveled in how wrecked and ravished the stunning submissive was and loved seeing the bruises on his neck from his teeth or the ones from his hands on his hips.

“What’s Lingam?”
“Green, Castiel,” Dean rasped and Benny’s skin buzzed pleasantly at the low, rumbling voice leaving the Sub’s lips, which was just as involuntarily as the twitch of his cock in his pants. Even though he was very much in love with a beautiful woman named Andrea, he could admit that Dean was the walking definition of hot and that watching this scene didn’t leave him cold. And he also knew that this wouldn’t be the last time he’d feel aroused throughout it.
“No. It’s… we only meet for scenes in a club. There’s nothing romantic between us and we don’t see each other outside of scenes.”
Admittedly, sometimes, Castiel still seemed a bit intimidating to Sam, for whatever possible reason. There was just something in the way he always sat so close to Dean and the way his piercing blue eyes would stare at him. Sam knew that Cas would never do any harm to his brother, though he also didn’t want to mess with the guy. Not with any of them.
When Castiel told him that he would apply the arnica cream now, Dean settled down more comfortably and tucked his arms underneath his head to rest it on them, right between Jimmy’s thighs. He mumbled something close to, “I like the warmth out here from the sun,” and turned his face to the side, smiling softly.
As if, after everything Dean had done for him, he’d be a bad dad… Sam internally rolled his eyes at that. The man freaking raised him while going through something no teen should ever experience. Instead of dwelling on that, though, he pressed, “So, you want them or not?”
alone in my apartment and I want to share one with you and Jimmy. I want you in my life permanently. I want you to be the last one I see in the night and first one I see in the morning, Dean.”
Turning his head slowly, Dean let his eyes fall upon his own features, and then he shrugged, his gaze flicking from Cas to Jimmy. “Skin?”
But then all the color leaves Benny’s face and Castiel feels how his own face does the same, and then there’s this lump in his throat that has been there since the day he woke up, but now it’s growing and cutting off his air.
“You think we’ll let you go swim in nothing but your bare skin all on your own, where people could see you, could want to join you?” Cas asked, a dark smile gracing his lips.
wanted to hold on to this.
“You want me so bad, Cas?” It was a joke, obviously. Castiel could tell by the way he said it, could hear the sarcasm laced into those words, and he knew Dean wasn’t making fun of him but at that moment, it sure seemed like it. When Dean spoke again, Cas’ cheeks burned with embarrassment, and what was wrong with him anyway? He never got embarrassed like that. “You’re sweet. Well, actually you’re not, ‘cause you’re freaking hot, but, you know… sweet.”
And yes, Cas felt the same. Merely thinking about leaving, not to speak,
, how Cas wanted to take his time getting to know their boyfriend inside and out, and getting to know his flesh. How he wanted to touch his body out of reverence and not greed.
This had Castiel staring at Dean with wide eyes in surprise because he thought of something entirely different when Dean asked what he was doing. He thought he wasn’t interested in watching Cas bring himself to orgasm but not that he wanted Cas to penetrate him. “You want me to?”
“Don't come yet,” Dean warned, breaking Jimmy out of his own mind for a moment. The blonde was
Dean was still tracking Jimmy’s movements long after he was done mapping out his body with his hands and went to their bags to search for the lube, up until Castiel slid the tie from around his neck with one hand and pulled it out. He smiled when Dean perked up at that, turning his head to watch him pull it off entirely, the soft swish of fabric never failing to get Dean’s attention.
But he also never loved a person as much as he loved Dean and he was so unbelievably glad that he was finally here, with them. Castiel and Jimmy could finally take care of Dean and give him the life he deserved.
Another beat of silence and Dean mustered all his strength to say the next words. “Cas, that morning… I’m sorry. I got overwhelmed and confused and I– you know, I’m not good with feelings. You…” He sighed. “You made me feel safe and free and I didn’t know how that could even be because we were practical strangers. And then I realized that I am me, and you’re you and I just lost it.”
Cas gave a shrug, rasping, “At the same time I wanted to buy you stockings,” with a dirty smirk gracing his lips and Dean knew the man was fucking with him.
He knew exactly how to turn him into putty.
“It wasn’t weird for you?”
It takes only a few seconds for Castiel to analyze the damage, but it takes him almost an eternity to recognize the person. First, it’s his hands, calloused and big, but he knows how gentle they can be, how warm they feel. Then Castiel tries to go for denial and tells himself that there could be other people with the same hands, so he goes for the face.
“I got a job as a mechanic and was happy with it. Through the club, I also met Benny, my first real friend. I enjoyed spending time with him and one night, we even came closer to one another and ended up having sex, which was what took away my fear of sleeping with men. And for the first time, everything was just fine and I enjoyed myself as much as never before. It was also the first time I truly got to experience just how much I really liked bottoming, but since Benny and I decided that this wasn’t the direction our friendship should take, we left it by that one time only and that’s when I met Michael.
“Okay, just listen to me now, Dean. You can do this. Stop trying to take in breaths or you’ll faint with the effort. Just listen to my voice. Concentrate on it and blend out everything else. Follow my voice, nothing else.” He tried to think of anything to say and started pacing up and down the space between wall and door in front of his bed, coming up with a story he had only ever told Jimmy. “You know, before I knew I was gay and demisexual, I tried to like girls. Everyone always told me that that’s how it should be and I wanted to be normal. So, when I was 18, all my friends had been having sex for years and they constantly asked if something was wrong with me. I felt pressured to do something about it and I knew this girl so I asked her out.” He stopped to check in on Dean’s breathing. It was still no better. “We ended up in her bed and she started to take off her clothes and I just went with it, even though I felt no attraction towards her. I knew she was pretty but I didn’t see it that way, I never did. And when she grabbed a condom and gave it to me, I didn’t know what to do. I wasn’t erected at the slightest and nothing helped – her hands didn’t and neither did her mouth… and I knew something was wrong with me… so the first time I did the smuts, I panicked. I had a panic attack just like you, Dean, because I felt like a failure and there was this constant pressure society put on my back, weighing down on me and I thought it would suffocate me. I almost fainted and you know what was even best? The girl I was with had to bring her mother because she was a nurse and knew how to handle it. I was naked and panicking and the mother of the girl I couldn’t bring myself to have sex with had to help me get back. I learned then, that I needed an emotional connection towards people to feel sexually attracted at all. And I also learned that this only ever was the case with men. I never let society pressure me after that again and I learned how to live with it. I had a few relationships since then but it took time. Getting to know each other, building trust and an emotional connection. The first relationship I had was with the man who introduced me to BDSM and it took about a year until I was able to be intimate with him.”
Snorting, Dean said, “Oh well, it must sell,” trying to distract from the more or less indirect compliment Jimmy had given him. He was still not at all good at taking them seriously and so he didn’t know what to answer whenever one of them said something so meaningful in such a causal manner. Though he was trying.
“Are you sure?”
When Cas spoke again, his voice was quiet and rough with emotion, “What else did he try?”
Dean had called about 9 pm and they had talked for almost an hour until Castiel decided that their boyfriend should get some sleep so that he could be up early in the morning and drive the last miles to California.
“Well, a few years ago, I was totally into that.”
Jimmy captured Dean’s lips in a soft and lazy kiss again as he started to move and circle his finger inside of him to make room for another one, which happened not long after that. By the time he had three deft fingers scissoring and stretching Dean’s hole, his cock was aching with need and Dean moaned every time Jimmy stroked his prostate to keep the blonde squirming above him.
“Cas–”
“Hey, stranger.” Jimmy was way too out of it to answer him so he just smiled brightly. “May I come in?”
Shrugging once, Dean muttered, “Jus’ like how it feels… like keeping you close to me, ‘n inside of me’s as close as it gets…” It made Castiel smile sweetly, once again in awe with their boyfriend, and he leaned down to press a kiss between his shoulder blades at the same time as Dean hurried to say, “But you don’t haveta do it, if–if you don’t–”
“So, you need routine?” He smiled again.
They wanted this to be unforgettable for the green-eyed and not just make it to the happy-end. While sex was definitely not off the table, it wasn’t their primary goal tonight. When Jimmy had told him about his plans and said that he wanted Dean’s whole body to be as relaxed as never before, maybe even keep it in a state of relaxation and in a deep sense of fulfillment for a few days after, Cas knew that this was the right choice. He had heard of full-body massages before and even schooled himself on how to do some techniques, that also came in handy more times than once, so he taught Jimmy how to give a Lingam massage amongst other things.
With a sincere smile, Jimmy answered, “It has its advantages.”
Jimmy watched in awed bewilderment as their boyfriend got rid of his shirt and then slipped off his sweats and boxer shorts in one go. When he was completely naked, he slowly got down on his knees, shifting a bit to rest on them comfortably, placed his hands behind his back, and bowed his head beautifully. The sight was so mesmerizing, that there was utter silence in the room except for the TV for a moment, and Jimmy looked at Cas with wide, astonished eyes, only to see pure love and admiration written in his twin’s face as he gazed at Dean with parted lips. And that was when he realized that the blonde was presenting himself to his Doms just like he’d done that day back in his old apartment in Kansas.
And staring at Cas’ long and thick throat, watching his muscles ripple underneath as he moaned so delightfully, only managed to push him further to the edge. There was sweat glistening across Castiel’s tan skin, disappearing into the collar of his white dress shirt, which was stretching over his arms, his biceps bulging against the fabric as Cas adjusted his grip around Dean’s foot to grind it against his dick, and Dean suppressed a moan, instead smiled wickedly when his Dom squeezed his eyes shut and allowed himself to take in Cas’ muscles a bit longer, watching the cords of the muscles in his arms and feeling his pre-cum against the sole of his foot through Cas’ slacks.
Laughing lightly, Dean said, “Thanks. It’s wonderful to see you, too, Charlie,” before reaching his hands out for Jimmy and Cas, which they took with a sweet smile, directing his next words to the entire group. “Thank you all for coming. Why don’t we check out our table for tonight, huh?”
“I dunno, he likes to get a bit harsher than I agreed to. It’s nothing bad, really. He told me he was into impact play and I told him as long as it was still pleasurable for me, it was okay. But sometimes he crosses a line and leaves bruises and I hate that. Not because I’m against marking, I just don’t want them in the face and I’m not particularly happy about the fact that they are
“He wouldn’t have had very long, Cas. Dean knew he was gonna die and by saving you he did something good with it… you and Sam, you were the most important people in his life.” Benny taps his cheek again. “You didn’t kill him Cas; cancer did. And even if it hadn’t, Dean would’ve given his life for you in a heartbeat anyway.”
And sometime during all this, Castiel can feel hands pulling on him, a voice – Benny’s – calling out to him. But he doesn’t feel his touch, doesn’t hear what he’s saying. It’s like Castiel’s not even attached to his body, just witnessing this whole situation from far away.
Placing Dean’s keys back on the coffee table in the living room, Cas met his eyes with a small smile and said, “Morning. You seem groggy, everything okay? Has Dean already woken up?” While he asked those questions, Castiel brought the bags into the kitchen and started pulling out groceries to place them in the fridge.
Chuckling, Cas complied, “It was in high school and I hated art class which Jimmy ‘aced’, of course, while I was good in science and maths, so we made a compromise and that’s why we pretended to be the other when it was necessary during finals.”
They locked eyes and Castiel nodded. “Sure.”
“Not in the way we use it. Dean doesn’t wear them every day with the purpose to keep it widened, just occasionally.”
Stopping, the blonde turned to look at them with big eyes and teased, “Is it another pair of panties? Admit it, you can’t get enough of my ass.” His grin was wolfish and his eyes glistened with mischief.
Jimmy pulled out the plug to drain the water and took care of cleaning the toys, even though Cas told him that he didn’t have to do it and that Cas could just take care of it himself. But his twin seemed to sense the mood he was in and Castiel was thankful for his consideration. And once that was done, Jimmy joined them in bed and took his usual position, wrapping his arms around their boyfriend and pressing his chest to Dean’s. Cas was spooning the blonde like he always did and he buried his face in the back of his neck, trying to calm his beating heart and his unease.
Dean hummed again and Jimmy didn’t know if it was coincidence or truly Dean being on the edge of sleep and hearing him, but he spread his legs further apart and let them drop to the ground, an invitation Jimmy just couldn’t decline. It turned him on so much, that Jimmy barely managed to give Dean’s lips a half-dozen kisses before he situated himself over his boyfriend’s waist to rock his ass against Dean’s flaccid cock slowly, moaning quietly. He didn’t dare to fuck Dean yet, wanting to draw this out as long as possible because he wanted to stay in this moment forever.
Dean seemed to have another plan, though, because he suddenly shifted just the slightest, catching Castiel’s attention, and when Cas looked down at his handsome face again, his summer green eyes were open to him, steady but also a little afraid; longing even. His lips were slightly parted and his expression one of regret. Cas was shocked to find shame in his eyes right before the blonde averted them and mumbled, “I told him to stop.”
“Are we that ugly?” Jimmy joked, chuckling slightly as Dean peeked up at him through a slit of one eye, grinning.
Staring at the plugs for a moment, Dean let his eyes travel over them – normal, silicone, to glass ones and nicely shaped plugs, to one that said it was made to feel like being rimmed, and a vibrator. Grabbing the last one, Dean decided to go with the mint-colored, vibrating one. It wasn’t big, so he had to be thorough with his hands but it had a nice texture with a tapered tip and t-shaped base.
Dean didn’t look as freaked out as he had thought he would and it gave him enough courage to say, “Come to California with us and stay.”
Although the text Dean sent neither explained what happened nor made them feel any less worried about why he hadn’t responded, now they knew he was okay and on his way. And it at least quelled their worries and fear enough to make breathing a little less hard.
Now he has no idea where Dean is and he’s looking for ways out of this dilemma as more troops storm the field and the gunfire increases.
The answering groan and the way Dean’s eyelashes fluttered as his eyes closed in pleasure gave Jimmy enough courage to continue and he prompted, “Ride me like you own me, Dean. Like you mean it. Show me how much you want this.”
, he was pathetic.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Dean,” he tried again, now standing at the bathtub, hand reaching out to grasp Dean’s arm gently. But he still didn’t lift his head, still didn’t look at Jimmy, and still didn’t regain control over his emotions, and Jimmy’s thoughts were running a mile a minute as he desperately tried to come up with something – anything – that could make Dean better again.
Leaning back, Castiel gave him the dirtiest of smirks, letting Dean take in a few breaths. “Fuck, what have you two been thinking about during the drive?”
Breaking out in a fat smile, he said, “Nothing. It’s just – I think it’s great that you want to see if it’s something you’d like as well, that makes me happy. But are you serious? Do you really mean it? Because if you do, it’d be fucking great. You could be like Cas’ apprentice… or something like that…” Dean bit his lip again, this time as he grinned widely and leaned in to nip Jimmy’s earlobe playfully. “You sure you don’t only want to see me bent over with my ass red?” he whispered teasingly.
Locking his eyes on Dean’s, he admitted, “The more you talk about it, the more interested in it I am and I’d really love to see you as a submissive. And I was thinking that, in the future, you and Cas would have a BDSM relationship and of course I like being the watchful, neutral part of this relationship, but maybe, if I see I like it, I could participate…?” He didn’t mean to make it sound like a question but Dean’s intense stare made him feel as if he said something wrong. “What?”
He ran his hands back up again, sliding underneath his pecs and only hesitating a moment before bringing them to his nipples and rolling them between his smooth fingers until they hardened completely, making Dean moan. His cock gave a twitch of interest, and by looking at his crotch in the mirror, Dean could see that he was stiffening already, arousal spiking inside him at Cas’ ministrations.
His Dom rested his cock and the rubber against his hole, holding Dean’s hips in each hand for leverage before stroking his skin there and trying to distract him from the stretch as he started to push inside as slowly and carefully as possible. Everything inside him concentrated on taking inside what was given to him, opening up around Cas and the rubber, although the last dildo he had fucked to prep himself was almost nothing compared to what was invading his ass now.
Dinner was delicious and they were even so generous to put the leftovers into a lunchbox for Sam to carry home so that Jessica could have some of it as well once she’d come back from work.
His voice wavered just the slightest when he asked, “You never told me that, Sam. Is this really how you feel?”
Sam didn’t like at all where this was going and looked at her questioningly. “What’s going on?”
“Are you kidding me?!” Dean laughed enthusiastically, “Hell, this is great news! My baby brother’s engaged. I want you to make it a big deal ‘cause it is. Who cares that it’s my birthday, jerk?”
Quietly, Dean said, “Me neither… I know I’m selfish, Cas, and I’m so sorry... You both deserve better, but I don’t wanna let any of you go.”
“Of course. We’d both be wearing one color: blue. Because we’re playing with Dean but are otherwise off-limits to others. Dean would only be wearing a green wristband because he, too, will be playing with us but is not to be touched by others.” When Jimmy gave an understanding nod, Castiel went on, “If, for example, Dean were to go to the club alone, he’d be wearing an orange one combined with a pink and white wristband because he would be looking to play as a submissive with either a male or female Dom.”
“I think I do.”
His ears were ringing with rage but he still managed to hear Benny’s gruff voice calling out, “Okay that’s it,” before two large hands came wrapping around his left bicep to pull him back. Then there were two other hands pulling on his right arm and he had to blink a few times to see clearly again, watching as Jimmy and Benny lifted him up and dragged him away from the hunched and pathetic heap that was Michael.
“Why?”
Jimmy’s eyes opened in shock and he stared at Cas with surprise. “What?”
At first, it’s pure adrenaline that makes him move out of harm's way and hide behind the wall, propping Dean up against it with his back, and then its pure shock that makes him try to stop the blood-flow, pressing his right hand to the wound in his chest and his left to the ones at his side.
Nodding, Dean whispered, “Okay,” and waited for Cas to tell him what his order was going to be.
Though not just their sex lives had changed after Dean’s confession; their lives changed generally.
When everything was done and he put the needle close to Dean’s skin, Jimmy warmed, “This could get a bit uncomfortable now. If you want a pause, tell me.” Then he started and all his concentration was on the linework.
“He told me he’s been worried for quite some time now; always plagued by headaches and nose-bleeding…” He meets Castiel’s eyes again and continues: “The first day we got back to camp, he visited a doctor. Dean said they told him that he’s got an advanced brain tumor and that even if it would’ve been found earlier, he would most likely have ended up like his mom… they said it was hereditary.”
“I’ve asked if the realtor knew anything about it when she showed us around and she had been so friendly to inquire about it and sent us an email afterward, confirming that it was safe to install a hanging chair. So this is safe and I’ve even tested if it could hold my weight after we installed it. And it does, perfectly fine,” Cas assured with a bright smile. He was just so unbelievably happy about the fact that Dean would want to try suspension with them and he couldn’t wait to learn what else Dean liked. Thinking about it, Castiel didn’t find any reason why they should wait any longer with that than they already have, since they lived together and all things preventing them from having a BDSM relationship were gone.
“You’re right,” Dean agreed, slightly withdrawing from Jimmy to look at him, who nodded once with a happy grin on his face.
A fat and intimate grin broke out across Castiel’s handsome face and Dean couldn’t stop himself from reflecting his boyfriend’s excited expression as he leaned in and pressed a lingering kiss to his lips. “Thank you,” he whispered, their lips still clinging to each other. Leaning back a bit to look Cas into the eye, Dean asked, “Will you show me how to use it?”
Since he had done this a lot of times before and because it was one of the easiest harnesses, Castiel could practically tie the knots with closed eyes, but he hadn’t had a lot of scenes involving Shibari with Dean yet and he wanted to make this as good an experience for his Sub as possible. So, he did every step slowly, trying to keep his gaze on Dean’s.
“No, I’ve just been thinking about this a few times today. But that’s it, I swear. I’m completely okay now.” He gave them a sincere and wide smile, saying, “And thanks… for telling me that. I feel better now. Truly. We can start.”
But Dean managed to come back to Sam again and when he had been awake and seen Sam, Dean started crying and apologizing. He had repeated countless times that he hadn't intended for it to go that far but also hadn't been able to stop himself and pleaded that Sam forgive him for doing it, for being weak. Dean had just wanted to drown out his thoughts and he'd been sure that alcohol would help doing so, but that he hadn't been planning on killing himself, he’d just been too spineless to stop.
“You’re the only person Dean ever loved and you meant so much to him that he asked me not to tell you, but you deserve to know this, Cas…” he takes a deep breath and adverts his eyes. “Did Dean ever tell you about Mary?”
“Very nice. It doesn’t hurt, much to my surprise,” Dean explained, dropping his eyes to look at the cilice, “Instead, it’s like wearing tight and scratchy rope around my skin that puts a little pressure on it to make it uncomfortable, which is just the right thing to make me feel good.”
Even though Cas and Jimmy both turned equally confused faces at him, they did what Dean asked for and hurried to get off their clothes – Cas was extra eager and finished sooner than Jimmy, even though he had a full suit and his jacket to take off. And as soon as they were both naked, Dean gave them a big, pleased smile and walked towards the end of the room, where they had a lot of free space in front of their sliding glass doors to the roof deck, which were now closed because of the shutters.
They were still standing in the hallway and as much as Jimmy appreciated sex on various surfaces of his furniture, his first time with Dean had to be in his bed, so he started to slowly walk into the direction of his bedroom and backed Dean up against the wall next to its door. The blonde spread his legs a bit from where he was pressed against the wall and Jimmy slotted a thigh between them, starting to undress Dean by popping open the button of his jeans and unzipping them. Only a moment later, Dean’s fingers were on him and grabbed at the hem of Jimmy’s shirt, tugging at it and trying to get it over his head without breaking the kiss, which was oddly adorable but impracticable. So Jimmy broke the kiss for only a second to practically tear it off and over his head, sliding his tongue inside Dean’s mouth as soon as he had it off and pulling down Dean’s jeans.
Before he continued to test his Sub’s discipline though, Cas had to make sure this wasn’t too much for Dean and asked, “Your color, my love?”
While they collected themselves and started walking into the living room, Jimmy noticed that the shower wasn’t running anymore, and only then did he realize that Dean still hadn’t come out of the bathroom after what had possibly been 15 minutes. When he met Cas’ eyes, he saw that his twin had noticed this as well, if the worried look he was directing towards the bathroom was anything to go by.
, “or that I have problems with my gender. I don’t even know why they assume that, just because I like to give up power and control, doesn’t mean I feel less like a man. I don’t want to be a woman and I feel good with my body and myself. I just like to be dominated, I dunno why it’s always connected to women. Like there is nothing gender-typical about being a Dom. There are male dominants and there are Dommes, end of the story. I mean, I don’t ask women I meet that work as engineers or anything if they feel manly because of what they do…”
When they broke this kiss too, Dean was panting harshly, his lips were glistening with saliva and pink from all the attention. It was always a wonderful sight and Castiel took it all in greedily. The way his shoulders rose and fell with his breathing, his eyes shone with mirth and lust, and how the corners of his lips pulled up in a slight grin. His shoulders were bare since the blanket had slid down to the crook of his arms, uncovering the beautiful skin of his neck and chest and shoulders, and Castiel saw that he was beginning to freckle in the sun. Little brownish dots did not only dust over his cheeks now, but also across his shoulders and chest, and Castiel wanted to count and touch and kiss every single one of them, and he felt an almost irresistible ache in his fingers to touch.
At first, Dean wanted to shake his head, because
Jimmy nodded and opened the cap of the lubricant, smiling as it popped open. He poured some of the liquid into his palm and closed the bottle again, throwing it aside, then coated his fingers with lube, making sure it was warm enough to not shock Dean into wakefulness. Then, he started to circle his lover’s hole with one lubed finger, trying to coax it to open up to him naturally, and once he achieved that, he eased a finger inside and began to prep Dean.
, tap tap.
As much as Jimmy loved to take care of Dean as well, he knew it had a different meaning for him than it held for Castiel. And just watching his twin be his true self and do what he loved most with this much affection and love in his eyes – plus the reminder of him thinking that Cas had just purposefully hurt Dean – made Jimmy’s eyes sting with emotions.
It was one of Dean’s absolutely delicious grilled cheese sandwiches and as much as Cas’ mouth started watering at the sight with the want to just take a bite of it, Castiel directed a questioning look at Dean because he still didn’t understand why he was home already and wearing lingerie, asking one more time, “What’s going on?”
Nodding faintly, Dean met his eyes again and whispered, “Yeah. He did it before once and I told him that I never wanted to try whips or canes with him again and that he should stick to the basics.” Behind them, Jimmy shifted into a more upright position to be able to look at Cas and Dean, following their conversation intently as their boyfriend said, “It was two weeks ago.”
“What if I'm already comfortable?” Dean asked, cocking a brow at Jimmy.
This was the hardest Jimmy had ever come and the fact that Dean managed to bring him over the edge without making his orgasm crest before exploding, told him just how amazing Dean was.
“Because we don’t know how you will react and we need you to be with us to be able to tell us how you feel. Does it make sense to you?”
The firework didn’t cease for about forty minutes and the five of them listened to its hissing and crackling as colors sparkled down like glitter, its light reflecting on the surface of the water and making the world seem to glisten and shine. Throughout it, Cas and Jimmy had their arms wrapped around Dean, just like Sam and Jess had around each other, and they watched in awe as the blonde grinned happily while his eyes tracked the lights.
Castiel seemingly enjoyed himself as he playfully rolled his hips into Dean, probably making sure to stimulate Dean’s prostate, and slowly pulled back out with a wide grin on his face only to roll them against his Sub and penetrate him again and again. After a while, Dean started to get hard once more, his cock bouncing with each thrust of Cas into him, and Jimmy smiled when he noticed how Dean’s fingers itched to touch himself where they rested so close to his cock.
God, he loved them so much.
At that, Dean’s gaze locked with his again and he hurried to say, “No! It’s not that I don’t want you. God, I want you so bad, more than I ever wanted anyone.” Castiel didn’t understand and he frowned, which Dean must have gotten, because he continued, “I think that’s why. You’re not just some warm body willing to have sex with me. I actually like you and even if this is gonna be the only time we see each other, I don’t want it to be hurried and I wouldn’t want this while we were drunk. Not like that.”
did that hurt deep inside. “Why would I?” he asked instead, and Castiel dropped the towel, standing up in front of Dean, then grasped his face with both hands and stared deeply into his emerald eyes.
Although his disappointment was short-lived when he felt the smooth and lubed surface of a sound pressing at his slit as Castiel grasped Dean’s cock to hold it in place. He was slow and gentle when he started to push it inside and slide it in all the way, and Dean took in the feel of its texture as bead after big bead slid inside to stuff him full. Once it was all the way inside, he realized that Cas had chosen one of the longer ones that reached his prostate and he wanted more than anything at that moment to move his dick and stimulate his pleasure spot with the rod, but he was still restrained, so he just took a few deep breaths to regain some control and prepare himself for more to come.
Turning, Dean winked at a knowingly sliming Castiel, who gave a nod as if to allow him to leave with Jimmy, and then grabbed his hand to drag him toward the restrooms unceremoniously. Jimmy couldn’t do anything but follow, a mischievous smirk gracing his lips the entire way there, but that got pretty much wiped off of his face as soon as Dean pushed him backward into a stall and locked the door before stepping entirely into his personal space and attacking his mouth in a dirty and wet kiss.
They reached the table and were greeted with wide and amused eyes, their friends staring at them with knowing smirks as Dean and Jimmy took their seats and sat down, their food probably only lukewarm at this point. Castiel leaned in to give Dean a lingering kiss and smiled softly – but just as knowingly as the rest – and it was completely silent for a whole minute until Gabriel blurted, “You two just fucked, admit it.”
A few minutes later, he heard the door sliding open and footsteps approach until they suddenly stopped a few feet away from him and Dean felt panic rise inside him.
He had to cut off the train of thoughts there in order to be able to concentrate on finishing Dean’s tattoo, so he asked another question. “What’s the craziest or best thing you’ve ever done or when have you felt your biggest adrenaline rush?”
Afterward, they had showered together with Jimmy and then made Dean go into bed, naked. Cas had been so worn out and tired, that Jimmy had provided for aftercare last night. But he’d been very enthusiastic and gentle, which had warmed Cas’ heart in a different way than Dean’s beautiful compliance had done.
Behind him, Jimmy pressed his lips to the back of his neck, his hands gripping Dean’s bared hips where his pants hung open and low. He pushed his thumbs past the waistband of the panties and dug them into his flesh as he pulled Dean back against his chest possessively, his tongue sliding across his neck, under his chin, and along the edge of his jaw.
While those words soothed a bit of his turmoil and worries, it still didn’t make Jimmy feel any better about what Dean had gone through just then. And as if knowing what he was thinking about, Cas said, “I’m sorry I didn’t pay attention to you, though, Jimmy. That’s my job, too. I should’ve known that this was going to be too much for you. When our punishments have up until now always been pleasurable to some extent. But seeing Dean being hurt like this… it hurt you, and I’m really sorry, Jimmy. You love him just as much as I do and I did this
From what Jimmy was able to see, it was a very wet and passionate kiss with a lot of tongue, Dean smiling brightly against Cas’ lips as the Dom happily indulged in their make-out session. At some point, Cas seemed to widen his stance underwater, bringing up a hand to card through Dean’s dripping wet hair. It was longer now, curling around the back of his neck, some strands of his hair falling into his eyes, and it was long enough for Cas to hold onto and take advantage of to tilt Dean’s head in every which way he pleased to have better access to his mouth. The Dom pulled him into a bruising kiss, which was scarcely more than a clash of teeth and tongue by now as Dean wrapped his legs tightly around Castiel’s waist, probably hooking his ankles together at the small of Cas’ back, providing the perfect angle for Castiel’s wandering hand, which was slowly making its way back down underneath the surface. Jimmy knew exactly what he was doing when Dean’s breath hitched and the kiss stopped abruptly, his eyes closing as he leaned his forehead against Castiel’s with an open mouth.
The blonde scrambled to reach the nightstand drawer to retrieve a bottle of lube and once he got it, he shifted so that he was hovering over Jimmy with his knees bracketing his ass, his crotch at chest level. Without speaking, he opened the lubricant and poured a generous amount of it onto his fingers before throwing it out of view and spreading the liquid. After that, he used his clean hand to place it on Jimmy’s shoulder, propping himself up like that, and reached his right hand behind his back.
Dean turned to look at them in disbelief and asked, “Really?” Yeah, he was truly speechless. No one had ever done something so special for him and he just couldn’t believe his luck.
It was about two and a half hours later when Dean came out of his room and strayed down the hallway into the bathroom half asleep with a towel clutched in his hand. He hummed contently to himself and Sam looked up from his laptop where it was placed on his legs and smiled faintly. He had missed this. The door closed and not long after that, Sam could make out the sound of running water, so he went back to typing away on the keypad and finishing his essay.
“Dean, baby, whatever you think you’ll do to let us down, it’s not real. There’s nothing in the world that could ever separate us from you, Dean,” Jimmy clarified with a gentle voice, his tone leaving nothing to argue about, though.
Happy new year everyone!
This man – his
Jimmy decided to stop keeping Dean in the dark and cut off his sentence to explain. “You’re Dean, right?” When he received a hesitant nod, Jimmy went on, “You met my brother, Castiel.”
“And it’s not like we’ve never used those to double penetrate you before…” Jimmy reminded, grinning broadly at the memory. That had been one of the hottest scenes they’ve ever had and he wasn’t opposed to recreating it.
Benny changed the position of his feet to get into a more comfortable one and took in the stage in front of him. He had the perfect view since they’d been early enough that he’d been able to snatch a spot very close to the stage, which Dean had been very glad about as well. They’ve known each other for a long enough time that Benny knew Dean still got super nervous during certain scenes, especially during a public one like this – considering he’d never done this before – and he also knew that his attendance and being a sort of mental support for Dean helped the Submissive to keep a clear head. And it made sense, really, if one took into consideration that Benny used to be Dean’s personal spotter back at the club in Kansas.
Christmas turned out to be great. Sam got to see his brother happily smiling again and he felt so content having him around with Jess being there as well. They seemed to have a connection, to understand each other, and it filled Sam with joy to see them joking around, even if it was at his own expanse. He was glad they managed to cheer Dean up again.
Once his hands were freed, Castiel instructed Dean to clench and move his fingers and wrists to see if he felt any aches while Jimmy grabbed a glass of juice and guided it towards Dean’s lips to make him drink, then fed him the granola bar after he downed half of the drink. As soon as they checked if he was alright and made him finish his snack and drink, they both fell down sideways onto the mattress and pulled Dean’s lax and boneless body into the cradle of their own. Warm with satisfaction, Cas stroked his fingers through their boyfriend’s sweat-dampened hair and grinned widely when he snuggled backward into Castiel’s hold.
“Emmanuel is a guardian angel and Castiel the angel of Thursday.”
huh? You’re really fascinating, Dean. I like your taste. And it sounds like a nice ritual.” He took a sip of his coffee to see if it was too hot but found it ready to drink.
ALSO, from now on, it’ll be very smutty and fluffy…
And it was true, Dean did have slight problems when it came to peeing in front of them, which was oddly weird. He could masturbate in front of them, watch them insert sounds into his slit, let them finger him or eat him out, but he struggled to empty his bladder with them in a room. Well, he could, but it took a few minutes until he felt good enough around them to let go and it always made Jimmy smile.
“How so?”
“So,” Sam said all of a sudden, turning Dean’s attention back to him. He let his eyes drag over the field as he angled his head to look at his brother, cold can of coke in his hand. There was an amused smile tugging at Sam’s lips, his eyebrows raised and expression curious. “Gabriel, huh?”
Straightening up, he gave Jimmy a thankful smile and turned back around to face Cas with a sheepish look. “Thanks.”
“Haha, Jimmy the terrible cook,” he quipped, rolling his eyes in fake annoyance, “doesn’t get old at all.”
Turning his head to look at him, Dean grinned brightly and nodded, chuckling, “Come here, you dork,” as he reached out for Cas’ hand to tug him in. He hugged him from behind then, cuddling up to Dean’s back and joining their slight swaying, and just enjoyed being so close to and intimate with each other.
Castiel only stared, unblinking, as his fingertips danced along the edge of his jaw. “You’re a very beautiful man, Dean. Has anyone ever told you that?”
Christmas Eve was boring and lonely even though Castiel spent it with his family. Jimmy was late for dinner and he hated having to talk to his mother and other brother alone without Jimmy's back-up.
“‘m not shy,” Dean denied with a petulant frown. But he couldn’t hide his amusement for long, especially not when Jimmy raised his eyebrows in a suspicious expression, and he snorted before chuckling slightly.
“I’ve been wanting you to use my mouth as a cockwamer,” Dean rasped, dark eyes boring into his own, and yeah, Castiel totally didn’t almost choke on his own spit at that. “I’d be buck-ass naked… maybe underneath this exact table with your dick down my throat while you enjoy a sandwich just like that. Or maybe you could read a book or watch TV while I do my thing and keep you warm…”
Still utterly confused, Jimmy asked, “Dean? What’s going on?” and met his boyfriend’s eyes as the man turned around with a fat smile.
When Dean nodded this time, his expression was full of faith and love. Seeing it all in those peridot eyes made Castiel strongly believe that those words were true. And he’d do everything for them to stay right.
Sighing, Dean propped his elbows up onto his knees and bent forward slightly, letting his intertwined hands fall between his legs. “You remember Cas?” At their concurrent nodding, Dean went on, “Good. I was out to find someplace to eat three days ago and I crossed paths with Cas’ twin. Of course, I didn’t know that then and kissed the guy but he didn’t kiss back, saying he hadn’t met me before but knew I was Dean. He told me his name was Jimmy and that he was Cas’ twin brother – identical, obviously. And then he brought me to a place where I had that amazing burger and pie and we talked, which’s how I figured he was a tattooist.”
“So you lied?”
The small hallway was open to downstairs but there was a waist-level wall to ensure that no one accidentally fell down there and when they walked up the stairs, they were facing the sliding door to the patio.
“Stay awake a little longer until we’ve gotten you into a private room and you’ve had something to drink and eat, Dean. Don’t fall asleep yet,” Cas warned softly as he walked across the stage to press the button again, and Jimmy tightened his hold around Dean to make sure he didn’t fall now that the rope was no longer suspending him. Merely a few seconds after, Jimmy was able to hear a soft humming noise coming from Dean and he smiled fondly when he saw that Dean was drifting off to whatever place he went after a scene.
Though, Jimmy lifted a reprimanding finger and
He set a slow but hard pace, fucking Dean with all he had while grunting into his ear, and the sound was like music to Dean, hearing his Dom fall apart because the pleasure he took from Dean was all too much. Dean found his body molding to Castiel’s extremely interested one, slumping against him and letting himself be used however Cas wanted while solely concentrating on the feel of his boyfriend’s rock-hard and huge cock thrusting in and out of his tight hole.
It still felt weird merely saying it in his head, but doing so out loud was a whole new level of strange. Which he did; the morning he came home and told Sam and Jessica all about his last two days and apologized for acting the way he did and being absent. He had told them about his night with Cas, then the morning after where he had had his ‘freak-out’ and how he’d visited Jimmy after that. Sam and Jess had listened as he had talked about how Jimmy had wanted to have Cas over to talk this out and that they had done so, after another ‘freak-out’ and almost panic attack. And he’d also told them about how they wanted this to go, explained what their relationship was like. Sam had blanched at him during the first attempts at explaining understandably how they would make this work as a polyamorous relationship and that Jimmy and Cas weren’t interested in incest, gaping at him with his hazel eyes big as saucers while Jessica had merely listened and smiled.
Meeting his eyes with lust-blown ones, Jimmy said, “Ours. Only we get to have you like this.”
“Okay,” he drawled, his eyes twinkling with excitement, “I’ll give you two a clue, and this clue is also gonna be your order: keep your hands to yourself. No touching.”
For a second, Dean’s heart rate sped up and he thought about how to answer that because his throat went dry, but then he got another message and he wished Cas was in the room with him so he could punch and kiss the holy life out of the man.
The two of them spent some more time together and made moon eyes at each other while talking about how they were going to celebrate New Year’s until the waiter came and Cas asked for the bill. He insisted that he pay everything even though Dean tried to coax him to split the bill – Castiel would have none of it. And Dean had to admit that this side of him was a huge turn on. It was when he got to see the dominant part of him and how was Dean supposed to resist that?
“Yeah. I think that’s nice. And I like you two, so why shouldn’t I wear something that represents our relationship?”
It was the first night Castiel didn’t dream about Dean dying. He dreamed that he was planting new vegetables into their small garden in the back while Dean watched him with a smile. In this dream, Dean’s skin was tanned and freckles adorned every uncovered inch of skin and his vibrant green eyes sparkled gold whenever the sunlight caught in them.
Dean used his arms to lift his shoulders and his head enough to look at Cas, a drop of sweat running down his forehead and stopping at his eyebrow at the motion. “Yes, Castiel.”
Chuckling, the blonde teased, “Why Sir, so you don’t die of a heart attack just watching it disappear between my cheeks…” The finger that was shaking in front of his face before was now tracing down a line from his chin to his chest playfully, stopping where his heart lay beneath to place his hand above the spot, and Dean leaned in again, whispering, “That would be a shame.”
Grabbing his gloves and starting to take them on, he motioned at Dean’s shirt and ordered, “Take this off then,” as if it personally offended him. “Let me see some skin.” Jimmy was feeling a bit cocky right now and flashed Dean a seductive smirk.
Frowning, Dean asked, “That would explain why you know my name but not why you knew it was
“Dean?” Benny asked, sounding cautious and contrite, “don’t mind me asking but… you look terribly pale right now and I just… it got me questioning – did something happen between you and Michael before you left?”
In front of them, Cas sat down comfortably with his legs crossed and watched with slightly hooded eyes as Dean stayed still to also adjust to Jimmy, although he didn’t feel a difference when it came to their dicks – both felt amazing. When Dean placed his arms in front of him, between his boyfriend’s parted legs, and propped himself up on them to lean forward, he could feel Jimmy’s hands splaying out across his ass, fingertips digging into his flesh as his thumbs slid down his cleft to where he was buried deep inside of him.
“Okay. I was just making sure that you were comfortable,” Cas said with a small and pleased smile crossing his lips. “Would you still want to continue, though?”
Feeling Dean tip over the edge was amazing, but watching him orgasm was a sight he would savor for all time and he watched in awe as Dean’s body twitched with the aftershocks of his release above him, barely keeping himself from orgasming as well as the blonde spasmed around him, throbbing and clenching and so unbelievably tight and hot. Somehow, Jimmy managed to keep himself together and for only a moment, he was impressed with that, but then Dean shifted just the slightest and there it was – he didn’t have any control over his body as this tiny movement triggered his orgasm and he came in pulses into the condom, nestled deep inside of Dean while stars danced behind his closed eyelids and he felt as though he was releasing pent-up energy of a week’s worth.
I could spend hours like that.”
“Hey,” he greeted and just then realized how low and raspy his voice was.
After they calmed down from their amusement, they fell into comfortable silence and finished preparing the sticks, the salad, and the bread on sticks. By the time they were done with that, it was already past seven and the sun had set, so they all decided to start collecting their stuff and carry it to the beach.
Dean looked like an angel above him and he was as bright as the sun, when he laughed as he did in the café a few days ago, but also when he was as vulnerable and bared for Jimmy like he was right then. And Jimmy knew that, if he looked too long, he’d be blinded by Dean’s radiance, his being forever imprinted in his mind.
“Dean was right…” Cas mumbled, his voice soft and gentle, and he tilted his head to look at him. “You’re dropping, Jimmy. Dean’s perfectly fine even though he seems a little shaken. But that’s normal after such an intense session.”
Then, in the evening, they had given Dean the promised cold enema while using rope bondage to tie his arms to a wooden beam in their bedroom to keep him in that position and had let him stay like this for twenty minutes. Just as Dean had started to cramp up from the coldness, Cas and Jimmy had taken off his cock cage and pulled out the nuzzle while telling him the last part of his punishment.
“We really didn’t. I would have remembered a pretty face like that,” Jimmy grinned when he just looked more confused. Admittedly, it was a bit mean to play with him like that but having a twin could be truly entertaining sometimes.
It felt like it was burning through the fabric of his trousers. “Really, it’s okay. I’ll tell you what, it’s about a two days’ drive and one night in a cheap motel away from here.”
cry loudly during sex – even more. He was fucking enjoying this, feeling as good as ever even with all the aches and the exhaustion but he was still not able to freaking climax soon enough and he started to feel bad for Cas. Because the man had to keep going – for what, forty minutes? – until Dean finally felt the first few traces of a climax building low in his belly.
Eyes wide, Dean sputtered, “God, no! No… she told me she hadn’t been this drunk and thought about using condoms. I felt so bad afterward… I made myself watch videos about pregnancies and birth-giving and sexual diseases to scare the holy shit outta me so that I’d never forget to use condoms on my own ever again.”
“You know that, as soon as he realized it was you, he was fine and regretted it even,” Jimmy said, his voice calm and soothing and his expression soft and sympathetic. “He knows you’d never hurt him.”
While he put on his shirt and did the buttons, Dean noticed his eyes were welling up with tears and he didn’t even know why.
Placing his forefinger underneath Dean’s chin, Jimmy made his boyfriend look at him and clarified, “We don’t want you to want to go because of us, or
After about an hour of talking, Charlie told Dean that she had some errands to run and ended the call, leaving him in front of the TV and flipping through channels until he decided to watch a few episodes of
Making their boyfriend comfortable in all ways around them was their goal and also the reason why Castiel had suggested it after Dean had left the bathroom tonight. And Jimmy was always on board with that. More so because of the fact that he got to take Dean into his mouth.
Meeting his eyes with big and concerned ones, Dean asked, “Where is he, what’s wrong?”
They kept chasing each other’s taste until they broke apart for a few breaths and resumed kissing as if being apart from one another wasn’t an option as soon as their lungs allowed it. This time, they used more tongue and it got even more passionate and enthusiastic. And when Cas playfully grazed Dean’s bottom lip with his teeth, he could feel more than hear the rumble of his chest as he moaned slightly. It encouraged Cas to bite down on Dean’s bottom lip and tug at it just enough to coax another lovely sound out of Dean. He alternated between kissing and nibbling then, smiling against Dean’s lips as he felt the blonde gripping his arms tightly.
Nodding enthusiastically, the blonde agreed, “Totally.”
When he entered the bedroom, he pulled out his favorite pair of sweats and a white tee, stopping in front of his dresser and opening the top drawer to pick what to wear underneath. He was about to grab a pair of cotton briefs when his eyes caught sight of something purple and he pulled on it. Dean had totally forgotten that he bought them once because the only pair he ever wore were the blue ones, which he began to search for as the thought hit him, uttering a triumphant “ha!” as his fingers brushed over the well-known soft and most wonderful fabric his genitals were ever covered with.
Their words made butterflies go wild in his stomach and Dean had never thought such a cheesy thing without wanting to slap himself. This was real and it was only for him. Because he was theirs and they were his.
Jimmy and Cas put their toiletries in the bathroom and Castiel was thrilled to see his and his brother’s toothbrushes in the same glass as Dean’s, even if it was silly. But it meant a lot to him and was a symbol for how far their relationship had already come, so sue him.
shower.” Dean started laughing and his body’s movement brought the whole couch to jerk with it. Sam’s laptop almost lost balance, but he secured it on his thighs and smacked his brother into his head for it, which just made him laugh harder. Now Sam couldn’t hide his own amusement and turned his body as much as possible without tossing his laptop and looked at Dean. His brother was laying on his stomach, legs stretched out behind him, and had shoved a cushion underneath his head – one arm was underneath, the other one rested half above, so that his hand was resting loosely in front of his face. Its wrist was covered with a black leather band with a small silver ring at the front – Sam had yet to find out its meaning. The position made Dean’s tee ruck up so that his lower back was bared and Sam felt a wave of nausea as he stared at the red, thin lashes littering it. The skin didn’t look broken, but the lines were still visible and it made him want to punch whoever hurt Dean like this.
Chuckling, Jimmy agreed, “Hell, yes. That sounds nice,” at the same time as Cas said, “Whatever you want, Dean.”
“It’s nothing fancy, but it does,” Dean shrugged and stuffed his hands into the back pockets of his jeans, turning around and walking out of the room.
A moment later, Dean stood and turned to face him again, quickly meeting Jimmy’s eyes with a mischievous glint and winking at him before resuming his sexy bouncing as the next song started to play – Scorpions with
There was this look of hurt and guilt again and now Jimmy felt bad about accusing Castiel of such a thing. This man could never be the monster his mind wanted to make him into after seeing Dean in such pain, and Jimmy knew that. He always did. Cas had a pure heart and he cared about Dean more than he ever did about someone else.
Dean was totally on board with that.
Cas patted the spot next to Dean by his waist to let Jimmy know he wanted him to take his place right there and waited until he was seated, giving a pleased smile when he reached out his hand to press the vibrator against Dean’s soft cock from behind his legs so that they were out of the way and Castiel had all that glorious skin all for himself. He placed himself behind his Sub, gazing down at his muscled rear, his hips, and round ass, before starting to lightly run the end of the crop down Dean’s back, tracing the line of his spine and stopping at his sacrum, where he pressed the leather into Dean’s skin with a little more strength, a slight threat of what was to come, and continued, “All the while I’ll be working over that plump butt of yours with this crop. Remember not to come before we say so or we’ll have to punish you for that as well. Can you do that for us? Be a good boy?”
To give Dean what he longed for, Cas hooked his thumbs underneath the elastic waistband of his boxers where he could find a dark and damp spot at the front where Dean’s cock was trapped and leaking and pulled them down and off of him in one fluid motion, before spitting into his hand and jerking his cock to cover his length with it. When he met his lover’s eyes while lining up, he could see how they were twinkling with a certain anticipation and excitement at the prospect of being fucked like that, but before Cas could sink inside, he reached out to the side and grabbed the bottle of lube. He barely ever took Dean without it because he didn’t ever want to end up hurting him for the sake of pleasure, not like that.
“Yeah, that’s true,” he hummed in agreement, smiling softly. “So, did you get your medical scene?”
Sam’s eyes bugged out in surprise and he asked, “What?”
Jimmy merely smiled at that and looked back at Castiel, so he answered, “Yes, I am sure. The goal is to increase as much sensitivity and enhance every touch. And the best way to do that is to use sensory modification and sensory deprivation in conjunction with one another for an almost explosive intensity. Taking away his sight with a blindfold will therefore heighten all other senses.”
The direct stimulation seemed to be what finally began to make Dean hard again, although it didn’t bring him to full length or erection. But this scene wasn’t about getting erected four times in a row, it was about multiple orgasms, and Jimmy could work with that. So he added yet another finger before deciding to add all four, all the while he rolled his hips into Dean’s body and kept massaging and rubbing his boyfriend’s pleasure spot.
but with a Dom like Cas around. Just not so open and playful, rather shy. I dunno…”
Chuckling deeply, Benny agreed, “They’re really somethin’, huh? It was what first caught my attention… then came his charming smile. And then he lured me in with his genuine curiosity and about everything else.” There was a soft smile gracing his lips and he seemed as if deep in memory. Jimmy watched him, fascinated, and wondered if he looked something similar to that when he was thinking about Dean.
“Mhmm,” Dean hummed, his eyes tracking his finger where it was sliding along the lines of the dragonfly above the death’s-head hawkmoth. “Which one’s your favorite? The wings?”

Annoyed, Castiel said, “Merry Christmas,” and barely restrained himself from rolling his eyes at him.
He didn’t know if he’d ever felt so high with arousal, his body buzzing with the blurred lines between pleasure and pain that called him back to this; this position, this habit, this
In addition to that, Dean’s breathing was quick, way too quick, and before Jimmy knew what was happening, Cas was on his knees in front of the blonde, though not laying a hand on him. “Dean, hey,” Castiel soothed in a quiet, soft voice and Jimmy watched, confused, as Dean’s breathing got even quicker. “Remember that one call we had? Think about what I told you. Don’t focus on your breathing too much, it’s like watching a wound bleed – it hurts more when you see it.”
Because that was an obvious “Hell yes.”
Playing with Dean’s ass also turned out to be excellent foreplay; Jimmy learned very early in their relationship that it didn’t just turn him on, but helped him to relax and loosen up. Which was just awesome because, whenever they had the feeling Dean was uncomfortable, they could just step up behind him and grab a handful of ass and Dean would practically melt into the touch. Of course, they couldn’t just straight up grope Dean’s ass in an aisle of a supermarket, but there were ways to do it subtly in public – Jimmy and Cas would just place their hand on the small of Dean’s back like ‘normal’ couples do all the time and then, very slowly, let their hand drop lower to brush Dean’s butt in the most discreet way.
“There is,” Castiel stated, leaning forward a bit, “About asphyxiation, chocking and breath control… these are almost hard limits for me and therefore, I don’t like doing it. I could imagine trying it with you in the future, when time is right and we know our bodies good enough to ensure a bit of safety, but I won’t do it yet. So, we can put that on the list as a soft limit, maybe?”
With the toy nestled deep inside of their boyfriend, Cas then used hot wax on him, dripping some of it across the Sub’s already very sensitive nipples, further down his torso and into his navel to leave a trail of red wax beads. When he gently pressed Dean’s erected and stuffed penis against his belly and tipped the wax down onto his balls and thighs, Dean almost yelled and his toes curled so hard from trying to keep still while the burning sensation created pleasurable pain to course through his body, that his feet turned white. Jimmy had to tighten his nipple clamps for a fifth time then and Castiel was so aroused from doing this to his lover, that his cock steadily leaked pre-cum onto the sheets. Fortunately, Jimmy had put a liquid-proof cover on top of their mattress before Cas had made Dean crawl into it so that they didn’t have to wash everything afterward.
The only thing that this contract didn’t include was the fact that there should be extra rules when it came to Dean’s yet unknown past and depression, so Jimmy and Cas left this part incomplete until Dean was ready to tell them about it. Castiel was sure that their boyfriend didn’t even think that it was important to be mindful of that. But it was, highly so. Because it could be a trigger during a scene – something very small that they have said or done, that reminded him of what had happened, and it could take a tall on Dean, emotionally and even physically.
“And kids?” Cas piped up.
When he looked at Cas quickly, he saw the wicked smile on his face and Jimmy didn’t need to hear him say it to know he had made Dean put them on while he had been showering last night, knowing exactly how much of a goner he was for lingerie on Dean.
With a sigh, Dean leaned forward and sat up even straighter. “Believe me, I know what year it is, I had like the best night celebrating its start. I may have been knocked out for a while, but it’s not
God, if he wouldn't have been so damn happy for once in his life, he'd have been scared as Hell of how deep he was in already, how seriously involved he was with them.
At that, Jimmy scrunched his nose in disgust and nodded, and Dean assured, “Don’t worry, I don’t wanna try that stuff either. I want to be treated as a human and nothing else. And Figging, that’s the most hurtful shit I’ve ever tried. I mean, I like a certain amount of pain, but that was the nasty, unpleasant kind…”
Castiel cut Dean off before he could word the rest of his sentence and clarified, “Jimmy’s right. And you weren’t
At the sound of his ringing phone in his jean pocket, Dean was brought back to reality and he reached behind himself to pull it out of the pocket and answer the call. “Speaking of the devil,” he said, smiling despite himself.
“We’re truly not, Dean,” Cas said, taking Dean’s hand carefully into his own and guiding him into an upright position. When the blonde stood, Castiel led him to the mirror and placed themselves in front of it. Jimmy followed, placing himself at Dean’s left side. “What do you see?”
“Why?”
He couldn’t wait to spend his first night with Jimmy and Cas in their new home.
Nodding, Dean tried to keep from trembling and said, “Yes. I kinda liked the position you’ve put me in just now, Castiel.”
Laughing loudly, Benny said, “I’m just messing with you, cher! No need to hightail it.”
Castiel frowned and leaned back to look at him. “You don’t do one-night stands?”
Jimmy watched Dean leave the room and for a while, the only thing he could hear was his wildly beating heart as pictures flashed before his eyelids of his boyfriend making himself feel good with that dildo. A moment later, Dean came back into the room in all his naked glory and crawled on top of the bed again, making Jimmy take in a sharp breath at seeing him so bared, tracking Dean’s every movement with his eyes like a predator watching their prey while sliding up the bed to sit upright with his back against the headboard.
His other hand was biting a hard imprint into Dean’s thighs as he was probably hanging on for dear life behind him and for a short moment, Dean caught himself thinking that it hadn’t been such a bad idea to combine a dildo with a cockring, but then the knot in his stomach got so impossibly tight, that he had to clench his eyes shut, the cresting of his fourth orgasm hitting him harder than any other orgasm before, and he sobbed as he let it all go and finally – fucking
But Castiel tried to swallow it down and enjoy Dean’s warm body right here, pressed against his own, in his bed. They fell silent after that and Castiel listened to Dean’s breathing evening out until he was asleep. His steady breaths made Castiel follow Dean not long after and for once, he felt content.
When Dean averted his eyes to let his mind linger at the memory, Jimmy was able to admire that tiny but meaningful smile on his face. It was just a tilt of the corner of his lip but it was so sweet, he wanted to taste it. The moment was broken when Dean met his eyes again and cleared his throat. If he caught Jimmy staring, then he didn’t say anything.
Dean laughed again, louder this time, and his whole body moved with the action as his head tipped back, stretching the column of his neck gloriously. “You’re afraid of snakes?!”
much you mean to us, Dean. I love you with my whole being and just like Jimmy, having you trust me with being your Dom and taking care of you does not only satiate a deep need inside of me but gives me so much strength and warmth. Sometimes, I feel overwhelmed with your trust and love and I start to doubt if I am even worth those things, if I deserve this –
Without having noticed, Castiel’s forefinger traced the seam of Dean’s shirt collar and let the blonde’s warmth seep through the fabric and into his skin. Dean was breathing heavier now and Castiel only then realized that their faces were very close to each other. He was still gripping his thigh.
While Jimmy slid off his pants and this time the panties as well, Cas opened the drawer at the right side of the bed and retrieved a bottle of lube. Then, Dean watched, enthralled, as his boyfriends undressed themselves in front of him, throwing their clothes into a corner of the room before joining him on the bed.
When he pulled out and bent over Dean to kiss him once more, the blonde still laying in the same position, Dean brought both of their entwined hands together to pepper them with kisses. With his lips still pressed against Jimmy’s hand, Dean whispered a heartfelt, “thank you,” and closed his eyes. There was a content smile on his beautiful lips and they were slightly parted as he breathed in deeply. “For this. For everything. This massage was the best thing ever and I still feel so relaxed and fulfilled, that I think it’ll stay for a while. But I also feel even closer to you two, if that’s even possible, and it makes me giddy with love.”
“Well, I think we’re going to have to work on that then,” Castiel implied with a mischievous smirk before walking around his Sub and coming to stay behind him. Placing his hands on either of his hips once again, Castiel turned Dean to the side so that the people in the audience were also able to watch, grabbed the bottle of lube Jimmy was reaching out to him, and caressed his boyfriend’s back by running down his fingers along his spine and then up again soothingly while coating the fingers of his other hand with lube before prodding two slick digits against Dean’s hole and breaching his rim to insert them both with an obscene squelching noise.
He thought that they were through with the topic, that he finally understood what made him feel like this yesterday, and it helped to see Dean happy, just laying there with them and talking easily to them about anything that was on his mind, but maybe he was wrong. And because Dean probably thought they’d been over this as well, he lied, “Already forgot. It’s fine, anyway. I’m fine.”
His lips were dragging down Dean’s neck in wet kisses until he reached his collar bone and it distracted Dean so much, that he merely managed to nod and breathe out, “Mhmm.”
For his patience, Jimmy would be rewarded in the morning because, at the beginning of their relationship, they had decided that the person who didn’t get to have sex with Dean during a play session would do so the next morning as a nice way to start the day to make sure there was a certain balance between the sex Cas would have with Dean during scenes and the sex Jimmy would have with him. They all loved lazy morning sex underneath the sheets and wouldn’t start the day without it, and all three of them were a little insatiable when it came to intercourse in general, though only one of them got to have Dean in the morning to not overwhelm him – it was still just to start the day nicely and not to make him orgasm multiple times after all – and so they agreed that it seemed only fair to have this arrangement.
The mattress dipped next to Dean and the blonde began to chuckle when Jimmy leaned in to snuggle up to his other side and kissed the underside of his chin since his mouth was claimed by Cas.
“Do I have one?”
Jimmy nodded because that actually made a hundred percent sense to him and watched as Cas ran both ends together, down between Dean’s legs and back up to the front to form a crotch tie. After that, he reached a hand between Dean’s thighs and tenderly touched his balls and the base of his cock to make sure the rope wasn’t too tight around it, then brought the ends of the silk up under the rope at the waist, splitting the ends and taking each line around its respective hip to go underneath the respective lines forming the crotch rope at the back. He was starting to see the beginning of a diamond pattern at Dean’s back now and asked, “What got you interested in this in the first place?” because he was curious and couldn’t remember ever hearing Cas talk about it before.
“Your Color?”
Dean’s smirk only got bigger from then on and he continued, “God, and the way your fucking voices sound, so rough and low and raspy… you could read me the fucking phone book for an hour and I’d get off on that without putting a damn hand on me.”
Lifting his arms up in an angry shrug, Dean said, “What am I supposed to do, Cas?”
Then Dean started to move just slightly, rolling his hips and lifting them up to roll them back down into Cas’ crotch. While he found a slow and sensual pace, Jimmy let his hands wander down and Dean gasped when one palm wrapped around his cock, tight enough to be pleasurable but not so that it hurt. He just kept his hand there, without moving it, while Dean circled and rolled his hips, his whole body tingling with the overload of sensation. One of Castiel’s hands was gripping the meat of his shoulder as the arm was slung around his back, the other one was placed at the side of his face, fingers burying into the tips of his hair above his ear, thumb stroking his cheek, and pulling his face towards his own to start kissing Dean senseless.
He woke with a muffled groan since his face was pressed into the pillow, clenching his cheeks to probably try to stop the flow.
Jimmy was even more confused now and Cas didn’t seem to know what was about to happen either, but he had made a noise of protest at hearing he wasn’t allowed to touch Dean, which the blonde had just smirked at but otherwise ignored.
Then the topic had shifted once more to BDSM clubs in general, which was what they were currently talking about, even though Jimmy seemed to get more confused with each passing second. “So, you’re telling me that everyone in the club will be wearing a wristband and the colors vary? What do they mean?” Jimmy asked, his eyes flitting to Castiel’s.
A small smile appeared on his face and she took that as a win. “Yeah, okay.” Sam gave her a soft kiss on the lips and whispered, “thank you.”
“Wait,” Jessica interrupted the moment of quiet, pointing her finger at Benny, then Dean, “you two were a thing? Did I miss anything?”
Dropping his cell, he started walking towards the door as a few more, this time, louder knocks followed, and once he reached it, he opened the door to reveal a disheveled-looking Michael, first staring at him before his gaze shifted past Dean and into his empty apartment.
he loved this man so freaking much, his heart ached for him.
There was a small, almost shy, smile gracing Dean’s lips and Castiel grinned. Then, the blonde looked back out of the windows, saying, “I still can’t believe this is ours. It’s so freaking perfect. Just like you two.” His words made them look at Dean with intense eyes before Jimmy started kissing the long line of his neck again and Cas leaned in to press their lips together.
A day after they had come back home, Cas and Jimmy had had their viewing of the apartment and decided that they wanted this place right away before wasting time looking at other places since this one was everything they wanted. Jessica and Sam had walked in with their jaws dropped open the day they invited them to take a look at it and Castiel and Jimmy knew they had made the right decision.
“You might think it’s funny,” his voice was gruff and he turned back to start chopping the things Jimmy had washed before, which reminded Dean that he wasn’t done with his own vegetables either, so he resumed dicing them.
Well, that was until the blonde suddenly sat up straight, making Castiel look up from the book where he just finished reading the second paragraph of a page and Jimmy grunted in displeasure since his head had been resting on Dean’s chest. With an apologetic smile, Dean leaned down to run his hand through Jimmy’s hair before turning towards Cas with an almost sheepish smile, which was weird, though adorable.
For a short while, Castiel didn’t know what Dean was ready for. But then he remembered the first night they had ever spent together, cuddled up in Cas’ bed; two strangers getting to know each other. Back then, Dean had told him that he wasn’t into public scenes, whether it was because he had felt insecure and too vulnerable or just not safe enough with a partner like Michael – which was more than understandable – Castiel had no clue, but now he was ready. He felt safe enough with them to be even thinking about it.
Jessica and Sam were at him the moment the first tear fell, Sam kneeling between his legs and grabbing his shoulders to ground him and Jess at his side, rubbing his back soothingly. “Hey, Dean… shhh… what went wrong right now? Tell us. What are you thinking? Where did your head go just now?”
Dean traced the tip of his nose along the shell of Jimmy’s ear and grinned widely as the man shuddered at the touch, then withdrew from him and met Sam’s raised eyebrows, answering it with a shrug.
“I was so furious that I told him once more not to fucking try this ever again and I was about to leave when Alastair’s amusement cleared from his face and he suddenly looked mad. He gripped me by the collar of my jacket and threw me back against the wall which connected with my head painfully.” Dean chuckled again, bitterly, at the parallels and Cas’ heart broke for him. “Funny isn’t it?” Shaking his head, he went on, “Well, but the guy was a bit more aggressive and I was fucking scared when he growled at me and told me to stop playing games, saying that he knew that I wanted this and that I shouldn’t think he wouldn’t notice the way I was checking out the jocks. He called me a fool and said that I needed to be put in my right place, almost spitting the words into my face and kissing me once more to mock me. Then he left and I barely refrained from sinking to the ground as my knees got weak and wobbly.
