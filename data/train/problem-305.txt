Unsure how to respond, he stuck out his hand in a sort of half wave. The other man misinterpreted and seized his palm, shaking it with a confident and strong movement.
Blood mixed with sweat across Sherlock’s face as he sprinted a complex route across the estate. He cursed his stupidity – he had gone out without his mobile. Unfortunately, at this point he needed police assistance. The local police force knew him well, and he wasn’t held fondly in their hearts. They made a lot of fuss about ‘contaminating crime scenes’ and ‘against regulations’, and he still wasn’t forgiven when he solved all their cases for them. But he couldn’t handle this one alone.
He lets out a sigh, locks the door, and then turns to face her. “I didn’t, Mary, I needed you to know, since you clearly had forgotten. We struggle to make the rent most months, we can’t blow all our savings out here or we’ll not have a home to go back to.”
“Ice cream?” Mary offers, a kindness intended to smooth over cracks appearing in their cheerful newlywed facade.
Sherlock was suddenly aware that he was being stared at by several of Angelo’s late-night customers. It had taken him longer than usual to notice this, and that realisation disturbed him. He had been shaken by the stranger. That wasn’t supposed to happen. Not to Sherlock Holmes.
So, he’s getting what he wants. He should be pleased - if not as happy as young lovers are, then at least content and relaxed. The tempest of emotions constantly raging inside his head should be calmer, not building stronger and closer to the surface. He can’t get excited about anything Mary has planned for them out here, and regardless of his interest in the activities he churlishly wants to push against Mary’s schedule. How could the wedding have been so perfectly to his taste, and the honeymoon so far from what he wanted? Such a strict itinerary should suit him, and yet the monotony of it seems terrifying. He pushes this and all other thoughts aside. That was a dangerous train of thought.
“Not a problem, sir.” The waitress speaks in clipped tones, detectable through her thick French accent. She shakes her head. “I’ve had much worse rudeness even today, men coming in here as if they own the place, saying their little comments. You English men seem to need to learn some better manners, I think.” She tries to pass the comments off as a joke, but the laugh is false. John orders the expensive wine just to get her to shut up.
“Did you know, neither have I. What the fuck.” John exhales again. It gains the same response, breaking through Sherlock’s inflexible stance, and for once, he feels he might have the upper hand in the situation. Fuck it. “It’s my last night of freedom, tonight.” He tries drawing small circles on Sherlock’s neck with his nose. Sherlock visibly gives up pretending to be a statue, relaxing into John’s touch and spurring him on. He explores the expanse of neck with his face, his lips occasionally brushing the delicate skin. Not quite far enough to cross a line. Not yet.
“Mates’ rates?” The blonde was leaning on the counter, sipping his drink and watching Sherlock wipe his face with a towel.
When he had first met Mary, John was haunted by the shadow of Sherlock - of all he had lost, and of all he could’ve had. He wasn’t such an idiot to have not realised the chance he had missed because of all he hadn’t said. He had been interested in Sherlock right from the start - attracted, even - and that feeling had only grown as they slipped into a platonic domesticity at Baker Street. He’d yearned for more. But he had never had any sign of the feeling shared beyond fierce friendship from a man who rarely let people know him. The ghost of all he should’ve said had loomed large over him for dark months, his brain filled with “what if”s that he could never get the answers to. Mary had drawn him out of his shell; she never gave up on him, though he was in an awful state. She brought a spark of the flame of Sherlock back into his life. They would go on little adventures together: driving too fast down the motorway, walking home late at night instead of taking a cab, surprise trips away with the loosest of plans, living off their wits. She feels wild and unpredictable, and yet reliable and secure in way Sherlock never was. And she was a woman who wanted to settle and start a life together. Properly, together. She was beautiful, smart, witty, and understanding. This should be what John wants. Like Sherlock, but with a stronger understanding of her own emotions, and a clearer care and commitment to John. And there’s that added bonus, that she didn’t fake her own death and make John believe she was dead for two years. He can trust Mary. There are no secrets between them.
there? My international reputation is not so adored that an underfunded French police force would pay out of pocket for my detective services.”
“Um, Sherlock… you were the one who demanded I move out the minute I started talking about my feelings. There is no “her”. There’s just you, who I most definitely have not had enough of. Are you ok?” John’s sympathetic eyes rested on Sherlock’s face, which was twisting in confusion.
Sherlock did seem intrigued by the case, sitting up in his chair as Lestrade read him the particulars. He remained inside of himself, not even looking at the other man as he spoke, but Lestrade could see his brain start moving again, like a rusty car engine being revved into action.
But no, it wasn't John, it was this man with his John’s voice. And that was exactly what John would’ve said, some stupid joke. Not worth wasting the oxygen on it, and he would’ve said so, if Angelo hadn’t come back at that moment with towels and a mug of coffee.
He couldn’t deny his affection for the other man at this moment, though. As Sherlock dozed off, and the magical Christmas lights that decorated Regent Street danced across his pale face, he was so soft. He felt himself drawn to Sherlock despite the resting state of his mind - he saw the texture of his skin, the gentle waves of his hair, his elegant yet relaxed frame. This should be uncomfortably close to another man… but it wasn’t. In truth, he only wanted to be as close as possible to the man whose fragility was, in this moment, so apparent.
Lestrade can’t help it. He really tries, but he can’t contain the eruption of laughter that’s building inside him. Mycroft looks initially annoyed, but a moment later has joined him in the first actual, natural laugh Lestrade has ever seen from him. It makes him look younger, softer, more human. It’s a good look on him.
John Watson’s eyes have always been a fascination of Sherlock’s. They would see with such medical skill and steadfast kindness. They would haunt his dreams in the two years he was away from them. They looked at him as if he was worth something. As he meets them now, he makes a decision. Morals are for idiots.
“Was it something I said?” He was only half joking. Sherlock just looked at the shorter man. “Please… take something to wipe up the blood with, at least.” He dug out a not-quite-clean tissue from his pocket and held it out. Reluctantly, Sherlock took it, holding it to his face.
Lestrade gave her a weak smile. “Yes, a big one, out in Europe. Bit of time away from this place, bit of fresh air and sun, and a distracting case. Murders, several. He’ll love it.”
“Yeah, Carlson Murphy’s body was found at Le Negresco Hotel, it’s some fancy place along the promenade.”
Eyes straining in the dim light of New Scotland Yard’s very outdated office building, Lestrade tidied the papers on his desk, picking out the file for the case he’d told Lestrade he’d show to Sherlock this evening, the case out in Nice, France. He had been a little worried that Mycroft might object to sending Sherlock away from London at this difficult time, but Lestrade seemed to think it would do him good, and thinking about it, Baker Street may not be the best place for Sherlock to stay right now, living alone where he once lived with a companion. Lestrade knew that feeling. The emptiness he still feels in his own home is pronounced and painful, despite his wife having left a couple of years ago now. If there’s any way he can help Sherlock feel any better than he did when his wife left him, he will do whatever he can.
This marriage should be bringing him peace; after all, that’s why he’s entered into it in the first place. A routine to support him, stability to keep him feeling in control. The military drilled a lifestyle of strict conformity into him, and so the suburban life he’ll build with Mary, that will give him the regimented and predictable lifestyle which will keep him steady. The rollercoaster life is not for him, he’s had his fill.
“Both of them, in the same small French city, eating salad Niçoise feet away from eachother as we speak. Oh god, what the hell have I done…”
. I’m sure you will bare the loss with due dignity.” Sherlock flounced into his bedroom, slamming the door.
Sherlock stopped. Not only his physical motions, but his brain ground to a halt to. He could deduce someone’s height from a footprint, he could tell breeds of dog apart from their hairs, but this. This, his brain couldn’t process.
is that supposed to mean? Why do I know that, what the bloody hell, what the fuck do you mean by that?”
“Landed just before 5 o’clock, local time. Thoroughly engaged in the case, you couldn’t drag him away, I’m sure. We’ll just have to keep a remote eye on them. My best agents are on it, I assure you.”
John scowls. “I can apologise for myself, thank you. I’m sorry if I offended you, I just don’t believe… I don’t think we’re in the position to be spending this much money on wines.” Mary turns beetroot red. John has, clearly, upset her by saying this, and he tries very hard to care.
This chapter is dedicated to Fellshish, who I’m sure knows where I got the inspiration from for this chapter - although I would never be such a scrooge!!
As long as Sherlock could remember, John had been there too. He thought he must’ve picked up the name from conversation around him in early life, and attached it to a face and personality. John never had an appearance in solid form to Sherlock, but they would converse in his head and he was such a comfort to his young self. When he was ruthlessly bullied at school, John reminded him that the bullies were so thick they would be lucky to get a job at all, whereas Sherlock had his pick of any ambition. When he was moved to a new school and universally ignored by everyone, John had gossiped about the other pupils with him and laughed at his jokes. In short, Sherlock didn’t mind being isolated even from his own family if John was in his head.
Shhherlock, I can fix a hiccups, it’sh fine!” With no warning and alarming dexterity for someone in his state, he seizes Sherlock by the arm and yanks him to the floor next to him. Sherlock tries to land with grace but misjudges and ends up a heap of tangled limbs next to a hysterical John.
“Yeah, just case stuff. You know Sherlock, probably forgot we were out here, didn’t realise he wasn’t supposed to. Still…” he couldn’t help but say it. “It was nice to talk to him again. Like the old days.”
This man, this boy… looking at him, he was between the two words. His dirty blonde hair cut in a boyish style, but with light fuzz around his chin. Sherlock observed him in profile, and as his mind booted up again he started to take him in with his usual detail. Short, but well built, strong. Medical student. About 20. Lives with his parents. They aren’t well off. He’s come straight from a date with a girl he didn’t have much interest in. It went badly.
I wrote this chapter on the coach home, and I would like to ironically dedicate it to the child who stared at me the whole time I was typing this, as if he'd never seen a laptop before. Mind your own business, kid.
“Jesus Christ Mary, we could afford to have the whole flat back home redecorated for that sort of money!” He explodes, without thinking. Several heads turn in his direction, and the waitress frowns.
Mary has never quite understood this. She enjoys pretending to be very wealthy for a couple of hours, John guesses. She will, no doubt, take a photo of them both there for the benefit of her friends on social media. He does his best to indulge this need to show off their life together, although it makes him feel more of a fraud than anything - the couple she posts about on Facebook aren’t real. Those people are not Mary and John, imperfect but trying their damned hardest. It does them a disservice not to include how much hard work they put into maintaining their relationship.
" yes John I know that. You say it every time I bring up the subject. Can we just talk about this without you treating me like a wounded animal."
Victor stared up, no expression of any emotion visible on his face. The room was silent for what felt like an eternity. “so he found her…?”
“Victor and I lived in the same household until he graduated from university. He then moved out of town for work and the abuse stopped and our relationship began to mend itself. I saw a therapist for years, sometimes I still do, I never told him specific details of why I wanted to have sessions with him, it helped me forgive him and myself. I’ve always wanted the best for my brother, despite it all, I love him. A few weeks ago, I decided I wanted to file the charges for abuse against him and wanted him to seek help. I decided to speak with him before I went to the police to give himself the chance to make the changes on his own, but he became furious when I brought up the subject and stormed out of my house. I chased after him, but he got in his car and left, at least I thought he did. I had my dog with me, and we were walking in the grass near my flat and someone came up behind me, cut my dogs leash with a knife and then held it to my throat. It was Victor and he told me if I didn’t come with him, he’d kill me…and Sherlock.”
John chuckled fondly and brought Sherlock down into a deep kiss. When Sherlock leaned down to meet John it lifted his hips to a perfect angle and the shorter man took advantage of the opportunity. He reached between them and grabbed the base of his cock and guided it into Sherlock’s tight entrance. The detective gasped, “oh” and John smiled against his lips.
"Send them in." He said with a long sigh. Today had seemed to last forever and his tiredness was catching up to him. The person walked into his office. John was looking down writing, " please have a seat." The person didn't have a seat though they walked over behind his desk and pecked his cheek, he looked up in shock before noticing the person was Sherlock.
John became soft inside his lover and his cock slipped out, causing Sherlock to whine at the empty feeling. John’s come slowly dripped from Sherlock and fell into his neatly trimmed bed of soft blonde pubic hair and pelvic bone. Sherlock was still laying on top of John, his own ejaculate pressed between their bodies.
After their short sightseeing they went to a quaint little place less than a half mile from the tower. It was nice but not over the top. John’s behavior grew increasingly more chivalrous and Sherlock grew increasingly nervous. He knew this was probably a build up to what he offered to happen later tonight…he wanted it still, god knows he wanted it, but a quick fuck this morning would have spared him the traffic of emotions.
A few members of NSY gave statements about evidence found prior to Sherlock’s help and then it was time for the detective himself to take the stand. As Sherlock rose to his feet he secured the middle button of his suit jacket and took a deep breath. He was confident about his information; he had no reason not to be. This would be the easy part of the trial, discussing his findings in front of people was something he took pride in. Perhaps it was because it helped him exude a confidence he didn’t have in his personal life, or maybe it was the ego boost it gave him when people were amazed by his discoveries. He took a sip of water and John looked towards the ceiling with a pleading look, to whatever god may be listening, that Sherlock wouldn’t act like a complete cock.

John ran his hand soothingly up and down the stretch of Sherlock’s back, trying to ignore the raised scars from the detective’s time in Siberia and some of which he knew had been caused by victor. “baby…” he breathed, and Sherlock cuddled in closer. They sat there comfortable in post orgasmic bliss until John could feel the come between them starting to dry. He had come to adore how pliant and sated Sherlock seemed to be after a particularly good sex session and hated to disrupt the man whose mind never seemed calm. “ let’s continue this in the shower, okay?” he whispered, feeling dark curls nod against his shoulder.
He did. It was unconventional of John, a level or force he had never used with Sherlock since finding out about the abuse, but it was a reality check. “ I can’t stop thinking.” He sighed and started to pack away the papers.
“Emily!..Emily Trevor!” He yelled at the top of his lungs as he walked through the dark tunnels. His phone battery was beginning to drain from how often he had been checking the time, by now sun would be setting over Paris. He called out several more times before he heard something crinkle, it was a noise similar to the sound an empty water bottle makes when you crush it in your hands. Sherlock followed the direction the sound came from. It wasn’t long until his flashlight caught the color of a light pink blouse. The figure blocked the light with her hands. “Emily” Sherlock said barely above his breath. Her body looked frail and thin, her clothes and hair disheveled, and she was shaking almost violently.
The conversation landed in all the right ways, a small grin crept across Sherlock’s face and he raised the instrument to his shoulder and began to play, admiring John as he shuffled about the kitchen. How did he ever live without John? He didn’t, he just existed.
They were both sweating and out of breath, both engulfed in a different type of euphoria. It reminded John of when they had first met and chased the cab throughout London before outrunning the police and were left happily out of breath and laughing against the downstairs of 221b. Sherlock was on a high from his orgasm and John was high on the feeling of giving it to his lover.

"Couldn't sleep and was restless, didn't want to wake you. If I didn't wake you, why are you awake?"
Sherlock rarely found himself mesmerized but lately It happened more often, and John was always the reason why. Sherlock loved admiring John but didn’t always get the chance to let his eyes linger as much as he would have liked when they were caught in the heat of the moment. But now there was nothing keeping him from admiring his lover. Even being out of army for several years, John kept the frame of a soldier. Sure, some of the once sinfully defined muscles had faded over time but his body was toned and magnificently sculpted. Sherlock often found himself admiring how broad John’s shoulders were compared to his own and always took advantage of running his hands over John’s torso when they were cuddling.
Sherlock couldn’t make himself meet John’s gaze, not with his eyes glassed over like they were. John pulled Sherlock back into his lap and kissed him passionately. They continued to make out in one another’s embrace until they were beginning to be out of breath. Sherlock took his phone from his dressing gown pocket and sent Emily a text.
“Sherlock…you don’t have to tell me anything. I shouldn’t have said what I did. But I am eternally sorry for what my brother did to you. I’m sure it has left you with a lot to heal from. Does that matter to you? Your virginity I mean?” she approached the question delicately and avoided eye contact with the tall man.
A Parisian officer came into the room while Sherlock was watching the steadily drip of the IV line. He asked Sherlock for the details of how and why he knew Emily was down there and that he wanted to collect any and all evidence that was found. He explained that the case originated in London and gave the officer all the details, surprisingly without berating the man. Sherlock informed him that Scotland Yard had already claimed the case and that DI Lestrade was actually in the city undercover with the suspect. He gave the officer the address of Greg and Victor’s hotel and a team was sent over immediately.
“yes. And lucky for you and her both, she’s alive and will make a full recovery. And you won’t be charged with murder.” Greg stated. “ I’d hoped you were better than this. You’re being transported back to London tonight and your trial is in a week, so I suggest you call a good lawyer…and quick.”
Mrs. Hudson went back downstairs, and john turned to Sherlock, seemingly snapping him out of a small trance. “Sherlock, I need to change your bandages. Let’s do that now please before I forget.” Sherlock nodded and john prepared some gauze and antiseptic as Sherlock took a seat at their little kitchen table littered with beakers and pipets. John sat down with his materials and unwrapped the bandage from the previous evening. John looked at sherlocks arm with sad eyes, so much pain and suppressed emotion hidden beneath those cuts and piercingly white scars. “they are looking better everyday love; they really are healing nicely. you should be able to stop wearing the bandage at the end of next week probably.” John said affirmatively and Sherlock gave him a small smile, “ I’ve had a great doctor watching over me.” John leaned in and gave him a small kiss smiling as he pulled away.
“Of course, I was right. Only the samples from the sidewalk and the mud off of Victor’s shoe had the same type of DNA. None of it was found on Emily’s shoes. Not only had Victor been to this place before he went to Emily’s the night she disappeared, but he had also been back to the same location afterwards and had not cleaned his shoes before coming here. None of the sediment or guano matches with types from around here so he has most likely taken her a good amount of distance away. Perhaps even another country,” Sherlock spoke clearly and efficiently as he laid the details out for Lestrade. “I need you to find out where he has been recently.”
Greg and Victor lay pressed against one another, basking in the afterglow of their second fuck of the night when a hard knock rapt on the door. They both quickly put some boxers on and Lestrade opened the entrance to the room. Officers came in and detained them both, but quickly releasing Lestrade after showing his ID and badge. Victor rambled for words and tried to fight the officers to no avail. Lestrade watched with tears brimming his eyes as Victor was taken away. It was for the best.
John realized what he menu and nodded his head in understanding. "Why didn't you tell me, you knew I was worried anyway."
He joined his boyfriend under the hot water and let his hands run along the length of Sherlock’s torso. “ I want to give you something.” John said seductively as he moved closer to Sherlock’s neck before sucking a dark redish purple hickey at the very base near his collar bone. “that’s to remind Victor who you belong to.”
“ it’s fine. He’s undoubtably the best man I’ve ever met. He was a soldier, an army doctor-but when he got injured, he came back to London. He was looking for a place to live and I had a vacancy. I fell in love with him the first night we were out on a case together. He is unbelievably kind and understanding towards everyone, but especially to me- I don’t know how he puts up with me. We didn’t get together until a few months ago, but without a doubt he is the best thing to ever happen to me.” The fondness in his voice was almost tangible.
Hello darlings! I hope you all are enjoying this story! I love writing it, please comment and let me know what you think about it! Comments are like crack to me!
“stop telling me what I should do and trying to decide what I can and cannot handle, It’s not for you to decide.” Sherlock stated with a glare in John’s direction.

Sherlock rolled his eyes, " are you kidding me?" Ms.Hudson looked confused, "mrs, Turners married ones are screaming sexual phrases at the top of their bloody lungs and you get onto us for having a laugh about it?"
"Sherlock, words can't tell you how much I wish that never happened to you. Never ever think about going back to him, no matter what. Even if we are fighting or I'm dead or gone on a trip, whatever happens come to me, sit at my grave, have Mycroft fly you half way around the world at your doctors orders, just come to me. Believe me sherlock when I say it makes me sick to even talk about him."
“Eeeh, no.” John made a T sign with his hands. “No one wants to talk about work, ever, especially on a saturday at a bar. Try again.”
John screamed. He held the air, wondering which subatomic particle was Sherlock. He didn’t care. He kissed his hands, and suddenly he felt something materializing in front of him, something solid. He kept his eyes closed, and kept kissing. Then Sherlock’s weight was on him, and his arms around him, and tears flowed down John’s cheek.
The tall boy was hunched over, stiff as a board and clutching his elbows tightly. His eyes were glaring at something on the ground, once again the picture of stoicism if not for the deep flush darkening his features.
They stared at each other for a few seconds. “I- I got…,” Molly stood up, suddenly, and crossed her arms over her chest. “We- I- Cou- J-john... whatdoyouliketodoforfun?”
“No,” Sherlock gasped and finally breathed after thirty long seconds. He sucked air into his mouth, held it, then blew it out shakily. His pulse was racing and he crossed his legs tightly in order to hide the now, very noticeable bulge in his trousers. Deep in the pit of his stomach a fire had been stoked and any sudden stimulation would turn it into a crazy hellish inferno that would set his whole body ablaze.
Everyone around them started clapping. It was like the scene at the very end of the Titanic. John realized that this was a dream and Sherlock really was dead, and that if he opened his eyes he’d wake up. He kept his eyes shut, kissing Sherlock and crying, despair growing so deep in his chest it was almost choking him-
However, to any not-quite-common passerby, they would have seen a man two seconds away from blowing up in a torrent of aggravation and frustration.
John. The John he had been fantasizing about since he first heard him give his thesis on the reflection of the diaspora
“I don’t know,” Molly said again, this time slower and more patronizingly. “I didn’t realize I had to fall in love with every guy you threw at me from your clinic.”
In actuality, John left his credit card on the coffee table after ordering takeout, and had no way of doing the groceries and getting home. He was just about ready to die of boredom.
He broke off when he saw John, pale as a fish belly, standing in a slightly wrinkled, but still pristine suit.
“Hey, Sherlock! Sorry I’m late. Rugby took a little longer than I expected,” John jogged down the hall, books in tow, glistening with sweat. “Were you waiting long?” A light flush painted his body, and his muscles were still strained and corded from having been running and jumping and tackling other men just five minutes ago.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. “John, I hate surprises. I’ll let it slide this time though.” Then he looked down at his bouncing knees and did something funny with his face.
He noted John’s eyes were dark and slightly unfocused, no doubt from all the expended energy, and how his nostrils were flaring. His orbicularis oris was a bit contracted signifying a bit of tension, yet his right procerus was neutral-
“That’s a serious question, Molly,” John said, sliding along the table. “You’re a beautiful woman. You can get any guy you want. Who is straight or not married or a priest or something. You just have to figure out what kind of guy you want.”
He lay naked on his sheets, sopping wet, feeling very much like a worm that had gotten lost on a summer sidewalk. The phone now said 3:16. Two hours and 34 minutes until Sherlock arrived.
He waved his hand. “You just have to be a little more light on your feet. It was fine. Sherlock? How’s it coming?”
He sat up. He still had some of the residual panic from the dream. A world without Sherlock, where he’d never see Sherlock again. Never hear Sherlock pounding up the stairs or screaming at him to turn the television down, or drag him out on a midnight stake out.
John arrived to an empty and dark flat. The winter sky had clogged the sun with clouds, and had laced the walls with shadows.
Some time after he ordered the food, John realized what a blessing it was to be in 2017. People would deliver things directly to your bedroom door. All it took were the dozen or so numbers on his credit card, Granted, he would probably have to cancel that same credit card in the morning, because he had no idea about half the stores he used it on.
Little by little the tension was released and he was left panting and damp and more than a little embarrassed in the seat.
Suddenly everything came rushing back to him. Sherlock had seemingly said “ok” out of nowhere, but it wasn’t out of nowhere. It was about that fictional date John had proposed to Mol-lock.
“Take what?” John asked. “We’re literally sitting in an empty lab by ourselves. It isn’t real, Molly.”
“And? You go on dates all the time, don’t you? Aren’t you always and constantly eating at that awful Italian restaurant on Seaport?” asked Sheila.
“Wait, Sherlock, wait!” he suddenly gasped and flipped them over so that Sherlock was lying on his back and staring up at John.
That wasn’t really fair. Sherlock was dressed in his usual bespoke dark blue outfit, but John was trying to make a point.
John’s tongue swirled around the shell of Sherlock’s ear right before gently stroking his cock through his trousers.
But the world swirled around his brain. Date, date, date, date. What could Sherlock be talking about? Did they have another case where they would have to pretend to be dates? Did they have an appointment? Did he have an actual date to attend to?
“Moving on,” John said decisively, before the awkwardness set in and consigned him to thirty minutes of pure silence. “What’s your name?”
And John is leaning his head against Sherlock’s shoulder, because he’s dizzy from the wine. He puts a hand on Sherlock’s thigh. John squeezes his eyes tighter.
The fire in Sherlock’s belly was suddenly changed into a very short, very taut rubber band that was two seconds away from snapping and dropping Sherlock into molten lava filled swirl of ecstasy and breathlessness. It was a coil that was going to spring up at any moment send gears and cogs flying everywhere.
Sherlock raised his hand, dubious, and stopped before it made contact. “John, are you-...you’re not mocking me, are you?”
He was a modern man. He could say he loved his friends. He could talk about his feelings. He could think Sherlock was handsome. He wasn't confined by a constructed prison of masculinity. He could have dreams about Sherlock. The brain was a wild organ. He could feel utterly fulfilled when with Sherlock. He could feel empty inside when going on dates with other women. That’s just the nature of 21st century urban isolation, baby.
At that Molly’s face fell even harder and she made a sharp turn in her chair back to the table and started writing in a folder.
“I know. Wish I could,” John took a deep breath, pushing back a roll of weakness. Standing was doing him no favors. “Say the same...for you.”
Their breathing got louder and shorter and their movements got more frantic until finally, John gave on final tug that sent him spilling onto Sherlock’s flat stomach with the other boy following not soon after.
say it like that,” he said. He fumbled into his coat pockets. “I’ve got to call Sherlock. I’ve got to end this before it gets out of hand.”
“No, wait! Where are you from? London originally? I’m from Salisbury!” Molly had started yelling for some reason, her hand clutched against her chest.
What case, John had no idea, because Sherlock hadn’t had a case for the past two weeks. Maybe Sherlock thought he was so stupid that if Sherlock said the word ‘case’ with enough urgency, it would appeal to John’s sense of duty and he would do whatever Sherlock said.
John decided to have mercy on him, and take them to a comfortable place where Sherlock wouldn’t have to rely on plans. He unwrapped the blanket, and umbrella’d it around Sherlock’s waist.
At that she rolled her eyes. “John, please. It’s not the 1950s anymore. You don’t have to be straight on Mondays and gay on Saturday. Let’s be modern. The term is bisexual.”
Twelve minutes. He had been waiting for twelve minutes, a record previously unheard of for the man who had tripped someone down the escalator because they had refused to move.
“He slides into the cabs, and you follow, your knees almost touching. Sherlock’s hands are on the seat and your hands are folded neatly in your lap. You feel no pressure to do anything but wait to get to the restaurant.”
“Sherlock, wait!” John said, but Sherlock put a hand on his cheek, kissed him one last time and turned away.
“John,” Sherlock sighed while trying to infuse it with warning. His hand spread over John’s and lightly as the rugby player continued to rub small circles. John pressed a small kiss right on his pulse and the coil sprung open.
“You pop a pasty in the microwave and it comes out hot and fluffy. You take a bite and it fills you right up.”
He lightly teased the head, wetting his fingers with the pre-cum before moving down to work the shaft. John buried his face in the crook Sherlock’s neck, biting and licking and moaning his pleasure.
“No! Not what you think you have to do, but what you really, really, in your heart of hearts want to do?”
John snorted himself awake. His face was wet from drools, sweat, and...tears? He had been crying in his sleep for some reason he couldn’t really remember. All he knew is that he was super relieved that he was awake and that he lived in a world where Sherlock was alive.
“I was honestly hoping to get to know you a little better before…jumping your bones. I don’t know what came over me and I apologize, but…would you like to have dinner sometime? I understand if you meant for this to be a onetime thing, or-or if you wanted it to just be physical but I really want-”
John leaned his elbows against the table. He’d been in Bart’s for the past hour, waiting for Sherlock to finish ‘one quick thing.’ Every time he threatened to leave and continue on with his day, Sherlock would hop off the stool saying, “John I’m almost done, I promise. This is vital to the case!”
“Being straight doesn’t mean forcing yourself to do or not do things. Live your life for yourself, not some dictionary definition.”
Laying there, battered by illness and pain, John could quite sharply see his feelings for Sherlock. They had outgrown the heterosexual friendship category years ago. He had watched them expand, yet never bothered to let them out of their tiny little cage.
Ok, so hypothetically speaking what if he was bisexual? What did that mean? What did that have to mean?
“It’s not funny, John,” Sherlock said softly. “You don’t know how long I-...I never thought this would happen. I was terrified that I’d have to spend the rest of my life watching you, and wanting. Knowing you’d never see me the way I saw you. It hurt.”
It didn’t mean he was automatically promised to Sherlock, right? He could go out with anyone he wanted. That’s what Sheila had said. He could marry Idris Elba if he wanted to.
They both turned to Sherlock, who had left the fluorescent microscope and was at the centrifuge. He didn’t answer.
Legs, set to bolt down the hall and personally drag the offending person who put him in such a state in the first place from whatever hackneyed affair he might be participating in and throw him, arse over head into the room.
John froze, and shut the door before he could respond. “Right! Well I have errands, too! I’ll see you later!” He stopped only to shove on his sneakers and his coat, before flying out the door.
already. John was tired of having to undress Sherlock with his eyes and not his hands, and waking up with pants damp and the faint memory of Sherlock’s taste on his tongue. It was time for action, John Watson style.
Sherlock was taken out of his thoughts when John placed a hand on his shoulder, “move forward.” For once the detective did what he was told, and John sat down behind him. “lay back.” John said opening his arms. Sherlock moved himself between John’s legs and leaned back, his head coming to rest on John’s collarbone. The taller man sighed contently and let his eyes fall shut again.
Hurt came over Johns face and he look down at the table. " I'll go then. I'm sorry I'm such an inconvenience."
Sherlock wrote down a few more comments on his spread sheet before packing up his things and walking with John out of the lab. John ordered takeout on the cab ride home, assuming they would arrive to 221b around the same time the delivery boy did. “Sherlock, are you alright?” John asked and gave his hand a gentle squeeze. Sherlock nodded but it wasn’t good enough for John. “No. Really, I want to know how you are feeling. What happened when I left the room? I’m so sorry I had to leave, it felt like I didn’t have much of a choice without making it obvious I didn’t want the two of you left alone.” John continued rambling and Sherlock listened as best as he could in his dazed state. “why did the two of you pretend like you didn’t know one another? I mean I didn’t expect you all to start hashing out your history in Lestrade’s office but acting as if you’d never met the person you were in a so-called relationship for so many years, I mean- “
The doctor felt himself go cold before warming with accomplishment and pride, “ let’s go eat then. Angelo’s?”
Sherlock’s lips quirked up, but he kept his head low, staring at the floor until he was taken by surprise when Emily scooted closer to him, laying her head on his shoulder and wrapping her arms around his. Sherlock flinched at the touch and their eyes met.
Sherlock flopped dramatically onto the sofa and pulled at his curls, ". If it's going to be like this, I dread what we will be like during the trial, not to mention once it's over. We probably will have broken up by then and you'll be back to some woman. You'll probably bring her by here to shag and sneak her out by morning, the same way you did before me. I bet you never coddled any of them the way you do me."
“do you need medical attention, there was an explosion down here a few hours ago.” He explained in a very professional manner.
Meanwhile Victor had been sitting in a Parisian jail cell for nearly two days. The Parisian officers were only responsible for making sure he was kept alive and didn’t escape, but it was Lestrade who had to conduct the investigation and decide the next move to be made; and the truth was Lestrade couldn’t face him yet…not until today.
"Promise me a few other things to yeah?" John looked at him while eating some yogurt Sherlock made a sound of agreement and John proceeded, " okay number one, don't do anything that would hurt you. Number 2 eat something this morning, doesn't have to be much, just something and keep it down. Number 3 if you need help doing something please ask ms.Hudson. Number 4 text me at lunch to let me know your alright."
“No,” Sherlock denied firmly. John sensed that he was entering dangerous and forbidden territory. He should stop this conversation or else Sherlock will get angry with him.
“You and your brother sure do have a weird relationship, Sherlock,” John said as he watches Sherlock work.
Following the DI’s directions, John quickly found himself on the main street. As he walked, the phones from the telephone booths kept ringing as he passed. He stopped and looked curiously at the phone and noticed that the ringing stopped when another person tries to answer it.
“Ah, no!” Sherlock shouted in frustration. He then ran in another direction. However, John took a wrong turn
John thought in amazement and disbelief. Sherlock opened his eyes and looked at John. His eyes were filled with surprise. He looked down and saw the symbol on John’s right wrist and turned to look at his left wrist. They were quiet as they tried to wrap their minds around it. Sherlock let go of his hand and took his left one gently. He pushed the jumper sleeve up and they both saw that John’s previous black soul mark was now a lovely gold color. He didn’t think his soul mark could ever be this fascinating. The gold color seemed to be alive as the angle changes. The feelings he felt towards Sherlock made sense now. The longing to touch him, the fear of losing him, the fascination towards the man’s quirks- everything made sense now. He already knew that deep down Sherlock was
“You tell me,” the man answered as he pocketed the notebook. John wordlessly turned around and started walking away. “I imagine people have already warned you to stay away from him, but I can see from your left hand that's not going to happen,” the man continued. John stopped and his curiosity got the best of him. He turned back around to face the posh bastard.
“Use mine,” Sherlock answered simply. Sherlock grudgingly let go of John’s hand again so that they can prepare for bed. As they were changing, John noticed the golden mark on Sherlock’s right shoulder. It consisted of many lines and rectangles. It didn’t seem to resemble anything.
They got back to their flat at around midnight. Sherlock reluctantly let go of John’s hand in order to remove their coats. After which he immediately grab John’s hand and held it tightly before walking into Sherlock’s room.
As they were walking towards Bart’s, John couldn’t help but wonder if Mike found his soul mate. Asking about one’s soul mate is only asked among close friends and family members. However, that rule has always been loose since most people are open and proud of their bonds. They are willing to share certain information about their bond mate. John was contemplating whether or not to ask about Mike’s soul mate when said man started talking.
“Back of the right leg: tiny splash marks on the heel and calf, not present on the left. She was dragging a wheeled suitcase behind her with her right hand. Don't get that splash pattern any other way. Smallish case, going by the spread. Case that size, woman this clothes-conscious - could only be an overnight bag, so we know she was staying one night” Sherlock finally answered as he gestured to the body before kneeling down to examine it again. “Now, where is it? What have you done with it?”
“Yes, thank you for your input,” Sherlock cut him off as he slammed the door to the man’s face, not once looking up from his phone.
“Mrs. Hudson, isn't it time for your evening soother?” Sherlock responded sarcastically as he stood up. Without thinking, John sat down on the seat Sherlock vacated.
“Prepare to fight,” Mycroft warned as he handed Sherlock a gun. Sherlock nodded and looked out the window.  He saw cars boxing them in. He frowned.
“What was this you told me earlier, Sherlock? Something about you being able to take care of yourself?” Mycroft asked rhetorically and with a lot of superiority in his voice.
“That's enough to be going on with, don't you think?” the man continued. “The name’s Sherlock Holmes and the address is 221B Baker Street,” the man smiled and winked at John. John felt his heart jump at the action.
“Show me,” the man ordered instead. John’s eyebrows furrowed in annoyance as he walked up to the man and raised his left hand. The man went to take John’s hand in his.
“Afghanistan or Iraq?” the man asked while still typing on John’s phone. John’s eyes were widening in surprise.
“Oh, we're done waiting!” Sherlock said, passionately. “Look at her, really look! Houston, we have a mistake. Get on to Cardiff: find out who Jennifer Wilson's family and friends were. Find Rachel!” Sherlock started walking speedily out the door.
“I'm pretty sure you could search this flat all day, you wouldn't find anything you could call recreational,” John said to Lestrade.
“Yes, that’s it. I rather dislike taking Mycroft’s cases. They are tedious and boring, really. However, if I need something from him, he will require something in return,”
“Sherlock and I better get going. We can give our statements tomorrow, Lestrade. It was nice meeting you again, Mr. Holmes.” John said. Lestrade smiled knowingly and said, “I’m sure you’re both tired. I’ll stop by tomorrow and, John, you can call me Greg.” John smiled and nodded.
, John thought in awe. The dim light casting shadows on the detective’s face and highlighting his gorgeous features. John inwardly shakes off the thought.
“Then what is it?” Lestrade asked the detective. John moved towards the pink case before Sherlock told him to. Sherlock called out his name as he opened his laptop. Before Sherlock could say anything else, John responded with, “jennie.pink@mephone.org.uk.”
“Suitcase! Did anyone find a suitcase? Was there a suitcase in this house?” Sherlock jumped up and yelled.
“It’s an old friend of mine, John Watson,” Mike introduced. The man carefully took the phone without touching John. John felt a bit disappointed that he wasn’t able to touch the beautiful man.
Sherlock thought loudly. John sighed in defeat and looked at Sherlock. Stormy blue eyes stared back at him.  He completely opened his mind and showed Sherlock the memory.
“She didn't think about her daughter. She scratched her name on the floor with her fingernails. She was dying. It took effort. It would have hurt,” Sherlock explained heatedly.
“Stamford. Mike Stamford. We were at Bart’s together,” The man said patiently. John’s face lit up with recognition. How could he forget? Mike used to be a good friend of his back in the day.
“It suits you,” John said simply. Sherlock smiled and John felt Sherlock’s happiness through the bond.
“Oh, use your imagination!” the detective responded. John rolled his eyes good-naturedly at the eccentric man.
“Well, maybe it was in the case when you brought it back and it fell out somewhere,” Lestrade supplied. Sherlock raised an incredulous eyebrow at that.
“Ah, yes. The bravery of the soldier. Bravery is by far the kindest word for stupidity, don't you think?” the man asked rhetorically. “What is your connection to Sherlock Holmes?”
“Then who said anything about flatmates?” John asked with a frown. The man stood up and was tying his scarf around his neck.
Sherlock finally sent to John. Satisfied that Sherlock finally told him what he wanted, John placed both of their orders. John turned to Sherlock and asked, “How did you do that?”
Sherlock nodded a bit red from John’s word.  John smiled and kissed Sherlock on the forehead before returning to his breakfast.
“Mike, can I borrow your phone? There’s no signal on mine,” the beautiful man said, not looking up from the microscope.
, John thought. Sherlock’s frown deepened. Suddenly, the feelings of loneliness and self-disgust, so similar to his own before he met John, were crossing over from his soul mate. The memory of wanting to give up and die and the memory of holding a gun to the head were sent to Sherlock’s mind. Sherlock gasped in horror and tightened his arms around John in fear as a few tears escaped his eyes.
“Okay, that was ridiculous. That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done,” John panted as he smiled.
“Something wrong, Sherlock?” his brother asked with a smirk on his place. Sherlock ignored him and continued to text. The person he was texting, however, proved to be boring and an idiot. A case about a lost dog? He’s got to be joking.
“It's a drugs bust,” Lestrade responded a little too cheerfully. John’s head snapped up at that remark.
“He is on his way,” Mycroft replied. “So, John, I hope my brother hasn’t done anything to upset you yet?”
“Oh no, I ensured it,” Sherlock answered with a secretive smirk. John felt even more confused. Before he could ask any further, the door opened to reveal a gentle and kind-looking old lady. Her eyes lit up when she saw Sherlock.
“Jennifer Wilson's only daughter,” Lestrade answered. Sherlock’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion at the answer and said, “Her daughter? Why would she write her daughter's name? Why?”
“From the case? How could I?” John answered as he leaned back and propped one elbow on the armrest to lean his head on.
John smiled as he read the text. He didn’t know how the man got his number but he shouldn’t be all that surprised. The man apparently has numerous talents and John found that enthralling.
That night, John was lying down on his bed and staring at his mark. The design and the color still haven’t changed- not like John expected it to. The longing to find his soul mate still remained. The curiosity and the desire to find them and get to know them were still there. As he thought of his mystery soul mate, the image of one Sherlock Holmes popped into his head. John couldn’t deny that the man was beautiful. The soft curly locks of dark hair, the pale skin, the high cheekbones, the cupid bow lips and the color of his eyes were all so breathtaking. It made John wonder if the man had already found his soul mate. John shakes his head. Probably not or else he wouldn’t be looking for a flatmate.
John thought in amazement. The huge telly was paused on John’s face.  John walked up to it and pick up the remote and pressed play. Both detective and doctor sat down and continued to watch the clips. Sherlock could feel warmth starting to spread towards his cheeks and he did all he could to stop it. John, however, didn’t care and his cheeks started to blush bright red. When the tape ended, John turned off the telly and turned to face Sherlock, who has a black expression on his face.
“What is it? What did you see?” Greg asked again, excitedly.  John looked at Sherlock for help but the detective just smiled at him.
“Thank you, John. Here’s my card. I have a feeling we will be seeing each other more often from now on,” Lestrade said with a smile as he gave John his calling card.
“I see that Sherlock already told you about me,” the man said with an eyebrow raised. John shakes his head and says, “Nope, I figured it out by myself.”
A few minutes later, Sherlock opened his eyes and saw John sitting on the table and smiling down at him softly. There was a faint blush on the doctor’s face.
“Oh, Mrs. Hudson, the landlady, she’s giving me a special deal- owes me a favor. A few years back, her husband got himself sentenced to death in Florida. I was able to help out,” Sherlock said with his hands clasped behind his back. John looked confused.
“Anyway, we texted him and he called back,” John said to Lestrade. Sherlock stood up straight and had a blank look on his face.
“Bit of trouble too, I bet,” Sherlock said with an amused smirk on his face. Adrenaline started to course through John’s veins.
Sherlock frowned before looking up at John and said, “I don’t know, John, I just wanted to look at the menu so that you would stop bothering me about what I wanted to eat and since you were already holding one, I decided to just use your eyes.”
“You've met him. How many 'friends' do you imagine he has? I am the closest thing to a friend that Sherlock Holmes is capable of having,” the man said.
“I’ll give you my word, John, nothing you say will leave these rooms,” Mycroft said and Greg nodded I agreement.
“Keep looking, guys,” Lestrade ordered. “Or you could help us properly and I'll stand them down,” Lestrade said to Sherlock.
“Oh come on, John, I know you’re smarter than that!” Sherlock exclaimed exasperated as he listened to John’s thoughts.
“I'm not implying anything,” Sherlock cut him off. “I'm sure Sally came round for a nice little chat, and just happened to stay over and I assume she scrubbed your floors, going by the state of her knees.” Sherlock gave the pair of adulterers a patronizing look. John couldn’t help but laugh as they went in. Cheating on your soul mate looked down upon in society. It is unthinkable to hurt and reject your perfect match. John couldn’t understand how some people could do that. If he found his soul mate, he’d cherish them. They spotted the DI putting on a blue bodysuit.
“But how come I’ve never heard of him?” John asked. Sherlock raised an eyebrow expectantly. John frowned before his eyes widened.
“Yes, I do. God help me,” Lestrade said tiredly. John felt bad for the man. Sherlock seemed too much to handle to the DI but John can’t help but find the consulting detective fascinating and exciting.
“Isn't the doorbell working? Your taxi's here, Sherlock,” Mrs. Hudson informed the consulting detective.
“I’ll tell you but you have to swear that nothing leaves these rooms,” John said seriously. Mycroft and Greg looked at each other in both worry and concern.
“I am better and much faster, obviously, and he could just get the information he needs from Lestrade,”
Sherlock slowly opened his eyes, and the first thing he observed was how calm his mind was. His brain was always processing data even when he just woke up. Now, it was peaceful, and it puzzled Sherlock. The next thing the detective noticed was a heavy yet warm weight on his chest. He looked down and saw a head of blonde and grey hair.
“Her phone,” Sherlock answered. “ Where's her mobile phone? There was no phone on the body, there's no phone in the case. We know she had one – that's her number there; you just texted it.”
“Shut up!” Sherlock said annoyed, though there was sadness in his eyes. “I'm not your sniffer dog,” Sherlock continued, looking at Lestrade
Nothing happened. That’s when John noticed the red mark on the underside of the man’s left wrist. The familiar feeling of sadness and longing came to John making him frown slightly.
“Right turn, one way, road works, traffic lights, bus lane, pedestrian crossing, left turn only, traffic lights,” Sherlock mumbled.
“Dear God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring,” Sherlock deadpanned. John tried to hide his laughter while Lestrade just frowned- apparently he’s used to Sherlock’s attitude.
“Anything on the menu, whatever you want, free. On the house, for you and for your date,” the man offered generously. Sherlock sat back down and looked at John.
“No,” John said in denial. He continued to look into Sherlock’s eyes and saw a flicker of fear in them.
“Her wedding ring- ten years old at least. Her matching bond mark is horizontally crossed,” Sherlock said as he showed the DI and John the dead woman’s broken bond mark on underside of her left wrist. “The rest of her jewelry has been regularly cleaned, but not her wedding ring. State of her marriage right there. The inside of the ring is shinier than the outside – that means it's regularly removed. The only polishing it gets is when she works it off her finger. It's not for work, look at her nails. She doesn't work with her hands, so what or rather who does she remove her rings for? Clearly not one lover; she'd never sustained the fiction of being single over that amount of time, so more likely a string of them. Simple.”
“Protection! If the wrong people find out then, your brother could be in danger and thus, endangering the country. Also, if the people of the country finds out, then they will lose trust that the government is as efficient as it seems,” John explained. Sherlock smiled proudly.
“Says the man at the door,” Sherlock’s smirk never leaving his face as he gestured towards the door. Just then, there was a knock at the door. John opened the door to find Angelo standing there.
“You can't just break into my flat,” Sherlock responded annoyed. John looked around and saw people rummaging through Sherlock’s things.
“Look across the street. Taxi,” Sherlock said, bringing John out from his reverie. “Stopped. Nobody getting in and nobody getting out.” John watches Sherlock as the man’s mind thought up theories at the speed of light.
“Don't wanna use mine- always a chance that the number will be recognized. It's on the website,” the detective responded.
“Oh, for God's sake, married? If you're just making this up...” Lestrade questioned in disbelief. Marriage was only for people who lost their soul mates –a black line strikethrough the matching mark to represent the broken bond- and ended up with someone else and the only symbol of their matrimony was a ring. Soul mates, on the other hand, are automatically considered an official couple and no special ceremony is needed. They just need to register their new soul mark for recording purposes. A separation is when two soul mates manually tattoo a black line over their matching mark to signify the ending of their bond- although doing so is extremely look down upon in society. One can notice the difference between a naturally broken bond and a manually broken bond. The key difference is that a manually broken bond line is slanted while a naturally broken bond line is horizontal. Divorce is only for people who are married, understandably.
“Nicotine patch. Helps me think,” Sherlock exhaled deeply. “Impossible to sustain a smoking habit in London these days. Bad news for brain work.” John frowned.
John wondered. It really didn’t register to him at first. He was distracted with protecting Sherlock’s dignity.
“Well, it seems you’re a match for my foolish little brother. Someone’s got to keep an eye on him,” the man said nonchalantly. “My name is Mycroft and it seems I was right.” John immediately blushed and looked away, tried to block his thoughts from Sherlock. Sherlock was confused and a little jealous and John can still feel that through their bond. He thought about all sorts of things just to keep that certain memory from Sherlock. The detective’s annoyance grew.
“Good. Thank you,” Sherlock replied as he turned back towards the window. A few minutes of tense silence later, John finished eating. He didn’t know what to say. He shouldn’t have opened up the topic of relationships. He was just so curious about the man he seems to have a strange feeling for. He couldn’t help but learn more about the brilliant detective. He was like the embodiment of danger and excitement.  And it made John’s heart race. Sherlock is just brilliant!
“I don't have one. I barely know him. I met him... “John stopped and tried to remember when he met the detective, “...yesterday.” The man hummed in acknowledgment.
“Yeah, I wasn’t really thinking about the menu but on what Sherlock might like to eat. While I was thinking that, Sherlock used my eyes to pick something from the menu since I was looking at it but like I said I wasn’t thinking about it,” John tried to explain to the DI. Greg frowned in confusion.
“Perfectly sound analysis, but I was hoping you'd go deeper,” Sherlock said and John sighed in defeat but couldn’t help feeling proud that Sherlock acknowledges his skills.
“Who cares about decent? The game, Mrs. Hudson, is on!” Sherlock said as he turned dramatically with a swish of his coat. John followed as he smiled with amusement.
“What do you think?” Sherlock asked with a bit of excitement on his face. John gave him a look of doubt. Sherlock frowned in response.
“But they're just for my hip. They're herbal soothers,” Mrs. Hudson frowned even deeper. Just then a look of extreme annoyance appeared on Sherlock’s face and he, then, yelled, “Shut up, everybody, shut up! Don't move, don't speak, don't breathe. I'm trying to think. Anderson, face the other way. You're putting me off.” Sherlock did a go away motion towards Anderson, which he responded with a look of indignation and said, “What? My face is?!” Lestrade, who seems to know Sherlock fairly well, ordered, “Everybody quiet and still. Anderson, turn your back.”
Once they were both seated in the cab, John looked at Sherlock with a questioning gaze before he looked away. Sherlock, of course, noticed.
“Information. Nothing indiscreet. Nothing you'd feel... uncomfortable with. Just tell me what he's up to,” the man requested.
“It's a drugs bust, Mrs. Hudson,” John answered her when it became clear that Sherlock wasn’t going to.
“But I would prefer for various reasons that my concern goes unmentioned. We have what you might call a... difficult relationship,” the man requested as he fiddled with his umbrella. John’s phone chimed again.
Sherlock thought. Even if his brother was annoying and controlling and over-bearing, he was still one of the only people that Sherlock could trust.
Sherlock, then, saw the cab they were chasing drive by them and stopped making John almost bumped into his back.
“Well, thank God you're above all that!” John replied mockingly. His phone beeped and John took it from his pocket to see a text message from Sherlock.
“Of course she's not. She's from out of town, though. Intended to stay in London for one night... before returning home to Cardiff,” Sherlock said as he pocketed his phone. “So far, so obvious.”
“Good for you,” Sherlock responded as the man placed two fingers on either side of his temple and shut his eyes.
“Suitcase, yes. She's been married at least ten years, but not happily. She's had a string of lovers but none of them knew she was married,” Sherlock observed.
The airport was a hassle, as John expected. He hates domestic travel abroad, but Mary insisted. Apparently it’s not a real holiday if there isn’t a beach. When John pointed out that England has beaches, the look he got in return told him it wasn’t worth the argument. As a second hour passes trapped in the nether-zone between security and the boarding gate, Mary decides she’s going to browse the shops, just for something to do. John remains seated, blaming his leg. Since the wedding he has felt more pain in the joints than he has since- well, since he met Sherlock and moved into 221B, years back.
Lestrade feels completely wrong footed. “I didn’t know you were such a romantic.” He takes a sip of his beer, unsure why he’s suddenly feeling nervous. “John’s married now, he’s not the sort to skip out on his wife.”
John. In a minute, he’d be fussing over Sherlock, doing the little mother hen routine that John always did.
"Ah, Mr Holmes here is a fantastic man! I was on trial for murder, and Sherlock found the evidence to prove my innocence! I owe him my freedom!” The blonde leant forward in apparent interest. “It’s what he does, a sort of hobby, solving crimes. The police let him help sometimes, he’s very good.” Angelo finished his little speech of praise, then skidded off to serve bald man in tracksuit bottoms and a safety jacket who had just entered the café.
“All in a line, working north-east, and then suddenly a twist in the line heading north-west to Clapton. Or maybe they aren’t in a line at all? Maybe drawing the sides of a square? That leaves the culprit in the centre of the square, so obviously enclosing the area he operates from - must be a red herring. Or maybe he’s not that clever - wouldn’t have to be to fool Scotland Yard. But why these shops and homes. Why choose these ones. Especially when it all went wrong on the last break-in, and he had to murder; that was clumsy. He can’t be selecting the most vulnerable places. So there must be another link.”
John paced the streets of London, a disheveled and bedraggled man. He ducked into his favorite pub ignoring the fact that it was eleven o’clock on a Saturday.
John caught Sherlock’s other hand with his own, almost without thinking, entwining their fingers. Having to sit in the face of such blatant, pure truth was almost searing him to the bone. Sherlock deserved far better-
John exhaled. The emotions that provoked were not unlike the emotions he had the day he got shot, wondering if the bullet hit a main artery, and if that was his last day on earth.
“You didn’t want to disappoint me. We both know you have a tendency towards the sentimental,” Sherlock said, his voice sounding normal, but the breaths in between sounding wavering and blurry. Still, he didn’t stand up.
“Ah, Molly, coffee. Thank you,” the man said as he took the cup from her. “What happened to the lipstick?” The woman smiled sadly.
“Yes, obviously,” Sherlock answered as he rested his elbows on top of his knees and his fingers under his chin. “Oh, perhaps I should mention, I didn't kill her,” Sherlock added as an afterthought.
“Okay,” John said and looked at Sherlock, who was still sending texts to his client. “Well, I could enter Sherlock’s mind.” Both men’s eyes widened at that.
“Never mind that. We found the case,” Anderson injected rudely. “According to someone, the murderer has the case, and we found it in the hands of our favorite psychopath.” John frowned angrily at the forensic officer’s statement, unaware that Lestrade was watching him.
“The killer must have driven her to Lauriston Gardens. He could only keep her case by accident if it was in the car. Nobody could be seen with this case without drawing attention – particularly a man, which is statistically more likely. So obviously he'd feel compelled to get rid of it the moment he noticed he still had it- wouldn't have taken him more than five minutes to realize his mistake. I checked every back street wide enough for a car five minutes from Lauriston Gardens and anywhere you could dispose of a bulky object without being observed- took me less than an hour to find the right skip,” Sherlock explained smugly.
“Haven't the faintest. Hungry?” Sherlock asked as they entered a small Italian restaurant. “Thank you, Billy,” said the consulting detective as a waiter opened the door and led them to a table by the window. Both men sat down facing each other. John opened the menu and scanned it while Sherlock looked out the window.
There was just something about the man that John found so intriguing. He was clearly a smart and clever man to be able to know all those things about John. He just wanted to know how the man did it. He was curious. Also, something about the man screamed danger and excitement that made John’s heart race with adrenaline. He couldn’t wait to meet Sherlock tomorrow.
“What gives you the right to call this man a freak?” John clarified for her. The woman’s face hardened.
“You do make me happy, Sherlock, even if we only just met. I should be the grateful one, you know,” John said quietly. Sherlock frowned when he felt John’s insecurity.
“I didn't order a taxi. Go away,” Sherlock said, as he waved a hand at her dismissively. Mrs. Hudson didn’t appear to be offended and just looked around the flat.
“You,” Sherlock replied with a knowing smirk. “Mrs. Hudson! Doctor Watson will take the room upstairs.” John’s heart fluttered at the statement.
“Yes... because you need me,” Sherlock responded self-importantly. John looked at the two men feeling like a third wheel. Lestrade has a look of defeat on his face.
“Yes! How slow of me! Of course, Mycroft has heard of him. He has a very vast network and its part of his job to keep an eye on those kinds of people. Since he knows I love serial killers and was currently on the case, he would just let me handle it such is M.O. or else he would interfere,” Sherlock explained.
“Afghanistan. Sorry, how did you know…?” John was cut off by the door opening and a woman walked in carrying a cup.  The man turned to her as he carefully handed John’s phone to him without touching him.
“I wonder if you could enter my mind, John. Like really enter it, not just thoughts and feelings and memories passing through,” Sherlock said, excitement in his voice at the experiment. That would be interesting to see.
“This is his hunting ground, right here in the heart of the city. Now that we know his victims were abducted, that changes everything. Because all of his victims disappeared from busy streets, crowded places, but nobody saw them go,” Sherlock deduced. “Think! Who do we trust, even though we don't know them? Who passes unnoticed wherever they go? Who hunts in the middle of a crowd?” he continued oratorically.
“How?” John couldn’t help but ask. Sherlock just smiled knowingly. Just then, Mrs. Hudson walked in with the morning paper.
“Hey, where-where did you get this?” John asked as he looks at Sherlock’s hand, not making a move to touch him. Sherlock carefully handed the ID to John. John read it with perplexity.
Sherlock replied. John sighed and looked at the pair across them. The two were waiting, although Mycroft seemed to be trying to keep his impatience from showing.
“She's German. Rache, it's German for revenge. She could be trying to tell us something…” the man from before said as he suddenly appeared by the door. Sherlock walked up to him.
“What? No... No!” Sherlock denied as he sat up from the sofa and moved to sit on the armchair. “Type and send it. Quickly! Have you sent it?”
“...Okay,” John responded uncertainly. Then, a big man with long slightly curly hair and a huge smile came up to their table.
“People don't have arch-enemies,” John said quietly as his meal arrived, unsure about how to start the conversation. Sherlock turned to face him.
“Good shot,” Sherlock praised quietly. And just like that, John’s anger disappeared. He frowned confused. He didn’t say anything in response. Sherlock frowned and observed John carefully.
“You’re welcome, Sherlock,” John said. Before Sherlock could give a response, a funny- looking and arrogant bloke came out of the building.
“So you use the excuse of getting paid as a justification for liking this kind of work but you condemn and insult a man who offers you his services for free just because he
“That’s funny because I was there when your boss, DI Lestrade, came to get Sherlock,” John said with a smirk. The woman’s face fell.
“Do you plan to continue your association with Sherlock Holmes?” the man inquired. John fought the urge to roll his eyes at the man. He didn’t think the posh bastard would appreciate his effort.
“Because you're an idiot,” John said annoyed as he turned and walked away. He wasn’t able to take more than a few steps before his right hand was grabbed. John’s heart raced when he realized it was Sherlock’s hand he was holding. He turned to face the detective when he noticed the bright golden light surrounding them. He saw Sherlock’s eyes widen as he felt a fiery sensation encircling his right wrist. The sensation grew stronger as his soul mark started to burn as well. He gasped in pain and looked down at their hands. He saw a symbol started to darken around his wrist. It was starting to get too painful and yet Sherlock didn’t let go. The light around them grew brighter and his head was starting to hurt as well. He could hear Sherlock gasped in pain. Slowly, the pain started to go away and the golden light dimmed. He looked up and saw Sherlock’s eyes were shut as he clutched his head in pain with his left hand. John gaped when he saw the golden symbol around Sherlock’s left wrist. He immediately looked down at his right wrist and saw the same symbol on it.
“Do people usually assume you're the murderer?” he asked in return. Just the thought of the baseless accusations that must have been aimed at the brilliant man out of jealousy or cruelty was making him angry and sad.
“I know you're an Army doctor and you've been invalided home from Afghanistan. I know you've got a brother who's worried about you- (John smiled at the man’s mistake) - but you won't go to him for help because you don't approve of him – possibly because he's an alcoholic; more likely because he recently walked out on his soul mate and I know that your therapist thinks your limp's psychosomatic – quite correctly, I'm afraid. Also, I know that you still haven’t found your soul mate judging from the color of your mark,” the man said calculatedly. John frowned at the man’s knowledge of him. It was a bit unnerving.
John giggled. Sherlock looks down at John with a soft smile. John felt content. He finally found his soul mate. The emptiness in his chest disappeared as it fills up with love for the eccentric man beside him.
Sherlock thought. John just chuckled and turned towards Mycroft and Lestrade. He noticed that they were standing too closely to each other. Remembering Mycroft’s mark on his left wrist, he started to wonder if Lestrade was Mycroft’s soul mate. He felt the evident joy coming from Sherlock.
“Teaching now. Bright young things, like we used to be. God, I hate them!” Mike replied with a smile. “What about you? Just staying in town ‘til you get yourself sorted out?”
“He visited my mind palace,” Sherlock said suddenly and putting his phone away. Mycroft and Greg’s eyes widened at that. Sherlock enjoyed the look of surprise on his brother’s face. It was rare that he caught Mycroft off guard.
Once they were inside the cab, Sherlock started texting on his phone while John looked out the window. Out of the corner of his eye, Sherlock noticed John seemed to be deep in thought and there were wrinkles between his eyebrows. Concerned, Sherlock listened in on John’s thought.
“Damn it!” John exclaimed as he followed after the consulting detective. As they walked out the street, he wondered if he could ask Sherlock about his opinion on soul mates. While John was thinking about how to brooch the subject of soul mates to Sherlock, he didn’t notice Sherlock looking at him with a gentle smile. A couple in their late teens walked passed them and John noticed a purple mark on the woman’s wrist. John was immediately filled with envy. He longed to find his soul mate but it seemed that he was destined to be alone. John sighed and turned to look at Sherlock, who by then was observing their surroundings.
“Why does she hate you so much and call you freak?” John asked. He noticed that when the woman called Sherlock a ‘freak’ it seemed more than just an insult. The look in her eyes had fear in them. Sherlock looked at him with a hint of worry in his eyes.
“He is the British Government,” Sherlock replied matter-of-factly and causing John’s eyebrows furrowed in confusion.
Sherlock thought as he looked at John with a certain gleam in his eyes. John fought the smile that was trying to appear on his face.
Sherlock thought. John looked at the doors and picked the one called Abilities. The detective could feel John’s curiosity through the bond. As they entered, John’s eyes widened in surprise. Not saying anything, John just walked around the room. With each picture, Sherlock could feel John’s amazement and confusion.
“Ah Sherlock, John, good evening,” Mycroft said in greeting. Sherlock just rolled his eyes as he sat down across his brother.
Sherlock tuned him out and continued to text, although he couldn’t ignore the warm feeling in his chest. John didn’t seem to notice it and so, Sherlock didn’t disturb him.
, Sherlock thought curiously. He took that tape and walked towards the telly and turned it on. He placed the tape in the player and sat down on the sofa. The video played and Sherlock was stunned. The tape was a compilation of all the deductions Sherlock told John and John’s reactions to them. Sherlock stopped the video and stood up.
The person on the other line told him the placements of the cameras around him and John watched as they all turned away.  A black Mercedes suddenly appeared and the voice on the phone told him to get in the car. Deciding it was in his best interest to follow, John went in and found a beautiful woman inside. John sat down silently as the car drove away.
“Yeah, Sergeant Donovan,” John started. There was something that was bugging John about the female officer since he met her.
“Your brain will be much sharper if you have the energy to burn. Trust me, that’s what kept me alive in Afghanistan,” John said. Sherlock nodded and started eating. John sat down and started eating as well but Sherlock knows that the doctor was watching him closely to make sure he ate everything on his plate. Despite being forced to eat, Sherlock couldn’t help the warmth that started to spread in his entire body. To be cared for was something Sherlock hardly experienced. Sherlock knows, even though he tries to ignore it, Mycroft cares for him. But Mycroft doesn’t count because he is Sherlock’s brother and by default, cares for Sherlock. The only other people he can think of that care for him are Mrs. Hudson and Lestrade. But Lestrade is his brother’s soul mate so that is to be expected and Mrs. Hudson is such a mother hen and therefore, cares about everyone. So really, there is only John; John, who cared about him before he even knew they were soul mates and who shot a person to save him and who followed Sherlock around the city despite people warning him about the eccentric detective. People just don’t care about Sherlock because he is different. He thinks and acts differently. Therefore, people avoid him and thus, not care about him. People avoid anything that’s different. He doesn’t care if he said too much because it is the truth. He doesn’t care about the repercussions of his actions because to him, it was necessary at the moment. Before meeting John, part of him even thought that his own soul mate might not like him and might even be disgusted by him. To know that John didn’t act like that made Sherlock feel relieved.
