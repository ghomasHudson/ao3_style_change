"It doesn't matter what it looks like. It's none of his business," Steve said simply,  not taking his eyes of off Fury. To his credit, the director's face remained neutral when an almost naked Tony appeared. He didn't even look surprised.
"Thank you Banjo.  ...you go with Tony and the others to the lobby.  I'm gonna go check out outside."
Tony didn't feel like he needed a promise; Aunt Peggy wouldn't steal his mate away.  Ugh.  How embarrassingly
"I'll get your goddamn bottle of Jack," he muttered and with that Steve pulled away. If Tony wanted to die drinking then that was his choice to make, wasn't it?
"What's in the box?" asked Tony eagerly, slipping his hands over Steve's, tonguing the hollow of his throat.
Then there was a screech and the comms turned on, a voice filtering through; it was the director's. Steve recognised the words and moved to cover Bucky's ears but it was too late.
Tony shifted a little on top of Steve.  Nothing killed a good knot like talking about this stuff.  Tony pulled out of Steve but remained lying on top of him.  He felt shame and guilt at how he'd never recognized how fucked up everything was.  It didn't affect him.  He had a vague notion that Ana, Jarvis's wife, had been in an arranged bond during the war, but either she had escaped or it had fallen through because of the war.  Details were sketchy.  Another history lost because Tony hadn't thought it necessary to actually talk to an omega.
He stepped out of the room to find Vim; she awkwardly patted his arm to get his attention. "You gotta break the chain before we can lift him."
Steve downed all of his 'lemonade' before Gideon came over, in preparation. He set the glass down on a pausing tray with canapés and exhaled slowly. Okay. It was time to be
"You're the best, Happy," said Tony, climbing into the back of the Audi and opening the container of soup.  His eating habits, Steve had come to learn over the last few weeks, were at best strange and at worst almost inhuman.  Tony ate when he felt like it, and ate what he wanted to; his wealth let him request nearly anything at any time, and he had no qualms about taking advantage of that.
"...please," he asked softly, almost hesitantly.  He loved the idea of Steve dressing up for him, of getting to have the exclusive privilege to undress and bone Captain America.  He was so used to Steve being Steve that sometimes he forgot about Steve's persona, the one with the costume and the deep sotto voice and the all-American soldier-next-door thing.  But he also didn't want to be someone like Gideon, who got his kicks from it.
"You don't have to like it Tony," Steve whispered. "Accepting it, and emotionally dealing with something...they're very different things."
Yeah, whatever.  He could handle it, he guessed.  The things the media was saying about him, and had been saying since January.  The things his father had sometimes said to him, when he was drunk.
Pepper had eyed him, up and down.  She knew perfectly well how Tony felt about kids.  He wouldn't date women with kids; that was one of his only deal-breakers.
, but hey, look, you were spying on me, too.  Forgive and forget if it'll get me on the team.  ...I wanna be there with you, Steve."
Tony had thought the matter with the concierge had been fully dealt with, but then they got to their suite, where the phone was ringing. Steve didn't want to answer it. But he pulled his mobile out to find his phone was, in fact, dead and, sighed.
"I literally brought the Winter Soldier to you last week; I'd say that makes up for at least some of the trouble I caused." The line was quiet for a moment and then Steve asked, "I did do the right thing, didn't I?"
Tony let Steve lace their fingers together, and he squeezed his hand lovingly, staring out the window.
"...thanks, buddy, you're the best," said Tony.  "You're my second-favorite omega here. Seriously, I love you."
"DeSoto, I'm not angry at you," said Tony.  His voice sounded tired and impatient, even to him.  "I'm going to talk to Ron and tell him how good you were and how happy I am that I won some time with you."
me to be here!  What do you want?"  Pepper's voice was getting a note of desperation.  Tony ignored her.  Having cried himself out, he felt... strangely empty.  It was sort of nice.  A hollow hunger.  A Steve-shaped hole that, like a socket that was missing a tooth, Tony couldn't help but prod at, over and over.  It hurt, mostly in his chest, around his heart, but it was growing into something that wasn't pain.  Something that wasn't anything.  Tony was okay with that.  Maybe this was Takotsubo Syndrome... If so, it wasn't actually so awful.  Was this what Jarvis experienced during those last two years after his father had died?  Hey, it beat palladium poisoning, anyway.  It was better this way.  Better not to feel anything.
Pietro picked up a screwdriver from the table; Tony looked up at him like a lamb about to be slaughtered.
Tony immediately noticed that he was, as as Alpha, in the minority.  He was used to being in rooms with millionaires, billionaires, businessmen, military folks... and he'd always found himself among Alphas and betas.  Omegas in Tony's world had, up until very recently, been a minority, and they had usually been around in a serving capacity. Being one of very few Alphas in the room was a weird experience.  Also, all of them were looking at Steve before Tony. A bubble of jealousy rose in Tony's gut. He was used to being the center of attention but everyone was shaking Steve's hand and greeting him first.
Pietro glanced into the mirror above the sink.  There was no denying he looked a little flushed.  He looked back to Wanda. "...what do we do?"
"...I'm supposed to protect you," murmured Tony back into the dark quiet of the room.  "Trying isn't good enough, Steve.  Today, I put you in danger.  Steve, you're my whole world.  When I bit you, it
"Hey, if it's Nat, you should ask to talk to Clint.  One omega to another," suggested Tony from the kitchette. "...I'm pretty sure he would agree with me, though.  Putting yourself through this, it's not proving anything, man. Like, you don't need to hit your hand with a hammer to show off how high your pain tolerance is, you know?  Fuck Malick, don't do this just to prove a point." Tony rummaged around the fridge. He was starving.
"You know..." Steve flopped down on the bed next to Tony. He pressed a kiss to his shoulder. "If you're, um... getting tired, there are toys we can use instead."
"You literally wanted me to leave you alone less than twenty-four.  You pushed me away.  Or at least, as much as an O really can, anyway.  You left. You told me not to try to find you.  Steve, I'm here.
. He was the worst possible audience. Then Steve had been furious that Gideon dare mention the mark on Tony, the reminder of Afghanistan, such a hard time for Tony, but a time that made him stronger. Gideon seemed in every sense, weak, to Steve. He was sure he wouldn't come out the other side of such a traumatic incident as well as Tony had done.
What the hell had Steve been thinking when he let them inject him with the serum, Tony wondered.  Did Steve realize he was signing up for what was very likely to be a life where he'd never be able to bond?  Did he care?  His previous bond sounded so miserable, so tragic.  Maybe Steve hadn't really cared anymore.  Maybe, back in the forties, bonding had been seen as an imprisonment, and Steve didn't want anything to do with it anymore.
Then Steve laughed too but there was uneasiness that lingered in his bones. He couldn't shake the feeling.  It was a strange sensation that- no matter where - the Winter Soldier was headed straight for him. And that there was nothing he could do about it.  That they were on a collision course.
. If you don't know where you go from here then there's nothing wrong with that. You give yourself time to figure it out for yourself. That's something I wish I'd done when I was your age."
It was hard like this (pun not intended). Steve had to go slowly to make sure Tony didn't slip out which meant he felt every inch of him. He grunted, low in his throat, as the head squeezed inside
"Tony's a good guy too, Steve. I was worried before. But I see it now. He's a good guy. A good one."
Assuming it got tough, that is.  Hey, maybe it wouldn't be so bad.  Tony was pretty confident he'd compartmentalized the worst of it.  Maybe it wouldn't come out at all.
She flushed bright red and looked like the only reason she hadn't slapped him was because she was too shocked.
Tony buried his face into Steve's neck and nuzzled him, mostly for his own comfort.  Steve's smell was almost as good as a couple of glasses of scotch.  (Almost.)  It was a relief to know Steve was okay, but not at all a relief to realize they'd been playing with fire for the last six weeks.
It was paying off now, though, because Tony was discovering most of the materials he needed lying around the shop.  He gutted one of his bots for parts and tore apart his desk searching for components, slowly building a pile in the center of the room.  The collision point would go
people, and it didn't bother him anymore. He compartmentalized the violence and he did what he had to do without hesitation because that's how battles were won.  And he couldn't say he had many regrets.  Certainly not with HYDRA, no. Because now it was
"It has the base best equipped to handle him.  A very nice little cell with adimantimun bars and a thick blanket on the floor for him to sleep on.  No doubt Stark's been pampering him."
They went to see Churchill's war rooms, the museum having perfectly preserved his underground bunker.
"Thanks," Steve said with a small smile, clearly already in a far better mood than he had been this morning.
Tony sat back down, looking to meet Steve's eyes, and raised a glass of champagne.  "Well... good," he said. He wasn't sure what to say about her. She'd always been Aunt Peggy to him when he was a child, but they'd fallen out.  The loss of his parents, followed shortly by the death of Edwin and Ana Jarvis, had shaken Tony to the core. After graduating college at seventeen, he'd spent the next several years alone, drinking from his father's extremely well-stocked bar and fiddling around with rocket designs in his room.  Aunt Peggy had tried to be there for him; she had tried to be sympathetic, and then, when that hadn't worked, had tried tough love. But Tony had only wanted to be left alone and in the end, Obadiah had been the one to shoo her away and "let the boy mourn how he likes."
Two sets of eyes were fixed on him, waiting patiently.  Neither seemed judgemental. Rather, curious... tinged with concern.
"Absolutely," said Tony, still coughing lightly.  "I'm making a ton of progress down there! Go do yoga, go be stretchy.  I love stretchiness. You can show me what you learned later." He wiggled his eyebrows.
Now that it was a month away from their bonding anniversary, there had been some discussion about which orchids to auction and which to keep.  Tony had already picked out Pepper's orchid and Rhodey's orchid and a random white one he liked that reminded him of his father's and Jarvis's.  He had been waffling on whether or not to keep the one Banksy had given them on the show. (He wouldn't admit it, but he still had a bit of his childhood crush on Banksy.)
"Okay, so there's one about pregnancy. Nope." Steve scrolled through the list. "Also, to try and win an omega you have to put one on the table. You're not betting me for shit. I don't care how good you think you are," he told him pointedly and found the second workshop. "Huh. Okay, there's one for
Part of being Iron Man was penance.  Trying to make up for the sins of the son, and the sins of the father.  He'd been talking about protecting the troops and creating peace for decades, stupidly and blissfully unaware that his work was indiscriminately destroying whole villages of innocent people.
Steve frowned again, looking so genuinely sad it almost hurt to look at. He didn't like those. Why were they making him take those? "But my whelps," he said.
"Um, I'm Iron Man, and he's Captain America," said Tony.  "We're our own security.  Also, there's no one who's out to get us.  I mean, Vanko's dead, and he's Russian, not German and--"
"I know him," he said, looking up, pointing to the glossy picture with his finger.  The doctor didn't hear him, he was arguing about money.
"Uh-huh," said Tony weakly.  The swagger and bravado that Natasha and Sam had complained about earlier was gone, replaced with a stupefied docility that was extremely uncomfortable to witness.  A lot of people came out of the simulation with this sort of dazed compliance, though.
"Okay, fine, whatever, just make sure someone brings me my coffee," snapped Tony, who just wanted Martin and co. to leave.  The moment they did, he looked at Natasha.  "We can just leave, right?  They can't officially detain us, right?  We can just get up and walk- or, in my case, limp- out of here.  I want to go back to Malibu.  Sleep in my own bed.  Bang my omega."
"I don't care about who's taking care of him. I care about who's gonna take care of you," he told him, reluctantly standing up when Donner did. He didn't want to leave him but it was clear the other was done talking. "Alright Donner. I..." Steve hesitated by the door. "Sleep well."
"Tony.  Focus," said Sam.  "Relax. Think about the way he smells.  Think about his face. His eyes. The way he moves..."
"Sorry, I..." Steve's voice sounded lost, too quiet. He pulled his hand back from the window; he had pressed it there, half-hoping and half-dreading that another hand would come up, as it had in his dream.   "Do you ever have a dream that you're not sure is a dream?" Steve asked in a murmur and then finally turned around to face Tony, his blue eyes glazed over with doubt.
It had taken a fair bit of arm-twisting to convince SHIELD to let them go on a ten-day vacation, since they were supposed to be checking in weekly, but it had been allowed in the end because, after all, it was their first anniversary and the nation expected them to go on a getaway.  Pepper had booked them a suite at the Langham, which was near Hyde Park. Tony had insisted on a hotel with a spa, and had also insisted they be near the park because he knew Steve would want to go running, little cardio bunny that he was.
Another eye roll. "I remember the time you all decided to play sardines down there. It was a nightmare. We didn't find Pinky for
Steve leaned up to press a kiss to the corner of Tony's mouth. "You want the day to start yet?" he asked in a murmur.
"As.... my omega?" asked Tony cautiously.  He wasn't yet ready to banish the idea that Steve had some ulterior motive, but if they came out as being paired... well, there was no reversing that. Everyone knew who Captain America was; everyone knew who Tony Stark was; the two of them being bonded would be a national headline.
you, Tony," Steve said, sounding amused. "When you're in heat, you feel... frustrated. It's like a junkie not getting their fix; it drives you crazy. So I've tore up a door, or two. But with you around I shouldn't feel the need to do that, you know?" he tried to assure him. The last thing Steve ever wanted to do was hurt Tony. The thought was abhorrent. But sometimes he simply didn't know his own strength, especially not in a heat. "Like I said, we'll figure it out together when it comes to it."
He felt it like a punch to the gut and couldn't shake it, and knew he had to act.  His primary goal was finding Karpov, since Steve was found. But he could barely focus on his notebook and gave up after a while.  The urge to go protect Steve was overwhelming, crowding all other thoughts from his mind.
Steve had already worked his way through an entire bread basket; they hadn't gotten their meals yet.  Tony was on his second drink.
special effects were shit so you knew they weren't real. I don't like yours." Steve honestly didn't get how it was entertainment. He'd seen plenty of men die and it was never
"Congrats on the show, by the way. The third omega hosted show though? That surprises me. I heard about Ellen. I thought there would be more..."
"I think it's someone's personality that dictates how attractive they really are," Steve said. "Us omegas are more than our appearance, after all." Gideon totally ignored him.  Steve tried again.  "You know, when Nazis are shooting at you... they don't really care what you look like."
"Are you okay?" Steve asked, wincing a little as Tony was rushing down the steps of the Expo, jostling him. His grip was firm but cold on Steve's legs.
"I can't," he repeated.  His sheets were red silk, cool and light and nothing like Steve's warm heavy blankets.  He stared at the ceiling, lit up with the blue glow from his chest.
HYDRA hadn't succeeded today and but Steve felt like he'd still lost the battle.  He had come face-to-face with the mythological Winter Soldier and his worst fears had been confirmed.  All this time Bucky had been suffering and he'd done
"Hey, let's go for a walk," said Tony.  He needed to go outside. Musing over locks and captivity and being trapped was making him feel claustrophobic.  The museum was airy but it didn't matter. He needed to be outside, weather be damned.
Security were all betas. Malick turned around to yell at one who had emerged from a door way. "Well, do something!"
to give him a break, except he didn't want one." Steve sent DeSoto a look and the omega looked just about ready to stick his tongue out at Steve. The blond sighed. "Anyway, how are things with you?"
"You won't win," said Pietro flatly.  "If you love James so much, come back to him.  He misses you, you know. He's downstairs. You could go to him, right now.  He's still in there. You have nowhere else to go, so why not?"
Briefly, it crossed his mind that Steve and Barnes had never gotten this.  That Barnes's refusal to mate Steve, and Steve's inability to have a full heat, meant they never experienced this weird post-heat bonding.  He had mixed feelings. Pity, yes. Outrage on Steve's behalf. Relief that this was unique to him and Steve, and that he didn't have to share this with Barnes.  And also a begrudging sense of respect that Barnes had had the willpower never to mate Steve. Tony still hadn't told him about Barnes's motivations, about Barnes's concern for Steve's health.  Still hadn't told him that he was sure that Barnes had actually loved him. It would only complicate things and Tony didn't want the competition.
Steve went to grab a towel from the bathroom, dousing it in cold water before he brought it back to press against the nape of Tony's neck gently, cooling the heated skin. "We'll be separated for the whole evening anyway. There's no point you wearing it, not if it will hurt you. And if you're hanging around Frond more it's bound to get your hackles up." Steve's voice was laced with concern, his other hand gently brushing against Tony's cheek. He tried for a smile. "Kinda sorry I won't be there to see you beat all their asses."
This time there was no mistaking the Winter Soldier as anyone else.  His hair was long, shadowing his eyes; the rest of his face was obscured by a mask; he was definitely, absolutely
"Got it," Steve said softly and perhaps lingered in the doorway a moment longer than he needed to. He swallowed and then tried for a smile that didn't quite meet his eyes. "It's no problem, Tony."
"Tony!  Oh my goodness, you really are the spitting image of your father.  Doesn't he look just like Howie, Steve?"
-- Captain Rogers, did you say you were pregnant?  You had a miscarriage? Was that this century or last?  Was it your first Alpha's?  Was it Tony's? How far along were you?"  The room was quickly falling into disorder. The cameraman gave Steve a "wrap it up" signal.  Offstage, Aria was texting with her phone in one hand and Pepper's in the other, while Pepper was having a breathless phone call with the Associated Press, trying to clarify some of Steve's statements.
The only real thing he could say he was happy about was the knowledge that he was going to go out in a blaze of avenging glory.  The fuckers had no idea what he was planning.  He was going to burn this whole god-forsaken hellhole to the ground, cleanse it with fire.  They wouldn't know what hit him.  They thought he'd been broken, and in a way, he had been.  But he had every intention of bringing them all down with him.
"I have my phone. Fully charged," Steve promised him and sat up a little. He pulled his phone out and checked. Yep. 99% percent. That was partly why Steve was so bad at charging his phone. Because it was StarkTech it didn't need charging often, which meant he basically always forgot to when it actually finally died.  "I'll survive. Promise. Besides, no one in here even looks at me anyway...I doubt I'll have a problem getting around," Steve said. Back when he was smaller too he could have literally snuck into anywhere unnoticed. Once a local gang had tried to recruit him for smuggling purposes. Bucky had been furious; Steve had thought it was a lark.
?  ...my God.  Fine. Wire me the money and we'll buy the tickets.  ...yes, yes, between the witch and the soldier we'll easily be able to capture him.  Yes, of course. Okay. Hail HYDRA."
He threw back his scotch, handed it to a nearby omega without looking, and blurted, "How do you know they're comfortable?  Have you ever tried one on?" He was sort of hoping this would shed some light on Lydia's status.
"Please don't leave me, oh...oh." Steve frowned as he watched Tony stagger into the bathroom. He stretched his hands out towards Tony and slumped down on the sofa, curling out towards him.
"...you know, you didn't do bad in there," said Natasha.  "In mine, I attacked Fury and bit off part of his ear.  ...you really kept your cool.  I bet they'll approve you for duty before the end of next week."
Pepper offered him a drink.  He thanked her, took it, and proceeded to begin arranging it around the countertop without drinking from it.
"Yeah, I got it Steve." He could hear a half-smile in Clint's voice. "You really cooked up a storm at his conference, huh?"
Tony hopped off the car he was sitting on, finished the beer, and crumpled up the can.  "Steve, once all those kids walk out, then what? Do we like, pay for them to stay at a hotel or something?  I don't want to start adopts strays..."
weird, and I thought bonding was different than dating, I mean.... I mean, you don't have to marry the person you bond with, right?  I mean, you wanna talk about
Steve woke with a groan  at a loud beeping sound. Tony was soft inside of him and when he rolled over the Alpha slipped out. Steve winced and the ringing continued. He felt around on the bed stand blindly and pressed the phone to his ear after dragging across the little green bar. "Mph, hello?" Steve ran a hand over his face and through his hair.
"It's definitely a threat," Steve murmured, sinking back down onto the sofa and tugging Tony down with him. "But we can't let them intimidate us. I figure that if HYDRA actually wanted me dead then I would be already."
Tony stood uncomfortably in the doorway, not sure what else he was supposed to say.  Was he supposed to ask Steve if he had a nice time with his other Alpha? Just accept his new cuckold-hood, accept that he couldn't control his omega and Steve was going to do whatever he wanted, and in the meantime, Tony wasn't even allowed to check out pretty women?
After Tony's rather moving pep talk Steve had moved to flatten the collar of his jacket down, a lump in his throat threatening to form from emotion.
"We know," Steve said, with startling optimism in contrast to when they'd been after Donner. But he didn't feel wholly responsible for Charles like he had Donner. He looked excited. The cucumbers had fallen down into his lap.
He had a vivid, disjointed, slightly unsettling dream that he didn't quite remember when he woke up the next morning.  Sunlight was streaming through the high windows and the heavy white curtains. Steve was lying partially on top of him, his body heavy and warm, his breathing even; his penis was lying flaccid against Tony's thigh and one hand was curled over the arc reactor.  He was naked except for the collar.
"Since always.  He wears a hearing aid.  It's like a cochlear implant thing.  But it was SHIELD property and since we're on unpaid leave, they took it.  I mean, it's fine, he's pretty good at reading lips."
Pepper ignored him.  Steve looked confused, so she added, by way of explanation, "Status Alliance doesn't allow Alphas or betas to join.  It's omegas only."
"Congratulations!" Phil said quickly. "Listen, Steve. He's going to try and say that he was justified because of that phone call--"
Tony looked up; Steve was holding a case, the empty cuffs dangling from it.  At Steve's feet was a hand. A human hand, pale and limp, ending in a stump.
"I missed you, too.  More than just sexually," said Tony, adding in the last part quickly, clearly worried Steve might think he meant otherwise.
"T-Tony. What are you--" Steve went deadly quiet when Pepper answered and tried to ignore how good Tony's hand felt on his dick.
He waited until they were done thanking him and had left before turning to Steve.  "...I can tell it's bothering you," he said. "...let's go back to the hotel, okay?  It's loud here and I don't want to get any more drunk, I've got a good buzz going."
Steve was aware of nothing going on around him. He heard a lot of voices but he didn't take notice of much else. He reached blindly for Tony. Aria knelt down beside him and helped him find his Alpha's hand for him. He mumbled out a thank you.
"Right. Okay..." Steve slumped against the window in a strange kind of relief. It must have been a strange kind of dream. Had he been sleep walking? Or was he hallucinating now? Still, he found himself turning around to stare back outside. There was no one in sight. No one at all. But Steve still couldn't shake the creepy notion that someone was... watching.  That somehow, there was a lingering connection between reality and his dream.  It made him feel tainted, somehow, and he found himself grateful that Tony had not been present to witness him zoning out.
Agent May had disappeared briefly and returned with the shield. She offered Steve a small smile, one reserved only for friends, holding up the shield as she jogged after them.
When Steve had rinsed him, he glanced down to click his arc reactor out of the base plate, curious to see how it was holding up.
a heat. Which you can't do if every omega in that annex was essentially in pr or post-heat... or just plain heat. They can't consent properly."
"You clearly have not seen me around my friends," slurred Tony, pushing Justin out of his mind.  "If your friends were all supermodels and shit, you'd slap about ten asses a day.  ...what's your deal with
He was pretty sure he heard Gideon laugh. Steve tried to get but the hand on his neck kept him down. He trembled. His heat was coming on already.
"I kinda wish you hadn't just called for someone else to walk into this room now. That's about the goddamn sweetest thing anyone's ever said to me," Steve murmured, voice thick and longing. His body wanted to respond to all that praise- and not through words. But he wasn't about to risk someone walking whilst he was riding Tony's-
do, with Bucky trying to hold him back for his own good.  Now he could do it, safely, and Bucky was happy for him, because he knew Steve had hated the limitations his body placed on him.  Now he could keep the house and have whelps and do all the normal things a normal omega would, instead of lying in bed coughing all the time.
Tony lathered himself up with soap while he talked, doing it all awkwardly with his left hand.  "Anyway, he didn't take a new mate. The prince is still single. Don't know if he's an Alpha or a beta, but he's single.  Guess he hasn't found the right one yet. The only reason I know I've ever been in the same room as the king is because of the bodyguards.  They're all fucking
He knew an outsider might comment on the imbalance in the bedroom but after everything Tony had been through in Afghanistan....Steve didn't expect anything from him. He was just happy they got to enjoy each other as it was.
He hit the jets and caught himself, skimming over the surface of the ocean, the sun sparkling above him.
In the main cabin, Tony, like Steve, was overwhelmed with exhausted.  He didn't even finish his drink.  Tony passed out in the chair he was in and woke up to a slightly bumpy landing.
Damage control.  That was what they needed.  Tony was going to have to call Rhodes, call Pepper, call his press coordinator and his social media rep and make sure everyone was running a consistent story.
Tony looked up suddenly, unexpectedly.  His eyes were sharp and clear, like he'd just shaken himself out of a daydream.  "You don't know how it feels for me. Because you, being an omega, you don't have those kinds of pressures.  To be masculine enough or dominant enough or whatever. But for Alphas... it's like,
"Sounds good," Steve hummed as he flopped back onto the sofa opposite her. He stared up at the ceiling. He appreciated that Aria was younger. Pepper was in her thirties, but Aria was twenty-eight. They were supposedly at similar points in their lives. "Sorry you er...ended up spending Christmas here."
"Look at them, they look like they've bonded," said Natasha sweetly, her hand coming out to touch Clint's cheek automatically.
"No, she was the '62 'Vette me and my dad used to work on.  I was nine when he passed and my mother was beside herself. She betrothed me to a guy named Frank, but you couldn't go through with the bonding ceremony until you were seventeen.  Day before my birthday, I took Lola and never looked back. Still have her."
He pulled out of the kiss, breathless, and flipped Steve around.  Steve was utterly compliant, putty in his hands. He bend him over the countertop, pressing his chest down into Steve's back, sliding his hands up Steve's arms to find his wrists and pin him.  He bit the back of Steve's neck tenderly; his teeth fit into the scar there so perfectly. He noticed the bandage around Steve's neck but barely even remembered biting him earlier. He sort of liked the bandage, actually.  If you squinted right, it looked almost like a collar.
Tony looked over at Steve uncertainly, torn between desperately wanting to air out his neck and not wanting to give Maggie Frond any satisfaction.  He was starting to wonder whether they really wanted to sit in on this workshop or not. Maggie Frond looked like she wanted to make an example of Steve.  But Tony didn't want to walk away, like a coward. And also, he was genuinely worried about Donner and Piper. Piper was just a kid. And Donner... poor Donner seemed so cowed, yet Maggie and Gideon both spoke like Donner had once actually been a real person with an actual personality.
The imperative was so strong and so sudden it was like the Voice of God.  (Not that Tony believed in that stuff.)
More footsteps. The witch.  The asset was glad; once she put him to sleep he could get up, toss him over the soldier, and take him someplace warm.
The goggles gave them the edge once they were inside. All Steve and Natasha had to do was avoid the occasional flashlight to avoid being spotted. It almost too easy. But Steve knew they didn't have long; some of the guards were almost certainly Alphas and if he lingered too long they would smell him. "Moving into position by the staircase," Steve told Sam softly through the comms. He shared a look with Natasha and a short nod. "Ready when you are Wilson."
"Yes, indeedy.  Our second, my third," said Harry.  "My wife's been ecstatic about it; she wanted another baby in the house for a while.  I'm absolutely
There was a shaky intake of breath on the other line, then Clint said, with a sort of forced optimism, "That's how come I learned lip-reading.  Without Barney I couldn't sign anymore. He was the only one who understood me.  After they took him away no one could talk to me, and I couldn't talk to anyone else, either.  Being mute for three years, it's a hell of a thing, Steve. ...anyway, I... I tried to find him, but even with SHIELD... we weren't ever able to track him down.  I know he changed hands a few times but the trail run cold. And if there's one thing you oughta know about Barney, it's that he was a fighter, like you. He'd never give up. If he was alive, he would have come and found me." Clint voice cracked.  "...he was just like you, Steve. He said to me-- he said,
Tony was standing in the middle of his demolished shop, gazing down lovingly at Steve; Steve was kneeling in front of his, one cheek against Tony's leg, hands behind his back while Tony carded his hair with his fingers.
"--yeah, and I said I was sorry, okay?  SHIELD wants to recruit you but there were questions regarding your stabili--"
.  With-- with his back straight and-- and his hands-- it's the right position.  It didn't look right. He was-- the way he was kneeling-- it was all wrong. I could feel it, feel his panic, I-- I didn't get there soon enough, he was touching his neck, he-- he was rubbing him, right here--" Tony pointed to a spot behind his ear.
"Listen... I'm not going to make you do anything you don't want to," said Rhodey.  "We're going to hand Gene Bennet a half a million for you, and then whatever you do next is up to you.  You can stay here and let them whore you out like this. You can tell them that this was a set-up and they'll probably be more careful in the future.  I can't force you to come with me. But if you come with me I can make sure that you're safe. I can make sure no one else lays a finger on you."
"I'm just cleaning up!" she called back, sounding tetchy as she was washing the blood from her hands.
When Steve woke the next day Tony was still asleep beside him. He grabbed his phone, replying to Ty, Natasha and Aria in thanks for their support and understanding.  He knew it looked bad, being at this conference, but he was also confident that everyone would realize he was trying to sabotage it by the end.
"Come on," Steve whispered and took Tony's hand. He threatens their fingers together and gently tugged him along towards the upstairs bedroom. He squeezed his hand gently, running his fingers over the bumps of Tony's knuckles. He helped him walk up the stairs but didn't carry him. He didn't think Tony could take that right now.
He rolled over and gagged.  He was going to puke. Steve's words about not drinking before the simulation suddenly made a fuckton of sense.
"So, did you find you sometimes had trouble connecting...because of Steve coming from a different era? After all, bonding and relationships in general were viewed very differently back then," Boswell said.
He watched the dip and rise of Tony's shoulder as he rummaged in the suitcase and produced the sleek black box.
Two hours after Steve's first text, Pepper got another one from Steve's 'new' number. She looked up quickly; Aria and Happy were one the other side of the room sipping on coffee. "Steve just texted. He wants to come see Tony, without an audience. He's asked us to give them space. He'll be here in twenty."
.  As if there was nothing more important than an omega who could keep house and have kids."  Bucky's voice was surprisingly bitter and heartfelt. Pietro didn't speak, unwilling to break the spell; it was rare for Bucky to speak this lucidly about his past.  "...as if I couldn't love him, even though he was sick and small. Yeah, he wasn't perfect. No one's perfect. That's not why I did it, to have kids or anything like that.  I knew he couldn't. I knew he was always gonna be sick. I did it 'cause I loved him. And he loved me. And maybe I was a fool for thinking it, but... whenever I came home and I saw him smile, I always thought that that was enough."  Bucky looked back up at the television, where Steve was smiling; they were replaying the final clip from his video.
"So you're saying the ends justify the means?  That the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few?  Those are all lines I used to use," interrupted Tony.
Tony cocked his head, then looked at Steve.  "You know what? I have no idea how Clint ended up with SHIELD, actually."
"That was my intention," Steve said as they stepped into the elevator. There was no point in lying, after all. Mike laughed but the sound was empty.
Still, he was running through a mental Rolodex of people he could ask, just in case Rhodey said no.  The problem was that, while Tony knew lots of people, there were few he trusted, and few he had confidence in.  His list of friends was short and this was a delicate situation.
He realised he'd been so lost in his own thoughts he'd stood still on the street. People were moving around him, giving him concerned and funny looks. Steve frowned. And then he saw a car turning the corner and he just... he just
"I would prefer it if I didn't have to be involved in the process," Steve hummed, glancing down. "It was quite stressful."
Since Bucky had gone into cryo, Tony had felt none of the other man's presence, and he was thankful for it.  The idea of being with an Alpha man made his skin crawl and made his mind go to a dark place, back to that cave in Afghanistan, where he'd been called a spade and treated like one.  Those were memories he preferred to keep stored very, very, very deep.
Clint was stood the other side of Tony, watching Sitwell as well. "I think we can break him in an hour. Offer him a deal and he'll tell us everything."
Steve went back upstairs. He just grabbed a dressing gown and sat by Tony's bedside, stroking through his hair gently as he slept before he reached for the phone. He ordered them a proper breakfast, with waffles and everything, hoping Tony would manage to eat some of it.
Having heard nothing from Dr. Gleason, Tony had decided he should probably go get that vasectomy.  It could be his Christmas present to himself.
Although, okay, Bucky did totally spoil him a little bit. No arguments there, but that was only because he felt guilty for bringing girls home.
"That's a good idea," Steve affirmed. "But Jesus...that means we have a lot of orchids. I thought maybe the old tradition would have died out by now...or maybe it's because I'm old. I don't know," he mused, turning his head as his gaze flitted around the room. "Rich people really will buy anything, won't they?"
"Oh my God," Steve whispered. "He's alive." He knew one thing, if there was a chance that Clint's brother was alive then he would be. If he was anything like Clint, then there was no doubt. Everything they'd endured...
About ten minutes later Gleason appeared with a plate full of sandwiches, looking a little sheepish, but not awkward, as he walked over. The sandwiches were mostly cheese and pickle with some thin slices of meat in them. He set them down on a table a safe distance away from the ruined sofa.
After their week of business it was time to face the conference. Steve knew that Tony had bought collars (although be hadn't actually seen them yet) and he'd gotten a new suit with Aria while shopping in New York. They were taking the private plane again and it was a longer journey than usual. Steve was oddly excited yet nervous; it was a similar kind of buzz he'd get going into battle. Which felt oddly fitting.
"Well, wonderful. Then we can talk about it with him too and deal with this. Because this is real and because of the bond you are
He eventually gave up completely; Aria said his awkwardness was charming and people would probably love him no matter how terrible his acting was.
Natasha let the conversation, but gave Steve a look of sympathy.  Tony's derision toward omegas was clearly based on jealousy.  For all of Tony's posturing, it was obvious that he had been desperate for paternal attention, and that he'd failed to get it.
On the third day of his heat it already felt like it was over. Steve had feeling the next day he would be free from it already. He didn't think about Gideon, or rather, he decided not to. But then that evening they got a call. To Steve's surprise, it was Nick delivering the bad news personally.
She couldn't have been older than ten. She was an omega, dressed in the same uniform the other kids had worn. The girl must have presented early to end up at the camp so young. She was clutching a teddy that looked like Tigger from Winnie the Pooh and was sucking on one of its ear, her eyes wide and timid. She waddled into the tent, keeping away from the sick. And then plopped down on the ground, ducking her head to see Tony on the floor.
The doctor blinked in alarm when they entered the bedroom and he saw the bloody sheets. "Most of its from my leg," Steve tried to reassure him even though he wasn't honestly sure if it was. He just hoped it was. "Should I just...?" He felt awkward all of a sudden.
Happy was waiting at the curb; Tony opened the door for Steve, pushed him in, and slid after him, slamming the door in the face of a TMZ reporter.
"I can't deal with this roller-coaster with you. Suddenly you care, then suddenly you ignore me for two months and kick me out of my own home."
He fell into a heavy, dreamless sleep, splayed out over Steve, his cheek pressed against his back, inhaling the smell that had been lost and had finally,
It had been a tearful reunion which mainly consisted of Aria pulling Steve into the tightest hug and letting out a stream of expletives telling him to never ignore her texts again. It had been pretty similar to his reunion with Pepper, although that had involved far less swearing.
"Not a conventional dad, yeah, I get it. You're not asking Tony to have kids now, you just want him to understand that there could be a possibility for it. Whatever."
. You act like I did this on purpose but do you seriously think I would have done this to you if I'd known the truth? I spent the last months of my life thinking I wasn't even mated anymore. And it was shit. It was the most degrading thing I've ever experienced in my entire life.  And maybe, okay, I didn't deserve a second chance. But I wanted one. I thought I was dead and then I wasn't and then you came along and you wanted me and I thought that maybe, after everything, I could finally have what I always dreamed of...but then no. Bucky has to come and fuck it up again. Because he won't let me go...and do you think I'm
Tony sat up sleepily, blinking.  "Oh my God, is Donner having the baby?  He's not due for another month." Donner, as slender and small as he was, had begun to resemble a caricature of a pregnant omega.  His features had softened from the hormones, his face becoming more delicate and feminine. He hadn't gained a significant amount of weight except for the baby itself; it looked like he had crammed a basketball under his shirt.  He informed everyone that pregnancy was no longer fun; he felt sore and bloated and had to pee constantly and his feet kept swelling.
" he yelled, still trying to lunge at Brennan, the only one he was currently capable of recognizing as a threat.  The rest of the people in the room were either betas or omegas.
The song ended and the music went back to the poppy stuff it had been before. A few of the omegas in the crowd jumped up onto a table to dance.
"...this healed good," he said with a tone of forced casualness, then added, "If you can stand sleeping with a guy who had a flashlight in his chest then I'm pretty sure I can get over one little scar."  He paused, then added glibly, "
"I'm really sorry," Steve said, trying not to stammer. "I don't know your name?"  He liked red lipstick.  You didn't see a lot of it in this century but he'd always liked it, the way it plumped up a woman's lips.
In the omega pen, everyone looked over at Steve with some interest.  Just as the Alphas had warmed to Tony during the previous night, many of the omegas seemed less wary of Steve today.  DeSoto, of course, immediately broke away from him to speak to someone else. There were still plenty of people here who thought he was a dangerous radical and turned away from him quickly, as if his radical ideas about being equal to his Alpha were embarrassing or contagious.
"This isn't a date?" Steve felt himself panic. Dating was normal now, for everyone, right?  Natasha had told him so. Clint even explained the 'three date rule.' Ha. That was out the window.
was what Steve wanted to say. But instead he settled with: "They say opposites attract, don't they? Besides, I think we have more in common than people think."
Inevitably, when he noticed the difference, he thought of Banksy and Boswell.  Banksy, who was his age, and Boswell, old enough to be his father, who had to turn in early from parties and who was retired and who had an adult son who was closer in age to Banksy than to Boswell.  (Ryan and Banksy were within two years of each other.)
Only the omega, who had hopped up onto the lab counter and was now sitting there swinging his legs, seemed not to mind her at all.  He was wearing track pants and a long-sleeved shirt and chewing gum. He also seemed surprisingly bored and relaxed. And he was young, too.  He didn't know who these people were or why everyone was putting up with their disrespectful, childish attitudes.
Tony mouthed Steve's neck, teeth grazing the skin.  "Off," he commanded, yanking at Steve's clothes. His heart was still throbbing and he felt a sort of... desperation.  There was no passion or love here. Just a primal urge that he couldn't get under control, mixed with an urgency that came from fear, because his throat was still swollen with terror and his gut still twisted, but Steve's scent was hypnotic.  And it didn't help that he could smell Phil, too. Both omegas were wet and Tony was partially hard, grinding against Steve even as he clung to him.
"Home gym sounds useful," Steve hummed absent-mindedly as he buttoned up his dark blue shirt. It was soft cotton and wore over dark jeans. Casual but presentable.
"Well, I can't really buy you anything. So I thought I'd give you an...experience," Steve said with an easy kind of smile. He tilted his head into Tony's touch, admittedly enjoying being sprawled over naked on top of him. He had first got the idea when Clint made a joke about Phil probably dressing up as Cap in the bedroom. He hadn't quite meant it the way Steve had done it with Tony but...it had certainly been a success.
"Me neither," said Tony softly, hoarsely.  Remembering how he'd had to be physically restrained was embarrassing, to say the least.  If Happy and Pepper weren't there, he would have spent the whole flight trying to tear down the door to get to Steve.  He'd never lost his cool like that, especially not while sober.  "...but, like, us being scent-mates, that doesn't mean we
"Don't worry," said Tony, suddenly serious.  He traced patterns into Steve's chest idly with one finger.  "I wouldn't. I know how images are. ...can you fucking imagine if people saw me calling you a slut in bed?  We'd both probably get torn apart by our loving fanbases..."
"Not gonna--" Steve let out a quiet gasp. "--last long like this,” he warned him, head tilted back in the sand as his eyes rolled back too. He trembled underneath him, squirming in the sand, his cheeks flushing as he grew closer and closer. And Steve really didn't think he could last long like this, even if he wanted to. Tony's mouth was wet and warm and inviting. Steve let out another undignified sound and hummed, unaware and uncaring about anything else round him aside from Tony.
"We're going to do so much more to that couch than just get it sticky," said Tony, grinning, then paused.  "Actually, no, we're basically just going to get it sticky."
He pulled on the dark coloured gear, the night vision goggles sticking his hair up as he pushed them up to his forehead. Steve took a lot of weaponry (he had a tendency to throw stuff and then lose it). He took two knives at each hip, daggers at his wrists and then a pistol which he didn't really want to use but... Steve took it anyway.
"Hello, sir," said JARVIS pleasantly, unaware of what had transpired during the last few minutes.  He was bringing up everyone's stats, though, and Steve's were particularly interesting. His body temperature, always elevated, was elevated even more (39.3 C), along with his heart rate (115, which was high for Steve, whose resting heart rate was just under 40).  His blood pressure was up, too, and his breathing, and if Tony didn't know what was happening, he would have thought Steve had some sort of killer flu.
That's what it boiled down to, really.  Tony was entitled and always had been. His station, status, everything about him put him in a position where he got what he wanted, when he wanted.  Steve had been challenging that notion a lot lately. Actually, almost constantly. Steve had put a damper on his drinking and his partying and Tony hadn't slept with a woman since May.
"I'm pregnant," repeated Donner.  He didn't sound upset, just mildly surprised, like someone had told him his socks didn't match and he'd only just noticed.  He looked from Steve to Tony and back to Steve. "When... when do I have it?"
He found his way out of the compound; if anyone followed him, he wasn't aware of it; if anyone tried to talk to him, he didn't respond. His consciousness had buried itself deep into a mental vault and he didn't dare let it out- not yet. Not while he was still here and vulnerable. No, he had to leave first.  He had to get away. He got to his car, feeling dreamlike, and slipped into the leather seat of the Aston, listening to his own steady breathing like it was someone else's, his body moving like it was a puppet on strings.  He felt far away, like he was watching himself from a distance.
Fury turned around in his seat.  "I'm going to get out first, go left.  Carter.  You go right.  Cover Rogers.  Rogers, you..."  He reached out and put a hand on Steve's shoulder.  "...you get to that dinner.  Got it?"
"I'm-- I'm going to die," he announced, shaking uncontrollably.  His chest was searing with pain.  "I'm going to die!" he repeated, voice higher.  "Oh God, I'm going to die, I'm going to die, oh God--"  His panic was making the pain worse.  It was excruciating; he wanted to vomit; there was the smell of something burning, something meaty, something that made his mouth water.  Tony realized it was coming from him and his stomach flipped; he squeezed his eyes shut tighter, shuddering, wrapped around the car battery, the one whose wires disappeared into the stained bandage around his chest.
With a lot of huffing they got Steve up the stairs. He could sort of walk himself, but Mac had to tug Steve's arm over his shoulders in order to get him up to the bedroom. Tiberius carried Tony up with Happy, and then they left the mated pair in their room whilst a significant group of people congregated downstairs.
"Answer," Steve called back, setting the running machine to a lower pace so he could speak to her properly without sounding breathless. He kept it at a  fast pace walk but nothing more.
"This is a fucking mess," he declared after a moment.  "Rogers, get me some scotch, I can't... I can't do this.
Tony laughed softly at the sound of his name.  "Steve," he murmured back, drawing out the long "e," wiggling his hips into the other's.  Steve's arms and legs were tangled around him, drawing him in, and he could feel his body tensing, toes and fingers curling with pleasure.  It was hard to tell where, exactly, he ended and Steve began, but that didn't matter.  Steve's body was warm and wet and tight, but his fingers in Tony's hair were soft and sweet and gentle.
A shiver ran down Steve's spine as Tony's fingers curled through his hair and wordlessly guided him to where he wanted him to be. The fact that he didn't even have to say it just turned Steve on even more. His cheeks were still pink, but had died on a little. They would soon fix that.
His heart was pounding but he was struggling not to be anxious; he could smell Steve's response, Steve was panicking because he was panicking... he had to be strong for Steve.  Steve's murmured comforts were helping.
He squinted against the sun; Yemen was a desert and it resembled Kunar far, far too closely for his taste.
He went back in to his room.  He grabbed a drink from the minibar in his room, chugging it instead of sipping.  He needed the courage.
"I consider it irresponsible not to take a week off.  I wouldn't want to burn myself out.  Saving the world, it's, you know, kind of a high-stress job," said Tony, shouldering through the crowd.  He threw up a hand to wave to Pepper; she was climbing out of an SUV about ten meters away.  The two of them gravitated toward each other and made their way toward the clubhouse; they exchanged a kiss on the cheek and the reporters went absolutely crazy.
Maria handed Tony a magazine.  On the glossy cover was a picture of Tony kneeling in front of Steve, putting the band on his finger.  Tony flipped it open. "
"If SHIELD knows all my dirty little secrets, then it knows that I've slept with over a thousand women and I have, to date, zero children," said Tony, refusing to be upset.
When he got to the lobby, Tony lost his followers; the police took over, and the omegas drifted away from him.  He sighed heavily and turned to talk to Steve only to discover he was missing.
"Oh... ohh yeah... that feels good, Steve," he groaned, closing his eyes and putting his hands behind his head.  He rolled his hips upwards with relief. Steve's arousal had gotten him erect to a painful degree and having his cock milked had to be the most satisfying feeling in the world.  "Here... here it comes.. sit on it, omega, take it like a good boy..." grunted Tony, reaching forward to grab Steve's hips. He arched, twitching with a gasp at the sudden release.
He turned and left without another word.  Natasha and Coulson watched him go, then exchanged a look.  The unfortunate truth is that the Avengers Initiative had been under a lot of scrutiny ever since Clint had gone to assassinate Natasha and come back with her.  It had looked bad for them.  People questioned how effective an integrated team would be, when push came to shove. Having two pair-bonds within the team looked even worse.  There was no denying that.
Justin was nearly slapping the other omega off him; Jack was offering him help just like Steve was offering Tony, and Justin was clearly not willing to have his pride wounded by accepting it.
"Good, good idea..." Steve hummed, but he was already way ahead of him as he leaned his forehead against the car window and let his eyes slowly slip shut.
Clint sounded like he'd just woken up when he answered. "Why are you doing this to me?" he grunted. "Oh-- and happy birthday."
If you wanted to be Freudian about it, he suspected you could blame his parents, and especially his father, because the Stark household hadn't been an overly friendly one; they didn't hug, didn't tell each other they loved one another, didn't do family vacations or even really family activities.  Howard was too busy working, and Maria was too busy with her charities, and Tony preferred to be left alone so that he could destroy various electronics.
Tony had probably fucked up bigger before, though he couldn't remember it now.  He felt numb.  He knew of only one solution to these things.
In the parking garage, Tony was sitting on the back of a car, swinging his legs and eating a sandwich.  Tony was wearing what appeared to be a grey fleece onesie, the hood pulled up; the hood had an overly cutesy face printed on it and Steve realized it was a squirrel costume.
"Everyone's is," Steve replied quietly. "I think that's half the point. They've already seen the best of you, then want to see the worst too."
"I do believe you're capable of getting your own coffee, Tony," Ty breathed, his gaze darkening a fraction. This was an omega rights discussion; an Alpha wasn't welcome, certainly not within the first five minutes of it.
"Right," Steve said and forced a smile to reassure her. But a strange sense of doubt still niggled at the back of his mind. To people like Howard, he'd never really been more than a bit of fun. He was the amusing, uppity omega who didn't do what he was told and he probably became all the more fun when he was a lab rat too.
Steve watched with both wonder and concern as the suit slowly, slowly began to unlock its plates and open up.  "...how long's this gonna take?" he asked after a minute of mechanized whirring.
"Is that why you're angry?  You lost a whelp?" He wasn't sure why he was being blamed for that.  He was even more confused because the omega had just insisted he didn't want to be mated at all, but now he was complaining about miscarrying.
Come to think of it, Tony's whole body was a train wreck.  The small, circular scar on the back of his neck, the one that matched those on his arms and shoulders and back; faint criss-crossings on his sides and back and chest; the uncomfortable pop-crunch his right shoulder had done ever since he dislocated it in Afghanistan...
Steve dropped the case at the foot of the bed; the handcuffs that were still attached clacked against it.
Hearing him finally acknowledge her as a person mellowed her out a little.  Some of the tension went out of her shoulders, but she didn't move from her position.
"I wouldn't dream of it," said Tony softly as Steve bent over the mattress, sticking his ass invitingly in the air.  He put his hands on Steve's hips and pressed the head of his cock against Steve's backside, feeling the other arch and writhe eagerly.  As much as Tony missed women (he missed them a lot), he had to admit that Steve's body was a perfect fit for him and that Steve was not only responsive but had an outrageous sex drive.  Maybe it was the serum. Steve didn't tire out and he was nearly always ready to go, which suited Tony fine and was one of the primary reasons he hadn't pushed the trio thing.
Natasha pushed a second glass of water into Steve's hands. "Don't worry about the vomit," she softly. "I've got it. Both of you should get to bed..."
them to attack you." Steve said, his voice still a little thick with emotion. "I just want them to leave us alone and stop trying to undermine us at every goddamn turn. It will upset you if they think we're in a trio so it will upset me, okay? I'm tough as nails regardless of the Alphas in my life. I fought Nazis! I don't need anything else to convince them."
neither of them would ever be allowed to forget. Steve sighed, louder this time. "I'm sorry Tony. And don't say it's not my fault. I don't mean it is. I'm just...sorry. That's all," he murmured and his gaze dropped down to the floor.  "Does it-- does it bother you?"
"I met the president twice, you know. Back in the day. Not now, obviously," Steve murmured. "The first time was before I went to overseas. I was so honored and excited. Not a lot of omegas got to meet the goddamn president... I was like a child.  But then when we got there, they just wanted to show me off.  What the serum had done to me.  And he barely talked to me at all.  And when he did... he told me I'd make a brilliant Alpha. I didn't really know what he meant. I just told him that it wasn't really my style. He laughed, thought it was funny...and then he slapped my ass and went on his way. I didn't really know how to feel.  But the second time was different. I'd killed people, seen people die...I realised war wasn't what I thought it was. I'd learned that my status didn't mean shit out on the field," Steve whispered. "Mr. Roosevelt asked me how it was all going, and I told him. And then he tried to touch me again and I caught his wrist and just said: 'Don't.'  And then I walked away. I was shaking, I was so hyper. I couldn't believe I'd just done that."
"Hey, it's like forty minutes to the airport from here. Maybe try and grab a rest?" Happy suggestively tentatively.
"...don't you ever wear pants?" asked Aria, sounding grossed out, covering her eyes.  Tony was still in nothing but a heavy apron, his welding goggles pushed back onto his head.
"Mr. Stark, with all due respect, it's not your call," said Coulson.  Tony wanted to smack the smug little omega right out of his chair.
to go out there?  You're Tony fucking Stark, isn't what you always say?  You're invincible.  You're just giving up on your pair-bond?  ...Tony?"
Agent Carter lifted a pair of wire cutters with a grin and Hawley sighed. "I already said those weren't necessary."
"Thank you doctor," Steve stood and shook his hand. He didn't even wobble. He looked far better out of his uniform and no longer covered in blood.
He sat up to clutch his hand, eyes watering against the stabs of agony traveling up his arm.  "Fuck... oh, fuck... I'm fine, don't..." Steve's face was shining with concern and he was at Tony's side, clearly bent on helping him.  Tony got up unsteadily on his own. "...I'm fine... shit... well, that was a wake-up call... can you help me with shaving and stuff?" he asked plaintively, still clinging to his right hand.  "...by 'and stuff,' I mean jacking off, obviously... I'm kidding, I use my left hand for that... still, you can help." He forced a cheeky grin. He could tell Steve wasn't fooled.
"So...your favourite movie?" Steve asked, tilting his head at him. "And nothing scary this time," he added. "Your movies still look
His right arm was throbbing with the effort of keeping Bucky's metal arm away. Steve kicked at him with his still working foot. He was shaking. "Bucky," he whispered. "Bucky please.  You said you wouldn't hurt me, remember? You were scared of hurting me. This is going to hurt me a lot.
, and also, ever since he'd hired Pepper, she'd been screening them, getting a driver's license.  (Tony's earlier system involved going "You eighteen?" while putting on a condom.)
"Okay," Steve breathed. It was only fair. Tony had seen him kill people before...now it was his turn to watch. Although Tony wouldn't be killing anyone. It seemed DeSoto's own alpha was capable of doing a good job of that himself. Steve felt so sorry for him and it sort of felt like Steve had failed to...because if he had really gotten through to DeSoto, they wouldn't have to be doing this.
Tony would bet dollars to donuts that Howard thought the idea of injecting a sickly omega with the serum was utterly hilarious.  Also, Howard had a flair for the dramatic, and there was no doubt that the change had been flooring; if you started with less impressive materials to begin with, then the resulting product would look better by comparison.
"Oh, good for them, then.  Well, here's to friendship!" said Arcadia, holding up her drink for Steve to tap.  She threw back her drink; so did everyone else.
"You're Christian. Or you were. It's different for you," Aria pointed out and took another sip from her own macchiato.
Steve was right.  If Lab 9 had proved anything, it was that HYDRA was the one that lacked boundaries, not SHIELD. They used chemical weapons and experimented on living people.  SHIELD wasn't without its problems, but it had principles. Case in point: they'd appointed an omega as captain of the Avengers Initiative. HYDRA couldn't be reasoned with, so it had to be eliminated.  Sometimes it would get messy, yeah. But Tony felt that Steve's judgement was better than his and... well, if Steve thought it was okay...
Steve grunted and arced up as Tony pushed inside. He was bigger than he remembered, or so Steve thought, in that moment. He clenched around him tightly and curled his arms around Tony's shoulders, drawing him in closer. "F-fuck..."
"Listen, maybe Steve's just browsing a farmer's market or something," said Phil reasonably.  "You know how bad he is at charging his phone. Don't you think maybe you're over-reacting?"
Donner shook his head, staring down at the bottle in his hands. "They're very angry at him," he whispered. "He doesn't understand how it works.  but it's not his fault."
Aria was finishing off another cigarette by the hotel entrance when she saw Tony walking in, his sunglasses hiding all discernible emotion.
Tony wasn't sure what prompted the following act of incredible stupid bravery, but he picked up a sheet of metal that had fallen off the car in front of him, stepped up behind the man, and swung it as hard as he could at the other's head.
DeSoto nodded his head against Tony's leg, his fingers reaching up to caress the fabric of Tony's slacks.  Again, Tony resisted the urge to slap him away.
Tony had already noted where the kitchen was.  Actually he was interested in raiding the fridge.  But he didn't want to seem like he wasn't taking this seriously.
Steve managed to make out some kind of light in front of him, supposedly the exit. He set down his basket on the floor, feeling bad, but he couldn't walk out without paying. He walked into someone. "Sorry! Sorry!" And then stumbled out onto the street. He still couldn't really see, and, God, he was
"No-- I mean, yes!  The garage, Tony's shop, it's-- it's the safest place in the house," said Pepper, wringing her hands.
It was all wrong.  Terribly wrong.  Her skin was like ash in his mouth and he spat it out instantly, automatically.  His body rejected it even before his brain could.  This was not his omega.
"Right, come on, let's go," Steve said and headed for the door. DeSoto looked back to the bedroom, still confused.
Tony considered this for a moment.  "...yeah," he admitted.  "You know what?  Steve never lied to me.  He wasn't really undercover.  He was just himself, and I was so fucking prejudiced-- excuse my language, Mrs. First Lady-- that all I saw was an omega.  I didn't ever realize that he was Captain America, standing right there in front of me.  And Steve is a humble guy, and he never mentioned it, and it never came up, and I treated him like shit for weeks.  That's how deep status bias can run.  But it turned out better that way because I got to know Steve as a real person, not as some national symbol.  And once I started seeing him like that, as a person... I realized what a big asshole I was and how prejudiced I was and... I'm real lucky he showed up to set me straight," he finished, rubbing his thumb over Steve's hand under the table.
Tony nodded numbly, rose, and followed her out onto the back deck.  Inside, Mackenzie shook his head slowly. "No offense to your mate, Rogers, but how the hell did he get approved for action?  He's an emotional wreck."
When Tony told Steve that he wasn't going anywhere, there was a weird sensation in his chest, something like hope. His fingers tingled when Tony kissed his hand and Steve's brow furrowed a little in thought. Then, wordlessly, he entangled their fingers and pulled him up onto the bed.
"Your friend is the reason I'm here. Your friend knows what these people are and what they do and he was still willing to put me here," Steve said voice even as he met Bucky's gaze. He didn't move from where he was leant against the wall, his foot hurt too much. He looked at Bucky with a challenging look in his eye. The same kind of look he'd held when he used to watch Bucky go out for the night, knowing he would bring someone home; it was a look of disappointment and disapproval.
"Hey. Tony. Breathe." Steve put his hands on his shoulders and squeezed lightly, standing in front of him as they paused by the door to Tony's workshop and garage. He leaned forward to kiss his forehead. "You've got this. I know you do. You have nothing to prove to me; you've just got to show them how awesome I already know you are."
"Literally... nothing..." he gasped, still leaning over, spitting occasionally.  "Dunno how often they go into heat or how long or nothing... never been with one in heat, either... ever... never wanted to... don't wanna... don't wanna feel anything... can't... oh, my God, I think maybe I might be a little drunk."  He spat again, stomach twisting and coiling inside him.
"...where do the bad omegas go, though?" asked Tony suddenly.  "I don't think any of these guys are capable of murder, either.  They're a bunch of stiff, rich suits. If they wanted someone killed, they would hire someone else to do it, right?  ...but if they don't off them, what do you think happens to them? They can't just put 'em back into auction, not if they already have a mark on their neck and a history of being noncompliant."
The possibility that they were scent-mates lingered and it bothered Tony.  It seemed like a crack in his intellectualism.  A primal marring on his otherwise flawlessly evolved brain.
Tony set down his razor and rubbed his face, wanting a nap.  The drive from the SHIELD base to home hadn't been too bad; Happy had filled a lot of the silence, chatting pleasantly with Steve.  The hardest part had been when they came to the house. There was a crowd outside the gates of Stark mansion, so many that they spilled onto the PCH and had caused a pretty bad traffic jam.  The crowd was probably three-quarters reporters, wielding cameras and microphones. The other twenty-five percent were supporters. Some had opted for a pleasant "WELCOME BACK, CAP!" message, or "WE
Steve half opened his eyes as a water bottle was pushed into his hands, its surface cold. He grunted and brought the water bottle to his lips, drinking greedily. He sighed and let his eyes slip shut as he water slipped down his throat. He crushed the bottle when he was done and dropped it on the floor. "That's-- that's a lot of money," he said, blinking slowly.
"Excellent timing.  Right before Steve's speech," said Pepper, voice dripping with venom.  "You couldn't just
"You think we're the bad guys, don't you?  You're the protagonist of this little story.  Life isn't a fairy tale, Captain. Life doesn't have heroes, or villains.  Life doesn't care about you or your story. Let me tell you about our story.  We were alone. We were hungry, and cold, and scared. HYDRA took us in. They did the same for James.  And now we're offering you the same opportunity. Has SHIELD really been so kind to you? Hm? Of course I know your history; HYDRA was your enemy, seventy years ago.  But what do you know about what it does now? It was the only place that took in Pietro and I." She gave a nod to her brother.
They trailed after him like ducklings as they made their way back to the lobby.  Steve was having a hushed conversation with Banjo; Tony was still trying and failing to feel at all like he was helping.  He was used to people basking in his brilliance, but here, aside from being a natural Alpha, no one seemed to appreciate he was Tony goddamn Stark.  Even the staff kept glancing over at Steve in his uniform.
Steve met Fury's gaze with the upmost contempt possible, blue eyes fiery. Steve might have been scared and confused, but he would never back down from a fight and God help him if he was going to let Fury feel like he was winning here. Steve thought about the things he'd seen, things he'd felt and smelled. Bucky smelled like the ashes of fire, an inviting type of heat. It was
The soldier rubbed the back of his neck and then looked over at the blond.  The omega looked and smelled anxious. Despite that, he was exceedingly attractive and the soldier felt drawn to him.
"I think it's very clear where me and Tony are standing and that's with each other," Steve said simply. "Next question?"
Aria had said nothing; she watched Tony's forced calm with a hint of a frown gracing her features.  Pepper mouthed
Fury was lying in the hospital bed.  In a blue hospital gown instead of his usual long, black coat, he looked... different.  Yet still quite imposing.  He had refused to take off his eye patch.
Steve knew that a part of him would always feel lonely. That was unavoidable. A part of him was stuck in a time passed with no one who understood it with him. Steve felt less alone in the 21st century however. Now he had Tony.
Steve's lips tingled. The shape of Bucky's mouth was familiar to him but this was different. He shivered as Bucky's tongue nudged against his own and soon his thoughts went offline and the kiss was deepening to a point he hadn't anticipated. "Bucky. Buck-" Steve's cheeks were a little flushed and he was a little breathless. He couldn't speak because Bucky was kissing him again. He eventually pushed him away with the hand on his chest.
"I didn't lie.  After Howard gave him the serum, the mark was gone," he said rapidly, not wanting to get slapped again.  His teeth were too sensitive from the recent surgeries Dr. Liebmann had performed.  "It was gone and we-- we never talked about it.  He kept callin' me-- kept callin' me Barnes instead of Bucky and I didn't think he wanted the other boys to know, 'cause he was the captain, and all he'd ever wanted was to join the army and be-- be treated like an Alpha, I told you, he was real head-strong, and I figured he didn't want me to call attention to him bein' a horseshoe, and he was so mad at me 'cause I'd never mated him, but I couldn't, see?  I
The days passed quickly. Aria sorted out music for the party (she was keeping it a surprise) and Tony seemed to be busying himself with the rest of it. Steve did a lot of sleeping and a lot of drawing but none of it on his walls. He kept the drawings in one of his sketch books. Some of them were personal.
Steve took Tony's hand and gripped tight as they went up in the elevator together to the offices of Project 84. He didn't think they'd ever felt so responsible, collectively, for something so truly out of their control. It wasn't their fault Donner looked like Steve, or that Malick was an asshole, but they had ultimately set in course the events that led to their bond being severed.
"So.  We need to get my dad's notes from HQ," said Tony, trying to distract himself from the needle.
Tony leaned in and slipped the collar around his throat.  He hesitated for a split second before fastening it; the click of the lock seemed loud in the silent bedroom.
The words were gone.  Tony was struggling to breathe.  He could not fucking do this.  Everything had been perfect and then,
"Well... she's mad about how I've been... acting like a dick lately," said Tony.  "Seemed surprised I pair-bonded.  ...frankly, I'm surprised, too.  Commitment isn't really my style."  He shrugged one shoulder.  "We didn't talk for long.  I just kind of filled her in and then hung up.  She probably needs time to process it, anyway."  Tony looked down at his mug.  "Her and I... we're real different.  But she's been... I dunno.  More than an assistant or a friend, Steve.  She's... she's kind of been my anchor.  I need someone to rein me in.  You might have noticed but I'm not the most stable of individuals."  He looked up.  "We'll see her tomorrow... at the Expo.  ...for what it's worth, she's all about omega rights.  Always has been.  Surprisingly socially progressive, that one."
Steve could feel something was wrong but he didn't question it. He kept their fingers threaded lightly together, leading the way out of the museum for Tony. They said polite goodbyes and exchanged thank yous with the reception on the way out.
"Maybe," said Natasha.  "If that's what they're doing then they have no idea what they're up against."  She gave Steve a gentle smile and put a hand on his arm. "You can't let them get to you."
" he yelled.  He cleared his throat and pretended to adjust his tie, though he wasn't wearing one and of course Francine couldn't see him.  "Pardon me, I'm sorry, excuse my outburst, I just-- I want what's best for little Kerry and I'm in over my head. Can't you give me a referral, at least?  Surely there's an institution that would help her find a mate? She's very obedient."
"A flight?" he echoed and it took him a moment to process that that meant in the suit and not in a plane. It made sense. Tony had been working almost non-stop. "And it went okay?" he asked, and leaned against one of the benches, cheeks still a little pink from his sprint back (and that had been a
Boswell Mackabee strolled into the room trailed a dozen people.  He was dressed in one of his usual dour suits, a dark grey pinstripe with a dark burgundy tie.  He held a glass of scotch in one hand. And Tony was surprised to discover that, although he was just as tall as Tony had imagined, he was not the overly dominating Alpha Tony would have assumed.  He, like Tony, didn't exude dominance.
"We want a non-partisan, non-status press release.  I thought we were very clear about that during our meeting?" said Malick.
Bucky's growl broke off when he heard Steve's voice.  "Steve! You're okay? Who was that? Do you need me?"  Bucky's voice had a frantic note to it.
"I mean, you're no Howard Stark, but you'll still be a good addition to the team," added Fury.  "Howard never would have knelt."
Steve then reached up, put a hand on his shoulder and winced as he pushed it back. A horrible clicking sound filled the room and everyone who could hear it recoiled.
"I bet that's where Eric got Piper," said Tony quietly, squeezing Steve's hand, feeling sick.  "...that school."
"Thank, Jorge," said Tony.  "So what the hell are you planning, Steve?  Your text didn't exactly evoke a sense of peace... why would we have to leave suddenly?  You didn't arm them, did you?"
"I cannot wait for that generation to be behind us," commented Irshad as the Alphas strolled away. Steve hummed dryly.
"I got it." Holiday hunting would be a nice thing for Steve to get into. He needed something get his head out of that conference. He was still somewhat horrified by the whole experience. "Thanks Aria."
It took about ten minutes but eventually he was breathing normally. He shuddered against Tony in relief as the moment finally passed. It was embarrassing really, to be so vulnerable.
"D-don't call me--"  Steve's jaw clenched as one of Gideon's fingers jabbed into his scent gland, too hard.
Steve blinked and looked up at Bucky with wide eyes. He'd said that, before but not to Bucky.  To Tony.  What the hell? He stilled. His mind was racing. He couldn't think straight. He shook his head.
"I don't have a concussion and I don't need bedrest!" grumbled Tony.  "Gimme a math problem. C'mon. Pepper--"
Tiberius's nose wrinkled a little.  Even in Steve's time, there were lots of wives' tales about bonding and marriage.  June brides and bonds were considered lucky; if it rained on your bonding day, then your omega was going to be cursed with nothing but girls.  You were supposed to marry when the hands of a clock were going up and bond when the moon was waxing to ensure prosperity. If you bonding while it was waning, you'd be cursed to poverty.  "June brides" and "June omegas" were still enough of a fad for the vast majority of pairs to bond according to the tradition.
In the suit, Tony knelt by Steve; Steve reached up to put his hand on Tony's cheek. "I'm okay," he promised him. "Honestly." Sure there was some glass in his hand and two burns on his legs- but it was nothing major. Nothing Steve hadn't dealt with before.
"Hey, JARVIS, where's Steve?  I wanna brag about the amazing Spider-man trap I'm setting," he called.
"I will die. Or at least my dick will die. Please...don't," Steve said weakly, leaning his head back against the pillows. There was a pink flush on his cheeks that tinged his neck too.
"...I'll feel better in a day," muttered Tony quietly as the alcohol rocked him to sleep.  "Good night, omega. I love you."
Jed appeared with water and food. She pushed it along the floor to Steve then let the tent flaps back down, giving them some privacy. Steve grabbed one of the plastic cups and poured water out into it before offering it to Tony. "Here, you'll feel better."
The man in the suit glared at the man in the lab coat, and he knew that the man in the lab coat had asked a stupid question.
"...I don't argue with my mate 'cause we're bonded and I love him," said DeSoto patiently, as if Steve were a moron.  "I do it
. Oh my God, you're on right now. Just- go, get, it's fine," fussed Pepper, practically dragged everyone after Tony, leaving Justin to the stage.
"I didn't tell him. He has no idea. This isn't about what you think," Steve assured him calmly. "I promise, Clint--"
"Yeah, she puked on me yesterday," said George with a grin.  "Banksy and me are helping out, you know, since... since Donnie doesn't have an Alpha."
"Oh!  Red is bonded, blue is unbonded, green is vendors or supporters, black is presenters or speakers," said Eric.
Fury gave him a long hard look that pierced into his very being. Steve felt a chill run down his spine. Then Fury moved to turn away, wordlessly. That was his answer. Wonderful. And if Steve had thought he was feeling guilty earlier then it had nothing on how he was feeling now.
Bucky scrambled to his feet quickly and saluted.  "Colonel Karpov granted me leave, sir, to see the omega, sir."
"...did they mention me?"  Tony tried to sound like he didn't care, because he was well-aware that Nat, Clint, Sam, and all the rest of the SHIELD posse was more Steve's friend than his, and they were rightfully furious at Tony for his cold treatment of Steve.
There was a familiar thump in the bedroom; Tony had probably just slid out of the bed and onto the floor.
The two of them went to the suite in the back of the plane and all but collapsed into bed.  They slept like the dead until landing; the stress of the reporters and the short trip from the hospital to the plane had worn both of them out.
Steve didn't know where it was, actually.  Natasha had told him she'd give him the coordinates the morning of.  She refused to e-mail or text them. Nothing sent electronically was safe from Tony and she had made it clear that she and Clint only wanted Steve.  It was shaping up to be a very intriguing mystery, actually.
face in his perfect pair-bond.  For all of his own personal self-consciousness, Tony was confident he had the best omega.  Anyone who thought Steve's assertiveness was unnatural or a sign that he was feral was wrong.  Tony liked Steve's gumption.
That got Tony’s attention.  He looked up, staring at Steve over the edge of his sunglasses with a look of incredulity.  His eyes were a little red, a result of staying up most of the night.  He smirked after a moment, before his expression became its usual smug mask.  “Doesn’t Miss Potts know I was up all night arguing with an uppity little omega about politics he knows nothing about?”  He made a “shoo” motion with his hand.  “Go get me some real coffee, Stan.  I don’t drink decaf.  Decaf coffee is like non-alcoholic beer.  Absolutely no point.”
Tony's brain was moving sluggishly but it was able to come up with a half-dozen scenarios already.  He was hoping they were going to get a hearty congratulations and then be left alone, but it was more likely that they needed Iron Man for some bullshit international conflict involving terrorists with rocket launchers; or they needed Captain America to come handle a hostage crisis; or they wanted an emergency briefing on what, exactly, had gone down at the Expo.
onto the table, a picture of Steve on the front (fully clothed.) He was mid-step with his hands in his pockets, his smile a naturally warm one. Steve was glad they chose such a

Steve was totally taken by surprise at Tony wearing the pin. He'd never even thought about the fact that, whilst he wasn't allowed to make this about status, Tony could. His chest warmed and he walked over to kiss him on the cheek only to have Pepper reach out and smear the foundation off his mouth with the same sort of sigh his mother used to give him when he came back home covered in mud. "I love it, really," Steve told him and turned around to find Aria pushing a glass of juice into his hand.
He nuzzled Steve's hair, breathing in his smell, pressing into him, clinging to his hand.  He could feel Steve's heart pounding in his chest. He remembered when that heart used to flutter, when that chest used to be nothing more than skin stretched over bone.  And yet how brave, how assertive his sick, weak little omega had been. Gutsy, full of bravado, even though the odds were always stacked against him.
Steve," she said, sounding impatient. They played this game a lot. Steve moved to sit on a couch with a sigh. He hated talking about himself like this, especially with a stranger. How on earth did people find this
of Steve wearing a collar, he couldn't help but remember Steve's panic when he first tried one on, or all the shit with Bucky that had happened immediately following.  The whole thing had turned him off on the idea of a collar entirely.
"Yes, in retrospect, that was a very poor plan," said Pietro.  Another flash and suddenly he was standing by Sam's side, holding his gun.
"One of the kids in the pen thought you were in your early thirties, you know," Steve said, trying to cheer him up. Really, the only thing that would make any of this better would be them leaving but they couldn't leave just yet. He hoped Hal was okay. Steve ran the pad of his thumb over the backs of Tony's knuckles.
"...pride parades are also for betas who like the same sex.  They're actually a blast," said Tony. "But I don't think you're gonna convince Rhodey to join that scene.  He likes Sam, but not like that. And, I mean... I'm the same way, kinda. I could never be with another Alpha, not even a woman.  It would be too weird."
"Hmm," said Tony, who would love to pick the brain of a renowned nuclear physicist regardless of if they had a perchance for destructive bouts of rage.  If anything, that was sort of a bonus. "...well, the thing is, I've been trying to lay low, too. You know, let Steve do his thing."
Badass.  Right.  Another thing on the to-do list: contact IUPAC and get badassium put into the periodic table of elements.  They were going to have to have a long discussion about its symbol, since barium had already laid claim to Ba.
"...well.  Good morning, Patch Adams," said Tony, sarcasm bubbling to the surface before he even had time to comprehend what was going on.  "This is
