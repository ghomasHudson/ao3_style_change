“It was a prank, pumpkin pie, alright.  He was just messing with me, don’t worry about it.”  Tony winced as he heard a crash and a string of cursing from the other line.  He held the phone away from his face.
“Hey, not cool, man.  At least it’s mutual goo-goo eyes.”  Tony stifled his laughter and pushed the other boy toward the locker room.
"I'm so sorry, honey."  Steve resumed playing with his husband’s hair with his free hand, doing his best to be a solid presence.  “Do you want to talk about it.”  Tony shook his head no.
"Tony Stark, I swear on my life and my honor as Captain America, that I'll be here for you until the day I die, and then I'll be waiting for you in heaven or Valhalla or whatever it is, or maybe I'll meet you there.  No matter what happens, no matter how many times we argue, or bad days we have, I’ll be there.”
“The game is still a couple weeks away.  Besides, you’re always more important than football.  It’s just a game, Tones.  You’re my best friend.  I can’t believe I let this happen.  I should’ve known better than to let you go out alone with him.”  Tony felt an irrational anger claw up his throat.
“Okay then.  Be safe and text me when you get home.”  Tony mock saluted him.
The whole thing was making Tony twitchy.  If he thought it was bad being mostly invisible, this might actually be worse.  Steve always looked with an intensity that made Tony wildly on edge the whole time.  He could feel the judgment washing over him each and every time as Steve sized him up, almost like he was still deciding what he thought of his new math partner.  Despite his best efforts to the contrary, every time he felt Steve’s eyes on him, he couldn’t help the hot flash of self-consciousness that flooded his body.  No matter how hard he tried to fight it, he couldn’t deny that Steve was an attractive guy (and if Tony sucked his stomach in a little extra or fixed his hair when he felt that gaze, well.  What difference did it make?).  Maybe they could get through the remainder of the school year without doing anything more than that.  Tony for one wouldn’t be instigating any small talk.  Hopefully, Steve followed suit.

"Oh Tony, I'm not angry.  Not at all.  I love you.  But I think we need to talk in the morning.  I can’t let you go down that road.  It’ll end up nowhere good for either of us."
“Not very good, but it’s whatever.  How was practice, honeybear?”  Tony took a puff on the cigarette.
When he arrived in physics class, he slunk to the back and took his seat.  Mr. Richards took his place at the front of the class as the bell rang.
Waking up to the sound of birdsong was never a good thing in Tony’s mind.  All it meant was that it was too goddamn early.  He blindly patted around the bed to find his phone and fished it out of the blankets.  6:47 am.  Thirteen more minutes of peace before his alarm.  Figuring it wasn’t enough time to get more sleep anyway, Tony dragged himself out of bed, even achier than the night before.  He cringed at the blackening bruises on his body, layered over the faded ones.  The dark blotches littered his arms and torso, too deep and numerous for makeup to hide, and purple handprints encircled his neck.  With a rattling sigh, he grabbed a turtleneck sweater and jeans off the ground and tugged them on.  At least it was fall.  It would be months before he wouldn’t be able to get away with wearing long sleeves anymore.  Just to be safe, he layered a scarf over the turtleneck to hide his bruised throat.  As an afterthought, Tony dabbed a touch of concealer under his eyes and added a few swipes of mascara before putting his glasses on.  At least it was something.  He glared into the mirror.
“Oh, give me a break, Tony.  You know I don’t think that.  But I was right, wasn’t I?  To not trust him with you?”  Tony growled in anger.
“Shit,” Tony whispered under his breath.  Whatever, he would deal with that later.  He went to push himself up, but cried out in pain when he moved to sit up.  He collapsed back to the ground with a thud, crumpled in an awkward heap.  With more care this time, Tony rolled himself over until he was on his back, limbs spread in the shape of a snow angel.  Everyone had gone home, it was quiet except for the chirp of the crickets and his own labored breathing.  He gazed up at the stars.  The lights pulsated like lightning bugs as his gaze swam.  He reached out for them with a shaking hand.  In his pocket, his phone pinged, breaking the trance he’d been in.  It was from Rhodey.
Tony gritted his teeth as his abs tightened to get him purchase on the slick floors.  Once the worst of the pain subsided, he gulped the last of his coffee (cold) and shuffled to class with his head ducked and books hugged tight to his chest.  His first two periods slipped by in an unshakeable haze.  No amount of mental calculations could clear the fog clinging to his mind.  A throat cleared beside him.  He spared a disinterested glance around the room.  Finding nothing to concern himself with, Tony traced the tip of the pen over the back of his hand in a maze of swirls.  He looked at the clock.  Only ten more minutes until the bell.  Or maybe class had only started ten minutes ago.  Either one was equally possible in his mind.
“I just want to go home, okay?  I don’t want to cause any trouble here.”  He winced at how hoarse he sounded.  It seemed his plea had only made it worse.
Tony looked up at Steve.  He saw the vulnerability intense in his dark eyes.  As Steve looked closer though, he saw the unbridled pain finally showing through.  Steve had seen that haunted look in his eyes before.  He had caught glimpses of it, but Tony had quickly composed himself, pasting on a good natured smirk.  Suddenly, Steve heard a soft cry from the man beside him and looked over in concern.  Tony had a hand clasped around the arc reactor, staring at it with a dark fixation.  Steve gasped and pulled his hand away, meeting his husband’s eyes.  Steve dropped his head down to rest on Tony's chest, furiously kissing the beautiful piece of metal that was keeping the love of his life alive and with him.
Despite the rather inconvenient rearranging of seats in physics, by the end of the week, nothing had gone too terribly awry.  They still hadn’t spoken to each other outside of Steve asking to borrow a pencil, and that was fine by Tony.  Those brief couple of sentences had been painful enough, and it wasn’t an experience that he was eager to repeat.  The longer they went without any significant interaction, the better.  Each day, Tony trudged into class and slumped in his seat.  The teacher droned on in his ear for exactly fifty-five minutes, and then he packed up and left like clockwork.  Steve, on the other hand, was slightly more erratic.  For such a large boy, he was certainly spent a lot of time fidgeting, much to Tony’s annoyance.  His deskmate was always moving.  Tapping, jiggling, bouncing, you name it, Steve was damn well doing it.  Even worse than the incessant motion was the looks.  It seemed like whenever Tony glanced in Steve’s direction, he was either glazed over completely or staring right back.  At least he had the good sense to pretend like he’d been looking at something on the wall when he was caught.
“It was just Howard again.  There’s nothing new to say.”  Steve nodded in understanding, doing his best to avoid prying, even if he desperately wanted to.
“How was your date last night, Stark?  I can’t believe you honestly thought he liked you.”  The boy laughed as his friends egged him on.  One of the others ripped the scarf off his neck, inciting another series of howls from the group.
The smaller man clung to the soldier like a lifeline, and Steve held on, silent tears of his own cutting trails down his cheeks.  Unsure of what else to do, he firmly pressed his lips against Tony's, in an attempt to soothe his crying.  Steve heard a soft noise from the back of his lover's throat, which morphed into a sigh of content.  He felt Tony's hands press against his chest, stroking and feeling.  Steve returned the gesture of affection.  It was grounding, something they both needed.
“Of course, kid.  Sleep well.”  Staving off the burn behind his eyelids became an impossible feat once Rhodey hung up.  He flipped over violently.  If he cried himself to sleep with his face shoved into the pillows, well, Rhodey didn’t have to know that.  It was going to be a long year.
Steve stayed quiet.  Nothing he could say would do anything but ruin the mood.  Instead, he wrapped Tony up in his arms, laying them both down.  He tried to swallow the lump in his throat, but it burst from his lips in a wet sob.  Feeling his husband’s concern, he forced himself to speak.
--------------------------------
Once he was in, the bathroom was only a few doors down.  He slipped inside and looked in the mirror, cringing at his appearance.  There was mud smeared on his cheek and he was sporting a pretty decent black eye.  The smeared mascara around his eyes really added to the prominence of his dark circles.  Wiping the dirt off was fairly easy with a damp paper towel, but the makeup was there to stay.  Figuring it was a lost cause, Tony kneeled down under the hand dryer and made a sorry attempt to “blow dry” his matted curls under the gusts of hot air.  It was more of a success than he’d expected.  His hair was still more unruly than he’d prefer, but it was better than before.  At least the now-dried grime was easier to brush out with his fingers.
“Look at those handprints!  You like getting choked, bitch?”  The boy dug his fingers into the bruises as Tony gagged from the pain and pressure on his windpipe.  “I bet you do.  You’re probably getting hot for me right now, huh?”  Tony squeaked in surprise at the slap on his ass and crossed his legs on instinct.
Just a word of warning: Steve acts more like a high school student than Captain America in this chapter.  Peer pressure gets to him a bit, but I promise I love him and he'll get his redemption!  Either way, I enjoyed writing this chapter, so enjoy 1am angst!
"I'm sorry, Steve.  I'm sorry, baby.  I don't know what I was thinking.  I’d never want to hurt you like that.  Please, don't be angry with me."  His voice trembled, scarcely above a coarse whisper.
"I'll always be here.  Just say the word if you need me."  Tony carded a hand through his blonde hair.
He lit the first cigarette with a flourish and blew rings in the air above him as he opened his messages.  He’d missed five from Rhodey.  Two were about his date with Ty and the others were sent an hour after the previous texts about the Homecoming football game.  Tony sighed.  Football was a pointless sport full of hypermasculine ape-men in inexplicably shiny tights fighting over a sack of air, but he loved his platypus and he’d go, if only because he had nothing better to do at this point.  Instead of typing out a reply about his date and fielding the barrage of texts that would without a  doubt follow, he dialed Rhodey’s number.  His friends picked up on the second ring.
“I knew you weren’t paying attention.  I fumbled the last pass and lost us the game, Tony.”  He glared, but his eyes were soft.
“Sorry I snapped, honeybear.  I know you’re just trying to help me.  Right now I just want some rest though.  I’ll see you later?”
“What, so you think I’m not good enough for someone like Ty?  That there’s no way he’d be into me?”  He sat up and kicked his backpack across the room, relishing the bang it made.
“Rain.  It figures,” Tony grunted as the first splashes of rain snuffed out his cigarette.  He reached for his waist to pull on his jacket, cursing internally when he found it missing.  Probably still in Ty’s car.  Perfect.  He dropped the cigarette on the ground and crushed it under his boot heel and pulled his sweater up to cover his head.  His elbow twinged from where Ty had grabbed it.  Come to think of it, his whole body ached.  He could already feel the bruises forming under his clothes from the grabbing hands and the ache deep in his chest.
“Hey, Tony?  Do you know what I love about you?"  Tony shook his head.  "Well, first of all, I love the way you smile when you see me.  Your whole face lights up.  I love the way you laugh.  The real one, not the other one.  I love your body.  You have to know that by now.” Steve gasped at his lover’s embarrassed squeak.  “I love the way you kiss me.  I swear my heart does back flips.  I love the way you defend me no matter what it might cost you.  I love the way you're patient with me as I learn about this century.  I love the way you touch me, and how my skin tingles for hours afterward.  Most of all, I love the way you love me."  There was silence, with only the sound of breathing to break it.  Finally, Tony spoke.
“Aw, look at the little fag.  He’s fucking blushing.  Hey, I thought you were supposed to be a genius or something.”  A chorus of obnoxious laughter followed, earning a shush from the teacher.  For the second time that day, Tony felt his eyes burn as much as his cheeks.  He blinked back tears and pretended not to notice the whispering coming from the peanut gallery behind him.  He didn’t hear anything but that for the rest of the hour.
“Really?  Are you sure it wasn’t because you were staring at Steve Rogers?”  Tony blushed, unable to protest.  “See, I knew you looked a little dazed.  Your eyes glaze over when you stare at him too long.”  Rhodey grinned and got a good ruffle in his friend’s hair before Tony could slap his hand away.
“I’m not a damsel in distress, Rhodey.  I don’t need your permission to go on a date.  Besides, what difference does it make if he and his goons beat me up?  It’s not like Howard isn’t already.”  He panted from the outburst and Rhodey sighed.
“I’m serious, Rhodey.  It’s nothing that won’t be better in a few days.  Stop worrying.  You have a big game to prepare for.  We can’t have the star running back off his game, cupcake.”  Tony could almost picture Rhodey’s concerned face.
“Anything for my platypus, platypus.”  Rhodey laughed and picked him up, swinging him around before Tony had the chance to protest.  Once he sat him back down, Rhodey looked at him intently.  Realizing that he was waiting for a reaction to the game, Tony fumbled for something that would indicate that he’d been paying attention to anything besides Steve Rogers’ butt.  “You did great, honeybear!”  Rhodey rolled his eyes.
“Aye aye, captain.”  Rhodey flashed him finger guns and disappeared into the locker room.  Before Tony had even made it to the main entrance of the school from the football field, his path was blocked by a group of red jerseys.  Tony cringed internally, probably externally too if the laughter from in front of him was anything to go by.  Once again, he was faced with Rumlow and Tiberius, but now with even more groupies than the last time, a majority of the team at this point.  Including Steve Rogers.
“I haven’t checked.  Maybe a little,” he lied.  That wasn’t true.  He had lost weight.  Seven and a half pounds to be exact.  Tony was always exact.  Rhodey didn’t seem to buy it, but didn’t push, much to Tony’s relief.
"What was that, sweetheart?"
“Nah, it’s fine.  The walk is good exercise.”  Rhodey furrowed his brow.
"Tony, wake up, baby.  It’s not real."  His eyes shot open, wet with pain and fear.  He jumped out of bed and managed only a few frantic steps before he collapsed into a heap, body wracking with sobs.  Steve slipped out of bed and picked his husband up from the floor, holding him in his lap and rocking him back and forth on the ground.  Knowing there was nothing he could do about the nightmare, he hoped his presence was enough for now.
“Dammit, Tony, that’s not fine.  Anyone hitting you for any reason is never fine.  Are you sure you’re not really injured?  You know I can be at your house in ten minutes if I need to be.”
“I told you it’s fine, Rhodey.  Just a few bruises from him and his band of cronies.  Nothing I’m not used to.”  Rhodey cursed again.
The next few minutes were felt like an eternity.  The occasional shove or kick punctuated the insults being spewed at him.  Tony curled into a ball on the ground, a million miles away.  Even the hardest of the hits felt strangely dulled.  Tony wasn’t sure how long it was before he realized that he was alone.  His eyes peeled open, scratchy and slightly out of focus.  He fumbled for his glasses and slipped them back on.  The glass was cracked.
“Alright, guys.  We’re going to be trying something different today.  I’ll be assigning seats for the remainder of the year.  Those of you who have asked me for extra help outside of class will be seated with one of your more mathematically inclined peers.  Tony had to bite back a horrified choke as Mr. Richards began to assign seats.  There was no way he was getting out of this without tutoring some bonehead jock for the rest of the school year.  “Okay, Tony, I need you to come sit up here please, next to Steve.”  Tony’s heart jumped up his throat.  This was easily the worst case scenario he’d hoped to avoid.  Heart hammering in his chest, Tony slid silently into the seat beside Steve.  He didn’t make eye contact, didn’t even look over except to catch a quick glance.  Steve looked deeply uncomfortable and a brief flash of emotion (shame?  Horror?  Regret?) washed over his face.  Although it couldn’t be that.  Guys like Steve didn’t feel bad about making people like Tony miserable.  Tony spared another defeated glance at the boy beside him.  His bulky frame took up a bit too much space at the desk to be entirely dignified.  Tony sighed quietly and rested his chin in his hand.  This week just kept getting better.
“Tony, I’m sorry.  I didn’t mean it like that.  I just worry about you.  All the shit with your parents is bad enough.  I just want to keep you as safe as I can.  I feel so powerless with Howard.  At the very least I want to be able to keep you safe from my own fucking teammates.”  Tony laid back down on the bed, the fight drained out of him.
“Alright, I’m going.  Are you sure you don’t want a ride home?  It’s a long walk back to your place and I’ll only be a few minutes.”  Tony shook his head.
“Tony, hey!  I’m glad you could make it.”  He looked exhausted but pleased nonetheless.
“I bet you’re still getting off on the last one.  Rumlow said you like to get choked.  Is that right, bitch?  You get off on that?”  Tony shook his head and looked at the ground, trying to walk past the group.  An arm shot out and stopped him.  Tony cringed at the impact to his ribs.  Bumps like that had gotten more painful over the last few months.  Or the last fifteen pounds, however you wanted to look at it.  The sudden blow had him sprawling on the ground.  A sharp pain shot up his spine and wrists on impact with the grass.  Tony blinked back tears from the throbbing in his bones.  It hurt more than it should’ve.  He looked up again.  All the boys were laughing.  Except for Steve.  Steve was silent.
Tony wiped what he dirt he could from his clothes, but the grass stains and particularly muddy patches were there to stay.  By the time he’d finished his emergency makeover, students had begun to stream in.  Tony did his best to blend in, but his appearance stuck out like a sore thumb.  He just prayed he wouldn’t run into any of the football players today.
He wandered into the cafeteria and before he could finish the thought, a pair of rough hands grabbed him from behind.  Tony’s heart dropped to his stomach.
"Okay.”  His voice held more hesitation than Steve would have liked, but that was to be dealt with in the morning.  “I don't deserve you, Steve.  You should let me, you know.  I should have died in the cave.  But I didn't."
The distance back from the pizza place where he’d met Ty for their date seemed to trail on for hours now that he didn’t have a ride.  It was his own fault for being so stupid.  What were the odds that Ty would actually be into him?  Apparently not very good.  At least not as good as the odds of it being a prank, which had turned out to be no less than 100%.  In hindsight, Tony should’ve seen it coming.  He rubbed his shoulder again.  It was lucky it hadn’t been dislocated, considering the amount of force Rumlow’d yanked his arm back with during the ambush.  Climbing back into the rear window of the house proved to be a challenge.  Without the full use of all four limbs, it took several minutes of pained grunting and incriminating thumps before Tony landed with a dull thud on his back, crushed at an awkward angle between his bed and the wall under the window.  Cursing himself for making so much noise, Tony pulled himself onto the bed and collapsed spread eagle, staring at the ceiling.  Some of the paint was peeling off above his bed.  He threw an empty water bottle at it and sneezed as the flakes fell on his face.  With a groan of defeat, he grabbed for his phone out of his backpack, yanking it out from the tangle of garbage that had collected on top of it.  On second thought, he grabbed a pack of Newports from the inside pocket of the bag and scoffed.  Only two left.  He’d have to steal more from Howard tomorrow.
Shit you guys, I'm the worst.  I told myself that I'd have this done by the end of the year.  Clearly, that has not happened.  On the upside, I've managed to move out and start at a four-year university with minimal suicidal ideation so that's fun.  Anyway, I think the updates will more regular from now on.  Maybe.  Please excuse the melodrama, this chapter was sponsored by depression and a horrible cold.
Steve yawned and scrubbed his face with a hand, stumbling into the bedroom, bracing himself on the chest of drawers by the door.  For the first time in many weeks, he had been beaten to bed by Tony, sleeping off jet lag after a week’s worth of business meetings in Tokyo.  He opened the door and smiled softly at the sight of his husband sleeping.  It was a comforting sight, one he didn’t often have the privilege of walking in on.  Moving quietly, he settled onto the bed, removing his shirt and jeans until only his underwear were left.  He knew it probably wasn’t necessary to be so careful.  Tony was so sleep deprived he was bound to sleep through the noise, but Steve still felt the need.  He let the stress of the day melt out of his body and tossed an arm over the sleeping man who sighed softly and pressed into his embrace.  Moonlight filtered through the window, illuminating the room with a gentle glow.  Steve buried his face in his partner’s silky hair.  He was pleased to find that it still carried the scent of the shampoo he liked so much.  He felt a soft vibration against his chest, but couldn’t make out the words.
Steve snarls. “It’s good of you to stand there and throw it back onto Natasha, when you’re the one who’s caught red-handed in these photos.” He picks them up and waves them at Tony like he’s daring him to deny them, deny their existence. “Let’s forget for a second whatever ulterior motive that Natasha might have had when she gave me these pictures; are you denying that it’s
“Yeah, you are,” Steve snarls. “I look at you, and you just can’t help yourself, can you, sweetheart? You’d spread your legs in an instant if I just gave you the fucking signal. If I touch you, you’re on fire, aren’t you? You have my name, you have my children. You couldn’t
, and yes, you’ve tried very hard to explain your actions, but you still ran away from you. No, you didn’t
“Like shit,” Tony says, honestly.
He believes Steve when he says that he has never slept with this woman, that he never touched her except for some errant, deceptive kiss when he was a new recruit; he believes Steve when he says that he doesn’t have feelings for his partner in crime, but that doesn’t mean that she doesn’t have feelings for him.
Tony and Steve exchange a look.
,” Bhim quotes.
Tony shrugs. “Beats me,” he says, dryly. “The organisation has origins in Nazi Germany. I decided not to think too deeply into the reasoning of people who’d join a group like that.”
“I suppose that was the reason why you didn’t tell him about Natasha either, because that would mean that you would have to explain everything to him, everything about SHIELD. What about the Winter Soldier?”
Steve laughs, harsh and grating. “Yeah, you say that now, but a week, two weeks, a month, a year later, when I can’t fuck you like the way you deserve to be fucked, and we’ll see who still believes this is not why we’re together,” he growls.
Tony turns and looks out the way they were driving.
Tony chews on his lower lip and makes his way over to Steve, perching on edge of the coffee table, praying that it can take his weight. “Steve, honey?” he says, carefully, precise.
“You’re sure,” Steve says, carefully.
Tony takes the chance to kick the throttle, and then, the cart shoots off, doubling its speed and shooting under the low cross beam at the same time that a huge rumble of fire shoots up behind the Nazis, catching their car and setting them, Zola and all of his men, alight.
For someone who’s tied to a chair, Tiberius Stone does manage to dredge up an unreasonable amount of scorn for someone who he thinks is below him.
“I’m not telling you anything,” Tony says, defiantly.
Tony lifts a hand to stop him from continuing with that thought. “I made the choice to help you take down HYDRA back in Cambridge, James. That was my choice, no one else’s, and you didn’t force me into that. You said it yourself; this guy came back here to look for
“Sir?”
Wanda shakes her head. “We can stick the kids in front of the television, and then, we can talk. You look… like you need someone to talk to about this.”
“I just thought, because you haven’t seen her since the kids’ first day, you might have forgotten.”
“They were of us four, except
“Why did they take us?” Peter asks in a small voice. “Did we do something bad?”
He cuts himself short at that point.
Howard stares at Maushmi, deeply, before sighing and nodding. He directs a glower at Tony, who hardly dares hope.
Toni leans in with a smile. “I want to meet with Tiberius Stone, remembering how it felt like when you fucked me good and hard. Is that too much to ask?” she asks, innocently.
? I mean, we’re friends, right? We were friends, at least, and fuck, Tony, half the universe is dead; people that we
Tony feels a weight escape his chest. “Thank God, thank you,” he flounders for words “It’s just… they’re my first, and I don’t really know what I’m doing…” he trails off. He swallows. “I’m glad to know they’re good, that they’re doing okay.”
And almost as if hearing him, Wanda’s chest rises and falls.
“What?” Steve asks, confused.
He almost feels guilty, planting his kids in front of the television like they’re something to be disposed of when he has something better to do, but he bats the idea away quickly. He loves his children, loves them like nothing else in the world.
So, he nods. “I can,” he murmurs.
Steve clears his throat and offers his hand, which Tony promptly shakes. “I am, uh, it’s nice to meet you, Mr. Stark.”
for a son, in a savage, unkind voice that draws all the colour out of Steve’s face. He goes on to say that if Peter had wanted to do Little League or something less gender-aligned like guitar, Steve wouldn’t have a problem, but God forbid that Strong-Man Steve have anything less than the perfect macho son.
Steve’s brow furrows, but he doesn’t push.
“You mean, kill me.”
. I don’t want to hear any more excuses,” Tony says, firmly. “If I have to cook tonight, I will kill us both. Ergo, we’re going out to dinner tonight. The kids are gone. There are no leftovers in the fridge. I can’t think of a more fitting occasion for us to go and have some fun that doesn’t involve Play-Doh.”
it? Who do you think you
“You,” Steve punctuates the word with a firm kiss to the side of Tony’s face, “are a very specific person.”
There’s a knot in his belly, hot and sweltering, as he makes his way through the corridors of the castle, until he comes across the door to Grant’s chambers. He raps his knuckles on the door, tapping his foot impatiently, until it finally opens, revealing Grant on the other side.
Tony closes his eyes, and he can see the flash of metal from the killer’s hand.
James glares at him, and he holds his hands up in surrender.

“No, no, not since I got here,” he soothes. “They just asked about you, what you knew. That guy, Rumlow, he has a thing for me. I’ve been playing that along. Can we just get out of here?”
Steve brings him dumplings, and a box for himself. Tony props his set on his lap, thankful for the thick blankets that he’s lying under so he can’t feel the burn from the bottom of the takeaway container.
Instead of Steve pulling Tony to his feet, he shoves him back into the chair, pulling the ropes around him again.
James looks down at his feet. “What I meant before…” he hesitates for an agonising moment, “I saw you with the kids… a lot. That’s all I really saw at the beginning: you taking them to school, you bringing them from school, you taking them to lessons. It was just the three of you. And then, sometimes, I’d see him. Your husband. He usually shows up at home really later, after nine at the very least. And he leaves very early. Six, normally. He very rarely comes out with you and the kids. He never comes out with
“You see, Ser James has a face that rests in anger, which makes him more fearsome than he intends to be,” the woman says, her eyes flashing like a cat’s. “Conversely, you might see him singing to cats, soft his heart is.”
“Rubber?” he gasps out.
The bag slides off down the hallway, as if pulled by some invisible thread, out of sight.
“I know, I know things have been hard for us,” Steve says, earnestly. “I know that… I know that we’ve not exactly had the easiest relationship. I know that we’ve fought a lot and sometimes, those fights have resulted–”
, Tony thinks.
“Maybe he does, but that doesn’t mean he’s a good husband or the husband that you deserve,” James points out.
Her eyes are gentle, kind, and Tony has the sudden thought that she must be a mother, even if it is somewhat a sexist thought, the idea of a woman only being kind once she’s had babies.
Phillips gazes at the photos, then, looking at the corporal. “Corporal, why don’t you go get a cup of coffee?” he says, briskly.
He walks out of the school building, shaken, and then, he pauses at one of the big pine trees at the front, on the lawn, stopping and resting his head against the heavy bark, his jaw aching with how hard he’d clenched his teeth. Tony looks around – the area is empty; he ends up sliding to his knees, wrapping his arms around himself, and letting out a low, animal sound which then, devolves into a sob.
But no, none of those things happen.

“Why not? I mean, the pieces fit. The fact that you were visiting him and spending so much time with him, the fact that you were disappearing and lying to me, and I thought, maybe he is fucking him, maybe he is cheating on me, but maybe he’s also trying to screw me over in a whole different way. Maybe he’s been working for HYDRA this whole time, and I’m just a fucking idiot.”
“Because what, Tony?” Steve pushes. “Because what? Because I’m breakable? Because I’m sickly? Because if you touch me a little too hard, I might break.”
“You are, you are only a little older than a child. I could not, I
“No, he isn’t!” Tony snaps. “He fucking isn’t, Amma. I don’t believe you, because I can’t find any fucking sign of him. It really does look like Obadiah Stane disappeared, but even if he did change his name, flee to fucking Mexico or something, I would be able to find him. I could track him, search the surveillance cameras for his face, unless he got some plastic surgery like the Joker, but I can’t find him anywhere. So, you tell me, you tell me
are dead, and I don’t, I don’t want to do this anymore, I don’t want to live, knowing that you’re out there and I’m here, and we don’t get along. So, please, I’m begging you… let me go get us something to eat, and we can just… talk. Let’s just talk.”
Steve would react with hostility, Tony could imagine it. He could imagine Steve shouting at him, calling him insane, asking him whether he really thought Steve was capable of doing that to him. And then, Tony would start shouting back, throwing back all of the evidence, all of the times that Steve shunned him and turned away from him and reacted with no emotion towards him, and all the fucking times that he left him alone because of that stupid fucking insurance job that he has – and the fact that he now knows that it wasn’t the job, it had nothing to do with fucking insurance, and it had everything to do with the hot redhead that he probably bangs on the conference room table. And then, Steve, because he’s not really a liar, he’s not the elaborate manipulator that plans long-cons for years and decades on end, because he really does have a conscience and a notion of sin and while he’s not a practicing Catholic, still believes in all of the things that his mother taught him and knows that adultery is a sin, would finally resign himself to the truth.
Men like Tony’s father find girls who aren’t their wives to get off with, so they can feel young and handsome, instead of old and sagging. Men like Tony’s father screw as many people as they can because they
James’ lower lip trembles, and he ducks his head. When he lifts it again, his mouth is stretched wide in a grin, but his eyes are over-bright, too bright to be anything else but tears.
Eshe nods at him, gives him a soft smile, thanks him for being brave enough to say all of this, and Tony quietens, an odd state for him, folds his hands in his lap like a good boy and feels like he’s been clawed raw on the inside.
When Tony gets close enough, Rumlow slings his arm around Tony’s shoulders, pulling him close, so tightly that Tony’s muscles protest against the firm, rough hold, his bones grinding together under his skin.
James comes over for breakfast one day.
His head feels like it’s made of cotton, and he sways.
“Even when I was small and skinny and looked like a breeze could knock me over?” Steve clarifies.
Maybe things would have been very different if he’d been brave enough to speak with Steve before everything got as bad as it did.
Tony stares at him. “I didn’t think that anyone was capable of hurting me the way you did,” he muses.
Steve lifts an eyebrow. “Oh?” he says, archly.
“You feel better now, right?” Steve rubs Tony’s back.
Smoke is already starting to fill the cavern.
“Tony?”
“I said I wasn’t going to kill him, so I’m not going to fucking kill him.” James makes a face. “Even though you deserve better, and at the very least, I should fucking beat his face in for having some fucking side piece while you sit at home and treat him like a fucking king.”
Steve had been ridiculously turned on by how good of a shot Tony was (conveniently forgetting that Tony’s father made weapons for a living, and Tony was involved heavily in designing and testing them), and they’d fucked behind one of the stalls, and when they were done, he’d put the necklace around Steve’s throat.
“Yeah, but I’ve spoken to Bucky, Tony. He’s not having any of these dreams, and you spoke to Rhodey, didn’t you? Did he mention anything?” Steve asks with an unsure tongue.
He looks down at finds evidence of a wet orgasm all over his belly, which Steve leans down and doesn’t hesitate to lick up until his stomach is spit-shiny and damp. Tony groans, and his cock twitches.
Peter scowls with all of the anger a child can muster. “You know I hate it when you say that,” he complains.
“As I said,” Steve says, roughly, and there is a sheen of tears in his eyes, “I do not believe you to be a cold-hearted, cruel murderer. I would like to believe that you would not lie about such a thing.”
“I could have done this while you were drunk,” Steve goes onto say, ignoring Stone. “But I have this thing where my victims should know who I am and why I’m killin’ them, just to twist the knife a little deeper. After all, I mean, you can see me, you know I’m hardly the bodybuilder-type, and that always fucks with people, the idea that a short stack like me is capable of killin’ them.”
“It is,” Steve says, pathetically earnest. “It is yours.
The night ended with Tony dragging Steve back to his apartment, now his alone since Rhodey was off at basic training, and fucking him until his toes were curling and his eyes were rolling at the back of his head. Only after the fourth or fifth time they’d fucked did Steve muster up the courage to tell him that he’d been a virgin until Tony had gotten his hands on him.
Tony touches his fingertips to his eyes, and they come back wet, and he runs his tongue over the blunt underside of his teeth.
“I hate you,” he mutters.
“I can get the doctor,” he blurts out, his hands shaking. “Let me just-”
“Okay, okay.”
“What did you say?” Steve asks, quietly but with a dangerous edge.
He hadn’t needed to be a teenager to know that all was not well in the Stark house.
“Yeah?” Steve doesn’t take his eyes off the kids.
. So, don’t you sit there and pretend like I didn’t do this for your own good, that I didn’t break both of our hearts to
It appears that nothing has changed.
done it, and it’s nothing compared to what you’ve done.”
“Did you fall?” Jarvis asks, urgently.
“I think I know what it was about,” Steve says, grimly, rubbing his hand over his face. “God, we shouldn’t have even come to school today.”
“Yeah,” Steve says and pulls them away from the wall.
“Well, you’re both idiots. Clearly,” Fury sighs, pinching the bridge of his nose. “Okay, you two should get the hell out of here so that I can tell the others that we won’t be able to use the gym on the Nazis.” He purses his lips thin. “Between the three of us, I wasn’t so stoked on using the thing either. Seemed more trouble than it’s worth.”
“The police are saying that she was jealous, Natasha, I mean,” Sarah says, quietly, “and apparently, you guys told them that they had a fight at lunch.”
“Appa,” Maushmi says, joyfully, twisting one of her little hands in Tony’s dark hair. “We missed you. When we came home, you were sleeping. Daddy said you weren’t feeling well. Are you feeling better now?”
Wanda runs her tongue over the seam between her lips and looks down at her lap, her shoulders hunched as if remembering an old grief.
Tony blinks at him.
Steve’s hands close around Tony’s shoulders, stealing any other protest that Tony might have made.
Steve, when he catches Tony looking, blushes. “I, uh, my ma always said that I shouldn’t dirty up someone else’s space,” he explains, rubbing the back of his neck.”
way, I wouldn’t have any misconceptions that what we did just then had anything to do with
“When we were… back in Brooklyn, he was short, small, skinny, but he had a mouth the size of New Jersey. He was ordering me around constantly.
Peter tilts his head. “So, you’d be married to Bucky too?” he says, carefully.
Steve flinches, looking down at his feet.
The kids scream.
He knows that fact like he knows any other true thing in the universe: the grass is green, the sky is blue, water is wet, humans evolved from apes, and Tony Stark loves Steve Rogers.
“Then, I would like to go out to dinner with you, Steve.” Tony straightens.
Tony starts, and outside, through the open door of the classroom, there’s a full-sized rubber body bag, the sort of bag for corpses, lying in a black pool of water or blood or God knows what. The body bag is stained through, red and yellow, and the sight of it churns Tony’s stomach.
“Ya think some of that colour might rub off on my prick?”
“Stane!” he shouts, making it to the middle of the street. “Where the hell are you?”
?” Stone sighs. “It’s really not your fault. This is who Toni is. She fucks with people, makes them think like you’re the only one in the world, but you’re not. With wealth, comes a certain understanding of how Toni is, what she’s like, how to deal with her. But you don’t have that, Steve. I’m sorry, but she’ll never love you the way you love her, because she can never love you, not really. Like loves like, and you, my man, are
They make their way towards the master bedroom, and Steve sits up in bed, when he hears their footsteps, his face shining with hope, and then, it falls, when he sees Tony holding onto their children. And then, in the span of a second, his face warps into an expression of cheer.
“Why, Stark, do you not like him this way?”
Spiders scurry past his bare feet, and he dodges them as much as he can, backing up to the steps.
“Did you love my daddy?”
Steve checks the road, seeing if it’s safe to park on the side so they can switch.
“Well?” Tony asks, when the silence becomes too much for him to bear. “What do you think?”
God, she has great breasts.
Steve’s mouth is parted, as if he wants to speak but can’t seem to find the words.
“I don’t want to hear this,” he says, shaking his head, clenching his eyes shut.
Tony nods.

“Let’s take it upstairs with us.”
“Who?” Steve demands, his face hardening into a mask of anger. “Who was in the house? Who wanted the kids?”
Tony smiles.
They can sleep for another half an hour – it’s enough time for him to get their lunches together.
“Toni, our jobs are important, just like yours is, but we
Finally, Steve lands on his knees in front of Tony’s chair, and he’s ripping the ropes with his bare hands, the muscles in his arms flexing, and Tony’s pulling his arms free, as they slip to the ground. His shoulders scream in response, but he’s too busy pulling the gag from his mouth.

“You… don’t have very good self-esteem, do you?” Sam says, after a moment.
“I just… I came to see how you were doing,” Steve says, voice barely above a whisper.
or my
“You’re a coward,” Tony tells him, his voice like a blinding-hot spear.
His hand cups Steve’s jaw, squeezing it slightly to smush his lips together, and then, he presses his lips to them.
Eshe’s dark eyes fly to him, with a raised eyebrow. “Tony? Is there something that you want to say?”
“Feels good, doesn’t it?” Steve asks, softly, but with a menacing edge. “Like this is all you’re good for, baby, just to be fucked stupid on a cock, on
“Uh, there’s–that’s some kids drag racing outside, I think...”
“Because you’re Howard Stark’s son?”
“But we can’t do it without bullets and bandages. Without tanks and tents. That’s where you come in.”

Summary: Steve knocks on his door.
you’re having an affair with her.”
Phillips picks up a thick sheaf of letters, leafing through the first few. “I’ve signed more condolence letters today than I’d care to count. But the name does sound familiar.” He meets Steve’s eyes. “I’m sorry.”
“No, it does. Something I said, or something I did, is clearly upsetting you.” Steve sighs. “Tony, we’ve been living with misunderstandings for months. I don’t want to do this anymore; I don’t want to play games; I don’t want half-speak. I just want to tell the truth.”
.” He shakes his head. “I don’t know why he got the idea that something was going to go wrong.”
“Steve, Steve!” he calls out. “Steve, don’t be like this. Look, I’m sorry. You’re right. I did make assumptions, and they were the wrong assumptions. You’re right. Just… just don’t go, don’t…” he trails off.
“That’s good,” Eshe says, approval shining boldly through her words and voice. “That’s an important first step. James can’t be part of your relationship until he is himself first. Plus,” she shoots Steve an uneasy look, “he doesn’t remember you, Steve.”
Tony drags his hand over his face, feels his eyes heat with the threat of tears.
When Tony looks over, James is rubbing his hands together, the skin stained with streaks of blood, and there are two other dead men on the ground between him and Steve, and Tony doesn’t know who killed who.
“If you’re sure,” he says, carefully.
Steve clearly considers it for a moment, before he reaches inside his stained shirt and pulls out cash from his money belt, laying a wad of notes on the bar.
“So, you’re here to get hitched, then?” Steve says, slowly, his lips twisting, wryly.
She leads them, with a demure look on her face, to arguably one of the best tables there, right up against the window, so they can look across the New York skyline.
“There’s no time for this!” Tony snaps. “There’s a fucking terrorist after me, and something tells me that a guy who’s part of an organisation that was willing to poison an entire state’s water supply to cause mass panic and casualties is not above using two four-year-olds to get to me.”
“I have lymphedema; that’s a chronic condition that causes swelling in my limbs because Yinsen had to move the parasternal nodes behind my sternum, so I had to design a surgical drain to completely replace the parasternal nodes with a port on both sides of the arc reactor housing so that I can drain the fluid as needed. A lot of my lungs were cut away, minimising my capacity to breathe. I lost about thirty percent of my lung capacity during both surgeries. I get bronchitis and pneumonia
“My brother died,” she says, dully. “Around two years ago.”
“You were sitting on my couch when I opened the door. I almost brained you with a crowbar,” Tony says, flatly.
– Tony had been the
“I’ve got some equipment for you to try,” Tony says, smoothly. “Tomorrow morning?”
“I will beat your ass into the wall,” Steve said, calmly, patiently, his voice pitched low.
“Did he actually say those things?” Wanda asks him, carefully.
“You’re sure?” Steve asks, pointedly.
The next day, Tony climbs out of a cold bed only to find that Steve has already left. The bathroom is still sweltering hot after the shower that Steve must have taken, the glass all muggy, and the toothpaste cap is off and lying on one corner of the benchtop. Tony glares down at it and puts it back on after he’s finished brushing his teeth.
Sam’s expression flickers with unease, but he takes the shield from Steve, nonetheless, sliding it onto his arm.
Steve’s thumb smooths over Tony’s lower, plump lip, prying it open. “Such a fucking pretty mouth,” he murmurs. “God, maybe I should come again all over your face, make you wear it so I can catch it on the video, so you remember how much you needed to be stuffed full so you took it both holes.”
Tony nods.
“-and isn’t that a good thing?” James offers.
“Just like you said you’d be back last time?” Tony says, deliberately phrasing his words like a blow. “That was your word too.”
“It’s good. I’m good,” Tony soothes.
“Maybe we should consider all past accounts closed.”
“But what is unjust is also quite often reality,” Tony goes onto say. “And unfortunately, reality is where we exist.” His lip trembles. “I don’t want to live the rest of my life in fear. I don’t want him to take the rest of our lives together, Steve. That is something that I cannot abide. I
“Ripped it out of the wall,” James says, casually.
“For what?” Tony asks, curiously, hungry for more of him.
Sam considers him, carefully. “So, Steve’s best friend is alive,” he says, casually.
, I shouldn’t have done that.”
“Not just your parents,” Steve says, grimly.
“She introduced herself as Natasha Romanoff, sir,” JARVIS tells him. “She says that she works with Master Steve.”
“Because you were seventeen, Tony,” James groans. “And I was… God, I was putting you in danger, getting you involved in things that I had no business getting you involved in-”
“Tell me you’re mine,” Steve says, his voice suddenly full of some rage that Tony doesn’t quite know how to define.
“I didn’t?” Tony asks, weakly.

“Tony, you have a deep-seated insecurity where this man is concerned.”
Steve fixes him with a careful, precise stare. “As much as James means to you.”
over the possibility that something might happen to their children, to

“I can’t be with you like that
Stone wakes up, tied to a chair.
Tony runs deeper and deeper into the maze of pipes, most of them burst and blowing steam everywhere. Thank God he’s small-made, which makes squeezing through smaller and smaller openings much easier. But then, he finds himself trapped, shut off by three brick walls. He presses back against one of them, wetness from the bricks seeping into his clothes.
“No, no–”
Steve pulls off, and his hair is sticking to his forehead, matted with sweat. “You like that, don’t you?” he murmurs. “You like my fingers in you?”
He storms off.
They can never begin to rebuild anything, unless Steve has felt what Tony feels.
Tony nods. “Just, uh, just go slow until I tell you otherwise.”
“I will get Bucky, and we will dispose of the body. I will send Natasha to you. With her help, you might clean up. I will come to you when it is done, so you know that you are safe. How does that sound?” he asks, gently.
“Because you seemed weirdly pleased that he was dead, and that made me want to laugh for the first time in years,” James says, bluntly.
Steve and James climb out of the car, and their faces are different; Steve isn’t Steve, his puppy dog husband that forgets to switch on the laundry machine, and James isn’t James, his ex-lover who can’t make two-minute noodles.
Tony holds onto Abraham, watching with dull eyes as everyone gathers around him, shocked whispers filling the air.
“You’re not undeserving,” Steve says, almost immediately. “Tony, please, please, I need you to listen to me when I say this. I love you. I love you like… God, I don’t even know how to explain it. All I can say is that I would be half a person if you left me, that you make the world better just by being in my life, that… that I didn’t think I could be this happy, as happy as I am in this moment, and that’s because of you. I
Steve laughs, his hand closing around where Tony’s wrists lock over his sternum.
“Not as tiny as you, punk,” James shoots back.
Obadiah staggers backward towards the oven.
Slowly, but surely, though, James becomes a fundamental part of their lives, all of their lives, so much so that it becomes hard quite soon to imagine a time in their lives where he wasn’t there.
Tony flashes him the edge of a smile. “I love you too,” he says, effusive with emotion, his voice warbling, feeling something soft like cotton candy spread in his chest. “I love you too.”
Tony watches him for a moment, biting back the instinctive flood of words that rise up in his throat.
When they’re done and lying on the bed, panting, with Tony’s arm thrown over his shoulder, as sweat dampens his entire body, he turns onto his side and surveys Steve with all the sterile gaze as one might a solid eggplant he was going to roast over the stove.
“All will be well,” Steve insists.
“That’s not true at all,” James grinds out. “I loved you. I
Steve nods, solemnly, in complete, unencumbered acceptance.
“I know,
“Yeah, and you
“What does this have to do with me?” James demands, his brow furrowing.
And then, it ends, and Grant hands him another book, a smile on his face like nothing had happened.
But men like Steve don’t do that, don’t resort to casual things to make themselves feel better. Men like Steve find life partners, people to share everything with, to build a family with, to fall in love with and to have picnic lunches out in public with, and Tony knows this, because Steve did all of those things with him.
He starts to eat again, to smile, to talk, to read. He spends all of his time, if he can, with Natasha, and it means that Grant stays away.
“Anthony Stark, I salute you. I am even a little sorry you will miss this moment.”
“Hodge passed every test we gave him. He’s big, he’s fast, and he takes orders. In short, he’s a soldier,” Phillips argues.
“It wasn’t,” Steve says, roughly. “It wasn’t easy at all, Tony. It killed me every time I had to lie and tell you something else, to make up some fucking cover story to explain where I was going so you wouldn’t find out that I was a SHIELD agent and going out to take care of terrorists. And it hurts even more now that I know what you were thinking this whole time.”
Sam and Tony exchange a concerned look.
“Oh, are we?” Steve says, glancing at Tony quickly.
“Re-frame the future,” Maushmi and Peter declare, as they’ve declared fifty-thousand times.
Tony looks up at her, panic etched into his features, as he tries to wrench his arm away from the nurse. “Wait, wait, will it make me drowsy?” he demands. “Will it make–”
He leans over the side of the bed, eyes on Steve and James, especially as Steve looks like he’s going to maul him with his mouth alone. He fishes his hand inside the bedside table, pulling out a small bottle of lube with a soft growl of glee. He spills a copious moment onto his fingers, just as Steve’s hand finds James’ cock, and Tony watches in amazement, as James slowly starts to stiffen between Steve’s pale fingers.
“Steven, do you take Anthony to be your husband? Do you promise to be faithful to him in good times and in bad, in sickness and in health, to love her and to honour him all the days of your life?”
“I know what I said,” Tony replies. “And all I’m saying is that I’m married.”
He moves to the second page: three people with dark skin and dark hair grouped together, and a fourth person far away.
be talking about him, thinking about him. I just… I’m still struggling with that.” He pulls back so that he can look Steve in the eye. “But that doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t talk about Barnes and Wilson if you want to,” he says, firmly.
Steve kisses him first on the crown of his head, and then, James presses a smacking one to his cheek.
But Steve is Tony’s husband, and Rhodey and Tony loved each other like brothers, and Pepper was Tony’s greatest friend, so, between the four of them, they light the pyre.
Steve nods, his entire face pained. “And then, you walked through the door, and I couldn’t.”
“Oh,” Peter says. “Is he a scientist too?”
Tony taps her on the nose. “If you don’t clean up the bathroom, then, you might trip and fall into the drain and be lost forever.”
Tony looks up and almost instinctively, his hands around the twins tighten.
He stares at the bathroom, at the wet towels hanging over the railing and the action figures lying all around the bathroom sink and the toy, velvety snake looped around the tap in the bathtub.
“I’m going to find out why the engines have shut down.” Steve looks over his shoulder at him, his eyes were soft. “Stay here, please.”
“Fine, fine,” James waves a dismissive hand.
Peter curls into his side immediately, and Tony keeps his hand braced on the back of Peter’s head.
because I always thought that HYDRA must have some fucking scruples, like you don’t
He has more decency than that, and he loves James, he does, he doesn’t stop loving people even if they hurt him, as evidenced by Steve himself, but he’ll never touch him, never let James touch him, as long as Steve is there.
him to put his hands on you,” he says, his eyes slitted in anger. “How do you think that made
Steve is fully dressed, perched on the edge of the bed.
“So,” Tony says, a frantic edge to his voice, “you will want to send for the guards, have me put in irons and taken down to the dungeons to await your justice.”
Maushmi is in the kitchen, chopping up the radishes for the
Tony nods, miserably.
“This isn’t the best time or place for this,” Howard says, his voice sharp around the edges, “but I would sure like to know what the hell you were doing shacked up with three other teenagers in the middle of the night, especially a delinquent like Natasha Romanoff.”
Tony reels back from the question, humiliation like a terrible colour all over his body. “Fuck, Steve!” he cries out. “What the fuck?”
Steve shakes his head, looking suddenly miserable. “I never meant to hurt you.”
“Shut up, just
perfect.”
“What a dick,” Wanda says, venomously.
Peter nods, climbing onto his knees so that he can perch on the side of his bed. “Yeah, Daddy, all the parents are coming to see our classroom and all our work, and they’re gonna meet with Mrs Eldridge, and then,
“No, no, I mean, I haven’t talked about it with them yet, but I’m sure they wouldn’t want to adopt you if they wouldn’t want you to call them
His lower lip starts quivering, before he sinks his teeth into it, forcing himself to cage his emotion.
Tony folds his arms across his chest. “I don’t know what you’re talking about.”
was the one who recommended it to her. And then, I saw her necklace.”
Card Number: 4066
“Apparently,” Steve goes on, his voice haunted, “they did it so that nothing would be more important than the mission, so that they’d never have a distraction.” He looks wistful for a moment before he shakes his head. “Soon after she graduated, she was sold to the KGB. She… built kind of a reputation for herself, and that’s why SHIELD sent someone out to kill her. Another agent, his name is Clint Barton. He met her in some shitty motel room in Montana, and he decided to spare her life instead of killing her. She defected, and she joined SHIELD instead. She has a… specific set of skills that SHIELD really likes to make use of.”
Tony just stares at him, his tongue like lead in his mouth.
, wake me up. Wake me up, Steve!”
Tony’s throat flexes. “We shouldn’t talk about this now,” he says, quietly, smoothing his golden hair back like how he might have done for the kids.
“What the hell,” he says, breathlessly.
, because of the secrets you keep from me, because you were trying to
And then, he falls asleep.
“I’m not playing at anything,” Tony snaps. “I apologise if I have made you think that such attentions are something that I might be interested in, but that is not what I intended and that is not how I feel. I will be faithful to your brother, and your behaviour is inappropriate. It must stop.”
“Don’t start,” Steve replies, his voice stern edged. “I don’t want to hear it. We need to get back to the battle.”
“Oh, fuck,” Steve groans, tipping his head back. “You are going to destroy me.”
“I have the gem,” Steve reassures. His hands are on his shoulders. “You have transport, right?”
And now, no one will ever believe him; this is what Steve is, he’s strong and stalwart and decent and honourable – he’s not the sort of guy that would cheat on his husband, until he actually does.
But he hasn’t come yet, and Tony is still left waiting.
“I…” Tony looks at Steve, something gnawing in his gut. “I want to build something that lasts, something that doesn’t break as easily as our marriage did at the first sign of… I don’t know, trouble.”
“Look, I’m not keen on it either, but it’s either walk, or only get to school at 11:30. Don’t you want to be in the parade?” Tony asks, cajoling.
And then, everyone starts taking a knee.
, like he was some fancy, strapping businessman and not a terribly young college student who ate too much chilli cheese fries and often threw vodka cranberries at stupid people.
Both men are tall, with golden hair, pale skin like milk, so much darker than Tony’s, and blue eyes, like the sea before a storm in the middle of summer. There’s a sly tilt to the brother’s mouth, while Lord Steve’s lips are turned down at the corners, as though he would rather be elsewhere.
Each step away from what is left of the battle is a death knell in the life he’d dared to dream for himself.
to me!”
“That doesn’t mean you have to tell me anything,” Tony says, quickly, a stern edge to his voice.
It was done in a hurry, not the grand society affair that her mother and father would have preferred in the end; she and Ty had rushed to town hall and signed papers and Toni had worn a white cocktail dress and that was it, they were married, and it was done, something that Howard couldn’t take away from her.
He squeezes Tony’s arm, and his hand comes back wet and gleaming with blood, fresh blood. Across Tony’s forearm, there’s a deep gash, which is bleeding freely, and Tony remembers where the killer’s knives had cut him when Tony hadn’t been quick enough to dodge.
Steve looks outside the window, at the lake that seems exactly the same as the day that Steve knelt on the pier and asked Tony to marry him.
“I was intrigued. Besides, I missed you,” Tony confesses. “The Colonel isn’t exactly a great conversationalist.”
do it well,” Tony protests.
“I liked cinnamon before,” James says and looks over at Steve.
He looks up when he doesn’t hear anything coming from Steve.
“We can contact Rhodes.” Natasha offered, “He can scout instead.” Tony turned to her, grateful, “And once we’ve found it, all we need is to blow it up, right?”
“Yeah.” He steps forward again and this time Tony doesn’t back away, “Yeah, so come on. I’ll drive us.”
He barely reacts to the blood or to how his palm has now been sliced open, “The funeral, Steve!” He snaps, “For – for your funeral.”
"She said she wanted a superhero doll." Steve reminded him.
So far, he'd communicated with the Fantastic Four but had had no answer and he'd searched for the Giant Man that Steve had brought to their fight but hadn't gotten word there either. Fury was a no-show and SHIELD was down and he wasn't really sure who else to ask. He'd sent the signal to other Realms as per Thor's instructions and to other planets that Rocket suggested but either the message was shit or no one was around to receive it.
“It’s alright.” He says, despite their relationship being far from repair and there being many messes that still need fixing, “Don’t worry about it for now.”
Tony presses his lips together, “Are we – are we assembling?” He asks, confused, “Are we under attack?”
“Oh my God!” She drops with a cry, fumbling around his bleeding wrists for a pulse.
"Are you sure?" He thought to check anyway, looking about her room and seeing what looked like the aftermath of a small breakdown, "Did you need help tidying after this tornado?"
This cabin had originally been built to be a romantic or honeymoon get-away, for when he'd eventually brave a bond, but after everything that had happened in his life that hadn't become likely so this was as good a use as any. He dropped his bag on the kitchen counter and took his shoes off, pulling on the woolly socks that he'd left on the stool to walk over carpet toward the stairs.
“Excuse me?” Tony lifts an eyebrow.
He stretches out his hand, and Ms Lewis takes it, shaking it.
Steve fists the photos, bending them. “This, this means nothing. It means
Tony’s heart swells fit to bursting with love for this man, the man that Tony loves so obviously and so certainly and so fervently.
Steve purses his lips. “I don’t think we were meant to touch this, Colonel,” he says, honestly. “I saw what it did to the Nazis. On a purely scientific level, we couldn’t control the level of power that this gem has in order to ensure that it only ever worked in our interests. On a personal level, I shudder at the thought of someone using that gem at all.”
Tony snorts. “Yeah, we’ve tried that in the past. We usually end up having sex.”
Steve growls under his breath, and then, he’s surging forward, dragging Tony against him so that he knocks against all of that hard muscle. His mouth crashes down onto Tony, and Tony groans, opening up underneath his so easily, so willingly. Steve wraps his arms around Tony’s waist, his back, his shoulders, and then, they’re turning, and Steve is bearing him down onto the bed, crawling on top of him, his knees on either side of Tony’s hips, and removing his shirt.
, like I wasn’t good enough for that part of your life, that you didn’t want me around it because I cramped your style or something, and I hated myself over it.”
“Okay, exactly how am I
“Hurts, doesn’t it?”
Tony smiles at him. “Just need to catch my breath,” he tells him, as the pain in his throat starts to relax. “I’m old, remember?”
The price of his children is too big of a price, even faced with all of his low self-esteem and his daddy issues and his abusive ex-boyfriend issues.
“Fuck!” Tony shouts.
“We should be able to drop you right on the doorstep,” Tony promises.
A plane begins to make itself heard on the television, and Pepper walks closer to the television.
, Tony, fuck, why didn’t you tell me that you were feeling this way?” he whispers.
Peter nods, and Maushmi, on her own bed, sits up, her eyes with alarming intensity.
Don’t get him wrong, Tony loves his children, loves them more than sharks love blood, and there isn’t anything in this world that he wouldn’t do for them, but it’s hard, it’s hard being frankly a single parent to two children that are too much like him to have an easy life.
Tony lifts his hands high above his head to curl around the bedposts and arches his back, just as Steve fully seats his cock inside him. Tony sets his teeth on his lower lip, grinding down, hoping that he’ll be able to taunt Steve enough with an instinctive bid of friction to get him to wrap his hand around Tony’s cock, get him off that way.
Agent Carter folds her arms across her chest. “Are you familiar with the art of Jiu Jitsu, wherein your opponent’s size and momentum are used against him?”
“I’m so sorry,” Tony says, holding a hand to his heart. “I know I’m late. I hope they haven’t been waiting too long.”
Tony sticks his leg out of the tent, just as Bhim comes running past, and sure enough, it has the effect of sending him hurtling to the ground into the sand. Bhim, with dust all over his face, looks angrily toward the concealed culprit. At once, a flashing white grin splits his face, as he realizes that he’s looking up at Tony and Steve, splotched with soot and oil, hiding in the flap of a tent.
,” Tony grits out. “We’d just stopped HYDRA from poisoning Boston’s water supply. I’d hacked the security systems in the plant to shut down, so that you could sneak in and I blacked out the lighting in each room, so they’d never see them coming. I shut down all of the processing systems for enough time for you to get rid of them, and then, everything was good. You stopped the bad guys, and the citizens of Massachusetts only had momentary water problems, and it was a job well done for both of us. I got to feel like I wasn’t just the rich genius with first-world problems except for when the people around me, the pampered, gelatinous blue bloods that were the two percent of the world’s population and those who aspired to be like them, with all of their ideals and values and opinions, questioned whether I was the fucking cleaning lady’s son, because in what universe did Howard Stark have a fucking brown bastard as a kid. And you, you got to be the big man getting rid of the fucking Nazis that tortured you and brainwashed you and destroyed your life and made you into their knife in the dark. We both got something out of it-”
Title: we are stardust stories, my darling
“I didn’t
“Thank God. Where?”
, to have someone like Tony, a rich, virgin omega, throw himself at Steve for nothing, no price at all, no bite or bonding on the line, which alpha wouldn’t take him up on his offer?
“That sounds fine.”
, James. I can’t help but think that by staying here, talking about it with you, I’m cheating on him.”
He walks away.
“Yeah,” Tony’s gut churns, “that’s what I thought. Now, I can help Wanda. Find the kids; that’s what you can do for me right now. I’m calling the ambulance, and then, I’m calling Sam, and we’ll be gone before either of them get here.”
He starts with one, because one is the easiest, pressing it against his rim until he feels the muscle give away. He bears down against the stretch until he’s knuckle-deep and starts thrusting the finger inside himself, using plenty of lube to make the way slippery.
The scar was not pretty either, and the number of broken bones didn’t help, but Tony remained quiet in the medical wing just so Pepper would stop looking at him like he was going to break at any moment.
Looking back, Steve knows that he could have done everything differently, from the beginning, but dealing with his own mistakes, the only thing Steve did was swallow his own morals, accept the feeling of doing something deeply wrong and then continued on.
"Bucky."
So he thought that maybe he should die too.
Tony was also helping Peter a little with other questions of a more scientific nature, helping him in building his new uniform and trying to teach the youngster some tricks. He was smart by nature, but he didn't quite match what Tony was at that age. Peter was one of the best of his class, sure, but a natural genius that could have graduated college? Tony wasn't sure, but it was probably because the boy didn't put much intent in it, he wanted to fight, to be on the battlefield, but if he didn't have the technology to help him, it would be a lot harder, so Tony pushed.
And then she turned away and left, making one thing clear: they weren't supposed to try to contact Tony.
Not because he was strong or something like that, he was pretty sure that it was not the way things works because he saw it himself, not in him of course, but with Rhodey’s wife, with Pepper’s mom, even with Bruce, it was not about having a strong mind, but he also knew that trauma could help, a lot. That's the reason why he firmly believed that if he had had this disease, he would have had it years before, with all the history of an abusive father, negligent mother, their early death, countless kidnappings, death threats, torture, alien invasion, and everything.
But not all the love in the world would keep the evil thoughts from invading his mind.
He makes sure that Peppers know it, she offers him to change to a new doctor and he clarified that he will hate all the therapists.
It was not an easy task, Peter was young and had superpowers and Tony was already old, the symptoms of the bond rejection weighing on his body that weakened more and more each day, not to mention the side effects of the drugs for his heart and the lack of a healthy diet for at least 2 decades.
The relationship between the two did not seem exactly functional at the moment either. Shuri had helped Bucky get his head back on track, and despite the guilt, he almost reminded him of Bucky from before, much quieter and with shadows of guilt in his eyes, but he was there, under all that pain, changed, evolved, but still Bucky.
When the government decided that Tony should rejoin the Avengers to try to improve their public image — apparently fighting a criminal who is against the government and that was trying to protect a hydra assassin did wonders to Tony publicity as iron man—
Training with him helped to distract himself from the constant feeling of being sick, as if every second he could feel his body getting weaker, the headaches more frequent and strong, like it was going to split in half, the heart more fragile.
Back then he didn't want to even think about it, the feeling in his chest, in his stomach. He didn't want to recognize it, to recognize how miserably he had failed Bucky, he couldn't.
"Look" replied Bucky "I don't know the guy, and probably out of everyone here I am the one he hates the most."
Tony had tried very hard to make up for the mistakes of his past, but apparently, fate had already waited long enough and his second chance had not been enough, he hadn’t saved enough people and for that reason he would die a slow and painful death, gradually getting sick, the symptoms taking little by little his body until finally, he would die, alone.
But then Siberia happened and Steve did what he did.
Even with the medicine that made him feel like he needed to sleep for ten years, his anxiety was in its maximum and Tony really considered to suit up and fly through the window, but he knew he couldn't.
But Bucky never said anything.
Hope you enjoy :)
Tony was not ready.
Not just because his parents didn’t love him, but because his soulmates were dead before Tony was even born.
Tony wanted to say no, wanted to cry, wanted to scream, wanted to shoot the man in the face and make a hole in his face with one of his propulsion jets.
He told Pepper that this was his last wish, to make up for his sins, even if just a little, even if just to die knowing that he did just a little more. It would never compensate the people that died from his weapons, but he would try.
Sometimes Tony would ask himself, alone in his room, staring de ceiling because he couldn't sleep, if it wasn't good for them, if they wouldn't feel relieved, but he wouldn't entertain these thoughts for much time, he couldn't or he would brake because they ware everything that Tony had.
Ok, first, I need you guys to understand one thing: English is not my first language, so my vocabulary is not the best and sometimes I won't achieve the feeling that I want to, not just that, but maybe some phases will be very hard to understand, so if you are reading and you are like "oh my, what is this" tell me so I can correct it o/
“Your rooms remain as they were when you left.” she began “Some areas have been upgraded, but Vision will explain each one to you. The main thing is in the training area, so don't go in there without Vision until you learn to work with everything. As you signed in the Accords, there is no restriction on your leaving the house, but knowing the government as I do I think that they probably have agents hanging around the area, so I recommend that you don't leave the Compound for a few days. Agent Barton, your family has already been removed from the security shelter and is now in the old Avengers tower, they should be moved here tomorrow ”
Steve knew that one of the answers was guilt.
Thinking of it, maybe yeah, maybe he was depressed back then if the only reason that he could think about to be alive was to prove something to his dad, the guy that he hated for his hole life. Maybe his therapist was right.
His Bucky.
The mood between them, the Rogues, got heavier after that, as if they couldn't deal with their mistakes.
The adrenaline of fighting in scenarios created by Friday with nanotechnology with Peter was somewhat invigorating.
The kid would finish his training smiling like he could hug Tony, but he never tried, and Tony never asked.
Tony smiled at her and told her it was not her decision to make.
“Sometimes I wish you were my soulmate”
"Take off the armor, what are you?"
Tony, the one who risked his life over and over, even though Steve said no because it was too risky, just so he could save as many people as possible.
“No, Barnes.” began Natasha “I understand your logic, but we made a lot of mistakes. You are another story, you were not to blame for what you did and even if Tony doesn't like it, he knows it. Us? We are to blame for everything we did, some more than others, but we are. ” She stopped for a second, sitting next to Clint she looked Bucky in the eye “The first time I met him he was dying and even then I got carried away by his mask. It was simple, to let him withdraw. And then he proved me wrong again and again and somehow we formed a kind of partnership. He is the one who understands me most probably and… I betrayed him in the worst way, and he knows it, and I know it, and there is nothing we can do about it, because everything that I said to him… I said because I wanted to hurt him, and I did.”
Rhodey was also very present for a while, but Tony thought it was because of the prostheses, with which he was still getting used to, then Tony find out that he also knew, always knew. Since MIT.
The cold never went away, it lessened, but it was always there, even in the sunlight, reminding him of his biggest sin, his biggest mistake in the huge list of unforgivable mistakes he had made during his life.
“Tony, you are my best friend,” he declared, his eyes filling with tears. The last time Tony saw him like this was when he was rescued from Afghanistan and it just made Tony feel guilty “And I never left your side, not when you were drunk, not when you were dating the dumbest people in the world, not when you were making weapons or when you stopped doing it, it’s not now that I’m going to leave you alone ”.
The Avengers pardon came a week later, with conditions and calls from a Rhodey who wouldn't stop to listen, just inform and disconnect the connection as soon as he said what he had to say. Every time this happened, everyone in the conference room cowered a little more in themselves.
Tony said nothing.
Tony stopped talking to Pepper.
Well, Tony thought, it was a cruel way to die, it fits exactly with his story.
Siberia was a place that marked Tony, it registered on his head, like some kind of tattoo where the only thing he could see was Rogers planting the shield on his chest with all the strength of a super-soldier, the strength to hold a helicopter, right in his chest, breaking his ribs and slicing through his chest.
The one who had proved Steve wrong more than once.
They never listened.
Bucky would be mad at him but he would understand, because while Steve walked, shivering, he would let his tears fall and Bucky would look at him like he understood.
However, even after Ultron, Tony hoped that Steve, not Steve, Rogers, would have at last some respect for him.
So, again, he made what his dad hat teach him not to, and cried himself to sleep.
Books, homework, his school grades should be impeccable and he needed to go to all his activities.
“It's not that simple” began Clint, who was sitting in front of Bucky “As far as we know he forgave us, legally, yes, which is already a big step, but as far as Rhodey has hinted, he will only join the team again because of public matter ”.
The pain was still there, guilt, for different reasons, but for the same person.
"Tony" she started again, her voice taking on a serious tone as she rested her hand on his shoulder "you need to tell him, you know that".
None of them asked why Tony Stark was reportedly hospitalized for three weeks after Steve left him in Siberia.
Tony never told anyone that she put a vision in his head, and if it depended on the two of them, Tony would die with that secret kept deep in his heart, along with his many other secrets.
Because see Steve, in all his glory, knowing that he would never be good enough for him, hurt, but he knew that seeing him with his other soulmate would tear Tony apart, in a way or another, because Barnes would have what Tony couldn’t. Because Barnes would love Steve and Steve would love him back.
Good.
Rhodey was in charge of handling the Avengers' return to the compound and Tony thanked him for that, because he knew that Rhodey was hurting too. His legs were still a burden in his thoughts, even if Tony had made the best prosthesis anyone could get, Rhodey still blamed Sam — and Tony still blamed himself.
That helped him adjust, that showed him the movies he knew he would like.
But he didn't cry that day, because Stark man are made of iron and it means that Howard was such a motherfucker that even if Tony knew better, he couldn't let himself cry, it was a weakness, he knew that it wasn't, but at the same time, he believed that it was.
“In the dark.” Steve repeats and Sam stands.
He’s not coming back.
“It was too soon.” Hank agrees and Steve glares at him, “It’s for Stark’s own good.” He snaps in response to that and Steve snorts.
“Yeah no shit.” She sniffs, wiping her nose with the back of her hand, “But you were friends once. Doesn’t that mean anything?”
"Well in my day, that would have earned a slap." Steve noted lightly and Tony scoffed.
“No.” Steve gestures to the bedroom, “You’re going there.” After a moment, Tony listens, slowly walking toward the bedroom and stepping into it. He looks back once, tears in his eyes.
"Or he blames himself?" Tony tried, wishing he hadn't spoken at all, but she shook her head.
Tony had kissed him and he’d pulled away. That’s what Tony had used to see that he was real. He’d believed Steve doesn’t want him.
paid for it,” Hank says. Steve clenches his fists at his side.
She hummed, "Well it took some prompting, but you finally let it all out, huh." Her tone had softened and he pushed her away.
that, that's all I meant."
“This isn’t poor baby Stark, Steve,” Hank snaps, clearly stung, “His breakdowns get people killed.”
“That’s okay, Mr Rogers,” She yawned again, “I know you’re very busy.”
Giving him a long, long look, she sat back down and stared at him for a moment before eventually blowing out her cheeks and very visibly deciding to tell him, "I found Clint."
Jess looks at him, “Your responsibility.” She repeats, monotone.
“We?” Steve pants and Tony nods.
"Perfect." He stood to stretch, clearing his throat, before abruptly deciding
“Monday.” He guesses anyway.
He wakes to a dull, orange glow, and groans when he realises that it’s his lamp. Sitting up to switch it off, he suddenly sees Tony on his knees beside the sofa, watching him, and he prides himself on not screaming in shock.
"Then what is the problem?" He started folding again, "If it could be true? Isn't it better to have something magical to believe in?"
He requests access upon arrival and it’s almost instantaneous, which makes him believe that someone has clearly been expecting him. He steps through the elevator and into the communal area, seeing Logan, Luke, Peter, Sam and Hank sitting over the sofas. He feels ambushed and scowls.
Her sobbing calms in the hour it takes for Peter to get here and Steve spends it sat at the kitchen counter, staring at his hands.
Maybe a visit to the tower really is long overdue.
"Was I rude?" She asked, sounding confused, "I'm sorry."
Tony gaped at her, and suddenly he knew he was going to snap. This was it, and he was too exhausted to even blow up properly.
They leave as a group, Tony helped into the back of the van and belted in. He lets them take him, numb and quiet, and Steve watches them go.
His tablet is beside him and he searches pictures of the mansion idly, his heart panging at the resplendent view some of the photos captured. Then he sees the burnt versions, their ruined home, and he switches the tablet off.
"I know that," Anna scoffed, "Other donkeys obviously like to look at donkeys." He grinned, shaking his head, "What? What's funny?"
Steve looks at the bedside table. He sees his kitchen knife and falls to his knees as well.
“Janet’s death isn’t on Tony,” Steve reminds him and Hank shakes his head.
"Yeah." He rasped, wiping at his face, "No luck though." He put the transponder down and sniffed, "You feeling any better?"
Tony?”
“Alright then,” He announced, “Tomorrow, we’ll go out in twos to search for this ship and then radio in when it’s been found. Bruce, Tony – if you can, maybe build something that can destroy it. Blow it up.”
He takes his bike, knowing the route by heart and avoiding traffic on the way, his head spinning as he goes. The mansion has been barred to the public for being a hazard since the fire and he’d had an altercation with Tony within it as well, which hasn’t done its foundation any good.
Now, the six of them all lived together in this bunker, using each of Tony's satellites to try and figure out where the hell Thanos had hidden himself. If they found him, they could fight him. And if they fought him, they could kill him.
