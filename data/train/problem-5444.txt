”A harpoon,” he announced. “I need a harpoon or, at least, a long spear.”
If he only had six weeks left to play in Moondoor, he wanted to do so at Dean’s side.
stronger, Cassie. And that’s a problem.  You’ve lost control of your wolf ever since he arrived.  Letting it sneak off in the night was bad enough. What happened yesterday could have been a total disaster. I can see how you think Gan has been a positive influence on Sam.  I don’t agree he’s a positive influence on
to me or something?”
“But it’s a precious heirloom,” Dey’n argued.
“Which is?” a deep voice rumbled from behind their table.
In truth, Crowley hadn’t actually started playing Moondoor with the intention of turning it into a perverted (and highly profitable) sex club.
in this instance. Would it be unconscionable to say 'no' or irresponsible to say 'yes'?
Naturally, that also meant in game-terms they weren’t worth much XP.  Even the largest was only offering 8 and the majority of them only a lowly 5.  Still, that added up pretty quickly when you multiplied it by hundreds.
Less than ten minutes after the RRE goons had eviscerated her apartment and her life, Charlie stormed out of the building with her normal impetuosity, her head high, in a determined search for answers and she hailed down a cab to take her to the airport.
Even if a group of Wildlings had hunted this area almost ‘bare’ before moving on, still there would be at least some manner of sea life remaining in this place other than barnacles and seaweed. Besides, stripping an area of fish without worrying whether enough breeding stock remained was the way of the Hu, not the Mer. Even in Atlan, where centuries of refusing to send hunting parties to fish far from the City had severely restricted the inhabitants’ diets before the arrival of John, the larders had only ever lacked variety rather than quantity because those species that lived within easy distance had always been farmed with careful respect. So, no, the absence of fish here couldn’t be blamed upon the Wildlings, in his opinion. Even if he was wrong, that didn’t explain why they hadn’t at least left the varieties behind that Mer found unpalatable.
“But you said…”
mindless because, despite being an uncontrolled mob, they still all swarmed directly towards Dean and Abaddon.
“If you don’t know how War Parties work, you’re clearly a newbie yourself,” he mocked.
The woman sniffed rudely, examining Dean like he was a bug and then offering a sneer that clearly dismissed him as though he was no more than pond life, “Come, James,” she said, reaching out a hand towards Jimmy. “Time to leave your little hooligan friends to play in the dirt together and come home.”

what we need.”
Her pretty face contorted with anger as the spittle ran down her cheek. “The name’s Meg, actually,” she said, deliberately twisting the blade in Ash’s body until he paled with agony. He still clenched his jaw and refused to give her the satisfaction of voicing his pain, though.
By mid-afternoon of that second day, when the storm cleared away completely to reveal a clear, cloud-free sky, it did occur to him that ‘naming’ the animals was the least of his worries. He ought to take the opportunity to immediately pack up and leave. But his sense of urgency had faded. He was still working his way through detailing the list of jobs the house required, a task which had already caused his eyes to throb with the threat of an imminent headache, and he decided there wasn’t any immediate rush to leave after all.
Because no matter how strong or brave or defiant Dey’hahn was when confronted by the drunken student-types who constantly attempted to demand his attention in the club, confronted by the physical strength of a fully mature, sober Qui biological Dominant, Dey’hahn probably wouldn’t stand a chance and Meg was damned sure the peculiar sense-tingling sensations she experienced from Alastair’s secretive companions were caused by Dominant pheromones.

“What about monsters,” he asked, suddenly rethinking
Two condemned prisoners marching towards a scaffold couldn’t possibly have looked more miserable than the two Betas. Though it was a toss-up whether they were more disgruntled about their lack of suits or their lack of guns; Dean had made it perfectly clear that weapons were forbidden for this excursion.
to. Omegas do as they will. If Gan decides he prefers Betas, that’s unfortunate - and a bit odd - but it’s his choice to make and we’d respect it entirely.”
It was fortuitous he’d taken the initiative to clean the hall because, after sharing breakfast with Lolly and the rest of the gang on that fourth day on the island, he’d followed the dog out into the kitchen garden and, some way beyond the rows of cabbages, he’d discovered a large shed containing a surprising amount of DIY tools and equipment which included several rolls of sandpaper and a couple of dozen large tubs of wood stain.
from which the name ‘White Lake’ had been derived and book them a post NASCAR meal at a place called Bubba’s BBQ.
It was easy, on the whole, to anticipate the direction in which they would leap. Easy to herd them, like sheep through a shearing chute, in the direction the Auditor required. Easy to cut off their options until only one obvious path remained open. The path he needed them to take.
And neither, it seemed, did his Alpha.
“Your wife is very talented,” Cas mumbled, after a painfully long silence.
“GET DOWN,” Hortlan yelled at Dean. “Stand still you idiot.”
Hell, pink wasn’t that bad a color anyway and maybe Atticat was the one thing Cas needed. Would it really hurt Dean to share the cat?
“That’s why we brought two baskets,” Viktor announced quickly, handing Dean the one he was carrying.
“Honestly?  I had no idea. As far as I was concerned, he was just another pretty. But perhaps your mother somehow knew. She did have a way about her sometimes that was more than a little otherworldly. It was Rowena who chose him over every other available Mariposa in the Universe. Rowena who insisted I spent far more money on him than Naomi wanted me to spend. I was in the dog house for a long time over that one,” Carolus snorted.
woman and child.
“Where the fuck am I?” he demanded.
She landed in front of him, saw the lack of an inverted devil’s trap, her eyes glinted with wicked humor and then…
“I’m not,” Castiel stated firmly.
”I have never had occasion to eat dog, hot or otherwise,” Castiel growled repressively.
The Archivist smiled.
“Jesus Christ,” Jimmy moaned.
Abaddon, I never got the opportunity to check what level she’d reached before hitting 200. But since Magnus was level 70 and she didn’t have the benefit of a war party, it’s fair to assume she must have been pretty much the same level and she didn’t get there by making nice with people.”
Still, Bobby had reluctantly accepted him as one of his R8’s because, asshole or not, Gordon was good at playing the game.  Also, Gordon thrived when his self-importance was fed by the hero-worship of newbies. So, in many ways, although being an R8 had given Gordon a way to bully smaller players it had, more often than not, actually brought out the best in him instead as he strove to win the adulation of new players.
“Yeah,” Ash agreed. “The game mechanics here are pretty fucked up.  Usually you can judge pretty accurately what you’re facing in a Quest because the risk/reward ratio in Moondoor is always completely consistent.  But not today. Those Wendigos were of a strength that we shouldn’t have faced at all for a Quest of this type. Besides, nothing that strong should have appeared until the penultimate level of
“You’re on a roll, pup,” Bobby waved a hand graciously, “Carry on, tell me the rest of this grand plan of yours.”
“I think it’s just a fond nickname because Cain doesn’t have any children and Dean has never renamed the shop,” Eileen countered. “Though sometimes I can see a resemblance. I think the important thing is that Cain acts more like Dean’s father than your own father ever did. There is a real and genuine bond between them regardless of blood.”
It was that thought, as much as Gan’s look of hopeful anticipation, that made him take a bite.
“No,” he said. “Listen to me, Charlie. I know him. That knight. I know him in real life.”
Castiel found second-hand books both an irresistible lure and a source of sadness. He couldn’t understand how anyone could read a book and then just trade it in. For him books were like old friends, worlds he would revisit over and over like returning to vacation in a favourite place. So secondhand books always felt to him like faithful wives brutally discarded for the thrill of a younger mistress.
Since the last thing Dean needed was to

significantly higher than 1050, in true terms it really is. So in my book that should have been enough to kick her ass anyway. But add whatever he got for killing the angels to his 1090, he should have been able to do it with his hands tied behind his back.”
Yes, he decided.
Dean and Atticat had lived in peaceful naked harmony for several years, ever since the battered cat had turned up unexpectedly one day, sitting on his doorstep like a much-wounded soldier returning home from a long campaign, and had demanded shelter and sustenance.
“He decided to give up,” Dean said.
“You’re just going to listen to him?” Charlie demanded angrily.
“And it’s a tourist town,” Gabriel allowed. “Even if the locals are probably a bunch of interbred hicks, you might get a bit of hunky summer-loving,” he suggested, with a waggle of his eyebrows. “Perhaps if you diligently practiced a ‘smile’ rather than a frown, you might actually get lucky for a change.”
that he was a virtual intelligence who was completely unfamiliar with human interactions.
But the truth was that Castiel had, over the last six months, become the most important person in Jimmy’s life.  His best friend. He understood now why Sam and Gabriel could not bear to part from each other, even though their love was – they claimed - not of a physical nature.
“What incoming messages?”
terrifying.
It was
with searching for the locations of the other knights. Sending a team of demons out on a wide search pattern throughout Moondoor would be far more effective than attempting to physically locate the knights ourselves.”
For the first time, Castiel had a true sense of a far greater power than himself having a hand in everything. Whether that power was Pontus or Gaia or Fate or some other denizen entirely. Fate, for lack of a better name, was not about the experiences of a single individual or even of a couple. It dealt with a vast tapestry of interlocking threads of which he and Dean were merely two minor stitches.
“I see why,” Loki answered thoughtfully.  “But that still doesn’t explain why you are lying to him.”
“Seriously, though,” Benny said. “He’s been stuck here for a long time, just herding the sheep for the townsfolk, and he wants to come with us. Likes the idea of having an ‘adventure’.”
“I’ve got EVERY right,” Sam yelled back. “I’m your brother. You think I’m going to sit back and watch you get killed in that damned thing?”
But Dean had options.
so well.”
Gan had stated clearly that he wished to be left alone to ‘think’.
“The situation is not comparable,” Dean countered, letting his irritation creep into his tone. “You aren’t just hiring a live-in ‘caretaker’. Whether I can survive in the property's current environment isn’t the issue, is it? The contract is for

No details whatsoever.
How could he not?
“That’s a remarkably generous attitude,’ Castiel said. “In your position, I doubt I would feel so sanguine.”
My phone's dead. Long story. Anyway, don't worry. I'll call you Monday.
Even so, “Are you Anna Milton?” Sam demanded, as he thrust the hydraulic spreader between the first set of bars and activated it. The tool slammed against the metal, straining and whining, and the bars shuddered as the concrete of the window frame began to slowly crumble. Too slowly. As he’d been warned, the hydraulic pressure of these particular Jaws of Life were only intended to extract people from crushed cars, not solid metal prison-type bars.
Dean agreed grimly. “
Castiel nodded miserably. “So, then I thought perhaps I should go with my original plan. Pretend to be Null. Attempt to make him fall in love with me for who I really am, without all the mess of our designations getting between us. And then, when he knows I am completely sincere, then admit the truth? But isn’t that what that Michael Hortlan did to him? Deliberately deceived him in exactly the same way?”
At least he
“What’s happened?” he demanded urgently, as soon as he’d closed and locked the door behind him.
“So awful,” she sympathized. “I understand tetrodotoxin has no known antidote, though, so even had you found them sooner I am sure there is nothing that could have been done anyway. Please do not blame yourself in any way.”
“We probably don’t want to know,” Penelope said, with a shudder of distaste.
He couldn’t be bitten. He knew that. His
…. MONSTER AXE HIT YOU FOR 240 HP ….
During those moments, Castiel flew to Dean, completely ignoring everyone else, arriving even as Abaddon was staggering backward with a face full of cat.  His eyes, blazing cerulean fire met Dean’s eyes, demonically black but filled with pain.
Naomi N’Vak, as Carolus’s wife, was the legal ‘mother’ of all of his offspring.  Even Rowena Ll’ell’s bastard son, Castiel.
Dey’n smirked at him. The Mariposa didn’t even pretend to be coy or hesitant.  He was supremely gorgeous and knew it, so he didn’t bother prevaricating. “My bed is more than big enough for two, Cas. Time to break my dry spell, I think.”
“Saddle up,” Dean said, with excessive cheerfulness. “One of the demons came through. We have the location of a knight.”
“You said it yourself, Deano. You told Cassie the advertisement spoke to you. Like it was written specifically for you. Well, it was. Or at least anyone of your descent. I should clarify that it wasn’t the only advertisement posted. There were others. Most simply offering a caretaker position in some form or other - since, obviously, we never required anyone to actually manually restore the property - but each advertisement was aimed to appeal specifically to each Harrison descendent in your generation in the hope that one of you would contain the magic that would both draw you to this place and enable you to become the new gatekeeper.”
That war always has actual winners and losers. That victory can be absolute. So, yeah, if either of
“Then, accepting that as a fact,” Jimmy retorted, “I don’t understand your stubbornness over my own situation. Is it that your cynicism only extends to religious institutions, so I still offend your personal beliefs?”
said.  “Looks like you need to sit down, Tiger. Come on.  There’s a crappy coffee machine over by the car hire desk, let’s go sit and talk, huh? Looks like we both need caffeine and conversation.”
Castiel quickly told him about Meg approaching him in Infernum, about how he had somehow unerringly (if slightly belatedly) located Dey’hahn in an alleyway behind the club, how he had arrived just when the Polilla’s valiant efforts to defend himself had ultimately come to naught, how he had been filled with an almost insane fury at the sight of the strange Dominant holding Dey’hahn by the throat like a predator. How the sight of Dey’hahn’s injuries had caused something dark and primal inside himself to take over.
“Not a totally unreasonable proposition,” Castiel countered. “Whilst I am proud of our ancestors embracing the evolution of the Tsalun from intelligent beasts to a unique fully sapient species, whereas the evolution of secondary races on most planets resulted in conflict, war or even genocide, there is an undoubted truth that the Qui declined more rapidly as the Tsalun ascended. In many ways, we have become relics on our own planet.  The Qui are a race just waiting to fade into history.  In a few centuries more, Tsaluna will probably belong purely to the Tsalun and the Qui will be no more.  I cannot blame a few brave souls from choosing to start anew without the Tsalun as competition for resources.”
For one thing, she’d completely forgotten that New York was a State, not just a City.  Although the Krushnics owned a huge brownstone in NYC from where they conducted most of their business with the Dobycha - where, indeed, she had first been reunited with Castiel, the Alpha of All - the brownstone was their place of

of us will be happy."
The bar was almost deserted, just a scattering of players sitting around tables drinking beer. All of whom glared at Dean with dark, distrustful eyes as he followed Ash inside.  He activated his in-game interface to be safe and quickly checked their levels. No one bigger than level 22, so none of them were likely to kick off with a player as high as Ash in the room.
He’d taken Mortimer Blake’s advice to leave his laptop behind since it was company property and fitted with a tracker device. So he couldn’t use Skype.  Neither could he simply call from a cellphone since he didn’t have one. He was still awaiting the issue of his new iPhone by HR.

“Sorry to disturb you, Professor Ll’ell. I was hoping I might request a further extension for my latest assignment. As you can see, I’ve had somewhat of an accident.”
“A single Praevalen can’t defend a whole colony from pirates,” Dean said, although he immediately kicked himself for saying so.
“Dean. Uh. Dean hugged me,” Castiel said, his expression cool but his eyes shifting awkwardly away from the cat’s penetrating glare.
“No, before,” Dean clarified. “I got her down to 45% with the silver knife but then she got a lucky bite in. This fucking armour doesn’t protect my arms or thighs at all. It only took one bite on my leg and I could feel it immediately, the whole Alpha thing in my head, telling me to submit to her.  I was one minute from completely wolfing out and running upstairs to attack

“But she’s the one who’s been causing the safety protocols on the immersion tanks to fail, isn’t she?” Sam demanded.
“You FUCKER. Why the hell didn’t you show those before?” he snarled at the screen.
“Sam’s enthusiasm for yenta-ing is only exceeded by his complete lack of common sense,” Eileen sighed. “Dean, I suggest you simply write this Cas a note explaining that the cat is not a stray. I am sure he never intended to overstep or take ‘possession’. Even you need to admit that Atticat looks in need of rescue. Invite Cas to come over to your house to discuss the situation civilly.”
And it was only as that knowledge snapped into his mind that he knew that his decision had already been made.

“Before or after you’d asked him about two boys?” Charlie asked. “You told me he was being evasive and protective.  Maybe, having realized how little you knew, he deliberately played along just to mislead you. Maybe I need to adjust my search parameters again.”
Ellen bustled over, clearing glasses and replenishing Dean’s own drink.

“Sure there is. It’s in New York State,” Ash said, helpfully.
Not that he really thought their healing rate was going to make much difference at this stage of the dungeon.  Neither he nor Charlie had been able to fight at all against the Wendigos and the problem hadn’t really been their health bars.  Sure, being injured didn’t help but the truth was they were simply totally out of their league in this dungeon run.
It was too late.

“Oh, I don’t think he minds, really. He won’t hear a word said against you. He definitely seems to be very taken by you.”
Yes, he told himself.
Dean replied.  “And I want that for you. I want it for Jimmy too.  I want both of you to experience a full and complete life together. I would only be a yoke around your necks, holding you back.”
Dean could practically see the white wolf’s eye roll, before it finally chuffed impatiently and headed out of the thicket, leaving the black wolf scrambling to catch up again.
“Not that we have any idea what getting ‘corrupted’ even means,” Dean pointed out.
Jimmy’s mouth twitched into a pleased, shy smile. “Thank you,” he said. “I did mean what I said earlier, though. I fully intend to return, regardless of what truth is revealed to me tomorrow. I also wish to believe I will be brave enough to share my personal secret with you regardless. The latter, however, I cannot promise.”
real, albeit only a computer program. What was it Donald Woolfe had claimed about the Reaper? That it was such an evolved A.I. that it believed it was a ‘God’ and had locked Richard Roman out of his own creation? Yeah. That was it. Though, having experienced Afterlife for himself, Sam wasn’t sure Roman had missed much by the exclusion.  This virtual world was not a fun place to be.
“Hey, lady,” Dean interrupted, moving staunchly to Jimmy’s side and slapping a supportive arm around his shoulders. “Your son is an honest-to-god hero. You should show him some respect.”
Bobby laughed. “Like to think so,” he agreed, “but I reckon he still calls the shots in his own way. You two are a case in point, ain’tchya?”

They left the Roadhouse before logging out of the game, complying with the general polite construct that it was ‘rude’ to simply disappear in front of other players, since characters winking in and out of existence tended to jar people’s ability to totally immerse themselves in the virtual world.

the news. Everybody in Wolfsbane knew what Dean was. The unbelievable truth had raced through the Wolfkin, carried by a thrilled initial excitement that had already turned to angry mutterings of dread.
“Sadly they got all weird again about the Omega thing.  Apparently they didn’t object to the idea of throwing their damned
”In this case? It’s a tomb. A pretty, multi-million dollar mausoleum built especially for a pretty Omega named Gan Winchester. So tragic, huh? Castiel Krushnic spent years building that thing to stand in perfect memorial to his dead mate. Maybe he wants you to see it with your own eyes before he kills you.” O’Toole’s eyes glinted with genuine, if dark, humor.
The door burst open and the tallest man Castiel had ever seen walked in, all hair and teeth, saying, “Eileen says she loves you but if you don’t close up right now she’s giving your dinner to the dog.”
And the voice that drowned out all the others when he reached a state of almost total inebriation was so suicidal that Caine was sure the only reason Nick was alive at all was that he only gave into it completely when he was too drunk to actually do anything about it.
But no. That couldn’t be the explanation because although a rogue female Beta could have mated with any other rogue Beta and birthed Henry outside of the pack,  the next generation of pups would still have been born feral. John would have been born locked inside a wolf-form. The virus could not survive

father. It breaks my heart that he’ll never be able to witness the progression of my career. I so wanted to make him proud of me,” he choked a little on the words, though not for the reason Nigel imagined.
Dean’s attitude to his own wolf had always been casual. Either it was safe for the wolf to come out or it wasn’t. The equation was simple.  Sadly, the safe times had been considerably less frequent than the unsafe times, but Dean had never purposefully suppressed it for any reason
“Don’t be deliberately obtuse,” Chuck snapped. “You know I’m not ready yet. It’s far too soon for Sam to be in play. This is going to mess up everything.”
“That book. It’s good. First in a series. But each book works as a stand-alone too. ‘Sides, Jeff’s probably got a copy of the others somewhere. If not, I can lend them to you.” Dexter paused, and scratched the back of his neck a little awkwardly, “I mean, if you’d like. We don’t have a library in town so we all pretty much just use Jeff as a book-exchange but personally I kinda like to keep hold of my favorite books, so I can re-read ‘em again.”
Inside dozens of motel rooms and surrounding houses, humans shivered in their sleep, tossed and turned in their beds, their dreams invaded by primeval memories of their millennia as prey. The dogs living in nearby properties whimpered in their sleep, torn between fear and distant memories of times when their ancestors would have followed that cry, not huddled from it in terror. Their fur rippled and their flanks heaved as the black wolf’s cry said
Oddly, it was the very way Dean deliberately attempted to minimise any suggestion of his own cleverness that convinced Jimmy that Dean was definitely a character who shouldn’t be underestimated.

“Look,” he said, his tone firm but calm. “I understand you’re talking to me from a position of love, Sam, so I’m gonna put aside the fact you’re talking to me like I’m a moron. Let’s just agree to disagree, okay? What we both DO agree on is the fact that Moondoor is currently a dangerous place for human players. The thing is, you think it’s only dangerous for people playing the game whilst using the Gen 9 rigs. I have reason to believe it is ANY human player unless the A.I. named Amara is erased from the game because the safety protocols of the entire game have been affected by her. And I know you’re a stubborn-ass mule, Sam, but I can’t see you pulling this routine on a couple hundred thousand people to convince them to stop playing.
”Oh,” Cas sighed sadly, his scent souring.
”That you’re
By the time the disastrous decision had been made to incorporate Amara into the game it was already the Fall of 1992. RRE had already expanded to a team of almost 300 employees, many of them marketing, promotional and administrative personnel, and the company had already begun an aggressive campaign of advertising for the proposed launch date in early 1993.  There simply wasn't time to return to the beginning again.  Even if RRE could have survived the negative publicity of cancelling their advertised launch date, they were terrified the delay might allow their competitors to launch first. Woolf, ignoring the fact the situation had been created by his own poor judgement, threatened to remove his investment entirely.
Even if the idea filled him with dread.  It was time to bring his own A-game to the party too and if that meant giving out his identity and location so that Jimmy could send Charlie the Gen 8 rig then he needed to do so. And if that also meant Jimmy needed to be told about his accident, well, Dean was pretty sure it would be a deal-breaker on any potential relationship but better, maybe, to rip that band-aid off sooner rather than later anyway.
“Oh go on, tell me who it is,” she said. “I pinky swear I’ll never break your confidence.”

But that was taking the ‘easy’ way out.

In essence, after the incident with John, the force of the blow had caused a traumatic brain injury, which Dean already knew. The only severely complicating factor was the fact that Sam was comatose. They wouldn’t be able to tell the extent of the damage until Sam was awake and cognizant again. But, the good news was, although Sam had not fully woken up yet, the possibility of him not waking up, the godforsaken “
Dean couldn’t help but let out a low laugh.
Claire thought it was her duty to make fun of him and remind him of how old he was.
“Everyone here seems to have gone through so much,” Dean whispered.
“Yeah, blood pressure, heart rate, checking the brace around your chest, things like that. We usually do it daily, but given your medical history, we’re going to do it twice a day, at least for the first week.”
Dean has never made and inhaled toast and coffee so fast in his life.
But, Dean knew that the timing was bad.
“Is that a metaphor?” Castiel asked, eyeing Dean wearily. Dean made a non-committal sound while he turned his body slightly so that he could face him more directly.
“No, stay,” Sam said as he watched Dean’s reaction to Cas’ intended departure. Sam knew something was going on but was still, evidently, confused. There would be time to explain everything later. They had time.

“I have missed you all,” Jack admits, eyes darting automatically to the place at the table Cas usually sat and his shoulders sagged visibly. Dean slung his arm across Jack’s back and hugged him lightly as he looked at the empty space that had caught the kid’s attention.
Castiel also checked in with Jody a couple of times throughout the day. She was exhausted, as to be expected, and a little emotional. So, to distract her, Castiel asked about Alex-what she was like, her favorite bands, movies, what her friends were like. Jody, like Dean, seemed to be most in her element when talking about the child she was raising.
“No,” Jack says simply, “Think of the grace as stitches, Dean’s soul healed a long time ago, so he no longer needs it.”
his lips never leaving the stranger’s neck. Sam had waited outside on a bench near the vending machine with a chemistry book in his lap. When Dean arrived about thirty minutes later, he gently clapped the back of Sam’s head and told him to get into the car and that they had to go meet John in the next town over. Dean had said nothing but had given Sam a meaningful look. And Sam knew what it meant, “Don’t tell Dad. Don’t say anything.” So, he hadn’t, and Dean never brought it up again.
Thank you so much for reading, I appreciate each and every one of you!
Dean had bitched about it for a while and had spent the past forty-eight hours trying to get out of this commitment. He had to admit, however, even if it was only to himself, that these extreme mood swings and violently demanding emotions were highly foreign to him. He wasn’t sure what they meant or how to deal with them, and going somewhere until he could get a grasp on himself seemed like a good idea. There was no way he could be like this in front of Sammy. Couldn’t let his younger brother observe his slow descent into something he did not recognize.
Have a great week ya'll! :)
Castiel took a long sip and the caffeine sang in his veins.  He gulped down another couple of swallows before turning to Gabriel. “You have my full attention.”
how much he enjoyed the sound.
“I need to find Amara.”
Oh, god, he was really going to do this.
“They’re my parents,” Castiel offered meekly, his voice muffled.
very much alive: color painted his features, he twitched restlessly in his sleep and Dean could very clearly hear his breathing.
These thoughts were more frequent as he contemplated the situation with his family. Dean didn’t always know what to say, in all honesty.  He almost never knew exactly what to say, but he was at least able to hold Cas, remind him how wanted he was. He was there to provide reassurance when Cas decided not to see his parents for the foreseeable future. He was there to listen when Cas started worrying about Max, could hold his hand and kiss his forehead when his concerns for the recently released man settled heavily onto his chest.
And then the angel and the hunter crashed into each other. At the first moment Dean’s lips touched Cas’ lips, a supernova of colors erupted behind his eyes. He lifted his hands from the couch, and cradled Cas’ face with one hand and buried the other in the hair curling at the nape of Cas' neck. This. This is what he’d been hoping for. Been yearning for even when he hadn’t know it. And it was so much better than he could have ever imagined. Cas tasted like both rain and sunshine. His lips fit with Dean’s; his hands fit in the space above his waist.
, so to speak. Dean was just relieved that this was not one of those
“We’ve had this conversation,” Meg rolled her eyes.
He huffed out a tight breath when he felt like himself again, Sam did not speak but placed his hand on his brother’s shoulder -solid and comforting. But Dean did not want comfort right now. Pain, anger and loss were mixing in a toxic burn in his stomach. He needed an out. He needed it to
After the sobs stopped coming and Dean was drying the tears with the backs of his hands, Bobby had grabbed him by the scruff of his neck.
“That was just a very strong assumption to make, Dean. Maybe seeing you after five years affected him in the same way it’s affecting you? Maybe he’d been traveling for a long time? Maybe he thought you didn’t want to talk to him because I’m sure you verbally attacked –"
“There was an incident,” Dean breathed out.
“Cas, get the fuck out of my room,” Dean’s eyes were burning.
Life had not been kind to the Winchesters. Especially Sam. Dean had been so worried about him for so long. The wedding and the way Sam had radiated joy for days before and after felt like the sign Dean had been waiting for. It acted as proof that things really had turned around for his little brother.
He grinned as Cas crashed into him. Dean flung his arms enthusiastically around Cas’ neck and kissed his forehead as Cas snaked his arms around Dean’s waist.
He inhaled through his nose, but the oxygen seemed to get stuck in his throat.
“Yeah, it’s something two adults do who love each other.”
“Yes, Dean, all amnesia cases are different and although most of them resolve within a few weeks. Some cases can last months.”
“Do you really think there is nothing to say?” Eileen asked him quietly.
“You smell good,” Dean heard himself say as if from a distance.
To make matters even
Dean laughed and dipped his head to catch Castiel’s lips with his own. When Dean’s hands came up to rest lightly on either side of Castiel’s neck, Castiel groaned from somewhere low in the back of his throat.
He wasn’t.
Cas smiled widely at the screen, “That’s not what I meant, but I am happy we have that in our favour.”
“Sam said so,” Cas said, still twisting the amulet.
“So do it then,” Cas said pressing a light kiss to Dean’s lips, “let’s get our kid back.”
I hope you enjoy :)
“We can talk later?” Dean tried to sound casual, but in actuality, he sounded so strained that he cringed when his own words hit his ears.
“Cas,” Dean whispered brokenly, his knuckles turning white where they were clutching the doorframe. His body was taut and high strung. “Cas, baby, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean it. I… I don’t know why I get so angry. I just know… I know that it’s… i- it’s just always been there,” he inhaled sharply, his face twisting, as if the words themselves were costing him something. “And when things go bad, it just… it comes out. And I can’t… I can’t stop it. No matter how… how bad I want to, I just can’t stop it.” Dean crumbled to the floor of their room, clutching his chest.
“Dean?” Cas’ voice seemed loud.
Title of the chapter comes from the song
“Dean?”
“I want you to hear what I am saying now,” the angel continued. Cas pushed Dean, turning him slightly so that Dean’s back was flat on the mattress with Cas’ hand still firmly planted on the hunter’s chest. And with the momentum he lifted himself up and swung his leg over Dean’s legs, straddling him. Dean suddenly felt unable to move, pinned by Cas’ gaze, voice and body. Cas lowered himself until he was leaning on his forearms which were framing Dean’s face. The action grazing their naked chests together. Dean’s vision blurred as the sensation of so much
There was a beat of silence, “What about Amara?”
“What about them?”
“So nearly two weeks ago?” Castiel asked, trying to ignore the painfully suffocating feeling that constricted his chest as he thought of his parents. “Why didn’t you tell me?”
“Was that Amara?” Castiel asked.
Amara had rolled her eyes, but the gesture ended in a smile, “We can discuss visitors halfway through the program.”
Castiel finally unspooled himself and slumped back into the seat. He grabbed the aux cable she was holding out and plugged in his phone. It was still strange to have it back in his possession, kept safe and fully charged for him by Meg.
As always, the biggest of thank yous to Hellbreaker42 and Aubrielle for the beta and advanced reading respectively. You guys are so amazing and I so appreciate you!
Sam and his long-term girlfriend, Eileen, had finally tied the knot in Dublin. The wedding ceremony was held in the same church where Eileen’s late parents had gotten married. It was very important to her as she never knew them - both of them passed before her first birthday. She had explained to Dean that this somehow made her feel closer to them.
So. Fucking. Tired.
“Thank you,” Cas said sincerely, “Sleep well.”
“What do you mean?”
to help Castiel. Wanted to be there for him and support him.
. There was never any real animosity behind their words, no barely tempered anger in their interactions for the entirety of the three years. So, Cas was absolutely not ready for the way fighting with Dean would make him feel -- like he was going insane while being ripped apart from the inside out.
“Okay, listen to me. Take a long deep breath, okay? Don’t panic, you’ll hyperventilate. You’re going to be fine. Just breathe with me, okay?”
themed scrubs.
“That’s what I said, wasn’t it?” Cas asked.
“The car accident?”
Castiel had taken a liking to the young woman and felt a sense of protectiveness toward her. Claire was angry and often violent, but Castiel saw through the armor to the scared child she was, an echo of the fear that had lived inside him for so many years. At eighteen, she was the youngest person here, and although Castiel, at the age of twenty-three, was the second youngest person currently being housed at
“Thank you for saying that,” Castiel whispered, looking down.
Gabriel’s eyes lit up. “Oh, absolutely. I know this lawyer, Billie, brilliant and terrifying woman and she owes me a favor.”
“Dean, Stevie is sitting right outside…” Cas started, and Dean was too kiss-drunk to hear the hesitation there.
“Yes, they never had any angels to test on. But it seems to reason that the effects would be similar as the Empty has a claim on both angels and demons after they die,” Eileen replied, sitting down on the couch that had been Dean’s bed for the past couple of days.
Awesome.
Cas was actually there. In the same apartment-
“Well, it appears the person I am sharing with is, uh – It’s Dean.”
Cas eyed the clock on the wall as morning started melting into afternoon. He did laundry, he did dishes, he started another pot of coffee. But nothing. No sign of Dean. There was no movement behind his door, no sound. If he hadn’t heard the faint sounds of a shower running earlier, he would have barged in just to make sure Dean was
Dean always shut down when he needed people the most.
For the first morning since he arrived here, Dean did not wake up hard. He avoided thinking about exactly
by Ellie Goulding and Juice WRLD.
Dean did not really know what to say. He wanted to respond. Wanted to say the right thing. But no one would ever accuse Dean of being a wordsmith. So, although he was scrabbling for the words, the only thing that came out was, “So that’s why Jody, on Monday, made a comment about you laughing…?”
“Are you okay?”
A loud and angry growl punctuated the two’s heavy breathing.
“I can’t even imagine,” Dean sympathized, “So, let’s get you fed. You can’t enter into the emotional warpath on an empty stomach.”
Castiel inhaled deeply, “I’ll think about it. And I’ll take your words into consideration.”
was Cas’ first thought when he was confronted with Dean Winchester for the first time in half a decade.
Claire grumbled while the rest of the patients started filtering in. Conversation erupted as everyone hurried over to introduce themselves to Dean and then began discussing their respective days.
so that she could keep an eye on him. Dean had tried to resist, seeing as it was already dawn and he hadn’t felt as out of control as he had earlier in the evening. And, if he was being honest (although admitting this was by no means easy), he really didn’t want to be away from Cas.
Castiel walked into the reception area with something that felt suspiciously like exhilaration humming beneath his skin. It seemed like this newfound ability to feel things made him actually experience the
“So, you weren’t lying, huh?” Dean whispered after he walked to Cas’ side. Cas popped open one eye and smiled at Dean as he lowered himself onto the bench beside Cas.
Castiel was lying on his bed, his eyes trained on the ceiling, his expression was miles away.
“Wait… smoke inhalation? What smoke…” Panic spiked like ice in Dean’s veins.
I hope you enjoy :)
Cas squeezed him gently. “That is very mature, Dean. I think that’s a very healthy outlook. I’m proud of you.”
But Dean kept his distance, spoke more openly than he has in the past three days, but his guard was still up. He didn’t look like he was struggling with the proximity as much as Cas was. And that, in and of itself, was a very specific kind of torture. Knowing that he was the only one who had to surreptitiously shove his trembling hands under his legs to stop himself from leaning across the table and tangling their fingers. Knowing that he was the only one who kept replaying the scene earlier where Dean had held his face, and actively trying to remember how the familiar fingers with the unfamiliar callouses felt against his skin. It would somehow be easier if Dean felt the same longing Cas did, felt the same need to be closer.
And he had anticipated that it would be
They would not sort anything out the following morning.
(which he definitely did not watch for its medical accuracy), so he needed Bobby to explain what was happening a couple of times before he fully understood it, and he was still unsure about a lot of the lingo.
No, he never reconciled with his parents.
“Nice deflection,” Gabriel smirked.
And Cas did.
“Aren't there things you’d like to say to him? I know I don’t know the full story, I wasn’t there, but I know some, and I know how you shut off completely when Sam mentions his name... I don’t know. I guess I just get the feeling that there were a lot of things left unsaid between the two of you.”
“I’m never anxious,” Dean outright lied, cracking a wide smile. Missouri smiled fondly but didn’t say anything, just looked at him in an expectant way.
Gabriel grinned at both of them.
. The thought made his stomach roll. Castiel had deserved loving parents, or at least, someone else who would have protected him, and guided him… not to have another person who was supposed to shield him just leave him.
“It means visitation ends in ten minutes,” Meg said as she downed the last of her coffee.
This was the scared child who was forced to grow up far too soon, who grew up terrified and was taught that violence was the only response to emotions. The kid who always had to fight, scrounge and claw to keep himself safe, to keep his brother safe. This was someone who was deeply frightened, who never had someone to hold onto, who only ever relied on himself because it was the only way he survived. The only way they survived. The man who was taught to never let his vulnerability show, this was someone terrified and angry and torn up.
So instead of trying to make sense of the hurricane currently tearing through him, he shoved off the bed and almost leapt to the other side of the room.
“This has gotta be a turn off,” Dean chuckled mirthlessly after a long silence.
Nope.
Dean tried not to think of her anymore. Of Cassie. Of the first person who had held his heart. Who had held it tenderly, never ripping it apart the way he had become accustomed to. He had loved her with so few defenses , which he had known he should have had more of. His heart was a poorly scabbed-over mix of breaks and mismatched jigsaw pieces that needed protecting. But, something about her kindness, her
“So I just grabbed the steering wheel. I didn’t really have a plan. I wasn’t thinking. I just wanted him scared. I wanted him to feel how I felt.”
They stared at each other for a while, and Castiel felt so much joy in just sitting there with this confident and beautiful man. There was something in the way Dean was looking at him that seemed so
“Not that I’m looking a gift horse in the mouth or anything,” Meg said cautiously, “but you seem to be in a very good mood.”
Sam was better.
“Yeah?”
Castiel twisted his body uncomfortably where he sat in the front seat so he could stare out the back window of Meg’s car, stare at the spot where Dean was growing smaller, stare until long after they had crested the hills and Dean was out of sight.
“Bye, bitch.”
The one upside of this emotional turmoil is that it had, at least, softened his dick. So, as to not rock the boat, he would need a
“Well, I won’t be going through it long,” Dean said as he pushed past Eileen and moved to the center of Sam’s room. Sam raised his eyebrows in questioning, Eileen remained quiet.
“Look at me.” Cas ordered again. Dean did. He looked at him. Cas moved his fingers from Dean’s chin to the nape of his neck, running his fingers through the short hairs there.
“I think a pipe burst,” Cas huffed out. The ceiling above the bed had a gaping hole and water was still falling from it.
When Sam held up the certificate, a dam broke inside Dean. He cried and cried and cried. He watched the brother that he had come so close to losing, staring down the barrel of the future he had almost been denied, and he just lost it.

“He was taken to another hospital.”
Cas opened the book and his eyes travelled down the quote inscribed on the back of the front cover. Dean knew what he was reading.
TW: Childhood abuse (physical)
“Yes, well angelic grace does the same thing. Well, it could technically, with the right spell,” Jack said plainly.
Cas nodded. He was an observer in some of the darker times in Sam’s life. Dean had been really worried about him. Cas felt a genuine surge of happiness that things seemed to have turned around for Sam, and that the path he was currently walking seemed to be a happy one.
“Guys, this is Eileen. Eileen, this is my family,” Sam signed his words as he spoke them aloud.
“Yes, you did. It was not really a conscious decision. You just did not want to live without your brother, and you wanted your father to face the consequences of his actions. It was a knee-jerk reaction in very emotionally charged circumstances. Most of the times you were semi-cognizant, you weren’t making any sense, and you just kept repeating the word ‘
Have a good week everyone :) x
This is what he always wanted. This is what he never thought he’d have.
Thank you all so much, again, from the bottom of my heart. I hope you all have an amazing week!
I hope you enjoy this chapter!
Dean was intoxicating and exciting, comforting and brilliantly unfamiliar all wrapped into one freckled and beautiful body. They had started to figure out the give-and-take in their relationship, how to open up and admit when they needed help. Things were going well, and Castiel was so undeniably and deeply happy.
Dean clapped him on the back gently as Max was leaving.
And Dean, in his shock, had almost acted on it, almost reached for Cas. He had ached to wrap his arms around him.
“Gabe?”
Dean could do nothing but comply. On the back of the cover page, in Cas’ handwriting, there was a quote:
Dean drank deeply from his coffee as he eyed Cas, who had moved to start making Dean’s bed. Cas, who was usually the picture of calm and serenity seemed to be very fidgety this morning.
What exactly she understood, however, was still a mystery to Dean. He hadn’t opened a vein and gushed about his life, about how much pain he was always in, how lost and confused he felt, about the scars that seemed to cover wounds that hadn’t healed properly, both external and internal. But, there was something in her eyes that made him feel like she recognized something in him.
feel it, not to the full extent at least. But most days it was just nothing - an
“He’s in there,” Jack said plainly, “both his life force and his grace are intact.” And Dean had to admit that Cas
“Yeah, you slept for most of it. I mean excluding our conversations and other activities,” Cas said, leaning over to grab the coffee mug and shove it into Dean’s hands.
He still felt that pit in his stomach. Still felt the undeniable urge to just fucking
The issue wasn’t what Dean wanted to say. It’s all the things he didn’t want to say,
“To the Bunker?” Jack asked.
Dean let out an uneven breath.
Dean rolled his eyes. “How many Cas’ do you know, Sam?”
. All the time. The entire apartment smells like him.”
. And, if the memory of Sam lying motionless and ghostly pale in that sterile room wasn’t still seared onto the backs of his eyelids, if the memory of the panic he had felt was not still haunting his thoughts, both awake and asleep, he would pile Castiel into the back of the Impala immediately and take him shopping for his very first set of bed sheets and his own memory foam mattress.
“Dean,” Missouri’s voice came long before he was ready for the conversation they were about to have, “please, come inside.”
times. They didn’t show.” Castiel brought his legs up underneath him and buried his hands in his lap in order to hide the fact that they were shaking.
TW: Mentions of attempted suicide
Dean’s grip tightened and he made a breathy noise that Castiel had never heard before, but immediately wanted to hear again.
Castiel cocked his head to the side. “I know that you did the best you could.”
Cas did this to him.
“Don’t let it get to your head, Sammy,” Dean warned the comatose body of his brother.
Dean roughly scrubbed at his face with the palms of his hands.
To say Dean melted out of the bed would probably be the most accurate description. Castiel bit back a smile as he heard Dean grumbling to himself. His smile only grew when Dean automatically came back to Castiel’s bed and dropped unceremoniously onto the cushions.
“My grace,” Cas said plainly.
Cas was definitely ridiculously inept when it came to the kitchen, but what he lacked in skill, he made up for in enthusiasm. And Dean had had such an amazing time with him today; he couldn’t remember the last time he had
TW: car accident, trauma induced amnesia (but you don't find out the trauma here).
And sitting here next to Cas now, as he watched everyone in the room inhale the food and make noises of appreciation, he thought he would never tire of the childlike wonder that Cas was watching everyone with now.
Everyone agreed and headed off towards their own cars.
Dean gaze latched onto his, “No,” he smiled, “but thanks for checking. I don’t feel bad, I just feel fucking
Dean laughed, “Hard? Jesus, that doesn’t even begin to describe it. But I got it done. And I kept us alive.”
Next week we have quite a fluffy chapter. The angst is not over yet, as the boys both have some work to do, but I thought I would give them a little reprieve.
“Okay, luckily, this is something that we can do quite easily,” Dean said instead of agreeing with Sam.
There was something familiar about the voice, but Cas couldn’t quite put his finger on it. The voice was too muffled by the walls.
Castiel was absurdly tired when he collapsed onto the uncovered mattress in his new room. The bags of new sheets, duvet covers, and generic art pieces spilled out across the floor. He had managed to put his little pot plants on the windowsill before the bed beckoned to him. He closed his eyes and instinctively reached out beside him but was met with air. His stomach dropped when he clenched his hand around nothing.
“Uhm, not really… Meg it appears that the universe is playing a cruel cosmic joke on me,” Cas whispered. He hadn’t heard Dean leave the lounge and didn’t want to be overheard.
Cas fidgeted with the corners of the book and Dean huffed in exasperation before putting his hand out expectantly. “Is that for me?”
The doctor had explained that this confusion was very normal for patients who have been under for a while – that Sam may take a while to fully reenter the
Dean let out that soft laugh again.
seemed to be able to calm the jittery feeling that had seeped into his bones.
So, given that there had only ever been two people that he had ever trusted, it was a very surreal experience to suddenly feel the very unequivocal tug to trust this woman with the dark hair that only ever looked like she was humoring Dean when they spoke.
This, however, meant that he did not sleep at all. Every time he closed his eyes, the image of Sam reaching out to him with his hands coated in red, burnt the back of his eyelids. And even if these images weren’t enough to haunt him, his simmering anger would have been enough to keep him conscious. He couldn’t articulate the depth of the betrayal and despair he felt when he thought of Amara. He had gone against his instincts, had trusted her, had listened to her and she had
“Great, I want to take a long nap,” Dean told her honestly.
“I hear you, I do, it’s just – Sam, he’s been alone and I – “
“Dean, I do. Dean, stop,” Cas said softly.
“Yeah, pretty low,” Dean continued in his lowered voice.
“Is that the infamous Dean, Cassie?” That accented voice grated against Dean. Dean snapped his eyes to Cas’ laptop where the image of a blonde guy wearing an unreadable expression was filling the screen.
Dean shook his head, “No, it was… Cas, you’re awesome, amazing.”
Castiel swallowed heavily. He hadn’t discussed it with anyone yet. He wasn’t sure he wanted to talk about it until he absolutely had to. Moreover, he didn’t even know Dean all that well.
Everyone turned to look at Dean. Cas felt un uncomfortable twinge in his side at her name leaving Dean’s mouth.
I am very excited about this story and the feedback really keeps me motivated!
Dean was
“What?” Whatever Dean was expecting Cas to say, it obviously wasn’t that, “I’m not gonna hit you.”
And he kept improving.
Just because he wasn’t physically there, didn’t mean that Dean couldn’t still hold on to him.
“Well, that’s where I’m headed now, so, you can walk with me if you’d like?” Castiel offered, pulling the sleeves of his hoodie low over his hands as he smiled at the newcomer.
Dean laughed as he threw the dish cloth back at Sam.
When he pulled back, Jack was smiling up at him.
He made the wrong fucking choice.
“Do you want to talk about what happened with Billie and the Empty?” Sam asked when Dean remained silent.
“Yeah, absolutely, man. Fuck, this is really going to help. I don’t know how to thank you.”
Dean had been trying to avoid thinking about how difficult it must have been for the newly human Castiel, thrust into a world that made little-to-no sense, and then subsequently abandoned after he finally thought he had found a home – a touchstone in the chaos. Thrown out by the person who he had trusted the most. But, with Castiel in the same room as him, with scarcely more than a sleeping bag clutched to chest with the same desperation as a child clutching a security blanket, Dean could no longer avoid thinking about it. Could no longer avoid thinking about the massive fallout and consequences of his actions. So, after tossing Castiel a pair of too loose sweatpants and a black t-shirt, as he had no change of clothes (don’t think about it), Dean had flown out of the motel room, running from his issues. He was consistent in this, at least. And before he really remembered making the decision, he found himself at the bar down the road, nursing his second scotch. He didn’t mean to go there. He just needed to get away.
wanted
Amara swatted him lightly with the pad she was holding, “Be careful with your language here, Dean.”
“We have other responsibilities today,” Cas said stoically, and Dean rolled his eyes.
“What?” Castiel asked, dazed, suddenly ridiculously intrigued by his own eyebrow.
There was a beat of silence.
“I’m not going to answer that.”
I hope you enjoy!
the reason for that smile.
“He came back when he was informed of the accident.”
ex problems.
Okay, so maybe he even liked Dean before coffee.
It was only at the end of the second session that Dean realized the reason Bobby knew so much, and in such significant detail, was because he had been visiting Sam three times a day for the past eight weeks. Right before Bobby left this past Saturday, Dean had broken down and thanked Bobby for being there for Sam when he couldn’t.
“Evening, boys,” She greeted warmly, “Meds time, Castiel.”
He was not sure how long he lay there, curled on his side, cradling his stomach that was recoiling violently, before the door to the room creaked open.
Cas, who had also been staring at the ceiling, turned his head so he could meet Dean’s eyes.
“Dean…” Cas turned towards him, eyes pinning him.
needed
“Is that true, Dean?” Jody asked from across the table.
Cas gave him a soft, knowing look before walking closer to him. He rested a hand on the side of Dean’s neck. Dean’s hands stopped moving.
Castiel shushed him gently before kissing his temple.
“Where?” Sam asked.
Because he sure as fuck has not been acting rationally since Cas had appeared in his doorway.
in hindsight that he wanted to bash his head into the wall for missing it.
Thank you so much to anyone who has engaged with this story! It means so much and genuinely acts as fuel for my writing. I really appreciate it!
“Why didn’t you just tell me that in the beginning? Or when you first arrived here? Or when we were in the car together?”
“Dean,”
“It’s fine,” Dean said defensively, “I’m fine. I wasn’t complaining. Just explaining.”
Cas rolled his eyes playfully before walking towards Dean.
Dean was just about to say that to Sam when he heard a thundering crash and a startled shout coming from Cas’ room.
“Cas,” Dean whispered in between kisses until he pulled back to look into his eyes, “I’ll get you back to me.”
“I know,” Castiel said automatically, but he cringed when Dean’s eyebrows shot up.
If you want to come say hi or share your thoughts about the first chapter, you can find me on tumblr
Dean strode purposefully towards his room. He slammed the door without looking back.
Dean had glared at her, “Can I write him letters?”
But finally, a couple of days ago, all the pieces came together, and in a beautiful ceremony, one that Dean
But not today.
“I love you too, Dean.”
“Cas, please, not now. I can’t and I need… I need you to leave, okay? I need you to leave right now.”
“Oh, god,” the words were barely whispered.
Dean bolted upright. Cas had already been in the Empty, but he had found his way back to Dean. He could do it again, surely. But, if this time he couldn’t find his way back, Dean would follow him there. He shook his head to try organizing the thoughts that were now jumping like rapid fire through his brain. He would get Cas back. He had to. He would do anything. He would do
Cas feels tears streaking down his face and a sob breaks free from his chest as he grabs Dean by the neck and pulls him into a searing kiss. He breaks away briefly so that he can look Dean in the eye, “Dean Winchester, nothing in the many millennia that I have lived would make me happier than to be married to you.”
Because after she had fed him that line on the phone last night, he had gone back over all of their conversations and really focused on what she’d said.
“Fuck yeah,” Eileen said.
Dean knows what that hair feels like sliding in between his fingers. He knows what those pale lips feel like against his mouth, his throat, his stomach. How they look stretched around his cock. He knows what that laugh, the one captured in that group photo, sounds like. He knows how that laugh warms him. He knows what it’s like to have those eyes focused on him. He knows what it is like to be loved by him.
“A couple of broken bones, his most severe injury is a broken femur. He was discharged from hospital a couple of weeks ago. I don’t know where he has gone since. But Mr. Singer wouldn’t let him into your apartment. Even had the locks changed, so he’s definitely not there.”
to find that tears were burning in his eyes, threatening to spill, “I’m a fucking, godforsaken train wreck.”
“I have a lot of regrets about that,” Dean said after he could force sounds past the lump currently blocking his airway.
Dean rolled over and groaned into the pillow he had not slept on. What a complete and utter clusterfuck of a situation.
As Dean sat there, staring at his best friend, a memory popped up in his mind. Dean remembered that Cas once told him that there was a connection between an angel and his vessel which gave him an idea. He repeated the Enochian incantation Cas had used to call Raphael nearly a decade ago into Cas' ear. It had been one of the first times he had heard Cas speak his native tongue, and it had effected him in ways he would never admit to out loud. But he had spent hours repeating the scene over and over, watching Cas’ lips form the words, listening to the low rumble of his voice sounding out the syllables. No, there was just no way Dean would ever forget those sounds. He just hoped that the connection would reach past this life and into the Empty.
“Why?” Castiel was stunned.
Dean hummed in agreement, trying to ignore the way his heart was hammering a staccato out in his chest.
Dean let out a humorless laugh. “Why do you think I needed to talk to her?”
“Dean, look at me,” Castiel urged, and Dean slowly turned his face towards Castiel’s. “You have ruined nothing. Do you hear me? And I am not going anywhere. I’m right here.”
“Dean, there was a reason you agreed to come here, hopped up on painkillers or not. Can you tell me what that is?”
“You want to do something specific?” Cas asked, his voice tinged with humor.
Dean looked awful, his eyes a glowing red, angry scarlet lines on his forearms where his nails must have scratched out his frustration. The numbness and anger were thoroughly erased, completely replaced with a haunted, broken look that somehow invaded his entire being.
“No, well… In all honesty, I don’t want to be alive. Everything feels so heavy. Living, existing… it is an effort, an effort so profound that the mere thought of it leaves me exhausted, drained down to my very bones. Living
So, a couple of things...

Sam wiped his hand down his face, trying to think of the best thing to do for his brother. Dean was unnaturally quiet in the back seat. Sam killed the engine and climbed out, opening the door for Dean, who was cradling his injured hand.
Dean was shaking so hard that his teeth were chattering.
Other nights, it would be slow and drawn out, and Cas would take his time slowly taking Dean apart, working him open, making him beg...They would have small traditions: having hot chocolate on the porch on the night of winter’s first snow, family movie nights on the first Sunday of every month.
Dean really liked that they were able to be there for each other, to hold on to each other. And all Dean really wanted was to keep getting to know more and more about him, to hold him closer and closer. And all of this was
sucker for Cas in a suit.
Dean froze. His entire body seized up as Claire’s inquisitive gaze lingered on his face.
He knew he should text Gabe and Meg, let them know he was back in Kansas, that he had arrived safely, but he knew he would sound as shaky as the feeling of having pressure in his chest always made him feel and he didn’t want to worry them.
Dean placed the bag on the ground by the foot of his bed. He was asleep before his head hit the pillow.
As he entered the kitchenette area, he tried to school his face into something calm and distant. Dean was still pulled tighter than a bowstring, and he wasn’t moving. He kept sending furtive glances Cas’ way, but he was frozen, one hand holding the pan and the other holding a sudsy sponge. Cas stopped short just as he reached the fridge. The air tightened, and a very strange and intense charge was suddenly running between them. Cas swallowed heavily, and when it became evident that Dean wasn’t going to move, Cas broke the tension. He hurriedly opened the fridge door and grabbed the milk and creamer he ordered. He’d make a quick bowl of cereal and grab a quick coffee and then go hide – no, sit – in his room. He could watch Netflix on his laptop or something.
Castiel sighed, but fondness bloomed in his chest, “So who do you want to talk about then? The porn stars?”
Castiel nodded as his hands moved higher until they snuck under Dean’s shirt, and he slowly started mapping out the contours of Dean’s stomach. Dean was on fire. He rushed to place another kiss to Castiel’s mouth – rushed to lick the seam of the pale lips he had fantasized about for so long. When Cas opened up to him, he thought he would pass out as all of the blood rushed out of his head.
Charlie had been extremely efficient, and the whole process took much shorter than Dean had ever dared to hope. And, she was very entertaining throughout, smiling easily and talking excitedly when Dean had commented on her Deathly Hallows necklace.
Castiel nodded. Linda Tran was the other night nurse who worked the same shift as Stevie. Castiel didn’t stay in one of the rooms that she looked after, so he didn’t know her well, but he knew what she looked like at least.
When the credits started rolling, Dean seemed more keyed up than before they started, whereas everyone else looked around lazily, sleep just in grasp for almost all of them. They all bid each other a good evening, and Castiel and Dean walked hand-in-hand back to their room. Dean seemed to be vibrating with energy.
When Dean had imagined this moment in his head, which he had admittedly done almost daily for months now, he never quite imagined it like this. Never Imagined that it would feel this hollow. In his mind, when this moment finally arrived, there would have been this insurmountable flood of relief pouring out of him. He would have felt right and his family… well his family would have celebrated. They would have held on to each other… united.  Together. But this was unfortunately not the reality of the situation.
“The bullet hit her in her lower abdomen. As soon as she collapsed, they all ran out. But luckily, my deputies, the backup I had called for,  were there. They were all arrested, and we managed to keep Alex stable enough before the paramedics arrived. They say she was exceptionally fortunate. But those minutes before the ambulance got there, where I was holding my second dying child in my arms...”
Castiel was familiar with this feeling. He ached for his friend while she recounted her past.
Dean felt shaken by Castiel’s life story, and he couldn’t identify exactly why it had affected him in such a potent way. Why the heartbreaking story of this exceptionally interesting man made him feel as if his entire world was off-kilter – unbalanced. The floor kept twisting as he walked.
“Who’s fetching you today?” Jody asked as she sipped her coffee.
every few minutes, his grimace mostly hidden by his mask. He managed to claim his luggage and find the Uber Meg had arranged for him before Becky could insist they share contact information because, “
As always, please see end notes for trigger and content warnings!
Dean looked a little embarrassed, Castiel’s chest felt warm as he looked into Dean’s eyes, the natural sunlight turning the emerald shade brilliant.
“Huh?” Sam asked, looking startled.
Cas nodded, “Well, I accept the olive branch, and I would love to keep you company. As long as you tell me all about your time in Dublin in return.”
“No kid is that clumsy, Dean.”
He was sorely disappointed when he voiced this because instead of Cas ripping off his shirt and sending buttons flying everywhere, he just laughed. Cas stepped away from him fully before adding, “If you’re late to Sam’s graduation, you’re going to be very upset with yourself, and I’m going to be stuck with your sulking for the remainder of the day, and I refuse to be subjected to that.”
It hurt Castiel deeply to think Meg still blamed herself, that Meg had taken on that burden and refused to share it.
Okay, so a quick and quiet fist fucking would not be possible.
Dean shook his head again. “Nah. I really like your voice, man. It’s super calming.”
Dean’s hands fluttered at his side as he glanced at those stupid closed curtains.
Thank you so much to everyone who has interacted with this fic in anyway! I genuinely appreciate it so very much :)! Again,  I know this is a day early but I have a lot of work I need to do tomorrow, so thought I'd get this out a little earlier. I do seem incapable of actually publishing on a Sunday.
“No, I’m up now.” He didn’t look very awake. Both of his eyes were still closed, but he cracked one open when Castiel settled himself at the foot of the bed.
He had found that he had enjoyed her company. He found himself trusting her – a weird experience as Dean never trusted anyone. Dean second-guessed everyone’s motives, their thoughts and alliances. Some lessons, especially those that were learned the hard way, tended to stick and influence any and all other thoughts and decisions.
Sam rolled his eyes but whispered something that sounded a lot like, “fucking, finally”.
“Because it’s important that you realize that none of that was fair. That, just because you carried it well, doesn’t mean you should have had to carry it at all.” She explained.
Dean, at least, was comfortable enough by now to walk straight into her office and pour himself a cup of water from the jug on the center of the coffee table.
“Yes, but I said some things that could potentially make him angry,” Cas said. Just because finally admitting to Dean that he was in love with him was his ultimate happiness, his definition of unadulterated bliss, it did not mean that it was what the hunter had  wanted to hear. Cas may still be learning about humans and human emotions, but Metatron had put enough stories about unrequited love in his head for him to understand what Dean was going through. Dean was probably angry that Cas had admitted it, had changed their friendship, had added another layer of complication to his life. But Cas could not bring himself to regret his decision. Would never be able to. It had been as if a weight had lifted off his chest, a very heavy weight that had been dragging him under since he first touched Dean in Hell. A weight he wouldn’t trade for anything because it had meant being in Dean’s life, but he did not want to be held down anymore, he wanted to live his truth and cherish it. But Cas could explain to Dean that he didn’t need anything from him. He never had. He didn’t need Dean to reciprocate, wanted it sure, but he didn’t need it. He would stay by his side for as long as Dean would have him, with no expectations.
She froze, halfway out of her seat. “What did he remember?”
of the Brit.
Dean fell asleep promptly after that, his dreams engulfed in visions of blue.
Dean heard the click as the door was opened, and he rolled onto his side to greet Cas. Dean had noticed that Cas slipped out early the past two mornings. He always returned to the room before breakfast, however, which allowed them the opportunity to walk to the cafeteria together.
“You being at my wedding is not something I consider a ‘stupid thing’, Dean,” Sam countered.
Dean grabbed Castiel’s arm and tugged him along as he headed out the room.
“I couldn’t tell you specifically,”
No one ever came close.
Cas spilled into Dean’s hand who only slowed his movements but didn't fully stop. It was bordering on too much, but Cas was desperate to get Dean over the edge. He pulled Dean towards him and tilted his head so that his throat was bared to Cas. Cas latched himself onto Dean’s neck, speeding up his movements, and when Dean made that familiar sound that indicated he was close, Cas lightly scraped his teeth down the column of his neck, and then, Dean was coming on his hand.
The room was ghostly quiet for a full minute after the garage door swinging closed had been heard. Castiel felt cold all over as he dropped his head into his hands. Consequences were hard to face. When your consequence was Dean Winchester, the man you loved with your every cell and atom, it felt almost impossible to face.
“No need to rush, Dean,” Amara smiled gently. “I am going to be spending most of the day here. I need to catch up with Charlie, Missouri and Pamela anyway. I would also like to check in on Ava, see how she’s adjusting. Just get it to me before dinner, and I will take it straight to the hospital.”
“Other times?” Cas asked.
Dean nodded and relaxed his grip on his own hair, “Well you never know. I’m a super interesting topic of conversation.”
“Mmm. And why are you wanting to check yourself out so soon when you haven’t even been here for a full week yet?”
“That could work,” he said, “she’s on board.”
to be here. He felt like an imposter, taking up the space of someone who needed this place. Dean tried to clear the thought from his head, not wanting a repeat of the spiral that had led to his breakdown earlier in the week, not when he was actively excited for the time he would get with Cas.
Dean stopped what he was doing and glared at Cas, “I told you not to mention my brother when you’re naked.”
difficult.
“Same here. But, it’s always exciting when someone new comes along, isn’t it?” Hannah asked.
Barely.
Dean turned the key and swung the door open, his
Dean groaned.
“Well, we had spent all our time together while we were over there. It makes sense that the absences would be noted,” the gratingly annoying voice continued.
TW: Mentions of abuse (not extensive)
Cas grimaced; his talents have never extended to the kitchen. He wiped down the worst of the mess, but because he didn’t want the food getting cold, he settled for cleaning after.
“Good. Secondly, I just facilitated the cast you personally put around your own mind. I just made sure you didn’t go sawing it off before the bone was strengthened underneath.”
He also saw Dean jump away from the door when his gaze landed on Cas.
“Please eat,” Castiel said. “If you are not scarfing a borderline ludicrous amount of food, it makes me very uncomfortable.”
Tears were streaming down Castiel’s face, “And I know that’s not what I’ll get. What I’ll get is a lecture about how I let them down, how all this attention-seeking isn’t helpful. That I am sinful, selfish and…”
Castiel felt the start of a headache creeping up the right side of his temple, “Deal with them?”
Dean clamored to grab the bottle of water that was on Sam’s bedside table. Sam took the bottle gratefully, albeit with trembling hands, and swallowed quickly and deeply. Dean snatched the bottle back.
“Well, my mom died when I was six. A house-fire, so she never knew.” Dean started.
“Wait, does that mean I have left the resident wordsmith, the linguist of the mental ward, speechless?” Dean asked, his cockiness flooding over the momentary vulnerable moment. Castiel rolled his eyes and just continued running his hand through Dean’s hair.
As always, all my thanks and gratitude to Hellbreaker42 for the beta work he did for this fic. It is so appreaicted.
He felt ready to take on the world.
When Castiel awoke, Dean was still clinging to him, his face peaceful in sleep. This was not unusual; they have been falling asleep in each other’s beds more and more frequently over the past three weeks. What was unusual, however, was the memories of the previous night that immediately flew into Castiel’s brain. The way it felt, the way
The title of this chapter is a line from the song "Mad World" by Tears for Fears.
Dean’s presence was like drinking salt water; the more Castiel spent time with him, learned about him, and discovered hidden parts of him, the more he wanted
He was often alone at this time of day, ensuring he woke up long before the other residents, relishing the quiet hours when he didn’t have to put on a mask or interact with others. He would stroll out of his room and sit on a garden bench, and watch the sun rise. The stillness of these moments had a purity to it that seemed to still the tremors in his heart and soothe the raw ache in his wrists. But, before he had time to truly appreciate it this time, he saw a figure waving far too frantically for this early in the morning from the communal kitchen window. It looked like he would not be alone today.
Amara looked at him calmly, “Because you saw him the week leading up to the car accident, obviously. Dean, you need to heal. You need to get better. And, I think I know of a place where. I’ve already cleared it with Mr. Singer.”
That stopped Castiel short, he hadn’t realised that he had left it in his room.
Jody spoke of losing them. How they both got sick with something that, to this day, she doesn’t know what it was. She also doesn’t know why she didn’t get it, but in the span of a week, both her husband and her son succumbed to this unknown virus. She spoke of how empty she was in the months that followed, how weak she felt. How she didn’t really know how to get up in the morning.
“I’m with the she-devil on this one,” Gabriel said as Castiel turned to him.
“What’s that?” Dean asked as she handed it to him.
and tossed it at him. Dean grunted as he grabbed the material.
Dean settled himself a little lower into the couch before replying. “Yeah, no, dude, it’s great. No weird stains or horror-movie scratch marks. I call it a win.”
Dean had not been having the greatest of times lately. And, as his bag was packed into the hospital transport van before the sun had even risen, he had a feeling today would, unfortunately, not break this pattern. Dean had never felt like this before, this broken and aching feeling that hat settled in his chest. Of feeling nothing and then, suddenly, feeling everything. Oscillating wildly between the inability to care about anything, when the numbness seeped into the very fabric of his being, to feeling absolutely everything when it suddenly felt like he would implode from the sheer inability to stop his sobbing.
(See the end of the chapter for
“What? No!”
Amara had spent quite a few hours discussing this place with him during the past two days. Dean had to admit that it sounded nice – that it seemed more a calm place for healing rather than a white-washed room with prying doctors. But, maybe he had just drunk her kool aid.
“You’re God now, can’t you just wake him up?” Dean asked, desperation turning the edges in voice sharper than he had intended.
“Ready?” Jack asked kindly.
“Yes but that’s not the point we were thinking about. We were talking particularly about the siphoning. And what else one could potentially siphon. Well, one being Jack of course,” Eileen replied.
Sam shook his head, “You’re wrong. I was. Grief makes you selfish. You can’t see past your own pain. But nonetheless, what I’m trying to say is once I was out of that headspace, when I became more myself again, the more I thought about it… Dean, Cas breaking up with you didn’t make sense.”
“I haven’t been here since I met you,” Dean admitted, “Because you’re my safe space now, Cas.”
And it suddenly makes perfect sense to Dean why both relationships he attempted since college hadn’t worked out. He’s been blaming it on timing, personality mismatches, different life stages, different ideas of what a relationship was.
“Do you want to come with us to lunch?” Sam asked her.
Cas swallowed and leaned down to grab his suitcase. He shouldn’t be this affected by Dean’s animosity. Not this many years later. It shouldn’t even register.
“I do not know,” Jack said simply, his voice low and his eyebrows drawn.
Hey there :)
It’s irrational that a fully clothed photo of his first love, who he hadn’t spoken to, let alone seen, in the past five years, distract him from the half-naked gorgeous body of his most recent ex who, in no uncertain terms, wants to rekindle a relationship that he had been sad to see end.
“Cas, is everything okay?” Dean asked as the other man started straightening the already straight sheets.
“Yeah, we can, that’s what I was checking,” Dean said, showing Cas the internet tab on his phone, “it looks like same-sex marriage was legalized in 2015 in the State of Kansas.”
“Thank you, Meg. I love you too.”
“What?” Castiel asked, blinking.
“I know this, Dean. You know I know this. But only by dealing with and processing what happened over the last couple of years will you be strong enough to remember.”
TW: Religious discussions
Yes! Of course,” Jack said, smiling widely. But instead of walking out of the room and down the hall, the dream root just appeared in Jack’s hand.
“Yes we did,” Cas responded, confused.
. He groaned and dug his face into the pillow. This situation, of course, made sense given what his brain had supplied for nighttime viewing, but that did not detract from how much Dean did not want to deal with it right now. The idea of jerking off while Cas was only a thin wall away was not his idea of a good time.
“I may have misspoken. I meant that Bobby would take care of Sam in your absence. And, that he wanted you to go. It’s called Everlasting, it’s a long-term psychiatric care facility, but it’s run on a large plot of land, not a hospital, and it isn’t as… sterile … as the more traditional inpatient program.”
No. No, he couldn’t.
“You will not like my answer,” Amara warned as she leaned forward with her elbows on her knees and interlinked her hands. “But the basic and most straightforward answer I can give you is that your brother was not my patient – you were.”
“Indeed. The 1913 version by J.M Barrie.”
were better. That they had changed. You seemed better since last time and…” Gabriel floundered.
“Come here,” Dean gathered Cas close in his arms. Cas started fidgeting with the amulet around Dean’s neck.
He heard her instructions clearly, as if she were sitting behind the desk.
“And?” Dean asked, dishing an unholy amount of pasta and sauce onto his plate.
“This has happened a couple of times with patients, particularly in the first two to three weeks. There are protocols in place. Don’t fret, Castiel,” her smile comforted him. .
“After? So, she went home again?”
“I’m just happy Cas. All of us, together, working to get the last member of our family back. I’m just happy man.”
“Where’s Eileen and Jack?” Cas asked.
“Cas, I just wanted you to know that this is me trying,” Dean said, feeling borderline manic. All he knew was that he couldn't let Castiel leave this bed, and he didn't want this rift between them to widen while he was still trying to figure out how to cross it.
back to the Bunker. Sam’s mood seemed to fit with his - he was staring out the window, eyebrows creased. Neither of them said anything the whole way home.
“So, have all of you done this?” Dean asked.
“I’m sorry,” He choked out, a sob threatening to break out of his chest.
“Must have been. I’m not sure,” Dean responded.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to ramble,” Cas blushed.
“You’re both going to be just fine, okay?”
Meg’s eyes snapped up to him, and Castiel barely had time to register the exhausted look in her eyes, to see the lines etched into her face that seemed to tell the story of one much older than her, before breaking into a winning smile.
Sam currently was.
“And I kept telling myself that we’d have time after this all ended, when we could talk, and I’d have more time to understand what all of this meant. What exactly you mean to me. But there was just never an
Dean liked talking to Cas. Really liked it.
“Excuse me?  Weren’t you raised in a religious cult? How do you know about social constructs?” Dean lifted himself onto his elbow so they could look at each other.
“Thank you,” Dean whispered before he looked at Castiel and repeated, “Thank you.”
Dean felt Sam’s gaze on his face, and when his eyes met his brothers’, Sam gave him a small nod. He understood. He felt the same way.
by Eden.
“Hi Cas,” Cas stood up and pulled his kid into a hug, tears threatening to spill as Jack buried his face into Cas’ chest. Jack was openly sobbing. A child reunited with a father who had been taken too soon. Castiel spoke to him in a soothing voice, murmuring encouragements until Jack started regaining his composure.
Castiel nodded, his head feeling heavy as the sleepless night started making itself known.
They stared at each other for a long while, before Dean broke the silence. “Please leave.”
, yet you still have amnesia. There is something you are trying to forget. But that’s not what I meant. It’s more than that. It’s what they found when they did the x-rays on you after the accident. Dean, they found a troubling number of healed fractures.”
Dean didn’t know if Castiel would want him there or if he would want privacy. But Dean knew that he didn’t want to leave him alone right away or have him out of his sight for any extended period of time. He tried not to think about why these instincts even existed when it came to someone he barely knew, and he definitely tried not to think about why they were so aggressively dominating - invading all of his thoughts.
He understood.
Cas smiled, a little shyly as he replied, “Well sexual intercourse does burn quite a few calories.”
This was hell.
“After a couple of those episodes, I started talking to Mr. Singer about your history with John. I filled him in as much as I could about what happened to Sam. And, combined with your x-rays showing numerous healed fractures and your extensive medical records, I was able to slowly piece together some of your history. Your trauma. I had to ask Bobby if he thought you were suicidal –“
Dean stifled a sigh as he watched his brother’s concerned expression, “Uhm.”
“And why not?" she countered, "I get the feeling you haven’t had a lot of fun in your life. And, more than that, there’s a reason those things are included in this program. It helps with introspection, creating a calmer, safer environment for people to heal. Dean, I can sense this doesn’t come easy to you, but I’m going to need you to trust that, for now, the people in charge here know what’s best and wouldn’t do anything unless we truly believed it was necessary and conducive to this process.”
Cas darted his eyes back to Dean’s before he nodded. “I haven’t really laughed much for what feels like forever. But you make me laugh.”
“I don’t. You can do who and what you want. As long as he knows, you know. You shouldn’t get physical with other people without telling your partner.”
, he was staring at the laptop perched on his lap, the screen lit up with a Facebook photo that was crushing his lungs.
“It’s my turn to share my life story tomorrow,” Castiel said hesitantly.
“Charlie. Charlie brought me here,” Dean said, eyes darting to the door.
Please note, though, that there may be a one week delay in the next chapter. I am so, so sorry about this, but my life has gotten quite unexpectedly busy at the moment as I'm in the process of moving and have been assigned two new big projects at work. I will try to have it done by Sunday! But just in case, I wanted to communicate this with you
that look.
And as Dean thumbed the corners of the folder, he felt something small flicker inside him, something that did not feel like the uneasiness and emptiness he had felt since Chuck. But instead, the feeling felt warm and light. The feeling felt a lot like hope.
Dean lifted the edge of his fully buttoned flannel shirt to show Castiel the brace that was wrapped tightly around his chest, ugly yellowing bruises leaking from below the material. “I was in a car accident before I came here. I broke some ribs. It’s not that bad, just uncomfortable.”
“Third,” Sam says.
“Next time we’ll just kick the door in, how’s that? Then everyone and their mother’s mother will know where coming. Would that make you happy?”
He can hear Jo, Pam, and Ash alternate between cheers and catcalls. Dean wraps an arm around Castiel’s neck and waist, bringing him closer as he uses the hand behind Castiel’s back to flip them all off. The cheering just gets louder.
Dean points at a finger at him, “I’m not a little kid, Sam. I don't need you dangling a carrot to cure my bad mood.”
“And that’s too much work for just me, huh?” Dean asks, smiling as he wraps his arms around the angel, pulling him closer as they lean against the Impala.
So lost is he, that Cas fails to notice the unmistakeable sound of fluttering wings. He doesn’t recognize the small hairs on the back of his neck standing on end as a warning that something is nearby. In the middle of his breakdown, Cas falls unconscious. His last thoughts do not question why he tumbles so suddenly into oblivion, as perhaps they should. No, Cas’ last waking thought, like so many of the others, are of his Dean.
“The Impala has its comforts, but I find being in a car confining.”
Sam’s fingers fly across the screen of his phone as he walks towards the garage.
“Don’t want to,” Dean murmurs, snuggling in closer to Castiel.
“Brothers?”
“So far,” Rufus says.
The younger Winchester picks out a few yellows and purples.
Crowley makes his way out of the factory and slips out the door onto the street, pulling his collar up against a sudden burst of cold wind. A line of dark clouds drift closer, the rumble of thunder sounding off in the distance. A storm is rolling in. It takes him less than a second to realize that there are three demons tailing him. Abaddon isn’t half as dimwitted as he could hope for, but Crowley isn’t put out at the thought of a challenge.
“A shower,” Castiel says, amused, “and then probably some lunch. I imagine you’ll spend most of the afternoon sleeping.”
“You just don’t understand.”
Sam gives him a small smile, “Cas, you know this might not work.”
Crowley is, of course, caught by Abaddon’s goons a few blocks away from the abandoned paper factory she’s holed up in. He lets the demons take him, ignoring the moronic banter and insults they throw his way. A minute ago they had been his underlings. Their betrayal doesn’t come as a surprise since loyalty has never been a strong suit amongst demons, but as far as Crowley is concerned, they are all still beneath him, so their words mean little to the former king of Hell.
“The hell are you going to do with that?”
“I can’t imagine him younger, Cas. If he was really that old, he’d look like --”
Moving on might have been a bad idea, however. Crowley is taking his sweet time trying on the two suits he'd been willing to take a look at. Sam glances at Castiel as they wait near the fitting room area. Dean had lent him a pair of jeans and a T-shirt. Sam’s stuff is way too long for the former angel. Castiel had looked like a normal guy for a minute, but refused to walk outside without his trench coat, despite the heat. The combination left something to be desired as far as fashion goes. Dean had said it was like watching Linus with his blanket, an assessment Sam had to agree with.
The man smiles, “I’m sorry, did I give the impression that this was a Q & A? No, this is more of a lecture. The powers that be -”
“Dinner sounds great.”
Sam and Eileen had decided to build less than a mile away from the bunker. It gave them their own space while keeping Sam close enough to work.
“Cass? Castiel!” Dean says, skidding to a stop as he crouches down next to the fallen angel’s prone form.
He would never understand what made this version of Castiel tick. He would never know what had happened in the future to break the once unflappable soldier of God. What Dean does know is this Cas and his Castiel are far closer to each other than he will ever be willing to admit. But Castiel has Dean and, for whatever fucked up reason, Cas didn’t. At least for tonight, Dean could give him that.
Dean uses the truck to help himself stand as the remaining suit rounds on him. The angel swings at him, but Dean ducks out of the way. He hears the screech of blade scratching against the side of the pickup. Dean dives towards the now deceased angel, grabbing his blade as he rolls back up just in time to catch an armful of tall, dark, and vengeful. They fall back, Dean’s grip tight on the hilt of the blade as they crash to the ground. His head smacks hard against the pavement, but he is still able to thrust the blade up under the angel’s ribs. The guy flashes out, going limp as Dean pushes the body off of him.
Dean raises an eyebrow. The guy isn’t wrong.
Dean’s stomach drops, “Maybe Crowley lied. Wouldn't be the first time. If not... Well, you’ve lived a long time, Cass. Maybe you, I don’t know, forgot?”
“He didn’t say, but word travels fast, especially if the demons are moving as much as you say.”
“All right, if you insist,” Jack says, “But I would like to point out that it’s you two who are starting this off on the wrong foot by bringing along an extra passenger, so I’ll take no sass from either of you.”
“That’s fine,” Death says, standing. He’s getting entirely too old to be dealing with such children, “Leave them broken, but wasn’t it you that just said they deserve to be happy?”
Castiel looks at Bobby’s hand still on his shoulder. He wishes he could feel it as he would have been able to back on Earth, if Bobby were still alive.
Death bends down to pick up the bag of popcorn, sparing the Winchesters and their friends one last glance as they make their way out of the library and into the sun of a brand new day. He turns and, tossing a few more pieces of popcorn into his mouth, takes his leave.
“Think about it. They’re supposed to be as dead as the rest of us, right?”
“Is this how all your plans turn out?”
“So, he’s Heaven bound?”
“Then what is it?” Dean asks, taking a few steps back. It's like somewhere in his head he thinks if he distances himself physically, what's coming won't hurt as much.
“Haunted train, huh? Sammy and I dealt with a haunted, racist truck once.”
“Metatron has Cass --” Dean says, fighting against his brother's hold.
“Come on,” he says, leading the way down the last few alleys.
Castiel’s lips quirk in an almost grin as he puts the book he’d had in his hand back in it’s proper place, “And she let you pass?”
“I’m not,” the man says, almost offended.
The men holding them start to drag them out of the room. They make it as far as the hallway, the woman holding the door that leads back out into sunshine open for them when they hear the man’s voice call after them.
“I’ve been worse.”
“No, he’s fine,” Dean says, plopping down next to Sam on his bed, kicking his feet up as he crosses his legs at the ankles, “It’s just... He won’t let me kiss him.”
Dean grins at the greeting. The formal thing only works for Castiel. Besides, it’s kind of become one of those weird traditions people have in relationships. He’d only had that kind of thing once. That had been with Lisa, their relationship being Dean's longest and most successful to date. Dean hopes he and Castiel can beat that record by a few decades.
“What was that?”
Castiel jumps at the sound of Dean’s voice. He doesn’t look at the angel, but at least he’s acknowledging his existence.
16. I Want to Hold Your Hand - The Beatles
It's silent and it's awkward and even under normal circumstances Dean would be looking for any exit out of this situation. These aren't normal circumstances.
“Well, yeah,” Dean says, taken aback as he takes a few steps closer to Castiel, “Why wouldn’t I be?”
“You sure know how to make a guy feel good about himself,” Dean says, eying Joshua, “What the hell am I supposed to do? Let them lose it? Let them die?”
“Yes.”
Bobby looks around. They’re standing in the towering shadows of four buildings, just like the one he and Rufus had exited, all situated around the cobblestone square. It looks like most of their occupants are outside, only a few stragglers still making their way over. The dull roar of those gathered dissipates as the souls settle down. The man clears his throat.
Castiel’s hand is smooth against Dean’s calloused skin. He figures whatever the guy does for a living doesn't involve physical labor, especially considering the black suit and backwards blue tie.
“A church, I guess.”
The sun had already risen high above him before Castiel had moved, his body giving into its exhaustion as it sent him crashing to his knees and into blessed oblivion. He doesn’t remember anything after that until he had come screaming back into consciousness. He isn't unaccustomed to dreams and nightmares. Castiel had his share of both in the months before Sam trapped Michael and Lucifer back in Lucifer’s cage during the Apocalypse. This dream, however, felt so very unlike all those he had experienced back then.
Castiel studies the ring in his hand. He doesn’t notice anything different beside the chain that now runs through it. It’s the same color. It feels the same. Castiel twists it, looking for anything that might be off. He’s about to ask Dean what he’s talking about when he catches a glimpse of something on the inside of the band. Castiel brings it closer, trying to see the markings better.
“Yeah, yeah,” Gabriel says, waving her off, but Dean sees him wink at her as the five of them start up the stone steps of the church.
“I don’t –- What happened?”
“I know you’ve seen what Castiel is seeing.”
“I was trying to make a break for the bushes over there. Figured I’d hide out there until everyone went back inside,” Dean says, laughing, “I didn’t want to meet my new neighbors dressed like this.”
He does. Castiel is inches from his face, blue eyes staring back at him. Lips part, Castiel’s tongue sweeping out to wet his bottom lip. Dean can't help but stare. He feels the overwhelming need to lean in. To run his teeth across that bottom lip, drawing lines against it with his tongue. He wants to kiss him until they’re left panting, lips chapped within an inch of their life and then kiss him some more because why the hell haven’t they done this before?
“They're a failed experiment, and the first test stages of whatever Metatron’s end game here is, I’d imagine,” Charles says, crossing his arms, “Those creatures are a mix of Heaven’s human souls and a few select demons.”
“Maybe you should give him a call.”
He doesn’t like leaving Karen in here alone, even if Henry is going to be with her. Bobby puts his hand over hers for a moment before letting her go. The four of them split up, sneaking down to blend in with the rest of the human souls. Bobby can feel the anxiety in the air. Slipping through the people, he tries his best not to make it look like he’s going straight for one of the creatures. It's a difficult task considering the rest of the souls are doing everything in their power to get as far away from the creatures as possible despite the cramped accommodations.
“Sammy,” Dean says, voice low, “Hey c'mon, you’re having a nightmare.”
“Didn’t know demons sleep.”
Some stuff is spell work, but most of it seems to be different phrases spoken for different commands, concentration being the key more than anything else. Sam fills the role of teacher well, giving them the exact pronunciations until they’ve got it down. Too bad they don’t have a full-fledged demon lying around to test drive some of this stuff out on.
“Jeez, Dean,” Sam says, “indoor voice.”
killed me, but whatever,” Gabriel says, holding up his hands as he looks back to Sam and Dean, “Just know I’m going to need some recharge time when we get out of here.”
Dean dives for the gate, slipping through before the stone covers over completely. He falls through darkness, loosing track of what’s up and what’s down. He can’t see anything. He can’t hear anything. Not even the whistling of air as he plummets to whatever awaits him at the bottom. Dean opens his mouth, but the only thing that comes back to him is the echos of his own screams.
“It’s okay, Cas,” Dean mumbles against the angel's lips, giving him a quick kiss, “Move.”
“Vengeance is never cheap,” Simon says, leaning towards Sam, “But I wonder, why do you still fight?”
“I’m sorry.”
“I think so.”
Dean straightens out his jacket as he turns back toward Jack, Sam, and the wall, “Yeah, yeah.”
Dean dispatches five demons in a matter of minutes. He takes the time to assess his surroundings during a lull in the action near him. Castiel has a pile of bodies scattered around him. He has another demon on the ropes, pinned between a wall and the fallen angel’s blade. Sam has taken out a few more, the wall of muscles he’d had to deal with earlier taking him longer to deal with than normal.
“Cass, what happened?” Dean asks when Castiel finishes salting the last of the windows.
Sam leans towards Gabriel, “I’m going to get you for this later.”
Dean nods, looking for all the world like he’s trying not to laugh, “Wow. You sound really enthusiastic about it too.”
Sam watches his brother wave the golden harp around, “I don’t know, play it?”
Ears ringing, Dean scrambles to his feet. He half slides, half falls down the slope of the ditch. All he can see is the soles of Castiel’s brand new boots as Puriel looms over him, angel blade flashing in the sun as he slashes down.
“What kind of symbols?” Charles asks.
“Joshua.”
Dean comes to the conclusion that while drunken Sam grinning from ear to ear is funny, drunk Sam bitch-facing at him is down right hilarious.
The last rays of sunlight cast long shadows over the town. It will be dark soon, and without electric, harder to see. The demons had cut the power to the town long before any of them arrived. There will be no street lights on. No stray illumination will filter out from the windows of houses and businesses scattered along this street. It will make it harder to fight if this continues on into the night. The only light they’ll have is the moon, already up and just a little more than halfway full. It won’t be much, but at least it’s something. Sam takes a breath, turning back to the face the demons. He lets the breath go, and without another word, Sam steps out into the street.
They slip into their seats, Castiel turning the car on and flipping the dials to full blast. After just a minute or two of idling, the heat starts to seep through the car. Dean visibly relaxes. Castiel hadn’t noticed it earlier, but he was shivering.
“I have no idea what you’re talking about, but all right.”
“Is this a good time, Dean?” the angel asks, voice solemn.
He has become rather fond of them over the last few weeks spent in the Bunker. Dean’s eyes light up at the prospect.
“Naomi said that I was, but I don’t remember it,” Castiel says, “I don’t know. Sometimes I think maybe they’re more memory than dreams.”
Crowley snorts and tries to make what Kevin is sure would be some kind of snarky remark, but all that comes out is a choking cough. It takes more effort for Crowley to get each breath in. He grabs at Kevin’s shirt, trying to pull himself towards him. Kevin leans forward, trying to hear what Crowley is so desperate to say, but it’s unintelligible.
“Sam, shut up.”
“Why, are you robbing me?” Castiel asks, deadpan, but Dean thinks he detects a hint of sarcasm.
“I can’t say I’ve ever heard the word ‘bitch’ used in such good terms.”
Sam sighs, talking low, “We can’t be in two places at once, Dean.”
“Dean,” Castiel says, his voice every bit as commanding as the first few times they’d met, “Now.”
They stand there, gasping for air. Dean rests against him, as the cool night air breezes by ghosting across their sweat soaked bodies. Cas feels Dean gliding his fingers up and down his arm, coming dangerously close to Cas’ hand. He tenses and Dean must feel it because he stops, hand resting on Cas’ forearm.
Risa stares at him in shock, “So, a demon tells you where Satan’s going to be and you just believe it?”
The only response he gets is a long drawn out, “Ahhh!” that echos through the shadowy junkyard. A scrap of blue trails behind Castiel as they round a corner, heading towards the garage. He’s able to grab Castiel once they’re inside, taking hold of one of the angel’s coat sleeves. He pins Castiel against the Impala, the car still parked in Bobby’s garage. Dean had been working on her earlier.
“We don’t know, she just kind of uh,” Sam says, glancing at John, “appeared.”
“I didn’t want to give it back to you like a ring ring, because, I don’t know... That’s kind of a whole different ballgame, but I uh,” Dean says, clearly flustered, "I guess I just thought you might like to wear it instead of just keeping it tucked away in your pocket.”
“No, nothing that size,” Crowley says, leaning towards her, his voice dropping to a growl, “Try at least a hundred.”
“20 across,” Sam says, pointing at the crossword as he reads, “Planets and notes in a musical scale.”
“Cass? Are you all right?”
“Did it help?”
“Huh, fresh blood,” a man says, smiling as he makes his way through the crowd towards Bobby and Rufus, “Been awhile since we’ve had anyone new. We were starting to worry there wasn’t anyone left out there to cause any trouble.”
“Another long story and to be honest, we don't got all the details yet. Whatever you got going on down on Earth is probably just as bad as what we’ve got going upstairs. We’re here to dismantle this place, and the other ones like it.”
“I hate to break up this touching family reunion, but we need to get moving,” Jack says, behind them.
“But Dean prefers pie.”
Dean finds himself flat on his stomach. Everything is fuzzy. He isn’t sure if that’s because he’s coming up on the end of his rope or if he added a concussion to the long list of stuff wrong with him during the quake. Either way, Dean’s grateful. Without him weighing Castiel down, the fallen angel can get out of this damned place. Dean closes his eyes, waiting for death or unconsciousness to take him. He has never been much for praying and the only times he has prayed was to Castiel, but he sends up a prayer to whoever might have their ears on that his angel makes it out all right.
“This person also runs around outside.”
They wander around, stopping here and there to enjoy ghost stories and play games. Sam and Castiel try their luck bobbing for apples, both of them coming up drenched and without an apple. Gabriel cracks a joke about Sam messing up his hairstyle, his little brother retaliating by shaking his head at him, pelting the archangel with water. Jack points at something that’s caught his eye a few booths down, skipping towards it as Gabriel and Sam follow behind him, bickering the entire way. Dean grabs a towel from the apple bob booth, tossing it to Castiel.
“I don’t care what Joshfell says, Evelyn, I’m not rushing my meal. It’s bad for my digestion.”
“I bet being God’s ear has it’s perks.” Dean says, shooting for nonchalance and hoping he lands somewhere in the ball park.
“Can’t one of you stay? Like an ambassador from Heaven or something?”
“Yeah, I know that feeling, but we’ll get there,” Sam says, sounding lame even to his own ears. Kevin doesn’t comment as he returns to reading the tablet in front of him, “Have you found anything?”
When they return, Cas proudly holds up his sheet with a shy smile, “Like this?”
“What about you?” Castiel asks, “What do you do, Dean?”
Castiel blinks at him, “Really?”
Grabbing his shoulder, Castiel pulls Dean to him and kisses him, hard and fierce. There’s so much love behind it, but this is not a loving kiss. It’s hungry and desperate. Dean responds to him in kind, hand grabbing Castiel’s hair as his other hand clutches at his trench coat. They’ve only had a few months together like this and as Castiel gathers Dean closer, he finds himself very close to damning his Father for ripping them apart so soon.
Dean pauses, picking at a piece of wood sticking up on the arm of the bench, “I didn’t know what they were until you mentioned it.”
Dean almost drops his weapon.
God, he’s an idiot.
“Why are we here?” Dean asks, wheezing as another wave of pain smashes through him, “What’s happening to me?”
“Cass -”
It’s like the world decides to tilt sideways on him and forgets to give Dean the memo. He can’t tell if he wants to scream, cry, or gank something. If Naomi had been controlling Castiel before, then when did it start? How much of what had happened in the last few years had been Castiel? Dean assumes the whole ditching Heaven for Team Free Will during the Apocalypse wasn’t planned, but what about Castiel going all Emperor Palpatine and wreaking havoc upstairs and down afterwards? Why would they let that happen if they had an off switch installed the whole time? Hell, was Castiel even Castiel when Dean first met him? No wonder the fallen angel is freaking out, Dean is freaking the hell out.
Bobby can see the glint of an angel blade in his hand, “Where in the hell did you get that?”
“Then I’ll kill him for getting there first.”
“Surly with a side of attitude?”
“Cas?” Dean manages to ask, feeling more exhausted than he has in years, despite the Apocalypse. He pulls out of Cas as gentle as he can, but remains wrapped around him, not willing to let the other man go, “Told you I had you, see?”
“We need to get out of here,” Dean says, voice quiet as he grabs Sam’s arm and all but drags him down the aisle, “We shouldn’t be here.”
“To what end?” Rufus asks, "Why be so careful about it?"
“It’s the place we first met.” Dean says with a shrug, “Or the closest thing I want to get to it.”
“But, if one angel trying to have a conversation can do that much damage,” Rufus says, looking back at Bobby, “what could they have been doing to rock all of Heaven? Angel karaoke?”
Charles nods.
Dean thinks for a moment, “My soul.”
Dean bursts out laughing, letting loose of Castiel’s hand. He pulls him in with one arm around his shoulder as the two of them start walking down the hallway. Castiel snakes an arm around Dean's waist as they head towards the parking garage and the Impala.
Sam opens his mouth to explain, but there’s really nothing to say. He’s not even sure how this all happened in the first place. Gabriel is unfortunately never at a loss for words and fills in for him.
“Yeah,” Dean says, “and I guess I’m not used to having to worry about you needing any of this stuff on a regular basis.”
“You did this,” Dean says.
“Way to boost morale.”
“Uh...”
“How long did it take for Jack to show up last time?” Sam asks.
“What would you have us do?”
“I’m fine. Get the hell out of here, Sammy.”
“It’s unlisted,” Dean says, crossing his arms.
“Your soul had been so thoroughly damaged that the trip was killing you. Castiel’s orders were to retrieve you, but not by any means necessary. Important as you were, I imagine Heaven could have found a replacement in a pinch.”
Sam smirks, as Crowley glares at him before returning to his crossword puzzle. He leans over to see what progress Crowley has made.
“Yeah, okay. If it means that much to you.”
“Not exactly. Here,” Sam says, grinning as he passes his phone over to Crowley.
Dean glances down at himself, before looking back up at Castiel, “I think I can squeak by on the ‘no shoes, no shirt’ rule with what I’ve got here.”
**********
Bobby sticks his head out, looking both ways down the hall. People are starting to flood the cooridor, making their way to the stairwells. He turns back to Rufus, shrugs, then heads out to join the crowd. The city appears to be much the same from what Bobby had glimpsed from the building, both in the apartments and his adventure dangling on the outside. It's daylight. The sun beams down on them between infrequent clouds as a gentle breeze glides through the buildings. It's perfect, in a "Better Home and Gardens" kind of way.
There was a time that was true. Not so long ago, Kevin had been all for killing Crowley without remorse or second thought. Sam had talked him out of it. He’d seen something in Crowley that no one else could at the time. The problem is Kevin has come to see it too.
“The wedding night,” Dean says, looking up long enough to wiggle his eyebrows suggestively.
“No, it’s not. I’m assuming you all have been doing some research while I’ve been away doing all the heavy lifting. One lord of Hell is your worst case scenario,” Crowley says, pointing at the list, “This doesn’t even register on the Richter scale of the most awful things that could possibly happen.”
“You too, Sam.”
Dean nods against him as he moves his hand down to lift Cas’ leg, drawing it back to rest against his own. Dean pushes in slow, fighting against the urge to bury himself too quick into that deliciously tight heat. As he closes that last little bit of distance, Dean lets out a rush of air he hadn’t even known he’d been holding. He pauses, clutching at Cas and letting him adjust. That must be a good call. The tension starts to dissipate as he feels the fallen angel almost relax in his arms.
“I like the rain.”
“I am a great many things, but a cock block isn’t one of them. Just don’t tell Sam.”
Dean turns his attention back to the tunnel. It’s too dark to see to the other side. He pulls out a flashlight, flipping it on. Trapping it between his hand and the barrel of his gun, Dean starts down the tunnel. The sound of Castiel’s footfalls echo after his. The light only penetrates so far, giving Dean a good view of the moldy, stone walls surrounding them. He can hear water dripping, intermixed with the rumbling sound. It gets louder the further in they walk. At what he figures is the halfway point, Dean stops and puts the hand holding the flashlight out to feel along the wall. He doesn’t feel any vibration. Nothing’s coming.
He looks the same, though maybe a little younger than Dean remembers him being when he’d died. His eyes are less haunted. His smile brighter. Wider. It reminds Dean of the Bobby he’d known back when he was still a kid. Back when Dad would drop him and Sam off to stay at Bobby's place.
“What’s his first name?”
“She was. This time.”
“Everything we’ve built,” Sam says, an edge to his voice.
“It’s nothing new. I’ve had people flirt with me numerous times during my travels on Earth.”
Castiel tilts his head to the side, “I’m already where I’m meant to be.”
14. In the Dark - Billy Squire
“You truly don’t mind?” Castiel asks, the sound muffled by his arms.
(See the end of the chapter for
It reminds Dean of all the early mornings he’d had to rouse a much younger Sam out of bed earlier than he should have been for some hunt Dad needed to get to or because of some emergency. His little brother had never been the easiest kid to get up, but having to drag him out to the Impala at one or two in the morning was always a fight. To make up for it, Dean used to wrap Sam up in a blanket and let the kid cuddle around him in the backseat as they drove through the night off to some new town, Dad silent in the front seat, hands gripping the wheel.
“Tell them help’s coming,” Dean calls over to Sam.
He looks back at the list and scans further down, coming to a stop on a name he knows.
“Cas, please,” Dean whispers into the crook of his neck, “It’s okay. I’ve got you.”
Castiel leans against the Impala, watching the two brothers with his mouth hanging open. It’s clear to Sam that he’s as shocked as they are, but Dean can’t see it. Sam would be surprised if Dean could see anything other than red at this point.
“I thought it might be cold.”
“He sacrificed himself to save Kevin?”
“Because it’s always been you. Don’t get me wrong, Cas and I are friends. Good friends. But lets be honest, there’s something going on between you two.”
“That will come in handy. Do you think he could take a look at these names? See if he can locate these people? At least find out what section they’ve been sent to work in.”
“Hey Jess,” Dean says, somewhere off to Sam’s left.
“No,” Dean growls, holding Cas tighter to him.
“Don’t make promises that fine little ass of yours can’t keep,” Gabriel says far too loudly, giving him a lewd wink.
“Guess this new desktop setting is permanent.”
Oh god, he’s getting the “it’s not you, it’s me” speech. Dean’s thoughts screech to a halt. This is his worst case scenario, but it’s not like he hasn’t been waiting for it. He knows he’s not good for Castiel. Dean isn't good for anyone. Look at what he put Lisa and Cassie through. He’s not stupid enough to think Castiel would want to stick around for a guy with an airplane cargo hold full of emotional baggage. He tries to remain calm, even as his heart is threatening to abandon ship by beating right out of his chest.
Granted, he’s sleepy again, but that’s nothing new and not even surprising, all things considered. It feels like forever since they’ve been together like this and if Dean was that excited about it, Castiel has got to be feeling it too. Dean knows he is. He could feel Castiel’s dick pressing hard against his leg when he’d been pinning him down.
“Nah, I think Bobby would like it,” Dean says, turning to give Castiel a smile, “You’re family, man.”
“Leave him alone, you son of a bitch,” Dean shouts, launching himself at the angel as he rams the blade deep in Puriel’s side.
“How do you know Mary?” John asks.
Sam groans. It had been too much to hope for civility to last the whole day.
Smirking at the memory, Dean turns away from “Night of the Living Dead” to address his brother, “You have a problem with Romero, Sammy?”
“No, you shouldn’t have.”
“Finished it,” Dean mumbles into the crease behind Castiel’s ear before moving to nibble on his earlobe.
“Maybe you shouldn’t lead with asking the guy for favors. It makes us rescuing him from retirement seem a little disingenuous.”
21. Time Has Come Today - The Chambers Brothers
“Dean, go after him.”
“I was drunk! That doesn’t count!” Dean says, laughing as he pulls the angel closer to him.
Castiel doesn’t decide to do it, he just finds himself there. The dry, forever chapped lips of what once was only a vessel to him press against the forgiving softness of Dean’s. Seconds pass and Castiel expects to be pushed away. He waits for Dean to jump up, shouting, “What the hell, Cas?!” Castiel would not be surprised if Dean tried to shoot him on principle alone.
“We’re not leaving our parents in here,” Dean says, all but getting up in the archangel’s face, “What chance do they have with you gone?”
Castiel feels a pull, a tug at the back of his mind. Eyes opening, he sees the sun is only minutes from passing beyond the horizon line. His body must have tensed because Dean’s grip on him tightens as he looks at the angel, those beautiful green eyes filled with misery.
“Bobby says you and Jack did all of this,” Dean says gesturing around at the clearing.
“Castiel.”
**********
Figures.
Their first priority had been to fortify the room, placing hex bags and painting warding symbols over the walls, making them invisible to demons. Crowley had winced when he got too close to a few of the symbols, but nothing seems to hinder him from moving around. They crashed after that, both exhausted from the trip. The morning was spent finishing up their redecorating project. Dean had called and given them the lowdown on the Jophiel situation, telling Sam that he and Castiel would be spending the evening at an abandoned, supposedly haunted tunnel. His brother had sounded less than thrilled.
“It’s about time you boys made it here. I was starting to think you wouldn’t come.”
“Yes, sir.”
“We’re looking for Jophiel,” Castiel says, unfazed and straight to the point, as always.
“Demon’s blood,” Jack says, closing the lid on the jar Peter had given her, “Special vintage.”
“Don’t fall asleep, man.”
Death raises an eyebrow, “Hello to you too, Gabriel. Didn’t I reap you awhile back?”
“Yes well, I didn’t bring him here for show and tell,” Death says, “Due to Crowley’s selfless sacrifice, he is now considered too good to be sent back to Hell.”
Castiel lit up from the inside, his blood singing in his veins. He was gripping Dean’s face, his hair, his neck, everything he could get his hands on. Dean tasted like acceptance, like freedom. Dean was pulling Cas tighter and tighter, as if he wanted even the idea of distance not to exist between their legs, their chests. As if he
Cas’ throat dried as Dean kept staring. There was a very long, very charged pause.
Dean watched as Cas’ eyes filled with tears, and he couldn’t stop his own eyes from doing the same.
Trigger/ Content Warnings: reference to previous suicide attempt
“No,” Castiel interjected, “nothing like that. But I am worried about him. Really worried and I just realized that this is how you must have been feeling for almost two months now. It’s tiring and it’s heavy. And I am just so grateful, and I’m so sorry you felt that for so long, and still feel it.”
“Okay, yeah it’s a little confusing. Let’s backtrack,” Eileen clarified. She ran her hand through her hair as her face scrunched in concentration.
“Sorry, I didn’t mean to interrupt you or hold you up, but I’m supposed to go to the cafeteria for dinner, and I have no idea how to get there.”
“He’s there,” Jack said simply, smiling at Dean. Dean had never ran so fast in his life,  including the time he was chased by a pack of werewolves on a solo hunt in his teens.

and picked the first ACDC album he could find, hit shuffle and turned it up as loud as he could. The sound quality wasn’t great, but it was loud enough to serve his purpose, to make sure any sounds he made were covered.
Billie had ensured an iron clad restraining order was delivered to John before Sam was even discharged from hospital. There was no way John was showing up today. Although, admittedly, the odds of him showing up even if there was not a legal reason keeping him away was almost zero. So, Sam did not have his parents at his graduation, but that didn’t mean he didn’t have his family.
“It’s great that she’s going to Stanford too. It's nice that they will have each other," Cas continued as he gazed out the window.
“Holy fuck,” was Dean’s exceptionally witty response.
“Civil? Cas, you wanted to act
There was a long silence before Meg responded, “Cas, you don’t have to give me the logical answer.”
He sat himself up, ran a hand through his hair and rubbed at his eyes roughly. He blinked a couple of times, and then, out of nowhere, he was holding the gaze of deep cerulean eyes. The eyes placed in an exceptionally beautiful face – dark stubble coating a strong jawline. The stranger’s hair was pointing in a million different directions in a painfully endearing way. The man tugged at his hair, and Dean was suddenly faced with the urge to do the exact same thing. And then, he was smiling at Dean, something soft and gentle, and Dean couldn’t help himself, he returned his smile. And, encouraged by the fact that he wasn’t breaking the eye-contact, Dean winked at him. The man’s entire face turned a very entertaining shade of red, and Dean tried and failed to suppress the urge to chuckle. He found that he was unable to stop smiling.
Dean followed Castiel’s lead, quietly falling into step beside him. They had barely made it through the door before Castiel whirled on Dean, “What’s going on with you?”
Dean nodded, as she walked towards the door.
, just better. Apparently having angry sex with an ex was all he needed to get his brain to shut up and leave him alone for a few hours.
Dean snapped his head up at that. “You need to keep yourself safe and healthy and alive. If not for yourself, then for those who it would shatter to lose you.”
It was exhausting, and Dean had no idea what Sam was saying half the time. But Sam smiled every time he saw Dean, a big childlike smile that lit up his face. And Dean was just so fucking happy that his brother was awake.
that Cas could understand what it meant, what he was saying without the words that refused to come from him.
“It’s not for calming down, it’s for getting me in the right mindset,” she said smiling earnestly, “so I was listening to
“Did you listen when they did the safety procedure? In case of an emergency, you have to put your own mask on before helping those around you.”
“You’re a part of this family,” Dean said softly, wincing at the memories of the times he had let the boy down. He lowered his eyes and started fidgeting with a book that had been left discarded on the table.
“Yes, I am sure you can. But, you do have your injuries, and I was told to take you to the loading dock in this wheelchair.”
“We should?”
“I want you to hurt the way that I did,” Dean visibly cringed when the words were out of his mouth. He hadn’t intended to say that. The fact that Dean didn’t realize that Cas has been hurting, has been an open wound, for the past five years was baffling. He was so sure it was written all over his face.
a look laced with kindness, curiosity and intrigue. Castiel realized that he really hoped he could get Dean to look at him like that again. And again. And again.
“May I kiss you?”
Castiel remembered that Dean also had quite a visceral reaction to his life story. Dean was someone who felt things acutely, even though he would deny this. He felt things deeply, but not just his own emotions. He seemed to feel and reflect what other people were experiencing. Castiel, therefore, wasn’t too concerned, but he made sure that Dean was always in arm's reach, that he always had his hand in his, or a hand on his elbow or back. It was a reminder to Dean that Castiel was there.
She was crying heavily at this point, and Castiel found that he, himself, was unable to hold back the occasional tear that fell down his face. Dean had grabbed his hand before the first drop of water dripped onto his shirt.
He wanted
“Yes Dean,” came the simple response.
Thank you so much to those of you who have read and left kudos on this! And particularly to those who left comments, you have no idea how much your feedback and your engagement with this story means to me.
It didn’t mean he wouldn’t complain. He would just do it silently.
“No,” Dean admitted, “I mean, I know that this is a long-term facility and that I’m here for the next eight weeks. I know that I have to see a shrink alone twice a week and that there’s group therapy sometimes…”
He was going home today.
Strategizing was a very fraught process that lasted much longer than anyone had expected. Sam’s anxiousness was exacerbated by his brother’s deteriorating physical and mental state. Dean was almost impossible to be around, but Sam would not leave him alone either. Dean was distant, moody and snapping at everyone. He never left Cas’ side, even sleeping on a dilapidated couch he had dragged into his room that first night. Sam, however, doubted that the sleep he was receiving was in anyway restful. He had spent his entire life with his brother and was very familiar with the drawn look that etched itself into Dean’s face when his dreams were twisted into nightmares.  After the circles under his eyes darkened alarmingly, Sam basically refused to leave Dean’s side. He knew he was annoying his brother, Dean’s very pointed and obvious eye rolls sent a clear message, but Sam knew that Dean tended to get reckless when he was in this state. And seeing as Dean was insisting on being the one who would have to venture into the Empty, Sam needed to ensure Dean was in the right mental space for this. He would not lose his brother due to Dean’s tendencies to disregard his own life if it meant saving someone else’s. Not after everything they have been through.
Dean let out a startled laugh, “That doesn’t sound like a no.”

“Of course, Dean. I was going to read for a bit. Would that bother you?”
He was about to skulk – no, uhm, confidently
“Yeah, he won’t let me stock any other type anymore.” Sam said fondly.
“I’m sorry I haven’t come sooner, Sammy. I’m sorry that I told you I was coming back and only managed to do that almost nine weeks later.”
Dean started to protest but Sam stopped him by placing a hand on his shoulder, “Hey man, you look like crap. You’ve barely eaten or slept in days. Remember what you told me way back when we got abducted by all those gods? You told me I was no use to you burnt out. And you were right.  You’re no use to Cas if you don’t look after yourself, you get that right?”
and a questionable motel.  And the catch was that, if you were traveling alone, you would be forced to share the space with a stranger.
The one thing Dean would not have expected was how quickly Gabe and Meg took to Sam. They seemed to genuinely like the kid, and often when Dean got home from work, exhausted and covered in grime from the scrap yard, he would find Sam watching tv with Gabe while yelling animatedly at the screen, or he would find him discussing some sort of sociological concept with Meg. The latest one Dean had walked into was Meg lecturing Sam, a very willing audience, on deconstructing the male gaze in film. They were eating ice cream straight out of the container.
Dean breathed out shakily and wiped a single tear away with his thumb.
“I – I don’t know,” Dean felt extremely anxious at the thought of not seeing Sam for another three weeks.
Dean was hard and warm in his hand and
. Oh, how he’d missed that sound. Cas thought his knees would give out. He attached his lips to Dean’s neck, licking the expanse of skin as his hands dropped to the buckle on Dean’s belt. It had been so long since he’d done anything like this, since he even wanted anything like this. If his senses weren’t so completely submerged in Dean, he might even have been nervous.
by Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran.
“What are you going to do now, your first night as a free man and all that?” Gabriel asked after he drained the last of his drink.
Dean nodded; he could respect that. He would, however, struggle with not making jokes. This whole process was the most uncomfortable thing he had ever experienced (okay, potentially not as uncomfortable as his first time with Benny, but that was a vastly different experience to the one he was facing now) and joking about what he was going through had always been a way to lessen the intensity of what he was experiencing. It was as if the humor turned his emotions into shades of grey instead of full color.
“And then, you will take an official hospital transportation vehicle. I will accompany you, as it is not possible for anyone else to do so at the moment.”
“What do you mean?”
“Where do you go every morning?” The question met Castiel as he walked into his room.
He says things that leave Dean reeling but, more than anything, makes him want to cradle the words to his chest, hold them gently, as if by keeping them secure, he could make them true. Like right now, when Cas is so unabashedly studying Dean, confessing how the world was more vivid with him in it. And Dean suddenly understood with certainty that, even though he never realized it, he had been waiting his whole life for someone to look at him in exactly the way Cas was now.
Because the fact of the matter is, Dean is still as undeniably in love with Castiel Novak now as he was five years ago. The day Cas left him, he left with Dean’s heart, shredded and mangled, in his hands. The reason it could never work with anyone else was because his chest was empty, there was nothing to give. It has stayed with Cas.
Castiel couldn’t imagine what hearing that must have done to Dean, who had spent his life shielding his brother, carrying the brunt of their father’s abuse and neglect, tearing himself in pieces so that his brother didn’t have to.
“What?”
… because Sam has been there, in that godforsaken hospital room, not waking up, and I.. I’ve been here, being
Dean made a sound that was somewhere between a whine and a grunt. Cas chuckled as he sat cross-legged on his bed. He cocked his head to one side and gave Dean a pointed look. He tried not to marvel at how gracefully Castiel moved into the position. Dean was reminded of how sensually and easily Cas had moved into the various positions during the yoga class yesterday. The guy was
“The bathroom is over there,” Dean assumed Cas had pointed in the direction of the second bathroom, but he didn’t see it. He was perfectly content to keep his eyes locked where they were, to stare at this god-awful carpet for the next nine days.
“You have a lady-friend, Sammy boy?” Gabe asked with a teasing grin.
The small green book had
Dean shrugged and exhaled shakily. He hadn’t told anyone that, not since Cassie. He didn’t know why he shared this with Castiel now. His hand was still in Castiel’s, and he shifted his weight a bit as he tried to get more comfortable without breaking the contact. He winced sharply as the movement shot pain up his sides.
written in gold.
Castiel sighed, desperately wanting to take this weight from Dean. He lifted his hand and pressed it into Dean’s chest lightly, and Dean followed his unvoiced instructions, lying down onto the bed. Castiel slotted himself in behind Dean, pulling Dean’s back into his chest. He nuzzled into the back of Dean’s neck. Dean dissolved against him, and the pain in Castiel’s chest receded as he felt him breathing in his arms.
So I know this chapter is two days early, but I had a really stressful and shitty day and writing & posting make me feel better, so here we are!
And there he was.
A sniffle caught his attention, and Castiel saw Gabriel palming his red-rimmed eyes, “What? Never seen a grown man cry in the reception building of a psychiatric facility before?”
Dean kissed the soft skin behind Cas’ ear before pulling away.
He knew he was pathetic for still being this ridiculously and painfully hung up on a man whose presence in his life had all but evaporated over five years ago. But the fact of the matter was, Dean Winchester was the love of his goddamn life. And he knew there wasn’t ever going to be someone else that fit with him the way Dean did, who Cas loved that deeply.
“It is,” Castiel agreed, running a hand through his hair. As was customary with the policies at
But, to Cas’ surprise, Dean shook his head. “No, it’s interesting. Really, and it’s great that you had a good time.”
Dean’s jaw tightened, and his hand balled into fists, “Look, it was shit. Okay? I know that, but dwelling on it isn’t gonna help anyone. It isn’t gonna change him, isn’t gonna change what happened. So, what’s the point in talking about it? We survived. That’s what matters.”
The grace had started glowing brighter and brighter until suddenly, in a bright burst of light, Cas was at Dean’s feet, his life force taking the form of his current vessel, the one back in Dean’s room. But as Sam had suspected, Cas was asleep. Dean flinched, scared that the light had woken something up. So, he worked quickly: saying the spell, carving the symbol on both Cas’ and his arm. Dean felt giddy when he saw Cas’ life force enter his arm and the amulet fall back to his body. He turned in the direction he came from and sprinted flat out to the flashing light.
“Dean, there is nothing you can do for him right now. Where you are is where you are doing the most good. Get stronger, here,” she pointed at her head, “so that you can be strong enough for the both of you without it hurting you in the long run. Talk to Missouri about Sam; ask her how to help him when he comes round again, what to do when you get scared, how to help without forcing yourself to shoulder the guilt. Spend some time on yourself because once he gets out… you’re his legal guardian, there’s going to be a lot you are going to have to deal with.”
He had smiled when Cas had walked over to him and had placed a gentle kiss to his forehead. Had smiled when he had called him handsome.
Dean frowned, and his heart rate accelerated at the tense set of Cas’ shoulders, of the urgency that seemed to be screaming from the state of things. He stepped towards him, “Cas?”
Sam calls for re-enforcements, Dean gets an unexpected gift and Cas struggles with the Empty induced sleep.
Why was it
“And the reason you can’t just snap him out of this is?” Dean asked Jack.
“It hardly seems fair that you know about me when I know nothing about you,” Dean said.
Dean inhaled deeply, “I want to. I want to make it up to him.”
. And it felt like I had lost a part of me, like an arm or a leg, something I fundamentally did not know how to live without. You were gone, and I was off balance. And I just kept reliving that moment over and over. It was one of the worst things that ever happened to me. I lost you. I lost myself. You’re my compass Cas. Not a moral compass necessarily, but you keep me from getting lost in all the darkness that has been infiltrating my life for as long as I can remember. You point me in the direction that allows me to be myself, the direction that makes sure I don't get stuck in my sinister tendencies and coping mechanisms. You’re my lighthouse Cas. My guide. And it was so dark when you were gone…. But then when we got you back. And the joy I felt in just
“I was fucking born ready,” Dean answered, his eyes never leaving Cas’ body.
Dean hadn’t really trusted anyone in his life. Well, excluding Sam and Cassie, that is. And even then, most of his nights were haunted by a panic that was in the shape of Sam growing up and outgrowing Dean.
“Anytime, Cas,” Dean said happily, and then shifted so that he was lying on his side, so he could look at Cas, “Really. Anytime.”
Dean. Turned his world upside down and then checked out. Traded his life for Dean’s. As if his life was worth a fraction of the selfless and ethereal angel’s. Made the decision that Dean would be left without him. Made the decision for Dean. Without consulting him. As if Dean would ever be able to survive a world without him. Cas was his best friend. His anchor. His conscience. He was the goddam love of his life.
(See the end of the chapter for
Castiel felt a confusing flash of emotions at the sentiment. He used to fear them, the emotions, but his time with the two hunters had taught him to embrace them. To feel all of it.
Cas clucked his tongue impatiently, and Dean rolled his eyes but sat up, and as he did so, Dean noticed Cas staring at his chest. Dean slept without a shirt on most nights. He felt a little flustered now, with Cas staring at him so openly. His stomach started contorting itself into oddly shaped knots.
“Couldn’t sleep,” Dean said, noncommittally.“ Probably jet lag or something.” Or his first love being in spitting distance of him.
“And if you don’t, because sometimes you won’t, then I got you.”
The lady in the lab coat had taken his hand gently, “Dean, your brother wasn’t in the car.”
“He does have magnificent hair.”
“Which wasn’t exactly a ‘no’, and if you weren’t sure Sam would be around to need you anymore...” Amara shrugged.
“That would be nice,” she said, “if I’m not interrupting anything.”
, with Cas wearing the cheap cowboy hat and his trench coat. He had looked so … undeniably Cas. And Dean had wanted to remember that, wanted to always come back to the joy he felt sitting in the car with the man he had lost and who had returned to him.
Castiel, of course, had always known this intellectually, but right now, all of this, the toll it put on her, the sacrifices she made, her love and support, all of it just surrounded him and plunged him into an ocean of regret and love and appreciation.
“I’m sure you are,” Castiel agreed absent mindedly and then blushed again. Dean’s own cheeks filled with a tinge of red as he eyed Castiel curiously.
The next couple of days pass in a blur. Sam is agitated and confused, constantly forgetting where he is and talking nonsense. Dean had been very concerned when, during that first visit, after Sam had looked at him directly, the first thing he asked him was, “
to him. Or at least kept a crucial truth away from him. The frustration and regret and rage was running through him like a fever. He wanted to scream. He wanted to punch something.
“Dean,” Castiel breathed as Dean grabbed onto the doorframe, as if standing up was difficult, as if he didn’t have the energy to remain upright on his own.
That’s what happened when you lived in a small, long-term psychiatric care facility where entertainment was limited – news travelled fast, and gossip travelled faster. He had heard the new name buzzing for about a week before the medical vehicle had lazily crested the hill at the edge of the center’s property early one Saturday morning. Castiel watched the van’s lazy descent as the sun rose, coating the sky in a soft, warm light.
Castiel leaned the side of his head against Dean’s and squeezed where his hand was resting on Dean’s shoulder.
. He thought he heard Cas make a desperate hissing sound. Dean lifted his hands to run it over Cas’ back, tracing every ridge of his spine with one hand and then the other. He closed his eyes again, trying to memorize the feel of the hard muscles on the angel’s back, to engrain the exact texture of Cas skin into his brain.
Dean stilled; he didn’t want to think about the accident. Didn’t want to think of those moments. Not right now. Not when he was so happy.
“Like what you see?” Dean demanded, his tone cocky, confident, and his knees absolutely not suggesting this was the point at which he should follow his training and sink slowly, gracefully, into a position of passive display.
“We are?”
Castiel shrugged his concern away. “A single rogue Alpha without a pack is no threat to anyone. Besides, a deal was struck and the canon of that is clear. In saving my life the Omega purchased a blood-debt from our pack. His brother’s life for mine.  And the blood debt cannot be transferred now even were negotiation still possible.

“He’s just a pint-sized puppy,” Bobby pointed out, as though he could read Charlie’s mind, “But the gig is up anyway. Time to man up and go see Castiel Krushnic. Your brother needs you to finally get off your ass and pull your weight, boy. Time for the whole Campbell/Krushnic shit to get resolved.

He could feel the blood pooling under the injury, feel the sensations of a bruise forming under his skin, could feel the debilitating shock of the blow reverberating through his whole body.

“A lot of hair,” Dean said. “Flowy hair. Pretty, but not very practical for fighting. But I guess you could tie it back or plait it.”
Sam knew he could be spotted and stopped at any moment if any of the other Fire Men saw what he was attempting.
“You also are Wolfkin. Evidently,” Cas pointed out dryly.
“Sam, meet  Emmett Milton, owner of this fine establishment. Milton, this is Sam Winchester.”
Embarrassingly, as grateful as Dean was to the great writer, he didn’t actually care that he hadn’t met him. The only author Dean was fanboying about himself was C.J. Novak.
In such a tiny town, the idea carried a surprising amount of truth. It was a living reversal of the story of the horseshoe nail. For instance, already that morning he had supplied a replacement microwave tripod arm to Sarah O’Hare. That tiny $3.99 piece of plastic would ensure that when Frank O’Hare inevitably returned home late that night, somewhat the worse for drink, his supper would be supplied piping hot. Frank would therefore not slip into a drunken rage with his wife over a cold dinner. Sarah would not be forced to lock herself in the bathroom—again—and phone Jody near midnight. Jody would not need to race out of the house to rescue her. Jody’s wife, Donna, would not decide to devour a pint of Ben and Jerry’s to console her loneliness only to spend the entire next day in bitter regret over the indulgence.
“What the fuck do you want?” Milton snarled.
“You definitely look like the Ghost of Christmas Future,” Sam countered.
Then he smirked as he imagined the look of surprise on the Auditor’s face when he next visited.
And promptly fainted.
"Oops," Dean winced. "Getting rewarded with a trank up your jacksie probably hasn't convinced you to try it again."

Food became more bountiful in the shallower water. Shoals of silver mackerel slipped past him in numbers so vast he could reach out his hands and simply snatch a snack without even pausing. Despite the irritation of the way their tiny bones constantly caught between his teeth, he was glad of their oil rich flesh. His constant swimming and irregular diet had stripped his body of the soft padding afforded by his Atlan upbringing. He had always been relatively slim and Dean’s insistence on preparing him for his journey for the last three years had given him a degree of muscle. But after these months of journeying, he was reaching the wrong side of lean and every cord and sinew was sharply defined on his chest and arms.

“They said Raphael died by fire too,” Anna said, with a wry smile. “But it wasn’t true. She died with Mary. Like I should have died with Anna.”
He turned to his computer, tapped a few letters into his keyboard then grinned in satisfaction. “Indeed,” he said.  “Spangler and Zeddmore vs Richard Roman Enterprises.  It didn’t reach further than District court though.  Mister Roman, Senior, successfully convinced the federal judge in the case that the young gentlemen in the case were merely patent trolls. There was, it should be said, considerable evidence suggesting Mister Roman was correct in his assertion.”
Gabriel chuckled. “I now see the point of this confessional.”
”Beggars can’t be choosers.  Count yourself lucky. When I was driving Sammy to California, the only working card Frank could get for us was under the name of Gracie Wentworth.  I made Sam wear drag. What? I sure as hell wasn’t going to do it. Besides, he had the hair to pull it off.”
It was time, then, to either move on to Wolfsbane or to choose a different destination entirely.
And since then, although he appeared aware enough of his surroundings to have answered all of their questions over what had occurred with Lilith, Dean didn’t truly seem to be with them at all. He was just staring at the Angel, his brow furrowed with thought, as though Castiel held the answer to some critically important question.
To most of the Faelchu, continued resistance seemed futile.

Of course, it was only payable if they both got out of Moondoor. This was why Dean had also agreed with the devil’s trap bullet idea despite personally feeling it would prove unnecessary. Well, that and the fact he’d enjoyed the idea of using Crowley as the sacrificial goat.

“Trust me, if we’d approached the front of the building you’d have been blown away.

Between the rock ogres and the War Party share of the Wendigo XP, Charlie’s experience bar had moved quarter of the way towards level 26.  Dean had already hit level 13 though, since the XP needed for his level up was quarter the amount required for a level up between 25 and 26.

about the ‘odd couple’.  An ease between them that Dean had only ever witnessed before in people married for decades.  Perhaps Sam was right that their relationship was, and would always remain, purely platonic. Dean wasn’t so sure. But they seemed happy, regardless, so he decided to butt out of that aspect of their business entirely.

And if he was wrong, if Castiel turned out to be an asshole after all… well, he could just chalk it down to yet another learning experience. It certainly wouldn’t be the biggest mistake he’d ever made.
