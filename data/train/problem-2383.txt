Sherlock said, "He was probably embarrassed."
Mycroft nodded and continued on towards the hall.
John knew that, with Sherlock, a conversation could take off in any of a million directions at the drop of a hat. He didn't even blink at the question, and still feeling quite merry, he related the story to his flat mate: "Not my proudest moment," he confessed.
“It’s fine, just please don’t ever do that again.” Sherlock stroked John’s back. “I mean, if you really have any genuine suspicions that you’re gay, we can talk about it.” He paused. “Not. Kissing. Not. Not negotiating sexual…I mean, just that, we can
He imagined Mycroft’s face when Sherlock finally told him that he was going to be a father. Mycroft’s horrified face.
Maybe they would both die tomorrow. Maybe they would die ten years from now. Maybe John would still die…a careless tumble down the steps or a traffic accident. Or maybe Sherlock would die. Or maybe they would have a falling out of some sorts, and their friendship would suddenly end.
Sherlock had a
“Look.”
“You still sound pretty angry.”
Mrs. Hudson dissolved into laughter and John started laughing again with her. "Oh, yes," Mrs. Hudson remarked, "That's Sherlock."
John's smile drooped a bit. "I'm sure he loves you. He spies on you enough."
Sherlock sneered. "That's science fiction. Time travel doesn't exist."
Lestrade put his hands in front of  his mouth to hide his smile. He turned away, giggling.
proud." She took the tiny wooden pole of the flag and put it in John's hand. "Here. You give it a try."
John paused, chewing on a piece of toast. He was sitting cross-legged on the sofa, laptop on his thighs and dressing gown tied loosely around his pajamas. His unwashed hair was messy, his cheeks finely mottled with stubble.  "Hm?"
.  Oh God. Oh
Lestrade implored, "You wanted to
John’s jaw tensed. “Um. It’s…there’s no blockage. There’s no problem with semen production but there’s zero sperm count. It’s a genetic abnormality.”
Molly dramatically lifted her hand, as if summoning the spirits, even though Sherlock couldn't see. "Let him come, Sherlock."
“I’m asking; would you take it?”
Mycroft  sneered. "Of course not."
John laughed, sitting down beside him. “You’re a genius! You’re brilliant! I’ll be related to my own baby! I won’t have to resort to a commercial surrogate! This…this is perfect! In every way.”
Inside the flat, John took both their coats and hung them up while Sherlock flopped on the couch. John took his place in the arm chair and rested his head back and was asleep within a few minutes, but Sherlock remained awake, looking up at the ceiling.
"That I was worried about you. That's all." He stroked Sherlock's back. "She's used to that. She'd like you to call sometime."
Toed on his shoes.
Sherlock quickly set down his coffee and straightened his jacket. He’d never met Harry Watson before, but there was one faded photograph in John’s wallet, several years old, taken long before Afghanistan, and it was the same woman.
John held the flag in his open palm. He closed his fingers over it and held it limply. He stared at it. "I can't," he said, handing it back.
"No, I believe you,"  Mycroft assured John.
Harry said, “So. I’m away on business a lot. I wasn’t always in London when John came home for leave. So, there was no one to greet him at the airport that time. No one to give him a place to stay. And that was typical. He’s never made a big deal about it. So, he took a cab to a hotel and once he was settled in, he gets this email from his army friend and it’s the video of the

If you could travel through time, where would you go? To pivotal moments in history! You would visit them like going to the cinema. And you know what gluttons we humans are for entertainment.

genetic material. He was going to use John’s. John Watson was going to have a baby, and Sherlock was determined to arm that baby with his own wit and intellect and all the advantages of a Holmes. Maybe he could convince John to let them hyphenate the baby’s last name.
Sherlock blinked. "How long ago…?"

gay?" John asked on the cab ride back.
"And he's never going to be a detective again, either," Lestrade said, "despite what he says. He talks about it, taking it up again, but then I'll show him a newspaper headline and say, 'Well, what do you think of this? Don't you think this is suspicious?' and he'll just get this look on his face and I put that newspaper right back down. He's never going back out there again. I know it. He's lost his…whatever.

John just stared at Sherlock. "But it wouldn't be like that."
The walk back to 221b was long and miserable. The street was swarming with people who didn’t know whether to flee the suffocating heat of their flats or take shelter inside in the shade.
"She was nineteen."
And Sherlock hoped that, as his younger self lay on the sofa, expecting to die and cycling through the inevitable panic, as he experienced the misery and the sense of helplessness
Sherlock blinked.  "What?"

“It’s been a while. A few months at least, right?”
"You're delirious! And paranoid!" Sherlock shot back, wrenching and thrashing. "I don't do any of that. And I don't care what you do. Do you understand? I don't care!"
"It's not funny," Sherlock said seriously.
"Me…what?" Molly asked.
"I am alarmed and upset."
Mycroft could go suck it.
“It’s not fair,” John said, raw and disgusted.
“Sherlock?” John called.
. But somehow it didn't go as I planned at all. At least my theory is sound."
Sherlock sat up abruptly and turned to John. “Yeah, he loved me. In a
John had something smart to say in reply, but he let it go and instead gave a brotherly pat on Sherlock's arm.
“Woah, woah. Slow down!”
Sherlock’s shoulders sank.

John didn’t answer.
John blinked. “Ok. Ok. I’m here. Tell me what to do?”

. But I forgive him. That doesn't make what he did right. It just means I forgive him. I wasn't ready to forgive him before, but now I am. As the wronged party, it's my prerogative to be as angry as I want for as long as I want. Except being angry and miserable and regretful is quite frankly exhausting. I want my life back. All of it. I'm ready to accept John back in my life." Sherlock looked at the screen. "Except he never answers his phone."
Sherlock felt his chest tighten. John was in pain. And Sherlock, as the provider, had a duty to fix it. But he had no idea how. Nonetheless, the obligation remained. And it wasn’t like any other obligation Sherlock had ever been given. No one had forced this responsibility on Sherlock. It was simply his.
Mycroft said, "He woke up  every day, walked into this room and was greeted by this message. He  brushed his teeth and showered and shaved and this word was always with  him." He cocked his head. "He fantasized about suicide.  This was the first step towards actualization."
The  door to 221b was open when John came home. Peering inside, the flat  looked almost normal. Except that the violin was smashed on the living  room floor, the broken strings curling, the wooden neck splintered. The  lights were all on and it was mid-day. So. It had been laying there  since the night before. Or, possibly, since two nights before. John had  done a double yesterday, spent the night at Sarah's, then done a more  forgiving six hour shift this morning. Really, it would be his  preference to freshen up at Sarah's. She wasn't home but he had his own  key now, but he'd run out of fresh clothes, so he came back. To find  this.
The endorphins released made them high. They were soaring.
It was his intention to walk on and find a quiet place.
"I had no idea you felt that way," Sherlock interrupted gravely. "You've never spoken of children before."
Molly frowned. "That's the most horrible thing I've ever heard. Why would you want to change who you are?"
John looked back at the door. Nothing. There was no one standing there. He should be able to see something, a shadow, a movement. The window was totally black.
She jerked up and reached for her purse on the floor to find the phone. This distressed Toby, who leapt off her lap with an indignant, raspy mew.
denied being gay over and over again. Well, I’m sorry to disappoint you.”
The nurse buzzed them in and Lestrade  opened the door. "What if he brings it up?"
He showed Mycroft the  laptop, the documents. He read them in silence. Pages and pages and  pages, chronicling the deterioration of a once-great mind. But they were  just wandering, listless thoughts. There were no plans, no clues and  nothing to go on. "Not enough. What else?"
Then he went into his bedroom and dug out a needle from a hallowed out book and made his way back to the sitting room. Once he settled down comfortably in his favorite chair, he prepared himself. He rolled up his sleeve, tied the cord, clenched his fist and found a vein effortlessly. He got higher than he'd ever been in his life. He shot up again. Again.
John obediently played along, but he looked just as depressed after six cases as he had before they’d started. It didn’t help that in four of the six homes they had visited, there had been children in the family. In some cases, very young children. When the adults started screaming, the children would begin wailing. Sherlock knew his plan had back fired. John had started looking at those wailing little babies like he was ready to kidnap them and take them away to better lives. Finally, Sherlock gave up.
I'm not going to talk to you about this." He went back to his computer, typing away. "Don't you have any pressing cases to busy yourself with?"
"Okay, John," Lestrade said encouragingly, leading John to a table and pulling out  a chair. "Just…have a seat. Over here."

"I suppose…"
John  said, resolve buckling, "Look, we had a falling out. I told you that.  We weren't speaking to each other. I wasn't hanging around. I just came a  few times for my things, that's all, and I'd go. I haven't spent a  night here in at least a month."

in my company. I have
Sherlock said, "I don't know what I what doing. What I was thinking. I didn't expect him to respond. I didn't even expect him to notice." His eyes flickered towards Molly. Searching and hungry and needy. "I just felt safe and it was nice to be affectionate and be able to be like that and John promised, he promised to understand, and I just thought….this will be nice. I can have this and John won't mind. But he did. It wasn't welcome. I made him uncomfortable, crossing that line." He sank into himself.
John swiped madly for it, furious. "Hey!" he barked. "Give that back now!"
It wasn't her jurisdiction. And he didn't have credentials anymore. But they still considered John a friend, even though they hadn't seen him in a long time, when they heard he was missing, they immediately made a plan. Sally Donovan and Greg Lestrade went up and down the street, stopping in every shop and pub, asking if anyone knew John Watson, a homeless vet who might be in the area. No one did.
John and Mrs. Hudson looked just in time to see Mycroft rounding a corner and, upon seeing the three of them, his step quickened as he walked.
John  waited anxiously.
“I am not!” Sherlock roared, fighting to sit up, to get purchase so he could swing his arms. “I don’t care what you do! Just don’t involve me! Don’t ask for my help when it all blows up in your face!”
So  he had habits. Bad habits. Habits that John had always tolerated,  habits Sherlock thought were normal, like being excessively demanding,  obnoxious, obtuse, impatient, rude, cruel and thick and  brilliant. Except it wasn't normal, it had never been normal to ask John to drop whatever he was doing to race across town to  be met with a simple task Sherlock wanted John to do because Sherlock  couldn't be bothered. And eventually, John was bound to blow up about  it. Anyone else would have seen that coming. It was inevitable. And it  only made sense that John would lose his cool under times of elevated  stress.
a drop-out.
, more than what John's limited senses could  reveal.
"Sparkle?"
John knew  immediately he had made a mistake. But the damage was done. He kept  completely silent and continued down the stairs, hoping the moment would  pass and be forgotten.
in ten seconds." He was smiling now. "You acted like I announced I was pregnant or something."
"You should compliment me more often," John suggested. "For practice."
After that, Sherlock helped John into the sitting room and settled him down in the upholstered arm chair.
This took me four months to write and I struggled with every word. I worked on this every weekend, every night after work, and was never, ever satisfied. Even now, I'm not entirely satisfied, but I must move on.
“Oh dear,” Sherlock croaked.
Sherlock thought there might be something to John’s accusation about mood swings.
Sherlock set his jaw. He hadn't printed the suicide note for a reason.
into my own daily life.”
John said, "Look, I don't know. I'm sorry. I don't know what I'm saying." He ran his hands through his hair. "I'm just really strung out. I'm so desperate to see Sherlock with my own eyes and see that he's really alive and I can't take another delay. I'm sorry, Molly. I didn't mean to jump on you like that."
John ever-so-weakly lifted his head off the sofa. “I thought you didn’t do domestic cases. Too boring.”
The rain was welcome. It came straight down, pounding the pavement, fog rising from the ground. Street lights glowed fuzzy halos in the fading dusk and deep, rumbling thunder muttered in the distance as the storm front lazily tumbled by.
. Please, don't. Don't."
John smirked. Oh, this was

He thought about reaching out to Harry and decided against it. What he really wanted to do was go back to Afghanistan. He was physically well. His limp was gone. He had no future. He wanted to serve a higher purpose again, be part of a cause.
John looked at Sherlock disgusted. "Um.
"What are you seeing?" Willis asked.
"Don't play dumb," Sherlock said sternly, his  hands twisting in a nervous fit in his robe, the material beginning to  tear only he didn't seem to notice. "Tell me the truth, no matter how  harsh, but don't treat me like an idiot..."
“I don’t know.

Stiffly, Sherlock turned back  around to face John, his voice intense and very,
Sherlock was silent.
"Yes," Sherlock said.
Sherlock sighed. "Fine. An educated guess." He rolled the bottle in his hands. Inside, the pill tumbled faintly about.
Mycroft walked away  from John and wandered into the living room and stood still, observing,  consuming, absorbing. Sherlock's broken violin remained untouched on the  floor.

Mycroft sat up straight in his chair and lifted one hand uneasily before him, seeking some intangible thing by which he could balance himself. "John."

John stared blankly at Sherlock, brows furrowed.
Harry Watson was standing just outside Angelo’s, right in front of the window, looking down at her phone, and then looking up again. Using a GPS on her phone for directions. An iPhone 5, newer than Sherlock’s.
Sherlock. Until the first wailing, sleepless night. Until he tried to put together a crib on his own. Until he had to warm a bottle, only half-awake. Until he needed someone else and found himself horribly, horribly alone. But then Sherlock would be there. For first steps and first words, Sherlock would be there. For first homework assignments and science projects and research papers, Sherlock would be there. For skinned knees and school yard bullies, for everything.
“Sherlock…”

Donovan climbed into the taxi. "Maybe I will come over for coffee sometime."
Against all reason and logic, with his mind screaming endlessly all the reasons why it was unhealthy to continue encouraging sentiment like this, Sherlock simply decided,

, that Sherlock could finally be  free to be himself at last. Except, nothing changed, he was free but was  exactly as he was before. Nothing changed at all.
John  said, "Sarah, I can explain everything."
Sherlock couldn't articulate. He just shook his head.
Without hesitation, Sherlock swung the door shut and threw the deadbolt. Then he casually shrugged off his black coat and scarf and hung them up neatly beside the other Sherlock's black coat and scarf, identical to his, but older, stiffer, faded. As he turned around, he asked politely, "May I sit?"
" Sherlock was growing angrier and angrier as he went on. "I'm celibate. I don't even
?" John asked. "You aren't interested in helping victims. You solve crimes to please yourself."  He managed to cross the sitting room without tripping over anything.
"How's…. the wife taking it?" John asked  gingerly.
John checked Sherlock's website every day. It didn't change. It only said that Sherlock was not available for detective work until further notice.
John stood stiffly at the top of the  stairs, watching Mycroft descend. "We didn't stop being friends because  he's gay!" he shouted.
“You’re breaking my concentration,” Sherlock complained.
, actually.”
what you were about to do."
In his final days, he'd gone every place he'd wanted to go...
, and put the garbage bags to the curb, human remains and all. He went to the wall that had been shot and spray painted with a smiley face and scrubbed the spray paint away, filled the holes with spackle. He went into Sherlock's bedroom and gathered his laundry into baskets and made his bed, opened up the curtains and the window and let fresh air in. He took most of Sherlock's clothes to the dry cleaner and paid for them. When he came home, he a post-it note on Sherlock's bedroom door explaining his where his clothes had gone. Then he went into the sitting room and worked his key off his keychain and left it on the coffee table. He walked out off 221b, closing the door and locking it behind him.
! And what about schools?" Sherlock walked slowly down the hall, rotating in circles, eyes shut. "We'll need to find a neighborhood with a very good school. And a playground. University. John." Sherlock's eyes popped open. "
John fished out his phone and dialed the hospital frantically. He talked to ten different people, transferred again and again.
John went into the kitchen and opened the refrigerator door and crouched, looking inside, and when he emerged he had a beer bottle in his hand. He unscrewed the cap, tossed it across the room. It '

"Some thoughts."
will help you move past it?” He gestured back to the oven. “I’m working on this experiment. If it pans out the way I think it will, we might have a tidy investigation on our hands, if a bit belated. It’s not grade-A, premeditated murder I’m afraid. Smacks of failed corporate oversight, but it’s something.”
He rushed forward to his friend. "John! John!" Sherlock was so excited he didn't know what to do or say. He was overjoyed.
if we have a baby."
"I can transfer you to a different hospital if you want more privacy."
John pursed his lips. "Hmm. That's not the kind of thing you get to decide. What’s that they say? You just hope for ten fingers and toes."
“Thank you for meeting me on such short notice,” Sherlock said, rising from his seat. “It was…insightful.”

of this was meant to happen.
my child," John said.
"Years ago," Sherlock said, returning John's smile. "Can't rely on him for anything. Prick."
The next day, late in the afternoon, John’s mobile rang somewhere in the flat.
Sherlock straightened his wrinkled shirt. He realized he was shaking. “Ella,” he blurted, looking around for his jacket. It had his phone inside the breast pocket. “I’ll…I’ll call your therapist. Get you into an emergency session. Obviously, you’ve been through a traumatizing ordeal. I didn’t realize…I had no idea how deeply your sterility had affected you.” He looked around anxiously. Where was his fucking jacket?! He’d dropped it somewhere.
“Because you two aren’t quibbling over petty nonsense, John broke up your
John dreaded such a confession. He thoroughly  worshiped Sherlock, but was completely unable to reciprocate any  romantic or sexual feelings. Looking at himself objectively, he knew he  was firmly heterosexual. John waited in dread for Sherlock to make a  move.
Sherlock sighed, opening up their front door. "John, is this something that can
Sherlock couldn’t wave down a taxi, so he walked slowly, his jacket hanging from his arm. His head hung. He sweated and his hair was damp, his curls hanging limply and unattractively.
Sherlock’s toes curled. He squeezed the union jack pillow against his face and stifled his own keen. “Oh yes,” he purred to himself, “Yes,
“Not really a client when we didn't even take the case,” John pointed out. “And look what happened.” He gestured at the box, guilt beginning to make its scrawl across his face. ‘I trusted you,’ his face said. ‘I trusted your judgement,’ his body echoed.
“I want to talk to the owner,” Sherlock said rather casually. John was at his elbow, looking around the shop.
But because of this single expression Sherlock was ready to crumple into bed and let John have his way about sleeping if nothing else. His head wasn't buzzing as loudly. If his brain was a beehive then most of the bees were asleep and he could hear the individuals dancing up information. Peaceful. Enlightening.
“Why the psilocybin!” Sherlock said louder than he meant. There was another crack of thunder right then and he felt it rattle through the house and up through his feet. The hair on his body was standing on end.
“Crying. As in sobbing. Weeping. Wailing,” John muttered.
This building seemed a little more temporary. It was filled with electric radiators for heating, a rudimentary set of cooking appliances as well as chairs, tables, stacked up crates (very familiar wooden ones) creating makeshift bookshelves. A few laptops, a server, and papers spilling onto the floor.

“Right, so. There's been no ransom demand of any sort, the dog is just gone. She disappeared two days ago when Mrs Bertram was having her afternoon nap. Both of the daughters and the younger son, Edmund, were home at the time.”
About halfway to Baker Street he realised that John wasn't in the cab. He took out his phone and texted him.
“Do you want to know what he said?”
“Oh… well, human lives are cheap,” Gibson said, uncomfortable and clearly in some pain from being hurled against the window. It was the wrong thing to say. “Using animals would get the attention of animal abuse agencies and that would be a horrible pain. Human advocates are far fewer in between.”
“Concentrate! The case happened after my leaving, so you assumed my leaving had something to do with the case. Thus post hoc.” Sherlock was starting to feel tired, and he ached, and his eye was now completely obstructed.
“He was trying to recruit you,” John huffed, changing the subject somewhat. “I don't like it when they think you're the same as them.”
“Suicide?”
Even though both Sherlock and John preferred to keep their separate rooms and separate beds a recent development in their relationship was intentionally sleeping in the same bed. It had changed Sherlock's routine somewhat where instead of getting up when he woke up, he tended to stay in bed a little longer, sometimes working, sometimes just sitting there watching John. Right now he was sat up against the headboard of the bed with his laptop, looking over the preliminary autopsy report Molly had sent him.
“Sherlock Holmes,” she said. “Finally we meet. May I call you Sherlock?”
“I'm not with the police, why did you contact me?” Sherlock asked although he had a fairly good idea of the why. He was clever enough to understand the science and detached enough to appreciate the science without making a scene about the process.
“Check the other rooms,” Sherlock said, balancing on the crutches. They were ridiculous.
“What part of me kissing you became unclear to you in the last three weeks?” Sherlock interrupted him. He kissed John again despite the protest noises from him. It took about two seconds to stop the protests that way. And to prove Sherlock's point because John kissed him back. He pulled away and smirked.
“Yes, AND he took the piece of wall-paper Mr Gosbeck gave me,” Sherlock huffed. “And the pieces I scraped from under the fingernails of the first corpse. He said he'd take me to the hospital to be checked over, but I refused. I knew you'd be here, after all, eager to fuss.”
Pyromania. In fact, he'd once been diagnosed with pyromania, when he was around fifteen. It'd been an experiment.
“Both will be returned to you as you leave the premises,” Mycroft stepped out and then gestured for Sherlock to do the same. “Sans everything you had in your pockets and the pictures you took.”
“John, my brother’s safety is of national importance now more than it has ever been but still, no one else needs to know even my own staff. Well, most of my staff.”
Mrs. Hudson looks over at sherlock in a bit of shock at the question knowing
John takes his hand off Sherlock just in utter shock. ‘How in all of the universe can this even happen.’
Sherlock walks in past the kettle on the stove starting to boil and a bit of steam starting to come out of it. The kettle did interest him a bit, but he walked over to the table to grab a seat and wait for the tea to finish. Sitting down at the table looking over at the vase he delicately picks up one of the small white flowers. Just looking upon it a feeling came to him looking around him now he is in a grassy flower field. A steady breeze flowed around his body while his hair flowed along with the wind. The beating sun just right within the air creating that spring warmth. He feels free of all the burdens of the morning and of his past life gone just pure bliss.
Myc- What kind of box.
“Again, I will have to keep this at the top of my daily tasks, my brother is just as important as this nation if not more. I started this and I will get him back even if it takes weeks or what I least expect months.”
After somehow surviving the seemingly long trip back to his bedroom, he slipped his feet out of his slippers and flopped onto his large navy green comforter, worming his way under the sheets and letting his eyes flutter shut, embracing the comforts of sleep once more.
“Great, now he thinks he is a kid.” John was not pleased with the whole event now he just wanted this to all end, but still, he was willing to put up with it for as long as he could. Really, he just wanted to get his Sherlock back, not one that just attached himself to whoever he sees.
“Thank you, goodnight… morning.” He hung up the phone and set the case down on the floor, making the floorboards creak like the crappy materials they were made out of. He grabbed onto the countertop to regain some balance before hobbling back to his room trying not to fall.
Mycroft cuts in. “Just cut to the chase. Is my brother alright?”
“If Sherlock got stuck up in a tree or because he thinks he is a squirrel you owe me a drink. Hell, that should make up for the fight we had.”
John stops tugging at Sherlock and looks right up at him. “You were just talking about it a minute ago Sherlock?”
He barged into his flat, the smell of acids and chemicals from the small lab he’d made in the kitchen wafting into his nose. “Let’s figure out what this is about before John gets back.”
John and Mycroft walk over to the happy little ball of sunshine. Mycroft sits down in the wooden chair he places between the two chairs within the large messy flat. John grabs a seat in his chair and speaks to his friend. “How are you feeling Sherlock?”
John’s phone starts to ring. He pulls one arm off Sherlock and grabs his phone. “Just let me take this then we can hug again ok buddy.”
“Alright mister.”
Walking over to the small wooden table in the centre of the kitchen, it was full of test tubes, conical flasks, vials, and bunsen burners. Some were covered in blood and deer fat - residue from one of his last experiments. Another held a bit of Prussian blue sealed off, waiting to be cleared off the table. A whole network of pipes connected one flask to the next, not unlike roller-coaster hoops, as they knotted, twisted, and went on and on as if it had no start or an end. Some broken shards of glass were scattered across the wooden floorboards at the other side, and the wood was bleached into a yellow tinge. Some mold was growing alongside several of the pieces, and Sherlock vaguely recalled John telling him to clean it (although it was for an experiment).
Myc- Is Sherlock in there at all.
Mycroft on the other hand was more focused on getting his brother down the tree. If he fell out, he had no idea what might happen, could he be stuck in this state forever where he could never get him back even with all the testing they might do. “Sherlock, I need you to get down, you are worrying me a bit now just hanging upside down like that.”
Smiling back at his detective friend, John patted his back. “Right. While you work on the chemicals, I’m probably going to drop by at Tesco’s for groceries.”
“How does this explain Sherlock forgetting who we are and then in a blink he is acting like one of us and now a dog for crying out loud Mycroft!”
A few hours passed, and John made it back to Sherlock’s flat with all the groceries. He noticed how the door was not locked. Sherlock always locks his door when doing experiments.
“Just keep your chin up for now John you are going to be the only one that could fix this but feel free to call me when needed you have my number.”
The blogger ran out into the living room of the flat, holding his gun in his clammy hand, ready to put a hole into whoever had intruded into his house. He skidded to a stop when a tall figure came into view, and let out a sigh of relief when he saw that it was just Sherlock. “Oh, God. Sherlock! Are you alright?”
Sherlock was still hanging off from the tree drinking his soda enjoying the sun upon his face. Felt so new to him and somewhat exciting to be experiencing. If you were to ask Sherlock what he thought about the sun in his old state, he would not have bothered to explain the feeling, nor did he really care about it. Looking down at the three was a sight to behold the fatter-looking one wanting him to come down looked worried but seemed like he really did not care that much. The blond one was cute he thought, sort of looked like one of the flowers he saw under the tree. He had no idea what it was called. Last was the older man with the small dog. He looked confident, the dog not so much it seemed sad to be with him but happy he guessed.
Sherlock snaps out of it looking around the room curiously. “You should clean this flat up brother it is what others would call a pigs sty.”
“Is he doing alright John? Any abnormal issues I may need to note down at all.”
Mycroft crossed his arms and looks up at Sherlock. “Let’s get my brother down before he hurts himself.”
Mycroft starts to look around the room trying to spot anything odd like any drips in the ceiling or if the wooden floorboards were different than before, but nothing stood out to him at all, unlike the lab. Walking along to the rest of the flat he noticed Sherlock’s mess of papers and the carpet moved must have been him running to the door just like a natural dog would do. Looking around the corner there was his brother's head hanging over the arm of his chair. His eyes looked a bit droopy as he was ready to take a long nap. Just it made Mycroft smile a bit just remembering the long summer days and just Sherlock sleeping most days away after just reading as much as he could about the world. He walks over grabbing one of the wooden chairs left around in the flat and he sets it in between both of John’s and Sherlock’s chairs.
Startling, the man accidentally let the beaker slip out of his hands, and the chemical sloshed out and splashed onto his face, getting into his eyes, completely blinding him. The beaker, now empty of its contents, fell onto the table and shattered on impact, the sound ringing throughout the apartment, scaring Sherlock a little.
Sherlock squirmed, an aching pain ringing through him as he slumbered uncomfortably. John rushed back with the dripping rag.
Sherlock smiles back. “We are all family, even you.”
“Oh, Mycroft good to hear you. How have you been.”
Mycroft takes a sip out of the cup looking over at John while he struggles to catch his breath. Resting his hands upon his knees he sticks one finger up then puts it down again. “Sherlock... he... he left baker street.”
Sherlock snickered, amused.
Mycroft lowers his head a bit and pinches his nose in displeasure at what has happened to his brother. “Just get him in a chair if you can I will try to talk to him if that is even possible right now.”
“So, what was that guy...girl holding me back from. What was their name again...”?
Mycroft sticks out his hand. “Mycroft Holmes. Brother of mine.”
“I just came back from shopping and now the food has gone bad at this point due to this whole mess.”
“Arf Arf!”
“Alright, I can do that thanks.”
“John. Yeah, I was going on a walk with one of my new trainer shepherds and I hear this rusting in the tree above me, and bam! This branch falls it almost hits me in the head.”
Sherlock starts to think, ‘This Mrs. Hudson lady she is very nice and caring I wonder if that’s why I ended up here in the first place.’
Buzz…
Sherlock pops around the corner to the two. “Sherlock’s right. Sorry to bother you with your dispute but I would like your help.”
“Seems like we have some development now. One in a more particular direction wouldn’t you say John.”
“We are done talking about this just call me if you find him and here take this.”
John let out a tired groan and lifted his head from his fluffy memory foam pillow. He turned his head to look at the alarm clock, and it read ten past five - earlier than when he usually woke up. He groggily flipped over his form onto his back, looking up at the cream sealings of his small bedroom trying to focus on the beams of light that shone on it from the small window.
Toward the large iron bar gated entrance of the park a group of boys not much older than ten years old. Each of them was tossing around a big rubber red playground ball among the fresh wet dew-covered grass. One of the boys slips over onto the grass as the ball starts to roll over to Sherlock. Sherlock still pondering on what John’s name was before the ball tapped the top of his brown loafers.
Sherlock grabs the phone and starts to listen. “Hello, who is this?”
John sniffles and looks up at Sherlock. “Me too buddy. Me too.”
The thought that this case containing this unknown solution was more intriguing than what he had imagined lingered in his mind. Rushing downstairs towards his flat with the case in tow, a sense of anticipation and excitement rising in him. Little did the man know that Mycroft had held back some information, information that would cost him dearly.
Lestrade rubbed the back of his neck and let out a small chuckle. “Mycroft wanted Sherlock to test some new chemicals for him... it seemed like they were having some issues down at the lab.”
“All you had to do is not given that briefcase to Greg and none of this would not happen. You could have tested this down at Baskerville they work with this stuff all of the time.”
John tries his best to cover up and make everything seem normal for the time being. “Sh... John, you said nothing wrong I’m... I’m just tired from the store.”
The idea of going out from this small room and seeing what was really out there brought a smile upon sherlock’s depressed look upon his face. “That would mean a ton. Thank you so much for the tea and the offer.”
“No need um... What is your name?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“So, Sherlock how you get yourself in this mess now.”
“Yeah, this whole event has been stressing me out so much it’s just hard for me to calm down. Just coming out to you as well about dating Sherlock even though you are him at the moment it is just hard for me not to hate the man.”
Myc- Still I am glad you are not hurt but please remind yourself if you can call or text me.
Greg nods back and turns over to john. “I will make sure I do not contact you john for the time being till sherlock is fixed. God this is going to be hard without a second hand around, he does most of the harder cases for me and most of my top cannot do it without him.”
Mycroft responds with his mouth almost dropping to the floor. “Oh, dear.”
The boy runs over to him, “Mister could we have our ball back we need to finish our game.”
He opened the door wide into the living room. It is way too quiet, he thought. He set the groceries over by the front door before shutting it.
John comes over to the two brothers holding two of his fresh sandwiches. “Is Sherlock still hungry at all Mycroft?”
Sherlock started to ponder on what mysteries could be revealed in light of this investigation. “Wouldn’t I like to know, John? Keep your chin up, we’ve still got a long day ahead of us.”
Uncovering his face, he looks at the man. “Sorry, sir.”
“There’s no need to yell, John, I’m fine. Why do you have a gun in your hand? Were you planning to shoot me?”
“Hey, I know a small shop with ice cream and walls of candy, that might take care of his craving. Just follow me but after we get there, I will have to leave to head back to the station. It looks like I got something small to take care of.” Greg pulls out his phone checking the text he had gotten from his boss. Seemed like he would have to drop them off and head back to Scotland yard sooner than he hoped.
“That sounds dumb. Why would I ever do that?”
He eventually managed to get the key out of the small hole, dropping it on the wooden floor with a small huff. A ‘clink’ sounded throughout the upper floor of the building, causing Sherlock to pause and brace for the moment John woke up. He looked around at the other doors within the vicinity of John’s flat, and let out a deep breath as he proceeded to pick up the key to open the door of the small flat.
“I’m glad you liked that old jacket, Sherlock. I was going to give it away but never got around to doing it but seems like it might be better off in your hands.”
“Take it easy Sherlock, just keep your head on that nice feather pillow Mrs. Hudson got for you.” John kept his hand planted on Sherlock’s chest to keep him down.
“When he does wake up later.” He walks over to the small table next to Sherlock’s chair and sets the small plate with his sandwich down on it. “It will be ready for him.”
Sherlock sits still trying to keep his excitement in for as long as he can before he hears something. A loud knock in that matter now has gotten Sherlock all stirred up. “BARK BARK BARK!!!” He pushes himself off John and makes a run for it to the door at full speed. He starts to glide around on the floor like it is thick ice trying to keep his balance on his hands and feet. Landing on the carpet he digs into it turning the corner and jumping right toward the door. He starts to scratch upon the door letting John know there is danger at their door. “Bark Bark!”
“I was going to ask the same from you.”
A long dark dimly lit hallway surrounds the small door but something or someone was at the end of it. Sherlock slides around the door and shuts it behind him. The figure hears the door shut and looks down his direction. Mrs. Hudson sees him and smiles knowing something is going on. “Sherlock is that you. I heard some bangs in your flat a bit ago were you and John having a domestic again.”
Mycroft crosses his arms and smiles letting out a huff thinking it was funny. John rolls his eyes to the response.
Sherlock looks around not knowing where the sound came from but spots the large rubber red playground ball at his feet. “What an interesting ball. Never seen one like this before, or have I?”
Mycroft is in awe about what just happened that he dropped his phone on the ground. John’s mouth drops his eyes are all wide like a deer in headlights on a nighttime drive.
Sherlock started to feel empty looking down at his hands he rests his heart on his hand feeling every small beat it makes. ‘My heart it’s sad. Why do I feel this way? Do I need to feel loved like the puppies on the t.v? Is that what is missing is that who I am?’
John pinches the bridge nose till it turns red. “How the hell do I even get him to do anything normal with him changing just like this!”

Myc- This still me at the moment?
Sherlock on the other hand now was a bit less shy now just excited to get some candy. He hoped the place was just covered head to toe in all sorts of candy. He had one he was looking forward to, could just be due to having the memory of one of the kids that lost their ball.
Sherlock frantically started to pick up the sealed test tubes that fell out of the case, thinking of booking it out of the flat as soon as he could, as he knew that John may at any moment come out and mistake him for a robber of sorts. One by one he shoved the glass vials back into the black leather case. Panicking slightly but trying to maintain his composure, he accidentally slammed the case shut, the sound echoing around the apartment. Cursing, he tried to make a run for it, but of course, luck just wasn’t on his side. He ‘deadass’ tripped over the rug that had also tripped John earlier in the morning, which caused him to fall face-first into the case which he had dropped.
“This might be more than I was dealing with down at the laboratory. John, would you come over here for a minute? We need to have a talk.”
“Seemed like you liked it a bit too much.”
John gets down on his knees next to Sherlock and starts to pet his head. “Sherlock don’t be sad it’s alright I just don’t want you to lick my face that’s all. How about we get you something to eat.”
Both John and Mycroft lift him off the ground and back into his chair. John keeps his hand on Sherlock just if he collapsed again.
Sherlock left his flat and started up the stairs to John’s flat. He tried to keep it as quiet as he could so as to keep John from waking up from his much-needed sleep. He finally arrived at the top of the stairs, ready to retrieve the package his brother left for him to deal with.
“John for now we just play along. Let him listen to music, something that your normal people do.”
John walks over to see what the fuss is about with this case again. “Anything weird about it?”
John comes running back into the flat pushing the door wide open till it slammed against the wall, shaking the bookshelves. “Mycroft!”
Sherlock pulls the cup close to his lips ready to drink. “Alright miss.”
Sherlock wasn’t sure what he needed to say, but he felt as if he was a newborn baby just now learning about the world around him and figuring out who he was. He was left confused, did he need to copy this person in front of him? Seems like I should. His gut told him, yes but something in his head said no.

The loft upstairs where John’s flat resided had a nice exterior. Some small plants and a pair of shoes sat close near his door but did not clutter the decent-looking modern exterior. The wallpaper around the door was worn down and slightly old-looking, otherwise the entrance looked quite nice. Next to the door of John’s flat was a small hole. The state of that particular wall’s wallpaper had deteriorated enough to reveal the small hole, just big enough to hide the spare key. He looked down at his hands knowing only one finger was able to fit in the hole to fish it out, and thus he walked over to the hole and shoved his middle finger in it, fishing around for the key.
Sherlock listened into the last bits of all three men before just falling asleep in John's loving arms. There he was once again in the darkroom with the box. Something was odd about the box, but he could not figure out what.
At that, John attempted to recall whatever Lestrade had told him, but his mind kept drawing a blank. He shrugged. “Nope. I have no idea what he told me. All I know is that Mycroft and his scientists couldn’t figure anything out, so he sent this to you to find out more about it.”
“Not really. I was going to ask you know what my purpose is. I’ve been sort of lost on what it is really.”
“I still think you two should date. You are well...more than partners in crime.”
Sherlock walks over to the bags by the door. “I am surprised at what you bought for my dear brother. He has a natural chef on his hands!”
“Brother? Must have hung up on me just like he always does.”
A little boy calls out to Sherlock from inside the park, “Hey mister! Could we have our ball back?”
Mycroft gets up from the wooden chair and walks over to the kitchen. There sits the case, but something is wrong. He pulls out a set of rubber gloves in his coat pocket and slips them on. The case seemed brand new like it was resting back to a point where no damage was done to it. “John did you have this case open earlier at all and did it have any damage on it of any sort.”
John opens the door to the one and only Mycroft. “Good to see you Mycroft just been dealing with Sherlock.” He points down at the exhausted Sherlock.
Sherlock keeps struggling out of John’s grasp till he breaks free at the top of the stairs making a run for the outside.
Sh- I wish I could do that but all I can remember is a box.
“I’m sorry about that Sherlock I heard a squeak from something, and it woke me up but at least you are safe.” He rubs Sherlock's hair, making Sherlock smile a bit knowing he is alright.
Sherlock ignores John’s plea and finds the door out toward Baker Street. Grabbing the golden knob as fast as he could he opens the door. Blinded by the beams of the hot sun he covers his face still trying to make a run from his best friend. Knocking into the small crowd that roamed the street he was now hidden in plain sight.
John looks over at Mycroft and smirks. “Well, Mycroft I think you owe me a drink.”
“Mycroft help me prop him back up in his chair!”
At that, John nodded back, grinning widely before heading back to his bedroom to put his gun away. Shouting from his bedroom, John reminded his friend, “Hey, call me if anything happens?”
Mrs. Hudson walks over with the kettle and two sets of little teacups. “I hope these little cups will not bother you that much, I know you hate it when I get them out.”
John puts his phone back in his pocket. Seeing Sherlock just down to a point of a new beginning one that just shot his heart in two. He walks over to Sherlock and hugs him tight shedding tears knowing nothing will be the same after today.
“Just follow me alright.” Sherlocks nods following Mrs. Hudson into her flat.
Sherlock shuts the flat door before John comes and grabs him. Sherlock starts to squirm around while John drags him back upstairs to his flat. “Let go of me!”
“It was just a sandwich. I did not do anything to make it magical Mycroft.”
“Much more than what we have tested in the lab. All of the test tubes are filled as well, and I know Sherlock opened up one to test but no spill or any leftover residue anywhere. Everything with these liquids it keeps resetting back to an earlier point but why?”
She brings back a light blue jacket. The inside of the jacket was covered in sheep’s wool making it look a bit puffy but just enough to keep him warm if he was out for too long. The shoes she brings over looked like an old brown pair of loafers with small black laces that were tied once before him. Reaching out and grabbing them slowly from her hands, he plops the shoes on the ground and slips the jacket on. It felt so soft upon his arms making just smile in glee. He hugs himself making Mrs. Hudson smile along with him knowing he loves it a ton.
Searching around the room he spots it. A small t.v one of the round dome face ones that sometimes crackled and popped when you turned it on. It was on the floor on the other side of the flat past the sleeping John. Sherlock being as quiet as he can be sneaks ever so quietly past John not making a single peep getting to the only thing that would bring him any joy or comfort at the moment forgetting he had a brother. He makes it over and searches for what the remote could be to turn it on. Searching nearby he finds what may be the remote he needs pressing the power button it turns on making a large pop waking John up.
“I think you are ready to head out Sherlock. You look ready as you will ever be.”
“Hey, I’m not going to bother to deal with this too much, but john call me if you need me or just text me. Alright, there boy no need to get worked up I know you want to head back to your trainer.” The shepherd wanted to go back to the yard. It was just as tired as Sherlock; he just kept whining till Greg took him back.
“Aww, Sherlock you are going to make me tear up.”
Sherlock Holmes set the chemical down on the table to check his phone. A text had come in from Molly. “Of course, it’s Molly...” He started to type out his message not noticing the chemical bubbling more and more as it sat in the flask.
The german shepherd gets startled backing a bit away from his trainer but keeping its ground if something were to happen to him. Greg looks back toward the small pup. “I’m sorry for yelling there.” He pets the shepherd’s head making sure it was alright.
He turned his head away. It was heavy.
“I'll be able to spot her,” he continued, giving John a disgusted look. “She'll be practically flaunting it. In fact, why would you even mention needing a picture.” He swept into the shop, pride carrying him over the pain in his foot that had reached his hip, joining with the discontent of his ribs. He navigated immediately to a service counter, with John somewhere in his wake.
Sherlock didn't argue. It was pointless to try and explain anything that had happened because he couldn't even explain it to himself yet. And his history with recreational narcotics made the someone-gave-them-to-me -story rather suspect. But it was interesting (and fearsome) to find out he had awoken previously. Had it been those times when he'd visited Alice Waite's consciousness?
He suffered from boredom and pain, from dullness and aches, from thirst and hunger and from the tediousness of not being physically at his best. He valued the physical side of things as well. Mycroft didn't, which is why he was fat and sedentary and utterly useless. John did, to a degree, though sometimes he preferred being lazy and also sedentary. Sherlock felt hard-pressed to sit down for eating at times, everything everything everything moved about a hundred times faster in his brain and in his body, and he could only tame those electrical impulses in his muscles with physical action. Right now he felt trapped in his body.
“What-” John started again, this time with annoyed disbelief. “Sherlock, that's impossible. It must've been the drugs-”
The manuscript was a treatise on nature and natural sciences, which was as much as Sherlock had already deduced from the illustrations in it. Many of the drawings depicted plants that didn't exist, but there were also portrayals of astrological and even astronomical in nature. Whether they existed or not was not something Sherlock had knowledge of. Representations of nude women were also in abundance but Sherlock hadn't yet understood their significance—he inferred it could have something to do with medical science. However, the drawings were of secondary interest to him as the text itself was his primary focus.
That presented Sherlock with several choices, most of which were immediately discarded (leaving, giving up, being quiet, letting John sleep). John had a DUTY, and it was to amuse Sherlock.
Sherlock eyed her and the hairbrush. He thought back to the other items that had been moved. “There is no ghost,” he intoned. “There is no burglar visiting you every night to rearrange your possessions. It's you.”
Sherlock grinned and stood up, carefully folding the parchment into a pocket in the lining of his coat. He'd be happy to give John all the rest he wanted in exchange for this. “Fine,” he said. “We'll pick this up when you come back.”
“So why-”
“Not a good thing to say right now.” John slumped back on the bed, one had rubbing at his forehead as he gave Sherlock a troubled look from under his brows.
There was a piece of wall-paper loose now and Sherlock put away the knife, taking out his magnifier instead, peering at the wrong side. “It's been re-used,” he said, mostly for John's benefit. “This wall-paper was stripped from the house Mr Gosbeck was hired to renovate and was re-used in these rooms.”
“What's the fun in telling?” Sherlock shrugged and examined his nails. John slept with a small red night-light plugged into a socket. It gave just enough light for things to be discernible, but naturally it didn't rob one of their night vision (and it didn't disrupt melatonin production).
“He died happy.”
“Oh, obviously.” John followed. “Can we stop for breakfast? I mean, we're going to have to wait for Lestrade, aren't we? People still live in that place, we can't just kick down the doors and demand to... I don't even know what we're going to demand.”
Sherlock made a face, but said nothing. Stating the obvious was as painful as his injuries. He felt John check his foot for abrasions and then begin bandaging his it again. Sherlock detached his mind from the constraints of the present and considered the killer's flat again. It was purely for show. She needed a safe place. Somewhere near. It had to be in the building, the house was meaningful to her.
It was the last thing Sherlock heard.
“You really have no idea, do you?” John said after a moment, inhaling and exhaling deeply. He lay on his back with an arm behind his head, looking up at the ceiling. Sherlock was only halfway on the bed, with his legs over the edge, sharing John's pillow.
“I'm an encumbrance now. Great, thanks. I feel better. At least I'm stopping you from killing people, I guess.”
From the opinionated silence coming from John's direction Sherlock could tell that he disagreed with this plan, but he couldn't expect Sherlock to ignore something like this, an actual mystery with severed hands and dead men with strange conditions and tattoos.
“Then you're just my detective,” John replied instantly.
“There's a certain degree of difference that's pretty important to some people,” John sighed, but cleverly didn't try to explain it. He must've noticed how Sherlock was already zoning out of the conversation.
There was a pause. Sherlock didn't move much yet, not wanting to cause another avalanche. “Literally, or..?” he finally asked.
“You still want this?” he asked, then snorted when Sherlock presented his arm, sleeve already rolled up, and a dreadful grin. “You mad bastard.”
“We could swing by Tesco when this is done,” John was saying. “There's nothing to eat at home.”
“Yes, but it won't happen again,” Sherlock replied which was a blatant lie and only meant to soothe John. He had no idea what would happen if he came face to face with Alice Waite again. “I know her tricks now.” Another lie.
“The case,” Sherlock replied primly and hobbled out. “Bandage my foot so I can walk on it.” He didn't mention it hurt a lot more now than it had earlier, but he suspected that John knew that, which led him to congratulate himself on establishing a line of unspoken communication with another person. Maybe in the future he could stop talking completely. It was a slow and cumbersome way of communicating any way.
“Your subjective interpretation of murder statistics, which I doubt you've actually even checked, is irrelevant and only meant to shake me up. Which it hasn't,” Sherlock remarked. Now he was glad John was gone. He didn't mind being called a freak by someone he didn't care about, but he would've hated to see John
He surfaced from the Lovecraftian depths of his sleep when the floor creaked under John's step (yes, Sherlock could recognise it in his sleep, his auditory sense was perfectly attuned). His brain engaged his consciousness and made him open his eyes to the blurry sight of John standing over him.
“That's what the starting phase of a romance is called, isn't it?”
“Brilliant,” Sherlock said, taking out his pocket magnifier. He heard John walk over and stand close to him, just brushing his coat. He looked up to see John giving him just the hint of a smile. “Are you happy because he's dead?” he asked loudly to which John gave a sigh in reply and stepped away.
The house was a mystery and Sherlock loved it. He would be back as soon as possible, with tools and proper gear, he'd crack this place open and extract the heart of the matter (and then gloat over it, that went almost without saying). For now he needed to get John out of there and make sure there were no lasting ill effects.
It was true, at least. It wasn't the worst drug-induced trip of Sherlock's life and psilocybin was relatively low-impact and low-toxicity.
Sherlock was in agony. And his tongue hurt, too. And his ankle and his arm and his ribs. Boredom was the enemy. It made him realise his brain was trapped in a skull that was attached to a body that was only human. He glanced at the skull on the mantel, envying him.
“You didn't think I took them myself?” Sherlock asked. He was a little surprised which overrode his anxiety about what had happened to him.
“This is ridiculous. You'll never solve the case without me, not with the logic-impaired people you have on it!”
Sherlock had kept up with updates on the autopsy until he'd fallen asleep. Molly was rather good at what she did (but no one tell her) and she had been able to text Sherlock or send him pictures of what she'd found or not found during the night. The man hadn't eaten a toddler any time in the last 24 hours. Pity.
Sherlock leaned over him and kissed him on the mouth. He would continue to do that until John gave up. At least it clearly took his mind off the dark house as he opened his eyes and stared up at Sherlock. Then he lifted his hand and placed it on Sherlock's cheek and they kissed some more.
“Sherlock...” John sighed.
“Thanks,” he grinned. “Did that hurt?”
“You watched the recording?” John asked instead of getting into another conversation about objectivity.
“Brilliant,” John replied, grinning, starting to type.
So far none of this sounded in any way strange or new. “The point, John? Do you have one?”
There was a shape against the white ceiling, moving in and out of Sherlock's field of vision. He could only see a blur.
“It's OBVIOUS,” Sherlock cut him off with no small amount of derision. “Showing off would be leaving the corpse somewhere immediately visible and not chopped up into pieces. This is hardly the spot. It's been here hours, but not over twelve. The victim has been dead for less than twenty-four. It's an inept body drop by an inept killer.” He'd seen enough of the cuts on the separated body parts to spot the hesitation marks. Very little blood, however. Drained before being packed up and transported.
“To be honest, it's an honour to meet you,” she told him once she was seated. She had the eyes of a fish, unblinking. “You're quite the celebrity.”
“How's the- that?” John nodded towards the book, curious but apprehensive.
“The woman he mentioned.”
“I didn't really find out anything else,” she was saying. Sounded tired. “Most of the internal organs were quite normal, except for the alimentary tract, which you saw. I didn't find any... human bits in his stomach. Cause of death was asphyxiation, likely the, uh- the hand.”
“How do you know?” Sherlock replied. He was only talking to keep John aware and awake (plus he enjoyed arguments). He stepped down off a pile of something and into something even more unpleasant. It was spongy with hard bits under his shoe and it squelched (or was it his shoe that did that).
Sherlock smirked a little at the sound of John's growl. They really could frustrate each other to no end with opposing points of view but having an easy relationship wasn't something Sherlock was particularly interested in. He'd never had an easy relationship in his life so admittedly he wasn't that familiar with how one felt. But he imagined it'd be boring. Anything without a challenge was boring.
“Touching, but no.” Sherlock glanced at him. “And to answer your question, I believe the smell originates from the incredible clutter inside the house.”
Lack of John meant he couldn't dive into his mind like he wanted to. He needed to be able to navigate his way back into the city by himself and he was briefly annoyed at John for abandoning him there. Then he recalled the many occasions he'd done the same to John and struggled with that for a moment. But it was a responsibility he felt he was exempt from. In order for him to work he had to be allowed to work the way he wanted to.
“Maybe it isn't anything,” John said. He remained steadfastly unimpressed by the whole book and the house they'd found it in. Sometimes aggressively unimpressed to the point of refusing to talk about it.
“You swear. Just not out loud every time. I can see it in your face.” Sherlock didn't bother repeating his stance on how John was only honest as far as it correlated with an inability to lie convincingly.
“What?”
John grimaced a little. “See, you almost had it and then you said something not good again,” he told him, but he was a little more relaxed. Perhaps the simple illocutionary act of promising he was committed to John had been enough. Communication was marvellous sometimes.
“It's cold,” Sherlock replied, barely a whisper.
“Yes,” John was quick to assert that yes, it was indeed what they wanted. He wrote the address down in his little notebook (Sherlock knew this even without looking).
“Welcome back.” John was there, sitting opposite to him at a diner table, a piece off egg dangling off his fork. “I decided to have something to eat while you were off in your mind thingy.” He made a gesture at Sherlock's head.
It amused Sherlock greatly to hear that. He disappointed hopes and expectations on both sides of the law and across the whole spectrum of morality. “Your… group,” he said instead. “Tell me about them and I may consider speaking on your behalf.”
“Sorry?” Molly said then. Sherlock didn't stop pushing the chair around but looked at Molly when she crossed his field of vision. “You said something.”
Their talkin about sellin me !!1 I dont think its a joke! D: D:
“Because, by all accounts and purposes, he was a serial killer. You don't like those.”
The site was closed off with a chain link fence and notices saying the place was guarded, which made John hesitate as they circled round to find a gate. Sherlock was only sorry he was unable to ring the private security contractor to make a convincing lie why they'd need to get into the building. The gate turned out to be too impressively locked so Sherlock moved onto the next plan and pulled out a pair of wire-cutters from his pocket. It never hurt to be prepared, and these sites tended to be surrounded by fences of some sort. He'd just gotten lucky on chain link versus wood.
“It's a murder. It's a box. It's Christmas. It's a joke!” he insisted.
“You're the one who brought up the mesolimbic pathway.” John pushed Sherlock's foot away and stood up. “The amount of nicotine patches you use has gone up and you keep wanting more.” He pocketed the packet of patches.
“Usually because people think that happiness doesn't just happen, there has to be a reason. Your happiness only happens near corpses and crime scenes, so it's doubly suspect.”
“What-” John started but Sherlock lurched towards the exit. He stumbled over Herbert's body and fell on his hands and knees but crawled forward. He needed to get away from her. For a brief moment he saw the room again from her point of view, looking up at the bright outline of the door. When he came back to himself he had collapsed on the floor. Then he felt John's hands on him, trying to help him up to his feet.
“Clear,” John said again. “Sherlock... What is this?”
There was a knocking on the door, then an argument that Sherlock couldn't quite catch (but he heard John's angry voice), and then the door crashed open, and John was there, on his knees, pulling Sherlock into his lap. He was better in a disaster than anyone else Sherlock knew. It was like different pathways in his neural system opened up and neurons began firing down those at double the speed, removing the usual faffing about block he had on all his actions.
“What?” John looked up from his phone.
“Two,” he said.
The stars were incandescent.
“Sherlock,” John said, looming suddenly in Sherlock's field of vision. “Stop smoking while on your back. You might set your hair on fire. Or blind yourself.” On top of being patronising John plucked the last of Sherlock's cigarette out of his fingers and put it out in the ashtray on the polished coffee table.
When they separated John gave him an altogether new sort of look. An expression unlike Sherlock had ever seen. He had caused it and it was the best thing in the world until John spoke.
“And the proof?” Lestrade sat slumped.
“I'm late for another dis-appointment,” John said, glancing at his watch. He didn't look at Sherlock as he turned to leave and Sherlock (briefly proud of John's pun) let him leave. This wasn't the place or the time to air out any personal grievances and he was glad John understood that. And John would come round, he always did.
“Because you're completely useless at lying!” Sherlock cut in, feeling slightly vindicated.
Sherlock said nothing. He'd already put those out of his mind; they were done, dead, useless. He didn't need to dodge anyone, or step aside for them, they stepped aside for HIM (which was gratifying) as they made it back into flat number 2. John was being genial behind him, greeting people, shrugging when they asked what Sherlock was up to.
“And you found Viktor's house and led the government dogs there so it had to be purged. I knew you had one of the manuscripts, but that was not a problem. It's the one that I leaked on purpose to Wilfrid Voynich back in the late 19
Sherlock sighed. “What?”
“What- what're you doing?” John asked, still standing under the light. He was disconcerted, disturbed, and starting to believe Sherlock's assessment of the victims dying of madness.
Click-click.
“How could you possibly kn-”
The old lady gave Sherlock a look. “Not at all,” she said and gestured for them to follow her in. “Make yourselves at home. Don't pay any mind to old Captain Williams there.”
“If you expect me to do something dreadful to you, you'll be disappointed. You're not my type, I'm afraid.”
“He was calm, then he wasn't. And then he was dead,” Lestrade supplied, somewhat more composed. “You want to watch the security tape?”
“Okay.” John straightened his legs in front of him and looked at his toes, then at Sherlock. “Tea?” he asked kindly. Sherlock looked back, but said nothing, which set John into motion, shuffling into the kitchen and back a minute later with a cup that had a cloud of steam above it.
They had stopped now. John had his collar turned up and his hands in his pockets. The tip of his nose was red and his hair was uncombed. His face was tired, but his eyes were bright. A fact Sherlock attributed to the street light, because people's eyes didn't brighten or dim on their own, no matter what centuries' worth of romantic novels said. People just saw reflections of their own emotions in other people's eyes, which was why it was best to stay emotionless. (There'd been no horror in the eyes of the Tuol Sleng prisoners who'd been photographed before torture and death under the Khmer Rouge regime.)
“Who hasn't?” Sherlock thought of a sandwich and some biscuits, very hard, looking toward the kitchen, then at John, then again at the kitchen. It had worked before.
“Sometimes, sure,” John replied, making Sherlock's stomach lurch uncomfortably. Something in his face must've given up that sensation because John turned a little more and leaned over to kiss him softly. “Sorry,” he muttered then, as if on cue, but he remained close and spoke again: “I think you kissed me on a whim and that whim's going to end sooner or later.”
He struggled on the floor. Struggled to get up, struggled to get to John. His eyes watered, making his view undulate with waves of light and colour. Then, with another crash of sound, his eyes cleared and he was staring at John from higher up, from his standard height. The shock of what had just happened made his knees buckle and he gasped in surprise.
“Well…” Lestrade shifted on his feet. “We don't know. Tried calming him down and talking to him about it, but he started to choke.”
She grabbed an arm angrily and arranged the body parts on the table in an imitation of the human body. They both leaned over the remains in the freezing silence and hum of the morgue. Sherlock was able to confirm the presence of hesitation marks and the amount of effort it had taken to take the body apart. The trauma indicated a small axe and someone with not much strength.
He had
"Maybe I did," John said, looking between his knees at the floor.
The door  swung open.
The question stung unexpectedly and Sherlock recoiled. The question
Molly gulped and rushed to follow. People were still looking at her. She tried not to make eye contact with any of the irritated customers and kept herself a close to Sherlock's back as possible without walking into him. To preoccupy herself, she scrolled through her phone to see what Sherlock had done to it. She found a new ring tone had been downloaded. She clicked on the file name just as Sherlock settled into an available booth in the corner.
Sherlock held his breath. He needed some sign from John or  else he would break down. He couldn't believe he had gotten out as much  as he had.
Cases  came and went. For the most part, Sherlock investigated alone while  John tried to invest more time into the clinic and Sarah.

That was against the rules.

John stared back at Sherlock. He suspected "preference" didn't really mean "preference," it meant something else, but Sherlock was being deliberately careful to test John's temperature. John put his own elbows on the table, mirroring Sherlock, made a fist in one hand and covered that fist with the other, and pressed both tight hands against his lips. Calmly, he stated, "Okay. My preference is surrogacy."
gay. But no one thinks you're gay when you're alone. So, you aren't emitting some pheromone, alerting the general public that you're a homosexual. You aren't the last to know. You haven't the slightest inclination to have sex with men, and the fact that you're trying to convince me otherwise is stupid and insulting and boring. Believe me, if you were gay, I would know. I can see things, John, because seeing details and extrapolating information from what I see is what I do for a living. I'm a legend at it. So rest easy and
"It's a repulsive word,"  Sherlock said bitterly. "No one deserves to be called that."
Something flickered in Sherlock's expression; his brows drew closer, his mouth twitched.
"Don't want to discuss it," John said firmly.
The sun rose higher outside.
“Candle for the table?”
Sherlock turned away. "Yeah." He sounded disappointed again.
Sherlock sat down across from John in his leather armchair and pressed his fingers together.
Donovan said, "Well, if he ever gets bitten by the bug, don't bring him around any of
He pushed her aside. "Our turn." He stepped up to the counter and ordered two coffees and paid for them. He did it quickly, leaving no opportunity for objection or for opportunity for Molly to attempt to pay for herself. "Come along, Molly," he said, his nose in the air, drifting away from the counter to find an available booth.
"Yes, really. And, before mum and dad died, she used to make up stories about how they tried to make her be straight, tried to make her date boys, and that never happened. So, don't take anything she says to heart."

But John was disoriented and not paying any attention. He wandered off in one direction, then lost interest and started drifting in another. Then he turned around and looked at Sherlock angrily before spinning off in another direction and stumbling away.

John decided that "Thank you  for picking me up," sounded better than, "Thank you for posting my  bail," when you were trying to test your girlfriend's temperature. He  gingerly rubbed his wrists, all dappled black and blue and yellow from  the handcuffs. His fingers were stiff and his hands swollen.
coming out and maybe his blog was the way to do it…but he so vehemently rejected the idea…I didn't think he would do it!"
Molly said nothing. It wasn't necessary to say anything. She knew Sherlock could hear himself, hear how irrational he sounded. Maybe he just needed to get it out.
But John didn’t sound happy. “And about how much it’s
you for your cooperation or approval?"
Sherlock looked momentarily panicked, but he immediately squared himself and waited for John to close the distance between them, which happened in less than three seconds. The detective narrowly dodged John’s first swing. He wasn’t expecting the second.
Sherlock exhaled loudly at that, dissatisfied. "There will be questions. Regardless. And later…obviously, forensics…"
"I could always go back to the clinic."
Sherlock said seriously, “I’m so glad you’re alright. You have no idea. This may be the worst night of my life."
Sherlock was furious. "You're an idiot."

He breathed in her spirit in like a passing  fragrance, and it made a little warm spot in his belly. And when she had  walked away, he felt all trace of those feelings drift away with her  and the warm spot became cold. God. That's how John had made him feel  once.
"Hypothetically, I could watch him get shot over and over again and he would always be suffering," Sherlock countered. "And it would only be my

Mrs. Hudson placed her hand gingerly on Sherlock’s arm, her mouth trembling. “Sherlock, have you been keeping something from me?”
"And now
John said, “Good night then.”

Sherlock was in the kitchen at that moment. He was wearing an apron, rubber gloves up to the elbow and a pair of welding goggles.
"What's five  minutes early?" asked John. He was hopped up on too much coffee. His  eyes were rimmed red. He hadn't slept.
He was sitting comfortably on the sofa. He was old and gray where the other Sherlock was black, youthful, but his eyes were as sharp and crystal blue as ever. His gun was pointed directly at his younger self, his frail arm balancing on his knee for both comfort and accuracy.
"God," Sherlock snarled, plucking the phone from her hand, jolting her from her stupor. "This is intolerable. Unforgivable." His fingers danced across the keys, silencing the ringer.
Try and try Willis might, but he was never able to go back in time himself. Sherlock, however, was becoming an expert at it.
The water had poured down his neck, down his chest, into his purple shirt (the nice one,

"No, no, that's fine," Molly said quietly. "I don't think the interview was going anywhere."

Lestrade didn't answer. He took a sip of his coffee.

John wasn't sure what to say. He felt  himself smiling.
"John, you can rely on me."
"You want to do something for me?" Molly said, "I want you to see a therapist."
. But tell them in the morning."
After an hour, he turned the phone back on. He scrolled  to John's name and sent a message without reading anything John sent  him:

Sherlock thought suddenly.
"What?" Molly asked.
Mycroft said, "He's no good at it, though. That  wasn't his upbringing, or mine. I suppose he thinks all he has to do is  prove he's got an indispensible talent, and the masses of the world will  have to embrace him eventually and accept him as one of their own…even  if only out of necessity." Mycroft started walking towards the door.
Molly put up her hands nervously. "Not at all."
John clutched her tight. “Don't. Tell me. What you see. Take her…and I’m going down there...to close the door.”

John thought a moment more and said, "No, I’m right. If I have a baby with a surrogate's help rather than yours, it's a threat to your…" He shrugged, at loss for a moment. "This is going to be the wrong word but…it's a threat to your

Like now. Like this morning.
Mycroft didn't move right away. He stood, staring at nothing, disoriented.
“Wrong? I am at the top of my game in the prime of my life, about to have the best cup of coffee in the best city in the world,” Sherlock declared. “The only thing that can make my day better is a murder. Two sugars in the first coffee, and the other is black. Thank you.”
Just as Mycroft began to turn away, Molly said timidly, "I'm sorry. I've only seen you once before…"
John turned around and marched down the hall. "I'm going to take a shower and then we'll see about that murder. Whatever you want. Just. Just…let it
Separating the BSU from the  lobby was a solid steel door with a card reader that would remained  locked until visiting hours started.

John was completely shocked. His face was pink. “That’s the nicest thing you’ve ever said to me. And you managed it without working in a single insult.” He paused. “You don’t really mean it, do you?”
Yeah, Harry probably wouldn’t like that. And wouldn’t blame her. Sherlock suspected she’d probably had enough of being disposable. Knowing her history, he couldn’t in good conscious ask her to submit to it voluntarily.
But then John hiccupped. Sherlock knew immediately what that meant. Before he could self-censor, he started thinking out loud, “No,
"John."
Mycroft asked, "And by 'have a baby,' you mean adoption, yes? There isn’t any fantastic science fiction involved in this? Nothing where I need to intervene on behalf of the Hague or the UN?"
He put the furniture back, gathered up the papers, swept the floor. Then he tutted at the broken window and just lowered the blinds to hide it.
for people who genuinely want to work it out. It's for people who've given up."
"No, no. Please don't misunderstand.  I really want to be a dad," John said earnestly. "I really want it, more than anything else in the world. And Sherlock really wants it, too. And it was my idea. And Sherlock has actually been very wonderful through most of this. I've seen a different side of him. He's…um." John stopped. He pursed his lips. Then he began again, "I couldn't tell him I was having second thoughts. Not now."
Dejected, Lestrade turned around and walked out of the pub. Donovan was waiting for him, looking anxious. They walked together for a while.
Mycroft handed the gun to John. "I said,  'Cocksucker.'"

“It’s served me well.”
"Just…
“John?”
John's jaw flexed.
He couldn't do it. What if the gas found a flame and the whole flat went up, taking Mrs. Hudson with it?
"That's just our baseline condition."
Mrs. Hudson didn't take it from him, leaving it in John's hand. "Imagine how Sherlock feels. He can't ever give it back."
John laughed. "For what? An express adoption?"
Billy looked back and forth between Harry and Sherlock.
"He hasn't cashed a pension check or made a withdrawal for two months."
"Well, I wish he wouldn't because I don't think that much of him anymore…"
The younger Sherlock glanced briefly down at the older Sherlock's gun, then immediately looked back up at his other self's face, hoping the motion wouldn't be noticed. "As for you," he continued nonchalantly, "well, I'm sure you're wondering where this leaves you. You came all this way to a time and place where you don't belong. And I'm sure you came here with a very good idea of what you intended on doing, and now those plans are not to be. What will you do now? I'm sure you have no idea. Do you really think John would be better off under your watchful eye, rather than mine? Especially considering your history of failure? And then this, again, another example of your lack of foresight. I really don't think you thought this through carefully. Your judgment is impaired.  Severely, I'm afraid. I honestly doubt that John would be safe with you for even one minute. As you've pointed out, you've….fetishized his memory. You'd probably worship him if you saw him. How can you possibly keep him safe? No. No, this just won't do. This is a terrible plan. You can't expect me to volunteer to die under these circumstances. This is ridiculous."
John said, reflectively, "I guess…I can't help but be a little disappointed in myself. I wanted to accomplish more with my life by this point."
“There’s
But…he was too hot, too slow to understand why.
Sherlock opened his eyes and saw a familiar face. “John’s not joining me, no. I will have some coffee while I wait.”
Sherlock sneered  in disgust, John's drunken breath offensive. "You're being too  sensitive. You're blowing what I said out of proportion."
I…no, what have you

I've read each troubling passage, every one growing darker and darker than the one before it. When I came upon the sentence, 'I want to die,' I couldn't read anymore." He looked up, his eyes unusually bright in the glow of the laptop. "Shall I read it to you?"
Sherlock said disapprovingly, “You shouldn’t have had so much on an empty stomach.” He raised an eyebrow. “I thought you would have had a higher tolerance, besides.”
Sherlock said, “John? John, I’m sorry for yelling. I...did something stupid and my experiment…and I’m sorry.”
Lestrade said pointedly, "Look, I have  something to say too; I'm sorry about yesterday. I didn't want to show  support for a suspect, not in front of the chief, but I got to thinking  about it and…"
Smiling bitterly, Sherlock slammed the door behind him. "

Lestrade added, "I haven't known where John is for a few months." He paused. "Nobody knows where John is, even Mycroft."
John watched them go, unable to follow. No one looked at John or questioned that he didn't go with them. He watched them until they went around the corner.
“Nope,” Sherlock responded, leaving his candle behind and walking down the hallway towards his bedroom, disappearing in the dark. “Not once.”
"Listen to me," said the old man, ”I was conducting an experiment a moment ago, an experiment which did not yield results at all like I was expecting. In fact, the only reaction was you shouting in this hallway.
"I was wondering when you were going to get to that."
Six weeks later, there was a subtle change; Sherlock Holmes was

and that's it. And I have to share it." But Lestrade was smiling as he said it. There was life in his eyes. "But it was better than haggling with the ex-wife over who got the house."

John took a deep breath and tried to center himself. “Look. I’m so sorry that Mycroft is dead...”
"He told me so."
Sherlock paced restlessly in the kitchen, practically chewing through his fist, watching her casually rifle through. He couldn't tell her she couldn't have John's things. As the next-of-kin, she was entitled to anything she wanted.
Harry shrugged. “I’ve heard…a lot of different versions in the past two years. Clara can’t keep a story straight.

And once he did realize what he'd done, he had a sharp moment of clarity. Then disappointment. He held the empty container in his open hand. He'd wanted his final moments to have more meaning than this. But no matter. Better to get it done and over with.
Suddenly, John's door opened. The driver stood  there expectantly. John started, then looked back at Mycroft while  instinctively digging his fingers into the leather cushions. "Fuck." The  driver lunged into the car and grabbed John's arm and he began to drag  him out of the car. "Goddamn it!" John howled, grabbing the seatbelt,  twisting his legs to press against the seat and the back of the front  seat, trying to stay inside the car.
Sherlock frowned. He waited, but John didn't volunteer. John finished his toast, oblivious. Sherlock drummed his fingers on his knee. "Like what?" he prodded.
Sherlock busied himself him flat hunting on-line. “Three bedrooms. Three bedrooms.” He gave up quickly, shutting his laptop in disgust. He’d become too accustomed to Mrs. Hudson’s generous deal. He couldn’t believe the cost of a three bedroom flat in London!
John shrank back, his pace slowing, stunned. His whole  face fell.

"No, I understand." Slowly, Sherlock went back to his seat and sank down in it. He resumed typing.
Later, in 221b, there was dinner. And the dinner was like all the dinners from recent days; quiet, strained. But Sherlock had cooked, as he become accustomed to, and John found himself thinking;

"You were bullied as a child?"

It pleased Sherlock that the crown of John’s head fit nicely below his chin. John was the perfect height. He didn’t know what to do with his hands. As his palms smoothed over John’s back, he felt like he was feeling too much of John. Like all that touching should be wrong. It wasn’t just fabric under his skin, it was
Chatterjee waggled his crooked, fat finger threateningly in Sherlock’s face. “Martha is threatening to revoke my lease at the end of the year! Because of
The kitchen was still and quiet.
Sherlock groaned, ducking into the kitchen. “Come on. Tell me that London chose this day of all days to be perfectly civilized.”
John said with great impatience, "You made a  Mad-Lib. You're using a Mad-Lib to navigate a conversation with me."
When Sherlock turned fifty, he went back to school.
"This  morning," Lestrade said, nodding. "I told the chief everything I did,  everything that happened. Then I resigned."
He approached  John three times. Each time, he got within ten feet…and veered off into  another direction. This continued on until Sherlock could admit to  himself that he feared any encounter with John, because no matter how  innocent, there was the potential it would provoke the unpredictable war  vet to violence. It took several more days until Sherlock realized that  meant he was afraid of his flat mate.

baby. Jesus.” His soaping slowed. He stopped. He just stood silently under the water.
Sherlock told himself,
"No," she said again, "I don't want to know. I don't want to know any of his secrets. Don't tell me anything."

Sherlock  was right behind him, his long legs skipping steps to catch his friend.  "John!"
She added casually, “What you described sounds more like

Sherlock grew still.
The  hit-and-run case was solved, a scam, an insurance scam,

“Sherlock…”
“I’ll fix the flat,” Sherlock promised. “The window. I’ll do anything.”
He flopped down on the sofa dejectedly, steepeling his fingers against his mouth, deep in thought.
There was a flicker  of resentment in John's eyes. "He's
John stood quietly, toothbrush still in his mouth. "Uh. I dunno. Hadn't thought about it."
“Well, let’s just put aside the sterility for a moment. Remember, I’m a half-foot shorter than most adults on the planet.”
“A baby with Down syndrome?” John postulated. “Cerebral Palsy? Autism?"
"Sherlock  made an open invitation on his blog," Lestrade said. "He posted it. There was a notification in my email this morning." He smiled  whimsically. "It's not all tobacco ash and perfume, you know. Some of  his posts are…interesting. Did you know that he tested the evaporation  rate of glow stick juice by cracking one and dumping it all over his  skin and then raving by himself in coat closet for four hours? I would  have liked to see that. Just Sherlock Holmes in a closet, dancing. You  know. Boom-boom-boom, all by himself…"
John started laughing a bit.
Sherlock folded his arms. "Yes."
John’s face sank into his hands. “Gone back to
Sherlock looked up. "John."
Sherlock cocked his head, taking in John’s body language. Not good.
"Sherlock, wait!" John cried, bursting out of the front door, running, coming to a halt, gripping the back of his chair and tugging Sherlock to face him. "No!" he cried, forlorn, seeing what had happened. He sank to his knees, eyes darting from the vial to Sherlock's face. "No.
“Oh, it’s fine, honey,” Harry purred. “I’ve been a server, too. I know what it’s like. Pancakes, please. Banana walnut with butter and syrup.”
A few silent minutes later, Harry poured them both a coffee and passed one to him.
"I'm not promising he can do anything, but the offer stands that I'd ask for a favor. All he can do is say no."
Myrcroft's hand curled around the grip.  He felt it's weigh, just holding it. Slowly, his eyes opened and he  looked down to examine it. "Thank you, John," he said calmly, turning  the gun over carefully. He meditated on it for a while.
“Sherlock,” John said. He was standing very close, looking up at him with troubled waters in his eyes. “It's been fifteen minutes of this and I might snap if you don't stop.”
Only silence followed, or rather, the absence of a reply from John, not true silence, since that could never happen. What people conceived as “silence“ was in fact just lack of human-created noise pollution. Sherlock took the laptop and ran upstairs, ignoring John's closed door and lack of on-switched lights in his room.
