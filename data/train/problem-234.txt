"It's the twenty-second," the squat man said waspishly, turning back to the board. Jim snorted quietly.
John realised when the detective smiled at him in amusement that he had nodded enthusiastically, perhaps even with a sharp breath in of enlightenment. He felt colour rise to his face. Sherlock's amused smile lingered on him for a moment before he moved on. "Clearly the Lady Brackenstall was lying to us," he finished, levelling a stare at Lestrade. "She drank with the murderer, singular - she knew him."
"I could name several reasons for a detective to be familiar with them," Sherlock told him sternly. "Not just finding murderers. Accidental deaths from erotic asphyxiation sometimes look like murder, and vice versa. It's a fairly tight-knit community, everyone knows everyone. Of course, there are people who enjoy and practise that sort of thing who never tell anyone except their partners, but if they're into BDSM, and they're looking for other people who are into it, someone in this community is going to know them. I know two people personally who know almost everyone else who could give me information I might need. You're quite right," he said, looking over at John as they reached the bar. "You shouldn't be surprised."
, Sherlock thought glumly. He hadn't really thought that Tom would attempt to hide things from him; they had got on fairly well the last case that Sherlock had required his cooperation for, and Sherlock had developed a genuine affection for him. "Can we come in?" he asked, remembering belatedly to introduce John. "This is my flatmate, Doctor John Watson."
Hannah smiled her shy smile again; Kirsty didn't react. Sherlock thought the Doctor was rather missing the point of her declaration, and he didn't understand why they were using such obvious fake names. "Where are we going?" he asked sharply.
"It does, Master Holmes."
Sherlock shoots him an

"Just…" He takes a breath and lets it out slowly, trying to get his heart rate under control. "It was nice. I want it. Give me a moment."
were at stake. A sort of thrill went through him. Sherlock nodded, giving no indication he'd noticed the tiny frisson of excitement his friend had experienced at the urgency of the situation. "All right," he said shortly, burying his hands in his pockets. "Thank you, Molly. I'm certain we'll be able to hand over to the Constabulary before rehearsal, and Billy can take Emilia back from there."
Grieg shrugged self-deprecatingly. "You're with Sherlock, you're almost definitely interested in chemistry." Sherlock glanced at the French boy and tried not to give away just how 'with' Julien he might be. "I thought you two might get on. Your father runs the Deuxiѐme Bureau, doesn't he?"
, though," Sherlock retorted. "The Patronus Charm is worth ten percent of the exam."
"I don't want you to go," I say firmly, looking at him and clamping my hand over his. John's stormy blue eyes widen and his face contracts in something that could be pity or guilt, I can't tell quite yet. "John… You are completely entitled to call me an idiot right now, because I have been… what was it you said about me in that blog entry when we first met?
John smiled, but there was disappointment in his eyes. "This has waited for so long I hardly think a few more hours to put a murderer away is going to kill it," he replied. "We've done the important bit now. Like you said, the sex is secondary."
Both of them recoiled slightly with sharp intakes of breath. Sherlock stared at him with an expression like John had just pulled something out from underneath his feet, breathing quickly, their faces a handspan apart.
The detective shrugged, not meeting John's eyes. "Not really interested in women," he said, mirroring John's pseudo-casual tone of voice. A shiver attempted to announce itself down his spine. Was Sherlock suggesting -
The doctor grins. "I was just trying to prepare you for the next time you get cornered by a psychopath at a fun-fair," he deflects. Sherlock laughs, and John joins in. He can't help but notice the way he's holding the St Bernard, tucked in close to his body.
He settled down on the other settee beside Bradley, watching Jim butter a slice of bread to make a crisp sandwich. He supposed they'd have to see how it went.
do it all his life and still not grow used to it. Sherlock's lips were soft and smooth and warm as they moved against his, his nose pressing into John's cheekbone and blowing warm breaths against his face, and his curls brushing gently against John's forehead.

John nodded emphatically. "I'd like to at least read through it with you," he agreed. "Perhaps sometime this week we could find Molly, as well."

Sherlock shrugged. "There were no portraits of her at the house. She said Teresa called Lestrade, which suggests that they were in place, at the very least, immediately after Lord Brackenstall died, and they must have
The door to the left of the desk swung open and a young red-headed man stepped neatly into the room. "Mister Fitzherbert," he replied politely. "How can I be of assistance?"
John frowned. "It wasn't something I felt like I should be watching," he said. "And I wanted to find you and get you back more than I wanted to see how you thought sex between us would end." Sherlock smiled bitterly. "Why, how did it end?" he asked, grinning.
Sherlock chuckled and gently eased his hands away from the doctor's neck, allowing John to gradually take his weight back onto his legs. "In all likelihood, yes," he agreed. He sighed as John climbed out from between his legs and sat down on the bed, awkwardly tugging at the damp fabric around his groin. "It's a ridiculous position to attempt to strangle someone from," he commented, not trying to sit up himself, "but I imagine her disgust at his different approach to domination would have made her want to get her hands around his throat as soon as possible."
He looked from Hannah to Bill and back again. Why was she hanging around? The only reason the two of them knew each other existed was because of Bill. She couldn't
John only bit him harder, but Sherlock pulled himself reluctantly away and yanked the phone out of his jacket pocket. "Lestrade?" he answered impatiently.

Captain Adler gave the two of them a long look. "She says she can do it," she said finally. "The decision's with you, Doctor Watson."
John laughed. "
The detective made a strong noise. "It's not just beautiful," he protested, "it's spectacular, it's
He stopped for breath and to re-evaluate, but the blond still didn't speak, so he smiled weakly. "I'm really sorry. I know you'd never do that to me, not after all the things you've said to me – and you were more at risk than I was in that situation and you still… I just… I didn't think, and I'm really,
the flying food and the suicide note."
Sherlock turns his head so that their lips meet, sucking him in for a clumsy, bruising kiss that is all teeth and tongue and desperation. John can't help making a noise deep in his throat, the hand that's joined with Sherlock's creeping closer to his crotch and briefly providing some sort of friction for him to thrust against. "I love you," he whispers onto Sherlock's lips.
John's heart, which had picked up in anticipation, sank once more. Sherlock nodded slowly, looking disappointed. "You might ask my Lady's drawing instructor," the sallow-faced servant suggested. "If she knew anyone called Carfax, it would be through that class. And if it was an acquaintance of Lord Brackenstall's, you might find mention of him in his office."
He turned back to Mrs Hudson. "That's better," he ventured cheerfully.

John chuckles in a manner evoking thoughts of
"If you've
Sherlock blinks. "And then I met you, and… I don't know what else you want me to say, John." He sounds confused, as though the answer should be obvious. John recognises the Face that accompanies the Voice and tries not to get annoyed. "Then I met you, and my life stopped being a simple progression of events. Then I met you, and my life… exploded. Then I met you, and I had better things to do than quantify my life as a series of footprints and lines in the sand."
John frowned, glancing at Sherlock: surely there were easier ways than wasting city resources looking for someone who hadn't actually been kidnapped. And what if the Constables

They sat there deliberating for a moment; Simon Cowell finally gave up on the unfortunate candidate and stopped the music on the telly. In the few second's relative silence in the flat, they were handed their answer in an actual
"That wasn't Anne Boleyn in the locket," John pointed out, grinning along with him.
The detective nodded sharply. "Thank you," John supplied on his behalf. She left the room quickly and returned clutching a piece of heavy parchment to her chest.
"We arranged to meet up on Saturday," he told his friend quietly, not looking at him.
"Yeah, I'll miss you too."
He lifted a confident hand to Henzell, leaning idly against the bar-top and ignoring the indignant set of John's face. "Jake!" he greeted brightly.
, and he had intended to attempt it today before the case and its associated dilemmas had overtaken his mind. It was a complicated, punishingly fast piece, though, and the first time he played it – especially when he had just emerged from sleep – it would sound screechy and clumsy and would not at all make for a happy John.
Lestrade nods. "He's a good guy."
who at least half of those are."
John grunted in acknowledgment of the joke. Lestrade looked puzzled. Sherlock sighed. "He was killed post-coitus," he explained impatiently. "Evidently before he had had a chance to tidy himself up."
Sherlock smirked. "The last owner was one of my first clients," he said. "He left the country ten years ago when I found his son living in Italy. I told you before, John, even though I don't ask for payment people like giving me things."
"We could go for a walk."
"John and Sherlock," everyone else murmurs. We look at each other; I give an imperceptible shrug. He grins.
Sherlock actually snorted. "Well, that's ridiculous. I'm hardly someone people should aim to emulate."
John grins at him. "Cheers."
Like a fox in a meadow, he'd transitioned immediately onto the next distraction. They were all pressing until they were solved, but at the conclusion he darted away like a frightened butterfly to the next place of safety and interest. His mind rebelled at stagnation.
Constable Hutchinson must be Sherlock's favourite forensics expert. John sometimes wonders whether he overdoes his praise on purpose, or whether he's just blown away by anyone in the forensics field who isn't Anderson. "Right," John says. "So when do we –"
Finally, the alien gave a triumphant shout. "Got it! The door should be deadlocked. It won't keep them forever, but hopefully it'll give us enough time to get down there and send them packing."
John stops dead. He's never thought of himself as the jealous type, but then he knows now that he's never loved anyone this fiercely before and so all bets are off, and he's sure as hell jealous now. The worst thing – the

John returned the regretful expression, trying not to smile at the fact that Ben had
The man clicked his tongue patronisingly. "Very well. I am here to engage your services in a matter of significant import to the nation."
I tried not to make a face.
John chuckled, though he had stopped believing Sherlock's theory that the burly innkeep put up with him out of gratitude for whatever it was that Sherlock had done for him. He thought, from looking at the two of them relate to each other, that Angelo had just genuinely come to like the detective and want to make his life as nice as possible.
Letting his lips touch the cold mirror would break the fantasy, though, so at the last minute Sherlock pulled away, shrugging his dressing gown off his shoulders – with a bit more difficulty than usual, as John's shoulders were beautifully broader than his own – and lifted an eyebrow. He didn't try to be seductive or flirtatious, because John would never do that. He wanted John as
John scowled. "Yeah, when it suits you. But that was

Crocker blinked, thrown for a moment. "Three years," he answered. "I loaded cargo there before I was made Captain here. That was about a year ago."
Sherlock doesn't need him throughout the day, and it's a slightly disappointed John who makes his way up the stairs to 221B at around half-past two. He's so preoccupied with hoping Sherlock's inside that he doesn't quite see the suitcase right in front of the door until he's already tripped over it and landed on his face.
feels about it." He hefted his bag back onto his shoulder and picked up his plate, tapping Bill sharply on the shoulder to get up. "But was it Shakespeare who said that thing about loving someone being the best way to make them love you?"
." The giggle dissolved into a full-blown laugh and John couldn't contain the grin at having caused it.
As in a last desperate bid for his attention, John stepped in and grabbed a fistful of the front of Sherlock's dress.
So he turned back to the monitor, watching as the Doctor tapped and the Judoon placed their device against the back wall. Something – the Doctor's
- John had never considered how often he thought of Sherlock as cold, untouchable, like a marble statue placed somewhere to be revered but never reached. It was a fundamentally flawed view; certainly the detective came across as unemotional in the interactions with other people that John had seen, and a few other members of the crew of
The Vulcan hesitated for a moment, her eyes darting down to the First Officer. "I can do it," she said firmly.
The redhead shrugged cheerfully. "Safe is boring." He turned away for one last kiss with his wife, and then John stepped away from Timothy for the last time, waving goodbye as they stepped through the departure gates. Neither of them said 'I love you'. Mostly because neither of them really did.
For a moment he thought John would bolt, run out the door and save the messy
When she had gone, John eased himself up the bed. Sherlock met him with a slightly wary look, but when he opened his arms John slid into them easily and pressed a careful kiss to his lips.

Sherlock's phone rang again.
And yet… John's already such a huge part of my life that I miss him when he's not here, and the thought that I might have hurt him so badly with my desperate below-the-belt blows that he might never come back makes my stomach clench so fast I feel like throwing up. Evidently the rest of my mind – and definitely my body – wants him.
a case, wasn't there? Quite an important one. If we leave now, he'll have to call us back later."
"I want this." Sherlock's voice is firm and John can't help but believe him. "I don't know how I'm going to react, and I'm not entirely sure that it'll be positive, but if you still want to even knowing all that then
"You said when Mycroft asked you to go that there wouldn't be any major evidence in Sussex," he said, pushing the smug thought to the back of his mind.
him, and Sherlock found himself terribly, achingly hard where he sat at the memory of John's teeth sinking into the vulnerable flesh of his neck.
John thought back to following Jim from Islington to Bloomsbury just to discover that he'd gone there for some bizarre hookup with a burly blond boy he'd met at the inter-school swimming competition. Yes, the Jim he'd known had definitely been gay, and wouldn't have pretended otherwise for anyone. Apparently high school on his own had knocked that out of him, too.
John hesitated, trying to assess where the hurt had been in his remarks. "So many things you do remind me of Will," he said tentatively. "You're both so brilliant at what you do, completely unique in your fields, and you have the same kind of driving energy - I just think that you'd enjoy spending time with him, that's all."
"The Ball and Chain - an extremely exclusive bar in Soho," Sherlock told him matter-of-factly. John gave him a familiar
"Well," John said, another smile creeping up on his face. "I think we should throw out the idea of role-playing sex as other people and just have sex as ourselves. With each other. And
to take care of them. "I'm sorry. I get grumpy at work because I'd rather be out solving a case with you." He reaches up a hand to gently swipe the toast crumbs away from Sherlock's face and pretends he doesn't notice when the detective leans into the touch. "I'd always rather be with you."
"I want

Then he sighed. "Sherlock…" he began, but then he stopped, put his head in his hands, and groaned. "I could never be angry with you," he admitted through his palms. "I was angry at
The boy smiled at him, but it had lost some of its enthusiasm. "All right," he said forlornly. "I guess I'll see him tomorrow."
The pleasure of his second orgasm in John's body left him breathless and exhausted, panting and trembling on his bed. As the climax faded, the fact that he hadn't slept the previous night came back to him in full force. He dragged his fingers lazily through the fresh come over his stomach and chest, sighing happily, and before he could stop to think whether it was a good idea, he had dozed off.

if the others are ahead of you leading you on, you'll have time to change behind the door while they enter. Orsino will only be a coat on top of Sir Toby's shirt and trou', from my discussions with Archie so far."
The Doctor was silent for a moment. "Probably. Ideally, we need to do a thorough sweep of the building for them before taking any kind of action, but…"
– I have been without a butler for some months and recruiting the replacement has proven difficult. I have a very specific picture of what I want from my staff." He smirked at the memory of Leslie's indolent heart-shaped smile. "I am assuming you are here because of Sherlock? Perhaps we should adjourn to my private parlour."
sexual pleasure, probably because he was in the same state. "You don't know what she was like," he reminded him breathlessly.
John grins. "The one you refused to take because it was boring and obvious?"
John snorts. "I meant more in terms of whether it's about to eat through the floor and surprise Mrs Hudson."
Sherlock nodded slowly, apparently appeased. He lifted the wine bottle from the mantel and held it up to the light, frowning at it. It gleamed red, dregs and bees' wings floating around in it. The frown intensified as he put it down and looked back at the glasses; even from where he stood, John could see the dark droplets that remained at the bottom of all three glasses, one even containing the scraps of bees' wings.
, his brain kept repeating dumbly – pressing his hands into his thighs, applying pressure, trying to minimise the blood loss and hoping the kid would survive until they could get back to St Anthony's, and Bill was shouting at him but everything sounded so far away and he couldn't hear what they were saying as he fumbled with one hand for his medical bag because there had to be
"Maybe, but that wasn't the argument. I still win."
Molly looked shocked. "What?" she stuttered.
But that thy brothers beat aside the point."
Sherlock sank back into the cold concrete of the wall behind him, his fingers tugging at John's jacket to keep their mouths and bodies together; John took the hint and shifted onto one knee, hovering awkwardly over the taller boy, letting his hands fall onto Sherlock's chest to prop him up. When he pulled away this time, Sherlock was panting, his throat undulating with each breath. John's eyes automatically gravitated towards the pale column of flesh; without putting too much thought into it, he leaned forwards and sank his teeth into it.
He sounded genuinely fearful, as though worried that the affection he had experienced for the past few days may be simply a phase, only bestowed upon him because he was the most new and interesting thing in the Duke's life.
that's not true…" Then there were lips on his ear, lips and tongue and
, though, Sherlock. When you first heard him coming."
John shouldn't chuckle at this considering how angry he'd been at the time, but he does. "Well, considering the last time we saw each other she told me she never wanted to talk to me again, I don't think I'll be calling anytime soon."
The cabbie had given them a slightly dirty look when Sherlock had asked to be taken to Soho Square, and he gave them another as he pulled up the cab and announced their arrival. Sherlock counted out the exact amount of cash he could read off the meter, earning himself a raised eyebrow from John; usually he just threw the nearest whole note at the driver before taking off. Some people really didn't deserve tips.
Sherlock waits until they're out the front door before he lets out a hoarse roar of frustration. John stands back until he runs out of breath and swings a fist into the wall instead; as Sherlock steps back, breathing heavily and nursing his begloved knuckles, he clears his throat.
The playwright made an interested noise. "You must have made quite the first impression on him," he commented. John tried an unaffected shrug, but he'd often thought the same thing himself.
The woman looked disappointed. "So you're like… an interplanetary electrician?"
energy to the stage," he derided. "But thank you, John. I've never acted with a cast this young before, but they're not bad. Very eager."
"Us," Sherlock says quietly, not meeting his eyes, his cheeks flushed gently pink. "I couldn't have done any of it without you."
Sebastian Moran clutched at the bloody remnants of his left arm and glared mulishly up at the barrel of the gun in front of his face. Sherlock lifted a condescending eyebrow. "You're hardly in a position to be stubborn, Colonel," he said idly, focussing all of his energy on stopping his hand from shaking. John's hand wouldn't have shaken. He watched with implacable face while the ex-Colonel drew in a shuddering breath and spat at his feet. He quirked an entirely mirthless grin. "Suit yourself," he said coldly, and pulled the trigger.
Somewhat abruptly, the two of them made their way down the street, Sherlock flipping the coin jauntily back at the boy as he went and making him scramble after it. "You know what this means, John, don't you?" Sherlock stated, practically vibrating with enthusiasm.
Lord Trelawney-Hope's jaw works furiously. "It isn't. I did check, Mr Holmes."
"But why
"Why didn't you say anything?" he asked indignantly. "I've been sitting here for months now thinking I was the only one who remembered, feeling guilty for standing you up that day and thinking that maybe if I hadn't, things would have been different, and that whole time you

He promised her he'd replace them when he came back. I was beginning to think I'd imagined seeing him in the window, that I was just worried… but those blocks were in the corner of the room. And there was…" she breaks off for a moment, takes a deep breath and looks up again. "There was blood on the windowsill. I called the police, and they arrested the beggar, but I… I don't understand why he was there, what happened. And it sounds stupid, but I feel like I'd

hear villainous music playing in the background. He briefly questions his own sanity, but then Mycroft gives Sherlock a positively murderous glance, and the first few bars of the Imperial March cut off with a deep baritone chuckle. "Would you two grow up? We are talking about your involvement in a murder case, for God's sake!"
John gave him an indulgent smile.
John took a step back; Sherlock screwed up his face in concentration. John was about to stop him and tell him he was trying too hard, but then the creases in his forehead relaxed suddenly. John watched as his friend's expression became calm, almost beatific. A tiny smile played with the edges of his mouth. Then Sherlock raised his wand and murmured,

come from this alone, in time. He would have been embarrassed about the state of his trousers if he could not feel that John was also half-hard.
As the kettle boils, there's a knock on the door and Detective Inspector Lestrade bounds up the stairs. John's heart sinks, but he doesn't let it show. "John," Lestrade greets, nodding. John grins.
Lady Trelawney-Hope flushes even brighter for a moment before pulling the door open enough for them to pass. "Thank you. Please come in, Mr Holmes. I hope this means that you intend to reconsider my case?"
"Relax," Sherlock told him. "Either you'll find her or we will."
"You two should still stick around," Lestrade told the children, his surprising composure throwing Sherlock's sulk into sharp relief. "We didn't get to look at the rest of his house, it's still worth keeping an eye on them -"
"Hannah," she laughs. "Hannah Murray – it's been years since I've seen you, how are you?"
John held his breath, but the only noise in his ears was Sherlock's panting. The floor remained steady under his feet, and the only thing that attempted to assault them was Redbeard jumping up to lick at John's fingers fixed around Sherlock's waist.
he began, retreating to the back of the stage and ushering the others in front of him.
Sherlock smiled weakly. "White and one sugar, please." He sat down in the chair John had vacated to get the door and thumbed absently through his study notes. John watched him as he brought the kettle back onto the boil with a tap of his wand and spooned tea leaves into two mugs.
The woman crossed her arms, glancing behind her. John looked: the floor right outside his office was covered in a thin film of dust. "They disintegrated," she explained, grimacing. "They weren't happy about it. The screaming was awful."
Donovan was standing outside the interrogation room when they arrived at New Scotland Yard wearing a bitter, disgruntled expression; she sighed grumpily when she saw them, pushing the door open and attempting to stare Sherlock down as they passed her. Charlotte was sitting at a table, her cuffed hands resting on her lap, looking pale and frightened but still confused, and still with that tiny hint of smug pleasure. Sherlock frowned at her.
and a dimension just like a marble sculpture. Speaking words in his order is a privilege. And speaking them with you…" Sherlock fell silent, as though he didn't quite know how to finish the sentence and suspected that it might be more sensible not to.
John frowned, still running every third step or so to keep up with the other man. "Surely he should do the
Ben almost jumped out of his seat. "
Instead, of course, the uneasily fat man stepped on the corner of his bag, and Sherlock heard a plasticky

," he panted back, letting his hands play back up the taller boy's torso, his fingernails flicking accidentally over Sherlock's right nipple. John was almost surprised when the other boy shuddered at the sensation; he'd been led to believe it was mostly women's nipples that were sensitive. Experimentally, he reached up to tweak his own and noted the tiny frisson of sensation down between his legs.

of being completely happy to generate the Patronus. After a few moments, Sherlock stood up again, gave John a quick, nervous glance, then closed his eyes.
"Yes, well, it wasn't interesting on its own, but now there have been three of them it becomes much more stimulating."
John made a noncommittal face. He knew Burbage could act, or Will wouldn't keep giving him all the lead roles he had accumulated. That didn't mean he had to like other people saying it.
"We can't," John replies, still implacably calm.
Sherlock frowned. "How could I? I didn't know what was going to happen and if I told him it wouldn't have worked. As far as he's concerned, I just killed myself."
Sherlock cleared his throat from behind them, making John jump. The detective grinned at him when he had turned. "It really isn't as difficult as people think, you know," he remarked. He held up a few bundles of papers tied with black ribbon that John recognised as the cue-scripts that Will kept. "If the two of you are quite finished."
expression, and John completely sympathises with his glee at being so right. "Oh, my God," the DI breathes. "It is, too. It's the missing guy." St. Claire gives out a desolate moan. "So you're saying he was involved in the April stock scandals?"
"I'm not," he replied unevenly. "Usually. But sex is a biological imperative. Some experts think it's more important to us than food." John made an exaggerated expression of interest and folded his arms beneath his chin, stroking firmly up the length of Sherlock's cock as he did so. Sherlock made an impatient noise. "The purpose of this exercise was
ever mentioned by either of them?"
"St. Claire," she replies, and her voice is low and throaty, like sex and lung cancer. "Mrs, not Ms." John breathes a sigh of relief. "Yes, please. Milk and one."
"I'm housetraining him," John says conspiratorially. On cue, Sherlock sweeps out of the kitchen with a mug in one hand.
"I think the MET would almost owe it to you if that lead on the Camden Road killer comes through," he said lightly. "You have a talent, and I'd like to see what it could do without cocaine holding it back."
"Very well," Sherlock said, pursing his lips. It was obvious that not having noticed the boy had irritated him. "Is it the jewellery?"
. He knew he was a significant part of Sherlock's life, surely he must take up residence in his mind, if he made space for some of the other things that John had seen so far on his wander. Neither of the room's occupants seemed to have noticed him, so John watched for a while as Mycroft sat in the judge's seat and stared disapprovingly down at him. Perhaps it was meant to represent the fact that Sherlock's relationship with John was not particularly
Between mouthfuls, John had time to fix his friend with a stern look. "Yeah."
Bill's head snapped up from

O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!" He settled once more for wringing his hands in grief, glancing back over at Will and his group, that seemed to have assumed the role of the entourage around his dead husband.
He didn't really want to admit to that, so he smiled tightly. "Why, what do you suggest?"
This time, the door swung open onto a room that was unmistakeably a library.
Sherlock stops to look at him as though this isn't radically out of the ordinary. "Of course," he says happily. "You only think when you've eaten, and I need you functional with me. This case looks promising."
Holmes smiled broadly, his cheeks crinkling. John marvelled again at how the expression softened his entire face. "Sherlock, please," he said. Ben grinned brightly. "Would you prefer me to call you 'Molly'? I didn't see the play that earned you the nickname, but if this afternoon's performance was anything to go by I'm certain it was excellent."
His heart sank a little. "No, it's Sherlock. Can I come in, please?"
"It's ten minutes to curtain, we can't cancel," Ben piped up, his dark eyes wide.
He hadn't meant to kiss John like he had. He'd meant to draw it out, teasing and almost getting close enough until the shorter boy finally threw caution and sexual identity to the wind and kissed
. Could he really have a typical relationship with John?
He sounded so confident, so contemptuous, that a flash of annoyance shot through John's spine. "So why do you keep asking me along?" he asked hotly.
Sherlock shot Hannah a small smile before looking down. The lights overhead were casting several pale shadows extending out to one side of him like petals on a flower. None of them were as dark as the one Kirsty had had in the forest, and none of them were the reason for his sharp intake of breath and sudden inability to think rationally.
The blonde's fists clenched, and he made to take a step towards Sherlock, but his girlfriend reached up to his face, pouting sloppily. "What did he mean, you're only doing it to make someone else jealous?" she asked, her voice much too high and needy. The boy gave Sherlock a positively murderous glare. "Sebastian?"
in his command. Most of all, it was the tiny knowing smiles she gave John every time she ordered either of them to do anything.

He chuckled. "I can't help but wonder what a regular sex life will do to Sherlock, though," he said wryly. "It

he shouted; helpfully, the detective cowered in the face of it, making himself as small as possible.
on him in any traditional sense. Their relationship wasn't traditional enough for that, and nowhere had they explicitly said they were going to be exclusive. He simply hadn't thought there was anything the other boy might
– he'd been a little hasty.
The redhead nodded, his lips twisted into a wry grin. "You went all the way to Bloomsbury to watch Jim hook up with some burly blond," he confirmed. John shrugged, hoping desperately that Bill would laugh it off and change the subject. "Well, that'll teach you to follow people," the boy laughed instead, his face clearing almost immediately. "But none of that explains why you look like you've been dragged backwards through a box-hedge."
Their hips were still rocking together, beyond Sherlock's control now; pleasure was sparkling through his chest with each slide of John's cock against his. "John," he murmured, removing his hands from the doctor's arse and working it between their bodies to wrap around their cocks. "I can't - I need to come, we can -"

They laughed. "Patience. I didn't think that was the impression I gave her," he commented. "So you reckon I should start keeping an eye out for sixth-formers who want me to teach them photosynthesis?"
"Okay what?" Sherlock asked bewilderedly.
Sherlock shrugged. "There didn't seem to be, no," he admitted. "Miracle himself certainly seemed blameless. But if that's where they saw each other, there's always the possibility someone else in the class overheard something they shouldn't have. Now that Lestrade can give a workable description of Peters' female co-conspirator it could be worth running that past our drawing instructor." He frowned at the wall, picking up two new sketches and fingering them thoughtfully. "Most of our other knowledge centres around Carfax," he observed. He pinned drawings of a man and a woman and a sketch of a mutilated ear above her portrait. "All the other people we know are involved have had witnessed contact with her, not with Lady Brackenstall: Peters, Crocker, even the Queen." His pinning of the drawings, punctuating each name, became suddenly more violent. "There must be something I'm missing about the Brackenstall case. Maybe I've focussed too much on Lady Carfax because of Mycroft." He picked up a piece of parchment with his brother's name on it and aggressively pinned it to the top of the wall with a bone-handled jackknife. John flinched.
knows."
Sherlock smiles, lowering his mug after a swill of tea; the sappy rom-com feel of the moment compels him to lean forwards slightly, closer to his flatmate, so close that if he focusses he can fill himself up with that rich and earthy smell that is Sherlock underneath the façade. He looks up into clear silvery eyes to find that Sherlock has leaned forwards too, and now they're close enough to kiss, only –
with his beloved twists and tangles, but by becoming one.
"John," Sherlock said perfunctorily, without moving or opening her eyes.
"Don't answer it," John suggested, bending his head to kiss and bite at the soft underneath of Sherlock's jaw.
He had a sudden image of the time he'd been tracing the arc of Jack the Ripper and he'd settled for a chalk sketch of the outline of a human body on the floor, studying it with eyes and fingers and photographs, only this time it was a real body,
– have the whole issue wrapped up before they even got to Scotland Yard and jump on the doctor the moment they got home. The idea was desperately appealing.
I used the MIT Shakespeare text for this chapter and haven't had time to check it against my Norton version, if that bothers anyone.
He'd been shot again. In the hospital. How did that even happen?
this is, him and Sherlock on a beach, barefoot with their shoes dangling from their fingers, loose and totally comfortable with each other. He recognises that it's clichéd, but he cannot think of any other place in the world he would rather be.
"All right, all right," John said, but he was grinning. "Head forwards again."
," Sherlock scolded, rolling his eyes, but he looped his arm through John's anyway. "I've never liked this scene. It seems completely pointless, except to close off the play for the mechanicals."
he called off the stage, answered by a simple strain of music.
Sherlock inhaled sharply, his hips thrusting up automatically. John smiled, and then he was biting at his lower lip, thrusting his tongue harshly between Sherlock's own teeth. Then he pulled away.
Sherlock waved an airy hand in dismissal, as though he had absolutely no desire to speak to John, but something seemed to vibrate underneath his skin, lighting up his eyes with a subtle kind of anticipation. "
Sherlock hesitated for the barest of seconds before nodding. "See you this afternoon," he agreed. He took the tiniest of steps forward, and for a moment John thought he would cross the room and press a kiss to John's lips; but the moment passed, and Sherlock heaved a brief sigh before leaving the room in a swirl of that magnificent coat.
with Molly."
Sherlock waves an innocuous hand. "Oh, just an experiment. It doesn't matter, I solved the case without it."
This struck two nerves in John, really, as it was simultaneously so right and so completely wrong. "I wouldn't expect you to understand," he said cruelly. "We're
He could see John rolling his eyes behind him out of the corner of his own and he smiled slightly. He liked it when John did things like that – it signified the things that he had accepted about Sherlock that had driven all his predecessors away. He had never expected to find someone who merely smiled encouragingly at him as he peered intently underneath the fingernails of a dead body.
was critical of the plan too, mainly because it wasn't really a plan at all. Somewhere between now and that first murder he had become completely sidetracked by John, and really they hadn't made any progress at all on the actual
Don't I owe it to him to try?
Their circle was growing gradually tighter as they stepped around each other, and to John's delight, their audience was following them, closing around them until their makeshift stage had lost a third of its size.
Sherlock smiled tightly and looked up; the second man was short and stocky, his face comfortable in the haggard look acquired by men who have been through extreme circumstances, a plastic standard-issue cane swinging idly in one hand.
"Come
he did. Not in front of us."
For a moment the man looked puzzled. "Do I?" he asked – but the question had barely left his lips before the answer was tumbling after it. "Yes –
Sherlock snorted a little. John was flooded once again with a rush of affection for his friend, not the first since the night before, and turned to him to say something about it when he heard
He turned on his heel - his coat flaring out around him like a doxy's skirt - and began to stride out of the room. John smiled weakly at the secretary. "Thank you for your help," he said, but the youth had already rolled his sleeves back up and returned to his copying. He sighed and followed his friend back down the stairs instead.
The great detective merely raised an eyebrow, ignoring the hand that Crocker held out for him to shake. John cleared his throat awkwardly. "You too," he said, glancing at Sherlock to receive his disapproving frown with one of his own. Sherlock had systematically ignored any contribution that John had had in the investigation - admittedly there hadn't been much, but John couldn't help feel a little insulted by the detective's insistence on using the word
. John, you have no idea how much. But masturbating is just manual stimulation – I never had anything to stimulate my
because she knows you won't believe her," the Irish boy drawled, nodding in John's direction. "I never understand why people – what's the term?
"No," Sherlock agreed. "I believe the remainder of the jewellery belonged to Lady Carfax, confirming my suspicion that they were kidnapped by the same person. I intend to have her maid, Miss Devine, verify the ownership of the items."
The shadows had collected around the outer wall of the castle, swarming and shifting, clearly looking for a way in. John suppressed a shudder and turned back to the Sherlock on the bed, who still hadn't moved.
Ben finally pulled a shirt on over the leaves painted onto his torso. "Would you join us for a drink, Sherlock?" he asked eagerly, grinning up at the older actor.
O'Doherty smiled fondly down at him. "Well, not to point any fingers, Mr Murray, but some of us certainly need some coaching in how to interact with women. I'm sure you're an expert in that, aren't you, Mr Watson? I'll leave Mr Murray in your capable hands."
Sherlock let out a long, controlled breath. "Interesting," he said softly. "Well, that certainly solidifies a few things. What can you tell us about your impression of Lady Carfax's character?"
"Why are we using fake names?" he asked out of the corner of his mouth.
. "Maintenance," Kirsty threw over her shoulder. "Out to the forest."
Molly breathed, causing Will to explode in hysterical laughter.
. I look at him again, but he's still not listening, so he doesn't receive my silent plea for help. "Not long," I say eventually. He said he didn't mind, and it's easier than explaining. "It's a new development, we're not really sure it's working."
he chuckled, loping forwards to take responsibility for the statement.
Sherlock adjusted his tie and tucked his shirt back in. "No, thank you. This is sufficient," he said briskly.

The resulting chuckle was rich and dark, luxurious on Sherlock's ears like red velvet cake. "You're welcome," he replied idly. "You looked like you needed it."

from her. "None of this was Charlotte's fault," Amy said, looking directly at the viewing window. "She didn't know anything." She sighed heavily, glancing at Lestrade. "You should have seen her face when she realised that Montgomery prick was dead. He treated her like shit and she still got so upset."
"What's the date?" John asked, his pen poised over the top right corner of the grid-book.
The curly-haired teen outside widened his eyes innocently. "I'm sorry?" he said politely.
," I shout as I spin around on my dressing-gown, turning my face away from him so that he can't see that there are actual
They froze as Helena stalked onstage, chased by Lysander, still babbling his enchanted vows of devotion. John raised an eyebrow at Ben as she rounded on him.
as well, to better portray the romance between Viola and Orsino, if Shakespeare believes them to be similar."
John looked over at Jim, who'd seen it too – he was starting to think it was impossible to hide anything from him – and chuckled. "Yeah. Right. Well, you get the movie then, and Brad and I'll get the food, and we'll meet in the TV room in five?"
Molly reached for Sherlock's arm as he dashed past.
Ben kept up a steady stream of praise, reliving their performance as they changed out of costume. John tried not to stare as his friend unselfconsciously stripped the dress over his head, leaving him bare but for his underclothes. He swallowed hard instead. He wondered what the detective would say if John allowed his own infatuation to approach the degree of visibility that Ben's had reached. Would he still want John to follow him around when they were not practising for the stage?

The former captain of the Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers smiles devilishly. "Do you believe in me, Greg?"
"Sherlock," the other man gasped. "You don't have to…"
And yet – surely the first experiment should have been enough to show Sherlock the dangers of inviting sexual behaviour from John when he didn't mean it. Asking for
"I certainly saw someone who could run a lot faster without that ridiculous cane," he replied nonchalantly, sliding into the taxi first. "If I'm honest, it was more what you saw in me. You said 'brilliant' when everyone else said 'piss off'. I couldn't let that go."
"What else am I supposed to say?" Bill asked, shrugging nonchalantly. "I think it's great. I'd be bisexual myself if I'd ever found a man attractive. Now you're going to get hit on by twice as many people."
Sherlock hummed, but he didn't sound particularly interested. "Unless she's not safe," he completed ominously, not looking at John.
She laughed shyly. "It was vodka and raspberry," she told him. "I'd love another."
he observed with some amusement.
The English teacher laced his long fingers behind his back and strolled up to John, tipping his practically two-dimensional frame until he loomed over him. John stood up straighter. "What's this about you not taking English this year?"
Sherlock groaned again, throwing John's head back into his pillow; the bed smelled of Sherlock and
know that?"
The detective looked like he wanted to argue, but the maid re-entered the room clutching a heavier bundle of papers and he closed his mouth. He accepted the package without comment, instead simply shaking them out, his eyes flying across the first one. Devine looked up at John, unsure how to react. He tried a grateful smile as his friend read through the letters at lightening speed; John glanced down at the first one and tried to read along, but Sherlock seemed to read faster than John could even process what his eyes were telling him.
It was indeed only a few minutes that John was away from Bill – he had barely sat down on his bed before the redhead burst into his room with only a cursory knock on the door. John cringed, but Bill only flung himself onto the bed and studied John thoughtfully. "Tell me about it," he said after a moment.
him to. The kiss is unhurried, gently parting his flatmate's lips and exploring his mouth with his tongue, holding Sherlock to him securely but not too tight that he can't get away. In response, the detective clutches at both of his arms and tries to pull him in closer until John is drowning gently in so much
Nonplussed, John looks up at the man. He thinks he might have seen him somewhere before, but politicians are always in the newspaper nowadays anyway so that's not unlikely.
And why not? If he wasn't mistaken, and he didn't think he was, John had come because he had heard his own name in Sherlock's voice. He couldn't get more concrete proof than that that John wanted him.
. And he looked furious.
Sherlock gasped as John's mouth was suddenly covering his, knocking him back onto the bed; a now-familiar stocky body was climbing over his, calloused palms cupping his jaw through a clumsy but definitely enthusiastic kiss. Not daring to break it to ask what was happening, Sherlock grabbed John's back and held on.
you the differentiation between different types of tobacco ash was important," he gloats finally. John picks up the paper and smiles idly.
"The thing is, though," Sherlock was saying, his own footsteps only the tiniest bit unsteady, "that no-one else has… no-one else uses

Sally caught John's eye and beamed, and this time even John could see the predatory gleam in her eyes. He tried to smile back. "Yes, Ms Roper – could I use the science photocopier after class, please?" he asked.
Then he smiled. "I heard you were good, Mister Holmes," he said, leaning back in his chair with a far more comfortable air.
The speech over, Sherlock quietened into gasps and tiny sobs; John let him, marveling inwardly at his absolute passion. A few people in their gathering audience clapped briefly. John waited until the detective seemed to have composed himself a little before replying calmly,
doctor," John laughed. "Does that help?"
There was a pause while John worked through the statement. If Sherlock wanted John to know that he thought about…
The taller man looked mildly surprised and almost disappointed for the span of about half a second before he hitched his boyish smile back up and spun around again, doing something rather violent to another lever. "So!" he repeated in the same bright voice. "The whole of space is open to you. Where do you want to go?"
John eyed him suspiciously. The way he was leaning against the panel behind him had made his blazer slip away from his chest, and John could see the curve of his collarbone through the open top buttons of his too-big white shirt. He had the air of a boy who had grown taller and slimmer in a short space of time and had not yet purchased clothes to fit his new figure, but it was still startlingly obvious how good-looking he was underneath the ill-fitting uniform. John swallowed. Since when did his throat dry up at the tiniest hint of milky-white collarbone under a boy's shirt? That was disconcerting, to say the least. He'd never – he didn't – he wasn't
John is up in an instant, reaching for his coat. "What, Lucas' house?"
Sherlock thought about it. "I think further experimentation is required."
John continued to thrust harder and faster, but it wasn't enough – Sherlock's cock throbbed until he was utterly desperate. He

John watches with considerable amusement the tiny flinch Sherlock gives at each missed vowel and incorrect grammatical clause. When the boy is finished, the consulting detective turns to Lestrade. "This is ridiculous," he says shortly. "It's not even worth the resources you would use to get him back to the Yard and look for a reason to keep him there. There's no way in Hell this man has done anything wrong. I'm going to have another look through the house for a safe."
The detective actually shuddered minutely, his eyelashes fluttering. John held his own body still by sheer force of will, desperate as it seemed to be to copy the motion.
John jumps off his chair and runs back to Baker Street as fast as he can.
Sherlock blinked, as if he had suddenly realised whose arms he was leaning into, and shoved at John so hard that he almost fell, saved only by the fact that their audience had pressed close enough to the two of them to catch him. "
"Upstairs," John insisted with a growl, withdrawing his hand from Sherlock's trousers and helping him back onto his feet. "Before we lose the ability to move altogether."
I pray you now, receive them."
Sherlock snapped upright so quickly he almost bumped heads with John. "
. I follow him into the kitchen nonetheless, allowing him to pluck a tissue from the box on the kitchen table and hold it up to my nose. I quirk an eyebrow at him, just to let him know he's patronising me. Quite often, he forgets.
Hannah shrugged helplessly, but Marchbanks tipped his head thoughtfully. "I know the basics, but I've never touched it before. It's a simple system. Let's take a look, shall we?"
They went back to the front door first – Sherlock tried not to be impressed that John had not needed to be told his reasons for the move – and grabbed their coats from the hook by the door. John held Sherlock's out for him to slip into, and then grabbed a handful of his arse and squeezed it, hard.
the last word was going to be, but Sherlock knows that too, and they both know it's a fool's excuse. "Don't, John. Just go away."
John lifts his eyes back to the consulting detective in front of them. "I
his friend grunted into his mouth in response, pulling them in tighter to each other, separating their mouths just long enough to take a deep gasping breath and lick a wet stripe up his own palm, supplementing John's grip with his own and letting out another rich moan. The added pressure proved far too much for the last of John's restraint; with a whimper, he surged forwards, stepping between Sherlock's legs and pinning him to the wall with his entire body, groaning when the detective hooked one knee over his hipbone as further leverage to push his groin harder against John's with a high-pitched wail. For a moment they writhed together in this space, both pushing harder to chase their own pleasure, frantic and thoughtless with desperation; then Sherlock shuddered urgently, and bit down so hard on John's shoulder he knew it would leave a bruise. John utterly failed to hold back a moan as the detective flailed and hot wetness spread between them. His own cock throbbed painfully but he backed off, slowing his thrusts and allowing Sherlock to control his slides through their clasped hands as he whimpered and shook, slowing with each gasping breath until he finally allowed his limbs to relax, his knee slipping from its hook on John's hipbones.
The detective rolled his eyes, but his face was set in a resolute scowl. "What do you want, Mycroft?" he snapped.
John paused, slightly floored. He hadn't thought of it quite like that, but what Sherlock had said made sense. "That's why Shakespeare wrote the final scene the way he did," the detective continued. "Remember, you said when I came to complain about it that he had said that he wanted to write
him before. Then Sherlock smiled and visibly relaxed, and John knew he had him back.
Sherlock let out a long, shaking breath, and nodded. John smiled warmly and placed one chaste kiss on his still-open mouth. "Undress and lie down," he requested gently.
Lestrade cleared his throat. "It was still only half six when we turned up, but she was sitting in the middle of the living room, sobbing. Blonde, with bruises all over her face, even worse than Charlotte's. And fresh scratches all down her arms."
"Boring," he pronounced, finishing his toast with a flourish. Julien smiled again and handed over the paper, turning his full attention to the intricate process of politely eating egg and toast. Sherlock rolled his eyes.
Sherlock smiled softly. "Yes," he replied. And then, with a final peck of lips on lips, he had swept around and strode out of the changing room.
The doctor bent close. "Ages," he pronounced scientifically after a moment. "It wouldn't have been pleasant for either of them."
John had argued this point - it was obvious that the Holmes brothers had not had a harmonious childhood, and he wasn't sure that the elder brother was quite as capable of such evil as Sherlock was keen to accuse him of. Sherlock had given him a look of such deep betrayal that John had shut up. Whatever history there was between them, Sherlock knew his own brother better than John or Lestrade.
It had been an incredibly long time since anyone had called him
that a character can have is to further the plot of the play, to serve the author's purpose, to drive the action forwards. If you attempt to treat them like people, then you must give every manservant who has a single line in a single scene their entire backstory. The possibilities are endless and dizzying. You simply cannot work like that."

with eyes other than Sherlock's. John licked his lips, making the sentiment as clear as he could. When this was over and they were home – John's or Sherlock's, he didn't care – he was going to take the other boy apart with those lips, with that tongue. Sherlock's blush darkened, and his own full cupid's bow twitched into a luxurious smile.
Their eyes met for a moment and John smiled, apparently appeased, but Sherlock still thought he caught the words
he read.
Lestrade carefully bagged the hair, frowning at the corpse. "Did you have any other theories, then?" he asked.

Ben shook his head. "Will went to get him from his house earlier," he explained. "So he had time to talk to him before they got here."
He'd half-expected the young man's face to close off, or look sad, but Sherlock Holmes merely smiled. "Oh," he said, sounding tired. "Just… just a fantasy, I suppose."
The playwright, too, was scratching his head in mounting panic. "I know, I see it," he said absently. "Sorry, John, I don't know what I was thinking, I knew you'd be playing both parts when I wrote this. I must have thought we could cheat it somehow."
"Sherlock, you
It was interesting, this form of control. Because John
Sherlock's furious whirlwind frown did not abate, his voice gravelly and broken to match the words that John barely tried to make sense of as they flowed from his mouth. "

Long, pale fingers pause with the cake-fork buried in berry compote. Sherlock looks up innocently. "I hope you planned on sharing that," John tells him, his best silky-smooth threatening Captain voice in place. The consulting detective looks down at his fork, back up at John, and starts wolfing down the cheesecake as fast as he can.
John couldn't help but smile.
He had been wrong to think that attachment to other people was a weakness, that was becoming clear. It plainly took a lot of strength for Joe to fall for him – surely it would have been

"When last you saw either lady, did they seem troubled? Did either of them act any differently from any other class they had attended?" he asked slowly.
John smiled.

Sherlock raised an eyebrow, still grinning like an alley-cat on a trash heap. "Humour me," he pleaded.
It was, as John had noted previously, an extremely cocky point of view. But he'd just seen the skill with which Holmes used one of his talents, and the other had been enough to impress William Shakespeare, so he must be good at that one too – the playwright had people like Ben to compare him to. He grinned wryly and said nothing. He would reserve judgment on that until he'd seen him on a stage. Will still had a set of cue-scripts from
"You're getting married, Miss Devine?" Sherlock interrupted, raising an interested eyebrow.
Sherlock stares at him. The slight, contented smile left over from their shared laughter grows until it dominates his angular face. "John Watson," he says quietly. "You are… an enigma."
The man's face snapped back to his; too quickly, for Sherlock closed his eyes and breathed deeply for a moment to recover from the disturbance in his head that the movement would have created. "
had always been his hero. "That was… brilliant. I don't think I could have summed
"Members-only BDSM bar, we know," Sherlock cut off, though Lestrade probably didn't know. If she didn't come back inside after being beaten, Eliza wouldn't have picked her out from the other small blonde women she'd mentioned. He sat up properly in his chair, subtly taking control of the interview from Lestrade. "Where were you when you heard about Stewart and Charles?"
John gaped for the barest of seconds; before he had a chance to say anything Sherlock had wrapped him in a tight hug, still chuckling vaguely into his shoulder. "John, I am well enough versed in the theory of emotion, but I had never experienced it first-hand until I met you. Now I've spent enough time around you and Molly to know jealousy, and I
, really - standing on stage before him was barely anything at all of the great detective.
Jim looked away. "Oh. That's what you did, isn't it? You said something about his father, that's why he doesn't like you." The corner of the Irish boy's thin, dark lips twitched upwards gently.
, Sherlock," John said indignantly, his mind still reeling. "It's just… I…" Without allowing himself to think too much about the action, he stepped forwards and pulled the younger trainee into a tight hug. Sherlock froze, his shoulders tensing, but just as John was about to pull away and apologise he suddenly relaxed and leaned into the embrace, his arms wrapping around John's shoulderblades. John just stopped himself from shivering at the feeling of a strong, proud nose sliding down his neck as Sherlock buried his face in John's shoulder. "You're just so incredible, I can't believe people can treat you like that. You're brilliant, and you're funny, and you've helped me so much tonight, and of all the careers you could have chosen with all your brains you want to be an
The grip on his chin became painful. Sherlock squirmed uncomfortably underneath him as John gave him one last squeeze and then let go. "Now – I don't think Trent was generous enough to use his mouth on his submissives, but to have any kind of reputation he probably used his fingers." Sherlock quickly grabbed onto the railing that he had been tied to yesterday as John knelt up slightly and slid his hand up the inside of Sherlock's thigh.
It takes almost half an hour of tea, biscuits and idle conversation about things John doesn't understand – and an ornamental letter-opener, which Sherlock turns his nose up at on the pretext that he operates through email – before Trelawney-Hope, Mycroft and the few other people who wanted to meet
Lestrade nodded; Sherlock abandoned all pretence of subtlety and stood on his toes to try and see beyond him. "I'm afraid I do have to insist, Reverend," the Constable said, still with that dangerous steely note to his voice. "If you won't allow us to search your home freely we can come back with an official order."
Lestrade met them on the steps of the Abbey Grange, Sally Donovan looking grumpy with crossed arms beside him. Sherlock waved the two of them away as they attempted to greet him. "Yes, yes," he said shortly. "What did you find?"
He broke off with a surprised gasp as John surged forwards, their closed mouths bumping painfully together, John's body marshalling his own backwards until the small of his back hit the lip of the kitchen counter. He was momentarily surrounded by John's breath, warm and close, as the doctor's hands held him firmly around the waist and his closed mouth pressed insistently against Sherlock's, demanding and controlling. Sherlock made a helpless noise, feeling his face flush red as soon as the sound escaped. It was just as he had always imagined kissing John would be like, in the rare quiet moments when he had allowed himself to imagine: unrelenting, focused, commanding. It was lucky the kitchen counter was holding him up, because his knees had buckled, and they were only bumping their faces together like teenagers.

Sherlock was silent for a long moment, his inscrutable eyes following Molly's movements. Then he said quietly,
Peters did not open the door to them any further, instead shifting on his feet to lean against the doorframe and wedge his face more tightly into the gap. Sherlock smiled politely. "May we come in?" he asked, his voice sickly sweet.

need to kiss in this scene. Kemp snorted, but didn't comment further, instead grabbing his scene partner and dragging him onstage to start the scene. John and Sherlock watched from the scene door until their cue, Sherlock's breath pillowing comfortably against John's neck.
Bill scoffed as she ran a hand through her fringe and moved off. "Yeah, lovely talking to you, too, sweetheart," he bit back as she weaved through the tables. She laughed as she turned back.
The safe is full of so many papers and manila files and photographs he can't help but gasp. It looks like it should be a source of wonder for archaeologists and historians, a vault of information such as this. But John, of all people, recognises the need to keep secrets. Sherlock begins to flick his long fingers over files and notebooks, scanning for a hint of the royal family. John, in turn, begins to flick his eyes over the frown of concentration on that beautiful face, the tiny furrow between his light eyebrows.
He had a slight suspicion as to where they might be heading, but he was still a little surprised when Sherlock spun himself to a stop in front of the room that John had had to drag himself away from. His breath caught a little from the memories of what had been inside it, and anticipation of why his friend might be bringing him back here. Sherlock turned to him and took a shaky breath in.
"Oh, Mr Holmes! Do you really think James is innocent?"
As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her,
Despite the huge amount of faith that John holds in Sherlock's opinion, he has to agree that the evidence against James McCarthy in this case is extremely conclusive. If it goes to trial, the man doesn't have a chance; eyewitnesses
Sherlock took a deep breath.
It's incredible how quickly Sherlock can go from bouncing on the balls of his feet with excitement about a case to shouting 'boring!' at the officers in charge.
His friend hesitated for a moment. Then, to John's relief, he smiled. "
The screaming peaked, so loud and intrusive that John worried their eardrums would pop and he held Sherlock tighter to block out the pain of it: then, quite suddenly and without warning, everything stopped.
Sherlock's assertion that Celia's frustration throughout the play was due to her longing for Orlando gave John pause; he frowned at his friend. "I've always thought Celia was in love with Rosalind," he suggested. "That she was jealous of the attention that her best friend was suddenly paying to someone else."
He couldn't help but snort. "And you don't think the situation is a little different? No-one's told John I'm not dead."
look and bends back over the body. "Well, he does
Sherlock's lips twisted into a wry smile, like he was thinking exactly the same thing. John couldn't help but laugh. "All right," he said, leaning forwards quickly for another kiss. "I don't really - I've never melded with anyone before, I don't know how to break it. What do I do?"
. You are morally implacable, my dear, and most of the time I love you for it.
"You're all right, though, John?" he asked, struggling for a moment to sit up and then giving up and falling back. Molly yanked the stat monitor around to examine it; John nodded in answer to the question. "T'Penya," the half-Vulcan said, looking around until he lighted on the younger officer and gave her a rare warm smile. "You did brilliantly."
"So, is this what you have to deal with all the time, then?" Julien asked idly, trying to move his lips as little as possible so as to avoid Gibbon's eye.

John sighed and turned away, adjusting his trousers as he tried to calm himself down. He had to
John growled in frustration; Sherlock looked up from hooking off his socks to see the doctor bent over with his trousers stuck around his thighs. "Here," he said quickly, moving over to help. John straightened, and Sherlock stopped dead at the sight of him, his scarlet y-fronts stretched over the head of his prick where he had attempted to pull them down. An audible swallow alerted him to the fact that John was staring at the damp spot on the front of Sherlock's own briefs. He smirked coolly, placing a coquettish hand on one hipbone and making John laugh. The doctor took enough of a breath in to calmly pull his fly open the rest of the way and step out of his trousers. They looked at each other for a heartbeat before hooking their thumbs in the waistbands of their pants and simultaneously pulling them down and off.
he observed in amusement.
He comes back with water and a few ibuprofen he'd found in a first-aid kit in the kitchenette to find that his friend has rested his head on the table, looking thoroughly ill. John wonders how hard it had been for him to hold his discomfort in through the rest of the morning. He rouses him by stroking his curls tenderly back from his face. Sherlock groans. "Here," John whispers, shifting the hand traversing through dark curls to rub gently at his temple. "Take these."
Once the Lady and her maid had swept from the room, the detective let out an almighty sigh. Lestrade frowned at him. "So," he said cheerfully, slapping Sherlock companionably on the arm. "Pretty clear, don't you think? We'd assumed the Randall gang had left England, but if they haven't we'll catch them. We have military posted everywhere looking for them."
"It's beautiful," John agreed, though he didn't mean the language. Sherlock's voice seemed to flow through him like climbing into a hot bath.
Sherlock shrugs happily. "Oh, I have a rival who's eager to step into my place with her," he dismisses. John suppresses a giggle at the thought of Sherlock's most prominent rival.
"I would probably have asphyxiated by now," John rasped finally, dropping his hands.
Sherlock made another impatient noise. "He had a fit underwater. That suggests poison. Could have been transmitted through touch, administered when he tied the laces on his shoes."

somehow that he didn't rape me."
John's footsteps came damnably closer to the bed; Sherlock panicked, scrambling for his wand to release the Silencing charm, yanking the sheets out from underneath his body to try and cover himself, but it was too late.
Sherlock drew in a deep breath through his nose, apparently savouring the smell of the long grass and horse manure around them. "We'll have to find him," he said briskly. "If it turns out that he

John certainly hadn't seen better from these players, at any rate - as Demetrius and Lysander began their back-and-forth, ignoring Helena's cries of protest from between them, they actually took hold of the young actor and began bodily pulling their Helena towards each of them in turn, both stepping closer to her when Hermia entered to protest Lysander's abandonment of her. John and Ben watched them somewhat proudly, gradually inflating their own body language in their caricature of Oberon's fury and Puck's guilty enjoyment until all four lovers chased each other from the stage.
"You were wonderful in the play this afternoon, Master Watson," the doxy lilted, leaning still further towards him across the table. "I

Molly pressed.

He looked up slowly to find that everyone was staring at him. "That's… how come we never noticed that?" Matt asked, looking at John, who shrugged. Carl walked with a bit of a swagger that could suggest physical tenderness, sure, but John had always just put it down to arrogance.

He was about to say so when Madam Benoit, his somewhat matronly secretary, rapped on the door and entered without waiting for a response. "Monsieur de Richelieu?"

John grinned in delight. "I would love to," he agreed.
is on.
Captain Adler smiled at the younger woman, and for a moment John thought he saw a twinge of something familiar and intimate in her sharp eyes. Then Sherlock stirred, and everyone's attention was diverted to crowding around him as he opened his eyes. "John," he murmured.
John shuddered. He could only imagine the horror of stumbling over that body in the dark. When he glanced at Sherlock, however, the detective's mouth was still bent into the tiniest of smiles. "I dared not call out, but I searched the house for Mary, and she wasn't there. Someone else was in that house that night, Master Holmes - it was I who made the room look as though it had been burgled, but I didn't kill Lord Eustace, and I certainly wouldn't have harmed Mary."

It's not something you really plan for, is it? Falling in love with your – decidedly male, one might add – flatmate? It's not exactly high on the average Englishman's list of life goals, right after 'get a degree and a career' or 'almost get shot in Afghanistan'.
"Sh…Sherlock?" he asks, sitting up. He can hear the detective's panting breaths, but Sherlock's only response is to rock back until he's sitting in a foetal position against the end of the bed with his hands tugging at his hair.
had been the first play he had seen when he first returned from the war; he could still remember standing in the audience, spellbound by the young Puck and the knowledge that William Shakespeare had created all of this from the thin air everyone had always assumed lay between his ears.
Surprised, John looked at Sherlock, who acknowledged his surprise with a glance as he leaned forwards to rest his chin on his steepled fingertips. He watched the sailor fidget for a moment before gesturing towards the empty chair with one hand. "Take a seat, Captain Crocker," he said airily. "Tell us everything from the beginning. Watson and I may interrupt as we see fit."
A shudder of arousal racked Sherlock's body, making his hand tighten on John's cock and squeezing a moan out of John. "
So John had contacted the bridge, and the Captain had put her First Officer in command of a landing party.
"But you digress," Sherlock interrupted.

Sherlock frowned. He still wasn't sure he wanted a
The side-door opens and a short, too-thin man peers around it before stepping into the room. John watches as Sherlock's lips quirk into a smile. "
John laughed. "We'd best get onto that, then," he said happily, dropping Sherlock's hand in order to wind an arm around his hip inside his coat. Sherlock copied the gesture, dropping a kiss onto the top of John's head. "It sounds important."
Sherlock shifted over to the next computer terminal and tapped it into life. "That sonic thing, Doctor," he asked, bringing up the password screen. "Does it only work for you?"
The race was a close one; all five swimmers moved with a speed and ease of movement John could barely comprehend. When they were about two-thirds down the pool, John actually stood up, cheering Sophie on at the top of his lungs, and he let out a monstrous whoop as she touched the end of the pool with delicate fingers a hand's width before the others. She surfaced grinning, her eyes searching him out immediately and laughing when she saw him, waving thumbs-up wildly in her direction. Bill laughed again.
made them forget that all afternoon. John liked Ben, liked playing with him - it almost made his own co-star's ineptitude bearable.
She lifted her hand and blew him a kiss. Bill wolf-whistled; John found himself grinning helplessly back at her as she slid into the pool with a fluid sort of grace that he completely envied. Jim shimmied across to Bill's lap looking disgruntled as John started up an anxious tapping of his foot. A balding teacher stepped forward and let out a sharp blast from some kind of horn, and they were off; Sophia's green swimsuit soared under the surface of the water, wriggling like a fish. He'd never really appreciated the beauty of a swimmer before, but then, he supposed, he'd never been emotionally invested in one like this before.
"To the army," Jack Saunders continues, his voice a drunken slur. "Fucking with people's sexuality for centuries."
John smirks harder, taking a few steps backwards in order to catch the detective's eyes as he chuckles. "It already has."
he finished quietly, making the tiniest of bows to John before moving back towards the front of the stage. John almost didn't catch his parting aside.
He bid farewell to his friend on the corner of the street and made his way slowly and unevenly towards his tiny flat. It was rubbish, but on an army pension and the few, insignificant spoils to be gained from acting it was all he could afford, and he'd been there for longer than he cared to mention.
(See the end of the chapter for
He pulled out the photographs of the first two murders and the one he had stolen from Stephens' bedside table. "Stewart Montgomery was murdered on Monday night," he said, laying the photo of his driver's license and that of his dead body stretched out on his bed side-by-side on the bar. "Charles Trent on Wednesday night," he repeated the process with Trent's photographs, "and Vincent Stephens this morning. Did you know any of these men through the Ball and Chain?"
"That coffin," Sherlock continued, throwing on his clothes in a decidedly haphazard manner. "Did you notice anything unusual about it?"
In reply, John let go of his hips in order to pull his head down into a harsh kiss. It was immediately obvious that he was in control of the kiss, and that he would not be letting it go. Sherlock relaxed into it, forcing himself back into the killer's persona and not allowing himself to imagine a life where John settled all their arguments with rough sex. He shuddered, pressing his body closer but not daring to move his hands, fluttering them uselessly by his sides until John grabbed one and wrapped it around his waist, replacing his own hand on Sherlock's buttock. They were still moving gently with the music as they kissed, and the movements created a tiny friction of their groins against each other's bodies until what they were doing wouldn't be considered appropriate dance-floor behaviour anywhere Sherlock had ever been. John didn't seem to notice.
The Constable sighed heavily. "Then there's no way to get back into that house quickly," he said firmly.
Sherlock whimpered.
He hung up on Lestrade's snort, already riffling through his drawers for a clean pair of pants and trousers; he grabbed a shirt on his way out of his bedroom door, still flinging it over his shoulders as he stopped to click the kettle on. He was about to shout up the stairs for John when he remembered Mrs Hudson's reprimand the last time he woke her before eight a.m., and clambered up the stairs two at a time instead.
"It's the twenty-second," Jim supplied more helpfully, not looking up from the blackboard.
He hoped it wouldn't come to that - John knew that his friend would try his hardest not to hurt Tobias, but if everything else failed, he knew Will would be forced to mention how shabby the boy's work had become, and possibly threaten him with being replaced. He tried to shrug the matter off. "So, Molly," he said in as light a tone as he could, "I notice Sherlock stuck around. He's been around
John watched the boy closely as he stepped out onto the bare stage, smiling slightly to himself. This afternoon's performance had been a bit of a shambles, but Ben, the boy standing quietly on stage and surveying his audience, could make them forget that.
I pull myself together and sit up. "I apologise," I say, standing up to find a tissue for my streaming nose. She pushes me back down and brings the box over herself.
Molly actually jumped in excitement when they both stepped onto the stage. "You're joining us?" he guessed brightly. "Everything's all right, then? I thought perhaps it was bad news, the missing women you two are looking for…"
The nod here is to Raj, for the well-remembered dinners back at uni hall.
from James. John closed his eyes, trying to clear his mind and focus on his study, until he felt himself starting to drift off to sleep and cursed to himself. Living with James had its ups and downs: playing Gobstones until one in the morning was not a particularly tactical move in the week leading up to an exam.
"I'm sure he'd be thrilled," John agreed. "I left him in a hurry this morning, he might be worried."
John stared at him until he shrank back slightly in his seat. "I think I'll be confiscating that," he said firmly. The redhead mock-deflated.
He leaves the pub a little over an hour and two further beers later with a slight wobble in his walk. He's not
things with the flood of information I pick up out of that.
Finally, John felt his stomach plummet. "You don't think -"
"Perhaps I mistook the purpose of our relationship?" Julien questioned coolly, tucking his feet underneath him. "I had thought that we were simply experimenting. I assumed that this meant we would have to practise elsewhere, to ensure the results were not simply fluke."
I wrote this in about an hour during an exceptionally dull Statistics lecture. Please don't expect genius.
Sherlock slid his bottom down the windowsill until his legs fell off the edge. "Then let's not get caught," he pleaded. The blond opened his mouth to reply, but Sherlock knew exactly what he wanted to say. "It

Will Kemp cleared his throat obnoxiously from behind them, and John almost laughed at the picture they might make; he seated, his neck craned to see the younger man stood so close behind him John could feel the heat from his body, arms thrown wide as though struck by lightning.

called from the stage and remembered he was due back on. He scrambled to remember his cue instead, shooting the detective an apologetic smile as he swaggered back on stage.
Tom was nodding as she talked, watching her with an odd mixture of affection and residual disapproval. "We were approached by the police when we first opened about the potential for abuse involved in encouraging BDSM, but we've always had very thorough abuse procedures; if we have reason to think someone's being abused we investigate, intervene if we can, hand it over to the police if necessary. Actual visible bruises would be reported to the police straightaway. Why are you looking for someone that bruised? Surely if they've gone into hiding because of their abuse they'd be better off staying there?"
"I didn't know," the playwright said thoughtfully. "I can't say I'm surprised, though. He's very astute."
And then Sherlock's hand wrapped itself confidently around him, and John's head rolled forwards of its own volition to smack into the detective's shoulder. Sherlock chuckled, and in retaliation John reached his own hand down and pressed his palm against the other man's long erection, drawing a long groan from somewhere in the depths of Sherlock's chest.

, she was
"If we hurry we'll make it while they're still holding him at the scene," Sherlock replies, yanking open the door. John looks forlornly at the two plates of pasta for a moment before following him.
Sherlock continues to glare at him, not looking at the table. "Coffee," he accepts briskly.
John shook his head. "Not for a day or two," he said. "She won't be able to tell you anything until she has recovered a little." He paused for a moment, staring at Lestrade. "Surely this is enough evidence to arrest Peters, though, Constable?" he prompted.
Sherlock shifted uncomfortably.
The consulting detective's eyes are the only thing that moves, flicking up to John's face. He tries a tentative step forwards, and still Sherlock doesn't respond. The only other time he's seen his friend this exposed, this broken, was in Dartmoor after the detective had just had his first encounter with Project H.O.U.N.D.
At the end of this particular corridor was a spiral staircase winding slowly upwards, and a corresponding hole in the flagstone floor where it descended. John stared downwards; something underground down that staircase was clanking ominously, like the chains in Old Earth dungeons, and he thought he could hear the faint strains of high-pitched, maniacal laughter. For a moment he thought about going down there, to see what Sherlock kept in the dungeons of his mind, but he knew that there was no way the Vulcan was hiding in there to keep himself safe, so he made himself climb upwards instead.
He was dressed in the same striking style as the past few days, impeccably fashionable but just different enough from what other well-off people were wearing currently to attract attention, his black coat billowing slightly in the icy breeze, tapping a roll of cue-scripts against one gloved hand. "Good morning, John," he greeted him calmly, as though they had arranged to meet and John ought to have been expecting him.
I did. She's a naturally dominant person, I'm sure you noticed that. It's why I wanted to be friends with her all those years ago. I love her more than anything else in the world. But she was always so disgusted when we talked about BDSM that I didn't think I could mention it to her."
"You've no idea," Mike replied airily. Sherlock, recovering himself from the search for the memory that seemed to be right on the tip of his tongue, busied himself hastily in the experiment, picking up the dropper again.
of triumph and tucking them into his pocket. "I said I'd meet Molly before ten, I should have left already."
Sherlock trips again, yanking on John's shirt-collar. John tells himself yet again that he
