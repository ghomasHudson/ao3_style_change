"Did your dad know about you growing up, the way he knew about Gabriel?"
He planned on addressing this with Dean after Cas said his final goodbyes so that he could be there in whatever way his brother might need him. He was critically aware that this may be the last happy meal that he would ever have with his family.
Cas held his breath, willing the tears away.
“I fixed you,” Cas murmured. “Everything will be ok now. The demon is gone.”
Gabriel peeled himself off the bed and threw the pillow back at Cas. Cas braced for impact and caught it, his eye twitching slightly before a small smile played on his lips.
"Already?" Cas raised his eyebrows in surprise.
Cas couldn’t lie - he had eaten a peanut butter and grape jelly sandwich in the car, but he thought he had been careful not to leave any evidence.
“I...heard Dean praying for me to come back. I thought this was the right decision. Did I...do something wrong?”
He had just met the man and yet whenever he looked at him, he could barely form a coherent thought. And it wasn't just the way he looked. He looked like a demigod, sure, but the closer he got physically to Dean, right down to the shoulder squeeze in the car, the safer Cas felt. The shoulder touching moment almost had him crawling across the car to run his thumb over Dean's bottom lip...stare into those eyes...kiss his soft, perfect mouth. He wanted to bury his face in Dean's neck. Breathe him in. Find himself wrapped in those arms. Those safe arms.
Dean thought, feeling panic rise in his throat.
"Dean! I'm so happy you've met Castiel! I had hoped that perhaps he could offer you some advice on your sketches. Have you already exchanged formalities?"
“Hey...Cas? Earth to Cas?”
Sam’s voice got quieter with each word until he was whispering, and when Dean finally looked up at him through hooded eyes, he just nodded and smiled at his younger brother. Sam gave a small smile back before disappearing out the front door, leaving Dean alone with his thoughts.
"It's going to be fine, Cas. Everything is going to be fine."
Raph glared at them. Cas made himself as small as possible in the passenger seat, averting his eyes to the ground. His stomach dropped when Gabriel opened his door, forcing Raphael to jump out of the way.
“Give me a few minutes.” Dean sauntered down the driveway, and Castiel felt awkward - should he follow him? He settled on sitting in the middle of the empty driveway. He took off his tan trench coat and folded it underneath him so he was more comfortable and loosened his tie - something he did out of nervous habit.
Silence.
"Yeah. I’m sorry Cas. I really am."
“You’re here now.”
"I'm here for you, Gabriel. Just like you've been here for me. Let's just get through this, OK? Then we can go home."
"It's complicated."
"And?"
Sam backed away from the bathroom door lightning fast, making a face and sprinting back to the living room to recover. They did it.
"Cas, I'm praying to God you've finally met -"
“So - tell me why your day was so shitty?” Cas asked, as he made his way to the table and sat down.
“Dean hates it when I can hear his thoughts...see his dreams. I thought this was a better way to come back. I wanted to make it...fair. We’ve been through quite a lot recently.”
“Who hates you?”
“I know you’re watching me, Sammy.”
Another knock on the door and Charlie’s head appeared. “Are you ready, Sam?” Her sweet smile made them both feel at ease. Charlie was practically a sister, and having her doing the ceremony for Sam and Eileen today was a testament to how much they loved and appreciated her.
Lisa loved the hope she saw in Dean's eyes.
"Yes. Let's."
"Yeah. I think you should", Sam said matter of factly. "But...why did you wait until now to tell him that you aren't staying?"
"I'm sorry," Cas said quietly, and set Dean's sandwich on the table before taking his own back to his bedroom and shutting the door, knowing he couldn't sit at the table with Dean without making things worse. It was amazing how quickly the mood in a room could change. Being human was exhausting sometimes. He ate his sandwich with a feeling of shame replacing the butterflies in his stomach, and decided to try and talk to Dean again when he finished up. He just needed a minute to collect himself and figure out what to say.
"I fixed a few extra things today while she was in the shop. She should run pretty good now."
Tearing himself away took every last bit of strength he had left and he had to kneel to catch his breath, eyes closed, steadying his mind.
She stopped abruptly, as though she was about to say too much.
"Sorry." Gabriel smiled and focused on the road, leaving Cas to his thoughts.
Finally he broke the silence, after he was sure Raphael wasn't going to attack him.
Cas nodded appreciatively and held his glass up.
“Hello, Dean.” Her voice was soft and light.
Gabriel studied his brother's face, watching the blush creep up from his neck to his ears. He couldn't help but smirk. This was the best news he may have ever heard in his life.
Listened to yesterday
"I want to go home."
When Dean returned, everything was spread out thoughtfully, all the way down to a plate in the middle of the serving tray with 2 fortune cookies on it.
“Dean, grow up. And you need to work on your...your…” Lisa grabbed at the air as though she was looking for the right word.
"I keep thinking about this morning, Cas. About you."
Two more days passed where Dean could not leave his chambers. He requested only Sam to change the dressings in order to maintain his secret, although it looked as though the scars from his burns may end up being permanent, and many of them weren’t healing as quickly as Sam would have liked. He was growing frustrated.
Ultimately, it was a relief for both of them to end it, but that didn’t make it easy. They both loved Ben. And they loved each other, too, but staying together wasn't the answer. They both needed more than companionship and they knew it.
I don't want to be the one to say it's wrong
"It's Cas."
He left it at that, not wanting to put too much delicate information into a voicemail message. Then he decided to lay down himself.
Dean seemed to forget all about breakfast as he watched Cas wander over and take the chair next to him.
"That's nice, Ben. I'm sure he will love whatever you make for him."
Once at the party on this particular day, he found himself alone in one of the galleries with a glass of sherry, mulling over the various paintings in the large, heavily perfumed corridor. The velvet draperies on the doors and windows rustled subtly in the summer breeze that blew in from the terrace behind him, swirling thick, warm air in to the room. It was a hot day, and he felt stifled in his formal attire, and unable to concentrate sincerely on the works due to his discomfort. In knowing that he was alone, he felt no remorse at removing his cravat and overcoat, rolling up the sleeves of his white linen shirt, and loosening his waistcoat with a private sigh of relief. He cast his discarded clothing items along the baseboard of the vast room, and immediately felt drawn to one of the pieces in the gallery as his focus returned.
He glanced at Hannah with a small side smile, hoping he wasn't scaring her away. She looked back thoughtfully at him. She had kind eyes. Dean decided he liked her.
Dean liked to think he saw Castiel flush red for a moment after his comment, but it could have just been the heat in the room and the glow from the soft lighting that surrounded them.
“It doesn’t Sam, ok? Can we drop this? I had a long day.”
She had thought about Dean's proposal 135 times at least on the airplane there and back. He had looked so hopeful when he asked her to marry him, but somehow simultaneously defeated and terrified. It had felt like it was what he wanted, but also not what he wanted at all. She knew that deep down it would never feel quite right, so she let him go.
"Time for some music", he said, and a smile played in the corner of his mouth as he winked at Cas.
His heart sank when he was finally ready to leave work and saw the time...it was two hours past when he was supposed to have called Balthazar with details about their date. Being a doctor made his personal life hard sometimes. He picked up the phone, hoping his boyfriend hadn't given up on him yet.
"Friends", Cas said from across the board.
All these words I don't just say
“It’s...my dad. He’s dead. He had a heart attack this morning and he didn't make it.”
He tried not to get too melty about it, but then Cas appeared, and Dean blinked rapidly at the sight: hair an absolute disaster, tight sweatpants riding low on his hips, white dress shirt on,  but open...
"I want to live here. With you. If you'll still have me. I don't deserve you, but I can't live without you, either."
“No, I don’t think so. It just happened - you have to process this in your own way. And your situation is different, too. You don’t have a relationship with him anymore.”
"Oh, we're enjoying it", Dean retorted.
“Sammy?” Sam returned to the present as Dean wandered into the kitchen. He tried to shove the memory of what he had heard from the bathroom somewhere far away.
Cas was taken aback by the continued kindness that Dean was showing a complete stranger.
"Yeah?"
“Battle angels.” It was a statement, not a question. Dean couldn’t believe what he was hearing. Or how to handle it. It was all too unreal. Angels? Hanging out in London to fight demons? It sounded like something from his drawings.
He couldn’t take it anymore; he rose up from his seat on the ground and entered Dean’s room, shaky and unsure. The tears had started to fall. Fear had overtaken every corner of his mind. But something propelled him forward, and he found himself sitting on the edge of the bed, staring at his hunter, brushing his damp hair back from his face as he slept. Cas had never wanted to be able to enter a dream so badly in his life. He thought he knew, based on the words that Dean muttered, what he was dreaming about. He touched the black cord around his neck, considering it...should he re-activate his grace? It hadn’t even been a day. He decided against it. Instead, he threaded his hand gently through Dean’s, and slid down softly behind him. He, too, fell asleep almost immediately in a fleeting moment of contentment that allowed him to relax.
It was Jack who answered.
He could sense that Dean was watching him intently, and he was startled when he suddenly felt a soft hand on his shoulder. He glanced up, not able to hide the surprise he felt by the gesture. It had been so long since anyone had touched him with any sort of affection, and it felt good. He absorbed the warmth of the touch desperately, bringing his hand up to rest on top of Dean’s.
"Sam? What happened?"
Sam didn't try and hold the tears back any longer. He let them fall, hands folded tightly on the table. Of course this piece of information changed things a little. Or a lot. And he didn't know where to start.
"No, I've got him. I'm a doctor though, if he does end up needing medical attention. This happens...a lot." Gabriel gave the officer a sullen nod before escorting his little brother out to the car, where he sat him in the passenger seat.
You taught me the courage of stars before you left.
"I wish Castiel had come into your life earlier," he added. “All of this could have been over years ago.”
“What? How?”
"Yeah. It's why she left, actually. She said she couldn't do it anymore. She couldn't live the lie, even though she tried for so long."
That stare down was the last time Cas had ever seen his father. Or spoke to him.
“Yeah, I just always hope that one day you’ll realize it’s disgusting.” Cas wrinkled his nose at Dean's comment with feigned annoyance.
Once he was across the grass and hidden in the maze of pruned shrubbery and low hanging vines on the gallery property, Dean began to feel more himself again. The silence of the garden enveloped him and allowed him to gather his thoughts. He did wish he had another glass of sherry though. To drown himself in liquor would be most welcome in the moment.
"Get up!" He ordered. "It's almost eleven and I'm taking you on a surprise field trip today. No time to waste."
“...and what do you suppose they would say?” Dean asked with slight sarcasm.
“God, Sam, don't pity me, okay?” Dean still isn't looking at him.
In the bathroom, he splashes water on his face. Light glinting off the mirror catches his eye. Reflexively, Dean braces himself before he looks at his reflection.
Dean takes a deep breath. Yeah, this is about his luck. “So, I'm in Hell?” he asks, trying to sound calm.
Castiel instinctively folds skeletal, broken wings back behind shoulders, even though they're too big to be hidden that way. Jack watches, frowning with his head slightly tilted.
“No, wait, back up,” Dean says, holding his hand up. “You're fine with this? You find out I'm really your brother and everything is okay?”
Castiel stares at him. “I couldn't fly. Of course they were quite damaged.”
“There's an old barn a few miles down the road. A little more graffiti there won't make a difference to anybody,” Bobby says, still looking at the handprint.
“I didn't do anything!” Sam protests. “He just called me up yesterday, fresh out of the ground!”
Rowena rolls her eyes. “Obviously not. You'd be in Heaven with Castiel right now if he could. Or back on Earth. I'm sure your son would rather all his fathers were alive. Well, the three of them that count anyway.”
He has a dick now.
The man spreads his arms. “Seems like something worked.”
“Because God commanded it,” Castiel says. A difficult mission, accomplished well.
“When they want you to know, they'll tell you themselves,” Bobby says. “I ain't gonna out anybody.”
“It's a new initiative one of my demons pitched. There's some kind of television show with the same premise, they tell me.” She smiles. “Besides, what would Samuel say if I actually had you tortured?”
“Because Sam said the silver in his hair is from getting older and he didn't know if it would happen to me too. When I'm old,” Jack says.
The ringing starts, just like last time, high-pitched and piercing. It gets louder until Dean is clutching his ears. The mirror on the ceiling shatters, showering him with shards of broken glass. Dean hits the floor.
Dee shrugs. “At first, I didn't know what it was, didn't have the words. And Dad—you know how he was.”
“I thought those visions of yours stopped, Sam,” Bobby says, narrowing his eyes.
Dean's smile turns into a grin. “You're buying. Somehow, I don't have my wallet on me.”
, the radio sings. Dean can feel joy bubbling up inside of him but it's more distant now. It feels fake.
“What did you do to Bobby?” Sam asks. He drops to his knees to examine the fallen man.
Dean closes his eyes for a second. This kid. “Binders, Sam.”
“I was trying to hunt down Lilith, get a little payback.” Sam isn't meeting Dean's eye.
“Just... with his hand. The opposite of healing, I guess.” It's weird to think about Cas healing Dean and Sam right after doing that to their father.
“You too,” Sam says. He feels himself relax a little.
Sam sighs but he doesn't fight. “Dean, what happened?”
Bobby comes back then, carrying three opened bottles of beer. He hands one each to Sam and Dean casually, like nothing happened. It's starting to piss Dean off.
-----
Sam doesn't know how to answer that.
“I could do some digging,” Bobby is saying as Sam turns back around. “Not gonna be fast though. Most of these books don't have name indexes.”
Behind him, Dean hears Sam sigh. But he gets out of the car too and is right beside Dean when he knocks.
Dean shrugs Cas' hand off, turns away. He grabs the edge of the desk to pull himself to his feet. When he's standing, Dean can see the body.
“Meant what to happen?” Sam asks.
Dean stands. As he passes, Bobby lays his hand on Dean's shoulder. “You did everything you could.”
“Castiel.” Of course he knows this. The summoning was crude and clumsy but it included the correct name.
Cas tilts his head. Dean used to think it meant he was confused but Cas does it so often that Dean isn't sure anymore.
“What happened?”
“Good to hear,” Dean says. “Let's keep it that way.”
that question. Some things you can't have in real life.
“Come on, let's go into town and get you a shower. And, uh, some different clothes maybe,” Sam says, bending down to pick the knife back up. “You can borrow some of mine, if you want.”
“What are you, some kind of religious nut?” Dean asks.
Dean continues, “Asking Jack to
Guilt churns Dean's stomach. What did he ever do to deserve personal attention from an angel? Castiel isn't anything like his vague memories of angels from Mom's stories. She did always say angels were watching over Dean. The thought makes his skin crawl.
They have to figure out what this thing is. There's no avoiding it now: they have to go see Bobby and find out if he knows anything.
Castiel pulls a cell phone out of the coat. It won't turn on. The nearest payphone is in Lebanon's tiny grocery store, which is further away than the bunker and closed up right now anyway.
Dean cuts him off. “Hormones and surgery and oh so very much therapy. Where'd we get the money, let alone the
This was a mistake. Dean tries to sound like Sam. “Bobby?”
The window shatters, spraying glass everywhere. He scrambles out of the way. Above him, the light fixtures explode. The noise feels like it's trying to tear him apart. The other windows burst in quick succession.
The injustice of his words pushes through Dean's shock. “What? I've done
“No. Come on, Sammy. Even before all that Ruby shit when I was gone, Dad was...” Dean gestures, trying to find the words. “Like he was still fighting Yellow Eyes, even though we got him.” Dean sometimes wonders if that car accident a few years ago gave Dad some kind of brain damage. It was right before checking out of the hospital that Dad told Dean to kill Sam. They kept Sam being psychic a secret from Dad on purpose but he must've found out about that
Following, Castiel pats Jack's shoulder in passing, keeping purposefully neutral wings. Although Jack hasn't had much experience with proper wing expressions yet so the effort might be wasted this time.
“I don't know about that. You're both the same kind of stubborn when you think you're right about something.”
“Why didn't
Before the demon can speak again, Sam is closing the distance between them, Ruby's knife in his hand.
“You think you're the only trans hunter I know?” Bobby asks.
“Dean, there's other options than just tackling the thing head-on,” Sam argues.
When he moves, Dean can feel something on his left shoulder. Might be a bruise from digging himself out of his grave. He rolls up his sleeve.
Their silence lingers, the sun setting on the horizon a good enough excuse to end what had been an afternoon of companionable conversation.
He’s not sure if Anna genuinely wants to come with him, but perhaps what she sees in Sam is too questionable, compared to the essence of a fellow angel. They’re nearly ready to leave, route planned out, when Bobby’s phone rings. It’s one of many, Castiel notes, sitting on various tables, presumably with various numbers and aliases behind it.
“Thanks, genius. Really pulled the rose-colored glasses off my eyes with that one.”
“Another text. I know it’s a shapeshifter, but looking at the possible crimes they’ve committed, it might be a family of them. What about you?”
Dean swore.
car - are things he can’t grasp.
“I do.”
"I don't have one," Cas says. The growing fire plays across his face, going between orange-red and shadow. "Do you remember that time I called you?"
“I definitely made up the cricket rules. I don’t think that motel should’ve been able to get the BBC.”
Denise went to UCLA. Which meant that she probably wasn’t sneaking back to her home town on a whim to help Heather and Cheryl do… whatever it is that they wanted to do.
Cas brings it up next time, a month later. Dean is stuck over Cas’s prone form, the guy knocked unconscious by a vicious shapeshifter wearing Cas’s face. It’s weird to see it all twisted up like that, micro-expressions turning his placid, content face into one of contempt.
“I just do,” he chokes out.
"We should go to a Cub's game," Dean says. He realizes that all the things he and Cas are doing are Cas's first time - or as good as, if he can't remember anything.
“Most of my blood is not anywhere near my brain right now, Cas.”
“Yeah well, he made his choice. Whatever makes him happy, I guess.” It’s warm, but Dean’s still wearing the too-big leather jacket Cas always sees him in. He hunkers down into the clothing, watching the students. Cas looks out and wonders if any of them in particular resemble Dean’s brother. “It’s his birthday next week.”

Lastly idk why but I have literally no memory of any destiel fics I read back in 2012 so I've been plagued by rec lists of long fics that I have definitely not read but I DID read a fic last year where Cas worked at a toll booth it was cute and I thought of it when I was writing that one scene.
is the thing. No family, no friends, nothing before that motel room in 2003. Dean can’t decide if that makes it better or worse, what they’re doing. If one day Cas is going to realize he’s been cheating on someone who’s been worried sick about him. Sometimes Dean wonders if maybe Cas will never find out what happened before.
“Really now?” Castiel strides towards him and moves the limp body with his shoe, as though for all the dirt and grime - physical and spiritual - he’s sauntered through, touching a dead demon shell with his bare hands is beyond the pale. “I suppose I ought to say something against the enjoyment of revenge that you’re so clearly getting.”
Thanks again to Atlas Obscura for the Coyote Buttes Ravine and the Havasu Falls - I can't remember if seeing the Grand Canyon was Dean's dream or a thing both Sam *and* Dean wanted to do, but the freaking SPN writers also forgot and wrote in that they saw it anyway so I guess it doesn't matter lol.
Lucifer tilts his head to one side, and it’s so like Cas Dean feels his chest constrict. “That’s true.”
“The angels.” He looks at the ceiling. “They’re coming for
Can monsters even do long cons?
Dean swallows. Nods, though his dad doesn’t see it. He leaves the motel room, puts his bag in the car. There’s no other car in the parking lot aside from his dad’s.
“What made you decide to leave?”
Also thank you all so much for the car suggestions for Cas! I went with a Honda Civic because a hatchback isn't conducive to hiding hunting paraphernalia, the Honda Civic apparently is pretty spacious for a coupe, and it was just nerdy looking enough without being too cool or too nerdy. But whatever car you want Cas to drive, I'd say just imagine that's what he gets when the Honda unexpectedly konks out a decade from now or something lmao.
The form that is not human, is not kind, is perhaps not really even Dean Winchester anymore, smiles at him. Bone and blood. “Okay Castiel. I’m listening.”
I know we were all hype over Bobby - I promise he'll be back next chapter, but instead you get a Cas & Pamela sleepover where they talk about boys and try to predict the future - SPN God/Chuck is OUT. It's all about the nebulous forces of the universe, babeyy.
Dean chews on his lip.
“I read,” Cas says, either not picking up at the tense atmosphere or ignoring it.
“You really think Michael would want me now? I don’t think even with the extra credit of letting him use me like a sock puppet I’d be able to graduate to upstairs. So why should I let heaven win?” Lucifer just smiles at him, but it's like how primates smile - all aggression, a warning before a bloody, painful death.
He sees a phone on the bedside table. He takes it off the charger and flips it open. Thursday, April 10th, 2003. There's a message from an unknown number.
“You can go back to the motel, if you want. I can finish these.”
He's so, so tired. He closes his eyes, he thinks.
“College is only four years, Dean.”
He walks further into the field; Dean had figured there would be an entourage, an army. A few knights waiting in the wings. Instead it’s just them, some farmed-over, tawny stalks of wheat. There’s no sound of bids, no insects, no wind. Nothing but them.
“When this is all over,” Castiel says, finally, “wouldn’t you want to go back to how you were before?” That gets Dean’s attention. He looks at Castiel again, waltzing to where the angel is still sitting.
"Of course.”
Castiel regards Dean. The demonic essence swirling within, contained by the seal Castiel had made, then repaired, once Dean had broken it to save him. "Of course," he tells Dean, and the demon smiles, and his eyes crinkle at the corners, and he swipes a hand up to cup Castiel's jaw, the pad of his thumb against Castiel's cheekbone.
"So could you," Dean challenges, "or did you forget all about that cute 'boy king' nickname the demons like to throw around?" His brother chews on the inside of his cheek, and it may be Dean's imagination (it isn't), but the room seems to darken, the corners fading out as
“Eh, you know, running around in the woods, felt like a real Van Helsing.” His face must go into a grimace when he strips out of the flannel, because Cas sets his beer down and gets closer.
Still. He knew he and Cas hung out a lot. He didn't think it was
“Because it’s 2004? I like Dean, but he needs to update his music tastes.” Cas makes a note of interest and holds up an album. Beth’s eyebrows raise a tick. “Really?”
“I got the name Emmanuel Allen. Drives an old Lincoln, about my age, dark hair, light eyes. He and I ended up working the same case with a poltergeist a few months back. He said he was new to the whole thing.”
She is, however, not stupid.
"Leave me the fuck
The Vetala
in the player and music starts rolling in. “She’s weird, but in a good way, you know? Experimental, and not as angry-sounding as Alanis Morrissette, so you can actually chill out and listen to her.” Cas agrees. “Okay, now that we have
“Like Denise? Like mom and dad?”
“Whatever. We salted, we burned, case closed.” He mops his face with the hem of his shirt and takes it off when he smells the grave dirt and fire that clings to the fabric. “What now?”
Cassie doesn’t mention Cas and they keep going out. Dean isn’t sure what, exactly, Cas is still doing in Columbus. He figured out the shapeshifter thing a few weeks ago, and even John seems to be thinking they should be moving on soon. Cas doesn’t mention any hunts, and Dean doesn’t bring them up either. They talk about movies, and the strange music collection Cas is amassing for his car that Dean can’t listen to for more than about twenty minutes. They meet up for drinks or he'll pair him up with one of Cassie's friends so the four of them can go out or they'll just sit on the quad and watch the students pass by.
down the road. And then with this monster or - whatever it is. Every family we talked to said the victims were hearing things before they died, and some of them had to just go to that institute.”
“I’ve only listened to her second album, but I liked it a lot.”
"That's it?"
“We thought you had died, Castiel,” the angel finishes, “none of us could sense nor hear you.” Dean and Cas’s argument seems to have taken the wind out of its sails.
“I just wanted us to be sisters,” Heather pleads. “Not this - this fucked up, codependent bullshit! I had dreams! Denise and I were gonna -” She sobs. “Why do you have to ruin everything for me?”
“Fine. Better. Maybe you can even fly with them.”
“You’re losing blood,” Cas tells him. He pants, looking down at the crumbled remains of the male Vetala. He slashed at its counterpart that was holding him back so he could get to Cas, and her ashes are somewhere behind him. Maybe. Who knows. Who cares.
Castiel clears his throat pointedly, and Dean laughs, takes them down the road. Castiel isn’t sure if Anna will be safe forever, if Sam will heed his warnings. He isn’t sure if all of this isn’t one prolonged lost cause.
“I’d do it again,” Anna answers simply. “I’d rather that than be a perfect, unfeeling angel. I mean, no sex, no love.” She smiles. “No chocolate cake.”
“Dean, I don’t think -”
(See the end of the chapter for
Between one minute and the next he's trapped thinking about what he had to do to get food, pay rent, when John was gone too long. It's not the same thing at all. They're in a semi-decent motel, a local weather channel buzzing on low volume, the lamp by his head bathing the room in soft light. He remembers buzzing fluorescent lights, or the total darkness of spaces behind buildings where no one would find them. Cramped car benches, foreign smells.
They pour over old newspaper articles, scan different web forums and search about the town’s history. Dean’s eyelids feel like sandpaper. They even go back to interview some of the victims’ family members again. They find the same shit they found last time: absolutely nothing.
He wants to say something else, like how she knew this apparent thing that may or may not be true, if other people can tell. If
“Much has changed since you became human.”
He ends up staring at Cas as they eat and chat and drink and he wonders why Cassie would say that, and if she met anything by it, and why that even bothers
“Mhm,” Cas half says, half sighs. Then realizes what he admitted to. “Um.”
"It fucking means something and you fucking know it," Dean says, shoving his hands into his pockets. "What the fuck do you know about what we've been through? You know, family is all we got. I've never heard you talk about yours."
sidenote - does anyone here listen to fridged? those cohosts do not care for destiel or probably 9/10ths of the fandom in general but their reads on the spn eps are pretty funny and i do make a reference to something they say in their asylum ep in this chapter here :^)
“Damnit, Cas,
Cheryl's magic sends Dean flying against the wall, and he ducks into a crouch to recover. When he looks up, Heather is pointing the gun at her own temple, tears streaming down her face. “I don’t want this, Cheryl, please.”
“Come on, get some water in ya before you pass out.” He waves another bottle at Cas and starts walking towards him. Halfway through he stumbles over something, glances down. “Uh, Cas?”
Sioux Falls is less than two hundred miles from here.
“The main group that traveled to this town at the turn of the century were from England. It’s possible, but most ritualistic practices died out there centuries ago.”
As he shuts the door to the Impala, he finds himself hoping this wasn’t his last ride.
There’s not a lot of traffic out here - it’s just a two lane road people use to get from one town to another. The only thing around is a tiny dairy farm about a mile back that sells ice cream, and a fall fair that sets up two miles the opposite way. “I mean, maybe people wander down here, and whatever it is sticks to ‘em?” Dean pulls off the road and they get out.
“If that idiot just got absorbed into the pack…” Dean knew that’s how a lot of hunters went. Either they died fighting one of these monsters or they ended up getting turned, which was even worse. There was no way he was going after a pack on his own, but maybe he’d put some feelers out… He frowned. No, that was stupid. Guy either got smart enough to stay away until he had back up, or he was dead. Or a werewolf, in which case he’d be dead sooner or later.
Every time I write John I'm just like. Am I doing this right?? Ironically all my familial trauma stems from my older brother so believe me when I say I'm foaming at the mouth for some weird Sam and Dean emotional issues to come to the surface later in this story.
He’s done packing up and John’s still writing in his journal. “Dad?” he walks closer, but John slams the book shut before he can see what’s being written.
“That is not what the instructions say.” Dean turns from where he’s been buried in the wires of Cas’s dashboard for the past twenty minutes.
“You could call him.” Cas wonders, idly, when his own birthday is. When he reads through the paper for possible hunts, he sees horoscopes predicting how the week will go based on your sign. They’re not real, like other divining rituals, but he thinks they’re fun to look at, anyway. Maybe he’s a Sagittarius. “Or just send him a card.”
fall down and show a bit more skin than what’s already there, and she’s talking to him about whatever, and it’s making Cas’s mouth quirk up in a way that he only shows when Dean’s done something, said something, to get a reaction from him.
Cas just smells clean, like Dean's stuff and store brand laundry detergent. Cas is kissing him, hand stroking through his hair, down the back of his neck, no real pressure, he could break away if he wants to. Dean tries to relax into it, thinks he almost does, when the hand on his stomach goes to the front of his underwear. That's when he stills, abdomen clenching.
“Yes?” Cas says, voice going higher from the strain. Dean starts to smile, and it goes wide fast. He crooks his finger at Cas, gesturing to come even closer than where they are now, not even a foot apart.
"Bartholomew," Cas admits, quiet. Dean blinks, only remembering the conversation between them and the third angel after a moment of thinking.
“Yes, but -” Dean threads fingers through his hair, gripping it enough to pull Cas’s head back. He smiles. As if his angel needed any encouragement to look at him.
“Yes?”
Sam says, his hand out, blood dripping from his face, and Dean can sense the power behind those words even though they're not directed at him. It's most likely no more than a nudge to two archangels, but a nudge is all they need to be forced into the Cage, shoved deep inside before it all snaps shut again.
Dean’s tempted to roll his eyes. Did he get the plates. He rattles off the combination of letters and numbers and John says he’s gonna keep looking into it.
So! Big clue to what/who Cas really is... I don't title these chapters but sometimes I put in little notes on the headers so I know what is going on in each section. This section was just 'RIBS' in all caps lol. Also happy v-day and also deancas wedding day? Good for them, good for them.
A dimple in his brother's cheek shows, some hidden amusement, despite the coldness in his eyes. “It’s the apocalypse, kind of a requirement.”
Dean hates taking sleep aids, but he pops an expired Valium he kept in the medkit and tries to get some rest.
“The what?”
Sometimes - just sometimes - he thinks he might like it better that way.
Dean blinks. “Like, as a date.”
Dean thinks about that morning. He was pushing back a headache and he and Cas were laughing and then - then they weren’t laughing. And Cas was
Chapter warnings in the end notes
“No, yeah,” Dean says, harried. “You can. Go ‘head. That’s.” He nods, smiles. Cas kisses him again and Dean just tries to lay back and make it something good, easy, tries to hold the good feelings he had moments ago in his hands.
He looks up at Sam. “Someone has a bag full of new tricks.”
Dean sighs.
“Oh, you said a lot of something, alright.” He turns around and rolls them over, playfighting, stupid kid shit. Cas laughs, though - Cas never got to do this before either, he thinks. Fingers tickle his side and he laughs too, and maybe it is fine, really.
“All there, angel?”
“Beth is fun. She likes Fiona Apple.” Dean turns to look at him, one hand on the steering wheel, another straightening the pair of sunglasses he haphazardly put on.
Faith *jumps* part two!! I don't think when I wrote the first Faith rewrite I was going to come back to this, or at least, I wasn't 100% sure, but as more of s1 was written out I realized it would've been interesting to see how this story looked if it was allowed to operate for months longer than originally planned. Also I think Cas accidentally wandering into 'semi-famous' status and balking at it is pretty funny, even if the rest of this chapter isn't. Lastly, I am SO sorry we're not doing a full rewrite of Provenance - it was one of my other fave episodes in the season! But looking at it within the scope of the timeline and such I didn't think it would really do much for Cas or Dean's character arcs. Maybe we'll get more detail of it in Jess's POV?
He sits on the bed and thinks. He closes his eyes, trying to remember where he was, who he was, but it all escapes his mind like sand through his fingers. There's moments where he thinks
“Anything,” Cas says, because he doesn’t know.
Dean is stronger than the garden variety demon - something in his blood, about destiny being turned and pulled taught by his own defiled existence. Castiel as he is now is weaker than him. Dean still turns his back.
The only thing they had concluded were those that were hospitalized seemed to last longer than victims who were out in the open, but the end was the same, and the cycle was left to repeat itself over and over again.
Cas turns in a circle. "Do you see any area where the dirt has been disturbed?"
Castiel frowns. This realm surely has spies of its own, even amidst the bloodshed and uncoordinated horrors. During the distraction, that elder demon had slunk away, and there is no one nearby that Castiel can sense. So he asks, “not even to stop the end of the world?”
Out of the seventeen/eighteen completed chapters of this fic (just hit 50k in the google doc btw! i literally pulled a nanowrimo a month late in less than thirty days on this goddamn thing wtf) this is probably my fave chapter so far? idk what that says about me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Dean walks to the car and gets a bottle of water. Chugs half of it and pours the rest down the back of his neck, the grey cotton of his t-shirt going dark. “Fuck, it’s hot.”
So any self respecting spn fan probably has like, Faith or Devil's Trap or Pilot as their favorite spn s1 episode and my favorite was. Scarecrow. Because, I don't know, I'm from New England and I like orchards? Anyway, the Reveal has happened! This was definitely like, an Emotional moment to write. I know the initial coming outs we do (if you are in fact someone who has done or thought about doing a coming out of some sort) can vary wildly and I'm sure this is based on some stuff that happened with me irl because imprinting you know. Anyway - enjoy!
Dean glances at the possible banshee case that was probably benevolent anyway, and flips the newspaper closed.
Cheryl’s in the center of the storm, arm out and  holding John against the wall. Heather’s standing by one of the open chest freezes, crying and screaming at her sister to stop.
Dean grins at the thought. He
“There was nothing in the hospital records. They all died of starvation, dehydration, or exhaustion.”
“So did you two hook up or what?” Cas tilts his head. Being around college students, he’s come to realize ‘hook up’ can mean basically whatever you want it to mean.
“I don’t get it,” Dean says, leaning back in the chair. “There’s usually a
Cas does, and the white-blue light slides inside him, eager to find a new home. He swallows it down and doesn’t say a word, just holds Dean’s gaze, as if waiting for more instructions.
"I'm sure there's enough demons and angels who would like to see Michael and Lucifer duke it out that it won't really be
"Okay. Fair point." He pauses. "Is that why you got freaked out? You're afraid you're, what, gonna go dark side or something?"
Dean inclines his head. "Alright."
So this entire witch/rib carving arc was done 90% so we could get Cas's Reveal of not being a human to Dean. The other 10% is bc I think Cas's Lincoln is ugly and if he's driving an ugly car I want it to fit his character. Send me an ask on tumblr or drop a comment here if you have a secret dream car Cas would drive in the good Supernatural that lives in your head because I have about ten suggestions that are top tier.
He isn’t sure what Cas says, but they don’t come over when he brings back their drinks. Dean tips the new bottle back and doesn’t taste anything, can’t. And Cas is unbothered because. He’s always unbothered.
i wrote most of this super late at night, read it through the next day and went: wow! this hurt my feelings :)
Cas reaches forward, holding Dean's hand in both of his own, thumb brushing along the cut. Dean wants to pull back almost as much as he doesn't want to move at all. He watches Cas caress that aching part of him and only manages to jerk back because Cassie of all people is coming up to them.
"Uh, you think," he swallows, tongue feeling too big in his mouth. "The - we can -" he glances at the clock. It's too late to go out anywhere in a town this tiny. The case Cas was on here is finished, anyway. He's stuck here. Cas puts a hand on his cheek. His eyes are dark in the dim lighting.
"Thanks." He heads back to his car, flips open the book until he finds pages depicting Illinois. He traces his fingers over state routes and highways, moving east. Connecticut, Bozrah. Bingo.
"Who do you think he's working with, then?" Cas tilts his head, looks up. Doesn't answer. "Well? Are you going to share with the class or -"
Dean swears, slams the drawer shut. "You better be right about the two witch theory. Let's go."
“Castiel…?”
Okay, well! 90k later we're finally ready for the Pilot! It's been a wild ride to get here. I'll be taking a month off to recharge and write more, so the next update is going to be on Sunday, March 28th! Unless I break and start posting early lmao. In the mean time I'd love to see what episodes/ideas you'd like to see in s1! I can't promise to implement them but I'm really into what others would like to see in a series rewrite :)
"I can feel it starting." He moves a hand up to wiggle at his forehead. "Right here."
thing that Dean lets him finish it all in one long swallow.
He plunges deeper, and deeper, until he’s forced to wonder if hell has an end, a bedrock foundation.
Got any requests?” She has a boom box sitting on her dresser with a stack of CDs next to it. “Please don’t say Metallica.”
(See the end of the chapter for
A spirit hasn’t manifested yet, but it’s only a matter of time. He keeps moving through the darkness; distantly, something else begins to move with him. “If you’re trying to attack me, you’re taking your time,” he says, frowning out the dirty, barred windows looking down into an overgrown courtyard. Thick fingers curl around his shoulder, and he slowly turns.
They talk about what music to listen to and if the thing that's making dogs disappear around Tallahassee is a monster or just an alligator on the loose and what they're going to eat and where to stop for the night, but they absolutely don’t talk about
They get separated eventually. Dean isn't concerned - he's used to the particular flavor of Castiel, in between the demons, angels, and humans tossed into the mix. They're close. He just has to get through the wall of demons and things will be fine.
He stands still, waiting to see if John will say anything else. His dad turns back to the books. “Get going. You’re burning daylight.”
He scrabbles to unlock the passenger side door of the Impala, fumbles with the glove box, the new hands and nerves making him clumsy. “Come on, come on -” He grabs the vial and runs back to Cas. “Here, Cas - here,” Dean says, yanking the pendant open. He tips Anna’s Grace into Cas’s mouth, “I was saving it, just in case - okay, so don’t…”
A shorter chapter this time - as far as psychics go, don't think I'm sleeping on Missouri! We just know that Bobby knew Pamela before 4.01 so it made more sense for her to get brought up first.
Please check end notes for content warnings (there are spoilers).
“Did you want to?” his low voice snaps Dean back into focus. “Did you want to try it tonight?”
** The 'Black Canary' is a DC superhero with a powerful scream that can hurt/paralyze anyone she uses it on.
Cairo is a wreck, but yet another seal holds. It should be a celebration - drinks and a night full of pool games Dean can rig, playful winks thrown in Cas's direction until the angel gets visibly flustered, but Cas is reserved that night, even after five Tequila Sunrises and a Strawberry Daiquiri.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Right.”
“Right. Tomorrow.”
"It's them."
I think this chapter is my longest one to date, oops. Many things happen in it, most notably - John returning, Bela returning, and we finally find the author of the magical text Cas has been searching for! Although in my mind this is the 'Cas learns the painful lesson that not every woman he meets will be his friend' chapter. Sorry bud :(
“Stop!” John shouts.
and then it's gone. It's frustrating enough that after a few minutes, he gives up. There's only one thing that jumps out to him, a raspy voice saying
Their eyes meet. “Not unless you will it,” he promises. And that was that.
"And leave the wendigo to pick off any other campers that come by? And there will be other campers that come by," Dean says.
"I'm the one with presumably illegal firearms in a car that's registered to a fake name, Dean. I'm probably the evil clone."
"Loving the outlook there, man."
Her eyes slide across the two of them, and Dean wants to say they’re not doing anything, even though, really, they
They make decent time and camp out for the night. Dean sketches out protective sigils in the dirt with a stick, the black earth kicking up the scent of mulched leaves and whatever else has been left to decompose on the forest floor for decades. Haley's guide, Roy, laughs at him and wanders off with a shotgun over his shoulder. Dean resists the urge to roll his eyes - if only guns could protect you from everything out there.
working on a cure. I'm trying to stop the end of the fucking world!”
Dean stills. “Alone?”
“Dean, just - don’t -” Dean waits. His brother, or the man who had once been his brother, however it works, just sighs and says, “try not to die. Again.”
*Content warnings: two minor characters die near the end of this fic, one by a self-inflicted gunshot wound, the other is also implied to have committed suicide prior to this chapter. Also, another minor character refers to herself with a homophobic slur in the first scene.
“It’s the pot, I imagine,” Cas says, still chewing. Dean laughs.
“This is just like before,” Cheryl's voice is pitched low, dangerous. “You’re trying to leave! Again!”
“I need your help,” Sam tells him, from the other side of the fire. Castiel isn’t sure where, exactly, Sam got access to holy oil, but he stays on his side of the room.
The last few sparks of his garrison went out - either he was too far to sense them, or they, too, had fallen. Castiel condenses himself, to protect the shreds of his Grace and to try to remain as inconspicuous as he can.
Cas thinks it’s nothing that crazy, but he doesn’t say anything. The guitars start, then the drums, and the vocals aren’t far behind. Dean cranks the volume up as Cas switches into drive and takes off, grabbing Dean’s hand and squeezing.
“Eating? Drinking?” Cas guesses, because he doesn't want to know what else Dean thinks he can fake.
Now he’s something that doesn’t need food or sleep, and he’s shucked up with an angel who can look at a picture of some cash and snap more into existence. Dean makes it a game of finding the fanciest hotels in whatever bumfuck backwater county they’re in, getting the presidential, or even the honeymoon if it makes the receptionist squirm, looking between him and Cas’s very male vessel and
“Since before you were even born, it was written.” The space between them pulls, like an invisible, gargantuan hand is stretching his plane of vision, and for a moment, Castiel thinks he sees something golden and shining, something like -
Dean sighs. "Look, man, I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you something else, but. You're a good guy, Cas. And a good hunter, too, for what it's worth. I'm uh. Glad you convinced me to go back to that house. Dad could've gotten hurt if we didn't, you know?"
His hands tremble when he puts them over Michael’s. “Yeah, it does.” He shoves down, hard, through the flesh of his belly, his organs, until the blade settles into the bone of his hip, and the seal is broken again.
But Dean’s happy to ignore them. “Come on, morning traffic’s gonna start soon and I wanna get outta here before then.”
Dean doesn’t let Castiel mess with the car, but he tells him to conjure up enough money for a room - somewhere cheesy, with mirrored ceilings and a hot tub in the ensuite. They lay their research out and when Dean calls it a night, he tells the angel he’s taking a bath.
Dean’s faintly surprised when she lets him go. “Giving up that easily?”
He falls asleep like that, tilted towards Cas and listening to him breathe.
Anyway comment with what you think Cas's zodiac sign should be I'm open for discussion on that 👀
again, the one that says he’s kicking his puppy or wrenching his still-beating heart out from his chest and crushing it in his fist. “What?” he snarls, fixing Cas with a scowl. The dreams are getting more vivid, and he didn’t get much sleep last night. Or the night before. It’s definitely showing.
Dean snaps his head around and she smiles at him. She's wearing the same outfit from the last time he saw her. “Hello Dean,” she says.
“Whoa, whoa! Sammy, it's
“Cas killed Dad,” Dean says.
Sam and Dean burst into the library, dressed for sleep but carrying angel blades. Immediately, both humans cover their eyes with their arms. “Cas!” Dean yells.
Cas glares at him. “Those plans would change. I don't have the strength to bring you back on my own.” His hands clench into fists. “And I am
“Dean, you dug yourself out of your grave
this?”
“What do they want me to do?” Dean asks, finally, dragging his thoughts back to the matter at hand.
Castiel barely has time to close the bunker's door before Jack's shout of “Cas!” rings out. He runs into view at the foot of the entry stairs, Dean and Sam close behind.
It's demons who killed Dee. It's demons who are torturing her now. Sam's ready for a little revenge.
Castiel's wings flare out of their neutral pose. Dean can't see them so there's no reason to be diplomatic.
He knew he wanted to undress Dean, too. He had pictured him naked (of course he had), but he was ready to see him and touch him for real this time. He started with Dean's shirt, pulling it ungracefully over his head - Dean was taller, so it was difficult, but he was too impatient to undo each button. His pants and boxers were easier, and suddenly Dean was standing unapologetically in front of him, begging to be touched just with the look in his darkening green eyes.
Cas shuddered, and tried to think about Dean instead.
"Mom, I'm firsty." Jack looked hopefully at Hannah's bag, and she quickly produced a bottle of water for him.
“Ok. So a pepperoni and a ham and pineapple pizza...and I’ll get a bottle of champagne. Anything else?”
“Cas,” Dean whispered. He began to stare absently at the tile. Sam could see Dean’s breath hitching in his throat as he took labored breaths. And then...he turned away quickly and disappeared, avoiding eye contact altogether.
“Yeah.” He watched Dean smile contentedly and was happy the conversation had diverted to happier things.
"There's angels watching over us. Of that I'm sure,” Hannah said softly, and kissed Jack's ear.
A small face appeared in front him a few seconds later.
. He grasped Castiel’s waist and rolled over so that he was on top of him, staring down into Cas’s blue eyes; his pupils were blown from lust, and it pushed Dean close to the edge to know that he was causing this kind of response in a man like Cas, who seemed so controlled and sure before, and was now falling apart underneath him, begging for his touch.
Dean heard him shuffle out of the room and he shut his eyes, intent on sleeping off more of his hangover before joining his family for dinner. He hadn’t seen Jodi since she arrived back from Paris and was looking forward to hearing about her travels. Jodi, their head of household, had been like a mother to Dean, Sam and Claire since their parents had died in a hunting accident 20 years ago, and he looked forward to wrapping her in a good long hug.
Sam was strolling down the hallway of the bunker towards his bedroom when he heard Dean. Was he praying to Cas again? He caught his brother doing that a lot in the past few days. It had been nearly a week since The Empty had taken Cas from them, and Dean rarely spoke now except to talk to his invisible angel when he thought he was alone.
I'm scared. I don't know how to do this."
With shortness of breath, you explained the infinite.
“You son of a bitch,” he breathed. "Touch me. Please." His voice trembled.
Cas was grinning now. He handed the water back to Dean and tucked his face shyly into his pillow. Dean dove back in behind him and resumed his earlier position, pulling Cas into him and burying his nose in his neck.
“Ok. Five minutes. You look so handsome, Sam. You too, Dean. Everyone is going to be so impressed. You two clean up nice.” Charlie gave them a wink and an encouraging smile and shut the door behind her.
"Me, too. I'm sorry I didn't get time to...thank you properly." Cas's voice took on the sexy, gravelly tone from that morning, and Dean felt satisfaction knowing that Cas had been thinking about him, too. He let himself be attacked with hot kisses that started behind his ear, his body erupting in goosebumps from the assault. Cas quickly moved in to hungrily slot his lips with Dean's as naturally as if this was their 100th kiss and not their second. Dean was painfully hard, having wrestled with uninvited waves of arousal all day. It was when Cas fumbled with his belt that he finally moved to stop him, feeling like this wasn’t right. He rested his head back on the wall again, trying hard to bring himself down from the high he was feeling.
“Your boss expects you to work late to bring over her dry-cleaning? What is this,
“It’s ok. Just give it another minute, Dean. The initial numb feeling will pass quickly. But if you don’t like it, you don’t have to take any more. I’ve got more sherry.”
"I'm sorry, Dean. I didn't know. Thank you for being there for me, even though you're obviously going through a lot. You're a good person."
"No, not yet. Stop being an ass, Gabriel. I don't even know why I'm telling you this."
“Hey guys!” She said, alerting them to her presence.
"Hey Gabe, what's up?"
"Yeah."
Cas turned, and Dean saw fear flash in his eyes.
No. He had not just been admiring the physical stature of a strange man. He had not. He tried to scrub the observations from his mind, but he couldn't. Especially as he watched the tan overcoat join his green one on the floor, and watched this stunning creature roll up his shirtsleeves and stand next to him playfully, hands on his hips, staring thoughtfully at the infinity painting.
“Gabe? What is it?” Balthazar looked at him with a worried expression.
When they got to the restaurant, Gabriel smiled wide when Balthazar noticed he had reserved them the table where they sat on their first date.
"That would be a big risk, don't you think?"
He watched Dean sigh heavily. And after another moment of silence, when Sam thought he might have to try again later, Dean finally spoke.
As soon as the door shut, Dean hated the silence.
"Remember when dad beat me up for it? Told me I would go to hell?"
Ben fell asleep watching Scooby-Doo at 7:30. Dinner had been well received and Cas felt completely content after they were all stuffed and happy, lounging lazily on the couch together in Dean's living room until Ben's head hit Dean's shoulder and he was out.
“Cas has a son.” Dean said it out of the blue. Sam thought he saw tears in his brother’s eyes when he said it.
"Hey Ben, I wanna see some American Gladiator obstacle course practice out there!"
He gave one more tight smile and backed up the driveway towards the front door, hands in his pockets, as he watched the best thing that had ever happened to him reverse out of his life.
“It’s going to be ok. You can wait. Let Cas have his night...and perhaps we can still try and enjoy ours?”
Lisa asked Dean on multiple occasions what the problem was, and why he never wanted to sleep with her, but he always shut down when she tried to start a conversation about it, so she was forced to live in emotional agony, wondering if it had something to do with her and not knowing how to fix it.
Dean looked around hastily, trying to locate Cas, and finally he did.
He dove into his food, not sure what else to do. He was also very aware that Lisa was looking at him.
. He felt himself getting warm.
"Dean! Ow, get off. I need a break after…"
“I have a lot to teach you, Dean. But can we start tomorrow?” Cas buried his head in Dean’s neck, pulling him in and stroking his hair.
“I really can’t do this much longer. Keep me updated on your job leads. You know it’s going to keep me up at night. I hate worrying about you.”
"I did?" He tried not to sound too hopeful. The relief that was washing over him was making him numb. He had convinced himself that Cas skipped out on him because he had second thoughts. He knew what that was like. He'd been there.
"Dean? Are you still there? Are you OK?"
"So, when I ask Dean to marry me, I should get permission from you first, sir?"
“What was his name?” Dean was whispering now, his mouth dry.
“I don’t know how it all happened, but I met him. His name is Jack. And I met his mom. I believe you know her. Hannah  from your office?”
“How was your day before your radiator exploded?” Dean asked.
“What?” Dean raised his eyebrows in surprise as he followed Castiel’s gaze.
"Last night."
"Yep!" He said proudly and set the first burger and fries in front of Cas.
Sam knew that Cas was Dean's weakness now. And Dean knew he had to do this; he should have just gotten it over with already, but he was terrified.
“No. Just go get ready and I’ll meet you at the car in fifteen.”
“God you’re beautiful,” Dean said. His breath hitched and his voice was surprisingly gravelly as his eyes drank in Cas’s body. He moved to straddle Cas as he slipped off his own shirt, debating on what to do next. Half of him wanted to release all of the sexual tension that had built up between them hard and fast; he wanted to fuck this gorgeous man as soon as possible until they were both slick with sweat and exhausted and too spent to move. But the other half of him wanted this to be slow and sensual. He imagined them exploring and kissing every inch of each other before having sex, and the thought made him groan with pent up longing. He was surprised at how natural it felt to be with Cas, and how badly he wanted this...
He thought.
“You are...amazing, Cas. So fucking perfect.” Dean stopped kissing him again long enough to drink in his flushed face and the way his body desperately strained towards him from the waist down, shaking with need. Cas's bottom lip disappeared between his teeth as he moaned, eyes closed, fists clenched. Dean wanted to see him come. The thought of it was driving him crazy.
Sam didn’t ask why Cas felt so confident about that.
Dean felt as though he were being suffocated. His mind was screaming and his heart felt as though it would shatter. And he was suddenly aware that his torso and one of his arms were heavily dressed in bandages and that he was in immense physical pain as well.
Dean passed out in Sam's lap, repeating the same things over and over, and then falling still and silent.
"Do you...want to have sex?” Cas asked quietly.
"Not today it isn't."
He found his pants and shoes, slid them on quietly, and climbed over the center console to the front seat, where he proceeded to exit through the driver side door, pulling his coat with him as he set off for Jake's.
"Tonight? Will you stay at my house again? In my bed with me this time?"
Sam actually thought that this time, Dean might make his relationship with Lisa work. But here he was again, hauling the collapsible poker table out of his trunk alongside a bottle of whiskey. He hated humoring Dean this way, helping him by enabling all of his worst habits, but he knew Dean would do all of it anyway, with or without him. At least with him there, Sam could haul him into bed later if it came down to it and not have to go find him in the parking lot of a bar somewhere.
"I don't deserve any more of your help, Hannah. Not after what I've done. You helping to find me jobs is more than enough. Even that's too much."
"Sure thing. I can show you where it is." Dean stood up a little too fast and took a throw pillow with him to cover the front of his pants. Cas tried not to think about that. But...he did think about it. In fact, he forgot to follow Dean altogether.
“I love you, Castiel...” Dean slipped into a heavy sleep. And somehow as he slipped away, he knew the demons that had battled with him in his mind for the last thirty years were gone for good. He could finally be at peace.
“Thank you, Dean. That’s...very kind,” he heard himself say. “Can I ask you one more favor?” He thought he saw Dean’s body tense for a moment but chose to ignore it.
"Cas?" He shook him a little. Nothing. "Cas?" Louder. Still nothing. Finally, Dean decided to try and move him. He was heavier than he looked, but not in a bad way. When Dean slipped a hand under Cas's back, he felt strong, lean muscle there and he tried extremely hard not to think too much about that. He put his other hand under Cas's head and propped him up in a seated position, but his head proceeded to slump forward. Dean chuckled. This was madness, and yet he was enjoying it.
5:30 took way too long to arrive. Dean couldn't wait to give Cas his car back - he had put on new tires, fixed the radiator, fixed the muffler, fixed the heat and AC, and did an oil change. He also took it through the car wash. After knowing Cas for 24 hours, he already lived for his rare smile. He was sure this would procure one.
"You do that to me. Please - go slow." Dean swallowed thickly, trying to get ahold of himself.
"Yeah?"
"Dean! What a surprise! I didn't expect you until tomorrow!"
“Oh Hell no. Settle down? Psh.” He made eye contact with Sam as he finished with the tie and winked. “You know there’s always going to be a case out there for me and Cas. But I can do the college thing and the job thing and all that, sure; watch me.” Sam chuckled at Dean's response as he turned to look in the full length mirror that Charlie had brought for him. He didn’t think he had ever worn a suit this nice; a 3-piece in dark blue that he had purchased especially for today. He couldn’t wait to see how beautiful Eileen looked; his heart beat just a little bit faster when he thought about it. Cas was going to walk her down the aisle, and Dean was standing up for him as his best man. He couldn’t think of a more perfect way to kick off the day than by having his favorite people in the world surrounding him. A tear escaped from the corner of his eye and he tried to brush it away before Dean could see it, but he was unsuccessful.
“Yeah, and I remember how wrecked you were about that. More wrecked than I’ve ever seen you about anything else. He meant something to you."
"I lied for a long time about who I was, and Gabriel protected me as much as he could."
Dean looked back at the Impala and saw Cas still sitting in the driver’s seat, lost in the moment.
Dean pulled Cas to the floor, pinning his arms above his head, kissing him roughly. He started with his mouth, and worked his way down Cas’s now familiar body, just as beautiful as he remembered, tearing away the rest of the fabric that still remained between them. But he was surprised when Cas stopped him suddenly, pulling him back up so they were face to face.
We can light a match
“Our souls”, Cas said quietly, staring at the fiery light as it hovered between them, casting a twilight ambience across their faces. “It is as I thought.”
"See you then." Cas waved goodbye and disappeared down the street.
"Nothin." Dean said. "You should always wear my clothes." Cas blushed and looked down thoughtfully at the black t-shirt and jeans that Dean had given him. He was also critically aware of the fact that Sam and Eileen were watching him, and so he kept his head down. He didn't think he liked the feeling of awkwardness that had gripped him just now, and avoided making eye contact with anyone.
After a few legitimate dates with his co-worker, Dean was having the best sex of his life. It was awkward at first, but after stumbling through it together a few times, it was good. It was the first time that either of them had experimented sexually with a man, and it was comforting to know that they were learning together. It made the whole thing a hell of a lot less awkward, and he even considered asking Benny to be his boyfriend for awhile.
"I love you, brother."
"I know. And maybe grief was the wrong term. Let's call it an exorcism of that part of your life instead? I only had to meet Chuck once for five minutes to know how your lives went when you were young. You need to go to that funeral so you can experience healing. Purge that place and those people from your life and don't look back. And punch Raph in the fucking face for me too, OK?”
Cas watched Dean’s eyebrows almost disappear into his hairline when he poked his head out the door and saw the two of them standing in the driveway together. Cas moved away abruptly, feeling guilty.
"Castiel?"
"Everything OK, Cas?" Gabriel gave him a nervous glance.
Cas was surprised at how quickly Dean was changing from gentle to aggressive and back again, but he was enjoying the unpredictability of it. It was sexy and it was making him crazy.
It played out stranger than it seemed
“Gross.”
“Absolutely. Please”, Dean said. He had been leaning back against the wall behind him, but immediately leaned forward and rested his elbows on his knees in childlike anticipation, hands folded in front of him, looking sideways at Castiel.
"The angel of Thursday?"
No one could get me so perfectly
Eileen wandered into the kitchen shortly after Dean and Cas both disappeared, wearing one of Sam's blue flannel shirts. Sam liked it that she preferred to wear his shirts to bed. She looked cute in them. And he took a moment to pull her into a hug, and then signed to her that they would be making breakfast for 4. She brightened at this news, inquiring as to who the other two would be.
"Let me see...no. You have until the end of the day, Castiel. Anything left in your apartment then belongs to me." He flicked his wrist in a half wave and disappeared down the dimly lit hallway while Cas cursed under his breath. It's not like he had much - a mattress and a bed frame he had found for free. A chair he didn't want anyway. A suitcase full of clothes. Toiletries. A couple of pictures in a shoe box. His fridge was almost empty except for a jar of grape jelly. He had peanut butter, bread, and whiskey on the counter. He could get away with packing up his whole pathetic life in less than an hour.
Dean stood still, quite sure that his face showed a mixture of defeat and exhaustion at the idea of being found by London’s high society debutantes at this particular moment...or ever, for that matter.
"Donna! Come quick!”
She responded:
Shortly after laying down on the cool, familiar pillow in his room, Cas heard a distressed shout from Dean’s room, and abruptly stood up, striding quickly down the hall and landing in front of Dean’s closed bedroom door. He leaned against the cool wood, hands placed on either side of his face, ear pressed against the door as he listened for any further sign of movement or distress from the other side. He saw Sam poke his head out of his own room, and relax visibly when he saw that Cas was already tending to the situation. Cas was sure that Sam needed a break from taking care of his brother.
Cas rewarded Dean’s question with an adorable half smile as he sauntered into the kitchen, and Dean noticed with equal parts annoyance and adoration that Cas was wearing one of his t-shirts (again). “It’s a surprise,” he said, and opened the door to the coffee cupboard. “Dean...where are the coffee filters?”
“Nope! It’s still a surprise until we get there.” Dean winked at him and backed out of the driveway. Cas’s stomach filled with anticipatory butterflies, and they stayed there for the entire thirty minute drive, where they arrived in front of a small cottage outside of Lebanon. When they pulled up, an older gentleman came out of the front door to greet them - he was obviously expecting them, and Cas wondered what all of this was about.
Balthazar reached over and put his hand on top of Gabriel’s.
"Sorry. Force of habit. What can I get you two to drink?"
Dust to dust
Jack nodded. Dean fell silent.
"Sammy?"
"What did I say about bringing him here, Gabriel? I told you to come with Castiel and no one else. Leave." Chuck's voice teetered between rage and disappointment, and his words seemed to give Raphael a license to chime in.
She pushed away in surprise.
It started to snow. Large, silent flakes fell and caught in their hair and their eyelashes, their breath steaming up visibly against the darkness. They shivered from the dampness and the chilly wind after a while, neither one wanting to move first. Cas finally pushed himself up with his hands, knowing they needed to move out of the cold, and shyly handed Dean his leather jacket as he pulled away. He warmed at the amused half smile on Dean's face as Dean sat propped on the ground, hands draped over his knees, frozen in thoughtful contemplation before he moved to put his jacket back on.
"Cas. Do you have someone to go home to tonight?"
"I'm happy to hear it, Dean. Can you do me a favor?"
"Cas, I- please stop. Just for a second. I'm...close." Dean forced Cas to stop rocking against him so that he could catch his breath, and he blushed with embarrassment.
“No!” Cas heard himself say, and realized too late that his outburst from the dream translated back to real life, where he returned abruptly to find Dean pushing away from him aggressively, shocked, climbing backwards towards the other side of the bed, eyes wild.
“What do you mean?”
He glanced around, trying to figure out where he was. Across the wide gravel parking lot, shrouded in the darkness of the night, was a single car; the Impala. Cas's heart quickened as his eyes started darting around, looking for any sign of Dean. The windows of the Roadhouse, which was called "Jake's", were dark. He wondered if Dean was working a case here. It had to have been what...at least a week since he had been taken by The Empty? He wasn't sure.
"Dean." He said it again, trying to coax an answer out of his oldest son.
Cas woke to his phone buzzing repeatedly until he couldn't ignore it anymore.
Dean wandered into the main hall of the bunker a short time later and was met with a table that had been set for two - two plates, two sets of silverware, and two lowball glass arranged next to a full bottle of nice whiskey.
“I’m so happy you decided to join me. Come, let’s get you set up.” He motioned towards a table in the back of the room, and Dean followed him, wiping his palms on his hands nervously as the warmth from the room started to set in, amplifying his nervousness.
Cas always appreciated Sam's thoughtful and direct nature. He never felt judged or uncomfortable in Sam's presence, and he was happy to have him here now to talk about Dean. He had always loved Sam so much, like a brother, and was going to miss him.
Gabriel watched Cas choke on his drink and start coughing violently.
"Shut up. I hate you."
"I can’t figure out quite what’s missing. I’ve been contemplating, but I haven’t put my finger on it yet.” He didn’t want the stranger to know that he intended to possibly purchase the work, should there be potential competition for it. So he tried to act as though he was relatively disinterested in it for the moment.
He felt a deep burn as Dean slipped slowly inside of him, but it was absolute euphoria at the same time, and he pushed back against Dean, raising up on to his hands and knees and relishing in the feeling of Dean’s hands lightly gliding to his hips, steadying him, and slowly drawing in and out, exploring the situation with hesitation at first. But when Dean sensed urgency from Cas, he picked up speed, going harder and faster as Cas moaned and begged for more. Everything became a blur as Dean lost himself, pounding harder when he found Cas’s sweet spot and made him whimper in a drabble of English and Enochian. Eventually Cas's legs gave out and he asked Dean to stop. He rolled over onto his back, strung out and breathing hard.
"I got the wrong coffee filters. And I yelled at him for eating in the car." Dean thought he heard a small snicker through the phone and it made him scowl. "It's not funny, Sammy."
"Thanks Bobby."
“Ah.” That’s really all Cas needed to say - Sam had wondered if Jack might wake Cas up. Being God had its perks. “And are you...here to stay?” Sam narrowed his eyes as he pulled a spatula out of a kitchen drawer and started putting bacon into a frying pan.
“Don’t worry, OK?” He knew it wouldn’t make a difference, but he said it anyway. He hated that she talked to him like she was scolding a child sometimes.
Dean busied himself with opening the wine and looked thoughtfully at his fiancé. “Frank is moving most of his operation to a newer, bigger location, but he’s attached to this place because it’s the original farm, with his original hives. It means a whole lot to him, and he needs someone to come here and tend to the cottage and the grounds during the week while he's at the new farm- someone who might want to come and live here one day when he retires. I thought maybe...it would be something you would enjoy doing instead of making people lattes in the suburbs?” Dean stopped for a minute to try and read Cas’s face, but he was struggling to get a pulse on what he was thinking, so he continued. “What do you think, Cas? Would you want to take care of this place? Maybe call it ours one day?”
While Cas was gone, Dean made up the couch with a bottom sheet and a quilt made out of his favorite band t-shirts - the ones that were worn too thin to wear anymore. He and Lisa had gotten in a fight when his favorite shirts had started disappearing, but he couldn't be mad when she surprised him with this for Christmas last year. He wondered if Cas would appreciate it the way he had appreciated Baby.
"And?" Sam waited in suspense, honestly unsure of how Cas would respond.
"You got it, brother." He turned away so Sam wouldn't see the tears in his eyes.
She smiled softly and reached across the table to put her hand on Sam's. She was so happy that between her and Cas, they were finally bringing happiness and stability to the lives of the wayward Winchesters. When she had watched Sam help Dean fill out an application for an online business school the week before, she dared to hope that hunting would also be a thing of the past. As much as it was in her blood the same way it was in theirs to be a hunter, they weren't young anymore. And maybe it was time to slow down and enjoy the little things in life? Like each other? She was going to hold on to that glimmer of hope.
"You don't owe me a damn thing. Look at you - you look happy. Dare I ask about this change in demeanor…?" He raised an eyebrow and gave Cas a hopeful side eye.
When she got to the park, she spied Dean sitting on a bench with a cute, petite woman, engaged in conversation. Ben was sitting in the sand eating a snack and animatedly conversing with another small boy.
Castiel recovered quickly and adjusted himself on top of Dean, who spread his legs, knotching Cas perfectly between them, rolling his body up against Cas’s and grabbing his ass to bring him in even closer. They assaulted each other's swollen lips with aggressive, biting kisses and continued thrusting against each other, their hard lengths rubbing together until they were both panting with need.
"I...made us a picnic", Cas finally said. He gave Dean a small smile, knowing that he would know what to do.
Sam turned back to Cas, ready to apologize for Dean’s behavior, but he remained silent when he saw the fear on Cas’s face.
"What?" Dean raised an eyebrow in surprise. "And not go back to the bunker?"
He didn’t really know what to do, so he excused himself to the bathroom, where he fully intended to hide. As he shut the door, he heard the beginnings of what he assumed was going to be a heated exchange.
Sam nodded, but Dean thought he sensed nervousness from his younger brother. This could be a rough visit, and they both knew it.
“You’re doing me such a favor, Dean. I owe you. Any time is fine."
"Proper nouns. Like names", she said.
It's not what you say
"Cas?"
"Yep! It's only two blocks! We can walk!" Ben exclaimed. "C'mon, Dean!"
“I know. I’m sorry.”
"Dean Winchester. I will be waiting for you when you come home", he said breathlessly. He looked at Dean again and saw peace in his eyes. It made him warm to see that, and it brought closure to the moment that he had craved without knowing it. All he had really wanted - all that he had needed - was to see Dean happy. And to know that Dean loved him and that he was the
"Well, this conversation got dark fast,” Cas responded, knowing Gabriel was switching gears so that he could cope with whatever was coming next.
“It is. Its the colors from my dreams.”
"Is he going to be OK with it?" There was concern in Cas' voice.
Eileen desperately hoped that Sam knew how much she cared; how much she wanted to protect him from everything evil in the world. And how much she loved him. She never felt like saying the words truly conveyed the depth of love she had for her tall, sensitive hunter. She had never felt so intensely devoted to anyone, and she would give up anything for his happiness. It was the reason that she felt that she understood Dean and Cas's present situation so well. Thinking about how hard it would be to put herself and Sam in their place made her feel physically ill. What a terrible thing love could be, really. And yet...
"That's really what your first fight was about?" He asked, trying to keep the amusement out of his voice.
When he got to Hannah's door, he lost a little of the confidence that he had harnessed earlier, but he didn't let it stop him from knocking.
The kiss that followed was a new type of first kiss: a first kiss that signified forever. Cas thought he might die from the euphoria he felt when Dean lifted him off of his knees until he was standing, hands wrapped tightly around Cas's waist. Cas was used to being just a little bit shorter, but now he bent down to meet the kiss, moving his hands to wipe new tears from Dean’s face and pushing him backwards, trying to avoid the takeout that was still spread out on the bed when he climbed on top of his fiancé to deepen their kiss and bury his face in his neck.
It seemed like it took an hour before the house came into view. It looked the same: old white farmhouse with peeling paint, the window in the upper front bedroom, top right pane, was still broken from when Cas had accidentally hit a baseball through it when he was 9. There were boards over it now, but the evidence of the incident remained.
Cas was overwhelmed by the way his body responded to Dean when he came out of nowhere with that kiss. It made him realize that he had never actually experienced true, desperate desire before. He couldn't even remember the last time he had gotten off, or even wanted to.
“Should I have Jodi and Claire alert the kitchen that we would like to have a late dinner tonight so you can rest a bit longer?” Sam asked thoughtfully.
"OK, Dean!" Ben gave him the thumbs up and headed for the monkey bars.
He moved his face close to Dean's, intent on kissing through it, but the best they did was bring their lips close together, panting, breathing each other in.
Once the bedroom door was shut, Dean practically tackled Cas into the clean sheets. He had put the band quilt on the bed,  wanting to breathe new life and happy memories into it, since it was his favorite and Cas seemed to like it, too.
“Do you still talk to that hot friend of yours? Dean Winchester?” Anna asked.
"Taylor is mom's favorite, Dean. Didn't you know that?"
He watched Cas wrestle with a response and probed further:
“Dean? Is that you?”
He was excited to see Dean again when he entered the living room. His rescuer was reclining thoughtfully in a chair next to a made up couch bed, and it was the most inviting thing he had seen for a long time.
“Dean. Watch out. Watch out!” In one motion, Cas pulled his pants back on as he sat up, and shielded Dean with his body from a cloud of violent black smoke that seemed to appear suddenly out of the wall. Flames licked at them from out of the smoke, and Dean ducked in to Castiel, closing his eyes tight. He was sure that this was hallucination from the magic cigar, but it seemed so real. He had never seen...or heard...anything like this. A guttural scream seemed to come from the depths of the smoke, and the room smelled like Dean imagined Hell might smell. And when he ventured to open his eyes for a moment, one of the demons from his drawings was hulking over them. Smoky, rancid saliva dripped from its mouth right into Castiel’s...
Dean recalled Sam inquiring about what was going on, but he couldn’t form any coherent sentences. His heart hurt and he couldn't feel anything. Maybe John was there, too...he didn’t know for sure. All he could do was vomit. And then he passed out with a loud ringing in his ears and didn't remember anything after that.
Dean was grateful that he had not used the book for his earlier “practice” sketches. He had filled several books with ideas and terribly executed human figures before he found a rhythm that he felt was worthy of this prized book from his mother, and it was now almost full with strictly Supernatural depictions. He focused most of his efforts on angels, but he also drew many of the demons that he often saw in his dreams as well. He knew that it would be frowned upon to create such deliberate depictions of evil, but the idea of angels and demons and there being a balance in good and evil in all of God’s creations fascinated him. He only wished that he had someone to share his notions with, and he hoped that Castiel might be the person who understood him. He certainly seemed to be worldly and open minded.
A new chapter begins for the Winchesters today.
"Absolutely. She's coming for dinner tomorrow night. I wanted her to meet my boys. John put an arm around each of them, and Dean felt like he was twelve again, wanting to be everything his dad thought he should be.
Hannah looked thoughtful for a moment, and Dean could tell she was contemplating how to answer.
“Don’t worry - I told them to look for you elsewhere. By the look of you when you escaped out of the gallery, I assumed you may want to be alone.”
Dean stared.
“Cas?” Sam wrinkled his forehead in confusion.
"It is." Dean looked intently at him.
Sam recognized the bottle as the selection that he had left on the table for them. He rolled his eyes and proceeded to pick his way over to Cas to take the bottle away. His actions were met with no resistance from Cas, who was still staring at the board intently, swaying to the sounds of Led Zeppelin...or maybe from his whiskey buzz. Sam wasn't actually sure.
“That bacon smells really good, Sam.”
"What's that supposed to mean?" Dean knitted his eyebrows together.
“I…” he was lost for words. He blushed deeply, forgetting how to speak, and he looked at the ground.
"Any chance you have toothpaste?” He asked, trying to relieve the tension in the room. “I can use my finger as a toothbrush, I just need…" Cas forgot what he was saying because Dean was biting his lip and concentrating on the floor. It was fucking distracting.
“Cas texted today and he’s staying at this mystery man’s house tonight.” Gabriel held his hand up to give Balthazar a high five.
They did; a diner that reminded him of the one he went to with Dean and Ben. He ordered the biggest breakfast on the menu and had at least five cups of coffee.
“You are." Gabriel kissed his boyfriend's cheek as the took their seats and fell in to silence, both knowing they would need to address the elephant in the room at some point. Gabriel's head hurt to think about it.
Dean woke up in darkness to the sound of his own scream. He sat bolt upright, feeling around, trying to figure out where he was. He saw several candles being hastily lit in the dark, and it immediately roused the image of the smoke demon from his hallucination. He breathed hard, tears escaping from the corners of his eyes. The candlelight came closer and he could make out Sam and Jodi standing over him in his own chambers at Winchester house.
, he thought, and he knew he couldn’t survive another second without him.
“See you soon, Gabe.”
"Ok."
"Sam? Are you there?"
The innkeeper in the small town where Dean was headed knew immediately that something was amiss when a well bred black mare trotted past the door, her rider hanging half off the saddle. The innkeeper identified the rider immediately as the elder Winchester brother by the family crest emblazoned on the saddle and the finery he was dressed in. He went to work immediately to untangle Dean from his restraints, and quickly realized that Dean was badly injured.
“Nah. But it’s been nice having someone to talk to today. So thank you.”
"Yeah?"
Silence descended on the room. Cas looked quietly at Dean and squeezed his hand. Dean stared at the floor.
"Have you changed your mind, Dean? Honestly, I was so proud of what you said today. About moving on and putting this bullshit behind you. Are you going to do that? For me? For you? For...Castiel?"
Dean’s eyes suddenly stopped on a box on the top shelf from his favorite pie shop. Had Cas…? No way. Cas had driven a three hour round trip to get him his favorite pie? No wonder he ate a sandwich in the car.
"I would love that." It was just a whisper, and he ignored the Nanny's glare as Jack raced inside.
"How fast - how fast can you come?" Dean whispered, barely able to get the words out as he found the lube bottle and applied more than was necessary to his hand.
, Dean thought.
"Make me one of those," Dean said, pointing at Cas's PB and J.
"Yeah?"
Cas had let his full vulnerability show when they stepped into the shower together. It was more intimate than sex. Sharing this with Cas held so much meaning. And honestly Dean cared more about spooning him and kissing him behind the ears than he did about asking if Cas would fuck him. He wanted that, too, but going slow was important.
"No. He thinks I'm coming with Lisa to tell him we're engaged. He knew I was proposing the day she left."
“Anna, can I please have another drink?” Cas polished off his remaining half glass in one gulp and handed it back to his cousin for a refill. Then he looked at Gabriel again, his blue eyes shiny.
"I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, angel. I'm close. You can stop if you want. I can finish it. I - ah."
the one I
"Absolutely. I would love that." Cas smiled back.
He had already located a garden store that he wanted to go to. Now Cas just needed to get home. 15 more minutes.
"Sam, can you grab our lovebirds? Dinner is ready."
"Sam, Dean is going to die on your next hunt." The confession just came out. Cas couldn't stop it. But he felt immediate relief upon sharing the burden of this truth with Sam. If anyone would know what to do...
"That's it, you're staying here. I'll make up the couch for you. Cancel your Uber. I got you."
"I found out Cas's dad was Chuck."
“You’re a Nephilim, Dean.”
“Dean...if this has anything to do with dad…”
Life is ours, we live it our way
After failing to see any sign of Dean, he strode towards the entry to Jake's and tried the door, but it was locked.
They stood in silence like that for another minute, the snow swirling around them, and Dean looked intently at Cas, his eyes shifting up and down Cas’s face as he contemplated the situation, enjoying the closeness, trying to figure out his next move.
"Dean is going to die. Soon." Cas blanched. He felt his body go numb.
"Its...really great. Truly," he managed, and fidgeted with his rolled up shirt sleeves, willing the flush in his face to subside.
Cas took the phone appreciatively. The phone rang out with no answer, so he left a message:
"H-hey buddy. How ya doing? You OK? I brought you some pajamas and a blanket?"
"Wanna finish up drying the dishes for me?”
"See you then." Cas was in the kitchen, drying the last of the dishes, and Dean felt completely comfortable leaving him there. It seemed...right.
"Sure."
“Cas? Are you hungry?” Dean pulled Cas out of a deep thought as he started unpacking the cooler. Cas didn’t say anything, he just nodded and sat down on the blanket, watching Dean take out peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and cups and a bottle opener for the honey wine.
"I...would like that."
Sam watched Dean chew his bottom lip for a minute before continuing.
He fell asleep. And his last thought was of Dean's hand on his shoulder in the car.
"Sam tells me you're actually quite good with your sketches - I would love to see them sometime. I have a studio in the artists' quarter while I’m in town, if you ever feel so inclined to stop by for a drink and some good conversation - I’m always happy to give honest feedback on your work." He glanced at Dean meaningfully, a small smile playing at the corner of his mouth.
They don't fool me
"What's with you?" Bobby glanced up from the service desk when Dean came in.
Dean wished Cas knew the effect he had on him just by suggesting it.
He knew he needed to go to his apartment and he was dreading it. He was on his last leg with his landlord and now he couldn't pay the rent. He had half a mind to pack up and leave without notice, before that red eviction sign appeared on his door.
When he wandered out to the kitchen a short time later, Dean was pulling a quiche out of the oven with a triumphant look on his face and putting it on the breakfast bar, where he had set two places for them that included fancy yellow linen napkins. Cas squinted at him in confusion.
“Cas, stop apologizing. Go right ahead.” Dean let the car idle in the driveway while Cas pushed “listen to message.” He heard Naomi’s voice on the other end - she sounded much nicer when she was leaving a message on someone else’s phone. She asked that “Cas give her a call back at his earliest convenience.”
"Thanks Hannah!" Ben reached for the water and took off back to the playground equipment with Jack.
"Let's have a drink", Dean said, and grabbed the bottle of whiskey as he sat down. Cas followed suit and sat across from him.
"You said that."
“You got a royal flush over there, man? Your cards can’t be that interesting.” Gabriel tried to break the tension by changing the subject. But finally, Dean responded with a small half smile, looking at Balthazar intentionally and puffing on his cigar again.
"What do you mean?"
"That's not true." Cas’s response was matter of fact. Dean took comfort in it.
"Dean, I - I couldn't possibly live up to what you've done for this family. I'm not...I'm not as gifted as you are. I wouldn't know what to do…"
Dean didn’t want to ask too many personal questions in the current setting and deflected to lighter conversation.
"A man?"
“Tell me what you want, Cas. Do you want me to make love to you, or do you want me to fuck you like this? I need to know fast - I’m so hard for you. I want to be inside you”
"Yeah. Come when you're ready." Sam put his hands in his pockets and sauntered back to the dining room.
Sam was sitting on the counter, legs dangling, head down, and hair hanging in his face. He had been like that for the better part of an hour, and her instinct told her to let him be until the last minute - he had a lot to work through considering today's events.
Crowley pretended to think about it for a minute.
"I tried to ask a girl out last week,” Sam said with a smirk. Dean appreciated Sam’s willingness to divert the conversation while he worked up to what he needed to say. He mouthed a silent thank you before starting to laugh.
“Can I help you?” He asked in a low, gravelly voice.
"Do you want me to come in your mouth, or no?"
“Why are you here?” Dean tried to change the subject, and he sounded exasperated.
Cas grabbed the bottle, took a sip, and fixed Dean with his bright eyes: "here's to us."
Cas noticed that Lisa was looking at him again.
"It looks like you can see into forever, doesn't it? Like you could almost see heaven from here?" Dean said, looking up at the sky and breaking the silence between them. "This is where I've come every night since I lost you, Cas. Sometimes I bring a bottle, and sometimes I don't. I wish I had been here last night when you found me, instead of at that roadhouse; this is a much better place to say I love you, isn't it?"
He whispered Cas's name over and over, his hips stuttering. Cas did finally gag, unable to take it all, even though Dean was sure he tried. He excused himself to the bathroom, quilt wrapped around his waist, and Dean could hear him dry heaving down the hall. Despite the fact that he was still coming down from his second mind blowing orgasm of the night, he managed to pull on a pair of boxer briefs and scurry to the kitchen for a glass of water.
"I have a lot to tell you, Sam. Are we still on for our road trip to dad's on Saturday?"
The room fell into silence for a moment while Sam and Jodi let Dean take in all of the information that they had just given him.
He swayed slightly, and reached out to gently touch the angel's face.
"Hey, remember when dad thought you would play professional baseball? He always said you would play for the Angels, since you were named after one?"  Gabriel wasn't poking fun when he shared the memory. They were simultaneously experiencing a rare moment of nostalgia.
"Dean? Are you and Castiel here somewhere?"
Donna disappeared back inside and the innkeeper continued to work on getting Dean free from his saddle and organizing his stableboy to take his horse. He wondered what had brought such a prestigious man here in this condition, and made note to write to Winchester house immediately to alert them of Dean’s situation.
Dean could tell that Castiel was very serious in his question - he was not making fun of him.
Long before the way it has become
Dean kept his eyes focused on the road for several more minutes with Cas’s hand resting softly on him before he couldn’t stand it anymore, and he pulled Baby to the side of the road, fixing Cas with an intentional stare. "C'mere", he said in a husky tone. He leaned across the car and kissed Cas gently, running his fingers along his angel's jaw and down his neck. His hands stopped at the knot of Cas’s loose tie, and Dean pulled him in by it, intensifying the kiss for a moment longer until they were both breathless. Cas didn't want it to end; he leaned in to Dean, exploring the inside of his velvet soft lips with his tongue, holding on to him tightly, tempted to crawl across the seat in to his lap. He whimpered softly, not quite sure what to do next, looking for direction from Dean.
“Yeah. I...want to say I have strong feelings about it. Is it really terrible that I don’t? I don’t feel anything.” Gabriel stared at the table when he said it.
“Home is wherever I’m with you, Cas. After I went for a drive yesterday and talked to Sammy, I finally realized that. For my whole life, I’ve had Sam, but he’s starting his own life now. The next part of the adventure that I want to have is with you. Whether we live at the bunker...or in the Impala...or at the rental house...or here. I don’t care. I don’t care as long as it’s you and me.”
“What’s with you?” Balthazar asked.
“Yeah, ok,” Cas said. “Do you want help cleaning up?”
"You were always looking for a reason to pick on me, Raph. Always." He was surprised by how heated he sounded. "Why is that, huh? Was it because deep down, until I got depressed, you knew I was the favorite? That Chuck liked me better than he liked you? I can't even imagine how much joy my coming out gave you. Because finally...finally you were really rid of me. You're a bad person, Raph. A bully. And I hate you.
"Can I see you when I get back? Is it too soon if I come over tomorrow?"
“I suppose I am hungry again, yes,” Cas said thoughtfully, and followed Sam back to the bunker kitchen to repeat another silent meal with him. He felt tired as he helped Sam clean up, and excused himself to his old room so that he could try and sleep more.
“Did you make quiche from scratch and buy fancy napkins?”
Dean forgot that he hadn't seen Bobby since Lisa left. But Bobby also knew that things had been difficult in his relationship, and the reason for it. He wouldn't be surprised that Lisa was gone, but could see why he would deduce the opposite, seeing as he had Ben with him.
There was a thoughtful silence.
Cas turned the music down some to allow for conversation, but Dean still had to raise his voice slightly to be heard.
Sam chuckled, albeit nervously. “I can think of some things, Dean.”
"So why did  you and Lisa break up, Dean?"
Moments later, Lisa put breakfast on the table.
“My girlfriend left me.”
"Honestly? Does that happen a lot?"
Cas was numb when he stood. His mind was calm, and his body was humming. He wished it had all lasted longer, but he was still terribly satisfied.
"But instead I accidentally asked out the janitor.”
“Ok. We can make it back…we’re close”, Dean whispered hoarsely as he pulled away abruptly, eyes glazed. “Ok?”
“Are you ready, Dean? To settle down?”
This. This is what they had both needed for way too long.
He grabbed his phone so he wouldn't wake Dean, and sauntered sleepily through the living room and into the front yard.
Now he was thinking about Benny. He palmed the front of his jeans, adjusting himself as he thought about the nights that they shared together nearly a decade before. Benny had tended bar with him two nights a week when he lived in downtown Chicago, and friendship had grown into something more.
When he heard someone push open the door, he expected it to be Ben, and was surprised to see Cas standing there.
There was a knock on the door, and a moment later Cas came in...crying. “Oh great, you too? This is going to be a long goddamn day.” Dean pretended to be annoyed, but the real truth was that Cas in a well-fitted suit was going to be a problem today; how was he supposed to focus on anything else when his fiancé looked like
“Are we about to kiss in the rain like some old rom com?” Dean asked, chuckling lightly.
“Maybe this? Maybe Castiel has an explanation for all of this,” Sam said hopefully. He watched Dean open the envelope carefully, as if at any moment it might turn to ash in his hands.
Sam nodded. "Meet you in the tea room in ten minutes?"
He dated women again after that, not finding any satisfaction in his relationships with any of them until he met Lisa. They hit it off, entering into more of an intimate friendship than a romantic relationship, and soon after they started dating, she found out she was pregnant. They hadn’t had sex, so Dean knew it wasn’t his. But the fact that he stuck around when the Baby's father refused to step up meant a whole lot more to her than any of the other stuff, and so it worked...for awhile. But eventually their lackluster sex life started taking a toll.
Dean’s mind continued to wander through the last few years of his life, and he leaned his head on the back of the couch, closing his eyes and trying to think about happier things. It didn’t really work, and instead he surrendered to the hopelessness he had been fighting all night.
"Yeah, I remember." Cas squeezed Gabriel’s arm, hoping he would stop, and breathed a sigh of relief when he did.
“Where’s Castiel?” He asked again, panic in his voice.
She liked this new, unplanned approach. The mystery of it...letting Dean stew on it for a little bit. She knew he currently had other problems to sort out. She wanted his mind clear when they talked about their future.
"Safe travels, brother. Write to us if you can? We want to know that you're journeying safely. May God be with you." Sam patted Baby's flank as Dean rode off, hoping with everything that he had that Dean would return safely and in one piece.
"I will just meet you at your house, OK? I’ll give you a heads up when I’m on my way?"
“And...are there other angels who are going to try and kill me now, since you couldn’t?”
Dean looked up at Cas’s face then because he heard him say something in an unfamiliar language. It startled him, and he received an even greater shock when he saw that Cas's eyes were shining a bright, cosmic blue as he came down from the intensity of his orgasm.
"Shouldn't we talk first? About my leaving, I mean?" Cas breathed.
Today there was someone else at the park this early; a thin, pretty woman, probably in her mid-thirties, with a thoughtful expression. She was watching a small, dark haired boy about Ben's age going down the twirly slide.
They played in silence for the first few rounds, betting more enthusiastically than they should so early on.
“Always.”
"How long have you been apart, if you don't mind me asking?"
"Are you...playing Scrabble?" He finally asked.
The moment was soon interrupted by Sam and his fair lady friend, Eileen Lehey, as they strode into the room with enthusiasm, laughing at something or other, waltzing their way over to where Dean and his mysterious stranger stood.
Balthazar and Gabriel were already in the kitchen making drinks and preheating the oven to make frozen pizza when Sam and Dean finished setting up the table. They were familiar with the routine.
“You don’t...like this?” Cas sounded disappointed as she looked down.
"You made quite the impression."
"Can I please just have a week? Just a week. I can pay you."
As long as I got you and me
“The artists’ quarter. At Jack’s crossing. You couldn’t miss it - it’s the only unmarked building there. I’m having a soiree there on Friday evening if you want to come by. Just a few friends. And some art, of course.”
Gabriel watched him, eyebrow raised, fork pausing halfway to his mouth quite often as he watched Cas eat impressive amounts.
As much as the "Hell yes" wanted to escape his lips, Dean stopped himself.
He held back tears as the car slowed to an uncompromising stop and hissed mournfully. He looked around, attempting to see where he was. He recognized the neighborhood, but he knew he wasn’t close enough to Naomi’s house to walk the rest of the way. He picked up his phone to call her and tell her he still planned on making it. The screen of his phone remained black. It was dead. He really did start to cry a little bit now - he was going to lose another job.
“Can I use your phone to call my boss while mine charges? I want to see if I’m fired. I was supposed to have her dry cleaning at her house by 9pm."
"Hey, Dean?"
"Actually, I changed my mind about them."
Bobby hesitates for a moment, then shakes his head. “No, it's fine. You're too solid to be a ghost and no shifter would know about... the body thing.”
“I have no idea,” Dean answers honestly. “Where are you? I'll come to you, I'm in the middle of nowhere.”
car?” Dean asks, rhetorically. Sam better not have done anything to Baby. “Sure, I'm at the gas station about an hour's walk from... y'know.”
“I can't believe you just gave up without even trying!” Sam feels his hands curling into fists and he forces them out flat on his knees again.
Dean makes a sound with his nose. “God? God never did anything for me.” Which is manifestly untrue, of course. How can Dean even think that way? Questions and small doubts are understandable. Even Castiel has those. But this attitude is completely baffling.
Heaven has for me!”
Did Sam do this somehow? How did he know?
In answer, Castiel touches his forehead to send him to sleep. He collapses beside the other man.
“I'm an angel of the Lord,” Castiel explains.
Dean asks, voice sharp, “And you didn't think to call and let us know you weren't dead?” He waves the cell phone in his hand.
. Why?”
Sam shakes his head. He still has that guilty look in his eyes but Dean can't deal with it right now.
Dean blinks. “What—” He looks around Cas to where Dad is lying on the floor. With his eyes burned out. Not breathing.
Silence falls abruptly. Dean uncovers his ears. Is he deaf? But the pressure is gone too and he can hear his boots scuff against the litter of broken glass as he stands up. He's never experienced anything like that before.
“No such thing.”
“About what?” Bobby asks.
“I... I tried to,” Sam stammers. It's hard to catch his breath. “I tried
“What? No. I'd be stuck there too.” She isn't making sense.
“Bobby, just listen to me,” Dean says.
Dean nods. “Let's get to work then. I'd rather summon this thing before dark, if we can.”
Castiel brings one wing forward to look at it in wonder. It moves smoothly, effortlessly. The feathers are whole and perfect and as black as the night sky. The wing itself is outlined in a fading golden light.
“Yeah, Dee, everything's okay. I wish I'd known before, but I'm glad you told me.” Sam smiles at him.
“I am summoned. We're beginning another attack,” Cas says, then meets Dean's eyes. “If you call for me, I will come.”
“Hmm? Oh, you break out, of course,” Rowena says.
“Who else could it have been?” the man in front of him asks.
“I know where you are,” Sam says quietly.
He claws his way to the surface somehow, drags himself out of the earth. He's gasping and crawling and everything feels too solid, too realistic.
Jack's wings droop a little in disappointment. “Okay,” he says, obviously reluctant.
Rowena crosses her legs and looks coyly over at Dean through her eyelashes. “Bit off more than it can chew, I suspect. A dying Death, no problem. A meddlesome angel—”
Sam's phone rings again and Dean lets it go to voicemail.
Instead of saying all that, Dean asks, “How do I help Cas and Jack get out of the Empty?”
Dean opens his mouth but nothing comes out. The truth is, he never let himself think about it. Ever. No point to it, with Cas gone again. And now Dean's dead again and in Hell again, and he can still barely think about it.
Sam's brow furrows. “But you're—oh.” He blinks at Dean. “Really?”
It's the amulet Sam gave Dean when they were kids. The one Dean wore every day since then. “Thanks,” he says, touched.
Ruby shrugs. “It could be. I have no idea what it is though.”
Sam drops the knife. His mind is whirling. Only one coherent thought emerges: he doesn't care anymore if this is a trap. For even a
Sam cries out again. He clutches at Dean.
Sam nods. “It shouldn't be that hard to modify them.” He turns to go back to the library.
Bobby nods. “Suits him.” He stands up. “You've been good about all this.”
“I don't believe you,” Dean says, his stomach a cold knot.
Dean stares at Castiel for a long moment. “Not exactly 'father of the year' over here,” he says at last.
Sam isn't in the room. Where did he go?
Dean pulls back a little. Sam lets go and takes a step back. “What happened?” he asks, his eyes searching.
Before Dean can respond, he feels the fire of Cas' Grace flowing into him again. Dean sighs in relief as the pain in his arm disappears, closing his eyes for a second.
Jack stretches one hand up, his wings spread defiantly. Castiel resists the urge to pull back out of reach. Very, very gently, Jack's fingertips brush the edge of Castiel's right wing. His eyes glow golden.
Dean remembers his father's body on the floor with a sickening jolt. Before he can figure out how to answer Bobby, another awful cry comes out of Sam. Dean hears Bobby running across the room and he appears a second later.
Sam snorts. “You never wear clothes that fit anyway.” He bites his lip. “Oh, uh, sorry.”
Dean examines the bottle in his hand and cautiously takes another sip. It tastes the same as he remembers. “You always put holy water in your guests' drinks?” he asks.
“Hello Dean.”
“Dean,” his brother says, immediately.
There's a click.
“Of course,” Castiel says.
Bobby narrows his eyes. “Am I supposed to know you?”
“The demon blood—” Sam starts but Dean cuts him off.
“Pick me up in
“What happens now?” Dean asks.
it. Dean was closer to Dad, distracted him while Sam crawled behind the desk, stood in his way. Watched him die.
“Will you even disbelieve your own eyes?” Castiel asks, taking a few steps away. With concentration, a small fragment of angelic Grace is revealed, producing a crash of thunder and flash of lightning. For a moment, Dean perceives Castiel's wings. To prevent injury, Castiel folds fully back into the vessel.
Dad had the knife. He had the knife and the gun and Bobby wasn't here. Dean wasn't going to be in the house either, Baby's engine has a rattle he doesn't like, but Sam was talking his ear off about some lore he found so Dean got sucked in for longer than he thought. Which means Dad planned this.
Dean blinks, losing his staring contest with the house. “
“They were for my... uh.” Dean opens the door a little more and gestures at his chest.
Dean smiles back. “Definitely not my favourite wake-up call but oh well. I'm gonna go make coffee, since it looks like we're up for the day now.” He waves at the warding sketches and leaves for the kitchen.
Dean raises his hands slowly so Dad can see them. “All my life, you told me to take care of Sammy,” Dean says, trying to keep his voice steady. “So, here I am. That's what I'm doing.”
“I've always known,” Dee says, after a while of driving in silence. He doesn't look at Sam. “Ever since I was a little kid. Even before.”
“What? I'm not a demon, Sam!”
He disappears with a faint whoosh of invisible wings. The room feels so empty without him.
“No!” Dean yells. “He isn't! He's still your son!”
“How am I supposed to know?” Sam asks, which is fair.
“Cas?” Dean asks, bewildered.
Dean doesn't know what he's talking about. “Those what?”
“Yeah, why not?”
He isn't really talking to Cas, but Cas is still here so he asks, “How do you know?”
In the spare room, Sam's in bed. He starts pushing back the covers when he sees Dean in the doorway.
The vessel encumbers Castiel, for all it is strong enough to contain angelic Grace. So long without one and then the sudden necessity is a source of irritation. To speak with Dean directly would be preferable. Two unsuccessful attempts at contact is one too many, Castiel knows. Regrettably, the vessel is necessary.
“I don't look the same,” Dean says. Understatement of the century. “But it's me, Dee Winchester.” He can't bring himself to say his deadname right now.
The demon waves as Sam pulls in. He's grinning. “Nice ride!” he calls over the noise of the Impala's engine.
“Get out of my way, Dean,” Dad says. His voice is low and cold.
Dean stops himself from asking again if Sam's sure. He'd hoped not to be rejected, of course, but he didn't let himself count on it. He can't really be this lucky, can he?
A much colder breeze than before blows against Castiel, making the coat flap. The temperature difference is clearly there but Castiel doesn't feel it in the same way as before. Bending down, Castiel picks up a handful of snow. It is cold but Castiel's skin doesn't burn with it or turn red. The snow melts quickly and begins to drip off the fingers. Definitely more power than before.
Sam's eyebrows rise so far they almost reach his hairline. He looks from Dean to Castiel, like he's trying to figure something out.
Dean can feel Sam looking at him without turning his head. “I'm back,” he manages to croak.
It's a trick, a trap, a lie. More of his old habits bubble up and Dean tries to move. His hand goes into his jeans pocket. His fingers close around his lighter. It shouldn't be there. Is this a choose-your-own-torture session? Where he's manifesting what he expects to find? He hates those the most. Too damn creative for his own good.
Jack takes off and again, Castiel follows. The second flight is just as wonderful as the first. Right up until Castiel hits an unexpected barrier.
Castiel agrees. It
“You're back,” Sam breathes, as he steps forward to throw his arms around Dee.
Anger burns through Sam. How dare something mark Dean like that? He turns to Bobby. “Do you have somewhere in mind for the summoning?” he asks.
They have. He hasn't had one since before Dean died. “Me too,” Sam says, grateful to be able to tell that much of the truth.
Slowly, Dean walks out of the clearing. His shoulders are tensed, waiting for an attack.
terrific to have the Righteous Man back on Earth and ready to fulfill his purpose.
Sam nods. “Me too.”
“Oh god. Sammy!” Dean cries. He almost falls in his hurry to check Sam's breathing and pulse. Cas crouches to lay his hands on the wound.
Dean needs more information. And that reminds him: there's another call he needs to make.
Sam stands up. He's not sure how to respond. He doesn't have much experience with this kind of thing.
And wait, didn't Bobby say Cas helped make this place? But Cas is in the Empty. Chuck never had any authority there and so Jack wouldn't either. Would he? Something is wrong.
Dad levels the shotgun at Dean's chest. Dean freezes. “Not anymore. He's tainted,” Dad says.
He drives faster than he should. Sam was on his way to Pontiac, Illinois already. Ruby let him know something big went down around there this morning. They planned to meet up but that can wait.
Sam starts to argue but Dean elbows him, taking a half-step forward. “Not a trick, Bobby,” he says. He has to tell him now. Now or never. “This is the body I always wanted. I'm trans,” Dean says. He feels sick. This is it.
“Did you honestly expect to go anywhere else?” Rowena asks.
Dean throws holy water in his father's face. Dad splutters and coughs as some of it goes up his nose. There's no other effect. Dean's last desperate hope that this isn't Dad, that Dad
Dean shakes himself. It's over, he's out. No point in dwelling on it now.
“Yeah,” Dean says again. “I guess I am.” He clears his throat. “Yes, I am.”
Dean stares after him. Sam enters the house, grinning over his shoulder.
Sam nods. “Well, thank god for that.”
He parks in front of the diner. Ruby taps on the passenger window a few minutes later then gets in the car. “Almost gave you up,” she says.
Now it's Dean's turn to stare. “
all the shit with Ruby. Dad wasn't homicidal the last time they saw him, though he was still angry with Dean for going to Hell.
“Yeah,” Dean says. He needs a distraction so they can stop talking about this. “So, are you on the trail of anything right now?”
“Cas, are you okay? What happened?” Jack asks.
Sam pulls on the duffle bag strap. Dean doesn't let go of it.
“Sammy, you know that knife will kill a human just as easy as a demon,” the demon says, obviously trying to sound reasonable.
“I think I'll go for a drive,” Dean says. Bobby, if it even is Bobby, nods.
Jack grins. “Not alone. But you're right here!”
you've ever asked me!”
“They don't hurt,” Castiel lies. “It was years ago, Jack, before you were born.”
“Well, Cas?” Sam asks.
Bobby salutes him with his bottle and drinks from it. “Holy water. You only need to add a tiny bit because—”
“We should summon it,” Dean says.
Dean blinks and Castiel is gone. He looks around the dark barn but he's the only one left standing. “Oh, he can teleport too. Awesome,” Dean says under his breath.
Sam drinks his beer faster than he normally would. It's a relief the holy water has no effect on him. Proof he hasn't gone too far yet.
Flopping over on the grass, Dean is confronted with a dazzling blue sky. He squints at it while he catches his breath. He wouldn't have thought of
-----
“Dean. He chose it.”
Dean focuses on his hand and the lighter goes out. He blinks the distorted afterimage away.
“I woke up remembering it. I guess I had a vision,” Sam lies.
There's silence for a minute and Dean wonders if Sam hung up. Then he says, “No,” so vehemently that Dean takes a step back.
“Bobby!” Sam Winchester yells. He runs forward. Castiel reaches out to send him to sleep as well.
Dean doesn't know how to respond. Bobby pats him once and moves away.
“You always wear them, I don't know what they're called,” Sam says, a little impatient.
“Do you want to see mine too?” Jack asks, eagerly.
“The demon blood is reacting to my Grace,” Cas says without looking at Dean, his teeth clenched. He makes a pushing motion with his hands, like he's trying to force more light into Sam's leg.
Cas feels the wet label of the bottle under his thumb, the bright green of Dean’s eyes matching the glass in his hand. His eyes track the curve of his nose down to his lips and his thumb moves, back and forth, across the slowly disintegrating label, and he thinks about the tiny diner booths, a basket of fries, a bag of M&Ms torn open wide enough to fit two hands at once.
“Alright, cool.” Dean pats his shoulder and moves away. “Meet me out front in five with Beth, we can just go together. I don’t want you driving, anyway.”
"Yeah," Cas echoes. His voice is deep and right next to Dean's ear. He turns his head towards it.
me, writing this: haha i can put a michael phelps joke in here.
“Dean.” Cas’s voice isn’t a warning, but he hears the tone for what it is.
“You’re very distracting,” he says, distinctly realizing that now would be a great time for the ground to swallow him up. Dean stares at him. “I’m sorry. I try to pay attention, really, I just -”
“By the way, you hear about that up and comer hunter?” Dean asks as he’s packing up his stuff.
She shoves the gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger.
If Ben thee Edlund can give us the Rhonda Hurley line then I'm allowed to give Dean a weirdly close male friendship that he couldn't parse out the meaning of until he had his bisexual awakening years later. I know this could've also been Lee, but once we get past like, s9 the spn canon can get so weirdly convoluted that I just play a game of darts to determine which facts actually happened and which got shoehorned in by the writers. Also Bobby was not around when Lee was and I wanted them to have this Moment.
hey besties, we are back to some metaphysical nonsense and also acknowledging that cas is a peach <3 - enjoy!
Dean doesn’t get the radio fixed until about an hour later. He doesn’t talk, but he hums as he works, some song about biting the dust, Cas thinks, dazedly. Every few minutes he shoots Cas a smirk from where he’s laying in the backseat until the radio’s new and improved - Dean’s word, not his - and they take it for a spin.
They burn the remains to not give the locals any ideas, and drive off into the night. Dean feels blood crusting under his fingernails, his shoulder pulling from where one of the things pinned him down, just before John shot it.
"Who?"
says a voice, like needles in his brain, and he jolts. “Dean?”
For those of you who are wondering why a Faith rewrite happened earlier than in the s1 show - I did go back and forth on this a lot, but overall the main storyline of s1 is only connected by a handful of episodes, and in the timeline of s1 (and later seasons of course), the spn canon does seem like, a little off? An example is that in Asylum Sam says they've been searching for dad for six months, which, considering the Pilot happened Halloween weekend, puts them at the beginning of May, but in the next episode Scarecrow, they reference that the missing people are taken the first week of April. Also I get this is just a 'they film this show in Canada during who knows what time of year' thing, but in Route 666 which happens at some point in April/May, one would think, it's snowing. In the terms of this story, I felt Faith is better off happening earlier, and considering the episodes that get shuffled around are stand alone MOTW eps, I felt like it could've been more about which cases Sam and Dean stumbled across first. Hopefully that makes sense and doesn't take you out of the fic! :)
Sam has so many questions. He holds them back for now.
“He better be,” Dean says. The threat in his voice causes Castiel to smile slightly. This protective instinct will be valuable in the coming battles.
Dean turns on Cas, who is inches away. “What's happening?”
“Yeah, of course it's me. You've been dodging my calls all this time.”
“He did it on purpose!” Cas snaps.
. But no demon would deal. It's been months and Dee's still...” He trails off, staring.
Bobby takes a deep breath. “Oh, that's why you're here, huh?” he asks. He doesn't wait for an answer, just waves vaguely toward the living room. “I'll get you boys some beer,” he says, and turns toward the kitchen.
“Oh, this is weird,” Dean breathes. “I didn't think... it would be like this.”
Castiel nods. “I made a few minor adjustments.”
“Come here then,” Bobby says, bending down quickly to help Sam to his feet. “Better to do that in the bathroom.”
In Bobby's living room, Dean pours himself a drink. He stares at the blood stains on the floor and tries not to think about all the things he can't tell Sam.
me.” Dean wracks his brain for something to convince him. Then he remembers a codeword for when they were in trouble. “Funkytown, okay? But I'm fine.”
Sam smiles. “Yes, Cas, of course I want to see them.”
“Dean?” Sam asks, blearily. “What happened?” His eyes widen as he remembers. Dean wishes he could take the memory away.
“I'm the one who gripped you tight and raised you from perdition.” Castiel can see the handprint on Dean through his clothing. He will carry it always upon his soul, whether it is visible on his skin or not. An unintentional effect but a strangely satisfying one. Evidence to prove who pulled him out of Hell.
Dean hangs up. Bobby will worry but he sounds worried already.
Jack's grin warms Castiel like the tropical sun. “That's okay, Dean. Sorry I woke you up.”
Sam stiffens. “I'm nothing like he was,” he says.
“Jack? What's going on?” Sam calls, arms still over his head.
Sam's eyes widen. “Oh.”
“Not in my experience. Why?” Dean asks again.
“This is the Heaven you deserve,” Bobby says.
“Your friend is alive,” Castiel reassures Dean.
“I kind of had to tell you,” Dean says. “Jesus, this is insane.” He runs his hand through his hair. Dirt sprinkles the ground beside him.
“Dean,” Cas says again.
Castiel frowns. “This is where I want to be.” Dean has to know that by now. Even without understanding how Castiel truly feels about him.
“Uh,” Dean says, because he can't think of anything else.
“Great. I'll come back tomorrow and—”
Dean sits in the grass, stunned absolutely speechless. He can't believe it. It can't be real. Except he's starting to sweat in his jacket under the sun and his cramped muscles are starting to
Dean tenses. Fight or flight, he isn't sure which.
Jack and Sam inspect the change as Castiel lowers the pencil, though it's likely they don't understand it. “All good otherwise?” Sam asks.
wanted me to have this body now,” he asks.
-----
“When you say 'we', you don't mean you and me anymore, do you?” Ruby asks.
Dad smiles grimly. “I have to be sure.”
Even after so long in Hell, Dean remembers Sam's number.
Castiel can't help but smile back. “I am.” The sea breeze ruffles Jack's hair and Castiel can feel tropical sun on skin much more used to winter darkness. It's a beautiful day.
Sam staggers back, Dean pushes between Sam and Castiel. “So talk,” he says, anger sharpening his words. “How do you know my name? Who are you?”
“And after?” Sam asks.
It's always... unsettling. Dean should be used to it by now. He can't shake the feeling that Cas isn't looking at
“No, Sam, I mean I'm proud of you,” Bobby says, sounding a bit exasperated. He walks around the desk.
The music stops on its own. “Well, that was quick,” Rowena says, from beside him.
Bobby nods. “And how'd you get it?” he asks.
“Uh huh,” Dean says, “Is that because of your freaky ESP crap?”
His hands are shaking so he pushes them into his pockets. He tries to push his emotions down the same way. An actual angel dragged him out of Hell. The absolute last thing he would have expected.
Cas stays too close as they round the corner of the desk. Sam is lying there scarily still. One leg of his jeans is soaked in blood around the tourniquet made from his belt.
“For saving Sam,” Dean clarifies. “He would've... so thanks.”
Oh. Of course he does. “Why'd you bury me?” Dean asks, without meaning to.
“Don't you tell me what to do. You failed me,” Dad says.
He's wrong. But Sam can't say so without sounding like he's proving Bobby's point. Instead, he says, “Well, everything's back to normal now.”
“It doesn't matter,” Cas answers firmly.
Jack pops back into the world on a deserted beach. Castiel easily lands beside him and grabs his sleeve. It's full daylight here, halfway around the world. “Jack,” Castiel says, trying to sound stern and half-laughing instead. “You know you aren't supposed to leave Kansas unless it's an emergency.”
Sam blinks at him. Dean never mentioned anything weird happening there.
“It's come after me twice already. I say we go on the offensive,” Dean says.
Cas' hand doesn't withdraw when the healing is over. Dean opens his eyes. Cas is staring at him.
The demon clears his throat. “Uh, so I don't know if you meant this to happen or what.”
He doesn't see Cas walk over but he's there, bending down to touch Dad's body. Then, they both disappear.
-----
Dean looks up. “What?”
A flick, and a tongue of flame illuminates his situation. Lying down in a box. He touches the too-close top above him with his free hand, the rough grain of the wood against his fingertips. It feels real. It always does.
The man staring back at him isn't quite a stranger. Dean imagined looking like this a thousand times. His eyes are the same, his nose. His mouth is a bit thinner, the shape of his face a little changed. It doesn't look unnatural. His reflection smiles. He kind of looks like Sam when he smiles.
Sam's phone rings. Dean picks it up. He's curious about who Sam was talking to before. “Hello?”
“He's breathing,” Sam reports. He stares up at Castiel. “What are you?” he asks.
“What?” Dean asks, going tense again.
“We need to talk, Dean. Alone,” Castiel says.
Why can't he let it go? “Good things do happen, Dean,” Castiel deflects.
Castiel pauses. Sam hits out with all his strength, bolstered by the demon blood still in his system. The impact of his weapon has no effect on the vessel.
Behind them, the front door bangs open. “What in the hell is going on?!” Bobby calls.
?” Bobby asks.
Sam rolls his eyes. “That isn't how it works, Dean.”
Darkness. Stillness. He's alone.
them to rework it, but it's still too heavy-handed to be believable. Amateurs. No craftsmanship.”
Dean hangs up slowly. It's not like he expects a parade celebrating his return but Sam's reaction was so matter-of-fact. More evidence it was his intervention that brought Dean back. He hopes they'll have better luck breaking Sam's deal than they did with his.
Cas' head jerks up. His blue eyes seem to burn. “You asked me to heal him so that's what I am doing,” he says, his voice frustrated.
Rowena blinks at him. “You aren't? Why not?”
If this is a dream, it's a damn good one.
“I don't have another mark on me, so I'd say it's not from Hell,” Dean says. He shrugs away from Sam and Bobby.
“Huh,” Sam says, watching Dean go. “That was... new.”
Dean exhales a breath he didn't realize he was holding. Sam's alive. “Hey, Sammy, it's me,” Dean says, then realizes Sam won't recognize his voice now.
“Where the hell are you?” Dean pants.
Dean reenters the house, loaded down with duffle bags that clank as he moves. “I've got a bit of everything,” he says. “Where should we set up?”
It's hot. Dean takes off his jacket and ties it around his waist. He grins down at himself. He can't help it. He hasn't felt this free in years. Or ever, really.
Dean makes a sudden grab for the gun with his good hand. A brief tug-of-war and Dad tosses it aside.
“Why shouldn't I kill you?” Sam yells. “You robbed my sister's grave!”
“Only because I dug myself out of it! And
“It's safe to look now,” Castiel says.
Dean's glare is fierce. “What makes me so special then?”
“That's not much to go on,” Bobby says, dubiously.
Dean clutches the desk for balance. Cas is back in an instant, standing beside Dean now. Too close, like usual.
Dean pulls up his shirt. He's relieved to see his anti-possession tattoo has transferred over. His abs are magnificent. No scars from his death by hell hounds. No scars at all.
The demon gestures at himself, and that's when it clicks. He's wearing Dee's clothes.
“Mission accomplished, I guess.” Dean says, trying to keep his tone light.
“You sound weird,” Sam says.
“Who was that? Bobby?” Dean asks.
“Did you find out anything?” Sam asks.
Sam sighs and sits back down on his bed. “Well, I did come here tracking some demons.”
“You asked for this body. Years ago. With the power of Heaven behind me, I could change your circumstances.” Castiel does not regret the decision. Heaven will need the strength of every warrior soon so any punishment will not be debilitating. Besides, this change once done cannot be undone easily and that is what is truly important.
“Who else?” Sam asks.
Dean catches Bobby's movement out of the corner of his eye, and glances up to see him setting his bottle gently down on the desk. It clinks against another glass bottle already there, the tiny sound loud in the silence. Even Sam seems to be holding his breath.
“You're not going to,” Sam promises.
Dean smiles at his tone. It's comfortingly familiar.
It's unclear whether this sameness is a good thing to Dean or not. Castiel settles for saying, “Perhaps it will be useful.”
Dean breathes out. “Like I said on the phone, I have no idea. Except, well...” He doesn't know how to say this.
The words hit Dean with a sickening lurch. He keeps smiling, not wanting to let it show. Alarm bells are going off in his head now. The Heaven
Dean crosses his arms, empty beer bottle dangling from one hand. “And how could you possibly have heard that?” he asks, glaring challengingly at Sam.
Dean clears his throat. Castiel wonders if he needs some water. “Hey, Jack, I... I wanted to tell you: that was kind of you. To want to heal Cas. And yeah, it was sort of reckless but I overreacted. Sorry.”
Dean hitches one of the bags higher on his shoulder as he rolls his eyes. Sam notices something weird as the short sleeve of his T-shirt moves up.
Jack asks Sam, “Why didn't I need one of those?”
After complaining about the iPod jack, Dee's been pretty quiet. Sam tries to pretend he isn't watching him. Dee looks more comfortable in his skin than Sam's ever seen him. But that makes sense now. A lot of things make more sense now.
Dean points to the knife. Cas wanders over to look, though he doesn't touch it.
Dean follows Sam inside. Bobby's house hasn't changed. Stacks of books, papers, and weapons everywhere, including the floor. Dean keeps expecting everything to be different.
Jack whirls around, his wings curving down around his own shoulders protectively. After a fumbling moment, Castiel remembers how to shift wings out of the human visual light spectrum. It's trickier than just becoming completely invisible. This consideration hasn't been necessary during the last few years of low power. Jack's healing has done more than change the appearance of Castiel's wings.
“Who's this?” Bobby asks, finally.
“Yeah, we're gonna risk our necks like normal to find out more about something that wants to kill us,” Bobby says, grimacing.
“Who's 'we' anyway?” Dean asks. “And why bring me back from Hell?”
Sam's honestly a little insulted. “How else could I be? He's my brother.” Though it still feels strange to use that word.
“Yeah, that's... we can talk when I get to you.” Dean is
Rowena laughs. “You can't keep a Winchester locked up. I've been around all of you long enough to know that. I would have mentioned it to the Empty but the poor dear is so cranky lately.”
The grass doesn't answer. The ant has no comment. The sky is completely indifferent.
He's left gasping as the pressure wave recedes. Dean staggers to his feet. He grabs the room phone and dials Sam's number.
Dean doesn't even remember falling asleep fully dressed on top of the covers. The static of the TV wakes him up. He can feel pressure in his chest. He gropes around for a shotgun but can't find one.
As he puts it on, Sam asks, hesitantly, “Hey Dean, what was it like?”
Sam's breathing is ragged but he nods. “I can finish the old-fashioned way,” he gasps.
Only one demon is visible. He's leaning against the gas station wall, watching the road and fiddling with something on his hand. Sam feels a surge of rage because he remembers seeing Dee stand like that a thousand times when they were waiting for something, twisting her silver beer-bottle-opening ring. It was too big for her. Sam told her once she should wear it on her thumb. Somehow, that was the wrong thing to say. They buried her with that ring on the correct finger.
“Cas isn't... we aren't...” Dean stammers. He used to just shrug off that mistake.
“Of course you did, I'm awesome,” Dean says. Sam isn't sure if he's being sarcastic or if he means it.
“Terrific,” Dean says.
It's a trap. It's so obviously a trap, too. Sam is furious that they think he's stupid enough to fall for this. The demon on the phone didn't even try to sound like Dee. 'We can talk', yeah, right. Anyone who met her would know
“Give me a silver knife, I'll set your mind at ease,” Dean says to Bobby.
“Well, let's find out,” Sam says. He's too angry to concentrate on a psychic exorcism so the knife will have to do. Besides, he wants to gut this one.
“A lot of people hurt me on purpose! It's a part of life!” Dean yells. His mind is reeling.
“Is that what brought my sister out of Hell?” Sam asks. He catches the slip of the tongue too late, then thinks better of revealing Dean's body change and gender identity to Ruby. They're doing good work together but he doesn't fully trust her.
Bobby leans against the front of his desk, instead of sitting behind it.
“Sammy, it
Lying on his back is no good right now. Dean sits up, ready to push himself to his feet, and freezes. His hands. Encrusted with dirt, nails broken, knuckles bloodied, but looking better than he's ever seen them. He flexes his fingers in wonder. They're bigger, broader, more... masculine.
Dean doesn't want to ask Sam if he's been using his weird powers but Sam must see the question on his face because he goes on, “And no, I haven't been using it. I know you didn't—don't want that.”
Nothing happens. Dean waits, every muscle tense. The song starts again:
Bobby glances at him. “But I can ask if you want. See if they'd talk to you about it,” he says.
Bobby lets go. “You scared me, going off on your own like that. Reminded me of your old man.”
Castiel bends over the paper to avoid talking about it. Sam and Jack have done fairly well integrating the syllables of Castiel's name into the wards. There's just one small correction to make. Castiel picks up a pencil and makes a tiny adjustment to one of the name's sigils: changing the meaning from 'shield of God' to 'shield of what is most important'. In a rough translation of Enochian, it wouldn't make a difference. The assumption of most angels would be that God is always most important so the distinction would be unnecessary to them. Castiel disagrees.
His phone rings on the passenger seat. Sam doesn't even glance at it. It's Bobby's ringtone. Sam hasn't picked up a call from him in weeks. Maybe months now. There's no point.
Breathing is just a little harder now, the air stale. He can't suppress a rasping call for help, though of course, no one will. Dean hits the top of the box. After a few punches, it breaks, dirt tumbling down onto him. He's been buried alive. That's when the panic sets in.
“It's true, Bobby,” Sam says. “He's alive.”
Dean catches Castiel's eye. “Cas, a word?” he asks, jerking his head toward the dormitory hallway.
“Wow,” Jack says, staring up behind Castiel.
Dean can't handle this. It's too much. “And you're trying to control me too!” he snarls, lashing out. “If I died, you'd have to go to Hell to get me back because of the
