“You’re behind the ball,” Mary says. “He was in the background in Molly’s Instagram story for a second yesterday, and everyone on Twitter has been speculating about who it could have been.”
“My joints are sore because I’m old and got shot. Your joints are sore because your system is flooded with hormones and they’re relaxing your pelvis out of alignment with itself until your bones grind up against each other.”
“Did you hear what Anderson is skating to?” John says to Sherlock, when they are on the bus en route to the gym.
This chapter was unacceptably delayed by my life being absolutely slammed on all fronts. Here we are. This chapter title was actually nearly the fic title, but Working on the Edges is already a skating-related Johnlock fic, and I thought it was too similar. Sherlock's quote here is actually something my coach said when I was whinging about being scared of falling on my butt while working on edgework. My friend who I take lessons with and I were immediately like "damn, that's deep," and I filed it away to use in some gay fanfiction somewhere.
John keeps scrolling through @_queen_yuna’s feed. It’s a combination of skating GIFs and opinions, Korean idols, Korean dramas, and cute animals. The skating content is chiefly Korean skaters with a few scattered Canadians, Europeans, and Americans. There are hardly any Japanese athletes at all.
As soon as he’s stepped into his mohawk to prep for the salchow, John’s nerves settle. His last thought is wordless, just the general sensation of the throwing of caution to the wind, and then he has no thoughts at all.
“Yes, down the hall to the right. Go ahead and get unpacked.” Sherlock straightens and runs his fingers through his hair. “I, er, used it for storage a bit. The place came furnished, so there’s a bed and such. I can
Sherlock wrinkles his nose. He hates the way it feels, but he does get horribly itchy if he skips it for too long. "If you rub it in."
that John briefly bitches about. The strap was apparently famously uncomfortable, and padding it or even soaping it to make it chafe less merited disciplinary action.
“That’s a +1 grade of execution if we’re being honest,” he says. “Maybe a +2 if the judges are generous.”
“Yeah, I heard you just fine. How exactly do I have those, what with my total lack of a previous season to earn me them?”
He goes down the hall to his bedroom, drags a suitcase and a backpack out from under the bed, and starts stuffing them full of his earthly possessions. Sherlock’s right, there isn’t much. Honestly it’s just his clothes and laptop. Everything else is easily replaced. He takes just a few of the medals from the wall and adds them to the disorganized jumble of clothes. His skating gear is in the bag in his trunk already. His trunk—oh, hell, what is he going to do with his car? Sherlock has a plan for everything. Surely he’s thought of that.
“Tell me your on-ice warm-up is an improvement on your off-ice,” Sherlock says, when John has skated over to meet him.
Sherlock does not say anything for a second, then he clears his throat and says, “You’re going to be fine. The yoga will help.”
John follows him up the stairs, through another door, and into the living area of a modestly-sized flat.
“Yes!” Sherlock shouts, as John works through the transition from his first combination into his quad salchow, marking the jumps. “Wait, wait. Come here.”
The melody is unpredictable but infectious. John realizes the corner of his mouth is tugging upwards in an involuntary smile. Greg catches his eye, and John sees he is smiling as well.
The piano crescendos into a long line of cluster chords leading up, with the violin following, and then both decrescendo as they step down, down, down. Then there is that sharp trill and run from the beginning again, this time with more flourishes from the piano. The music launches into a variation on the first section that incorporates elements from the second, with more for both instruments to do and a more complex percussion line. The performances are both technically and expressively impressive. Finally, there is a sudden decrescendo, and then the music swells into a triumphant climax with one last chord from the piano and a high note on the violin.
A picture of a teenager with a Pixie Stick arranged like a line of cocaine, straw in nostril and poised over the powder, with the caption, “@sholmes before 2014 Nats.”
He wakes up when Sherlock opens his door, although he does not open his eyes. He suspects that opening his eyelids might hurt. Breathing definitely does, and the concept of moving his actual limbs is entirely foreign.
“John’s waited seven years, Sherlock, he can wait another two minutes,” Greg says. “Guys, go ahead and take lunch.”
“Okay, wonderful, it’s coming along, let’s go.” He takes John’s arm so John is forced to follow him. “Start as if you’re coming out of the combination.”
“I love you,” John nearly says, but he will wait until later. Instead, he says, “Come on, baby. Yeah, you beautiful thing,” and Sherlock pierces himself on John’s cock and sinks down.
“You want to take an athlete who has, basically, been cryogenically frozen for the last seven years and you think you’re going to get him—”
“Yes, very nice, we’re all just the best of friends,” Sherlock says impatiently. “Let’s all just go out for tea and biscuits and forget all about our jobs.”
Sherlock, for the first time in his life, has the easy weight advantage on John. It looks like a simple matter to push John back onto the bed, though it appears considerably more complicated climbing up after him.
John goes to bed still stuck on the idea of Sherlock with someone. His imagination has moved beyond trying to put him in cafes with pretty girls or boys and towards standing at someone’s front door, giving them a kiss good night. The image doesn’t play at all when it’s Sherlock and a woman, but a man, wiry and athletic and attractive? It’s less unthinkable.
He had more to say, but it is stopped on his lips by Sherlock pressing a kiss to them, insistent and tender. John lets his eyes drift shut and loses himself in the kiss. He lets Sherlock back him into the door and press the full length of his body to his. It hits him, all at once, for the hundredth time today: he’s at the Olympic Games, and the love of his life is by his side, and they’re going to make love in his room at the Olympic Games. He moans against Sherlock’s mouth, and Sherlock shudders at the sound. All of a sudden the kiss is not slow and tender at all, it’s deep and longing and needy.
Oh, God, income. With a sinking feeling, he remembers the other major roadblock between competitive skaters and success. He drums his fingers on the steering wheel.
And it’s expensive. It’s less so than it could be, since Sherlock is doing so many jobs, but there are Greg’s coaching fees, and ice time, and gym fees, and equipment, and costumes, and physical therapy, all of which has to be paid for.
Holmes caught my eye. His mouth curved into a small half-smile, more amused than a smirk, and with something light and mischievous in his eye. "Though I could probably manage it, why not skip the formalities?"
“I haven’t been able to fully stock my kitchen yet,” Sherlock says, “so you may find meals somewhat repetitive for the first week until I can get the necessary ingredients in. It doesn’t bother me, but I have been made to understand that most people feel dissatisfied without variety in their meals.”
Sherlock lets his eyes drift shut, tips his head back, and sighs in utter bliss. Sherlock Holmes looking like
There is a stretch of four days of solid work in mid-June. During the daytime hours, Sherlock is with John, going through their usual routine. At night, he is managing his other jobs. He sleeps for no more than an hour or two out of every 24, and eats only the bare necessities. By the fourth day, he has begun to look wan and ragged and his reactions are slowed.
John hastily zips up his suitcase, swings his backpack on, and hurries down the hall. Harry is leaning back against the door, eyeing Sherlock with something between bewilderment and anger. Sherlock has one finger up in the unmistakable sign for “just a minute.”
Out of curiosity, John searches to see the tweets that mention @sholmes. A few of them are speculating more about John and whether he will get any choreography from him, since the official press release had only said that he would be coached by Greg, and nothing at all about Sherlock. The mentions are fewer and further between as John looks back further back, but markedly ruder.
“Please. My position merely connects me with officials across many disciplines.” Mycroft rises, buttons his suit jacket up, and fetches an umbrella that was resting against the arm of the couch. “Now, if you will excuse me, there are discussions to be had about broadcast rights for senior-level events next season.”
Sherlock opens his eyes and sees the empty room, absent of judges, of coaches, of anyone, and remembers: this is not for him. This is not his anymore.
“You see? When he’s on, he’s on, but he does have a habit of experimenting by flinging his body into the air and hoping for the best. Used to give me heart attacks.”
in the harness, John who Sherlock told to fall off the edge and who threw caution to the wind and did it. It’s John on the top of the podium at Nationals in 2010, in January 2018, at Pyeongchang. It’s the look on John’s face when they hang the gold medal around his neck. It’s John triumphant.
“Yes. It’s close to the rink and rent-free. There are other advantages, but you won’t like them as much.”
John Watson returning after a retirement that lengthy is extremely rare, but not completely unheard of. Deanna Stellato retired at age 17 due to injury and then returned in 2016 at 33 to skate in pairs. Virtue and Moir took a two-year break in the middle of their career, as mentioned here.
It’s the sort of dream where he knows immediately he’s in one, from the hazy quality around the edges. He’s at the rink, or he’s at
“Oh, good, John, you’ve met Mary,” Sherlock says, appearing suddenly behind them and causing Molly to jump and spill her Gatorade. “Mary, have you talked to him about press? We need to organize his announcement.”
John returns to center ice and assumes his starting position with his head down, shoulders back, and chest up. Sherlock hits play on the music. John’s arms fly up and he pivots, then checks out into a series of steps.
I've been using it to gather clothes, furniture, scenery, and other useful stuff. It's turned into quite a nice collection of early Victorian menswear, decor, and English countryside. Very nice for a certain mood!
Sherlock does not understand this reference, which John is incredulous about, but this is also not a dealbreaker. While John is immobilized on the couch in the NormaTec pants, Sherlock presents him with the nutrition plan he came up with on the plane.
John pulls Sherlock up to his feet and kisses him again. There’s some complicated choreography where they’re each pulling each other’s jeans and underwear down and stepping out of their own, and then they do have to step apart to strip off their sweaters. Finally, gloriously, they are naked, and John is crowding Sherlock into the bed.
The song slowly builds and builds until the singer jumps up the octave, singing plaintively, “We can be heroes, just for one day.” It fades back into the strings towards the end, and then finally to silence.
Compulsory figures are specific shapes, or figures, carved into the ice using careful, controlled turns. They used to be a part of major competitions, and are where the name “figure skating” came from. They kept a lot of otherwise incredible athletes from achieving (Midori Ito, the true queen of the triple axel—go suck an egg, Tonya Harding—constantly struggled with them) and were just a drag to understand and watch, so they were eliminated in 1990. You can watch footage of them on Youtube, if you want to get a handle on how something can be so difficult to do and so dull to watch at the same time. If you look them up on Google Image, you can appreciate the very pretty shapes in the ice. And before you ask: yes, I have heard from reliable sources that people did use their skills to draw dicks on the ice.
“Mm.” Sherlock stirs and pushes back into John’s erection. Fuck it. If his body is to be destroyed, he might as well let his husband get off to it. “John, hold my leg up. I can’t lift it.”
. Sherlock gasps, drawing in a deep, shuddering breath as he crests the last wave into orgasm. His whole world narrows to the acute, exquisite sensation in the peak of his chest and then bursts outwards, encompassing the tight, hot pressure and friction in his pelvis and the roiling movement in his gut as his child—John’s child, their child—fidgets and stirs in response to her father’s heart rate and exertion and (Sherlock likes to think, in the deepest throes of sentimentality) the volume of his love for her, and for John, and for them. He comes, shuddering and bucking, with a deep, guttural cry. John holds Sherlock’s hips so that he doesn’t dislodge himself and keeps up with long, deep pushes of his cock.
Sherlock’s tango. More than that, even; Sherlock suspects he might even love it. And he takes to the choreography like a duck to water. He’d learned the Heroes choreography naturally, it being a style he is used to and feels comfortable in. But this? This he devours, consuming every extension of an arm and all the quick, intricate footwork.
John cups both his hands over Sherlock’s belly, then slides them back, around his sides to his back and then down, fingers dipping into the waistband, moving further down, catching it with his thumbs, and peeling the whole thing down, down, down…
Grade of execution, or GOE, is part of the technical portion of a score. An element has a base value of points (8.5 for a triple axel, for instance) from which points are added or subtracted based on how well you do it. An element has to check off certain bullets to qualify for a GOE level. Two bullets is a +1, four is a +2, and six or more is a +3. If you’re curious, you can scroll down to
I need to learn before I promise a timeline on updates. This chapter turned out to be more of a bear than expected. I went through about three versions before I settled on this one.
Athletes will train in places like Colorado Springs because the high altitude forces their bodies to adapt to harsher climates. Colorado Springs in particular is the home of the USOC and the headquarters of the USFSA, and is a big figure skating town. Lestrade and his people are in Denver because they still have the height thing, but have fewer other skaters to trip over.
“Heard a rumor @sholmes got fired again. Serves him right. Idk why he keeps trying to convince people to let him work with them.”
It’s been an hour, but the lights and the sounds are still ringing in John’s head. The brilliant shapes in the sky, the thrill of being surrounded by some of the best of the world, the thrill of being one of them! It’s almost enough to warm him up. PyeongChang is cold in February, and between lining up with the other American athletes and then standing outside in the frigid air, John spent quite a bit of time exposed to it. On the ice, he warms up quickly, but not so much in the open air.
The Grand Prix series has run its entire course now! If you're interested in checking out the real top skaters in the world, go look at
John rubs his thumbs up and down over Sherlock’s arms. “I just can’t stop thinking about you. Four years ago, if you’d…”
John skates through where the quad toe-triple toe should go, marking the combination itself, and then skates into his step sequence.
He and Mary swap numbers and emails. When John texts her, he adds a good picture of himself with the comment, “So you don’t forget this ugly mug.” She grins when she gets it and texts him back a winking emoji.
. This meshing of Borser and Lestrade is also a bit of a shoutout to Drinkingcocoa, who is tremendously fond of both men and whose help in researching this fic was invaluable.
work, work that makes him feel alive like he hasn’t in years. It’s draining, yes, but he has his ways of coping with that. During the day, there is practice and training, and at night, there is his consulting work. He hasn’t been bored in months.
He doesn’t sound accusatory. He probably even thinks his tone sounds conversational. Coming from anyone else, it would. But John has rarely heard Sherlock sound this flat and tired. Of course he’s tired. After three years of seeing this level of vitriol every day, how couldn’t he be?
Sherlock leans back a little, and something clearly changes. He breathes out a breathless, "ah," and moves ever faster. John is clinging to him by the ribcage. (His waist, of course, is impossible to hold like he usually would.)
“You don’t have much to pack, so we should be able to manage by ourselves,” says Sherlock. “It shouldn’t take more than two hours to get to Philadelphia at this time and with your driving, so we should be at the airport by one AM. You will need to sleep, I assume.”
“Meanwhile, other people haven’t fully rotated their triple axel in two seasons.” John stands up. “Enjoy the rest of practice. You might as well have fun if you’re not going to land anything.”
“Didn’t you watch?” John says, as he strips his gloves and coat off and throws them towards the closet.
John cracks his eyes open. It turns out not to hurt. “What time is it?” Speaking also does not hurt.
“No!” Sherlock flaps a dismissive hand and scowls. “Sudden movements can trigger an abrupt tightening of the ligament surrounding my uterus, as opposed to the normal—”
“I work for the IOC,” Mycroft says. “Work has been intensifying lately, with Pyeongchang approaching. My assistance liasing with the USOC was necessary, and I was fortunate enough to have a few hours off today and thought I would drop by.”
I have many times heard the handsomeness of the English officer's uniform remarked upon: the scarlet color, the tidy gold buttons, the touches of braid, the striking epaulettes with their fringe. Myself, I have never been able to appreciate its aesthetics, having seen its intended purpose in action. When a man sees firsthand how well the renowned red coat disguises the stain of blood seeping through the wool, he often loses his taste for the way it catches ladies' eyes.
“What I’m saying,” John says, “is whatever I accomplish at these games, it’s yours too. I want you to share it with me.”
. It’s so quiet at first John has trouble hearing it over the background noise of the bus, but then he makes out the quiet strings. The vocal line comes in, sung by a man with a melodic and slightly rough voice.
“Well, when you act like a massive jackass your entire career, you will find that there are people who celebrate your downfall.”
BEGINNING NOTES: My knowledge of cocaine withdrawal comes entirely from one series of fics (admittedly written by someone with experience) and Google, so if this isn’t entirely accurate, forgive me.
Now, editing question: was Sherlock's "M'Naghten Backstory 101" followable? Or did you get lost? It's hard trying to write up a quick primer of it when I'm staring at all the research and thus know everything. I'm never sure what's relevant and what's not. It may become marginally clearer in the next chapter or two.
“Can you talk and read the ISU handbook at the same time? I wasn’t aware you possessed that level of brainpower.”
“It shouldn’t come from your waist,” Sherlock says. He feels as if his entire sense of being is centered in the palms of his hands and the tips of his fingers, over the sharp bones of John’s hips and taut, stretched muscle. “Your hips should be like syrup.”
His first impression is that while it is not dirty, it is definitely messy. The coffee table is scattered with books, magazines, and the typical bachelor clutter. Off to the right he can see a kitchen, the table in which is littered with such objects as a laptop, more books, and an electric keyboard. Across the way, a door is open, revealing an unexpectedly neat bedroom. A hallway leads down to where John imagines there is a bathroom and a second bedroom.
John must have woken up some point, because he had to have gotten himself onto the plane. But to the best of his memory, he fell asleep on the floor of the Philadelphia airport and woke to Sherlock shaking his shoulder.
Now, for the pretty pictures of Victorian uniforms! John, as a captain, would qualify for small amounts of the decoration that Regency uniforms were famous for, though at this point they had gotten more muted. I have for you some visual references (read: sexy fucking clothing) for the
John moves faster, somehow, where in the world did he find a way to go faster and harder and deeper all at once? Sherlock wails at the onslaught. He takes hold of his prick, still slick from his first orgasm.
“You’re skating like you’re afraid,” Sherlock says with perfect calm. “When’s the last time you fell learning a step sequence?”
“You’re rather an unusual case,” says Mycroft. “Exceptions can be made based on history, if the argument is made by the proper people.”
As soon as the words are out, John is terrified he’s made a huge miscalculation. Here he is with someone who’s basically a stranger, and he called him a jackass. God, why does he even step outside his door? He looks sideways at Sherlock to gauge his reaction. To his surprise, Sherlock has a broad grin on his face. John can’t help but grin back, and then they’re chuckling, and then laughing.
“Nothing.” Sherlock gestures vaguely towards the door. “Get the lights and come back to bed with me.”
“No way that athlete would go and do cocaine the same day as his drug test,” John says. “Not ever, and especially not after he won the national championship, and especially not after he just qualified for the Olympic Games.”
This is an extremely funny joke to anyone who watched any figure skating competitions this past season. If you read the pre-season interviews, you will find literal dozens of skaters talking about how they’re so excited for their Moulin Rouge programs, since it’s such a unique choice that no one else has skated to. And then they all skated to it. There have been
In fact, he is doing his damnedest to keep his eyes off his husband and his softened curves: the small, handful-sized breasts, the almost-imperceptible new color in his cheeks, the shine to his hair, and—most prominently—the dramatic swell of his stomach where he is nurturing their child.
Sherlock glances sideways at him, then looks back down. “You’re intimidated by his reputation. Don’t be. His methods are precisely what you need. He has turned out well-balanced, well-rounded skaters, almost without exception.”
“To the Olympics, yes.” Sherlock is still tapping away on his phone. “And you aren’t just going. You’re going to win.”
John, already snickering, types the handle in. “Oh my God, your avatar is a picture of Dabin Choi in a flower crown. Did you make that?”
“I saw @sholmes in the background of @gollymsmolly’s Instagram working with Ph*lip and wow, I wouldn’t even wish that man on the #FlutzKing.”
Finally, it is about to no longer be summer, and yet this is VERY far from done. This hasn't been every Sunday for, uh, quite some time, and it's about to be OFFICIALLY not every Sunday. I'm going to shoot for every other Sunday, with posts on
Half an hour later, John is sweaty and breathless and exhilarated, and Sherlock is almost smiling, which is an impressive compliment. They break for lunch and Sherlock fetches their food.
Sherlock is pulling both legs back until his knees are all the way up to his chest, and he’s still unsatisfied. “Push my leg up,” he says breathlessly.
, body and mind. Sherlock would do anything for him, as he would do anything for Sherlock. Sherlock will hurt, and he will love it, because he loves John, and because he can and will push past it if that’s what it takes to feel this good.
“I can see that.” John smiles at him. Sherlock can’t look straight at it. John’s smile makes something in Sherlock’s stomach do a funny little flip, and he needs to focus on the work.
One sunny May day, when John has not seen Sherlock since two nights before, he comes home, lets himself into the apartment, and finds a strange man in a suit sitting on the sofa, looking impassively at Sherlock, who is perched in an inhuman pretzel shape on his chair.
do look totally ridiculous, but a number of athletes swear by them for making the aftermath of an intensive workout less unpleasant.
A damp curl slips forward and sticks to Sherlock’s forehead. John watches it fall and hisses through his teeth.
They exit the men’s locker room and enter the rink. It isn’t crowded, but it’s fairly busy. John counts three skaters whizzing around the ice. Greg is working with a small, blonde girl on an equally small triple loop, which she keeps underrotating. There is a black woman with lush, full hair pulled back into a messy bun practicing footwork, and a dark-haired man with a short beard who is repeatedly doing what is either a mediocre triple flip or quite a bad triple lutz. All of them look vaguely familiar from skating coverage John has seen over the last few years.
Does John want more? He probably should. He pictures himself in a townhouse in the suburbs, dog and spouse and two kids waiting for him, and feels nothing. What he has is enough.
. If you’re going straight, you’re on the flat/hollow. If you’re going in a curve, you’re on an inside or an outside edge, depending on whether it’s the inside or the outside of the blade that you’re on. A “deep” edge is where the skater’s body is at a shallower angle to the ice. Maintaining deep edges throughout your footwork is difficult and the sign of a more artistic skater. Ice dancers have to have great edges, as their whole sport is artistry, and singles and pairs can get extra points for having deep edges.
piece. I’m envisioning more the former for the beginning section, the latter for the middle, and some combination of both for the end.)
Sherlock walks him through the remainder of the off-ice warm-up, guiding John’s body into where he wants it. By the time he has finished with his minute of jumping jacks and they are putting on their skates, John finds that his heart is racing at a pleasantly quick rate.
“I’ve got johnwatsonskate saved for you on Twitter and Instagram,” Mary singsongs, waving her iPhone.
“Molly, Philip, Sally,” Greg says, “this is John Watson. He’s coming out of retirement and joining us. He’ll be working with Sherlock and I.”
John takes himself and his things to the room, which is as disorderly as was promised. There is exercise equipment, sound equipment, and a jumble of worn skate boots strewn about the room. But there’s a bed, a desk, and a closet, which is all John requires.
John arrives back at the apartment around 5:30. He hears nothing from Sherlock’s room. Well, he shouldn’t make dinner for just himself, should he? Not the best of manners. He goes down the hall to Sherlock’s room and knocks on the door.
Of all of Sherlock’s strengths, he was never famed for his stamina. He tends to expend too much energy in the first half of his program and be left gasping by the end. Consequently, he is in the habit of taking frequent short breaks in practices earlier on in the season. As the season progresses, he gradually lengthens the spaces between them.
for the latest episode of the Three Patch Podcast. Fox Estacado, a madwoman, rotoscoped something like 185 frames of Stephane Lambiel to turn him into Sherlock Holmes. There he is!! It’s Skatelock!! So dynamic! So powerful! So fluid! I screamed and did watch the animation for about a solid two minutes. (You should also listen to Three Patch. I'm on the latest episode talking about taking up figure skating as an adult.)
There are two portions of figure skating scores, the technical (TES) and component (PCS). Technical is, basically, what jumps/spins/steps you did and how well you did them. Component marks are the “artistic” elements, which casual watchers tend to think means “expressive faces” or “their skating/song was pretty and I liked it.” It’s actually a combination of five characteristics: skating skills, transitions, performance, composition, and interpretation. There are arguments that PCS is sometimes scored based more on who the judges like the best more than who is truly the most “artistic.” This part of scoring is the one that’s easiest for outside opinion to leak in, like, for instance, scoring a Russian man who skated like hot garbage higher than an American who skated beautifully at the Olympic team men’s free skate because the Russian is Russian and has quads. Not that I’m still bitter or anything. Anyways, difficult entries do not give you any kind of bump to your technical score, while adding things like different arm positions within a jump do. This is, in my opinion, some hot horseshit.
get more, and harder, and deeper, and boy, does he ever. Sherlock is openly crying out now with every thrust in. John wants to remind him of the thin walls, but he wants that noise so badly that he can’t bring himself to.
“I’ve missed it so much. Missed you.” Sherlock straddles him. He is hard and leaking, his red cock pressed up against the underside of his swollen stomach. He rises up on his knees a little, reaches behind himself, and guides John’s erection to line up against his hole. John slams his head back into the pillows.
Gradually, the ringing in John’s ears subsides, and he slumps forward and off to the side. He throws one arm over Sherlock’s chest and discovers that it’s shaking with laughter.
I should also take this opportunity to review how I am dealing with real-life figure skaters, which is that for the men, at least, I’m largely not. They’re not here. The pairs and dance folks remain untouched. Most of the ladies will also be left alone, although I’ve, ah, cleared a bit of space out in places. However, if I kept the current top men’s singles skaters in here, I would have to justify my characters being better than the Nathan Chens and Yuzuru Hanyus, which is a thing I cannot do.
In any case, I am still cranking out about 1000 words per day, so look forward to more frequent updates. Also, remember: this is more or less my zero draft, so
“I’ve seen what you wear when you choose,” Sherlock tells him, guarding the sketches protectively. “I’m not letting you onto the ice looking like you just walked out of a Marshalls.”
“Here, like this,” he says. He comes around behind John, puts his hands on his shoulders, and presses down. John twitches. “You are more flexible than you give yourself credit for.”
John takes Sherlock’s arms in his hands. “It’s the energy here,” he murmurs. “You can feel it too, can’t you? God, I wish…”
Again: skate, lunch, skate, gym, home. The granola bars John left outside Sherlock’s door are still there when he gets back. He does not try to get Sherlock for dinner, and just makes himself the same tilapia, samphire, and rice for dinner that he did the day before. He does a marginally better job of it.
“He used her last season. She choreographed him an exquisite short that he did not deserve and never once performed with the pathos it merited. He goes through coaches and choreographers like used napkins, hoping the next one will fix him. Lestrade is a wise choice, as he has the best chance of correcting the edge on that lutz.”
Greg grins, and John nearly dies on the spot. “Sorry for the state of the car. I would’ve cleaned, but I had just about no notice you were coming, thanks to His Highness over here.”
There is an expression on Sherlock’s face that John cannot quite place. It looks stormy, but as if the storm is clearing to something blank and wide-eyed. Is he shocked? Angry? What should John be doing right now? Is he expected to be saying something?
Sherlock sits beside John and unpacks his food. It’s the same thing that’s in John’s lunch bag: water, a few slices of low-fat cheese, and a sandwich consisting of whole grain bread, turkey, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and mustard.
John lands with a fist pump and a shout, which is echoed by Greg with a loud, “Holy shit!” John skates back over to his coaches with a big grin on his face. Greg is grinning back. Even Sherlock looks pleased.
“I don’t disagree. Unfortunately, publicity is part of the game. If you’re going to Pyeongchang, we need to win at every aspect of that game.”
Sherlock plugs in the charger and his sleek, slate gray headphones, navigates to Youtube, and taps in “John Watson SP US Champs 2010.” This far back, USFSA doesn’t really care to send the DMCA takedown requests, so the video is easy to find. There is only one, and it only has around 10,000 hits. The video loads, then Sherlock hits pause and scrolls down to the comment section.
A Biellmann is a position where the skater pulls their free leg behind them and at the level of or over their head. It is found both in spirals (when you skate on one foot for a really long time) and in spins. There are variations on where you can hold your free leg, but grabbing the blade of the skate is the most common. It’s nearly universal in ladies’ skating, but quite rare in men’s, because of the lower flexibility of most men. Here is
When skaters are first learning a jump or are adding an additional rotation, they work in a harness. It adds some stability so the skater can get the hang of where their body needs to be without doing the really big, painful falls.
Greg lets out a snort. “That’s for damn sure. He almost had his quad lutz when I started working with him, and we kept on it, but it wasn’t super consistent by the start of the season. First competition, we planned the triple, I told him to stick to the triple, and he went out and landed the quad.” Greg shakes his head. “I could only be so pissed off at him too. I wanted to shake him until his teeth rattled, but he was so damn proud, and it felt so good to see him so proud...I did tell him that if he scared me like that again I’d make him coach juveniles, and to just tell me next time he was about to do something boneheaded.” Greg tugs on the end of the harness. “Anyways, let’s try that a couple more times.”
John showers, and they eat dinner, and he goes to bed. The next morning, when Sherlock wakes him up for yoga, he checks his phone.
I'm so sorry about the excessive number of footnotes this chapter. I promise they won't get this long again. They actually reached such a length that I couldn't fit them down here in the end notes box. Never again, I swear.
Obviously meaning to start a fast and punishing pace, Sherlock rocks up—comes back down with a wince. John catches him by the hips.
“You see,” Sherlock says in a rush, “I was influenced heavily by the classic Argentine tango, although the instruments are rather nontraditional. Typically it’s an orchestra with an accordion, but I disliked the timbre of the accordion for these purposes and lacked a full orchestra, which brought me to this more simplistic orchestration. I tried to steer quite clear of flamenco, although I’m afraid that elements may have leaked into the violin part. And—”
John comes with a glorious shout, Sherlock’s body wringing pulse after pulse of pleasure from him. He throws his head back and surrenders to it. Beneath him, he feels Sherlock’s leg kick back and his body start convulsing around him as he stripes come up over his stomach.
“Yes,” he breathes. “Keep me. Stuff me up until I’m too sore and swollen to move. Keep fucking me so I can’t ever leave.”
Jesus CHRIST this is late, and even then I had to cut it in half. First there was Gridlock, and then there was moving back to school...but really, a lot of this is just me buying Starcraft II and discovering Heroes of the Storm
Bakerfield Hall was my last and only option. In any case, it suited the man I had become. Monsters and madmen belong in such places.
John sheds his clothes down the hall. Sherlock, though, waits until they get to the bed before he pulls his worn t-shirt up and over his head. The elastic of his pajama bottoms is slung low, below his gravid stomach. John eyes it and licks his lips.
Greg rolls his eyes. “Oh, yeah. He does that sometimes. He’ll come out in a day or two, vacuum up all the food in the fridge, and sleep for twelve hours. When he was sleeping in my basement after he first came to Colorado, he’d pull that routine a couple times a month. You’ve been here, what, about a month? He’s past due for it, really.”
John’s mouth has gone dry. His entire life, he’s lived either with family or with, well, James, who was practically family. And James always kept their coaching relationship to the rink. From the sounds of it, this relationship is going to penetrate every corner of his life. Is he prepared for that? He looks sideways at Sherlock, and thinks about how it felt to land his axel.
Irene becomes a mainstay at the rink for a while, as she’s choreographing for Molly and Donovan. Her work is beautiful, and the music choices suit the athletes while still pushing the limits of what they can do.
The bus had made maybe two stops before letting them off a block away from the rink. John and Sherlock enter the locker room, which is blessedly empty. John isn’t sure he’s ready to look at other, more active athletes just yet.
“You could call it helpful, I suppose,” John mutters. “This is stupid. I’m not competing in a popularity contest. Why can’t I just skate?”
John laughs and hopes it sounds like the laugh of a normal human. “Yeah, I didn’t have a hell of a lot of notice either.” What the fuck? Did he just swear in front of the 1986 world champion? The very, very hot and bisexual world champion?
“Sherlock, this is his first practice in over half a decade,” Greg says. “We don’t want to start with triples.”
Sherlock misses his bus stop and has to walk an extra four blocks to his apartment. He bumps into more than a few pedestrians as he goes. One of them tries to start something, but Sherlock does not stop walking, and the angry man gives up soon. By the time he reaches the apartment, he has a full minute of the violin line down.
“Greg can handle anything you need,” Sherlock says, throwing his skates into his bag without even tucking the laces in. “I’ll see you in a couple of days.”
The NormaTec pants have turned off. By the time John has shucked them, Sherlock has gotten to his feet.
Sherlock’s hands appear unmoored, drifting over the sheets as if he doesn’t know where to put them. John takes one and places it on Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock takes the hint and rubs his hand down over his ribcage, up again, his palm over his nipple, and then his fingers plucking at it, pinching and rubbing.
By the time he comes up with the tube of lube, Sherlock has drawn his legs up and is gently squeezing his cock again.
Sherlock clears his throat, scuttles forward, and starts shuffling some of the books on the coffee table about. “Obviously it could use some, er, tidying up.”
From the living room, a door opens. “Who the hell are you?” says the unmistakable voice of Harry Watson.
Whatever it is, the information is too slippery to hold. Sherlock lets it go as his mind blurs and sinks into a deep, dreamless sleep.
It isn’t enough. His muscles are burning and his joints ache, but he doesn’t care. His cock rubs deliciously between his rounded stomach and John’s (hatefully) flat abdominals, and even that doesn’t satisfy. He whines, baring his teeth and groping at his own chest to cup handfuls of unfamiliar flesh and squeeze. He scrapes his thumbnails over and pinches at and plucks his round, dark nipples, chasing the added spark of sensation that will drive him over the edge. More than anything, Sherlock wants to
Sherlock tries, but when he shifts his weight to his left leg, it trembles and collapses underneath him.
Greg points to the athletes as he names them. “This is Molly Hooper, here from Canada.” The blonde girl gives a shy little wave. “Sally Donovan, from France.” The black woman nods stiffly. “And Philip Anderson, American.” The bearded man does not even a nod, only tightening the corners of his mouth in what might have been intended as a smile. “I’ve got other students, but these are the ones you’ll probably be sharing ice with most often.”
John tries to imagine Sherlock with someone, anyone at all, and realizes he can’t. The Sherlock he knows does not sit across someone at a coffee shop flirting over lattes, or holding hands walking through the park.
“The Korean, Russian, and Canadian accounts. The American is a middle-aged housewife, as is the Japanese one. And the Italian is a retired coach who hates the IJS, the current age requirement for seniors, and most of the major federations.”
The other skaters grab their skate guards, snap them on, and step off the ice. Molly goes to a bag by the bench and gets out a little lunch box while Philip and Sally head off towards the lobby together. As they go, Sally leans in and whispers something in Philip’s ear, which makes him grin broadly. The look of the grin makes John’s stomach turn.
They’re closer than they were in real life. Sherlock’s body is flush with John’s back. John can feel the long lines of him. At least, he can until Sherlock pushes him, and John falls, and instead of hitting the ice he falls through and keeps falling until he wakes with a start and a swooping feeling in his stomach.
“Rostelecom Cup in October and NHK Trophy in November,” he says. “Lucky for me you speak Russian and Japanese.”
Sherlock grimaces. “Lestrade, when he takes on new skaters, strongly recommends that they try working with me.”
“Please,” Sherlock says, dropping his voice into that low, only-dogs-can-hear register that he knows bloody well makes John’s toes curl.
Sherlock is nearby, conversing in rapid Russian with a beautiful woman with dark hair tied up in a severe bun. John recognizes her from years of seeing her in the kiss and cry with various athletes, and before that in ice dance coverage from the eighties. Molly is nearby, looking lost.
Sherlock looks at John and looks deeper. He sees the shabby little house in Pennsylvania and how it had three bedrooms, and how all three of them had twin beds, including the empty room that could only have been Mrs. Watson’s.
“I’ve got it!” Sherlock shouts, waving his iPhone in the air. He’s got earbuds in his other hand. “Your free skate. I’ve got it.” He tries to skid to a stop and has to grab Greg’s arm to halt himself.
Sherlock puts out his hand. John takes it with more than a little suspicion, but Sherlock helps him to his feet. John tries again.
John laughs. “Of course you don’t. I’d been junior national champion the last two years, so I remember it. You were thirteen years old and you skated like...like nothing I’d ever seen before. I couldn’t even be angry I didn’t win, because my best couldn’t match up to yours. The artistry, the huge, incredible jumps, the sheer thought that went into designing your program. When I found out you’d choreographed it yourself I couldn’t believe it at first, because who could be all of that at once? But then, at the same time, you performed it like it was part of you, so it didn’t take me long to believe it. We stood on the podium—you were so small that even on the higher step, we were the same height. And I remember thinking…” John shakes his head. “I thought, ‘Wow, he’s going to be something.’”
John rolls his eyes heavenward. “Unbelievable. I’ll get us a Chromecast tomorrow. Want to watch something?”
His off-ice workout at the gym is also strange without Sherlock on him. John considers trying to get away without doing some of his least favorite exercises, but no doubt Sherlock would be able to tell that John had skipped them based on how he holds his fork or ties his shoes. So he does his whole workout, even the slide board. When he is finished, he is a comfortable level of tired and sore.
They’re experimenting with different entries into John’s axel. It won’t add anything to his technical score, but it should count towards transitions.
Sherlock shrugs indifferently. When he first met Sherlock Holmes nearly a year ago, John would have read this as a “no.” Experience has taught him that the closer interpretation is “I thought it was dull, but I watched it for you.” John smiles.
This looks like a very fast update, but actually I had been sitting on the previous chapter for a while, unable to get the time to format and post it. As ever, constructive criticism welcome, as I am my own beta.
Sherlock relaxes slowly, and only partway. The insatiable desperation has abated, but there’s still a lazy wanting in his veins, syrupy and thick, not demanding attention so much as it is intrigued by the promise of it.
John makes a sound like he’s dying and wants nothing more than to do just that, just like this. He fucks Sherlock with ferocity and single-mindedness and his teeth in Sherlock's shoulder.
It’s the salchow, it’s definitely the salchow, but it was the toe loop that John fell off of in practice two weeks before the Olympics.
Nevertheless, the performance is gorgeous. John’s stamina is evident in his consistency throughout the program. His jumps in the later part of his program are every bit as solid as those in the first part. His artistry is less impressive, but it’s competent.
At the curb outside the airport, Sherlock goes to a silver sedan parked there and knocks on the trunk, which pops open. He puts his and John’s things inside and gets into the passenger’s seat without a word. John supposes this is the ride and climbs into the back. There’s just room next to a jumbled pile of books and empty takeout containers.
And Sherlock is not without empathy, and he understands that John has not had a proper training session in a long time. So after half an hour, Sherlock says, “John, feel free to take a break.”
Constructive criticism is welcome! Most especially because this chapter got a little less than the usual editing work.
It’s true, and it also punches a groan from John’s throat. He does it, lifts Sherlock’s leg and raises it so John can push his cock smoothly in. Sherlock whimpers, both from the pleasure and because his back and entire pelvis really does hurt. Still, he has to admit that there is something highly appealing about John’s obvious relish at his discomfort.
The car ride into Denver proper is largely spent with Sherlock and Greg bickering over schedules. Sherlock wants to start this afternoon, while Greg does his best to convince him that he has enough on his hands with his other students today and that their best bet is starting on-ice work tomorrow. As the car slows to a stop in front of a row of nearly identical brick houses, Sherlock has bargained Greg into a brief session this afternoon. Neither party seems satisfied with this compromise, but Sherlock nevertheless helps John get his luggage out of the trunk.
Before he even gets to the bus stop, Sherlock has his phone out, his headphones on, and his music transcribing app open. It had struck him all at once. One minute he was watching John flirting with Mary and Molly, and the next he was hearing music.
John plops down onto the couch. He’d gotten two assignments his one year in seniors and done admirably, with a silver at Cup of Russia, a gold at Skate America, and a silver at the final. His realistic goals for this season had been to work his way up through sectionals and make it to Nationals, and go out for some Challenger series events to get him into international competition. The idea of skating in the Grand Prix had not even entered his brain.
It isn’t until later that night, when Sherlock finally allows himself to lower his exhausted, wrung-out body into bed, that he finds himself unable to shake the unnatural warmth in his chest and hands when he thinks about practice that day.
He looks genuinely anguished. John’s throat swells up with something more than lust. He squeezes Sherlock’s breast in a vain effort to release some of the excess emotion, which makes Sherlock whimper. His hole twitches around the head of John’s cock. John gasps and feels another surge of emotion, this one almost terrifying in its volume.
John winces. If this is how people talk when they openly tag Sherlock into the conversation, how do they talk about him when they’re not expecting him to see?
“No, I thought we could eat Snickers bars from the vending machine in the lobby. Yes, I brought food.”
He continuously pushes away thoughts about James, and James’s quiet suggestion that maybe this was it when John couldn’t seem to get his feet back under him. He does not want to think about those wasted years, and what he could have done if someone had said to his face that this was something he could push through. Once the door had been opened for him, he had believed it. And his mother had been sick…
Sherlock was supposed to set his alarm to wake him before John came home, so John would not find him asleep on the couch out in the open with his
Mycroft does something with his face that might be distantly related to a smile, or perhaps just a smirk. “Why, upon your Grand Prix assignments. You should receive the text tomorrow morning.”
“Yeah,” John says, not sounding the least bit ashamed. He caresses Sherlock’s belly, skating his fingertips over the dark grooves of his stretch marks, flattening his palm over the skin so stretched that it shines. “I have completely ruined you, haven’t I?”
“God, yeah, like that. Can’t tell you how many times I’ve looked at you during practice and wanted to have you right there at the rink. Press you against the mirror in the off-ice training room and pound you until you can’t walk straight.”
The conversation takes them all the way into Philadelphia and to the airport, by which point Sherlock’s natural slight scowl has deepened into a profound frown. John is yawning and gradually fading from the entire exchange, which seems to only exacerbate Sherlock’s irritation.
John growls and slams in to make Sherlock cry out. “Good,” he snarls. “Keep you here. Keep you. You’re
In my notes for this fic, I have noted various real-life skaters that I have pulled inspiration from for different characters. Most of them are combinations of different athletes, or use a few small elements of an athlete but are otherwise pretty dissimilar, or I at least bothered to change the dates or medals on their achievements. Greg Lestrade, however, is pretty much just straight-up Brian Orser. Brian Orser is a simply lovely Canadian coach who appears to be attempting, Pokemon-like, to collect all the top skaters. He turns out well-rounded athletes who generally keep their heads together and bring their nice dad home many shiny medals. The Olympic men’s gold and bronze medalists, Yuzuru Hanyu and Javier Fernandez, were both coached by him.
“Sherlock!” Greg shouts after him. He turns back to John with an eye roll. “He should talk. I swear his ankles are made of toothpicks. He mostly had the good luck to injure himself in the off-season, though, and we could always scramble to get him ready in time. Speaking of, how’s your hip?”
“John,” Sherlock whines, “careful, be careful. I won’t be able to get up tomorrow.” He’s not entirely sure how much he’s playacting at this point, and he’s already almost past the point of caring.
John pets gently at Sherlock’s head. “I want to fuck you,” he says. “Let’s get naked and on the bed.”
John slips under the ebb and flow of pleasure and allows himself to be lost in the sensation, in the dark curls under his fingers and the wet fucking sounds. He can’t be loud, but he can talk, right? Surely he can talk.
“You should go to bed as well. Most of Lestrade’s other skaters have two weeks off now that the season is officially over, so we’re going to start really working.”
There are a few more in similar veins. Sherlock reads them, then scrolls back up and watches the video. It’s truly a beautiful performance, showing mastery of the sport well beyond the age John had been at the time. The musical choice is sound. Unique, but not obviously trying, and it fits John’s skating style. Unfortunate that this was before lyrics in music were permitted. The vocal version of the song is exquisite.
“I have never had any sort of sexual or romantic relationship with Lestrade,” he says. It’s almost a whisper. “And I promise you, I never engaged in doping.”
. I’m extremely gay for that bit of choreography right on the first “Roxane,” when they both do that thing with their arms. Also that lift when Tessa sort of vaults herself directly onto Scott’s face.
Without another word, he swings his bag over his shoulder and rushes out the door, shoelaces untied and flapping.
With a gasp, Sherlock drops into an orgasm that makes every last part of his body convulse violently with sensation. John shouts in triumph, and his rhythm turns into a jagged staccato. The warm pulsing deep in Sherlock’s body is a luscious denouement to his climax.
“Yep. His last coach quit because he took his senior test when she was out of town. She wanted him to wait until he was seventeen and he didn’t, which was the last straw for her. He came to me because he said he knew he needed better control of his jumps and knew I taught good jump technique. That was about the last time he treated me like my opinions mattered.”
Greg and the other skaters all converge at the edge of the rink where Sherlock and John are. John reads their faces. They all look to Sherlock first with expressions of repressed hostility. It is a moment before they see John at all. He tries to stay blank and not transmit how very, very awkward he feels.
Not until the elevator doors close behind them does Sherlock say through gritted teeth, “There was a problem with our reservation.”
Sherlock frowns at his screen. He is perched in the chair in the living room, his laptop balanced on his knees. He is on his ninth “Top Tango Songs” playlist, and he is still coming up short.
John pushes off to go into his step sequence—and Sherlock shoves him in the side and knocks him to the ice! Startled and unprepared, he lands sideways, thudding onto his hip. It takes him a moment to shake off the cold clutch of fear. It was a light fall, and his hip is healthy and strong. He’s fine.
“I mean, I’ve had Twitter, but I had about fifty followers, because it was mainly just for tracking skating coverage. How do you deal with this much interaction?”
Without looking at them, he finishes off his water bottle, tosses it into the trash can, and returns to the ice.
John skates one circuit around the rink. As he’s approaching his coaches, he breathes out. He can do this. He can do a lutz, he can do a quad, what’s both of them combined?
Sherlock’s thoughts peter out into quiet as the pain fades to a dull, ignorable ache, his husband warm against his back and their daughter warm inside of him.
Dinner that night is an interesting affair in which Sherlock cooks some purple meat (“Elk, John”) with a knobby root vegetable that is starchy but is not a potato and a strangely geometric green broccoli-like plant. All turn out to be delicious.
But then John is working another finger in, because Sherlock is that easy to work open, and Sherlock isn’t saying much anymore. John’s cock throbs. He gives it a gentle little squeeze. Soon, buddy.
John finds a spot, parks, gets his things out of the trunk, and tapes the key to the bottom of the exhaust pipe. No longer being behind the wheel of a car lets him sink into a tired fog. He is vaguely aware of navigating the check-in process and security, and of finding their gate. Sherlock has barely gotten out the words, “I’ll watch our things as you nap,” before John has put his backpack under his head, laid out on the floor, and nodded off.
John doesn’t ask what samphire or a crisper is, but he can figure it out. He makes his supper, which falls rather short of Sherlock’s usual creations, and eats it in front of Jeopardy.
Jackie Wong, @rockerskating, is famous for tweeting real-time breakdowns of skaters’ performances and scores. He also runs a podcast, Ice Talk, with another sports journalist, Nick McCarvel. Following him teaches you a lot about skating and fast, as he knows more about skating than most people have ever forgotten.
featuring excerpts and neat things I find during research--because, to the best of my ability, this is a pretty damn accurate fic, and I've got the five goddamn pages of notes to prove it.
The map app on John’s phone directs him to take the exit onto another highway. He does so. “What are you, then, my coach?”
John manages to swing his legs over and stand up with an almighty groan. He stretches his arms up. The apartment isn’t unbearably cold, but at this hour it’s a bit chilly. He’s regretting his choice to sleep bare-chested.
—the way his ribcage lifts and spreads, stretching and straining against the taut, firm curve of his belly. A powerful surge of lust spreads red over John’s vision. He plants his feet, draws up his knees, and bucks up just as Sherlock plunges down. Sherlock’s back arches at the sudden stab of sensation, which in turn increases the angle of penetration and lets John drive that much deeper. He cries out, too, and it may be from more pain than pleasure but oh, fuck, John is already past the point where he’s willing to put his moral code above Sherlock’s desires to throw caution to the wind.
An indeterminate time later, something tugs Sherlock’s consciousness back to the surface. He wakes, but does not open his eyes. What woke him? Oh, there it is—someone’s hand is at his wrist. The hold is gentle, not tight, just lifting it up and away from his body.
Immediately John can feel Sherlock’s body tensing in a way he knows well by now, and he knows he has to take his pleasure now. He grits his teeth and fucks him faster, his grip on Sherlock’s leg tightening and tightening until finally–
what Sherlock is like, and John will decide that it isn’t worth it. For some unidentifiable reason, Sherlock cannot abide the thought of this. He cannot bear to think of what he will do if he loses the opportunity to mean so much to this one man. Perhaps it is because he knows, in his heart, that this is likely his last, best chance.
They retrieve their belongings from the overhead and file off the plane. They are halfway to the baggage claim before John checks the time and realizes that he’s expected at work in fifteen minutes. He calls his boss’s phone, knowing he won’t pick up, and leaves a voicemail like a coward, explaining that he is quitting. He texts his students to let them know they’ll need a new coach and recommends a colleague he knows is good. Mikayla is the only one to respond.
“Work a job, and you’ll see,” says John. “Oh, shit, where should I park? For that matter, what am I doing with my car?”
“You don’t want my name down as your primary coach. It’ll look bad for you. We’ll be working with Lestrade.”
John hears Sherlock a few times: shuffling sounds, a few curses, occasional violin music. He had seen the violin lying carelessly about, and Sherlock mentioned that he played, but John hadn’t heard him before this. It’s beautiful, virtuosic if he’s being honest. He supposes he shouldn’t be surprised. Sherlock does nothing by halves. Of course he’s a genius at this too.
Oh, fuck. Sherlock’s prick, already starting to harden again, painfully plumps up further. His heart pounds in his throat and he moans from the pressure of it.
John spends his morning working with Greg and by himself. It’s an interesting change. What with Sherlock having only John to work with, John generally has someone coaching him at all times. He feels slightly unmoored without anyone giving him feedback. But by the end of the session, he has worked what he knows he needs to work on (mostly the hateful loop, which he has successfully dodged having to do in his short but will have to include in his free program) and is loose and relaxed.
This was originally half of one chapter, but I split it into two shorter ones because it felt better that way for pacing reasons, and also because these chapters have been around 4-5k and it would’ve been about 7-8k if I kept it as one.
Step and choreographic sequences are the parts of a program that a lot of casual watchers look at and think of the “boring” part, because there are no big jumps or spins and it’s hard to understand what they’re actually doing. A step sequence is a series of steps and turns done in either in a straight line (a midline down the center or diagonally across the ice), circular pattern, or serpentine S shape across the ice. There are requirements about the steps/turns a skater must do. A choreographic sequence is basically just “go hog wild, just no big jumps or spins.” You might think, “Oh, that part looks easy, I could do that.” After a year of working on them, I can almost consistently do two basic kinds of turns. Step/choreographic sequences are my personal favorite part of a program, as I feel like they’re where the skater can really do something unique. There are a number of moves sometimes done in choreo sequences that are just beautiful, such as
John finds that the public announcement lit something in him. Telling a small circle of people that he was returning to competition didn’t quite feel tangible enough for him to believe it. Now that the world knows, it’s real. It’s happening. He throws himself into training with renewed zeal, and soon Sherlock is shouting at him less and less and he’s landing his jumps more and more.
(scroll down a bit) with a slightly less pretty one. I like when the skater’s upper body forms a nice, smooth teardrop shape.
Sherlock still does not look up from his laptops, but his hands aren’t moving and his eyes aren’t scanning. “Oddly, the drugs appear to be the least of my crimes. More offensive is the idea that Lestrade is tolerating a notorious doper only because I am exchanging sexual favors for employment opportunities.”
“We were talking about how I got here, which cost what, to you, is a considerable sum. The next logical thought is how you will afford the costs of being an elite athlete, as you are not a wealthy man and sponsorships will be thin on the ground. Hence, I felt it was necessary to reassure you that you don’t need to worry about the money. I will not require a fee for coaching or choreographing, as I am supported by other endeavors. Your expenses will be paid.”
It’s more languid now, and easier. It is not Sherlock, it’s John. Not the John on the ice, but the John on the sofa watching college basketball, the John doing yoga with Sherlock at 5:30 in the morning, the John who tells Sherlock he is amazing. It is, a tiny bit, flirtatious, because this is a John who has never seen a pretty girl and didn’t look a second time.
“I can see you made this edit of yourself skating to a BTS song. How many of your accounts are teen girls?”
As they watch, Sherlock leaps into a triple axel at the far end of the rink. He lands forward, swinging his arms, but does not fall.
Privately, John wonders how he can make enough money to drop five grand on a spontaneous overnight trip across the country by “dabbling.”
Sherlock is so vulnerable right now, and so very helpless. It makes a small, dark, sick thing deep inside John feel unspeakably powerful to see Sherlock Holmes reduced to this, and to know that he is the only one permitted to see it.
In the video, the youthful John Watson receives his score, a personal best, and claps his hand over his mouth. His coach jumps to his feet to cheer, then thumps John on the back while John still sits in wordless shock.
Sherlock ignores him. He goes to the pantry, grabs a bag of Sun chips, and retreats into his room again.
The music begins with a sharp trill from the violin followed by a complicated run, underlined with staccato chords from the piano underneath. It then launches into a liquid, decidedly Latin melody line led by the violin, with the piano acting as accompaniment. A light percussion line keeps rhythm in the background.
“I’m surrounded by madmen,” John says aloud. “But then, I came with you, so I suppose that says something about me.”
Sherlock’s mouth curls up in the smallest hint of a smile. “He didn’t have any hairs left to go gray.”
He rolls his hips and drags John's hands up his body, one to cup his eminently squeezable tit and the other to splay over the full curve of his belly. John's words break off into a groan. Sherlock responds in kind, and his smooth pace takes on a steady rhythm.
-Would you rather I update whenever I finish a chapter (remember, I'm shooting for every 2-3 days) or on a particular day once a week?
about the proliferation of Moulin Rouges. It’s quickly become what skating fans call a “warhorse,” which is a musical selection that’s been done to death. (Swan Lake and Carmen are classic warhorses.) Just off the top of my head, without resorting to Google, I can list off the following athletes who had Moulin Rouge programs in the 2017-2018 season: Vincent Zhou, Ashley Wagner, Virtue and Moir, the Knierims, and Manta and Johnson. And that’s not a comprehensive list. If you only watch one, make it
Snogging is a logistical challenge when an extra twenty-five pounds are introduced, particularly when those twenty-five pounds keep kicking someone in the ribs. They work it out in the end, though it’s sure to prove too great a strain on John's shoulder eventually. John braces his hands on the sofa back on either side of Sherlock's head and kneels with his legs outside Sherlock's. It isn’t ideal, and John still feels like he’s squishing their firstborn a bit. But God, he can’t not touch this man.
“No!” Sherlock calls out. John stops where he is. Sherlock skates over to meet him there. “Turn around.” John does so, and Sherlock puts his hands just below his waist, over his hips.
And the little wooden box is under his bed at all times, where John will never, must never, see it. And Sherlock always wears long sleeves outside of his bedroom.
But Sherlock, once his mind is set, is nigh impossible to dissuade. John can see the stubborn spark in his eyes. He fought in Afghanistan; he knows a lost cause when he saw one.
“Saw @sholmes at 4CC tagging along behind Greg Lestrade like a lost puppy. If Greggy weren’t the #1 best dad then Shoelace would be living on the street.”
that he can feel it all the way in his clenched teeth. It doesn’t last long before the insatiable itch flares up again, and he pushes himself up on his overworked legs and resumes his pace.
John goes to bed to the distant sound of Sherlock running through a melismatic arpeggio on his violin over and over, the same five notes. It should be grating. Instead, it’s beautiful.
As they get their skates on, John side-eyes Sherlock’s. What kind of equipment is that? The boot looks a little like a Riedell, but it’s not any of the models John is familiar with. And the blades say they’re John Wilson, but not which kind. John laces up his well-worn Edeas self-consciously.
Sherlock’s breathing immediately evens out, as if he’s relieved. His head falls back on the pillows. John laughs.
When John doesn’t see him by the next morning, he privately wonders if Sherlock is peeing in jars like Howard Hughes. He wonders if there’s a mini-fridge in Sherlock’s room, if he’s subsisting off of granola bars, or if he’s eating nothing at all. John’s seen him skip meals, so he knows he can go a while.
As the sun comes up, Sherlock finishes the final measure. He allows himself a satisfied smile. Just a little while longer. He’s nearly there. It’s just the editing and the recording now. How long can that take? He has the ultimate power over his body.
John tries not to think about how hot and tight it is around his fingers as he pushes a third in, and how much hotter and tighter it’ll be around his dick. Sherlock’s other hand is around his knee, pulling his leg up and back to open himself up for him, and really, that is about it.
He rips off the headphones, tosses them and his mobile alike onto his bed, picks up his violin where it is perched over his laptop, and begins to play.
—like he's sinking into a hot bath, or letting himself sleep after days of keeping himself awake—is the most utterly intoxicatingly sight John can imagine.
John groans full-throatedly at the blissful feeling of enclosure, and Sherlock makes a sound like the air has been pressed from his lungs. John rubs his hands up and down Sherlock’s trembling thighs.
There is something he was supposed to do before he slept, Sherlock remembers. It is fine if he sleeps on the couch for a few hours, but there was something else he was supposed to do first. What was it?
This sets off another fit of laughter. “My God, how do you make a living off of being constantly unemployed?”
John pulls into his driveway. Harry’s car is not there, which means either that she’s got a late shift at the Walmart or she’s decided to do her drinking at the bar in town. A knot settles in John’s stomach. Considering what Sherlock saw in him based on one video and a once-over, how much more will he see in a house? You don’t have to be clever to figure out what his home life is like.
Sherlock is throwing his bag to the side and rushing onto the ice without even putting his skates on. John’s anger at someone startling him mid-jump evaporates as soon as Sherlock steps onto the ice and starts doing an awkward sort of shuffling slide to get to him. He looks like a limping penguin. Greg snorts.
So, for Nano this year, I decided I would try to complete a Bakerfield chapter every 2-3 days. Now, every 2-3 days I wrote roughly one typical Bakerfield chapter's worth of words, but this particular chapter turned out to require...slightly more words than expected. By which I mean that it is about twice the length of the longest chapter prior to this one.
“On-ice for another two hours, and then we’re going to the gym. How familiar are you with the Gyrotonic system?”
“I don’t even know what it would look like to only go to the gym three times a week,” Sherlock is muttering.
This time, he skates out of the marked combination with the rugged, “aw, fuck it” determination he brought to the triple axel, the one that Sherlock told him he could land after seven years of falling off of single jumps. He takes the adrenaline that the body floods itself with when it falls and converts it into positive energy, into his arms and body and legs and feet. He lets himself move faster than he wants to, leans into turns in ways he hasn’t done in years. Once or twice, he does fall, but he picks himself back up and keeps going.
Sherlock is taking him deep now, and John is fighting not to fuck his mouth. He chances a look down and his eyes nearly roll back into his head at the sight–his cock nearly balls-deep in Sherlock’s mouth at its apex, and Sherlock–Sherlock with his own jeans undone and the hand that’s not steadying the base of John’s shaft working himself, and John realizes there’s something else he wants.
Through the haze of pain and ecstasy, Sherlock hears himself letting out brief little cries every time John stabs his hips forward. It jolts his pelvis and strains his already-overworked back, and it
When John was first really gaining competence with his triples, he was struck by how hard it was to breathe while he rotated that many times and at that speed. The human body was never intended to move like that, after all. For that split second of air time, a skater has to override those instincts, force past the point of no return, and become something different, something more.
This isn’t the Sherlock he knows at all. This is someone else, the Black Swan herself perhaps, and that’s why John’s heart is in his throat and his skin is tingling like a weak current is running over it.
Sherlock grimaces. “You plainly don’t believe the story the media told, or you wouldn’t be here. It isn’t that you don’t care. You’re a person of strong moral character; you would never have stayed in Pennsylvania after your mother died if you weren’t.”
John looks heavenward. Sherlock still says this on occasion, and John has given up expressing the insanity of the idea. He mentioned it to Greg at one point, expecting Greg to be the voice of sense and reason. Instead, Greg had shrugged, smiled, and said, “You never know what can happen.”
“Thanks! You too.” John is fairly sure he isn’t lying. He hasn’t really paid much attention to anyone else on the ice, outside of making sure he doesn’t run into anybody.
The kiss is meant to be reassuring, but it turns slow and languid and promising. John gets a good hold on Sherlock’s bum, despite the obstruction. Until relatively recently, this would have been where John brought their groins into contact and rocked them together until Sherlock was speechless with want, but current circumstances are preventing full-frontal direct contact. Sherlock seems to pick up exactly what John is doing, because he squirms restlessly against him, back and forth between John’s hands and John’s body. Sherlock curls his fingers in John’s hair, which triggers a tingling sensation that trickles down the back of his neck and down his spine.
rink, and he’s alone. No, wait—Sherlock is there. John can’t see him, but there is someone behind him with his broad, long-fingered hands on John’s hips, and John knows it is Sherlock even before he hears Sherlock’s deep, low, delicately accented voice.
Sherlock doggedly fights his fading body as the night wears on, forcing his body to keep pace with the music in his head. In the wee hours of the morning, he reaches the final stretch. This section picks up again, but it is no longer about Sherlock’s nebulous emotions, or about John alone. It’s about John with Sherlock, John doing a triple axel just because Sherlock told him to, John who can’t land a jump unless he’s
I'm especially interested in the Mycroft/Sherlock/Mr. Holmes dilemma. Formally, John should be thinking of both of them as "Mr. Holmes." But then you've got the challenge of keeping them straight in the non-dialogue bits, and some of the dialogue. In Greek Interpreter, Watson generally calls Mycroft "Mycroft," and Sherlock "Holmes," with a little flex. But since Mycroft is sort of higher-ranking in this Watson's hierarchy, I can't justify John calling him "Mycroft." I could make Mycroft a baronet who wasn't using "Sir Mycroft" before this point because he doesn't use the title, generally, but I don't know if that makes sense as something Mycroft would do. HELP!
“I know, I’ve talked to the women they tried to put you with for pairs,” John says solemnly, and that makes Sherlock smile. “It’s just...if not for you turning up at that rink in Catawissa, I’d still be sharpening rental skates for birthday parties. You brought me back to life, Sherlock. More than that, even. You brought me to a whole new level of performance that I’d never dreamed was possible even before I got injured.”
Sherlock sighs dramatically and does not look up from his phone. “Although I do my best not to notice anything that Anderson does, the strained tenor fighting his way through ‘Nessun Dorma’ is unfortunately inescapable, and the fool is using the Hugh Jackman version of ‘Bring Him Home.’”
Sherlock plays the emotions into existence, the unnameable, unidentifiable, red, roiling bile in his stomach. He plays until his wrist creaks and his elbow is sore and his fingers have indentations in them from the strings, and when he knows he has played the right notes into existence, he hurriedly jots them down.
“The idea of cheating is detestable to you. Ergo, you don’t believe it.” Sherlock aims the full force of his gaze on John. “I need you to tell me why.”
Pain, it seemed, I could suffer. Failure, terror, starvation, and disease; all these were as nothing to me when compared to nothingness. Even here, a few months' quietude had me screaming out in the night in desperation for
Is he talking faster? He seems...brighter, somehow, more energized. Maybe it’s the break. Sherlock does seem to fade before John does.
When he’s picked himself up and dusted the ice off his pants leg, Greg and Sherlock are both grinning.
“My Korean and Italian are slightly weaker in conversation, although I pass for fluent online. The Italian also speaks French and English.”
“I expected you to stay here and be family, John,” she snaps. “How am I going to pay the bills by myself?”
He shuts the door of his room behind him and takes a moment to giggle, before clapping a hand over his mouth.
John’s stomach drops. It’s Greg Lestrade. Oh God, he’s even dreamier in person, with that gorgeous bone structure and full-on silver fox look.
He eats breakfast and makes his own lunch—simple enough, since all of Sherlock’s usual lunch supplies are easy to find—and goes to the rink by himself.
“Well, the percussion is synthesized, and the piano is only me on my keyboard, and I’m only a mediocre pianist, so it could be improved upon significantly. I can record it properly this weekend with some musicians I know in the Colorado Symphony. I’ve already gotten in touch.”
He reaches up, bats Sherlock’s hand out of the way, pinches his nipple between his thumb and forefinger, and tugs
John sticks his tongue out, then flops over sideways onto the couch, Sherlock’s spare iPad in hand and a PDF of the ISU handbook open on the screen.
John catches him before he falls over and lowers him onto his side. Sherlock’s cheeks burn with embarrassment, and somehow, John detects that too. He kisses the back of Sherlock’s head.
It shouldn’t bother him, seeing John talk to them. Mary and Molly both tolerate him, even if he can’t say they actually like him, and would not tell him anything that would drive him away. But watching John flashing his brilliant smile at them as they giggled at his silly jokes had made something hot bubble up inside of him that he could not name. He had almost opened his mouth to say something cutting. Instead, the turmoil in his chest had curled up his spine and into his ears as a melody: sharp violin, percussive piano, and a light but precise rhythm underlining it all.
Figure skating fans, don’t @ me for not assigning John to Skate America! Non-fans and newer fans, as best I understand it, generally, skaters get a GP assignment for the competition in their country. So a Japanese skater would be assigned to NHK Trophy, a Canadian to Skate Canada, and John, an American, to Skate America. But there is Someone I don’t want John meeting who definitely needs to be at Skate America, and also if Yuri on Ice can get away with not assigning Yuuri Katsuki to NHK Trophy, then I can do what I want.
After several more attempts, John retreats, nursing several new bruises, to the bench for a break, where Sally and Philip are chatting. As soon as John approaches, the conversation stops abruptly.
