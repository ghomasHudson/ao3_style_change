Thor looked at him like he was an idiot, and to be honest he probably was at this point. “Are you seriously trying to defend yourself after all I have said, do you know why he acts like that. He gives us nicknames as a sign of affection, he talks the way he talks as he trying to push us away as he’s scared to get too close as he think we might hurt him. Don’t you get it, he trying to protect himself” Thor shouts.
The trio all look shock at the words that Fury spoke, since when did he like Stark there was more going on here than they thought.
Peggy looked up and gave her son a big smile “ darling what a lovely surprise, how have you been?” She asked.
The fingers roughly came out of his mouth “ that’s enough” Rogers spat and in one swift move he shoved his fingers into Tony’s hole.
The man gave a low chuckled “well don’t worry about him, he’s mine to deal with and mine alone just make sure I got what I needed to make this plan work alright” he grunted
“I gotta go mom, but I’ll se you in a few days so you won’t miss me too much” he joke. Peggy gave a small chuckle at her sons attempt, “Darling I know you don’t like your birthdays but I like to give you something that you might like to have, I get someone to send it to you” she said.
“You don’t like that Stark is in your team, whys that doesn’t he provide the weaponry and security that you need” he ask calmly.
Steve was confused and wanted to speak out, but Clint jump in there first. “Hold the fuck up for a second? What is going on here, who are you and who do think you are attacking the leader of the Avengers?” He growled. Tobias wanted to answer back tell him who he really is but just the look on his dad eyes is telling him not to, it could be dangerous.
That shock Tobias, he just thought that his dad and mom were just young lovers and made a stupid mistake. But never in his life he expected that confession, then instead of asking more questions he just ran.
“Your training begins now, the first step is to find your inner soul, to connect with it. Once you find it then the next steps will be easier, your soul is the one that holds the energy the most, the one that protects you from yourself and others. By connecting with it you’ll become one and you will feel tranquility” Thor explains.
So that was a 6 months ago and well things got even stranger. The mandarin, god that was a pain and the PTSD didn’t help either. But it was all fine in the end, well almost, tony promise Pepper he will stop being iron man but in the end he couldn’t, so Pepper had to let him go. It hurt he thought they had something but Tony knew it was too much for Pepper since the battle of New York.
They both calm down and look into each other’s eyes, they both didn’t know what to say. There was so much to talk about, so many apologies on Steve’s part mostly “Tony I....” He started but Tony interrupted him “Look Steve now it’s not the time for that, we got more important things to think about and to be honest I don’t want to talk about it” he said seriously.
Fury grunts and motions Steve to follow him, “come on then, we better go back and you better pray that Tony will be willing for you to help him” Fury said as he walks out of the room.
Tony sighed sadly, he tried to hold back any frustrated tears that threaten to come out. “Look, I went out and meet with someone. Someone who is important to me ok, And I didn’t kill the Lieutenant and his wife I would never hurt an innocent (Well except for Lily) person. Mrs Marks and I had a disagreement which doesn’t concern you at all and this whole conversation is completely pointless, so if you don’t mind I’m going back up to my floor and call  Pepper about the situation with her” he finish and just as he was about to leave, Steve laughed but it wasn’t a genuine laughter it sounded cold, empty.
Tony smiled, then headed to the elevator to the common room. He’s not panicking, it not like they are mad at him for leaving abruptly and making a scene with that woman. It’s not a big deal, all he had to do was go in, get the food then quickly leave and spend the rest of the morning with his son before his mom and Davis join them, simple really.
Tony just rolled his eyes “seriously I’m healthy fuck you very much, anyways you better go Rogers you don’t want the team thinking we’re together do we now”
Tony smiled at himself, as he saw his boy sleeping so peacefully it made him very grateful that nothing horrific has happen to him like it happen to Tony.
Tobias might know what this could mean, obviously it has something to do about his dads past, could it be....
As Tony open the door the first thing he spot was a sleeping form of his Bambi. Tony was relived and he quietly walk to have a closer look at his son.
The creatures eyes grew darker, and then raised Its claws ready to strike, but Tony was ready. As soon the claws strike down towards Tony, he in turn raised his fist up to prevent the attack. And as they both connect, Tony didn’t feel any pain from the creatures claws, in fact he felt warm. He didn’t realise that he had his eyes closed, and once he gently open them that’s when he saw the creature at a stand still.
“Actually, Steve is still at the bar talking to my husband” a woman’s voice spoke behind him and it send him a cold chill down his spine. No this can’t be her, no way.
John chuckled lightly “sure thing kid, have fun at the gala alright don’t get into too much trouble” he teased and Tony smirk back “ oh you know me trouble is my middle name” and then Tony was gone.
“ when we were looking at my old files there were some old houses that was under Daniels family, but when we looked into it further there was no lead” Davis informs them through the video call.
Tony gave Thor a bitter look “ we are just different people, he wants me to be something I’m not and he hates me for it, which I can’t blame him for I’m what I portray to the press, to SHEILD so I don’t give him a good impression of my self” he said quietly
It’s then that Tony notice a small light below him, at first he thought it was his reactor. But when he looked down it’s then he saw the necklace he was wearing was glowing. Was his calmness to do with this he wonders?
Steve felt he could cry at those words he failed, he didn’t save Tony. He took a deep breath, right now it’s not the time for self pitying he needed to come up with a plan to rescue Tony from this Daniel guy and he needed to do it quickly.
Of course Rogers wants to see him after the little stunt he done well I was he had to face the music.
Tony chuckled with no humour in it “Yeah no shit, that’s what you keep saying but yet I’m not improving maybe because I can’t connect with my soul” he spoke bitterly looking away from Thor you was opposite him in the forest of rebirth.
It shook him out of his thoughts, his eyes are wet and blurry. Tony rubs him face and turned towards the people he cares about the most, they all looked worried and that’s when he realise he might just had a panic attack in front of them, damn that is embarrassing.
Tony had a slight panic about the situation, on how much Tobias had heard, how much did his mom and Davis heard. And Steve been punch not once but twice.
Tobias looked at Steve with murderous eyes, and strangely Steve felt intimidated. Now he shouldn’t feel that way not to this kid, but the way his green and brown eyes boar into his soul make him feel unsettled.
“Because I’m sleeping with him” he said bluntly, not really sure why he said that and now he regretted those words.
“I wanted to talk you really talk to you but during the Hydra fiasco I didn’t want you to be involved and put you in danger again, so Peggy had an idea that to put a bit of me in that neckless in some what help and speak. But it was suppose to happen sooner but I guess things don’t go always according to plan”.
“Don’t you dare speak to him like that who the fuck do you think you are?” The kid growled making himself look taller to intimidate Steve. Steve looked at the kid a bit more, he look like he was in his late teens he was tall but not as tall as he was, maybe 5’10-11. He had dark brown hair and his eyes are unique one green eye and the other eye is brown, it was strange that this kids brown eye looks exactly the same chocolate eyes as Tony’s.
Stark looked at him for a moment like he was thinking about something, but with a sigh he spoke to him in a gently tone “sit cap Ill you a batch too since your here and all” and he motion Steve to sit.
But they diminish over time and now, there only but few who still process the power that his mother gifted them.
Tony was confused were are they going “ wait aren’t we going to train at the training room?” Tony ask and Thor just chuckled which tony felt a little bit insulted by.
“But I thought you and Steve are on better terms, aren’t you romantically bonded?” Thor ask innocently.
Tony looked at everyone he was scared at telling them what has happened in his life. Even though Thor already knows about his past, he was scared what the others would think about, his abilities, his kid and his rape. But he doesn’t have a chose he needs to do this to protect his family and his friends.
Tony just raise an eyebrow “really, well you know how I love myself after all Natasha wrote that lovely report about it” he said back. Steve heavy sighed “please Stark can we just talk like normal people without any sort of animosity, just please” he beg. And Tony was surprise at Steve’s tone he sounded defeated, maybe this was Tony’s chance to speak out and form some understanding with Steve and maybe the others too.
A knock on the door brought him out of his thoughts, he hope it wasn’t Rogers again he didn’t want to deal with him. But luckily it was Maria, “Sir are you alright?” She asked kindly.
“Jarvis send me up to the penthouse who you please?” Tony ask as he enters the elevator. “Certainly Sir, and May I say that young Sir is awake and was asking for you. Would you like me to inform him that you’re on your way?” His AI asked him.
The helicarriar battle was bittersweet, him and Rogers work surprising well and spy chick got her man friend back so all was good. But agent- Phil died, the idiot trying to fight someone who was out of his league. But Tony respected him and he will miss him, damn it, Tony was piss and Loki is going to pay for all of this.
“No Anthony, we need to go somewhere that we won’t be disturb by the others” he simply said, with that Thor lifted his hammer then there was a bright light. Tony had to cover his eyes for a second, but the light vanished and tony open his eyes to discover that he wasn’t in the work shop anymore or even the tower in general. It was a forest, there was a big open space in a shape of a circle and around them are trees, huge trees, Tony never seen anything like it before.
You see when Tobias was a 13, he got curious about his mom and wanted to know where he came from. Obviously his dad was extremely young to have him so something about his birth wasn’t right.
“I never blamed you for that you know, I never once thought it was your fault I got raped. The only people I blamed was those people who did that to me. Even though I wish it could have been differently  a good thing did came out of it I got my son who is becoming a man of his own I’m proud of him” Tony said trying to lighten the mood in some fucked up way.
He notice that wrist were cuffed and he was stretch out in a T position on the bed. Now in a panic, Tony open his eyes and looked at his surroundings. He notice that he is in nothing but just his boxers which made his stomach turn a bit. But what he finds is that he isn’t in his room at the tower, instead he’s in a large white and red coloured room.
“Sir it appears the Avengers are working together to find us, you in particular. Our spies said that Agents Barton and Romanoff are at the location were Mr and Mrs Marks were killed and they also said Director Fury and a man were seen together at the SHEILD HQ” the agent reported
And the icing on the fucking cake was good old Fury came back to talk about the super secret boy band which Tony refuse before and what a fucking surprise that Fury brought in a spy “Rushman” who Tony thought was his new PA that Pepper brought in after he hired her to take over as the new CEO of SI. But turns out Miss Rushman's actual name is Natasha Romanoff who works for a super secret government call SHEILD.
“Well what do you know, I guess you do follow orders after all” Rogers tease which brought tony out of his daze.
Howard was looking at him with what appears to be joy but yet sadness as well. “I’ve been waiting for you for quite some time now, but I’m glad you made it” Howard softly said as he step closer to Tony.
Back again, sorry it took so long had a little bit of a writers block and I’ve been very busy recently too but I’m happy o got to finish this chapter for you lot :)
“Yeah J please tell him to meet me at my lab immediately” he said as he walk towards the elevator. “As you wish sir” Jarvis simply reply.
Steve then proceeds to follow him, as they are walking back he kept thinking how much he has fuck up and hopes to god that Tony is alright and just maybe Steve will be getting some answers as well, but also  there was one thing for sure Thor is gonna kill him when he finds out, god help him.
“So.... are you three fuckers are going to tell me what was that I saw out there?” He questions them with a sneer. Before either Steve or Natasha could answer, Clint the idiot like he always is jumps in first. “It was Starks fault sir, what Steve said to him was the truth and he’s in questions for the Marks deaths, which I personally believe were murdered” he finishes with a smug look and at this point Natasha slaps him across the head.
That got tony curious, what did she mean by that. “Ok mom I bite I like to see what it is” he replied. Peggy just smile “good, now you better go darling and remember I love you”
A large warm body was pressed up against him, but he felt the man shift. He knew that the man was up, he looked at the time 5am god why does he have to be up so early every time. The man got up and went to the bathroom, Tony pretend to be asleep and waited for him to leave. A few minutes later the man got out the bathroom and was about to leave the room until....
He can see how Anthony cares for everyone even though they don’t much care for him and that breaks his heart to see that. So Thor tried to make it better by telling fascinating stories about Asgard and it’s magic to make Anthony happy which make Thor happy after all Anthony deserve happiness.
“Why so scared Tony, aren’t you having fun” the Male whisper was closer to him now. Tony panic, he kept flailing his arm to try to push him away, but to no avail.
But not time for that there’s a gala waiting for them, “everyone ready to face the leaches” Tony jokes, Clint and Natasha just stared at him while Bruce and Steve kinda smirk. But Thor gave a big laugh “we are ready for battle Anthony, let’s all get Out of this limousines of yours shall we” Thor boomed.
But anyways Steve shake his thoughts out of this head, “who the fuck are you kid?, who let you in here?” Steve questions. But the kid ignored him and went straight to Tony.
Steve didn’t know what to say, everything that Thor was saying was true. Steve tried to think of ways to defend his treatment towards stark but he couldn’t think of one, was Steve really that blind and clouded by anger that he didn’t realise that stark has given him a place of safety and comfort.
“Very well, make sure our men are ready for the assault” he ordered, “yes sir” the agent replied. Daniel then proceeded to leave, but as he was walking he sees the general leaning against the door “so you got everything ready Captain?” He questions with a arrogant smirk on his face.
Rogers just smirk at him probably admiring his own handy work after all they did fuck throughout the night.
“Tobias I’m..” “Don’t, you spoke to much already it’s my turn to speak” Tobias interrupted him and Steve quickly shut his mouth. “Dad has always loved you” he stated which makes Steve widen his eyes in shock, Tobias saw his reaction and continued. “Yeah I guess your surprise huh? He loved you ever since he was a child grandma told so manny stories about you that made him admire you. But as he got older it got developed more than just hero worship” Tobias smiles for a moment thinking back when his grandma told those stories about his dad. But then his smiles flattens when he continued “But after he was assaulted, he started to resent you for time due to my grandfather being more focus on you than him during that time. However he couldn’t resent you forever grandma always saw a look in his eyes when he look at you in a photo, it was the same look she use to do herself when she look at you” Tobias turned to Steve looking at him in the eyes and for a moment Steve thought he was looking a Tony. They both look scarily the same, the fluffy brown hair, the same nose, same mannerism and one very same chocolate eye colour the only difference is the other eye being emerald green. It amazes Steve that Tony kept his son a secret he seems like an amazing kid,he couldn’t blame him though for not telling him after he’s done he hopes maybe one day when all of this is down maybe could spend time getting to know the family side of Tony’s life.
“Please Steve just stop being an asshole ok, look I know you hate me and you think Im disgusting, but can you honestly say that I’m capable of murder” he plead hoping Steve would just back off.
Tony suddenly heard the door open again, well that was quick he thought. “When you said you’ll take a second, I didn’t think you meant it literally Steve” he laughed. Tony was expecting a laugh back but instead he got something else, someone else to be precise.
Tony was surprise that his family was apparently different from any other and that got tony curious about what he could do with his gift and if he could master it, maybe he could help his son and train him better to help him protect himself.
She guess that Clint just wanted to take his frustrations out on someone who is from the same social group. Both of them know that he was in the wrong and Natasha will have to talk to him about seeing a therapist again once this is all over.
But, even though he does feel guilt, he doesn’t however feel any regret. When him and Stark had sex, Steve never felt anything like that before, the rush, lust,  the passion. It wasn’t like he had before not with those girls he slept with before and after the serum. And back in the 40s he did had a quickie with a couple of the men who were also in the army, who just wanted to feel something other than pain. And this was different when he slept with Peggy. With Peggy it was passion they made love and he definitely loved her more than anything.
They got to the tower into Tony’s penthouse. Tobias was thankful for that as he thought for a moment he was actually going to die, “oh thank god I didn’t die” he breathed out. Tony just rolled his eyes as he got out of the suit, oh don’t be so dramatic Bambi” he tease, Tobias pouted which is cute in Tony’s opinion anyways “if the shoes was in the other foot dad you won’t be saying that would you” Tony chuckle “kid the sass on you is killing me” he tease “And I wonder were I got that from” Tobias smirk.
“Have you fuckers stop being petty children.. hm?” They didn’t respond, “Good” Fury continues. “To answer your dumb questions the Marks deaths was not an accident you are right in that regard “ Clint made a smug grin from that comment. “However, Tony did not kill them and will never do that, so I have no idea what you idiots have been smoking to think of that” he spats and the team wince at that.
Tony smiled to himself and turned around to look at the view again. He was on thought about the recent event with Steve, maybe this is the time to set things right with him and hopefully with the rest of the team too.
Steve opens his eyes and he is shock to what he sees. They are not in the tower anymore, instead it was a large dark forest, with the largest trees that he ever seen in his life. “Where are we?” He whispers, It was Tony who responds to his question “Well Cap, Thor calls this place the forest of rebirth, this is were I’ve been training for the last several weeks” Tony told him, but he got a feeling that Steve was too amazed to even listen to him.
“Oh by the way speaking about your mom she ask me to give you this, I was hoping to give to you sooner but I just can’t send to your tower after all security will be all over this” he said as he left leaving Tony confused. He remember his mom telling him that she got something for him on his birthday but honestly he thought she forgot but he guess it’s not appropriate to send it to his home.
It was them Steve scoff “I don’t know anymore Stark, so here’s your chance to tell us where you went last night” he said firmly. Tony was nervous now, he knew that the Avengers didn’t care much about him well except for Thor and sometimes Bruce too. But do they really think so low of him? Does he have to confess his past, his son? Why is life so unfair to him he just can’t take it anymore.
Tony rolled his eyes and turn to look at Rogers. You know it’s strange for the last couple of days or so Rogers hasn’t spoken to him, fought with him or even touch him he’s not sure he miss that or not.
Steve look like he just struck gold “Really? Yeah sure I promise, lead the way... Tony” god why did he had to say his name like it was the most precious thing the world.
They tried to speak but fury wouldn’t let them “I swear to god if you try to interrupt me I’ll fucking through you out off here do you  understand” He ask in annoyance. They all nodded.
So Tony told him how the training is going and how he constantly gets blocked from getting to his soul. Once he was finished he looked at John and finally said “ I don’t know what to do John, like if what Thor said is was true and my family is different from everybody else then how come I can’t master it like he said”. John gave him a sad look, “Well it seems to me you need to talk with your mom about this more than me kid. I can’t help you on this one, but what I do know is that you’ll be able to figure it out you always do” he said with a smile and Tony could only smile back at him he was right he should talk with his mom about this.
Thor glared at Steve for a long moment but looks away and let’s go of him in disgust. “You’re the one who doesn’t deserve respect Captain, your not the man I thought you might be it’s disappointing” he said with sadness in his voice.
And not only that there was a mad man named Vanko with electric whips who decided to attack him at the Grand Prix.
With a pleading look in his face he tried to defend himself again “but... but Thor..” he trailed off but Thor decided he had enough of Steve’s excuses.
“The name of our abilities can be different around the world, we call it wolf sense, while other may call it truth seeker or even eagle v....” at that point Tony quick with his hands preventing Natasha from attacking him with a knife. “Nat what the fuck are you doing” Clint blurts out, Tony rolls his eyes “relax Legolas Nat here wasn’t going to kill me” he said simply which confused the team. “But Tony how can you be sure” Bruce shyly ask, “because he’s using his ability on us Bruce” Nat stated.
P.s i just want to ask everyone if someone could help me find a Stony fic that I’ve been trying to find on here for ages. Story is that the avengers are trap by a villain who has a magic staff that shows a persons past and he uses it on Tony which shows a lot of abuse from his childhood. I know it was completed and it had I think 7 chapters . If you guys know then feel free to comment that would be a big help thank you 😊.
“Sir, it’s 3:30AM. Your currently at the avenger tower in your penthouse, you are safe sir I can assure you that you are not there. Please take deep breaths...” Jarvis continues to calm Tony with his words.
Steve a blush little bit at Clint’s words, “uh yeah I guess you can say that. Look I don’t really like Stark, we are not lovers, partners or whatever romantic thing you like to think, it’s just sex, it’s good for the both of us really. We don’t shout as much at each other as we use to do and we are more civil which is good for the team, I am not jealous that he may or may not be sleeping with other people” Steve stressed.
John came back with a wooden box in hand, “here you mom told me once that this was pass down your family for generations and who knows maybe it’s  something that could help you with your training” John hands him the box as he sits down beside him again.
“I see, I’m glad you both are alive. I’ll stay here for a while and what I can discover until son of coul and Hill arrive. I’ll come to the hospital once I am done here” Thor told them both, and they nodded and went on there way.
Tony just chuckle with no humour behind it “ seriously Thor, look I know that you and brucie bear are my bros but the rest of the gang are part of the hate tony club. If they found out they’ll think I’m a freak and probably kick me off the team,
Without warning Rogers pulled out and carefully uncurled Tony’s legs off his waist and placed them down on the ground. Tony can feel Rogers cum leaking out of him he doesn’t if he should turned on by it or be disgusted.
Fury was surprise at how Tony found out about Daniel, but right now that wasn’t the point. Despite was people thought he cares for Tony and would do anything to protect him.
He made it ground floor were the rest of the avengers were, all of them wore a nice suit, though Rogers wore his military uniform instead and Tony’s definitely was not turned on nope no nada. And of course Romanoff is wearing a beautiful long red silk dress properly get a lot of attention from a lot of men.
Was the first thing Tony heard was his name bouncing off the walls, what came after that was Steve storming towards him after he saw him coming out of the elevator. Behind Steve he could see Natasha, Clint sitting at the counter eating breakfast. They look some what angry at him, which Tony knew that could be a possibility from last night but this seems different some how.
Daniel gives him a sinister smirk and a deep chuckle. “Oh Tony you have no idea how badly I want to hurt you” He then proceeded to spread Tony’s legs wider and thrust in one fluid motion.
“Steven Grant Rogers, what do you think you are doing?” Peggy growled which scared Steve for a bit. “Peggy, what are you doing here?” He ask with a shaky voice.
Steve’s face even look more enrage from that statement, and then proceeded to grab Tony by the collar and pulled him closer to him. In any other situation this would be hot, but right now Steve is pissed.
“I’m sorry and your right I didn’t mean to think I was apart of his life, but I really do hope he’s doing well” she said quietly. Tony sighed “yes he’s doing well, he’s the best thing that’s ever happen to me he’s a good kid better than me” he said to try and give this woman comfort but also feeling a little sweet revenge that having his Bambi didn’t ruin his life, god that’s just fucked up.
Tobias bit his lip in frustration, but he understands his dads reasoning, “Yeah okay” he whispers. Tony looks at his son with sadness, he decide to walk over to him and hug him tightly “it will be ok Bambi” he whispers to his son and Tobias hugs him back.
Tony snorted “yes spangles, yet again I disobey your orders and so what my plan had work we didn’t need to use your plan as that would certainly took up so much time. so you could thank me now or later as you can use up all your free time and at the gym hitting more bags or better yet go find your bestie” tony brag but on inside he was nervous but he couldn’t show weakness not to him.
Bruce sighs in relief he’s glad that Natasha was ok. Though Bruce immediately blushes as Tony gave him a look. “What?” Bruce said to Tony, “Don’t mind me Brucie bear I’m glad you’ve found someone to keep you company” he slightly teases which made Bruce even blush harder.
“So, I guess I’ll start by saying that I come from a some what unique family” he starts he can sense Clint was about to retort but he put his hand up before he could make a tasteless joke. “By saying that it is regard to my birth, you see Maria isn’t my biological mother, Peggy is” he confess.
To his surprise, Steve’s had a shock look to his face he but he didn’t seem angry or disappointed. “yes!, I mean yeah of course I’m happy to do that just let me know the time and place ok” Steve replies almost too quickly. Well this is awkward, the silence was not what Tony had in mind he better finish this before it gets even more unbearable, “ok cool, great so urr... I’ll... yeah  right great see you later cap, better go” he said try not to sound nervous.
Rogers didn’t slow down as he was chasing his own orgasm and continue his brutal pace, until tony heard him moan, then Rogers stilled for a moment as his seed was covering Tony’s walls.
She showed him the photos and they talked about Anthony and the Starks and SHEILD, time went by so quickly that Fury forgot that he had to finish those files that he been working on as soon as possible. it was a shame really, enjoyed Peggy’s company she’s one of a few people that he allowed to call him Nick.
“Sorry” he mumbled looking sheepish and couldn’t look at them. Then he felt a gently hand on his upper arm. He turned and saw his mom looking him with worry, “Darling tell me what’s going on?” she asked kindly. Tony looked at each person and when he saw his Bambi who nodded, he gave a sad smile on return. Tony sighed and looked at his mom “it’s a long story mom you better sit down” he said, his mom gave him a gently squeeze as a sign of comfort “Ok darling tell us in the beginning” . And that’s when everyone sat down and Tony begins his tale.
Tony didn’t know what think of her plea for forgiveness, he was never going to forgive no way that’s for sure but she seems sincere maybe prison did some good, probably.
Clint hated stark, he was so arrogant and flaunts his fortune at anyone’s face to show how much better he is.
Well fuck my life, Tony thought. Since that lovely visit from Fury things turned in a rather strange turn.
With another sigh steve thought it was best to go to bed himself. Once he went under the covers, he pry that it would be a peaceful sleep.
However he was taken out of his thoughts when he heard his phone ring, he sighed and turn over to were his phone is and grabs it to see who it is.
Tony sighs “Right now I need to get change for my training with Thor. And in the mean time the penthouse is yours to do as you please, just don’t break anything ok Bambi” he said jokingly. His son gave a small chuckle and they both went to their rooms.
Tony nods his head “thanks J”, then he turns to his family and smiles, “it’s now or never” he said and Peggy give him a comforting squeeze on the shoulder. Tony turns to the elevator waiting for Fury, Steve and the others it’s now or never was his thought one last time as the elevator doors open.
Tony could see Natasha face change like she felt that the situation here was wrong, “Steve I think...” she started but Steve interrupted her. “I don’t think you would be a killer Stark although you did make weapons that killed hundreds if not thousands of people because you were careless to check where your weapons were going” He sneered. Tony froze as he was back up against a wall, how could Steve so heartless, so cruel to him, by bringing up his mistakes.
“What’s going on captain, why are you here really, it seems you came here for a different reason?” Fury asked calmly.
Steve took a deep breath, then he opens the door. As he walks in, he could see thor sitting on the couch eating some pop tarts.
Once Tony was dress, he went to the kitchen were everyone shared to grab a quick cup of coffee before he leaves. Once his coffee was ready, he took the cup and the smell of strong African coffee beans was beautiful.
Thor heard the door open and proceeded to turn in that direction with a smile “Ah Anthony, glad you could ma....,” he stops short when he notice Steve behind Tony. Tony notice this as he can see Thors aura change from calm to anger, he can also notice Thors fingers twitching like he’s ready to call for his hammer.
He sat on the couch for god knows how long, with a probably cold hit chocolate in hand. Tony didn’t what to do, he had so many questions mainly towards Fury.
Tony could feel a chill down his spine, like someone is behind him, touching him it wasn’t pleasant that’s for sure. But despite it all he didn’t move, he didn’t run. “Well Well well, looks like little Anthony hasn’t run away, ooh what a shame I do like chasing you among other things, hehehhehe” the creature spoke with the most chilling laugh.
But for now she is more curious on what’s going on between Steve and stark. They hate each other she knows that, but their behaviour has change. They don’t argue as much as they do and she even seen them walk together, but she seen the marks in stark so it’s a given that they are coping with each other in a more different way than a normal person would do, probably Starks idea no doubt.
But shockingly Rogers doesn’t scoff in disgust, he laughs and he smiles shyly. “Yeah I guess I was distracted by your ass..ets” he joke. Wait what did Captain Spangles actually made a joke, all of the sudden Rogers laughs. Shit did he say that out loud, “I’m afraid you have” Rogers said teasingly. Both of them just laughed and for Tony this is really the first time they’ve been... kind to each other.
Tobias look at his dad in shock and in fear, he knows this is serious if his dad is crying. “Will you tell me once we get to the tower?” He ask whilst gently patting his dad shoulder to give him some sort of comfort.
Tony slowly turned around and suck a sharp breath at the woman who hurt him all those years ago. “It’s been a long time Tony, I was hoping we can talk” lily that was her name Tony remembers. That same woman you beat him, that same woman who fucking raped him along with Daniel and those two other guys, this bitch who tried to ruin his life but instead gave him a beautiful son.
That was a long time ago and things have change a lot since then, after he was rape, Tony struggled a lot and didn’t know how to cope. John back then was just a cope trying to help Tony in anyway he can and when time past and after Tony’s not so great coping mechanism. John help him with his training when his mom got ill he was there for him and his son and he will never forget what this man has done for him.
Thor just nodded and gave him a proud smile, “then begin Anthony I’ll be here to guide you so do not be frightened”.
After Steve left, Fury just slumped down back into his chair, fuck what a mess he’ll probably need to talk to Tony to make sure that he was alright and to also inform him about the file that he just received. For fuck sake Tony’s is going to be devastated.
It was time everything went to plan sure there were some mistakes but they manage to separate some of the Avengers from the Tower, and now it’s time for their final attack. “How long until we arrive” Daniel ask his agent “ETA will be around 15 minutes at the most sir” they replied. Good he thought not long then soon his bot will be his finally, he grins widely to himself.
Though he gotta admit he does miss MIT, so maybe going back and get another degree in engineering wouldn’t be a bad idea.
Fury groans “you know not to call me that no one calls me Nicky it’s Fury ok, Peggy Peggy come back!” But she was gone leaving Fury standing in the hallway. Fury sighed dammit why was he friends with his boss anyways he thought even though he was trying to suppress a smile.
The man at the door chuckled “It sure has Tony, it’s good to see kid” Tony scoffed “you do realise I am 32 right” the man could only laugh “Tony, you will always be a kid to me since I first met you at that hospital” he jokingly said back. Tony chuckled at the mans humour, “Well can I come in Detective John Davis or do I need a warrant” Tony teased.
Tony was worried that his mom was worse but also was relieved that she might be able to recognise him today. “Ok thanks for letting me know, um has anyone else visit her recently?” He asked.
Really loved Peggy and it pains him knowing that he missed so much from her life. When he found out that Peggy was still alive, jump at the chance to see her. When he arrive to the home, he so hope that she will recognise him. As he went into her room, he was shock at how different she was, how much older she was. But she was still breath taking like when she was in the 40s.
Before Bruce coup continue his ‘talk’ with Hulk, Natasha and Thor enter the room and it’s fair to say Thor did not look happy.
“I can gather some samples from the crime scene and analysis it to find any clues” Bruce chimes in as well. This surprise Tony they believe him and they willing to help. He wanted to cry in relief but now there’s no time for that, “thank you” he breaths out, he looks at his family who look proud at him of he just done, then he looks towards Fury “So Tony you got a plan on what your going to do?” The Director ask. Tony turns to Thor and smiles “yeah I got a plan, I guess I need to tell you why I can hold the hammer” he said, they all listen to him once again.
Natasha was confused on why steve wanted to see fury, what did thor day to Steve. “ Steve why do you need to see fury for?” She ask him.
Clearly he’s hear for a different reason Fury thought, but first need to deal with these two idiots. He look at Romanoff straight in the eyes and simply said “No”.
Now his family was surprise at first his grandmother thought he would take over SI someday, but his dad always said he can be anything and didn’t have to follow the path that his grandfather gave his dad.
Hope you all like it and keep a look out for the next chapter it going to be interesting though I’m not sure when it will be posted but hopefully it won’t take too long.
“Now it’s not the time for jokes Stark! What hell were you playing at  last night, with that woman, the lieutenants wife no less, do you know what that could cost us. The lieutenant was not happy and the press was sniffing around, and Ms Potts had to deal with the situation herself. She had been stressing throughout the rest of the night, what do you have to say for yourself” Steve rages as he pushes Tony away from him with force. Now Tony would never admit to anyone about this, but he was scared in that moment. Sure him and Steve fight constantly, but this is a new level of anger he never seen before, and that frightened him.
Thor looked at him for a moment, he was surprise how Tony is acting and it quite worried him, but if Tony wants to train now then he can ask his questions later.
It’s difficult for Bruce, he at times likes tony. He understands Bruce’s mind and how it works, they can science all night long and never get bored.
he felt honoured to be told of this part of Tony’s life and he swore to himself he wouldn’t tell a soul. And with the information that tony gave him, he develop a plan that would benefit Tony’s training.
Bruce felt happy but at the same time sadden, “you’re conflicted” Peggy said, that surprise Bruce “how did you...” “it’s what Tony told you earlier our family has an ability that can see people auras which also shows your emotions as well” ‘ah’ Bruce remembers “oh yes, and your right I haven’t been a good friend to him, don’t get me wrong I care for him I just... well I should have been there for him more I’m sorry” he apologises and looks down in shame.
It was awkward to say the least Steve didn’t know what to say for how to leave without making Tony think it was because of him. But then Steve look at Tony’s neck and notice the neckless Tony is wearing “I never seen you wear that before” he stated and Tony looks down to look at his neckless “ur yeah my mom gave me this on my birthday apparently it’s special” Tony said to Steve. “It’s beautiful, it suits you” Steve compliments without realising what he just said, Tony looks shock and he was blushing furiously which made him look adorable in Steve’s mind ‘god sake snap out of it’ “um what I meant to say is... um well ur” Steve stutters. Tony was looking at Steve with an amused look and then he suddenly giggled which he hadn’t done since he was at least 12.
He was angry, at the world, at himself. And what would he do, he’ll take it out on missions, the punching bags and at stark. He knew that stark knew Peggy as well much longer than steve knew her. And he can admit that he was jealous, angry that stark had that luxury so he took it out on him the most, which wasn’t fair but Steve didn’t care.
Tobias locked himself in his room, crying into his pillow, wondering if what his dad said was true and his mom was this type of monster. But how could that have happen and why did that happen, he wanted to know but at the same time he didn’t want to face reality at that moment.
But he knows that would be childish and fruitless, what he said was wrong and perhaps too far. But there was so much that happen that he’s got more questions than answers, like who was that kid? , was he really Tony’s son?  and if so then how is that possible. The kid look like he is in his late teens and Tony is only 32 and if he is Tony’s kid then that means Tony was very young himself when that kid was born. Steve felt his stomach tighten, something was very wrong and he needed to know what the hell is going on with Tony.
But before she left she wanted to say one last thing to Nick, “ oh by the way, he’s your godson too so I expect you to look out for him” she smiled and starts to walk to the door.
“But come on, that Rogers guy was horrible towards dad. what he said to him and things they done before it just makes me sick okay. And if he’s following dad everywhere he might hurt him again” Tobias said with sadness and worry in his voice.
“No, not this time you dead ass woods” he mumbled to himself, usually he would run but running away seems to him ending up back to real world. So Tony decided to try a different tactic, he can hear the creature it was coming towards him, “Anthony, oh Anthony we’re coming for you” a distorted but yet a familiar voice spoke.
And Tony standing there in shock, with blurry watery eyes, he wondered who the fuck punch Captain America in the face.
“Thank you Anthony, this helps a lot come along it time to show you were you’ll start training” Thor stood up then grab his hammer.
Lily smiled for a bit at his words “thank you for telling me” she simply said. But then she frowned “But this is not why I’m here, I need to warn you about something” Tony frowned “really and what would that be?” He ask.
He repeatedly knocks on door and rings the door bell for good measure. He was about to open the door by force, but the door creek open and inside was Tony’s very sleepy boy.
But life turns out for the better, in the end Tony made a new element and also had a ‘heart felt’ message from dear old dad ‘greatest creation my ass’ tony thought to himself.
Bruce is in between he talks to him nicely enough and they science too, but the first couple of days Bruce was, you could say disappointed which tony felt guilty.
Then a big alien invasion happens, but the team fought them with all they got, then there was a missile aimed for New York, so tony did one thing that he could do, take it to space and so he did and what he saw up there terrified him. He almost died but didn’t, they arrested Loki, went to shawarma it was good Tony thought and then they said goodbye to each other as they wanted to do there own thing except for Bruce Tony manage to convince him to stay and become science bros. Tony shook hands with Rogers and apologies and so did Rogers but it wasn’t genuine he thought, god how did his mom even love that man tony will never know.
Daniel smirk at him “Why you ask, Well it’s simple really I want you. Ever since we first met as kids I’d loved you from that moment, I wanted to be with every step of the way” he said with just sincerity and Tony believe once upon a time that they could have been together Tony had similar feeling towards his once best friend, but now Daniel has become monster that Tony could never forgive. Daniel continues “But unfortunately you had to open your big mouth tell your daddy about it and i had to move away.” Daniel frowns at him with anger. “ Look Daniel I didn’t know that would happen” Tony pleas and Daniel chuckles darkly “ oh I know and I really don’t care if he knew that we kissed but what I’m more pissed off of your father than anything. You see my dad was a double agent and when I was at your house that time I had a little mission to complete but I failed and Howard found out and did some digging and sent my father away, whilst I had to be separated from you” Daniel finishes. Tony realise in that moment that being in Hydra was a family run business for Daniel “your father was in Hydra?” He ask and Daniel gives a patronising clap “correct, well done darling , yes both my parents are from Hydra luckily your dad didn’t figure out my mother was Hydra so she and some family showed me a few things and I have to say I love working here” he smirks.
The leader walk away and went to his personal office and picked up a small photo that had two young boys in it. Whilst looking at the photo he smiled to himself, his plan was finally coming together after all these years of waiting, soon he will have what he wanted, soon he will have his Tony back and couldn’t wait to get started.
Before the mission, Rogers ordered him to stay by Clint side, to always catch him when needed to and to be his eyes. But instead, tony, whist Rogers was blabbered on, Tony got Jarvis to scan the swaps and find there weakness, well it turns out according to Jarvis they had very sensitive hearing. So what did tony do, he got Jarvis to hack into any loud speaker, any radio, tv and anything else that could produce high volume sound. He also ordered Jarvis to tell anyone in a 10 mile radius to leave the area after all he doesn’t want innocent people to get hurt, he orders Jarvis to turn everything on to its highest volume and what do you know it work and the so the mission was done and dusted, sure there were loads of broken glass from shops, cars and apartments but who cares tony can easily replace it. And it also cause people to have a massive headaches but at least the killer swaps are gone.
Tony thought for a moment but his parent instincts kick in and decide to physically go and his Bambi. “No thanks J , I’ll just check myself” he said as he walks out of his room.
Tony sighed he just wants to go home, and beside he needs to see someone today anyways. “Look Thor can we try this again another day, I got to go somewhere anyways before the gala tonight” he asked
“Why are you telling this” He rasp, “because he said to me he was coming for you again, he talked a lot about you. He’s still obsess about you like all those years ago and he knows about ou- your son” she admits, and that panic Tony even more “WHAT!! How? Did you tell him” he voiced with fear. Lily panic “No no I swear I don’t know how he found out, but he told me he knew his name and he knew where he could be found” she told him.
Stark around, he looked ill, pale even. He was all wide eyed that enhance his already brown doe eyes, which Steve will never admit to stark how attractive it was.
The door behind him open which brought Tony out of his thoughts and looked behind him and he was surprise to be Rogers that open the door.
Rogers was trying to order him to come back, but that was pointless tony just wanted to go somewhere safe and it was only one place he could have think of.
Tony froze at that moment it’s been decades since he last saw him. Daniel certainly has change, he’s gotten taller, got more muscles on him and he’s got a large scar down his right eye. Daniel finally reach the left right side of the bed, he smiled but this wasn’t a warm welcoming smile at all and Tony felt nervous.
Everyone was on edge at that point, even though tony and some of the team don’t get along, however they do agree that a civilian should not be harmed in anyway.
Everyone nodded in agreement and they got into the vehicle, Rogers and Tony were the last ones standing outside it was a bit awkward at first until Clint shouted at them to get their asses in.
Fury took a moment and sighed, they better be right “ Fine but this is your last chance you understand, no more judgements no more hurtful words you got me” the trio shock their heads in agreements. “Good Agent Romanoff And Agent Barton go and find Doctor Banner and Thor and meet us in the common room” he ordered them “Yes Sir” they both said and walk out of the room.
“Nat, Tasha can you hear me?” A male voice echos near her, Nat moans in response. She slowly opens her eyes and notice that Clint is looking at her worryingly. She also notice he has some superficial injuries to his face but what she could see was nothing major.
There was a slight awkward silence until Rogers speaks, “come on guys let’s go before press start thinking we change our minds” then Rogers was the first one to get out of the limousine.
He likes Anthony, but others don’t and he knows why they don’t. Anthony puts on a mask to hide his pain, his insecurities. Thor can see it maybe because he’s a god and his mother trained him to read other beings.
Tobias in turn smiled back, “yeah that sounds great dad” he said before he hesitates to ask his question. “Um dad” he said shyly, “hmm yeah Bambi” Tony said whilst he was rummaging in the fridge. Tobias took a deep breath, Well here goes nothing he thought, “What’s going on dad, I know you’re trying to act fine and you want me to feel safe, but right now I need to know what’s happening. Hell you took me from my dorm to here in the middle of the night, you can’t tell me that’s normal dad because it’s not, so just please rip it off like a band aid and just tell me” Tobias ranted.
But life moves own he gets to love another day and be able to see his son grow up and he also dating pepper and tony can say he’s grateful for that.
She looked at him straight in the eyes, “I’m here because my husband was invited to come here Tony” she spook gently. But Tony wasn’t having any of that, “don’t say my name like that as if we are friends and what do you mean husband aren’t you supposed to be in a prison or something?” He spat.
No one bothered them there, they hiked all around the woods and saw amazing wildlife. And when it was dark they both lay on the grass and look up to the star it was beautiful. He miss those day with his mom, and when she got sick they couldn’t go there anymore. But maybe he could go there with his son, they did go there when his little Bambi was just a kid, who knows once Tobias finish college they could go there together to celebrate peacefully.
As they about to leave Thor made his appearance at the entrance, “are you okay Lady Natasha?” He ask. “Yes nothing to serious my shoulder is a bit sore and my burns are just minor I just need to put cream on them” she replies.
Then Fury looked at him directly in the eyes “well then you better be right or otherwise I’ll keep my promise do you understand” Fury said darkly, “Yes Sir” Steve whispers.
Thor gave him a sad look and sighed “No, don’t say that Anthony you can find your soul trust me what I’ve seen proves to me you can do it. You just need to believe in yourself Anthony” he said kindly.
Once he was done there was a long pause, Tony didn’t know what to say or how will John react to his rant of the century. But sure enough John spoke “So what’s it like being trained with a god that must be an honour right?” He just said like it was a joke.
Tony sends Thor a grateful smile, “Thanks point break, I am trying I swear it’s just hard you know” he told him shyly. And in return gave him a kind genuine smile “ it’s alright Anthony we got all the time in the world. Now I must go, enjoy your meeting young wolf” then he was gone.
He breathes heavily and with tears running down his face he didn’t even realise he was crying. “Why Howard, hmm tell me why you left me and for fuck sake don’t beat around the bush and tell me why you’re in my fucking mind?” He questions to his father.
“I said you are wrong” Tony sneered loudly looking directly at the creatures cold died eyes. “I’m nothing of what you just said, You discarded looking wet tea bag. I’m not that scared little boy anymore you hear me, I’m a fucking superhero. I got a team now I’m not alone anymore, so you can take that lord voldemort  like attitude of yours and shove it up your ass” he spits out with confidence. Tony feels different somehow, his heart isn’t beating out of his chest anymore it’s calm.
Clint saw the device and knew what it was “Natasha look out!!” He yelled whilst quickly grab her by the wrist and tried to pulled her when the large explosion threw them to the ground, everything went dark to both of them.
“That’s different point break, at least your abilities are more useful than mine, and besides your liked here and also cap and Bruce are like as well it’s just me” tony tried to explain
“Sorry Pepper, there was a bit of traffic going on in the streets I should have called I’m sorry I didn’t I’ll get JARVIS to remind me to call you next time” Tony said sincerely. Pepper was taken back by his apology, she was ready to tear him a new one, but then again Tony looks worn down. She hasn’t seen him properly in weeks or was it months she wasn’t sure. But seeing him now, maybe she has been a bit too hard on him.
But Thor continue, “However, there were other people who fought them with great passion. My mother saw this and she decided without even telling my father to pass a gift to these certain individuals. The gift my mother pass down was to help them see these kind of threats that not any normal human could as you are well aware of” Thor smirk in that last sentence and tony could only just nod.
“Sit” she ordered, and Steve complied. They sat down and Peggy look at Steve for a moment, how did this happen, what made him act like this Peggy wanted to know it hurts her to think that Steve was capable of being a bully, he hated them and now he’s one of them.
Tobias looks at his dad again realising how much emotional pain he is in he sighs and relaxes a little. He smiles at his dad and Tony smiles back, “come on kid, let’s just go, we can talk about this later ok” he said tiredly, he just wanted a nice morning with his son and now it’s ruined he just wanted to go back to his penthouse and cuddle with his kid and watch some Disney.
The mission was like something that came out of a cheesy scifi comic book. The mission was simple kill all the giant swaps that are invading New Jersey like what the fuck. Apparently a made scientist created these insects but they got loose and well his own creations killed him along the way.
“Master Thor, is currently in his quarters. Would you like me to ask him that you want to see him?” JARVIS replied, though Steve felt that Jarvis sounded coldly towards him.
In an odd sort of way they became closer after that, they went out together more often, they went to the workshop together and his dad has even been there for his training they are happy sure they had there ups and down but who hasn’t.
Tony was in his bed room putting on his tux, his suit fitted just right and his beard and hair was styled perfectly. He looked down to his bed were the box that Davis gave him, he probably ask his mom tomorrow about them but for now he just grab the box and place it in his draw which is next to his bed.
Thor was deep in thought, what tony just said about the captain, Thor will need to have a talk with him about his treatment towards Anthony. But first Anthony was the main priority here.
Once Tony and Thor parted ways it’s was already 9am, Tony could guess that his son would be up as he is an early riser, god knows why, no way he got it from Tony that’s for sure.
Now tony was piss Rogers doesn’t know nothing about him, “oh really and what’s that spangles” he asked
“Sir I’m afraid that Captain Rogers is still asking to speak you, he’s not taking no for an answer. He also said that he will wait all night until you let him in Sir” Jarvis reply’s
“I wouldn’t know, only my mother had those answers, but before she died” Thor again gave a sad look which tony felt his heart break. But Thor continued “.. before she died, I told her about you all and the fact you are one of her children, she was interested in you and look through your past, your family. She had this look like i never seen before and told me that your family were different from the rest and it was my duty to train you to help you enhance and master your gift to its fullest” he spoke about his mother with pride but also sadness.
Steve could only shack his head in agreement he didn’t want to open his mouth to say anything else that Fury could find offensive. Fury just grunted “Good now get the hell out of my sight” he shouted and with no further agreements Steve bolted out the room.
“Please, don’t treat me like a fool. Don’t try to defend your actions as that’s just pitiful at best. You want to know who’s the bully one here captain, it’s you, you’re the one who treats Anthony differently then anyone else who lives here, you’re the one and including Natasha and Clint who berates Anthony, puts him down like some dirt on your shoe. You use his body for your own selfish pleasure, but yet do you ask what Anthony wants,  no you don’t you just assume that Anthony would enjoy it or do you just don’t care if Anthony feels pleasure or pain” Thor growls.
Pepper looked up at tony and gave him a glare. “ have you get your phone recently tony, the avengers have been trying to reach you for hours. I’ve tried to reach you for hours, have you forgotten what I was planning for you today” she said coldly which tony will never admit scared him.
“Yes general, despite some minor set backs we got everything in order” he spoke with irritants in his voice. He knew the general since he was a child and help him trained throughout his child and teenage years, but when he went to prison the contact between them stop for a while but that was because the general didn’t want SHEILD knowing who he was and his associations with Daniel. But after a few years the contact came back but also making sure there evidence of this interaction, and when the time came the general got him out of prison and few months ago and since then they were making there plans.
Tony was grateful that Steve didn’t argue, they didn’t want a repeat like last time. Tony took a breath and closed his eyes and he felt himself going into his inner thoughts, he can feel a change too something tells him that this will be the day he will meet his soul, he has to find it in order to protect his family, his friends from that the monster he once called a friend.
“Oh that’s easy, there’s two reason why you’re here do you want to here them?” He taunts and Tony resisted to roll his eyes but instead he glares at him. Daniel laughs at Tony’s glare “aww aren’t you adorable, ok so first reason is because I want you here, you’re going to be my pet for as long as I want darling” he grins wide which scares Tony. “And the second reason is because me and Hydra know your little secret you got some special eyes or maybe more and we want to know what it is and see what we can do with it” he reveals and this shocks Tony’s how did they know about his abilities were they spying on him? Is someone he knows a mole?
“Yeah me neither it’s been a long day hasn’t it. Jarvis still hasn’t found the location yet but I am hopeful that he’ll find my dad soon” he stated as he walked over to the couch and sat himself down. He motion Steve to come and join him, but Steve hesitated for a moment which made Tobias snort “at ease solider, I’m not going to hit you again unless you give me another reason” he grins. Steve can’t help but be nervous around the younger Stark, since that terrible fight he had with Tony, all the disgusting things that he said and Tobias heard it all had him riddle with guilt.
He moaned into Rogers mouth, then the kissing stop. Tony tried to case the kiss, but he realised it stop he open his eyes to find a very smug Rogers in front of him.
Rogers face contorted into fury “god you’re arrogant, why did fury let you on this team I will never know, your nothing but a spoiled little rich brat who got everything that you wanted and never had to work a hard day in your life. You’re nothing like us Stark.
Steve realise that he hasn’t spoken yet, so quickly snap out of his thoughts and looked at Nat with a smile. “ I appreciate that Nat but I’m not really ready to date anyone for a while”  he said simple. Nat just nodded like she understood and then continued reading her book, whilst Clint was just cleaning his bow, leaving Steve to his thoughts.
Rogers frowned at that statement “no I guess we don’t want that do we, and besides they would think why I would fuck you in the first place. But you’re right I don’t want to out stay my welcome now do I, see you later Stark” and Rogers just slammed the door.
He gulped the coffee down as he was in a rush, the cup had been empty he was ready to set off, until he heard Rogers voice “You shouldn’t really drink that down fast it isn’t healthy” he said with a disproving tone.
To Thor’s surprise Steve laughs which he felt slightly offended by. “ oh god thor that’s not what we are that’s just ridiculous. It’s just sex, something like a stress relief for the both of us, it’s easier to deal with Stark that way. I didn’t realise that you care about stark that much how come?” He said through a chuckle. Thor felt slight anger towards Steve, how dare he be disrespectful towards Anthony in front of him. He knew that some of the other avenger didn’t like Anthony, he could never understand why they do. But saying this in front of him he would not stand.
Though didn’t find his inner soul which was frustrating to say the least. However something had shifted, Tony left a calling to him, though he couldn’t get to the calling but it was a sign he was getting close.
Howard had a look of shock and guilt in his face ‘too fucking late for that Tony thought’. “ I’m so sorry Anthony, I wish... I wish I could go back and fix my mistakes that I did to you, I thought at the time if I push you to a certain point you’ll become a great success and surpass me that’s how my father taught me. But I realise that was wrong and what my own father did to me was abuse and in turn I became him which I wish I never wanted to become” Howard takes a shaky breath “ I... I shouldn’t have left you I was an idiot and a coward I didn’t want to face that had happen to you and knowing it was my fault that happen to you” Tony look confused at this point, after the rape happen he never once blamed his father for that he only blames bone for leaving but never the rape itself.
The three Avengers were knock off their feet and hit the ground hard, Tony needed to get his suit fast, but a grenade came through the window and smoke filled the room ‘sleeping gas’ ‘shit’ Tony thought this is not going well he hopes his mom and son are safe but as he slips into darkness he saw a few pairs of feet coming towards them then Tony descended into darkness.
It seem to work sort of and as Clint nodded with a big sigh. “Your right” he said, this is when he heard the ambulance sirens, “good they’re here, come on let’s get you up” he said to Nat.
Howard looks up at his son, he left some sense of relief in his son’s words “Thank you Anthony that’s means a lot. And I’m glad that Tobias is doing well, you’re a amazing father I wish I was there more for him and for you” he spoke with regret in his voice.
Steve grunted down to the floor in pain, Tony stood there shaking and in shock to what just happened. Steve and Tony both turned their heads to see who did it and to Tony’s utter surprise he whispered “Tobias ”.
“Tony how did you..” Steve tried to speak but Tony interrupted him “It’s a long story and as everyone is here I guess I start at the beginning with you guys” he tried to smile but from the way Steve was looking at him he failed in that regard.
“And as for the youngster his name is Tobias James Stark Carter he’s my son, when I was raped a woman forced herself on me and she became pregnant with my child. Even though it was a traumatic experience I never once regret keeping my son he’s the best thing that came out of this” he smiles towards his Bambi and his son with tears in his eyes smiled back.
The man cackles and proceeds to kick Steve in the chest, he grunts in pain and clutches his chest. “Oh Captain, But I am taking him he’s mine and he’s also Hydras now, we don’t need your blood or that brainless mutt anymore” he said cryptically, this confused Steve what did he mean? what are they going to do to Tony?. This is when the man leans down slightly still holding Tony and whispers to Steve “I believe you know who I am?” Steve’s nods he knows that this man is Daniel “Good so you know I will take very good care of my boy, goodbye Captain” he said in a sinister voice as he gets back up he orders his agent “knock him out as well we’re leaving” “right” the agent  replies and they shoot the dart at Steve. He grunts from the sting of pain but he still tries to crawl towards the Hydra thugs “stop” He rasps but it’s too late they are gone and Steve couldn’t do anything he failed , he failed Tony and that’s the only thing he could think about as he falls into darkness ‘I failed’.
Tony step out of the elevator and walk in the communal kitchen to grab a quick snack, luckily he hadn’t spot any of the fellow avengers so tony thought he could get away from any grief.
Fury was sitting at his desk, at SHEILD headquarters. He was reading a file that some nervous agent gave to him saying it was urgent. Now Fury thought it was the same old thing, a Hydra base that needed to be dealt with.
“ I was wanted to know a few things about Stark that’s all I need some calcification” he said and then process to walk out of the tower.
Steve’s been lying in bed for god no’s how long a few minutes a few hours he doesn’t know. What he does know he just had sex with Stark, Howard’s son. His friends son.
Once Tony reach to his son apartment without anyone seeing him, he made sure JARVIS jack the security cameras.
He continues to giggle which Steve found adorable and also made him laugh. They never laugh together and well Steve enjoyed Tony’s laugh and wanted to hear it more.
Steve didn’t want really want to admit that he needed help, back in the 40s men who seek help are sometimes deemed as weak or crazy. But that was then and this is now so maybe it’s time to break that mentality and start a new. “Your right Peg, I got this friend his name is Sam he might be able to help me to the correct help and for what it’s worth, I am so sorry for what i have done Peggy” he said sincerely, Peggy he place her hand on top of Steve’s hand “I know” she whispered and with that they enjoyed a little bit of a moments silence before Steve had to and help the others.
“Um after you Tony” Rogers said shyly and tony was surprise Roger never used his first name before and to be honest he like that he it, Tony smiled and said his thanks, then got into the car. Then Rogers followed soon after, once everyone was in the limousines drove off.
“Tobias that’s enough” Tony sternly spoke which made Tobias wince a bit. “Look I know that your angry at him, I get it I’m a little pissed off myself. But right now it’s not the time we got a bigger problem now” he told his son. Bruce was now more concerned “what happened?” He ask, Steve turns to Bruce “there was an attack where Clint and Natasha where investigating the crime scene, Thor has headed to see what happened” he explains.
“I see, then I won’t say anything to the others, but tony I should stress that you are nothing like you portray to the press and the others should have seen this but apparently not, which is a shame on them and not you” he promise , which tony was grateful for.
Tony felt tears running down his face, once he finished his story about the last serval months. His mother was in tears but also has a angry look across his face , Davis didn’t look to please either. And his beautiful boy, his Bambi looks enrage about the whole “my team hate me” situation. God it was such a mess and didn’t know how to fix this.
“Look Steve, I haven’t slept with anybody ok, the person I met means a great deal to me and I don’t like your tone about them so back off” but then Tony thought something else about this situation and grins even though it wasn’t his best press smile. “What is this really about Steve are you jealous that I might find someone who actually appreciates me or is it the fact that you didn’t had a good fuck in awhile?” Tony questions him. But Steve gave a dark grin, oh god why did he had to challenge him, where the fuck is Thor or even Bruce.
Once Bruce arrived to the penthouse, but he only saw Ms Carter and Tony’s son. Now Bruce wasn’t gonna lie he felt awkward, since that argument between Steve and Tony and let’s not forget the whole revolution of Tony’s past he didn’t really had time to introduce himself. So right now he just standing on one spot not sure how to act around them. “Don’t need to be so nervous Doctor Banner, we don’t bite I promise, well unless you want us to” a teasing tone came from the young boy, who grins just like his father Bruce can really see the resemblance.
Speaking of Tony, he and his son Tobias went to the penthouse to spend time together before Tony went off to his training. Steve really wanted to speak to Tony but he knows it will be the wrong time now, and they needed to separate themselves for awhile, which made Steve sad but he knows this is the right thing to do now they can talk later.
Fury turns to Steve and Bruce, “I see that you couldn’t rest for a bit longer then Captain” Fury said. “Yeah you know there’s a lot going on for me to keep still” he replies to Fury, He Director snorted and gave him a nod to join in the meeting.
He was one his way to see Thor, but then he stop short as he saw his mom and Steve. “Darling are you heading to train?” His mom asked him, “yes mom, why don’t you go up to my floor and spend some time with Tobias?” Tony said nervously. At this moment Tony would never really admit it but he was nervous around Steve since the incident, he didn’t know how to act around him or what to say around him and judging by what Steve was looking he felt the same way.
God that was over 30 years ago back when life was a bit more simple. He wasn’t truly mad at Peggy for making him Tony’s godfather,
Once everything was said and done, the Avengers went ahead with there plan, Natasha and Clint went out to gather intel about what happen to Mr and Mrs Marks. Davis and Fury went to SHEILD HQ to look through Tony’s case when he was 13, to see if they can find any clues about Daniel whereabouts and his association with Hydra. Bruce went to his lab and looks at the samples that Fury has order his agents to give to him from the crime scene.
Thor was the first of to speak “glad you can make it Anthony you look wonderful” he said sincerely. Tony tried not to blush at that comment, and he was definitely trying to not blush under Rogers gaze. He kept staring at him it look like lust at first, who could blame him his tux fitted him perfectly and showed his ass...ets in all the right places. But when Tony actually looked at Rogers what he saw wasn’t lust it look like he was in awe but he couldn’t understand why. Rogers notice and quickly looked away from Tony with a red face it almost made Tony giggle, almost.
“So did you plan on assaulting that day was that Hydras training, to beat and rape a kid?” He ask in Fury, Tony always wanted to know why Daniel did what he did and might as well be a good opportunity to find out why. Daniel smirk, Tony could see his pupils dilating which made Tony shiver down his spine. “Why you ask? Well do be honest I didn’t actually know you were going to be there it was a very nice surprise, I was planning on finding you later on but instead you found me” he looks down at Tony and caresses his face which made Tony gag. Daniel continues “I was there for a few months my guardian at the time  was on a mission and he wanted me to tag along, and whilst I was there I met some lovely outcast and we decided to hassle some whores and that was fun Oooo they were fun weren’t they Anthony” he finishes with a dark chuckle.
Daniel grunted so his Anthony told them all about him, well no matter they could use to their advantage.
Stark roll his eyes and that grind Steve’s gears. Stark sighed “ I did sleep fuck You very much, but I couldn’t sleep for long so I decided to have some hot chocolate my mom said it helps with sleep” tony was surprise he even mention that part he must be exhausted if he’s talking about his mom. “Anyway you can talk spangles why are you here in ‘my’ kitchen?” He teased.
But Tobias did want to help his dad in some way, even if he currently didn’t want to inherit the company. So he made his decision, when he was 16 (he got to leave high school early because you know he is also a genius) he got into MIT just like his dad and studied mathematics and engineering he wanted to to know the basic at what the company was all about so a handy degree would be useful.
Thor continued about the special group of people and how they fought the bad guys for centuries. The tale last what seem like hours and tony couldn’t take his eyes off Thor when he spoke it was captivating the past that Thor speaks off was truly fascinating. His mom told him a similar story during the beginning of his training, but his mom never knew how their abilities came to be.
The trio were taken aback from the tone that their director voice, it sounded that he didn’t like what they were saying, but that couldn’t be right, right?
He turned his head and gazed down his arm and then he like an idiot he realised that his bracelet where still on his wrists, he laugh in surprise “God for a genius I’m a fucking idiot” he mumbles to himself. Of course Hydra wouldn’t think that his bracelets were anything but jewellery but oh boy were they wrong, this would help him break out of these.
“ hey dad um how am I gonna get to your tower exactly?” He ask with worry. But his dad just grinned at him “Your a smart boy Toby why I’m gonna take you to the tower myself” Tobias didn’t look convince that this was a good idea “I don’t think that’s a smart idea dad” he argue back with a frown. But Tony just laugh “hey don’t sass me kid I know what I’m doing” he vaguely explains, “Yeah right” Tobias mutters.
So Tony continue “but first we are going to have a big hearty breakfast and then after that I make sure that Daniel will never hurt me or you or anyone again” he said with determination in his voice.
“During that time mom was getting sick I guess  her memory got away with he” Tony said, “So was this what you wanted to talk about, our past and Hydra?” He asked.
But then all the shit comes back again two years later, SHEILD wanted him to be there consultant, well fuck them Tony wanted to say. But Pepper his beautiful girlfriend, the light of his life manage to change his mind and what do you know he was thrilled. A derange Demi god comes to earth and wants a war, well that got Tony’s curious mind going, so tony decides to help and went to Germany were all the drama was happening and along the way he meet, the lovely spy herself and her spy man friend , a man with anger issues who turns into a green monster,that tony loves and later they become bros, another demi god who is much lager and more attractive than his rock of ages brother and of course there was the 90 year old super solider who comes back from the dead that his old man wanted more than him what a fucking treat that was.
Both of them calm down from their laughter and just look at each other, Tony felt something there for a moment but he couldn’t quite figure it out, what was this feeling?
Fury eye widen, “is that right” he said coldly. “And why that give the information that you seek?” He ask.
Tony had to admit it would be good to have the others to have his back, but at the same time they don’t get along. Well mainly the twin spies and Captain righteous. But anyways how would that conversation come about anyways ‘hey guys just wanted to ask if you can help find a man who raped me when I was 13 and hobby the way his is my 19 year old son, let’s chat about the course of action’ come on Tony can do that.
Tony look at with sadden eyes he knows she wants to know why the others said those horrible thing to him but he guess it’s been long enough to ignore it.
Tony sighed and a small smile appeared on his face “ it’s quite late to talk, how about we get some rest and ask all your questions tomorrow ok Bambi?” He said with tiredness in his voice. Tobias looked at him with a sad look “sure dad, you promise?” He ask gently stepping closer to his dad “I promise” tony answer and they went closer to hug each other. Tony was so relived that his son was safe, but he would need to speak with Fury it’s no way he didn’t know about Daniel escaping prison.
Without any arguments the two spy’s nodded and left the room. Once they left the two spy’s ponder on what Fury meant, “Do you think he’s right Nat were we wrong about Stark?” Clint ask his friend. But Natasha just shook her head “I’m not sure Clint, but we sure as hell gonna find it come on let’s go” she told him and started to walk off.
Both the spy twins gave steve an unconvinced look, but Natasha was the one to speak first. “ Steve it’s ok to be a bit jealous, look Stark is known to be a slut and the fact that him and Thor seem to be close isn’t a surprise he does like his men to be pack with muscle” she joke. “I wouldn’t blame you to feel a bit down that another member of our team is also having fun with the spoiled genius. But you got to remember that this is what stark does how he uses his body to get his way in life so don’t take it to heart ok Steve. And besides I know a SHEILD agent that might be perfect for you”.
“Dad what are you doing here, do you know what time it is?” He said with a yawn. Tony smiled at his, ‘thank god he’s safe’. With out thinking he grab his son and gave him the tightest hug he ever gave, “oh thank god” he whispered which made Tobias confused “um dad what’s happen, is everything ok?” His son ask.
But Thor continues, “ if your s better man that all America thought you were, you stop hurting Anthony. You tell the others to stop hurting Anthony. But let me tell you captain if I ever hear or see that you continue this hatred towards Anthony, then I’ll show what I can actually do with mjolnir do you understand?” He ask with intimidation.
Fury was surprise to see her, he thought she wouldn’t come back for another month or two. “Ms carter what are you doing here, aren’t you meant to be resting?” He asked her.
A lot of teeth that biting into his lower lip, a tongue that was trying to gain access into his mouth and you know what tony let it, hell he embraced it nothing could fix anything like angry sex. Which surprise tony as yet again he didn’t expect Rogers to be into this, hell tony thought he was a virgin.
The house look the same since the last time he came here, which was around a year ago before the New York attack, he liked it here John look after him here sometimes and even trained him to along with his son.
After a second of peace a familiar voice spoke behind him “Ah so you finally made it”. Tony turned around and his eyes widen in shock.
With sheer anger, thor glares at Steve and within a split second he stands up and grabs Steve by the his t-shirt and slams him up against the wall, which caught steve by surprise. “Why do you hate Anthony so much, he has done nothing wrong to you and yet you dislike him like he’s one of our enemies. You use his body for your own needs but you don’t ask him what he wants, you slate his name like you know him for years but yet you know him through a piece of paper rather than talk to him like a person. What kind of leader are you to treat him like that” He roars.
“Sorry to interrupt, but I’m gladly to inform you that Agent Barton, Romanoff and Master Thor are on there way back from the hospital” Jarvis tells them and everyone sighs in relief.
Tony talked and talked about the events of last night. He told Tobias about everything even prior to last night, Thor, the training and lily. He and his son were both emotional at the end, they cried and hugged for a while after that.
So so sorry that this chapter took too long to complete but I hope you all like it and again sorry for any misspellings or bad grammar
Bruce was shock and terrified “how’s Natasha is she alright and what about Clint?” He quickly asks, “I have received a message from Master Thor and Agent Barton, he and Agent Romanoff are fine and are headed at the hospital and nothing of major concern” Jarvis informs everyone.
Hello everyone sorry I took so long to do a new chapter I just been on holiday so I’ve been rather slow on writing this up.
Tony was slowly came too, he felt an ach all over his body. He wanted to move an stretch out his body to hopefully relief some of the aches, but as he was trying to do so he notice something was very wrong.
However, there are times were tony can be a little frustrating, he’s brash and too blunt to the point it comes across rude. He doesn’t listen to steve when he needs to and he puts everyone in danger. And he does disrespect somebody of the other team members, sure they are rude to him but tony goes for the jugular and damn right hurtful comments which aren’t necessary.
Now Steve tried not to get mad at Tony’s bluntness, he knows this is important to him and what the endgame is when his training is complete, so he nodded and walk next to Thor and waited.
“You call your ability a different name, well everyone around earth calls it differently it’s hard to determine what was the original, but you named it wolf sense, ulvfølelse. You know were im from wolves have a variety of different meanings like chaos or warrior depends what you read I guess” Thor informed him.
Tony was exhausted, all he wanted to do was go to his room and curl in his bed and pretend this was all a bad dream. But this wasn’t a dream, this was real and he has now told his past to the others, and he doesn’t know how to feel about that.
The night was peaceful tonight, the dark sky was clear and the stars were shining. This reminds him when He was younger, his mom would take him to a little cabin that his grandfather owned, its located in Canada in the middle of the woods it was very peaceful from what Tony remembered.
At this moment, Tony thought that maybe, just maybe this could somehow be the key to help him find his soul ‘yeah that may sound strange’ He thought but it just felt right. Once he finished getting change, he also grab the braces you know just in case and head out the door.
There was a long pause no one knows what to say about the situation, until Tobias spoke “what are you gonna do now dad, how are you gonna find him and put him away for good”. Tony looked at his son sadly, he knew Jarvis can help with that and Thor with his training and Bruce with the search like they before when it came to missions. But as angry as he is he would need the other three, they spy twins with there well spying and Steve, well I guess he would do anything to protect Peggy but Tony he’s not sure on that one.
Lily stepped closer to him like she didn’t want anyone else to hear her words “it’s Daniel, he somehow escape prison” she bluntly said. Tony whole body stop, what it-it can’t be how?, why didn’t no one tell him? This has to be a lie, “your lying” He sneer, grab her shoulders tightly and yelled “YOUR LYING” He panic. Lily was crying again “I’m telling you the truth, he came to me a few days ago, trying to convince me to join his side again I told him no and he threatened to kill me if I didn’t. He said he killed the other men who raped you that night too as they didn’t join his cause, but I manage to get away from him as my husband was near by and we were in a public place before he could do anything to me” she cried in pain as Tony squeeze her shoulders even tighter.
Steve shouldn’t be surprise about Starks bluntness but he was, does he want to go to his room, does he want to be fuck buddies he wasn’t sure.
“And why should I? Why should let you stay in this team and possibly hurt Tony again, you three seem to like hurting him so why should give you another chance” he questions them all.
This gala is not only to help SI but to help PR with the avengers too, so tonight had to be perfect no fuck ups.
Steve didn’t want to leave, he wanted answers, why is Fury and Peggy here? Who is this kid? And why did he say he was Tony’s son? How is that possible, Tony is too young to have this kid at his age right?
Before he knew his mom wrap her arms around him, gently rubbing small circles on his back. They were like that what seem like hours, but once tony had calm down he pulled away from his mom and gave a sad smile.
Bruce turned to Tony to apologise, but Tony put his hand up as a sign to stop him. “ Don’t worry about it Brucie bear I know you didn’t mean it” he smiled and Bruce couldn’t help but smile back, Tony was always so nice to him. Now he even feels more guilty, “Don’t feel guilty Bruce I’m still your science bro aren’t I” Bruce look straight up at Tony how did he know what he was feeling, “hehe silly Banner” Hulk chimes in ‘huh’ what was that suppose to mean.
Thor frowns at Steve’s words, “ why do you want to speak about Anthony, is he alright?” He said with worry. Steve shook his head, “ no stark is fine I think I haven’t spoken to him for a while. Look thor I’m going to be direct with you and stark seem to be rather close all of the sudden, are you two by any chance imitate with one an other?”.
“Please stop I didn’t do anything... Daniel please” Tony pleads. But Daniel doesn’t stop, he can see him now and both of them are naked.
Hope you all liked it and what do you want to see in any future chapter I like to hear your thoughts
Natasha smirk at Steve’s nervousness, “come on Steve, you really think me and Clint didn’t notice that you and Stark have been engaging in what I’ll call hate sex”.
Tony let him go and looks at him at his green and brown eyes, “Bambi your leaving and coming home with me to the avenger tower” he said to his son which shock, “wait what? why dad, why the tower won’t your team be wondering why I’m there?” He ask with concern.
A few minutes later good old cap strolls in the penthouse, “STARK” Rogers roared, “where the hell have you been, you just flew off and didn’t show up for the debriefing, and you haven’t answer any of our calls what hell do you think you are doing uh are you that board of the mission that you fuck off. Well answer me let me hear one of your excuses Stark” he ranted.
“That’s not fair, don’t you dare bring up my mistakes like that. I was ...” Tony cried but couldn’t finish his sentence as yet again Steve spoke up and it just got worse.
Tony gave her a sad look “I’m.... not doing great mom” he said with honesty. Peggy look sad back and tony could see in her eyes that she knew what it is today.
Tony turned his head to look at Rogers and simply said, “ I don’t have to defend myself for anything but if you want to join me well please do” he said in a sultry voice if this work than Rogers will jump him and give a good night and hopefully that would help him forget for a little while.
But that was then, and he tried not to be angry so much, he tried to see her regularly, but with SHEILD, avengers and bucky it’s hard to keep up sometimes.
Speaking of the people, he should really listen to what they are saying. Quickly he got out of his thoughts and look at the trio in front of him.
They talked for an hour or so until tony realise he had to go back to the tower otherwise the team might actually kill him.
Tony sighed in frustration he didn’t want the others to know this part yet but you know what they say begged can’t be choosers “Thor please don’t hurt Steve, despite what he has said we need him but I do appreciate your some what overprotectiveness of me” Tony smile and throw the hammer back to Thor like it was nothing.
Tony can feel himself going into place that he always goes, it always starts out... pleasant you could say. It starts out bright and warm, trees all around him and healthy green colour on the grass. He would see the river,  clear blue and the fish’s swimming without the care in the world, it was a beautiful scenery.
“Where is everyone?” He ask Bruce as he starts rip out the IV and remove himself from the medical bed. Bruce was in a panic, Steve shouldn’t even leave the medic, “Well Fury is gathering everyone for a meeting about the situation, but Steve you shouldn’t...” Bruce wanted to continue but Steve interrupted him. “Good, show me where they are” he quickly said he manages to find spare appropriate clothes and heads out the room, Bruce rushes behind “Steve, your injured you shouldn’t put to much strain on your body” he informs Steve with concern. But Steve continues to walk ahead “I’m fine Bruce, I heal much quickly than an average human” he tells Bruce, this leaves Bruce with a tired sigh he knows he can’t get through to Steve he’s too stubborn to see reason.
“Right so this former agent could be a double agent as well” Natasha spoke aloud. But Thor has a grim look on his “That’s not possible Natasha” “uh what? why is that?” She spoke with confusion. “The Agent has been dead for 2 months” he tells them and they were both in shock.
Throughout the rest of the night, Tony trained with the help of Thor. Thor taught him how to fight like a warrior and took him to the forest of rebirth to help locate his inner soul.
Also side note I don’t know much about the American education system so I tried to be simplistic as possible.
“Look pep, things have been crazy for the last few hours and I’ve been busy” he said in his defence.
The team was shock that Fury would say that to them, “What? Sir why would you think that” Steve asked in a slight panic. “ Because of what I saw out there! I told you all to see Tony in a different light and not judge him as how the world sees him, but yet you failed and now I am pissed” he sneered.
Once Tony got into his lab( well more like an office really, it’s just a desk with some tools and materials around the place). “hey J put up the schematic would you please” “of course sir” Jarvis responded, the schematic was similar to the blade that his mom gave him on his birthday it was nearly. He had hope to incorporated into his suit but he hasn’t got enough time so instead he had to do plan B there was no time to waste and went to work.
Tony just burst out laughing, which confused Thor, “are you insane me and Rogers aren’t romantic, we have this thing which helps us relieve stress. Anyways how did you know ?”.
A slut even. Since I gave you some pleasure now it’s my turn” Rogers thrust  into tony as soon a finished his sentence.
The team were brimming with energy, eager to fight. It’s been 12 hours since they had their meeting, Jarvis still hadn’t found anything yet but the team are still in high hopes that they find there genius soon.
Tobias stares at him as he was walking away, “Hey Rogers” he shouts to him and Steve turns to face him. “You better bring my dad back” he said firmly and Steve straightens himself up “I promise, I won’t fail again you have my word” he promises and then he leaves in the elevator.
Sorry it took so long been very busy at work and stuff but I finally finish this chapter so I hope you like it
Sorry it took awhile been rather busy with life and had a little bit of an writers block but finally finished this chapter woohoo
“I’m gonna kill Steve” his mom whispers harshly, Tony sighs at her statement “no your not mom, despite what recently has happened, you wouldn’t kill him” after all Tony can tell by her aura alone that she still cares for him. Peggy gave a dark chuckle as she knew Tony used his abilities on her, like mother like son “curse your abilities, but I still will kick him in the balls for what he’s done” she replied and Tony gave a wet chuckle “and that I can believe”.
Tobias gently touch his dads arm, “Are you ok?” He asked. Tony couldn’t speak for a moment he just stared at his son knowing that his Bambi listen to everything Steve has said, and that broke his heart. “Am I ok, the real question is why are you down here Toby?” Tony said, Tobias look down for a moment like he been caught stealing a cookie from the cookie jar. “I was worried. You were taking too long so I ask Jarvis what you were doing, and Jarvis said that you were in a heated exchange with him” Tobias turned his head to look at Steve in anger.
Silence filled the room, it was awkward at best. Tony feeling all eyes on him but he should say one more thing “As for your question about these two (Tony pointing at his son and Davis) the old guy, his name is John Davis he was the detective who took my case and throughout the years he’s been training me to defend myself and he’s like a father figure to me” he said whilst Davis looked at him like a father would be of his son caring and proud.
I’m back sorry it so long to write this but I finally had the time to finish this chapter and hopefully from now on I’ll get my next chapter done much more quickly 😅
Steve wasn’t sure what to think, Fury never spoken about Stark with this much passion. So maybe Fury is on to something and Steve will need to see it too.
But anyways Rogers was speaking and tony didn’t really listen was thinking about last night, but he listen to the last part of what Rogers was saying “.....you should try and be like us that might actually help you and it might even benefit the team dynamic if you try and be as healthy like the rest of us Stark”.
Tony cringe from the touch and from Daniels words, he needed to get out. He hope that the Avengers will come to rescue him soon, but right now he needs to find away to escape on his own until the team comes. “Why are you doing this and where the hell am I?” Tony ask hoping that Daniel is stupid enough to give him a clue on where he is.
Steve can hear a beeping sound from that he concluded it must be the monitor, he can fell pain all over his body. He’s trying to remember why he would be in this much pain, he thought back the last thing he remembered. And then it hit him the explosion, Hydra and Tony oh god Tony, where is he, Tony Tony Tony. Steve opens eyes and gasp for air in a panic he frantically looking for Tony, “Steve it’s alright you need to calm down, it’s alright” a familiar voice spoke.
Tony chuckled at his AI, he sighed and looked at the mirror one more time “Well time to rock and roll” he said to himself, he then proceeded to leave his penthouse.
“Should we go after those sir” an agent ask, “no leave them let’s stick to the mission” Daniel said.
Stark rolled his eyes again and said “ look spangles, your not wrong ever since that night things became calmer between us, so if you want to fuck my ass again you can meet me in my room. You know we’re that is don’t you cap” Stark finished his drink, then got up from his seat and left the kitchen.
“I love you too dad” Tony said in a whisper and as Howard physical form started to vanish Tony could hear his dad saying “goodbye Anthony” then everything went white.
Well here is goes “you see when I was 13 years old it was my birthday and me and Howard had a fight and I stormed out to cool down. But then I heard a woman scream and I saw these people attack her and I wanted to help her so I stop the attackers by throwing a trash lid at them” Tony took a deep breath this was hard and he can see the others looking concern.
Then after a few minutes of silence torture Steve finally spoke up “ I’ve been having nightmares again, about the war, about bucky. It’s been going on for the last couple of weeks” oh god what is he getting out he thought to himself but he continues. “But after we had sex the nightmares stop and I wasn’t so stress anymore and tell me if I’m wrong but we didn’t had a single shouting match for about a week”
She recognised him and they chatted for a while, they laugh and cry about the good old days and it was good. At least he had one connection from his past, besides bucky who is still out there lost in this new world. But then as he was about to leave her mind went blank and she wasn’t Peggy anymore, which broke him more than anything.
Tony was surprise by the last one, he knew Davis from when he was 13, he was the detective on the case and had help the traumatised boy greatly. Then Davis was in and out of there lives, he and his mom knew each other from before. After all Peggy also trained Davis with his abilities like she did with Tony.
He stretch out his hand ready to touch his light, to touch his soul. But! The darkness crept back and lighting struck his head, he lost the light, he was falling no not again.
But lucky for them, this killer was sloppy, they were clearly in a rush to get this done before someone sees them Natasha concluded. She spotted a hair just by the passenger side of the car and not only that she spotted a lighter outside the burned car. “found something” Natasha shouts and Clint and a young agent came over. “Bag this, and send this to Doctor Banner” she told the female agent, she nods and proceeds to gather the evidence.
Once he got to Starks floor, he walk toward the bedroom. He knock on the door, “you can come in you know” Stark spoke through the door. God stark can so obnoxious Steve thought, he considered not going in. But then again.
Bruce also appropriates that tony isn’t afraid of the other guy, he loves the other guy, Bruce doesn’t really know why but he will leave it alone for now.
Their mouths crash together like waves hitting rocks, it was passionate and yet sloppy. Tony never felt anything like this with anyone before and god it was getting hard to the point it was painful.
Steve was nervous as walk out of the elevator, he can see the others by the couches. Tony looked nervous as well and scared it worried Steve and wondered if that’s because he’s here. He didn’t want Tony to be uncomfortable in his own home because of him, he felt guilty of what happen and hope that he can fix this.
All of the sudden the rescue suits came out of the walls and encase themselves around Tobias and Peggy “What the hell” Tobias shouts. Steve was in a panic what the fuck is going on “JARVIS!!” He cries but no response this was getting bad, “TONY” Steve shouts and Tony rushes out of his lab and saw the suits covering his love ones ‘No’ “what the fuck is happening” “we don’t know Jarvis isn’t responding” Bruce said with worry on his voice. No no no this isn’t happening why wasn’t there any signs, Tony turns to his family “go and tell Fury what is happening” he tells them in a panic. “No but dad” his cries but it’s too late to argue the suits lift in the air and smash through the window and escape.
Then there was Thor who said that he will be waiting in his room for Tony to arrive and start their training.
“This has been great Peggy I’m glad that your son is doing well, but I really need to finish these files. We can do this another time” Fury said politely. Peggy had a look of disappointment but she nodded to ready to leave.
“Sorry mom I wanted to be a happy visit” he joke. Peggy smiled at her son “it’s alright darling, it’s ok to be sad and let go of your feeling steve does it from time to time” she said gently.
“What? How is that even possible, then who recommend her then” Clint ask a bunch of questions. “According to Hill, they forge his signature and possibly used a computer recording device to mimic his voice and as no one for him they didn’t think it would be a problem hiring her” “идиот” Natasha spoke in Russian “how could they missed that?” “I don’t know” Thor just said. “Well come in then let’s go back to the tower” Clint spoke up and they all agreed and left the hospital.
So Steve close the door as a sign of his agreement. As he walk to the bed he thought to himself ‘this is good, this will help them, it’s going to be fine. Isn’t it?’.
Tony smirk and challenge “ well why don’t you show me Rogers or are you too.... wha hey!” Before he could finish Rogers in one swift motion lift up tony and tore his very expensive pants off until he was bare. And before tony could complain two fingers were shoved into his mouth. “Suck” Rogers demanded and so tony did, he doesn’t want Rogers to fuck him dry.
Fury sighed “what is it Tony?” He ask from what he heard Tony sounded scared he usually never sounded like that unless it’s something actually serious.
There was an awkward silence between them, but it was Steve who crack first. “Listen, Tony I think we’ve been misunderstanding each other and I just to try I mean really try, this is what I want to talk to you about for tomorrow. Hell l always wanted to talk you you about this but I keep getting side track by...” your dick up my ass” Tony interrupted with a grin on his face trying to get a rise at off Rogers.
“ Steven I would never touch Anthony that way, he is yours, like you are his I will never get between that bond” Thor defends
“Anthony, I can promise you that I won’t allow that and I doubt they will kick you off the team for having abilities, if they did wouldn’t they kick me and Bruce off too and wouldn’t steve be kick off as well for having enhance abilities too” Thor said.
Pepper nodded “Good, so Tony there is a General Marcus and Major Peters will like to speak to you about your new defence gear for the soldiers. There is also some important company’s who like to talk about any future business deals with you as well”. Tony nodded and listen to what Pepper had to say, he hated dealing with these kinds of people as they expected so much of him in so little time and the way they use him to get there own way make him on edge at times. But at the same time it’s for a good reason and to protect and save lives is all that matters to him so he’ll interact with these people for that only.
And for people who don’t know who Bambi is it’s Tony’s son that just a nickname that tony loves to call him by
Steve was confused to say the least when he left Fury’s office, but one things for sure he needed to fix what ever mess he did. He needed to see Stark in a new light and see what Fury and Thor see in him.
Shacking off that memory, Tony gets out of his car and walks towards the house. He rings the door bell and waits for a minute, ten door open and he smiles “long time no see old man” Tony teased.
Steve could only shake his head, before he decided the best thing to do was leave before things got really out of hand. He slowly walks out of Thor’s floor without saying a word to him, he continues walking in a daze until he reaches the common room, where Natasha and  Clint are sitting on the couch watching some garbage TV.
Fury sighed again “No I’m not there’s a fucking mess and I need to fix, you know what to do other agent Hill” he asked her and in turn she shook her head. “Yes sir I’ll get it done” she replied, “Good, get to it we need to this as soon as possible we already wasted enough time already” he said with frustration. “Of course Sir” Maria said and then quickly left the room leaving again Fury to his thoughts, he prayed that he could fix this before it was too late god help him.
He hasn’t seen her for nearly two decades, she looked different then the first time he encountered her. He looked older some winkles peaking out, she shorten her hair and from what Tony could tell she looked tired.
“J, can you be so kind to tell me why my beautiful music has all of the sudden stop it’s  kind of ruining my flow you know” he teased.
But reality decided to come to him first, as his dad knock on the door and went in to his son room. His dad sat on the bed and cried and told him how sorry he was for telling him about his birth like that. Though Tobias wanted to be left alone and tell his dad to go away, however Tobias can see the pain in his dads eyes and no matter what had been said he wanted to know everything about what happen to his dad and he wanted to be there for him too.
Yay back again with a new chapter hope you like it though it’s a bit shorter than my other chapters.
Fury just rolled his good eye, “fine let them in but this better be quick” he snapped, “Yes sir” Hill replies.
Hello again back with a new chapter, so this one has a consensual sex scene though it rough, hate sex but tony consented. Also side note I’m not great with writing sex scenes so hopefully it’s not too bad.
Steve open the door and looked in and what a sight it was. Stark was spears out on the bed completely naked, he was also half hard and he was fingering himself and god that made Steve’s dick twitch at the sight.
Thor and Steve were starting to get anxious at how Tony was taking so long in his meditation state. “Does this always take this long?” Steve asks, this gives him a death glare from Thor “sometimes but Im going to take this as a good sign that he’s gone pass his pervious barriers” he said bluntly. Now Steve was nervous he knows that Thor might actually kill since that while incident, he wasn’t to calm the tension between them “Look Thor I just want to say that I’m...” “Steven now it’s not the time so please just be quiet” Thor growls, Steve immediately shuts up and waits.
Tony continues “Tobias’s mother was the woman who died last night but I swear it wasn’t me, it must have been Daniel, she did warn me that he had escape from prison and killed the other men who attacked me that night too. I don’t know what his plan is but I’m sure hell going to find out and I know we haven’t been on the best of terms I need your guys help so will you help me” he finishes in a quite voice thinking that they will not help him and he’ll have to do this on his own, well not really but these are the best guys that SHEILD got.
“Well yes Mr Stark, there have been a few people that visit her. Ms carters grandson Tobias, Mr Rhode, of course Mr Rogers seen her a couple of days ago and another visit by a named Mr Davis” she answered back.
“Alright big guy, when do we start?” Tony said. Thor had a big grin and his face “ right now, but first tell me who trained you and what have you learned” Thor ask. Tony hesitated at first, he wasn’t sure if he should tell the truth about his real mom, but Thor was the only one who showed him kindness, the one who listen to him the most. So tony decided to tell him everything, his birth mom, when his abilities develop, when his training started and who trained him.
So yeah Davis was one of them and even help tony train when his mom couldn’t and also help train his son too, he was grateful and Davis was apart of there family circle. But recently he hasn’t been in contact for several months, but now he resurfaced tony might need to make a little visit himself.
They made it back to Tony’s lab, and Steve took Tony to the couch. “Right so did you want to rest here or back in your penthouse?” Steve ask. But before Tony could answer JARVIS spoke “Sir glad you have arrived back, we have an emergency” Tony and the others were alert at this point “what happened J?” Tony ask.
Thor looked at Tony and agreed they been doing this for hours, Tony deserves a break. Thor grab his hammer, then a quick of a flash they were back in Tony’s penthouse like they were hours ago.
“FAIR! you want to talk about fair Stark. You know nothing about what’s fair you were raise with everything you ever ask for, you never knew about hardship or suffering” Steve rage. But then he said something that would change the situation dramatically.
Tony looked at the wooden box, it looked old but yet beautiful it had these patterns of swirls and a symbols that made it look majestic. He opens the box and inside he was surprise, there were three items inside, the first one was an old photo maybe from the 1920s or 30s it was a man and a little girl could that be his grandfather and his mom he wondered.
“Avengers would you follow me I think we should have a little talk as well” Fury spoke and he didn’t sound too happy about it. He walked out the room and ‘encourage’ the others to follow Nat did without question and drag Clint along with her. Steve was a bit hesitant at first but followed anyways and think what had he done?
But he had to control himself for bit so he can say some rules to stark. “If we does this, we keep it between ourselves and not tell the team I want them to think we became civil through talking and not from you spread like a prostitute. And when we fuck, we do it on my terms for it” he grunted.
So here he is now nursing his drinking, god tony so tired he just wanted to forget today but he knows he can’t not with his eidetic memory.
After the birthday incident thing became tense around the tower, Tony felt alone. But it seems he’s not quite alone as he thought.
Thor knows what Anthony is, what his bloodline is. It was his mother after all who bless certain individuals to become there better selves to protect humanity from others who wish to control the world and its people.
Tobias was sitting on the couch with his laptop on his lap writing out his thesis for his second degree in in criminal law.
Steve wanted to protest but then he saw Tony who jump in front of his mom “Steve please just go” He rasp  like he was going to cry. Steve never seen that from Tony before, did he really go too far?
He grabs the neckless and places it around his neck. He looks at himself in the full body mirror which is next to his walk-in closet. He walks closer to the mirror for an closer inspection, the stone looked beautiful, it still look like it was moving. Waves of different colours swirling around, like it wanted to be release.
Peggy looked at Steve for a moment, she was angry at him for he had been doing and it will be a struggle to forgive him for a while. But she can tell he’s been struggling and has obviously hasn’t received the right help, “Well first off you need to seek out professional help, then you need to work your way back to the leader you use to be and then maybe you’ll be able to apologise to Tony the right way and who knows you could start over with him” she said firmly but also with kindness in her voice.
“I’m sorry sir, but Mr Thor would like to speak with you, he said it’s important” Jarvis replied. Tony was curious as to why Thor wanted to talk, but he always has time for him so... “let warrior bro in J” he said.
Tony realise he’s ignoring the fact that Steve is coming at him which some what scared him. “Um hey Steve, I’m just here to gather some food. Can the yelling wait until I eat” he tried to said sarcastically.
“Tony” Steve spoke softly, he felt of guilty about all of this, Tony’s Past was traumatic but yet extraordinary he wants to make this right to help Tony and his family that the best he. “Yes Steve” Tony said shyly, At that point Steve stands up “I am so sorry Tony, but I promise I will help you to bring down this bastard” he growls and shocks Tony. “Yeah man me and Nat can gather info about this guy whereabouts” Clint adds and Natasha nods in agreement.
“Right so the kid he’s my son, and as you can imagine I was young to have had him” he started, Steve gave a frown at the behaviour that Tony was giving out something was wrong here “how old where you Tony?” He said in a rather kindly voice.
Steve paled, he thought he was subtle maybe not stark, as he limp a bit when he walks into the kitchen, ok so that was his fault but still he made sure that he wasn’t found out.
The right side of the bed was cold, Rogers left hours ago with out saying anything and now tony feels numb. He’s feels lonely and he wanted someone to be here with him to comfort him that’s all he asks for but life can be a bitch to him so he doubts anything good will happen today. Tony thought about what design he was going to do once he is in his lab.
And turns out he does pay for it, the super secret boy band, band together and fight like a team and they won, it was quite spectacular actually, Tony confronts Loki like a bad ass and almost gets mind controlled but doesn’t some how again tony needs to figure that out.
Clint quickly followed “Wait Nat shouldn’t we wait for cap?” He asked her. But she didn’t stop and kept on going “No we don’t, beside I don’t think Steve came here for the same reason we were, come on let’s go” she said. Clint wanted to wait for Cap, but Natasha was right in a way he did notice that Cap was quiet whilst they were in there, so he’s definitely came here for a different reason. Without continuing to ponder Clint rush up to Natasha and he hope that Steve gets the answer that he wanted.
Steve looked at Fury straight in the eyes and said “Why did you really except Stark into the avengers, tell me the truth sir?” He demanded.
Once Thor left it was only Steve and Tony, “Right I think we should go to my penthouse maybe we should get Bruce to come up as well, you know safety in numbers and all” Tony suggests.
John smiled at Tony with fondness and walk straight toward the couch and placed the two cups of coffee he had in his hands down on to the table. He sat down next to Tony then spoke “Why are you here Tony I haven’t seen you for a long time? Don’t get me wrong I loved it when you visit me but I see that something’s troubling you” He ask gently.
Tony can only describe John as a good man, brave, wise and kind to him. John is now a retired cop, he’s was one of the best cops ever in New York City, he solved hundreds of cases with great results. He never backs down from a case even when others try to take him down.
Steve was nervous as he knew that Fury was aware of the relationship that him and Tony have and worried he might actually get murdered by the director himself. “You said you try last time, are you sure you gonna help Tony this time around” Fury asked, “Yes Sir I will, I swear to you and to Tony” Steve answers.
Peggy gave her grandson a sympathetic look and place a hand on his knee, “I know what you mean darling and trust me if Steve ever hurts him again he’s got me to answer to. But I believe Steve is himself also hurting and he needs help”
He told JARVIS to go faster, which his AI comply. He was closer to his sons destination and he hope that his son was safe and I’d anything ever happens to him he wouldn’t know what he would do. “Bambi please be safe” he whispered o himself.
Thor gave him a small smile “ I’ve known who you are since the battle of New York, I thought at first you didn’t tell us, because you didn’t know us, but we’ve been a team for a while now and with your abilities we can become stronger but yet you don’t tell us still why?” He ask kindly.
Rogers looked kind of shy, look awkward and didn’t know where to look. “Um.. sorry I didn’t mean to scare you I just wanted to check up on you to see if your ok” he said shyly. This surprise Tony as Rogers never really cared for him until now, why now what’s change.
There was silence between them for a long moment, Tony was in a daze, he hadn’t had sex like that before and he had lots of sex. But this was different, it wasn’t love or friends with benefits kind of thing. No it was pure hate mix with lust and fuck was it lust.
He needed to try, maybe they were right and Stark was this great guy but so far he hasn’t seen that. Maybe because Stark hasn’t given him the opportunity to see that or maybe because Steve himself has been struggling with his own demons and hasn’t been really seeing and positives about Stark. But god damn it he’ll try to speak to Stark and maybe they can get closer into becoming something civil, god help him.
Steve was disappointed he was hoping they could find a possible hideout from the old case but so far no luck. “Thanks for informing us” Steve said to Davis and Fury, “we will continue to look and well inform you once we find anything useful” Fury tells them. “Your doing your best, don’t lose hope” Peggy comforts them “we won’t Fury out” The Director said and hangs up. “Well that was a waste of time” Tobias said miserably, “oh come on now darling that wasn’t a waste of time this could help use narrow down our lead” Peggy tries to stay hopeful “maybe” Tobias just said “I wonder how dads doing” he wants to know.
What do you think, are the avengers going to see the error of there ways and what will thor do once he finds out ?
Not only that stark disobey Steve’s orders again from there last mission and they had a very heated argument in front of the team.
With a sigh he turn to his son, “in just gonna go down and get the sausages Bambi. Don’t worry I won’t take long and if I do you can rescue me” he joke at the end. Tobias gave his dad a sad smile “sure dad I’ll always come and rescue you” he said.
“I should have chased you, hell I should have listen to you in the first place and never took you to that fucking club. You should of stayed home were I could kept you safe and happy but in stead of being an egotistical jerk that I was.. I’m just so sorry Anthony” this was when Howard started to cry and Tony never saw him cry not even once. Was this even real? Was this all in his head? Tony couldn’t tell.
After the incident with Stark his nightmares didn’t surface and he felt more relax, hell him and stark became quite civil towards each other. But recently things became stressful again, there was a difficult mission and two agents died and Steve couldn’t help but blame himself.
Tony looked at in surprise of course he knew Rogers visit his mom but he thought it was to talk about the good old days or maybe even bitch about him but his mom never mentions it. “Really he’s the same, never thought spangles get so emotional” he snark, Peggy gave him a sad look “he struggles from time to time because of the changes he has to go through. And tony please be kind to him I’m very aware that you too log heads but your more alike than you think so please try for me” she plead.
But Clint was the one who spoke first “ um Steve buddy you gotta give us some more details than that” he said with Natasha nodding in agreement.
“ why yes sir, it seems Master Thor has been up for the last hour should I notify him that you want to see him?” Jarvis replied
He does some little experiment to see how good Bruces tolerance is, he pokes and jabs. Even though it seems harmless it does aggravate him too.
Steve sighed and look down staring at his hands “I know, your grandmother told me the same thing. I promise you that I will seek help I’ve been avoiding it for some time and it’s causing people pain and I hope you know that I’ll do anything to gain Tony’s trust back and I’ll never again hurt him like I’ve been doing you have my word Tobias.” Steve said with emotion in his eyes. Tobias looked at him for a bit, he used his abilities to see if what Rogers was saying was the truth and what he say brought a ever small smile to his face it seems that the Captain was being genuine  and that gave Tobias relief. “Thank you for being honest but this doesn’t mean i forgive you yet” he said as he stood up, Steve stood up alone side him “I know” he simply said with a smile of hope.
Tony froze for a moment, What! that can’t be true there’s no way that can be true. Did Daniel have something to do with it, do the avengers think I killed them surly not. “What do you mean dead?” he rasp.
Steve felt that annoyance again every time Stark speaks to him like that, like he’s dumb. With a snare “that was not what I meant Stark, I mean what are you in here at this time. It’s 2:30 in the morning, why aren’t you asleep you look like you need it stark or have been binging in the lab again”
The last item in the box was a neckless a long silver chain that look old but yet strong. Attach to it was a stone, looked odd the colours seemed endless and they look like they were moving almost Tony couldn’t describe it but it was certainly beautiful. He pick it put close to his face and just stared at it,  something felt different with this neckless Tony felt a pull from it like it was special somehow but he couldn’t quite put his finger on it.
He sighed he doesn’t need them he has Thor and maybe Bruce they are science bros after all. “I think about it Bambi” he smiled to his son and Tobias in turn smiled back.
“Back in 97 I got word that there might be a double agent in SHEILD me and your mother feared it was Hydra and it was most likely that they were after me and what I had. I didn’t have enough time to expose who they were, I needed that time to make sure that you had the company I had a feeling that Stane was working for them but before I could do anything well you know what happened” he said with sorrow
“The time is 8:30pm Sir the rest of the avengers are ready and waiting down stair should I notify them that your ready sir? JARVIS ask
“You know Peggy once told me that this neckless was special and had some magic to it” John said pulling Tony out of his trance from the neckless. Tony snorted “seriously magic come on do you really believe that?” He ask. But John just shrugged “you never know” he smiled. Tony felt a vibration from his watch and looked at it “shit” he exclaimed it was 5:30pm he needed to go back to home to get ready for the gala.
Fury’s eyes widen in shock, he stood up quickly and speed walk towards Peggy, “What! Since when I didn’t agree to this, Peggy answer me” he shouts. But Peggy just chuckle as she continue to walk, “I trust you Nicky I know you do right by him if I’m not around, anyways I must go bye Nicky” she tease.
Natasha was looking around the burned car, to what the two spies were told, the Marks were killed before the car was burned, so someone wanted to burn any evidence.
Tobias just chuckles “I’m well aware of your independence grandma, but you always say to me that sometimes you need to swallow your pride and expect when someone kind is offering you help” he teases and Peggy just chuckled at that.
Pain, pain so much pain going through Tony’s body . The cold air send shivers down Tony’s spine as ran and his blood was everywhere.
But life didn’t seem to be on Tony’s side, as he was about to use his new tool the door opens and Daniel with his henchmen came through the door ‘shit’ Tony thought.
It was then Peggy spoke up, “Steve, now it’s not the time. I think we all need a break from this and if Anthony wants to talk about it then that’s for him to decide” she said firmly not leaving room for any arguments. The she continues “But now I would like a moment with Anthony of you please leave us for a moment” she spoke firmly.
Tony just sighed and got up from the couch and started to walk towards his bedroom, and Rogers was surprise by his action.
Steve was shock at Thor’s anger, why would thor defend Stark like that. Did Thor really think that about him. “ Thor listen, you got to understand that Stark is disobedient selfish man, you got to see that. Tell me one thing that tony has done that you think he deserves respect?” He challenged.
Tony give a small chuckle “that I did Thor so now o can kick Daniels ass” he spoke. As he got up he slightly lost his footing and felt dizzy, he was about to fall face first on the grass until Steve caught him just in time. “Woah easy now, are you alright?” Steve questions with worry. “ My hero” Tony jokes and Steve huffs with laughter “you can thank me later okay but right now you need rest” Steve gently spoke. Tony wanted protest he needed to see what his new abilities could do but Thor jumps in first to speak “ The Captain is right Anthony we should head back to the tower and you rest for a bit, and once you’ve rested we shall continue your training as quickly as possible” Thor said and Tony sigh in defeat “ okay fine” he just said.
Sure they use to date, but Tony knows it was too much for her to handle with him being iron man and she thought if he broke up with him maybe just being back to friends would be easier to handle. He wished things have gone better between them, but they are still friends just not as close as they use to be and Tony knows it’s his fault maybe he should be the one to reach out first.
Clint looked at his friend in confusion “what Nat?” He simply said. But Natasha didn’t answer, no instead she walked in a fast pace. “Hey what are you doing” she yelled, that’s when Clint notice the young agent who was supposed to bag the evidence. But instead Clint saw that she was destroying it, at this point Clint ran towards the car.
Steve sighed and got out of bed and went to the kitchen in the common room to get hot chocolate according to Peggy it helps with sleep so he might as well give it a try.
“How the fuck did you.. ahh” Tony hissed in pain from the slap that Daniel gave him. Tony wanted to shout at him, swear and insult him for the monster that he is but Daniel wrap his hand around Tony’s throat and squeezes it tight. “Don’t you dare speak to me like that pet, you’re meant to be a good boy but instead you’re being a bad boy and bad boys get punish. Now I’m only doing a light punishment but next time I won’t be so kind, nod if you understand?” He growls and Tony with wide scared eyes nods.
“Well what can I say spangles you caught by surprised, and here I was thinking your some sweet innocent old virgin” tony snark
Tony shook his head “I don’t care what they think, you might be endanger Bambi, I need you there as I know my tower is safest place for you right now” he said with tears threatening to come out his eyes.
But the real question is why now? Why did she suddenly appear here of all places and what does she want. “How, w-what are you doing here?” he sneered at her with a shaky voice.
“ I told you all if you hurt him I’ll throw you of this team and by what I saw I should make that call” he spoke, Steve was devastated he didn’t mean for this to happen, “ Sir no please give us a chance to make this right” he spoke, the other two agreed as well but Fury was not convince.
Tony just lays there stunned, he didn’t know what to do, what experiments did Daniel mean? And how did they know about his abilities, Tony has many questions. But for right now he needs to find away to escape and he hopes that the others will find him soon before things gets worse for him.
Tony hug his son back, they embrace for a moment until Tony pulls away, “thank you Bambi I needed that” he said to his son which made Tobias smile. “No problem dad. So what are you going to do now?” He asked.
He sucked the fingers like he would suck a cock, he wants to show Rogers what he’s like in bed after all lots of people have praise him of how good he is in the sheets department. He looked at Rogers wit a sultry look, he can tell that Rogers is turned on, he knows that Rogers wants him like all those men before him so this was noting new to him. It doesn’t make him feel worthless or use, no he just fine with that.
First was that fact he was dying from his own reactor, palladium poisoning Ha! What a joke. He was starting to get out of control again, he had that disaster of a birthday party, he drank more, doing a hell of a lot of inventing binges and started to push everyone away even his own son, he didn’t want his Bambi to see him like that, he wanted to protect him even from himself.
“Have you two notice that Thor keeps going down to Starks lab for the last serval days?” Steve ask the two spy’s.
Tony was tired and it was nearing the end of the event, so Tony decided that he deserved a little break from. So he excuse himself from the crowd and walk outside to the balcony.
The general grunted “you better make sure you do not fail, remember our deal Captain” he spoke once more and then walked away.
The next chapter will be more interesting there gonna be a surprise for Tony hehe (it’s not a good surprise)
“Well glad that was over with” Natasha said as she proceeds to gather her things, Clint nodded in agreement, it was scary for second when the explosion went off but he was glad they both didn’t get seriously hurt “ready to go?” He ask Natasha “Yes” was her answer.
Tony looks at Thor for a bit, gets it that Thor is just trying to help, but what if he’s wrong and he can’t do this. Yeah Thor did say it will take weeks or perhaps years, but still Tony’s a genius he should be able to do this.
Once they were at the base, they manage to get rid of the hydra bastards and rescue the civilians in record time. But tony, the ever curious cat went snooping through hydras data base, and what he found terrified him.
Clint notice Steve straight away and looked surprised. “You alright there steve, you look pale like a ghost or something” He asked. It was then that Natasha looked up as well with an eyebrow raised, “ Yeah Steve are you ok, did stark give you a rough time again” she teased.
Then there was the team, you could say that all of them were surprised by the revaluation. It was Steve who spoke up out of all of them, “Tony, is this true?” He said with some hesitation in his voice.
He doesn’t know what real pain is or how to appreciate what he has, like Clint and the other do. When Clint was growing up he was poor and treated with such violence by his circus family and his own brother, Hell that was how he lost one side of his hearing from the beatings they gave him.
Once Tony arrive at his penthouse, he thought about going into the kitchen first to make his son a good old fashion English breakfast that his mom use to make for him, he though it’ll be a good way to start the morning before he had the talk with his son.
Steve was bewildered, when he was coming here he thought he would simply talk to thor peacefully, he didn’t expect Thor to defend stark.
Steve was shock at tony he didn’t expect to be nice to him, maybe this was his change to get to know the man without all the tense and shouting.
All three stood close together, “here we go” Thor announces as he lifts up his hammer and before Steve’s eyes a white bright light engulfs around him.
Peggy smiled gently “please Nick its Peggy we’re friends aren’t we not. Anyways I’m not here to work don’t worry you can relax” she teased and fury just snorted.
Howard gives a small smile “mostly, I was very much aware in that neckless so for the most part I saw what you got up to in your later years Peggy kept me up to date when she was aware of her self, there was another man who showed me things as well though I can’t remember his name. But what I want to say is I’m very proud of you Anthony you’ve become the man I always hoped you’ll be, you change the company for the better, you became a superhero which I was amazed by you are really something special son” Howard praises. Tony didn’t know what to say, but before he could Howard continues.
Tony had to think about this for a second, thors warning scared him, but Thor believe he will be able to master it, he had to do this right he had to take it seriously like when he trained with his mom and Davis.
Oh for fuck sakes. He repeats “Oh for fuck sake Rogers how do you always know and why do to always have to get up so early?” Tony snap back
Bruce got a message from Jarvis to got to Tony’s penthouse and this concerned him, he was still waiting for the evidence to arrive, but yet he hasn’t heard from SHEILD which made him worried. But as for right now, he went out of his lab a and headed into the elevator “penthouse please Jarvis” Bruce said to the AI, “certainly Doctor Banner” Jarvis replies.
So now that only leaves Steve and Peggy in the common room, there was an awkward silence for a short moment. “I think you and I need to have a little chat, don’t you think Steve?” Peggy said coldly, this sadden Steve he never wanted to upset her or even hurt her. But he did, he hurt her son and he’ll regret that for a very long time.
Steve’s smiles at the interaction with Tony and Peggy he’s happy that they are a family. But then he stop smiling when he saw Tobias giving him a good old death glare in the corner of his eye, “um listen Tobias I just want to say that....” “your what.., sorry for basically calling my dad a whore, why are you even up here you should just fuck off” Tobias interrupts him angrily, which made Steve feel even more guilty at what he said to Tony.
He sighed and looked back at his dad and continued “so I got worried and went down here to see what was going on. I.. ur... heard what he said about you and it just made me so angry that he would say such lies about you so here we are” he finishes. Tony was mad but also worries that Tobias expose himself to his teammates but at the same time he was proud of him for standing up for him.
“Well this more fun, rather than fighting bad guys and your ‘orders’ were more easy to follow” tony retorted back. “As fun as this was, what do you want to do now?” Tony wondered what this means to Rogers did he want to leave it and never talk about it, does he want to do it again?.
But instead of speaking Thor swung his hand that was holding the mjolnir and throw it towards tony and let’s go of his hammer. Tony panic, what was thor doing. He didn’t have time to think, he just stretch out his hand on instinct to prevent the hammer from dropping on the ground which could cause destruction in Tony’s work shop.
His dad was pissed to say the least, once they got home, they argued to the point it became a screaming match. Then it all came crashing down when Tobias ask one more time why no one would tell him about his mom, then his dad just snap and scream she was a rapist.
So many thoughts was going through his mind, what will Fury say to them? What should he say to his mom? Why did Natasha defend him? What will the avengers say to him now? Too many questions, too many thoughts. Too many, too many, too many, too....
With Peggy she was beautiful, inside and out. She had the confidence that nobody else had, she was funny, snarky and intelligent no one else can be like her.
All three of them were eating lunch together. They were all sitting at the large table in the common room which usually every avenger could sit together, but mostly it’s used my them, Bruce and sometimes Thor. But never Stark, which in a way frustrates Steve as he wants to bond as a team, but yet again he’s not a fan of Stark even though they have sex when things get too much for both of them.
“what are you talking about point break?” Tony ask in a shaky tone. Tony had no idea what was going on, what was thor talking about, he not asgardian.
On the data logs, the fucking hydra kept reports on the experiments they did to the men and women they captured. And what disturbed tony the most was the fact they kept records of beatings and sexual assault.
So with a nod to the wonder twins, the three of them set off to find fury and hopefully find some answers.
“An explosion happen at the crime scene were currently Agent Barton and Agent Romanoff are located, there’s hasn’t been an word on there condition or what caused the explosion Director Fury has send more agents to the seen but no word as of yet” JARVIS spoke quickly.
“Look Steve what happen last night was a personal matter and Pepper knows. I didn’t just leave, because I felt like it, I’ll call her later to tell her all the details I assure you and then we will both deal with the matter properly” he tried to explain professionally without sounding nervous in front of his team.
They all looked a Fury and each one spoke why they should stay “Because we are the best you got Sir” Clint said arrogant but true. “ You said I should look a Tony behind the mask and you are right and I saw that today and I want to make it right” Natasha spoke next, finally Fury thought. Steve was next “ I realise today I did something wrong and I hurt Tony and if you give me a chance Sir I’ll try to make that right I promise” he said with sadness and sincerity.
Tony felt sick he felt like he was back, when he was 13 with Daniel and his gang. It scared him, he couldn’t breath he wanted to get the hell out of there, so he did.
The doctors also told them that they can leave any time as Natasha didn’t need to stay for over night observation.
Agent Hill open the door even further and the three avengers bursts through the door like it’s a mission. Romanoff was the one who spoke first, “Sir we need to speak with you about Stark it’s rather important”
Fury wasn’t gonna snap yet he needed a little bit more information from them first and judging from their faces, only Steve seems uncomfortable from Barton’s question. Hmm interesting.
This was bad, was this an attack from Daniels part? What were they planning? “Right thanks J we go now” He said and was ready to suit up. But Thor and Steve stop him “Tony wait this could be a trap thy might want you there or even worse they might come to the tower and hurt your family” Steve spoke with haste. Tony didn’t want to hear this he needed to help “Look I should be there if Daniel was going to ambush us there I’ll be in my suit I’ll be ready” he tried to argue “and what about your family Anthony hey need here” Thor counters.
Surprisingly Natasha spoke up next “Clint that’s enough and same to you Steve you went too far” she said with a glare. That surprises Tony, when did she decide to take his side of things.
“Your room is just down the hall on the right JARVIS will help you if you need it” he said. Tobias nodded “ok thanks dad, good night and I love you” He said as he walked away, “Good night Bambi and I love you more” Tony spoke.
*Gasped* Tony open his eyes panting like he ran a marathon. He looked around and saw that he was still at the forest of rebirth like he was meant to be. “Damn it” he cursed under his breath, ever since he agreed to train with Thor and find his inner soul the same fucking thing always happens, he gets close then boom lighting hits him. He can’t figure it out why this happens hell Thor always says it’s because... “you’re doubting yourself  again Anthony” Thor said interrupting Tony’s train of thought.
Steve didn’t know how to answer all of that, in fact he wondered what happen to that man himself. He took a moment to think then answers “I ur.... I think that man was lost” Yeah I think that’s right Steve thought. He was looking down ashamed to look at Peggy, but he can feel her eyes on him.
Steve was pacing in the common room what felt like goes to him, he couldn’t sleep, eat or drink anything, all he couldn’t think about is finding Tony. “Can’t sleep?” A voice appears, making Steve flinch and he turns around there he can see to his surprise was Tony’s son.
Tony sighs what Steve said was true and that’s probably the best idea they could do right now “Your right, fine I stay. Thor” “I know Anthony I’ll be on my way, stay safe you two” Thor said as heads out to the location were the crime took place.
A few minutes later Stark places the two large cups of hot chocolate on the counter. Steve could honestly say that this was awkward, they in silence which felt like hours. Steve didn’t know what say, and judging by Starks looks to him he didn’t know what to say either.
Well the whole thing went to shit when they were in the helicarriar. It all went so smoothly at first, Tony and his new bestie were sciencing, the next thing everyone was in each others face. Or more like Rogers was in Tony’s face berating him on how a selfish he was and how he wasn’t a hero, well tony can dish it out too.
Once Tony was at his sons door, he quietly open the door, as he didn’t want to disturb his sons sleep.
“You think I’m jealous Stark, please your nothing but a hole to use” he said sharply and Tony wince, he hated when people call him disgusting names to him about this sexual preference. “What’s the matter Stark, not going to snark back have I actually shut you up” Steve mocked as he moved closer towards Tony. Tony however step back, he’s not gonna lie he felt scared he knows Steve would never to anything sinister towards him but he can’t help that feels what felt like when Daniel hurt him. He hoped that the spy twins would realise that this is too far and stop Steve. he looked at them with begging eyes, but they didn’t seem to care. Clint was smirking while Natasha was... well he didn’t know what she was thinking she looked concern which was strange to him.
Thor chuckled at the nickname “close your eyes, then open your mind. Find that place that makes you feel safe, find that inner peace and once you find it you’ll be able to find your soul” Thor said
In fact he was pleased he cared for Peggy deeply, after all she save his life. So it’s best suited that he in return help Peggy by protecting her son even if it’s the people that live in his home.
Apparently it did as Rogers just walk up to tony and shove him up against the wall and roughly force his lips on his, “ if that’s how you want it so be it” Rogers grunted then he grabs tony wrist and drag him towards the bedroom, so yeah tony thought this is going to be a good night.
Tony looks at Steve and smiles “well I from I could gather my soul was in a dark place and I release it and well my dad was there” this shocks Steve he wanted to ask more questions about Tony experience, but Thor interrupted them “Alright gather round it’s time to head back” he told the two. So they did what they were told and Thor raised his hammer and a white light surrounded them.
But Steve didn’t seem to understand the meaning of just shutting up, “oh come on Natasha what I said was true” he spat and by saying that Tobias was ready to strike him again “don’t you dare!” He growled as he lunges forward but Tony manages to stop him, by holding on to his arm. “Don’t Toby it’s not worth it, please stop before you get hurt” He pleas with sad eyes.
“Bruce” Steve said in a panic and he saw Bruce fall unconscious. He turns towards Tony who is also knock out, that wasn’t the only thing he saw there was a large man standing over Tony wearing a gas mask, “there you are” Steve heard the man say. The man picks up Tony in bridal style, then he saw Steve was still awake “ah Captain still hanging in there I see” the man teases. Steve tried to get up he needs to save Tony, “leave him alone you’re not taking him anywhere” he sneers.
Then Lily decide to go a step too far, “How is he, hows my son?” She simply said. Those words made Tony snap “your son? YOUR SON! Let’s get one thing right your not his mother your just a egg donor that raped the man who raised him ok, you mean nothing to him and you never will do you understand” he shouted this shock the woman and she stepped away from him like she was the victim.
Hope you like this one, now it’s going to be more interesting from now on, let me know what you hope to see in any future chapters
Then there was of course tony who added to all the stress, he was nothing but a spoiled little rich bully and Steve hates bullies. They had nothing in common, they fight all the time and tony never get involved with team bonded which Steve is glad but also displeased by it as well. He really doesn’t want to hate tony, but he makes it so difficult not too. Like he thinks he’s better than anyone else and that just piss steve off.
