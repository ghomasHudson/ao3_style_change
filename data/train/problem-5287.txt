"And seeing that I'm hooked up to the police scanner and there's been nothing about this case on it, I don't think they've had any luck," Deadpool muttered from his spot, readjusted the earbud in his ear. "I swear to god if this dude doesn't take his finger off of the talk-y button when he's not using it, I'm going to scream. This isn't a breathing ASMR, bitch. You are
Peter nodded his head. "Please," Hel talked, "Take your time. This is, after all, a big decision. One that you cannot take back."
coloured. Dry blood was mixed in with the swollen mess, as if someone splattered paint of an empty canvas, Peter's body being the said canvas. Some of the bruises were older, but still just as bad.
Peter shook his head and removed Loki's blanket. Standing up on weak legs he tried to make his way towards the exit, but Loki vanished from the couch and appeared in front of him.
Bruce Banner had to leave the room altogether, afraid he was going to Hulk-Out from the anger he felt when he looked at the teens. But it wasn't anger directed towards
Loki frowned softly as he summoned the blanket from before -- which soon became Peter's favourite as well. Smiling softly up at the man, Peter wrapped it around his body, a tired sigh escaping his lips. The silver-tongued prince took this as a silent 'thank you'.
In this fanfic, however, Wade and Peter are waaayyy closer in age. For Peter, I'd like to imagine him as Seventeen/nearly eighteen, and for Wade, I like to imagine him to be nineteen/twenty -- roughly.
Eyes widening, he quickly shoved the inconvient red shirt back in the bag, praying that Aunt May didn’t know it was his suit. “Th-Thanks, Aunt May.” Her smile growing wider, as she watched her only nephew walk out the door.
placed the plastic, brown bags on the countertop. After preheating the oven, he emptied all bags, nearly dropping a huge container of flour.
For the first time that night, Loki finally stopped holding back her tears. Arms wrapping tighter around Thor, she pulled him in closer. Her cries were muffled by his clothing and were slowly getting wetter by the minute, but he didn't mind.
A few moments later, the boy was sound asleep. Placing his head against the white, cream coloured wall Loki closed his eyes as he began to hum a soft melody of a song that his mother used to sing to him. With the final note of the song, Loki drifted off to sleep as well.
Quickly swallowing the bite of apple he had in his mouth, Peter simply shrugged, "Nothing much. I needed to talk to Aunt May about something, but other than that, I don't really have anything in mind, why?"
“Why you?” Tony repeated slowly, knitting his eyebrows together. Walking over and sitting down at the edge of Parker’s bed, he began to laugh slightly. This time, confusioin was written all over Spidey’s face as he tilted his head to the left slightly. “Do you really want to know why?” he questioned, his face turning from amusement to seriousness in a matter of a couple seconds.
Tony rolled his eyes, "One; I'm glad you do. Steve helped me decorate since I have no idea what you would like. We basically guessed here and there. Apparently though, I was right. Two; don't call me 'Mr. Stark'. It's Tony. 'Mr. Stark' makes me feel old."
." he tried to explain to the best of his abilities. "If you take that, and add what he's going through now, it's basically hell."
"How're you doing, Peter?" Steve questioned from his spot on the couch. Worry and that emotion that Peter hated so much spread through the man's body, it finally resting on his face.
Peter Parker stood up from the bed and made his way towards the middle of the room. There, he stood. He didn't speak -- he didn't know
Finally, after what felt like years, Peter finished buying all the presents, well, except for Wade's. Tony will get a new tie, Steve will receive a Captain America themed pocket watch, Wanda will receive some new cooking supplies, and Bruce will get some custom made beakers with the words 'You're Overreacting' written on them, (seeing Tony broke the last beakers in a 'Taylor Swift Rage', whatever that was).
After maths, it was science, and after that, it was lunch, then English and history. And finally, gym. Groaning, Peter departed from MJ and walked into the boys locker room with Ned. They were around three minutes early, so they knew Flash was not here yet. Quickly running to his locker, quite literally, Peter took out his gym clothes and ran off into shower area, getting dressed with what little privacy he had. Since he got his new powers, he is a lot more quick than he used to be.
Rolling his eyes, Parker scoffed. "Oh, shush," he spoke in the same tone, watching as Loki sat up from his spot and began walking towards the door. Taking a deep breath, he followed after the god.
Chewing the inside of his cheek, Peter held back the oncoming tears. Looking down at the side, Romanoff's heart broke at the sight of Parker being so disheveled. He was already going through enough dysphoria with not being able to wear a binder, but then this? There was going to be Hell to pay, that was for sure.
Removing his arm from Peter, he gently shook the young boy awake, which took about three tries. Man, he was actually a heavy sleeper. Sitting up, Parker rubbed his eyes and yawned slightly. Wade nearly teared up. He looked so innocent, like nothing bad had ever happened to him, it was amazing, truly. "Wade..?" Peter spoke softly in a tired voice. Instantly, Deadpool snapped out of his thoughts and looked Peter in the eyes through his mask.
As he exited the room, he could hear soft laughter from the living area. His cheeks tinting red from embarrassment, he bit the inside of his cheek. "Now that," Tony chuckled, "Is how you make an entrance."
"If it's any condolences, I know what it feels like," Bruce whispered softly to the group. "I mean, not what battle feels like, but wanting to end my life."
"Very unlikely." was the annoyed reply. "Why do they even make this kind of stuff anyways? What the hell?"
May only gave him a sweet smile, tears prickled her eyes as well. "I lo-ove you, Pe-Peter. Be the best h-hero you ca-an be.."
"Where do you think you're going, mister?" a strangled voice spoke from the opposite side of the room. Turning back, Tony saw Aunt May looking at him, a smile on her face, despite the pain she was going through.
"Wh... Why that hell did you punch me out cold?" Stark snapped, sitting up from his reclined position. Rubbing his forehead with his hand, he groaned as the beating on his skull started to relax slightly.
Sorry if Natasha seems a little OOC. In my opinion, I think that Peter would break down her usual 'cold' exterior and bring out the best in her. I also see them having that 'mother' and 'baby' spider relationship, if that's a thing that makes sense. But don't worry, I know how some of you like the whole Wanda x Peter friendship -- and there will be more of it!
Loki nodded, her curls sweeping over her shoulder. "Very well. Wade's last name, supposedly, is Wilson."
"I..." she sighed for the umpteenth time. "When I died, I hurt you. Norns, you even told me that I hurt you, but I didn't listen. I chose
Sitting up in a flash, she looked at the boy with wide, somewhat tear filled, eyes. "Peter?" she questioned in a whisper. She had to check, this could have been one of her dreams again where Peter was up and healthy and
Not less than a minute, and Parker is out of the showers fully dressed, and walking back to place his regular clothes in his locker. "Damn," Ned muttered under his breath. "You really are quick." Blushing with embarrassment, Peter shrugged as he shut the locker door and waited patiently for Leeds. Once the two were completely dressed, they made their way to the gymnasium.
"Oh my god -- can I kill him yet?" Stark muttered before speaking a bit louder. "Okay, look. As much as I love this little talk, I have things to prepare for me and Steve, m'kay? 'Kay." With that, the billionaire left the chocolate aisle and ran off out of eyesight.
"You didn't answer my question," Ned spoke once more, still as excited as ever. "You're living with the Aven--"
The wind picked up even more and somehow pushed the teen, his back hitting the cold concrete. A bad feeling settled in his stomach but pushed it away.
"That's good to hear. I know a lot of people think school isn't the best thing in the world, which, they're probably right, but, it is important." Steve smiled, placing the pan aside and turning off the stove top. Just then, Tony walked into the room.
But Peter couldn't answer, his vision was fading and the voices that were once so close became farther and farther away. "Peter? Peter?" once again, no reply. "Damn it." she cursed, looking over her shoulder.
In Peter's eyes, Aunt May was Wonder Woman, to others than his self, not so much. But with every 'superhero', such as Wonder Woman her self, there is always some flaw about them. Aunt May's was being human, and being human doesn't protect you from everything.
Stark, however, was another story. If it meant he could help his kid somehow, he would sacrifice the world for him. "Peter is going through some things -- hell, he's
Peter rolled his eyes before going to the bathroom. Turning on the water, he cupped his hands and filled them up before splashing his face.
Peter's eyes widened. "Is that.. Is that Tony's card?" the assassin only shrugged, her grin getting somewhat bigger.
Peter ceased up from beside of Loki. All the attention turned back towards Parker, looks of shock on all of their faces. Even Natasha showed signs of surprise. This was
Sighing, she opened the door fully for Thor to step in, which he did, and he closed the door behind them. Leaning against the wooden doorway, he watched his sister carefully.
A silent tear went down Peter's cheek, his emotions finally catching up to him. Standing up, Peter began to pace on the gravely building rooftop, all kinds of thoughts making their way into his head. More tears came out as he became more hurt. Then, Peter stopped. Turning his head, he stared at the edge of the rooftop. Breathing in, Parker stepped up onto the railing, tears cascading down his cheeks and splashing onto the concrete.
Wade sighed. "I'm just trying to find my baby boy. Plus, you were getting ready to contact me anyways. I don't see what the big deal about me just
"Yeah, go run along to your little girlfriend, Parker." Flashed laughed, his goons laughing as well. Parker's cheeks flashed with heat as Ned helped Michelle drag him away towards their maths class -- one of the only classes they all have together.
“Your red shirt is hanging out of your backpack.” she smiled, nodding her head towards the red and blue fabric.
Looking around, he found himself standing in a white space in nothing but what seemed to be a hospital gown. It felt like he was waiting for something, but he didn't know what.
It's the first day back to school, and Peter crosses his fingers that everything goes smooth. Or, at least, less bumpy.
But Peter couldn't answer, his vision was fading and the voices that were once so close became farther and farther away. "Peter? Peter?" once again, no reply. "Damn it." she cursed, looking over her shoulder.
Rubbing his hand up and down, Tony smiled a small, sad smile. His lips thinned as he pulled Peter towards him even more to where his head was resting on the top of his chest. Right now, Peter needed someone to reassure him that everything was okay and for someone to be there for him. What better way could Tony do than acting like a father-figure towards the boy.
Instantly, Wanda pulled away. Mouth agape, the female stared at the young boy who was teary eyed and panicking. "You weren't suppose to see that," he choked out, hands scrambling for his phone.
"If you'll look closely here, you can see that there's two CCTV camera here in the alleyway, but seeing that they're privately owned, the police has to have a search warrant, which can take literal hours to draw up. The possible footage could hold some valuable information, but, seeing that they can't get into it, we won't know unless they release it."
Humming to himself, he then went over towards the medicine cabinet, pulling out his Testosterone, placing it carefully in the black bag as well.. Mumbling incoherently, he zipped the bag back up, and threw it into his backpack. Walking over towards his desk, where his clothes for the trip to Stark Tower was laid out, he grabbed them and rushed back into the bathroom, locking the door as he turned on the shower water.
for Aunt May to come and open his door, warning him that dinner was nearly finished and that he needed to finish up his schoolwork.
"No ma'm -- Nat." he corrected himself. "I've been using a binder for a while now, since I came out."
Jumping slightly, Peter rushed over towards the Avengers, nearly tripping on the fluffy rug. Clint rolled his eyes, Sam holding in a laugh, as the Spider-Boy landed 'ever so gracefully' on to his hands and knees.
"My name," Parker sighed, "Is Peter. If we're friends, I think we should know each other's names, and seeing that I know yours already, I think it's only fair you know mine." There was a soft pause of silence. Wade grinned happily.
But when she opened the door and found Thor on the other side, those were both instantly gone. Clearing her throat, she raised her head to look at her brother. "Thor. What brings you here?"
Stark rolled his eyes. "My apologies," he muttered sarcastically under his breath before speaking up louder. "By any chance do you know this Wade's last name -- that is if you don't have his phone number too."
But each day, I sit at my phone or laptop and just stare. I think maybe I dissociate sometimes, but I’m not too sure. It’s like I want to write, but I
"The hell?" Tony muttered under his breath, as he blinked a couple of times, still trying to get used to the bright, living area light. "Hey Jarvis?"
Cracking open his eyelids, Steve Rogers came face to face with a beautiful wood stained vinyl player, a big red bow tied to the top. Steve's eyes widened. "Is this -- is this for
"I saw you disappear and I fret that something must've been wrong. I'm afraid I'm right," he muttered softly at the girl. "What troubles you sister? Was it something I said?"
Whipping their heads towards the unknown voice, the group had mixed emotions. Natasha and Clint were reaching for their weapons and Stark was getting ready to call his suit.
"H-Hey," he stuttered, which wasn't usually like him, "I hate to say, but it's getting late. I would ask you to say, but I know you wouldn't want to. Plus, Stark and your aunt would have the whole police force searching for you if you weren't there in the morning."
Clearing his throat, Wade stiffed his posture and pretended to read off of a giant scroll. "First up is the Superhusbands (though I prefer Stucky better. But that's for another timeline, I guess), Captain Sexy and Iron Dad. Next, my second favourite spider and your inamorato. Then, Bruce and Thor (and
“C-Coming!” he replied, grabbing his one duffel bag and backpack as he ran down the stairs, fixing his shoe halfway so it didn’t come off making him trip.
Loki glanced towards Wade's direction, and Wade looked towards theirs, the same bad feeling spreading through their body.
Stark's breath caught in his throat as he finally muted the tv, only a fraction of a second too late. "Peter, I -- I didn't mea--"
Nodding his head, Clint reached into his pocket and grabbed his phone, fumbling with it as he pressed the call button besides Bruce's contact. Not a few rings later, the man answered.
Smiling, Spider-Man walked up to the assassin and handed her the phone, the picture of him in it wide on the screen. Romanoff grinned. "It looks really good on you, Pete." she smiled. "Want to go look around, or go to a different store?"
"Hey, Wanda." Peter smiled back as he stood awkwardly in the door frame. Clint rolled his eyes and Sam just shook his head slightly with a small smile.
“I’m not! I’m just.. Going to miss you.” She smiled with a slight roll of the eyes. Dropping his bags softly, he took a few steps towards her, wrapping his arms around her tightly. Smiling, she hugged back before letting go.
Hel seemed to sigh. "To see what world you choose to travel towards. My father has heard good stories about you, thus, we are here to await your choice."
Rogers smirked. "As if. You should'a seen the shit I got into pre-serum. If it wasn't for Bu--" Steve's lips closed as he bit his tongue. The group notice this but didn't push it. "If it wasn't for my
Reaching around, Wade also pulled out a similar box. The two sat on Peter's bed, exchanging the gifts. Wade opened his first and he smiled tearilly. There, laid in the velvet coloured box, was a bracelet. On it had the coordinates of where they met engraved into the copper like gold surface. For once, Wade Wilson was silent.
“Don’t you lie to me, young man.” May said in a playful, yet scolding, tone. Walking over and sitting down on the bed his nearly empty bags were on.
Readjusting the bags on his arms, Peter led the way, like he did all the other times before, around the store, looking at anything and everything that seemed like something he would wear, or that he was interested in.
Turning on the water once more, he splashed his face and dried it on a random hand towel. Now looking much more presentable, he turned the lights off once more and walked towards the living area once more.
Loki will get some emerald earrings (for when it is his female days) while his brother, Thor, will be getting a beanie that is similar to his helmet (stitched in wigs included). Natasha, of course, will be getting a new gun holster, which was really hard to find in the mall, and Clint will be getting some Nerf arrows for his bow, seeing Tony refuses to get him any after the 'incident'.
"So, I thought that you were one of the slacker kids, so I pulled up your grades for your other classes from last year. And, to be completely honest, they're amazing. Perfect straight A's all around." he said with shock, looking towards the small student. "And it looks like you're in okay shape, so... what's the deal?"
Natasha looked to the floor as Peter then turned slightly to take off the death contraption. The dirty, raged, worn out, chest reducing fabric fell to the floor with a soft 'thud'. "Y-You can look up n-now." Peter stuttered once more. Maybe stuttering should have been his superpower. Or, maybe, disappointment. He seemed very good at the two.
"How about a different store?" he suggested, not really liking a lot of the options here. Nodding her head, Natasha took the hanger and the two walked up to the cashier. Paying for it, the two then left the store, careful to not run in to Amber again. Once out of the store, the two scanned the mall to see what other options they had.
weather for once. You know you don't like this weather either, Spidey. Can't go around in your spandex, showing off that nice ass of yours, in a heavy ass coat. Oh! Look at me! I'm Spider-Man in a--"
Turning back ahead, Peter gasped as he realized it was only down to Ned, Peter, and Flash. "Holy shit." he muttered, eyes wide. "The hell?" Ned's reaction was the same, eyes widening with a gasp as well. Flash just smirked, tossing his ball up in the air before catching it. Repeating the motions, both boys began to feel sick. "Oh, shit.." Parker whispered as his Spider Senses tingled dangerously. Soon, the ball that was being tossed by Flash was now hurdling towards Ned, hitting him hard in the stomach. Gasping, Ned feel to the ground with a loud whimper. "Jesus!" Peter nearly screamed.
Shuffling back to his desk, the doctor pulled out a pair of scissors and walked back to the brunette. Cautiously, the male begin to cut Peter's binder off of him. A smooth line cut down the center of the fabric, revealing his chest. The doctor looked down with wide eyes. "Holy shit," he muttered as he slipped the rest of the fabric off. Bruce was staring at Peter's chest. Glancing over, the other's widen their eyes.
Tony and Wanda passed out the wrapped parcels, everyone getting an equal amount -- which surprised both Wade and Peter. The group got the respective gifts from Peter. Tony loved the tie, seeing it was Ironman doodled. Steve loved his pocket watch, saying that he wanted a new one. Wanda loved her cooking supplies, instantly thanking the younger boy, saying that he shouldn't have got her anything. Bruce cackled at his beakers, which Stark laughed at as well.
After scrubbing himself for a good ten minutes, the young boy decided to jump out of the shower, and dry off. Picking up the clothes that were now situated on the sink counter, he dressed himself quickly, not knowing the exact time he would be leaving.
Peter blushed bright red and nodded his head. Wade also promised to not fondue with Parker, either. Going back to Peter's assigned room, the two stepped in and closed the door. Not wasting one second, they engulfed each other, snuggling together as they stood in the middle of the, quite large, bedroom. That is, until Peter pulled away. "Shit, I forgot." he muttered to his partner. Walking over to his desk, he fiddled with his coat and pulled out a, now wrapped, box. It was small to say the least, but Deadpool looked like he was going to cry.
The goddess felt like she was going to get sick. Placing her hand over her mouth the slightest, she turned away from the group and vanished. Her eyes became blurred as she reappeared in a bathroom that was off to the side, but she refused to cry.
Once arriving to said locker, Peter was relieved that he made it in here so far without being noticed, better yet, acknowledged. Opening the grey locker door, Peter placed his book bag inside and began to shuffle around for the correct books he would need. "Hey, Peter!" a voice shouted happily.
"A-Aunt May?" Peter called out in concern, but his voice was drowned out by the sound of the monitors beeping loudly. "Aunt May?" he tried again, tears flooding his eyes.
"I-I, uh, I had t-to stop him --- and he wouldn't l-listen!" the Scarlet witch mumbled, an apologetic expression on her face. "I-I didn't think I hit him that hard.."
Natasha only returned the smile, her usual emotionless face now turned into one of love and care. "You're welcome, Peter." With that, she stepped out of the bedroom and shut the door gently. Before walking down towards the living area where the rest of The Avengers were, she turned and looked back at the door. Speaking in a soft whisper, she smiled.
"P--Please don't tell any--anyone! I'll do whatever you w-want!" he begged, tears streaming down his face. That's when Parker felt it. Two strong arms hugging his body tightly in an overprotective way.
That idea didn't last too long, for a sharp ache hit his lower stomach, jerking him out of his somewhat trance. It didn't take the boy that long to realize that he was crying small tears. Sniffing, he wiped them from his eyes and turned to finish his shower -- not wanting to keep Loki and the other's waiting that long.
Smiling a faint smile, Natasha reached over and held Parker's hand. "Peter, you're fine. He doesn't know -- yet. He
"More like lack of them." Iron Man raised an eyebrow. Once more, Banner sighed, tugging at his sweater pawed hand. "It--It's nothing, don't worry about." he muttered after a moment. "So, what are you building for Steve this time?"
Peter grasped Aunt May's hand softly. "There's..." Aunt May halted. Clearing her throat, she tried again. "There's a le.." she gasped for air, "..tter for you.. in your ba--pack.."
Wade beamed at those words, smiling goofily under his mask. Peter stood their for a moment, however, lingering. That's when it hit wade.
Gasping. Peter was gasping for air -- that's what he was doing. But the air seemed to burn his throat.
"But," she spoke up once more, "I got to ask.. Are you binding safely? No ace bandages or tape?" Peter shook his head, admiring her concern tone of voice.
Chewing the inside of his cheek, he shrugged slightly, wincing at the rubbing fabric. "Peter.." Natasha warned. Then, she stand up and headed towards the bathroom. "Bathroom. Now." she order. Obeying what The Avenger asked of him, he followed her into the bathroom and watched as she closed the door.
"-nado warning!" the tv cut back in. "Please evacuate to somewhere safe, grab your emergency bags, and for the love of god, don't go outside!"
Peter's words were drawn to a shut as Wade's lips enclosed Peter's once more. Spidey's once saucer-like eyes fluttered shut at the touch. His sweater pawed hand reached up to hold Deadpool's face, pulling him even closer, though that was hardly possible. The hero folded into the merc, ignoring the slight bit of pain that he got for it.
The demi-god smiled softly. "Good. But first, you need to wash up. You reak of so many bodily orders that it's hard to tell which one is which." Peter rolled his eyes as he stood up and headed towards his dresser drawers. Loki sniffed the air, a sour expression on his face. "Seriously child, it smells like Thor's chamber's after coming back from a long hunt."
"Peter! Oh, good, you're awake." May smiled, letting the young boy sit up before speaking once more, "You have a visitor down in the living room."
"Well, I know for a fact thinking on top of a roof isn't the best of ideas, especially when you have one to many to drink."
Taking off, with Clint trailing behind her, the two rushed by students, one again ignoring the loud gossip. Entering the gymnasium to find it empty, Clint ran a hand through his hair. "What about the locker room?"
Once more, Peter bobbed his head. If he went to Helheim, he wouldn't have to deal with any of the pain and constant depression. But if he went to Valhalla, he would be apart of an even
Going to the white desk, the young superhero picked up the glass of room temperature water and placed it to his lips. Taking a sip, Parker once against winced at the new, but familiar, substance sliding down his throat. Placing the glass back down on the desk, Peter stared at the food on the little tray the girl's provided. Though the food was still decently warm, the young teen couldn't bring himself up to eat any of it. It was like all of his appetite went away.
The boy's cheeks paled even more. "How would you know? You don't understand what it's like to wake up, expecting to see a note from your Aunt saying that she was off at the local supermarket and that she would be back in an hour, ready to cook a meal for you and your uncle -- and you don't understand what it's like to wake up in the morning and having to look at yourself in the mirror, hating everything that you see."
And that's how the security cameras saw the Avenger running out of the store as if an angry chihuahua was chasing after him.
But no matter how big his bag was, it wasn't large enough to carry the memories of his childhood home.
"Young Peter is transgender, correct?" Thor spoke from his spot. Instantly, Natasha, Clint, Tony, and Bruce (who just happened to walk in at that time), snapped their hands towards the god.
“Oh, don’t act coy, Pete.” Tony laughed, walking around the small, blue painted room. “You know what I’m talking about,” he smiled, turning around to face the brown haired boy. “So, Spider-Boy, I wanted to propose an offer.”
"Hey, Wanda," the two males smiled back in unison. Now finishing his cereal, Cap stood up and walked off towards the sink, washing it quickly and saying his farewells before walking off to somewhere else.
"Stop right there." Nat interrupted with a hand in front of her. Peter stopped mid-sentence. It would be a great lie to say that he wasn't intimidated by The Avengers. "You don't have to go all formal, like we've said before. Call me Natasha -- or Nat for shorter." she smiled slightly, her soft green eyes shimmering softly in amusement.
With presents in his arms, stacked so high he had to walk sideways to see, Peter walked into the living room of the Avenger's Tower, Wade by his side. Wade, was also carrying around the same amount of parcels, but, Peter, unluckily, had a bit more.
"I did it to see if you would even care," she whispered softly, her eyes reddened as she looked at her brother. "I never meant to hurt you -- but I did and I can't take that back and I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, brother."
A few minutes passed, the only sound echoing in the room was the clock hands, signalling more time has went by. Tony broke the awkward silence, thankfully. With a big sigh, he took a quick look at his watch. "Food should be here, right... about.."
to go back. And no, it wasn't because he didn't want to see his only friends, it was because off all the stress between schoolwork and Flash. Plus, Peter knew the moment he went back, Flash would start up right where they left off, and they did
Sighing, he hissed when he touched the wound. Rolling his eyes, he slid off the binder, placing it on top of the mess of clothes. Taking a wet wash rag from wherever it came from, he dampened it and placed it on the  red area. Couple seconds pass and he removes the rag. Lifting his arm up once more, he notices the redness went down slightly.
"We're all walking on eggshells, guys. We have to figure out what our following actions are and/or should be."
"Where am I?" Peter questioned, his eyes weary as the two women exchanged a look. "Who are you two?"
"Oh, Pete..." she whispered, tears in her eyes as her chest began to hurt with pain and guilt. "I'm so sorry.. You shouldn't have to go through this.."
But the door didn't open -- and the smell of whatever May decided to cook didn't fill his nostrils either.
Laughing at the shirt he picked out, he blowdried his hair breifly, leaving the rest to air dry, before turning the bathroom light off and strolled back into his ‘quarters’. Finishing up the things left to do, (all including to double check everything, pack his laptop and charger). Noticing that there was only a little bit of T left, he made a mental note to ask Aunt May to get it refilled, seeing that he was still unfunfortable getting it himself.
Similar to Hawkeye, Iron Man had an idea as well. Quickly buying everything in his cart (which was filled to the brim, mind you), the hero loaded his car and drove off into the near sunrise.
The group stared dumbfounded. "Why haven't you told us this before?" Barton spoke, making sure the god was finished speaking this time.
Anger boiled up in all three of them, though Bruce tried to control his. He couldn't let the big guy out. Not yet, at least.
"Tomato potato." Wade waved his hands and he looked down at the younger boy. "Anyway, let's go somewhere else so we can talk -- somewhere without a rooftop to dangle from."
"Okay, I get it. I'm not good at hiding things." he huffed, pouting the slightest. The Widow rolled her eyes and nudged the kid.
"Know about what exactly?" the assassin questioned, tilting her head to the side. "About you being beaten up or who you really are?"
"Oh dear. This could end very badly for me, won't it?" he voiced. Loki simply smirked before flipping a piece of her long, black hair out of her line of vision.
!" Standing up from his computer, Stark stalked off to the kitchens. The door slamming behind him made even Wade flinch.
"What the hell are you doing here, Katniss?" Jumping nearly a mile into the air, Clint looked up to find that he
"Valhalla is a special place, and most often not a choice for many mortals. Those that inhabit the halls after death were great warriors in life. They await there until they are called to fight by Odin’s side in the battle of Ragnarok. The Valkyries help pick the heroic warriors from amongst the dead, known as ‘Choosers of the Fallen’, allowing those deemed worthy enough to pass on to the sacred halls of Odin. And you, mortal, are deemed worthy. However, if you choose to travel to Valhalla, you will automatically be accepted for the battle of Ragnarok." Hel explained.
amused. "But," Barton sighed, eyes landing on a gold looking metal. "I'm making Natasha's Valentine's present."
Though, what he wasn't expecting was the soft melody of Frigga's favourite Asgardian song. Smiling softly, though it pained him to do so, he spoke the last words of the song in a whisper.
The doors closed and not a second later, they opened again. This time, it revealed a different scenery.
Carefully unwrapping the paper, he then open the box. Parker matched his boyfriend's expression. Teary eyed, he laughed softly at the gift. It was two gold, matching necklaces in the form of handcuffs. Inside was a folded up piece of paper. Picking up the piece of paper, the young boy read it aloud in a soft whisper;
"Hey, listen here." Natasha growled towards the woman. "You are going to let him go into the changing room -- the
“Oh, Natasha, cut him some slack. I was same way before turning into ‘Captain America’.” a blond headed man sighed. Eyes widening, Peter realized it was Captain America. THE Captain America.
"Brother Anthony please lay off of Loki -- and sister, please lay off of brother Anthony. You both are going through some things and are taking it out on the nearest person, which so happens to be each other." Thor interjected. "We are both here to help Brother Peter, are we not?"
"My apologies, sister," Thor spoke with a nod of his head before turning back to the crowd of Avengers. Each of them was equally confused -- though they tried their best to hide their expression. All except Wanda, Natasha, Vision, and Sam of course. They all seemed to accept it and push the matter aside. This isn't something they should make a big deal out of.
Going into the men's side, Peter avoided looking at all the other people going in and out of stalls. Finding an empty one, Peter walked in and closed the door, making sure to lock it behind him. Peter was always afraid of going into the men's dressing room -- always afraid someone would call him out for not being 'a real boy' or walking in on him mid-dressing and finding out he has breasts.
The auburn hair assassin gripped the steering wheel as she turned right, pulling up to a high school. "It's Peter." she spoke. Barton's breath hitched. It would have to seriously bad for Natasha to get this worked up.
Turning towards the side, Peter frowned and gently placed his hand on one of the wounds, instantly flinching away with a small hiss. Giving up, Peter walked back over to his drawers and pulled out his worn out, torn up grey binder. Placing it on, with a bit of struggle, Parker groaned out through gritted teeth as it wiped over the marks. Sucking in a deep breath, Peter walked over towards the desk and pulled the handle to one of the bottom drawers. Taking out the red and blue suit, Peter slipped it on, trying his best to ignore the nagging he was going to get later.
"I've tried talking to them," Thor said, speaking up for the first time. Sam jumped, only now realizing that the two Asgardian's were still in the room with them. "But every time I go and try to open the door, it's always locked and boarded up."
Both their hearts were beating fast that Wade had trouble catching his breath. Peter couldn't get a decent one either. Wide eyes, Parker looked like he saw a ghost. "I-I'm sorry, I didn't--"
he questioned to himself. Pulling once more for good measure, he placed his book on the bedside table and nodded his head. Soon realized that the voice couldn't see him, he cleared his throat loudly and answered with a simple 'Yeah, sure.'
Loki appreciated his earrings, saying that they were a beautiful colour of green. Thor instantly put on his beanie, the stitched wigs flapping as he turned his head in all directions. Loki facepalmed, muttering under his breath about something. Natasha and Clint both enjoyed their presents, Tony nearly cursing Peter out for buying Barton the arrows.
Once the balls were all aligned on the thin, black line running down the middle of the gym, Flash walked over to the right side and bent down into a running pose. And just like that, all hell broke loose.
To say that she was beyond pissed was an understatement. But to say that her worry didn't outgrow her anger would be a lie. Whether she liked to admit it or not, she's gotten quite attached to the young boy, and so have countless others that were standing in the room.
Landing on top of a roof, he plopped himself down on the ledge, looking down at the ground below him. Sure, he was a little iffy about heights, but nothing could beat this view. Sooner or later, the sun went down passed the horizon, the cold night air replacing the hot musty air before it. Once the sun was down completely, darkness took over the sky, a few stars dotted the sky. Smiling under his mask, he looked up, holding onto the ledge with both hands. It was peaceful, just the way he liked it. That is, until his 'Spidey Senses' acted up.
Nearly jumping a mile high, Peter placed his hand over his chest when he realized it was only Ned. Sighing once more, Peter relaxed and smiled back at his best friend. "Hey, Ned. Where's MJ?"
Walking in, Tony locked the door behind him. But Peter knew very well that Aunt May barging in was the least of their problems. Sitting down on the bed, Peter looked up at the billionair before him.
Sighing, she ran a hand through her hair -- a nervous habit she picked up from Peter from the time they have spent together. "Unfortunately. I need to get him a new one, but I don't know his size."
?" Tony smiled, nodding his head as he placed a record onto the machine, music slowly starting to spill throughout the room.
"Instead, I would wake up and come face to face with my reflection, hating everything that I could see," he repeated Peter's words. "I was disgusted with myself -- and I still am."
"Thank you." the young boy whispered. Pulling out the two necklaces, Spider-Man put on his and then scooted closer to his 'partner in crime' and clipped Wade's on him. "It's amazing."
Once inside completely, he let out a small sigh, the tons of grocery bags in his hands becoming a bit too heavy and a bit too uncomfortable. Closing the door with his foot, he walked over towards his kitchen and
Eyeing the clock on the wall, he realized it was too early to turn in for the night, plus, he has to go help around town tonight. This made him even more irratated. First, he's almost out of T, which barely works in the first place, it wears off so fast due to getting bit. Now, his binder is basically a heap of worn out shit.
know that, either." Peter frowned. Walking into the classroom, the three took their designated seats towards the back. Ned to the right of Peter, and MJ to the left of Peter -- just like they did last year. Except, Flash was
“Now, let me help you pack,” she smiled, standing up once more and walking over towards the brown dresser drawers.
The only thing he could do was carefully take it out of the box and slip it on his wrist. Placing his hands on either side of Peter's face, he kissed the younger boy passionately, the only way he could say 'thank you' at the moment. Peter smiled as they pulled apart. Now, it was time for Peter to open his.
Peter only shook his head. Blinking away some tears, he continued his way to his bedroom, the assassin following behind. Opening the door with one hand, Peter sighed and set down the dozen of bags near his desk; Natasha doing the same with her load. Taking his phone out of his pocket, Parker set it on his desk. Sitting on the edge of his bed, he stared at his hands that were folded up in his lap.
ii - I am in now way bashing or disrespecting Belk. This is simply apart of the story, and this was one of the many stores they had listed at my local mall. So, respectively, I chose said store.
"Gasp!" Tony said aloud with all the dramatic flair of a Shakespearean actor on opening night. "Steven,
The night drew to an end, everyone parting their ways; Rhodey went back to his house and Aunt May was called a taxi to take her back to her own home. The rest of the Avengers went back to their room. Tony and Steve both allowed Wade to stay the night, seeing how late it was, but only if they didn't, as Tony put it, 'fondue'. (Steve smacked Stark upside the head after that).
"How are you this morning?" the redhead asked, looking over her shoulders from where she stood in front of the cabinets, deciding what she wanted for breakfast today.
"Well, if it isn't Penis Parker." a new voice, once more, taunted. Stopping in his tracks, Peter swallowed dryly. Ned's excitement vanished from sight as he and Michelle glanced at each other.
The lights to all homes and stores flickered as if someone was messing with the power line. The strong wind picked up even more. Children began to cry as a loud siren blared from outside.
Loki frowned softly. "You are wrong." he simply spoke, causing Peter to zip his mouth shut. "I do know what it's like. For the longest time, I had faked my death -- thinking it would be for the better. I was... I was wrong, to say the least." he sighed. "I would wake up, expecting my brother to greet me at the dining hall, waving me over as he smiled brightly with food in his mouth, nearly
"Alright, let's eat!" Tony boomed excitedly as everyone started to carry food towards the dinning room, placing it all down on the kitchen table. Thanking Tony silently, Peter sighed a breath of relief, glad to avoid confronting the small embarrassing moment that Aunt May caught with him and Wade.
A woman then walked into the classroom, breaking Peter's thoughts. The woman had brown, greying hair and round glasses. Ignoring the class, she placed down her bag and turned around her to pick up a stray piece of chalk and began to write on the board. It was some kind of equation that Peter was sure they would be learning.
Tony rolled his eyes, equally dramatically, "You're fine, Wilson. If there are any people starving, it's probably Steve, Peter, and when they arrive, Thor and Loki -- seeing they have faster metabolisms than you do." Deadpool resisted the urge to flip the old man off. He good and well was starving, and no billionaire was going to tell him he wasn't!
A knock sounded from the door, Tony's famous smirk growing even wider. Clint just groaned as Steve looked amused. Grabbing the food, only after paying, he walked into the kitchen -- everyone following suit. Sitting down, Steve took a place besides Tony, who took a seat besides Sam. Next, Wanda took a seat besides Natasha, Natasha taking a seat besides Clint. Bruce sat at one end of the table while there was only one empty spot on the other end.
"Woah there, Pete." Natasha said with slightly wide eyes. "Calm down, Pete -- Pete!" Natasha said louder, snapping Peter out of his self destructive thoughts. "Calm down," she frowned slightly. The green eyed assassin placed two sturdy hands onto his shaking shoulder.
"We're going to take to the streets. Search every corner and every possible alleyway. Baby boy likes to stalk in the shadows, whether he's out of spandex or not. Tony Stank, Siri-Rip-Off, Rhode Island, and Bald Eagle can take to the sky -- and I guess Hawkdude can too 'cause I know how much he likes being
Slamming the door open, he lifted the toilet seat as the bile rose from his throat, to his mouth, and, finally, into the toilet; the porcelain stifling his noises as he cried out in agony, screaming as if he just lost a part of him -- and to an extent, he did.
sit beside of Bruce. Not because he was scared of him, but because he was scared that he would bother him or embarrass himself.
A crack of thunder made itself known in the background and a heavy gust of wind blew his hood back, revealing his face.
TRIGGER WARNING: THE FOLLOWING CHAPTER CONTAINS THE MENTIONS OF SUICIDE/PAST SUICIDE TENDENCIES AND ABUSE. IF YOU ARE UNCOMFORTABLE WITH THESE KINDS OF THEMES, PLEASE EXIT THE CHAPTER AND KEEP SAFE. THANK YOU.
"I have no idea.." she muttered under breath. "This shit looks like something that was rejected from some fashion show." Once more, Peter laughed loudly. "What? It's true!" the auburn haired female laughed with him. Shaking his head, Peter stuffed his hands into the back of his jean pockets. Begging to walk around, he did find some clothes that
“Kid, slow down, you’re making me dizzy.” Stark grumbled, placing his head in his hand, closing his eye for a minute or two.
Tears rolled down his cheeks as he shouted, begged, and cursed for someone to bring back his family -- his
“Y-Yeah..” he whispered back, choking on a cry. But he needed to be strong, for himself, and for him not to make a fool out of himself.
"You must be Peter." the nurse spoke softly, a small smile on his face. Parker sniffed and looked up at the male. "She talks about you all the time -- it's one of her favourite topics."
Walking in after Loki, Peter found himself to be the centre of the attention. All of the Avengers turned their head towards the two, more specifically, Peter. And, of course, the look that Peter pre-told was etched into their faces; pity. Ignoring the looks, he walked over and sat down beside of Loki on the loveseat to the far left.
So, just to clear up any confusion, the last chapter was a 'Prolouge' (seeing that was the reason it was so short) and this chapter is the actual 'First' Chapter.
"-- He was female at birth but identifies as a male." Banner answered, nodding his head. Clint, as well, bobbed his head, understanding the situation a little better now.
Reaching for his phone, he ignored the concerned voice of his mother. Opening the phone, he saw there was one notification on his phone.
“Ah, yes!” Stark said suddenly remembering what he came down here for, “I wanted to talk to you about something… important.” he said, raising a hidden eyebrow at the word important.
See, he was finally allowed to wear it, only because Natasha knew that him not wearing it at school would be 'suicide' for him. So when Flash threw the purple ball, it knocked his binder to the side, making it almost impossibly tighter on his chest. He was still a bit sore from the wounds, but, he was dealing with it. That is, until he gets a new binder. This one was almost a couple sizes too small.
Eyes widening and panic attack on the verge, Parker carefully spoke. "Ho-How much did they tell you?" he barely got out. "Wh-Why you?"
"What happened to the supermarket shindig?" Stark questioned, screwing a piece of material into place.
Looking up to the older man, Peter squinted his eyes slightly, trying to understand what he meant by that. But before he could get any deeper in thought, Stark sighed once more and began talking in a more brighter, upbeat tone of voice.
It wasn't mean to come off as narcissistic or anything, Loki can reassure you that much. But when he watched Edward and Peter collapse against each other over their friend MJ, what was it like for Thor to lose Loki?
Mumbling under his breath, he let his partner drag him to a different part of his workshop. "Alright, annnnnnnd open!"
Nodding his head, Peter followed The Avenger to the big kitchen. Upon entering, Wanda was sitting on a kitchen stool, a dark pink apron on her body. Smiling, Wanda handed Natasha an apron in the colour black, and Peter one in the colour red. Natasha threw hers on quickly and tied her auburn hair back into a messy pony tail; Wanda tying hers into a messy bunch. Placing on the apron, Peter tied on his red apron fairly quickly before pulling out a list that was folded up in his back jean pocket.
"I'll help, Spidey." Deadpool spoke up, grabbing the attention of the young superhero. A small smile appeared on the young boys face as he grabbed the plates and walked off into the next room to set up the table with the masked mercenary. Once everyone was out of ear shot, Peter sighed a breath of, somewhat, relief. "So," Wade spoke while taking some of the dishes and silverware, placing them in their correct spots. "What brings you to this side of the Tower?"
Wilson rolled his eyes at the conversation his 'boxes' were having and reached across the table to pick up a crêpe rolled bandage. Opening it, he carefully wrapped the cream coloured bandage around Peter's midsection, right where the gnash was.
Rushing back into the actual bedroom, he ripped off his shirt and placed on his chest binder. Looking down at his binded chest, he let out a sigh.
"Hey, uh, Wanda?" Tony answered back in more of a question. "What's going on? What can't I find out?"
Minutes passed -- or maybe it was seconds -- and his breathing became harder to control. His vision became blurry and he gripped his legs to his chest so tightly that it would leave contusions. His head was so loud -- so
The nervous boy felt like he was going to faint. "Peter, please. I'm trying to help you here. If it makes you any better, I'm not going to judge or laugh at you. You will always be a male, or whatever the Hell you want to identify as, in my eyes." she smiled warmly at the boy. Exhaling very audibility, he slowly took of the red cloth, gritting his teeth as the fabric of the binder moved on his skin as he moved.
“I-- I mean, I have to talk to Aunt May and everything.. I can’t just.. Just leave her!” Peter mumbled, getting up from his place on the bed and walking towards the middle of the small bedroom, pacing around from one side to the other.
"I have cancer, Pete. Bad cancer." she whispered out softly. Parker's jaw went slack and his eyes mimicked saucers. Tony turned his head to the side as the nurse took his cue to leave.
Wade's idea of a good time usually meant enchiladas, alcohol, and a good movie, but seeing that Peter couldn't drink, nor even stomach food at the moment, Wade had to improvise. So, there they were; New York's amazing Spider-Man laying up against the infamous mercenary watching Harry Potter -- which Deadpool claimed to be his favourite movie, well, at least
"My God." the assassin finished for him, her eyes wide just like Peter's. The two turned their heads to look at each, observing their reactions. Then, in a split second, the two began to chuckle loudly, earning weird looks from some random passerby.
"Come on, Brucie, please!" Clint whined, pouting his lip as he gave the man his best puppy dog eyes. He's been begging for exactly five minutes and twenty three seconds.
But I swear I’m trying my best, and hopefully in the near future I can start updating more frequently — fingers crossed.
It was only a few (literal) minutes later when Deadpool heard a light knock on his living room window. Snapping his head, he walked over towards it to find Peter bruised and out of breath. "Peter -- shit!" he cursed as he helped the weak teen in through the window.
Natasha, however, was the most pissed. Her heart rate increased ten folds as her mouth went dry. Her jaw was clinched tightly and her muscles were tense. Her hands, that were now by her side, were balled into tight fists, her fingernails digging into her palms as they shook with anger.
. "I'm coming, I'm coming, hold your socks." he spoke. Wade rolled his eyes before stepping forwards to zip up the dark red coat that Peter so idiotically left unzip in the middle of
"Peter," Natasha tried once more, her short auburn hair still tied up sloppily, whilst Peter's was sticking to his face in bunches. "Peter, breathe -- you have to breathe, Peter."
"No-- Peter!" Clint nearly shouted, "Help a man out. Which is better, Star Wars of Star Trek?" Barton questioned Peter.
Once he was done with his face, Wade took the hand that Peter coughed blood into and wiped that clean as well. Placing the dirty rags on the old, stained coffee table. Wade took the opened water bottle and unscrewed the lid. Placing the plastic bottle to Spider-Man's lips, the young hero took a slow sip, hating the way it hurt his throat. After a couple more drinks of the liquid, Wade placed the bottle back on the table in front of him.
Chewing on the inside of his lip, Wanda lead him over to her spot on the furniture, letting him take the spot and claiming the one next to him.
"This is my fault..." he muttered towards Loki, not being able to turn around to see any other person's face. "I killed Michelle... oh my god, I killed Michelle!" he sobbed, his legs suddenly becoming even weaker. Luckily, Loki was there to catch him before he hit the floor.
"Great!" Tony hollered out, seeing his boyfriend nearing his table. "I was just about to come get you!" Steve's eyebrows furrowed.
"Shit." was all Clint replied as the car turned off. The two jumped out of the car, slamming the door behind them. Running up the stairs, the pair received strange looks from the passerby students. Some of them gasped and pointed out who they really were (Black Widow and Hawkeye). It was surprising, to say the least, seeing they were in casual clothing. Before they had received the panicked call, the two had been lounging in Clint's room, both reading their own books. They enjoyed their small, quiet time together, for they could hardly ever be alone at some points.
"N-Never!" he replied, his voice coming out a bit louder than attended to. This only made Nat laugh harder. "Why are you laughing at me?" the small boy asked softly, his face becoming a flaming scarlet.
As for Peter and Michelle? They were the most amazing best friends that he could ever ask for -- always being there for him when he needed it, and he vice versa. "Morning, Ned." his mother smiled.
“I can talk to your incredibly hot aunt for you, but I need you to decide for yourself, not just on Aunt May’s decision, alright?” Tony said in a soft voice, worrying about the young spider.
Deadpool smiled a small, sincere smile. "Baby boy, you don't have to thank me for anything. I mean, I wouldn't do this for any 'ol person, but, you're different. You're...
"Peter, this is Sam. Sam this is Peter." Bruce spoke from out of no where, making Peter jump nearly ten feet out of his own skin. "Sorry, Peter." Bruce apologized.
The two stayed like that, staring into each other's eyes, blue reflecting blue. What a lovely sight it was.
A young boy walked along the shadows of the ally way, his face obscured by a hoodie thrown over his messy brown hair. Bags decorated his under eyes and his cheeks were painted red from the strong wind.
"Peter," he spoke softly, his voice calming, "I know that you are transgender." Panic rose in Peter. "But there is nothing wrong with that," Loki reassured, resolving some of the anxiety in the boy. "I understand what you're going through, especially in this dreaded situation."
people constantly. All he wanted, really, was for Peter to be happy. And seeing this distraught, mess of a hero? It made the man insane. He was filled with outrage.
Wanda was the first one to step up, walking over quickly to the small hero, bending down with a concern look. "Are you okay, hun?" she questioned, eyebrows raised as they knitted together.
asshole, who enjoyed taking out his problems at home onto innocent classmates, specifically, Peter. Wade was outraged when he told him about what he had done, and continuously does. Though, for the sake of Peter, he managed to bottle it up and only make some snide remarks to Yellow and Whitey -- which, even
"Are you sure?" Bruce questioned. "Once I cut it, it wouldn't even be able to be sewed back together -- it's in literal pieces!"
Pulling back just enough to separate but not stop being in contact with each other, Ned huffed a breath as he used the long sleeve of his shirt to wipe the remaining tears from his cheeks. Peter did the same.
“Your sister, I’m sorry that you had lost her at such a young age.” Tony repeated as it clicked for Peter.
"Now," Natasha talked, swallowing a bit of her rice before Steve decided to fuss at her. "Tell us the truth, Peter. Why are you on edge?"
"I'm making Nat something," he repeated as he grabbed the torch and flicked it on, blue flame sprouting from the end of it causing him to smile.
"Atta boy" Nat grinned happily. Picking up her cellphone, the two then turned and walked out of the female's room, out of The Avenger's Tower, and straight into one of Tony's many cars. Stepping into the passengers seat, Peter fastened his seat belt, Natasha doing the same but from the driver's side. Putting the respective keys in the ignition, the assassin started the car, the car's engine roaring to life.
Those seven words made Peter froze, eyes widening behind his hood. Trying to keep his voice steady, he carefully chose his words, “Y-Yeah?”
"Yeah," the young boy spoke after a minutes silence, tears prickling the back of his eyes as he took a deep breath. Wade looked taken aback, his eyebrows raised highly at the sudden change of Peter's attitude. "Wade," Parker muttered as he turned his head to face the mercenary. "You promise you won't think of me any differently?" Wade shook his head, a soft, sad smile on his lips.
"Leave me alone, Flash." Peter pleaded as he walked to his locker. As he was in the middle of undoing his lock, Flash turned him around and pinned him to the locker.
Realizing that the masked mercenary was right, and that he could, after all, function without sarcasm for a straight second. Biting his bottom lip, Peter sighed and stared at the untouched glass of liquid. "Peter."
Confused, Clint obliged and the two ran (literally) towards the garage. Getting in one of the cars, Natasha grabbed the keys, turned the car on, and flew out of their like a bat from hell. "Nat, what's going on?" Clint questioned finally, not liking how he was often left out of stuff, such as conversations and important things -- like this. Though, when he was with Natasha, that rarely ever happened.
Five minutes later, he stepped out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his lower half, and another hanging on his neck, blocking the view of his upper 'problems'. Closing the shower door behind him, he turned back around to face the mirror, a look of disgust on his face. Frowning, he grabbed his toothbrush and began to brush his teeth.
Walking over, Peter sneered in disgust, poking a random floral coloured shirt. "Who wears this much floral?" he asked The Avenger. Shaking her head, Natasha was, for once, was at a loss for words.
"That was... unpleasant," Thor spoke from his sitting position. This was the first time that he's met the famous spiderling, and their first impression was Peter having a breakdown. Clint rolled his eyes, wanting to make some kind of smartass remark, but, for once, he didn't have it in him. Instead, he spoke softly towards the group.
A small smile was placed on his lips as he looked at the assassin. Moving his finger the slightest, Peter held back a loud groan of pain, hoping to capture his friends attention. Romanoff, of course, didn't catch it, for it was barely there and she was sound asleep for what was probably the first time in a while. Closing his eyes tightly, Parker breathed. Moving his finger once more, he felt Natasha go stiff.
The group of misfits and heroes were crowded around one of the many long tables stashed away in a boring conference room that was hardly used. Both Tony and James decided it was finally necessary to hold a meeting about what to do.
Peter sighed as he stared at the text. Slowly, his fingers moved to type in a response. 'It... hurts.. A lot, really. It's almost like I can still feel Flash's kicks.. is that weird..?
Growling, Natasha forced herself to not throw a right hook. Instead, she grabbed the shopping bags (from previous stores) and ordered Peter to come on -- and to bring all the clothes. Throwing them onto the cash register, Natasha payed for the stuff (telling Peter that she would just take it back if it didn't fit) and then left the store with a giant shout of; "Fuck you!"
On televisions everywhere, the local news stations were blaring with a siren. "And coming up next, we will be talking with-- wait. I'm getting some news." the news anchor spoke. "A what? I can't hear you -- speak u--"
"Clint, call Bruce and tell him that we're bringing someone in who is seriously injured and needs medical attention right away. Don't let them know it's Peter -- and do
On a velvet  surfaced laid a (what seemed to be handmade) golden necklace in the shape of an arrow, purple wiring wrapping around the bottom half in a small spiral. It all connected on a golden looking chain.
“Kid? You alright? You look like you’re gonna have a panic attack?” Tony’s voice was laced with concern as he looked down to his left.
Natasha, still very weary clad suited man, placed her gun back in the gun holster strapped to her left thigh. "Put your guns, pocket knives, katanas, and daggers on the table and join us on the couch, Wade."
Peter was surprised that he's lasted so long as the crime-fighting spider, seeing the world was slowly forgetting about him.
"You are between worlds, dear child. Between Valhalla, Helheim, and Midgard. We are here to greet you and await your decision." Death spoke, her posture straight and upright as she looked down at the smaller boy.
A stray tear rolled down Peter's face as he sniffed. Clutching the cut out clipping to his chest, and raised his knees to his chest. Placing his chin on his knees, he silently cried for a good ten minutes.
Sighing, Tony started talking once more, “But despite those small things, you remind me of someone I used to know. The attitude to prove it, too.”
Wade shook his head. "Nothing, babe. Now, let's go because I know the mall is going to be packed fuller than my Quinceañera." Peter chuckled slightly as his boyfriend grabbed his hand and ran, yes, ran, out the front door, almost forgetting to shut it behind him. Rushing to the small black car, Peter hopped in the passenger side as Wade quickly moved to start the car and getting the heat going. "Damn winter." he muttered under his breath. Wade was never one for cold weather. Once more, Peter laughed softly.
"I forgot to tell you that Natasha wanted to talk to you later today. Something about going somewhere."
Bruce stood for another couple of minutes, silently watching Stark build before he started to slowly retreat. Grabbing his mug of cocoa, he walked towards the door. "You know," Tony's voice came from behind him. Turning around, he looked to his friend. "You can always talk to me about it -- your bad dreams or whatever. And if you don't want to talk about them, I'm always up for listening to whatever.."
Soon, the turkey was finished. Peter's stomach growled loudly, causing the females to laugh softly, their stomachs following suit. Wanda blushed lightly at the sound she made. Natasha brushed it off and tried her best to cool the turkey slightly so she could start carving the meat. While Natasha finished the last of the carving, the second oven beeped, signalling  that the mincemeat pie was now finished. Running his tongue over the bottom of his lip, Peter pulled on the oven mitts and pulled out the pie. Placing it on the counter, next to all the other food, Peter put the mitts back up, making sure to pick up after himself. He couldn't stand a messy station, though his room sometimes resembled a pigsty.
Romanoff huffed, opening the boys' locker room door. Once out completely, she let go of the door, letting it shut on its own. "Now is not the time, Clint. We need to get Peter to Bruce ASAP -- with out letting any of the others see him in this state."
Currently, the billionaire was at a local supermarket, dressed in a cherry red jacket and sunglasses as he searched for the perfect gift for his beloved, Steve. It was only coincidental that he ran into two familiar faces. "Well, fuck me."
Deadpool sprung into action. Hightailing himself into the bathroom, Wade grabbed the first aid kit, towels, washrags (both wet and dry), and ran back into the living room. Dumping the pile of things onto the coffee table in front of him, Wade sprinted into the kitchen. Opening the door, he grabbed a bottle of water. Setting that down to the side, he grabbed a bubblegum pink bowel from the cabinet above him and filled it up with water. Picking up both items, he (speed) walked back into the area Parker was in.
But his mind -- oh, his mind was screaming. Screaming in pain and torture and sadness and so many other feelings that he didn't know.
It had been exactly one week and three days that the tiny teenager known as Peter Parker stayed at his aunt's place, and it was only one week and three days that he was being kicked out.
With that being said, Spider-Man cleared his throat once more, trying his best to start up a different subject -- one of him
“Oh, uh, yeah, she, um.. Died, when I was seven.” he replied with fake tears glistening in his eyes. ‘Damn, I should be an actor.. Maybe I could even play in a Spider-Man movie!’
"Think what you think," a voice spoke, startling Mr Stark enough for him to drop the tool. Clanking on the cool, concrete floor, the billionaire turned to find Bruce Banner leaning up against the door frame, hot cocoa in both hands. Currently, he was wearing an over sized dark purple sweater and baggy sweatpants.
Loki smiled softly at the young mortal, a small laugh rippling through his body. "Peter, I can help you with your body dysphoria. I am what you call genderfluid."
Barton clapped and followed after his friend. Standing outside the stall (that was occupied by Banner), he patiently waited, camera at the ready.
"Th.. Thank you, sir." Parker thanked him before stepping into his bedroom. "Holy..." he muttered to himself at the gigantic room.
"Oh, you used my name! What a lovely surprise," Barton chuckled from his squatted position. A long silence proved that the other hero was
It was exactly 5:03 am when Steve walked into the lab to retrieve Tony, seeing that he wasn't in bed with him to begin with. "Tony?" Rogers called out as he stepped into the (quite) large atelier.
Huffing, Peter apologized to his friend. "Go. I'll text you later, okay?" Nodding his head, Ned retreated sadly to the gym rooms, saying a quick goodbye. Pulling on his shirt, Peter walked over towards the coach who was watching Flash walk around the room, a bag in one hand as he bent down and put the balls back up -- repeating this motion over and over again. "You wanted to see me, coach?"
His bruises were a profusion of colors that normally should not be on someones chest, let alone skin. There were lurid purple splotches, roughly the size of a foot, while others were more greyish -- but still looked just as bad. They were littered across his chest. It was hard to find a clear patch of skin that
“Don’t tell me you’re gonna go all fanboy on ‘ol Cap over there.” Hawkeye asked, looking over the back of the couch.
All these people, Natasha, Wanda, Mister Stark, Steve, and so many others. They all claimed to care about him -- treating him as an equal on the battlefield of life.
Steve tilted his head, copying Tony's actions from just a mere minute ago. "The fourtee-- oh. Oh shi--"
Stark banged on the door to Peter and Ned's shared room. Of course, there was no answer. "Pete, Ned, come out and talk to us!" A moment of silence went through one ear and out the other. "Please..?"
I, personally, have been addicting to this song for a little bit now, and thought it would be the perfect song between the two {Natasha and Peter}. Like previous chapters, I do apologize is Nat seems a little bit OOC.
"I, uh.." Maximoff stuttered, her eyes widening as they darted around the room for any acceptable answer. "You see.. there was this, uh, fly.."
"Isn't that what Steve's for?" Wade asked, dressed out in his infamous spandex costume. He was completely ignoring the stares of frightened children around him. From beside him, Clint sniggered.
workshop, birdbrain." Tony sniggered as the assassin walked into the room and started rummaging through the smaller pile of metal to the side. "Okay, so I'll ask again -- what are you doing here, Clint?"
Thor frowned deeply as he pulled his sibling into a hug, holding her tightly around her waist as Loki wrapped her arms around Thor's neck. "Loki," Thor murmured soothingly. "What you did may have not been the brightest of all things, but I care about you, sister. I will
are we suppose to do? None of us knows how to raise a child -- let alone two distressed, depressed, and emotionally unstable teenage boys!"
Taking a deep breath, Bruce nodded his head, looking up at the assassins. "Peter got hurt at school -- badly. We need you to stable yourself so Peter can get the correct attention that he needs. An ordinary hospital is out of the question, seeing he has superpowers, and that would draw
"We still need a plan." Clint spoke up, eyebrow raised as he took another sip of his coffee pot, bringing the liquid from the brim to the halfway point.
There in the elevator was Natasha, Clint, and a badly injured Peter Parker. Bruises and cuts littered his skin, both dried and fresh blood painting his body like war paint. "What the hell happened to you, Peter?" the hero whispered under his breath as he watched the screen with wide eyes.
through things. His parents died when he was around the age of five years old. Not a couple years later, his Uncle Ben was shot dead by an intruder. Now, Aunt May is...
, not the killer's. While you all are so busy trying to find Peter, Peter's trying to find the murderer himself. Meaning, he's running all over the city, in all cracks and corners, to find them. But, we won't see that pretty spandex-clad ass of his until he knows who the killer is. Yanno?"
Rolling his eyes, Stark looked the boy up and down, before beginning to talk. “So, Peter, I did a background check,”
Bruce shyly smiled, a blush forming on his cheeks as he was still in his ridiculously, half torn Black Widow styled lingerie that was torn near the buttocks and breasts padding. Clint, however, was almost in tears of laughter as he sat on the bench in but a pair of boxer briefs and socks.
Boiling brown sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest, orange juice and orange zest together in a quite large saucepan, Peter then reduced the heat. Once it had simmered down, the boy stirred in he vanilla extract. Letting that sit for a couple of minutes, Peter walked over to the cabinets and pulled out a glass bowl. Going to the fridge and pulling out the fruits, Parker began to layer the fruits in this order; pineapple, strawberry, kiwi, bananas, oranges, grapes, and, finally, blueberries. Checking the time, Peter walked over and grabbed the sauce, pouring it over the fruits. Placing the now finished dish into the cool refrigerator, Peter then grabbed the mincemeat pie. Making the pie crusts, Parker then poured the meat into the crust, placing strips of dough on top of it all. Going back to the second oven that Tony had paid for, seeing that one person would want one thing and the other would want something else, resulting in one of them having to wait for the oven to reopen once more. Putting the pie into the oven, Peter sighed and stiffled a yawn. All this baking was wearing him out. Both Wanda and Natasha seemed to agree.
Once Aunt May packed Peter’s clothes, she left the room, letting the young boy handle the rest. Bending down and pulling out a small black bag from under the bed, he unzipped it, and walked to the bathroom.
Twenty four minutes and three seconds later and Ned was walking into the tower, his worn down backpack in his hand. His feet dragged on the ground as he walked, constantly tugging at his long sleeve shirt. His eyes were still blurry and the tear tracks on his cheeks weren't fading any time soon, and neither was his tears. Pushing the correct button in the lift, Ned's hand's continued to shake. He could barely hold his satchel.
The young boy didn't calm down though. Tony saw this too. Going against all the things his brain was telling him, he slowly wrapped his hand around Peter's fragile body. At first, the younger froze from the sudden contact, but slowly he relaxed. More tears fell down his body as he leaned into Stark.
Rhodes grumbled under his breath. "I'm pretty sure he gave himself that name if we're being honest."
The team, plus Deadpool and Loki, have been trying to figure out where their little spider could have possibly disappeared to, but every time that they get one-eighth of a lead, something comes along and destroys it. Thus, they're always back to square one.
“Anyway,” Tony cleared his throat while looking out the window, “We’re here.” he said with the best smile he could muster up.
Outrage for Flash, for the goddamn woman behind the counter, all the bullying, the teachers not helping, and even The Avengers -- especially Tony Stark.
Pulling at his sleeve, he groaned softly. Why was he getting so upset about this? It's just a stupid house, isn't it?
“It is a limo, Mr. Stark. Things like these grab peoples attention, especially when it happens to be in our neighborhood.” Peter basically whispered, pulling his hoodie, that he decided to put on last moment, over his head to where nobody would recognize him.
‘Only a couple of more hundred dollars.’ he thought, thinking back to the jar filled with extra dollars and pennies for a chest reduction surgery.
"Holy shit, that's --- that's Peter!" he exclaimed as the two rushed into the room and sat the young teenage superhero onto the examining table. Once he was out of their arms, Barton rushed to close the door, locking it for extra manners, while Natasha ran a hand through her wavy, short hair.
Laughing, Wade pulled away to look down at the messy haired, blue eyed human perfection. "How about we eat some food, yeah?"
A moment of rustling could be heard, as well a sob, and the next thing he knew, warm arms were being wrapped around his shoulders. That someone pulled him to their chest and hugged them tightly.
“Come on, Peter.” Stark said with a gruff voice, pushing off the frame and walking towards the limo outside, which grabbed attention of some people.
Breathing now back to normal, he pushed himself off the door and walked towards his bathroom. Turning on the light, he closed the door behind him and stepped in front of the big mirror.
Once more, Natasha nodded her head. "If it will help Peter heal and get the treatment he needs, then yes -- anything."
Taking his soldier's hand, he dragged Steve to the desk hurriedly. "Now, let's go look at your present!" If anyone else saw this exchange, they would think that Tony was more of a energetic puppy who just took a slurp of his owner's coffee. But to Steve, it was almost normal. "Close your eyes!"
Parker sniffed, trying his best to blink away tears. "W-who changed my cl-clothes..? A-And where's my binder?" Natasha winced visibly.
Hawkeye smiled as he walked over towards the bed and sat down next to her, revealing a box that was behind his back. "Happy Valentine's Day, honey."
"About what?" a familiar male voice commented as he started to walk towards the elevator. The trio's eyes widened.
A loud noise came from overhead as the door to the vents swung open, a  tumbling Clint falling from the ceiling and onto the hardwood flooring behind Steve and Tony. Peaking his head from behind the couch, he looked towards the group. "Did someone say movie?"
Parker couldn't handle this, he couldn't handle the confrontation. Not now, anyways. Hands shaking, he backed up and took off towards his room, dropping something along the way, but he wasn't too concerned about it. Once to his room, he slammed the door shut, the sound echoing throughout the hallways of the large building.
"No ands, ifs, or buts about it." she said sternly. "You can always where your hoodie, seeing it being cool the past week, and inside the tower." Helping the young hero off the counter, she helped him maneuver his hoodie over himself once more. Putting away the things, she walked back over towards the actual bedroom. Noticing the time, it war around 9 at night. For Peter, it was a bit early to go to bed, but with all the new things happening to him lately, he could sure use the goodnight's rest.
The next thing he knew, both Peter and Ned were on the floor, arms wrapped around each other so tight as they cried and mourned their friend together.
Soon, the food arrived. Wade jumped up faster than an Olympic athlete, and Thor was silently excited. Tony had basically bought the restaurants food supply, seeing there was so many. But, again, Tony did prepare  ahead of time, seeing that they did have a people with appetites like crazy.
"And you promise you won't tell anyone, either?" Peter then asked, which earned another head shake from Deadpool.
"We have Tony's credit card, Peter. Now, where do you want to go?" she asked again with a slight smile. Peter thought for a moment, his eyes scanning over the copious amounts of stores. Finally, his eyes landed on one that looked quite interesting.
Sighing, the billionaire turned back towards Natasha, Loki, and Bruce. "This isn't going to work. Loki
"STARK," Natasha growled, sending a shiver down Tony's spine. "I'm not saying that Leeds had any right to say what he said, but he is grieving, and so is Peter. Ned took out his anger and frustration on the first person he saw, which happened to be Peter. If you were there, it would've been you, the same for any other person in this fucking room. They were both ticking time bombs and it was only a matter of time before one of them went off. Sure, Ned had a helping hand in Parker's disappearance, but it wasn't completely his fault."
." Blushing a light tent of pink, the young boy nodded and made his way to the counter, pulling up a chair besides Sam -- he would
After what seemed like forever, their coach finally walked inside, along side Flash. "Alright, line up!" Coach Jacoby shouted, clapping his hands as the students jogged to the line that went around the gymnasium. Stepping in front of his students, with Flash by his side, Coach Jacoby clapped his hands. "As you may not know, my name's Coach Jacoby and I'll be your gym teacher this year. And each year, I like to pick one of the best gym students to help me and stay by my side."
Peter's heart dropped even more. "Please," he whispered out, his heart lurching up his chest and into his throat, causing his voice to crack. Ainsley only shook her head, her frown deepening.
Wade's head snapped towards the goddess. "Yep! Annnd you must be Lady Loki. The readers quite enjoy you, not gonna lie." The Avengers raised a confused eyebrow. "Annnywho, how are we going to find Peter? Any ideas?"
Peter sighed, running a hand through his hair as he picked up at his partner by the back of his shirt, dragging him up. "Come on, Wade, work with me here." Wade shook his head, his lower lip stuck out.
Sneaking into his apartment, Wade slowly creaked the front door open, careful not to activate Petey's superhearing.
Pulling the mask onto his face, Spider-Man opened his bedroom window. Gulping, Peter looked down at the ground, he was pretty high up.
Shaking her head, Natasha chuckled, rolling her eyes. "Don't worry about it." she reassured once more. Reaching into the back pocket of her pants, she pulled out a black card. Holding it between her fingers, she smiled evilly. "That's why we have this."
Exactly four guns, two pocket knives, two katanas, and one dagger later, Wade sat criss-cross on the floor. Leaning on the palms of his hands, he stared up at the heroes sitting in front of him on the furniture -- all except Loki, of course, who was standing near her brother to the side.
"Babe," the older male called. "Babe, babe, babe, they have pretzels," he smiled widely, his stomach growling quite loudly. "They have motherfucking
A sleepy smile appeared on the young male's face as he quietly scooted towards the man. Sitting beside him, he curled into the other's side, his hands gripping the loose cotton of his shirt. Snapping his fingers, Loki summoned a blanket -- but not one from Peter's bed.
"So," Steve spoke, looking over his shoulder from where he was occupying the stove top, "School starts up for the year on Monday, you ready to go back?"
Peter's attention immediately switched to her. Half of her body was a soft, pale, holding all the features of the most beautiful woman, while the other half was rotting and skeletal bones growing on the outside of her body. Long, blonde hair fell over her shoulders, her one blue eye shining brilliantly in the nonexistent light. "And I and Hel, the Goddess of Death." she spoke, her voice also gentle. It sent shivers down Peter's spine.
"Well, first time for everything." Natasha smiled down at him. With that, the two made their way to the cream coloured store. Up above the entrance, in big bold letters, the name of the store was printed out.
Hiding his smile, Steve took in another bite of his cereal, mentally recalling the memories of last night.
okay? I made them swear to it -- and they don't think differently of you, either. They still love you and consider you family."
Peter's been searching for exactly three and a half days. His stomach felt like it was trying to eat itself, and because of his fast metabolism, it probably was. But that was the least of his worries right now.
"What is it?" Peter asked as he looked up towards his mentor. Tony only pressed his lips into a thin line, eyes glossing over ever-so-slightly. "Mr Stark, tell me what's going on!" Peter shouted after a moment, a horrible, gut-wrenching feeling in the bottom of his stomach. The hero sighed.
Hope you enjoyed the chapter! I would like to say that I tried my best to do my research on this subject, but there is only so much facts and myths out there. Therefore, I may have left something out, or put something extra in. If you know for a fact about any of the realms, or people, and you know something is off/wrong, then please, let me know and I will be happy to fix it. Other than that, hope you enjoyed the chapter!
Lady Loki raised an eyebrow. "You're an intriguing mortal, Edward Leeds. Do note that," she spoke as she stepped forwards. Reaching out, she placed two single fingers on the teenager's forehead. Ned gasped softly as the memories began to resurface.
Tears tracked down his face as he gasped for air once more, his body shaking as he did so. "In and out, in and out," her voice reminded him. Following instructions, Peter tried to breathe once more.
Taking off his mask, the merc looked around his workstation. Glancing over at the clock, he took in a sharp breath of air.
I just wanted to say thank you for all your support. I've tried my best to reply to all the comments, but I've gotten so many (which was a shocker for me for some reason) that it's hard to reply to all.
Wanda sighed, sitting down in the chair Romanoff was sitting in previously. "I may not be as good at detecting lies like Natasha is, but I can tell when someone is lying majorly." Peter sighed, causing the female to frown deeply. "You can tell me, Peter.." she whispered softly.
His outer wardrobe shifted to. His once dark green tunic and black trousers shifted into a long, medieval type dress robe, the colour still the same. "And two," Loki spoke up once more, "Wade is Peter's boyfriend. Why have you not heard of this?"
"I am not the man I was back then." he defended himself. "May I sit?" Glancing from the place next to him, and then back at the god, Peter nodded his head, moving to where he wasn't flat with the wall behind him. "Thank you," Loki spoke after a moment.
"Then don't. But if you don't, and the kid can't get proper help, everything is going to spiral out of control." Sam spoke, his voice firm. He knows what he's talking about too. He's seen it happen with his very own eyes.
Seeing Steve couldn't process booze, Peter was underage, and Thor and Loki would have to have gallons of the stuff, only a select few drank a beer, those being; Clint, Rhodey, Sam, Nat, and, suprisingly, Aunt May. Peter's eyebrows shot up at the sight; he's never seen his aunt drink alcohol before. This, to say the least, was going to be interesting..
yellow commented inside of his head. Wade's eyes nearly bulged out of his head. Clearing his throat, he pointed over his shoulder to the hallway behind him. "Oh, um, the bathroom is the door on the right, just so you, uh, know.." Peter, once more, smiled thinly, nodded his head, and set out for the door on the right.
He was currently sitting on his bed, his back against the headboard. His knees were pulled up to his chest, his two-sizes-too-large shirt swallowing his thin body. He ran a hand through his untamed hair, wincing as his fingers got caught in a small knot. "You know that's not what I mean." Loki chided, a stern look on his face. He was trying (key word:
