A bunch of warnings came on the screen about swearing and being offensive and to leave if you didn’t want to participate in the yelling, etc. Dean laughed, this was going to be interesting. After that finished a lady came onto the stage.
“Okay, Mr. Winchester, Dr. Novak will be in with you shortly,” the pretty blonde nurse told him before closing the curtains.
Dean pulled into the parking lot of his bakery and turned off his car. He should have known that Cas wouldn’t forgive him. He was an idiot.  As much as Dean wanted to just go upstairs and drink, he knew he couldn’t.
Anna took a bite of the cake, letting out a pleased sound. “This is so good, Dean!” Cas nodded as well with a small smile.
When he felt the weight lift, Dean thought that was the end of it, but then he felt someone else sit on him. He saw the heels and knew that it was Cas who was straddling his back. And then he felt him thrusting against it. Holy shit. Dean didn’t think he had ever gotten hard so fast in his life. As quick as it had started it was over, and Dean was helped up back to his seat.
We nod and set off. We obviously use my car because we're not going to walk through the city or even teleport the Winchester brothers. And it just so happens that every dog has this mark.
. That way we could see if there's something going on in that park. This is the match between Karen and Brandon.
. It was only written to make kids fantasize about Prince Charming! And then frankly, their age story is completely stupid: time doesn't go the same in their respective worlds!
Each owner told us that their dog came from an adoption centre. That's definitely where we need to go. It takes us an hour to find the centre in question, which is a five-hour drive from where we are.
Castiel usually sits in the back of the Impala, and he had tried to communicate with Dean with his real voice after getting him out of Hell. Sometimes I think that Sam and I had a real chance to find songs with lyrics that matched as well!
I can't stop smiling. Castiel understood, after all we weren't subtle at all. At no point did Sam and I try to deny our plan.
How in ten minutes did they go from "I don't even dare to look at you" to "I devour you with my eyes"?! There is nothing logical about them!
My gaze wanders over Sam's arms as he takes out the day's CD. Has Sam always been this strong? His arms, they are so... muscular, powerful?
I grab the packaging to throw away and get up to take it to the bin. This song has the talent to make me sad and when I think of those two idiots it's even worse. I remember Dean's distress when he found out that Raphael had killed Cas while he was facing Lilith. Then when he thought he'd lost everyone when Cas has been exploded by Lucifer and after that Sam ended up in the cage with Lucifer and Michael.
“I have been divorced for 2 years and I have him in alternate custody every other week. And so much the better ... If her mother had had sole custody I would have suffered too much... She is my world !” resumed Castiel, taking a sip of his Columbus.
Dean felt cheated and hurt. He pursed his lips and gave Castiel an aggressive look. He clenched his fist.
“Castiel has a lot of qualities. He's trying to do the best he can. He’s a beautiful person, a rare person. "
Castiel had been anxious ever since he hung up. He was tapping nervously on the door. Dean wanted to ask him what was going on but since he didn't like being asked questions, he didn't feel legitimate to ask others.
"Mr. Winchester, I'm going to speed up really down that straight.This time you'll have to hold on to me. "
He knelt down and took her in his arms. Dean understood that the famous Jackie was in fact just Castiel's daughter. He smiled and found himself silly that he thought it was his wife.
Also note that Ajaccio is about 2h from the Scala di Santa Regina. But for simplicity I brought it closer.
"Yes Dean Winchester, I made you a playlist that we will listen to during the journey ! I know better rather than make a damn cake !" replied the man with black ebony hair.
Dean still surprised Castiel. He looked rough and yet he knew how to be complacent. Jackie got into the back of the vehicle excitedly. Before going back up, Castiel looked at Dean and said a barely audible "thank you".
"It's a glittering glaze that will enhance your cake! Well, normally it should be used on a frozen cake beforehand but you can try it on a cake that has cooled well. "
He felt a hand rest on his shoulder. He opened his eyes and saw that Castiel looked at him tenderly.
Dean looked so vulnerable right now, he kept staring at the bike. Castiel walked over and said softly to him
Sam was watching the stars, comfortably seated in his deckchair, a glass of white Muscatellu in his hand. Corsica was a good place to observe the stars because the light pollution was low. He reveled in his delicate flavored drink as he listened to Eileen talk on the phone. She had stayed in the kitchen.
I have never ridden a motorcycle, I knew absolutely nothing about it, I did research both in terms of the best equipment and the handling to adopt. Especially in "duo". I learned a lot of things ! I hope I have transcribed the data correctly !
All he knew was he was satisfied that Sam had made a success of his life. He had a comfortable life, his dream job and a caring wife. Although he still didn't understand why he and Eileen had gone to live in Corsica in a village in the heights. So far away.
Dean had been driving for a few minutes. He had passed the port of Ajaccio and was heading for the city center on Castiel's advice. The latter raved about the dashboard and upholstery of the Impala. He thought it was amazing that the car was so well maintained after so many years. Dean gently laughed, finding him childish.
"Alright, alright I stabilize the bike. Go for it !” said Castiel annoyed but obsessed above all by security
… that would have been even more disastrous… Make fun as much as you want !” he said, continuing to wipe the sponge on the island.
without exchanging a word all the way. Castiel stopped in the parking. Dean went downstairs. He turned his back to him. Castiel took off his helmet
Castiel looked up in amazement. He had understood that Dean had been withdrawn since their meeting. So he was pleased to see Dean expressing himself a little more as the day went on.
The shopping continued for a little while. Dean followed Castiel through the shelves. He was looking at the prices. He was suddenly offended.
"Damn ! She's our girl ! You have to keep her out of our stories. You have to put his well-being before everything else! "
"No, I'm going to go back, I'll let you enjoy your family reunion !" Castiel replied looking at Dean with melancholy.
"No worries ! It’s important not to counterbalance because it dangerously unbalances the trajectory of the motorcycle. Just as we must not accentuate the curve. Don't overdo the movement, it won't help me ... just let yourself be carried away by the movement. Do not be afraid the motorbike will not fall. "
Dean got off the Harley first. He took off his helmet and took the opportunity to stretch. Castiel handed him a bottle of water.
The two budding pastry chefs soaked the gelatin in a large bowl of cold water. Then they added water, sugar and glucose to a saucepan and brought it to a boil.
half boots completed the outfit. He swallowed. He felt an electric shock run through his body until it landed in his pants. He inhaled and crouched down towards his motorcycle. It was necessary for him to quickly lower the pressure...
Castiel started his Harley Davidson. Dean was impressed by the roar of the craft. The pilot began to drive slowly, without strong acceleration or strong braking. He approached the first turns in a very flexible way to show the behavior of the motorcycle to his passenger. Dean had relaxed and was starting to enjoy the trip.
below. Dean observed this breathtaking landscape for a moment while respecting the safety instructions transmitted by Castiel. He now understood the infatuation of the experienced rider. He especially understood the supposed words of this one which had prevented him from taking this road with his impaling impala. The road was not only twisty and broken, but it was also extremely narrow. He smiled and for a moment imagined him and Baby trudging along the path. This is what would have happened if he hadn't come across Castiel by chance. A happy coincidence when you think about it. He hugged Castiel a little tighter at the thought.
"The plan was to bake you a cake and bring it back to you..." Castiel said while running his sponge over the counter.
"It's all right Dean, you've had a bit of a drink and you're exhausted, you can stay and sleep here!" said Castiel softly
"Yes ... yes I like him a lot ! " he said embarrassed "If you want to know everything, he makes me feel things that I haven't felt for a very long time... "
There was silence. Then the two men burst out laughing under the disbelieving eye of the little girl.
Dean and Jackie were focused. Jackie counted the drops, Dean mixed the preparation then the little girl tasted as she went. Castiel watched them tenderly. He liked the pedagogy that Dean adopted towards his daughter.
He took a closer look at the clothes he had just retrieved the piece of paper from and found that it was his motorcycle gear. He swallowed and frowned. Was he ready ? Was it about time ? He hesitated for a moment before finally grabbing the clothes and pulling them on.
Dean and Jackie continued to examine the impala in the heat. The sun's rays tended to hit hard at midday.
He prepared himself carefully by putting on the equipment bought on Castiel's advice, finishing with his favorite piece: the DEAN CE leather jacket. His phone rang. It was a message from Castiel.
Dean was waiting at a red light. He looked at the airtight box containing the piece of cake on the passenger seat and smiled.
Castiel was stunned. He had listened intently to Dean's story. He had never imagined that the young man had experienced such a story. He understood the latter's anger better that very morning when he asked him to trust him. It was obvious that since this story he no longer trusted anyone.
"I don't know how to ride a motorbike, Castiel ! I mean, I know I'm not gonna drive it, but I don't know how to be a good passenger ! “
that had been entering his ears for a few moments. He was thinking how well the music the blue-eyed man chose fit perfectly with their journey. However, he still couldn't understand why Castiel got so ecstatic when he talked about the Scala Di Santa Regina. He described it as the eighth wonder of the world. But for now, the landscape was constant: the same forest and the same path as before. It was very beautiful and invigorating, but there was absolutely nothing transcendent about it. It was then that Castiel took a sharp turn that he mastered to perfection. And it was out of it that, as if it had heard him, the haunting Scala Di Santa Regina offered itself to Dean.

"I'm just thinking about him... I'm going to take a small and light rental car. I will go up alone to join him !” he said continuing on his way
Dean immediately felt more relaxed. He smiles. He wondered if that was what it was to have a friend ? A person to count on ? A person who knows how to comfort ? The fear of abandonment and rejection had traumatized him so much that he had missed such a sense of well-being the whole time.
Of course I trusted him, of course I believed him…" he snorted "and all that why ? To leave like a coward and abandon us… ”
As soon as he entered, the smell of rubber tingled his nose. The spokes unfolded in front of him with all kinds of equipment: helmets, jackets, boots, gloves ... the entire range for any self-respecting biker. In the distance was the workshop where a few mechanics were busy. Dean was not familiar with this environment. He scratched his forehead. A young employee approached him
Castiel understood that Dean was fierce and that he probably wouldn't accept his offer. But he still took the risk of asking him. Against all expectations Dean agreed. Castiel couldn't believe it.
"Trust you ?? We hardly know each other and you would like me to place my trust in you? " he shouted
Dean frowned. Castiel rushed out of the office and glared at Raffaele. The latter brushed against him and whispered in his ear
Dean was watching the sky. He felt so good. He hadn't felt such fullness for so long. He took a deep breath.
“I mean, you know how to ride a motorcycle, you know vintage cars, you are the boss of your own business, you are a tourist guide ! "
"No" he said opening his eyes again "I just wonder, how many points in common do we have, dear Novak family !? "
Dean was still with his back when the bike pulled away. Tears of rage and despair rolled down her cheeks. He was overwhelmed by Castiel's words.
Immaculate by the sun, the magnificent green valley planted with junipers and pines stood before him. The road, cut into the mountainside made up of granite rocks, meandered along the valley, following the relief drawn by the river
“Jackie, Mr. Winchester is on vacation. He probably has other things to do!” said Castiel affectionately.
Dean nodded understanding the instructions. Castiel had his feet anchored to the ground, he applied the front brake to block the front wheel.
"Will I pick you up if that's okay with you ? I just have to get your address and your phone number, it will be easier for our exchanges ! Without wanting to impose anything on you !” he said embarrassed
"Great ! Pay attention to the position of your feet, they should not interfere with me. Remember to always put them correctly on the footrests! "
"How ... How can two beings who have loved each other so much behave like this today ?” he said with a sigh "What the hell happened to you?"
He saw that Dean and Sam were standing arm in arm and walking together towards the entrance of the house. He put on his helmet with the visor up and glanced at Dean one last time, hoping to meet his deep green gaze one last time. And it was, Dean stared at him intently and smiled tenderly at him before rushing into his brother's house. Heat spread through Castiel's body, electrifying him completely. He felt an intense joy which gave him the necessary impetus to return to Ajaccio.
Water was streaming over his delicate skin. He took advantage of this moment of serenity to clear his head and relax completely. When he was done, he turned off the water and got out of the shower, being careful not to slip. He wrapped the thick cotton towel around his waist and wiped his face with the second. He then noticed that a post-it was on some things on a bamboo bench. He walked over and grabbed him
Dean nodded. He put his hand on the pilot's left shoulder. Castiel's pulse quickly raced. He closed his eyes and took a deep breath to calm himself down while Dean dutifully followed the directions given earlier. He was now seated but had left a gap between him and the rider. The latter called him to order.
“I don't understand… You bake when you are incompatible ! Are you masochistic or something ?” Dean quipped.
Dean frowned and drunk with anger raised his fist in Castiel's direction. The latter narrowly avoided him.
She guided the two men to a table next to a large open window overlooking the cafe's kitchen. Dean sat down on the bench decorated with cushions of various styles and Castiel sat down on the chair.
Decidedly Castiel intrigued Dean. Usually the vendors he dated would always try to trick him as soon as they knew he could afford to pay. But not him.
After a few kilometers Castiel took advantage of one of the few viewpoints that crisscrossed the road to shift down and gradually come to a stop. He knew very well that the passenger seat was not the most comfortable and that Dean would end up feeling very tired and having some stiffness.
He gently cleaned Dean's forehead. His breathing quickened. He had never been so close to the young man as he is now. He lingered on her remarkable face: her tanned complexion, her piercing gaze and her sensual mouth. Never had he been so disturbed by a man. Dean on his side did not move. He found himself plunging into the deep blue of Castiel's eyes. The timer ringing suddenly ends this disturbing exchange.
Castiel had understood, through the testimony of the young man the day before, how much Sam was his pillar and his pride. He knew seeing him again would do him great good and soothe him. The evening they had spent had given him the necessary impetus to attempt this project. After he finished inspecting his Harley, he put Dean's things in the storage saddlebags on the back of his bike. How lucky Dean has packed his package and gear in his impala. Castiel had been able to recover it by stealing the keys to the Chevrolet for a few minutes from its owner's jacket, which remained hanging on the coat rack.
"Yes ... I understood that you don't want to reveal yourself and I respect that, I don't want to make you uncomfortable. So here is my question: what is your favorite song from this band? "
Castiel looked disapprovingly. He went behind the counter to go into the office. He took a seat in the chair and poured himself a coffee. He watched the clock. 9:00. He inhaled and tasted his drink.
Oops sorry for the wait ... I got back to work so it was a little harder to deliver the chapters faster !
Castiel couldn't believe it. Dean had sacrificed himself so that his brother could have happy days and that was all that mattered to him.
Dean nodded and looked at the scenery again to take in it. It was then that the two men heard hooves banging against the rock and barking below. Castiel rushed enthusiastically to the parapet and leaned down a little noticing that a rider was making his way with his two donkeys and three dogs.
was it written on it. He did so and then, once the water temperature was to his liking, stepped into the walk-in shower.
"It was with it that I hiked the Scala di Santa Regina yesterday ! It’s with it that I have been traveling the roads for several years ! I'm sure you understand me ! "
She understood that Dean wanted, above all, to discuss. She took him inside the cafe and walked over to the counter. Dean looked around, the interior was baroque in style. A fireplace, on which many pictures were arranged, dominated the room. Dean grabbed a frame with a picture of Castiel, Rowena and Jackie. Rowena placed a beer and a slice of pie on the counter.
"Ok... Last thing, when braking, always use the rear grip to hold your body back so you don't bump into me!"
Dean smiled and put on the helmet. He wondered where Castiel could come up with so many ideas to surprise him. No one had ever done so much for him. Castiel got on his motorbike and put on his helmet, which he adjusted. Then he launched the first sound of his playlist via his intercom.
"One thing I can at least know about you, Mr. Winchester, is that you like music. And more particularly rock ! "
“I have to stabilize the bike. This is why you should never go up or down unexpectedly ! This is really very important ! "
“In fact it's not that I don't know, it's that the pastry and I don't get along at all… a whole eggshell in the preparation, it's me, salt instead of sugar, me again, even the utensils break down… when they don't melt in the dough… ” said Castiel upset. He pointed at a scar on the back of his wrist and continued "The burn you see there is not a heroic act ... just the cake that burns and me putting out the start of the fire ..." he sighed "Do you want more examples ? "
"Wait for the deal, it's a ride in my Chevrolet, not answering an interrogation…" Dean replied grumpily as he continued to watch the road.
They had passed the citadel and were now walking along the coast. Palm trees adorned the road, the sea water was turquoise blue, and the sun sparkled in the sky. What a spectacular sight.
"I brought ..." Dean started moving towards the trunk of his impala "I brought some booze and barbecue !” he said proudly showing his food. A pack of Columbus beer and meat to be broiled was placed in the trunk.
"Is that why you took so long to see Sam ? Because he reminds you of that painful time in your life? "
After this fabulous expedition, they arrived at the end of the parade and crossed the small village of Corscia before quietly reaching Porto.
Then he left the terrace and walked back to his impala, which had been left in a parking lot higher up. Castiel and Rowena watched him walk away.
Dean took a deep breath and wrapped his arms around Castiel a little more. The feeling of well-being he had been feeling since the start of the morning intensified instantly. When Castiel felt Dean's embrace, he accelerated as if he had received some exhilarating stimulation. The two men were in perfect synergy and that is what made this getaway extraordinary.
Castiel, who until then had been stargazing as well, widened his eyes at Dean's words. He couldn't believe the latter was about to open up. That he felt confident enough to relate what was gnawing at him so much. Castiel said nothing and let him continue.
Castiel blushes. He was happy to know Dean at peace. And even more moved to know that he had something to do with it. He put a hand on his shoulder.
For this chapter you can listen to A-Ha's “Take on Me” acoustic version: https://youtu.be/-xKM3mGt2pE
Because in reality Castiel understood very well that he was falling in love with Dean. In fact, the song
"Take care of yourself !” he said before hitting the road again. He was obviously shaken by not seeing Dean anymore.
Dean looked at him, impressed by so much knowledge and amused by his effervescence. One of the dogs, a lagging border collie, approached him and looked for his contact. The young man crouched down and stroked it for a moment.
"Let's get the cake out !" Rowena said as she entered the kitchen before noticing the unsettling proximity of the two men.
The little girl did so dragging her feet before rushing into the house. Castiel was now looking at Luna with a cold gaze and a contracted face. Since their divorce, long and difficult, they spoke little to each other. Nevertheless, Castiel owed it to her for Jackie's well-being. Above all, he didn't want anything to blame himself or anything to owe to his ex-wife.
"Yes Dean Winchester, I wanted to bake you a cake ! Yes… a failed cake ! You know like the one fairies make for Aurora in
He handed the passenger helmet to Dean. It was closed but he grabbed the helmet anyway. He settled in without saying a word. The Harley Davidson took off with a bang, leaving the Route des Sanguinaires behind.
Rather moved and excited to present this chapter to you !!! In fact, it was the first one I thought of when I came up with the idea for this fic. And yet it arrives rather far !! I created the story around that moment that I had in mind from the start! I find it to be true to what I imagined. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.
It was a text from Dean. Sam smiled. He realized how much he missed his brother. It had been far too long since they had seen each other physically. He began to write an answer...
“We were pretty happy before that… but then my dad got drunk. Every night he drank to forget about, until he forget Sam and me. I must have learned to cope so early on. But I wanted Sam to be less aware of it all. I wanted to protect him at all costs… " he swallowed "I still loved my father despite everything, despite the fact that he looked like a wreck, despite the fact that I had to fight for him to eat or washes, to make the hearth stand on my shoulders so small… I did everything so that he does not abandon us… " his voice derailed slightly, his eyes misted up, he nodded and smiled "Didn't work since he left… He made me believe that everything was going to be okay. I still remember his words
He then texted Sam asking if he was sitting comfortably to looking at the stars. Contemplating the constellations in an interposed way had become their little habit. The only habit Dean didn't mind.
Dean then let go of the rear handle and finally put his arms around Castiel's waist. A fiery heat invades the biker. His heart began to beat faster than it should, and his face set ablaze. He couldn't believe it, but he did manage to pierce Dean Winchester's titanium alloy. He quickly came to his senses because, for the moment, only the route and the conduct were to be his main preoccupations. He then accelerated to follow the road that plunged into the heights.
"Damn Dean, hang in there!" said Castiel dryly. It was the first time, since they had known each other, that he had called her by his first name.
Jackie stood at the back of the impala. She amused stroking the warm leather of the bench. Dean had restarted the engine.
Castiel rushed out of the car when they saw them. He approached the little girl. Dean was also taken down but had stayed near his Impala.
"I put on too much sugar, I was wrong !! " she said pointing to her salad bowl on the central island.
That evening Dean called Eileen from her hotel room to explain that he wasn't going up right away. The latter had fun "I told you, however, that you could not ride with your impala but you wanted to play smart!" Dean rolled his eyes.
Castiel was tense and had his face closed. Dean was watching him. He understood how the situation infuriated and hurt him.
Castiel took advantage of the fact that no one was following him to stop at the entrance sign to the Scala Di Santa Regina trail.
Castiel felt Dean's deeper embrace. The heat he had felt since the start of their escapade intensified significantly. Obviously Dean enjoyed the scenery and the ride. Unfortunately he couldn't dwell on his emotions. Above all, he had to be focused on the road because he was responsible for their safety. He approached a bend to the sound of
Dean smiles. Was it a coincidence that the jacket Castiel had chosen for him bore his name when he had not given it ?
"What was the plan then ?” Dean asked grabbing a trash can and starting to throw away the eggshells.
Castiel was flabbergasted. Not only was he hearing the young man's name for the first time, but he had just realized that he had chosen the jacket model bearing his name. He smiles back at Dean.
"I’m used to it ! And then I have to go! In any case, to climb up there: the motorbike will be your best ally ! "
For all these years he had tried above all to bury his father's betrayal. The word trust had become synonymous with deception for him. Since that event he had built such a wall around himself that no one, except Sam, had yet managed to breaking down it.
Dean was staring at the ebony haired man. He didn't like to get tied up because the only experiences he'd had were running into people who were bland, deceitful, and far too self-centered. But Castiel was quite the opposite. Dean felt he wanted to put his daughter's happiness ahead of his own. He seemed sincere, honest and straightforward. And that fundamentally destabilized him.
Luna sighed, got into her car without saying a word and left the Novak residence. Castiel seemed relieved. He turned to Dean
Dean had returned to the commune of Ajaccio. He was waiting at a red light. There were quite a few people. He held in his fingers the map of the garage that the mysterious biker had recommended to him. Suddenly he heard a voice calling out to him
He thought back to the Chevrolet Impala he'd seen the day before. He was a fan of beautiful cars and he never saw this kind of collector's item around. He had taken advantage of the vehicle being parked to go and admire it more closely. The impala was flawless. He had told himself that his owner had to be a careful person. He had just noticed that the latter was leaning over the glove box. Castiel had tapped delicately on the body to call out to him. The driver stood up in panic and turned to face him. Castiel was then captivated by his green eyes with celadon reflections and his freckles that pigmented his singular face.
"It's been 5 years since we last saw each other ... He doesn't know. I surprise him !” Dean continued
Castiel braked gradually before coming to a complete stop. The road was outlined in front of the two men.
"Here: the owner of this garage knows the area and this road like the back of his hand. He offers motorcycle rides. Whatever you have to do, postpone. Don't be a stupid tourist to risk your life or that of your car! "
He ended up texting his guest telling them he was waiting for him outside. He was waiting now and wondering if the door was going to open eventually. He was especially wondering if Dean would wear his biker outfit. The young man had of course the right not to accept his proposal. But Castiel dreamed above all of spending this special moment with him. He would be so saddened if Dean refused or worse, resented him for attempting such a folly. The minutes seemed to go on forever, giving Castiel time to imagine the worst possible scenarios. He patted spasmodically on the helmet he held in his hands. When suddenly the door opened. He straightened up. He then noticed that Dean had put on his equipment and put an end to his ordeal. He and Dean were going to share a moment together. This idea made him smile like never before...
Dean loved nice cars since he was little. His passion had taken hold of him when he was a child watching with his mother the adventures of Mickael Knight and his car KITT. This Pontiac Firebird already made him dream. He told himself that one day he would buy a vintage car. He remembered his mother, then pregnant with Sam, who called him cheerfully and consistently as soon as the credits of the soap opera hit. They were both making themselves comfortable on the sofa and enjoying the adventures of Knight Rider. It was the good old days, cloudless bliss on the horizon, like when the sun comes to warm your skin and your heart. It was long before Mary Winchester died of illness and trouble began. Dean had always promised him, despite his young age, that he would buy her a car; although Mary was perfectly satisfied with her Ford Capri. But she loved seeing her playful son more than anything. At that time they were having fun looking for the car that would best suit their future escapades. For this they regularly analyzed specialized magazines. It had become their special moment. They had spotted a Ford Mustang Coupe 65. A real gem. Dean had posted the poster in his bedroom. But both were not satisfied yet, the little spark was missing. For Dean's 8th birthday, Mary and John gave him a ticket to the auto show. The four of them had made the trip to Paris. Dean didn't know yet that this day was going to be the last best day of his life for a long time. But for now the laughter, the fascination and the magic of the moment still mingled with recklessness. Some dealers were interviewed by national TVs. The exhibition was huge and there were a lot of people. Above all, you shouldn't get lost. Dean didn't know where to turn. The Winchester family made their way between the stands. And it was finally, after months of research, that Dean saw it. The perfect car, the car that would suit her future adventures admirably. A 1967 Chevrolet Impala. It was it, it could only be it. With its black paint of very good quality and its pronounced curves, it was imposing and majestic. The sight of the automobile pierced his heart. The operator, a man in his 50s, was amused to see the little boy's eyes twinkle. He had left her his card and told her to come back when he was older and hopefully it would be waiting for him. Dean hadn't noticed that at the same time a crowd had gathered behind him and people were starting to panic. He had turned to warn his mother that he had finally found the right car. He was surprised to see the mass and pushed his way through it. He then discovered with horror that his mother was on the ground. In fact, Mary had been coughing regularly for months. She still observed with the same disgust that blood stained the handkerchief she held in her hands. Dean hadn't noticed a thing, of course his mother was doing everything to hide the disease that was eating her away. Tuberculosis swept away Mary Winchester shortly after the auto show. Dean had promised himself he would own the most wonderful car in honor of his mother who died far too soon. And it was at 25, when he had his earnings transferred to his account, that he called the car collector, whom he had met almost two decades earlier, to buy him his Chevrolet Impala. And it was with great amazement that Dean had learned that baby had indeed been waiting wisely all this time.
When I came out of my "sleep", or rather out of my state of meditation, Cas was clinging to me like a mould to his rock. His cheeks were wet from what I easily guessed to be tears and his hair was completely out of shape.
An eyebrow rises up on Dean's face, which casts a glance at Cas lying down. Dean has already called Cas "sunshine" as a joke, and we all know that you have to be extremely patient to put up with Dean.
Immediately after answering, the hunter grabs his bottle of water and takes a long sip before turning into a corner as manfully as possible.
A noise to my right brought me out of my contemplation and I turned around to see Dean rubbing his eyes in an attempt to remove the marks of sleep. When he turned in my direction, I motioned to him not to make a sound.
An hour later, our things were ready and in my car, which we all climb into. As before, Dean and Cas are in the back while Sam and I are in the front.
Let me explain the situation : Baby, Dean's precious car, was in the garage for six days to be repaired. Dean had been really angry, screaming that his Baby was going to spend 6 days in a dark garage and that she deserved better. He had even wanted to do the repairs himself, but the time it took to get the parts was longer than the time it took the garage to take care of the Impala.
I swallowed with difficulty, before putting my hand on Castiel's hand which is looking at me. There's a sadness in his eyes, it turns my stomach.
When Cas finally calmed down, he was so exhausted that I carried him to his bed and he quickly fell asleep, holding my arm firmly so that I could wrap him in a friendly comforting embrace. We would have been in Heaven or in a much larger room, I would have surrounded him with my wings.
I winked at him. When the brothers come back, they have a bag: some pie for Dean, a vitamin drink for Sam, the latter hands me a can of sweetened condensed milk - my big weakness - and I refrain from jumping on it, while Dean shows Cas some honey sweets he's brought back.
The angel got up and ran to the bathroom while I got up and made the bed before crashing at the table with the brothers. I grabbed my own breakfast which I warmed up and Cas's before I started my pancakes. The angel joined us a few minutes later with wet hair and dressed in a jogging suit and jumper.
It was settled. Dean and I will take Brandon's route, and Sam and Cas will take Karen's route. I'm not blind, if Dean asked to be with me it's obviously because he wants to talk to me about something. Or someone.
The early music was completely innocent. Then Little Things by One Direction started to sound in the car.
Castiel went from reassured to worried then terrified. I look at my old friend, waiting for his answer which comes after much hesitation.
We took a short break in a city so that the humans in the car could go to the toilet, as sweet drinks were obviously not great for long distances. Castiel and I stayed in the car waiting for them.
Running water through my hair, I try to stop myself from laughing too hard. A star? Cas would be able to get the sky for Dean! It would just be another thing on the list of all the things he would do for the hunter. And the worst part is, if he tried, I wouldn't even stop him.
After two songs without any innuendo, the last "listen to this to make you realize your feelings" song of the day began.
We are getting out of the city. Everyone is a bit tense, because the more time passes the more worrying the situation becomes. Why a dog? What's so special about him?
Dean and Castiel break eye contact to rest their gaze on the papers in front of us, their cheeks rosy. Sam types on his computer before turning to all of us.
And unfortunately for Dean, my car also means that I am the one who drives and chooses the music. And it was really falling apart because Sam and I, really getting tired of Dean and Castiel turning around without doing anything, had a plan. We put together all the recent love songs to make 6 playlists: one a day. And it started today.
I shake my head and look up at the ceiling while Cas gets up to go to the bathroom. He comes back in time for the next song.
. I took him under my wing, literally and figuratively. In a way I think I'm the closest thing to a big sister or a very, very close friend for him. I watched him grow up, discover the world and every time he wasn't doing well he would come to me.
When they finally talk about their feelings, put the words on it, the clouds will finally be lifted. And we will all be proud of them.
. Even though I don't feel ready to tell him how I feel yet, your little merry-go-round of songs helps me understand how Cas feels and... fuck, seeing him like that last night and this morning was awful.
I have no bloody idea when they unbuckled their belts, but the two morons found themselves on top of each other after a bad corner. The fact is that Cas is practically on Dean's lap, their faces a few centimeters away and
Sam really can't help but laugh this time when he sees Dean's red cheeks. This song... is really hot. It's a call to debauchery.
Sam laughed. He spends all his time forcing Dean to exercise and eat healthier. Well now Dean is going to have to run for an investigation and Sam seems to be enjoying it.
I'm going around the city to find a good motel, where we'll stop. It is almost 5 pm and the shelter - which we passed by - seemed to be closed. So we take a room with a double bed and two single beds, which is the only room available for four.
. Even less in front of you because Cas was afraid you would think we are more than what we really are.
Castiel didn't really understand why I wanted to buy him new clothes, but he finally gave in and we beamed into our motel room with two big bags of clothes each. My Chevrolet avalanche was not parked in front of the motel, so we were the first ones back.
The angel looks at the dog, thinking... before rushing towards the animal, which squeals sadly for the caresses Castiel gives it. As I play the police officer, I can't help but glance at him. And when Castiel comes back, he is disturbed.
. He thought he was going to bring something back to Cas to have a reason to be closer to him. Seeing Cas, he wanted to do something too?
I grab a towel and wrap myself up in it before drying off and putting on my night clothes. Once out, Sam takes my place in the bathroom and I crash on my bed. Dean rereads his notes on the case while Cas lies on his bed and listens to the music. From his position it looks like his eyes are closed but I know they are fixed on Dean.
Sam returned to sit down next to me. I am between Sam and Castiel, himself sitting next to Dean who is sitting next to Sam. We begin to sum up what we have found, the music in the background.
We are all meeting at 2pm to take stock of our clues. The four of us are gathered in a motel room and Sam happily holds up the cd cover showing the one marked "day 2".
And in Castiel's eyes I see that flicker of hope. I shake my head and grab my things after getting up. A little chat with Castiel is in order.
Castiel turns to Dean to say something, before finally closing his mouth and putting his hands on his papers. In fact, the more time passes, the more I feel sick to my stomach as I watch them do it.
“Dean?! Finally! I’ve been calling for twenty minutes!” Sam says quickly into the phone. He’s been sitting here for twenty minutes, staring where Cas once stood. “Dean?”
Dean shakes his head but he can’t speak. If he does, he’s going to fall apart again. “I..I can’t talk about it, Sam. Not right now.” Dean knows Sam is looking at him, wanting him to speak about it. But Dean can’t. “I’ll fall apart if I do,” Dean adds, and he feels Sam look away. Dean thinks he gets it.
“Hi, I’m Dean,” Dean finally greets the other boy one day. The boy tilts his head and shakes Dean’s outstretched hand.
A big part of Dean hopes they will reach the bunker and Cas will just be there waiting for him, waiting for them to come back and everything will be good again...but as they walk into the bunker, Dean can feel the silence.
“I mean it this time, Sam, you are banned from my kitchen. Every time you’re back there something like this happens!” Dean exclaimed.
He drove to the theater, and went inside to pick up his ticket. A lady walked up to him once he had it in hand..
“I mean he didn’t want to see me. He doesn’t want to talk to me, Sam. I screwed up, I lost him forever. It’s time to just move on.” Dean said as he washed his hands. He had orders to get to.
“Doc,” Dean interrupted with a small smirk, “you’re about to be up close and personal with my ass, you can call me Dean.”
“Yes, if that’s okay...or tea if you’re not a coffee drinker. I would like to get to know you better,” Cas said, placing his hand on top of Dean’s with a smile.
“Thanks,” Dean said with a smile as he put down the next slice. “Alright, this cake is just a simple vanilla cake with a raspberry filling along with the same Italian meringue buttercream.”
“We need you to come, everyone...they’re all gone Dean. The sigils didn’t work. All the people...they’re all gone,” Sam says and Dean can hear his brother sniffling, clearly upset.
can barely dance on his toes like he’s supposed to. Castiel tells him not to get upset because it can take trained ballerinas years to master the art of pointe. Dean smiles, leans over and kisses Cas without thinking about what it means. Cas blushes and smiles back.
The phone stops buzzing, only to start up again a second later. Dean sniffles, reaching over to pick up his phone finally.
“Meg, don’t pick on the virgin.” He heard a British voice say near him. Dean turned and saw the guy who was Riff-Raff coming over to them. “Although I guess now Cassie here has popped your cherry, didn’t he?” He said smirking at Dean.
Dean takes in the rumpled trenchcoat, and Cas’ black hair, the Sunday-best oxfords Dean thought he would never see again.
Once the doors were locked, Dean leaned against his counters. Coffee was not a date. It was just coffee, and that clearly was not a date when Cas was getting married. People could get coffee, that was a thing that happened.
Dean sinks to his knees against the wall, starting to sob again. This isn’t fair. Dean should have said something—should have done something—but deep down he always thought they would have more time together. That all of this would finally be over and Dean could retire with Cas somewhere warm. He thought they would have more time.
“Cas!” Dean shouts, shaking the angel’s shoulder. He has no idea why or how Cas is in his bed but he’s definitely not complaining.
assumed the two of you were dating.” Anna said standing up. “Look, you can fix this, I’m sure. But if you hurt him again, I will make you regret it.” Anna added, placing the check for the rest of the cake on his desk. “I look forward to seeing the cake in two weeks. Bye, Dean,” she said with a small wave.
“Okay,” is all Dean says, hanging up the phone and finally standing. His legs hurt from being on the cold concrete floor for so long. He can’t stop crying. His tears are mostly silent now, but they won’t stop.
“Didn’t realize I paid you to be on your phone, Sam,” Dean muttered going around his brother to grab a bagel.
He hunched over, trying to hide his hard on, but he’s pretty sure that the girl playing Magenta knew. The rest of the movie passed in blur, he couldn’t think past Cas in that costume and the feeling of Cas straddling his back.
“I really want some edible flowers, kind of flowing down the side? I want them white, and I want them to be cascading down? Does that make sense?” Anna asked, watching as Dean sketched.
Dean did his best to not break any speed limit laws on his way to Cas’ condo. Only when his GPS told him he was close did he realize he had no idea if Cas would even be home. He could be at work. He had no idea of Cas’ work schedule.
“I agree. I mean all the cakes were wonderful but this one works so well,” Cas said pushing Anna’s fork away from the last bite of the cake.
Dean got out of the car and ran up to the front door, knocking loudly. After a moment passed with no answer, Dean knocked again. “Cas! I know you’re home!” Dean called out. “I need to talk to you!” He added when still no one answered the door.
Dean wasn’t sure how long he’s been sitting in his office, his head in his hands when Sam bursts in.
Dean groaned as he woke up. Shit he had been a fucking idiot last night. Three beers and he’s just throwing himself at a nearly married man? What the actual fuck was wrong with him? Dean needed to text Cas, apologize for the kiss. It was so quick, but so nice. Cas’ lips had been warm and soft. He regretted making fool of himself, obviously, but he almost regretted the kiss more, because now he knew what it felt like to kiss Cas. It felt like everything.
“Okay, on the count of three you are going to thrust against the balloon and pop their cherries. The first two get a special gift! One! Two! Three!” The lady counted down and on three Dean felt Cas push his into the balloon hard, causing the balloon to pop. Shit, they were definitely first.
Before Dean knew it, it was already Saturday night. The last time he’d seen Rocky Horror, he had been 18 and way more interested in the girl he was with than what was going on the screen. He wondered what cast member Cas was going to play.
“I love you, Cas. I have for...longer than I can remember. I should have told you. I just...I always thought we would have more time.”
“I...” he shook his head, what exactly was he supposed to say anyway? Sorry I got a boner? It’s not my fault Cas is unfairly hot. “Right, I understand.”
Cas groans, sitting up. “Hello, Dean,” he says with a small smile. Dean lets out a laugh, throwing his arms around Cas.
“Hi! Are you Cas’ friend?” she asked. Dean nodded and she grinned taking out a red lipstick and making a ‘V’ on his forehead. “This is for you!” She added, handing him a hawaiian lei. “Enjoy the show!” She added, walking away to talk to other people in the lobby.
“Did you listen to a word I just said?” Anna said cutting him off. “I’m not switching. Cas would probably kill me if I did.” She sighed and shook her head. “I’m pissed but whatever happened between you and my brother is between you two.”
Dean shook his head, it was stupid to pretend. It didn’t matter. Cas wasn’t single, and the coffee meeting was just that. A meeting of two people who hardly know each other. It certainly wasn’t a date.
Cas should have known she was going to do that, after all she had been looking out for him their entire lives.
Dean’s current issue was the glass stuck in his asscheek. That was entirely Sam’s fault. He always got in the way—that was the reason Sam had been banned from being in the kitchen of Dean’s bakery. If it wasn’t for Sam’s gargantuan frame, Dean wouldn’t currently be on a stretcher in the ER with glass in his asscheeks.
“Sorry,” Sam said with shrug, not looking at all sorry. “I’m worried about you. And Jess is worried about Cas. She said in all the time she’s worked with him he’s never missed a single day and now he’s missed several days. It’s not like him.”
. Pulled into the Empty forever, never to return again. He can’t get the image of Cas’ face out of his head. How happy he was. Just to tell Dean that he...
“Um... Sam went to lunch? I tried to tell her I could just take it, but she insisted on giving it to you.” Hannah said wringing her hands.
Dr. Novak looked down, blushing. “Yes, um, of course,” he muttered. He cleared his throat, “as I was saying, we’ll inject the area to numb it up and once you’re numb we will get started, okay?” Dean nodded.
Anna was sitting at his desk, tapping her nails on the surface. Dean took another deep breath, walking in all the way and shutting the door behind him. Okay, time to face the music.
Just when he was about to knock for a third time, the door opened. “Go away, Dean.” Cas told him. Cas looked terrible, like he hadn’t slept or showered. Dean looked down, realizing it was his fault Cas looked like that.
Shaking his head, Cas picked up the bottle of whiskey that was next to the couch and took a long sip, pulling out his phone.
Soon they were ushering them on stage. It was fairly simple, he just had to walk with the other person arm in arm. He watched as she threw the bouquet, and then they got to go sit in their seats.
“You’re fucking right what you did was wrong! God. You’re lucky that finding another baker this close to the wedding is basically impossible.” She said with a glare. “I would have tried, but Cas insisted I not do that to you. God only knows why.”
A smile appears on my lips as I pretend to keep driving. Sam, who was on his phone, stops to wait for the answer, all his attention directed towards the conversation behind us.
I can hear Dean saying a swear word as he hurries to grab a paper towel. Maybe he should stop looking at his angel and concentrate on his food!
The fact is that now, they never take their eyes off each other, each one unashamedly observing the other's reactions to the music.
In the back I have a feeling that if it was just a bench without separate seats the two would be much closer than they are now. The fact being that they are no longer cowering in their corner, but relaxed and even friendly?
Since Cas and Dean are rather busy bickering loudly - is that a honey candy I just saw flying?! - we don't need to talk so much in a low voice.
The hunt we had spotted was several hours away. No sooner had we left home than Dean rushed to the front passenger seat, until Sam stepped in.
As we still had time to join the Winchesters, I decided to train Castiel in a clothing shop. I needed some new clothes and if I could get rid of his eternal tax consultant suit it would be perfect!
Dean gets up in a hurry, takes his night clothes and locks himself in the bathroom. Cas is half hidden under his blankets. Sam and I clap our hands and pretend not to hear the suspicious sounds coming from the bathroom.
Dean is sitting around the table, showered and dressed and eating breakfast with a large cup of coffee while I am sitting, dressed and showered too, but with an exhausted angel leaning against me.
— From the beginning it is the dog that interests the killer. Every victim owned one. But why? The master is dead, but the dog is still there,
There are clearly things that are not said between them. Things that each would like to say to the other without ever daring. The only hope I have is that these six days won't be useless and that at the end, both of them will have finally realized that they have loved each other for years without telling the other. And then, well, Sam and I will go hunting for a couple of days as a duo to let the two lovers find each other?
Dean takes time to answer, probably too disturbed by the implied nature of the question. Castiel asks him clearly if the age difference disturbs him. In other words, if they have a chance.
. I, Asteria Grace, allow Dean Winchester to love and feel feelings for Castiel and promise to kick the ass of anyone who opposes him.
Cas replied a little "oh" before turning his head to the window, perhaps to hide his discomfort. Dean was now displaying a deep expression of concentration, as if he was listening to every word and then analyzing it. He did this throughout the song before finally shaking his head and mumbling a "ridiculous".
Sam laughed, before grabbing the CD cover we'd made. He grabbed the first one with 'Day 1' written on it and slipped it into the player. Dean put his head in his hands in despair.
The next two songs were quiet and then it was Little Mix's "Secret Love Song". Dean pushed a bored "here we go again" while Cas decided to close his eyes so he wouldn't have to face us again.
Dean has never been a believer, and technically the only people he prays to are Cas and me, occasionally. Except I'm not the one he wants to lie down next to and wake up next to. And, I don't know why, but I feel that the day Dean and Cas are together, Sam and I won't have much rest. I'm afraid what we might stumble upon because of those two.
Their honey candy battle continues, and I have never been so grateful for the individual wrappers. It may be bad for the planet, but it's pretty convenient.
I thanked him with a smile and we slipped away, pretending to go and get something to eat. Sam told me that Dean had also understood what was going on but that he didn't feel ready to declare himself in Castiel. Sam convinced him to continue with the songs plan. I repeated my conversation with Cas and Sam agreed with me: the angel is certainly going to have to make the first move.
My reflection was interrupted when Dean's voice, in an almost inaudible murmur, repeated "Wish we could be like that" at the same time as Jade, ending the song.
The next song had the effect of making everyone in the car cry. We found ourselves like four teenagers, sniffing under the lyrics of "Falling" by Harry Styles. Seriously? It couldn't be more tragic.
— Every time something was really wrong I would sit down and Cas would put his head in my lap and I stroke his hair. The other habit we had was to lie down and he would lean against me while my wings wrapped around him.
— In the music we can say that Susan and the other humans represent angels and Caspian and the other narnians represent humans. If... you had been in their place, what would you have chosen?
Castiel looks, his eyes wide open, his clothes blue. He pushes his hands into the sleeves of his waistcoat, trying to hide the redness on his cheeks, while even Dean can't take his eyes off his lover. All in his eyes he shouts "I love you, damn it".
With the Impala broken down, all that was left was move my car. As an Archangel in my condition I could teleport myself to get around if I wanted to, but my car was one of my proudest possessions and if I could, I would almost say that I love it as much as Dean loves Baby.
Dean blushed furiously before grabbing his cup of coffee. Sam and I couldn't hold back our laughter. However, I glanced at the clock: 6:20am. I'll soon have to wake up Cas so he can get ready before we all go for a jog.
Dean and I arrived a little late at the park with Cas and Sam already there. Dean mumbled that it was because Sam was a racing madman and that he had probably tracked in a few minutes to here. Anyway, we were each in a corner looking around. And finally we saw a strange guy talking to a guy and his dog. We watched them for a few minutes, the guy had even bent down to pet the other guy's dog before finally leaving.
. He feels like he's not the right person for the other person and he takes all the blame and defeat on his shoulders.
Sometimes I wonder how it would have happened, if it wasn't Castiel who had brought Dean out of Hell. There were legions of them, who had laid siege to Hell. But it was Castiel who managed to get through.
In the rear-view mirror, I see Castiel moving away from Dean fairly quickly while blushing at the mention of freckles. Actually, throughout the song, Sam and I watched Dean and Cas blush more and more.
— He has the mark behind his ear. I thought he looked familiar, he's the man we saw yesterday in the park.
A light goes on in Castiel's eyes and he thanks me with a tiny smile. Dean passes a hand behind his neck, uncomfortable.
I continue to run my fingers tenderly through Cas's hair, using my grace to relax and soothe him. It works because his expression relaxes. On the other side, Sam starts to get restless before finally waking up and frowning at the sight of us.
— That was the goal. With Sam we were a bit worried that you might be angry with us but in the end it's been a positive experience I think. You finally realize that it's mutual,
After picking up some food to take away, we went back to the motel where we sat around the table again in the same places we had been a few hours before.
It made Dean even more confused. And when Cas finally came out of the bathroom, it was almost as if his jaw wasn't going to be recovered because it was on the floor! The shirt brought out Castiel's blue eyes, and his pink hesitant cheeks made him even more crunchy.
Sam and Castiel went to interview him and then told us that the man wanted to know where his dog came from because he wanted to "adopt one too".
He seemed hesitant at first, before finally grabbing the clothes with a determined expression and locking himself in the room. I had to refrain from laughing when I heard him encouraging himself with a lot of "I am an Angel of the Lord, I can do it".
Frustrated, Dean sighed heavily before getting into the back seat with Castiel, the latter wearing his usual lost expression on his face. I get in my seat, tie me up and finally set off.
— Well, since they - we - are both major... if I felt something and I was sure that the feelings were mutual I wouldn't hesitate,
— Trust yourself. Believe in your abilities, stop crashing like when Dean doesn't agree with your great ideas. Take matters into your own hands, be the leader.
No one makes a comment, not even when Cas sings the lyrics. At one point I get up to take a shower, but I can still hear the lyrics.
. Let's try to see if they didn't use the same dogsitter or if the two victims weren't used to going to the same park. This is the only lead we have at the moment, we must not neglect it.
Luckily I have an extremely good command of the road because I wouldn't have missed it for the world. Dean and Cas, looking each other straight in the eyes - they even have that damn love sparkle like in the movies - with their rosy cheeks.
I'm obviously referring to what happened earlier. I didn't like at all the way he reacted when Dean made fun of his idea. Castiel is an Angel of the Lord, for God's sake, not a three-year-old kid, although sometimes it's hard to tell the difference.
About two minutes later the door opened on Sam and Dean. Dean looked all around him, surprised that he couldn't find the angel. However, his gaze fell on the beige trench coat on Castiel's bed.
I can't help but humming the words. It's not the best one we could have chosen, but it's to show them that even if things don't work out between them, they can still be friends.
It took all the delicacy in the world to get me out of Cas's embrace - who then huddled in my pillow - and into the bathroom for a good shower.
Well, it's clear that the ice is broken! Even Sam is quite taken aback by this sudden change. They have made a big step forward, but they are still only halfway: they don't run away anymore but they are not yet at the final stage of the "I love you big dumbass".
The town is starting to get closer now. Half of the honey sweets are eaten, as well as the pie and the sweet drink. I still have some sweet milk left.
All I remember is that in less than 30 seconds I was sitting in the bathroom next to Cas with him in my arms, his body shaking with sobs.
— It's normal, Cas. Love is scary at first. But I can tell you that Dean is freaked out like never before. In fact, I'm almost afraid you're the one who's gonna have to make the first move!
I don't know about Dean, but whenever Castiel and I were in Heaven, he always had his head in the clouds metaphorically, his thoughts turned to Dean. Clearly, he no longer feels complete when he's separated from him. As for the eyes, it's no secret that Dean loves Cas's blue eyes, and that he loves the green eyes of the hunter.
I stop in the middle of the road where we were and face him with a hand on his shoulder and a little smile.
Several ways of separating the beds were possible. Dean and Cas didn't want to sleep together, so he stayed :
So we pack our things so we can leave the hotel room. We'll get a new room closer to where we're going, which will be more convenient than driving ten hours a day. There is a good chance that the dog they are looking for is still there.
. As if age had anything to do with it. She could have told him straight away that he wasn't right for her.
— Ok, as soon as we finish our little meeting, we split into two groups. Asteria, you go with Cas to Karen's house. Dean and I are going to Brandon's.
How many times did Castiel leave everything in the lurch to join Dean when he needed it? Even Rachel reproached him several times, because in her eyes humans are inferior to us. When Rachel threatened to kill the Winchester brothers "to keep Castiel focused on his mission", my friend killed her outright. I didn't make a big deal of it, I couldn't stand Rachel.
“I promised Cas I wouldn’t get involved in this. I’m pissed at you for hurting my baby brother, but I will do my best to keep my promise to him.” She stated, reaching down to grab her purse.
There was a small knock before a man with unkempt brown hair entered the room. “Mr. Winchester, I’m Dr. Novak. I understand you have an issue with embedded glass?”
Right before she left his office, she paused and wrote down Cas’ address for Dean. “Just in case.” She added before leaving him alone in his office. Dean sat back and let out a sigh. He made such a huge mistake.
“How did Cas end up summoning the Empty anyways? Did you guys find a spell?” Sam asks, looking over at Dean.
“I know. I’m sorry, we don’t have to discuss it. We can pretend it never happened,” Cas promises, standing up.
Dean finished cleaning up and locked up the bakery before climbing into his Impala. Tomorrow wasn’t a date, it wasn’t.
“Sam. I’m not in the mood to talk about this. I just want to move on from all of this,” Dean said grabbing an apron from the rack next to the sink.
Getting in the Impala, Dean wipes at his face. He needs to be able to drive after all. The roads are empty as he drives and for a moment Dean wonders if Sam meant that everyone on Earth was gone too. But if that was the case why wouldn’t Chuck have taken them as well? Dean almost wishes for it at this point. Take him away from the pain he’s feeling, the loss of Cas.
They had an overstock of product, but Sam had solved that by marking everything buy one get one free, and not commenting on the waste. For the most part Dean had been trying to focus on the orders they had so that he didn’t continue to overbake. He didn’t like having to dump excess products if he could help it.
Dean’s eyes drifted back to his cheek, his thumb tickling the heated flesh, brushing over it so delicate it was hard to compare this man’s almost shy affections with the man who had once upon a time possessed the Mark of Cain.
Dean hit the water, panting, shaking, his muscles screaming in weariness, and Dean swallowed a sob, gazing up at Catiel’s shade, hovering before him without expression or comprehension.
Jack shuffled in then, Daphne chirping in his hands hidden in the flannel shirt he had given her to keep her warm. “Oh, waffles. My favorite.” He smiled, so happy and innocent, and Dean swallowed down his want for a drink in favor of keeping his promise to Michael to take care of Jack. Its what Cass would have wanted.
Castiel gazed upon him and wanted nothing more than to assure this man everything would be all right. So, he squeezed his fingers, and Dean’s eyes met his, a little scared, a lot hopeful, and Castiel slid across the bucket seat, just to sit a little closer. Dean’s eyes grew wide, throat bobbing, and Castiel ignored the long-ago insistence for personal space.
"Oh..." Jack fingered the pages of the book in his lap, a frown pushing his mouth down, his chest feeling tight. “Is that... is that why the angels hate humanity? Is that why Lucifer… my father… wanted to destroy the earth? Is it why Chuck took everyone away? Because humans never just accept what they are told, or do what they are supposed to do?” He blinked quickly, feeling his eyes turning red with tears, and moisture building in the corners of his eyes. “Is that why Castiel was hated? Because he wasn’t a good angel?”
