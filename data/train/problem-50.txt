This was strange. They never talked about their feelings like this. And most certainly not at 3 am like teenagers at a sleepover.
“No, no. It’s just… disappointingly simple, if you don’t mind me saying. I mean, you don’t get to fake your own death every day. I would’ve thrown in, I don’t know, a hypnotist, a team of confidants, a fake corpse, some dramatic music… you know.”
John looked further down and away. He hated this. He hated himself for being such a burden and couldn’t stand for Sherlock to see the self-loathing on his face.
“But you had no reason to ignore a call from Lestrade. Much less two. So, you could understand why I panicked.” Sherlock got quieter and quieter as he spoke, as if unsure if it was alright for him to be concerned.
Beside him, the blonde boy jumped right into the first part: “I got chills, they're multiplyin',” he sang.
"It was nothing, John. It was just about our tentative game plan and where to go from here, as we are sort of at a dead end. And of course, he was not particularly thrilled at the fact that I called off three more potential ambushes today.
Sherlock looked down at the dark yellow liquid and swirled it around in the glass. “Just seemed like a better option,” he mumbled.
“Great. That’s, um, good. At least now you can prepare accordingly in order to stop him.” It was lousy attempt at conversation, and John knew it. But he couldn’t bring himself to ignore him completely after his rudeness last night.
. He was just about to tell him so when Victor’s hand dropped lower and gripped his throat, cutting off his airways harshly.
Why not kill two birds with one stone while she was here? She’d be gone before John ever found out, and her secret would remain safe. Sherlock would be dead, and she could go back to being Mary Morstan.
Several drinks later, Sherlock and John had both shifted to the center of the couch and were chuckling into their drinks. Empty bottles were scattered around the table as the credits of
“Came running as soon as I heard. Ran into John on the way in.” Lestrade was directing his words at Molly, not him, which Sherlock found strange.
John looked behind him and found the two suited men now guarding the entrance to the garage. Or perhaps they were blocking his exit.
They remained just like that, swaying slowly in place, their gazes lowered down. It was so beautifully intimate, so
With an air of humoring me, Sherlock took up her position in her favored armchair across from mine, reaching automatically for the cigarette case. Her delicate fingers struck the match, and the room filled with light. It was as if the months of absence were but a moment now past.
Sherlock wanted to tell him not to worry, that no injury on his own body mattered as long as they were alive. But his voice failed him as he lost himself in John’s eyes, relishing in the fact that he was here. He was alive and he had come for him.
She froze. She’d recognize that voice anywhere. After all, its owner had given her her career, her whole life. Everything that was dear to her. And there was only one person in the world who’d call her Annie.
Their chests rose and fell together in sync. John didn’t push him away, nor did he want to. They were both no doubt thinking of that day in the alley some weeks back, where their foreheads were pressed up against each other in a similar manner. Neither of them had brought up what had happened since then. Nor had Lestrade, the only witness to the encounter. But it had lingered over them ever since, in every glance, every touch, every word.
John laid on his back and touched the warm metal on his chest, giving the child the moment of respect it never got at the time of its death. After changing into his t-shirt and pants, he had decided to keep the tags on, as he felt some kinship to the child.
“I’d never met anyone that off their rocker before,” Victor said. “Even Sherlock had some crazy moments, but he was never like that.”
“Come back to London with me. We could find a flat share and live together. Molly and Greg too. We could start a new life.”
“No, he’s too far out! I’ll have to go.” He took the other end of the rope and tried tying around his waist, but his fingers had gone numb from the arctic rain. Molly quickly understood and helped him secure the knot. The rest of the crew watched with gaping mouths as John positioned himself on the edge of the ship and dove in.
“It’s not about being original, Sherlock. It’s supposed to be cheesy in its own, charming sort of way.”
Squaring his shoulders, he turned around, facing Jackson and Bolt head on as they cornered him, red-faced and panting. He tried to think of a sarcastic one-liner, but didn’t have time before they lunged forward, each taking one of his arms and holding him back. He grunted and struggled, but even with all of his combat training, the fact remained that they were both bigger and stronger than him, and he was pinned helpless.
John cut him off by leaning in and pressing the gentlest kiss on his mouth. Just a chaste brush of the lips. The moment was electrified, the air so heavy with tension that neither of them moved for several seconds. John lingered there on his lips, both of them still as statues and then pulled back looking up at Sherlock.
John pictured Victor peering at him and Sherlock through a window or listening at the door during his visit last night. He remembered every drawn-out stare they shared. And, oh god, how John had pushed Sherlock’s curls out of his face before leaving. The thought of Victor witnessing all that sent shivers down his spine and a nervous tightening in his stomach. It’s the only explanation for why Victor would be glaring at his with that much contempt in his face.
Sherlock seemed to get the message and raised both his eyebrows. He held Julia by the waist and tilted his head at her, looking her in the eyes seductively. He snapped his low gaze back to John and smirked.
When John had visited him in the hospital after he was shot. Sherlock, once again, drugged into oblivion, but he couldn’t resist leaning down and pressing a kiss to his forehead. No one had to know.
“I’m surprised actually,” he said, in an attempt to change the topic. “I haven’t dreamed about Afghanistan in ages. These days it’s usually about you or Mary.”
Someone clapped John on the back, and he turned around to find Greg and the others circling around them.
She raised the gun to strike again. Sherlock winced and turned away, bracing himself for another blow.
But wasn’t the whole point of keeping things casual between them to avoid this exact thing? Feelings? Heartbreak?
Swallowing back the hot bile rising in his throat, he turned his vengeful gaze towards Moriarty. If he thought he was angry when Victor stood in Sherlock’s spot, he was wrong. The sight of Moriarty at the tip of the bow, hands behind his back in a perfect imitation of Sherlock, filled him with complete and utter white hot fury that flooded through his entire body.
Sod it, John thought. Sod Mary and her stupid threats. He was in control of his own life. She wouldn’t stop him from being happy. Besides, he and Sherlock had already crossed the line. It was all or nothing now. If he wanted to sit him down and have a conversation, then he damn well would. And if she came after them, they would deal with it together. Like they always had.
“No. I’ll kill the rest of you. One by one.” This stopped everyone for a moment. Even Sherlock’s breath caught in his chest.
For years she had been his faithful number two. Annie, he always called her. No one had ever called her that. She was Annabelle in the orphanage.  Annabelle Gertrude Rosamund Abbott. She always hated her full name. Thought it was quite old fashioned. But Annie . . . she quite liked that.
John’s aching hard erection stood stiff against his stomach. Sherlock stroked the length of it delicately. He reached the head and swirled his fingertip into the bit of pre-cum oozing out there.
Sherlock shivered in his arms. His words were muffled a bit from the way his face was mashed into his lap, but John could still understand. “They wanted to put me away somewhere until I got better. I didn’t want to go. They wouldn’t speak to me. And Mycroft. The way he looked at me. . .”
“Oof!” he yelled as he fell beside Sherlock on the floor. Sherlock scrambled to his knees, tugging at John’s arm again.
That reminded him. “Yeah. Hey, did Sherlock tell you about what happened after I blacked out? I haven’t had a chance to ask him yet.”
Thanks to everyone who's been reading this, and huge thanks to my beta Munya (@music-over-matter on tumblr)!
Throughout dinner, the two of them mostly kept to themselves at their table. Sherlock entertained him by deducing the guests, making him laugh inappropriately.
“John, whatever happened last night, there must be a logical, scientifically plausible explanation for it. We just have to find it.”
Tony pressed the rod into him again, and his vision whited out with agony. His teeth dug into his bottom lip, physically shaking from the effort to hold back. But at last, his mouth opened, and an inhuman groan tore out of him.
Or he could fess up. Once he was no longer with Mary, he’d be able to begin his life anew. He could start fresh with Sherlock too. This was a conversation they’d probably never have again.
John tossed his head back and laughed. He lifted Sherlock’s face up and smacked a quick kiss onto his sticky forehead.
John grabbed his coat and stormed out the door leaving Sherlock rooted to the spot, head down, not having uttered a word in response. Part of him knew he was overreacting, but sometimes Sherlock needed to be told off.
He was relieved at the miscarriage because it allowed him to escape a toxic relationship. End of story. Under other circumstances he would have loved a child in his life. Mary only wanted the baby as a tool to control him. John’s stomach churned at the reveal of how she really felt about their unborn daughter.  She would have been a terrible mother to her and John was now even more relieved that she would never have to be raised in their household.
Sherlock was positively trembling beneath him. When John felt him pull back on his hair, he stopped and looked up at him in question.
Feeling a tug on the rope around his waist, he looked back to the ship to see Molly pulling the two of them in while Victor, Jackson, and Bolt uselessly watched. John clung tightly to Sherlock, who was shaking violently and nearly passed out, while they were pulled up into the air and back onto the ship. John pulled the rope off his waist and threw it back over the edge of the ship before collapsing onto the other man, panting and coughing out the remains of water in his throat.
“Yes, I’ll go grab our coats,” Stacey said, and squeezed through the dancing crowd, leaving John and Julia alone.
She looked up into his dark eyes, empty and cold to outsiders, but full of quiet mischief and life to her. “Yes,” she whispered shakily and leaned into his open arms. He pulled her in and rested his chin atop her curls. His suit smelled like spicy mint and earth, just like she remembered.
“You’ve done nothing but make me miserable.” John’s voice dripped with venom as he practically snarled into the phone. “You’re the worst thing that could have ever possibly happened to me.”
A few hot, orange sparks shot out of the broken light before landing on the carpet and fizzling out.
John smiled back and took Sherlock’s hand, leading him to the dance floor. They faced each other and took their positions.
John seemed to notice the snow too and pressed his lips to a freckle on Sherlock’s neck. There was no need to speak. The love between them was felt in every bit of contact, the gentle sway of their bodies, even the sweet melodic notes that flowed effortlessly from Sherlock’s violin. Sherlock knew John was just as grateful as him for where they were in their lives now. He saw it in the way John held him close at night, how he squeezed his hand when they walked the streets of London.
She closed the top of the bench and picked up a picture frame on a nearby stand. Her heart clenched as she stroked her thumb over her and John’s faces, looking a bit younger and a bit happier. A completely different time.
Hearty laughter erupted from the floors beneath them as they heard Greg and Molly chatting cordially once more. Heavy footsteps vibrated through the ship as the other men wandered the halls below. The sounds of other life on the ship reminded Sherlock and John of what they certainly should not be doing so openly on the deck.
John's kiss had been chaste and subtle. This was passionate. Everything they had been holding back these past several weeks, every pining glance, every unspoken word, exploded into this moment. They gripped each other's heads as if their lives depended on it and kissed fiercely for what felt like an eternity.
“Not just Sherlock this time. All of you. Let’s go.” Confused, John, Molly, and Greg rose and followed Sherlock and Jackson out of the brig.
She kicked the drawers shut and half-sprinted to the window bench John didn’t know could open. She’d even covered the surface in plush, decorative pillows so there would never be a need to sit on it. She brushed them all off in one careless sweep and lifted the top.
“Are you angry with me?” Sherlock piped up quietly after a while. “For making you think I had died? For putting you through all that? Letting you think you were going to die as well?”
He eventually took pity on the poor, stuttering man and cut him off with a chaste, tender kiss. This, of course, shut him up right away.
The man turned a sharp corner into an alley instead. They nearly skidded and crashed over each other trying to follow. John regained his footing first and darted into the alley.
Lestrade and two nearby officers quickly exchanged looks before relenting and helping him wrapping the rope in several tight loops around his waist. Once a secure knot was tied, the rope was hooked onto the pulley where normally a bucket would be pulled up.
“Um . . .” Sherlock was silent for a moment, clearly embarrassed that he’d forgotten all about it. “Well, we can just shift the couch a little and forget it was ever there.” John returned his cheeky smile with another chuckle.
The entire next day, John could barely focus on his work. The only thing on his mind was looking forward to meeting Sherlock in his room in the evening. So when night fell and everyone retired to their cabins or a recreational area, John weaseled out of a chat with Molly and snuck over to the captain’s quarters.
Next in the box was a book about the history of the British army Sherlock had gotten him. He never got around to reading it, but inside, the pages were filled with cross-outs, scrawled footnotes, and corrections.
For instance, on this morning, he awoke bright and early, rolling over to gaze at Sherlock. He was asleep on his stomach, his arms wrapped tightly around his pillow and his face turned to the side. John placed his fingertips on his nose and cheek, stroking him fondly. With his beautiful body on display like this, adorned with the pale sunlight peeking in from their curtains, he just couldn’t resist touching him.
“Look, I’m not an idiot, John. After what happened I knew you were only staying with me for the baby. And now that it’s out of the way I have no hold over you. Now you’re free to rebuild your life with Sherlock. I get it.”
They crept onwards and pulled up right alongside Moriarty’s looming ship. This close up, it was even more obvious how much it dominated theirs in size. Victor barked out the order to anchor onto it. Jackson and Bolt made their way to comply but were interrupted by a sudden, powerful thud below them, which sent vibrating tremors all the way up to the deck.
There was no doubt in his mind that the situation would be inherently romantic. He and Sherlock had had many nights in like this before. They would order take-out and sit on the floor with their backs against the couch. They’d watch some ridiculous movie and eat off the coffee table while Sherlock deduced the plot, pointed out faults, and criticized the actors. They’d maybe pop open a few beers and spend the evening in a hazy, giggly stupor.
Sherlock sits in the back of the ambulance, running over and over again what he could have missed that would have lead him to conclude that the man would, in fact, fire his weapon. It was one horrific thing to be wrong, it was another thing entirely for his miscalculation to place John Watson unconscious in the back of an ambulance. He closed his eyes against the spots in his vision, swaying a little with the effort to keep himself upright.
"C'mon" Sherlock says as he sits up. "Let's get up off this floor before we get stuck down here or something."
"Alright so take it out and get him a new one. Or better yet, run the tests on me, he can have one of mine if he needs. And if I'm not a match, I can have someone who is here within the hour."
"What, John getting shot in the kidney?" Greg asks, fully expecting something along the lines of Serves him right for just giving one of his away.
"No, I think you're splendid, you fit in everywhere so well. S'not just my looks that make me stand out."
"Well, as you and Lestrade have pointed out time and time again, my hair is one of my most distinguishable features. I was rather hoping there would be a way to remove that in a less permanent manner than hair dye should the need ever arise for a case."
"So what was the money for? I hope you didn't use it to bribe a criminal or something. You know Lestrade said if we do it officially then we don't have to use our own money."
The voice, quite unmistakable, comes from behind Greg just before his hand settles on the doorknob. He sighs and rolls his eyes, then turns to find Mycroft is sitting in one of the plastic hospital chairs just across the hall. Mycroft gets up and makes his way over to him, glancing through the window in the door, hovering just a bit to much into Greg's personal space. Apparently Sherlock's lack of boundaries was, in fact, genetic. He found it less undesirable than he would have guessed.
They lay like that for a long while, dozing on and off. Sherlock's heartbeat lulls John into peace, as Sherlock rubs his hand up and down John's arm. For the first time in a long while, he feels perfectly happy, like he needs nothing else in the world but to be held by the man he loves. The man who loves him. If the two of them are together, nothing could possibly stand in their way, not even bad guys with guns that want to kill them. They will just keep saving each other, just like always.
John won't meet Sherlock's eyes for a moment, afraid that Sherlock would scoff at the idea of a cuddle, until he feels Sherlock's hand in his own, pulling him up.
Instead of an answer, Sherlock winces as John touches the burn, trying to feel how hot it is. He sighs, then turns the tap on, forcing out as much cold water as he can. He meets Sherlock's eyes before tugging on his arm, forcing the burn under the near freezing water. Sherlock lets out a small yelp and tries to pull away, but John's grip on his arm is hard as hell. John takes his distraction as the time to press the more important question.
“I know well that I have it in me to make my name famous,” Ms. Holmes announced. “No man lives or has ever lived who has brought the same amount of study and of natural talent to the detection of crime which I have done.” Modesty, I was finding, was another of Ms. Holmes’ shortcomings. “And what does it amount to?” She shook a telegram, from where I had not noticed. “Banal ‘puzzlers’, some bungling villany so transparent that even a Scotland Yard official ought to see through it.”
It was as though a chasm had erupted beneath my feet and the entirety of the hall ignored my plight. Indeed, the audience seemed to revel in the performance. I looked sidelong at my friend, expecting to see, not shock, but indulgence or mirth at my own. Yet Holmes paid me not a whit of attention. She was enraptured by the deviant upon the stage.
I was about to make some scathing retort when in the dim light I saw her head thrown forward, her whole attitude rigid with attention. A glance revealed all was still and dark outside, save only that brilliant yellow screen in front of us with the black figure outlined upon its centre. In the utter silence I heard a sibilant note which spoke of Holmes’ intense suppressed excitement. An instant later she pulled me back into the blackest corner of the room, and I felt her warning hand upon my lips. The fingers which clutched me were quivering. Never had I known my friend more moved, and yet the dark street still stretched lonely and motionless before us.
The location she led me to that evening was not Covent or St. James or any other classical venue, but a common music hall. I could not hide my surprise, yet as she commanded a path through the crowd to the edge of the stage, I ruefully revised my thinking. My friend wore a man’s waistcoat and black tails, why should she avoid a place where crossdressing was the main entertainment. She had no qualms about visiting vulgar or disreputable places in pursuit of knowledge. This, I believed, would be no different.
“I had only one confidant—my brother Mycroft. It was necessary to confide in him in order to obtain money and be kept abreast of developments. The course of events in London did not run so well as I had hoped, for the trial of the Moriarty gang left two of its most dangerous members, my own most vindictive enemies, at liberty. I won’t bore you with how I passed the years, the majority of the time was spent traveling under assumed identities. There was little actual investigating I could safely do to conclude matters, but what information I gathered I sent along to Mycroft.
Throwing all sensibility to the wind, I threw my arms around her shoulders in a passionate embrace. Her body, always lithe and now skin and bone, melted into mine through the frock coat of that ghastly disguise.
The rooms at 221B Baker Street consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad windows. It was also accompanied with a housekeeper, Mrs. Hudson, who showed us in and took in our curious differences in appearance.
Holmes stood as well, her countenance grim as a thunderclap, and tossed the contents of her pipe into the fire, popping and crackling. “I have told you as plain as I possibly could that you would only be a hindrance to me in my next task, without going so far as to be cruel—”
She took down a heavy brown volume from her shelves. For many years she had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning names, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which she could not at once furnish information. How she decided which peoples or places were worthy of documentation was unknown to me.
It was a weary Holmes that trudged into the sitting room later that night. Already I had positioned myself at the fireplace, and she paused at the mantle to fill her clay pipe before sinking into the opposite armchair.
My flatmate turned in her chair at last, giving me her customary sweeping glance. “A girl, was it?” She pronounced, rising to fill her pipe from the hanging slipper.
“Wait a moment,” said she in worry. “Are you sure that you are really fit to discuss things? I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance.” She’d never apologized for her dramatics before, and I laughed through the tears spilling from my eyes. If this was some phantasmagoria, I would treasure every second of it.
“Then you did not know her before?” At my silence, he went on, “Forgive me, for it isn't my place, but you may want to reconsider. Holmes is… peculiar. Surely you've noticed her odd manner of dress?” I nodded stiffly. “That's only the beginning. She's a brazen menace, and if the law were on my side, I'd have her locked away for good.”
Ms. Holmes insisted on treating me to a succulent dinner at an artistic Soho establishment, where she of course knew several patrons, yet doted on me exclusively. As evening gave way to night, the events of the day crystallized into reality, losing their dreamy disbelief. My old friend was truly there, in the flesh.
The way that Ms. Holmes strode into a room brimming with men of high authority, and not only didn’t bow her head or lower her gaze, but proceeded to take charge of the scene, indeed, insulted the efforts of Lestrade and Gregson… It was inspiring to be sure. She comported herself as though there should be no reason to be meek. She, and the Inspectors it seemed, were well aware of her brilliant intellect. None of the Inspectors or officers had removed their hats for her as they did myself, a move that Ms. Holmes met with scorn.
“Well then, about that chasm,” She drawled, releasing her lungful; I had never felt kinder regard for tobacco. “I had no serious difficulty in getting out of it, for the very simple reason that I never was in it.”
“Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?”
“It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. A cabinet size plate is too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.”
“Not so, Lestrade. I do not propose that Jane nor myself appear in the matter at all. To you, and to you only, belongs the credit of the remarkable arrest which you have effected.” She clapped the inspector on the arm. “Yes, Lestrade, I congratulate you! With your usual happy mixture of cunning and audacity you have got him.”
So when I tell you, gentle reader, that when Holmes said this I felt the blow in the core of me and my ears rang into sudden silence, it can be believed.
“Why, a person’s height, in nine cases out of ten, can be told from the length of his stride. It is a simple calculation enough, though there is no use my boring you with figures. I had this fellow’s stride both on the clay outside and on the dust within. Then I had a way of checking my calculation. When one writes on a wall, their instinct leads them to write about the level of their own eyes. Now that writing was just over six feet from the ground. It was child’s play.”
My night passed fitfully so that when I observed the dawn light creeping over the horizon, I took myself downstairs. Odd it was indeed to see the sitting room at the unusual hour, and I fled to the kitchens. While I lacked Mrs. Hudson’s skill, I could brew a dark, rancid batch of tea, and this I drank over the sink. I returned upstairs to the desolate flat. In this new bout of waiting, I near chewed my nails to the bone.
As I watched, spellbound, Sherlock’s factual recounting faltered, revealing a longing that tugged at my own heart. It conjured a flurry of recollections: the first firm grasp of my hand in St. Bart’s laboratory; my gradual induction into her work through the Brixton Mystery; a hundred surreptitious touches in forty or so cases, a thousand stolen looks in a decade of cohabitation, a million fluttering heartbeats; a discarded dream of a country cottage with its apiary and garden.
“To do nothing whatever. Make your way into the stable yet at a vantage to view that open window.” She pointed to one two stories up with a linen curtain swaying gently. “A whelp of fourteen boasted of its clear line to her changing screen.”
“Yes. He knows that I am his superior, and acknowledges it to me; but he would cut his tongue out before he would own it to any third person.” She puffed on her pipe, the clouds revolving around her head like the solar system she’d known nothing of. Then, quite from nowhere, she tossed the pipe’s contents into the fire. “However, we may as well go and have a look. I shall work it out on my own hook. I may have a laugh at them if I have nothing else. Come on!” She hustled on her overcoat, and bustled about in a way that showed that an energetic fit had superseded the apathetic one. “Get your hat,” She said, and I nearly searched the room for a third occupant.
“Because it commands so excellent a view of that picturesque pile. Might I trouble you, my dear Watson, to draw a little nearer to the window, taking every precaution not to show yourself, and then to look up at your rooms—the starting point of so many of our little adventures. We will see if my three years of absence have entirely taken away my power to surprise you.”
At last, as midnight approached and the street gradually cleared, she paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation.
“Yes, though you needn’t fear. The culprit has been arrested, courtesy of my Irregulars, though the Inspectors will claim credit in tomorrow’s headlines.”
“Has time weakened you so,” She snarled, turning in her pacing, “Or is it your faith in me that has been so eroded?”
I crept forward and looked across at the familiar window. As my eyes fell upon it I gave a gasp and a cry of amazement. The blind was down and a strong light was burning in the room. The shadow of a woman, seated in a chair within, was thrown in hard, black outline upon the luminous screen of the window. I put a hand to my own cheek, the loose wisps of my hair, the shell of my ear.
“Do put that away, my most extraordinary girl!” She exclaimed, and I set the gun down once again. She rushed to me, thrusting an open ointment box close to my face. “I have it now! The last link in the case is complete!” She cried exultantly. “Observe, Watson, are these ordinary pills?” The small box contained two pills, and they certainly were not ordinary. They were of a pearly grey colour, small, round, and almost transparent against the light.
“Pray take a seat,” said Holmes, with a gesture to the settee. “This is my friend and colleague, Mrs. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?”
Curious beyond reason, I pressed myself in behind her so that I might look. The panel contained a photograph, cabinet sized, standing up at an angle to fit, and an envelope. Holmes withdrew both with shaking hands. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in an elegant evening gown, while the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes. To be left till called for.” My friend tore it open and she and I read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way:
“Neither overmuch,” Holmes remarked, scribbling upon her telegraph pad, “A mere confirmation. I shall be with you in an instant, Watson.” I seated myself in my favoured armchair, and poured myself a finger of brandy. Alcohol had become my sin, as Holmes had hers.
“You agree?” I may have imagined the slightest brush, like a drop of spring rain, upon the back of my wrist.
Her mouth thinned, brows drawing down, and were she a foul her feathers would be puffed out and ruffled. “I am seldom in the habit of joking of such matters.” Whatever ‘such matters’ consisted of, I couldn’t guess. However this affront couldn’t last in the face of her cheerful disposition. “Ah well, you may ruminate on it. Another hasty egress awaits us, I’m afraid.”
“Eglow, Eglonitz—here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country—in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my dear girl, what do you make of that?” Her eyes sparkled, and she sent up a great triumphant cloud from her pipe
“There’s no room for a mistake,” She answered. “The very first thing which I observed on arriving there was that a cab had made two ruts with its wheels close to the curb. Now, up to last night, we have had no rain for a week, so that those wheels which left such a deep impression must have been there during the night. There were the marks of the horse’s hoofs, too, the outline of one of which was far more clearly cut than that of the other three, showing that that was a new shoe. Since the cab was there after the rain began, and was not there at any time during the morning—I have Gregson’s word for that—it follows that it must have been there during the night, and, therefore, that it brought those two individuals to the house.”
“Hardly,” Holmes scoffed, then looked more sharply at me. “Is this an olive branch, or honest inquiry? I don’t wish to entertain hollow overtures, my time is too precious for that.”
“If he had been one there was no reason to believe that he had ceased to be. On the contrary, from his point of view, any sudden change would be likely to draw attention to himself. He would, probably, for a time at least, continue to perform his duties. There was no reason to suppose that he was going under an assumed name. Why should he change his name in a country where no one knew his original one? I therefore organized my band of informants, and sent them systematically to every cab proprietor in London until they ferreted out the man that I wanted. How well they succeeded, and how quickly I took advantage of it, are still fresh in your recollection. The murder of Stangerson was an incident which was entirely unexpected, but which could hardly in any case have been prevented. Through it, as you know, I came into possession of the pills, the existence of which I had already surmised."
“To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.”
She chose that instant to withdraw a set of complicated chemical equipment from another box. “No, not by trade,” She said, with a tone that told me she was being deliberately counter-intuitive, “Though I gather knowledge of all sorts. One never knows what might be useful.” It was a brush off, and one that I accepted, and we continued unpacking and reordering the flat to our satisfaction late into the night.
Mr. Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass. “She’s hardly a lady as most would classify. A decent enough woman, rather eccentric, has some queer ideas about the state of society. You may not fancy her as a long term companion.”
“You had my note?” He asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. “You had been told I would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address.
“Very well,” I said, tongue loose, “You’re arrogant, narcissistic, irascible, irreverent, manipulative, and require constant validation to keep you in high spirits.” The woman in question continued to smoke, unmoved. “You are also loud,” I added, “Not with your violin, but with your very being.” She blew out, and her smile shone through the haze. “You are an appalling picture of womanhood, yet you’re equally unsuitable as a man.”
“Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go—none.”
Through my tangled locks I did not catch her expression as she declared, “So it is that I find myself in my old armchair in my own old room, my old friend Watson in the other chair.”
Well practiced, Holmes and I fluidly melted into the shadows against the wall. My hand closed upon the handle of my revolver, drawing it free of my handbag. Peering through the gloom, I saw the vague outline of a man, a shade blacker than the blackness of the open door. He stood for an instant, and then he crept forward, crouching, menacing, into the room. He was within three yards of us, this sinister figure, and my finger tensed on the trigger, before I realized that he had no idea of our presence. He passed close, enough that I caught a whiff of him that tickled my memory, and he stole over to the window, and noiselessly raised it half a foot. In his hand he carried what appeared to be a stick, but as he laid it down upon the floor it gave a metallic clang. Then from the pocket of his overcoat he drew a bulky object, and he busied himself in some task which ended with a loud, sharp click, as if a spring or bolt had fallen into its place. He knelt upon the dusty floor and threw all his weight and strength upon some lever, with the result that there came a long, whirling, grinding noise, ending once more in a powerful click. He straightened himself then, and I saw that what he held in his hand was a sort of gun, with a curiously misshapen butt. He opened it at the breech, put something in, and snapped the breech-block. Then, crouching down, he rested the end of the barrel upon the ledge of the open window.
“This. This shutting me out. Refusing to communicate with me. Just stop it. Do you realize how much could’ve been avoided if you would just talk to me, Sherlock? You were almost killed by that bloody cabbie because you ran after him without me. We almost died at that damn pool because you decided would be a good idea to rendezvous with a criminal mastermind by yourself. And then there’s when you fell…” His voice faltered a little here. He took a few deep breaths to regain his composure and continued when he trusted his himself to speak again. Sherlock was back in his microscope, ignoring his words and refusing to meet his eye.
How dare he apologize. He had nothing to be sorry for. Sherlock would let John hug him like that every day if he wished. And it was him who should be apologizing. He was the reason John was with still with her.
“It doesn’t matter.” He turned his back and busied himself putting his knife away. After a moment of careful consideration, Sherlock marched up and forcibly turned him around by the shoulder.
She gave John a respectful mourning period of about six months before landing a job at his clinic and becoming Mary Morstan.
He pulled back to see Sherlock’s expression was still set in stone. When he finally moved, he lifted his hand and placed it delicately on his lips.
As dusk fell, the pale, white sky transformed into a deep royal blue. The sun tucked itself away behind the horizon leaving a refreshing, brisk breeze in its place. The crew members packed up for the night and retreated to other areas of the ship for a recreational evening. Jackson, Bolt, and Victor all disappeared somewhere, and Molly and Greg walked off to a lower level of the ship together. As they passed him, Molly snuck a glance at John and gave him an excited smile. He grinned back, genuinely happy for his friend.
John had tucked his head into his neck endearingly as he caught his breath, his body most likely still in a state of shock from nearly drowning.
“Yeah?” John said. He didn’t seem angry at the suggestion. Rather, he sincerely wanted to hear the reasoning behind it.
“Yeah,” he repeated. His voice came out small and croaky. He quickly cleared his voice to repeat himself, but Sherlock jumped in first.
“John, it’s perfect. Today was perfect. Thank you.” John broke out into a huge grin and took the scarf from Sherlock. He looped it around his neck, almost having to stand on his tip-toes, and then hitched his coat collar up.
He had just kissed Sherlock Holmes. And Sherlock Holmes had kissed him back, hard. His heart was still racing, and he had not yet caught his breath. Running a hand through his already mussed up hair, he let out a content chuckle knowing that his feelings had not been one sided.
“Sherlock?” he asked cautiously, his stomach knotting with anxiety. His eyes seemed to be unfocused and darting around, like they did when he was solving a puzzle.
“Goodness, John. How will you last a whole weekend here if a dark basement has you nearly peeing in your pants?”
Sherlock recognized different groups of people from his university. It was Saturday night, after all. Of course they would all be here. Over by the dance floor was a group of giggling girls from the cheerleading squad. On one side of the bar was a group of lads with greased back hair, leather jackets, and cigarettes. And directly across the floor from him and Mike were the rugby jocks in their matching jackets.
John sighed and reached up to place his palm on Sherlock’s cheek. He didn’t know why, but it was like couldn’t help himself. It just seemed like the right thing to do. Sherlock’s eyes fluttered and he leaned into the touch like he was starving for it.
Sherlock halted, causing John to almost knock into him from behind. Looking him dead in the eye, he said, “Is that what you feel I did, John? Rob you of your entire life? Because last I checked, you willingly joined this crew glad to be rid of any so-called life you may have had before. Now are you going to contribute to this ambush with the rest of us or not?”
“Tsk, tsk, Sherlock.” John was both furious with him and astounded that he remembered his name. “You should really train your pets better. This one will need some disciplining.”
He let his head fall back against the wall and pushed his hair off his forehead. He hadn’t cried like that since Sherlock’s death. And just like then, instead of it feeling good to let everything out, all he felt was empty and horribly sick to his stomach.
“'Cause the power you're supplyin'. . .” Sherlock stumbled towards the end of the stage to escape his advances. One more step backwards and he would fall off.
John couldn’t deny the wetness on his cheeks. A few silent tears had escaped his eyes. He drew in a shaky breath trying to rid himself of the guilt burning a hole through his chest.
The door opened and Victor came back in with a glass of water. Evans took it and gently tipped a bit into Sherlock’s mouth. Despite himself, he couldn’t help but eagerly swallow every drop that was offered to him.
Everyone barked out a collective “Aye!” before running to their respective stations. John tried to shield his face from the forceful wind smacking the frigid rain in his face and get a look at Sherlock. He was up directing Greg who was pulling and yanking and the wheel with his whole body, attempting to navigate the thrashing waves.
Remembering this, their smiles grew wider. It was rare for John to see Sherlock smile like this. The lines of his face cutting deep, the wrinkles reaching his eyes, which glistened with glee. While trying to memorize his smile, he vowed to do his best to make it reappear as often as possible.
He didn't get much further before Sherlock lunged forward, grabbed John's face and pressed their mouths back together. Sherlock's warm lips completely enveloped his as the kiss deepened. John's entire body froze from shock. He stood still as one of Sherlock's hands ran tenderly through his short, blonde hair and the other wrapped around his waist pulling his body in completely against his. John finally melted into the embrace, reaching his arms up and weaving them into Sherlock's curls.
“But for now I’ll just take care of the second Holmes brother. I at least hope he’ll be more of a challenge than his old haggard of a mother and cowardly drunkard of a father.”
“Triple homicide. Identical circumstances. All in key locations around town where Lestrade suspects an underground gang network is operating. Yes!” he exclaimed, with a little jump.
John looked up from his paper and grinned smugly at Sherlock, who was attempting to pin him with a menacing glare. When John didn't budge or break the eye contact for a full minute, Sherlock huffed dramatically and bent down to remove his shoes.
“I’m sorry, Sherlock” John whispered through his hands. He peeked one eye open and saw he was confused.
She unbuttoned her jacket irritably. Nothing sounded better than pouring herself a glass of wine and settling in front of the couch as soon as she got home. Only a few more hours of her shift at the clinic and she could welcome the warm buzz only alcohol could provide her.
When the door finally opened, a dripping wet Sherlock came through it. He was drenched from the knees down, his hair was damp and tousled, and there were dirt smudges on his face.
John had received no further messages or harassment from Mary, so he took that to mean he was satisfying her terms.
John chuckled. “Bugger. Perhaps the last one would have been more enjoyable. Once we had gotten together and all.”
Sherlock simply nodded once, and drummed his fingers more anxiously, refusing to make eye contact . . . John felt horrible. The next words bubbled out of his mouth before he could stop them.
Greg handed him a raggedy mop and a bucket of gray, soapy water. “Captain says if you won’t talk, he at least wants to put you to good work. You know, help out. Do something beneficial to the ship.” He shrugged. “He has little patience for anyone who isn’t directly useful to him. That’s why our crew is so small.”
“Glad to see you’re awake, Doctor Watson. You gave us all quite a fright,” she said with a warm smile.
So John let him stay there, assuming he was just catching his breath. That was, until long fingers slowly trailed down his arm and laced through his own.
No, he wasn’t dead. If Sherlock was dead, he would know it. Somehow. It was far more likely that Mary was waiting there with him. But who knew what they had been up to all these hours? The fire of panic in his stomach didn’t settle one bit as the taxi pulled up to his destination.
Sherlock shivered just slightly at his touch. Or was it a flinch? Did it sting? John pulled his hand away apologetically and returned to his medical task. He took a gauze roll out of the first aid kit and unraveled three long strips.
He opened it and found a neatly compiled list of each target along with which bombers were assigned to the area at which time. With bile rising in his throat, he remembered how Evans had raged about the poor treatment he’d received from the hospital, the lack of attention from government and social service providers that were supposed to care for the public. He remembered Sherlock deducing how broke Tony and Sean both were. These men all had resentments against London’s most important establishments – they aimed to destroy it all.
“I don’t know exactly,” John replied with a shrug. “I guess just being that close to you. It felt nice. It was comforting.”
“Because I couldn’t bear it if you got hurt because of me," he finished, fully burying his face into the jumper.
It was his first proper, close look at John’s cock, and it was magnificent. His mouth watered at the sight of it standing boldly against his lower stomach. John used his thumbs to push his bangs out of his face, and he dove forward to take the head in his mouth with a primal groan. John was too large for him to take in completely, so he used his hand for the base and bobbed down so his mouth could meet his fist in the middle. John made a sound of near agony. His fingers tightened in his hair.
This was something Sherlock used to do a lot before the fall. Back when it was just the two of them living in their own little world. He would make John laugh in inappropriate settings by deducing the people around them. Within no time, the two of them would be in a hopeless fit of giggles, breathless and leaning on each other for support.
Sherlock frantically paced in front of the fireplace. One hand on his hip, the other pinching the bridge of his nose.
Mycroft’s head fell back in an insincere laugh. “No, no. Let’s not think of it as spying. That’s not in good spirit. But I promise you, you’ll be compensated for your efforts.”
John missed it terribly. And he missed Sherlock. He missed their easy intimacy, the long nights they spent out working on cases, the precious moments they would catch between work to just be together.
Sherlock’s skin tingled in the spot where Evans’ thumb gently circled. The sweet release of the needle was the most alluring thing that could’ve been offered to him. All his pain would go away. He wouldn’t think of John, he wouldn’t feel the blood drying on his clothes, caking on his skin, he wouldn’t feel so cold, so sore, so alone.
“I do,” he repeated, though his voice now felt thicker in his throat. “I had a person like that. But uhh. . . not anymore,” he added as his heart began to stiffen with remorse once again. “Things kind of went downhill.”
He looked back and saw one of his comrades limping along, trying to reach the trench. He would never make it on his own. Before John could help, he pushed him into the trench, falling forward on his injured leg. “NO!” John tried to scream, but no sound came out.
“Be strong for Molly and Lestrade,” Sherlock said, his voice softer than it’s ever been. “Be strong for me.”
Sherlock scowled as the rugby team lost it in the background. He pounded a finger into the boy’s chest and sang his part, equally as confident. “You better shape up! 'Cause I need a man, and my heart is set on you.”
But finally, they released their holds and stepped back. John kept his head down, as if embarrassed.
John clenched his fist under the table and resisted the urge to clear his throat at her. He knew he had just made it all too clear that he was not Sherlock’s date, yet he couldn’t help the burn of jealousy that ignited in his chest.
This is what he got for letting someone into his heart again. Caring was not an advantage. Sherlock flopped down onto his bed, dreading the morning when he would have to face John's rejection. Again.
“Ladies and gents! Who’s ready for another karaoke round?” Cheers erupted through the club. The lights dimmed and two spotlights began to roam, seeking random participants.
“Because you mess with me, you mess directly with Sherlock Holmes. And more importantly, you try to mess around with Sherlock Holmes, you mess with me.”
A bead of sweat rolled down the back of John’s neck as he delivered another blow to the punching bag. The dampened V-neck of his white T-shirt clung tightly to his skin. Probably a bit see-through at this point; he’d been at it awhile. He squared his shoulders to position himself for two more jabs, channeling all his tension from the day into the rapid strikes. God it felt good to let that out, he thought, cracking his neck and shaking his shoulders out. He swiped his hand across his forehead, clearing it of the little droplets that had pooled there, and ran his fingers through his damp fringe. He leaned in close to the bag and delivered a finale of several more hooks before stepping back to shake his arms out.
The bomb vest, the hard drive, the red dots threatening to end their lives at any moment. Sherlock was at the pool from one of their earliest cases.
It was these three encounters with Sherlock that had John rethinking everything after Mary’s miscarriage.
“Nothing. No sorry. I was just trying to figure out how desperate he must have been to lower his standards enough for you.”
“And you are by far the best thing that has ever happened to me. And I don’t want to ever again hear you say you’re not worth something. Do you hear me?”
“And unfortunately for you, he’s also being a bit stubborn,” Evans continued. “Which is why I came to you instead.”
"You've had these gloves for about four, no, five years. Been through all types of wear and tear. But you only lost one. So you had to remove them for some reason, and left the other behind. The tips of the thumb, index, and ring finger are dirty." Sherlock sniffed and dabbed his tongue on the material. "Crumbs. Cookie crumbs. And the back of the glove is damp with a single streak of..." Another taste. "Milk. You had cookies and milk. Who would give a grown man cookies and milk?" Realization dawned on him.
“What’s your name, cutie?” Stacey asked, linking her arm with his and pulling his attention away from Julia cozying up to Sherlock.
“Hm? Oh, yes,” Sherlock replied, clearly being pulled out of deep thought. “I was just revisiting some old cases.”
“You are going to tell me how you did it, you know,” John said as Sherlock lazily stroked his blonde hair, his chin resting atop his head.
The three men, apart from Evans, launched into a joint story that involved all of them. John was left out of their reminiscence, and he was alright with that. It seemed the room had forgotten he was there, aside from the sympathetic glances Leah would spare him every now and then.
Sherlock led John upstairs and pulled down the ladder to the attic. The two of them climbed up, flashlights in hand. He showed him the box where he’d found the Ouija board and other paraphernalia.
He protested as several hands pulled him up to the stage. He mentally kicked himself as he climbed the steps. He should have gone home when he had the chance.
“Yes. Gina’s firstborn. The child that didn’t go missing. Josephine’s mother.” He stopped his pacing at the look on John’s face. He felt he must have gone white. “Mean anything to you?”
“Oh my god,” John breathed. His mind flashed to the children’s skeletons in the cellar. A look from Sherlock told him he was thinking the same.
They smiled warmly at each other and leaning back again on the couch. When they finally broke eye contact, Sherlock started giggling again.
Sherlock rolled his eyes way more dramatically than necessary, and furiously continued to make a mess of the living room on his hands and knees. Eventually, John took pity on the poor man.
But then Sherlock reached out and touched him, just around the middle, and he couldn’t help but gasp. Those hands alone sent an electric buzz through his whole body in an instant. They roamed the planes of his chest, sweeping over his pectorals, his ribcage, his waist. He could feel Sherlock taking everything in, nice and slow, memorizing every bump and curve of his body through his fingertips.
He turned another corner and every ounce of hope drained out of him. He had run straight into a dead end.
The more I thought of it the more extraordinary did my companion’s hypothesis, that the man had been poisoned, appear. I remembered how she had sniffed his lips, and had no doubt that she had detected something which had given rise to the idea. Then again, if not poison, what had caused the man’s death, since there was neither wound nor marks of strangulation? But, on the other hand, whose blood was that which lay so thickly upon the floor? There were no signs of a struggle, nor had the victim any weapon with which he might have wounded an antagonist. As long as all these questions were unsolved, I felt that sleep would be no easy matter.
In the following days the “Brixton Mystery” was splashed on every paper. I retain clippings of each account, which varied mostly in the social ill they placed the blame upon. Mankind continues to astound me with its ability to twist death and misfortune to its purpose. While I viewed the papers with distaste, Ms. Holmes took some amusement from them.
Embarrassed at my loss of composure I may have been, I knew Holmes required honesty from me tonight, so I did not shy away from my admiration. “It is wonderful! Your merits should be publicly recognized. You ought to be celebrated as the genius you are.”
“On entering the house this last inference was confirmed. My well-booted man lay before me. The tall one, then, had done the murder, if murder there was. There was no wound upon the dead man’s person, but the agitated expression upon his face assured me that he had foreseen his fate before it came upon him. Having sniffed the dead man’s lips I detected a slightly sour smell, and I came to the conclusion that he had had poison forced upon him. Again, I argued that it had been forced upon him from the hatred and fear expressed upon his face. By the method of exclusion, I had arrived at this result, for no other hypothesis would meet the facts.
Colonel Moran turned to the official detective. “You may or may not have just cause for arresting me,” said he, “But at least there can be no reason why I should submit to the gibes of this loathsome
Only I knew the truth. Irene Adler was the love of Sherlock Holmes’ life, torn from her by the very circumstances that brought them together. Never again would Holmes find a creature of unparalleled intellect who simultaneously inspired the flame of passion in her inhospitable heart. I would stand by, offering what companionship she would allow, and pray that my weak feelings would not impede her happiness in the future. It was all I could do for the woman who, through this misadventure, I recognized the depths of my adoration for at last.
“The reigning family of Holland,” Holmes told me. Her manner was bored, projecting that the matter was of no consequence. Yet I had been observing my friend for several years now. I could read in her infrequent looks to my direction, never landing upon my face, that there was more she was concealing from me. “A simple task, though delicate, that was concluded primarily through correspondence. This endeavor, on the contrary, shall require a fair bit of legwork!” This deft change of topic brought her gaze to mine, the zeal in her eye quite legitimate. “If you will be good enough to accompany me to the theater tomorrow, say five o’clock? I believe we might get started.”
“Apologies, ma’am,” He said, removing his hat, “I did not mean to stir up a fuss. I was only eager to rub Holmes’ nose in it.” That rude statement brought me short, and I eased into my seat by the fireplace.
After much cajoling, Stamford agreed to introduce us, so long as I did not hold him accountable if I found this lady to be in poor taste. Hospitals are familiar ground to me, between my brother’s brief medical foray and my own more extensive. I tread the narrow white-washed halls with confidence. Near the further end a low arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical laboratory.
It took several months of rooming with Ms. Holmes before I learned the nature of her business. During this time I focused my efforts on my own health, resolving not to be the sort of helpless invalid so many ladies choose to become. I would take walks to increase my strength, and when that fled me, retire to our rooms to read. I had always been a voracious reader, and thought I found company in Ms. Holmes, only to discover that her vast library was devoted to matters of science, law, and subjects so utterly specific as to offer little interest. There wasn’t a spot of poetry or fiction among her collection, so for my own needs I spent my spare shillings at the bookstore down the street.
“You come at a crisis, Watson,” said Holmes, without looking up at my entrance. “If this paper remains blue, all is well. If it turns red, it means a man’s life.” At that dire pronouncement, she dipped it into the test-tube, and it flushed at once into a dull, dirty crimson.
“Not at all.” Unwilling to leave the strange man, police though he may be, in our flat unsupervised, I pulled a nearby volume of poetry onto my lap. I opened it to the bookmark, and performed a display of reading, though my attention was consumed by the fidgeting Inspector.
“Never mind,” said she, with some vigor, “The question now is about hœmoglobin! What do you know on the subject?”
if you please,” muttered Holmes absently, surveying the room. I watched her eyes alight on the servant’s bell, and she leapt for it. Her fingernails scrabbled at the wall for a few futile moments before the panel gave way. I heard her inhale and mumble, “No.”
“Your colleague will inform you of the details,” Ms. Holmes waved him away, “Watson, my dear, I must test the lethality of these pills.”
I folded my hands in my lap. “In that case, I'm pleased Ms. Holmes’ estimation of the constabulary was wrong,” said I, for my friend had made her feelings plain. “Unfortunately, she is not in at the moment. I believe she is investigating.”
That night gave me the first flash of inspiration to record the truth in my journals. These journals, my case notes, my private love letters. I will shine light upon the stage she dances across for as long as she will keep me.
“Dunno, ma’am,” The maid answered. “This ‘un showed up on the list, rooms for cleaning, that is, ma’am.”
The fierce old man said nothing, but still glared at my companion; with his savage eyes and bristling moustache he resembled no less a tiger himself.
Rather than retrace our steps out the front, Holmes strode with purpose further inside, down steps to a side-door, and led me with a hand on my elbow through into an alley. It smelled strongly of manure, and I found the source at hand in a stable down the way. It was attached to the inn that shared a wall with the music hall. Holmes tapped her walking stick twice on a cobblestone then gestured down the alley.
“You make too much of a trifle,” said I. Although this man was physically unimposing, I was cautious of his interest, and very aware that we were alone. The cabinet concealing my revolver was a pace at my back, a comfortable anchor. “May I ask how you knew who I was?”
When my introspection had me so entangled, a light flared to life in the window I was set to watch. I stared as the profile of Irene passed the thin curtain: she was, I conceded, as lovely as Aphrodite, or Helen, or Godiva. Her features were round as a babydoll’s, with her hair cascading in tight waves that seemed to glide on air, the actor’s paint about her eyes and mouth bringing them sharply to the voyeur’s attention. My resolve nearly faltered, for how could our actions against so gentle a countenance be just, though to betray Holmes now would be the worst of sins. I held firm.
Following the interview of the officer, whom Ms. Holmes rudely declared to his face would never make it up the ranks, my health had reached its limit. I retired to Baker Street while Ms. Holmes departed for a concert, one Norman Neruda. Ms. Holmes had said, enigmatically, that she always sought to patron rare specimens of womanhood. Leaving me very alone, my mind was too much excited by all that had occurred to rest, and the strangest fancies and surmises crowded into it.
“Holmes, please!” I exclaimed aghast. Those violinist's fingers grasped reverently at my hem. She bowed her head, brushing faintly below my knee. “Whatever are you doing?”
“Wouldn't he? Moran may act untouchable, but the suspicion weighs heavy on his shoulders as the last to see Adair alive. It would take very little to turn the investigators preliminary questions into an outright overturning of his comfortable retirement. The full scrutiny of the law Moran knows he cannot withstand.”
“We need not discuss it, but you expressed interest in my methods, so there they are.” Ms. Holmes and I allowed the time to pass in silence whilst I collected my thoughts.
The door she slammed shut on their bewildered expressions. I expected her energy to persist, but instead Holmes seemed to harden to a statue, her head resting upon the cold wood. In the following quiet, my hand itched to grasp the revolver once more. I could sense my flatmate’s tension, her displeasure, and all of it I imagined directed at myself. Though there was no offense I could clearly point to that would explain it, I felt compelled to apologize.
So it was I rose from stoking the fire on stiff and creaking knees, to lay my aimless fingers upon the mantle. The picture frames, rather than preserving sketches or photographs of kin, held newspaper clippings of notable cases. Despite our housekeepers best efforts, my nails caught on droplets of candle wax from ample late nights. The damned skull grimaced up at me, one companion I ought to have divested myself of.
“Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed.” Seventeen steps, I resolved to remember, so that I might check her work and be sure she was not merely boasting to play a trick upon me. Invigorated by her point, Holmes reached to the table and tossed me a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open. “Since you are interested in these little problems, perhaps you may try your hand at this. It came at last post, read it.”
The string of expletives from the direction of the bathroom borders on thing's he'd never thought he'd hear Sherlock say. He was, in fact, the soldier of the two, and definitely had a harsher tongue than Sherlock, but Sherlock had been known to let slip a curse or two. This, however, was something else entirely. Before he can even be bothered to call over his shoulder to see if Sherlock was alright he hears his name being called from within the nonsensical babbling Sherlock was doing.
He gets up from his chair to sit on the floor next to the couch, right where Sherlock's head is laying. He runs his fingers through Sherlock's hair, undoing some of the straightening he had managed to do before. Sherlock grasps his other hand between both his own and brings them to hover just next to his lips. They have been doing this for far to long now for Sherlock's gentle side to surprise John, but it warms his heart just the same.
But John doesn't tell him not to, he doesn't tell Sherlock to leave, ever. Instead, he calls for the nurse to bring Sherlock an IV, still grasping firmly at Sherlock's hand. It's only once the nurse comes to hook the needles up that he releases Sherlock's hand with great reluctance. Sherlock, true to his word, doesn't leave his side once, and instead orders his brother to fetch things from their flat that he may need or want. On the second day, Mycroft himself appears, carrying Sherlock's violin.
John beams at this, and comes to lean up against Sherlock on the couch so that his head falls right on Sherlock's chest. It's his favorite way to sit, as he can peer up at Sherlock quite well, and he can hold Sherlock's long arms around his neck. John's compact frame fits quite nicely in the space left by Sherlock's gangly limbs, though Sherlock is quite adept at fitting himself snugly in John's lap when he wants to.
“Untie him, boys.” Two men cut Sherlock loose and hauled him forward.  Another one pulled John off of Moriarty and held him back by his arms.
But Jim. Jim had said he’d ensure Sherlock’s death at whatever cost, be it his own life. However, she thought the implication was that he’d somehow fake it. Not die for real, or just disappear for months on end. She didn’t know what to think.
Seven or eight bodies worth of bones came pouring out of the hole. All small. All children. Sherlock and John looked inside and saw another few down below, still trapped in the wall.
Sherlock grinned with smug satisfaction. “Come, John. We’re done here.” He pulled him towards the door. “We’ll leave this petty theft in the more than capable hands of the Detective Inspector, who has gone to the nice trouble of cleaning up his appearance for this investigation.”
He turned several corners and flew down many flights of stairs, hoping to throw them off, but they kept right on his tail. He was now deep into levels of the ship he had never explored before. He had no idea where he was or where he was leading them.
Sherlock glared at him for a second, but John could see the spinning wheels in his head cracking his angry façade. “I don’t want to keep you from something that you want. If that’s the life you want. Go get it. I mean it.” His words were just a bit softer than how he’d spoken before. The sincerity in his voice tugged at John’s heart, melting away all the remaining anger.
"It's only cash. Just a few dollars." He looked up at John, desperate for help but both he and Mrs. Hudson shrugged in mock-helplessness. Turning away from them, he scanned the flat for more ideas. He turned to the oven and grabbed the handle.
“I was supposed to give this to you over a candlelit dinner at Angelo’s. He stopped and faced Sherlock, handing him the bag. “It’s your present.”
He flew out of 221B, intending to find some darkened, isolated place where he could release his emotions and not return home until Sherlock would for sure be asleep.
At least there was plenty of room for both of them on the bed, John thought gratefully as he pulled their bags into the room.
They couldn’t brush this one under the rug. The dinner, the dancing, the club, their fight . . . they had been dancing around the edges of it for so long now, staying just back just far enough to be able to retreat at a moment’s notice. Not this time. It was time to talk. Well over time time to talk, in fact.
She waved her hand through the thick fog about her face. “It is not some miraculous feat. You usually tarry longer when the newborn is female, your fingers wrinkle with its bathing, and you linger with the mother, no doubt assuring her the child will be every bit as capable as the anticipated boy. When the child is male, you neaten your hair and overall appearance before announcing to the father and assorted relatives; but the joy you feel at a healthy wriggling girl is enough to make you forget yourself until after its needs have been seen to. Ergo, loose hairpins, wrinkled fingertips, and that little slip of ribbon peeking from your bag inform me that you have just heralded another young girl into this world.”
I chose then to speak up, “Inspector Gregson was telling me how he had the Brixton case all tied up.”
“When I reached the end, I stood at bay. He drew no weapon, but rushed at me and threw his long arms around me. He knew that his own game was up, and was only anxious to revenge himself upon me. We tottered together upon the brink of the fall. I have some experience with the art of wrestling, as you well know.”
Ms. Holmes smiled, a rare occurrence I was finding, approving and impressed at my efforts. “You sum up the difficulties of the situation succinctly and well,” She said. “There is much that is still obscure, though I have quite made up my mind on the main facts. As to poor Lestrade’s discovery it was simply a blind intended to put the police upon a wrong track, by suggesting Socialism and secret societies. It was not done by a German. The A, if you noticed, was printed somewhat after the German fashion. Now, a real German invariably prints in the Latin character, so that we may safely say that this was not written by one, but by a clumsy imitator who overdid his part. It was simply a ruse to divert inquiry into a wrong channel.” There was a lull, filled with the common London rabble and the bouncing of the cab, in which Ms. Holmes reached over and gave my forearm a brief squeeze. “I’m not going to tell you much more of the case, my dear Mrs. Watson. You know a conjurer gets no credit once he has explained his trick, and if I show you too much of my method of working, you will come to the conclusion that I am a very ordinary individual after all.”
“You must leave that to me. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?”
Holmes’ mouth curled into a sneer, as though I were a policeman she’d found contaminating a crime scene or a thickheaded witness. Certainly she had never directed that scorn at myself. It stung like salt.
“The instant that the Professor disappeared, before he had reached the bottom of the Reichenbach Fall, it struck me what an extraordinarily lucky chance Fate had placed in my way. I knew that Moriarty was not the only man who had sworn my death. There were at least three others whose desire for vengeance upon me would only be increased by the death of their leader. They were all most dangerous men, one or other would certainly get me. On the other hand, if all the world was convinced that I was dead they would take liberties, these men, they would lay themselves open, and sooner or later I could destroy them. Then it would be time for me to announce that I was still in the land of the living.
It was indeed like old times when, at that hour, I found myself seated beside her in a hansom, my revolver heavy in my handbag and the thrill of adventure in my heart. Holmes was cold and stern and silent. As the gleam of the streetlamps flashed upon her austere features I saw that her brows were drawn down in thought and her thin lips compressed.
“It depends on the player,” I answered. “A well played violin is a treat for the gods—a badly-played one—”
It was the opportunity I seized upon, allowing a note of disapproval to enter my tone, “For what do your clients seek you out?”
“Good. Come, Watson.” Striding past the royal, Holmes led our strange procession to the street, and gave directions to the King’s brougham. We clambered in to the grandest carriage I’ve ever seen in my life. The ride was awkward, myself and Holmes sat beside one another under the gaze of the Bohemian, yet made up for this fact by being short.
“It has been many years, Colonel.” Yet while I was aware I’d shown my age in wisps of gray, the same could not be said of Moran. Seeing him, I could clearly picture those burlap tents, smoke and heat itself rising thick, the blood of British and Pashtun lads still drying in the dunes, and myself pouring iced drinks as the Commanders congratulated themselves.
As he sank to the level of this opening, a slat of light from the street illuminated his eyes. They shone like stars, with a manic glee and malevolence, before he peered along the sights. I heard a little sigh of satisfaction as he cuddled the butt into his shoulder, and for an instant he was rigid and motionless. Then his finger tightened on the trigger. There was a strange, loud
“My dear Watson,” said the well-remembered voice, “I owe you a thousand apologies. I had no idea that you would be so affected.”
“What a remarkable coincidence,” said I, “That my bogey-man for so long should became a henchman for your archfoe.”
In truth, it hadn’t, not in the manner she implied. The distorted countenance of the deceased had been startling, and yet, I had witnessed mutilations of all kinds on the battlefield, and that was not what clouded my mind. I believe it was simple insecurity. For here was a fine specimen of womanhood, enthused with her work, and to whom no man could hold a candle. As for myself, I had nothing to offer Ms. Holmes in the way of intellect, nor a man as a spouse. The invitation into my friend's world left me more adrift than ever.
“Could you be mistaken?” I ventured in as kind a tone I could. “I truly doubt the Colonel would waste the bother on me.”
“Please, dear Jane,” Sherlock brushed off yet another inquiry as to the night ahead of us, “We have three years of the past to discuss. Let that suffice until half-past nine, when we start upon the notable adventure of the empty house.”
I pivoted to look at the cabinet. I had boxed up a few of the more painful reminders of my old flatmate, and noted the empty spaces he referred to. When I turned again, Sherlock Holmes herself was standing there smiling at me across our sitting room.
“My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago.”
. Ms. Adler took a deep bow followed by a curtsey done with an imaginary hem. She strode from the stage, for all the world as though fully dressed, as an assistant used a broom to gather the remains of her costume.
“I’m not kind in the least. You’ve noticed as much.” At her prompting, I conceded the point. “Shall we compare our observations, then?” She proposed.
“I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?”
My head spun from this revelation. That man, Lestrade, was from Scotland Yard, and frequently sought the help of Ms. Holmes in the resolution of his cases. It boggled me, frankly, and inspired me on behalf of my sex.
Perhaps I had finally reached my emotional limit, because I watched numbly as Sherlock drew back and gently rested her fingertips to her wet lips. Her oft-piercing gaze seemed feathered around the edges. Though I could muster no fear, I was dumb as I awaited her response.
The disappearance of my flatmate, friend, and love, the late Sherlock Holmes, had left me floating bereft through life.
“In full view of the lady herself? You marvel at my abilities, but even I am not so capable. No, I have made arrangements to return later tonight.”
I countered with her beloved logic, “The hospital breeds rats exclusively for experimentation. Go forth and find your proof there.”
“Mrs. Watson, meet Ms. Holmes,” Stamford introduced us, before making a show of checking his pocket watch. “I believe I have some business to attend to, you ladies converse. Mrs. Watson, do post me soon, won’t you?”
“Exactly. We are in Camden House, which stands opposite to our own quarters.” In spite of this assuredly being an empty house, the darkness inspired hushed voices in us both.
“Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.”
The piano took point once more and I began to realize my error: what easily passed for a tenor was in truth a contralto.
I pressed my hand to my brow. “My head is in a whirl,” I remarked, “The more one thinks of it the more mysterious it grows. How came these two men—if there were two men—into an empty house? What has become of the cabman who drove them? How could one man compel another to take poison? Where did the blood come from? What was the object of the murderer, since robbery had no part in it? How came the woman’s ring there? Above all, why should the second man write up the German word RACHE before decamping? I confess that I cannot see any possible way of reconciling all these facts.”
At that instant Holmes sprang onto the marksman’s back and carried him to the ground. He was up again in a moment, and with convulsive strength, he seized Holmes by the throat. She gagged, fingers scrabbling at his hold in a moment seared into my mind forever. Without thought, without fear, I struck him on the head with the butt of my revolver and he dropped again upon the floor, Holmes drawing audible, welcome breaths. I fell upon him, and bashed him again as my companion blew a shrill call upon a whistle. There was the clatter of running feet upon the pavement, and two policemen in uniform, with one plainclothes detective, rushed through the front entrance and into the room.
John's side hurts from how he is hovering over Sherlock still, so he sits slowly on the floor in the space between their two chairs, catching Sherlock's hand as he goes and tugs it gently to indicate that the other man should join him.
"Nothing quite so interesting, I'm afraid, though I doubt the world really needs a clone of me. There was a little boy, when I was in med school, none of his family were matches, and so my crew all ran the tests on ourselves to see if we were matches. He was only seven, and he wouldn't stop telling us how he planned to fly to the States to see his grandmother when he got better. How could I not help?"
"John, as we have discussed already, you almost died. Had I not been a match, had we been unable to find a donor in time, you would have died. Forgive me if I think that there may be a mental toll to that as well as the obvious physical one."
"Nonsense. That couldn't possibly be true when you're in the room with me half the time. You're absolutely radiant."
Sherlock hums in response, then screws up his face as he tries to puzzle out what he'd like to eat for dinner. He's long since abandoned trying to be nice and ask John what he would prefer. He knows it makes John far more happy to eat whatever it is that Sherlock wants if it will guarantee that Sherlock eats something.
"Even you can't tell what people are going to do all of the time. Sometimes people don't know they are going to do something until they do it, so how could you presume to guess? Besides, it's my job to stand by your side, and if protecting you is what gets me killed than it will be a noble death."
They don't discharge John for a week. He had been certain that by the third hour of sitting in a hospital room, Sherlock would have taken off, bored half to death. By the third day, John is watching him intently for any of the tells that show he's approaching a dangerous level of boredom. He's gotten quite good at recognizing Sherlock's 'if I don't have a bloody case within the hour I am going to purchase narcotics' face. But the moment never arrives. The entire week they spend in the hospital Sherlock never leaves his side and never once appears bored. It would appear that the nurses are more eager for Sherlock to leave than he is. He had, of course, been a menace the whole time, but mostly harassing everyone over things concerning John; was the wound healing fine, when would they be taking the stiches out, were they certain they were giving him the right medicine, were they changing John's IV regularly enough. Anyone could see that he was beyond worried, and John was touched, but it wouldn't be until they left the hospital that John could see just how worried Sherlock really was.
