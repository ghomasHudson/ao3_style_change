"That's good," John says, trying desperately to hide his smile. "There's a lot of farm land a few minutes out of town. You should check it out."
Mae's face fast, sadly. "That's terrible. I hate nightmares. I have ones about drowning or sometimes...I have ones about other kids bullying me," she admits, almost shyly. "What was yours about?"
Finally, a week later Sherlock's mobile buzzes. He's sitting on the hotel bed, browsing through the channels on the TV and when his phone buzzes beside him, he immediately picks it up. It's a text from John.
After a few minutes, John reappears holding two big blankets, a pillow and a pair of pajamas. He dumps them all onto the sofa and points at the clothes. "Those are for you," he says, sheepishly. "I'm not sure if they'll fit--after all, you're much taller than me--but I'm sure it'll work."
"It's alright," John says softly, turning to look at Sherlock. "She'll like you. She's very easy to talk to. I want you to meet her. I want you to be apart of her life."
Sherlock glances at John out of the corner of his eyes. He huffs. "They are not aggressive. Quite the opposite," he murmurs.
Sherlock quirks an eyebrow. He doesn't know where John is going with this. "Its only twenty minutes, John."
Inside, the smell of honey wafts through the air. A man stands in the kitchen, bent over the counter, carefully pouring honey into individual Mason jars. His hair is dark and curly and sticks out at all angles. He wears a dark blue dressing gown that billows out around him. His focus is unbreakable as he carefully pours the honey in each jar. Theres dozens of them, lined up against the back of the counter. Each one is tied with coloured ribbon and has a printed label on the side that says, "Holmes' Honey."
"You know, I wasn't lying when I said I thought about this everyday. I really did. I imagined if you showed up on my doorstep. Maybe you would come to the hospital and surprise me or bump into me on the street. Maybe you'd pretend to be a cab driver and put on a disguise. I imagined it in so many ways, so many scenarios but I never really thought it would happen," John speaks quietly. "I hoped for it everyday. I wanted it to happen so badly. I'm not religious but, Sherlock, I prayed for it. Up until yesterday really. And now that you're really here, I--" he cuts himself off, sighing. He leans forward and puts his tea down on the table. "Now that you're really here, I don't know what to do." Finally, John turns to meet Sherlock's eyes again. "I don't know what to say."
"Yes," Sherlock says, his voice a little hoarse. They stare each other down for a moment, not saying anything. Then, Sherlock decides its time to go. He moves to stand up. "I'd better get going."
"So, when would you like to come over? Mae and I, we go to the park every Friday after school and order pizza for dinner," John tells him. "Come join us."
Sherlock huffs. "I spent a lot of time with Mycroft over those twelve years. I rather think I've had enough." He grimaces. Mycroft was almost always the one to come to Sherlock's rescue. He would save him from being held captive or tortured and would watch over him, personally. He gave him medical assistance and ensured he was okay. Sherlock thinks back to a particularly grim time when his brother held him as he cried. It isn't a fond memory.
Mae regards them with a confused look. "I don't get it. You lived together...but why are you friends?"
In the dream, Sherlock frantically brushes his hands on John's body. "John, what happened? Let me help you!"
There's and awkward moment where no one knows what to say next. John comes to the rescue. "Sherlock's gonna accompany us to the park today and he's going to have pizza with us later. Sound good?"
"Yeah." John presses his lips together. "I don't like to think about it much. But...Sherlock if we're going to give this a try--you know being friends again--you're going to have to meet Mae sometime or another."
A few minutes later, they arrive at the park. Mae runs off to go on the swings and Sherlock and John find a bench to sit at and watch her.
"She's asleep," John announces as he comes into the room. He plucks the wine glasses and wine bottle from the coffee table and deposits them in the kitchen. Then he comes back into the room and stands before Sherlock with his hands on his hips. "That was good wine."
"Shouldn't you have some sort of protection on?" John's voice slides through the air and Sherlock jumps. He turns around. The other man is standing sort of awkwardly. His hands are stuffed in his pockets and he's put on a backwards baseball cap since they last talked. "Sorry for scaring you."
Sherlock nods. "Okay." John smiles at him. It's less real than the others they've shared that day and Sherlock can see the emotion behind it but he returns it anyways.
Worked long and hard on this one. I hope you guys enjoy it! Chapters may come slower since I just started school but I won't abandon this!
Sherlock spends the next few days in London. He wanders around, going to Regent's Park and eating at the restaurants him and John used to eat at. Eventually, he decides to visit the others he left behind. First, he stops by Angelo's. The man faints of course but is happy to see him after he recovers. He fills Sherlock up with pasta and Sherlock let's him. Next, he pops in to see Lestrade. Lestrade is shocked and almost falls over but much to Sherlock's surprise he wraps his arms around him and squeezes him tightly. He sees Molly at the morgue who cries and hugs him, too. He visits Mrs. Hudson at Baker Street. She tears up and hugs him but tells him that she always knew he was out there somewhere. Sherlock doesn't go into 221B. The memories are too painful.
"So," John starts, pouring himself a second glass of wine. "What are you going to do next? What's your next project?"
Also, I know I completely switched tenses in this chapter. I'm really bad with that but I'm going to try and stick with present tense for the rest of the story. Sorry if that's annoying. Present tense just seemed to fit the story better.
John smiles. A few minutes later, they pull into the school's parking lot. "You can just wait outside of the car. I'll go and get her."
"Of course!" John says, cheerily. He smiles at Sherlock. "Though I don't think you'll want to sleep in your nice trousers and everything. I may have some PJs you can borrow. Hold on. Let me go get everything. Stay here."
The house is very large, almost castle-like. Its several hundred years old and sits on a plot of flat land with a small forest in the back. The property goes on for acres and acres and the lane way leads to a dirt road without another house for miles. To the side of the house, a large greenhouse sits and past that, there's an impressively sized apiary. The house is quiet and lonely inside. There's a large sitting room and an impressive kitchen. The dining room consists of a long, wooden table and an intricate chandelier. There's one large master bedroom and several guest bedrooms. The house is old, the wooden floor creaks and the doors groan.
"I made tea. Lets sit down," John says, breaking the silence that had fallen between them. Sherlock follows him into the sitting room and they sit on the sofa together. They both take a sip of their tea, avoiding each other's eyes. Sherlock chances a look at John. The hand that's not holding the tea shakes badly. The tremor has returned and Sherlock can't deduce whether it came back after the fall or if it has just come back with his own arrival.
“Although it is not actually from me but my brother and I believe these cases demand something a bit more...” John doesn’t know what to expect and so is innocently relaxed. As Sherlock talks he walks closer to where John is sitting, his voice sinking to its lowest register and John finds himself inexplicably trembling, “...personal,” Sherlock finishes as he comes up and stands in front of John, knees touching lightly.
Sherlock let go of his arm and began undoing his belt and buttons. John looked helplessly on, trapped in his own body, as Sherlock uncovered him, pushing cloth to the side, away and down. He thought he was going to choke as long, delicate, white fingers closed around him and a quiet moan escaped his lips, even though he pressed them together so hard it hurt, as Sherlock slowly started to stroke him up and down, his movement confident and deft.
John could only grin back, huge, from ear to ear. He couldn’t have stopped for the life of him. He stroked away the hair hanging down into Sherlock’s eyes, tracing a line down his cheek.
A dark car came to a stop in front of him, a toned window rolled down and Sherlock nodded towards the driver. The back door opened and he got in, closing it behind him. As the car smoothly drove away, out from the curb and joined the morning traffic he looked out the window as streets floated by. It all seemed terribly dull. An image of John came unbidden to him, superimposed over his retinas, John lying on the sofa, lips wet and kissed and Sherlock’s breath caught and a pang of longing surged in his stomach.
Twelve years. It had been exactly twelve years since Sherlock disappeared. Since he jumped from the building and vanished from John's life. Twelve years since Sherlock died. He didn't really but to the rest of the world he had. The only other person who knew was Sherlock's brother Mycroft. In those twelve years Sherlock put his entire being into disbanding Moriarty' web. He travelled through Europe and through the Middle East. He sacrificed so much just to get rid of Moriarty and to keep his loved ones safe. And now he was back. Moriarty had finally been defeated and Sherlock was making his return back into the world. Nobody knew yet but they would soon.
John laughs. Sherlock looks at him and they share a smile. John turning towards him and resting his head in his hand. The day was a success.
John closed his eyes, considering it. Then, miraculously he opened the door and stepped aside for Sherlock to come in. Sherlock stepped in and surveyed the house. It was a standard suburban home, only slightly smaller. The sitting room was to the left and the kitchen was to the right. There was a door at the back which lead to a bathroom and a flight of stairs which led to the bedrooms. The colour palette of it was neutral and there wasn't much decorating. Some kids drawings were displayed on the fridge and there were a few toys strewn about on the floor. On the kitchen counter, a small fish tank sat with a beta swimming around happily. There was also a plate with a sandwich sitting on it.
Sherlock watched carefully. John's daughter raced up to him and they embraced, happily. John took his daughter's backpack and swung it on one shoulder as they began walking towards the parking lot. John's daughter looked strikingly like him. She had his smile and his nose and as far as Sherlock could tell for an eight year old girl, she would have his height too. Sherlock couldn't really tell from afar but he swore she also had his bright, warm eyes, too. The only thing that wasn't from John was her long, dark brown hair. Sherlock watched the pair as they moved further and further from his sight, continuing on towards the car that was parked. They smiled at one another and John laughed at whatever story she was telling him. Sherlock closed his eyes and began to walk away. He couldn't bear to watch for much longer. He needed to do something. He needed to hear John's voice, to see his face up close. So, he decided he would reveal himself the very next day.
Sherlock's heart pangs and John's word sting. He looks out across the park where Mae has moved onto the play structure. She laughs, going down the slide and races back up to do it again. This is John's daughter. This is his life. Maybe coming here was a bad idea...
"That's very unlike you," John says. "You must be bored. You're really not going back into detective work?"
As they start to make the venture back home, Sherlock feels guilty. John has been showing him around the town all day and Sherlock already knows most of it. He stuffs his hands in his pocket.
The next day when Sherlock arrives at John's house, things already seem more comfortable between them. John makes them egg salad sandwiches and they sit at the small table to eat them. John tells Sherlock about the hospital he works at and some of the staff there. He tells him about the town itself and the neighbors he dislikes. The conversation is easy, if still a little tense. When they finish eating, Sherlock watches as John washes up the dishes.
"Why don't you just stay with your brother?" John asks. "Much better accommodations, I can imagine."
"Well," Sherlock clears his throat. "They were all shocked. I got a lot of hugs," he grimaces and John laughs. "Even Lestrade. Mrs. Hudson told me she knew all along."
The man, Holmes -- Sherlock Holmes -- brushes his curly hair out of his eyes and continues working. His nose is scrunched up in concentration as he makes sure the honey doesn't drip down the side of the jar. Suddenly, there's a loud, shrill ringing that cuts through the air. Sherlock jumps and the honey spills a little. He sighs, setting the honey down and walking over to the phone, which hangs on the wall in the kitchen. He picks it up and holds it to his ear.
"Was it scary?" She asks. Sherlock really doesn't want to talk about it but she's just a little girl and he can't bear to break down in front of her or be rude to her.
"Woah, woah, woah," John says. He moves forward and puts his hands out to stop Sherlock. "You're not driving home. We've both been drinking."
"Listen," John starts. "I'm sorry for...snapping at you. Its just hard for me...those first years were really scary. I didn't know how to cope. I wasn't taking care of myself."
"Hi," John greets, awkwardly. "You can take your shoes off. Let me take your coat and--and your gloves."
"Yes well, I'm sure he'll be a good fit here," Sherlock says, then to John, "Why don't you grab the rest of your luggage?"
John closed his eyes and rested his head against the door. "Its not you," he cried. "I won't believe it. Do you know--do you know how hard it was? I grieved you, I mourned you. Everyday I think to myself what I would do if you came back. I kept believing that one day you'll show up here and now here you are... It was so hard and--and now you're here...please just go away. I don't want to see you."
"Yes. I know about your daughter. Even if I didn't see you at the school, I could have easily deduced it when I stalked through your front door. Or by the way you carry yourself, the clothes you wear--"
He sighs and puts the note away rising to gently put the expensive sweater down before deciding that this was as much as he could take in a single day and goes to bed.
It was lunch hour so Sherlock was all alone, the staff normally milling about in the Scotland Yard morgue was off somewhere eating and laughing together, something he was grateful for. No one to disturb him, just him and the dead.
In the end John ends up making them egg on toast while Sherlock gets degraded to making tea. They eat in silence, John reading a newspaper. Sherlock doesn’t even try to start a conversation and every time John’s eyes glide away from the neat rows of text and on to Sherlock, which is a habit so old he has no idea how to stop it, he finds Sherlock looking back at him. Just looking, face blank and calm; it makes John immensely nervous. He has no idea what to do with it and it makes him feel strangely vulnerable.
After a small, black painted hallway he entered a more dimly lit and quieter part. Music still streamed out of hidden speakers but it was slower, less aggressive and the bar less occupied. The ceiling was low giving a small and cramped feeling and no one was dancing. Instead people stood in small clusters talking or lounging on big sofas. He slowed down; eyes trying to see in every direction at once, but the place looked like a maze; pillars and walls making it impossible to get an overview. He started off in a random direction, swearing to himself, how was he supposed to find the man in this?
“It is Mycroft bearing gifts as usual this time of year, I never open them.” He stands abruptly, in one of those sudden bursts of raw energy he sometimes extrudes. He studies the package with a look of utter distaste and then walks towards his room, shrugging of his coat and leaving it in a wet pile on the floor as he crosses the room.
John looked at the men and women, they all had the same grim, determined look about them and something in how they held themselves told John they were not police.
thought John, stomach fluttering, as he observed Sherlock’s long fingers play in the air to a tune only he could hear, his forehead slightly creased in concentration as he began to explain just what it was that he had missed.
He felt better. No, not better, never better. But there was something occupying the emptiness now, a sense that he would be able to make it another day. And after that there was always another day, and another. For Sherlock’s sake he would keep on like he had so far.
“This is not my umbrella,” Sherlock answered and John could have sworn he was teasing him with that almost smile on his lips and was on the verge of simply walking away and leaving Sherlock in his mess when he sneezed again.
Sherlock drags his fingers over the cover, following the lines in the oxblood coloured leather. John fidgets nervously in his chair whishing Sherlock would say something and eventually he can’t contain himself, “Do you like it? You hate it right?” He continues without allowing Sherlock any time to respond.
He was hard in his trousers, dark grey wool stretched and not enough pressure. He edged around until he was lying on top of John on the too short sofa, their bodies pressed flushed against each other.
“Where did you go?” John asked and he immediately regretted it after the words had been said. Surely he should have been able to think about something better, something less accusative.
John looked around and realized the patches were on the coffee table, closer to Sherlock than him, “Get them yourself, I am working.”
Hands, strong and delicate flew over the strings and bow. To John’s ears he seemed to torture the poor Stradivarius but Sherlock had ensured him it was supposed to sound like that. He couldn’t tell but he felt like Sherlock had his eyes closed, face serene as he played.
“He is our killer as I am sure you understand by now,” Sherlock said and looked at John, searching for a reaction of some sort.
Changed? John stayed quiet; normally Lestrade was closemouthed to talk about Sherlock from before John’s time.
A small, dry little man opened the door, all corduroys and woollen sweater. Sherlock showed one of Lestrade’s stolen badges in his face.
Today it was about how young people today lacked respect for the elderly, something he was quite sure wasn’t really anything which had changed all that much, it was just something young people didn’t notice until they were old themselves and therefore assumed had been better in the past. Interrupting her was, however, not a good idea, and she was just lonely after all.
When it all came down to it John’s life had not stopped. The world had not stopped. Somehow that was the worst of it; it felt like a betrayal deep down in his guts. An awkward stiffness in his soul that would not let him be. He just kept on living, working, eating, making tea; one day after another.
Next year, he repeats in his own head, trying to force his body in on the deal, it is such an unwanted complication in John’s life, this whole light-headedness and breathlessness which afflicts him around Sherlock.
Nothing had happened? John looked over at Sherlock as he threw away the wig, muscles playing under the skin of his still naked torso. He was giving steady instructions to the driver through the metal grid that separated the two compartments. John took hold on one of the handles hanging from the roof as the van rolled into motion. He watched Sherlock’s profile trying to untangle a very strange sensation in his stomach.
John nodded and mumbled something in agreement, his mind busy with other things. Just before Mrs Smith had arrived Sherlock had texted him, telling him not to wait up. John pondered what he could have planed which he was not telling him about. Something was going on; he felt it so bad he could taste it.
Inside the flat it was empty. He was too late. He had tried John’s phone on the way, but no one had picked up.
“And you did not report this to this to the police?” The look in Sherlock’s eyes could have started forest fires in India during the monsoon period.
Sherlock trusted him completely John realized and it made his insides twist in a weird mix of guilt and pride, that a creature like Sherlock had that sort of faith in him, when he had not reciprocated that trust.
“Anyway I am stalling, me and Peter were out together on this scouting mission. Just in case anyone needed medical attention.  What we found was...”
John couldn’t take his eyes away from Sherlock’s hands; seeing his hands on him was driving him mad. Sherlock rubbed his thumb gently over the head every time he neared the tip, before stroking him all the way to the root. John felt each stroke as it brought him closer to the edge, he tried to fight it. He didn’t want it to end this fast but it was to no avail.
John mumbled something non consequential while refusing to meet Sherlock’s eyes. He ate the rest of his food in silence and afterwards he pushed the plate away while turning to look out the window; outside darkness was settling early like a heavy blanket over the city. The days were still growing shorter as they neared the winter solstice.
“If you would just stop and listen,” She shook her head and muttered something that surely wasn’t a bad word? “I have the address you see, the one he ordered the cabby for.”
There was a smell in the air, Sherlock’s nostrils flared as he tried to place the fragrance. Magnolia he thought. A lady’s perfume he realised a second later. As he approached the desk; the chair swirled around revealing a familiar dark haired woman.
John dropped the towel on the floor and for a second lost in thought, his fingers did what they wanted to on their own accord. They reached out and carefully stroked away that stubborn lock of wet hair plastered to Sherlock’s forehead.
“We want you to track him down. That information was just a teaser if you will. If you agree we will give you the rest,” Sara opened her briefcase again and brought out the paper clad package that Sherlock had seen the same woman give the man in Hyde Park some days past.
He backed up, gently removing his hand; it felt tingly like residual electricity dancing in his fingers.
In his own way Sherlock was grateful to John, he felt that he owed him and not only for saving his life over and over. In his experience people didn’t do good things for you without wanting something back. John had shown him a glimpse of something else. This was the thing at risk, Sherlock thought; he dared not risk this, not for anything. He broke people, he would not break John. He shook himself, quickly stepping backwards and closing the door, blocking his view of the sleeping man.
The team lead by Lestrade wouldn’t find anything, he was sure of it. But on the other hand it could not hurt to cover all bases so to speak. It was not petty revenge for having had to wait for backup or the ridiculous codenames.
Sherlock looked so cold, lips a sort or blue, grey shade, slim shoulders shaking involuntary from the cold. But as John’s fingers made contact with his forehead, for John, he seemed to be hotter than a furnace.
He could feel the words coming out off-key and stilted. He had not known that was what he was going to say until he had. He was no child hoping for a miracle and he did not allow himself to ever feel hope. Hope, Sherlock would have said, was for the faint of mind; believe or do not, never hope. Maybe today was different though, maybe sometimes you could allow yourself to simply wish for the impossible; when you needed it the most.
John saw the blood, as black as the insides of eyelids pooling out and seeping into the hard ground, darkening the sand, making it shine like obsidian.
“Mr Holmes, how good of you to join us,” She smiled and nodded like he was a long expected quest arriving from the front door in the middle of the day.
“There is something not quite right here,” Sherlock took a step back from the wall ignoring the police. He spun on his heel taking in the entire scenery. From the body on the floor to Lestrade’s unkept appearance and John’s worried but strangely distant gaze.
“Ok,” was the only thing Sherlock said. John was sure he felt that he was holding back, lying even but he had never been more grateful that he didn’t ask. He wasn’t ready. He would never be ready.
Lestrade had been pleased beyond words and Sherlock had been smugger than usual. He had wanted to go out, eat and celebrate their victory, which he enthusiastically had ensured would not have been possible without John. He said this and clasped John’s shoulder, long fingers leaving burn marks through his clothes.
He took his time and when he came back, balancing a tray with two cups and the blue and white china pot his sister had bought for him as a sort of ‘forgive me’ present three years ago for breaking his old one, Sherlock had moved into a proper sitting position and even unfolded the towel and made a half hearted attempt at wrapping it around his own shoulders.
He pulls the man over him, holding him tight as he presses them flush. There are some moments of moaning and reciprocal grinding, breaths hot and lips sliding slick against each other before Jon flips them around and with shaking hands undress Sherlock in full. His erection is as pale as the rest of him, lying flush against his stomach. John eagerly grabs the smooth length and slides his thumb gently across the head smearing out the perfect drop of pre-come resting there.
John was lying on the sofa, limbs all stretched out and a bag of ice pressed to the lump on his forehead. Sherlock stood aimlessly in the middle of the room, feeling like he should do something but not sure what.
The previous night he had not dreamt at all and when he had woken up he had felt nothing; neither sad nor happy. Not angry or content but completely empty. Maybe the world knew that this day of all days was bad enough as it was, he did not need to remember his dreams to make it worse.
He looked around, eyes searching, and he found a rusted knife sticking out from the middle of a pile of newspapers. He pulled it out and cut away the straps of the vest, butchering it completely. He worked swiftly, he was an army doctor and this was what he did best.
He ignored the rough carpet and the sharp piece of gravel under his shoulder blade, the only thing that mattered was this fragile thing here between them. Pain was inconsequential he thought, pleasure was not the point. The point was something else, more fundamental; closeness, fulfilment, pledging, a promise made in flesh.
“It is not ok John, I failed. It will not happen again,” That had been too much he thought as John looked at him strangely. He needed to keep calm, for them both.
“You are the ones who kidnapped John, why would I trust you?” Sherlock let some of the anger from earlier be heard in his voice, making it sharp as steel. He was deadly serious and he wanted her to know it. It was also precisely what she would expect from him. She had expected him here tonight and so she knew he would figure out they had been responsible behind John’s disappearance, had most likely planed it. If he was lucky enough she didn’t realise that he had figured out why.
Two police officers fell in beside him and Sherlock as they started out. One was Tessa, the tall blond officer from John’s rescue.
To his left in a small ally he saw the man throw himself hurriedly into the back door of a black Mercedes. Umbrella discarded haphazardly on the wet sidewalk.
He watches Sherlock turn the gift over and admire the garish paper, he smiles with only half his mouth at it and John thinks that, yeah, he got it. He looks at John quizzically and John laughs, “Open it while it’s still Christmas you twat!”
Sherlock obeyed, sitting up and letting John peel the coat off him. As John’s fingers brushed over his shoulders he could feel that he was drenched to the bone, his body shivering from the cold.
“Friends,” John agreed and shook Sherlock’s outstretched hand trying to ignore the tight feeling in his chest. Sherlock was right of course, this was for the best, no complications.
“No, apparently not,” was Sherlock’s reply. He looked at him, an unreadable look in his eyes. John tried to push further into the wall to increase the distance between them, when had Sherlock backed him into the wall anyway? He froze when he suddenly felt a hand gently at the front of his trousers, his mouth fell open in shock and he stared blankly in front of him as Sherlock’s hand slowly stared to caress his already afflicted state.
John frantically forced his fists to close, fingernails digging little half-moons of pain into his palms as he tried to fight what his body was doing to him. His heart was beating frantically in a mixture of dread and excitement as his starved body drowned in Sherlock’s.
Sherlock froze and spun around towards Lestrade, gripping his shoulders with both hands, almost shaking him, “The bridge is what?”
“Well it depends on what you mean by suspicious,” He hurriedly continued in a voice straining to be ingratiating, “At 8.16 there was this man who got pushed into the boot of a car.”
He felt the hard, cold weight of the gun pressing against the skin in the small of his back. How could it feel safe and yet dangerous, he wondered idly while chewing the inside of his lip.
“Yes off course, that is why we are here after all.” Sherlock had to lean down to scream in John’ ear to be heard over the pounding music.
“It is a bloody dog Sherlock, just a normal smelling, slightly scruffy dog.” He was surprised to hear that his own voice could be so calm when he felt like a whirlwind was trying to remodel his insides. He had a sinking feeling when he looked at Sherlock’s slim but powerful figure that things might just have gotten infinitely more complicated between him and his roommate.
He is mad, John thought, he has completely lost his mind. He had seen it before he realized, that day, but he had been too upset himself to be able to help anyone else. He had told his superiors what happened as they got back and they had asked no further. Peter had been recommended to go home, with a firm hand they had stated that England had better need of him at home. He had protested, come to John and screamed, calling him a liar and traitor, when John had only wanted to help him. That day the same madness had glinted in his eyes, but John had contributed it to the stress and the prior events.
Finally! Sherlock clicked the safety off the gun and mentally counted to five and then sprang into action. He thought he heard someone swear behind him but he was sure the cretins would follow him anyway, he might have been ordered to bring backup but they had been ordered to keep him safe.
John looked as Sherlock stored away his violin, hands stroking lovingly over the old wood as he put it in its case and a hole Watson didn’t even know he had inside him grew a little more.
“Do you have a Christmas present for me?” Sherlock asks and it is nonchalant, sudden and perhaps meant to be accusatory. However there is something in his tone which does not sit right with John.
“I, I got it from Mycroft, a Christmas present,” he says truthfully as he wonders quietly how Sherlock will take that little piece of information. Will he realize this is what had been in the package?
Sherlock seemed to regain some of his normal carefree air; he threw himself down in a chair and spoke up again.
“And here I was thinking we were out dancing,” John said and took the opportunity to rid himself of the horrible beverage. When he turned back Sherlock was looking at him quizzically.
He let his gaze stop at John, studying him intently, from the blond curls on his head and weather beaten looks to dark blue button down and brown leather shoes. Here, Sherlock idly thought as so many times before, is the greatest mystery of them all. John should be freaking out, yet he was not.
“Just get away from me, get away,” His voice was high pitched at the end as he pushed himself off the wall and walked away. He had to get away or he had no idea what would happen. He walked, or practically ran out of the ally, hands showed deep down into his pockets, his shoulders tense and pulled up under his ears. He had to get somewhere, anywhere away from Sherlock and the crazy things he was doing to him.
In those early grey hours of the morning he had vowed to himself to never think about this entire unfortunate event again. He was just overreacting, a result from being tired and lightheaded from not eating enough. After all, it had meant absolutely nothing.
As he stopped just inside the doors a, “Team Doyle is in the nest, repeating team Doyle is in the nest,” behind him confirmed that he had been correct.
At the next pass Sherlock finally spotted something, an anomaly which didn’t fit the pattern. With two rubber clad hands he gently spread the dead man’s toes and there it was. At a passing glance it looked like a birth mark between the second and third toe. If it hadn’t been for both corpses sharing the same birthmark in the exact same place, the odds for that was about 1:1357000 and therefore highly unlikely Sherlock concluded.
“What is it, are you hurt,” Sherlock looked at him, concern shoving on his face but how could John explain what was ailing him.
Sherlock threw a glance at John and it seemed he was trying to say: don’t worry, I have this under control.
When John reached the address it was just an empty warehouse, cracked, red brick walls and boarded up windows. He tried to read the old painted letters on the wall but they were to worn for him to make it out. In the last second he remembered to let the cabby pass and drop him of a block away, Sherlock would have been proud.
“I don’t sleep much during cases and you know it, too much to do, too many puzzles to solve. Now will you stop bothering me,” He snatched the pen back and drew an arrow and then took a step back to look at the picture but clearly didn’t like what he saw. He threw the pen at Lestrade, “No, no, no this is not it.”
“Sherlock, who are they and what are they doing,” John’s voice pitched and he looked from Sherlock, to Sara to Peter whom was being carried out by two large men. One he could now have sworn was the one who had tried to break his skull with a cricket bat not that long ago. As he stared the man smiled menacingly at him, showing rows of yellow teeth.
“Because we found this on him,” Lestrade looked almost apologetic as he handed something over to Sherlock, hidden from where John was crouching over the corpse, further down the river bank.
He looks at the package again and thinks that it would be a real waste to throw it away; he can always open it and then try to sneak whatever object it contains into Sherlock’s possession. He hangs Sherlock’s coat up and then grabs the package and leaves for his own room.
If he had thought his head hurt before it was nothing compared to the steady thundering headache he was sporting now. His mouth and throat was so dry he couldn’t swallow anymore and the sack over his head made his entire face itch from the rough canvas. His hands were tied to his back and he had stopped feeling his fingers long ago although the pain in his arms from the strain was now competing with his head.
Everything was brown, grey and beige, those winter colours melding into a profile of rolling hills. In the midst of it all was a railway track, cutting a scar through the landscape. It was so human it felt strangely out of place in the cold morning. Tendrils of fog curled around everything, even here between him and Sherlock, making the other man seem farther away than he was, like light years separating the two.
Sherlock stood there for a minute, considering his sleeping friend. John looked more peaceful in his sleep than he had in a long while.
Sherlock didn’t answer his question. Instead he let the fingers of his hands meet up in a pyramid closing his eyes, “Can you throw me a new packet of nicotine patches John.”
“Life is short Sherlock, and dangerous. I can’t swear to anything but I can promise you this: I will not leave you if I can help it.” John got up from his chair as he talked, feeling like he had finally come to a decision and that he was saying these things as much to himself as to Sherlock.
“John?” Sherlock asked and John was suddenly transported forward in time, from unbearable heat, from a place where dust ate into everything to a rainy December London.
“I suppose that is something normal people would do,” Sherlock answered letting his gaze fall on the grey miserable rain falling outside the window.
It felt like hours before he could calm his breathing down and he had to close his eyes to stop the world from spinning. Sherlock gave him time and when his breathing was back to normal untangled himself from John’s hold. He pulled out a handkerchief and proceeded to calmly wipe his hand before offering it to John.
“Mr Holmes, Doctor Watson,” She nodded curtly at them and thereafter she looked everywhere else but at them, restless eyes scanning for threats.
Sherlock collected himself and the umbrella and decided to walk back home. Maybe a proper stretch would clear his head.
And now here they were. John pulled his shoulders up to his ears, trying to keep warm.  The large red brick building ahead was placed at the edge of a London suburb. They had left the sprawl of fish-and-chip places and charity shops a while back. Out here it was all old looking stone houses and fields.
“Yes of course,” The second time it came out a bit more believable and he even nodded with it. Of course he was fine, after all nothing had happened.
It had been exactly 13 days, 13 hours and three quarters since Holmes had laid his hands on Watson. Not that John was keeping a tally.
“Your breathing is labored, you heartbeat increased. Much more than the caffeine should have caused and you are warm, I would say half a degree over your normal body temperature, not fever but still hot.”
He finds himself fidgeting with the collar of his sweater, pulling it up further as if the wool could somehow shield him from Sherlock’s intense gaze, his mouth feels dry and for some reason it does not occur to him to confront Sherlock. As he fidgets with his jumper he can see Sherlock turning his head to the side and suddenly eyeing him strangely; suspicion growing on him so obvious it is like watching a cartoonish grey cloud build up over his head.
Dawn was hinting over the horizon, promising warmer weather than this. But right now it was cold and frost was covering the few green straws of grass still left, defying the winter.
A sudden pain in his leg made him flinch; he looked down and realized that he was digging his nails into his thigh so hard that he had drawn blood through the fabric; small half-circles of darkness against the heavy duty cotton.
As if for good measure Peter hit Sherlock over the head a second time, Sherlock hardly responded this time, just sank to the floor drooping against the wall, to pained to move or simply unconscious.
In minutes his hair was soaked through and lying flat against his skull and he could feel the damp slowly but surely creeping in through the leather of his shoes. As he crossed the last intersection, entering the right side of Baker Street he suddenly stopped dead in his tracks.
Sherlock picked up the photo; on it was a man in his forties, short hair and a nose which clearly had been broken at one point. Sherlock was hit with a brief flash of a memory, the same man, a sneer on his face which Sherlock had not registered at the time. In the microsecond it took for Sherlock’s brain to get up to speed he relived the moment as he pushed a bald mailman out of the way in his haste to find John.
Like this, soaked to the bone and brooding, he looked almost vulnerable. How someone so brilliant at the same time could seem so clueless about other things, like keeping dry when it was raining, was a mystery to John.
It is just, he thinks and realises in a detached way that he is staring again, that Sherlock looks so disarming right now, hair wild from bed, standing in all directions and feet naked on the cool floor. He looks so normal and, god John is so totally and utterly lost, sweet. Right now no one could guess that he is maybe a sociopath and definitely the most brilliant man in all of Great Britain.
John leaned his forehead against the bus window. The glass was cool and soothing against his bare skin. Outside London rolled by at a slow rambling pace. Afternoon traffic had hit the streets and the red double decker bus crept forward. He saw bicycle couriers flash by, waterproof bags strapped to their backs, and people on foot overtaking his buss.
He unfolded it and read: “Merry Christmas John Watson. From Father Christmas.” The note had a little bell and a holly leaf printed on it and the ‘Merry Christmas’ part and ‘From’ was pre-printed, on the empty, dotted lines someone had written his name and Father Christmas with a green pencil.
Eventually she walked away from crowded streets of central London and stroke up on a path into Hyde Park; here Sherlock had to be more careful. The rain had changed into slate, mixed by feet into a grey slush on the ground and the park was almost empty with the exception of a red-faced man walking with those ludicrous sticks and a couple jogging. Sherlock slowed down; letting the woman get a head start before he himself entered the open grass lawns of the park.
John should be used to it by now, the not eating; instead it always came as a reminder how different Sherlock was. How dissimilar from himself. John started on his food, letting Sherlock do his thinking in peace.
After the bad guys had been loaded into trucks hh and Sherlock had been driven to the hospital in a waiting ambulance, apparently Lestrade had argued that with Sherlock you never knew. After a brief check-up and some bandages to keep Sherlock’s broken ribs in place which he had tried to insist he didn’t need, they had joined the others here where food had been waiting on them, John ate as if he hadn’t seen a morsel of nourishment in days.
As he ran back outside, feeling like a hole was burning in his chest, the sound from the sirens on at least three separate police vehicles reverberated from building to building. The cacophony filled his head preventing him from thinking, he shouted at the police officers to be quiet. They were too late anyway, too late to protect John. He spun round and round on his heels, eyes scanning every direction, arms outspread, working through every detail.
The fluorescent light in the ceiling flickered and it seemed like the walls were shaking slightly from the loud music pounding in from the gym outside. The body, as the one before, was a nondescript middle-aged man; he wore a similar cheap suit and no form of identification.
Then one second John was on top and his arm free, he pulled his gun and brought it down, grip first, with all the strength he had over Peter’s head. It impacted with a nauseating thud and the man grew instantly limp beneath him.
"I think...well, I think I'm rather finished with detective work," Sherlock admits. He grips his teacup with both hands.
Sherlock's eyes widened. He took a step closer and John took one back. He pushed the door between them. "Go away," he snarled, through gritted teeth. "I don't want to see you ever again."
After waiting for a 10 minutes, John finally arrived back at home, his daughter no longer with him. It was his day off. Sherlock watched as he disappeared through the door, waited a few minutes, then crossed the street towards the house. He slowly walked up the steps of the house and stood in front of the door. He sucked in a breath, his gloved fist poised in the air, ready to knock. He had never been more nervous for anything in his life. He had also never been more excited. Without thinking too much about it, Sherlock knocked.
"I guess so. We chased down a few criminals in our day. Caught a few thieves, murderers," Sherlock tells her.
"Oh. That's okay, a bit creepy but I don't mind," he pauses, taking a deep breath before continuing. "You saw me then, at the school?"
"It is me," Sherlock whispered. He snaked his fingers towards John and rested his fingertips lightly on John's knee. "It's me."
"You can go change. The bathroom's just there," John tells him, pointing behind him to a closed door. "I hope its comfortable. If you need anything...just holler." Its awkward for a moment between them. John isn't sure if he should say anything more and Sherlock sways in his spot. "Well...goodnight. See you in the morning."
"Holmes' Honey," he speaks. "Oh, hello Stamford." He goes quiet for a moment, listening to the voice on the other line. His eyebrows raise suddenly, with surprise. "Really? You've found someone? Yes, yes! Um...you can bring him over as soon as possible. Thank you!" He hangs the phone up and a smile spreads across his face. He brings a hand up and wipes it across his face. Then, without another moment, he turns back to his honey.
The next day, Sherlock waited patiently outside John's home. He watched as John and his daughter left for school and while he waited for him to come back, he scanned the neighbourhood. It was a smallish town, with one high school and two public schools, a hospital (where John worked), a large park, two small churches, a hiking trail, an arena, a skate park, a daycare, an ice cream shop, a pizza parlour, a cafe, a few restaurants, two banks, two gas stations and a whole lot of residential buildings, including a small suburban neighborhood, which was where John and his daughter lived.
Sherlock heard the sound of John rustling around, his feet on the floor as he came towards the door. After a moment, the door opened. Up close, John looked almost the same as Sherlock remembered, only older and a lot tired. At first, he didn't move or do anything at all. He stared into Sherlock's eyes, his expression carefully neutral. Sherlock didn't know if he should say anything at all.
"Well...the last time I saw Lestrade or Molly was maybe five years ago. I visited Mrs. Hudson three years ago. Time just...got away from me , I guess," he admits, guiltily. "How do they look?"
"Well after I came home from the military, I needed a place to stay. Sherlock and I had a mutual friend who introduced us," John explains. "Sherlock was looking for a flatmate and so I moved in with him."
Sherlock reaches forward to shake the other man's hand. John Watson is a short, stocky man. His hair is blonde and short. He's only a little older than Sherlock, but he has a maturity that shows through his face. He wears an old brown t shirt and blue jeans and a pair of working boots. He only has a duffel bag with him. "How do you do?" Sherlock greets.
The rest of the day goes well. Mae spends some more time at the park before they leave. They stop to pick up a pizza, then arrive home--at least at John's home. Dinner goes great. The two adults sit on the sofa and Mae lounges on the floor in front of them, watching TV. The conversation flows well. Mae and Sherlock don't pass a lot of words between them but its okay. Neither of them feel the need to and Mae keeps her eyes glued to the screen. After pizza they have ice cream. This is when Mae finally speaks up.
Sherlock flushes with embarrassment and shame. He watched Mae walk into the kitchen and fill up two glasses of water. She comes back and hands one to him. He thanks her and sits on the sofa again. She sits beside him. They are both silent for a while, sipping their water. Finally, Mae breaks the silence. She reaches over to the side table to grab the remote.
Eventually, Sherlock decides to get a glass of water to help soothe his throat. Just so he stand up, a voice rings out through the room.
Sherlock breaks out into a grin. John told him he would text him whenever he wanted to see him again. Sherlock expected it to be weeks before John ever contacted him. He typed a reply quickly.
"Are you okay?" Its Mae. Her voice is tiny and sleepy at this hour. Sherlock turns around to find her standing at the foot of the stairs, a fuzzy robe wrapped around her and her brown hair flying in all directions. He freezes. She heard him screaming.
He had a lot to think about anyways. His relationship with John which was in a very awkward place at the moment. Were they friends again? Sherlock couldn't tell. But John did offer him to stay overnight and they had been spending a lot of time together as of late. John was even happy to have his daughter around Sherlock. That had to count for something. They certainly weren't anywhere close to where they had been before the fall. Before that, they were a lot younger and quick on their feet. They had adrenaline coursing through their veins and jumped at any chance of an adventure. They could talk about mostly anything. John was able to get Sherlock to laugh and he was the only person that Sherlock had ever felt truly comfortable around. They were far from that now but every time they hung out, Sherlock felt them getting closer and closer. He hopes they could heal with time.
John laughs. "Of course its okay, Sherlock!" he exclaims. "I mean, you could have told me before we went out, maybe we could have found something better to do but its fine. I'm not mad."
The girl is friendly and Sherlock detects a bit of shyness behind her words. "Hi," Sherlock says. "Its nice to meet you, too."
With that, John scurries up the stairs, leaving Sherlock shocked. This wasn't in his plans for today. He has to admit it sounds a lot nicer than sleeping in the hotel back in London. Ever since he came back, he has been having severe nightmares and the eerily quiet, too dark hotel doesn't help. He mostly spends his nights lying awake, trying to deduce the other patrons in the hotel or trying to figure out who stayed there before him. Sometimes he'll take his pack of cigarettes and wander around the city, taking in how different it looks at night when no one else is around. Now, though, he's going to be sleeping in John's small family home. John and his daughter will also be sleeping upstairs, in the same house as him. It's a strange feeling.
"I can check it out. I, too would like to be closer. Being in London is dreadfully boring, I have to say," Sherlock admits. "Its nice out here in the country."
John beams. "You think so? Everyone always comments on her beautiful brown hair which she got from her mother but never that she looks like me."
"You can--you can sleep on the couch here, if that's okay...I don't think--" he clears his throat, awkwardly. This conversation has taken an uncomfortable turn. Sherlock quirks an eyebrow at him. "Is that okay? I have some spare blankets and a pillow."
John smiles a little. "Okay. I can do that. But, don't expect much. I have--I have responsibilities now. I can't go running after you whenever you want. It's going to be really hard for me. Please understand that."
"Well, I wouldn't say that...but there is a certain...essence about your clothes, you could say," Sherlock says, smirking.
John had lived there for around three years now. This home was the only one his daughter knew, the hustle and bustle of London and 221B unknown to her. Sherlock doubted John ever visited London, even though it was a mere twenty minutes away. John's home was a nice size. It had dark siding and a nicely sized front porch with a few potted plants and a bench on it. The front yard was well kept, the lawn cut short. The backyard was a nice size, with a wooden fence around the perimeter. There was a small swing set out back and some children's toys. Sherlock saw no sign of a family pet.
"That's nice but you're going to be really tired tomorrow if you don't go to bed now," John tells her.
Sherlock stood across the street from the local public school, watching as John picked up his daughter for the day. This was the second week Sherlock had been discretely following John, watching his movement, his patterns, trying to deduce how exactly to approach him. Mostly, Sherlock was afraid of what would happen. John's hair was styled differently. The now silver locks were swooped backwards and were much longer than Sherlock had ever seen them before. His face was older. There were more lines on his forehead and around his mouth, but not exactly smile lines. He had gained some weight, too. He was thicker around his middle, pudgier, less hard muscle.
"John, that's ridiculous. I was away for twelve years and I could do it. You can, too. You know they asked me about you. They were all worried about you," Sherlock says, frowning. "They told me you just left one day without a word. They said you--you weren't well, that you lost weight and--"
"I've had enough of London. I'll still go there often but...I think being there is too much," Sherlock says. "It will be nice to have a change of scenery."
"Oh," John starts, looking a bit embarrassed. He hold up his duffel bag. "This is all I have, actually."
"Oh, um...nothing. I was just taking a look around the property, is all," John tells him. "Its beautiful out here."
"Yes. Her name is Mae. Her mother um, she left, two days after she was born," John tells him, grimly.
A week later, Sherlock is over at John's again. They're sitting on the sofa together while Mae kneels on the floor by the coffee table, drawing. John has brought a bottle of wine from the kitchen and they're each having a glass.
Sherlock nods, proudly. "I can buy a large property even further into the country and get started. I've always been interested in it."
"You're much skinnier," John says, sadly. "We'll have to change that. You--you're tan...I didn't even know that was possible. Your hair is a lot shorter but...I can see white in it! You're going grey!"
"You tell me," John chuckles. "Look, all I'm saying is that you don't need go be scared. She's very friendly and she loves meeting new people. Kids aren't as hard to talk to as you think. They're easily impressed."
"John has just come back from the war," Stamford tells Sherlock. "He's a good friend and a good man. I think you two will get along well. I would have put him up but you know," he gives a hearty chuckle. "The wife and kids."
She flicks the TV on and clicks until she lands on the cartoon channel. A rerun of Looney Tunes is on. It's the episode where Marc Anthony makes friends with the little kitten. They watch together, occasionally, Mae laughs at the cartoon. Sherlock watches as the dog and the kitten become best friends, the small black and white kitten sleeping on the dog's back. He still feels incredibly embarrassed about his dream. He Hope's John didn't hear his screaming either. He dreams about John occasionally. Mostly, he dreams about being tortured and beaten. He dreams about actually dying. The dreams about John are by far the worst though and this time was no exception.
"Goodnight," Sherlock replies. He watches as John and his daughter retreat up the stairs. He sits for a moment in silence, staring at the empty wine glasses. He wonders briefly if he should go. It's getting late. John wouldn't appreciate it if he stayed all night. He listens to the sound of John moving around upstairs. His hears the creak as he sits on Mae's bed, probably reading her a bedtime story. Eventually, he hears John's footsteps as he comes down the stairs.
John walks off. Sherlock waits before he's across the yard to turn around and watch him walk. What an interesting man.
"I do, stored away. I've been doing this for so long that I really have no use for them. I trust them."
John moved to fully close the door but Sherlock stepped forward and pushed it open with his hand. "John, please. I--I know this is crazy but let me explain. Please. I can explain."
"Yes," Sherlock nods. "It was my life but it led me to Moriarty and while it may have been the challenge I always wished for, I want to stay as far away from it as I can, now. It is not worth it."
"Alright. Let's get going, then," John says. Mae eyes Sherlock, warily before opening the car door and hopping in the back. John's eyes flick to his for a moment, as if checking to see that he's okay. Then he gets in the car too. Sherlock slides into his place in the passenger seat. When everyone is buckled up, they drive off.
"Stamford told me you kept bees," John says, quietly. "And you sell your honey? That's pretty cool. Must be nice, although I'm a bit nervous just to be standing so close to them."
So, two days later Sherlock is accompanying John on the ride to one of the local public schools. In the passenger seat, Sherlock's leg bounces up and down, anxiously. He tries to hide his nerves but John keeps glancing at him, a fond smile gracing his lips.
When Sherlock jolts awake, the sun is just coming up. The clock reads five thirty six in the morning. He's sweating and he has kicked the blankets off. His voice feels sore, as if he's been screaming. He hopes nobody heard him. He sits up and looks around the room. He feels embarrassed and doesn't want to face John in the morning. He's happy that he managed to fall asleep. It's an improvement and although he had a nightmare, it's something to be proud of. He attributes it to the sore lack of sleep and tells himself it has nothing to do with John's presence.
"John," Sherlock pleaded. "Its me. I--I haven't been dead. I never died. I've been overseas, trying to get rid of Moriarty's web. I did this to protect you. I--if you had known I was alive, he could have killed you. I couldn't have that, you must understand. I swear to God, John. I swear."
"Okay," Sherlock agrees. He's not exactly sure how to do that but he will try his best. "She looks like you," Sherlock can't help but comment.
Sherlock's heart beats wildly. He IS nervous and he can't understand why. It's just a little girl and John's one at that. She is nothing to be afraid of in this world. The two come closer and closer until finally, they're standing in front of the detective.
"I know but--" John looks down at his hands, then back at Sherlock. "Well don't you think you should be a little closer to us? Then we can see you everyday."
He could also think about his future. About staying at the B&B in John's town. About eventually buying land and starting his beekeeping career. If it was even going to be a career. Mae had mentioned selling honey. Sure, that could help him pick up some extra cash but Sherlock doesn't really care about the money. He has enough to live comfortably and he mostly just wants to start it so he has something to do. Something to distract him from detective work. It wouldn't be hard. He had always been interested in bees as a child and now is his chance to put it into action.
"Well, you've been showing me around all day and you've done a good job of it but...," he stops, wondering if John will be mad or creeped out. "I've actually spent a fair bit of time around here. Before I knocked on your door um, I wandered around here. I was trying to decide whether or not to come up to you."
"Yes well, I was only getting a glass of water, then going back to sleep," he says, waving a hand about.
Sherlock grimaces. He's never been good with kids and he doesn't like most of them. But its John's child, she must have some of his good qualities. "I dont know...," he sighs. "I don't--I'm not good with kids."
Something twists inside Sherlock. His stomach feels weak and his fingers twitch. "Thank you," he whispers.
The next morning, Sherlock wakes up early. His friend Stamford is coming over with Sherlock's new flatmate. For years, the man's been trying to find someone to rent out one of the guest bedrooms but none of the previous people lasted very long. Sherlock slicks back his curls, so they sit flat on his head and dresses in a maroon long sleeved polo shirt, tucked into a pair of dark jeans. He does his best to clean up the guest bedroom, to make it look presentable and smell fresh, but there's only so much he can do. After all, the house is decades old.
With that, Sherlock sets off, leaving John to his own devices. It feels strange having another person in the hour, even though he can't see him. The feeling of being alone is comfortable for Sherlock and now its changed. Sherlock used to have a gardener who was often around the property and a chef, who made his meals but he fired them on account of wanting to be alone. He didn't cafe if his garden looked beautiful and he didn't always eat most meals, anyways.
With that, John turns and goes up the stairs into his own bedroom for the night. Sherlock doesn't move for a moment. Then, he snaps into motion and goes into the bathroom to change. When he puts the clothes on, they smell of John even stronger than before. It's the smell of his cologne and the shampoo he uses and it's something else entirely that Sherlock can't put his finger on. The bottoms are a bit short on him but they're comfortable and soft. The shirt fits very well, much to his surprise. He looks at himself in the mirror and can't help but smile a little at the sight of him in John's attire.
The little girl raises the hand that's not clutching John's and waves. "Hello. It's nice to meet you."
John laughs. "I know this is weird but...she's really great. She's a bit shy, I think. Maybe...just try and talk to her. Show her you're not a threat," he suggests.
"I heard you screaming," Mae says, pointedly. She walks closer to him and stands in front of him. "Are you okay?"
Sherlock picks the clothes up. It's a pair of John's pajama bottoms. They're red plaid and Sherlock remembers a time when John used to wear these. The shirt is one of John's army green t shirts with the letters 'RAMC' on the front. They smell of John even from where Sherlock holds them.
Eventually, Mae grows tired. She yawns and falls asleep, her head resting comfortably against Sherlock. He stares at her, slumped against his body. She smuggles against him. Sherlock enjoys the feeling of it. He is happy that she'a comfortable around him and it gives him some closure in his presence in John's life.
"It's my fault," Sherlock says, meeting John's eyes. "I should have had Mycroft check up on you but...I was scared. I didn't want to face what had happened to you. I was afraid that...I dont know...that maybe you weren't even around anymore." He looks away, feeling emotions rush over him.
Sherlock rolled his eyes in exasperation at John, “The dead man we fished out from the Thames, you remember him, could use a tan.”
“It was not us, it was never us after all, I mean media love to portray us as the heroes. But I never felt like a hero. We were just doing what we were told. I walked behind, patching people up. Children and adults alike, men and women, anyone hurt. All so they could go out and get shoot at again. Like a bad story stuck in a loop.”
Later, after the sun has fully risen, John pads down the stairs and finds Sherlock and Mae on the sofa. A soft expression comes over his face as he greets him with a quiet good morning. John makes breakfast for everyone and all three of them eat together, sharing conversation. The sun drifts through the windows and Sherlock watches as the neighbours begin to wake up as well. A paper boy delivers their paper and birds begin to sing. Sherlock takes in the environment before him. John sitting across from him, still wearing his pajamas, his hair sticking up at the back and a lazy smile just for him. His eight year old daughter directly to his right, rubbing sleep from her eyes and slowly eating her toast, her face a carbon copy of her father's. Sherlock feels at peace.
"I was just going to eat lunch," John said. He sniffled and tried to wipe the tears from his eyes. "Um, you can sit down." Sherlock moved further into the house and sat down stiffly on the sofa. John sat next to him. "Explain yourself, then."
John stares into his eyes, a confused expression falling over his face. With a weak and raspy voice he says, "Who are you?"
She shrugs and comes closer to him. "It doesn't matter. I usually get up at six to watch cartoons on Saturdays, anyways. Besides, you're up too."
