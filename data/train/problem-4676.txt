Mary brushed her hair and started to braid it back when John stepped into the bathroom of the motel. He stops in place before turning pale. Mary turns to face him, half a braid done.
Benny pats Dean’s shoulder. “See? Wasn’t that hard. Now you just have to tell him you’re his brother and then that you are bisexual. Not too hard, cher.”
“I can’t say much,”Charlie glances at Sam. “He hasn’t told me every detail, yet but it was bad. Like “I’m surprised he hasn’t killed himself” type of bad.”
Dean has tears falling down his face. The presence he once felt back when he was first raped returns. A warm pressure holds his hand and he feels a renewed sense of purpose. “I...I don’t think I ever really felt like a girl. Before mom died, I remember being made that I wasn’t a boy and therefore couldn’t take a bath with dad. Ever since then, I never felt like I was a girl but I just…” he sighs. “I just ignored it. And then dad-“ Dean grips the bottle hard.
“I’m your nephew from Detroit. I’m visiting for the summer with my roommate, Charlie. We’ll get a hotel room when we come down. Probably for Sam’s birthday, I’m not sure.”
“You wrote her a letter but didn’t contact us at all?” Bobby says slowly. He's mad. Didn’t hear do everything for Dean?
John glares at Dean while she collects the wrapping paper. “You’ve talked about it nonstop the entire summer, how could I not?”
“Yeah, he says I gotta learn how to cook before I can learn about hunting. I asked him.” She smiles at Bobby as she places Sam in the makeshift crib. “So, is it okay if I watch you make it?”
“We can. You just have to give us until Friday.” Principal McDonald flips his calendar open. “You can take tomorrow and Wednesday off and come back on Thursday and Friday to take the tests and get your diploma.”
“And, uh,” Dean scrubs the bar of soap into his hair. “What do you think? Friend who didn’t support her
“Mary,” she turns to face Bobby again. “If you ever feel like your dad doesn’t accept you, you’re always welcome here.”
“No problem,” he said. He didn’t finish his food, his appetite gone with the knowledge of Dean being alive and having to keep that from Sam. Hopefully Dean explains it to Sam when he comes, because Bobby is not looking foreword to that conversation.
Cassie pulls off her coat and takes a couple presents out of her bag. She hands Bobby a bag and takes the box over to Sam.
“Do you know what’s up with Dean?” Sam leans forward on the chair next to the desk in the hotel room. They just finished a hunt and are going to leave in the morning to get back to Bobby’s place for Christmas. “He’s been hanging with Benny more than either of us, now. I was just wondering if you knew why or not.”
“Nuh uh! Let me take a guess.” Crowley puts a finger to his chin. “You want me to raise Sam from the dead.”
Bobby nods and starts to head inside. He stops and turns to Dean one last time. “So, does Cassie know? Or…”
Benny smiles and closes his eyes before Dean slices through the rest of his neck. The hounds take that opportunity to lunge at him and before he can process their movement, he can feel the dogs pull apart every muscle from his chest and stomach. He screams until he’s hoarse and the beasts start dragging his body away from Benny’s. Dean tries to claw his way back, to see Benny’s face one last time, but the hounds yank on his leg so hard, some of the muscle strips off his bone. As the hellhounds feast on his body, he feels an odd sense of relief wash over him.
“His friends said he wanted to be a woman. He apparently was going to get some meds to fuck with his body so he can look the part. The majority of them said they supported his, uh, ‘transition’ but one of them agreed with the aint.”
“Apparently a nephew of mine.” Bobby sits down with his food again. “He called out of nowhere saying he was left with my phone number.”
“Well,” Cassie takes Dee’s hand. “If you feel more like a boy, then me suggesting we date instead of just being friends would be alright. I wouldn’t have to have this crisis of whether or not I’m gay because you’re a boy not a girl.”
Just as she takes a step towards the door, one of their neighbors comes by to help her daddy stand. Mrs. Patty squats down next to Mary to take Sam.
A tear is wiped from her cheek. She feels warmth in her chest for a moment before whatever was there leaves. Mary takes a deep breath in before standing.
Dean looks at Benny who gives him a nod of support. “I’m transgender. I was a woman but now I’m a man. I’m still Dean. I’m not her anymore; she wasn’t who I was. So it hurts when I see you just ignoring someone like me.”
Bobby sits alone at the table with a plate of leftovers. Sam left for school at eight and it’s just about lunchtime for Bobby. He turns on the 2pm soaps and gets ready to eat. His phone rings just as he lifts up his fork for a bite. Grumbling, Bobby answers the phone.
“Boy?” Bobby’s voice took a soft, confused tone. Mary regretted letting that slip out but she hadn’t slept the past few days taking care of John. “Mary, are you..? I mean, do you-”
“You don’t need to be a man, Mary.” He walks over to her and squeezes her shoulder. “You just have to be yourself. Why do you need to prove yourself to your daddy?”
“No kid should be raped year after year either but that doesn’t stop John from doing it.” Dean whispers. The presence moves to the back of his neck.
As the three shopped, Mary could tell that Freddie and Kevin were closer than they say. She’s seen enough of the parents at school that she can tell they love each other. As they walk out of the store with their bags, Mary asks, “So how long have you two been together?”
Dean sighs. “If we’re going to Detroit, I’m not coming back here. Get your stuff. I’ll make the call for the apartment and to quit my job.”
“Thanks, Cassie.” Sam opens the box to find a Stanford shirt and another envelope. This one looks more official so he quirks a brow at Cassie before opening it.
“Alright,” Dean says, starting the car. “We don’t have a place to sleep until tomorrow so what do you want to do now?”
Mary starts at a new school on a Monday. The school year is almost over, but that’s fine with her because she already knows everything being taught. She’s so far ahead, she should be moved up a grade but she stays back for John’s sake. Mary sighs.
“Yes, sir.” She unties her boots and starts taking them off. She can hear her dad do the same on the other bed. She climbs under the covers quickly and closes her eyes. The faster she sleeps, the faster she can start hunting.
“So if you’re trying to make a deal for me to not have to deal with John anymore, suck balls, man. I won’t let Sam take the fall of what will happen.”
They sit there, each of them crying for a while. The sun is fully down by the time Dean stands back up.
“I’d say you’re absolutely crazy, Crowley. How can I trust that you won’t release your hounds on me later?” Dean stands up, looking down at Crowley.
“Your wife wasn’t.” Bobby freezes. “Look, I’ll fake a name, it’ll be fine. Sam will be too preoccupied with getting ready for college so he won’t notice.”
“He’ll know when I’m gone.” Dean turns back to the road and starts driving again, keeping a hand in Benny’s. “I’ve been trying to read up on the hell dogs the past few days. ‘M pretty sure they’re weaker when hit with iron. Not sure.”
Bobby nods. Rufus gives his shoulder a pat before heading off to the other shower to clean off. Bobby walks back to the living room and checks on Sam and Mary. Both are asleep, Mary tucked into the couch cushions and Sam in the crib. He turns his head towards the stairs.
Mary sits back further on the couch, her hair slicked into a tight bun, ensuring no stray hair falls out of place.
“That is a difficult question, Ben. From my experience, I have noticed that when people are happy they generally work well together - they approach things as a team, they communicate, they are willing to accept one another’s flaws, and they don’t try to change each other.”
Yes, he wanted his parted lips upon those of his former lover’s as soon as he saw him. But he felt the
“I saw how you fought for him, how you believed in him, and I knew I couldn’t put this decision into your hands, I knew someone smarter was going to have to do it.”
, Cas feels the same way too. The stoicism is just an act, as it always was, to protect him. Dean sees it then, the slightest trace of tears in a storm of blue.
“The boxers, man, that’s why I was always trying to buy you different ones. Those are like the most un-sexy underwear I’ve ever seen in my life.”
When Cas breaks away, with Dean looking at him questioningly, Cas smiles and begins to take off his collar.
Ben nods as Cas sets some Granny Smith apples in front of him with a vegetable peeler. Ben begins to peel the apples as Cas readies the sauce they will cook in. Ben watches with interest as Father Novak seems to know where everything is.
He tries to piece together her life. What did she say? Her father was killed. Her father was killed in front of her. She had to go to various foster homes, and Cas assumed, from her words, she was abused.
The laugh this time was cold, and Cas’s heart felt as if it were constricting, like it were being held in some type of precarious vice.
Dean swallows. He knows Cas is only partly right concerning the case. He was not without fault concerning their past, he knows it. Cas knows it, but Cas won’t bring it up because he and Cas both know the most important thing to Dean is staying. But Dean knows now, he knows why Cas left, he understands Cas better, but this case and Cas together is still a bit murky.
Cas looks to Dean quickly and then back to Benny. Dean nods at him, urging him to speak whatever he needed to speak, hoping that maybe, just maybe, these two very important men in his life could go on.
Cas allows a sob to escape and Sam hands him another tissue. Sam knew Cas needed to get this out, and he wanted to be here for him as much as he could be.
He hears her leave the confessional, and he is stuck, unable to move because he knows his legs will betray him.
Melanie Hawkins notices a smudge on her white sandals and tries to hide the imperceptible mark behind her other foot. She breathes in deeply, her chest rising dramatically as she awaits Lisa’s response. She looks around the house quickly, smiling internally at the difference in size compared to hers - she was a lawyer’s wife after all.
Dean scoffed. “So, you were what, good to let her just keep doing it?” Dean flung his head against the back of his headrest. He felt this was a new side to Cas, a side he wasn’t used to seeing - a side that had its own type of justice. And for some reason Dean couldn’t pinpoint, he felt Cas’s reasoning was probably good - and he wondered what that made him.
Benny leans over the desk, his palms on either side of the computer monitor. “I don’t think you understand just how sick your boy is. He thinks he is innocent. Ya understand?”
Dean rubs the sleep out of his eyes and turns to the boy with soulful eyes and a three-piece itchy suit he keeps readjusting.
Dean’s arms quickly find their home. He rubs Cas’s back and notices the muscles may be even slightly bigger and wonders what the priest does to work out. He holds Cas to him, and revels in how fucking
He missed Cas and wanted him next to him right then. He didn’t care if he was sick, he would help him heal. God, how Dean wanted to be the glue that held Cas’s pieces together.
Cas tries to think quickly, ignoring the feelings of helplessness overcoming his every molecule. He should not be thinking of Dean now, it was not only inopportune, it was inappropriate, but this was their second chance of sorts and here
“Ah, that won’t work. I got smart after my first kill. That one was messy, I’m actually surprised I wasn’t caught. There was blood everywhere. Rather violent. I looked at him after the job was completed and thought,‘what a waste.’”
Dean nods as he tries to think about all those dates. Sam had some good ideas. He was glad he texted him the info earlier so Sam could start his whole thinking process.
Dean immediately flushes, knowing the inappropriateness of the question, hell, of this whole situation.
to notice the woman behind him, too engulfed in programming to feel the hypo injected into his exposed neck.
“We all have those cases, man. Where the perp becomes so ingrained in our psyche that it’s like our own personal game of cat and mouse.” He thinks back to a driven agent in a black leather jacket with a journal. “I ain’t happy you hid the details. Why did you do that anyway?” He feels a pang of hurt and the pain moves its way to his eyes.
She shakes her head as much as possible. “No, it is simply like yours. What can I say priest? You inspire me.”
“Yeah, so I’m still working for the feds so I’m sure they’ll want my input on this one. Hell, I’ll probably be in charge of the damn case.” He doesn’t tell Cas about the suspension, about the demotion, Cas already feels guilty enough that it shows in his body language. Why add to it?
Mary scowls as she fights Dean’s grasp, but the bastard was too strong for her to break free. She hated him and she fought with everything she could, but the man wouldn’t budge. God, how she hated him.
Cas plays with his wedding band as it reflects the light of the early morning sun. He snuggles in closer to Dean, their bare hips touching, allowing plenty of extra room for their dog, Miracle, in their Queen size bed.
He thinks of the apple orchard in his dreams and turns away. However, something in him prevails and he utters, in almost a mumble:
Dean is thankful for the trashcan next to him and clings to it for dear life as everything comes up.
“You’re not failing us, Dean. If you don’t go get your Priest, who you love and what you want you will be failing yourself. And what kind of person would I be if I allowed that? Now, go get your guy!”
He feels his stomach churn again as he sees that the hair found at the crime scene matched Cas’s exactly.
“You wouldn’t understand, you couldn’t. What do you know about being at the mercy of another? Hum? Having to endure every abuse just because they were stronger than you?”
He took the folder and ran into the local Buy-All store. He got a cart and was throwing various meat and bread products into the cart.
“Dean, he, he tried. But I wouldn’t listen. I was too sure that what I was doing was right back then, I thought I was on the right path.”
“I have my reasons, and you shall soon be privy to them. Just as you were obsessed with me, you will discover or rediscover rather, that I was rather taken with you as well.”
“I don’t know, is there anything ‘techy’ to give the perp away?” Dean looks at her with affection, for this redhead was one of his most favorite people in existence.
So, he finds himself in Dean’s office. He pushes the boxes marked “Disturbing - Don’t Open Kid,” and begins to unpack the others. He arranges the various books on the shelves - according to his own filing system Dean seemed to appreciate (or at least pretended to). He pulls out a book he’s never seen before - the binding is worn brown leather, and it is tied with leather strings. Ben takes the book to the couch and opens it up. The first page is a type of timeline.
“Oddly enough, I always carry them. Never could stand an un-olived Martini.” She pulls the jar from her bag, somewhat sad she’ll never get to use them for their intended purpose again.
Dean plays with the keys in his hand, afraid to make eye contact, knowing where he will want to go. The eyes, the lips, everything. Everything about Cas was dangerous, and everything about him was safe.
Cas was obsessed with the case, obsessed with not being able to catch the killer. But obsession didn’t mean that Cas was the killer. Dean knew obsession, had seen it first hand and Cas was not the typical product of its path of destruction.
“Dean and I weren’t the same. He no longer saw wonder in my eyes. He saw the man who maimed his best friend. He saw the man who was so obsessed that he couldn’t even tell the difference between the monster and their shadow.”
Sam and Eileen share another look. Sam’s stomach falls. It was so much worse than he knew. This woman, this beautiful woman in front of him, dropped whatever she was holding onto to take care of his drunk mess of a brother and help him become human once more. She thought Dean was a widower, that he was bereaved, and in a way, maybe he was.
This was some next level Dexter shit and Dean was not prepared for it. Okay, okay, this could be dealt with. It was just two coincidences, she knew the contacts as well, this was a high level frame job is what this was. Because this, this couldn’t be
He stared into green pools, waiting for his words to be done, waiting to touch him again. He forgot he was a man of the cloth, and only remembered he was a man, and wondered how he could have ever left Dean in the first place.
Sam knows Lisa is kind, generous, warm, and loving. She is everything anyone could ever want, and yet Sam knew she never felt she was enough for Dean - probably because of Cas.
Lisa winces as one of the movers hits the couch against the frame of the front door, making a small notch.
Dean leans his chin down into her arms and kisses the skin he finds there. He lifts his head up when there’s a knock at the door.
But this... this was different. Cas was a living, breathing man, she no longer had to compete with a memory, but with flesh and blood. And she should have seen it. She should have seen it in the way Dean looked into Cas’s eyes at the altar, at the way their hands joined, at the way their eyes met. She shakes her head to clear the thoughts and focuses on the man standing in front of her.
Dean nods, his eyes with a tinge of pain. He can’t help but think of Cas - of how the accident made a man who wanted nothing more than to help humanity turn into a shell who feared the world. To make amends.
“We had a good thing going for a good while. And I will always love you, Dean. I know Ben will always love you. But now, knowing Cas is alive and well in the world, I can’t be the ‘other woman.’ You may never sleep with him, but your heart will always belong to him, and for me, that’s worse.”
Dean recoils in a cold type of horror that makes his blood run cold. “I didn’t know you thought that! That ain’t my fault.”
He hears his mom call him from downstairs, he knows he’s gotta watch a movie with Sam and Eileen, he promised. He also knows he’s gotta hide whatever sick info he just discovered. I mean, wasn’t that type of stuff supposed to be in case files? And whose was it anyway?
Dean sees it, he sees the tells in Cas’s averted glance, at the looks of hope drained from his face, and he knows, he knows that whatever Cas is about to say probably will be the answer to everything. The reason he left, the reason he didn’t fight, the reason he wouldn’t fight, and Dean was terrified. He stood, stock still, because Cas, fuck it, Cas was about to spill his guts and Dean was worried that he would no longer be able to hold onto the bit of anger that kept Cas just out of reach.
He places the body in a “T” position, the arms splayed out to the side, her feet together.  He returns the knife, wiped clean by Mary’s gown, into a pocket from his vest and pulls out a vial from another. He empties some of the contents of the vial onto his thumb and draws a cross with ashes.
He pats Cas’s back with finality and pulls him away to look into his eyes. He knows he shouldn’t say it again, knows it wrong, knows Lis is waiting on him to make a decision. But Cas’s arms were in his hands, his eyes were two feet away from his, and his lips…
Mary nods, noncommittal. Mary rarely committed to anything - except her calling. She tenses ever so slightly as the mother and son make their way toward them.
“My husband, Joe. He’s a good man. I do love him. Probably much the same way you love your Castiel, Agent. I would have fought the hordes of Hell for his salvation.”
“It’s up to him.” Charlie says. She looks back at Sam’s sleeping face. “He just lost his partner, he’ll be grieving for a while. After that, well, it’s up to him.”
Dean shifts from one foot to the other. “Abusive piece of shit for a dad. That, and if I ever told him I was a man and not his little girl, I’d probably be in a ditch in the middle of Kansas.”
“So we’re really going to let Dean fend for himself against- what again?” Sam looks up at Charlie. “Hellhounds? I thought only people who made demon deals get chased down by them.”
Charlie frowns. “If we go down Lafayette there's a park there we can stay. A graveyard is down there as well, if you’re down to sleep there. No one will bother us there.”
Dean ends up sleeping over at Cassie’s house that night, earning him a beating from John but he couldn’t be happier.
Mary cries out again, trying to nod but can’t breathe. She tries to move John’s hand from her throat but he only grips harder.
Hannah smiles. “It’s hard, at first. Samantha lost a lot of people when she came out. That’s why she moved here. Her family disowned her.”
A police officer comes up to him when the fire is out and Jessica’s body is on the way to the morgue. “Did you see anything out of the ordinary?”
John throws his hands out and looks around the room. Dean knows she’s made a mistake after she says, “Sam,” in a soft voice and the two other Winchesters glare at her.
Mr. Willer walks over to his desk. “Of course, Kelly. Mary, I know you’re new here but I can’t take that as an excuse anymore. I’ll be back in a few, I need to go to the teachers lounge for a meeting.”
Cassie gives Sam a hug before pulling away to hand him his gift. “Not bad. I hope you don’t mind that I brought you something.”
Bobby takes the papers from Sam and looks them over. “Last I checked, this account had almost five thousand. I don’t know how it got to be almost a quarter of a million.”
Dean rubs a hand down her face. “He’s seventeen now. And no, he doesn’t know. He doesn’t know a lot of things.”
He finds her sitting at the table in the kitchen, a mug of tea in hand. She looked ethereal, and he knew the past three years were something he would always cherish in some degree.
Dean smiles, a beautiful thing, and Cas knows his mission was accomplished - and any other mission could go to Hell.
“That’s uh… that’s hard to swallow man. So, you what, became a priest?” In Cas’s eyes, his beautiful religious eyes that believed in a higher power, maybe that made sense.
He knew she was following him. It was the only thing that made everything make sense. But the dates didn’t matter, because...
future, he envisioned something urban, some condo in the middle of a busy downtown with a balcony garden. Or fuck, maybe some house in the middle of nowhere, where they would only spend days on end with each other.
She looks back to her article after taking another sip of coffee to be interrupted by her husband yet again.
Lisa feels a sharp pang in her stomach and she has to fight to keep her hand from going there. She nods and looks to the side. Dean’s favorite. “Umm… there’s the ingredients in the kitchen? Do you mind? I hate asking since you’re the guest of honor, but Dean forgot to get the frozen kind.”
again. He didn’t care why he was here, didn’t care who he was with, all that mattered was that it was him.
“I will not fight, as you say, but I will try to help, as best I can. Shall we discuss the last time we worked on this case?”
And maybe, just maybe it wasn’t weakness. Maybe Cas’s ability to walk away, to choose something else, to not see something through to the end was a type of strength. He was a fucking genius, Dean always knew that. And he was good at whatever he did. Dean knew Cas thought about being a priest before he was recruited for the agency, knew he went to seminary, but to get his own parish within three years of going back was fucking impressive, and Cas, Cas was impressive. So yeah, maybe Dean understood it better, but that doesn’t mean it don’t hurt. Revelations were coming hard and fast but right now that didn’t matter - he hurt Cas, and he had to make it better, because he had the chance, because he could.
“What the fuck for?” With every word, he tried escaping by sheer brute force, Mary rather enjoyed the display.
Ben nods, “I mean, yeah, this dude talks about shooting someone down in front of their kid, that’s pretty friggin’ awful.” Ben feels bad for the slight curse, but appreciates Father Novak taking no notice of it.
“You are in a wonderful parish. Our priest is a bit advanced in his thinking, but I don’t know what I would do without his confession.”
As Dean smiles ever so slightly at the cashier, his mind begins to flood with vivid recollections of that night.
“Sam won’t call her by her chosen name.” Dean tightens his hold for a second before stepping back. “He refuses to call her a woman, even after he’s been asked multiple times.”
“Okay, Mare. Now remember, we’re leaving very early tomorrow so I need the bags packed and ready to go before then. I’ll make Sam a bottle but when I’m done, I expect you to be out here heating up dinner, okay?”
“You’re a Winchester.” John stands and slowly walks to Sam. “Winchesters are hunters, not some kind of a pansy assed guy in a suit. You’re coming with me on the next few hunts I have, low-level stuff to ease your way into it.”
“I…” Dee wrongs her hands together. “I never- My dad calls me a girl and it makes me...zone out sometimes. Like it’s wrong.”
“That’s fine with me, Mary. You’re not 16 anymore, you don’t have to ask me for permission or anything anymore.”
“Not sure.” Bobby takes a forkful of rice. “Didn’t say. I assume he’ll leave after a while but he wanted to connect. After my wife died, her family cut me off.”
Charlie leans to talk through the driver side window. “If we’re going to be roommates we need to get to know each other. Now get in! I know a place in Detroit where we can get trashed.”
Crowley walks away and imitates the sound of the Impala starting up before he hides. John runs out of the shed and screams before going back in the shed. He emerges after a few minutes and starts up Jeff’s truck before speeding away. Crowley laughs softly. He’ll be king of hell soon and he can’t wait for John to arrive there. He has some plans for him already.
Dean shifts from one foot to another. “I can also search more on other creatures and add to that for you so after this hunt, you don’t have to research about wraiths much. I was looking through the paper and saw something that could be a wraith not far from here.”
Cassie looks down. “Yeah, some ghost had killed my dad and when Dean found out, he did everything to help solve it. I didn’t believe him at first. I just thought those hunting trips with John were actually hunting trips. When I saw him send the ghost back to hell- or heaven, I can’t really say- well, let’s just say I was shocked.”
“Easy there, Lassie.” Dean slowly reaches behind himself, grabbing a small can of something. “I’m right here.”
“Uh huh,” Charlie raises an eyebrow. “Is this another start up to your argument against Benny or is this something deeper?”
Dean sprints around the room collecting everything John would need before rushing out of the room to put the heavy bag in the car. While she’s closing the Impala door, a truck pulls up next to her.
Bobby shakes his head. She died almost ten years ago. He looks at the sleeping baby in the little girl’s arms and sighs before standing up.
Dean looks around the front area of the house to see the kitchen to his left. He raids he cabinets looking for some type of powder he could probably throw on the fucking beasts so they’ll be easier to see. Just as his hand wraps around a bag of powdered sugar, a deep snarl comes from across the room. Dean turns to look at the dog’s smoldering black eyes.
“Should I ask him to join us?” Dean asks as they drive off. “He got his degree and is interning with some hotshot lawyer. I don’t want to ruin his life.”
“Get undressed and lay down on the bed. If you make any kind of noise, I will hurt you. I don’t want to hurt you, Mary, so do what I say.” John pulls a gun out of the back of his pants and points it at Mary.
John laughed. “Mary may act like she likes to learn, but she doesn’t. She likes to cook and clean, which is better, anyway. At least then she’ll be able to make a man happy later on.”
Dean looks at Charlie while she gives him the “don’t do anything stupid, Winchester” look she’s perfected over the years. “You see if you can find where the bastard is. I’ll be right back.”
Dean sighs. The line grumbles a bit while no one talks. “I sent her a letter. That’s why she left. I told her everything about John. She visited me for a few days before leaving. She’s got a position at the Washington Post.”
“No,” Dean slaps the steering wheel, causing Benny to flinch with how loud it is. “You’re not! You’re going to get somewhere safe and take care of Sammy for me.”
John scoffs. “Now, you’re making things up, huh, Mare? I guess I shouldn’t bring you on any more hunts if you’re going to lie to me.”
John stalks towards her, eyes predatory. Mary moves to the other side of the room so the bed is between them.
“He loved it.” Cassie takes a tissue to dab her eyes. “Just like I love writing. I hope you don’t mind, but is it okay if I go through his things? Just so I can have something of his?”
Charlie hands Dean a couple slices of cheese. “No, if anything I think that’s alright given the circumstances.”
“Even after I help you take down a big guy,” Benny says, walking towards Dean. “You’re still going to kill me?”
Crowley pushes his tongue around his mouth, feeling somewhat ashamed but mostly feeling angry at himself for feeling so.
Dean nods and hugs her back quickly. “Alright, enough with the heart to heart, that filled my yearly quota.”
Dean smiles. “You know, for a hunter you’re very jumpy.” She grabs a couple of the drinks and moves them to the table. “We might want to wait here for a few more minutes.”
Crowley smirks. “Just had a little fun with her. A little bit of torture, a little bit of nasty; you would know. She said she would have preferred you over me with everything I got to do before she ended up like her namesake.”
Charlie raises her eyebrows and looks away from Dean. “Smelling like Chewbacca more than ever, though.”
She takes her mug and makes her way upstairs to her and Sam’s room. She sets the card on the nightstand, slipping a twenty in place of the check in case John or Sam come in and see it. She grabs her overnight bag and packs up her things, keeping the check in her bra in case John flips out and goes through her things. Dean grabs the box she stashed in Sam’s things and sets it in the bottom of her bag. Cassie is going to love it.
She slams her fist into the marble counter over and over again before she breathes in heavily and sinks to the floor. She grabs her hair in her hands and pulls as hard as she can.
Dean nods and takes a shaky breath in. “I just want him to be proud of me. I was never good enough for him, you know? Even when…” Dean pushes his fist into the counter. “There was always something wrong, you know?”
Charlie laughs. “Make me a sandwich, peasant. I’ll turn on something to watch unless you want to read Harry Potter together.”
Sam continues to cry loudly. She looks towards the front door again and sees her dad crawl out before a loud bang sounds behind him.
“No, Charlie, it’s okay.” Dean says. “I can handle this. If he comes tonight, we’ll stay for as long as we can. We leave tomorrow, anyway. I only took until Thursday off.”
Dean’s face scrunches and tears start to fall. “If I told you I was actually a man, what would you say?”
“Not everyone is a hunter.” Bobby says. “Here, help me move this onto the trailer. I’ll drop you kids off at the hotel after dinner.”
“You’re right,” Dean sighs. “Okay, I have to go now. I’m in room 32 and Sam’s across the hall. Benny is around here, somewhere. He stayed over last night.”
Cassie nods and leans on Bobby’s truck. “I was his girlfriend, of course I knew. When did he tell you?”
Bobby looks out the window. Would Karen want her daughter to learn to cook at five years old? He looks back at Mary and her green eyes. He holds out his hand for her to take. “Okay, Mary. You can watch, but I don't know how helpful watching me cook. My wife, Karen, cooks way better than me.”
“Exactly,” Sam says. He closes the notebook and stands. “Well, I should say gay people don’t bother me as much anymore. Some people at Stanford that I know are gay- or, well, gay-curious. They’re nice people.”
Karen had tears in her eyes and after he said it, the tears dripped down her face. “You haven’t broken me, yet, Robbie.” She turned to leave, but Bobby caught her arm.
“Mary, dear, I’ll take Sam. Why don’t you go with Mr. Gill and get some water?” Mrs. Patty looks at her husband who nods and holds out his hand. Mary holds Sam a little tighter. “Mary, please, your daddy needs some water. Why don’t you go get him some?”
“I can do that.” Crowley looks down at his watch. “Now get out of here the cops should be on their way soon. Ta!”
Sam squints but decides not to mention anything that was said between the Bradbury’s. “Alright. But someone has to explain why this is happening soon.”
Charlie nods. The only monster beating Dean was John himself but she wasn’t about to tell that to Sam. “She sounds like a saint.”
“Have you tried explaining what being transgender is?” Benny asks, folding his arms together. “Or did you just lose your temper and run?”
Also, Sam’s not transphobic he’s just new to this. Don’t worry, he’ll have his own gender crisis later but Sam is he/they rights
“Don’t think, cher.” Benny opens the door. “Sam, great of you to join us. Can I try explaining why Dean is upset?”
He starts to open the door but turns around to look at her one last time. “Oh, and if you tell anyone this happened, I’ll make sure they won’t find the body.”
“The fake should have worked! I made it myself, of course it should have worked!” Charlie sighs. “Rat bastard.”
Dee stands up. “Yes, sir, I was just packing up my things. I’ll have everything for you tomorrow. I’m sorry, again.”
“It’s not ‘giving up,’” Dean pulls the car over before pressing his forehead into the steering wheel. “It’s...it’s needed. It’s my fucking job, Benny.”
Bobby nods his head. He’ll beat John to a pulp on the next hunt and blame whatever monster they hunt. “So if you’re a man, have I been calling you the wrong name this whole time?”
He smiles. “No problem, Miss Winchester. By Friday is okay, too.” Dee runs out of the room, already late to pick up Sam. “Miss Trinnison, I hope everything went alright?”
Mary wakes up as she’s thrown to the floor. John sighs, and walks past her to collect his pants. Mary starts to whimper as her body comes back into feeling. Her privates burn and her legs feel like jelly.
Crowley holds his hand out so Dean can take the keys to the Impala. “Because, if John loses you, he’ll never stop hunting for me leaving Sam to be in the care one Robert Singer. It would only be for a few months before he’s off to college- and no, I can’t help him get into college.”
Dean looks around the room, judging her options. She can exorcise the demon but she will need time to do so. She doesn’t have any type of demon-killing weapon or holy water so she may have no other choice. “Why do you care, demon?”
Mary sits down at their kitchen table while Gill grabs a few glasses and puts them in a bag. He grabs the pitcher from the fridge and sets both on the table in front of Mary.
Charlie parks the car and turns off the ignition. Sam sniffles silently while Charlie contemplates her next words.
Mary is struggling to get up but John’s hold on her is too much. She thrashes around on the bed as John sobs into her neck.
Dean is shocked. He didn’t expect that question nor did he expect Bobby to not blink an eye at him killing his own dad.
“You bitch!” He throws a towel at her as she laughs away. He chuckles to himself before turning back to the stove. He’s not ready to see John again but, goddamnit, he’s ready to see Sammy again even if it’s last time.
Dean pushes away from Sam and grabs her bag. “Take care, Sammy. Study hard! Harvard ain’t taking any B’s, bitch!”
Dean turns off the shower. He feels like he’s going to throw up. He wishes Benny was here. “From what you’ve told me, it seems like she was trying not to be a guy.”
John stands from the sofa. “Your very own gun. Now that you’re old enough, I’ll start taking you on hunts so you can learn how to handle yourself out there.”
“Yes,it went well, Jared.” She smiles and starts towards the door. “Deanna just had a few questions about being a school counselor, like me. I hope I gave her enough motivation to do well in school.”
John leaves, slamming the door behind him. Mary lets out a long sob before trying to stand. She feels nauseous so she runs to the toilet and spews bile into the toilet. She must not have eaten yesterday before the hunt.
Sam stood and left. Dean waited for the door to close before he leaned forward. “This doesn’t involve Samantha’s case, but I was wondering how she came out to you as trans?”
Dean grips the steering wheel briefly before covering his face with his hands. “You don’t have the right to tell me that making that demon deal was a mistake. If I had the chance to do it again, I would. No hesitation. He’s my brother, Ben. He’s like my own kid, with how much I raised him.”
If John keeps hunting, these kids will be here more often. Bobby thinks about how John ignored his kids and went straight to shower. If he had kids, they would be the first thing he checked. Bobby walks to the kitchen to make a drink. He’ll stay here and wait to see if John ever checks up on Mary and Sam.
“Ain’t no time like now to see that bastard's face.” Dean smiles and looks over to Sam. “Heya, Sammy. You and Charlie are going to Bobby’s to load up while Benny and I try to run the bitch around.”
“Dad?” Sam’s voice is soft. Dean looks quickly to Sam’s hands and sees a shiny pistol sitting in them. “What is this?”
“Not to spoil the moment or anything, but I’m kinda hungry. How about to tell Stanford you’re going while I make us some sandwiches.”
“You just have to be you, Dean.” Bobby tears up. “That’s all you have to be. Is this Testosterone dangerous?”
“You look just like her!” John yells. He throws another shoe at her before he rushes over to her to hold her down.
“I know.” Dean clears his throat. “I’m safe. I have an apartment and a job now so I got steady income. I wanted to call and let you know. That I’m, uh, alright and stuff.”
“It’s, uh, it’s fine.” Sam sniffs. “She was like a mom to me. Practically raised me herself while my dad hunted for the demon who killed my biological mom.”
Bobby laughs again before looking back at Cassie. “I’m sorry about your dad. Dean didn’t say anything about it.”
“No, brother,” Benny punches his nose. “She may have a dick but that’s not what decides her gender. She most likely felt like a woman so she decided to become one to make herself happy.”
“...missing the last three homeworks still, Miss Winchester. I need you to turn them in by the end of the week and I won’t mark down any points for it being late. I’m concerned for your grade, that’s all.”
“You got it, Sam.” Charlie spins the keys around her fingers before opening the driver’s door. “I’m driving, then, Chewie.”
Bobby sighs and looks down. “Yeah, maybe. He’s supposed to come back from a hunt today or tomorrow.”
They both turn to look at where Sam is pointing and Dean sees both hounds standing a few feet away. Dean looks at the two of them.
He sighs before turning to look at the door. Kelly waves at him. “Sorry, Mr. Willer. I just wanted to talk to Miss Winchester before she left.”
Dean stares at Sam for a second before being nudged by the woman. He jumps for a second before sticking out his hand. “Nice to meet you, Sam.” he says gruffly.
“No way!” Sam yells as he pulls out a couple of books from the wrapping paper he shredded. Dean smiles widely as she looks at Sam’s face. “You got me pre-law books, Mary? How did you know?”
“Sure am.” Jeff says. He pats the impala’s roof. “You sure you want to take two cars? I’m sure if we both go in mine we’ll be alright.”
Mary zips up the bag before looking at Bobby. “I want to go. It’s my chance to prove to my dad that I can be a man.”
Mary is sobbing when John finally leaves to go hunt whatever monster he tracked here. She slowly gets up, blood and semen dripping down her thighs as she shakily makes her way to the bathroom. She turns on the light to see her ghostly face. There is green starting to show on her neck from where John choked her. She checks her pulse to make sure she’s not dead and feels it slamming hard under the pressure of her fingers. Mary cries. Why is she still alive?
Charlie was at ComicCon and Sam was up north having some type of memorial for Jess’s birthday so he went on a hunt alone.
Bobby smiles. “In that case, I don’t know if you should sleep at your girlfriend's house until you give her a ring.”
Charlie places a hand on Dean’s forearm. “It’ll be okay, Dean. If it gets to be too much, we can leave. He can’t stop you from living your life, especially after what he did.”
“What if,” the principal says, leaning forward in his chair. “What if I get your teachers to let you take the finals early? We can rush your diploma and you’d graduate early.”
“Mary, you take that and use it for yourself. Not for your dad or for Sam- for you. I know you haven’t gotten a lot of gifts, especially from your dad, but I want you to take this. God knows you might need it if your dad doesn’t come back from a hunt.”
“I know a runner when I see one.” Charlie leans on the hood of the car. “Like notices like, and whatnot.”
“Dean is…” Charlie pauses. She really needs to let Dean tell the rest of it, but she’ll at least hint to Sam about who Dean is to him. “Well, he’s not actually my biological brother.”
When they make it to the motel, Dean can’t walk because of a broken ankle, courtesy of John Winchester after he lost the werewolf.
John twists his face into a glare for a second before he looks down and steps back. “Fine. For now.”
“No!” Sam looks up to see Charlie’s disapproving stare. “I just think she should be careful around Benny, especially because he’s a vampire.”
Dee is still in shock, her eyes are glazed over and she doesn’t pay attention to anything Kelly says. “You can...like if I wanted to be a boy I could?”
“Thanks, man.” Sam points up to the second floor. “He’s in room 32. Go ahead and knock, I’ll be across the hall.”
“Yeah,” Cassie says, putting it back on. “We met in English class, we were reading Much Ado About Nothing and had a project on it. We were partnered on it. Got an A plus on it, thanks to Dean. I didn’t understand it at first but he explained it to me so well.”
Sam sighs and pinches his nose. “Dean, I’m not your brother, but I do care for you like one. Just be safe, okay?”
“With me.” John says as he locks the door, the “do not disturb” sign on the outside. “Get undressed, Mary.”
Dean sprints towards the burning building as people cry out for him to stop. Inside, he makes his way to Sam’s apartment number and rushes inside. He knows Jessica is dead. He saw Azazel kill her before sticking her to the ceiling. He was too late for her, but he can get her body out for Sam.
“Sam didn’t want to leave you to fend for yourself.” Charlie says, wincing as Dean pressed into a bruise on her arm. “I told him about the deal.”
Dean sighs as he watches Charlie almost run to her house across the street. This chick was crazy but Dean almost found it endearing. He locks the car and turns back to the house. Everything was still packed so it will be an easy change. He shifts the papers at the desk until he finds the apartment he was looking at earlier.
Dean nods and rushes around the room to find a piece of paper. When she finds it and starts writing, Sam rushes into the room.
After checking into a shady motel, Dean grabs his switchblade and looks in the mirror. He sets the blade on the counter and then starts sectioning off his hair. He knows he’ll have to get actual clippers, but if he gets it as close as possible now he can worry about that later.
Mary shrugs. “He dropped me off here. He’s probably at the motel with my little brother. He’s five.”
“See! You called Dean a ‘she’ again!” Charlie stands up from the bed. “You never called Dean ‘she’ before he told you and now look at you! Dean has suffered so much for you-!” Charlie gasps. “Shit!”
Bobby reaches into a cabinet, pulling out a card. “Before I forget, I gotchu something. It ain’t much, but I figure you and Cassie can go to a nice place and get some rich guy’s attention.”
“She was the best.” Sam looks out the window so Charlie doesn’t have to see him tear up. “She looked exactly like my mom, according to dad. I remember how she always helped me with homework and cooked meals for me after school. She always wore her hair in a braid. She also protected me from dad whenever he tried to teach me to hunt. I remember one time she was sick and stayed in her room for a week and I learned how to shoot with my dad. I was about 6 at the time. I hated it.”
Mary does as she’s told and her cold naked body sinks into the bed. John moves to unbuckle his pants with one hand.
“No, daddy!” Mary almost yells, wincing at the noise she made. “I won’t lie anymore, sir. I’m sorry. I guess the ghost messed with my memory, huh?”
“Well, after Aunt Karen died, our family cut off all ties with Uncle Bobby.” Charlie loops an arm around Dean’s. “Dean here wanted to find out what happened to her so he started hunting for information. That led us here, where we figured out demons were real.”
The door opens and Sam can hear voices. He stands slowly before meandering towards the door as quietly as he can. There’s a flash of red hair before he hears the voices clearly.
Charlie nods, waiting to see if he’ll say more. Dean flips the sandwich in the pan and the sizzle fills the silence.
John nods and swallows the liquid. “That should be fine, Mary, but I want you ready for me when I get back. I’m going to the bathroom, I expect the car to be packed with everything by the time I get out.” He slams the glass down and heads to the bathroom.
Dean tightens his bandages and stares at himself in the mirror. He studies the feminine way his eyes are and how his lips are more womanly than any man’s. He starts seeing his old body, the one John violated over and over again. He takes a deep breath in. “Yeah, well, I did too. Dad always said gay people were another type of monster that needs to be exterminated.”
“You’ll be too late if you don’t tell him now.” She said a few months ago when picking for a convention. “Something will happen and you’ll miss your chance.”
“Dean, let me introduce you to Sam.” Bobby gestures to Sam. “Sam, this is Dean Bradbury, my nephew on my wife’s side.”
Charlie throws her arms across her chest. “Sam, not to make you seem like a narcissist, but Dean does have a life outside of you. I don’t know much about his relationship with Benny, but I do know that they enjoy each other’s company. That’s all I can really ask for, you know?”
Dean looks down, furrowed brow drawing lower on her face as she makes a knee-jerk decision. “Yeah, well, better than him doing it to you.”
She runs back inside and quickly packs everything she has. She’s finally leaving. She has the journal and the car, she’ll be fine. She slings the bag over her shoulder and turns to see a man leaning on the door of the room.
The demon shrugs. “Well, yeah, but I’ve been keeping my eyes on you Winchesters to see if the golden ticket was true or not. Turns out, John’s success wasn’t because of himself but because of you.” He steps closer to Dean. “So tell me, why does an intelligent girl like you stay with a drunken lowlife like your dad?”
She slams a fist on the counter. She can’t say it. She looks at the clock again. 7:52. She can’t say it.
“I’m not losing the hound, Ben.” Dean doesn’t look at Benny, continuing to stare out the front window. “I’m dropping you off in the next city and I’ll try to gank it back in Lawrence. Who knows,” Dean finally looks at Benny, tears forming in his eyes. “Maybe I can take him with me.”
“Yup,” Dean thrums his fingers against the wheel. “Demon is out. Samantha has no earthly possession she was tied to so that means we have to find out who killed her.”
Sam shakes his head again as he watches Charlie almost run to the kitchen. He looks back at Dean to see him and Benny staring at each other again. Bobby makes eye contact with Sam before gesturing to the cake.
Benny is silent in the passenger seat. He folds one leg on the Impala’s bench and stretches an arm towards Dean. Dean takes Benny’s hand in his before continuing.
“No.” Dean says. He takes the keys out of his pocket before heading to the drivers side door. “It looks like his MO but the guy didn’t have yellow eyes. Must have been a lackey or something.”
“Well, I’m going to give you this one. You can take the trailer to carry it back to- what was it? Detroit?”
“Mary!” John says as he steps out of the car. Kevin and Freddie jump apart as John stalks towards them. “Get away from these fags!”
John turns his eyes toward her. Her resemblance to her namesake is almost uncanny. The only difference is how young she is. “Yes.”
Castiel licks his suddenly dry bottom lip and speaks, his mind wandering, but trying to stay on the situation at hand.
Castiel reluctantly lets go of Dean’s hand, and Lisa leads them to a pew. Dean ever so slightly looks back to see Cas run the hand that was holding his over the back of his mouth.
Castiel turns around in Dean’s arms, his eyes wet with unshed tears and he shows his raw beauty to the man he loves.
Father Novak sits in his confessional, a place he often finds comforting – tending to the worries of his flock. For when one worries over the worries of another, they often are able to forsake their own.
Butterflies in his core cause Castiel to let Dean’s hand go, hoping no one else notices the flush to his cheeks, the blood travelling places he really could not deal with at the moment. He didn’t want to let Dean go, he never wanted to let him go again. He only wanted Dean everywhere.
“Yes, she felt she was doing society a favor. Which maybe she was? But who is to say one’s life is more sacred than another’s?”
He sees the priest gripping the sides of the counter tight, and he wonders what kinda nerve he hit. He waits for Father Novak to respond. He sees the tears forming in his eyes when he finally does turn around and answer.
Ben pulls the journal out from underneath his jacket and hands it to the priest. “I couldn't show it to Mom, I’d get in trouble, and Dean, well, uh, Dean would just kinda not talk about it. So, I thought maybe you could help me with it, oh hell, I don’t know.”
Dean pats the back of Cas’s hand before releasing them. He was gonna find whatever bastard did this to Cas, fuck, to them.
“Then don’t fight, Cas. You don’t fight for anything, do you?” He regrets it, and thanks Cas’s God that he’s not in front of the priest now because he would immediately atone.
Mary simply shrugs. She changes the blood bags again and watches as the color slowly fades from the man’s face.
Castiel, emissary of the Lord, thinks of his dream, the memory of Dean’s lips on his, and an emotion comes through on his occasionally stoic face. He wants to say many things to Dean, wants to offer for Dean to take them off for him if they’re so ugly, wants to slip back into their flirty banter that always ended with them in bed, or on the couch, or on the floor a couple times.
Cas sits with his hands around the mug of coffee they made. He looks to Dean who, characteristically, is staring back at him – his own mug of coffee in hand. Cas made it mechanically, knowing that although the agent said ‘black’ he really preferred caramel creamer and one sugar.
Dean’s breath dries the moisture on Cas’s bottom lip. Dean’s eyes flit from Cas’s lips to his eyes, asking for a permission that was always granted. Dean tentatively moves closer, their lips now brushing. He gently takes Cas’s bottom lip between his and he is
Cas laughs, “Well, it is the only thing I can bake. Do you mind if I get started? I can find my way around.”
Cas stands tall, knowing he is innocent, knowing who committed the crime, and that knowledge comforts him.
Once everyone heads home, Dean and Cas make their way hand in hand into their home filled with love.
“You two were some of my best agents, and I know you’re retired now, and write books and some shit, but I miss the hell outta you both.”
Dean knows that Cas is aware they are still being watched through the two way mirror, but he can see Cas’s shoulder’s relax and he relishes in it.
“Are we going to discuss it from this position, or…” Cas really needed Dean off the floor somewhere a safe distance away.
Sam nods and licks his bottom lip. He is able to breathe calmly, and the anger dissipates, it soon turns into worry.
Yeah, he did. For wanting to fuck Cas in the apple orchard. That’s what he felt guilty for. The apple orchard of a fucking church on top of that. And what did it take for Dean Winchester to want to deflower his old love in a church’s garden? A fucking brushing together of their hands. That was all. No kiss, no hand holding. Their hands merely brushed and Dean wanted him then and there.
“Call me Bobby, kid. Mr. Singer makes me sound so old.” He lets a smile escape the corner of his mouth as he pulls up a chair for Mary to stand on while he cooks.
“My bet is on the friend, Anthony Johnson. He was the one who was ranting about how Shawn deserved what he got.”
“I’ll drink to that.” Bobby lifts his drink to Dean’s before taking a gulp. “Guess I should break it up before I have to buy any new furniture.”
“Your ghost, Samantha,” Benny sits down on the freshly made bed. “Is a murdered trans woman. She was killed by her transphobic aunt who seems to be a witch.”
“Get out of here, sickos! Don’t come near my daughter ever again!” John spits at them before turning to push Mary into the car. She hits her head on the roof but John doesn’t notice.
***Very Triggering, this is your last warning. Don't worry, everything here and more will be alluded to in later chapters : ) ***
Dean turns back to the house. He can hear Charlie scream again and runs back inside. “Charlie? Sam?”
Dean rolls her eyes. “I know that. I was the one who bought him his first suit and all those lawyer books.” She takes a sip of the eggnog before continuing. “They’re both stubborn as mules. Once they have an idea planned, they’ll do anything to finish it. Only thing we can do is make sure they don’t come to blows.”
She starts to go back up the stairs but turns backs while Sam starts up another argument with John. “Uh, Uncle Bobby? I need your help getting my bag, it’s, uh, too high for me to reach.”
“Daddy? Mommy?” She yells toward the house. Mary takes a step toward the door and hopes to see her parents coming out. Sam let out a very long wail at the motion and Mary shifts him in her arms. “Sammy, it’s okay. Mommy and daddy are coming just wait. They’re both going to come and get you and mommy will sing her special song for us. Do you remember the song Sammy?”
Mary watches him leave, her heart seems to disappear as she looks out the window to see firefighters come out of their truck.
“Don’t forget to update the journal with the notes I left you. We’ll need it tomorrow.” John grabs the bag and walks to the passenger door of Jeff’s truck. “Let’s get going, you can debrief me on the way.”
“Okay, Mr. Gill.” She whispers, turning to look back to where her dad was being helped up by some EMTs. She hears sirens as soon as she steps through the front door of the Robertson's house.
Dean holds her breath as she pauses in her collection of the tissue paper. John’s jaw twinges under the force of his anger.
Dee was caught off guard. She pauses for half a second before continuing packing up her things. “My dad says they’re sick and they need to get better. He also told me about how gays dress up as women to trick normal guys into dating them or that the men will try to get close to kids while dressed up so they can rape them.”
The door to the classroom opens as she debates whether or not to call Uncle Bobby to help them. The woman who walks in introduces herself as Jane’s mother. Jane Trinnison was a bitch who always shoved Diana around because she thought Dee was too much of a tomboy.
Dean smiles wider before stepping out of the car. “You gonna show me your yellow brick road, then, huh?”
Crowley nods and snaps. “Very well. Moose over there should wake up in a few minutes. I’ll see you in a year or so.Tah, Squirrel.”
Benny sighs and looks at the ceiling. “Cher, I don’t know what you’re going through, but it can’t be worse than when I first offered to go down on you.”
“Yeah, Mary?” Bobby sets his beer down. This is probably going to be a deep conversation if Dean sounds shaken up. “What’s wrong?”
In the Impala, Sam looks out the window. “So this dude died a year ago, seemingly stabbed to death with no one around and a baggie of spell ingredients in it. A few weeks ago, the guy’s aunt reports that he’s haunting her house. I don’t get it.”
Crowley walks over and circles Dean. “My, you’re looking manlier than ever. That red head site knows her stuff, eh?”
“Dean, are you crazy?” Sam takes a deep breath in. “You’re always the one saying monsters don’t have any humanity- that they all should be killed! And, what, this one vampire is the exception?”
Benny shrugs. “Sam will have to kill me to get me to leave. I can’t willingly leave Dean. He’s such a great lay.”
She can’t do this. She can’t look at John the same after this. She covers her mouth to quiet the crying.
Kelly was taken aback. How did a twelve year old girl recognize Kelly was hiding something. She realized she hadn’t responded for a few minutes.
“I live a little ways north from here. Carencro. I’m trying to find the one that turned me so I can kill him.”
It may not have seemed like I supported you leaving, I understand why you want to. I hope this helps you get started on doing what you love. try not to forget me while you’re gone, bitch!”
“Mary, from now on, you tell no one what happens on our yearly hunts, got it? Otherwise I may just kill you.” His pants hit the floor with a loud thud. Mary winces. “And I don’t want to do that. I can’t lose her, Mare, you understand?”
“Hey, Sam, it’s gonna be okay.” Bobby gets out of his chair and kneels to hug Sam. Sam cries for a few minutes before a knock sounds at the door.
Dean throws what turns out to be a salt shaker at the hellhound and watches as it whimpers at the smoke rising from where the salt touched it. He’ll have to add that to the journal if he gets out of this.
Charlie looks down. “Parents weren’t accepting of me being, well, a dyke for lack of a better word.”
“Your name is Mary Winchester. You have a younger brother, Sammy, who you need to watch because daddy has to go to work. You will be the best you can be because you like to make your daddy proud. You are Mary Winchester and you need to stop lying.”
Bobby leans back in his chair. He goes through his memories of Mary and recalls moments where she would seem to be more of a tomboy than a girly girl. The long arguments for school dances where she didn’t want to wear dresses, the flinches whenever Bobby referred to her as ‘she’ and Mary a few years back. He knows this didn’t come out of nowhere, but he still feels surprised.
She pulls a tiny portion of her bottom lip in her mouth and smiles, creating a somewhat fearsome illusion. He wondered how such a sexy look on one could be terrifying on another. She knows there is so much more to this, so much more than this priest knows, and she loves having the upper hand.
Dean decides it's up to him to break the slightly awkward tension. He wipes his eyes, clears his throat, and asks:
While he is still under, Mary finds a vein on his right arm and sticks her needle into it, beginning to fill the first bag. She gets the Styrofoam cooler she bought and begins to fill it with ice from the family’s freezer.
Father Novak enjoys this time in the early morning before mass. He watches as the sunlight filters in through the ancient stained-glass windows, illuminating his morning coffee in a myriad of colors. He could never get the brew just right, it was always too bitter or too light, and he knows, he just
Castiel Novak often made a type of hum in response when Dean said this, but it wasn’t appropriate today. Nor was his characteristic eyebrow. Instead he simply nods good naturedly and begins to stroll around the grounds with his hands behind his back - Dean at his side.
Dean hangs up the phone and throws it onto the seat next to him. He puts baby in “Drive” and heads to the house to drop off the food.
Jimmy and Amelia’s anniversary was a classy affair and there was wine and dancing. Just to show they could, they decided to get loaded on that wine and Dean doesn’t remember much of the night after that. He does remember waking up wearing nothing but Cas’s tie and a note of reprimand from Cas’s very religious twin brother.
Cas needing him changed something in Dean’s demeanor, something he couldn’t explain. It was always like this between them - when Cas melted, Dean was there. Fuck yeah, he still wanted Cas. Especially in Dean’s old shirt, but not a damn thing would make him act on it.
Mary Winchester rose from bed to a strange noise in her youngest son’s nursery. She looked beside her for her husband, who was not there. She huffed a laugh through her nose slightly, he must have fallen asleep watching television again. She would get him from the recliner after she checked on her baby.
“Thanks, Father Novak.” Ben stands up, somewhat relieved, the journal’s knowledge was given to a priest, and he felt that was a safe place to put it.
Mary was unable to scream as a gloved hand clapped her mouth. She tried to grab him anywhere she could to gain purchase, but all her efforts were futile. He held a blade to her throat and his arm pinned her body to his. She struggled, but her fight was in vain.
The all too familiar position throws Father Novak into a memory that was never too far from the forefront of his mind.
He points to the strawberry jam on the table in-between them. “We’re running low on jelly, but we have honey, honey comes from bees, bees are like less annoying and more helpful wasps, wasps are building a nest on our porch, so we need…”
Of course he couldn’t remember all the events, not all the specific dates, but some? Yeah, they stuck out.
Sam thinks back to how when Dean used to choose their movie nights with Cas it was always Westerns, and how he was just sure Dean had a couple cowboy hats in their bedroom.
Cas rips the collar from his neck and throws it onto the desk, unbuttoning his first top buttons with one hand.
“Yes, Gregory Ball. Contrary to his belief, not of mason jar fame. Is there anything I can assist you with? Dean knows I will immediately contact him if I discover any helpful information.” Cas has a sneaking suspicion as to why Benny is there, but he doesn’t want to allow Benny to catch on to his knowledge.
“What, it’s God’s decision?” She scoffs, opening her desk’s front drawer, pulling out a letter opener. She begins to go through the department mail on her desk.
“You gonna pretend you’re not a part of this?” He was more than a part of it - he was it. He was the one who became so obsessed with Bloody Mary it drove the first bit of wedge between them. He was the one who knew her signature backwards and forwards, he was the one who knew
Dean nods. “Yeah, except that’s how Cas loves me, I just got too used to testing it. I know better now, and you didn’t ruin us, you hear me? I’m not my dad, and Cas, Cas is a good man.”
Dean knows he’s right and he feels like an idiot for even asking. He wants to be near Cas, but yeah, the man was right, it was not the best time. But he couldn’t help but feel rejected.
And then it dawned on him. She was framing him, but that was far too evident, there had to be more. But what?
“I don’t have the answer, Ben, I wish I did. What I do know is that your mom is a wonderful and loving woman. I have rarely seen a light as bright as hers. She is kind, considerate, caring, and warm. I also know Dean is trying his best. But as far as happiness, I do not know. Sometimes, all we can do is try our best in a world where it is far too easy to do our worst.”
He pulls a map up and pinpoints the locations along with the times. His hands begin to shake and he drags his hand down his mouth. He needed to remember every second of those events so he can alibi Cas. Again.
“All you did Mary, or whatever your name is, is end up in a fucking jail cell. And it stops here. This fucked up cycle stops here.”
“So, now what?” He didn’t ask to be accusatory, or to be unkind, he wanted Cas to recognize what he needed for himself.
John pushes him back abruptly and forces himself into the room, in the nick of time to see his wife in the shape of a cross on the floor. He grabs Sammy from the crib, places him into Dean’s arms, and yells:
Cas felt sick to his stomach. This was the worst type of killer, for no matter what, they felt they were right. And he hated that he might have agreed with her. He hated many aspects of this.
“Yeah well, too bad, you’re stuck with me. We’re gonna settle down on some lakefront property and be that couple everyone hates because they’re so grossly in love.” He meant every word, and with every stroke of his hand on Cas’s strong arms, he meant it more.
This wasn’t the man who would tenderly love him, who would kiss his skin up and down with almost the ghost of lips. The man who would help anyone and everyone who needed him. This wasn’t the man who would pick up spiders to take them outside instead of killing them. It wasn’t the man who rescued a baby bird and named him Gabriel in honor of his brother who insisted he could fly and broke an arm and kept until he could fly on his own. Was it?
“No one helped me when I needed it over thirty years ago, when my father was gunned down in front of me by an obsessed bastard who thought he was doing the right thing, so I help those who needed it like I did when I was sent from one family to another, time after time. I’m the person I needed when I was younger.”
“You know the man Dean was with before you?” The man who changed his brother, the one who gave everything, every aspect of life he knew to be immersed in and drowned by Dean, a love so strong Sam naively thought it could never be anything but perfect. The man who placed his mark permanently on Dean Winchester, that man.
They are both nervous here, in the garden surrounded by flowers of all types. A dogwood shedding the last petals of summer falls around them, and Dean notes how they’re in a fairy tale. Dean’s hands explore Cas’s back and he finds Cas doing the same. Their heartbeats increase as their faces move closer to one another.
Mary shakes her hand as well, smiling benevolently all the while. She shakes her head fondly as she notices Joe’s tell-tell signs of finding a woman attractive. Joe blushes slightly and looks down at his shoes, it’s such a tell, and Mary thinks it’s somewhat adorable. Lisa was a lovely woman.
He remembered being there for Claire’s birthday. He remembers that Cas was in charge of bringing the surprise cake that made Claire roll her eyes. And Cas did go alone if he remembered right, but he wasn’t gone for over an hour was he? And that wasn’t enough time to bleed out a person was it? Dean didn’t go because he decided to make the kid watch
Dean’s hand left his face and returned to the steering wheel. The anger returned, but this time not at Cas - at Bloody Mary.
She releases the knife, and Cas stands, breathless, and pushes her against the wall. He holds the blade to her throat and she smiles.
“I knew the moment this kid came in with his mess of hair that was not combed into regulation, and gardenias that Dean was gonna be hopeless. Just that kid’s type. Only he wasn’t, not to Dean yet. I knew. I’ve seen them save each other countless times over the years, and all I can say is thank God we finally made it here.”
They worked at the same university – Joe a professor of microbiology, and Mary a Literature professor. That’s where she met him.
Dean looks at his watch. He wants to be with Cas, wants Cas to intoxicate him with his being. He wants to alleviate the guilt, forget the world, and just fucking be with the man he loves even if neither of them can do a damn thing about it.
Dean can’t help one last glance at a body he knows he will probably never get to explore with his hands again.
Fear is an odd thing. It can cause flight or fight, and Mary Winchester, being the wife of John Winchester, FBI agent extraordinaire, chose fight without a second thought. She ran back towards the nursery, unarmed, unthinking of anything but her baby. She didn’t scream for John, she thought of nothing except the life of six month old Sam.
Cas puts his head in his hands. He begins to rub his temples and wipes his eyes before looking back at Sam.
“May I help you with anything?” He spreads his hands to indicate the table, and Lisa finds herself smiling.
He made himself feel important by belittling his husband, a meek, mild mannered man admired by everyone. He occasionally hit said husband in inconspicuous areas to make himself feel bigger. For bigger men had the right to hit smaller men, everyone knew this.
The agent waves her hand down in a faux dismissive manner. “Oddly enough, the main attraction around here is the new priest. He is quite the dish.”
The ‘Babe’ slipped, but Dean didn’t regret it for some reason. Being alone around Cas made a lot of things slip, and he knew, he knew he should hate himself for them but somehow, someway, he didn’t.
Mary watches as Susan Struthers, Shenandoah Valley’s local real estate agent extraordinaire, leads them throughout the three bedroom ranch style home. Susan, as she insisted to be called, was everything Mary disliked - fake. Mary figured everything the woman did was for show. She waltzed through the house in her bright yellow dress with an oversized red bead necklace, pointing to all the “upgrades” the house has - such as granite countertops. Maybe they were upgrades, Mary didn’t know - nor did she care. She did admire the sealed tile flooring - it would be oh so easy to clean blood up from that. Not that she shit where she ate or anything.
Cas blows air out through his mouth and looks at himself in the mirror. This is what happened before he left - where he was the suspect. Only this time, he doesn’t have Dean.
Dean shakes his head in disbelief, kisses her forehead, and goes to leave. How Lisa had not achieved sainthood yet was beyond him.
She does not anticipate his strength and as they struggle for control of her hand she knees him in the groin, rendering him to double over, but not letting go of her hand. She is afraid her wrist will break and she hits him on the back, but the maneuver does nothing to sway the man of God.
Mary places the jar on the table and notices Dean and Sam standing in the doorway. Dean’s eyes move to the jar, and she sees the moment everything ‘clicks’ in green eyes.
Cas sips the all too perfect coffee gingerly as he pursues the community’s news on his tablet. His heart stills when he comes across an all too familiar murder.
“I thought it was him, all right? I was so tired of never catching a break on the bastard and I saw the perfect opportunity. There wasn’t a doubt in my mind once these started up again here, that it was him. There ain’t enough coincidences in the Universe for that. I thought he was insane, I thought he was split, I would’ve died for that belief. I thought that I had already lost a leg for that belief. Yeah, your Cas saved my life, but I thought Bloody Mary shot me. You understand? I wanted him to pay for that. So yeah, I got the hair from the church while he was otherwise occupied, and I planted it.”
The voice was smoky, raspy, as if she had smoked for twenty years straight, but there was no undulation in it. He recognized her as Mary. He found himself smiling. Her voice was like a good shot of whiskey and he tried not to allow himself to be drunk by it.
Dean freezes, he sets the plate he was washing down, feeling like an absolute idiot for not instantly recognizing that Cas had made that pie. Of course he had. Cas was cleaning up in the very kitchen he was standing in now, cleaning up from making that pie. And one damn bite sent him back to the first time Cas made him that pie - his first birthday with his new boyfriend. He feels like an ass for even saying that to Lis, and wait, how did she know about Cas?
“All right, I’ll go with it.” Dean couldn’t think of a reason not to go with it. “So what was the trigger this time, why start back right after I moved here?” Fuck! Why? Was it him as well?
Dean regards him with one eyelid open and one shut comically, trying to eek a smile from the young teen in front of him who was, at the moment, much too serious. “She say anything else?”
“I suggest you turn yourself in.” He also knew that wouldn’t work. But for some reason he felt the need to say it. A compulsion, more or less.
Bobby nods and wraps Dean in a hug Dean allowed himself to melt into. Bobby pats his back firmly with finality and backs away, holding Dean at arm’s length.
Dean pauses in the store as he leans ever so slightly on a display, making an array of persimmons fall all over the floor, spilling over and over as if they would never stop.
Benny hands him a bag, and Cas pulls a couple of hairs out of his head to stick in it. He seals it, writes on it with a Sharpie from his nightstand, and hands it back.
. And Cas needed to be an active participant in that, in what Dean perceived to be his healing. Their healing. And fuck it, Dean was pissed that Cas didn’t divulge this shit three years ago. They could’ve worked through this and he would’ve been saved from three years of sweat-soaked nightmares. Forgiveness doesn’t always mean peace.
Dean kept his grip on the steering wheel, feeling the leather, trying to get the feeling to ground him. His anger is seeping through, and he unconsciously grits his teeth. He forgave Cas for leaving, but this, this was new. Why would Cas keep this to himself? What was the fucking point? Cas always had a reason - even if Dean felt those reasons were misguided. He loved the stupid bastard, but he felt anger he had let go of only that morning resurface, and he didn’t know how much more forgiveness he had in him.
But there was just something about the priest that made that impossible. Maybe it was the slight purplish tint beneath blue eyes, maybe it was kindness the man generated, or maybe, just maybe, she understood in a way.
“You don’t have a very extensive vocabulary, do you Mr. Whitmire?” She watched with a languid expression, knowing her knots would hold - as she had ample confidence in her own ability.
“I want you.” She utters emphatically, surprising the man beside her. “I have had many boyfriends, Dean. But you, you’re different, you work so hard to make this work, and I could never want more than that.”
That one grip sends electrical impulses through Dean’s hand into the pit of his stomach, and he cannot form a single coherent sentence. He wonders how Cas can stand there so cool, so collected, surely, he must feel it too?
Stall, think. Maybe Mary meant she killed an abuser, or something like a bug. But he knew that no, that wasn’t it. He knew who was now in his confessional - he
“Trying to frame Cas with that hair.” That was what led them to her after all, the frame job that was so obviously a set up.
Dean nods as he turns, drying dishes. Something in him breaks here - and he struggles not to hate himself even more for it. It wasn’t a breakup, it was the love of his life walking away because they couldn’t pull their heads out of their asses. It was Cas and him both giving up, it was Dean slowly realizing that blame belonged not only on Cas but on him as well. It was Cas slipping through his fingers every night in a new type of raw loss. It was crying into Lisa’s beautiful dark hair, it was bereavement, it was loss, it was the type of pain that made Dean want to give up, He didn’t have a breakup - he lost everything, including himself.
? Did Dean tell you he died?” Eileen blurted without thinking, because how could Dean do that to Lisa? But she should have known better, because Dean, for all his faults, would have never done that.
“I dug deeper into it than I had ever dug into a case before. I learned the men whom she killed were not good men. They were abusers, some terribly. I felt they deserved to die.”
“You see, when Marcy came into my office, I saw the thumbprint you left on her wrist. She thought she had covered it up, but my eyes are somewhat trained to see signs of abuse.”
“Father Novak, we moved in yesterday, and we wondered if you would like to come over for dinner perhaps tomorrow night?”
Her instinct was to grab Sam and then run for Dean’s room. Hopefully barricading themselves in Dean’s closet until John could take care of whoever was terrorizing their night. But she didn’t have the chance.
“That’s what your type likes to think, isn’t it? That there’s absolutely no reason to kill. Even your sacred book says there is a time to kill.”
Cas’s relief is evident in a flood of tears from blue eyes. Dean bites the inside of his cheek to keep from spilling his own.
“Okay, where do we go from here? Hm? If you are telling the truth, and only wished to be absolved from a past sin, and plan to commit no more, I have no moral leg to stand on. After all these years, I finally caught the murderer and I can do nothing about it.”
Cas nods as he leads Dean to his bedroom. Cas regained composure by this point, and regrets embracing Dean, but not enough to apologize for it.
The doe-eyed woman in bed beside him begins rubbing his upper arm. She smiles at him slightly, knowing not to belay the pain of his dream, yet trying to reassure him of his future.
Mary shrugs as she drags the ice chest to the coffee table. She sits across from the man on the couch, her legs straight in front of her, with her hands folded neatly on top of her lap. Her eyes roam to the half-filled blood bag, and his eyes follow, causing a panic strain against the ropes once more.
“Do you bake?” Dean had forgotten to pick up the premade dessert. She actually didn’t know how she could ask a guest with such ease, but in spite of everything, Cas felt familiar and asking felt okay, if not right? She was a bit confused herself, but sometimes emotions just had to be gone with. Dean taught her that.
Charlie looks at him, unamused. “If I didn’t adopt you as my unofficial big brother, I’d punch you for that.”
Cas rolls his eyes, knowing full well Dean couldn’t see but that it was necessary nonetheless. “Not like that.” He chuckles slightly. “She must have felt the same towards me. I wanted to catch her, but I also wanted to see what she would do next. That night, it all changed.”
Dean nods, he hates this part of Cas. The part that gives up so easily, the part that doesn’t allow him to work through it. He thinks he fucked up and that’s it, he lacks the ability to clean up his own mess. Even though Dean knows it’s because the man lost faith in himself, even though he lost the anger, this, this side of the man he loves still pisses him off.
Castiel panics at the silence, he strains to hear a noise. He finds a certain type of relief when she speaks.
Dean thinks about how Cas suggested those men might have deserved it and shakes his head. Not Cas, not now, not ever. He
Dean nods. “Right, because there was no evidence.” There were many coincidences, but no hard evidence.
“Okay, so you and me, we get a chance to solve this now.” Dean liked the sound of ‘you and me’ and who knows what would happen after this? Dean doesn’t allow himself to hope - but it is always kind of there, in the back of one’s head, that small flicker that refuses to be extinguished.
Dean lays his head on the steering wheel of Baby, steeling himself before he goes inside to Lisa. He doesn’t see the woman walking behind him on the sidewalk, away from the scene of her crime and into a car all her own.
as soon as their eyes connected. When their hands touched, it was as if Castiel’s organs were on fire. Mere skin to skin contact made him feel alive again, and he wanted Dean in every way imaginable.
“Your sin will not be truly absolved until you work within the confines of the law.” He knew he just had to say it, he knew it would do no good, not really, that this woman sharing the confessional with him would not be deterred, could not be deterred, but he had to
“I saw that bit in the paper about your women’s shelter.” Mary’s nostrils flare as she fingers the edge of the opener.
Cas’s brow scrunches and Dean smiles in spite of himself. He is fully turned around now, and the ease of this discussion is not lost on the F.B.I. agent.
Fuck! He keeps his idea to himself, because it would do no good at the moment, and wonders who could be the actual murderer. Okay, so she had an obsession with them, and she confessed to Cas. So, she must be close right?
Dean nods. “Yeah, that was my dad, I uh, read about it in his journal. God, this is so fucked up. So what? Huh? You did this to torture me and Cas? All these years? And where did we get, huh? What did we change?”
Dean punches Benny square on the jaw again, this time harder, causing the whole floor to look at them in bewilderment.
“I don’t know what to say, Lis. Yeah, our bond was stronger than anything I’ve known. And I…” Dean stops drying and turns to Lisa once more. “I didn’t just go through a break up, Lis, I uh…I lost everything. I lost not only Cas, but myself too, not because I didn’t know who I was without him or shit like that, but because I lost faith.” Dean thinks back to Cas’s words and scoffs bitterly. “I lost faith in myself, Lis. And I thought that’s what made me lose Cas, that’s why he left, and I wanted to hate him for leaving, you know? But I was too proud to try to get him back, too pissed to admit that I was wrong too. And the most important thing to me is staying, no matter how fucking stupid that is, because he needed to go, because he lost faith in himself too.” Dean doesn’t know if any of what he said made sense, but the last thing he wanted was this woman in front of him to feel like shit.
“I know you love me in the way you can, but you will never love me or anyone as much as you love Cas, I see that, I know that.”
“Look, I don’t blame you or that crazy aunt of yours anymore. Stray bullets happen, and he saved my life.”
“I often find myself thinking of him,” she lowers her voice and Castiel strains to hear, “You know, sexually... and I know that is essentially cheating on my husband.”
Castiel sits across from Benny and Dean, a cup of lukewarm water in front of him. Benny was asking questions and Dean kept going back and forth between staring and doing anything to avoid eye contact.
Ben nods as he peels the last apple. He begins to slice it into thin strips, putting the strips into the lemon water once more.
“Okay, so, if the men were abusers, and Cas was opening up a women’s shelter, this might be incendiary.”
Dean grabs Cas once more. He entangles his hand in Cas’s hair and seeks the heat Cas’s mouth always provided him. The (former) priest’s lips are parted in anticipation, his head malleable to Dean’s touch.
He walks up to Cas and puts his arms around him, only to be shoved off by impressively strong arms. Dean tries not to be offended, because he knew this wasn’t
“She was upset that I hadn’t told about the victims. She...she wanted people to know of her good works.”
With the exit of Melanie Hawkins, comes an outpouring of tears – physical reminders of everything the small-town priest lost when he walked away from Dean Winchester. There is an echo of him all around Castiel’s very existence, a constant reminder of what was, and what can never be again.
“This obsession does not lend itself to any rational thought, which explains the contents you find in there. Yes, it is disturbing that the person who made the entries took delight in killing the perpetrator in front of their child, but at that point they only had one goal in mind - to kill that transgressor. I am sorry you saw that, and read it, and I am so sorry it disturbed you, but I do not think there is anything to worry about, if that helps.”
“Not that the collar isn’t a major turn on, but uh, you think you maybe can uh, I don’t know, get out of it and back into the life of sin?” How he emphasized in his head the word ‘sin.’
Sam places a long arm on Cas’s knee. He hated seeing the man he so readily considered his brother in pain.
“Castiel.” It was firm, it was the voice Dean always used when Cas would obsess. It would occasionally work, but Dean could see his former love was too far gone this time.
“You know, your husband reminds me a great deal of mine. Kind, mild mannered men married to piranhas. The only difference is, you hunt those you feel are already in your power, the weak as you might call them. You see, I hunt for those who cannot hunt for themselves.”
The demon smiles as his eyes shift to black. “Well, Mary Deanna, you’re daddy has been killing a lot of my- ow!”
“Well, come on in. We’re waiting for John to come back. Tomorrow is Sam’s birthday so we were going to just get a cake tonight because Sam will be out with his friends tomorrow.”
Dean made a journal with all the information on monsters they’ve- John- encountered and how to kill them. John took the credit for it all, but he wouldn’t be able to kill anything if it wasn’t for her. She’ll make sure that John can’t hunt after she leaves.
“Son of a bitch!” Dean hits the dashboard before looking at Benny, rage in his eyes. “Shut up about my dad! You have no right! None! You don’t know how it was growing up and making sure Sam had everything he wanted while I was kicked down every time I asked why I had to do something!”
It’s a short service, just the three of them and Mary’s friend named Cassie. Cassie cried the entire time, talking about how she would miss her best friend. Her and Bobby talked after the service while Sam and John got into the Ford Mary and him fixed up the year prior.
“Funny,” Crowley says, brushing some blood from his suit. “Mary did say she didn’t care for him. Too... what’s the word. Desperate.”
Dean laughs softly. “I’m not going to say, ‘Sorry I don’t have a dick but you can still suck me dry’ to my own brother.”
Dean quickly wraps a towel around himself and looks for the wrap he uses to bind. “One second, let me grab clothes and you can talk to me through the bathroom door, perv.”
Dean sighs welty, tears gathering in his eyes. “Is it bad that I just want to sit with Benny for a while and try to forget this ever happened?”
“I’ll shower in a second.” Dean grumbles, whipping up some quick soup for lunch. “I’m a working man, I’ll shower when I want.”
Enclosed is information to access your college fund I set up for you. By the time you read this, there should be enough in it to cover almost all four years (with some financial aid...hopefully).
“Bobby, it was a stupid move. I get it.” Dean growls at him. “Don’t you think I regret ever agreeing with that fucking demon. I was selfish. I just wanted it to end.”
“I wanted to.” Dean rushes out. “I really did. I couldn’t do that, though. I would have to tell Sam everything and he doesn’t need that on his plate.”
“Like what, Dean?” Sam us confused. He gets out of the car and watches Dean almost run to his room. He sighs.
“Chill out, Sam.” Dean slams a hand onto the table. “I will personally chop his fucking head off of the time comes!”
Sam studies the envelope, wondering what it could be. He opens it to find a few pieces of paper. The first one is a bank statement for a few hundred thousand dollars in his name. He looks up at Bobby quickly.
“Not really, but I can only imagine.” The line is silent for a bit. “Not to make any excuses for Sam, but I’m sure that if he knows more about being trans, he’ll accept you.”
“...Freddie, we should just tell them. How bad can it be?” The redhead says. The brunette one sighs as he looks at the two types of bread in his hands.
“Don’t ever talk to those animals, Mare.” John says on their drive back to the motel. “They’re sick. They dress up as women just to lure in kids like you to rape them. If you see any fairies again you turn and run. I’ll understand if you don’t go grocery shopping then. I’ll come in with you next time, okay?”
Kevin stands up and looks at Freddie. “Oh, well, uh, they can. Not a lot of people like it, though, so we try to keep it a secret.”
Kelly freezes at hearing a twelve-year-old girl say the word ‘rape,’ and swallows. “But what do you think?”
Normally, Sam got the most gifts, next being John, then Uncle Bobby. Mary usually opened her gifts before Sam came down, which was weird but at this point it was tradition. Mary wasn’t here anymore, though, so Sam’s secret gift to her would never be opened.
Sam furrows his brow before shaking his head. “Yeah, it’s, uh, it’s kind of weird but I think I can accept that she’s gone now. I think having Dean’s birthday pushes down the fact that her and Dean would be around the same age. It gives me something else to focus on instead of missing her.”
“You want to drop out?” The principal asks. “You only have a little under a month left, are you sure?”
The two adults share a glance. Gill leads Mary towards their house across the street. “She might need water if she gets out. Let’s make sure we get enough.”
The couple looks at each other, silently communicating. Freddie clears his throat. “Well, kid, it’s not safe being by yourself at the store, especially for a little girl. DO you want us to walk with you?”
“Jess!” Sam tries to reach her but Dean grabs him and forces him to leave the room and Jessica behind.
Dee smiles. “You mean after that convincing argument?” She shifts in her seat, reaching towards her bag. “You hold yourself differently. That’s all. I won’t tell Jane if you’re hiding something from her, I know Christmas is coming up and you must have found something really great for her.”
They get out of the car and make their way towards the door. As soon as they open it, a voice says, “Hello, boys.”
“If it’s tomorrow,” Charlie says. “I hope you don’t mind us not being here longer. Obviously if it’s tonight, we’ll try to leave early.”
“Dean, are you stupid?” Sam yells at him from across the table. Charlie and Benny were outside the room, trying not to listen in. “A vampire? It’s going to go rogue and kill us all!”
Charlie turns onto Bobby’s street. “She sounds like a great sister. I’m sure she loves you very much.”
“‘All monsters are abominations.’” Dean recites from memories of John beating it into his memory. “Rule numero uno for hunters. It’s not personal, man.”
Charlie sighs. “Dean, John is a fucking demon. I don’t care if he isn’t a physical demon, he is the literal worst.”
“John might not do the same to bring Sam back, but John isn’t his father. I know you hate my choice, but c’mon, Benny. I would do anything for Sam.”
Bobby nods before walking toward the ever-growing noise from the living room. Dean folds the check and puts it in her bra. She’ll deposit most of it to Sam’s college fund she started and keep about a hundred just in case.
“Daddy, stop! You’re hurting me!” Mary yells. Her head hits the headboard with a loud crack before she blacks out.
“No, you don’t get it.” Dean pauses. “My roommate found someone who can supply testosterone so I can fully transition. I can’t ever be that girl you knew before.”
“Leave my girl alone, Jeff.” John opens the impala door. “If she doesn’t kill you then I will. Are you ready to go?”
“No you shouldn’t.” Bobby yells back. “You’re the best kid anyone could have asked for. You grew up too fast to take care of your brother and father. You deserve to be selfish.”
Mary looked at Sam. “Can I watch?” She looks up at Bobby. “I need to learn how to cook real food for my daddy and Sam. I don’t know how to make mac and cheese yet.”
She can’t go by Mary anymore. She can’t hear that name without thinking about...that. She doesn’t even feel like being Mary, let alone being a girl right now. She remembers how that gay couple told her that it’s okay to be gay but what about being a different gender? She doesn’t feel like a girl, especially after that night. What about...is a name change too much?
Dean coughs to cover up him thinking of something to say. “I saw a guy run out of my brothers apartment when I was coming to surprise him.”
“I don’t know if I’ll be able to say no to anything he says.” He scoops the sandwich onto a plate. “Do I even look that different? My voice just went down in pitch, but will he still recognize it?”
“Her name is Samantha, Sam. You’ve been reminded multiple times to call her Samantha and not her old name.”
“Now, Mary, I’m hunting an actual demon today with Jeff Stran, so I need you to make sure my bag is packed with things that will help me with a demon. You have that written in the journal, right?”
Bobby can tell something is wrong. He continues to sit and wait for Dean to tell him what’s bothering him as the sun goes down.
“The thing is, Sam,” Charlie tries not to look at him while she drives towards Bobby’s place. “Dean did make a deal.”
Christmas with Bobby was a quiet affair. Mary’s normal constant chatter was gone and John wasn’t here to start a yelling match with Sam like he normally was. Bobby sits in his chair, opening a gift from Mary that she bought before she ‘died.’
Dean tries to shoo Benny out the window of the second floor room. Benny shoots Dean an incredulous look.
Dean takes a few pictures of Sam as he opens up his presents. John had already opened his gift of a new knife and gun set from both Sam and Dean along with some whiskey from Bobby. Bobby is pouring everyone some eggnog while they sit in front of the fire.
Mary closes her eyes as she rubs her head gently. “But you hit me last night, that’s how I got hurt.”
Gill smiles at her, tears starting to form in his eyes. “Okay, sweetie. Let’s go get this water to your family.” He stands up and grabs the bag and pitcher.
Her heart is going to explode. She knows it is about four seconds away from exploding and she still has Sam in her arms. Is Sam going to die because her heart will explode? Mary Deanna Winchester turns to look at her house, smoke and flames coming out of the top floor windows where she remembered her mom sat singing to her not even five hours ago.
“I may be dead,” Benny whispers, shimmying into his shirt as he heads to the window. “But I still can break my neck!”
Bobby smiles. “At his twentieth birthday. He told me a little about you but I wanna know how you two met.”
“Charlie,” Sam grabs her hands. “Please? I’m pretty sure Dean’s filled up his emotional fragility for the next year after he told me he’s trans.”
“I mean, I guess.” Dean sighs and lays back in the messed up bed. “He didn’t call her a tranny so that’s a fucking plus. John basically said that we needed to be extinct if that helps.”
He cuts through the hair easily. He holds the braided piece in his hand. Almost a foot of hair just gone. Just like that. Dean starts to laugh.
“Alright, well, hurry up and heat up dinner.” John is looking through a few local newspapers trying to find anything about the supernatural. As he scans the paper from Sioux Falls, he finds an obituary about a guy who was burned to death. That sounds like what happened to Mary, John thinks. He digs around his duffle bag for a map and finds a route to the town. If they leave tomorrow morning, they would be able to reach the town by noon.
“No! Nothing like that, I swear.” Jeff’s looks at Dean. “It’s just more fuel efficient. I just filled up mine on the way and I’m sure you haven’t refilled from the drive down here yet. I was just trying to be helpful.”
Dean was sipping on a beer while he sat in a lawn chair at Bobby’s house. Sam was with John on a small time hunt. John has been taking Sam on more and more hunts, each time ending with an argument from Sam that usually went like this:
“Then explain it to him.” Benny moves a hand to make Dean look at him. “I don’t understand what’s holding you back.”
“Thank you, sir.” She says. “This is good. I’ll keep you and your brother updated on how the case goes.”
“Lucky for you, Dean-o, I have an extra demon blade.” Crowley hands Dean a long silver-looking blade. “But you didn’t get any of this from me.”
“Can you drop this off at Cassie’s and tell her I can’t make it? Please?” The words rush out and she holds her breath.
After about a half hour on the floor of the bathroom, she feels pressure on her hands. She quickly looks up out of her hands to see no one there. The pressure is still there, like someone is holding her hands but she doesn’t see anyone there with her.
Dean starts to cry. He never told him. Charlie said this would happen. Benny said this would happen. Fuck!
“We’ll talk in the car, Sam.” Charlie grabs Sam’s keys from the nightstand. “If he’s right, we don’t have long until they’re here.”
If you’re reading this, that means I’m not here to tell you what this is. I’m probably on a hunt with dad (lame!)
When she finishes talking, Mr. Willer asks if anyone has questions. A few hands shot up, but Kelly Trinnison is focused on the little girl with long blonde hair who’s staring at her. She can see hurt in her eyes and wants to know if she’s okay. She answers the kids questions and waits outside when she’s done. Jane’s other mom was picking her up today so when class was dismissed, Kelly told Jane that Sarah was in the parking lot waiting for her.
Dee doesn’t answer. She can’t answer. If she tells this lady that she might be gay- or worse that she feels like a boy more than a girl - her dad will figure it out. “I...I don’t-“
“Yeah, you say it.” Dean flips open the Hunter’s Journal. “But hearing Sam completely ignore her last wishes of being a woman hurts, you know?”
When John and Mary check into their hotel room, John starts acting weird. Mary notices that he keeps drinking from his flask and twitching his eyes around.
Dean scoffs. “Yeah, maybe if I wasn’t an exact copy of my mom it would have been fine. I look too much like her so if I change anything about my appearance without his permission I get a beating and a hell of a lot worse than if I sit there and look pretty for him.”
Dean looks around the room for a weapon but remembers that John took them all. She looks back at the man. “What do you want?”
Dean turns off the engine and sits for a moment in the driveway of the newly built Winchester home. After the fire, the remains of the house stayed there for about ten years before some west coast family bought it and remodeled it. It has a for sale sign in the yard and Dean hopes it stays that way for a while.
She storms off, fanning herself, and Dean and Cas go back to their previous activity. For their longing was no longer eating at them. For they were whole, in sync, and calm, and violent, and they were
He goes to the bathroom to wash up and empty the trash can and finds Bobby in there staring at him oddly.
Maybe it was her eyes, maybe it was her quick wit or her magnetic personality, whatever it was, Cas found himself drawn to her. They end up sitting across from one another at a picnic table, and the priest finds his eyes drawn to hers.
“Yeah, all right. You didn’t care anymore.” It was cold, and he didn’t mean it, not really, but how could his beautiful boyfriend think those men
“I assure you, my child, they did not train us for this in seminary.” He hopes he holds the shakiness he feels in his throat.
Dean licks his bottom lip slightly and wonders if anyone takes the local priest to shows like that now.
Cas instinctively knew how Dean laid out kitchens, and he finds what he needs easily. As he begins to form the crust, he thinks back to his first encounter with baking.
Lisa hands Eileen and Mary their martini glasses, each filled to the brim and each placed down with style and grace. Eileen makes sure to make an “impressed” face. Lisa smiles. Mary watches them bemusedly, she had been here all of five minutes and already felt at home.
Dean detects a slight inflection in Benny’s tone but he can’t place it. For some reason, he knows he doesn’t like it. Shame floods him then, and it must show on his face.
“No!” Lisa throws a dish towel at him. “No, you know what? I thought he died. I thought the love of your life died on duty. I thought that’s why you were a mess. And you never told me otherwise.”
Mary can’t help but smile, he knew so much and yet so little. “You knew from my second victim, after the first coincidence, that I was killing for a higher purpose, and you said nothing, not to mention the other factors at play.” She decided to leave the other factor a mystery, for now.
“You see, Mr. Whitmire, I was Marcy, so many years ago. No one came to my aid, no one defended me. And I stopped, for a while. Because of Joe, I think. And I was content to stop, of course there would always be work for me to do, but I wanted to help the ‘legal’ way. But then I saw that article, and I knew... I knew, this was my destiny, insofar as my destiny is tied with his.”
Joe smiles and nods in agreement before he begins to peel an orange, the aromatic spray filling the senses of Mary, throwing her into a repressed - but never truly forgotten - memory.
neighborhood, to be completely surrounded by all things him. She looks to Joe, feels only the slightest pang of guilt, then looks back to Susan Struthers.
Mary was not a small woman by any means and had many a practice dragging burly men around their homes, but it was never what one might call easy. She rolls her head back and forth, cracking her neck, waiting for the man to wake up, tied to the chair he was currently residing in.
“You’re so fucking whipped you can’t see what’s right in front of ya face. Look, brother, I don’t want the man to be it either, I really don’t, but it is him, and we know it for sure now.”
“Well, the boys called me up, said they got a job for me. Said it was about Bloody Mary. You know I couldn’t pass that up.” Benny smiles with the left side of his mouth. It’s a grin and Dean huffs out a laugh at it.
He tries to shake from his head thoughts of two boys in a dingy motel room, surviving off of hot fries stolen from a vending machine while their dad is gone, on a dead trail of the serial killer that killed their mom. He tries to not think about the lack of holidays, birthdays, and shitty gifts he gave Sammy that he stole from a gas station, a dinner of beef jerky and stale Little Debbies.
I didn’t initially. Those were coincidences. But then I looked into you, and realized that everything was just too good to be true, so the rest were not, no.”
It all began to click then, all of it. His dad’s obsession with that killer - The Atoner. That psycho that killed his mom. That bastard that prayed over his victims before he killed them. He feels the anger in his very fingertips.
It was always kinda different with him and Cas though, what with the other man’s gentle manner and his rough one. They worked perfectly together in every way imaginable and the second Dean touched him when they were alone Dean wanted to meet all his needs. Sometimes, Dean Winchester hated himself.
Cas braces himself against the back of a bench that was donated by the Smith’s. His mind is inundated with memories, and he closes his eyes against them.
Mary knew she was not allowing much time between these slayings, but she had a plan, and it was an exceptionally good one.
“Oh, sorry honey,” Mary straightens and her voice softens,  “I just read something that upset me. Are you almost ready to go?”
“I suppose I am not what most would call ‘sane’, but no, I am not draining your blood because I am crazy. Would you care to try again?”
Without hesitation, she injects him in the stomach with a syringe she had hidden in a handy contraception of her own invention underneath her sleeve. It was attached to her wrist and easily accessible. Mary spent an afternoon making it from leather she bought at a craft store and thread she found courtesy of her cat. She often thought of obtaining a patent for it, but the pesky law would get in the way.
“It’s not Dad’s car,” Dean says, taking Charlie’s hand. “It’s a fake Crowley set up for me. I have the real one with me.”
Hannah leaned back on the sofa. “Well, the coroner found a small bag in her purse after it happened. it was filled with small bones and flowers. But Samantha was known to have small bags with flowers in it. She collected them.”
Dee stops breathing. Maybe that’s what has been wrong this whole time. Maybe if she became a boy, her dad would listen to her and appreciate her.
“Sam! Charlie!” Dean makes his way around the other side of the bed to check them both for injuries. “The hell are you guys doing here?”
John’s arms cross as he shifts his feet. “She won’t figure it out. She’s a good kid, but not that smart.”
“He always is,” Dean closes his eyes. “He’ll bounce back. It will take a while. Losing the love of your life is a Winchester rite of passage at this point. I just wish I could’ve gotten to know her more, you know?”
Principal McDonald sighs and leans back in his chair. There’s a few minutes where neither of them talk.
“No, that’s not…” Kelly sighs. “I’m not hiding anything from Jane. I was hiding something from the class. Not a lot of people know this but...Dear, what do you think of people who are gay?”
“I think she is.” Sam opens the door for them. “I’m sure she would have liked you and approved of you becoming my future wife, Jess.”
Dean smirks. “Well, as the Winchester who wrote the famous Winchester Hunter Journal, I feel like I should keep the name.”
“No, you’re fine, ma’am.” Dee looks up at her. “I was just wondering what you were hiding. But you don’t have to say it if you don’t want to.” She quickly adds on.
Kevin actually falls down when she asks it, making the contents of the bag he was holding spill all over the sidewalk. Freddie freezes in place.
“Hmm.” Benny opens the paper and hands it to Dean. “He’s known as the Old Man. He turned back in the 50’s. I tried saving my girl at the time, Andrea, but he killed her. The town blamed it on me so I had to book it out of there. I’ve been in Scotland until a few weeks ago. The Old Man took over Andrea’s property so that’s where I was heading before you decided to gank me.”
Outside the building, Charlie is on the phone with the fire department.  “And please, hurry. I think there’s someone still in the building.”
John seems to snap out of it. He stops crying immediately and pushes Mary into the bed more. “Why can’t you be her?”
Dean shakes his head. “Everything John said he knew was actually because I told him. I wanted to be a hunter back when I was six years old. I researched everything I could and even built that Walkman EMF detector he said he built.”
Dee’s is the only kid in her class whose parents aren't here. Her dad could not get the day off work, or so she told her teacher. In reality, John has been gone almost two weeks working a few cases with some brother duo named Saul and Dan. While he’s gone, Dee has been taking care of Sam with the money John left for them. It’s just about out now. She’s resorted to taking the school lunch home to feed Sammy and eating whatever he doesn’t finish.
“I met him in Ontario after I was kicked out of my parents house for being gay. Turns out, being trans was the least of his problems. He faked his death and ran away from home because of shit out of his control.”
The bracelet shines in the sun that betrays the feeling of gloom in the graveyard. Bobby turns it and reads the engraving inside the bracelet .
“Boy,” slipped out of her mouth. She threw a hand over her mouth which made a loud slapping sound she hoped Bobby didn’t hear. There was a pause on the line.
John moves to the back of the Impala and starts loading the car. Bobby is shocked. Did John not have any faith in his little girl’s abilities? Bobby storms back into his house to find Mary in the kitchen packing up a few sandwiches.
Dean lays Sam on the floor as the building residents finish coming out of the building. “You okay? You’re not hurt, right?”
Dean zips it up and sets it by the door. As she is leaving the room, she can hear Sam sniffling and finds him sitting on the bottom of the stairs.
Bobby shoots a look at Dean. “Yup. I’ll show them around the Yard while you finish up your work. John should be back soon.”
“I should’ve been better. That’s why dad hit me. I was never good enough, I should have stayed to learn my lesson.”
Crowley turns and heads to a small red car at the end of the lot. Dean opens the driver door and gets in. He starts the engine and drives, not looking back to see the fire engines arrive.
Sam doesn’t know how to react. Bobby is devastated at the funeral. John stares at the ground where they bury an empty coffin like it pissed in his coffee.
“It’s not because you’re a girl!” Sam stands up and puts his hands on her shoulders. “It’s just...you get so banged up after every hunt you go in with him. it’s like he uses you as bait or something.”
She washes her mouth out in the sink, looking at the blood covering her face and the black eye she has. If she’s going to hunt, she needs to come up with a mantra to help her keep going after she gets hurt. She wipes blood from her nose and stares into her own eyes in the mirror.
The hellhound turns to look at Dean. Sam is confused while Charlie nods at Dean, taking Sam’s arm. “What does that mean?”
“Mary? Are you sure you want to go on this hunt? It’s okay to wait another year until you’re ready, you know.”
This was Dean’s first Christmas by himself. After his last meet-up with Crowley to hand over a letter for Sam, Dean drove up to Canada. He crossed into Ontario with nothing to his name besides the Impala and a few hundred dollars in the glovebox, not including the black card Crowley gave him. He vows to never use it unless absolutely necessary because demons can’t be trusted, even if this one has a huge crush on Dean.
“I notice you kept staring at me earlier. Was there anything that I did to bother you? I’m sorry if there was.”
“Sorry, Uncle Bobby. I was, uh, just looking out the window and saw a boy from school.” There was no way Bobby would buy that excuse. “I’m just, uh, going through, um...puberty? The hormones are going, uh, crazy right now. Sorry, Uncle Bobby, I have to go. Tell my dad that the monster you’re hunting is a wraith and can be killed with silver. Okay! Bye!”
“Well, let’s keep it that way. And I’ll do this pro Bono, darling. I’ve taken a liking to you, Winchester. You’re so full of rage it’s Devine.” Crowley stands up and looks around the room. “What do you say we fake your death by my hands and I pop you somewhere far away from here for a bit while I clean up loose ends?”
Dean folds the paper and then writes Cassie’s address on the front. “Here, Bobby. Oh, can you also deposit this? It’s my last paycheck.” She hands Bobby the check he gave her. “I wrote down the numbers next to the address. Thanks again.”
John drops Mary off at the store to buy groceries. She grabs a basket and looks at the list John made. She starts towards the bread section when she sees a couple of men talking to each other near the bread she needs. As she nears them, she can hear their conversation.
Dean stands up and tackles Bobby in a hug. Bobby drops his beer to catch her- him. To catch him in his arms before Dean breaks down in tears. “Bobby, you know you’re more of a father to me than John ever was. Fuck outta here with the friends crap.”
Crowley tuts. “Mind reading is a higher demon's power. You know, I’m sure your dad wouldn’t mind if you told him you’re trans.”
Dean laughs. “Of course she knows. I know I told you we’ve been friends since I was seventeen, but we started dating when I was eighteen. Cassie knows everything, Uncle Bobby. I think she might be the one for me.”
He turns around to find a red-head standing in a Star Wars sweater. “Thanks. Did you want to take a look?”
Dean scoffs. “Is that supposed to scare me? So a dad beats his son a little, no harm no foul. Dad rapes me once and there’s no one. No one to intercede: no angels, no demons, no nothing. Second time I expect something to change. For someone to see how wrong it is. I tried fighting it one year and he threatened to beat my brother. I don’t have a fucking choice.”
I’m writing it as you read this so you know it will be a ride. I should have it done either tomorrow or the next day. After ch 6 I’ll bring in Cas. Maybe more than 10 chapters what was I thinking? let’s pretend I said 15 and that I’ll finish before January ends? I have a lot ideas I wrote down and then decided to lengthen almost all of them. everything written was supposed to be like one or two chapters lmao
Dean swallows. She hasn’t gotten gifts for Christmas since she was six but she’s not going to tell that to Sam. She tries her best to make sure Sam always has the best gifts and if that she doesn’t get any, then so be it. Besides, she’s going to Cassie’s house tonight so she’ll be able to get something then.
John seems to be in a trance for a few seconds before shaking his head. “I’m all good, Mare. Are you packed up? We’re heading out in a few.”
“We’re going on a hunt. A small one.” John’s voice demanded no response so Sam just nodded. He didn’t want to think about how Mary died on a hunt that John said was going to be a small one.
Bobby nods. “Of course, Cassie. Here, hop in. John and Sam are going to go on a hunt. Apparently it’s a small one but I don’t expect them to be back until Saturday or Sunday.”
Crowley is a low level demon and kills his competitors to become King of Hell, change my mind. (I don’t remember anything about any season before 14, 15x20 destroyed those memories for me)
Dean spots Benny’s prone body in the entrance of the bedroom. The two hellhounds stand a few feet away from him on the other side of the room. Dean bends down to see a piece of Benny’s neck missing. Benny opens his eyes.
“Class, let’s pay attention to what Miss Trinnison has to say.” Mr. Willer says, tapping on the chalkboard. Dee looks up. Miss Trinnison has a square jaw and seems to be hiding something. As she talks, Dee tries to figure out what she could be hiding. An affair? No, because she wasn’t married. She must have divorced her husband because of something. Is she hiding abuse like Dee does? She looks for bruises while Miss Trinnison goes on about being a counselor or something for a school. Boring.
“Honestly? I don’t blame you.” Charlie flips pages in her notebook. “I can probably come down tomorrow to help with the case. You can take the rest of the week with Benny and I can tell Sam you’re on a bender.”
“Yeah, Sam,” Dean glares at Sam. “It does matter. She tried her whole life to be who she knew she was and within a couple seconds, you erase everything she built for herself.” Dean pulls into a parking space and gets out. “I’m leaving. I can’t deal with this if you’re going to be like that.”
Sam’s mouth opens but no words come out. Cassie laughs and shares a look with Bobby. “Bobby gave it to me when it came a week ago. We wanted it to be a surprise.”
also please comment what I should tell Kate when I send her the link to this. It should be like idk 10 chapters or so and I am starting chapter four right now
John nods and opens the door. “I guess it did. Now, if you lie to me again, I’ll have to punish you and I don’t want to do that, okay?”
Kelly smiles softly. “You don’t have to know right now. But I’ll let you in on a secret: Gay people aren’t sick. They can’t help the way they feel. And if your daddy says something about the bible saying it’s wrong, God never said that. In fact, God said that a man shouldn’t have any sexual relations with children. The translation is off from the original hebrew. As for men who “dress” as women, those people are called transgenders. And, well, just like people can be gay, there are people out there who are transgender. I used to be a man.”
“That’s good.” Bobby looks up at the ceiling. “Cassie left. Said she couldn’t handle living somewhere with sad memories.”
“But I don’t like Frank, mom.” Jane said, shifting the bag on her shoulder. “Can’t I go home with you?”
Dean shrugs. “When I was probably eight. It was pretty easy, I was reading up on how to fix cars and appliances at the time and tried my hand at building it. Anyone could do that.”
John laughs. “It’s not going to be a real hunt. I’m going to have her research stuff and when she’s asleep, I’ll pretend to hunt it down.”
He pulls through a McDonald’s and orders a few hamburgers and a coffee while in Albany. He has to find a job and then hopefully a cheap place to crash.
“When I come back tomorrow,” John says as he collects his things, “I expect you to be ready to leave. We’re moving to a new town when we pick up Sam. Now clean all of this up and be ready to go tomorrow at 8.”
There’s shuffling on the other side of the door before it opens. Dean stands there in his rumpled suit with snot covering his face. “He won’t accept who I am, Ben.”
“Great! I’ll get everything ready and make sure you’re all set for Thursday.” He stands up from his chair, signaling to Dee to stand as well. They shake hands as he continues, “Don’t worry, Dee, I understand you have to do what your family needs.”
Charlie is silent. Sam never brings up Jessica anymore and she doesn’t want to spook him off his emotional dump right now.
“Is that a hunter thing?” Cassie asks. “Dean explained some of it when he got rid of my, uh, ghost problem a few months ago.”
“I’m here, kid.” Dean says, handing Sam a water bottle. “Let’s get back to Charlie now, eh? Think she has the Lord of the Rings rented from Blockbuster. We’ll watch that tonight, okay?”
“I’m glad your Uncle is coming to visit us for Christmas, Sam.” Jess says as they walk back to their apartment. “It’s a big occasion, I know my parents are coming.”
“Will do. Take care.” Bobby hangs up and looks at Sam. “Dean is coming to visit us sometime in May.”
I couldn’t get this chapter how I wanted. This is literally rewrite number 8 but Cas is up next chapter.
“If he sticks around that long,” Charlie opens her door. “You’re going to have to tell him the truth.”
John comes back covered in blood. Rufus steps in after him, equally covered, and makes his way to Bobby as John goes to shower off the blood. “He’ll make a good hunter, Bobby. He has the heart and killed the bastard, but he seems to learn fast.”
