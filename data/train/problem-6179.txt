In the months after the attack on Manhattan, Steve finds himself unwilling to leave the city. New York is home, even if it's not the one he knows. It's full of glitz now, lights and noise and the so-called beautiful people of this day and age. He feels they might be bit of a letdown after Clark Gable and Myrna Loy, but he likes seeing the unabashed smiles on the girls on the billboards (even if he wishes they'd wear more clothes). He sees a group of girls playing soccer in the muddy turf of Central Park and doesn't hear anyone scolding them for not being ladylike; he likes that, too. He sees guys who were as skinny as he used to be, wearing clothes that don't sag on their bony frames and attracting the attention of cute girls the way he never could.
"Look, just because you personally do not feel cold because your nerves are desensitized, it doesn't mean the structural integrity of your body is immune to the laws of thermodynamics.
"Well enough."  Steve's tone suggests there's more to it than that, but he's not one to go on about that kind of thing.   "So.  It's later.  Do you feel like talking?"
He landed in an empty lot behind a condemned tenement and waited for Steve to catch up, trying to sort out the words before they met. He didn't quite make it; Steve had broken into a somewhat awkward run, one hand pressed against his wound.
The next twelve hours were a blur of screaming winds and shivering and quiet prayer between bouts of delirious catnapping and checking each other for a pulse.  If he gave it a bit of thought, Tony could remember being very comforted by the sound of thunder booming in the cavern, and the glorious warmth of something soft and red being bundled around him.
Tony actually had to think about it, and decided he didn't actually do a lot of climbing. Most of his upward movement happened with elevators, stairs, and the suit.  "Untested."
With that done, Steve, standing in the shadows of an alley full of men he'd knocked out, took out his cell phone. The light rolled over the legs of Steve's jeans, and although it probably wasn't bothering him all that much, there was a distinct pool of blood spreading on the outside of his left thigh; a small gunshot, probably from a .22.
"...Good Lord."  Steve had never seen it before. He'd always imagined the little glowing circle showing through Tony's clothes as a disc, just a circle of metal and glass and lights. It went much deeper than he'd thought, practically a
Later, he'd regret passing out; Thor had never flown with him before, much less when he was curled up around the Arc Reactor hanging out of his chest like it was a grenade.  He remembered Thor's voice gently reassuring him, urging him to stay awake, and the first breath of unfiltered air and ozone filling his lungs did him more good than anything medical science could provide.
Steve propped himself up just enough to reach the motorcycle jacket and put it back over them like a blanket, and he pulled the other man close against his chest. The sad reality of it didn't match the rare daydream he allowed himself; he only had a vague idea of what men in love
"Take your knife--"  Tony pressed it into Steve's hand, carefully and with great care not to shiver so much that he risked cutting him; he wasn't sure it
"No, it won't.  But if you lie down, you'll sleep, and if you sleep, you'll end up in another coma.  You're already primed for cryostasis, Cap, if you pass out now it might be another seventy years before you wake up."   Tony watched Steve's pupils; they were reacting sluggishly to the light of the Arc Reactor, and that scared him. If it was just a concussion, he should have shrugged that off by now.   "Okay, Boy Scout.  You got a pocketknife on you?"
Eventually, when Tony's fully healed and they have time alone, they'll laugh and pick on each other, they'll talk about Bucky and Obadiah in quiet voices over stiff drinks. They'll keep it cool and professional in battle and then refuse to be apart that following night, even if they have to obfuscate it with arguments and sparring matches.  And eventually, when all of that stops being worth the trouble, they'll retire to Tony's bedroom and take it slow, because Steve won't let them do it any way but the right way.
Tony pinched the bridge of his nose and tried again, doing his best to follow after him as he started to divest himself.
He looped the cords around his blistered fingers, and for the first time all night he found himself with a stroke of luck when they were just long enough to put the reactor itself back into his palm.   He couldn't fit his fingers into the knuckle-duster on the trench knife,  so he just wrapped his hand around the entire grip and crushed it until he was sure whatever shock came out of the thing wasn't going to knock it away from him.
The men in line to get in whisper to each other as he walks by, eyes straying to his shoulders and his legs; a few swoon like girls when he kneels down to tie his shoe. When he realizes they're flirting, Steve blushes and picks up his pace, shrinking a little into the collar of his coat. Tony laughs, because Steve is beautiful in a way that would be stupid on anyone else, and he has nothing but sympathy for the crowd as Steve cuts through an alley; hate to see him go, love to watch him leave. And maybe, in Tony's petty, mean little way, seeing a little bit of homophobia on him brings him a little back down to Earth.
cut him, but things were risky enough already.  "--and hold it on the kindling, and just tap the metal bits against the very end of the blade. It'll spark, and it'll want to jump out of your hands, but you have to
of blood and clear, watery fluid erupted from the bubbled skin like fat from a split sausage, and it was messy and it was disgusting but at least his hand was smaller, and all he had to do was just reach in there and fish around for the socket and just put the plug back in and it would be fine, but his fingertips were so numb
Steve didn't waste time, just hooked an arm around Iron Man's back and did his best to hold himself steady for the takeoff; not really any different from hanging onto a helicopter, just smaller and more personable. Sort of. If he hadn't been so close, Tony might not have heard the soft grunt of pain as the pressure of an armored hand gripped his waist, or the sigh of relief as it took the weight off of his injured leg, or the very small smile on his lips as they slowly raised off of the ground.
really, but he understood gentle touches and closeness, and it seemed strangely natural, the way life tended to treat him, that he was able to hold Tony Stark only after he was still and cold.
, because it's going to heat the shit out of the knife and-- hopefully-- start the fire.  Once the fire's lit, make sure it is going to
"No. But this... look. Look at me."  Tony put his good hand on Steve's shoulder and met his eyes. They were glassy and sluggish; his lips were blue, his face was wind burnt, and he was not fit to be doing anything delicate with those frostbitten hands.  Unfortunately, there were not a lot of options to begin with, and most of them had gone out the window hours ago.   "We're freezing to death."
"All right."  He's the leader; that makes a certain amount of sense.  "I... Firstly, I think I owe you an apology."
For a second, Tony almost snapped at him, but then he remembered the cover-up.   The personal bits about how Iron Man went public never made it into his personal dossier in the S.H.I.E.L.D. database. He knew; he'd gone looking for it.   "...My dad had-- my dad had this friend, Obie-- Obadiah Stane.  He was more of a father to me than my old man was."  Tony began to shake just a little harder, and Steve wasn't sure if it was the cold, or something else.  "...We don't have time to go into it now, but Obadiah Stane. If this... if this part goes bad for me, that's the name you want to ask Fury about."
"You should take your jacket back."   Tony held it out.  His jaw was clenched to keep his teeth from chattering, eyes lowered to survey the steep, craggy drop below them.   The wind was howling down there, and cast a brisk updraft into his face.
"And secondly, about... things we need to say, just in case. I... ah.  Well.  I'm not so good at this part, and I've never felt.. about a man, before, so I'm not sure how...or even if... and it's
and that's, you know... but you said you understood, so..."  Steve's ears flush a bright, cherry red, and he looks down at his hands.
"Good.  Still. That's... I'm being serious here, that's ... that's a very cool thing to say, Steve. Thanks."
That was how the latest prototype exploded just a tad, tore a teeny tiny hole in space-time, and an un-armored Tony was blown into a four-foot-tall snowbank with a very unhappy Steve still dive-clinging to his back.
"We caught a real lucky break with that one. But that's not what I'm getting at."  Steve swallows. "You really laid on the barbed wire for me.  More than that, really, you handed me the wire cutters and lay down and just had to hope I wouldn't leave you there.  I've never had to be the guy that crawled over his friend before, Tony."
To his credit, he lingered awhile as he fought the void and the warmth that threatened to overtake  him, but in Steve's last moments of consciousness, he breathed one last weary, watery sigh of relief. He couldn't hear it over the wind and the fire and the hum of the magnet, but he could feel it against his chest: Tony had started breathing, and that meant it was okay to sleep.
Tony swallows a little.  "I figured you'd think of something. And you did, right? Or I wouldn't be here."
"I know, and that's exactly why should take it. Your lips are turning blue and your body isn't trying to keep itself warm."
Maybe he stayed quiet too long; Steve stood up, grabbed his blood-stained jeans, and headed for the door. “I...should go, shouldn't I? Thanks for patching me up, Stark, and for the ride. Have a good night.”
When Tony’s gaze dropped to his hands, which were fidgeting in front of him, a lead weight slammed into Steve’s gut, nearly tearing a hole through him. This new revelation was something he didn’t even know how to quantify. He’d spent so much of his life, so much energy being hurt and angry, believing it was deserved, and it had all been a misunderstanding. Sure, there were still questions, but if Tony was telling the truth … He shook his head.
Steve slipped into the hall with one last glance around the gym to make sure Tony wasn’t close. Once out there, he pressed his back against the cool wall and covered his mouth with his hands. It shouldn’t hurt this much still. It wasn’t fair. He hated that Tony was out there mingling like nothing was bothering him like his presence wasn’t cutting into Steve.
Her friend, Lizzie, who he remembered from the time she’d tripped him during lunch, batted her lashes as she eyed him. “Wow, look at those muscles.”
Resigning himself to his fate, he faced the room and looked out over the crowd. Most of the people looked nothing like Steve had imagined. He’d thought they’d all look beautiful and skinny and accomplished, but most of them were overweight or balding. In fact, he didn’t see anyone in the same shape as him.
As it was now, the only thing keeping him from lashing out at Tony was the severe expression the man was wearing. Something like grief touched the corners of his eyes, but there was also anger etched in the line of his mouth. If he didn’t know better, he’d almost think Tony was on the verge of tears.
“Well, if it isn’t Bailey and Bunny!” Tony said, reading the nametags of the twin sisters. They’d been vaguely insufferable throughout high school but not actively malicious. “Great to see you two! You ladies still local?” Tony asked as the Sharpie squeaked on his nametag.
When they got to the lot outside, Tony pulled his glasses off as he laughed, still holding Steve’s hand. “I wonder if someone got pictures? It won’t be my biggest scandal, but I’m betting a few gossip rags pick the story up.”
Steve stared at him like a deer caught in headlights. The need to say something—anything—to fill the silence pricked at Tony until he blurted out the first thing that came to mind. “I guess someone’s been eating their Wheaties.”
“I really hope not. Maybe you can visit my gallery sometime.” Steve sounded unhappy too and hadn’t let go of his hand since leaving the restaurant, which was just fine with Tony.
He glanced around the gym, looking for Steve. Not that he had any idea what he’d say to the guy if he did, but it’d be a reason to stay. The more he thought about it, though, the tighter the feeling in his chest got, and he forced himself to exhale. It was fine. Everything was fine.
He sipped his soda and decided he might need to phone a friend to talk him out of telling all these people what he really thought of them.
Glancing over, Tony caught Steve looking at him, a slight furrow of thought etched on his forehead. “Would you…?” A range of thoughts and emotions danced across Steve’s face in a jumble. “I’m thinking… Nah, it’s a stupid idea.”
“I mean, you’re okay like this too….” Tony swallowed and tried to remember to breathe as he waved his hand. “That’s not important. I hoped you’d be here but told myself you wouldn’t come. Rhodey—my best friend—tried to talk me out of coming, but you see how effective that was.” Tony watched a point just above Steve’s shoulder and closed his mouth. The anger simmering behind Steve’s blue eyes somehow hurt just the same now as it had back in high school. He tried to make himself ask the question, why? After all, that’s what he wanted to know.
I’m sorry about. I never meant for that to happen.” He stepped away, leaning back against the lockers, arm still crossed over his chest. Tony covered his face with his free hand because now the tears were coming whether he wanted them to or not.
By the time he and Jarvis carried his mother to bed, even the prom after-parties had been over. Tony had felt so numb from the whole ordeal that he hadn’t been able to sleep. He’d wanted to call Steve right away when he’d gotten home but figured Steve’s mom wouldn’t be too happy to be woken up in the pre-dawn hours on her day off.
“I know, I know. You said so when we sat down… and I’ve already kept you this late….” A bubble of despair swelled in his chest. “But it doesn’t have to be goodbye, right?”
“Not to be a dick, but what the fuck was that?” Tony asked. “You looked like you were expelling a demon. Do you need me to call the Ghostbusters?” he tried to joke, but it fell like stone against the tile floor.
Tony dragged a hand over his goatee as he shook his head. “Howard was a barely functional alcoholic for as long as I remember, and my mom was codependent and covered for him. I couldn’t bring
Letting out a frustrated breath, he tossed a hand into the air. “Sorry, I didn’t mean anything by it.” Then he bit his lip, trying to decide if he should voice what was on his mind.
Tony had asked Steve out to the senior prom, and he had happily agreed. Money being tight, he’d been worried where he’d get a suit, but his mother came through. They’d found one in a thrift store, and she’d fitted it to him, sprucing it up nicely. Then, she’d kissed him and told him he looked dashing, telling him Tony was lucky to have someone like him.
It had been one of those nights that they’d been talking about first loves, and Steve had told them about the naïve boy who put his trust in the wrong person. Telling that story had left Steve in tears. It was funny how the pain of that night was never far from the surface, even after all these years.
“This is so stupid. Steve would never come to something like this to see all the people he hated so much,” Tony muttered to himself. He also wished his heart would stop pounding in his chest only to contrast with the plunging feeling in his stomach like he’d swallowed a stone.
Brock caught Steve’s eye, giving him an incredulous look, but Steve just waved him off. A few people tried to stop Tony, some as blatant as stepping in front of him, but Tony simply brushed them away like he was parting a sea with his hands.
“We moved production, and a lot of the programming that goes into our products goes on out there, but we still have our headquarters here. I fly out fairly regularly, but I’m in the city most of the time. Does this mean we could have lunch dates?” Tony asked hopefully.
They’d hit it off, and Steve found Tony funny and kind, nothing like he’d imagined. It was a little like a fairytale.
“Is Monday too soon for lunch? I mean, we probably shouldn’t rush into anything here, right?” Tony said, trying to channel the distant voice of his inner-Rhodey that struggled to reign in Tony’s impulsivity.
But then one day, Steve had been in the locker room, towel held around his bony hips when he overheard some jocks talking about how Tony had been playing Steve and how funny it was to watch Steve fall for it.
Brock’s eyebrows lifted when he saw the nametag. “It really is you! How are you, man? You look great!”
Tony wasn’t sure who Steve was trying to convince because he was already on board with this idea. “Yeah. Exactly.”
Hearing Tony’s explanation, going through the motions, left Steve feeling wrung out, tired in a way he hadn’t felt in years. Where did they go from here?
He didn’t get more time to think about what could happen because suddenly Tony’s head was turning, and his eyes were locking on Steve’s. There was a flash of something in Tony’s expression that looked an awful lot like a grimace, but he recovered quickly, slipping a mask in place that Steve knew all too well. He didn’t smile, though.
Steve felt dizzy but in a good way, like getting off a rollercoaster, which he supposed wasn’t far from the truth. Since getting out of the car and walking into the gym, he’d been through a range of emotions, finally settling on something warm and hopeful. There was still a tenderness around his heart, but it felt more like a healing bruise than the bleeding wound it was.
He didn’t know what to do or say, but Tony was waiting, standing in silence and expecting something. It was a miracle he’d let Steve have this breakdown in silence. If anyone deserved to rage about something, it was him.
“...I can’t believe how much that Rogers kid changed! I don’t see him now—and I don’t see Kaitlyn Pierce anymore…” The gaggle of people snickered at that. Well, if Steve looked good these days and was working his way through the cheerleaders who’d spurned him back in high school, more power to him. It didn’t matter that Tony felt sick at the thought.
His hands shook as he retrieved the wireless headphones from his jacket pocket. Thank god Rhodey had reminded him about those. He fumbled getting them into his ears, but the too-loud tolling of church bells followed by electric guitars quickly drowned out the building panicked feeling and let his head fall back against the wall.
But by then, Jarvis was worried that Howard’s breathing might be too shallow. So, of course, they’d had to take him to a private hospital. Because they were the Starks, they couldn’t just call a goddamned ambulance like everyone else.
Tony’s back straightened despite the protests of his body, and he stepped toward Steve. “You take that back, Rogers. For a long time, Rhodey was the first and only real friend I had. If you’ve got a problem with me, then say so, but leave him out of it.”
Tony hadn’t cared who said what about them. He had wanted the whole world to know how much he liked Steve, holding hands and stealing kisses whenever he could. If Steve’s blush had been
His breath hitched when his eyes fell on Tony’s face, earbuds hanging from his ears, and the floor beneath him felt like it had fallen through.
Tony couldn’t help tensing up, but he hoped he hadn’t actually flinched. This was seriously the worst fucking idea he’d ever had in his whole life. Still keeping her hands on his arms, she stepped back, “You look so good!”
As he headed toward a table in the corner, he heard the gym door creak open, and he looked toward it, only for his heart to freeze mid-beat.
His new companion didn’t say anything to him, so Steve just assumed they wanted to be left alone, so he closed his eyes and rested his head back against the wall. This trip down memory lane was turning into a shit show, and he wanted nothing more than to be back home with Peggy and Bucky, sipping a beer and forgetting his problems.
It was almost weird how quickly they fell into conversation. In thinking about meeting Steve at the reunion, Tony had wondered if the conversation would just fizzle out, but the reality had been anything but. His face ached from smiling so much, and Tony felt like he had so much left to say.
A thick lump of emotion had formed in Tony’s throat, and he felt dangerously close to bursting into tears. Well, he hadn’t the day Steve dumped him, and he wouldn’t give him the satisfaction of it now either.
Turning, he saw the hand was connected to none other than Brock Rumlow—a jock who used to shove him into the lockers any chance he got, calling him things he’d rather forget. Unlike most of the people here, he looked like an older version of himself. Why couldn’t he have been one of the people to get uglier over the years?
Tony’s head turned, and Steve’s heart froze, skidding to a stop in his chest. He worried that Tony had recognized him, but then he looked away without his expression changing. Steve thanked his growth spurt and time in the gym for that. If Tony were looking for him, he’d be expecting a tiny, skinny blond, not the tall, muscular man Steve had turned into.
A few people were looking at him, but no one seemed to recognize him. It was too bad he had to put the name tag on and ruin that.
Kevin slung an arm around Tony’s shoulders, and Lizzie stepped up to his other side as Stephanie Foster snapped a photo. Then Stephanie came in close. “Say, Tony, did you see Steve Rogers yet? Remember when you dated him? That was such a scream,” she cackled.
Still feeling the tickle of relief at not being spotted, he decided not to push lady luck. So he ducked around a few people, heading for the side of the gym, where a table and radio was set up, the music bringing Steve back to days he’d forgotten when life felt like it hung in the balance and anything could tip it.
Even so, it was so weird that Steve was taller now. But it was okay because Steve was leaning in. Tony closed his eyes and kissed… just under Steve’s nose. “Embarrassing…” he mumbled.
. Jarvis, the guy who managed the house… well, he managed everything he could, really. He and I spent prom night cleaning up Howard and checking him into a private rehab center to dry out. I couldn’t sleep…
Tony gave him an admonishing look. “First, you weren’t being selfish. Second, your self-esteem and mine should start a support group.” Then sighing, he added, “So just so you know, not inviting you home to meet my parents wasn’t a weird rich person thing. My parents—they weren’t nice people.”
This whole thing could have been avoided if he’d listened to his friends. Bucky and Peggy had told him not to come, insisting he didn’t owe anyone a thing. He really should have listened. Because unlike the people in the gym, his friends cared about him and didn’t want to see him hurt. He imagined that most people here would throw another under the bus to save themselves if given a chance.
“Right, right… absolutely,” Steve replied, nodding. “Monday works for me, though… and we’re just… still catching up. To see if the spark is still there.”
As he got out of the car, Tony remembered his conversation with Pepper. “Going to see the one who got away?” she’d teased.
Steve gave Tony an exasperated look, shaking his head. “Nothing like that—okay, maybe—I don’t know.” He sighed. “You never make things easy, you know that?”
Steve hadn’t realized he’d fallen behind until Tony stopped to turn, reaching back with a hand and wiggling his fingers. Steve hurried forward, briefly hesitating before linking their hands together, so Tony could pull him along.
The gym door was heavy when he pulled it open, the hinges protesting with a whine. The air inside was cool and smelled just like he remembered it, like a mix of sweat and corn chips. Not very appealing.
Since his growth spurt, Steve had taken pride in his appearance. He worked out every other day and ran every morning.
Tony glanced at Steve again as they left the diner. Cheeseburgers, fries, and shakes had turned into so many cups of decaf that the waitress had brought them their own carafe. And pie: peach for Steve and Tony had ordered key lime, which was still his favorite.
As he sat there, he knew he was on borrowed time before Tony looked at him, and he wasn’t sure what to do or say when it happened. His breaths started coming in short pants. There weren’t words for the mess of conflicted emotions in Steve’s chest. Part of him wanted to rage at Tony and demand why—why had he been so cruel? But he wasn’t sure he could handle the answer, so the words died in his throat.
and hoping for things never made them so. He half-laughed without any humor, and his shoulders sagged. “You know what? It’s fine. I don’t know why I cared so long.”
The air inside the car was stifling, his AC having shit the bed at the start of July. The sun was setting, though, so there would be a reprieve from the heat soon, and if he could just man up and go inside the school gym, he’d be a lot cooler, too.
For a second, anger flared up again inside him, and Tony glared at Steve. “You’ve got to be fucking kidding me. You believed the kind of shit that people like
Steve had judged the people in the gym, calling them shallow and self-centered in his head, when in truth, Steve was no better than them.
Steve watched as Tony paused just inside the gym, his feet shoulder-width apart, and even with his sunglasses on, Steve could see that the man was looking over the crowd. He couldn’t help but notice that he still carried himself the same way, his shoulders back and head held high, wearing a hint of a forced smile that twitched against his lips. There was a time when Steve thought he knew Tony’s smiles, but after what happened, he wondered if he really ever knew him at all.
Steve leaned back. “What? Your friend tried to talk you out of coming? Some friend,” Steve muttered, shaking his head.
Brock clapped him on the arm. “Hell, yeah. Little Stevie Rogers. Todd was telling me he saw on Facebook that you’d put on some muscle, but wow. You look great.”
Steve had arrived a little early, carrying with him a boutonniere for Tony. It was a red rose, fitting how classy Tony was.
Tony couldn’t stand it anymore and pulled away from the group. “No, I didn’t. Too bad I missed him.” He needed to get out of there
Grabbing a can of Diet Coke, Tony decided that nobody was worth this kind of hell, and he chastised himself,
One thing had led to another, and soon, their fingers had been brushing together as they stood beside the bleachers, sending lightning up Steve’s arm, and when Tony leaned in to kiss him a moment later, Steve had figured out what people always meant about being swept off their feet.
his suit? It’s not like money was going to fall out of the weave of the fabric like a magic lamp or something. He just barely repressed a shudder.
Steve laughed, and Tony stopped feeling self-conscious and kissed him again, letting their lips brush together before his eyes fluttered closed again.
Steve Rogers, though, he’d been different. Tony had been in the high school library to pick up his interlibrary loan, a book the librarian had gotten for him—
The corners of Steve’s lips twitched upward. “I bet seeing us leave together will get them talking.”
about Steve. He sniffed and blinked the tears back. It was stupid getting emotional about it now when it was ancient history. Tony tried to shake off this unwelcome train of thought.
Tony let himself melt into Steve’s arms, even though the summer air was still too hot to be this close for too long. “You need to go,” he mumbled into Steve’s chest.
Tony’s eyes softened, chuckling as he squeezed Steve’s hand. “Yeah, yeah, it’s not just you—not at all. It feels like—it feels like you just gave me the missing piece of my heart back.” Steve smiled, and Tony poked him in the chest. “Hey, don’t look at me like that. It’s taken years of therapy for me to get in touch with my emotions. Just ask Pep.”
A frown Steve didn’t want to see touched Tony’s forehead. “Right, I got carried away. I’ll try to keep your name out of things. I’ll talk to Pep. I’ll have—”
Brock smiled, then turned serious. “You know, I’m not the same guy I used to be. I’m, um, sorry about what I did to you growing up and for making that whole mess with Tony worse on you.”
Just thinking about what happened between them ignited his righteous anger again, splitting the scars that sat across his heart back open, threatening to drown him in blood. Each adrenaline-fueled beat of his heart hurt. It was a pain he’d been trying to forget for over ten years.
“Yeah! I had no idea your office was so close. I thought Stark Industries moved to California,” Steve said, positively beaming now.
Steve heard someone come out into the hall, but he didn’t follow their expensive shoes up to their face. Instead, he kept his head down, arms resting on his knees. His butt ached from sitting on the hard tile, but it wasn’t bothersome enough to make him move. Whoever they were, they were mumbling to themselves.
Something painful clamped down on his throat, which he tried to clear. “Yeah, it happened a long time ago. Water under the bridge.”
Except now that the man was so close, Steve was beginning to realize it wasn’t that easy. Just seeing him made something churn in his stomach, and he wasn’t sure whether it was fear of Tony seeing him or anticipation for when it happened. His emotions were raw, reaching their tendrils out to strangle him, and he tugged on the collar of his shirt, trying to ease the feeling.
Steve’s mouth snapped shut as he felt Tony’s warning ripple through the air. He supposed he would be just as protective if Tony had attacked Peggy or Bucky.
It had been ten years since their breakup, and he didn’t know where to go from here. He’d held onto so much pain for it all to be empty now.
Feeling more sure of himself, Steve walked toward the refreshment table, where a few women were talking. They turned at his approach, eyes roving over him. He had to fight back an eye roll. He knew who the women were, even without the name tags. They had made fun of him relentlessly.
He cringed as Steve stared at him in disbelief. After shoving his earbuds back into his pocket, Tony fiddled with his cufflinks. “Sorry, it’s the first thing that came to—” he started as Steve stood and said, “Look, Tony—”
(it was), well, that was just the frosting on the cake. True, he hadn’t said anything to his parents about Steve, but he’d told Jarvis. Jarvis had been the one who’d mattered anyway.
While Steve had let go of him, he hadn’t stepped back. The look in his eyes reminded Tony of making out under the bleachers during pep rallies and other moments they’d stolen away together. It’d been kid stuff—pretty chaste, all things considered—but that look still sent heat curling in his stomach.
“What?” Tony managed to stammer. That was a new one. Since he’d managed to take Stark Industries from a well-known local electronics brand to a major nationally-known technology powerhouse, there had been many rumors about him, but that one was new.
He stumbled back until he hit the wall, then looked at the flickering light on the ceiling. He tried to take a steadying breath as his world readjusted. When he started to feel more stable, he dropped his eyes to look at Tony, who was watching him with concern.
Steve’s jaw dropped, and he hugged Tony tightly, then let him go again, blushing. “Sorry—I just got too excited. That’s Perkatory! My friend Bucky owns it!”
His ideas had ended up saving Stark Industries from the hole that Howard and his business partner Obie had dug it into—Howard with his drinking and Obie by embezzling money and selling company secrets to their competitors. Tony had married Pepper, and they’d had three beautiful kids before they decided to split up. This was Harley, Peter, and Morgan’s week with their mother, so Tony hadn’t needed to find a sitter.
Heads turned when they walked back into the gym, and from the whispers and pointing, it was clear that their absence and reappearance had been noticed. However, it didn’t seem to phase Tony, who took his sunglasses out of his pocket and slipped them on his face, even though they were still inside, and it was after eight.
Steve had never rolled his eyes and said, ‘Here we go again,’ when Tony had tried to talk about some of the engineering ideas he’d had. In return, Steve had shown Tony his sketchbooks, and being invited to the “gallery show” the senior art class had put together had been one of the best dates of his life to date.
Steve glanced at the clock on the wall and saw that it was still early, not even after eight. So they had plenty of time to go out together if that’s something they wanted to do. And he didn’t need to ask himself twice whether he wanted more time with Tony. Maybe that was because a part of him never truly moved on—perhaps a piece of never stopped loving him.
Steve laughed, then nodded to the gym door. “I say we head downtown and see if that old diner is still open, so I can gross you out by dipping my fries in my milkshake.”
That Steve had just avoided him all day the Monday after prom and broken up with him before he could even say anything other than, “Steve—” Well, at least he’d been able to keep the family dirt a secret for a few more years until Howard wrapped his car around a tree.
“Oh, congrats. That’s really great.” And he was happy for him, but his emotions were fraying like an old sweater with a loose thread. He needed that fresh air more than ever now, even if that meant just stepping into the hall. “It was great to see you, Brock. Um, say hi to Jack for me.”
He wanted to know if it had been worth it—if it had been fun tearing out his heart and turning his love into a joke. Because the truth was, he’d never been able to trust again since Tony, not like other people did. He’d almost bargain to say that he’d never loved again, either, not with his whole heart, anyway.
It wasn’t like he hadn’t done well for himself. He should be proud. He’d graduated from art school and now worked for a gallery in New York. He wanted for nothing, making great money. If anything, the people inside should be jealous of him.
Without giving him a chance to respond, Kevin continued, “Say, is it true that you had a threesome with Gwenyth Paltrow and Cameron Diaz?”
But before he could leave the gym, a hand grabbed his elbow, stopping his escape. He tensed on instinct because he saw everyone in the room as a predator, and he couldn’t shake the feeling of being prey.
Brock shrugged. “Yeah, I was angry and confused. I took it out on you. I really am sorry about that. I’m, um, married. My husband’s Jack, you remember him, right? Jack Rollins? Anyway, we’ve been married for six years this September.”
“At least you were able to move on and have a family,” Steve said, the corners of his mouth pulled down slightly as he thought.
It’d been like a dream Tony had never wanted to wake up from—just perfect. The thrill he’d felt every time Steve smiled was indescribable. Of course, Tony didn’t know when he’d fallen for Steve, but that didn’t matter too much. Steve was cute, funny, and intelligent—and seemed to like him too.
Until he’d hit his growth spurt in college, Steve had been skinny and sickly, his body not matching his personality. Before his mother died when he was nineteen, she had told him that she’d always known he’d grow into his emotions. Because if there was ever anything true about Steve, it was that he felt deeply and reacted in kind.
Tony had told him not to pay attention while simultaneously giving the crowds an eyeful every chance he got. They had always been touching, orbiting each other. It had been such a deep and heady feeling to be around Tony. Steve had quickly become lost in it.
. A short, semi-hysterical laugh was cut off by the stabbing pain in his chest that took his breath away.
When he closed his eyes, he could smell the boozy sweat in Howard’s hair and feel the vomit in his socks and hear his mother wailing about how Howard was dying until they’d sedated her and she’d just stared at him, glassy-eyed. The pain that shot through his chest when he tried to breathe was back, making taking deep breaths almost impossible.
For a big guy (and wasn’t that weird to get used to?), Steve looked as drained and tired as Tony felt. “I wasted so much time being angry with you.”
There was silence for a few beats, save for Steve’s heavy breathing. Then like thunder Tony’s voice cracked into the hall. “Me? You want a fucking apology from me?” Tony stepped closer until their toes nearly touched, not deterred at all by Steve’s bigger size. It almost threw Steve off a bit. He wasn’t used to people challenging him like that, not since he started hitting the gym.
Just when Tony thought he might have thirty seconds to text Rhodey and tell his best friend in the universe that he’d been right, that this was stupid, Tony felt a meaty hand land on his shoulder. Turning, Tony saw Kevin, Lizzie’s husband, and a few of his buddies. He had no recollection of these people whatsoever.
Unfortunately, Tony’s anger fled just as quickly as it had come, leaving a whole new hurt in its wake. “Standing you up—
Two hours and forty minutes later (162 minutes and 37 seconds, but who’s counting?) Tony got a text from Steve: “Home. See you Monday at 12:30.”
Tony’s expression softened as he sighed, his shoulders gaining a curve. At least they looked less rigid. “I didn’t stop you. I could have said something—but after the weekend I’d had, I just—everything felt like too much, and I thought to myself that it made sense. So I blamed myself, you know?”
“You could be a little less right sometimes, Pep,” he’d said, and she had laughed. Tony still loved Pepper’s laugh. He still cared deeply about her, but they were platonic feelings and probably always had been.
Staring at his ceiling in the slowly brightening room, Tony had consoled himself with the fact that at least Steve wasn’t just somebody who wanted to be seen with ‘Tony Stark.’ Even if Steve didn’t understand what Tony was going through with his parents, Steve would listen and understand… because Tony loved him and needed somebody to tell him this wasn’t forever, that he wasn’t doomed to become his father.
Looking back longingly at his car parked too far away, Tony noticed a few other latecomers and decided it wasn’t worth the minuscule buzz on Twitter that Tony Stark was seen sprinting away from his high school reunion. That was why he’d parked so far away—so it would be harder to flee.
Tony’s heart leapt in his chest. “What did you have in mind? ‘Cause I’d kind of like to ditch this pop stand. Maybe we could make our escape and go have some dinner and a couple of drinks? I passed on the steak dinner at the country club, so I’m starving.” He hadn’t been earlier but now was a different story. “Or, if you want everyone to see you dancing with Tony Stark, I’m all yours. It sounds like they started the music in there.”
Tony’s shoulders drooped. “Well, after all this, I’ve learned a very valuable lesson about not trying to guess what you’re thinking.” Tony grinned and nudged Steve a little with his elbow. Maybe it was too soon for that. Maybe Steve just wanted to wash his hands of the whole thing. But then, if that was the case, wouldn’t he just look relieved, give a hearty handshake and go about his business?
Growing up smaller than everyone else and with a big mouth to boot meant that Steve got in a lot of fights, and high school proved no different than the playground.
The old wounds he carried from high school, from Tony, were starting to protest under the pressure of the reunion. The flesh around them turned irritated and raw, and he knew it wouldn’t take much to split that skin again.
People had snickered and outright laughed at him every day in the halls, but he’d still held his chin high. He hadn’t given much thought to the popular kids outside of making sure to stay out of their way, that was until he’d literally stumbled into Tony Stark in the library.
With a shaky hand, Steve pointed at him, mouth a hard line. “You know what? No, I’m not sorry—not after everything.” His chest heaved with the force of his breaths that hissed through his teeth. Tony opened his mouth, anger settling over his brow, but Steve snapped at him again before he could speak. “How dare you come here and say anything other than I’m sorry.” He grit his teeth together, and unable to stand Tony’s face any longer, he looked past him at a poster.
The whole experience felt like a dream. In all the times he’d imagined talking to Tony again, he’d never thought it could turn out like this—with the two of them holding hands, igniting rumors, and heading to dinner.
People were milling around, and there was a table to the left of the door with name tags and a marker.
He sighed. He shouldn’t assume what they’re like now. Maybe the assholes he’d grown up with had turned out to be upstanding citizens—
Yeah, yeah. Hindsight was twenty-twenty. He’d thought—hoped—that he’d be able to ask Steve why he hadn’t just asked him outright for help with getting people to leave him alone and instead had made it feel so real.
Something soft and fond blossomed in Steve’s expression. “Okay, no problem, Tony.” He gave Tony’s hand another squeeze and let go to get into his car.
Steve’s mouth opened, then clicked closed, only to open again as he spat out, “What? You’re not making any sense. I just need—” He put up a hand, stepping back, needing space to breathe. He spun around again, facing Tony’s silence, head tilting to the side. “You didn’t plan it? All this time … you mean I wasn’t some joke?”
That advice had been drilled into him at such an early age he couldn’t remember not knowing it. And it was true. People wanted to hang out with the kid who was laughing and making jokes all the time. It made them forget he was so smart.
“Is this what moving on looks like to you?” Tony asked with the hint of a smile. “You need to get your eyes checked. And ask Pepper how that worked out. No, don’t. She’d say it was
Tony felt his face tingling, and he couldn’t tell if he’d gone pale or flushed. Honestly, had he actually expected anything else? No… but he’d
Threading his fingers in his hair, he slid down the wall until he was sitting on the floor. God, he hoped no one came out here and saw him like this.
“Hey, no. Wait.” Panic struck Steve, and he cursed his poor choice of words. Tony tried to pull his hand away, but Steve wouldn’t let him go. “I just meant—it’s not just me, right? There’s still something here. Please tell me I’m not alone.”
He typed and deleted half a dozen responses before settling on a double thumbs up and “Pleasant dreams.”
, he thought to himself and closed his eyes to dream of the painted stars in the alley murals where Steve was waiting for him.
He hadn’t wanted to believe them, but the seeds of doubt had been planted. It had only taken another month before he realized the truth of their words.
Now it had been ten years, and he was sitting outside the gym at his old school, and Tony Stark could very well already be inside. He hoped the man found this beneath him and skipped.
Steve cleared his throat, suddenly feeling very unbalanced sitting on the floor with Tony above him. He wanted to stand, but he also didn’t want to scare Tony off. He wasn’t sure why, but he thought it wouldn’t take much to spook him, which was quite a thing since Tony was the root of the problem.
Tony had tried to corner him the next day, but Steve pushed by him, telling him it was over. Tony’s response had said it all. He’d simply shut down, suddenly looking cold.
He looked away from Tony, taking a sip of his soda, the fizzy liquid easing the dryness in his throat. His anxiety about being here was building, and it felt like a rope was being wrapped around his chest, cinching his lungs. It reminded him of the asthma attacks he used to have.
“And I still won’t. Some of us have a refined palate.” The laughter still hadn’t left him, and he shook his head, stepping toward the door. “Shall we?”
life?” Steve said, his tone accusatory. “I’m the one who waited outside the dance for you for two and half hours while everyone else in school had a good laugh about it.” Steve’s face flushed with anger. “‘The best joke you ever played on anybody.’ People were talking about it for
He was just thinking over his escape plan when he heard the faint sound of a song that stirred something old and nostalgic in his chest. It had been Tony’s favorite. Hell’s Bells by AC/DC. It was enough of a surprise to hear that it made him look in the direction of the tinny sound.
And maybe he should have called later that Sunday, but Obie had come over having heard from Tony’s mother about Howard’s ‘episode.’ It had been the worst weekend of his life. But then, he was pulled out of his unwilling trip down memory lane by a snippet of conversation he overheard from a group of people standing nearby.
Steve just stood there looking menacing, as if he was trying to make up for all the years of being picked on. Immovable. The tendons along his jaw tightened and flexed.
“Wait, what?” He couldn’t mean… There was no way Brock was gay, not after what he called Steve when he’d come out.
While hauling his father out of the car, the asshole had thrown up all over Tony and his suit. He’d felt the used scotch inside his shoes. There’d been no way he could show up to
He’d left Steve standing alone outside the school, holding the stupid rose, as some of Tony’s friends pointed and snickered at him as they went inside.
Steve smiled, eyes flicking down to their hands, then back up. His smile faltered a little. “What are we doing, Tony?”
Tony had been his first love, his first heartbreak, and the person who taught him how cruel the world could be.
This was too much. Steve’s fingers found his hair, and he tugged the strands as some animalistic noise clawed out of his throat. He could feel his muscles shaking, and for a moment, it was only him in the hall. Everything else melted away.
As he stared at the back entrance to the gym, colorful balloons framing the doorway, his mind wandered to the one person that kept him firmly in the car. He could face the bullies and assholes if he were honest, but facing Tony was another story.
“Hey, man, great to see you! Still the life of the party, huh?” Kevin chuckled. For a moment, Tony wished he could just wink out of existence.
Steve had been walking up to the checkout desk with a stack of books so tall the guy could hardly see. He’d peeked around the stack of books and swerved to avoid running into Tony, which had sent the books tumbling everywhere. They’d started talking while picking up the books, and it’d been nice to have someone to talk to about something he actually cared about.
like that and embarrass Steve, so he’d showered and changed into his other suit (contrary to popular belief, he hadn’t had a closetful of them back then—just the two).
“I’m just gonna….” Tony pointed to the refreshments where thankfully they had cans of soda and peeled himself out of Stephanie’s clutches. Thank god they accepted the excuse so they could gossip amongst themselves, the couple of vipers….
It took a second to process his words that were said in such a friendly tone. Then, finally, he touched his fingers to his chest and said, “You know who I am, right?”
“I did, didn’t I?” Steve’s mind was still churning over the details of what had happened. “I really blew it, huh?”
Maybe now that Steve had gotten what he wanted, he’d go bother someone else with his stupid muscles.
Tony had always had people around him in those days, but none of them had really been his friends. He got invited to parties because he could always bring liquor. Howard had never called him on it because he probably hadn’t been able to remember if he’d drunk it himself or not. Jarvis had probably suspected but hadn’t said much more than to call if he got into trouble or needed a ride home.
While Jarvis drove one car with Howard in the back seat, Tony had driven his car with his hysterical mother. By the time they got to the Summerdale Pines Recovery Center (which Tony still thought sounded like a place to find zombies), his mother had almost convinced herself that Howard was already dead and had needed to be sedated on arrival.
They’d planned to meet at the dance beside the oak tree on the lawn. The school had set up a spot for photos there, twinkle lights hanging from the branches, which meant people were gathered and watching.
Sitting in the car now, he could still remember the feeling of trepidation he’d had that night. Something hadn’t felt right. He should have known, but he was young, stupid, and in love.
“So you’re going to see all those other completely sincere people you were friends with back then and catch up with who’s gotten married, who got fat, and who still has their hair,” Pepper had said, eyebrows raised, not believing him for an instant.
His skin felt clammy, and he shoved his hands into his pockets so no one could see them shaking. He sauntered over to the door to the hallway, turned to face the room, raised his eyebrows, and leaned back against the metal bar to open the door—new plan: hide in the bathroom for half an hour and sneak out somehow.
Tony had driven past the high school five or six times before stopping the car down the block to just stare at the school. He could honestly say the worst years of his life had taken place while he was a student here. Howard’s drinking had just gone from bad to worse during those years.
“I’m exciting. What can I say?” Tony let go and held his hands up. “Safe and sane driving all the way. ...Even though I’m not driving the grocery-getter.”
Steve nodded, his features brightening. “My gallery isn’t far from there. It’s down an alley that’s full of murals that spill out onto the buildings along the street.”
Looking away, Tony just felt the anger leave in a rush. He was so incredibly tired. All he wanted right now was to go back to his hotel and cry about the boy he’d loved so much but who’d never really existed. “To answer your question, yeah, getting dumped after the worst weekend of my life was great—hilarious. Thanks for asking.” He crossed one arm across his chest and rubbed the back of his neck with his other hand. “If getting seen around with me at some big event was that important to you, you could’ve just asked. If the art thing dries up, you’d make a hell of an actor.”
He smoothed his hands down the front of his suit and tried to find the smile people expected to see. Adjusting his sunglasses, Tony took a breath and pushed the door open, a smile that didn’t meet his eyes finding its way to his face as he turned his attention to the women at the registration desk.
"Seriously? " Tony said, "Alien, are you really  distracted? It's Tony Stark here, just in case you don't know. " He tore off Steve's belt and pulled down his pants, "Pay attention if you're going to role-play, Greenskin Shrek. They say you're all very professional. " He forcefully tore off the last piece of fabric, holding the penis. He does blowjob with great skill.
Tony is exhausted. The alcohol he know so well also knows him, of  course. What is absurd is his intelligence is really extraordinary, makes the illusion is really complete and particularly perfect. He waved his hand: "Come on. Don't make this personal. I'm paying for all the bad things that have happened between us, and I'm in such a mess that I don't need another lecture from you. "
His hands groped down and unzipped Steve's pants. He was a master of his craft, and he rubbed the hard object familiarly across the cloth, at the edge of its outline.
Until he reached the end of the war, the last battle against the wind to raise the shield. He drew his long bow, lifted his hammer, and brought down the thunder. He roars at the whole sky with the body and the will of man. It was a victory, a victory of sacrifice and exhaustion. Green shoots sprout from the branches, and the whole world grows anew. The good times are clearly not his good times. He had nothing again and could not lose more. He bent his head, he saw himself stepped on Tony's discarded armor, and the world was built on thousands of his faded and scarred armor. He was suddenly tired .He had carried the sacred and the great for too long, the weight of faith let him collapsed. Is that death? Will death rot him with the suit?
"Tony, tell me what I can do, " Steve said. His voice was dry, a charred ruin; a stripe had sunk into the center of his furrowed brow. Tony got very close to him and reached out to touch his forehead. He said softly, "it's not... it's not important, it's not worth it. Captain, the worst has happened. You know what I want? Alcohol, drugs, sex, anything to keep my mind off of me -- it keeps spinning, spinning, spinning, it just won't stop, can't stop telling me the worst has happened. It's fucking tricky, isn't it?"
"Why don't you give me a hug? " Tony's hand went around his shoulder, his skin pressed up against Steve's, and they hugged like this in a room that smelled of sex, as if everything had melted and flowed away like water, "Why don't you hug me, captain? "
Tony stood next to a mock up of a suit of armor, holding something like a stun gun that sparkled. Steve did not know what kind of experiment Tony had failed in, but he soon threw it restlessly on the table. His hair was tousled, his eyes were red, and he looked tired. There was a distinct smell in the air, the familiar smell of Tony Stark's . The smell of machinery, the smell of sparks, the smell of perfume, and a bit of blood. But the largest share is still alcohol.
It's worth it. Yeah, it's... It's worth it. Unexpectedly So he couldn't blame anyone at all -- it was worth it; the Avengers always will do these sacrifice things. Anyone would have done it. Natasha would. Tony would. And so will he.
The paranoid part of Steve's body starts acting up again, not because of a sense of justice or a desire to save, but because of his emotions. The complicated and obscure thing was running wild in his limbs, trying to burrow out of his guts and brain, trying to burrow out of his skin. He thought: Tony was in a particularly bad place at the time,  as he had just stepped down as S.H.I.E.L.D.'s commander in this time. Steve's mind seemed unable to analyze any more. All he could think about was that Tony was still alive. He's still alive. He's alive. He's totally ALIVE.
He couldn't move his feet. He knew what he has to do. Mission Accomplished. The Infinity Stone has been returned.  He should return, instead of being a ghost, who is roaming on the wilderness of time. Past, now, and future, all three things began to be mixed up and utterly confused, and everything seemed to him to be indistinguishable —— In fact, he only wanted to breathe more of the air of 2016. For a brief moment of hesitation, he saw Tony.
He couldn't see Tony's face, only hear his words, "I just want you to know how much I want to save you, I want to be what you are in my heart -- a hero... " Steve sobbed and nodded, he was literally -- he never knew he could have so many tears: "You've always... you're so much better than me, Tony. You're the real hero. And I love you."
Steve dropped to his knees, looked down at him, and buried his head in his arms. And that's when Captain America finally cried. Tears slowly welled up in his eyes, sliding from the skin of his arms to the surface, perhaps to the Musky scent of semen and bodily fluids.
Tony try to push his shoulder, but unable to shake a superhuman with the power to break a golden, so he removes his clothes. Tony's skin was white for indoor years, the reactor was blue and fluorescent, and his body was long and compact. Steve could not ignore the criss crossing scars, the cuts from the cold steels, the bruises from the hot weapons, the burns, the bruises. His body endured countless battles, but he was only a common man, as if he were taking Steve's hand to his back hole. Tony felt the heat, the heat of desire, the secret heat, the heat of pain, the heat of the steam spurting out of him.
"Oh great, " Tony Stark said. "Alcohol screw-up everything all the time. How does it know who the last person I want to see is and always will be? "
The air is still pressing down relentlessly. Half the universe hovered in the center of the bubble, floating, shattering, collapsing, falling like a meteor, lighting a fire around him. He was in the middle of the fire, his vision blurred by the black smoke. He knew his mission had failed, his plan had gone wrong, his meaning had been lost. He looked at the whales swimming in the Hudson.
Steve tensed himself. Every touch of Tony distressed him, driving him crazy. He knows what he's doing, he's stealing and cheating. Greed and lust are taking over his brain. He is going to hell, he is wrong again. The unmelted ice froze around him, cold, too cold, he was dying. He walked across the scorched earth of a century. He was strong-willed and alone.
Tony, still shivering in the afterglow of the orgasm, laughs, "Too deep in the act? " He feels the blond man shaking on his arm and says sorry. He didn't know what this Steve was apologizing for. He wryly wrung his lips, mostly to apologize for "not saving him". The mentally ill soldier, his the virus that infects shapeshifters.
Tony struggled to his feet from his arms. His pupils constricted, his eyes broken and sharp like shards of dagger, staring into Steve's face. For a second, Steve thought he might bite a piece of his face off.
He sat up, his hands on Steve Rogers' face, and forced him to lift his head. Tony looked at the tearful captain, his blue eyes with tears. He said, "Even after everything we've been through, even after everything we've done to each other... the worst has happened, the worst that I can't face it. You're dead. There's something I've wanted to say to you all these years... and now I can't. Captain, it's not worth it. It's not..."
Tony whispered, "my God, I really feel like you're him... I don't know if you are, but maybe I'm confessing to a crazy greenskin who's addicted to acting. Captain, I've got nothing to gain from this war, except your death. I told you, it's not worth..."
The man below looked up at Steve, Tony Stark, the hero of all time, the brilliant genius, holding him in his arms. His fingers clung to his back, crying out his name, disoriented and broken.
Steve felt like he was the one who was completely taken over. The thrills that paralyzed his entire lower body rushed and erupted in a steady stream, and as he relaxed, he was tense as hell, jerking off into the moist cavity. His spine was numb with electricity, and his throat was muffled with pleasure. Tony's eyes looked up at him, his partially swallowed saliva dripping with his semen, his chin curved all the way down to the ground, and now Tony's face was covered in wolf prints. He was sweating profusely, his beard was wet, his semen was still on his cheeks, and his lips, which had just been fucked, were red and swollen and glistening. His mouth opened for him, and said something:
Steve's eyes are moist, and the thrill rushes from his lower body through all his veins to his brain. Tony opening his mouth and sucking in the entire penis. The heat is already in that licking, and he feels as if life is throbbing. The tip of his penis had sunk into Tony's soft throat. Oh, my God, he is fuckable. He is so good at oral sex, he is ALIVE.
Full of life in each other's collision, they are warmly rejected, passionately kiss, at the end of the time.
With his broken, sharp sarcasm, it seems that a thousand knives in the throat."what's going on?  I'm extremely incorrigible so Nick Fury sends over a blow-up doll? Funny." He deliberately fabricated a pompous sweet:"Oh dear, are you the kind of high-class? I've heard that not only can advanced characters be faked, but even memories can be simulated. Seriously, it's so humiliating for the losing side to be involved in selling their bodies. Thank you for reminding me to kill myself before I lose the next game."
Tony Stark can't tell whether his tears are now coming from sex or emotion, and he believe it's the former. They are both naked, as if he had a hard, dry, unsentimental voice, and his performance in bed: "listen, this... this was the right thing to do. I'd give anything for that. I fought in the civil war. I know everyone sympathizes with the weak, but I feel like I have to be a tough guy, huh? there's always a tough one."
Physical tears flowed uncontrollably, and Steve kissed them off intimately and gently. He didn't know if he was pathetic enough for the gentleman or if Steve was sensitive enough in the bedroom. His actions seemed to comfort him rather than drive him mad, but Tony tried to give himself completely. He kind of wanted to be killed right here on this table, so that his mind could rest for a moment, without suffering from endless pain and anxiety. All other ways of death are off the table tonight.
He wound up every muscle. No, there's nothing wrong with that, it makes up for Steve's mistake, he shouldn't have been here... Sooner or later, in the right timeline, another Steve Rogers gonna come back to life, and he, is just a ghost from future that shouldn't exist, the wraith shouldn't have opened up a new timeline. He uses the pym particle to steal an extra moment to glance at Tony, purely to selfishly flatter himself, he just can't help himeself to do so. Tony is blaming himself for his death, and it's not even Tony's fault. In fact, Captain America was the one who nearly killed him in the civil war, a long long war that drained their sanity before the biggest crisis.
God, he couldn't figure out what he was going to do. He wanted to make a vow -- even himself didn't know it.
Steve felt the tension getting worse, and he wanted to say something witty to break the silence but nothing came tomind. He wanted to say something witty to Tony, but nothing came tomind. He wanted to say something witty, but nothing came tomind. He folded Tony's legs and slammed them into them, gritting his teeth, thinking that our changed past was so much more than just sex, that soon even the comforting thought fell away, and he sank into the sea of desire. Tony let out a hoot and a Holler to the rhythm of his thrusts.
Tony was drowned in the thrill of extermination, he let out a dumb Moan, he probably lost part of his consciousness in the madness. Semen and cum flowed from the extracted penis to the workbench, where Tony lay as shattered and utterly disoriented by an unspeakable sense of shame.
He was buried in Tony's hot, steamy inner cave, and he opened the body like a ray of light cut through the dark, mysterious, damp jungles. An entire world of secret lust sucking his penis and gnawing at his soul. His eyes ached from the ravishing taste, and he was seized by the excitement of sex. He clenched his teeth and forced himself in, his body tingling with a dense tickling.
Steve couldn't help himself. He walks up, like he throws the 10,000 alarms into the ocean, "Tony, you've done enough. "
