Sam takes a few long breaths before turning to look at his brother, who looks… Oh right, that’s his worried face. Uh…
“Uh, no. I was on my way to the main room before I stopped by, actually. Sammy’ll probably be in there, reading a new encyclopedia.” He explains absentmindedly. “Or he might be practicing his ASL with Eileen, I don’t know.” Now that he thinks about it, there’s definitely laughter coming from the corner of the hallway, so option 2 is probably the most likely.
nice to breathe, he hasn’t done that in a hot second). He’s gasping for precious air, his lungs desperately empty — it’s like she’s trying to push him through the fucking floor, which, newsflash, isn’t physically possible! Alright, he’s officially panicking, she’s suffocating him and he still can’t think properly, he can’t move, and she’s even decided to wrap both her hands around his neck, her claws
. Okay. Where the fuck did he fly off to again. He shivers, breathing condensation into the air, and fails to resist the temptation to pretend he’s a dragon, or a train. And suddenly Cas is back, holding something in his hands. Several somethings, actually. He watches as the angel confidently steps towards him, and doesn’t resist when he slides a beanie on his head, or when he wraps a scarf around his neck, or when he grabs his hands to stretch a pair of gloves over them, or when he maneuvers him around to slip him into a big woolen coat. Why did he not resist. What the fuck just happened. He’s not going to complain though, he’s already regaining feeling in his fingers, but
Cas scoffed, rolling his eyes. “I’m glad you’ve rationalized your blatant disregard for rules and respect since.”
with the cake decorator. (Which, again, she was a homophobic bitch. So it wasn’t uncalled for or even remotely unsatisfying.)
Sam snickered. Cas just shook his head at them disapprovingly, but Dean could see the twitch at the corner of his mouth. Charlie, as usual, looked unfazed. She nodded at the kids, “I concur.”
“No, you fuckin’ won’t,” Dean growled, pulling himself out from under the car. “’Coz you get the goddamn order mixed up. Every time.”
When they got back inside the house, the kitchen was empty but a crumb-covered plate on the table suggested Sam had in fact fed himself. Dean grumbled as he cleared it away to the sink, then grabbed a couple of glasses from the cabinet above it. Good to know where those were. He filled the cups from a pitcher in the fridge, not the tap, handed one to Cas, and downed his own glass without taking a breath.
Three seconds later, Dean was ready to sink into the floor, or crawl all the way under Novak’s chair and stay there until the end of days, or tell Junior exactly who he was and why he was there and let himself get shot in the head. All of those seemed like better options than ever having to look Novak in the eye again. Fuck, how had he let that happen? Doing what they had to to keep Junior happy, that was one thing, but Dean getting off on it was so far past okay. Maybe he’d take Moncrieff’s advice and throw himself off the roof after all. Wasn’t like there was anywhere else to go after getting kicked out of the wire unit, and he couldn’t imagine they’d be keeping him around after the night was over.
Their younger kid, who’d crossed the threshold to adulthood in captivity, wanted to go off on his own and see the world. That had been . . . a discussion. In the end, Cas had acquiesced, valiantly giving up his “little” yarn fund (what the fuck) for the
Claire innocently volunteered to get the next round. Cas shattered her dreams with a firm hand to the shoulder. She pouted, “Daaaaad, I’m almost twenty-one!”
It wasn’t a great time to realize he wanted that from someone. Not necessarily Novak. No, fuck that, definitely not Novak. That was asking for so many disasters it spiked his adrenaline just thinking about it. But having a real, steady relationship instead of random hookups. Someone he could trust to give it to him how he liked and not look down on him in the morning, who could live with the fact that he was always going to be his job with its stress and risks and long hours, who liked him enough to really want to keep him—
There was a moment of silence as they all considered this, Dean and Lafitte looking at Novak while Novak looked across to the desk in the far corner that held some completed pieces and some in further stages of being built. Then, maybe feeling just as uneasy at the weight of the conversation turning serious as Dean did, Lafitte asked, “So you like me?”
The noise Novak made was probably thought or agreement, but it sounded close enough to a growl to send a thrill down Dean’s spine and other, even less helpful parts of his anatomy. He didn’t know what it was about Novak that made him feel like a desperate, undersexed teenager, especially when he hadn’t even been desperate and undersexed as a teenager. But the guy played his part like second nature, like he really did the leather top thing and took pride in doing it well.
“Just so you know, you can’t apply for a divorce before we get married,” Castiel had said, before launching a smothering device into Dean’s face. Spitting out wisps of cheap yarn, Dean had finally regained use of his lungs and held up the . . . what was that even
Novak wasn’t doing too badly with his alcohol, though. Good thing, too, because the very next thing Junior asked was, “So how’d you two lovebirds meet?”
Leaning in just enough to play at friendly conspiracy without getting anywhere near uncomfortably close to Junior, Dean said, “Jimmy’s just a little particular about his personal things, you know? Didn’t even let me see his underwear drawer for a good six months.”
Cas shrugged, suddenly looking that much smaller. “Pretty self-explanatory. After allꟷ” he waved his arm, “
“Are you . . .” he trailed off, unsure of what to say. A wave of drowsiness washed over him. He shook his head clear, eyes flicking to Rowena, who looked suspiciously awake. “Are
The moon was out when they slipped through the doorless cabin entrance, bright enough that they didn’t need the flashlight Cas had shoved into his jacket pocket. They reached the hollow tree before the woods turned denser, and Jimmy was already inside with his own light.
Arthur Ketch canted his head, narrowing his eyes at him. “I don’t know you. Pleased to make your acquaintance, Mister . . . ?”
Cas stayed restless under Dean’s watch, constantly in motion with nowhere to go. The hand Dean rested on his chest wasn’t really intended to accomplish anything—it was for him, not for Cas—but he made a perfunctory effort to tune into Cas’s senses. As expected, he found nothing he could do to decrease Cas’s sensitivity, not when he was in such a bad zone that he didn’t even register Dean’s touch.
But she rolled her eyes and he could almost hear her ‘don’t be daft, boyo’. She was growing on him. He didn’t know how he felt about that. “Read the labels.”
He takes in the sight. This was a great idea, Cas focuses on an undefined spot in the distance, right above Dean’s shoulder, and damn does the dimming sun makes him look good. And the hat. Definitely the hat. Cas looks taller here, confident, strong. Dean’s also not going to wonder how that makes him feel. Picture to take, case to solve, monster to kill, he’s starting to get the hand of it (debatable).

“Half-n-half, thanks.” Dean adds, because, yeah, Cas may not currently be drowning in the Empty, but his fear is still there.
Sam parks the car in the motel’s mostly-empty parking lot, a few spots away from a huge, bright red Ford truck, adorned with various ‘
“Oh. Have you told Sam yet?” Cas asks, squinting at him as if he’s trying to read his mind, pulling Dean back into the saner part of his brain.
Once they’ve carefully watched enough of Jack’s tiny breaths, Dean heads back outside and sees Cas close the door. And there it is again, the panic.
Dean’s cracking jokes in response to his little brother’s babbling, and yet, there’s a haunted look in his eyes. They almost seem… wild; like there’s a threat nearby, like it’s about to attack
“I went to Saas Fee again. You remember the Allalin, right?” He pauses a moment, waiting for a nod. “It’s still just as peaceful as I remembered it to be. I even left my mark there, a snow angel, at the highest point. It’s probably been wiped off by now, but it looked pretty majestic — not as much as the one you imprinted there last time, but still beautiful. Maybe someone saw it, I hope so at least.” Then, chuckling to himself, he adds: “Whoever they are, they must’ve been quite confused. Wish I could’ve been there to see their face."
He’s seen a lot of disturbing shit in his lifetime, but Dean’s back was uh… Not pretty. It was covered in strange letters, carved deeply into his skin, some even all the way to the
”, so he pushed his own hand forward, loosened his grip on the tome, and let her grab it. In a rush, she flipped it open to the first page, softly traced over her name with one finger, and Cas noticed her shoulders dropping in relief. Her eyes found his own again, and she whispered a heartfelt “
Maybe it would bring them luck, having a pretend home they cared about inside the pretend home that might get them killed.
“No, don’t,” Dean murmured, wincing in anticipation. Because Claire looked absolutely horrified, staring at her father. Kaia was attempting to block her view, but she wasn’t having any of it.
Though impressively spacious, the cavern within the stump couldn’t fit all three of them. Balthazar dismissed that concern with a scoff.
He didn’t. Grinding his teeth to push it down, he nodded and unclenched his jaw just long enough to make himself say, “Yeah, maybe it’s best you go alone after all.”
Either way, Cas just scowled and said, “Back to the Tran house. I need to take another look around without distractions.”
They both turned to Cas. Dean felt his anger thaw a little bit. He did look a little angelic, all ruffled up and soft and dopey. Refusing to back down though, Dean said, “He’s gonna wake up grumpy if we let him sleep like that.”
If anything, they intensified: his legs twitched and kicked out like he was running and his arms flew up to shelter his head. Even his face twisted in what looked like terror, though his eyes stayed fixed and open and he didn’t speak at all. Dean tried one more time, grabbing Cas’s shoulders and shaking, calling out his name, but nothing changed.
He changed tactics, “You ever seen Niagara Falls? Hiked the Grand Canyon? Looked up to try and see the tops of redwoods?”
“Nah, dude, I’ve been here,” Sam snorted. “Gonna take a gander at the offline systems,” the kid mumbled before he all but shoved Dean towards the bed to beat a hasty retreat.
“I’m not sure what there is to tell. They were one of my first planned modifications, though it took several years and countless versions for Naomi to make them functional.”
Every now and then, they’d slow down and then Charlie would push off some surface they couldn’t see, hauling them forward like a very codependent string of comets.
“Dean, please.” Cas’s legs were folded, hands resting on his knees. He looked at Dean with raw plea and apprehension.
“What’s the verdict, Doc?” he jibed, breezing over to them. Jack grinned at him in greeting, and Dean ruffled his hair. Kid was just so gosh darn adorable. His dad too, so Dean leaned over and pecked Cas on the lips. Cas immediately looked livelier.
The Tran house looked like every other house in its neighborhood: whitewashed concrete and reinforced plexi windows, corn-plastic grass behind steel and concrete gates. Linda Tran, Kevin’s mother, greeted them at the door with a businesslike, “You’re going to find my son.” It was much more command than question and Dean appreciated the just-about vote of confidence after the rest of the day’s bullshit.
“How about you drop those toys and tell me what you know about this ship here? In a civilized manner.”
Dad smiled. He took a few steps closer and paused. Claire fidgeted under the focus of the sappiness on his face. “What?”
“There was a maintenance issue with my implants, which is still preferable to having to rely on someone like you to monitor my every move.”
“Sorry, sorry,” he muttered, slipping into the map room, and slotting himself between Rowena and Sam in the loose circle.
Novak looked up from the tiny table he was gluing together just long enough to ask, “Got something?”
That was where assumptions landed him. Still, just because Jimmy hated the work, that didn’t mean he couldn’t try it. He wanted to know more about the family business, how it worked and what they did there. Jimmy and Jody might not have been Campbells by blood, but from everything he’d seen and been told, that didn’t make a difference to anyone. Campbell Cellars was just as much theirs as anyone else’s. Jimmy had said that Mary even considered changing the name, since there was no one left with the name Campbell—it had been her maiden name, before she married Dean and Sam’s late father—but they’d decided as a family to keep it.
A haze of disjointed panic followed him as he rushed to the airlock with fleeting instructions. Rowena was with Cas. Sam had been positioned in the control room. Dean snapped on his helmet and unlocked the door.
Yep, worst time to make that joke. Dean shook his head with a grimace. Cas hurried to clarify, “I mean, you sound like her.”
He heard Sam inhale sharply, in time with himself. Behind Cas, Bobby sighed. “Drink up then. ‘Coz liquor cabinet’s off-limits from tomorrow.”
Jody sagged, all the fight going out of her at once, but just as quickly she steeled her resolve and sat at the foot of the bed. “Okay. Okay. We’ve got a lot to talk about here, and maybe now isn’t the best time for it.”
She’d said it was because he couldn’t come to her. So she went where he’d find her easily. She wanted to be close to him after. After.
With his best smile, or at least the best one he could muster at the moment, Dean said, “Hey there, neighbor! We just moved here, I’m Dean Smith, and I’m so sorry for introducing myself like this, but we’re having a bit of phone trouble and I was hoping I could use yours?”
“Couldn’t tell,” he bit out, trying to push away flashes of horrifying visuals. He wasn’t sleeping for a month, otherwise. God, he needed a drink. Or some weed.
He moved the hand Junior couldn’t see until he was touching Novak’s thigh and there he squeezed slowly, deliberately, four times. The signal that had been meant as sarcasm, but Dean was glad to have it if it worked to remind Novak what they were really there for and to let him know that Dean really was ready to do what needed to be done.
The emotions roiling in his chest, already nearly unbearable, exploded as Jody reached out her hand for him to hold; he did, having to make a conscious effort not to seem overly eager for it.
“Well, then you’re screwed,” Dean snorted. “Lemme guess, he said everything was ‘fine’ and started fiddling with the Nav?”
“You’re a dick,” he said, finally. “You’re a heartless, soulless son of a bitch.” He didn’t let Cas get another word in edgewise, because he was done bearing the brunt of Cas’s misdirected anger. He was done talking about this, because clearly talking was just making things worse. “You know what? I’ll go prep the system for hyperdrive.”
Castiel laughed softly before providing one. “No. You woke up enough to carry yourself. You don’t remember?”
Dean pulled out the bottle of sleeping pills he’d picked up as an emergency option at the store. “Dont,” he repeated, “eat the soup.”
“Alpha, Charlie approaching,” static hummed in his ears. He turned back to see Charlie, holding onto Cas, pulling them towards the brothers and Rowena. Judging by the thunderous expression on Cas’s face and the hard lines on Charlie’s, they hadn’t had much success either.
He dropped his head, hair almost brushing Dean’s chin. He was close enough that he could smell the scent of the clinical shampoo they used, somehow still intact after three days of near-coma. “Meg.”
“I implore you to rethink my proposal, Earthlings,” Rowena was saying. “Split the water amongst yourselves and I will concoct a brew you can administer to Castiel.”
It might be a week on Earth by the time they returned. Or a year. Or, worst case scenario, a decade. His gaze drifted towards Bobby. At risk of sounding sentimental, he warned the man that he would kick his ass if he bit it before they returned. With all due respect.
Are you throwing yourself at Dean like a thirsty teen drama character because that might be a giveaway
It wasn’t like he didn’t get it; he knew there were fuckers all over the department with their hands in the cookie jar. But that didn’t give Novak the right to accuse Dean of it, especially not to be such a colossal dick about it. Dean wasn’t an idiot for not figuring out what had been going on when there hadn’t been any reason to think that was what it was. No one had done anything to suggest it, including Novak himself, and Dean hadn’t assumed it was a standard suspicion for any newcomers.
Behind Cas’s back, where he was sure the man couldn’t see it, he gave her the bird. The kids laughed, delighted. He was going to be
“Hey, come on,” Sam was suddenly jostling him. Not too hard, thankfully. God knew he wouldn’t have been able to stomach that. “Dean, stay awake.”
Even though Dean was still learning the guy, he knew enough to recognize the tightness in his voice and take a perverse pride in it. It wasn’t anything Junior should’ve been able to pick out, nothing that put them in any danger, but it was the first sign of anything affecting Novak. Even Dean busting a nut in his lap hadn’t wrenched a hint of emotion from him, so Dean figured he was owed that.
using as the base of allegations. And he’s a damn fine mechanic. In fact, an auto shop might be too basic for him. Can you wave your magic wand or something?”
“You’re the guide, right?” he asked Dean. At Dean’s nod, his shoulders dropped a few inches in relief. “Our officers were involved in an incident, one of them—she’s a sentinel, she got her partner’s blood on her hands and she’s not… We don’t have any guides, we can’t help her.”
The yogic routine he had to perform every time he wanted a snack? Rowena’s fault. That incident where Dean almost starred in live-action tentacle porn? Rowena’s fault. His newly conditioned response of terror at the sound of chimes? Rowena’s fault. His blatant disrespect of Castiel’s boundaries? That was all on Dean, but Rowena definitely had a hand in it. That gooey-eyed expression on his little brother’s face? Yep, that was all Rowena.
Even with the stakes so low, it looked like it took everything Cas had to look Dean in the eye and ask, “How?”
Linda Tran stood in the doorway of her son’s room, arms crossed and expression far more disapproving than either of theirs. Sheepish, Dean backed away first. He wasn’t done having it out with Cas, but it wasn’t the place. He did note the fact that Cas seemed just as startled as he was by her appearance, though; with his enhanced hearing, he should’ve been aware of her coming long before she got there. That he hadn’t meant he was too focused on Dean, and that kind of focus was dangerous for a sentinel. That was what led to zones, and whether Cas thought he was above them or not, evidence pointed to him being vulnerable.
Novak’s arched eyebrow did things to Dean that made him more grateful than ever to be wearing sturdy jeans instead of his usual, flimsier dress pants. He was really going to have to do something about his reactions, and fast. He couldn’t work when every move Novak made got him flustered. He could barely think. He had to get it together.
Kevin started to explain. “So, you know how sentinel and guide traits aren’t hereditary? And people have been trying to track down where they come from since before gene sequencing? Well, someone did figure it out, and the only thing worse than what they’re planning to do with it is how they proved themselves right.”
“Had that converted as soon as I bought the place,” Junior bragged. “Can you believe the idiots who used to own it were still fucking around with wood? Maybe they were just too old to know better, but that’s still almost too dumb to excuse. No one wants to deal with that mess.”
“Can you get arrested for lying to alien royalty?” Cas murmured, pulling out to wet his fingers again.
“In case of emergency,” he’d claimed, but they all knew it was because Bela wouldn’t be caught dead without her phone.
See, this is why you don’t give your crew time before rendezvous . . . they start filling it up with meaningless shit that inevitably makes them late. Still, he had to admit he felt more human after a blink-and-you-miss-it shower and a round with the mouthwash.
Because the next time he tinkered around and rebooted the whole system, the lights came on at full power. And they brought water, spatial scanning and ASTERIA with them. No lags, no spasms.
If Dean didn’t get his fucking libido under control—well, he’d already shown he couldn’t. But if he couldn’t suppress it, at least he could channel his sexual frustration into something else. Like using it to back up his non-sexual frustration.
“We wayward kids gotta look after one another,” he winked, heaving himself off his perch. Turned to head back down the hallway. “Yo, Samantha! You done choking the chicken?”
“Don’t be daft, boyo,” Rowena had said. Charlie had expanded, “That’s residue. Stardust, you might say. It certainly explains why they were never discovered. The whole galaxy has been engulfed in this.”
“Couldn’t have fucking mentioned before now?” It was barely a real complaint, though; Dean understood, and more than that he had bigger fucking problems to deal with. “Do we have time to get the fuck out of here and pray Junior never sees us on the street?”
Which meant Dean’s job was going to suck. He turned his own glare on their supervisor. “This is what you meant by throwing me in,” he accused. “You’re not testing me against your cases, you’re testing me against him when he’s spun up.”
It wasn’t like he actually believed that listening in on the Outfit’s phone calls was real police work. No one did, with the notable exception of Novak. And he definitely didn’t think it would bring about any real results: the mob had people in the courts, on the force, with the phone company. They had to know they were bugged, so why would they ever say anything incriminating on tape?
“Are you here to play, too?” he asked. It drew some attention from the crowd, but only some, what with the main event still going strong just a few feet from them.
Turner flipped a switch on the machine and sound started coming out of a speaker for all of them to hear. Later on, Dean planned to get really fucking annoyed about the fact that they could have been doing that the entire time instead of playing keep-away with the headphones like a bunch of children. But for the time being, he focused in on the first bugged conversation he was allowed to listen in on.
“We’ve established that I do, yes,” the man rolled his eyes. “My hands may be steady as a leaf in the wind, but I still got the same mind. Besides, it’d be nice to have money and not blow it on destroying my body.”
At seventeen, Dean had walked in on Bobby during a phone call with what one may characterize as a ‘last resort (and leave it at that)’. He’d dropped out the next day, getting a refund that would make sure Sammy was named valedictorian at his high school graduation.
For as long as he lived, Dean would be haunted by Sam’s vacant stare and the thin trickles of blood dripping from his eyes, his ears, his mouth and nose. And right there on the inside of his elbow, still linked in when Dean found him, was the exact same port as Cas had hidden beneath seemingly innocuous skin. It was Dean’s greatest failure, as a guide and as a brother. He’d let Sammy die.
Fingers dug in under the cover of Dean’s hand, pointed and painful as Novak’s mouth thinned in silent rebuke. Silence. Fucking fine. Smiling sweetly, Dean squeezed Novak’s hand four times instead.
Dean blinked in surprise before he remembered . . . yeah. Fucking intergalactic travel. He was going to take a goddamn nap. “So, if y’all wanna take a nap, I’ll wake you in two hours.”
All of a sudden, Sam closed off like he was shy. Embarrassed, maybe. “I dunno, they probably get a bunch of kids from actual farms who know a lot more than I do. And it might conflict with mock trial.”
The truth seemed to hit Cas just as hard as it had Dean. “I’m trying to keep those I have left safe,” he hissed. An insistent arm wrapped around Dean’s, forcefully spinning him around.
And that left Dean, hunched over in the mess with Sam and Rowena, leg bouncing uncontrollably. Cas had been adamant about having Dean as his second. Even though Sam had
Direct neural connections to the cyberscape had been cutting edge tech seven or so years before, the exciting next step toward full immersion: people could skip all the other equipment and the link would receive commands straight from their brain. It would feed responses back the same way, sending cyberscape data right into processing centers so the person saw and heard and felt things like they were real.
“Sorry,” he says, “I—sorry,” then he’s stepping around Cas. Whether it’s discomfort over his sexuality or somewhere he actually has to be, he’s definitely in a rush as he moves away from them.
He looked at Dean like he was something fascinating. Something worthwhile, and though Dean had told himself again and again that he didn’t care about his recalcitrant partner’s opinion of him, it nevertheless made a tiny bubble of pride and gratification float up his chest. Proving his worth to the guy who called him a glorified babysitter, the guy who accused him of being not enough; it wasn’t enough of a victory to make up for the other shit Cas said, but it still felt good.
Cas actually looked surprised at that, looking down at himself, "Thanks. I think the kids meant it as a gag gift. Joke's on them; I wear it all the time."
“Her block’s on the highway,” Ash cut in. “Road’ll take us right there, we just need to get through the gate.”
“Why are you here?” he concluded, then jerked his head between them again and added, “How are you here?”
Dean’s field of vision was filled by the side of Novak’s face, so he had a good view of the muscles in his jaw tensing and shifting for several seconds before any words came out.
Cas considered the question, which was clearly not a question that should have required any consideration. “Technically,” he said, “yes. But it was very minor, nothing to concern yourself with.”
“Sam, stop torturing your brother and set up the Wave-Linker to any Oziomei incoming signals.” Dean sagged in relief at Cas’s sharp command. Sam slunk off, mumbling bitterly under his breath. A cool hand pressed against his forehead and he leaned into it with a grateful moan. He had no strength to be embarrassed about how clammy his face was or how utterly pitiful that sound was.
He glares at her as an announcement comes over the speakers. He can’t understand it, between the roaring of the crowd and the thick accent and the fact that he’s only even sure a third of the things being said are real words, but Meg says, “Here we go,” like it meant something.
“Hey,” he hushed, cupping Cas’s face between his palms. “There’s still a few blocks to search, okay? But we gotta keep moving. Don’t lose your nerve right now.”
He was just recalibrating the boosters when Sam slipped into the control room. “I don’t wanna hear it,” he mumbled quietly.
“Are you really gonna give her the play-by-play later?” Cas panted, popping his fingers into his mouth and then reaching under Dean.
It was the man with the headphones who answered, “And you found it. Good work, they oughta make you a detective.”
like there’s no other name that could contain the multitudes encompassed by it. Cas says his name the same way he always has, and it sets his world spinning faster every time.
in public when he’s looking to cause trouble. Someone looks at them sideways, grimaces when they sit too close, and he raises his voice and widens his smile and lays it on thick as he can without laughing too hard and giving the game away.
“Yeah, well, I’m concerned.” Dean stood and closed in on Cas, their faces inches away as he leaned in to inspect the damage. It wasn’t until Cas’s breath caught that he realized just how intimate it was, and how the last time he’d been so close he’d ended with punching Cas. He didn’t want to punch Cas now. He wanted—
“It doesn’t taste like ass because I’m amazing, but I’m gonna need your help shaving his eyebrows the day before school starts.”
Cas turned back to the picture, smile freezing on his features. “Jack loves the outdoors. I promised him we’d go once I got over my trauma.”
More fight was on the tip of Dean’s tongue, almost out before he processed that Novak’s words didn’t match his face and he was, however resentfully, giving Dean what he wanted. Then it hit him that Novak didn’t just know what the Eagle was, he was familiar enough to judge how crowded it would be on a particular night. Better and better. Asking if there was a risk he’d be recognized was probably worth more than Dean’s life just then—especially since there was no way the question wouldn’t be turned around on him.
The man in question stared at him, eyebrows scrunched up mournfully. Then he turned to Sam with a sincere smile, “I am. Hi, Sam.”
Still, he didn’t end up going anywhere else, because he had a job to do regardless of his annoyance. The fact was that Cas’s welfare was actually kind of his problem, since he’d been partnered with him as a guide specifically. Even more than that, Kevin Tran’s welfare was his problem, and going for an hour-long spite breakfast wouldn’t do anything to find the missing kid. So he kept his exploration to the main floor of the hotel, hoping he could at least get some caffeine in him before having to deal with his partner’s bullshit again.
This morning, he went through the motions like a robot, same as every single day. He woke up (with a headache as usual), sighed (remembering his entire life), sat up (in pain, no idea why), stood up (wobbling from side to side, still a bit drunk) and got dressed (in yesterday’s clothes), but something felt off when he passed in front of the mirror. He fiddled with his face, trying to figure out what his subconscious was identifying as ‘abnormal’. His gut told him to raise his t-shirt’s left sleeve up a bit, where he found his shoulder…
Perhaps a small break wouldn’t hurt; Sam is with Dean (who, by the way, has been contentedly snoring since Cas’ imaginary church bells rung midnight), and it’s not exactly as if he has any real use here. Sam is much more well-equipped to deal with mortal flesh’s wounds (or rather, “much more well-equipped” in the event his

was the one to reassure you for over three hours, time and time again.” Cas refutes, and Dean’s smirk slowly turns into an embarrassed scowl as the angel goes on. “Correct me if I’m wrong, but repeating ‘

This might be emotional manipulation but, it’s for a good cause. Dean may be an excellent driver, but Sam wouldn’t particularly enjoy getting into a crash, so this is just a preventative measure. Besides, with Jack not always sleeping full nights (he gets nightmares) Dean is sometimes up at ungodly (isn’t that an ironic way to phrase it) hours of the night consoling the screeching child. Nephilim. Deity. Embodiment of the creator of this universe’s (and so many others) power. Yeah no,
them anymore! Jesus. You’d think they taught this in Angel Sunday School. He decides to wait until Cas is finished before chiming in with his…
“Ok, ok, fine. Mamabear.” She agrees, rolling her eyes. “I’ll even text you a picture every 2 hours, if you want.” She adds with a chuckle. Which means she was probably joking. This is inconvenient, because Dean was about to ask her to do just that. If possible, every 40 minutes, actually. “Oh God. You do??” She gasps, her eyes widening with humor.
They’re in the Impala, there’s no purple smoke anywhere to be seen, they’re on the highway to… Right, Twin Falls. There’s no smoke and there’s no danger, just miles of road stretching all around them. Okay. Onto breathing now.
for it.” Cas’ voice is sharper than usual, each word, masterfully aimed, almost physically stung him.
Everything. Hurts. It feels like every single wound he’s ever gotten in the last four decades just magically reappeared and most importantly, re-
For clarification, the way I think about Cas' wings is that they can touch, but can't be touched. So, he can make snow angels with them, but people can't go 'round picking the feathers apart directly on his shoulders. Nor can they see them. But the imprint left by the wings is like the burnt one humans can see on the ground when an angel dies. Same vibe, softer tone.
“Look, I don’t know either, Cas. Kid was obviously high as a goddamn kite. Maybe he read between some nonexistent lines.”
Whew! This was a difficult one. Both in terms of content, and writing style; this was a bit of an experiment. I didn't really know how I was going to make Dean's mind all messy, from his own perspective. I sort of figured it out by just... Jumping into it, and trying what felt best, deleting what felt wrong... A lot like a scientist, I worked by trial and error, until I finally got a chemical substance I was happy enough with.
’. And that’s enough for Dean’s fear (see, irrational, gone as fast as it came) to wither away. It’ll be back, though; Dean knows that from experience. If he doesn’t check up on Jack to watch him breathe within the next 20 minutes, the panic will set in again. It’s inconvenient, really. Specifically when he’s out on a hunt.
His brother is fast asleep not even five minutes later, but then again, that’s not really out of character for him. Sam doesn’t even try to launch a conversation with Cas, the angel is too focused on the all-too-important task of watching Dean sleep.
Before he can keep on asking himself more questions about diner food and their habits (so he can avoid having to ask the bigger one), Cas gets
invite a demon into the mix. Chuck may be gone but their day-to-day hassle really hasn’t changed much. As in, shit always hits the fan when they expect it least. Or it hits it stronger than they thought it would. Basically, everything still goes wrong, regardless of the God-switch.
It’s settled. If Dean doesn’t provide a good enough answer when Cas asks him why he seems to be breaking apart at every seam, the ‘
Dean had had the chance to experience a settled life until he was 4 years old, Sam hadn’t. He was always a bit jealous of the other kids at school who still had both of their parents, a house, a room of their own, habits and rituals. Effectively, the only rituals Sam had ever known were salting the windows and doors, checking the holy water under his bed and placing his knife under his pillow or on his bedside table at night.
Linda checked the clock display. “She should already be there and will be waiting for another three hours.”
He didn’t run over, even though he wanted to, because that seemed excessive. But when she wrapped an arm around him, he hugged back as hard as he could, even though his bag and backpack made it very inconvenient to do so. She seemed a bit taken aback, but laughed gently and hugged him back, just as hard, even though his bag and backpack made it even more inconvenient for her.
“Stop listening,” he instructed gently. Tentatively, he extended his own senses into Cas’s. To his incredible relief it worked; Pamela hadn’t been wrong about her tech’s capabilities. “Make yourself stop hearing everything but my voice here, okay?”
He ignored Dean’s spluttering inquiries and tugged him into the mess. Sam was holding onto the arms of his seat, emo-boy bangs levitating off his face. Foxtrot was blocking the way to the control room, much to the chagrin of the rest of the assembled crew. They were shouting at her to move, but she seemed determined to do . . . whatever it was she was trying. Hijack?
Fortunately, he didn’t have long to worry about it before they were both pointed at Lassen cabin. Even though it wasn’t going to be a problem, he still thought it was perfectly reasonable to kick Balthazar lightly in the leg and ask, “What was your plan if we didn’t get the same cabin, assbutt?”
Dean took half a step in his direction, biting his tongue on asking for an introduction. It would only be fair, since the man clearly knew who he was, but he knew as well as anyone that life wasn’t fair. His line of work, his experience, maybe he knew that better than most—and he also knew not to expect basic courtesy from sentinels most of the time. There were always exceptions, of course, but they tended to be a standoffish bunch. Maybe it was because their brains were too busy processing all the additional sensory input to have any room for feelings.
Uncharacteristic steel invaded the warm gaze. “Where then?” He turned to head to his car. And then back home.
“Wait,” Sam piped, voice still pretty weak. He still looked borderline malnourished, which was saying a lot, because the kid used to be packed with muscles Dean couldn’t even
Novak looked like a wet dream in a sleek motorcycle jacket and a perfectly positioned Muir cap. Oiled leather pants wrapped his legs, his thighs—damn, he’d been hiding those under his loose trousers. They clung to his crotch, so obscene that the outline of his dick pressed out into the leather like a sculpture; Dean’s mouth dried and watered at the same time, an instinctive response that had nothing to do with Novak himself and everything to do with magazines Dean had been jerking off to since he was a teenager.
“Hi,” he managed to squeak. He cleared his throat. “Hi. Cas.” As an afterthought, he added, “-tiel.”
“Hey, no,” Sam said gently. Claire looked heartbroken. He gingerly slid over to Kaia, one arm resting on her scrawny knee. “Not your fault, okay? You’re not the monster who stole people away from their homes, okay?”
But D.C. prided itself on being clean and safe: no weapons, no gangs, no drugs. The Enforcement side of NEI went to great lengths to keep it that way—aggressively scanning every plane, car, bus, person, and package that entered the city; firewalls and alarms on matter printers that tried to produce anything questionable; no-knock warrants for raids on “randomly selected” residences that only ever hit the few remaining non-governmental housing blocks.
“Wait,” Dean made a slicing motion in the air. He glanced at Cas, “So these people, they’ve been smuggling people from, like, everywhere to what . . . sell them as slaves?”
Sam made a sympathetic face and patted him on the back as Cas demurely sipped his drink. Dean was positive he’d seen the beginnings of a smirk. Cas turned to face the brothers, eyes catching on Dean’s, “I’ll need a ship, Sam.”
Making nice had to wait because Dean didn’t have the patience, especially not with someone who looked like he’d rather be scraping crimson addicts off the street than shuttling Dean around. If Michigan even had crimson addicts and didn’t just forcibly relocate them all to Ohio like the rest of the wealthier states did.
Back at his own desk, he dug around in a drawer until he found a pocket-sized notepad. A quick flip through showed that his notes only filed a few pages, and not with anything important—a lead from a two-year-old case that hadn’t turned out to be anything useful anyway. He tore those out, tossed them in the general direction of the small trash bin next to him, and started scratching out half-formed notes to himself. What he knew about the Stynes, what he knew about his teammates, what else he could find out about both to help him actually get started on something useful.
Then he said, “Dean,” a frustrated growl that got Dean’s dick to pay attention and also Dean himself to pay attention. So he heard it when Novak repeated, “He’s here.”
,’ as an urban queer, he’s not instantly filled with a sense of safety and comfort. But Meg berated him for buying into stereotypes and believing his baseless fears instead of her actual experience, and she wasn’t wrong, so here they are.
He tried to think of an excuse, but they all sounded contrived even in his head. Anyway, she’d already provided him with one, and Balthazar, experienced liar that he was, had warned him about getting too elaborate. “If it’s not something you need to say,” he’d said, hands melodramatically wobbling Cas’s head by the cheeks, “then don’t fucking say it. Right?”
So . . . yeah. There was a reason why she was literally hiding in a cramped closet in Kaia’s temporary apartment.
She knocked on the cap at the head of the tub that had a collection of wires and gauges and digital readouts protruding from it. “Realtime brain scan. I’ve put together the most comprehensive bio- and neurofeedback system the world has ever seen in this baby, and it’s even calibrated for sentinel senses. Whatever level of perception you can handle, it’ll give you. Enhanced senses in the virtual world.”
Chuck does his best but we all know there’s only about a 50/50 chance that he would notice if Cas switched places with a 6ft 30yo named Bubba
As if reading his mind, Cas gently traced the edges of the raised scars at his waist. They didn’t hurt anymore. Just like the faint white line down the side of his husband’s face. He had a feeling his own marks weren’t going to fade away like Cas’s eventually would. But then again, his own night terrors had faded into the occasional nightmare. Cas still woke up every other night, slipped out of bed, and sat cross-legged before the medicine cabinet until someone eventually found him as dawn broke through.
Despite returning the friendliness of Dean’s greeting, he didn’t take the offered hand. He didn’t look at it, either, but Dean was sure those observant, augmented eyes of his hadn’t missed it. Even while they were fixed on Dean, the aperture kept shifting size and the quality of the light in them kept changing just enough to suggest movement. It made Dean uncomfortable to see, sent a little shiver up his spine at how unusual and unnatural Castiel’s gaze was, but he didn’t know how to look away when they were staring at him so determinedly.
As momentarily satisfying as that spiteful conviction was, he found himself reconsidering it when it seemed like Balthazar was taking a lot longer to find him than expected. Almost everyone was already seated—Cas had had to awkwardly turn a few people away from the empty chair beside him—and the first platters of bread and giant bowls of salad were arriving at the tables, but still no sign of Balthazar. He didn’t even see his friend’s head wandering around the tables looking for him.
Novak’s hands left him with the command. Dean hadn’t realized how much he was leaning into the other man until the support was gone and he stumbled, but he caught himself quickly and obeyed. He grabbed one of the discarded chairs from the gang bang table, which had cleared out sometime since the last time he looked over, probably when they were arguing about their next steps or talking to Junior. The chair went down in front of Novak, turned so they’d be facing Junior when Novak sat down, and Dean stood to the side and waited.
But given the way Novak had angled himself away from Dean, his full attention on Junior without even the slightest bit of interest in the fact that Dean was still there, it seemed like it was probably the first option: Ignoring Dean and pretending that would make him go away.
Dad sighed. “Yeah, okay. I don’t see you fretting about her leaving you at the altar. So . . . make sure she doesn’t have bags under her eyes?” Then, quieter, “I’ll go make sure my husband doesn’t kill the caterer over the placemats. I swear he wasn’t even this stressed about
Guilt ripped through him. In wanting to experience Jimmy’s family life for himself, he’d destroyed it. “I’m sorry.”
“I’ve never wanted to kiss him before. That’s sick, right? He’s my brother. But the last couple days—I almost did, just now. I think he’s really upset. And why shouldn’t he be?”
It was brief and chaste. But it got the intent across, loud and clear. Like two pieces slotting together perfectly. Dean cupped Cas’s head to hold him in place, twisting to deepen the kiss. Cas’s lips parted in a gasp.
“Sammy’s having a last-minute crisis with his present, but we didn’t want these getting cold,” Dean explained. The line of his mouth was closer to a smile than a frown, but it had a tentative, shy quality to it, like he wasn’t sure of his welcome. Cas knew that feeling all too well, and hated being the reason Dean had to feel it.
Dean chewed his lip, stared between the three, and found he had no idea where to start. “Spindles? Purgatory? The desk?”
The hallway was short and had a chain-link gate at the far end, intact but propped open; the large rock holding the bottom of the gate in place proclaimed, in large red letters, that it was the “EMERGENCY ROCK.” And past that, he found what had to be his new home.
It was a dumb, childish question that he regretted immediately, but it got the job done: Dean looked slightly less ready to throw the plate into his lap and flee at any moment.
The voice was male and unmistakably British. Maybe even human, which was to their advantage. They had a Charlie. But then the Brit laughed unpleasantly. “Then why are you holding onto that gun like it’s a lifeline? And what are you,” his voice drifted closer and Dean recalibrated, “dear lady, doing with
He dropped his cheek onto Cas’s shoulder, closed his eyes, and let himself feel every point of contact, every line where the warmth of Cas’s skin was interrupted by a thin plastic tube, every wrinkle of his own clothing creasing into his flesh. Then he let himself feel more.
The only thing that keeps him upright is the arm that wraps around his waist from the side and holds steady, even when his surprise makes him over-correct and stumble in the opposite direction. He’s pressed back against a firm chest just long enough for him to regain his footing, then he’s released and the heat of the other body moves away.
Dean didn’t have the energy to bristle at that. It was a meditation technique, it was to abate a panic attack . . . ‘tomayto, tomahto’. He counted.
The other fork of the hallway looked more promising once he rounded the turn, though not any less bleak in appearance. The first door, just around the corner, announced the location of the stairs. The second was marked ‘Evidence,’ which threw him since the evidence desk and all the storage he’d ever seen was on the second floor. If they had other spaces for it, he felt like he would’ve known and been to them by that point.
Sam, after meeting them at the door, proceeded to immediately jump on Cas and engulf him in a bearhug. Dean smirked at the wide-eyed look the smaller man sported.
“Time-honored tradition on this side of the lake,” Balthazar declared. “No one’s ever died or gotten pregnant, so I don’t think they really care what we get up to.”
Dean grumbled under his breath. Cas sighed deeply, twisting and turning till he escaped Dean’s hold. He hopped from foot to foot as he pulled on his pants, “Just tell me neither of you went near the kitchen.”
attempting. He switched the subject, “She does look like a woman who’d fight off a bear with nothing but a pair of hot skewers.”
And so Dean ended up in a vat of cool goo, display lenses inside his eyelids and tiny buds in his ears and less clothing on his body than he otherwise would’ve been willing to strip down to in front of his still-new colleagues. That didn’t matter, next to Cas.
Dean stared up at the undercarriage. She was a fine lady, yeah, but damn if she wasn’t a testy bitch. ’64 Cobra, lively as the day she was born, with a little help from Dean. Not much older than his own Baby. He sighed again, “No, you won’t.”
The brothers managed to maintain a respectful walking speed as they made their way to the mess, but the moment they were inside, Sam started bouncing on his heels like he had to go pee-pee.
“Nobody leaves until everyone is here,” Garth continued. “Each week, two cabins are assigned kitchen cleanup, so on our week we’ll still meet up here, but then we’re gonna stay behind to get everything squared away. For us that’s next week, so we’ll talk more about the details then. Any questions yet? All right, I’m sure you’re all hungry. Go on ahead and find a seat, food will be brought out when everyone’s mostly seated. It’s all just big serving dishes, so take what you want—but not more than you’ll eat, please! Serve yourself and pass it down.”
Searching the house without looking like they were searching the house meant Dean cooing at a lot of things he really didn’t give two shits about while Novak followed him around like an indulgent husband. Awkward as all fuck, but it got the job done well enough that after an hour, Dean felt confident there were no cameras or dead bodies stashed anywhere. He was less sure about bugs, the listening device kind, so he dragged Novak—literally pulled him—back upstairs into their new bedroom. He set the radio to some overly loud mood music, started the shower, and ignored Novak's rolling eyes.
. Cas was curled forward, elbows on his knees, looking extremely bored. Whatever Jack was babbling about didn’t seem to be helping.
“You know how I found them?” he choked, lips turning blue. “Led us . . . right toꟷ” the sentence was never finished, on account of Cas prying his jaw open. Ketch seemed too weak to realize his other arm was free as Cas moved to grab a discarded shotgun. Kaia, who
Riding back on the bus without Balthazar did nothing to help Cas’s nerves, especially since he wasn’t actually riding ‘back’. He was going the opposite direction, away from his home and toward Jimmy’s home. Jimmy’s family. He wished he could talk to Balthazar, wished even more that he could talk to Jimmy, but he and Jimmy had both left their phones at home since the camp didn’t allow them. He’d have to wait until he got to Jimmy’s house and Jimmy got to his house, then use Jimmy’s phone to text his own. Balthazar had promised to set up a group chat for the three of them to be ready for the other two, since he was the only one who had his phone hidden away in his luggage.
“Generous nothing, you’re gonna work for it. I just make sure to take good care of the people who work for me. And I had the house already, it’s not a big deal. Saves me the trouble of selling it, and I’m sure Jimmy here can figure out a way for it to come off my taxes. Right?”
The officer wasn’t such a hard case, fortunately. Her zone was only partial, she was still stuck in reality. Dean was able to pull her down with minimal intervention, dialing back her senses for her until she could think enough to do it herself. She still looked dazed when she was taken away for medical treatment and a lot of cleaning; Dean felt the same.
“I won’” the toddler agrees, nodding sternly, then goes right back to laughing while wiggling out of the covers, and jumps into Cas’ arms.

miss them, but this painful reminder shows him he’d forgotten in what other ways he was lucky they were gone.
He’s not being swallowed by an ocean of starless nights, he’s just an idiot. Good to know. He blinks a couple times, wincing once more at the room’s ambient brightness, then breathes a sigh of relief when his eyes find a pair of deep, light blue ones. He knows these as well.
He rolled over that disturbing, moderately alarming jibe. “My little brother works at NASA. Law or ethics or some shit. Got a silver tongue, that kid,” he promised, a slight skip in his step as they made their way to Bobby’s for some artery-clogging grub.
Starting with: “There’s no fucking way you carried me up those stairs.” So not technically a question, but it still demanded an answer.
Dean stared at the man in utter disbelief. “I’m sorry, I’m having a hard time getting this.” He stepped up and poked Cas in the chest. Hard. (Oh, nostalgia.) “Because it sounds an awful lot like you think I owe you for rescuing Sam. A member of your crew, who you swore to protect.”
It’s called getting hung up, it can be dangerous but he just needs to stay calm and get his glove out and at this level he’ll know that, he’ll have done it before. There are people to help, the bullfighters in their padding who move in to distract and steady the bull while the rider works himself free. All this is happening as Dean talks Cas through it, and it’s only a few heart-stopping seconds before the rider pulls his hand clear and moves out of range of the flailing hooves.
“Water is rationed right now, but Sam’s confident we can get it running in two days. ASTERIA might lag a little.”
Cas kept closing his eyes and shying away every time Dean’s hand brushed one of his oil or coolant tubes, pressing his back against the mattress even though it must have been uncomfortable for his wings.
An irresponsible omission, in Cas’s opinion. If he’d known to brace for it, maybe Jody wouldn’t have caught him staring for so long that she asked, “Is everything okay, Jimmy?”
“That’s good, because while I have the texts to prove that Jimmy is very much not attracted to you, I would hate to have to use them.”
Shaking his head, screaming in effort, pulled. After an eternity, the wind disappeared. He fell forward with a gasp, knees hitting something hard. His torso screamed in pain. His head knocked into the helmet painfully. Consciousness was overrated anyway.
He’d tried to go back to work, after being met with an empty house where Castiel’s family was supposed to be. Guilt pooled in his feet, like lead, deciding it would stay awhile. The morning of his reinstatement, they’d refused to carry him through the threshold.
Unable to bear it any longer, Dean cut his eyes away to the clock radio, which was still spouting a reassuring pair of male and female voices talking through the news of the morning. “The house is clean. You’re up early for staying out all night. Heading in to the office already?”
“Easy there, friend,” Ketch laughed. “My boss just fancies a chat. What with your recent . . . dealings, I’d say that’s perfectly fair.” The skimming drugs thing? The exposé? Yeah, he’d bet his ass the ‘chat’ was going to involve a lot of physical exertion.
“Ew,” he made that face like when Dad had tried to make broccoli crust pizza. “I don’t want to hear about that.”
“The abstinence thing that made me wait so damn long to do this, you dumbfuck,” he growled, slipping a hand inside and wrapping a firm hand around Cas, jerking him rapidly.
Smug, Dean went back to his work and didn’t check in on Novak again. If he was bothered by Dean’s sudden and unexplained activity, then he was getting exactly what he deserved. A taste of his own medicine. It was his own fault, since he’d have no reason to be nervous if not for his stupid suspicions about Dean being dirty.
With a grateful smile, Cas readjusted the balance of his backpack and duffel bag and joined the herd of older teenagers tromping into the forest. The excitement of everyone around them helped his mood further; people chatted happily, squealed as they reconnected with old friends, and sang vaguely obscene rhymes loudly and in several different keys. One person running up and down the trail to greet their friends even paused to smack Cas in the shoulder and say, “Good to see you, dude!” before jogging back toward the buses.
In hindsight, the warning might have something to do with the unsatisfactory results. (What sort of yarn didn’t burn? Did the Oziomei end up supplying Thor yarn to Cas? Was Thor yarn a real thing?)
They separate after it’s barely begun, just far enough that he can see Cas staring, mouth open, eyes so blue he’d swear there was still grace behind them. Breathing raggedly, shaking to the very core of him, he stares back. Between one heartbeat and another, Cas’s lashes sweep down and up; his voice cracks even though it’s just a whisper when he says, “Dean.”
Dean turned to face the kid with the fiercest scowl he could muster. “You’ve been training to go back on missions?” He just got that stubborn expression Sam reserved to defend the bull-headed stunts he pulled. “Wow, Sammy. Thanks for keeping me in the loop.”
“Get that a lot, do you?” Dean asked drily, taken aback but also amused by the strength of Novak’s words.
Picking the desk that seemed the least cluttered, he even found a mostly clear corner of it where he could set his box down. But it was a precarious place to leave it, because it really was just a corner; the desk was more occupied than Dean had thought at first. He just had no idea what it was occupied by.
Then he slipped the conduit into the port at the side of his glasses. The connection flashed through the glasses and down to the motion bands; he saw darkness for a moment, then graphics that were all but indistinguishable from reality faded in. He only had a second to feel smug about it—he’d been right, Cas had been wrong, and he was standing in Kevin Tran’s server to prove it—before Cas appeared next to him.
“Jimmy, baby.” Playing to his cover made it easy to layer vinegar and honey on the words in equal measure. “We just moved to a new place. I don’t know where anything is, I can’t call you at the office because I don’t know that number either, I don’t even know any of the neighbors! If something happens, I need to know where you are.”
He did know Novak. They weren’t at The Eagle. They were in the basement of the Chicago PD and they weren’t alone and Dean had been staring for way, way too long.
They couldn’t necessarily lie about going back, but none of them from Alpha to Echo had rehearsed their story. With too many conflicting versions, HQ had gone to Cas. Cas had told them the crew was protecting him. That he’d made the choice to return to retrieve Sam, all on his own.
“Sorry, got a plane to catch. Rain check?” Dean interrupted, fist gripping the blade at his back, still deactivated.
Caught up in how much he amused himself again, Junior missed the look Dean and Novak exchanged. They weren’t just moving into a mob house as the new pets of an impulsive murderer, they were about to occupy what was effectively a dead man’s house. The last pet’s.
The kid shrugged helplessly, “Okay, there’s literally no way to trace whatever ESP Cas is blasting into space, but I ran a couple of tests on like, all samples. Just need to get a couple more done.”
Instantly, Cas went limp, dropped his food, and fell out of his chair. He slumped into Dean on the way down, nearly taking him to the floor too—there was a lot of weight in all his mods, everything that had been put into him and onto him to sculpt him into RomaNovaCorp’s vision of perfection. But Dean managed to jerk himself clear and stay upright, which meant he had a perfect view of Cas as he crashed to the ground. Landing heavily on his side, Cas didn’t react to the fall. It was gravity and the weight of his wings that pulled him onto his back, not his own movement.
Dean wasn’t always the most patient guy, and just then it seemed especially like everyone was going out of their way to make things take too long for him to be happy. The phone rang three times before it was picked up.
Which was never going to happen, and it was pretty pathetic of him to be thinking about that with where he was and what he was doing.
“Couldn’t.” Dean grinned, a lopsided smirk of triumph at the memory of Adler’s purple face. “I made the arrest as he was coming out of what I later learned”—he’d known all along, of course he had—“was one of her fundraising dinners. Couple upstanding journalists who were there to cover the event happened to overhear the charges, so the story blew up before he could kill it.”
“Is Sammy here yet?” he mumbled quietly. He didn’t want to disrupt the almost sacrosanct swashing symphony of the sea.
They’re great, I’m really glad I’m getting a chance to meet them like this, but I definitely wasn’t prepared
He was realizing Cas didn’t care for people beyond him and his. Dean and Sam didn’t register on that radar, despite what he used to believe. Suddenly hit by the breakthrough, he choked out, "You would’ve done the
The downside was that it was lined with bars, leading to little dirty cells. The upside was that most of them were empty. The caveat, though . . .
“Yeah, definitely. He’s been doing real good today, I knew he was a smart one. And you know, you’re right. I oughta show him how I appreciate it. Tell you what, pretty boy. I’m gonna head back to the office and tell Jimmy he can take the rest of the day off to get home and take care of you. But you still make that nice dinner you were planning, after he’s done doing that, and I’ll bring over a couple buddies so we can throw you a proper housewarming. How’s that sound?”
Further away, at the desks still littered with the remnants of the burgers that had started the whole thing, Charlie and Ash were buried in CS equipment and each apparently doing twelve things at once, by the way their fingers jumped around. They spoke to each other so quickly that Dean didn’t even try to make sense of the half of the words he understood.
,” Rowena dropped her voice a few octaves, shooting Cas a sultry look. Dean laughed shamelessly, unable to decide whose face looked better – Sam’s or Cas’s.
