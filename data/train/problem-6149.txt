Steve just nodded and blushed a little brighter.  He made no protest when Tony paid, gathered their left-overs, and headed for the door.  Walking back to the car, Tony kinda wanted to hold Steve’s hand like a silly teenager, but Steve’s hands were in his pockets again and now Tony had a feeling he knew why.
Thank you all so very much for your encouragement, support, advice, and offers of help getting this chapter posted and formatted.  Thanks in particular to PollyQ, ds862, inkstainedcoffeeaddict, luminare_ardua.  Y’all are amazing.  And, three cheers for my amazing friend, Rex Luscus, who made actual post-its for this chapter, something which is far beyond my skill set.
1) Avengers’ training (“That’s great, Iron Man! Okay, let’s practice those lifts again. Widow, get into position.”)
“Well done, team,” Rogers said beaming around the gym at them.  Tony flipped the faceplate up and grinned. He hadn’t had this much fun in . . . well, he actually couldn’t remember the last time he’d had this much fun.  (Especially such
, that Steve felt hysterical laughter bubbling up inside him.  Tony had so clearly expected him to lie and now had no idea what to say.
Tony shrugged and added in a lighter tone, one that didn’t fool Natasha and probably didn’t fool himself either: “But that’s fine. I’m hardly in the position to be getting into anything long term anyway.”
(Don’t kneel platonically with other Doms or Switches. Alone. When their Dominant isn’t around.  And doesn’t know about it...)
“I haven’t forgotten,” Cap said, the beginnings of his Stubborn Look creeping over his face, “but that’s no reason to always stick you with the bill. I have a job. I’m not some. . . some--”
“I don’t think of you as an early riser, Stark,” she said with an amused smirk. “Steve rubbing off on you?”
“You’re always good for me,” Steve said softly. He shifted his fingers around inside Tony’s hot channel, spreading, questing . . .
The service concluded with a joyous riot of sound, as choir, organ, and congregation sounded “Joy to the World” in tones triumphant.  The church bells pealed as everyone bundled up once more in their winter clothes, wishing one another a very merry Christmas.  Steve shook hands with John and Cynthia, then turned his steps towards Stark Tower.
“Let’s eat!” Steve said, and together they started serving the food. And, now that the team knew, Tony had no trouble at all coming close. He laid a hand on Steve’s arm and tilted his head, demanding; Steve obliged, dropping a little kiss on his cheek. Tony felt a thrill. It was hardly high-level exhibitionism, but the team could see them and that made him feel good.
Steve had started drawing again. (It was something to do. Something, it turned out, he actually still liked in this brave new world.) And he was trying to pick up calligraphy.
“Mmm,” Steve let out a little murmur and the sound of it went straight to Tony’s gut, hot and sharp. He rubbed his face against Steve’s thigh.
Because it was so much the same, but so utterly different. Because he knew what it meant to Steve. And now he knew what it meant to him too.
“Yeah,” Tony agreed, tilting his head to ask for a kiss. Cap gave him a quick peck on the cheek and walked away.
Steve wanted to be little spoon, even though he was so much bigger than Tony.  And, frankly, it was a little awkward.  More than a little.  Trying to reach up and around put Tony’s shoulder at a painfully weird angle. (Damn, Cap had wide shoulders and a barrel chest!)  Tony squirmed.  Eventually, Tony propped up on a pillow, and he felt a little silly like that, but he was glued to Steve’s back, arms wrapped around him, breathing in the smell of his hair, and then Steve reached up to clutch his hand, and it was just fine.
Steve crashed to his knees beside Tony, apparently misunderstanding his downcast gaze.  Steve gently lifted his chin.  He caressed Tony’s cheek with a shaking hand and stroked his cum from Tony’s skin.
(Tacky, Tony. Fucking tacky.) Tony felt his cheeks heat, now with embarrassment rather than remembered pleasure. (Couldn’t wait until you were in private, stupid?) Tony shook his head.
They laid quietly for a few moments, limbs twined around each other just as before, but something uneasy and unhappy was unfurling inside Tony, making his chest feel tight, his  stomach heavy.
There is a lot of world-building to do in the next few chapters and there will be more, so if there are some things that are unclear in this chapter they should become clearer as the narrative progresses…  Particularly there will be more about contracts.
Tony inspected his goatee and plucked a few stray (grey) hairs, then decided to ditch the tie and unbutton the top two buttons of his dress shirt. He had a strong jaw line still (thank God), and a good neck, slim and long. He’d been told he had a delicate throat—the kind a Dom daydreamed about collaring—and he wasn’t above flaunting it. (Never mind that Steve had seen him in a messy, scoop-necked wife-beater plenty of times; it wasn’t the same. This was a
Steve fetched two beers from the kitchen and hurried back to the sunroom. Tony had moved from the armchair to the couch when he got back. Steve delivered Rhodey’s beer, then took a seat close to Tony. (Not
He flashed the photo at Tony. A grinning little boy with Rhodey’s nose and Mrs. Rhodes’ eyes sat in front of a gigantic cake, covered in candles. (White candles. White candles for subs—purity—and blue candles for Doms—honor.)
“Or not,” Tony said, holding his hands up in surrender, “I just thought, you know, since you said you’d maybe be open to meeting her, just to give it a try, that there’s no time like the present. Just a preliminary meeting. To see what you think.”
“So, we’ve got some time to kill,” Bruce said briskly, shields on high.  “Shall we work on the data?”
“That was fun,” Bruce said with a smile.   He rolled his shoulders and gave a luxurious stretch as he stood up.  “Maybe the mantis shrimp will inspire another new element or something.  But, now it’s six and I should go see if Steve needs a hand with dinner. He’s roasting a chicken and I thought we might watch
“That it’s ok to have bad days,” Captain Rogers says, “That I don’t have to be perfect--nobody can be, no matter what myths people tell about them.”
At five-fifty-nine pm., Tony had set the dinning table in the penthouse with good China (& both forks and chopsticks), placed all the food in elegant covered serving bowls (which he’d found unexpectedly looking in a back cabinet for the reserve beer), and was now trying not to watch the clock. Tony forced himself to sit down and answer some Stark Industries email. (There. Look. Productive!)
Tony munched on his pancakes, listening with barely half an ear as the talk turned to the joys of training simulations with JARVIS.
“Look,” Steve said uncomfortably, “We need to have two conversations: Captain America and Iron Man, and then Steve and Tony, ok?”
Her expression tightened and she added in a grave tone, “And if you change your mind at any point and tell him to stop, he will.”
And Rogers always explicitly asked permission—and waited for an answer—before entering.  (Even before the “I think I kinda sexually harassed you and am really really sorry” thing.)
“Tony? May I come in? I brought you some—“ Steve stood in the doorway of the workshop holding a steaming mug and a small plate. “Oh! Hello. I’m sorry to interrupt.”
Tony rolled his eyes and considered cursing a blue streak to desensitize the Captain or maybe snarkily reminding him that Tony does in fact use the internet too. Then he thought better of it. Cap seemed really upset. Like,
Tony threw back his head and laughed.  “Are you fucking kidding me?  I’m Iron Man.  I can take care of myself.  And don’t pretend for a minute, Nickey-poo, that this is about wanting to keep me safe.”
As they made their way to the balcony, Tony thought vaguely in the back of his mind about how exactly to frame his offer. Flirt a little, then maybe try a direct suggestion: “Let’s go home together, but not until the end of the evening and do let’s be discrete, yes? Now, come meet Ms. Potts.”
“Does that feel good?” Tony asked.  Steve felt too lost to answer.  He panted wetly, his flushed face still tucked against one of his bound arms.  Steve tried to stay still, but couldn’t stop himself from rocking a little on Tony’s fingers, pressing back to meet him as he moved inside.  Tony grabbed his hip with one hand and held him in place, hard.  (pinned down, pried open . . .)
“Romanov kept fighting with a broken wrist,” Rhodey told him incredulously. “She hardly let up long enough for them to put it in a splint and give her shoulder seventeen stitches before going back out. Rogers didn’t like it, but seemed to know he couldn’t keep her down. Barton’s got a shattered ankle; I moved him from perch to perch a few times and he just kept on going. Other than the ankle, he’s fine.”

On the speakers, The Stars gave way to the rough tones of Edith Piaf; Steve reached out to rest his hand on Tony’s knee under the table.  His smile turned a little shy, but he didn’t move.  Tony reached down to cover Steve’s hand with his own, caressing it lightly with his thumb.  Steve was just smiling at him, gazing into his eyes, earnest and loving and Tony suddenly found it hard to breath.  Steve turned his palm up and laced their fingers together.
Over Bruce’s shoulder, Tony caught Steve’s eye on the other side of the Quinjet as he glanced up from his sketchbook. Were Steve’s ears a little pink? Tony looked back to the board as he felt the telltale tingling on his cheeks. (Damn it.) He checked that his sleeves were down over his wrists—in the lab he was always rolling them up, so sometimes he did it without thinking.
“Be good while Daddy’s out!” Tony called to the bots, then stepped into the elevator.  Steve reached out to pull him close and Tony barely stifled a little noise of surprise.
Pepper smiled a bit sadly and shook her head.  “That’s kind, Steve, but no, I really don’t think so.”
“Tilt your head back?” Steve asked gently. “I want to wash your hair.” Tony looked away and tensed; he opened his mouth, then closed it again. “Don't worry,” Steve said, trying to keep his tone light. “I won't get soap in your eyes. Or water on your face. Just tip your head back, ok?”
“Yeah, yeah. Got it.” Tony took another sip of coffee. “So, wanna hear about Stark Industries’ next must-have product?”
Tony scooped all the crumpled clothes up in his arms and tossed them into the closest, out of sight.  (Again, optimism.)  He slipped into his three-inch boots, grabbed his great coat, and hurried towards Steve, who met him with an appreciative gaze.
The fake cock was wet and heavy in his mouth. Steve focused on relaxing his throat and eased slowly forward, very carefully sliding it towards the back of his throat.
“Love you too.”  Steve glanced around the ballroom, then asked, “Not that I’m not enjoying dancing with you, but I was wondering how much later you expect the event to go?”
“Did you want some breakfast?” Cap offered again, setting his newspaper down. “I ate a while ago, but could make something.”
“Did you hurt any of your other lovers after you got the serum?” Tony asked it calmly, careful to keep his tone well clear of accusation. More rhetorical.
Tony smiled--vicious. "Then what are you waiting for?" he asked. "Get your cock out and fuck me. Fuck me up, hold me down and--"
But Steve had worried too. That he was intruding. That he didn’t fit in? Tony watched Steve dribble juices over the turkey and wondered what else Steve might have worried about.
Steve’s panic that Tony wasn’t getting anything out of their kinky sex (absurd!) had been the permission he’d needed. Tony had poured out more dirty talk, fucking Steve’s mouth hard and filthy, pushing him rougher, using his hard edges on Steve.  And, oh fuck, the way Steve had trembled under him when he’d gripped his jaw just a little too hard, or put a hint of steel in his voice.  The way Steve quivered when Tony scratched and bit at him, left a trail of red marks across his back, the way he’d bucked and moaned when Tony pinched his nipples . . . (Oh fuck!)  Steve took it so beautifully and wanted more, wanted it desperately, fiercely, urgently; the realization had left Tony just as desperate, half-dizzy and overwhelmed.
“Here.  Oh shit, I’m already late.”  He shrugged.  “Stark Industries calls.”  He kissed Steve again and grinned.  “And *you* have got homework.”
Rhodey had seven neat little stitches—one, two, three, four, five, six, seven—at his right temple and he had a black eye.  Some of the blood vessels in his eye must have burst on impact; it make it look like his eye was bleeding, even though it wasn’t.  His bottom lip was split, swollen and puffy.
Steve had always loved the pomp and grandeur of midnight services on Christmas eve.  The candles, the carols, the organ, the choir.  St. Michael’s was a stunning old church and still used the older version of the Book of Common Prayer, unchanged from Steve’s memories.  He was lost in a happy throng of people, the church packed for the beloved holiday, its benches and aisles crowded with solitary worshipers of all ages, elderly couples holding hands, young couples with small children struggling to stay awake so late in the evening.  There were some people in their twenties with brightly dyed hair, in blues and greens, covered in tattoos and piercings.  (And maybe leather isn’t considered inappropriate for Church anymore?)  Steve sat on the end of a back row, next to a couple who looked like they might have been born not too long after Steve.  They addressed him as ‘young man.’
Steve was staring at Tony and smiling.  He’d stopped eating.  In fact, he hadn’t moved or perhaps even blinked for several rapt minutes.  He was just starting at Tony with this *look* on his face.
“So, here’s the deal,” Tony said, growing a little more serious. (Deep breath.) “I’m ready to finish the security blanket—using the hybrid we created with a few polyaramid micro-fibers and embedded arc reactors—it’s genius! I don’t really need any more help with it.” Tony gave Bruce an apologetic look.
“Okay,” Tony said, grabbing his coffee and calling up the hypos. “Why don’t you walk me through it? Quietly.”
Rogers summoned the ninjas, who took seats side-by-side.  Tony started towards the table, then realized there was grease on his hands from engine tinkering.  Bruce was at the sink, so he went down the hall to wash his hands in the bathroom.  (What?  He’s an engineer, not a barbarian.)  When he got back, Bruce had plated the food and everyone was seated—except Rogers.  He was hovering and, as Tony approached,
“So, hey,” Tony said, “I’m going to start building the devices soon, but first I’m gonna need some food. I was thinking Thai. You want Thai?”
“No, no, really,” Clint called. “Just have fun back there, snacking and playing and hanging out. I’ll just fly us there. No worries.”
“And you, JARVIS,” Bruce answered politely.  Tony smiled.  He liked people who treated J like a person.  (As they should.)  Bruce would probably like the Tower if he liked J and
The journalists couldn’t possibly capture that. Their articles were flat; it was like reading about a friend and a stranger at the same time.
“My reputation?” Tony repeated, shaking his head.  “As if dating Captain America could damage my reputation.”
There was a detailed list of the differences between SM and abuse followed by a checklist for identifying the signs.  Steve found it powerfully reassuring to see things he’d grappled with, struggled to find words for, printed out so clearly.  Though, surely no one could ever confuse what Tony did for him with abuse—it was so loving.
“Nice, Captain,” Tony called.  (Someday, Tony was gonna study the physics of that shield . . . it really made no sense.)
For long minutes, they held each other, rocking slightly, curled up on the floor next to the bed.  Steve stopped shuddering.
The stranger made a disgusted grimace. “Is that your answer to everything? Throw money at it? You could have just
“That sucks,” Tony said, fiddling with the motherboard. “Have they explained some of the options in terms of interviewers and talk shows and stuff?”
Back at the Tower, Tony headed for the workshop on autopilot, but changed his mind halfway there to reroute for the common room. He found the kitchen counter covered in cooking things: pans and bowls and flour and sugar and
Tony nodded.  “True.  The episode’s more about cultural relativism; not so self-aware about the intrinsic injustices of colonialism.  Still groundbreaking for its time, though.”
“Tony,” Steve said, voice raw but controlled.  “Don’t move your hands.  Can you do that for me, baby?”
(Huh.) Steve realized he’d pictured Rhodey as looking almost exactly like Tony. (Only with a buzz cut. And no goatee. Weird.) He shook off the dissolving mental image.
“Look at that wave-particle duality,” Bruce said, tapping the screen. “It’s way off from any of our projections.”
After their talk in the living room, Steve suddenly found himself thinking about Stark. Actually, that wasn’t new—he’d been thinking about Stark before then, but with a low gut churning guilt that could push bile up his gorge or freeze up his lungs. (
The pups are warming up nicely to their new home. There have been a few hiccups here and there. Especially when James feels threatened or insecure. He growls or snaps when someone he doesn’t fully trust gets too close to his siblings. It’s only happened a few times around Happy, but after he’s warmed up to the beta, he trusts him enough to enter the penthouse.
“I’m going to check on them again,” Steve says, rising to his feet and adjusting his shirt before heading toward the door.
Hello! Hope everyone is doing good! I've been feeling a little better. I can't taste or smell and that's depressing, but at least I have my stories and lovely readers to lift my spirits.
That wasn’t to say that Steve didn’t trust his friends with his son. They had been nothing but good to him since the day Peter came home. The little boy was spoiled and loved by everyone.
His papa is serving breakfast, nodding along with what his dad is saying and doing his best to calm him down. Peter already knows which one will be the calmer of the two when he tells them.
The sound of voices fill the bathroom and Peter gasps softly in surprise. He recognizes them instantly, but only one voice makes his stomach twist into uncomfortable knots.
“Language. It’s something Papa used to say if any of us cursed. I don’t know if he...never mind. Yeah. Yeah I understand.”
“Yeah,” Tony nods and cups Steve’s face, smoothing his thumb over the soft skin. “It’s me. It’s just me. You’re okay.”
Sam was thrilled about the reveal, but maybe it was because he got to rub it in Bucky’s face. He made sure to do that and piss the Winter Soldier off. It only brought on more bickering.
Morgan knows exactly what her brother is referring to. Every weekend Peter was training. Usually her parents took turns training him but lately it’s been their dad’s turn.
Defeated, Steve gives up his son. Nat smiles down at the little pup and adjusts the blanket that’s beginning to slip off his tiny form. She’s gentle with him, just like she promised she would be.
Tony leads the way and together they enter the elevator. Steve appears even more hesitant about being in the elevator than he did when Tony offered him a car ride. He backs himself into a corner and his eyes squeeze shut. One hand falls to his belly; Tony wonders if he’s getting sick to his stomach.
He’s gone on countless missions with his team, but this had been the first where he didn’t feel like himself. The pain in his stomach never did go away, if anything it seemed to get worse. He ignored it to the best of his ability, but he was quickly learning that ignoring it wasn’t going to be enough anymore.
“Thank you. Nat, you don’t know how much I appreciate this. Everything you’ve done for me...thank you. I don’t know what I’d do without you. You’re an amazing friend.”
“It’s okay,” Steve soothes. The sound of his voice must be comforting because the baby’s cries begin to diminish. Steve looks up at Tony, their eyes meeting. “I’m sorry,” he says, the words barley above a whisper.
Tony’s hesitant to approach. The last thing he wants to do is make Steve feel worse. He has already done enough. He’s already done the worst thing possible.
“Don’t!” He screams, back arching off the bed. He needs to get away. He needs to fight. “Stop! Don’t! Don’t touch me!”
“Tony, you need to help me with him.” Her papa sounds irritated. The way he harshly scrambles the eggs is another indication that he was getting upset. Morgan sulks in the barstool, knowing a fight was going to break out.
Tony sighs. “Listen, kiddo, it’s going to take some time. I don’t want to barge in and throw off everything.”
He can’t hold back the tears anymore, and with a sob, he lets go and allows his emotions to take full control. He places his hand over the bronze shield, his body hunching forward and trembling with each sob.
“I know. But I’d rather you take the reins. I already know you’re going to make this place bigger and better.”
It’s difficult to fall back into a routine Tony had given up months ago. Being back in New York feels foreign. His penthouse used to act like a sanctuary, but now it reminded him of a prison. It was cold and dark, no matter how many lights Tony used to illuminate it. Steve wasn’t with him and that made being in the tower so lonely.
It’s not until he talks about waking up nearly 70 years later does he start to grow uncomfortable. Tony senses the change in his mate’s scent and brings their connected hands up to his lips, kissing Steve’s knuckles, assuring him that everything was okay now.
“Thank you. You know, I thought crazier things have happened to me but this...this is it. A baby, Nat. I have a baby. The one thing I shouldn’t have...couldn’t have…”
“Here, let me give you a hand,” Steve said smiling at them both. “How have you been, Tony? How’s school?”
) pieces of Welsh honey gingerbread. (What? She cuts them really small.) She’d given him a little update on her family. Apparently, her daughter was struggling with her dissertation. At least PhD students in English literature were pretty harmless-- any mistakes she made were unlikely to run wild and do millions of dollars in property damage. (Now, now. Don’t stereotype grad students, Rogers. Not
Steve shook his head and stood, smiling again.  “I was thinking I’d make hot chocolate.  Who else would like some?”
Steve stared at Tony’s note, thinking of those awful videos again.  He tried to imagine Tony saying those words to him in his sex voice, but still affectionate, calling him *those* sorts of names (whore! bitch!), dropping the nasty words in with his other filthy (but loving) bedroom talk . . . it was hard to imagine, but . . . He hit control+z and left them in along with “pretty little slut.”  Then crossed them out once more.  Then hit control+z again.  (Maybe . . .?)
“Completely.”  Steve said it with the tone of a vow.   He caressed Tony’s cheek gently and leaned in--
It was a chic gala; no one was gauche enough to gasp outright or take photos with their phones, but a startled little titter ran through the ballroom as Tony took the lead and showed Steve the basic box step.
Tony’s heart was racing and the air in the workshop seemed too thin. He took a long draught of coffee to compose himself.
The studio is absolutely quiet; Colbert looks surprised for a moment. Captain Rogers fumbles for his glass of water, but finds it empty. Colbert pours him another, then Colbert clears his throat and says, “Tony Stark’s absolutely right; it’s ok not to be ok.”
Steve frowned.  He’d done at least twenty sketches of Tony’s face for his latest project, but none of them were satisfactory.  It was his facial expression Steve couldn’t quite master.  In one, he looked too serious, in another too stern, and in another simply angry.  It was hard to replicate the rare mix of commanding strength and gentle affection that graced Tony’s features when gave orders or watched Steve kneeling obediently for him.  It was a beautiful expression and it constantly eluded Steve’s abilities to reproduce it.
Tony’d never heard Clint so stuttering and awkward. He shifted from one foot to the other and reached back to scratch his shoulder again—right where his quiver would be.
(It's okay. Rhodey's happy for us.) In fact, Steve was pretty sure Rhodey glanced down at their hands and smiled a little brighter, looking away from Tony's oration to catch Steve's eye with his grin.
Steve came suddenly, flooding Tony’s mouth with cum in thick, heavy pulses.  Tony tried to swallow it all, but a little tricked down his chin as Steve panted and shook above him.
.) Maybe Agent Dominick Dickface would greet Steve as a conquering hero, first to fuck that uppity Stark and get him on his knees.
“You too,” Tony said and really now wasn’t the time to be feeling all mushily romantic, but Steve was looking down and smiling at him and his hair was shiny and his eyes were—
Tony held him tight.  “I want to know everything.”  Tony kissed him—he’d meant it to be soft and gentle, but it turned out fierce and possessive.  Steve didn’t seem to mind.  He clutched at Tony’s shoulder and arched into the kiss.

Steve was taking him on a date tonight.  They’d talk after that.  It would be fine.  Tony turned his attention back to the schematics for Clint’s programmable arrows and realized he was repeating work he’d already done.
Tony should really check his data one more time before manufacturing the initial prototype, but his attention was wandering again. He had hundreds of questions for Rogers, curiosities about his life, his experiences.

“Thank you,” Rogers said softly, with a sad little smile. “I--” He swallowed, blinked, “I’m so sorry.”  Rogers gave Tony one last miserable glance, then left, head hanging, with a final muttered “sorry.”
“Seriously though, these are the stupidest evil robots ever.”  Iron Man whined.  “I mean, why did they even call us in for this shit?  It’s so easy it’s like playing a video game with your eyes closed.”
“Hi, buddy,” Tony called, with no voice modulator. He was wearing the full suit except for the helmet, which he held in his arms. Hulk sniffed at him, bored.
“Wow,” Steve said as the theme music concluded the episode.  “That really was a good episode, Tony.”
Steve’s eyes narrowed. “I think God’ll forgive me for missing Mass once every blue moon.” He frowned. “And I’d hardly have expected
who came to the workshop, not quite able to believe tonight’s dinner with Tony could really be a date.
“But the longer I was floating, the more I—”  Steve swallowed and his voice dropped.  “Tony, it felt like you were
“Have you seen the balcony here?” Tony asked Belford. “The view is lovely and I could use some fresh air if you’d like to join me.”
“Honestly, when you said we could watch that episode again, I didn’t expect you’d have time for quite a while,” Steve said with a smile. “I’m glad you can take the time. You work so hard.”
Sorry for the long wait, everybody!  On the upside, it's about 3 times longer than my usual chapters.  Hope you like it!
Steve looked a little bewildered as he continued, “Things have changed so much and I don’t always know—“ Steve shrugged.  “I’m old fashioned.  I want you to be my fella, just mine, and not go with anyone else.”  He kissed Tony’s hand and added, “And, I don’t want anyone else.  Just you.”  Steve shrugged.
I won't be able to sustain a chapter a day (or anything like it) but was so excited to finish this chapter I couldn't wait to post it.  Hope you enjoyed!
“Just saying, his emo shit is so not cute. The plan is great. I like the plan.” Tony shook his head. “And his own research shows it’s the best plan too! It’s not like I’m just dancing around singing ‘kumbaya, love, peace, la-la-la-la-la!’”
Clint continued: “And you! You’re so assertive and independent! I just thought Cap’d want some sweet, soft-spoken, doting little woman who’d—“
Tony’s lack of early morning eloquence didn’t trouble Steve; he looked relieved and pleased. He cuddled closer and laid a hand over the dogtags around Tony’s neck.
Tony took the elevator. (What? It’s five floors!) He gave his armpits a little sniff on the way up and changed course from common area to penthouse—he’d better grab a quick shower too. And clean clothes.
“Hawkeye and Black Widow have far more training in hand-to-hand combat than I do,” Rogers answered, tone calm and reasonable. “They’re both better qualified to teach you than I am.”
(Tony’s not ashamed.  Tony wanted to kiss you, right there in the restaurant.  You’re the one who pulled away, acting like he was doing something
"Barnes really wasn't your alpha?"  He sounded surprised and something speculative came into his eyes.  He went to one of the guards by the entrance and said something in a low voice, then closed the door and took a seat again.  He poured a second goblet of wine and placed it in front of Steve.
“Don’t you think we should get started?” Agent Dominic asked loudly.  He glanced around the room at everyone, but it felt like he was particularly looking at Tony and Johnny.
They were silent again. Maybe that was it? Maybe Tony would just fall asleep right here on the floor—maybe Steve would too. Or maybe he’d pick Tony up and tuck him into bed once he nodded off and—
Natasha took the big armchair; Tony noticed her knitting things in a bag at her feet. Clint and Bruce were side by side on the couch and Steve took a seat at the far end, leaving room for Tony. His heart gave a little jump as he looked at the space at Steve’s feet. He swallowed.
(He’d better finish the Security Blanket soon—they needed to get to the ranch. Maybe mini-arc reactors? It
Tony kissed him very lightly on the lips, running his fingers through Steve’s hair.  Steve wanted to squirm closer, but Tony hadn’t said he could move.  He twisted his hands, testing the feeling of the ropes around his wrists.  (
Rogers took another deep breath and resumed speaking so quietly Tom could barely hear it, even with the enhancers: “But I won’t. I won’t because it’s all too possible I’d break your spine on impact. Or shatter your nose and drive the bone shards into your brain, killing you instantly.”
there was a protocol. Tony was tempted to tell him how bad it had been—that Rhodey and Pepper had worried he’d walk off the ledge one day without his suit. They’d begged him to modify JARVIS and eventually he relented, though he was certain they were wrong to worry. Even at his worst, he’d been too angry about dying to check out early on purpose; he did it for them anyway.
“More sass, JARVIS? Everybody’s against me! Seriously, call Tim Gunn. No Michael Kors. No, both of them!”
Tony shuddered. Pepper took a sip of water, then added with another smile, “He was here earlier. He sat with you while I freshened up—he’ll be grumpy that he missed you.” She pushed her hair back out of her face and continued. “Rhodey took you to the quinjet and Dr. Banner was able to stabilize you until they could manage a medevac. The portal was shut, but there were still a lot of the aliens on the ground and they changed their tactics when the portal closed. They jumped the perimeter and scattered. Many of them hid. They’re still looking for the last of them.”
“Okay,” Tony said, “I’ll introduce you to my A-teams next time. You’ll like them; they’re the best.” He grinned, then rubbed his hands together briskly.
NB:  I did a minor ret-con on the end of the last chapter; might help to go back and read the end bit...  Sorry!
The next day when he came up, Steve found Tony and Bruce drinking coffee in the kitchen both scribbling frantically on a large piece of graph paper.  They gave Steve a distracted “good morning” and “help yourself to coffee,” then went back to speaking science like it was a foreign language.  Steve poured himself a cup of coffee he didn’t really want to drink and sipped it awkwardly for a few minutes while they talked.  They seemed to forget he was there and he hated to intrude; what they were talking about seemed very important and perfectly incomprehensible.  Steve finished the bitter tasting coffee, washed and dried his mug, then put it away in the cabinet.  Steve went for a run.
Natasha showed up silently with her Widow’s Bite one afternoon. She handed it to Tony, then settled in the corner of the workshop to do maintenance on her other weaponry, her motions fluid even with her wrist in a cast. Gun oil was a familiar smell (and not unlike Bruce’s smelly tea, come to think of it); the sound of sharpening knives should probably have felt more unsettling than it did.
Tony watched the white cliffs rise up on the horizon. If he weren’t so bitter about being sent to the ends of the earth, he’d probably find the sight beautiful.
Steve’s breath hitched again. The air was thick and heavy around them and then suddenly it was all too much.
“Mr. Stark.  Dr. Banner,” Rogers said, with a nod and a glance at their bags, “Are you heading out?”
“Look, Steve.  It’s kinda like learning another language.  I need to know that we’re using the same words the same way, that we have a vocabulary to communicate about BDSM.  I mean, so far we’ve been doing a lot of ‘it’ and ‘this’ and ‘this way’—all kinds of vague, between-the-lines talk, but that isn’t very clear. And clarity matters.”
“We’re an ambitious company, though,” Belford continued, “And still growing. Actually, we’d like to enter the medical technology markets.”
(And, okay, we’re really far off script, but it seems like it’s going well.)  Tony kissed Steve on the forehead and Steve made a pleased little noise.  (Go on.  We’re not done here.)
“Dunno,” Tony said noncommittally, though his first instinct was a firm ‘no.’ He doubted that Rogers was talking about feelings and loss and trauma with any of them.
Tony awakened from a fitful slumber to the sensation that something was subtly wrong. JARVIS didn’t greet him; he wasn’t in his bed.
“Saving your work and shutting down the workshop now, sir,” JARVIS said smoothly. Tony just nodded. (Shit. Have to apologize to JARVIS later. And--)
Although it felt interminable, the meeting actually lasted only thirty-three minutes. Tony bolted from the room as soon as they adjourned.
“What do you mean?”  Tony asked and examined the silver. “Going on?  Nothing!”  He glanced up again.  “And stop giving me that look.  You know, you treat me like a naughty schoolboy on a regular basis.  And not in a sexy roleplay kinda way.  What’s up with that anyhow?”
As Tony mixed up another batch of poinsettias—cranberry, vodka, and champagne—the team eagerly encouraged Steve to add still more items to their Park Chop Suey order, extoled the virtues of
“Yeah, but how?” Clint asked, turning to Rhodey. “There must be some sort of story.”   He glanced down at the photo and handed it on to Natasha.
I may not have escaped unscaithed, but here it is.  All praise and gratitude to thatwhichyeilds for her unfailing awesomeness and patience.
“Awww, you gonna defend your little piece?” Dom taunted with a grin. “Fight for his honor? What little’s left of it.”
“Yay hotdogs!” Tony exclaimed, beckoning Steve into the elevator. Steve gave him a halfhearted smile as they began to descend.
“Just coffee,” he said, but he’d hardly taken a step away when Steve grabbed his hand and darted down to place a chaste, furtive kiss on Tony’s cheek. Tony smiled.

What the fuck had happened?  Had he really been so lost in it that he’d missed Steve’s cues so badly?  Steve had seemed fine at the earlier check ins—how long had it been since the last one?  Or, the last one Steve had seemed really coherent for?  He’d gone non-verbal at some point. Tony wasn’t sure.
Nothing against Stark, but hasn’t Captain America been running in Central Park with a guy from the military? He was wearing a Veterans Affairs shirt in one of the photos. I bet that he’s the one Cap was talking about, especially since he said he’s talked to ‘a friend’ at the VA about PTSD.
“There was a box of Christmas tree ornaments—a special box—at the manor. Did—Uh, did we move it over to the Tower?”
Tony snorted.  “Good talk,” he said to Steve, brushing past.  He added to Clint, “And although you didn’t actually offer, I’m just gonna help myself to--”
“No, I’m afraid not,” Miss Rushman replied smoothly. “His wealth and renowned are based on industry, not on his purely private artistic achievements.”
about nestling in Steve’s arms and Tony found himself going loose and relaxed even as his mind raced with tantalizing possibilities: images of Steve’s naked body, a wide expanse of creamy skin; the thought of rope or restraints, secure around his wrists; the sound of smacking flesh and labored breathing. Tony licked his lips. There was warmth pooling in his belly, low and tight.
“Also!” Steve added triumphantly, completely ignoring Tony’s little speech.  “George Takei was the only Asian American on television!  It wasn’t that long before that we’d illegally imprisoned our own Japanese citizens, including Takei when he was a child.” Steve waved his hands, his voice getting louder in his excitement.  “And Nichelle Nichols was the only African American actress on television then who wasn’t playing a maid.  Just because I missed the whole Civil Rights Movement doesn’t mean I don’t care about how things happened.  That was a big deal!”
“But perhaps you’ll find that you’re busy tomorrow after all,” she said, “when you understand the exact nature of the . . . art.”
As they cuddled warmly under the blankets that Steve had immediately wrapped around them, Tony contemplated how best to broach the subject.
“Good,” Tony said with an encouraging smile. “You go: back, side, together, then forward, side, together. See?”
“I said ‘no,’” Rogers answered more firmly. “We shouldn’t make the announcement like that. We’re a team, we should all go public together.”
When Tony ambled blearily towards the kitchen early the next morning—(he’d had no one to keep him up late, after all)—he could hear Steve singing softly to himself.
“That’s not really my scene anymore,” Tony said dryly. He nearly sighed aloud—looked like Belford was a bust. And Tony’d had such high hopes for him.
Rogers just looked so surprised! He took a deep breath and began, “Mr. Stark, I meant no disrespect.”
“JARVIS? Make a reservation for two at 7:30 at . . . .” He frowned. “Let’s just try every restaurant in New York City with three Michelin stars.”
Speaking of the holidays, fandom, and our favorite boys..... uh, well, if you maybe have a few dollars left to spare, why not consider making a little donation to charity in Steve and Tony's honor?  I'm making my own (very modest, I'm afraid...) holiday donations to the LGBT Help Center where my friend volunteers doing peer-support chats. (http://www.glnh.org/)  In my head canon for the Surrender Universe, Steve turned to the Help Center for free, confidential counseling while he was struggling with his identity as a gay man and a submissive; they helped him work through his feelings for Tony and decide to come out to his team.  Yay Help Center!
Steve climbed from the cab, still holding Tony’s hand, holding him close, as they went into the Tower and crossed the lobby.
Rhodey brought Tony sandwiches and junk food, and he goofed off with Dummy and You. He asked questions about War Machine’s repairs and upgrades; they argued about the guns—as usual, by rote. Rhodey tried to lure Tony from the workshop, but didn’t force the issue.
Steve sat down on the edge of his bed, then decided that was a terrible place to do this.  (Far too much potential for distraction…)  He moved to his armchair.  Then to his studio, to the daft table Tony had given him.  He flipped on the power and took a moment to stare at the whole spreadsheet.  He skimmed the list.   (Yes! Yes! Maybe. Ew.  Huh?  Yes!  Huh? Huh? Huh?  Okay, wait.  Huh?)
And now there's a companion piece here on AO3 about the Dom with the Coat: http://archiveofourown.org/works/3308483
There was grease behind Tony's left ear. Steve washed it and pressed a little kiss to the spot. He ran soapy hands across Tony's shoulders, arms, back, chest. (Under water, the arc reactor is even more otherwordly, glowing blue-green and beautiful. It's nothing like seeing it when they swim, getting a fleeting glimpse, trying not to look too closely...) Done with Tony's upper body, Steve shifted to the other end of the tub to wash and massage Tony's feet, right then left, and to caress and wash Tony's lightly furred legs.
In re: this chapter, just a few words:   I started “Permission to Surrender” with Steve far along in the process of self-acceptance as a gay man and a submissive.  For him to reach that point took a lot of courage and hard work, but it wasn’t the story I set out to tell.  That said, even when one is far along the road of self-acceptance, some things remain very challenging and emotionally difficult.
Tony slept for ten hours.  Pepper had arrived from California and settled into his guest room while he slept, then gone down to the tenth floor to work on something or other.  Tony made coffee and hopped in the shower.  (What? There’s a special ledge for his mug that keeps it out of the spray, okay?  Efficiency, people.  Efficiency.)
“Oh, honey, you should see your face! It’s priceless.” He sounded terribly smug. “Darling, since your last visit I suspected you had feelings for the Captain. Just hoped he’d have sense enough to appreciate you. And anyone who watched Colbert with half a brain could guess exactly who he was talking about.”
For the first thirty minutes, Pepper hovered nearby—until Tony glared at her enough she took the hint. Natasha always seemed to talking to somebody near him too, but that always looked like a coincidence. (But it would, wouldn’t it? She was a spy after all . . .)
Full of pizza and beer, Tony relaxed back into the couch, then slumped over against Rhodey’s shoulder and drifted to sleep as the sounds of Sufjan Stevens washed over him.
All the air seemed to rush from Steve’s lungs in a desperate ‘whoosh’ that left him feeling half dizzy with lust.  He struggled awkwardly to obey, shuffling his knees further apart.  The motions pressed him heavily into the cushion and made his wrists pull against Tony’s belt.
Bruce gave Tony a deer in headlights look, but Rogers just turned to him and answered seriously, “That I’ll make getting you clear of the Hulk my top priority if Dr. Banner ever has an incident.”
“And I never was that guy,” Rogers says softly. “The man with a perfect plan dressed in the flag, who always comes out on top and never gets hurt or dirties his hands. He was a PR campaign, an allegory--not a person. Captain America is an ideal, like America itself. But Tony reminded me, it’s ok to be Steve. And Steve has nightmares about the war.”
Tony paused in his second bite.  “So you brought me éclairs?  I thought you’d bring a sub fruit and yogurt.  Or muesli.”
Sorry for the delay!  Thanks so much for all your constant kindness, especially thatwhichyields and Nonymos.
to do for Steve.) Even as Tony’s plan took shape, there was a part of him that rebelled against it—(What will people think?)—but that muttering voice was crowded out by the others. (This is
The articles and the clips all had a good bit of judicious editing. The journalists, unsurprisingly, never exposed their own idiocy, though, some of the more liberal outlets delighted in commenting on the conservative one’s patronizing questions.
“Fine. Great. Good,” Tony muttered, then shook his head. “Order Park Chop Suey—all Steve’s favorites—and ask him to join me for dinner in the penthouse when he gets back, okay, J?”
was Steve: having received free license to whip, fuck, and choke him—among other things—Steve still treated French kissing like something to initiate with cautious inquiry.)
Natasha and Bruce were standing at the counter looking at something on her tablet while Steve hovered nearby, staring at the elevator doors and looking gorgeous in a dark green sweater and jeans.
“Now then, gentlemen,” Fury said folding his hands on the table.  It did nothing to make him seem less menacing. “Dr. Banner and Mr. Stark would like to relocate to Stark Tower and take the spectrometer, correct?”
“Avoiding? Nobody’s avoiding!” Tony cried. He winced; his voice came out shrill. This did nothing to reassure Rhodey.
“Yeah, and soon, soon you’ll be ready for me to fuck your throat . . . so good . . . oh fuck!  Steve!”
Rogers’s fists balled at his sides and he bit out: “Is it true that you ran a betting pool on who would be the first at SHIELD to get Mr. Stark into bed,
Tony paused. The tank top was threadbare—leaving the light and the contours of the arc reactor clearly visible—and it drooped low, revealing the topmost scarring, thick and knotted. (Shit.)
Tony’d sent her off with a “go get ‘em, tiger!”; she’d given him her best shark grin then strode away in her most Mistress boots and Commander suit.  (Seriously, it had military style lapels; Tony loved that thing…)*
“Uh, sorry,” Steve said, after a few long moments.  He pulled back to give Tony a weak smile.  “I didn’t mean to be so melodramatic.”
“Hey, you arrived just in time!” Tony called from under the adjustor. “Run the diagnostic again, would you, Bruce?  I think I got the fluxator recalibrated.”

The rest of this story is dedicated to the kind readers who continued to comment during my long absence and to my anonymous kinkmeme writer. She has given me the MOST BEAUTIFUL fuck-or-die fic (read and praise it here! : http://avengerkink.livejournal.com/17385.html?thread=39139305t39139305) and, when I offered her thank you fic, she asked for more of the Surrender world. So this is for you, dear anon!
“As you should,” Tony said with a nod. “Come on. Let me do this for you. Gotta protect you—think what my stocks would do if you died?”
Clint shrugged. “Who knows? It’s Natasha’s theory. That’s how it went down with whosit—the PR idiot.”
“My God!” Steve exclaimed, taking in Rhodey’s crutch and sling and stitches and-- “Oh my God, Rhodey, what happened? Are you all right?”
“I really think he’d be fine right there,” Steve objected again as Rhodey started trying to pull Tony up off the couch. He overbalanced and stumbled, flopping back down. After a moment’s fumbling, Rhodey got his shoulder under Tony’s arm and started to heft him up.
Steve thought about the drawing he’d given Tony.  He spread his legs a little wider.  His cock stirred.
“Of course, Mr. Rogers,” he said, still a little melancholy.  “I hope the position proves satisfactory.  I wish you the best of luck.”
“What? No! God no.” Tony said, shaking his head emphatically. “Steve’s great. We’re great. Let’s go out!”
with Natasha and Clint to debrief the Agents who had been there for the Eewoo. Why the fuck couldn’t Hill and Fury have shown up for that one and spared them all the pain of redundancy?!?
From the far side of the penthouse, Steve heard the elevator and then familiar footsteps in the hallway, Tony’s easy gait.  He wanted to turn around, but Tony had told him to kneel and not move, so he didn’t turn as Tony drew closer.
“Hey, it’s okay,” Tony said. Bruce had both his hands resting, palms down, on the workbench; Tony ducked under his arm to get in close and give Bruce a hug.
“Look,” Tony said impatiently, gathering himself for a full on rant, “you sell those to the press, put them online, or whatever—then this place is gonna be overrun. There’ll be fans and paparazzi, you name it, and next thing you know it’ll be a circus out here and those poor kids won’t get to enjoy their Christmas or their special visitor in peace. And it’ll look like some ‘Captain America visits orphans’ PR bullshit not that he’s here because Steve is a nice person who seriously just wanted to make some kids happy and spend time with them on Christmas—something he can’t do with the press howling at the gates. So, how about it? Name your price.”
No luck. Steve wandered down the balcony a little ways, maybe six feet from Tony, then leaned against the railing to look up at the moon.
Steve was really sucking cock. His cock. With determination and (it seemed) pleasure.  Fully clothed. On his knees.
“Nice toss, Hulk!” Steve called. He tossed the helmet to Clint who returned it to Hulk who threw it back to Tony.
Steve nodded.  “I remember it playing on the radio, before I shipped out.  Before I even met Dr. Erskine.” Steve gave a melancholy little smile, then shook his head and continued: “Then a few months ago, when I’d just moved into the Tower, JARVIS put together a bunch of music for me.  It was on the list. Made me think of you. Listened to it a lot after that.”
It was Bruce, hovering in the doorway of the workshop.  Tony startled, realizing suddenly he wasn’t actually working on Dummy anymore, just sitting there petting him who was making soft whirring noises.  Tony cleared his throat.
Tony was the first to get to the common room. He was still smiling a satisfied smile when Steve entered, frowning.
Tony closed the browser history and was about to throw away the entire luminous screen, when he noticed Rogers' training modules.  (Just a quick peek and then Tony'd back off.)  Tsk, tsk-- Rogers was behind on compliance.  He had twenty-two online courses and quizzes due and had only taken the first one.  Tony blinked.  He'd failed the first compliance exam.  Three times.  With a 17%, a 36% and a 41%.
Tony opened his mouth, then blinked and closed it, distracted from his witty repartee by the way Steve’s thumb had strayed to caress the underside of his wrist.
“Sir, Captain Rogers asked to be informed when you were awake. Permission to relay this information?”
Bruce and Pepper set the table with all the fancy china and cloth napkins and stuff Tony was still pretty sure he hadn’t purchased himself. (Must have been the decorator.) The table was overflowing with food: mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, green beans, salad, cranberry sauce, stuffing, all in gigantic serving bowls. There were five pies cooling in the kitchen. Clint had taken a dozen pictures each.
Thank you for reading!  I really hope you liked it and that--after the SO VERY LONG WAIT--it wasn't a let down.  (I had an unusually hard time getting back into the story after hiatus and reconnecting everything--Steve especially was giving me trouble.  And then I just *couldn't* get the tumblr images to align properly and was too fed up to keep working on it when I've got so much work and am moving across country.  Besides, better focus on the next chapter, right? :)
Miss Rushman continued. “He can be harsh, but he is not by nature cruel. He’s brilliant, arrogant, and impatient.”
“Yeah,” Tony said, trying to shrug it off. He set his coffee mug down a little too hard. “I just forgot something. No big deal.”
Little by little, Steve’s chilled skin grew warm and his shivering subsided. His breathing, though still a little ragged, was starting to calm. His pulse slowed. The minutes slid by.
“So, here’s what I propose,” Tony said. “Why don’t you bring your drawing stuff down to the workshop? Or we can watch some more
Miss. High Society Blue Dress was probably only two or three years younger than Steve—who was, what? 25? 26?—but Tony knew what he meant.
“Hello,” the Captain says, entering to rapturous applause. He sits down, shaking Colbert’s hand. “It’s very nice to be here.”
Tony stood there a few seconds, not wanting to walk in, but people were staring at them so finally Tony caved.  He stomped into the conference room and Rogers shut door behind them. The room was empty.  They were the first to arrive, but it wouldn’t have mattered if he’d had an audience at this point.  Tony was fed up.
Rogers faltered, then added more quietly, “I mean, uh, I think Natasha’s right—we need to stick together.” Rogers cast a worried glance across the room. “Clint’s taking the losses pretty hard; it’s good to show him that we’re all here. A team.”
Rogers’ eyes glimmered with mischief and he added in a conspiratorial whisper, “Breaking the second one
“So, here I am, big fella,” Tony said in a low voice, pressing his thigh against Steve’s. “Yours to do with as you please—whether you’re tucking me into bed, picking up where we left off, or … something else.”
Tony nodded, feeling irritated—though not with the Captain, but with himself. (Seriously? Two years of self defense training, and that’s what you’ve got?) Of course, most grabby jerks didn’t have Cap’s training, so there was that.
Hope you liked it!  And much much gratitude to everyone who has left me comments and love.  If you're wondering, there's a little update about RL here: http://ms-meredith-milton.tumblr.com/post/119578102236/merediths-rl-update
“ ‘bout time,” Clint said. He was sitting in the chair Natasha’d taken earlier, crutches at his side. His ankle was in a cast and elevated across another chair back.
“You do know that you’re a billionaire, right?” she teased curling up on the ugly plaid thing.  “You know you could buy fancy furniture for the workshop, ruin it, and replace it without difficulty, right?”
Tony’d been feeling restless, so instead of getting a ride to SHIELD HQ, he flew there in the briefcase suit. Freed from the limitations of traffic, Tony left after the others and beat them there. Instead of dealing with the Dicks of SHIELD, he flew loops above HQ blasting Beyoncé and AC/DC, waiting for the other to arrive. When SHIELD’s ridiculous, unmarked bulletproof SUV pulled up, Tony landed and let the suit form itself neatly into the briefcase, revealing Tony’s magnificence in Armani.
sincerity—but he got the feeling there was something else haunting Steve’s thoughts. (Bucky? Shit. He must miss his old friends so bad--)
As soon as the quinjet touched down, everyone sprang into action, moving the mini-spectrometer into place.
Steve drew back, focusing on the head once more, then eased forward again to let it touch his throat. He choked. (“Shhhh . . . easy, sweetheart . . . go on, try again, baby . . .”)
Bruce rolled his eyes. “Says the man who covers himself in motor oil on a regular basis.” Bruce turned his attention back to the chart.
And some of you will be excited to hear that the next thing I post will be a certain long-awaited out-take staring Steve... It will shed light on what exactly happened at SHIELD. :)
They found Captain America.  It wasn’t public knowledge yet and, even though the expedition had been funded by Stark Industries (not by
.” He shrugged again, watching the lights blink on and off.  “I just ended up looking up more and more until everything became a bit of a blur.  But, well, I know enough to realize that these things are usually ten thousand square feet.”
On screen Uhura and Spock were using their new device to combat the obstructing frequencies of the Kranuh trying to trap Chekov and Sulu on their planet. (The redshirts in the landing party were already dead—no hope for them.)
Steve sat down on the floor next to Tony facing the door to the en suite bathroom and a chest of drawers with a huge mirror above it. It looked oddly blank from this angle, reflecting nothing but the dark, cloudy sky out the windows.
Tony continued to pet him, stroking his shoulders gently.  The frantic heat of Steve’s earlier arousal faded somewhat, now banked embers rather than open flame.  The ropes around his wrists were like an embrace he could sink down into.
“Mulled wine is ready!” Bruce called and they assembled eagerly—except Clint, who had already dashed over to the tree. Appropriately, “O Tannenbaum” came on as the rest of the team approached the tree to join him.
“A Dom has to be in control,” Bruce said, then let out a bitter laugh. “I can’t think of a creature less in control than the Hulk. He’s—
(Twenty years ago, Tony would have despised him, or at least avoided him like the plague. Now, he hoped he knew better than to dismiss someone based on appearance or mannerisms.)
Steve liked to do paperwork at the dinner table—after all they seldom used it for formal dining—and he liked that his teammates would drop by and chat. So that was nothing out of the ordinary, but he usually didn’t change into his uniform to do it.
WARNINGS: self-destructive behaviors; drug use; slut shaming; shitty media being shitty; elements of dub-con (though Tony doesn't think of it in those terms); internalized slut shaming.
Tony was studying him intensely in the dim light.  That horrible blankness was gone, but he looked worried and uncertain.
As the sounds of Scott Joplin filled the Tower, Tony glanced around the room at his team and realized they belonged there. And it felt good. Surprisingly good.
“Pfft—not that!” Jerry waved Rogers’ words away. “Stark! What happened? And how much was in the pot?”
It sounded almost like an accusation and Steve tried not to bristle. “I've made sure he's not skipping meals,” he said, then hated that he was explaining himself to her. (
“Do you know who started it?” Clint demanded, not giving Cap time to answer before he started guessing. “Bush?  Johnson?  No, they’re too scared of Hill.  Dominick! It’s that macho asswipe, isn’t it?”
Steve shook his head and turned back to his specially reinforced punching bag, the one Tony'd made him. He hadn't managed to destroy it yet, but that wasn't for lack of trying. He'd been pounding it for at least forty-five minutes-- ever since he'd overheard Ms. Potts.
Tony finished off the coffee. “Nah,” he said with a shrug. “I never have an appetite first thing in the morning. And I should really go home and get to work.”
“You thought of me as an equal,” Tony said, tone reassuring. “The implications of your vestigial gallantry notwithstanding. I know that now, so—water under the bridge.”
who’d be getting tied up, but he kept it to himself.  Steve had seemed a little sex-shy lately and, though Tony sure hoped he was getting laid on Valentine’s day, well--no pressure.)
“More,” Tony pleaded, and to his great pleasure Steve complied, adding a second finger to the first, moving in and out of his body with exceptional care.
—but he couldn’t get the words out around the lump in his throat. He closed his mouth again and nodded.
“I realize I haven’t been studying very long,” Steve continued falteringly, “so I will understand completely if you’re not comfortable with the idea, but if you’d like—if you wanted—I’d be honored to, uh, spend the night. With you.”
my ass.  He'd probably just been trying to make friends with Agent Dickface and Co. by out Dom-ing Master Marcus to win that fucking bet.
“Oh,” Tony said.  “Okay.  Thanks.” He glanced away. “I really have a lot of work to do, though, so—”
“Thanks,” Steve said, smiling again. He glanced down at his watch—an actual wristwatch—and said, “Well, time to baste.”
The driver was mangling The Shirelles’ sweetly anxious “Will you still love me tomorrow?” as they pulled up to the Tower.  Steve told him to keep the change and gave Tony his hand as they stepped from the cab. It was freezing out; Steve stepped around him to block the wind for the short walk into their private entrance. (Sap.)
Steve knew he couldn't keep their relationship a secret, especially not as celebrities in this brave new world, but beyond that he didn't even want to. He wanted to hold Tony's hand on top of the table at Piaci. He wanted to put his arm around Tony's shoulder when they walked. He wanted to kiss Tony in Central Park. He wanted to spend the next miserable gala on Tony's arm. He didn't want to hide what he had with Tony.
Tony kissed and caressed him for ages, pausing occasionally to share more port and chocolate.  Steve lost himself in sensual pleasure.  They’d never just laid down and kissed for so long, on and on.  Steve shivered, soaking it all in, but desperate for more. He let out a long, loud moan, clutching at Tony helplessly.
Tony started to follow Steve to the elevator then, on second thought, turned back to down the last of his cold coffee like a shot before leaving.
“Mr. Stark! Nice to see you,” Rogers said warmly. Tony jolted and hit his head on the underside of the counter.
Thank you so much for joining me for Part II of “Permission to Surrender!”  (If you missed that story, I suggest going back and taking a look, since this second story probably won’t make much sense without it.  The summary is a flashback to that story...)  I’m so happy to be writing this and so very pleased and touched to hear that other people have been enjoying it too.  Thank you!
When Steve drew back for a moment to adjust his position, Tony looked so panicked, but as Steve pulled him closer his eyes lit up with— (Triumph? No, no. Just pleasure.)
“He took Home Ec,” Tony explained, then turned back to Steve, “Yeah, I tired adjusting the tension, but the real problem was the damn machine wasn’t designed to do materials more heavy-duty than Kevlar which, okay, fair enough since there weren’t any until I invented them this week, but still!” Tony shook his head disapprovingly, then shrugged, “Anyway, so I was designing a new sewing machine.”
“Nope. He dumped them for a promotion over at Morgan Stanley when they pushed out Zuckerman.” Jackie scratched at Tony’s scalp with just the right amount of pressure; it made Tony want to purr. “Theresa worked with Harry once on a big M&A.” Jackie laughed “He’s a Dom with a dick, but she actually doesn’t hate him, so he must be doing something right!”
“Tony, I said everything all out of order and I’m sorry.” Steve seemed to struggle for a moment before continuing, “I’ve been selfish and I’m so sorry.”  (Huh?)  “I had no idea what I was asking of you, and then I started thinking and I suddenly realized,” Steve looked away, shamefaced, and his voice dropped, “I never even asked you if you want this.”  Steve waved the book in his hand.  In almost a whisper, Steve repeated: “I never even asked.”
“Yeah, no.” Tony shook his head again.  “Put me on the team now, and mi casa su casa. Otherwise forget it.”
has to be and all the responsibility and all these techniques and the things you need to be careful of and the way you’ve got to keep a vigilant watch on the . . . the
Steve nodded, letting out a long shuddering breath. He leaned back against a column. “Yeah. It’s fine.”
“Hey, Cap?” he called out when Rogers was on the threshold. “Thanks for breakfast. It was really good.”
“Probably,” Tony said, shrugging awkwardly in the armor. “But the problem is communicating our intentions.”
(Even worse, he’d followed it up with a hideous attempt at a seductive purr of: “Because I like my Doms like I like my coffee—strong and black.” Jesus he’d been a moron. It was a miracle Rhodey hadn’t hated him.)
“No, not at all,” Steve hastened to reassure her.  “It’s—”  (Shit!)  “It’s nothing important.”  (No that’s not true.  It is important!  It’s just not
Tony had never said goodbye or mentioned any plans, but Steve hadn’t seen him in days so he figured that he’d gone somewhere with Ms Potts.  Steve wished once more that Thor were back from Asgard.
“You are.” Tony smiled, one of his real smiles.   “I’m a genius, but sometimes I can be slow on the uptake. About people. You . . .you really are a good guy.”
Hulk watched with lazy attention as Tony fitted the helmet in place with the faceplate up. He sniffed at Tony again and yawned.
Rogers let out a rueful little laugh and shook his head.  “Mr. Stark, I already woke up in a world like a science fiction novel.” He shrugged. “Doubt much can surprise me now.”
“And, we’re together now,” Tony continued. “So, what do you say, big guy? Wanna show me some moves? The training mat’s nice and soft if I take a tumble . . .”
“I’m not late, you’re early,” he said, leaning forward to kiss her on the cheek.  She was wearing new perfume, not the Oscar de la Renta that had always said “Pepper” to him.  Before.  (Huh.  That’s actually a relief.)
that they’d found Captain America a month ago, but he hadn’t been expecting to see him either.  He swallowed, and his pulse sped just slightly.
With a light pressure on Tony’s shoulders, Steve turned Tony until he was standing with his back to the foot of the bed, facing out. Reaching up high, Steve carefully threaded the leads on Tony’s wrist ties over the horizontal bed beam.
“It’s okay, Steve.”  Tony just held him like that for several long minutes, breathing in unison, stroking Steve’s back and neck.  Little by little, Steve relaxed into his arms, pressing more and more heavily against his chest.
Steve had brought him left over Park Chop Suey once—or maybe twice? He’d kinda lost track—but now he was ravenous. Tony took the elevator up to the common floor.
Tony nodded.  “Okay.  I’ll get those books to you first thing.  I was just--”  (Worried? Uncertain? Stalling?)   Tony fumbled.  “They’re a lot to take in.  I just didn’t want to rush.”
Tony was already on his knees; he could feel his cheeks going a little pink against his will.  He dropped his head down and to the side on instinct, then added a bit more softly, “I’ve always gone for brains, instead of brawn.”
Rogers was already in the kitchen the next morning when Tony wandered in wearing the same jeans and AC/DC shirt as last night. (Well “morning.” It was, like, 11 am, but whatever.)
Tony couldn’t bear to look at him. (What if he’d read it wrong? What if--) Tony kept his gaze fixed on the skyline.
“One time, we had bad intel—got trapped in The Black Forest for five days while a huge German convoy went by. No way to fight through, no way to get back to the rendez vous until they passed; just had to wait it out. We ran out of rations.”
“You like it?” Tony asked, voice a little hesitant.  Steve nodded against his shoulder and kissed him on the cheek.  (But, really, all this nodding is getting ridiculous.)
“It really doesn’t matter, Tony.  I’m truly sorry that I got ahead of myself and leapt to conclusions instead of just listening to your news like I meant to.”  It was strange, so strange, to see Pepper so wrong-footed.
“Well,” Steve said, “I’ll leave you to your business. The suits are really amazing, Tony. Just grand.”
Rogers turned to Hill then Fury with a nod and a crisp, “Sir. Sir.” There was a lingering pause as Fury and Rogers stared at each other. Tony wondered what Rogers would do if Fury ordered them all to sit down, but he never found out. Instead Fury barked an abrupt, “Dismissed!”
“Cool. See you later then,” Clint said, then paused for a moment. “And Steve? Good fight earlier. I—Yeah. Good fight.”
He clutched at Tony’s shoulder and hid his face with his arm. Steve held his breath-- he tilted his hips and drew his knees up towards his chest in silent invitation.
“Fancy prep school. I also know Ancient Greek.” Tony shrugged. “But anyway, who’s ready for a movie? Because I found a documentary about cats in Istanbul and it looks awesome.”
(Maybe Steve wanted to save himself for marriage or whatever it was religious people said.) Tony frowned at his coffee. (Oh, shit.) Jesus. (Ha.
When the film concluded with Osgood saying, “Nobody’s perfect!” Steve let out such a loud, startled laugh that he was afraid he’d wake Tony, but Tony was out like a light.  (Don’t move.  Don’t disturb him.  It’s fine.)
Steve flipped open the cap on the lube and poured some across his fingers, frowning in concentration. Tony tilted his hips eagerly and held his breath.
Tony tried to be a patient man—(Sort of. Sometimes.)—but Bruce was rapidly pushing him to the end of his patience.
It was odd.  Bruce was a great guy and, sure, he’d flirted with Bruce a little just for fun.  Tony did that with everyone though.  He’d never actually been interested in Bruce sexually and he was pretty damn sure Bruce was straight anyway.  So what was it . . . Was it that they were both scientists, both a little broken?  (Humph.)  That thought made Tony feel resentful on both their behalves.  And Pepper had seemed so sure!
He’d started to type ‘no big deal,’ but it was. This was his full contract. It was a big deal. But he wanted Steve to have it.
Steve leaned forward to kiss Tony's brow, then his cheeks; he placed a soft little kiss at the corner of his mouth, then on his lips. He stroked Tony's shoulders, his back, then reached down to undo Tony's trousers. The tub was almost full.
“Fine,” Tony said, curling up to put his head on Pep’s stomach. He breathed steadily in and out, matching his breaths to hers. Pepper turned her gaze back to her book, reading while she waited. (She knew he found it hard to talk about the Safehouse.) She turned the page.
Steve grinned, reached for his stool and pulled up to his little station.  (And how many months ago had Tony let Steve in? He couldn’t quite recall—it felt frightfully new and yet like perhaps he’d had a spot here all along…)
“Excuse me, Mr. Stark?” Rogers called out, voice loud enough to carry over Black Sabbath.  Tony was tempted to let it keep playing—Rogers probably hated it—but Tony wasn’t
“If you call ahead,” she said, “the next time you’re coming in, I’ll make Nona’s chocolate amaretti cake.  It hasn’t been on the menu here for thirty-five years; I only make it for family.  But if you call ahead, I’ll have it ready for you.”
Tony came up with theories about Rogers, one after another, then discarded them all.  They could never accommodate all the available data points.
Steve’s body was warm and solid; he ran his hand up and down Tony’s back. Tony rubbed his cheek against Steve’s pec and Steve took a sharp little breath.
He typed out “You’re sober now,” but then deleted it; if Tony had forgotten that conversation—as he likely had, being blackout drunk at the time—it would no doubt sound like an insult. Instead he texted:
Sorry for the short chapter, but I hated to keep you waiting and the next bit has been a struggle and now I'm off celebrating Christmas with my family.  I'm hoping to post the next part of what was going to be chapter 49 before my big interview Jan 7th (or right after) so although this was short I hope to have more sooner than usual.
"All the more reason to let me serve, sir," Steve said.  His heart was pounding in his chest.  (Could this really be happening?)
“Intro Chemistry,” Rhodey said, then added with a grin, “it was the only subject where Tones actually took the intro levels.”
“Well, shucks, I guess we’re both lucky,” Tony said, with mock bashfulness, then added with a rakish smile, “And speaking of getting lucky… Kidding, kidding! I get why we’re not ‘knocking boots’ yet, but I have truly enjoyed everything we’ve done so far.” He let his voice drop a little. “How about you?”
“What the fuck?” Rhodey sounded almost angry.  “Get your head out of your ass, man.  That is the last thing she’s thinking.  We haven’t talked about it, but I can guarantee it’s the other way around.  Like I said,
Steve took two swift steps from the elevator and wrapped his arms around Tony. Tony could feel the cold lingering on Steve’s jacket, as he leaned down to press his chilled cheek to Tony’s neck, arms squeezing him tight. Tony reached up and hugged him back.
