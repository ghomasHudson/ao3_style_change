Castiel had cocked his head to one side as Dean spoke, and a curious expression flitted across his face while he contemplated the meaning of those Freudian slips and wondered just how much Dean actually meant them. After a few seconds of silence, Castiel smiled sweetly and happily said “Thank you Dean. Just relax and enjoy this.”
“Cas, if you’re out there and have your ears on, it’s me, Dean…” he paused uncertainly and took a deep breath before continuing. “Look, I feel terrible that I never had the chance to say anything back to you before the Empty claimed you. I couldn’t think then- it all happened so fast, and I was feeling so many things at once and was too terrified to respond. Please forgive me.”
Then, astonishingly, Cas had hugged him back and whispered in a rough hoarse voice, “Dean, I love you too. I’ll stay with you forever, if you’ll have me and take care of me.properly.”
Dean thought silently.
Dean whimpered and his fingers curled in excitement, making him grip both his shirt collar as well as his cock. Without thinking, Dean instinctively resumed stroking his aching bulge.
- I promise! Hell
Castiel was already on the landing inside the bunker doors when the two brothers arrived, as worry etched into his concerned face. Castiel took one look at Dean, swiftly scooped Dean up into his strong arms, and *whump* transported them both in front of a large comfy armchair on the bunker’s main floor, into which he gently placed Dean.
However, after a few minutes of Dean feeling that kind of teasing, it all quickly spiraled downhill into the proverbial trash can in the gutter. Dean’s lustfull brain felt the sensations happening to his ankle and somehow translated that into fantasizing about those scrumptious wet lips sucking Dean’s cockhead into that hot mouth… that strong tongue flicking and lapping and circling his hard cock teasingly… how good it would feel to fuck Cas’ enticing mouth the same way Cas was intentionally teasing Dean’s ankle bone and quickly pulsating it in and out of his willing mouth.
Dean licked his lips seductively, began to loosen his belt, and purred, “How about you use mine, since it’s ready?”
- not on my watch! We don’t need those luscious lips of yours yet!”
Dean sighed and reluctantly agreed “Fine, bitch. Just make it quick, Cas. I can’t watch this.” Dean then dropped the gauze on the table and practically sprinted into the next room to get away from seeing or hearing anything happen.
“Fuck yeah, Cas!” Dean suddenly screamed as he couldn’t hold back another second longer from voicing his fuck fest fantasy aloud. “
Dean began panting heavily and continuously moaned and whimpered as his top hand moved a few inches over to the cuff of his jacket sleeve. His fingers then curled and clenched the material tightly in his fist, as he desperately tried to concentrate on keeping the rest of his body as still as he possibly could because he knew Sam was nearby watching them intently.
Jack said that hearing Dean’s prayers had prompted him to act rashly, so he had teleported into the Empty, forcibly stole Castiel’s grace, and convinced the Empty that it could then have the peace and quiet again which it desperately longed for, as Cas didn’t belong there anymore since he was no longer an angel. The Empty reluctantly agreed and Jack had promised not to return Cas’ grace to him fully, so although Cas would still be able to heal very minor wounds, he wouldn’t be able to perform most angelic functions, and would be a lot more like a slightly overpowered human than an actual angel. Jack told Dean to take extremely good care of Cas, to spend the rest of their lives openly accepting their new beloved relationship, and that whenever it came time for Dean to die many years later, Cas would be welcomed into Heaven to be with Dean.
* * * * *
Castiel smiled sweetly at Dean and curtly replied “As you wish.” He now fully realized Dean actually wanted him to continue this time, so felt confident in no longer holding back, and now intended to fully seize this rare opportunity to show Dean exactly how fine he was with moving their relationship to a new level. He pressed his tongue firmly against Dean’s neck and began kissing the area passionately, flicking his tongue against toned skin, gently sucking a little bit of it into his mouth, and very carefully nibbling a few moments before releasing it and moving a couple centimeters away to repeat the kiss again on a slightly different area.
Dean and Cas had refused to tell anyone, even Sam, where they went for their honeymoon. Everyone who was at the wedding received a photograph showing Dean and Cas relaxing at a beach in front of a gorgeous sunset while Dean showed off his engagement and wedding rings, but besides the generic waterfront there were no other indicators where the couple had honeymooned. After they returned, Cas had spoken adoringly about how refreshing and relaxing it was to lay on the beach soaking up the warm rejuvenating rays of the sun, and how he also had enjoyed stargazing and making love on a soft blanket on the beach beneath the full moon. Later a few raucous stories emerged about them thoroughly enjoying paradise at a private all inclusive resort which catered to all nude, gay couples.
made Dean feel and discover how desperately Dean wanted to kiss Cas’ luscious lips. Every once in awhile Sam and the other guys teased about Destiel being boyfriends, but goofing around with silly banter and jokes were one type of thing that could be easily laughed away as only pretend play, while it would be a completely different type of thing if their sexual encounter actually became a reality beyond simple words and both men eagerly enjoyed the experience and craved it to continue or even go further.
Since Jack had left Earth to go up to Heaven, and most days Sam and Eileen were out galavanting about while enjoying the outside world, Dean found himself alone in the Bunker as he spiraled into depression, dispair, and soul-crushing regret that his repression had stopped him from enjoying the kind of relationship he craved with Cas but had been to stupid and shy to make the first move, and then suddently all hope was completely erased as he’d never see Cas ever again- not here on Earth while he distracted himself from his anguish by hunting and drinking until he was fortunate enough for some monster to claim his life and put him out of his misery- yet then he’d be without Cas in Heaven as well for the rest of eternity. It just wasn’t fair and Dean would give anything, absolutely ANYTHING, to have Cas back!
Dean had kissed the top of Cas’ head and replied, “Of course I’ll have you! I thought you wouldn’t want me! I’m sorry I was too stupid and repressed to say that years ago, but now that you’re home I’m never letting go of you! Marry me and never ever leave me again, okay?”
Dean’s sexed out mind fixated on repeating certain words he had thought while glossing over others.
you don’t, feathers! You’re not kissing
“Cas, I’m fine. It’s nothing I can’t handle.” Dean gruffly protested as he tried to push Cas away from him and moved to stand up. “Just a fracture. I’ve had worse. Don’t worr…” Pain shot through Dean’s ankle the second he put weight on his twisted foot, and he instantly sunk back down into the chair as he whimpered pathetically. “Son of a
Castiel shook his head at Dean and smiled while he silently pondered,
The last words Sam and Eileen heard as they exited the bunker was Dean commanding, “Slap my ass red, baby, I’ve been a bad, bad boy!”
After a minute of silence, Dean reluctantly nodded and grumpily said “Fine, Cas. Do me.” Dean instantly grimaced, blushed at his choice of words, and quickly corrected “Do
After another short pause followed by the sound of a box being placed on the floor, Sam resumed talking loudly, “We’ll leave one extra large pizza for you and get out of here before I barf. I don’t want to see your man meat.”
Dean had laughed as he envisioned that spectacle. “Dude, we’ve crawled out of graves and Purgatory more than enough times already. Now the only place I ever want to crawl to is into your arms and a bed to sleep for a day.”
After Castiel had fully healed Sam, he gently squeezed Sam’s shoulder to signify that the experience was finished. ”Restoration complete” he softly said. Then *whump* he disappeared.
Castiel knelt down on the floor beside Dean’s injured leg, placed one of his hands gently on Dean’s knee, and pleaded, “Please let me heal you. Don’t suffer needlessly.
Dean’s whole body squirmed with pleasure as he thoroughly enjoyed all the enticing sensations happening to his neck and cock, plus the added pleasure of knowing that Cas was finally his lover after years of fantasizing about this type of sexual exploration, also intensified his bliss. After several minutes of this, Dean couldn’t hold back any longer and came hard, while his body jerked awkwardly and a large wet stain grew visibly on his pants.
“God damn it, guys! We have to sit on that couch later too- gross!” complained Sam in annoyance.
Castiel began firmly massaging the back of Dean’s lower leg with one hand while he sucked Dean’s skin into his mouth, lapped his tongue enticingly over the ankle’s protruberance, grazed his teeth extremely lightly around the edges of the bone, and began pulsating the nub in and out of his mouth while teasing it mercilessly with his tongue and very gently with his teeth.
Castiel smiled sweetly and replied “Thank you Sam. Your support is greatly appreciated and I think I may understand some of your references and what you might be trying to express, but I’ll let Dean confirm my suspicions before acting upon generalities or assumptions.” Castiel then looked back at Dean to ensure he was still happily accepting their play time together and hadn’t started freaking out or denying anything, before he *whump* vanished.
Sam had been watching the scene unfold with wide eyes while his mouth hung open in shock.
He chuckled softly, casually strode over to stand beside Sam, and gently assured “Don’t worry Sam- this will be quick and you’ll barely feel anything besides warmth and sudden healing. Close your eyes and just relax.”
don’t want stitches!” Sam begged through gritted teeth as he clenched his fists, tightly bunching up his pants into his clawed fingers while wincing in pain. Sam then dropped his voice to barely a whisper before continuing  “He’s
After a minute had passed without any sign of change around him, Dean slumped down against the railing and began to cry openly, deep sobs racking his shaking body, as the love of his life remained unresponsive to his heart-felt confession. Perhaps Cas could not forgive Dean and did not want him anymore. How could he ever truly enjoy being in Heaven, knowing Cas had interacted with Dean’s other friends but avoided him? He’d rather be in Hell that live eternity without Cas, knowing he was somewhere nearby but wouldn’t even show himself to the person he’d once gushed over during his teary confession of love and adoration.
But what the fuck had happened when Cas had kissed Dean’s neck to heal it? As far as Sam could see, it had began with long lasting kisses to a large area, but still it was only kissing, with one of Cas’ hands on Dean’s shoulder, and Cas’ other hand squarely in the middle of Dean’s chest. Although afterward Cas had moved to block Sam’s view, so perhaps that hand hadn’t merely stayed exactly there like Sam had assumed. Well, whatever had happened, Dean seemed to have enjoyed it very much, whatever injuries he had sustained had been healed, and even Cas still seemed satisfied with their arrangement, so it must have turned out okay.
Three minutes later Castiel applied one last passionate, long, lingering kiss to Dean’s ankle. Castiel then pulled back slowly away from Dean, straightened his back, placed both hands atop Dean’s knees, looked deep into Dean’s eyes, and casually stated. “There Dean, your ankle has finished healed. Do you have any more injuries? Do you want my lips anywhere else on your body?”
Although for several years prior, Dean had realized that he was hopelessly in love with Cas, but he simply couldn’t.say those exact words aloud, so instead had tried to tell the magnificent angel in other ways, through other words and actions, hoping that one day Cas would realize it and make the first move. When Cas had gripped him tight during their tearful goodbye, Dean had desperately wanted to say “I love you too, Cas. Please don’t do this- don’t leave me! I can’t live without you.” but he had been too shocked to properly express those thoughts- shock from finally hearing Cas’ confession of true love after Dean had been longingly pining to hear those exact words for years, as well as shock, anticipation, and horror of hearing Death literally pounding on the door, only feet away from where they stood, while being mere minutes away from the world ending in agony and terrifying chaos.
Castiel leaned back slightly, his lips parting from Dean’s neck, and stared at Dean with a questioning expression. He knew Dean did not need further healing, and although he realized Dean was highly aroused, he wasn’t sure exactly what Dean wanted from him right now, as during many of their previous encounters Dean had suddenly freaked out, converted his longing into anger, and physically left the room to hide and repress his genuine thoughts and feelings.
Dean slowly turned around to face Cas, his eyes open wide in astonishment while his whole body trembled and he bit his lower lip nervously.  Dean gazed into those intense, dazzling blue eyes glistening with tears, and immediately melted against his partner’s chest. “Oh Cas, I’ve missed you so much,” he sighed quietly in relief.
that was. I can tell he’s happy- that’s what’s most important- and his ankle’s fixed too, which is a huge help. We’re lucky to have you, you know?.” Sam then blushed and looked down at the floor before quietly continuing “Actually, that’s the happiest I’ve seen him in a very long time. Not just excited, but genuinely blissful, although I realize angels might not really understand the differences between physical arousal and emotional….Oh never mind Cas- this isn’t making much sense and I don’t want to confuse or mislead you, especially since Dean’s never actually admitted out
Suddenly Dean felt the gentle, light touch of thousand invisible things quickly envelop his entire body. He instinctively nuzzled his face into silky feathers which slowly turned visibly ebony as he carefully clasped them and ran his fingers lovingly through the warm pulsating, blanket which was now soothingly massaging his body. Dean kissed the feathers near his mouth sweetly and purred contentedly, as he snuggled his body into the firm figure standing directly behind him.
So many small, typical, everyday things Cas casually did would actually arouse Dean, and he was almost positive Sam now noticed it too, which embarrassed the hell out of Dean as he preferred to be known as a ‘ladies man’ and was scared to be labeled as anything other than absolutely undeniably one hundred percent heterosexual. He also felt extremely jealous when thinking about his angel kissing any part of his brother, even though he knew it would mean absolutely nothing more to Cas than dutifully healing a good friend, while Sam would feel very uncomfortable during it and would squirm away the second he felt healed.
Dean, I hate seeing you in pain.”
Just then a huge realization suddenly struck Dean like a bolt of lightning.
Their wedding had been a short, simple ceremony, officiated by Bobby. Dean had insisted that Cas ditch the trenchcoat for a day and wear a tuxedo along with the rest of the guys. Charlie had chosen to wear one of her beautiful gowns she acquired while being the Queen of Moondor and had showered everyone with flower petals as they walked down the aisle. It was very sweet, tender, and soft seeing everyone so happily enjoying a typical life milestone (which hunters rarely were able to partake in these kind of normal life celebrations), as everyone doted over the new couple while Dean and Cas only had eyes for each other.
Suddenly a gust of wind swept through the bunker and *whump* Castiel appeared beside Dean. “Good” he said cooly. “I'm pleased your hunt was victorious.” Castiel then looked at Sam, cocked his head sideways with a concerned expression on his face, and asked calmly “Sam, wuld you like me to heal your neck? That looks painful and you’ll need stitches otherwise.”
Dean wiped a few tears from his eyes and glanced around, but he was still alone on the bridge. He wondered fleetingly if Cas was silently listening or perhaps even standing nearby while remaining invisible, as he sometimes had done on Earth. More tears leaked from Dean’s eyes as he tried to fight back feelings of uncertainty and rejection, fearing Cas wasn’t yet comfortable enough to be with Dean or answer him. He openly sobbed for a minute before gathering the strength to continue praying.
Before Castiel stood up, he whispered in Dean’s ear “I hope that was adequate. If you ever desire something like that again, don’t hesitate to call and I’ll happily oblige.”
Ever since the night they had fought a witch who had cursed Castiel, Sam and Dean Winchester had concentrated diligently on keeping themselves as safe as they could manage to be from receiving brutal physical harm while out hunting and fighting monsters. Sam and Dean both agreed that asking their friend Cas to magically ‘kiss it better’ would be extremely awkward, although they each had vastly different perspectives why that might feel weird, especially if their injury required more than a momentary tiny flutter of lips against the injured area. Sam balked at the thought of his guy pal having to kiss his wounds- not only because platonic bros simply just didn’t do that to each other, but also because it made him feel like a helpless child where a stereotypical mother would dote over her fragile ‘baby’ and soothingly comfort him with kisses to his boo-boos.
As always, feedback is appreciated and welcome, and thanks for reading!
As Dean Winchester sat relaxed and splayed on a large comfy couch in the Men of Letters bunker, he gently ran his fingers through the dark locks of Castiel’s hair, mesmerized by the slow rise and fall of the amazing man asleep in his lap as his partner’s breath warmed his bare tummy. Meanwhile Castiel snored quietly, instinctively hugged Dean’s waist tightly while he slept, and fluttered tiny butterfly kisses over Dean’s tummy as his lips lightly grazed his lover’s skin with every breath that he inhaled and exhaled. Dean smiled blissfully and couldn’t resist leaning forward to plant a soft gentle kiss atop Cas’ head as he deeply inhaled the familiar scent of sweet spicy cinnamon which his partner emitted. This particular scent had always calmed Dean ever since the first day they had met, although as time passed and their feelings for each other morphed into a profound bond, Dean’s own longing desires mixed with Cas’ intoxicating scent ignited Dean’s lust too, so presently Dean straightened back up against the couch, not wanting to awake his precious husband just yet.
“You wouldn’t stop driving for us to look!” She told him, frustrated. “See we’re right here, and the US-20 is right here.”
A Siguanaba is a beautiful woman, one that lures men out on dark and moonless nights. She tries to lure men away from their planned routes, so they get lost. Appearing to be naked, or almost naked and bathing, she seduces these men.
The old hand-me-down Ford truck’s engine makes grumbling sounds as he drives to the apiary. His cousin, Balt, who came to visit last summer had teased him about the truck and how it would break down on poor Castiel one day.
When they make their way to the map room, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun” is playing out of the speakers, and Dean takes it all in. Claire rolling her eyes at something Alex says. Kaia leaning her head against her shoulder. Patience, Alternate Charlie, and Stevie having an animated discussion. Jack happily conversing in ASL with Eileen. Alternate Bobby and Jody talking like old buddies. Hunters from all walks of life, laughing, chatting and genuinely just having a nice time.
Dean remembers asking about Chupacabras, La Llorona, and Cadejo. His father dismissed it as his mother's misguided ideas, as if her beliefs were any lesser than a white man's.
Dean had shouted like an indignant child, his hands clutching desperately at the sleeves of Castiel’s trenchcoat.
But when Dean is 15 years old, growing into his body and his voice cracks, he encounters a Siguanaba, something his mother used to tell him about as a bedtime story. His father actually wets his pants in fear, something that Dean looks back on with a laugh. But this, this is something Dean knows.
"My mom was a bad cook too, I remember the night when my dad finally came back after being..." she pauses, thinking about her words.
“Come join me outside when you’re done putting on your gear.”
"I believe in your words 'I think I'm adorable,'" Castiel attempts to use his classic air quotes but it's hard for him since he's laying on his side, propped up on his elbow, hand supporting his head.
Dean’s brain screamed at him. This was another trick, this was Lucifer on the phone all over again. Dean Winchester does
There had been unspoken words between them, after Dean told Cas he loved him back when the Empty came for Cas. Though, they managed to get him back with assistance from Amara who had been freed from Chuck. Jack was finally able to be a kid, and everyone's lives became exponentially more normal.
“We’re almost at Bobby’s, I can take another 2 hour drive.”
“I don’t know why we couldn’t have just looked at this in the car,” Dean told the girl, shifting on his feet; he looked cold. There was a flash of light, the girl obviously holding a flashlight.
“Dean, we’re 10 more hours away.”
He nods over his shoulder, “c’mon. Everyone’s waiting for you.”
While Dean was known to save certain things for speaking in Spanish, it didn't only apply to Sam. He remembers calling Bobby, "Tío," at 12 years old. Dean remembers when he finally called Jack Mijo, and Claire Mija.
Over and over, until Bobby came to his side and put his hand on Dean's shoulder. A reminder they would have to salt and burn his little brother's body.
“So, how about them the Cubs,” Marvin jokes after Castiel’s mom leaves the house. Castiel doesn’t reply choosing to finish his coffee as fast as he can.
“Oh, yes, I’m Castiel Novak.” Castiel stuck out his hand for a handshake. Dean immediately brightened up, in return shaking Castiel’s hand with a strong grip.
“Glad to see those Yiddish lessons are paying off,” his mother answers, kissing him on the cheek. Castiel resists the urge to roll his eyes again, a voice in his head sounding like Meg tells him his eyes would get stuck like that.
Dean quirks his head at that, a trait he has affectionately picked up from Castiel, confused at that.
Dean leans into his hand like a cat and turns slightly to kiss Castiel's thumb. A comfortable silence rests upon them, the only sounds coming from the city outside.
“I’m not gonna get in the car then. Driving when you’re tired is almost the same as driving when you’re drunk.”
Maybe it's an astral projection of some sort, Castiel remembers reading about it in the library with his friend Meg.
Who cares about normal?
“No, dumbass,” Dean says with an exasperated eye roll. “I meant, like, if you and me weren't hunters, ya know? Like, raised in the suburban fantasy and Cas was just a boy next door and Eileen was your date to the prom,” he explains. The beer in his hand has heated up by now, leaving precipitation on his palm, an accurate statement to his well being; he feels like a sweaty kid asking too many questions.
(But when Sam came back, Dean's first words were "Estúpido hijo de puta.")
“Sometimes,” he replies. “I don't know if it would make life any easier, though.”
get happy endings. Castiel hesitated at Dean’s words, avoiding eye contact.
"Why'd you think that?"
Dean nodded, holding out his hand like his father taught him, "Yeah, I'm Dean."
The two girls shared a look at Dean’s words before laughing with each other. “Oookay, well, whatever you want is on the house! Courtesy of moi. I suggest the muffins, young padawans.” Charlie told them.
to be with you, in whatever way you’ll have me, because… because I love you, Cas… I really do
Dean gasped loudly and started at Cas with wide, questioning eyes as he felt his cock twitch excitedly. He felt as if a veil of confusion and denial had been lifted from his mind, and suddenly so many of their previous tension filled interactions made a whole lot more sense now to him.
Cas smiled, cleared his throat, and loudly said, “Good! Now, if you’ll excuse me, I need to have a few quick words with Sam and then I must promptly return to heaven. They’ve been calling for me, but this was more important to finish.”  Cas then strode across the room to stand a foot away from Sam.
Castiel took a couple of steps forward to stand beside Dean’s ‘injured’ neck and shoulder, intentionally using his own body to shield Dean’s chest and lap from Sam’s view. He placed one hand atop Dean’s shoulder so merely their fingertips touched, placed his other hand squarely in the middle of Dean’s chest, leaned in towards Dean’s neck, and very gently kissed the spot Dean had pointed to.
Sam froze instantly on the landing and Eileen nearly bumped into him as Sam's eyes darted around the common room below and caught sight of Cas’ head bobbing as he knelt in front of a naked Dean.
Dean propped his elbows on the railing, hung his head in his hands, and released a deep, long, agonizing sigh. He’d only have once chance to do this and although he didn’t want to ruin it with jumbled words or confused meanings, he couldn’t hold back any longer, so began praying.
It was an amazingly fun evening all of them would fondly remember, and Sam had immortalized it by taking a series of photographs documenting some of the highlights and shenanigans which happened, including the classic picture of Dean and Cas driving away in their beloved Impala, Baby, whose trunk was decorated with a sign bearing the words “Just Married” and strings of tin cans clattered behind them as they drove off into the sunset.
Cas raised his head to look up at Dean with a devilish grin and asked, “Will I need my angel blade for our sparing session or should I just grapple you without it?”
Castiel thought silently. He sighed, gazed back to Dean, and dejectedly said “Fine. If you refuse my services, I’ll simply inform you about the latest vampire nest needing to be exterminated, and then I’ll leave you to tend to each other's wounds. But I implore you, I hope you soon squash your inhibitions and let me heal you. I doubt it’ll be as scaring of an experience as you each fear it might be.” He then began divulging the information he had on the vamp nest.
Dean… desperately craved more contact with those lips as his cock twitched, eagerly longing to be touched again, demanding a sweet release.
Dean silently thought to himself and chuckled nervously.
Castiel willingly obliged by gripping his hand more tightly and moving it faster up and down Dean’s hard cock.  Castiel began alternating the pressure he applied to each finger and thumb, as waves of pleasure cascaded throughout Dean’s body. Castiel continued to pepper Dean’s bare neck and shoulder with passionate kisses as he rapidly squeezed, pumped, and caressed Dean’s throbbing manhood.
Dean would always remember how he had cradled Cas lovingly in his arms while crying and begging a litany of phrases. “Please be okay, Cas. I love you so much! Come back to me, honey. I need you! Please wake up and say something. I love you and can’t live without you! Please be okay and never leave me again.”
Dean gasped, froze, and held his breath while the angel’s piercing gaze seemed to stare deeply into his lustful thoughts. Now Dean… stupid,
Sam ran his fingered through his hair and thought silently a minute before nodding in agreement and responding. “Ok. I’ll let this one slide. Thanks Cas, for, um,
“Pizza man…. wants me… to come?” Dean stammered between moans.
you, and I want to spend the rest of eternity with you, if you’ll let me. Look, if you want to just be friends or brothers and nothing more, I understand and I can do that, but if you want to be more, I’m totally into that too, but only if you also want that, which now I’m thinking you might not want me that way since you still haven’t appeared, but I can dial that back if you want- I just need to see you and hug you and have you tell me that everything will be okay! Please, Cas, don’t leave me this way. Don’t run from me like I’ve always ran from you on Earth. It’ll tear me apart if you keep avoiding me cause I know you’re out there somewhere porting around Heaven. Don’t make me search for you cause I will!”
Castiel gently placed one hand on Sam’s shoulder near the neck injury, cupped Sam’s chin carefully in his other hand, and slowly tilted Sam’s head to provide more exposure to the slashed skin and muscle. Castiel steadily leaned in towards Sam’s neck, blew hot air over the blood seeping out of the gashes, and very gently kissed each individual gash lightly for five seconds. The moment his lips touched Sam’s skin, the wound directly underneath them instantly began to heal, and Castiel didn’t linger a single moment longer than necessary after barely touching his lips to gash.
Once Dean was settled into the passenger seat of Baby, he Dean grabbed a bottle of whiskey and greedily gulped down several mouthfuls to dull his searing pain.
* * * *
Dean suddenly slid his hand quickly out from under Cas’ hand in embarrassment and gripped a fistful of Cas’ trenchcoat.
Dean couldn't resist himself from stammering “Yeah. Um, my neck. Hurts real bad. Must be an internal thing you can’t see. But I want you. Kiss me here. Please?” He then tilted his neck, exposing easier access to more of his unblemished skin. He unclenched his hand from his jacket cuff and pointed at the side of his neck where it met his shoulder. He knew he had no injury there- it was a flat out lie- and soon Castiel would also discover that Dean didn’t need any healing and merely craved more physical contact.
you!”
Dean demanded that Jack visit him right now, here in the bunker, so they could form a plan to rescue Cas within a week, or else Dean would go completely insane, take his own life, and beg to spend eternity in Hell masochistically loving being torturing and also sadistically enjoying torturing others. If he couldn’t revel in enthusiastically being in love with Cas by his side, then he’d rather immerse himself in intense exquisite pain and drown out all feelings of love or positivity along with all happy memories shared with his friends and family. Dean begged and pleaded while tears streamed down his face, until his voice grew hoarse enough that he couldn’t speak another word. Several minutes passed in silence and Dean felt completely wrecked and abandoned, as there had not been a single sign that Jack had heard him as Dean remained alone, drenched wet from tears, trembling from emotional overload, while he spiraled further into despair and depression with each passing minute.
this! Sorry Cas, I’m a wreck right now. Just do this before I change my mind or say more stupid fucking shit.” While Dean spoke, he had shut his eyes tight, fearful to see the expression on Cas’ face as he couldn’t deal with confusion or rejection right now.
“Cas, are you here?” Dean whispered hopefully as his eyes darted quickly around him to discover family of birds had taken flight from their perch on a nearby tree, and the wind had now died down to merely a gentle breeze again. Alas, Dean remailed alone on the bridge.
Dean drank and cried, deep heart-wrenching sobs which shook his entire body and made him collapse into a heap onto the floor. Then he drank more and yelled many loud, piercing screams which echoed off the bunker’s hollow walls- angry at himself for being repressed and stupid the past few years; enraged at how Chuck, destiny, demons, and angels had molded his own thoughts and actions to best fulfill their own selfish stories all throughout Dean’s entire life; and absolutely furious that he’d never be able to spend another single moment with the man he purely loved, truly craved, and desperately needed,.
The reception afterward was a huge party filled with dancing, drinking, eating, and debauchery as everyone cut loose and thoroughly enjoyed having the time of their lives safely warded inside the bunker without any possibility of supernatural interruptions. Charlie, with her quirky sense of humor insisted on there being certain food available for everyone to much on, including curried scalloped potatoes, buttered peas, sliced wheat bread splayed open faced covered in cinnamon apple butter, and a wide variety of various types of pies. During Karaoke, she made everyone groan by filking bad puns to “Carry On My Wayward Son” as she sang “Curry on my wayward spud, they’ll be peas when you are done. Slay your wheat-y bread that’s best, let’s eat pie some more!”
Dean stared back at Cas in astonishment and awe, and squeaked out a simple “Yeah. Okay”
Castiel looked at Dean curiously, pondering his friend’s unexpected, deeply emphatic reaction, and frowned. Castiel then shifted his gaze back to Sam, whose mouth was now literally hanging open in shock, while his eyes glistened with delight, as Sam stared at Dean.
He exited the Impala, strode over to the bridge’s railing, ran his hands along the hot metal which had been warmed by the sun, and closed his eyes, soaking up this new experience while wishing he could share it with someone special, feel their arms embrace him in a loving hug, and hear the words, “Welcome home where you’ll always be safe, happy, and loved here in my arms where we’ll be together forever”. A single tear slid down his cheek as although Heaven was beautiful and he’d soon get to see some of his best friends and family who’d previously died, he deeply missed one particular guy whom he had feared he’d never be able to see again but whom he had desperately longed to be beside for eternity.
Dean felt soft, wet lips kiss the back of his neck before he heard a familiar voice whisper in his ear, “Welcome home, Dean. I love you too and am thrilled you want to spend the rest of eternity here with me beside you. I’m sorry I didn’t appear earlier- I was afraid you wouldn’t want to see me or had misunderstood that I meant I loved you romantically, not merely as a friend or brother. I’ve got you now though, and I’ll never leave you again, my love.”
Although Dean was genuinely happy for his brother, and even for Eileen too as the triad had been close friends and hunting partners for quite awhile, seeing the two of them so happy together often felt to Dean as if molten lava had been poured over his salted, bleeding heart as he felt lost, abandoned, heartbroken, soul-crushed, and also deeply enraged that he was now doomed to spend the rest of eternity without the one man whom had painstakingly dared to confess his romantic love to Dean mere moments before he was tragically whisked away to a cosmic force which fiercely sought to claim him forever and never let go for the rest of eternity.
Dean’s hand over his crotch twitched in excitement as he felt Cas continue to tease his ankle, and somehow as if they had a will of their own, his fingers started absentmindedly gliding up and down the length of his hard cock which was now bulging through his jeans.
Sam and Dean had each dealt very differently with their newly found freedom. Sam had taken to daily whisking Eileen away on fun, adventurous dates, enjoying as much togetherness as they possibly could manage having, not wanting to waste a single moment or take their time together or their relationship for granted, fully immersed in creating a joyful life together as they spent their days fulfilling their bucket list of experiences they desperately wanted to fulfill before returning to the bunker each night to be a sickeningly cute couple of lovebirds who constantly cozied up in each other’s arms, wouldn’t stop kissing each other, and.fell asleep locked in a lover’s embrace wherever they happened to collapse, which too often for Dean’s tastes had been somewhere in one of the common areas which had burned images into Dean’s brain of his brother in compromising positions he never wanted to see again and wished he could erase from his memory.
“Cas, I know you’re out there, so listen up you beautiful, infuriating, confusing, loving tease of a steely, intense, sexy bitch! I love you too, dammit, and I’m not gonna rest until I find your winged ass and pin you down until you understand what I’m trying to say to you- you hear me?”
"Beaner" became a word Dean was imminently familiar with.
"Aye, you're new right?" he asked, and Dean noticed he had a slightly exaggerated accent, one of a cholo.
Sam shifted awkwardly in the corner of the barn.
“So? I’m sure these people could stand to have a little more excitement in their life,” The first voice, no Dean, replied.
Castiel opened his mouth and closed it again. and opened it once more before closing it, resembling a fish.
“Oh! I know where I’ve seen you!” Dean blurted out, snapping his fingers in recognition. Castiel immediately flushed at Dean’s recollection, prepared to be chastised. “You got an interesting peeping tom routine going on,” Dean moved to stand next to him.
Dean takes a moment to look her up and down, taking in her multiple piercings, shaved undercut, the dark eyeliner under her eyes, her jean jacket with multiple patches (one being the lesbian flag), ripped jeans, and Doc Martens before looking up to meet her eyes again.
Castiel opened his mouth to say he already knew the sibling’s names but closed it at the last moment. He didn’t want to come off even more as a creep.
In a panic, when he notices that the face of his mother is a horse's, he thinks back to his mother's bedtime stories and he bites his machete, the one his father gave him for his 10th birthday.
Sammy opened the passenger door, sliding into the seat. She flipped on the car’s overhead light and opened the glovebox to put what seemed to be their printed out MapQuest directions. The added light revealed her features more, she couldn’t have been older than 16 years old.
It had taken a while for Dean and Cas to finally talk about their feelings but under the mistletoe, they kissed and ever since then, Cas had become Dean's boyfriend. (Claire teased him about that, claiming only teenagers had boyfriends and girlfriends; Cas should be his husband.)
Although their antics were enjoyable to watch, Castiel’s watch displayed the time reminding him of his internship. He cleared his throat politely causing the others to look at him.
Dean continues to give her directions on folding the tamale until Claire pipes up.
Suddenly, he moves away from Castiel to grab at his phone he left on the nightstand. Castiel quirks his head curiously, watching his movements.
One was leaning against an idle black car, Castiel could faintly make out his features, he had dark brown hair and a big leather jacket on. It looked like it was swallowing him.
A dog barks.
Someone yells about granizada para treinta quetzals.
—himself.
His green eyes stared into Castiel’s blue ones, almost as if he was challenging him, to say something, to do something. The moment broke when Sammy called out to Dean to hurry up.
The girl behind the counter was familiar to Castiel too, her bright red hair and proudly pinned lesbian pin on her apron were the typical characteristics of Charlie Bradbury.
Dean finally stopped Baby over an expansive bridge which vaguely reminded him of some of his favorite piers on Earth, where he could always relax, soak up the sunshine which warmed his body and soul, smell the fresh clean water which somehow rejuvenated him, and feel the gentle breeze blow away his fears, worries, and insecurities. Some of his best, happiest, most fulfilling memories on Earth involved when his friends and family had been near bodies of water, so now in Heaven he delighted in being able to discover what glorious feelings and experiences it might bring him to be surrounded by the peaceful woods overlooking a flowing river on a bright sunny day.
Dean moaned in appreciation and quipped, “You know it, honey! I can’t resist you. Wanna get more comfortable and have a little workout session before the lovebirds return?”
Dean relaxed instantly the second he felt Cas’ lips touch his skin, and a quiet moan escaped his lips.
Cas shuddered in Dean’s arms, gasped loudly, looked up at Dean’s face with eyes glistening with tears, and stammered “Yes Dean, I’m yours. I never thought you would love me back, but if you really do, then of course I’ll marry you. But give me a couple days to recover first, okay? I want to walk down the aisle with you- not crawl and pass out.”
Dean instantly froze when he felt Cas’s hand on top of his and panicked.
IRL, I'm sorry this has taken so long to post. It's been a really rough month for our family and I hate proofreading. Thankfully chapter 3 is already partially written, and it'll definitely post quicker than this one took . Thanks for sticking with it and being patient, especially in the chaotic world around us.
don’t want Cas to kiss me any more than you want him to kiss me. I just wanna get it over with as quickly as possible and not have stitches for two weeks that pull every time I fucking
Sam had to wrap his arm around Dean’s waist and let Dean shift most of his weight onto him so Dean could stand up, gingerly limp, and slowly hop over to the Impala with Sam’s help..
Then Dean drank even more, until eventually a half-crazed idea swam into his bleary mind. Yeah, it was a desperate ‘hail Mary’ level of a dumb idea, and he mostly didn’t expect it to actually work, but damn it- he was certainly gonna try! Dean felt as if nothing he was capable of doing could possibly fuck things up more than it already was for him right now, so why not enbrace being stupid for once and beg for what he needed, as the liquid courage had erased all of his typical repressions, inhibitions, hesitations, and attempts to maintain the stereotypes and expectations he typically felt he needed to live up to presenting outwardly almost all the time..
Missouri stepped around him, holding up the body paint bowl and looking up at him questioningly. Traditions were always an odd assortment of practicality mixed with exaggerated grandeur, but Dean wasn’t one to complain, not when he was in a great mood. He nodded to her and she started to paint the Head Alpha pack markings across his bare chest, arms and face. Dean was bare-chested and barefoot. He closed his eyes as Missouri traced the symbols across his body, marking him as the pack leader, as the strongest warrior and protector of their realm. The pack thrived under Dean’s leadership, following ancient traditions and honoring the moon.
Castiel dropped his hands and looked at his friend confused. “She ‘also?’”
Since that one terrifying memory had hit him, smaller ones had followed. None had been as detailed or powerful in a frightening sense, yet they’d been powerful in a much different sense. There were two that would periodically hit him throughout the day, lasting mere seconds, yet they always left him with a sense of eagerness. He would find himself blushing every time, and it was the sight of those emerald eyes. Never any other details, only those intense,passionate eyes regarding him with adoration and
Dean eyebrows rose at the question before he sat down in the stool beside the Omega. “Good thing you asked, actually, because you’ll see a few new people walking around in a few days. Some of the houses in the pack will be hosting.”
After Lily wore herself out enough to finally fall asleep, and Charlie had retreated to her bedroom, Castiel found himself in the kitchen with a cup of tea and Dean sitting across from him eating a bowl of cereal at five in the morning.
Dean rubbed at his scruffy chin and sighed. He didn’t want to cancel the trip for a
“Great. I’m going to bed,” Dean grumbled as he turned to the stairs. He wasn’t sure they would actually drop the subject but at the very least, for tonight, it was done. He just wanted to sleep and try to convince himself that Adam being gone wasn’t his fault… even though he damn well felt like it was.
Meg looked over at Jimmy...or was it Cas? Her gaze landed on her friend’s neck, and the large bite mark that laid there. It always stood out in contrast to the other scars he had. She had no doubt he had been brutally shunned by his Merfolk Clan, just as she had. She was sure it had been because of similar circumstances to her own, that the Omega had been involved with a lover the Elders hadn’t approved of. She had assumed Cas had fallen for a human, just as she had with Jo. However, what was staring at her right in the face…this
Cas could feel his lover’s hard cock pressed against his own, separated only by thin sleepwear. He suddenly felt a heated desperation of need. He pushed down his sleeping pants just enough to take out his cock just as Dean pulled at his t-shirt to pull it over his head.
Suddenly gunshots sounded, and Dean barely had a second to move. He stood with Castiel cradled against him to face multiple MoL hunters, including Raphael and Ketch, with their guns aimed towards them. Others stood behind them and watched on with shocked eyes, looking at Castiel warily.
“So, you’ll be meeting Charlie, she’s going to help you settle in. She lives a few blocks away but for the next few weeks she's going to stay with us to help,” Dean mentioned, gently rousing the Omega as the SUV pulled up to the house.
Castiel held his breath at the sudden intimacy between them as Dean’s voice caressed him. He blamed the full moon that was coming soon for these feelings, and hoped he wasn’t as flushed as he felt with Dean so close, his tone low and affectionate. He was imagining things… right? "Of course, Dean," the Omega managed as his heart started to race, and he was sure the Alpha could surely hear it drumming against his rib cage.
“It’s finished?” Castiel asked, his bright blue eyes wide with a hopeful glee that had Dean smiling broadly.
Dean nodded sadly. “Yeah, they died protecting us. Pack wars back then happened a lot more.” Castiel nodded solemnly. “But don’t worry, I’ll show Lily. It will take a few years for her to get the hang of it, but by the time I was five, I had control of my wolf. She’ll be fine, I promise.”
“Yeah, let’s go.”
“Okay Cas, I know you're not sick. Talk to me,” Charlie encouraged gently. She knew after all this time that Castiel was a shy and reserved person, and he looked pained right now, which worried her a bit.
Some of the anger seemed to leave her with his words. She crossed her arms and seemed to fidget in place. She was nervous and uncomfortable. He could still easily read her tells. “Dean…”
Castiel sighed. He knew something wasn’t right, there had been a numb feeling coming from Dean, and the growing arguments between his Alpha and Bela… He never wanted this, never wanted to be any kind of problem for Dean, and tears welled in his eyes as he grumpily rubbed at his face, blaming his hormones for making him so easily upset.
“One of our Eldest, Bobby, said he met a human named Rufus, a long time ago that had saved Karen from fishing nets, and he returned the favor. Karen is a giant sea turtle,” Sam supplied, as he looked over the man.
“I suppose I should address you properly, Castiel,” Rufus said, as he carefully made his way into the shallow water. “You were like a son to me. Scared me half to death when you would go into these flashbacks. I’m so relieved that you have your memory back…” he started, as he looked at the merman, with his scaled blue tail and an array of blue hued scales that decorated his stomach, shoulder, and his temples and forehead. His ears were pointed, and there were gills on his neck. “...and your true form back.“
He missed Castiel. Gabriel wondered if there had been anything he could have done to change that day his brother had run off and met
“Hello, Dean. Welcome to the Blue Moon pack.”
“So it's a long trip, I’d be glad to give you the ins and outs of the Winchester Pack, especially about the guys on this trip. We’re the ones you’ll probably see the most. Unless you’d like to sleep some?” Pamela asked gently as everyone seemed preoccupied. Crowley was clearly enjoying his drink as he sipped and leaned back with his eyes closed, and Benny was typing away on a laptop while Dean frowned at his cell phone and texted rapidly.
Dean looked over at him and took Castiel’s gentle hand in his. His ears perked up at the small gasp from the Healer. “How do you know I am leaving tomorrow?” The Dragon frowned. The answer had been there between them since they had met, yet Dean hadn’t realized it. He had not known that a true bond formed simply and without force. They had bonded when they had first locked eyes.
Benny hummed and smirked as he eyed him. Dean rolled his eyes; he knew Benny well enough to know that his burly friend had something he wasn’t saying. “Out with it Benny.”
No. No, no, no, Cas wasn’t here, this was a trick. Dean placed his hands over his ears and closed his eyes tightly as he tried to stay clear minded. How could that monster even know about Cas or how he sounded?
A mother grey whale, along with her calves, jumped out of the water. Jimmy gasped at the breathtaking beauty of the sea giants in this moment between mother and child. The calls the whale made vibrated and echoed among the low rocks, and made Jimmy’s whole being hum in response to its sound. As quickly and fiercely as the joyous and awesome feeling overcame him, a sharp and painful longing filled him. A stone dropped in his stomach, and he placed a hand over his abdomen in confusion. Every time he witnessed anything between a mother and a child, this hollow ache consumed him, as though he was missing, or had lost, something.
“Um, sorry brotha, you told us to pack up, anything special we gonna need?” Benny Lafitte asked as his partner, Pamela Barns, crossed her arms and stood next to him, awaiting Dean’s reply.
indicates memories/flashbacks
Castiel isn’t a threat in that sense, but can you blame me?”
“I don’t know, but it can’t be good. We have to go. Come on,” Michael growled out, as he managed to untie Castiel. The duo stumbled out into the now empty hallway as they saw the tail ends of the guards running towards the commotion.
In his fury, he didn’t see the other small fleet of soldiers aiming two of the vast bolts at him until they hit him. Dean cried out as one went through his left wing, and as he turned, the second hit Michael. It was a direct hit, knocking his rider right off his back, and the man he had been bonded to was now an empty shell in seconds, falling lifeless. Dean’s mind was now painfully blank and empty of their bond. The sudden silence was deafening and he turned to face the soldiers. He saw that Sam was somehow still
“Oh yes, everything is fine Charlie.” Castiel gave her his best smile. Theoretically everything was just fine, except his heart was racing and his mind reeling at what Bela just said to him.
“I know this is a weird new place, but you’ll be okay, I promise.” Dean had felt Castiel’s nervousness before he had even scented him and without a second thought had left a frowning Sam and made his way over to Castiel. “I’m sure you’re tired, but I’d like to get you and the pup checked out okay? Then we will get you settled in.” Dean reached forward and placed his hand over Castiel’s mating bite, scent making him.
Stuck in a loop, Castiel was on autopilot, going to work and coming home with the  eerie and painful knowledge that no one would be at home waiting for him. He was sleeping on the small sofa in his office more nights than not. Balthazar tried his best to cheer him up and ended up being the one who tried to take care of him, reminding him to eat, to shower and urging him to sleep as despite the pain in his heart, he still had patients that depended on him.  Castiel threw himself into the only thing he had left, his career.
Bela snorted. “True, I just, I don’t know, I feel like I’m not sure where we all fit,” she admitted and then stopped to gain his attention. Benny stopped short several yards behind and turned away to give them privacy.
Castiel truly felt they were a family. Soon, Lily would be big enough for him to introduce her to the horses. He didn’t want to frighten her with how big they were, although he was quite sure she wouldn’t be scared of them at all. He wondered if she would want to learn to ride them. They could learn together.
Dean was restless. The tingling under his glamoured skin was feeling particularly itchy with every step north he took. He could feel he was close. He knew it in his heart. This impending anticipation, like a throbbing hum that spaced out from the ocean floor to the tip of the hair on his head, was telling him he was finally,
“Mating Season is to start in a little while. Sam, I will see you at our special place,” Rowena announced. The large Cecaelia flushed, yet nodded his agreement before Rowena turned back to Castiel and floated over towards him. “Castiel, I hope you will feel welcomed here. We will have much to discuss after Mating Season, seeing as we will all be occupied. However, Dean, with your understanding, I would like to bring Castiel to meet someone. I’d like him to understand what his being here means, and what the possible war that will occur also means and entails. Have you decided how you wish to avenge the barbaric actions of the Merfolk towards your offspring?”
“Thank you Charlie.”
“Asa’s mother would love your head, but it's too repulsive. I’ll take your caudal fins instead.” And as Dean spoke the words, he took his halberd and sliced off the old Merman’s fins. He shoved them into a sack as Zachariah growled and clenched his jaws to keep from screaming. Dean smiled at him. The old bastard wanted to appear strong? Well, Dean was going to change that. Dean tied Zachariah’s head to the wooden pole with seaweed around his neck and forehead, and then two of his tentacles each took one of the Merman’s arms and
Castiel sighed as he went over another chart from the day’s patients. The Omega’s hard work had been paying off quite well over the last few years. He was a favored Doctor; established in his community which was no small feat as an Omega male. He had been lucky enough to meet and be hired by a Beta named Fergus Crowley. The good Doctor had decided to open a clinic for Omegas only in order to treat them without having the constant fears or stigma. This was a safe haven for their patients and along with Doctor Meg Masters, who was also an Omega, the trio had quite the steady flow of patients. After years of proving himself in an Alpha dominant world and battling a narrow minded systematic prejudice that viewed Omegas as secondary citizens, this was a hard won battle for Castiel and he was proud of their work.
Lightning flashed again, and Dean wasn’t sure what the hell had just reflected in the glass but that was no animal he knew of…it was large and…a rumble of thunder sounded, and just as it crashed there were no more monstrous sounds coming from the door.
Castiel tucked in Ellie into her blanket. Having her here on weekends felt so good. Having her laughter and the sound of her bare feet on the wooden floor brought the house alive and made it a home again. It mended pieces of Castiel's broken heart and sue him if he tended to fall asleep in her bed holding her close. Ellie didn’t mind and waking up with her was always followed by giggles and wiggles as he tickled her.
“Yeah, you’ll be able to say goodbye tomorrow with everyone else,” he replied gently as he continued helping the Omega down the stairs. One of Sam’s assistants was waiting with a wheelchair with a massive umbrella over it, and Benny helped Castiel lower himself into the seat.
Then he heard Sam shrieking in pain. He spun around, his tail leveling daring enemy soldiers. Some large wooden wagons with a ballista type of weapon mounted upon them surrounded Sam. Dean watched in horror as he realized there were five around his brother that fired a bolt-like spear, tearing down his brother, who screeched in pain as he burned half of them down.
“What's happening?” Castiel asked over the blaring sirens. Michael stood by him as he tried to keep the guards from aiming their guns at Castiel.
Dean had been surprised yet receptive when Castiel had asked if he could start having Ellie over on weekends. But the conversation had also been painful and had made Castiel feel completely at a loss as to how they could move forward from here.
“I will be claiming Castiel as one of my Omegas. He will be coming with us,” Dean informed him. The statement clearly shocked all that had heard him. Crowley’s own eyebrows disappeared into his hairline while Benny nodded in approval as the Styne Pack members looked utterly shocked.
Pamela was a petite yet feisty Omega. She and Dean had grown up together and had been through thick and thin. Dean trusted her effortlessly, and she acted as a bodyguard, which was a bit amusing considering how much bigger Dean was in comparison. Yet that was what made her so dangerous: she was bold yet unassuming because of her subgender. Any foe made a grave mistake in thinking she didn’t pose a threat. She and Dean had been friends since they were in diapers and because of their closeness, many pack Omegas, including Bela, had a hard time believing her relationship with their dashingly handsome Head Alpha was only platonic.
Jody’s eyebrows shot up into her hairline at his question, surprise evident on her beautiful face. “Oh sweetie, it’s for us to see your pup.”
“It’s not my problem if Emma doesn’t like your whor-”
Castiel waking up and not remembering anything made sense. It explained why Dean had been searching for him for so long. The merman didn’t remember him, them, or any of what had happened. The tall Cecaelia rubbed a hand over his face. He wondered if the attack against Castiel had caused him to forget, or if the Merfolk Sorceress had purposely taken away his memories. Either way, it was cruel, and he couldn’t imagine how confused the merman was up here on land.
Castiel melted into the tub. His body ached, yet the soothing hot water was doing wonders, especially on his sore back. The chamomile-scented oils he had found on the side of the tub only added to his contentment, and he heaved a heavy sign as he leaned his head against the curved edge to relax.
Castiel slumped down onto the memory foam mattress, feeling incredibly disappointed. They had only been at the resort for one day and now, their vacation was ruined. Instead of mud baths and sun bathing, his dream vacation had turned into a situation where they had to hunker down with water and food supplies in case things got worse.  Castiel had picked this trip in the hopes of fulfilling two desires, to be away from the day to day grind and to be with Dean in a romantic setting.
“Of course, sure.”
Bela came out of the bathroom in a nightgown and gave him a gentle smile before she came to sit next to him on the bed. They just leaned against each other and the silence was deafening.
He hated how much his irritation mirrored the weather as it turned sour when he wasn’t sure exactly where the hell he was heading. As he neared the dark clouds, rain suddenly came down in sheets, completely obscuring his view no matter how fast the windshield wipers were going.  The roads were winding, and Dean tried to maneuver the car to stay on the narrowing path only for the classic beauty to start sputtering.
Dean deflated and slumped back in his chair, letting the large leather family heirloom swallow him whole and feeling devoid of clarity as his emotions swirled around him. He was three days away from his own wedding to Bela. They were going to finally mate and all the preparations were ready and now… Now he had to go to Russia.
The eight members shared looks and glanced at Bela, who smiled tiredly at them. Slowly, they one by one nodded to Dean in reply.
The shy smile that greeted him with the nose wrinkling made his stopped heart race.
As he stood there, watching the Omega sleeping, a part of him wanted to go and make sure he was warm enough, that he was comfortable. He wanted those ocean blue eyes to be filled with happiness and that jasmine and sandalwood scent to swirl in content joy. Dean’s wolf stirred, wanting to nuzzle the Omega and fuck... He didn’t even know Castiel, there were acquaintances at best, and his wolf’s reactions were annoying him. Dean couldn’t believe this was purely on a claiming level… he felt like this with Bela without his wolf’s nudges, but this ‘itch’ was different and yet familiar all at once. Dean wiped at his tired eyes once more. Once he dealt with the initial shock of these events, he would have to talk to Sam about this, or perhaps have a chat with a mated Alpha from his pack to get a better idea of what he’s feeling.
His frustration and worry showed clearly on his face, and Meg took pity on him. She came into the water to reach him, mindful of Dean, who was watching her warily. Mating season was close, and Alphas acted all the more territorial with their mates. “When you washed up on shore with no ID, no clothes, and nothing to help anyone identify you, I knew you were Merfolk,” she started, and received a startled look from her friend as she took his webbed hand in her human one. “You knew nothing of the human world, and then, during the times when mating season would occur among our kind, you would suffer like I did, as an Omega merman would.” She looked at Castiel and gave him a knowing smile as he realized her meaning, while Dean cooed at him and nuzzled him, not having liked that Cas had suffered during the mating seasons without him.
Benny pepped up and smiled. “She’s good, started showing. I’m scared shitless.” The duo laughed.
Castiel couldn’t believe how beautiful the room was. He picked up a stuffed lion from the wicker rocker, held it against his chest and nuzzled it. It smelled like Dean and he smiled as he looked over the room. He felt ever so grateful to his Alpha for doing this. The crib was strong and sturdy, large enough to last for a few years. The bedding was plush and the soft colors that gave him a soothing feeling he couldn’t and wouldn’t ever want to be without. The blanket had safari animals on it, and he smiled as he spotted the little giraffes and elephants. Dean had spent countless days doing all of this, getting every detail perfect, down to the soft new rug and the wallpaper that made the room look warm and well-loved… Castiel turned to see Dean was smiling and watching him as he looked over the room. A part of Castiel hurt that Adam couldn’t be part of this, and yet he knew in his heart that his late husband would want him to be happy, to live in the now with their little one. Castiel couldn’t help but believe that Adam had a hand in making sure Castiel ended up here, in Ohio, in Germantown. Here with the brother he looked up to as a hero, who had stepped up in spite of everything to be Castiel’s Alpha, to protect and provide for them… Castiel caressed his stomach and yes, he was happy.
The consistent banging noise and the  ringing of the doorbell slowly pulled Castiel out of his pain and exhaustion filled blackness. He frowned as the noises suddenly stopped, momentarily believing he had imagined it when the distinctive sound of the lock and front door being opened made him sit up. He was still on Ellie’s bed, clutching her bear when his sister appeared in the doorway.
“Something is coming. The fish are all fleeing at high speeds, and even sharks are staying clear. Whatever it is, it's coming here, and the currents feel dangerous.” Just as Balthazar finished the words, warnings sounded from the Sentries at the borders. The horns’ sounds were long and deafening at the alarming urgency swirling in the water.
Omega.
“Dean, we have to talk about you claiming Castiel.” Crowley held up a hand to stop Dean from interrupting as the Alpha glared at him. “I know this is a difficult day, however that’s precisely why this is of utmost importance,” the Beta said in a tone of voice that made Dean lose his appetite. He saw Bela enter the doorway from the living room in the same moment that Crowley placed a suitcase upon the counter and opened it.
It was honestly what he felt he had with Bela, and this situation with Castiel… He knew she would be livid with him… The title of Head Omega had always been something she held dear Dean had always wanted to honor her with that… Leaders of a pack had to work in harmony and be in sync with each other, the Omega balanced the Alpha and vise versa. Now with this balance slightly off kilter, Dean had no idea what would happen, but he could trust himself to do the best he could to make everyone happy. Bela would understand and accept the situation after her initial shock, but first, he would need to convince Sam to understand.
The silence between them was deafening and the tension was wound so tight Dean felt like he could crumble from the pressure at any moment.
“Of course, I’ve known Angela for years. I hope it was alright for me to step in…” Bela replied as she rubbed her hands together.
“Dean,” Benny interrupted apologetically.
They had met while Dean had been looking for something to help him during a flight.  He had to travel across the country to be at his brother’s wedding. Dean had been instantly smitten with the blue-eyed man. He had given him his best charming smile that followed with a wink after the disheveled pharmacist had suggested a few things to assist with his air sickness. Even while discussing his motion sickness, Dean got him to blush. The light rosy cheeks and the way those blue eyes had avoided looking at him had given Dean the green light he had been looking for, so he immediately asked him on a date.
As the two lawyers squared off, Castiel and Dean’s eyes locked and the barrage of tortured emotions that passed between them was tense and painful. Castiel could barely breathe as Dean tried his best to keep himself from lashing out in his frustrations.
Lily was fascinated by nature. She was barely able to keep her head up, and yet her wide-eyed gaze wandered the backyard and edge of the forest whenever Castiel brought her outside. Her tiny expressions gave him life. He loved sitting in the grass with her as they cuddled and listened to the animals and insects going about their daily lives, not minding them one bit as they sang and fluttered about, letting the tiny pup take it all in while a love of life bloomed within her.
The Cecaelia Warrior had released all of the rage and wrath he had been harboring since the day he had found Castiel missing and their eggs slaughtered. The pressure that had settled onto his shoulders for so long had been lifted. Dean felt he could finally enjoy his reunion with Castiel, and give him all of his attention as he deserved. They could focus on healing together, work on their cave, and the Alpha could show off his gorgeous Omega to the rest of his clan.
can live with this… You already smell different… You smell mated and it’s not with me, and it's damn hard to accept this Dean,” she told him as she caressed his cheek.
The Omega smiled. “You’re a wonderful father Dean.” He was too tired to feel embarrassed, and he greatly enjoyed the blush that colored Dean’s cheeks.
As soon as Dean had returned, they had been inseparable. The two of them moved into Dean’s modest home by the six month mark. Three years later, Dean was the happiest he had ever been. Castiel was an amazing man, established in his career, full of life and wonder.  He challenged Dean by not accepting his bullshit and helping Dean become a better man.  A man Castiel could be proud of. A man Castiel deserved.
“Breathe Cas, in and out, slowly.” Anna could smell the desperation radiating off of him in waves as fear and pain soured his normally soothing scent. He was pining.
Dean nodded, too tired and too damn cold to care for her surprises or formalities. He was starting to feel irritated and he wasn’t completely sure why. His wolf was stirring as if something was wrong, yet he tried to rein himself in. He was in a hospital, where scents of fear and depression tended to run high and Dean’s sensitive nose was twitching. He did notice however the way ‘Naomi’ eyed Pam, arching a brow and seeming incredulous at the thought of an Omega, a clearly un-mated one, out and about. Naomi herself smelled like nothing but bitter Beta and Dean’s patience was starting to wear thin.
The resounding howls were deafening. Castiel smiled at the beaming Alpha and his heart soared as he watched Dean embrace Lily.
“Look, Castiel, stop this trembling Omega deal. You want him back then get him back. Stop with the excuses and do what you know needs to be done. I don’t know the details and it's none of my business but I do know this, Dean Winchester is a good man. The community loves him and I heard about the divorce like everyone else did. Cas, whatever happened between the two of you, if you truly feel you can fix it, do it before it's too late. Stop your excuses'' Jody warned.
There was silence between them, and the teacher mentioned something about Chicken pox and diseases.
But he's neither Guatemalan nor American enough for anyone.
She sat him down on the sink counter before pulling out a small first aid kit. "Now, this is going to hurt a little, but you're a brave little boy, aren't you?" She smiled at him as she pulled out a small bottle of hydrogen peroxide. As she poured the solution on his cut, she whispered some words under her breath.
"Thanks, Cas," Dean whispers, rubbing his eyes. It's not just a simple thanks, it's a thanks for saving me, thanks for being there for me, thanks for loving me even when I'm difficult. A hidden avalanche of gratitude. He snuggles closer to Castiel, burying his head in the crook of Castiel's neck.
"But aren't we Guatemalan?"
Logically, he knows it was just his amygdala being overly active and providing him with evocative imagery and sounds. Though, the men... they seemed familiar almost. A voice in the back of his head tells him that the man with the gun at the beginning of his dream, the one with green eyes and light brown hair, enjoys motel massage machines and greasy hamburgers.
"Want a chocobanano?" Dean offered.
Fiddling with Sam's left behind pink speakers, Dean managed to connect his own phone to the speakers. “El Amor De Mi Vida” by Ricky Martin played loudly, as Dean moved to take Cas's hand.
"It's just, I mean I could still be a housewife, you know plenty of lesbian relationships conform to heteronormativity."
The fear and evil spirit are instantly banished away from Dean and his father. Dean breathes heavily, getting down on to his knees. His father puts a hand on his shoulder, a twisted kind of thanks.
Charlie frowned, taking a moment to think about it. “Let me go into the back and ask! Be back,” She saluted at Castiel and the two siblings in the corner of the cafe.
"I would never want to escape you, Dean Winchester." Castiel replies, in his brutal yet earnest fashion. Dean flushes slightly, the tips of his ears turning red.
"Ha, ha," She says, words dripping with sarcasm.
“Castiel Novak, if you don’t come downstairs right now!” His mother yells for a final time and he rolls his eyes again at that, before moving to go downstairs.
That's not the only time when Sam is mistaken for a fluent Spanish-speaker, Dean remembers when he was in middle school and Sam came home to the motel they were staying at the time, proudly telling Dean he had been signed up for a special class. It was English as a Second Language, and Dean sat at the motel table confused. Couldn't the school understand Sam's articulate English and the way he spoke English fluently? While Dean struggled to pronounce words like Turtle and Bathroom, Sam could speak them with no hint of accent. Dean plastered on a fake smile, and pulled Sam into a shoulder hug. "That's great," he told Sam. Because that was all he could do, their father didn't care about their education and the way Dean had been skipping school, so why would he help to get Sam back to his regular classes.

“Ah, well it’s not like I’d even be able to find the station with this piece of crap-, I mean junk.” Marvin says, correcting himself at the end when Castiel’s mother flashes him a pointed look.
"You're so whitewashed, Wey,"
"Well, it's just, my mom you know, like she had this idea that I'd be this happy little Christian wife. Married at 24, and on my 2nd kid by 26."
Vanessa frowned at that. “You at least talk to them right?”
"You ever been to Guatemala?" Julio asked, breaking the silence again with a question.
"Smile!" Dean sticks out his tongue and Castiel smiles affectionately, crinkles forming at his eyes. "Perfect," he says, and Castiel begins to move back into his previous position, but Dean grabs his arm and links them together.
Dean still was outside the car, but he was on the driver’s side reaching for the door handle. With almost a keen sense, he looked up from where he was standing and made direct eye contact with Castiel.
Kids laugh from the streets.
"No sabe nada."
In the daylight, it was even more evident to Castiel how good looking Dean was. His dark brown hair and brown skin a nice offset to his green eyes and strong freckled nose. He had an eyebrow slit, Castiel wondered if it was just for trend or if he actually nicked his eyebrow. Then there were his lips, they were obviously chapped but full and light brown.
The clock read “1:20 A.M” now, he noticed from the corner of his eye. It was summertime now, he could stand to stay up a few more minutes but then he recalled his internship at an apiary a few minutes out of town. Wiggling slightly to get comfortable, Castiel closed his eyes to drift off to sleep.
☾*✲⋆.
Cas stood in front of him awkwardly, still holding Dean's hand and he seemed to hesitate to move closer despite the fact they had literally just cuddled in bed early that morning. "C'mon, I don't bite," Dean said, pulling Cas closer to him. He let go of Cas's hand to place his hand on the other man's waist, and used his other hand to bring one of Cas's arm to be around his neck.
