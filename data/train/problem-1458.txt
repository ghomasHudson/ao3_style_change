John jumped slightly when the wolf fell off the bed, the loud thump shaking the floor where he was seated. He swallowed thickly when he heard the low growl, waiting to be noticed, hoping that Sherlock wasn’t right when he’d been worried about hurting him. There was nothing John could do now though. If this wasn’t Sherlock after all, he might not make it out as lucky this time, cornered in a single room. The doctor leaned to the side slightly, trying to get a better glimpse of the creature, noticing how it was holding one of its front legs to its chest. He didn’t look like he was in excruciating pain at this point but John still worried about the carefully stitched skin. Whether Sherlock’s mind was present or not, this was his friend’s body; he couldn’t let the wolf hurt it.
"I've never met people like you two before. If you only wanted, you could have absolutely anyone, that's why I struggled with my mind for a long time and I couldn't understand why someone like me ..." he paused. He had to do it differently. "But since you chose me, I will not question your feelings. After all, everyone has the right to love the other person and does not have to confess why they love them." A quick glance at the brothers assured him that they were listening carefully. Suddenly he felt the weight of his words. He rested his back against the door, folding his arms over his chest and hiding his face in his hand. "So many years in the military, so many years of self-discipline and training ... and only now did I realize what a coward I was. I was afraid to look in the mirror and admit to myself who I really am and what I want. And now, when I can have it, I'm too weak to do it. In fact ... I realized that I couldn't offer you anything in return. I hurt people important to me, even if I know it and don't want to do it. If only I had left my pride and uncertainty earlier...". He had a vision of his years together with Sherlock, and how different their lives would have been if he had confessed his feelings to him years ago.
"I am" John confirmed. He tossed the keys on the armchair without taking his eyes off Mycroft's eyes.
"The newspapers quickly found out about this detail and called him Jack the Ripper. And it doesn't matter that we didn't find his signature on all the bodies. They believe that every murder in our city is his doing."
He felt Francesca's delicate and cool hand. Her skinny fingers tightened slightly on his arm. She looked worried and was silent for a moment, so he took her fingers and kissed the back of her hand. He sank back into the chair, smiled and rubbed his tired eyes.
The irony in her voice was too obvious for him to ignore. But where does this hostility come from? He had never met her before, nor had the pleasure of hearing about her. They had nothing in common. Maybe except for one thing ...
It was obvious that the dream was better after a stressful day, which despite the adversities ended successfully. Disappearing stress caused the body to relax, and calm thoughts helped maintain healthy sleep. That is why John was not surprised when he opened his eyes refreshed and relaxed. He did not even realize that his restful sleep lasted until late morning. He was sleepy and blinked several times. He stretched lazily on the bed and sighed. A pleasant chill surrounded his body as he threw the sheets aside. Mycroft was no longer next to him, but the barely noticeable warmth on the sheet indicated that he had to get up recently. The bathroom light flashed from beneath the crack. The door was slightly closed. He heard the strange noises of an electric razor and knew that Mycroft was getting ready to leave. He sat on the bed, warm air blowing over his face. When he opened his eyes, he saw an armchair standing in the corner, and clothes folded on it that he had thrown off the night before. The sight gave him a slight smile. He realized how much Sherlock differed from Mycroft in order and cleanliness. He liked both versions, although both were annoying sometimes.
“I’m usually much better,” John said immediately once they had parted. “At kissing, I mean. Like, way better, seriously, what the hell, the only time I actually care about this shit—oh my god, what am I even talking about, can you shut me up please fuck no I didn’t mean kiss me again even though I’d be totally cool with that if you were down to kiss a dead fish again, seriously what the fuck—”
John was sure he could tell it wasn’t just the movie. But Sherlock stayed quiet, didn’t push, didn’t joke about it, and John didn’t deserve him at all, so it was good that Sherlock liked someone else, really.
“Hey, Molly!” John waved at the barista, who paused from tapping something on the register and looked up, a smile breaking across her face.
John stared at Sherlock from paces away, and then it clicked so hard and fast it felt like someone had just roundhouse-kicked him in the ribcage.
John flapped his arms a little trying to gesture at Sherlock. “Maybe for others,” he scolded, “but for you, that had decidedly crossed the boundary of platonic interest. God, you said—please and thank you. What the
His words died down when Sherlock didn’t seem angry, or interrupt with a barrage of curse words and cutting insults, or pull out a gun and shoot him off the ladder. “Sherlock? Are you alright?”
Maybe John can hold Sherlock’s hand over the table of a crowded restaurant, and indulge in the feeling that no one else gets to have this. Maybe John can wake up every morning and bask, uninhibited, in untamed curls and bright opal eyes, exchange sleepy smiles that only he’ll ever get to see.
The bedsheets were Egyptian cotton, and it singed under John’s fingertips. He took his time taking Sherlock apart, piece by piece, luxuriously. He ran his hands down the planes of Sherlock’s chest. He traced every feature on his face, coaxing his fingers across his eyebrow and stroking a thumb past plush, parted lips. He let his hands grow red-hot in the way he hadn’t allowed them to in a lifetime of hiding. He sighed at the heady relief of Sherlock’s skin, chilly like the first freshly-fallen snow. Soft noises escaped from Sherlock’s mouth. John swallowed them like he was starved. The air grew hazy, twirling with tendrils of steam, and the room filled with the smell of smoke.
Sherlock stopped abusing their silverware and looked up to John, raising an eyebrow. “Are you volunteering?”
John ran to catch up to Sherlock. He nearly collided into him, veering at the last second so that he gave him a friendly punch on the shoulder before slowing to match Sherlock's stride.
"Why?" Sherlock said. "What is so utterly important that both of you are acting so secretive about it?"
“It was your fault,” Sherlock told her. “Hasn’t anyone ever told you to not bite the hand that feeds you?”
Fire was rarely known as a quirk. So unpopular, there hadn’t been a case of it for over a decade. The controversy was harsh, with scathing opinions upon its ability to wreak danger and havoc to society when gone uncontrolled. An arsonist’s dream come true. The elementals were commonly riddled with such stereotypes.
Sherlock smiled, his lips tight and his eyes tinted with something bitter. “Anywhere you want.” He took a step back, letting the porch light bathe over him, shrouding him in a shadow-cape of silhouettes.
He closed his eyes, a pleasant tingling sensation running through his body. If he turned his head a little, he might look at the mouth that was driving him crazy right now. The breath warmed the skin just above the collar. The purring voice teased his ears. He would see black spots, prints, and the only thing he could think about was Holmes, enjoying the moment with a smirk that never left his face.
"And yet we are not in control of everything." For the first time, the mysterious man nervously shifted his seat. "Let me reassure you. You helped make some decisions that will be valued later on. And some that may turn out to be... regrettable".
"Francesca? Dear Lord, I haven't heard your voice for so long!" Mr. Holmes shouted cheerfully. There was silence for a while as he looked around for his wife. "Honey, it's your friend," he murmured feistily. He handed the phone to his wife and gave her a loud spank.
The detective took a step back. He reached into his little vest pocket again. A gold watch flashed on his leather glove. "I have to leave you alone for a while, Watson. Keep your search. I'll be back in ten minutes," he announced, turning his face to the door. With the agility of a cat, he made his way through several rows of glass tables and display cases. Standing by the door, he put his hand on the doorknob. "Stay here and don't come out."
"I consider the body inspection finished. The rest of the information will be completed for you in the morgue," Phillips said, ignoring what was going on around him. "I will send you the autopsy report by a messenger boy. Now, if you please, Inspector, I will return to my other duties." He closed his notebook with a quick movement and walked over to the concrete steps where Holmes was standing. They both looked at each other for a moment. Finally, the detective let the doctor pass, and he went down to the yard.
"Buon giorno, signore. Welcome to our hotel. Unfortunately, I can not provide information about our guests, but if it is something important and you wish to meet Mr. Holmes, I can make a call ..." the receptionist grabbed the phone, but before he could dial the number, he saw a large bag that landed quietly right in front of his face on the counter in the porter's lodge.
John was trembling with the effort. He wanted to move, make even a slight thrust, but all he did was leave light kisses to the side of Sherlock's face. At this point, Mycroft's warm fingers ran down his back.
"Because unlike us, she didn't come here by private plane," Mycroft interrupted him and satisfied his curiosity. "They changed her flight time." He came to the door. He waited for John, who took a bouquet of white daisies, except one flower from the table, and followed the genius.
"Fine. Play something if you have to" Lucy was finally convinced by Josh's pleas. "But it would be better for you if it wasn't a song about some slutty Catherine again or about Miss Eleonora's boobs," she said, looking threateningly at him.
Mycroft was silent, staring at Aaron with a fierce face and slightly narrowed eyes. "And what if you make the data public? How will it let you... seduce him?" he asked.
Francesca accepted the bouquet of daisies with a sincere smile. She disappeared for a moment to put flowers in one of the many vases, then joined the three men on the balcony. Her apartment as one of the few had a big terrace with table and chairs. The day was beautiful, the chairs comfortable and the wine cool. John used every minute he had to spend surrounded by Francesca, her husband, and calm and relaxed Mycroft. Dinner started with a nice conversation. Mr. Coletti opened a bottle of white wine, which John found a bit tart, but he did not complain about it. They talked about the last two weeks, about food from different parts of the world, travels, a passion for architecture and art. Mycroft didn't say much about the last topic. He was not a fan of theater, ballet or opera. He became interested in the conversation when the conversation turned to more political topics. Franco was also interested in this. John and Francesca listened to this exciting conversation for a while, but the doctor was completely lost after a few minutes. Fortunately, the knocking on the door interrupted the ongoing discussion. It turned out it was the waiters who brought dinner, ordered by Francesca. Four plates appeared on the table along with a new bottle of wine. The men quietly and silently disappeared from the apartment.
"I know your passion for drama," Sherlock said, sitting comfortably on the sofa, "but this time you could have skipped this show."
"Oh, just look at them! What a Heroes, blast it ...". The archer once again signaled her dissatisfaction. "Saviors of the world! So eagerly push their heads between wolves' fangs ...". She snorted in disbelief. She thought for a moment but finally sighed loudly. "I'm in too. I have no choice. They'll say later that the wench chickened out."
"Oh, let's not be so formal, John. We have known each other for some time now ..." he said with a smile.
"John ... I am glad that we can finally talk. I would like to explain the whole situation because last time I could not explain the motives of my proposal. You probably did not fully understand my request ..."
The man's hand once again hid in the dark at the level of his mouth. After a while, he lowered it and rested it on his knee. "You have entered a confusing... perhaps disturbing world, doctor. Unfortunately, I'm afraid it is too late to return. We are unable to control the course of events to come. Your decisions have triggered far-reaching consequences". The bag opened with a soft creak of wrinkling leather. The man hid the empty glass inside. "My advice is... ", he began and leaned toward him.
Many words and questions pressed on his lips. He clenched them and shook his head. If Holmes did not want to talk about the professor anymore, he should respect that. He decided to talk about the thing they came here for. "I found a similar knife he used".
John felt he was starting to fall asleep. Before he did it, he realized, Mycroft wiped him dry, covered him with a light blanket, and lay down next to him. Lying on his back, he could see the ornate ceiling that flared up as lightning outside the window lit up the surroundings. A few seconds later, he heard a dark bang and then saw another flash. He closed his eyes and fell asleep.
"You know?" Molly asked, looking at John. She was shocked. She was pale and her eyes grew larger than ever before. John looked a bit confused by her question but nodded.
He felt strange thinking of the upcoming days, weeks, months, and who knows, maybe even years. Until noon he fulfilled his duties without any problems, but he could not keep seriousness. His closest associates looked curiously at his good mood. They didn't say a word, but he saw their smiles and glances. He was glad that although he had John in his mind all this time, he could function and work normally. He also had to admit that after such a pleasant morning he worked easier and more efficiently. He noticed that duties and meetings were less burdensome for him, conversations irritated him less, and he made decisions with a fresh mind. Sometimes he saw things from a different perspective, which surprised him immensely. Usually, before making a choice, he considered every possible option. It turned out, however, that a relaxed mind suggested other possibilities for solving problems. He was more than pleased with this fact. He decided to have lunch and see how John and Sherlock worked together after what happened.
"John, don't push your luck." Mycroft's dark tone would alert everyone, but not John. They had known each other for a long time. It was not a deep relationship and each of them had their secrets, but Mycroft knew John would not be intimidated. Also, he was very agitated by his anger. Mycroft stood three feet from him, but John didn't seem to notice it at all.
Mycroft slowly removed the mask he had put on a few seconds earlier. The mixture of emotions in his eyes was too complicated to be able to name it. He was silent, which made him seem not only like a hurt man, but as if he was about to pounce on someone and free himself from unspeakable feelings.
Lestrade pretended to be displeased at his words. "You're one to talk. I'm only a few years older than you," he smiled back. He seemed to regain his balance and strength.
"There is always a 'but'," John said with a smile. A sad smile, which of course was noticed by Holmes.
"So I have to play the role of a loving husband and avoid all kinds of meetings and conversations with people around you? Am I right? Is that what you mean? I should be your toy that you could show off? You know what, Mycroft? When Sherlock says mean things, I know he does it unconsciously, but you do it intentionally, which makes me want to hit you in the teeth. "
"You have time until evening. I would advise you not to let me down a second time." Mycroft hung up on his speaker without saying goodbye and returned to work. He still didn't look at John, so the doctor walked around the couch and went to the silver table. He was happy when he saw the roast with vegetables. It was still quite warm, which meant Mycroft couldn't order it more than a dozen or so minutes earlier. John looked at the plate with a smile and, ignoring the rules of good manners, grabbed the cooked carrot with two fingers. He ate the vegetable and licked his fingers. He looked at Mycroft out of the corner of his eye. He wanted to know if he had seen - how he would call it - his disgusting and uncultivated behavior. He was disappointed because Mycroft ignored him and stared at the laptop screen.
"It's partly my fault," Mycroft admitted quietly. "I should check every possible option and place. Earlier I did not think that he could have such connections in such unusual regions."
Of course, they agreed. Even Sherlock seemed pleased. He was walking next to John with a smile, and when they left the hotel and headed to the most touristic part of the city, a place where souvenirs could be found on every corner, he was staying right next to him. Not a step forward or backward. He was walking next to him, shoulder to shoulder. It was the hottest time of the day. The sun was shining in all its splendor as if pushing away the bravest clouds that were just trying to approach it. People passed each other on narrow streets, rubbing against and sometimes pushing each other. It was less crowded only on the water, where individual gondolas transported the lucky ones. John, Sherlock, and Molly wandered lazily through shops, squares, and streets. They passed bridges hanging over the water and filled with tourists equipped with cameras, but most often with phones. Someone was taking an amateur session, others were posing for professional photos. There was even a young couple who got married in a nearby church and chose a crowded alley with a view of Saint Mark's Square for the album's photos.
John pressed his arm against the door even more, blocking the genius from leaving. He couldn't accept that Mycroft was just going to leave like this, although on the other hand John understood him, and knew that this kind of behavior perfectly suited him.
"But why? I don't understand. After what happened last night, I think even he is serious enough to ...
"Tea?" the younger genius suddenly asked, holding a cup in his hand. "It's not too warm, but John went with Mrs. Hudson to get some cookies. If you wait, maybe you can try it," he said, then drank some tea. He winced clearly because the taste was disturbed by the fact that the tea was cold.
Attention! This is the first chapter in which you will have to make a choice. It won't affect the next chapter, but it will matter in the future. Think carefully about what you will choose and remember your first choice.
Yeah. Mycroft would never allow his 'husband' - even a fake one - to wear ordinary clothes. John didn't know much about the upcoming two weeks, but he was convinced the next days would be full of elegance and style.
John looked at Mycroft. His stomach tightened and he felt sick. A lot of extreme emotions must have dominated his eyes because the older genius could barely hold his gaze. John got up from the couch. He stood in a defensive position, i.e. arms crossed, and narrowed his eyes. "And how do you want to prove to me that I have no other choice?" John asked with hoarseness in his voice.
Francesca's giggle made Mycroft give up. Genius looked resigned. He sank into a chair and buried face in his hand.
"What are you waiting for?" John murmured with a thick voice. He didn't understand why Mycroft did nothing. From the very beginning of their agreement, John had already expected this possibility. He knew that there would come a time when they would have to prove their feelings to others. The kiss was not unusual for him - if he could say that when he was about to kiss a man like Mycroft.
John leaned back in his chair with an undisguised smile and amusement on his face. "What for? Will you answer this question for me? Because I really don't understand your decisions. Why someone who practically rules Great Britain, who has links to the FBI and has access to information that is prohibited to everyone, must pretend to be in a relationship? Explain it to me because I really can't understand your way of thinking, Mycroft. Why pretend to be a happy husband if you are not one?"
"Because Mrs. Hudson will have more interesting things to do than cooking eggs and making tea this evening."
John was taking a shower. Cool water ran down his aching body. He kept repeating the scenes from the previous night in his mind. He couldn't believe that Mycroft really made love to him. Genius was his best friend's brother. They were both drunk, okay. But that wasn't a good excuse. They crossed the thin line and reached for the forbidden fruit. They couldn't change it anymore.
Sherlock ignored the mention of 'regions'. He didn't want to wonder at the moment where those 'regions' were. John was most important to him because it was clear why Mycroft insisted on their arrival. They were to take part in the liquidation of Moriarty's organization to the end. He was also afraid that it wasn't supposed to be a desk job. He realized with horror what a task he and John had to face, and the knowledge that John was in danger was beyond his strength. He heard his brother sigh.
"I'm glad, John," Mycroft said frankly. "I've always known that you two were made for each other. I want you to know that you both can always count on me".
John wanted to be braver at the moment, so he emptied his glass in one move. He looked straight into Stoner's gray eyes and licked his lips. "Stop with this bullshit and tell me what do you really want from me. I'm fed up with this game, especially with a cheater like you."
The room, or rather the living room, was huge and as fashionable as the rest of the hotel. Opposite the entrance were large windows with curtains down to the ground. One of them was open and it was through them that a calming wind was blowing into the room. The gentleman handed keys to Mycroft and disappeared, closing the door behind him.
He saw the same view as twenty-four hours earlier. Mycroft was sitting in front of the laptop, and the bedding was prepared on the couch. However, this time something was wrong. Mycroft was ... different. It took a few seconds for John to realize that his husband wasn't wearing a suit, just a plain shirt, and sweatpants. This sight surprised him so much that he stood in the door without moving. Mycroft looked in his direction but didn't say a word. He returned to work on a laptop.
"It doesn't matter, John! It seems my brother confused reality with his fantasies!" Sherlock shouted nervously and he turned directly to his brother, who stood with clenched teeth and only now returned his gaze. "Just because someone rubs you the wrong way doesn't mean you can come and ruin our day, Mycroft."
John smiled. "Greg," he finally said, and Molly's eyes widened. It was obvious to everyone except her that she caught his eye from the first moment. Gregory tried to make casual conversations with her, asked about her and showed interest in general. John sometimes felt sorry for seeing that his efforts had no effect.
Aaron smirked and changed the subject nonchalantly. "I was in a hurry because I wanted to join you earlier, but I went to a 24-hour flower shop." He sighed, sniffed the rose again and laid it gently on the table. "Before we come to reveal the reason why I'm here ..." he said and looked at Mycroft with admiration "... I have to congratulate you. Your people are amazing. I knew they were fast but I didn't think this fast. By the time I got back from the florist's, they had searched my whole apartment. "
Now he had to take care of the mystery. He ignored John's shocked and confused look and focused on playing the violin. He closed his eyes. He put the bow to the strings and gently pulled it along the entire length. A pleasant sound spread throughout the room, followed by another. Sherlock loved to play the violin, but he enjoyed it most when John was his only listener. He played and composed for him. His heart was filled with pride every time he felt his eyes and focus on him. Slowly, he began to focus only on the sounds and thoughts of a friend, but the knock on the door interrupted him. He wanted to grind his teeth because he noticed that John immediately turned his head and looked at Mrs. Hudson. He dropped his hands in resignation and sighed significantly.
"A policeman with such a keychain will definitely gain more respect from the killer, who he will aim at with a pistol. Such a souvenir will give him seriousness when he puts the suspect in the police car."
He wanted to shout that he never belonged to him. It was a great pain to him that he had to admit to himself that despite his great hopes and desires, his feelings were never returned. Sherlock had no idea about them. What struck him the most was that everyone around assumed that it was the opposite. Constantly persuading and convincing that after all, they had to be united by something more than friendship, hurt John. The worst was powerlessness because he could not talk about his real feelings if he did not want to lose Sherlock, and it would happen if he poured his heart out before him. Genius saw him as his friend, ready to do anything for his good, but not someone who could win his feelings. Sherlock's heart was closed to him and nothing could change that.
The doctor began listing the victim's injuries, jotting down his observations in a notebook. "... parallel with each other and separated by about half an inch. It appears the killer tried to separate the muscles from the bones in the neck. The murderer cut open the abdomen, removed the intestines, and placed them on the victim's right shoulder. Also, the uterus and the top of the vagina, and two-thirds of the bladder had been entire removed. This is the work of an expert. A person with excellent knowledge of anatomy. From the temperature of the corpse, I conclude that the murder took place before four-thirty in the morning ... "he continued his observations until he wrote down everything that was most important to him. The confidence with which he did so left no doubt about his experience. He looked at his notes, marking the most important information.
Mycroft was still staring intently at him, blowing warm air into his hand. He looked as if he was afraid to make any other move. He literally froze up with John's hand pressed to his lips. They both felt someone's eyes on them. This person was standing in the large window of the banquet hall. It was as if they wanted to see how far John and Mycroft could go.
"Mycroft ... do you regret it?" he asked a little more carefully and calmly. The older man stared at him blankly, as if wondering if he understood the question correctly and whether it would be about their relationship. John had to know his opinion and wanted to know if Mycroft could turn back time, he would make other decisions. Mycroft didn't answer but looked away. John took this as an unambiguous answer and let his emotions take control over him. He leaned slightly towards Mycroft and raised his finger, as he used to do during emotional conversations with Sherlock.
Under other circumstances, John would have likely declined a similar offer, but not this time. The idea of a long walk home through the cool alleys, in a rather unpleasant part of London, took away the pleasure of walking alone. Besides, he had walked enough miles that night, which he felt in his legs. The fact that he had quite a lot of alcohol in his blood didn't help either. With relief, he followed Greg and clumsily climbed into his car. The inspector was nice enough to buy a cup of hot coffee for himself and John on the way.
"Calle Varisco". Mycroft's voice echoed in the narrow passage. He walked calmly at the very end. He looked at John, who looked back and gave him a mischievous smile.
"Whatever you wish. And by the way ..." Without waiting for permission, he gently pushed John on the mattress and hung over him with a wide smile. "I also forgot something." He bent and kissed him tenderly. "I forgot to say I love you."
"You are right. Forgive me," he said humbly when he realized that not only was his behavior regrettable, but he also hurt his brother with his words. "Of course I know you never treated him as your property. I didn't want it to sound like that," he could barely stand his gaze. He regretted that he allowed himself to be provoked and lost his patience. He wasn't going to hurt his brother, but he did it every time John was involved. "I'm sorry," he repeated honestly, so Sherlock calmed down a bit but turned his face away again. He was less nervous, but sadness remained. "Brother, you are scared of the thought that John can leave you. That you can be alone. He is your best friend. A friend who always stands by your side and supports you, although sometimes even I doubt whether he does well. Trust him. Last the thing he thinks about is to hurt you. Regardless of his decision, you'll always be the most important thing for him. I know it's hard for you to believe it now, but neither he nor I planned it. And if he turns out to have any doubt as to whether he feels something for me, I will immediately let him know that his hesitation means only one thing. We will forget about this whole situation "he ended his speech with relief that he had already done it. It was hard for him to find words, to express his thoughts. Therefore, when he had already said everything he was about to say, he felt like falling into John's soft and cozy armchair. The situation didn't allow him to do that. He was still waiting for Sherlock's reaction. For any reaction to his words that would reassure him that his brother understood the message and that let him conclude that he had done the right thing, choosing that day for a sincere conversation. The waiting was unbearably prolonged, but the atmosphere did not thicken. And that was a good sign. Mycroft knew this and knew when the action he was taking was going in the right direction. Now the most important thing was time. He decided to give it to Sherlock as much as he needed. As silent as he could, he got up from John's comfortable chair and, trying to avoid creaking floor panels, walked to the door. When he was about to go out into the hall, he turned to his silent and thoughtful brother.
Sherlock is on his feet instantly, fleeing for the stairs with the pillow clutched tightly to his chest. “Two meters away, John!” he shouts, rushing to escape the emotional miasma of the sitting room. John calls after him as Sherlock skids down the stairs, racing for 221C. “I can’t hear you!”
With a swift shake to clear my head and a sharp tap of the spoon on the rim, I pause, leaning forward heavily on the counter, and let out a deep sigh. Whatever it will be, he won't be the one to start. He’d need to be trusted to give trust. Especially after everything I've put him through. Even knowing this would open my own nightmare world for tonight, I realize I need to tell him about my own stories.
He freezes, jaw clenched. A hesitant smile slides onto the should-be-dead man’s face, almost a look of hope. John can’t make heads or tails of what he is seeing. As John remains still, barely even breathing, the smile begins to slip away, replaced by worry, fear.
“They favored a whip most days," I say in explanation, staring forward, resolved to remain impassive.
“Jesus, Sherlock, please tell me you weren't still healing when you came to the restaurant.” When I refuse to answer, pressing my lips into a thin line, John runs a hand over his face, pulling along his jaw, before moving back to pinch the bridge of his nose. “How..." his voice attempts to break, "how badly did I hurt you that night?”
I take a deep breath, trying to control my unsteady intake, my lungs aching from the pressure sitting within my chest. My hands are numb from the grip they have on the counter, having tightened further as he talked.
John appears in the sitting room doorway, and the welcoming smile falls from Sherlock’s lips at the tense expression on John’s face.
“It stopped being a game when he threatened your life. It’s hasn’t been a game for a long time now.” Sherlock’s voice comes out barely above a whisper as if he were trying to make himself smaller, hide from John’s wrath.
Reaching into the bag, John pulls out a stick with two plastic hands at the top. He gives it a shake. “Say something smart.”
Sitting at the kitchen table two weeks after embarking on their new intimate relationship, Sherlock chews on the end of a pen and squints at his chart. He details the results of the week to John out loud.
That night, the padding of footsteps eases John to wakefulness before the squeak of the door reveals a small figure obscured by the dark. “Daddy? Papa?”
“John,” Sherlock said through his sleep-grogged voice. The world dropped away from them, those eyes locked on his. They were no longer in a cab at night in front of their flat. There was no cabbie, no fare to be paid. There were no sounds of traffic or distant sirens. There were no streetlights casting an orange-yellow hue.
At that moment, Mycroft shivered. Almost imperceptibly, but still. He tensed even more and nodded, staring into Aaron's eyes. They both said goodbye to Francesca. Mycroft did not look at John, just clenched his hand tighter and went up the stairs heading for the apartment.
Sherlock must have been aware of how brittle he sounded in John and Mycroft's ears because he cleared his throat and straightened even more. "I thought you hated this place because of the music they play there." This time he sounded normal, though there was still a subtlety in his voice. He put the violin on the table and slowly buttoned his jacket, looking at John. "You stayed there for an hour," he said with a hint of admiration.
The detective nodded slowly. "I understand that this is a natural behaviour among people who are close."
Sherlock almost smiled. What was he supposed to do? It was unthinkable for him to leave him alone. He knew it would not be easy. It never was, but his love for John was stronger than anything else. He always wanted to be with him, look after him, and be sure that he was in no danger. It was difficult because they had always been involved in dangerous situations, but Sherlock knew that John was always doing the right thing. Of course, he had no other option. He looked up and took a deep breath to confirm his participation.
He turned his head and saw a friend who was looking up at the colorful sky. Sherlock's words surprised him, though he had to admit that Sherlock had stunned him many times, stating things he usually didn't say aloud.
Hotel The Hilton Molino Stucky Venice was one of the largest in the city. Very elegant and - as John assumed - incredibly expensive. That is why he was not surprised when it turned out that all the banquets and important meetings would take place here. A red-gold carpet decorated the hotel entrance, and the whole building was floodlit by numerous lamps. The interior of the building, hall, and stairs, leading to the residential part, emitted a cozy atmosphere, although the richness and decorations could make the people dizzy.
He shook his head, casting a glance at the detective, and took a deep breath. "You were right. The Ripper is showing off. He's not just killing for pleasure anymore. He's perfecting his art. We've got to stop him otherwise we'll find the next victim in pieces."
His friend was holding a bag, probably with a bottle. He gave him a quick but warm smile. He set the paper bag on the table and took off his jacket. "Something happened when I was away?"
John sighed, feeling a strange weight on his chest as if someone had put a pile of stones on top of him. "It is too complicated and too difficult. You gave me a choice. I never thought I would be in this situation." He looked at Sherlock, who had started to realize what was going to happen as the blushes slowly faded from his face and he was becoming pale. "Forgive me...".
The detective approached the fireplace. The wooden floor didn't even creak under his feet. He crouched down without losing any of his elegance. The remains of the wood still steamed at the bottom, illuminating it with a warm glow. “What were you talking about?”, he asked, putting new pieces of wood into the fireplace.
"Mycroft, I don't angry because you sent your people to follow me all over the city. I angry at you for not even having the slightest trust in me, you treat me like a little boy and forbid me to leave the hotel. You give me some funny book about manners and you demand my obedience... ".
He had never heard of it before. However, he knew of the detective's superiority over the level of modern investigative methods. "Fingerprints ...", he repeated softly. “Do you think you can prove the Ripper guilt using this method?” he asked, looking up. He knew the answer, seeing the slight smile and intense gaze of Holmes.
Mrs. Holmes laughed into the phone. She was grateful to her friend for her efforts and dedication. She was also sure that she was having a good time. "Between you and me. Do you have your candidate?" she asked.
"She passed us some time ago, not far from the theater," Mycroft responded casually. After a few seconds of silence, Sherlock laughed softly, just like John and Molly. General amusement did not bother the other guests who were busy talking and watching other couples dancing on the dance floor.
Molly sighed with irritation in her voice. "I'm so sorry. It's my fault," she said. "I let him take advantage of me and he wrapped me around his finger." She was angry with herself. So many times she promised herself that she would never let anyone manipulate her again, and yet she always succumbed to dominant eyes and beautiful words.
"That's why you surprised me when you suddenly jumped out of bed and pushed him out the door. You must have felt ..." Mycroft was looking for the right word. "... awkward".
This time Mycroft reached for a glass of water, trying to hide his slightly flushed cheeks. "You looked like you wanted it," he muttered softly and took a sip of water.
"No, you aren't. God, get your shirt off. I don't want you getting a heat stroke or something, there's no reason you should be this warm." he commented, beginning to go to the kitchen and pausing to turn back and open the window, despite his previous complaint. "My med kit's upstairs, I think it still has some medicine I can give you for the fever. Any other symptoms? Stomach ache, sore throat..." he called, opening the freezer and pulling a pack of frozen peas out for Sherlock's forehead.
The blonde hurriedly held his hands up protectively, trying to scoot backwards even further as the wolf raised a paw readying for the strike. “Oh God, Sherlock please, it’s John!” he spoke frantically, the worst thoughts running through his head.
However before the wolf could swipe down, its face twitched suddenly to the side – as if it had been punched. Then suddenly the wolf began to growl at something that wasn’t there before resuming its initial attack pose. But before it could raise its paw above its head again, the wolf’s jaw clamped down on his own arm.
The doctor swallowed thickly, setting Sherlock’s arm back so it was resting on his stomach. “I’m going to need to check on this right after you change, understand?” he bit his lip, looking over his friend nervously and standing up, regretting leaving his cane in the living room. “I’ll be right outside, okay? Just call if you need me or... howl I guess?” He stood a moment before speaking again. “Good luck, Sherlock.” He said, although he couldn’t bring himself to smile. He gave his hand a squeeze before releasing it, walking out of the room with a heavy limp. He shut the door behind him and slid down against it, burying his face in his hands.
Sherlock had to admit: he’d never been petted before. The soft feeling of John’s hand running down the top of his head and down his neck was divine; eyes closing unconsciously and tail wagging; he wasn’t too sure if he should be enjoying it .
The doctor had forgotten all about the phone in his hand and held it up to his ear with a hushed whisper. “Mycroft, what the hell is going on?”
John sighed again, shaking his head and turning to look at his flatmate. "Sherlock, you know, I'd really just rather stay home tonight, alright? Besides, I'm trying not to go to the pub as much. Been drinking far more than I should these days." he said with a shrug, not being bothered with the fact that Sherlock likely didn't care. "We can order takeaway, if you like. I can get you something for your fever, too. Might help."
John let out a breath and slumped visibly when Sherlock answered his question. “Jesus,” John gasped. “Why didn’t you say something?” he responded quickly, shaking his head, not thinking twice before scooting closer to his friend.
The black wolf snarled violently, its paw raised and bloody claws glistening like rubies. John took a sharp intake of breath, clenching his eyes shut and turned his head away as he waited for the strike. This is it.
The sudden sharp noise of alarm on John’s behalf caused Sherlock to flinch and his highly sensitive ears to ring sorely, his ears fell flat against his skull as he sent John a look of annoyance.
“Need I remind you that I have an experiment that needs to be taken out the oven in about...” he glanced at his phone briefly. “- three hours?”
Sherlock stayed silent curled up in his chair before getting to his feet to head towards his room. “It’s nothing.”
“John, I want you to promise me,” he repeated, still remembering that John hadn’t agreed to anything. “I want you to-” he gasped again, holding the side of his rib cage tightly. He took a few deep calming breaths before continuing. “I want you to leave, I don’t want to put you through this again.”
“No, I think it would be best if I wasn’t here when he wakes.” he explained as he turned to leave. “Oh and John,” he remembered as he walked past him. “Please don’t hesitate to call me with any other questions you may have.” And with that, he left the flat.
Sherlock was silent; too weak and sore to respond. Sherlock was used to being alone, alone protected him. He wasn’t accustomed to having somebody close during his transformations, Mycroft never stayed with him, nobody ever did. Mycroft never
“You can’t be sure, John.” Sherlock tried to reason. “If Mycroft hadn’t been watching, you’d be dead, I-”
The doctor continued to watch the wolf attack itself, yelping and growling until he couldn’t take it any longer. This had to stop before it ended up killing itself, or Sherlock, or however it worked. It took John a few moments to build up the courage, and it wasn’t even all there when he stood up, arms stretched in front of his body defensively. “Stop it!” he shouted as loud as he could, trying to scream over the wolf’s roars and stand tall.
John sighed out as he shook his head, continuing to rub at his temples. “Wait, if you’re a werewolf, how come you aren’t... you know?” he questioned, pointing a finger at the unconscious wolf on the floor.
“Just you and me, big guy.” he mumbled at the wolf’s still form, grabbing the banister for support as he climbed the stairs to his bedroom. Part of him was exhausted and wanted to collapse on his bed and pretend none of this ever happened. He wouldn’t be surprised if it was all some crazy dream.
Sherlock let out a whine, it was almost canine in sound and that’s when Sherock knew he was running out of time. “John please move.” he begged, the plead showing in his eyes.
The wolf’s howls of agony began to mix back with Sherlock’s voice; more humanly features beginning to show. Sherlock slowly began to get onto all fours, trying to allow the transformation to pass, if anything, just a little more comfortably. As the shoulder blades began to morph back, a sudden click of Sherlock’s shoulder blades caused the bullet to be expelled from his body and as if Sherlock had been under water, he gasped for air as the horrible rasping faded slightly.
John stared at the other man’s face, trying to read him. He wished he was a brilliant as his companion, he could seemingly read minds just by a line on the face or the ways eyes were focused. He had no way of knowing what the detective was thinking or feeling. However John did noticed Sherlock’s grimace and watched the detective walk past him into the kitchen. “Did you really have to be that hard on yourself? Trying to tear yourself apart?”
Guess who hasn't had great luck with computers recently? Me! So my computer completely died on me and I sent it of to get repaired and to fix it they basically had to scrub my computer clean and reboot it - no worries because I always backup my files on a hard drive. Only what are you suppose to do when your hard drive becomes corrupt... So the massive delay was due to me having to rewrite multiple chapters and get it the way I liked it again and ugh! It was just such an ordeal... it wasn't a fun at all.
John was currently sat in his seat, union jack pillow placed behind his back as he clutched at a cup of tea, cane resting beside him. He hadn’t properly spoken to Sherlock since the ordeal; the detective had stated he needed to go and rest for a few hours before John could ask any real questions. It wasn’t until several hours later that the detective descended the stairs of the flat and entered into the living room.
“Oh come on, I was only joking.” he said, rolling his eyes and leaning against the arm of the sofa. “There’s no need to be touchy about it. To be honest, Sherlock, I don’t understand why you’ve been acting like this lately. The... well, what happened a few weeks ago. You’re healing. You knew it was going to be like this. And it’s not all bad, you’ve got a case now. You shouldn’t be behaving like the world’s come to an end because you’re off your feet for a while. It’s worth it. After surviving a near death experience, mind you. You should be happy.”
John didn't understand - no - he couldn’t understand; he couldn’t know what was really going on. "John- I'm fine, really." he insisted but deep down he knew he wasn't. It wasn’t normally as bad as this, usually it was just uncomfortably warm but this... this was unbearable and his head! "I just need some water," he lied once more to his friend as he got up to walk towards the kitchen before completely falling on his ass on the living room floor.
“So let me get this straight...” John spoke through closed eyes, rubbing at his temples. “You’re both werewolves?”
Okay I really dislike this chapter but I had to post something! I hate the way I've written John, he's so OOC in my opinion but I've never been good at writing John >.< Ohhhhh weeelll...
“Really Sherlock? Your brother came in here and shot you right in the back. How did he know it wasn’t going to be a through and through and hit your heart? Do you have any idea how scared I was?” he asked, his voice rising slightly at the careless attitude Sherlock was displaying towards his injuries. John sighed, scrubbing a hand over his face once more, knowing he had to calm down.
“Aw, you shouldn’t have,” John said, and then hesitated. “I have a gift for you, too, but it’s in my room—”
Sherlock opened his mouth, but whatever he was about to say was interrupted as John leaned in and kissed him: slow, smooth, and steady.
Lestrade made a rolling motion with his hand, directed towards Sherlock. “You aren’t gonna…?” His tone was prompting.
John tried to ignore the fact that the space between where the two of them were sitting on the couch was decidedly not large enough for him to ignore. He felt like he was going to vibrate straight out of the blanket he had pulled up to his shoulders.
“There are three vials of chemicals in the drawer next to you that will prove to be highly toxic once exposed to oxygen in even the slightest leak. There are over half a dozen concealed weapons in this room alone. We are currently blazing a trail towards a dangerous criminal who has proven many times their capacity to kill.” John had turned around to look at him at that point. There was a very faint smile tracing his mouth. “I don’t think an open flame is the most of our worries.”
“I’d thought so,” Mycroft murmured, and leaned against his umbrella. The umbrella. John hadn’t paid much attention to it in their first meeting, but now he saw. It was black, but instead of John’s matte, deep shade of leather, it gleamed.
“Wow, way to look on the bright side,” John said flippantly. “I mean, I guess it depends on the person. So at least tell me something about them. Throw me a bone here. An—an olive branch.”
- John didn’t want anything else worsening the detective’s already sullen mood. He took a sip of the cheap coffee catered for the Yarders, wrinkling his nose at the lukewarm temperature, tossing it into a nearby bin.
John breathed out a small chuckle. “It takes a lot more than Sherlock Holmes baring his teeth to frighten me.” He joked. The doctor understood why Sherlock had done what he did. He was frustrated and probably wasn’t used to have company during his transformation, so was most likely not accustomed to a human watching his every movement and action. If John hadn’t had been there, he suspected that Sherlock wouldn’t have realised half the ‘wolfish’ things he had done. Maybe John had been wrong about making Sherlock stay in the flat, what if he needed his space, what if he needed space to just be a wolf and not the human John tried to see in him. God,
“It’s just the Wolfsbane that was coated on the bullet.” Sherlock assured tiredly. “It’s toxic, causes respiratory problems when inhaled or when it comes into contact with blood.”
“You still shouldn’t have to deal with this – you still shouldn’t have found out.” he repeated weakly.
John was suddenly wide awake, cringing at the sudden whines and screams, feeling incredibly light-headed again. It was terrifying, almost as upsetting as seeing his fellow soldiers die in Afghanistan. That, however, he’d had time to prepare for. This... this was impossible, shocking, and he wasn’t sure he could recover so easily.
John held his breath when the wolf got onto its feet, padding slowly round the corner of the bed to face him at the other end on the room. He didn’t try to speak again, not sure anymore if he wanted to catch the wolf’s attention. When the wolf looked up, John stared into its eyes. It was odd; he could have sworn they were a sinister shade of yellow last time. He saw Sherlock’s brilliant eyes against the fur, clear blue and... he saw shame? The army doctor’s expression softened slightly, frowning when the wolf looked away and moved to the other side of the bed, curling up on the floor. “Sherlock?” John said quietly, although he didn’t move from his spot.
Part of John wanted to press his ear against the door and listen to everything even though he knew how upsetting it would be. He could hear Sherlock whimpering quietly and it took all of his strength to trust him and stay outside. However he nearly lost that strength when he heard Sherlock scream, breath catching in his throat, his hand darted to the doorknob. He gripped it tightly, cringing at every sound of snapping bone and tearing flesh. He prayed none of it was harmful and Sherlock wasn’t in trouble, but even so, what could he do? This was beyond his control. Sherlock was a werewolf. This was apparently normal for the detective.
Mycroft turned round to face John. “You were simply here; he had something to fight for.” Mycroft paused. “I don’t think you realise that my brother cares for you, Doctor Watson.”
“Stop. Look, stop! Don’t go wrecking the flat. If you want something I’ll get it for you, alright?” John stated as he pushed Sherlock’s side, the detective’s size and weight making it extremely difficult to move him. “Why are you so heavy?” John muttered through a clenched jaw, leaning harder against Sherlock in an attempt to move him. “Move!”
him – at least not in the way Sherlock needed. Sherlock needed somebody to help him see that he wasn’t a freak, that his mutation wasn’t all bad. He needed somebody to believe in him, to believe that he wasn’t a monster...
John stared at Sherlock silently, trying to work out what was going on in that big head of his. “Let’s just get you to your room, okay? I don’t want you having to change on the floor this time.” he smiled as he wrapped one of his arms around Sherlock’s waist and helped him to his feet and guided him towards his room.
Of all the people John had witnessed in agony in his days at war, he could have argued that Sherlock looked worse. The supernatural aspect of this only added to it, every change in Sherlock’s body bordering on impossible, something that a human would never expect to see. He could see Sherlock’s body compressing itself, shrinking, crushing the expanded organs inside until they too changed to fit. He couldn’t bring himself to look away, no matter how horrifying it was. His bones made sickening cracking sounds as they snapped into place, rearranging themselves, swollen muscles seemed to dissolve under his skin, all the while the black fur thinned all over his body - except for the select human places where it was meant to exist.
Sherlock sighed gently as he looked down at his arm. “It would have killed you. If I hadn’t had intervened I would have woken up to your dead body.” He admitted solemnly. “And I suppose I intervened for more selfish reasons than heroic – I wouldn’t have been able to live with the guilt, I didn’t want to live with the knowledge that I had let it kill you.” The detective let out another sigh as looked up at John. “And even if by some miracle it hadn’t managed to kill you, I didn’t want to be the reason you’d change, the reason why your life wouldn’t be the same.”
However, before John could react, Sherlock had started to moan in intense agony as his body began to convulse from the pain he was in. John hurriedly set the phone down on the ground and proceeded to roll the detective onto his side to prevent him chocking on possible vomit.
“You’re supposed to be on a date with your secret santa, you can’t do that to the poor guy.” John firmly shook his head. “God, I’m so glad we decided to act this out beforehand.”
When John held him while he bled out in the hot desert sand, staining the grains a brilliant scarlet, Helders looked up at John and smiled. He raised a hand until his trembling fingertips touched John’s cheek.
The only person second to John who saw past Sherlock’s sleet-slick mask was probably Mrs. Hudson, who brought them tea and hand-baked biscuits with an affectionate smile as she watched Sherlock duck his head down to give John his afternoon kiss, before thanking Mrs. Hudson and complimenting her on her baking.
“You—I—oh, my—” John shook his head as if to shake the torrent of words in his throat into a more coherent order. “I can’t believe it. Seriously? I mean, really? Me? You would—with me?” Okay, so maybe they were still a bit tangled up.
John kissed the freckle on the side of Sherlock’s eyebrow, leaned into the warmth, and closed his eyes. Merry Christmas, indeed.
They were fifteen minutes away from the nearest shelter, the run-down cabin with a fireplace filled with rotting logs where they’d found the first few bodies. John had already called for reinforcements. Scotland Yard would arrive faster, but not fast enough.
worth fifteen percent of your mark.” Mrs. Darcy took the time to sweep her piercing grey gaze across the class of students. “Stations are first-come, first-serve. Chemicals are in the back and equipment is here at the front. I’ll be choosing your lab partners for this.” She raised the clipboard in her hands, and began to read. “Miriam and Tom. Trevor and Harry.”
As if they didn’t have everything she had to say memorized (which wasn’t an exaggeration—lunch-hour teacher complaints wouldn’t be complete without one of Mrs. Darcy’s students, past or current, reciting the infamous pre-lab speech completely verbatim). Honestly, you would think that, rather than Twelfth Year, they were
Peter Hochins was the suspect behind a whole boatload of foul play, and over the course of the past few days they had run him down to the quick, but he was still nowhere to be found.
Sherlock remained still. “He was my first relationship. I was in university and I was… inexperienced.”
And Amanda was hugging Graham, now, her face streaked with tears that hadn’t fallen since she was fifteen. John felt more like Iris at the moment—snivelling at the slightest mishap. God, he was a mess.
He stayed quiet until they had taken a seat. “I don’t know about your secret santa, but I’d definitely be jealous if my date was talking to the barista like that.”
Right before he could move, Sherlock’s hand came up to cover his again, stopping his motion. “You need to swirl the flask at the same time,” he explained.
Mrs. Hudson’s cat was named Chainsaw. It was her husband’s idea. (The first suggestion had been Cocaine, which was a head-in-the-door salesman technique if Sherlock ever heard one.) Chainsaw had been, as per Mrs. Hudson’s words herself, one bloody hell of a cat—muttered with an odd, disparaging fondness as she helped the two of them carry up boxes upon boxes of cat toys and old, smelly bags of litter.
“I checked! I did all the tests, Molly, and everything came out clean!” John’s voice rose in panic. “I don’t know what’s wrong with him!”
“Nope,” John said stubbornly. “I’m fine.” As if deliberately proving him wrong, his beaker gleefully tilted in the wrong way again.
Their chatter was casual as they ambled along. “Who’d want a flatmate like me?” John had asked, dry and scalding, and Mike tilted his head and got a glint in his eye.
“OK, here’s the plan,” John said. “Imagine this. He’s received his gift and now you’re going out for hot chocolate with him.” He patted down his chest and with a grin. “Exhibit A, your fake secret santa.”
(god, even his own mind was turning against him) and that explanation was so many words that it all got caught up again and John swallowed, his throat gummy and dry.
Helders was golden-haired and freckled, with jellybean green eyes and a smile that could melt the harshest of commanders. He wiped the tables in poker like nobody’s business. John spent heady summer nights sitting on sand dunes next to him, gazing at smoke-splattered stars in the sky. John told Helders about how Harry could pour water into a glass and by the time it was full it wasn’t water, but apple cider—or hot chocolate, or tea, or vodka. Helders told John about his wife, and how all she needed to do was run her hands down an instrument and it would sing for her, wood, brass, or string.
She kissed him again, gently, and John hesitated for a minute before he raised his trembling hands and peeled them off his fingers, inch by inch exposing skin that was eggshell-pale, having not seen the sun in years.
Emma canted her head. “Well, it won’t be as genuine if I tell you right now. I’d like to record it while asking, if you don’t mind. But if you change your mind at any time, I’ll delete all the footage right away.”
button with a dramatic air of triumph, spoke into the phone, “Ten percent bonus if you can get it here by noon,” and glanced up to smile at him. “Hello, John,” he said. “Happy birthday.”
Goddamnit, John thought with a sinking resignation in his gut. There was no way Sherlock, cool calm and collected Sherlock, analytical over emotional Sherlock, logic above heart Sherlock, would have a crush. Just the words
They were in a forest. The world shimmered with a thick layer of frost, a tranquil white wonderland. The noises of the streets were subdued and softened by the snow. John’s winter boots sunk into the ground with a slow crackling crunch.
By the time he was walking the short few blocks from the station to their flat, he had unknowingly broken into a speed walk. He made it home in record time.
“That’s so cute,” Emma said, oblivious to John’s emotional angst. “Now, for the next part of this film. You can decline if you really want, but I highly suggest that you follow through—especially after everything I’ve heard so far.”
John’s mother nearly earned the title herself, her protectiveness over her son was so fierce and so complete. She took her son’s hands in her own and stroked them gently, caressed them with the softest of touches, murmured that he was perfect and strong and beautiful, her beautiful boy. When he came to her with teary eyes and a runny nose, his collar singed and his hands clenched sharply behind his back, she coaxed them out from hiding. Kissed his palms, and taught him to control his breathing, to let his mind relax, let the anger dissipate into the air, swirling like smoke from a blown-out match. She sang to him on sleepless nights and soothed his frustration with an ocean-deep melody. Their dining table was freckled with blacked-out burns. His mother called them beauty marks.
Sherlock looked like he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. It was heavily relatable. “Yes, you are.”
Holy shit, he was so friendzoned he was being used as a placeholder for the real thing. “Yeah,” John said, his voice strained. “That’ll do it.”
Right before John shut the door to the washroom, he heard the pitter-patter of hurried slippers down the stairs.
He extended his own hand until John, with fingers that were still just slightly shaking, pushed the matching ring onto Sherlock’s slender finger. Satisfied, Sherlock then laced their left hands together, the familiar feeling sending waves of comfort through them both.
“Oh,” Molly said, still looking confused. “No, Sherlock just does that.” She shrugged as she watched Sherlock stick a hand into Smith where no hand should ever stick.
John shut his mouth with a click and shot Sherlock a bit of an exasperated look. “I’ve told you this before—it’s a rhetorical question. You’re supposed to ask
call, and all of a sudden he’s getting 1-800s like a stampede of overattached parents. Ones who were adamant that his nonexistent CIBC bank account has been compromised, and to please provide his credit card info to avoid additional losses.
"You asked," Irene said innocently. She swung her backpack onto the ground before dropping into the chair next to him. "But anyway, have you?"
“And that is exactly why she is coming home with us,” John clipped out, that flinty-eyed stare daring Sherlock to argue, razor blades on his tongue fresh off the whetstone, and Sherlock sighed. He looked back at the kitten, who seemed to be awake, now—a pair of tiny twitching ears poking out of the bundle of fur. One of them had a patch of orange like a sunspot. John made a noise that could not have been described as anything other than a coo, and stroked her ears.
Sherlock seemed like he wanted to say something, but then decided against it. He turned his attention back to the movie. John tried desperately to do the same himself.
The feeling of the heavy wool laced with Sherlock’s scent surrounding him completely had coaxed up the heady beginnings of hope, which had gradually grown, though hidden, into a dancing, whirling bundle of helpless yearning, the burning strands of
John was flabbergasted. Sherlock had three moods: sarcastic, sulking, and sad. Who was this miracle worker?
John put an arm around the other, pulling him in close. He tucked his face into Sherlock’s hair and inhaled the sweet, fresh scent, the familiar brisk sharpness one carried after being outside too long on a perpetual winter’s walk. No other word for it than
Sebastian steepled his fingers. “Is that what you really think, John? You’re blindsided. I was like you too, once, you know? Sherlock and I go way back. I’m only trying to be helpful. Advice for a rookie.” He sighed. “Peter Hochins is in a cabin in Charlesmith, fifteen minutes East from the lake. He should be there in… Oh, about twenty minutes. You could probably make it there in time if you hurry. I didn’t particularly care for him, anyway.”
“Come, Picasso,” John said, and Picasso stopped her ambush long enough for John to scoop her up and for Sherlock to shut the door in Mycroft’s flushed and furious face.
“Thanks,” John muttered, face aflame. The place where Sherlock’s hand touched his felt too-hot; tingling. “I guess I did need help after all.”
“What are you doing?” John said. “Why are you calling me? Did he reject you? I’ll kill him, I swear.”
When the movie was over, Sherlock said, “I know this wasn’t part of the plan but I have another gift for you,” and pulled out a box of chocolate croissants. The tag read,
Sherlock quickly hid his paper. Colour tinged on his cheeks, stark against pale skin. He swallowed. “I―”
“You call yourself his partner, do you?” Sebastian spoke softly, sweetly, saccharine. “Good luck with that. Sherlock couldn’t even
John was glad he was sitting down on the top of the ladder, because his knees would’ve given out otherwise. He tightened his hand on the ring in his hand so that he didn’t accidentally drop it, because right now it had just become the singular most important thing in his life. “No, really?”
Not hallucinating, then. Lestrade made a hysterical, guttural sound, tamping down an uncontrollable urge to hurl. Those words and Sherlock Holmes should never be paired together. Add a wink and it was the cherry on top. The universe was collapsing. The planes of reality were folding, ripping at the seams.
"They have so many tasty things here that it's hard to decide on one specific," Molly rubbed her hands under the counter. She looked around, admiring people sitting at other tables. Especially one woman in a navy blue dress, with a pearl necklace around her neck, which she played between her fingers, completely ignoring her interlocutor. "I wish you would let the waitress continue" she looked at Sherlock "and you gave up coffee right away. I thought you would need it."
He noticed immediately, the receptionist was completely devoted to his work. A pedant who knows his job. He graduated from many foreign Savoir Vivre classes and knew the customs of different countries. He devoted his whole life to one job. He had an expensive watch but worked as a porter ... - a friend of the hotel owner. He worked despite a small amount of sleep and very early hours - in love with his work. He didn't wear a wedding ring - a bachelor and an altruist.
"How? He stares at you when you don't look at him. He looks like a starving mongrel. John, we've known each other for several weeks and I'll tell you one thing. If my friend looked at me the way he stares at you I would have two choices. Either hit him in the teeth or grab him by his collar and kiss him. You could finally decide on something too because the very sight of his face and indecision is getting on my nerves."
That's why, he was now sitting on the beautiful St. Mark's Square and stared with a forced smile at the pale face of Sherlock's boring companion, Molly Hooper, who was sitting on the other side of the table. She was eating cakes, trying not to look like a greedy eater, although Aaron was perfectly aware of her weakness and he silently laughed when she tried to convince him of her good upbringing. She wasn't interesting at all. Quiet, modest ... and common girl with uninteresting work and no perspectives. She was the total opposite of what attracted him to women. He hated ordinary people, he was annoyed by conversations about life and he was tired of hearing about their problems. He avoided this kind of meetings unless he had a goal. At first, he couldn't understand why the younger Holmes was interested in Miss Hooper. There was interesting about her, and her appearance did not improve her situation, which is why her presence at Sherlock's side seemed strange to Aaron. It took him a long time before he realized why she had really come into the hotel and lived in one apartment with young Holmes. Stoner was smiling under his breath because he didn't think John's friend would be so crafty and would do such things to achieve his goal. But he was not surprised Sherlock decided to do it. He even had to admit, he admired him for his courage. He knew the price Sherlock would pay if his plan failed.
"And you are outshining all the women in this room," he replied, unable to take his eyes off her shapely body in a long black dress. Her hair was tied in a bun, and her long but slightly wrinkled neck was adorned with a shiny necklace. John couldn't stop smiling. He took the glass and with the other hand raised her hand and kissed her slim fingers.
"Oh, John ... Yes, I have my reasons, but I don't want to ruin Mycroft's reputation. At least, not like that."
For the next few days, the situation on Baker Street did not change and the atmosphere was overwhelming. No other confessions were made. The conversations were limited to the usual, uncomfortable generalities. Sherlock was in no mood to helping his clients, he dismissed them with biting comments, or didn't speak at all, forcing them to leave. He ignored the Molly and inspector's calls. He wandered around the apartment in his pajamas and rarely left the kitchen, where he did pointless experiments, or at least wanted to give the impression that he was busy with something. John was not convinced that these experiences made any sense. His friend didn't seem interested in them at all. He rearranged the test tubes and for hours was staring at the prepared samples under his microscope. He ate little and smoked as never before. Even Mrs. Hudson's reprimands to hold back a little did not help. He gave her a tired look and started smoking again. John was silent. He felt neither ready to point out to him that he was poisoning himself, nor he was sure enough to believe Sherlock would listen to him. He tried to act normal, but it was not an easy task. After what he confessed, it seemed impossible to go back to what was earlier. They both knew about their affection, yet could not take the last step to their happiness. John knew whose fault it was, and although he had been sure he did the right thing, he began to regret his decisions with every passing hour. He lost the opportunity to be with one of the Holmes brothers and lost his happiness, so the only thing he could do was to remain silent and humbly accept what Sherlock was now able to offer him.
Mycroft narrowed his eyes. "Because your colleagues ..." he spat the word out with obvious contempt and irony, "... are not smart enough to be able to help us then. I was convinced that your intervention would result in more problems than good."
Aaron didn't even try to pay close attention to what his companion was saying. She was talking about her work, ex-boyfriends, something about Venice and Sherlock, but he was completely uninterested in it. He smiled gently, giving the impression of an attentive listener, stared deeply into her dark eyes and held her hand, dreaming of the end of the meeting. Miss Hooper was fascinated and captivated with him. Who would not be? Hot glances, constant touch of hands, words gently whispered in the ear. He almost felt sorry for her. He was a manipulator and almost regretted that he was able to use this kind of person. He didn't even have to try to make a good impression on her, but it was getting easier every hour. He nearly lost his enthusiasm for further play. The girl lived in an imaginary world of romanticism and perceived positive qualities in each person. It was very naive and stupid of her, but Aaron had no intention of making her realize how unreasonable her dreams were. He would need just a few sweet and blunt words and she would fall into his arms. She bored him, yet he decided to practice his skills on her.
"I understand. You don't want to take my advice. But it would be better if you at least took longer breaks from working on a laptop." Suddenly John thought about something important. He crossed his arms over his chest and took two steps forward. "You haven't sat in front of your laptop all last night, have you?" he asked, because this kind of possibility was very likely. John saw him when he returned to the apartment after talking to Aaron. He saw him later when he slipped out of the hotel. His words made the older man turn around in his chair for the first time and slung his arm over the back of the chair. He stared at John with cold eyes.
He narrowed his eyes as he followed the detective into the room. The inspector looked extremely bad. He looked like one of the dead people who lay on either side of the cold room. The bruises under his eyes contrasted with the pale skin, and his stooped back matched the back of a bootblack, not a Scotland Yard officer.
"One buffoon less," Lestrade muttered, waiting and making sure the doctor wouldn't hear him this time.
"... I'm gone when I find the first opportunity to get out of here." She looked at the Holmes brothers, but a second later she lost interest in them and looked at John. "I didn't even mean to come here but ..."
And then he met John. Doctor John Watson. Military doctor with post-traumatic stress disorder. As soon as he appeared near Sherlock, he caught his attention. At first, he treated him like the other Sherlock roommate candidates, but he only needed a few files of documents that his people managed to gather during the day to assure him of the doctor's extraordinary character. Later John assured him in person. The first conversation with him was interesting and full of contradictions. He liked that he didn't let him intimidate him easily. He took a proud and courageous attitude and quickly gave up his offer to spy on Sherlock. Mycroft hoped that Sherlock's strange companion would complete him and help him survive in a world that his younger brother probably didn't fully understand. He believed that despite the quirks, they would get along and they would make a great duo. He wasn't wrong. The first weeks were proof that these two such strong personalities were able to work together, and what's more, live together and interact with each other without problems. He was impressed by how easily Sherlock accepted John and trusted him. Everything seemed to be going in the right direction. Of course, apart from the fact that they both loved the risk and often came up with dangerous and strange ideas that made Mycroft shiver. They were made for each other and soon became inseparable.
John realized it was actually happening. That the brothers agreed on their decision. For some strange and yet incomprehensible reason, he felt calmer. As if the weight of the last few days was gradually fading from his shoulders. "Where did this idea even come from?" he asked less nervously, letting his body relax.
His arms and back were wrapped in Sherlock's long and warm hands. He didn't hesitate too long. When the shock passed, he embraced his friend's waist and buried his nose in his slightly sweaty shirt. A pleasant smell surrounded him. The smell he had associated with home on Baker Street. He knew that no other would ever be able to compete with it. The smell of tobacco, dust, gunpowder, and tea, soaked Sherlock's clothes. He smelled it even after being sprayed with cologne, which in some ways reminded him of the smell of Mycroft. He wasn't going to talk about it though. He did not want to destroy and interrupt one of the few and unusual behaviors of his friend. They stood cuddled up to each other until they heard the voice of a satisfied Molly, who cheerfully discussed in English with the saleswoman.
This is the end of the story (at least for now). Thank you all for your support. I am incredibly happy I could translate and write for you. I hope we will meet in the next story. You are awesome. I am very curious about your choice.
After three hours of walking, hunger and sun were beginning to bother them. They went down the slopes and saw hectares of forest. They could already see the pleasant shade of the spreading crowns of the trees and the smell of pine needles rolling on the ground in the lush grass. For now, however, they had to deal with the road paved with stones. Each of them quietly hoped that when they reached the green border, Moran would decide to take the first break. They could almost smell the food and the heat of the fire. John wanted nothing more than to throw off a heavy backpack, remove stones that had somehow managed to get into his shoes and warm his frozen hands over the fire. He was also going to talk to Sherlock because he was quiet and gloomy. On the other hand, he was worried about Sebastian's lack of action. He knew him and was convinced that whenever he had the opportunity, he would make him talk. That he would cling to him and force him to explain their separation. Meanwhile, apart from glances, Sebastian did not seem eager to talk. Maybe he has changed? Maybe he understood and regrets? These thoughts ran through John's head from time to time. He wanted to believe that whatever had happened to Moran during these ten years had changed him enough to finally let go of the possessive nature of their unstable relationship. Unfortunately, the greatest faith was sometimes not enough. Anyone who met Sebastian once knew that he never gave up. And John knew that. He guessed that Moran wanted to lull his attention or give him time to prepare for the conversation, which was to happen sooner or later. Whatever was going to happen, John felt his body contract in anticipation and uncertainty. He wanted to do it and move on. The first conversation after so many years of separation could not take place in a friendly atmosphere. He just hoped that he would be able to talk to Sebastian away from the curious eyes of the other members of the group, especially Sherlock. He preferred to keep a secret from him in this case.
"Maybe we should give him another chance to make a decision and stop guessing what he is feeling? Because in his case, it is sometimes really difficult to understand what he has in his head and what he is thinking about".
John involuntarily looked at the men. They sat and discussed but he couldn't hear them. "We had a little quarrel, no big deal. Sometimes it's difficult for us to get along." John didn't even try to hide the reason for his bad mood. He knew she was as intelligent as the two Holmes brothers, though she didn't say many things out loud. She knew the word 'tact', which was a nice change from Mycroft's sharp and cool way of being. Not to mention his younger brother. The present moment was a perfect example because even if Francesca suspected the cause of their bad moods, she did not speak and did not continue the topic. She smiled warmly and put her fingers just under John's right ear.
After waking up, he lay in bed for some time. He had neither the strength nor the desire to get up. He listened to people who walked outside the hotel. It was only after some time that he realized he could still smell Mycroft and that the smell itself also penetrated him. He turned his head and looked at his phone. A glass of water and painkillers lay next to it. Maybe Mycroft was a distant man who preferred to avoid problems directly related to him, but John felt warm, seeing that he was not left alone. His husband cared for him, though he didn't do it face to face.
The kisses on his neck gave him an indescribable pleasure. He was half-conscious when the door to the room swung open with a soft creak. He opened his eyes, tensed his body. He was about to warn Holmes when the detective pressed his hand against the door, not letting anyone interrupt their intimate moment. The door slammed with a loud bang.
"Francesca wants to know how we met," Mycroft said calmly and took a sip of his wine. His nonchalant tone meant one thing - it was John who was supposed to make up their past. Clearly, Mycroft never bothered to even try to do it.
John bowed to them one last time and quietly walked toward the cafeteria, separated from the lobby by the hall and reception. He felt Stoner's hot gaze on his back until he disappeared behind the wall. It was only now that he took a deep breath and sat down in a high chair by the bar. The man behind the counter smiled as he wiped one of the glasses and placed it in front of John.
John did not understand Mycroft's behavior, but that should not surprise him. He wondered if anyone knew his real character to the end. They both looked at each other. He fought with Mycroft in a psychological war. He wasn't going to be the one to lose it. Finally, a flash of resignation flickered in the eyes of the older man, he looked away and tried to calm down.
Sherlock ... usually glowing with pride. Ignoring the police. Explaining their incompetence and openly undermining their way of investigating. Today... Today he was different. It was true that he ignored the onlookers and neglected the policemen's instructions, as usual, but this time he was focused on something else. Or rather someone. His new companion. Dr. John Watson. He saw them leave the crime scene. He could see the gleam in Sherlock's eyes as he led the doctor towards the carriage. He could see the raised corners of his mouth as Watson clumsily tried to get in. His body language spoke of one thing - Sherlock was fascinated by something other than crime. Sherlock had a new passion. Sherlock made a goal for himself. His new obsession could destroy everything he had so far managed to cover up and sweep under the rug. No. It was too much of a risk. He had to make sure John Watson wasn't destroying his plans and messing up his deal with Sherlock. He had to solve this problem as soon as possible.
