“I’m glad John is dead,” Cas waited with bated breath for Jack to continue. “He’s...he’s mean. And I’ve noticed how Sam and Dean have changed with him around.”
Cas decided, for Dean’s sake, that he would move to one of the other bedrooms for a few days, just so that Dean could grieve in the way he needed to, without seeing the man responsible for his father’s death.
“Do you expect me to pretend that Kaia and I aren’t together?” Claire looked down at the table, afraid of the answer.
“Your daddy’s lettin’ you go on werewolf hunts, now?” Bobby asked.
Dean nodded toward a pile of clothes on the chair next to him, “I’m trying to see if I have any clothes that’ll fit him. We can also go into town sometime this week to get more supplies for him. Do you think he sleeps? We can set up a room for him either way.”
“Kaia, please,” Jack said. He was clearly extremely worried about his sister.
“What? No, I did not,” Mary turned to look at her eldest. “You two are together?”
“Great,” Dean rolled his eyes. “But that’s something else we can give to Ash and Jo. It’s not too much but it’ll help.”
“Family’s finally back together,” Dean said quietly. “I got everything I need right here. Thank you, Jack.”
“Unfortunately with all the warding, I cannot sense any presence in the building, but my best guess would be a demon,” Castiel looked up toward the top of the church. “We should hurry.”
“I think I found it!” Jack said excitedly. “It doesn’t mention a bracelet specifically, but it does say that any jewelry blessed with Aletheia would only be released once the wearer speaks their deepest truth.”
Dean shook his head quickly, “I dealt with it, they’re all okay now, but Jack was messing around with his powers and it got pretty serious. Somehow they managed to start a fire, and Clarie ended up with a broken wrist - ” Cas moved to speak, but Dean kept going “- she’s healed, it’s okay. I just think that… maybe his infrequent sessions with Gabe aren’t enough, you know? We gotta do something else. I don’t want anything bigger than this to happen.”
“That is terrible, Jack, but we cannot save
“Why is six afraid of seven?” Cas deadpanned, and Dean couldn’t hold back the laughter.
“My grades weren’t good, but I pulled through,” she explained, “But I just… where do I go from here? Do I get a job? Do I volunteer somewhere? Do I hunt?”
“I’m good, I’m fine,” Claire panted, sitting back against the headboard. “So...they’re home?” Kaia nodded. “Suppose I should face the music, huh?”
For the rest of afternoon, Claire stayed hidden in her room to try and avoid having to reveal anything she wasn’t ready to, but when Dean called that dinner was ready, she knew she couldn’t avoid it any longer.
He took a sip and grimaced, “That’s disgusting.”
“Good,” Kaia muttered, her pencil scratching the paper. Claire could tell that she was absorbed in whatever she was writing so she pushed herself up off the floor to wander out of their room and down the hallway. She passed by Sam and Bela’s room and Dean and Castiel’s’, both empty of all occupants.
“Her name was Jess,” Sam growled, hand itching to grab the demon knife from his belt but he knew he had to wait for the right moment.
Dean relented, “We’ll share it, then.”
“Okay, so Lilith is in charge. Why is she doing all this? What’s the point?” Sam asked, Castiel finally turning to look at him rather than Dean.
“I’ll do my best. Have you called Sam? Give him a heads up?” Claire looked up at Cas, resting her chin on his chest.
“Most of it has been shit,” Claire agreed. “But if you hadn’t possessed him, I wouldn’t have ever come out. And I never would have met Kaia.”
John spoke for the first time once he had parked the car off the side of a dirt road sometime in the early evening, “You sure you know what you’re doing?” he asked gruffly.
“Shut the fuck up, man, you don’t know shit about her. You know she’s no older than you? Meaning she was a teenager when she made that deal,” Sam was glaring at his brother now. “And you have no idea why she made the deal to begin with.”
Dean let out a laugh, “Don’t be modest. I taught Sammy to drive and that was one of the scariest experiences of my life.”
The vampire ran outside - the sky had shifted from dusk to pure night in the time they had been inside - and John turned to Cas wide-eyed for a moment, before taking off after the vampire.
“Cas?”
“As long as you’ll be safe and look after one another,” Mary said pointedly.
Sam backed away slowly, eyes darting back and forth to see if anything within reach could be used as a weapon, “Who the hell are you?
Cas found Sam slumped against the wall outside the house, his head in his hands as his shoulders shook violently. Cas cleared his throat, remembering the many times Dean had admonished him for showing up without announcing himself. Sam flinched at the sound, looking up at Cas with red-rimmed eyes.
And Bobby will say
The first thing his eyes registered was Sam, tied to a chair in the center of the room. He surged forward, knife ready to cut Sam free of his bindings. “Dean, no!” Sam yelled out, at the same time that a woman stepped forward, pushing him back with surprising strength. Dean slashed at her with an angel blade, surprised that it had no effect. He reached into his waistband and aimed the Colt at her.
“I’m gonna get Claire some clothes, but we need to clean the kitchen,” Kaia said nervously. “And someone has to tell Sam and Dean.”
Cas brought over two bowls of mac and cheese with bits of broccoli mixed in. Claire looked up at Dean as he sat down across from her. “What? It’s Jack’s favorite.”
Cas ignored him, leaning in way too close to look at the human heart in his hands, “These hearts have been marked in Enochian. These marks refer to a romantic union which means that, most likely, this is the work of a rogue Cupid.”
“Don’t you want to know, Sam Winchester?” Famine asked, letting out a gut-wrenching cough.
“Sound good, Jack?” Claire asked, turning to her pseudo brother. Jack nodded excitedly.
“Alright fine, so we’ll talk to him about this,” Dean said and slumped against the door frame. The silence stretched for a long awkward moment, all three of them staring at Dean. “Why does it have to be me?”
“You doing okay, son?” Bobby asked, startling Dean out of his thoughts.
“See you soon, Cas,” Claire said and hung up, dropping her phone. She reached into the backseat, wincing at the strain on her leg, and grabbed her first aid kit. She cleaned the gash in her leg as well as she could and then wrapped bandages tightly around her thigh, slowly removing the tourniquet. She didn’t want to risk losing her entire leg due to a lack of blood flow. She threw everything over her shoulder into the back seat and then started the car, pulling onto the road.
“You think they’ll be alright without either of us there?” Jack asked a few miles in.
“Of course, Cas, go do your heavenly duties or whatever it is. Just...even if you can’t stay long to talk, it’s nice to hear from you,” Dean said, watching Cas as he kept his gaze trained up above. Dean licked his lips at the sight of Castiel’s neck stretched, his stubble creeping down and the vein standing out against his skin.
life, a safe life. He was going to have a normal job and a normal brother and just be normal.
Sam let out a loud laugh and then took a moment to compose himself, “He didn’t… think you were Lucifer. That thing he said was just a pickup line.”
“Alright, let’s get some gas and then get out of here. Cas? You staying with us a bit longer or you got other places to be?”
“What’s with the third degree? Can’t a man just visit his sons?” John scoffed, turning to look at Dean. “What kind of company are you keeping?”
“Great,” Dean muttered. “I’ll go get him some clothes, and tell everyone what’s going on.” Cas smiled gratefully and turned his attention back to Jack. Dean pushed the door open with a heavy sigh, grateful that only Sam had remained, likely wanting to give them privacy.
“Castiel, I am an Angel of the Lord,” he said. “What purpose do you have for being here?”
“That’s one ring down,” Dean said breathlessly. “Three to go.”
“Now what?” he asked with wide eyes.
Figuring it was akin to everything else that was happening, Dean and Mary decided to go check it out, as Sam was dealing with his university and getting enrolled for the next semester.
Dean was silent for a few moments, and Cas’ eyes searched his face. His eyes were rimmed with red, but the expression on his face wasn’t what Cas had expected. It wasn’t one of devastation, wasn’t one of anger. Dean’s expression was one of hesitancy with a little bit of fear.
“Thank you for your help,” he said politely and grabbed Dean’s arm, yanking him back to follow him outside. “After the case, remember? Focus until we kill whatevers doing this, and then you can get laid all you want.”
“Don’t worry Dean-o, he’s just excited to see an old friend,” the man said and flashed his black, demon eyes. Dean clenched his fists where they held behind his back. “Isn’t that right, Sammy-boy?”
Sam Winchester. You’re a legend among demons, you know? The man who started the apocalypse and gave us the chance to raise Lucifer once more,” when Famine spoke it was slow and heavy, as if every word pained him.
“Definitely a demon,” Dean said as they stepped inside. There wasn’t much left behind of the crime scene, all the blood and bodies cleaned up days ago. “See anything?” he asked as they walked around the perimeter.
Sam moved on, perusing the packaged snacks that were available. He grabbed several packages of nuts, and then some sour candy for good measure. He was about to see what kinds of toiletry items were available, when he was startled by a man that he hadn’t noticed before, standing in the corner.
“Nothing with us will change, Dean” Sam said earnestly, “I’ll visit and I’ll call as often as I can.”
Dean sighed, closing his eyes, “It’s always gotta be something, huh? What do you assholes want from us?”
Next, they headed down to Cas and Dean’s room. “Can you only make yourself invisible? Or can you make other people invisible too?” Kaia asked, as they were unsure of where Cas or Bela were.
“Yes, Dean has asked me to cease looking into his mind. He says it’s a breach of privacy the NSA wished they had. I wasn’t sure what he meant, but I do as he asks,” Cas explained. Sam let out a small snort of laughter.
“Sounds good enough for me,” Dean said with a sarcastic grin. “Since you’re not throwing yourself headfirst at someone that can kill you. So what’s our fake emergency then?”
what it’s like.  I know men like you, I grew up with a man like you.  I’ve killed men like you.  I’ve buried their bodies in the yard and nobody has ever been the fuckin’ wiser because nobody misses men like you when you’re gone.”
Sam nodded, “So what now?”
“Good talk,” Dean said to the empty space where Castiel had stood just a moment earlier.
Jack closed his eyes in concentration for a moment, “Yes, they’re talking about me… and Michael.”
“I’m sorry!”
Gabriel was able to help Jack to develop his abilities to some degree, but his visits were infrequent due to his duties and obligations in Heaven. In the meantime, Claire and Kaia encouraged him to experiment further with his powers. After one particularly catastrophic attempt, Dean found Jack and Kaia attempting to put out a small fire, and Claire nursing what appeared to be a broken wrist.
“It was good. Much better than I thought it would be, but to be fair, the only thing I really knew about it was from incels on the internet,” Claire shrugged, smirking a little when both Dean and Cas gave her a confused look, but neither asked what she meant. They truly were peak middle-aged dads. “I can see why you like it so much,” she said, turning to Jack.
Cas nodded, but didn’t feel the need to respond, and he knew that John didn’t really expect him to. John swore under his breath as the door creaked open, pausing to see if the sound had woken any of the vampires they had assumed would be sleeping. Once he was satisfied that it hadn’t, he beckoned for Cas to enter the warehouse behind him.
“Yes, because I don’t want to move you more than we have to. I’ll be right back, I’m gonna get everything.” With that, Dean was up and out of the room, leaving just Claire and Cas.
After checking into a motel and changing into their suits, Mary and Dean headed to the county jail to speak with the teacher who had murdered the teenagers. Dean let his mom take point, as usual. She had twenty plus years on him and he always learned something when he watched her.
“A nice supper?”  He hates it when his father’s voice goes quiet like that.  It’s worse than the yelling.  He knows what to expect from the yelling, but the quiet - the quiet scares him.
Fortunately for everyone in attendance, they didn’t have to wait long for the action to start. Jake, the demon-blood kid who had killed Sam, approached the gate, chanting what was obviously something demonic in nature. The first wave, Jo, Dean and Bobby stormed him, guns aimed for the kill shot. He smirked, flinging each of them at least 10 feet back with a sweeping arm gesture.
you can find me on tumblr @hazloveshisboo or Grace @hellerjesuschrist !
“Alright, Jackie,” Claire whispered once they were alone outside the classroom door. “You’re gonna do great. Just be you, you’re awkwardly charming and weird, kids love that.”
“Ellen called but I wasn’t - I couldn’t…” Mary stuttered out, struggling with her words, “How did this happen?”
“I’ve tried to keep families together. Bobby and Karen are just a short drive that way. Sam’s will be across the road. Jody and Donna are a little bit further down. And your parents are just over that hill,” Jack gestured as he spoke, wanting Dean to know that he was surrounded by everyone important.
Instead, Bobby mechanically goes to grab the biscuits for him and knocks a glass of milk to the floor.  It feels like it happens in slow motion, the shattering of the glass is punctuated by the leap of his heart into his throat.  His father folds his newspaper.  His mother gasps.
Cas nodded, “It’ll be fine Dean. We’ll be back before you guys anyway. Probably better if you two take Jack, though.”
Cas nodded, eyes rimmed with red as he smiled sadly at them. He yelped in surprise when Claire surged forward and hugged him. He hesitated for a moment before he allowed himself to melt into the embrace, hugging her back tightly. She gave him a small smile when she pulled away.
It wasn’t long after that that Eileen pulled Sam up to head to bed, knowing there was no use driving back for the night when they had a perfectly good bedroom at the bunker. Cas and Dean only stayed up a bit longer, both men giving Claire and Jack a kiss on the head as they exited the library.
“I see,” the woman replied, taking Claire’s attitude in stride, “My girlfriend is a big fan of those romantic comedies but me? I just want to put on a slasher movie and call it good.” Claire rolled her eyes. Typical straight women, she thought.
Dean rolled his eyes, pointedly not engaging with the question. As he was looking around, a car caught his eye. It was a cherry red 1965 Mustang Fastback, unmarred despite the destruction surrounding it.
For the next hour, Jack and Claire dug through different boxes in the storage room, pulling out all manner of objects and artifacts. They had fun reading off the tags to each other and trying to guess what something did if it wasn’t listed.
It was only a second before he was assaulted with holy water and salt, then a cold silver knife was pressed to his bare arm. Once it was clear that he was neither ghost, nor demon, nor shapeshifter, both women flung themselves into his arms, still in disbelief.
“Cas,” he said, reaching forward to cup the other man’s face, moving it back and forth gently to try and get him to rouse. “Buddy, come on.”
Sam met his eyes, neither man saying anything as they stared at one another. “What do you want?” Sam finally broke the silence, though he remained stoic.
“Veracity…” Jack looked up from the box he was digging through. “It means to conform to facts and accuracy.”
“So you could hear my nightmares, then?” Sam asked, looking down at the floor.
to really narrow it down - it could be a restaurant, bar, big box store, anything really - and there were too many demons scattered throughout town for Cas to get a good read on where Famine was holing up.
“Not really,” Sam admitted. “Could we, I don’t know, take a walk or something?”
“Only one way to find out,” Jack said, grinning over at Claire.
“How are they here?” Dean asked. “They died, what, twenty years ago?”
“No, you need someone else with you,” Mary shook her head immediately. “This is too big.”
“Meat,” Dean said, opening up the fridge. He found a package of ground chuck and emptied it into a bowl, handing it over to Jack. “She can have that, but we’re taking her to the shelter tomorrow.”
“Bela disagrees,” Alastair said cruelly. Sam’s breath hitched at the mention of Bela and he fought harder against the invisible restraints.
“The seals, though there are many, the first and last seal must always be the same,” Cas said. “
“No no, that’s good. Let’s just get the rest of this blood gone.” With that, Kaia knelt down and began helping by scrubbing the blood from the grooves of the tiles that Jack had already mopped.
Castiel quirked his head, “Well, yes. The issue I’m here regarding isn’t something Sam could handle on his own.”
“But I want to stay here,” Sam had said.  Dean hadn’t said a thing, just set his jaw and stood up.  Sam had pouted on the couch but Dean had grabbed his hand and pulled him up and up the stairs - Bobby had been surprised he didn’t drag his feet.
“Kid,” Dean said as he and Cas walked up behind him.
“Well, according to the Bible,
“You’re welcome, Claire,” Cas said, nuzzling into her hair. “Like I said, I will protect you no matter what.”
Claire and Kaia walked over and sat at the table near Dean, while Cas and Jack conversed about the angels.
Mary left the room to call Bobby, leaving Dean and Jo to talk, an opportunity that Jo leapt on. “How are you really doing, Dean? Are you sleeping? Eating? How much have you been drinking?”
.  “What did you want to know?”
“You promised you’d save me, Sam,” Bela said, tilting her head. “We made a deal. And you broke it.”
One evening as Claire was sitting by herself eating dinner, waiting for Kaia and Jack to finish watching some movie that Claire wasn’t interested in, one of the women who was friends with Sam and Dean’s mom came to sit with her.
“It’s beautiful, Cas, thank you,” Dean leaned in and kissed him, neither pulling away until Claire cleared her throat loudly.
“So you admit this is home?” Kaia asked. Claire glanced around at the different pictures that were taped to the wall, the shelves overflowing with Kaia’s books and journals, and the closet bursting with their clothes; so maybe they weren’t visiting so much as returning.
“Jack…” Dean started, looking at the Nephilim warily. “You were born less than five minutes ago. How are you...like that?”
“I suppose that would be alright,” Castiel amended. “I have never had a...nickname before.”
The woman watched John sink to the ground, dazed, and shook her head, eyes wide. “Can I take you to a hospital or something?” Cas continued.
“That’s...yeah, I suppose that’s part of it,” Dean muttered. “It’s just that we were talking every few nights or so, and then all of sudden nothing but you have time to go on a walk with Sam every single day? Makes a guy feel like a placeholder is all.”
“My parents, huh,” Dean muttered, staring in the direction that Jack had pointed.
One of the human-like men stalked towards Dean, significantly taller than him, taller than Sam, even, “You incompetent mortals are the reason the apocalypse is looming on the horizon, and you expect us not to blame you for it?”
“I am not positive,” Castiel said. “But there is a church that has been heavily warded and I cannot see inside it.”
Castiel shook his head, almost sadly, “I don’t know their location right now, but if you can get ahold of them, I can transport us both there.”
At the next family dinner, Sam and Eileen also showed up. They only lived about an hour away, up north in Hastings. They both worked at the university, Sam in the library and Eileen as an ASL translator, so they weren’t able to come down all the time, but Claire figured Jack visiting was more than enough to get them to the bunker.
“He - he was drunk. And he came at me,” Claire whispered. “I just…acted on instinct.” She finally turned to look at Kaia, eyes wide and brimming with tears. “Dean is going to hate me.”
A few hours and several pop albums later, Dean pulled into the driveway of his mother’s house. Before he could even turn off the car, she was outside the front door, waiting to greet them. Once she made her rounds, giving everyone a hug, she ushered them inside.
“Hey kid,” Dean said, pressing a quick kiss to Jack’s head. “What’d you and the girls get up to while we were out?”
“I need its blood for the cure, you fucking moron,” John yelled over his shoulder.
“Of course we can, but I meant...what was the other thing?” Dean asked, Cas rubbing a hand over his lower back. Cas knew that Claire and Jack were thinking of switching over to calling Dean Dad - she had brought it up to him a few days ago. She didn’t want him to think she didn’t think of him as her father as well, but calling Cas dad while he still wore her biological father’s body...that wasn’t something she thinks she could ever do.
Dean shook his head and sat down at the table across from her. She took a deep breath, and began to unload everything on him, sharing that her mother was cold and uncaring, while her father abused her in every imaginable way, “I just wanted it to stop,” she said, holding back tears, “That’s why I made the deal.”
“You had to do it, Sammy. There was no other choice,” Dean said through his own tears, “It’s going to be okay. He would’ve killed us if you hadn’t killed him first.”
“You will have to do this alone,” Castiel said plainly. From his sleeve dropped a silver blade and he held it out to Dean. “Take this, it will kill almost anything.”
“In a sense,” Castiel agreed. “It’s a bit more complicated than that, but for simplicity, yes, it is above us.” Dean snorted at that.
“So I should just give him time?” Jack asked. Castiel nodded and patted Jack’s knee approvingly.
“It means we need to rub butter all over the inside of the pans, so the cakes don’t stick, “ Claire explained, looking at the butter for a moment. “I think maybe the easiest way is to just use our hands?” Jack nodded and broke off part of the stick and began to rub it all over one of the pans, Claire doing the same. After all three were buttered, they washed their hands and Claire got the flour out of the cabinet.
“How about….that one?” Jack pointed to the second door on the left. Claire opened the door to reveal shelves full of boxes.
Though bloody and bruised, Jack was smiling when he reappeared in the bunker. “Jack,” Cas gasped, with tears in his eyes and surged forward to hug the nephilim, “We were so worried about you.”
Sam and Dean exchanged curious eye contact, “Maybe there’s some kind of convention,” Sam suggested. They were promptly checked in and given the key to their room, which turned out to be just as luxurious as the rest of the hotel had been. Dean flopped down on one of the beds, praying to Cas so that he knew where they were.
“I think I have a better idea,” she smirked and dragged Jack to her bedroom. She opened up the top drawer of her dresser and pulled out two pairs of fuzzy socks, tossing them to Jack. “Put those on,” she instructed as she did exactly that. Jack nodded and sat on her bed to pull off his shoes, putting on the socks over the ones he already wore.
“Nothing you puny humans can do to me will be even a modicum of what I can do,” Pestilence said, bringing his hands together, twisting his ring around his finger slowly. “After all, disease always wins. Your species can invent as many vaccines and cures as they want, but disease, bacteria? They have one purpose. To divide and conquer.”
Dean opened the oven and looked inside, “I think we’ll be ready to go in a few minutes. Did you get Claire and Kaia’s gift ready?”
John’s jaw dropped, and Cas had to physically refrain from rolling his eyes. “So you’re just going to let people die?” John asked, incredulous.
“It’s not your fault, kid,” Dean sighed. “You didn’t know.”
“Of course,” Jack smiled into Dean’s chest and inhaled deeply. He had missed the comforting scent of pine, leather, and gun oil that seemed to always cling to Dean. “I’ll see you soon.”
Dean wasn’t
Jack smiled, “I’ll see her again in Heaven. I wish she was here on Earth with us, but it brings me comfort to know that she’s safe up there,” He turned to face Claire, specifically, “I understand that Castiel inhabits the body of your father. I suppose that makes us something like siblings.”
Sam’s hand faltered, and he looked over at Dean. Dean’s eyes were watery, his lip trembled, but the slight nod that he gave Sam was all he needed.
No matter how much time Cas spent around John Winchester, he could never get used to the oppressive dread he felt around the man. Having rebuilt Dean from scratch after his time in Hell, and in the subsequent decade that he had spent by his side, he hated John Winchester more with each anecdote that he learned about the man, and the handful of times that they had met. John had begrudgingly accepted that Dean and Cas were in a relationship, and nothing he could say would change that, but that didn’t stop him from trying every time he could corner Dean, Cas, or the both of them together. In one memorable occasion, he had tried to convince Sam to break them up, which resulted in him slinking out of the bunker early, a shiner painted across the left side of his face.
“What the hell?!” Dean yelled, pulling the fire extinguisher from the wall and directing the spray towards the rapidly-spreading fire, “What happened in here?”
“That was Jo, she and Ash found something strange in this tiny ass town: no one’s dying. Haven’t for days now,” Dean explained. “What are you making?”
“Sammy?” Dean looked over at his younger brother, lips trembling. “You’re - you’re really here?”
With Kaia and Claire in Sioux Falls, and Sam and Bela in Manhattan, only Cas, Dean, and Jack were left in the bunker. They had gotten into routine, the last few weeks with just the three of them. Cas and Jack would work together most of the day on his schooling, making sure that his education was standard enough that he would be able to get a job if he ever chose, and Dean helped other hunters. He had set up a few different phone lines - much like Bobby had - and acted as a resource for anyone in need.
Cas readied his machete, and made his way into the warehouse, giving his eyes a second to adjust to the darkness. Immediately, he and John separated, not seeing a reason to stay together for this part, as they didn’t want to be around each other to begin with. Cas got to work, dispatching vampires with his machete, freeing the collection of humans that he found restrained - a telltale sign that getting rid of these vampires was the right choice.
“What have you been up to?” Sam asked once they were seated at the table, Karen cutting them both slices of pie and even giving them a scoop of ice cream on top - she knew her boys well.
“What?!” Sam said, a mixture of amazement and confusion, “Why - why would you do that?”
Remembering how much she had enjoyed being around Jody and Donna, she smiled. “Could you give me Donna’s phone number, actually? She works at an elementary school, right?”
“Thank you thank you thank you!” he almost squealed, turning to Paperclip. “We’ll have to make a list of things you need! You need food, and a bed, and toys…” Jack continued his list as he walked out of the kitchen with Paperclip, not noticing the matching fond but exasperated smiles his dads wore.
“She’s a smart woman,” Dean clapped him on the shoulder. “Well, I better get familiar with my place before Cas gets here. I’ll need to make him a big dinner to celebrate.”
Sam sighed, “I’m sorry, Dean.”
By the time Cas plopped back into the driver’s seat, he could hear Dean yelling to him frantically through the phone.

Cas paled, “Did something happen?”
She smirked, “He’s fine, Castiel. He’s with Gabriel. The nephilim is much stronger than you give him credit for.”
“I know everything about you, boy, I know how you’ll live and how you’ll die,” John took another step forward, placing himself directly in front of the barrel of the shotgun. “You have been a disappointment from the moment your mother died-”
Likely led by the scent of coffee, Cas found his way into the kitchen, with Gabriel close behind. Cas smiled gratefully as he accepted the mug of coffee from Dean.
“You never told me that, Dean,” Sam was leaning forward in his own seat, signing Dean’s words to Eileen even as he stared at his older brother, at his protector.
“I think I can make an exception just this once,” Jack agreed and before her eyes, the entire kitchen was sparkling clean.
“You want this one?” Dean nudged her to get her attention. Claire nodded, not taking her eyes off the tree.
Claire was still in bed when Sam, Dean, and Cas returned the next morning. She hadn’t moved from the spot that Kaia had left her in the night before, but as soon as she heard the entrance to the bunker slam shut, she sat up, breathing quickly.
“And this one,” Castiel said with a small chuckle. “It means ‘you breed with the mouth of a goat’.” Claire just raised her eyebrows and stared at him. “It’s funnier in Enochian.” Claire did snort at that, covering her mouth with her hand.
Cas took a step toward him, “Dean-” he was cut off by Sam calling down the stairs for Dean to hurry his ass up.
In celebration of both Kaia and Sam going off to college, Dean went all-out. He ordered Cas and Jack to decorate the bunker, while he locked himself in the kitchen for hours on end, making all kinds of food for the party.
“Hey douchebag!” Dean got Alastair’s attention, causing the demon to let go of Sam and stalk the few steps toward him. “You don’t fucking touch my brother.”
“Because I like being taken care of,” Claire answered, breathing heavy. “Because you two take care of me in a way that I haven’t had in a long time and I miss that.”
Dean furrowed his brows, “And why are you telling us this, exactly? Your brothers or whatever gave us nothing but trouble.”
“I’m sure it’s not as bad as you think,” Jack said, coming over to look at it. “We need to take them out of the pan?”
“It wasn’t much. But the few times, being able to talk to someone I knew, it helped. And she’s still down there,” Sam looked down, the familiar feeling of guilt icing over his insides.
Mary looked at Dean for a moment, considering, but she shook her head. “I can’t leave him. Bobby, you should go though. Jo will keep me company. Donna and Jody should get some rest too.”
“Fuck off,” Sam spat, finally getting over himself to respond. “A friend is the last thing I’d ever call you.”
my dads,” Claire protested but after a long moment, “I’ll text Dean and let them know we’re coming.” Kaia smirked and ducked back into the bathroom to finish washing her face before joining Claire on the bed.
“Alright, I’ll take Jack,” Claire said, closing her laptop. “Tonight is family dinner, we’ll leave in the morning.”
She looked down at the table for a moment, steeling herself, “You… went to college, right?”
Jack immediately left the angels to continue their discussion on the expansion of Heaven and Purgatory, flying straight to Dean’s corner of Heaven. Though he had changed it to be more of an open floorplan - a term he heard on HGTV while he was still on Earth - every soul still had their own small piece of paradise to call
“Shit, okay, Sam, are you okay? Have you seen anything?”
“Shit,” Dean mumbled and hurried forward. “Claire, you remember the whole thing with Lucifer’s Nephilim child? That we kind of raised, and then he defeated Chuck and became the new God?”
“Over in Colorado. We need to get going if we want to be there by tonight.”
“I’ve heard California is nice,” Dean grinned. “We got to get you ready for your first year of college.” Sam returned his grin and hung his head in relief.
“Ecstatic,” Kaia deadpanned, not looking up from her book -
Thankfully, John’s body was nowhere to be found, and Jack was on his knees as he wiped up the blood. “Where is…” Kaia trailed off, not sure if she could get the words out.
Claire was frozen in her spot, completely unsure what to do. She wasn’t sure how long she stood there before someone entered the kitchen behind her.
It only took a week and a half for Jack to be tired of being trapped inside, even though he enjoyed the time he spent training with Rowena and hanging out with his family in the bunker. He hadn’t spent much time in public to begin with, but he had thoroughly enjoyed when he had been able to be at parks, the grocery store, the library, and various restaurants.
“Shut up,” Dean muttered, fingers twitching. “You don’t know anything about me.”
“I didn’t know you even smoked,” Sam said, tucking his hands in his jacket pockets.
“What is your name?”
“We had other things we had to focus on,” Castiel said, though Dean thought he could hear something else in his voice - maybe regret?
Sam took a few steps forward, reaching up to hug his brother. Dean returned the hug, patting Sam on the shoulder, only wincing a little bit when Sam’s hand grazed the welts that littered his back.
Which meant that, of course, everything was going to fall to shit.
Claire made sure Jack remembered at the last family dinner so that he would come down for the entire day. She also talked to Cas and convinced him to get Dean out of the bunker for the entire day so that she could complete her plan without interference.
Christmas was mostly a calm affair, besides the wrapping paper war that Claire and Jack got into after all the presents were unwrapped. She didn’t get very much, some books and a new machete with sigils carved into the blade from Sam and Eileen, a brand new leather jacket that somehow fit her perfectly from Jack, but the best gift was from Cas and Dean. Her brand new birth certificate, social security card, and Kansas driver's license that named her Claire Olivia Winchester.
Ellen sighed, “It’s bad, Sam. Real bad. They’re in Wisconsin, Jo went with your mom, and Dean. Bobby, Donna and Jody were there too. They found Azazel, and your mom… she killed him -”
“‘Course, stranger,” the man tipped his hat as Dean stumbled toward the door of the bar. He yanked it open just as he answered the call, greeting Bobby lowly.
“Alright, I know you’re not gonna like this, but I’m gonna have to help you,” Dean said, kneeling on the floor to first take Claire’s boots and socks off.
“Always,” Mary said as they drove past the city limit sign.
“That’ll be my doing,” Rowena said, cutting the tension slightly.
Dean wiped a hand over his face and nodded, “Thank you,” he said, almost a whisper. Cas furrowed his eyebrows in confusion and waited for Dean to continue speaking.
“You know,” Bobby said, addressing the room, “I’d have to talk to Karen, but we have another house in town that we bought with the intention to flip, but... things got in the way and we never got around to it…if the girls want to take it…”
“What are you going to teach me?” Cas asked as they both approached the car.
Jo stood at the doorway, clearing her throat gently before speaking, “I don’t think either of you have gotten any sleep over the past two days. Why don’t you go back to the hotel, take a shower, maybe eat something and then get a few hours of sleep?”
She punched him in the shoulder lightly and gave him a wry smile, “Don’t ever do that again. Next time, you bring me with you.”
“Body you’re occupying? Are you possessing someone?”
“Okay, dude, the whole reading minds thing can be a bit rude so maybe, like, turn it off when you’re around us?” Sam suggested.
“Claire! Claire, breathe, please, I need you to breathe!” Claire gasped as Kaia took her head in her hands, forcing her to make eye contact. “Take deep breaths for me, Claire, please!” Kaia grabbed Claire’s hand and put it over her heart. Claire took a deep, heaving breath, doing her best to match Kaia’s breathing, eventually managing it after a few, seemingly infinite minutes.
She exited her room and walked slowly to the kitchen, hoping to put off the inevitable disappointed looks that she was sure both Dean and Cas would shoot her way. All three men were already seated by the time she made it to the kitchen, sitting next to Jack as was becoming the usual when they all ate together.
“What are you reading?” Claire asked, pulling the book closer to her, though she couldn’t recognize any of the letters...or symbols that were on the page.
They said their goodbyes, Dean giving the two a warning of what angel travel could do to their insides, and they were gone, leaving Dean alone with his mother, his brother and a load of research once again. He opened his laptop and dove back into the research, pointedly ignoring the looks he knew that they were giving him about his kitchen conversation with Cas.
Dean took a swig out of the beer in front of him, “If that’s what you want, I’m happy for you.”
Now that Jack was training with both Gabriel and Rowena, he had a much better grasp on his powers, how to control them, and what he could use them for.
“That changes things,” Sam said. “Give me five minutes, I think I know what we’re dealing with.” WIth that, Sam hung up. Dean huffed a bit, but relayed what Sam had told him to Bobby and Mary.
“I was fine, Jack was with me, and he’s God, I wasn’t gonna die or anything,” Claire argued, playing with the food on her plate rather than eating it.
“You ready to take the dog to the shelter?” Dean asked, looking at him pointedly. Jack stood up straight in defiance.
“Thanks, dad!” Claire called just as they left the room, giggling as they heard Dean splutter and fall back in his chair. “You think he’ll get used to us calling him that?”
“Is he mad at me?” Claire asked. “He seemed mad.”
“You might not say that once you try it,” Claire said, shame coloring her voice. “We may have overbaked it. A lot.”
“There are no reapers,” he said tensely. “No one is dying because there is no spirit to take them to Heaven or Hell.” Sam looked at Dean with a triumphant smirk.
“No, not really,” Claire shook her head and sat down at the table across from him. “Kaia is writing and she gets into this, like, mood, so I figured I would leave her to it.”
Jake lunged toward him, knife in hand as if to kill him in nearly the same way as Sam. He was dead before he even got close, as gunshots from multiple directions rained down on him as if his friends and family were saying “You already took one of our boys, we won’t let you have this one”.
“I left my phone in here so the cakes were in the oven way longer than they were supposed to be,” she groaned. “And we don’t really have enough time to make another if we want to actually eat it on Dean’s birthday.”
“You’re a convenient fucking shut-in who killed his own wife.  You’re just dying for a family because you killed yours.  So you don’t say a fucking thing
Sam had never liked being around his father, not really. Their relationship hadn’t always been so tense, but upon reflection, he knew it was because Dean had been a buffer, had taken the blows for him.
“Um, well,” Jack’s voice was shaking, which immediately put Cas on edge. “Something happened.”
Bobby’s hand stills and Dean turns around.  He’s quiet when he says it.  Dean hates when he’s quiet.
As Sam did that, Dean worked on packing everything else back into their bags. He was almost finished by the time Sam returned. “Put these in the backseat first. We’ll get him in the car and leave immediately.” Once again, Sam listened dutifully, and within minutes, they were heaving the body of their now-dead father into the trunk of the Impala, and speeding off into the night.
John swirled the whiskey around in his glass, his mouth a hard line, “They’re safer with me.”
“Want to what, huh?” John asked, looking Claire up and down. “No one here to protect you now. Not your pretend dad, not Dean or Sam.”
“We can watch them tonight, after dinner!” He said excitedly. “It’s been a while since I’ve been able to watch anything.”
“That sounds nice,” Sam said wistfully.
“Dean,” Sam whispered but Dean just shook his head. They stood together for hours, waiting for the flames to finally die down and their father’s body to be nothing more than a pile of ashes. The sun was rising over the horizon when they finally climbed back into the car and drove a hundred miles north before Dean pulled into a motel. He got them a room and led Sam inside, sitting on the bed.
Sam drove carefully for a bit, finally pulling off the highway when they saw a sign advertising a motel. They expected it to be like the typical motels they stayed in, seedy and desolate. This one, on the other hand, was decadent and bustling, something completely unexpected in the middle of the night in the midwest.
“I’d start with the playgrounds,” War said just as Sam dug the blade into his skin, cutting through the flesh and bone easily until both the finger and the ring had fallen to the floor. Before Dean could do anything, War practically dissolved under his hold. Sam and Dean looked at each for a long moment before Sam reached down and picked up the ring, turning it over in his hands. It was plain and nondescript - nothing they would have ever thought to look for.
“Yeah, he’s dead,” Dean confirmed. “Help me wrap him up.” They worked together to wrap the corpse up in the plastic sheet. “Go back the car up right in front of the door, as close as you can get. We’ll put him in the trunk and find a place to burn his body.”
“This is your favorite?” Claire asked in disbelief, turning to face him. “Are you serious?”
“Did you get a lead on Lilith?” Cas asked, looking between the brothers.
He took a deep breath and headed back down the hallway to the infirmary. “Dean?” Cas called and Dean had no choice but to enter, holding the clothes out to Jack.
“You’re the reapers then?” Dean asked. One of them nodded. “Things are gonna go back to normal now? People dying when they’re supposed to?” They nodded again. “Good. Get out of here, we’ll clean this up.” The reapers didn’t need any more encouragement and disappeared from the room without a word.
On the eighth day, she, Dean, and Cas were sitting at a table in the library when the bunker door opened. Claire was on immediate alert as she didn’t know any besides Sam that could get in and he hadn’t mentioned that he was stopping by.
After returning to Sioux Falls, Mary and Dean collected Sam and headed over to Bobby and Karen’s. Karen had headed out to help a neighbor with a few things, and to take a break from researching. Bobby was sitting in the living room, Hunter curled at his feet, as he read through an old bible written in Latin.
She dropped them back down on her dresser and headed out to where Cas and Dean were in the library. “What are we doing for Christmas?” she asked, dropping into one of the chairs. Dean looked at her, and she could tell he was doing his best to hide his shock.
John tried to interrupt, but Cas continued over him, “I know you hurt them. I know the only time you laid hands on your children was to physically beat them into submission. It took me
“I said I was thinking of heading to Stanford early,” Sam laughed humorlessly. “Check out the town and all that. And Dad said he’d rather I were fucking killed on a hunt that have a son that goes to college.”
“Why do you always provoke him?”  She’s looking at him when she says it, and he feels like he might be sick.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Could you swallow your pride for one damn minute?” Sam stood from the bed. “This isn’t about you, it’s about saving the people in this town. They don’t deserve to be slaughtered just because you can’t get your head out of your ass.”
“That’s not what I mean,” Sam explained, “I’m sorry for how he treated you. I’m sorry he hit you, I’m sorry he blamed you for everything, I’m sorry you had to become a parent when you were fucking four years old.”
“No problem, sunshine,” Dean said, leaning in to kiss Cas on the cheek. “How’d you sleep?”
“Claire!” Jack said excitedly when he caught sight of her, standing to hug her. She wasn’t sure when the Winchesters became the hugging type but it maybe wasn’t the worst thing in the world.
“I think that sounds very nice,” Cas said with a smile. “I would like to take a walk with you again, whenever the opportunity arises.”
He hadn’t wanted to invite all of their friends and family - they could do that for the holidays - because he wanted this going-away party to be more about saying goodbye to the sense of normalcy that they had developed in the bunker, an odd array of lost children, celestial beings and troubled adults, inextricably tied.
“Sam?” Cas asked, after a few minutes of silence. “How are you feeling?”
“17,” Cas said plainly.
She shushed him, focusing intently on the voices in her head. After a few tense moments, she took a deep breath and spoke, “It seems that they’ve found Jack.”
They started the day with breakfast from Dean’s favorite diner, which Claire had to run out to get way earlier than she wanted to be awake. They brought him breakfast in bed, and Jack showed up just at the tail end of their meal. After Dean had gotten ready for the day, Cas easily lured him out of the bunker with a promise of some time alone away from their kids. Claire pretended to gag, Jack simply waving as they left.
“What the Hell does an angel need a lobotomy for?” Sam asked.
“Oh,” Jack jumped up and reached out, hands glowing as he tried to tug the bracelet off, but it didn’t even budge. “I don’t know why it’s not coming off.”
He was about to give up and go to sleep when he had an idea. He opened his bedroom door, surveying the hallway quickly to make sure that nobody saw him. As quietly as possible, he snuck towards Claire’s room, where he could see light peeking out from under the door. He knocked quietly and waited.
“Sammy, come on,” Dean tried once more to insert himself between them, but John was seething at this point.
Ash nodded, “It looks like some weird stuff has been happening in River Pass, Colorado. It looks like several bridges were destroyed, the main river in the area is heavily polluted as of recently, and it looks like the power grid in the area is totally down.”
“I wouldn’t know, Dad, because you never fucking talk about her. All I know is the one picture we still have, and that she loved me,” Sam’s lower lip quivered and he shook his head. “I can’t deal with this anymore Dad. I don’t want to hunt, I don’t want this to be my life - I never did! You were just too blind or drunk to see it!”
He was packing, before.  He had been throwing his stuff back into his beat up duffel and he’d gone to clear off the shelf that held everything he owned.  Mostly it was books from Bobby, beat up old paper backs that he’d thought Dean would like.  He was right, he was always right.  He’d spent so many days this past month curled upon the couch downstairs, absolutely nothing to do but finish these stories.
“Werewolf got you again?” he asks with raised eyebrows.  Dean was frozen for a second, just a second, before he recovered.  He dried his hands and turned.
“Nice talking to you, Cas,” Dean whispered, looking up at the sky - at Heaven - where hopefully Cas had heard him. “I’ll see you soon.”
“What’s so funny about that?” Jack asked, tilting his head exactly like Cas did.
“Hello!” Jack said with a bright smile, and before Claire could blink, Dean was hugging him tight. Claire bit back a smug smile, glancing up as Cas finally entered the room as well.
Dean collapsed against Cas’ chest, fully sobbing now, and Cas finally understood. It wasn't sadness, wasn’t grief. It was the combination of relief, and guilt that had sent Dean over the edge, and that was a feeling Cas could relate to.
“Yes, it is Sam. But in order to guide him, I needed a vessel. Angels have chosen vessels, based on bloodlines. Mine are the Novaks,” Castiel said. “When your father prayed to me, and accepted my possession, I was not the angel...the man I am today. I did not hold humans in the same regard, I did not see their lives as valuable. At least, not the way I do now. I saw possessing your father as a necessary evil.”
“That does not even come close to what John Winchester deserves,” Cam grumbled unhappily.
“Hey, my brother and I were just passing through when we noticed how...empty this place is, it’s a bit of a strange sight. You guys just that good at your job?”
Castiel watched him intently, “Why aren’t your friends answering you?”
Mary had intended to say more, but was interrupted as Sam entered. He raised his hand in greeting, a small smile on his face. Mary and Dean’s eyes followed him as he walked over to the coffee pot, pouring himself a cup. He walked over and sat down at the table with them.
Usually he left his sons alone, too busy with a handle of Smirnoff and someone else’s wife to pay attention to anything else, but on the rare occasions that he was mostly-sober and desperate enough to retain a modicum of control over his sons, he’d drop by and burden them with his presence until he instigated a fight, and then disappeared for another indeterminate length of time.
“I have also enjoyed our time conversing,” Cas said.
“We could...we could call Castiel? Or pray to him, I guess,” Dean suggested, trying his best to sound nonchalant. Ever since their conversation in the backyard after the raising of the witnesses, Dean had been thinking about the angel a bit more than he wanted to admit. “I mean, guy’s millions of years old, right? He’ll have seen shit we could never even dream of.”
“I know,” Claire grinned as Sam and Dean stomped in, throwing their bags in the trunk of the Impala.
“You from around here, then?” the man asked, tilting his head
“Jack and Claire are my kids,” Dean said, startling everyone in the room as he and Cas came around the corner. “And Kaia…”
“Is not!  It’s vegetables and protein, how are you supposed to grow without those, huh?”
“Yeah, okay Sammy,” replied Dean, “I gotta get dinner started.”
“Nope.”
“Sam,” Dean said gruffly, “Come here.”
“Sure kiddo, I’ll make sure it’s ready,” Dean said, leaning back in his chair as Claire and Jack began heading down the hall to the showers.
“Sam took Kaia and Jack out for a supplies run,” Dean replied. “They won’t be back until after dinner probably, they had to go up to Lincoln for Costco.”
Since Rowena had been consulting with the hunters regarding the impending confrontation with Michael, her training sessions with Jack had dropped off, leaving him to entertain himself. Despite the chaos surrounding them, their exclusion from the strategy meetings left Kaia with plenty of time to write, leaving Claire in much of the same position as Jack. To remedy this, the two of them hung out in Jack’s room - to avoid disturbing Kaia - watching YouTube videos on Sam’s laptop.
“Wish you would have said that before I put it on,” Claire said, looking down at Jack with a clenched jaw, bracelet tight around her wrist. “Because it’s not coming off.”
His mother is on the floor, shakily sweeping up the glass, “Let’s just have a nice supper.”
“Not his time, yet,” Dean said with a shrug. “But he’ll be here soon enough. Tell me about what you’ve been up to.” Jack nodded and began explaining all the changes he had made to Heaven and the Angels since he had become God, finishing with the open Heaven.
“I think you do know what it is,” Jack said. “It’s what I wanted for a very long time after I was born.” Claire looked over at him and their eyes met and she wasn’t sure how, but suddenly she knew what it was.
“What’s up kid?” Dean asked, glancing up at Jack as he rushed in.
Their friends tried to give them the proper time and space to grieve, but often stopped by the house, dropping off a meal or offering some kind of information on the search for Azazel. On one of these visits, Mary was surprised to see Jo waiting outside the door. Mary smiled, learning forward to embrace the young hunter, “Hi, honey! It’s been a while, how are you doing?”
When they nodded in reply, he took off in the direction of John’s yell, machete ready to take out whatever vampires John had awakened. When he arrived, he saw that John was being restrained by one vampire, the other poised to sink its teeth into his neck. Cas swung the machete severing that vampire’s head from its body, but was too slow to decapitate the other vampire before it was on John, holding its bloodied wrist to his mouth, forcing him to drink.
Everyone chatted amicably, sticking to lighter topics while they ate the food that Dean had prepared, but as the dishes were cleared away, they knew that the more serious portion of the going-away party was inevitable.
“Dean, we spoke two days ago,” Cas said, eyes squinting in confusion. “I have been up to the same activities I was two days ago.”
“I could - if you teach me how, I could make them,” Dean offered.  Bobby just smiled.
“Well, Dean and Cas are the obvious choice,” Claire said. “But what could we do to them?”
When several of the bricks fall out of the wall as a result of the couple’s actions, Sam and Dean are surprised to say the least. “You ever have that happen?” Sam asked Dean skeptically, “Or would you say something abnormal is happening now.”
Mary gritted her teeth, already fed up with the incessant beeping and bustling of the hospital. Her eyes flicked to her son’s face, nearly unrecognizable with tubes in his nose and throat, bandages covering almost everything but his eyes. She squeezed his hand comforted by the rise and fall of his chest, even though she knew he was being sustained by machines.
“Oh, umm, you know, not that much?” Dean shrugged, stuttering a little. “Just, he’ll usually come down every couple’a days to talk.”
“It’ll be the first time in my life I’ve had an actual, legal, job,” Bela explained, humming as Sam laid her on their bed. She rolled onto her side facing away from the other side and patted the mattress. “Come on, you know I like to be spooned.”
Unfortunately, eight days into John’s indefinite stay, Garth called Dean with a case only half a day's drive from the bunker. They were the closest and it had be taken care of that night - a pack of feral werewolves was ravaging a small town and it was the full moon. If they weren’t caught tonight, they’d have to wait another month.
“I don’t need to eat, not really, but I still enjoy the taste. I’m still half-human so my tastebuds function as normal,” Jack said, somehow sounding exactly like Cas.
Once Mary and Bobby arrived, they all headed out to the bars at Cas’ suggestion that the cupid would be drawn to places with high levels of “human reproductive urges”. Bobby and Mary took the bar nearest the motel, while Cas, Sam and Dean took the larger bar in the center of town.
Dean hadn’t felt himself moving, hadn’t made the decision consciously, but within a split second, he had reached into John’s open bag and grabbed the shotgun that was sitting on top and cocked it, the sound stopping John in motion.
“What’s that supposed to mean?” Dean sent Sam a glare.
“You can’t see past your hair?” Dean suggested, pulling a new set of clothes from his bag. “Now, I’m gonna take a shower, you two can continue discussing my sex life if you want, but I’m not gonna be a part of it.” Dean smiled gleefully at Sam’s shouts of disgust and protests as he closed the door to the bathroom.
“Celebrate his death?” Jack asked with a frown, though it pulled a chuckle from Dean.
Once they got back to the bunker, a few days after Kaia’s college tour, Sam sat Dean down in the library.
He hauled a still-sluggish John from the trunk and plopped him down in a chair, ensuring that the restraints were secure.
“I know it’s not much, but…” Bobby trailed off.
The next morning, when Jack entered the kitchen, Paperclip at his heels, Cas and Dean were already up with mugs of coffee in their hands.
“The boss doesn’t like to be kept waiting,” one of the demons said, eyebrows raised.
the dogs,” Cas tried to reason with him. “It’s just not feasible, I’m sorry.”
“Similar yeah, but not the same,” he whispered. “Wouldn’t be doing this to my car.” Dean began pressing his lips along the vein in Cas’ neck.
“And that’s not sketchy at all, to you?” Bobby prompted. “He’s an angel of the Lord, he’s been alive for millions of years, and with the entirety of Heaven trying to stop the angels, he has no idea what the demons are doing?”
“Sounds like you did a good job,” Claire said and ruffled his hair. “Maybe one day soon, he’ll let you come on a hunt with us.”
When dinner was finished, and Dean stepped away to clear the dishes, Bobby turned to Sam, a solemn look on his face, “If you ever want to talk about it, you know where to find me.”
“That helps a lot, Troy, thank you,” Mary said sincerely. “And Troy, I know things are scary right now, but you can get through this.”
“It’s alright Cas, I get it. Gotta report to the bosses,” Dean smiled a little and figured in for a penny, in for a pound - they had already been outed - and leaned in, kissing Cas goodbye. “Take care of yourself.”
“Not in Heaven?” Sam’s jaw dropped open. “Well- where is he then?”
“How about who?” Mary asked. “Is there someone that is leading the demons?”
Jack began to explain that he had just been practicing some of his powers, and that he had wanted to show Claire and Kaia what he had been learning, but then he had gotten confused while levitating Claire and then somewhere along the line, a small fire had started. Dean shook his head, “The three of you need to be more careful. No more messing around with your powers until we find someone to help you out more often than Gabriel can,” Dean said with a sigh.
“I am sure that you’ll figure it out soon,” Jack said, and Claire wasn’t sure if his optimism was to make her feel better or if he was just like that, but she was leaning toward the latter. “After all, there are only so many truths you can say before you eventually get to your deepest one.” Claire just rolled her eyes and dropped her head back on the table.
“I’m sorry for making you talk, kiddo,” Dean said, glancing at the bracelet wrapped around her wrist. “I didn’t mean to force you into it.”
Dean ruffled her hair, “You don’t have to thank us, kid. You needed a car, and the Men of Letters left a bunch here. That’s it. You don’t owe us shit.”
As soon as she was in the driver’s seat, she tugged her phone out of the zipped pocket of her leather jacket and dialed Cas’ number. It only rang a few times before he answered.
“Not good company then,” John smirked as if he didn’t even hear Cas’ threat. “Where’s Sam? We need to talk.”
“That was very fascinating Dean, thank you for sharing with me,” Cas said sincerely. “Despite watching over Earth for all these eons, I have not taken the time to really appreciate the things that humans have discovered and invented. You have given me that chance tonight and I appreciate it greatly.”
“So the last seal is Lilith?” Mary asked, a bit confused. “What does that mean?”
“Feeling better?” Dean asked, once again kneeling in front of her as he put a new pair of socks and her boots back on her feet. She wasn’t sure how, but the clean clothes did help, telling him as much. “Good, now we gotta get outta here before they find the bloody bandages.” He shoved them deep in the trashcan as he spoke, slinging his bag with Claire’s dirty clothes and his first aid kit over his shoulder before helping Claire back to her feet. They left the bathroom to be met with Cas and a bag of food, and the three of them quickly left the rest stop and made their way across the parking lot to their cars. Dean helped her into the backseat of the Impala and she slumped over a little.
Claire checked the map she had pulled up on her phone. “We’re close to the bunker, we could go visit,” she called from her spot on the motel bed. Kaia poked her head out of the bathroom with raised eyebrows.
“Oh uh - I, I’m sorry. I was going to pay for these, I just -” Sam stuttered out, tripping over his words.
“Set,” one of the female deities warned, “Michael wouldn’t want his vessel to be damaged.”
“You will be there one day, Sam,” Cas said. He sounded very sure, almost as if he was promising the declaration. “Your soul is good and bright.”
“Can you even eat? Or do you need to?” Claire asked. “Cas never ate when he was an angel, said everything tasted like molecules.”
“You...you lying little queer!” Claire saw John rushing toward her and before she could tell what was happening, she was hunched over and John was above her with a knife in his gut. And her hand was wrapped around the handle. “You…” John tried to say, though as she spoke, he spat up blood. Claire could do nothing but watch in horror as he slid to the floor, the knife easily slipping from her grip as John’s body sprawled over the tiles, blood pooling around him.
Rowena had been delighted to receive a call from the Winchesters requesting that she come back out to the bunker to meet and help out with their nephilim. While she hadn’t been totally sure of what to expect, she was certainly surprised by Jack.
“Well we’re running out of options, Dad,” Dean said. “This thing keeps killing and we’re no closer to finding out what or where it is.”
“Oh he - he was just washing up.  So, w-who would like to say grace?”  His mother is fluttering around the kitchen, nervous.  Like she always is.
“That’s...really nice actually,” Claire said quietly, swallowing heavily.
Jo shook her head, “I don’t understand but my mom said that he would explain when he gets here. She said an angel pulled him outta hell and that they’re on their way right now.”
“I quit when I found out I was pregnant with Dean. It wasn’t something I wanted my babies around, even if your father disagreed. He still smoked a pack a day,” Mary said with a small laugh. “It’s not something I’m very proud of.”
“He’s also God,” Claire smirked. “I think I couldn’t ask for a better hunting partner.” Dean rolled his eyes as he took a sip of his coffee. “I’ll go get packed so we can head out first thing.” Claire left the library, running into Cas on her way to her bedroom.
The mention of John resulted in an uncomfortable silence, so Bobby spoke up, “So how do we go about tracking Famine down, then? Do we actually know anything about it?”
“Where is Cas?” Jack asked, glancing around. He always thought that the two of them would go together.
“Don’t worry about it, Jack. I heard what you said and I can talk to Sam and Dean about everything later. For now, you just go be with them, okay? They’ll find me when they’re ready.” Jack nodded gratefully and Mary watched as he flew away.
Dean felt his stomach drop and he reached over to grab Cas’ hand, knuckles going white. Claire was still crying against Kaia’s shoulder and everyone waited with bated breath for more news.
“Hey!  Shut up.  You’re just too picky,” Dean protested.
Sam shook his head, “I still don’t know. This angel, Castiel, pulled me out of Hell. He said something about Heaven having a plan for me, and how I needed to be alive to finish my mission on Earth.”
“It’s my job, Sammy.”
It’s Bobby’s turn to laugh, “A good example?  Is that what you’ve been doing these couple’a years?  Chasing after a ghost and dragging them along?”
Once Kaia had told everyone about her plans to go to school in Sioux Falls - Sam, true to his word, kept her secret - they decided that it would be best for Claire and Kaia to take a trip to Sioux Falls just to see what it was like, before they officially moved in. Both Claire and Kaia knew that this was mostly just an excuse for Sam and Dean to visit their mom and friends.
“I’ll stay up for a bit, be on the balcony if you need anything,” Dean said, throwing the trash from their dinner away before grabbing his beer to head out to the small balcony. He dropped onto the bench and took a long swig, looking up at the night sky.
Dean cut him off, eyes wide, “It’s okay, Sammy, it’s just...” he swallowed heavily as he panicked internally, trying to come up with something better to say than
Jo returned to the room moments later, a look of utter perplexity on her face, “Mary…” she started, waiting until Mary’s eyes were open, “I don’t know how to tell you this but… Sam is on his way.”
“Because I was curious and wanted to know more about the bunker without the risk of you finding out until after,” Claire clapped a hand over her mouth as soon as she finished her sentence.
“That was badass,” Claire said with a wide grin. “He practically pissed himself!”
“Well, yeah, but before all this,” Dean pulled onto the road and began heading back for the motel. “Are you hungry? I don’t really think I am after what we’ve seen but…”
“Is it because we haven’t spent time together lately? I’ve missed our talks,” Cas said quietly.
“I know Jack, I know she would never do something like this on purpose,” Cas said. “You’re calling me so that I can tell Sam and Dean?”
Suddenly, there was a scuff on the floor to her right and she stood, aiming and pulling the trigger. Her bullet made contact with the rugaru’s head, thankful, but as he was dying he rushed her, throwing her back into the shelves against the wall. The shelves were full of old paint cans and cleaners and as she fell to the ground, she could feel something dripping all over her head and back.
John huffed, and made his way toward the building that stood before them - a warehouse of some kind, Cas noted.
She was startled anyway, “Jesus Christ, Dean,” she said, slightly breathless, “I need to get you a bell or something, fuck.”
“Put that gun down, boy, you ain’t gonna shoot me.” John took a step closer to Dean, glancing at his gun that rested on the table on the other side of the room. “You ain’t got the balls to shoot your father. Just like you ain’t got the balls to protect Sammy.”
This particular time, he showed up with a duffel and a mission, “There’s a pretty sizeable vamp nest that needs to be taken care of,” he said gruffly, walking through the doors of the bunker like he owned the place, pointedly not greeting Cas or Jack - symbols of his eldest’s transgressions.
“Unfortunately, yes, I do. There is currently a battle ongoing in eastern Europe that I must participate in. WIth any luck, we will secure a victory soon and I will be able to return and help with anything necessary from anyone that requires my assistance,” Cas hadn’t taken his eyes off Dean the entire time he spoke.
“Oh,” Cas whispered, letting his hands, which had previously sat awkwardly on his knees, come up to grip Dean's arms. “And are you mine?”
He shook his head, “I have some things to attend to, but if you are able to find a location, you can pray to me and I will come help out however I can.”
“Maybe her boyfriend isn’t doing his job if she needs to watch that kind of movie,” Claire scoffed.
“Okay,” Dean said, maintaining eye contact with Cas. “Kids get to bed, we’ll figure this out.”
“You’re not gonna heal her,” Dean said shortly. “She got hurt on the hunt, she needs to deal with the consequences and learn her lesson to be more careful.” Jack tried to protest but shut his mouth with one look from Dean, sitting quietly next to Claire at the table. She knew that Jack considered Cas and Dean his fathers, but was he really going to obey them like that? He was
.  He’s gasping for breath then and standing and shoving everything he can into the bag.  His head is buzzing.
“I missed you too, kid. But it looks like you were pretty busy up here, huh?” Dean pulled back just enough to look Jack up and down. “God looks good on you, kid.”
“Yeah yeah, Sammy, I remember,” Dean grumbled, pulling his keys from his pocket. “Work then play.” They drove closer to the center of town, finding a small inn to rent a room in. They got set up pretty quickly, dropping their bags onto their respective beds.
Sam remained silent, so Cas continued, “I see that you’re upset, and I’m sorry to have been the cause of that. If you would prefer, I can go in and get your mother or Dean.”
“Oh,” Claire was quiet, thinking over Jack’s words in hyperspeed.
“Wait, I thought you would want to be near your family,” Jack said, turning to face Dean. “That’s why I put them all so close.”
Dean’s eyes widened, “Because of Jimmy? Oh god - is she okay?”
“So, Jack,” Claire said, looking up from her spot on the couch. “Have you ever explored the bunker?”
“Do what?” Castiel closed the book and turned to look at her.
“That’s not the point, and you know it, Claire,” Dean snapped. “Something could have happened to either one of you, or both, and we wouldn’t have known about it!”
Jack shook his head, so she cracked one open and handed it to him, “It won’t taste good, but after a few you’ll feel good.”
Claire climbed into the backseat carefully, sipping her hot chocolate as they left the tree lot. This was the happiest she had felt in a long time, and the only way it could be better was if her brother was here too.
“What are you talking about? How did he treat Dean?” Mary asked, brows furrowed in obvious confusion.
“You as well, Dean,” Cas said, returning the smile before he disappeared with a small gust of wind. Dean turned to look at Sam, chuckling a bit when his brother was just staring at him wide-eyed and speechless.
“I did,” Dean nodded, patting the car next to him. “Come on, sit.”
“First, I’m going to make some coffee, Cas is outside praying to Gabe, so hopefully he can help us figure something out,” Dean replied, making for the kitchen.
“Does John know about you two?” Claire asked, not wanting to out Dean.
“The silver lining, I suppose,” Castiel said with a crooked smile, Claire returning it with her own matching one.
The air around them pulsed with a kind of energy that neither of the brothers had ever felt before, despite their frequent proximity to Cas, and other supernatural beings. Sam supposed, off-handedly, that the shift was due to the fact that these beings were far more powerful than any they had encountered before. Dean mentally inventoried the number of Colt bullets he had with him, knowing that it was far from enough to get them out of the room alive. He reached out and squeezed Sam’s arm briefly, as much of a goodbye as he was going to get.
Luckily, Sam returned with the food only a few minutes after Dean exited the shower, providing a perfect distraction to the brothers to keep them from noticing Cas’ change in behavior. He knew it wouldn’t last though, so once Sam had dumped all the wrappers in the trash can, Cas cleared his throat to gain their attention.
“And why would I do that?” War tried to sound smug but his voice was strained. Sam yanked Ruby’s knife out and pressed the blade to War’s finger, just under the gold band.
“We’ll figure it out. We always do,” Sam said. “I think I might have found something anyway. In most cultures, there’s always someone who carries a soul into the afterlife. In Greece and Rome, it was Charon, others the Grim reaper, or even just Death itself. So what if that’s what’s happening in this town? There’s no Death, no one to take anyone to the afterlife?”
She looked up and met his eyes, “Sam didn’t tell you, then?”
“So what’s the game plan?” Dean asked after he had pulled back onto the highway. “It’s a nursing home, not like we can just walk in.”
“Sammy, that man was a monster long before he got possessed by Azazel. You did what you had to do, and you saved both of us. From the demon, but also from him. Of course I’m… sad, I guess, but mostly I just feel…” he swallowed and looked over at Sam, “relief. He’ll never hurt either of us ever again.”
“Oh,” said Cas, “I can just fly them back now if they’re ready.”
“Shoot me, dammit,” encouraged John, or the monster inside him.
And his mother will hop up to get him and mutter apologies.  Maybe she’ll bump into his chair and he’ll tell her to be less goddamn clumsy and his mother will apologize some more and hand him the knife with shaking hands.  They’ll sit in silence until his father complains that they aren’t having meatloaf, and then he’ll look at Bobby and say
“What is the glitter for?” Jack asked as they drove back to the bunker.
“He needs to man up!  He knows how this life is.  Needs to set a good example for Sammy!”
“Well,” Dean started, “We have a knife that could work too…”
As Claire lifted the lid off the box, Cas continued, more choked up than he wanted to admit, “So that you can always come home.”
“Don’t tell me what to do.”  He’s quiet, again, when he says it.
“I look forward to spending time with you too, Cas,” Dean admitted, feeling his cheeks heat up, knowing they would be a bright red.
“And then...then he started getting ideas. That I was staring too long at boys. Taking an interest where I shouldn’t. And it got worse. Sent me on my first solo hunt, a couple of ghosts of some queer nuns, as if to tell me that- that being a fag meant going to Hell.”
“Sounds good,” Kaia agreed, finally looking up from her book to see Claire’s eyes on her. “What?”
He doesn’t realize he’s crying until Bobby is suddenly in the doorway asking, “Need any help?”  Dean freezes.  He should be better at lying.  “Dean?”  He’s shoving in clothes now, chest heaving.  “Dean?  Stop for a second, stop.  Look at me, son, just breathe.”  Bobby gets a hand on his back and says, “It’s okay, just breathe.”

Ellen walked into the room, Ash just a few steps behind her. She surged forward and hugged each of them, “Shit, it’s been a while since the last time we were all together. It’s good to see everyone up and walking,” she said with a bit of a laugh, “Especially you, Sam.”
“I called you Dad,” Jack said. “Is that...is that okay?”
“Be careful not to spill it,” Cas warned her as she sat down. Claire rolled her eyes but figured it would be better not to comment, taking a large bite of her cereal instead. They sat together in a comfortable silence for a long while, Claire getting passed a book once she finished her food.
“Holy shit, you’re invisible!” Claire exclaimed, and Jack opened his eyes. He looked down and surely enough, his body was gone. He took a deep breath and allowed himself to be seen once more, beaming at his two friends as they began bombarding him with questions about what it felt like.
“Here’s how this is gonna go,” Dean’s tone left no room for argument. “I’m gonna take you inside so that we can clean your leg and get a new bandage on it. Then we’re gonna get some food in you, cause I can guarantee your blood sugar is way too fucking low.”
“Oh, something simple. Perhaps a peanut butter and jelly sandwich?” Cas suggested, sounding unsure.
“Thank you,” he muttered. “I’m not sure what you did, but thanks.”
“No, no, you’re fine. Castiel is an angel, he pulled me out of Hell and then I had him heal you. Everything is okay now.” Sam said, rushing to get all of the words out before Dean could spiral.
Dean laughed a bit at that, “Well, you don’t need a husband, and you don’t need to go to college. Did you graduate high school?”
“I’m sorry, what?
.  His mother will try and talk about her bible study group until Dad snaps at her.  And that’ll be that.
Once in the hallway, Sam and Dean were shocked to find the door to the room next to them wide open, empty of any occupants. 	They walked through the rest of the hallway, only to discover that every other room in the hallway. An exploration of the rest of the hotel proved much of the same, as if everyone they’d seen just an hour earlier had vanished into thin air.
“Funyuns and bean dip is gross, ask anybody!”
“Dean!” Mary called, eyeing the folder on the table, “Come down here!”
Dean nodded, “Does it help, talking to Sam about that stuff since he’s been there too?”
Once everyone was gathered around the table, Rowena gushed about all of the progress that Jack had made in just one afternoon.
“We all have our vices, mom, nothing to be ashamed of,” Dean said and kissed her cheek before gagging. “But damn do you need a shower now. So do you, old man, you smell like a liquor store.” Bobby rolled his eyes.
“I can help with that,” Castiel said from the doorway.
“That I wasted a bullet,” Dean went on, “He wouldn’t be proud of me, he’d tear me a new one.”
Before Claire knew it, it had been over two months since she was completely healed and given her car keys back, but she had yet to even try and find a hunt. She needed to, though, she was growing restless, and her daily walks with Miracle weren’t cutting it.
you, man. We’re about to die here, I don’t know where you are but I needed you to know before I die.”
“Ellen, it’s me, I swear. An angel pulled me out of Hell, he said my time on Earth wasn’t over yet.” he turned to Castiel, “Tell her Castiel, I’m human.”
“That’s why I’m here, your mother. I found a way to bring her back,” the room was dead silent, Claire glancing between the two Winchester brothers as they had a silent conversation between themselves. Jack moved closer to Claire, standing slightly behind her and taking her free hand in both of his. She knew he needed it, needed the comfort, and she was going to give it to him as his pseudo big sister.
“So what do we do? Where are the reapers?” Dean asked, ignoring how smug Sam was.
“It’s a demon thing,” Sam spoke up, “Our friend Jody needs our help. There’s no way we can get out of it.”
“I should prepare you, though,” Cas said, “He’s not actually a baby. After his birth he was able to age himself up. Dean would guess that he’s physically in his twenties, but we haven’t been able to figure out his mental age quite yet. He’s able to talk, but there are many things he doesn’t know. It’ll be an interesting experience to observe him.”
“We just scoop some in and move it around so it sticks to the butter?” Claire shrugged and dumped a little bit of flour into each pan. By the time they were all covered, both Claire and Jack were covered in flour, though she wasn’t entirely sure how it happened. They began working through the recipe, the mess increasing the further along they got and by the time the cakes were in the oven, they were covered in their dry mixture, Jack had egg in his hair, and Claire had some melted chocolate swiped over her forehead and cheeks.
“Come on, love, take me to bed. I need to be up bright and early to go to work,” she said with a laugh, clinging to Sam as he stood with her still in his grip.
“Okay,” Sam agreed, backing into the corner of his isolated table, flask clutched in his hand. Dean hung up - likely to help Bobby and Mary collect the necessary ingredients. Only a few minutes later, Bela flickered back to life in front of him.
He shoots.  Somebody screams.
“When I took over as God, I recreated Heaven into paradise for people that deserve it. People who are good and kind. People who tried and sometimes succeeded to make a positive difference while they were on Earth,” Jack explained. “You did not. You did none of those things, and thus, you do not belong in Heaven any longer. Dean deserves to have the peace of mind that you will never be able to hurt him again. That your opinions of him and what you could do will never weigh on his mind. He deserves to be happy.”
“Sam, Dean is hurt real bad, they don’t know if he’s going to pull through.”
Dean hesitated, looking out the window for a moment. He took a deep breath, and then turned back to Sam, “No. We’re going to get the hell out of here.”
“Go wash your makeup off, at least,” Kaia told her, leaning in to press a kiss to Claire’s lips. Claire kissed back but huffed when Kaia pushed her off the bed and toward the bathroom. Claire quickly used a makeup wipe to get off all the makeup she had on and dropped it in the trash can before slapping on some moisturizer that Kaia insisted she used.
“What about it, kiddo?” Dean glanced around as they walked, Claire supposed making sure no one was paying them too much attention.
“That is not true. Every phrase on Earth has an origin and meaning, human,” Cas said stubbornly. Dean pulled back quickly, eyebrows furrowed as he looked at Cas.
“I’m fine, really,” Claire said, blinking slowly up at him.
“You’re just going to walk in there and shoot her,” Death deadpanned, “I’m sure she wouldn’t see that coming.”
“What happened?” He asked, concerned.
As a result of the encounter with Naomi, Sam and Dean had utilized every resource at their disposal. It was a good thing that the bunker had far more rooms than they could ever fill, because at their call, Mary, Bobby, Karen, Jody and Donna had crammed into Mary’s SUV and made the drive to Lebanon within a few hours. The next few days were like nothing that Claire, Kaia or Jack had ever seen. Coffee was flowing constantly, and at least 3 people were awake and strategizing in the War Room at any given time.
“There, are you happy now?” Claire asked, flipping the switch off in the bathroom and throwing herself on the bed.
“Hello Jack,” Cas replied, returning his smile, “I want you to meet Claire and Kaia. They live here too.”
Bobby clapped a hand on Dean’s shoulder, “You don’t have to talk to me about it if you don’t want to, but don’t lie to me either.”
Laughing, Jake approached Dean, “Your brother is dead, why are you even bothering with this? The end is inevitable and you’re choosing the wrong side.”
“I don’t need to listen to the music to tell you that, Dean,” Cas said, sending Dean spiraling once more. This was flirting, he was definitely flirting with Cas, and it seemed like Cas was flirting with him. But the guy didn’t even know what a fucking engine was, how in the world was he supposed to understand the nuances of romance?
“I suppose that we could fake an emergency,” Cas said. “Gather everyone’s attention in one place and then grab Pestilence when no one will notice a single doctor missing. Though, that plan has far more ways to go wrong.”
“Absolutely fucking not,” Dean growled, cutting Cas off as soon as he realized the angel was offering
“Yes, Dean?” Cas’ voice was soft, and he was smiling at Dean already.
This is the smutty chapter, I believe there's two sex scenes and one sex dream, so buckle up for this one.
“I am Odin, and the only reason I have yet to smite you, is out of respect for the archangel Michael’s desire not to have to rebuild his vessel when the time comes.”
“It’s been a while since I have ridden in a car,” he said, and Claire thought he sounded...melancholy.
Kaia looked down at her hands for a moment, steeling herself, “Sam has been helping me apply to some colleges and...I got accepted to one that I want to go to. Sam said that the Men of Letters have some crazy savings and that they’ll pay for all of it and...I really want to go to college, Claire.”
“What the hell are you? Sam is dead, he’s been dead for 4 months. That poor family has been through enough, and
“Wh-what?” He mumbled, looking around, letting out a deep sigh of relief when he saw their rented room rather than the deep red of Hell. “What happened?”
Cas swallowed the lump that built up in his throat at that. He knew he could get through this. Two days at most with his boyfriend’s father was nothing in comparison to the millennia he’d spent, bent to the will of an oppressive Heaven. He shoved one of their machetes in his duffel bag, and turned to leave the room, only to see that Dean had joined him.
“See you too, Cas,” Dean whispered just as Cas disappeared with a rustle of wind.
“Good, chicks dig scars.” Dean laughed at that, and Claire thought maybe being stuck at the bunker for a bit wouldn’t be the worst thing in the world.
“I’m more worried about you than my upholstery,” Dean said and then they were inside and headed straight to the bathroom. Claire’s vision was going a little hazy and it was getting harder to walk with every step. Luckily, they seemed to reach the bathroom just in time for Claire’s legs to give out under her, though, once again, Dean caught her before she could hit the tile floor. She could hear him muttering to himself but couldn’t make out the words, just knew that he picked her up and set her on the closed toilet. “Claire!”
“Why did you do it?” she asked quietly, crossing her arms over her chest.
“My god, you never shut up,” Sam huffed. “Just tell me where Lilith is and I’ll make carving that ring off your finger as painless as possible.”
“Let’s not worry about that right now,” Kaia took Claire’s hand and pulled her out of the kitchen and away from the body. “Why don’t we get you in the shower?” Claire didn’t bother to say anything as she followed Kaia, Jack stepping out of their room to frown as they passed.
“You know where Dean keeps the good booze in this place?” Claire took a deep breath as she watched John, as he moved to block her path from leaving.
“Oh, I’m just sneaking in with you and then I’m gonna go find this son of a bitch,” Claire waved her hand. “You’ll be fine, you know everything, remember? Just make sure it’s dumbed down enough for eight year olds.”
“Dammit,” Dean said, getting up off the bed, “Is it really too much to ask for one fucking day off?”
Cas sat in a chair in the corner of the room, and when Rowena realized he wasn’t going to leave, she turned to Jack. “Well, why don’t you show me what you can do, then?”
“Sounds good, Dean-o,” Claire whispered. She couldn’t really focus as Dean worked on her leg, though she did feel the sting of the antiseptic and instinctively kicked out, catching Dean in the ribs.
“Nice to meet you, now could you tell me who the fuck you are and why you’re in my boys’ bunker?” he asked pointedly.
“Aww, why not?” Dean whined.
“What is that?” she asked, eyebrows raised. “That looks like a completely different language.”
“I’m okay,” replied, Jo, sitting down at the kitchen table. She opened up her bag, pulling out a manilla folder and her laptop.
“Yeah, sure. Come on in,” Claire stepped back, letting Jack into her room. He looked around, at the different pictures she had taped to the walls and all her shit that she left cluttered on her desk. “So what did you want to talk about?”
Claire was walking Miracle along the road a week after Jack’s visit when he suddenly appeared in front of her. “Holy shit!” she jumped, hand already reaching for the knife in her boot.
“Why?” Sam asked.
“What demon have you ever seen that could handle a full exorcism rite, not even flinch at holy water, but then cower at the sight of a shotgun?” Dean retorted.
“Should we go in? See if we can’t figure out what’s going on?” Dean suggested, driving slowly past the hospital.
“A hunter, Krissy, needs some help with the lore on a case she’s working,” Dean said. “We’re just helping her out.”
“We could go old school and do all the classics. Take the batteries out of the remotes, tape down the sprayer on the sink. Oh, there was a kid in one of the group homes that once those googly eyes on like, everything he could reach in the entire kitchen and living room,” Kaia said thoughtfully.
“Yeah, and just cause you’re all-powerful or whatever doesn’t mean you don’t need your vegetables,” Dean said definitively, which Claire couldn’t help but snort at.
“Hello, Rowena. Thank you for coming.”
“You did,” Dean nodded. “What do you know about cars, Cas?”
The next few minutes were a haze of shouting out exorcisms in broken parts and pushing back the demons without physically harming them as much as they could manage - even if they were real demons, there were likely still humans in there.
“Claire…” Cas looked close to tears. “I had no idea you felt that way.”
“Obviously not!” Sam turned to stare forward at the road quickly. “Oh my god.”
Cas sighed, a bit frustrated with himself, “I thought I recognized one of the vessels but, as a human my memory isn’t as good as it once was. It took me a bit of time to place where I remembered it from.”
“So what next?” he asked, nervously glancing at Dean.
The bunker was still empty when Cas got back the following morning. His phone call with Dean after the fact had been stilted and awkward, and he knew that Dean was holding back emotions so that he didn’t take them out on Cas.
Chaos broke out, gunshots and shouting from more directions than Azazel could keep track of. While none of the shots damaged him, his shock was evident. Mary seized the moment of his confusion, aimed and cocked the Colt. She screamed  “This is for my boys, you fucking asshole,” and pulled the trigger. Miraculously, the shot hit home and Azazel twitched and flashed before them, eventually crumpling on the ground.
“Oh Jackie, I’ve taught you so well,” Claire said proudly, ruffling his hair. “Now let’s get all this paint washed out and then we’ll have dinner and a show.
Cas cleared his throat, when he determined that the moment was right. “Claire, Kaia, when we thought about the two of you going out, living on your own out in Sioux Falls, we weren’t sure of what kind of gift to get you. We knew you had all the furniture you needed, we knew you wouldn’t want us picking out clothes for you… but we finally figured it out. We wanted to give you this,” he said as he handed them a small box.
Also: John is creepy and predatory toward Claire
“As I predicted, it has been warded against angels,” he said.
“She called me on my way back. It’s not anything I’ve ever even heard a whisper of,” Bobby shook his head. “People surviving things they shouldn’t, no one dying? Sounds like death just...took a vacation.”
“Well then, get outta that accountant get up and come here,” Dean said, gesturing to the Impala. Castiel looked unsure as he took off the trench coat and suit jacket, but did as he was told anyway. Dean rolled his eyes fondly and walked over, rolling up Cas’ sleeves for him, as well as undoing the tie. Dean did his best to not think about how close they were standing or just how easy it would be to lean in. He cleared his throat and stepped back.
“Yeah, thanks Cas,” Claire mumbled as she rolled onto her stomach. She heard him say something back and felt a small touch against the side of her head before she was asleep.
“I don’t like you going after this guy on your own,” Jack said apprehensively.
“I said we don’t need his help. Don’t you fucking dare call him behind my back either,” John ordered, and Sam shook his head, letting out a huff.
