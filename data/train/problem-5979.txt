“I’m sorry. You can’t die yet.” A voice he remembers with startling clarity interrupts the panic enough that he thinks to wake up, but only manages to black out.
He buys a plain black baseball cap and listens to her talk about the tom cats preference for sardines like he never scratched behind its ear.As if he never bought a set of fine leather gloves too small for his own hands from this very store. He knows, is completely certain he never once came in here.
They both look around, frantically, as Tony waves his brilliant deep red and gold hand in some attempt to have the air cool it. Rhodey manages to spot the small kitchen sink behind said waving hand and yanks Tony’s arm to guide him over to it.
like Steve is the single most attractive person on this earth, but it’s
The pause this time feels heavy, but only lasts a few moments before it’s cut with, “I’m afraid he is unavailable today.” Steve draws up short, large water bottle in one hand, the other stretching out to turn on the tap.
“We will both get out of here.” His voice is too loud and dry, but he does not clear his throat or move to look at Yinsen when the older man jumps at the sudden burst. The room descends back into their shared silence for a stretch of precisely measured time.
“Yeah, I think I saw someone eating the Carbonara, I’ve been wanting to try it ever since. I bet I’d love it.” Steve tells him, picking his sketchbook back up. If Tony wants to get back to work, he can do the same.
His sweatpants feel somehow too tight and he can’t hope to stop the shifts of his hips. Steve is getting bolder, mouth wet and so inviting, hands running up and down Tony’s back like he needs to map every contour. He keeps licking along the top of Tonys tongue, pulling it into his mouth and biting lightly into it before repeating the motion with Tony’s bottom lip. It’s rhythmic and predictable and Tony is losing his mind over it. His lips are buzzing, overfull with blood and so wonderfully sore. They feel bruised, tender and everytime Steve switches between his tongue and lip Tony shivers.
“This is good.” Tony chokes out, literally chokes on the saliva in his mouth as he says it and has to cough a few times to clear it out.
“No! I am not alright!” Tony shouts back, but the flinch Pepper gives in return sucks all the fight out of him. Sagging, he falls back down into his chair and lets his head loll back behind him. Pepper stays standing for a moment, face back to its bewilderment from before.
“What the hell?! Your hand!” And he is sitting up in a rush, very insistently ignoring the way the whole room spins around at the movement. The jolt seems to wake Tony who yanks his hand off like it’s been burned, because well, it fucking has been. It’s bright red and shining and hell Rhodey has never seen a burn so bad it glimmers like that, but he is sure as shit freaking the fuck out about it.
He does not open with his father, does not so much as mention him. He does not sit down nor implore the reporters to do the same. He does not show a single shred of weakness this time, not even the slightest of micromovements for the hyenas to use when insisting this announcement is a part of his nervous breakdown. No, this time he stands straight and rigid behind a microphone with all the conviction and power of a battle worn superhero.
He looks at the face plate for a long moment, takes a few measured breaths. His palms feel wet. “It was a ring box.” Steve finally lets out in one huff, brow going tight and worried. For a second the room is so completely and utterly silent. Something coils around his chest and he forces himself to look back into the eye slits of the suit. “With a ring in it.” He continues, rather pointlessly because Iron Man seems to perfectly understand the seriousness now.
“I tried.” Steve hears Tony say, feels the way the words move his lips against the skin of his neck. “I tried over and over, but no one knew and I couldn’t say anything.” A shaky breath and Tony pulls back. His face is begging, apologetic and heartbroken. “I tried and nothing would come out.”
“My parents died this time of year. In a car crash, sure you’ve read the file.” It feels right to say it outloud to Steve. Feels right to chop off another piece of his heart and give it away. Somehow it even feels right that Steve would recoil at the reveal, that he would grimace and look away like this is finally the too much Tony always knew he would be for anyone. “I’ve been…trying. You know I’ve been trying?” He asks, one last desperate grap to pull them back into something better than where they are now.
“That’s not true.” He feels himself reply, but he is more focused on looking at Stark. Something in his chest feels both too tight and gapingly empty. He feels rotten for not seeing the kindness in those eyes before, feels cheated out of years of good friendship simply because he made assumptions. Yet, it seems right that he would be punished. For years he wanted people to actually get to know him, for people to stop deciding his limitations and abilities from one glance. Then the second he could repay the favor to someone else he made the same mistakes. No one with such a genuine smile could be the selfish man Steve always told himself Stark had to be.
Hawkeye tries a couple exploding arrows, but after watching four of them sink into the gooey bodies as they expand around the delayed rattle of the explosion, he joins Widow in civilian rescue. Steve stays close to Iron Man, using his shield to magnify his repulsors. They manage two takedowns in a row with this method alongside well timed blasts of lightning from Thor just before the mounds can seal themself back up. Bruce is assisting shield on the perimeter as it is clear Hulk’s skill set might not be appreciated for this fight.
Steve swallows thickly when he realizes Tony stopped telling him about his upcoming trip to Japan. Looking up nearly steals all the air from his lungs. Tony is looking at him like he knows exactly what Steve is thinking. Tony is looking at him like he is thinking about the same thing, like he wants to see something on his finger as much as Steve. It’s too much, it’s far too much and Steve won’t let himself act as insane as he feels right now.
handbasket of doom, Tony might have given into the panic attack such revelation threatened. Instead, he treated Mr. Golden Boy like a bag of dirt and ran away from him at nearly every opportunity. When the guy only seemed to take that as a queue to hunt him down and press in closer, Tony realized the whole thing went both ways. Then he really did give into the panic a little bit.
"Shit." The serum was something of beauty sure, over all something stunningly amazing. Certainly a memory like that was a blessing more often than not, but Tony feels himself suddenly wishing for someway to eliminate that particular side effect. He shuffles closer to Steve, pressing his check into the hard bone of the other man’s shoulder.
But Steve doesn’t take the bait, doesn’t so much as flinch, just keeps gazing at Tony like he is something of importance. It makes sense, because before all else Steve is stubborn. He is Tony’s immovable object and for all the years Tony believed himself an unstoppable force, they managed to answer that age old question. The object wins, the object wins everytime.
“Alive. Both of us.” Yinsen smiles at the word alive, trusting and weary. “We are gonna get out of this shit hole. Together.”
With Steve though, Tony wants to fill up his entire day with his presence. He goes on movie dates with him, actual real paying attention to the plot and sharing a popcorn, movie dates. He sits in a dark room with the guy for several hours and feels no need to try for more than resting his head on his shoulder. They sit in the second row, Steve eats the entire bag of twizzlers before the previews finish, Tony laughs and it’s so perfect Tony will never be able to go to a theatre without him.
Tony beams, his eyes crinkle up and his lips pull to show his teeth and Steve wants to do something insane. Wants to go back into his bedroom and get the ring box and make an idiot out of himself.
“Tony, please.” Stark replies without pause, smile so bright and beautiful.
He starts rocking in wider arcs, drawing big circles with his hips. Steve is letting out an array of deep contented noises, pressing them right into Tony’s tongue, right into the roof of his mouth until he can’t be sure who the noises are coming from anymore. It’s maddening, impossibly wonderful and Tony just wants to melt completely, wants to turn up the heat until he and Steve can be fused into a new shape all together.
Here lies Tony Stark. He died as he lived. Regretting.
“Oh, you’ve seen it before?” Tony asks, but he is already turning back to the work he’d been so focused on earlier. His smile is firmly in place though, so Steve doesn’t bother to feel hurt by the sudden departure from their conversation.
“Well, let me know if you need any help. The back wall is all 50 percent off.” She tells him and he pulls his eyes off of her. The room is chilled, though he knows the A/C hasn’t been fixed since her husband passed two years ago.
“It’s a hard holiday for the lonely.” Steve admits and it may not be the right secret, but it feels like a confession all the same. Without hesitation, Tony softens, lets out all his tension in a breath and resolves to be whatever Steve needs.
“Or.” Steve cuts him off, only to shut his mouth and take a deep steadying breath through his nose. The exhale fans over Tony’s wet lips and that certainly should not be allowed ever. Steve’s hands unclench from the fabric at Tony’s back and slowly inch down, fingers getting closer and closer to the swell of Tony’s ass. It makes something, something important probably, short out in his brain. “You could
“Together.” He mouths to himself, fingers too tight against the box. He can feel the material starting to give, can see the little indents pushing in under his grip. It feels pointless, but he opens the top with a flick of his thumb and gasps at the ring sitting in a bed of deep red velvet. His knees feel like water, a fresh sweat is breaking out on his skin. Yet, he stays upright and fused in place.
“Yeah, of course. Just thinking. I’ve got a bit to finish up over here, but I can be ready around 7, sound good?” He says quickly, spinning once in his chair and winking at Steve before going back to the screen. The jumps from one tone to another may be fascinating, but sometimes they really leave Steve spinning.
"Steve, just.” It takes a little maneuvering, but Tony gets himself tucked shoulder to shoulder with Steve and all the layers draped over both of them. “Just, let me, okay?"
Tony’s hands join Yinsen’s, uselessly trying to press in on the multitude of wounds. Dammit dammit dammit. The blood is drizzling out and if Tony never sees a machhine gun again it will be so unbelievably too soon. God, he really did not want to live in that cave again.
Starks worries where not unwarranted and Steve knew what he needed to do. Technology may be impossibly talented these days, but nothing beats good old fashion on hands work. When he finds the crate of weapons, he sort of wishes he felt the tiniest bit surprised. Seems the world hadn’t changed much at all.
“You’ll finish before even your due date.” Tony gladly takes the water and savors the lukewarm liquid. He simply nods and passes the canister back, taking a moment to crack his spine.
“It is what it is. I have moved on.” She looks incredulous even though Tony really can say the statement is true. That opens a can of worms though, so he gives into her disbelief. “At least I will once I catch the guy in this and I don’t want you or Rhodey even remotely involved.”
“Get some rest.” He tells him, letting himself pat his shoulder once before turning to the door. He decides not to look back, but calls out before entering the hallway, “I’ll see you in the morning.”
At T minus 20 minutes they sit side by side, code fully uploaded and power sequence on stand by for start up. The crude bullet resistant vest Tony constructed is sewn into the lining of Yinsen’s waistcoat and fitted snugly against the thin man’s chest. Tony’s own body is cocooned in tightly tied leather, which securely presses a history of the next eight years into the small of his back. No words are spoken for long minutes, no words have been spoken for nearly an hour. Not since they sat down with nothing to do but wait and hold their breath against the adrenaline itching to rush into their veins.
When Natasha leaves the room, a quirked eyebrow and shake of the head as a farewell, he decides waiting here is getting ridiculous.
Steve puls back with a pop, but his arm gets even tighter, fingers digging into Tony’s side and the keening that illisits is completely involuntary. It makes Steve’s eyes go wide and Tony bites down on his lip to try and get himself under control. It may have been a long fucking while since he’s been with anyone, but jesus he has never been this needy for it.
“He has connections Pep, more than even I know about. This is dangerous and I will not let you guys put yourselves at risk.” Tony all but pleads. She still looks angry, though there is more concern there and he thinks he may be able to separate her from the mess yet. “He doesn’t know I know anything yet. I have the advantage and if I can pull the information together, he won’t know anything hit him until they are carting him off.”
“What?” Steve chokes out.
That voice is what finally does him in and Tony lets the tears well up in his eyes. Lets them spillover as his breath goes uneven. God he missed JARVIS.
“Oh, please. Yes, get them off. Touch me, touch me.” Tony babbles, lifting his hips and wiggling back and forth to get his free hand in to help. He can’t let go of Steve, doesn’t even consider the idea, and it makes for some interesting contortion. They manage though and soon the fabric of both his boxers and sweats are pooling around his knees and Steve is grabbing him.
Steve’s fingers spasm again, tapping an unsteady staccato rhythm into the sides of Tony’s legs and it shakes some of the haze loose. He pulls up properly this time, straightens his back enough that Steve has to look up to keep their eyes locked. Tony starts to slide one leg off the couch, begins the process of getting out of Steve’s lap. “I’ll just–”
“Depends on your view,” He admits after scooping up a potato and tasting it. The starch has gone soft and the flavor of the broth seems to have soaked into it.
“Here lies Rhodey Rhodes Rhodebear.” Tony immediately recites, bowing his head in a mockery of prayer that Rhodey can only make out from the corner of his eye. “He was a terrible friend, I don’t miss him.” A nudging of a foot into Rhodey’s side punctuates the statement. When he only responds with a grunt, Tony adds. “At all.”
“Baby, I love when you get all caveman for me, but we got to do this right.” With a small and light voice, Tony moves to stand next to Rhodey and place a hand on the tight muscles of his shoulder. The man reels on him, but only to clutch at Tony’s shoulders in turn.
“Sounds like a blizzard.” Steve whispers into his hair some thousand years later and Tony feels languid as he pulls back to meet his eyes. They are red rimmed and the most beautiful thing in Tony’s entire life. It feels right that his arc reactor was blue, feels right that something like Steve’s eyes would have been the magnet keeping his heart safe.
“Been busy.” Stark admits, still looking at Steve in bemusement. He eventually shakes his head and takes a sniff of the mug before bringing it to his lips and taking a generous swallow. Captivated, Steve watches his throat work through it and feels his own go completely dry.
“Sounds like it.”
“Close it.” They can’t take any more chances, this has to end now and Steve feels horrible gut wrenching anguish as the ache in his chest abates. He cannot look away as the window collapses in around itself, stealing away something Steve feels only ever belong to him.
"Sorry, sorry. Go back to sleep.” He waves and continues on to his original target, resolutely ignoring the decidedly not adorable grumbling and squirming of the sleep mussed super soldier behind him. “I'm just your friendly neighborhood sleep deprived billionaire. Nothing to worry about."
Bruce encourages him to keep a log of everything he notices, but doesn’t seemed too worried about it, telling Steve even with the serum the human brain does weird things. Still, he takes several blood samples and runs some memory tests on him before letting him go back to his floor.
Beside that though, there is an uneasiness in the line of his shoulders, a hesitance in his breathing. Tony pulls his legs a bit more together, adjusts so he is no longer sitting flat on Steve’s erection. Unfortunately, the movement is anything but graceful and Tony hisses when his own dick bumps into the side of Steve’s hip.
It jostles them both, slides the soft skin of Steve’s still overwarm cock against Tony’s upper thigh. Something about that, about Steve’s now mostly flaccid dick rubbing along his skin is more intensely intimate than anything they’ve done so far. Tony shivers, gets is brain so fully caught on the idea that Steve makes it all the way up on his elbows before Tony notices the fresh air on his lower stomach.
A plush white rug spans most of the otherwise marble floor and Steve can make out a purple paint stain on one corner. He follows the corner up to see a collapsed dark wood easel and can’t help but stare at it. It is something he nearly bought himself a few months back and he can’t help but shoot Tony a wide eyed look. He never would have took Tony for an artist, but maybe he uses it as a drafting surface for his blueprints. For his part, Tony refuses to make eye contact and Steve just steps further into the room.
“Screw you too, Capslock.” He meant to infuse a bit more sarcasm, but it comes out just a few notches under fond. He wants to panic about that, wants to reel it in, but Rogers seems so fucking pleased by it he can’t gather the energy.
“You’ve been, you’re…” Steve hears someone say, too focused on pulling the chest plate off to realize the voice is his own. When it falls off, Tony heaves in greatful breaths, holding his non-gauntleted hand against his chest. Steve presses his own over it, feels a need to weave their fingers together, but instead pulls it off to feel at the ribs himself. Tony hisses at the pressure, but Steve can tell they are just bruised, no cracks or breaks. It should be a relief, but Steve feels fractured. He has done this for Tony so many times, he knows the exact span of each rib, he sees the arc reactor embedded in his chest and can’t muster any surprise.
“JARVIS, would you let Iron Man know I’m going down to the gym if he would like to spar when he’s done with Mr. Stark?” His report saved, he tucks his tablet under his arm and makes his way to the elevator. He is still in athletic clothes, so he will only need to drop off on his floor to deposit his Starkpad and maybe grab his large water bottle. He makes it into his kitchen before realizing JARVIS never answered his request. “JARVIS, will Iron Man be able to stop by?”
“There,” His voice is soft and the breath is softer, fanning over the side of Tony’s face. If he shifted his weight and looked up just a bit they would be nose to nose, or more accurately nose to neck. “I’m sure you can get the rest, yeah?”
Yinsen finishes shaving, before pulling the mirror off and walking over to him. Tony sits up and takes it but doesn’t bother really looking at it. Yinsen doesn't seem to notice his lack of curiosity and simply walks over to the fire and stirs around in the pan, whistling. Tony doesn’t prompt him, but the conversation still starts in almost the same way. Another point for the echo hypothesis.
“Just, please. We can go back to the couch.” Tony whispers into his ear, can’t help but test the give of the lobe between his teeth. The cropped hairs of Steve’s side burn rub into his face and that may just be the only sensation he ever needs to feel from now until the end of time. He runs his nose up the length of it, leans up on the tips of his toes and into the solidity of Steve’s shoulders to get a good graze at his cheek bone. Without thinking he presses a lingering kiss right at the crest of it and feels his whole chest bursting at the tenderness. The skin of it is warm against his mouth and, oh Steve’s blush, he could spend thirty lifetimes just thinking about it.
There is a pause after he proclaims his demand, Pepper is a little red in the face and her hand is clamped over her mouth. Before he can do more than narrow his eyes at what is clearly her amusement at his turmoil, Jarvis speaks up.
“What?” Stark pulls back and looks at him like he suddenly sprouted a second head. “Are you having a stroke!” He demands and starts to shake his head like Steve’s suggestion is the most ridiculous thing ever spoken. “Cap, all you do is talk. You are practically a walking speech writer.”
“Damn fool,” Tony yells into the void of the snow filled valley. Nothing, absolutely nothing for the last thirty minutes and they are closing in on the final five acres. “Rogers, you fucking shit head, get up and answer me!” He demands, flicking the outer speaker to full volume because even if Steve is dead he needs to hear this.
Rhodey moves to step away after walking him most of the way towards a waiting Pepper and Happy, but Tony grabs tight to the man’s sleeve. Feeling like a scared four year old he pleads silently when Rhodey looks at him before sighing with a pinched smile and a nod. Maybe he is a coward, but he can’t face his not really ex-girlfriend alone. Plus, if Rhodey leaves he won’t be able to punch Obadiah in the face when the jackass tries to hug Tony.
“Good to see you too, Boss.” Happy replies, the smile now spilling out from his eyes into a full blown grin.
“Stark?” His voice cracks at the end and he can feel his breathing speed up. He knows this is new information, he knows for a fact he never even suspected Iron Man could have been this man. Yet, this is not the first time Steve has seen his face under a cracked face plate, it is not the first time he thought of them as one in the same.
“I found this box in my sock drawer.” Comes out without thought and he wonders why he started there instead of the encounter with Anna.
“Yes, Captain. It is your prefered blend.” JARVIS responds smoothly and Steve can make out the smell of it from the archway between the kitchen and living room. It seems JARVIS picked up on some silent queue from Steve’s body, because the coffee smells like the best idea ever.
“Wait, Shellhead.” Steve calls, eyes locked unseeing on the metalic doors.
The question pulls him back a little and he turns to look at the far wall with a sigh. A good few minutes may help his anxiety, but the underlying issue is still there. Something is off with him and it may be nothing more than some strange bout of forgetfulness, but it is still worrying. It could be a sign of the serum failing in some way. He shakes that thought off and turns back to Iron Man.
“He betrayed you! He did this-” Rhodey gestures at his chest before just collapsing against Tony again. This time Tony holds him up. That is always what they do; hold each other in turns.
Only the widening of the armored man’s eyes and the pick up of his heart beat clues Steve in that this moment is somehow occurring to both of them. He feels tense, perched on some ledge while simultaneously free falling through open air. He feels full to bursting, overflowing with something complex and simple and consuming. Stark’s back is tightening, his fingers flex and relax, his throat clenches tightly around a shaky swallow and Steve can feel every single intricate movement as if he is suddenly a part of a new whole, a piece of a two body unit.
“Where are we going?” Tony asks with a laugh, letting himself settle into Steve’s side. They fit so smoothly, latching together like pieces of his armor, designed precisely to walk like this. It hurts somewhere deep and broken, but Tony can’t help but think it every time they press together; can’t help but remember how perfectly whole he felt with Steve inside him.
“Awesome.” He replies and reaches out to down it. She stops him with a light hand on his forearm. With mock sternness she pauses him with a finger.
“Alright,” Tony says on a laugh, but they stay laying like that for a long while.
With painstaking effort Steve lifts his still frozen hand, rests it on the side of Tony’s neck and the armor feels like a cruel barrier. Tony sobs.
“Off, off.” Tony is saying, pawing at the sides of Steve’s jeans, yanking haphazardly while pushing up into the heat of him with his hips. “I need to touch you, please.”
He lets that shake, lets the conformation of his still secure secret reassure him and pulls his hands into his lap. They spend some time chatting aimlessly, both weary from Tony’s punishing pace. Yinsen keeps up well with the spontaneous jumps from welding to coding to relaxing that Tony makes multiple times a day, sometimes to the point where Tony assumes he knows exactly the deliberacy of each. As much as Tony would love to work through day and night until he nestless himself safely inside the preliminary Iron Man, an appearance must be upheld. If he works too hard and swiftly no amount of convenient pivoting and shadows would prevent the ten rings from noticing. Which could change things enough to make Tony and Yinsen’s escape just as rushed as last time. Just as bloody.
He finishes scrubbing his hands clean and runs some of the water through his hair to make it fall a little neater on his head. It sticks up a bit too much in the front, but he can’t bring himself to care.
Then Stark is holding a nuke over his body and flying headlong into the portal that Romanov begins to shut.
Yinsen is as much an inspiration as Tony always remembered and that is such a bone deep comfort he finds himself holding back tears some nights at just how much he came to fail this man. At how much Yinsen would actually believe Tony had tried his very best. The problem of Yinsen is one he spends many hours considering, more than he thinks a decent person ever would. Because, see, Yinsen wanted his death, wanted to martyr himself for his lost family and hope in Tony. Even though Tony knows Yinsen’s hope is horribly misplaced with the certainty  he predicted all those years ago, it seems almost cruel to take that choice from the man.
“All of it.” Steve replies and catches Tony when he crumbles. His whole body collapses into Steve and he is gasping in deep breaths as he clutches Steve’s shirt in both hands. He presses in as close as they can, winds his legs around Steve’s waist and presses his face into Steve’s shoulder. Steve just holds him, grasps on just as tightly. How could he ever forget this?
“What on earth are you doing?” JARVIS had already lowered the volume on his music so she says the words in a calm voice. She almost wants to smile, but holds it back with a raised eyebrow instead.
Tony actually comes to his floor to pick him up. Steve hears the elevator doors ping, hears him pace a few times in the foyer and tries to keep his grin under control when it takes the man a full forty seconds to knock. For a moment he considers waiting, considers making it seem like he hasn’t been sitting and staring at his watch for the past ten minutes in anticipation. Unfortunately, his body makes the decision for him and he is swinging open the door before Tony can even consider knocking again.
“Stark?” Yet, his voice and emotions are pure shock and confusion. It quickly relaxes into some kind of understanding, which Tony quickly resents. Of course Perfect Little Soldier would have read the files from beginning to end, probably thought Tony was a complete idiot for giving him his phone number. “How did you know–”
“Oh, really?” Tony is wide eyed, face bright and so hopeful Steve can’t help but beam back at him. This only brings more light to the genius’ face and he laughs before adding, “awesome. I was thinking we could go to this little Italian place a few blocks down.”
He turns around and sees a figure making its way in through the shattered window. “I can’t believe you didn’t tell me.” He whispers, not really needing Tony to hear it because he knows the intensity of his disbelief cannot be understood. He needs to see Bruce, needs him to look at his blood and say there is something wrong, tell him what on earth is going on.
It felt so wonderfully normal, so completely like it should. The memories of this were solid, for all some of them had the hazy outline of Tony instead of the armor. They always did this, even in Steve’s fake memories. Iron Man or Tony, Steve always ended up laughing with him.
A swallow and then Stark rocks forward as he lets out his breath. “Woah! Shit!”
Tony is sat up, picking at the hem of his silk cream comforter. The room is expansive, but not empty. There are two massive pale wood dressers along one wall. Both have a set of glass catchall plates, the red one contains a silver watch, the money clip Steve usually sees Tony pull out and a handful of loose change. The other one is blue and empty. There are a few framed photos of the team on that dresser, but the one with red only has a photo of Tony and Rhodey looking shockingly young and a frame that lays face down.
“You are relentless.” Yinsen notes, eyes concerned but smile kind and maybe a bit impressed.
,Tony thinks with years of self
“Alright, Stark, that’s it. Come on.” A heavy, but blissfully warm arm drapes itself over Tony’s shoulders and starts to direct him away from the bar.
“Fine, what are you doing?” It sounds nothing like a pleasantry, coming out not unlike the commands the Captain issued during their battle. Tony actually laughs aloud at it.
Then he sees the little purple bruises under her eyes, just starting to come into focus as her makeup fades. He sees the wrinkles in her suit coat from wearing it across town and through about ten different meetings. He sees the way her shoulders are hunched up, how she is still worrying the inside of her right wrist where she sometimes wears a brace when no one can see it. And he remembers, remembers how she trembled whenever the news ran reels of the Chitauri. Remembers how bright red her eyes were when he waltzed in after the latest battle. Putting this on her is unfair. He already puts everything on her, every one of his bad decisions and dumb emotional problems all fall at Pepper’s feet. This is between him and the Captain.
“You mean it is nothing but corn for 200 years.” Tony answers, thumping the pen against his bottom lip. Rogers actually snorts a little at that and the way it fills both himself and Tony with a bright warm wash is nothing short of intoxicating. Tony doesn’t even notice Pepper step out of the room.
Fury tries to back track, but Stark jumps right in with his screen of information and fighting a common goal, however small, feels so amazing. Steve’s skin is almost singing with it just as his entire body fills with gallons of weary disappointment. “I was wrong, Director. The world hasn’t changed a bit.”
He doesn’t tell either of them about the ring, even though he looks at it every morning.
They are both silent for a stretch, aside from Tony slurping at his bowl of wine. When Rhodey finally manages to roll onto his side and look at his best friend full on he grins and says, “Fuck you, butthead.”
“No.” His smile doesn’t even falter and she hates it. She wishes they could go back to ten minutes ago, both holding back smiles. She wishes they could skip ahead and be done with this entire conversation.
When the feel of someone's hands in his chest pulls him back into reality, it takes a second for him to think anything past ‘ow ow ow, what the fuck, ow’. Then he actually feels mostly confused. This dream is so old it feels almost new, sharp in a way most nights haven’t been in years. As soon as that thought buzzes through, he realizes this is his first lucid dream in two years. Maybe that’s why he can feel it all so acutely. Feel the scratch of his throat as screams rip out of him without permission, the jolts of metal on inner tissue and numbness laced in needles so deep they pummel right through him.
“I’m sorry. It was just easier this way.” Tony is telling him, but Steve honestly cannot figure out what he is talking about. Who did he buy those gloves from Anna’s shop for? Why does he have reading glasses in his night stand drawer?
“No of course not.” He insists, but can’t help the breathy laughs escaping him when Iron Man throws up is hands in mock surrender.
“I don’t remember it being that easy.” Steve replies with a shrug, keeping his body lose in hopes of forcing away the anxiety coiling tighter in his belly. Stark’s gaze feels like a brand. “This guy packs a wallop.”
Pepper watches the exchange, clearly aware there is some story she is missing but does not comment when Rhodey deflates and steps away from the car. “I don’t like your plan, I told you eight times on the way here how much I hate the plan. You pulled this just so I would have to go deal with all the shit it is going to cause, didn’t you?”
“Oh fuck.” Steve groans into his mouth and his thrusts grow more frantic, more using Tony’s hand than allowing for any real finesse. Which honestly is just as well because he can’t think past the feel of Steve’s lips and hand and bulk pressing more and more into him. He is so surrounded and held and it is getting to be too much.
Steve nods and then Tony is kissing him. His lips are salty and wet, but Steve could drown in them for all he cares. They kiss and kiss, mouths pressed hard enough to bruise, teeth and tongues and more passion than Steve can ever remember. He wants to fuse them together, wants to burrow himself into Tony’s skin and never leave. He went without this, he lost this and if Tony hadn’t tried so hard they may never have gotten it back.
“Tony?” Steve calls, crossing the living space and making his way into a wide hallway with four doors. One is cracked open and he can make out the rustle of blankets and clacking metal on wood. He considers turning to run again, because what can he even say at this point? He is still angry, but more than anything he just feels hopelessly confused. He wants to see Tony, he wants Tony to make it alright, he just wants to be in the same room as him. There is the sound of drawers slamming closed and then more intense rustling before it all stops.
Sometimes when they are like this, smiling and happy, she wonders what it would feel like to run her fingers through his hair and pull his face close. What it would feel like to bite down on his lip even while he continues to smile so radiantly at her. Wonders if maybe they could love each other, could make each other better.
“Surprise?” Tony asks with a chuckle, then grunts and hunches forward into a coughing fit. Without thinking, Steve anchors him and starts running his hands down the side of the chest plate. There are catches there, exactly where he knew they would be and it feels like the ring all over again. His fingers know exactly how to press them. Tony never even told him these catches existed.
“Well, I mean.” Tony begins, but all the wind is falling out of his sails. He shakes his head and bites his lip hard enough for the skin to go white under his teeth. “Listen, I’m not saying it would be forever, but I get that you won’t be able to trust me for a while.”
“Hey, Steve?” Tony says, licking at his bottom lip before turning his eyes away and rubbing an oil stained hand up against the grain of his scalp. It makes Steve long to do the same, but he presses his hands into the spine of his sketchbook instead.
“I’m not doing anything important.” He says to save the poor kid from his useless attempts at sentences, still huffing out breathy half laughs all the same. “Just doing my yearly quota of work for the senior center. Calling them up, making sure they aren’t lonely, that sort of thing.”
Rhodey only sees the scales once at MIT and promptly writes them off as the effects of alcohol and being best friends with Tony Stark. They are in their shared apartment, the one Tony bought for them as a way of telling Rhodey he planned to continue bumming it at MIT for his EE doctorate. They are both more than a little bit sheets-to-the-wind and Rhodey cannot honestly recall if the drinking was started by a celebration or a break up. Either way, the wine tastes like smooth honey and Tony is laughing hard enough to knock both of them against the wall in a haphazard repetition. The linoleum is peeling where they sit against the wall in their tiny not-really-a-kitchen kitchenette, next to a hot plate and a bowl filled with about twelve truly terrible tasting pancakes. They’d long gone cold and Rhodey does not mind at all when Tony’s flailing left foot knocks a few out and onto the yellowing floor.
It feels too impossibly good, so heady and frantic, and Tony feels himself go lax, feels himself give into the strength of Steve’s grasp. The rumbling growl Steve lets out when he feels Tony give beneath him sends shuddering waves of pleasure straight down from their lips to the tip of Tony’s cock. Breaking for air becomes a necessity and Tony pulls back with the absolute most lewd sounding pop.
He knew objectively that Steve liked him, that Steve must like kissing him and cuddling and holding hands. They did all those things so often that Tony at least knew Steve liked him enough to indulge the excessive amount of each that Tony demanded. He always seemed to enjoy it even, seemed to get just as into their make out sessions. Still, it feels like the idea is just now hitting Tony. Steve wants him, wants him enough to be kneading his fingers into the back of Tony’s head, to be looking at Tony with so much hunger it steals all the air from the world.
“What?” Steve manages, but he feels shaken by the half memory and lets the armor slip past his fingers. Iron Man is across the room now and Steve can only stare as he stumbles and slams a hand into the elevator pad.
Steve is panting next to him, but his hand is wound in with Tony’s and the solid weight of it is so calming Tony could melt into the bed. He wants to stay like this for hours, wants to keep Steve’s hand in his even after they get dressed, wants to asks Steve to stay until morning this time.
“Yinsen, he, t-they shot him.” Tony manages between clinging to the straps of Rhodey’s pack and stumbling in the sand. “He helped me, we have to-”
“You’re gonna rot your gut straight through one of these days, Stark.” Steve calls from the entryway and it’s like a string is pulled taught in Tony’s forehead with how quickly he snaps up his gaze. He tries to save face by hiding his surprise in a long swallow of his scotch, but by the furrow in Steve’s brow it seems waisted.
"Yeah." Steve answers immediately, voice muffled in Tony’s hair. If he minds the oil and sweat he does not comment.
All he can do is be thankful. Rhodey will be there and so will Tony, a week early. Maybe that will spare his dearest friend some of that pain. If only the loop started sooner, he could have spared him it all.
It takes a second, but Steve realizes he is laughing, giggling more like, at the thought. He looks up at himself in the mirror and for a second he can’t recognize the face. It’s the youngest he’s looked in years, smile bright and cheeks flushed pink with the excitement. It makes him laugh harder and he can’t actually understand how happy he feels.
Something too kind to be pity flashes in Steve’s eyes, but Tony can’t place it before it’s gone. Instead he smiles, brushes Tony’s fingers away and slides his own hand over the catches. His breath is warm on the side of Tony’s face, his chest solid where it presses slightly into Tony’s shoulder. The proximity ignites that pool of heat low in Tony’s belly that seems to always simmer in silence, waiting for Steve to set it off.
“I’m kidding.” Rogers admits, smile finally breaking through his voice. A pause and Tony feels the little bead of concern before hearing it. “Though, it’s late there isn’t it.” Ah, must have checked the clock. The comment would normally have Tony rolling his eyes, but the man is nothing less than genuine. Something about it warms the genius to his toes.
Steve’s smile is lighter now, but the warmth radiates all over Tony and he just basks. He feels like a lazy house cat, delighting in the sheer sunlight that is Steve Rogers’ happiness. He runs his fingers up Steve’s arms, over those broad shoulders to rest on either side of his neck. In return, Steve settles both of his hands on either side of Tony’s waist, clutches into the fabric of his T-shirt.
“Stark, we need a plan of attack.” Steve shouts after him, feeling some strange lurching under his ribs as the suit stalks farther and farther away. There is a rope tethered between them, stretching impossibly as the gap grows. The panic from before is pooling back in and he has to press against it harder now to keep focused on the mission.
In the morning Tony’s hand isn’t even a little bit pink and Rhodey is hungover enough to write it all off as a really weird dream. The hot plate is off by the time he stumbles into the kitchen to begin picking up from their rather pathetic two man party the night before. Tony bitches the entire time about just buying them a better place, or moving them both out to California where they could have gone to a bar instead of holing up inside to avoid the mountains of snow (aka the two inches they got yesterday afternoon). Rhodey only smiles at him and smacks him upside the head for thinking he is too good for their shabby little home.
“I was thinking about getting a cup of coffee.” Tony tells him and manages to squirm around to face Steve. He giggles at the grumpy little pout on Steve’s face.
“If he makes you feel threatened in any way-”
Steve looks away again, rubs a hand down over his face. “The whole team moved back in at your insistence and you’re down here ignoring all of us.”
The storm is getting worse every minute and the little feathered thing in Tony’s chest is dying with every empty patch of land he scans.
Tony jolts a little when he nearly slams his nose into Steve’s neck, but instead of backing up he just lifts his eyes to meet Steve’s.
“Cap,” Tony starts, but Steve nearly jerks at the nickname, turning away from Tony like it physically burned him. They both know he is done with having Tony like that, both know there wasn’t an offer to accept or deny. “Aw, hell, don’t be like that, Steve.”
Enough time passes in the relentless push and pull of sliding sand beneath his feet that Tony begins to wonder if he somehow calculated the days all wrong. If somehow his changed actions prevented the appearance of that oil drum and no chopper would be out over this patch before the heat and blood loss killed Yinsen. Tony had stopped a few times in his march to adjust the now unconscious man in an excuse to check his heartbeat and breath. In those times he’d removed both of their shirts to use as face shades and tied the leather around his chest above only his tank top. The papers had been moved to press just above the arc reactor and now both his secrets were completely covered by the material.
Anyways, he is walking mostly in the dark behind the couch when he sees it. Steve, or more accurately a vaguely blonde plume of hair that suggests the existence of Steve, under what might actually be 9 blankets. It makes him pause in the pursuit of sleepy time ambrosia, because last time he checked the month was August and no amount of stellar air conditioning really mitigated the sticky humidity of New York summers. Still, here Steve is, on the communal floor absolutely cocooned in likely every single throw blanket at his disposal. For a brief hysterical moment Tony considers that maybe he managed a 3 month instead of day no-sleep-excursion, but the likelihood of him still being alive after such a thing really disqualifies that explanation.
“It was– I don’t know if it really happened.” Stark starts, spinning in his stool. His movements are fluid and nothing but the slight lilt to his words signal to his inebriation. Back to her and face staring unfocused out the ceiling to floor window, he swallows hard and continues. “But, back in that cave.” Another pause, her body tensing tight and mind ratcheting to memorize every single word. He’s never spoken to her about anything prior to the Iron Man announcement, just silently acknowledge that she knew all about it and moved on. She probably knew far more than Stark could ever imagine, but hearing about it straight from the horse's mouth had no equal substitution. SHEILD still had a long list of unanswered questions about the entire event and his survival of the fiery explosion was only the start of it all.
The breaks between kisses grow longer, the time Steve takes to pull Tony’s bottom lip between his teeth and just hold it there stretches and stretches. They stay apart long enough that Steve’s lips start running along Tony’s jaw instead, start mapping their way towards his neck. Tony’s fingers scramble to get a hold in his hair and press him closer, direct him to the spot that makes his toes curl.
Tony seems both pleased and disappointed, so she cradles the little hands in one of her own and pulls them up to her lips. With quick little bursts, she covers both in tiny smacking pecks until the little body squirms and giggles in an attempt to break away. Only then does she pull back and sweep at the dangling hair over his perfect tiny forehead. “All better, yes?”
They’ve only managed to see each other a handful of times since the rebuked training session. It certainly isn’t unusual to go a few weeks with only a few shared moments, but something about the lack of him is only adding to Steve’s worry. Even when they managed to catch each other, Iron Man is stiff and strangely on edge throughout. He hesitates before speaking and lets Steve lead their talks more than he ever used to. It is starting to fray at Steve’s edges and he needs to sort all this out if only to get his goofball of a best friend back.
“I couldn’t get it to move and they were shooting everything and Yinsen was–” He cuts off and swallows again, turning his body just enough to nudge the empty glass back towards her. As he continues, she mixes the shot again. “It didn’t fix itself and I just, I opened my mouth. I don’t know if I was going to scream, or cry or…” The shot is set back by his elbow and he twists without acknowledging her. “And then there was fire all around me, all in the suit and pouring out of every hole and it felt. It felt so nice.”
“Oh it does, a whole ton actually.” He replies casually as he turns away from DUM-E and back to look at her, hose still pouring water all over his shoulder. A dark wet line trails all the way down his jeans to the puddle forming on the floor. She looks at him incredulously, because this tone is entirely too calm for what just occurred. He was on fire, actually on fire, and somehow this seems like the least exciting thing to happen to him in years. Then she looks back at his shoulder and notices how the skin now only seems a bit pink under the water. Apparently her shock somehow exaggerated the color earlier. There is only the faint hint of yellow lines and those only seem like stretch marks on his olive skin.
Yinsen looks a little shocked at his summary, but smiles and tells Tony how they met once in Berlin, about a lecture and a drunk asshole. Tony smiles, but is cut off by the hammering at the door and feels his stomachh drop at the noise. He remembers this part too well. Knows what’s coming, wants anything else.
They stay like that, wrapped around each other, desperately trying not to sob and Tony finally understands. He finally understands why that fluttering would never die, why the tether would never break. Everytime, Steve was there on the other end, longing just as deeply for all his silence. Tony feels a fresh wave bubble up in him and Steve shushes him, loosening his hold only to rub his hand up and down Tony’s back. It’s such a simple gesture, but Tony feels so cherished, so protected, so loved.
“I don’t feel so...,” He manages to breathe out just before closing his eyes for the night.
Steve looks at him, some sadness pulling down on his face the longer he examines Tony’s offer. Before the tension builds to a point where Tony will have no choice but to chug the entire thing just to fill the silence, Steve stands up from the bar. In one smooth movement he takes the glass, sets it back behind him and pulls Tony to standing.
It takes a few measured breaths, but he calms and pulls up the map of the area in his HUD. “Okay. If Steve had made it to one of these buildings in the past two days, he’d of gotten a message to Wilson by now.”
“Rhodey.” Tony tries, but the gratitude is breaking his voice somewhere towards the end. The other man’s smile comes right along with it.
“He called it ‘The Dragon’.” She tells him, smirking genuinely as he rubs at his ears. She remembers how this particular shot makes it feel like steam is pouring out of them.
“Schedules are always better when you are ahead of them.” Tony shrugs and lets his arms fall apart and rest limply at his sides. Smiling just a little brighter, Yinsen stands to retrieve their canister of water.
“I’m just–” Tony starts when Steve is silent for too long, but the noise pulls him into action. In two short steps he is hovering over him. In one quick movement he has Tony’s face cupped in both his hands. He brings them in close, makes their eyes focus and let’s his frustration scrunch up his face. Eyes wide, Tony just stares and remains silent as Steve takes a moment to gather his thoughts.
“Sure.” She tells him and his smile softens, before it catches on a thought she can’t see and the moment is broken. The cloud is back and that secret suddenly bursts into view just behind his back and she remembers why she can’t just walk over to him and kiss him for hours and hours.
She deflates a little, pouting with–
By the way there, Mr. Tin Man
“All right.”A choked off gasp and the sound of a tube opening. A delighted laugh and Tony sighs deep and content. “All right. I’ll stay.”
She says it lightly, with a perfectly open and friendly smile. Yet, he shutters suddenly and looks away. The air grows heavy and thick and her hackles raise just as quickly as the investigator in her pushes insistently forward. There is something very important here.
“I don’t know!” Tony yelps back, looking a bit fuzzy all over. It makes Rhodey’s stomach lurch sideways.
The man is laughing maniacally, spouting nonsense about his loyal slugs. Steve is too busy avoiding the largest ones and trying to assist Thor and Iron Man to really pay it much mind. It takes some time, and the largest monsters are certainly getting in a good amount of building destruction as the team struggles to cut them through before they heal. The road is filling with a pungent tan slime for each eliminated slug, and moving is getting a little difficult. Still, they keep pushing forward and soon there are only two slugs left.
“Tony, you are not leaving the team.” Steve insists, clenching both hands before releasing them. He runs them over his own face and looks around the room for some sort of directions. His anger feels like some far away thing, just the puff of smoke left after pouring water on hot coals. They’re gonna fight about this at some point, hell he and Tony can fight about the likelihood of rain most days, they are certainly going to fight about this at some point. Now, though, now all Steve can see is the defiance in Tony’s eyes, the wall going up to protect himself from Steve’s rejection.
“Found the serum,” Steve starts, coughing when his voice catches in his dry and wind bruised throat. Tony turns to the sink a few feet from the stove and tests the fauset. After a small lag the water trickles out and he pulls open the cabinet above it and pulls out one of the four mugs nestled there. He fills it and carries it over to Steve without a word. Their fingers brush in the exchange and Tony wants nothing more than to latch onto those too cold fingers. He forces himself still and sits on the foot of the bed.
The reactor is similar to his first, but there is a smoothness to it, the connection against skin more precise, waterproof casing more secure. The coils and circuitry are finer, he knows no wires will get caught when he takes it out himself, that he won’t have to ask Pepper to assist him. Tony is incapable of making any of the same mistakes twice, at least where his machhines are concerned. Otherwise, well, they stop being mistakes after the fifth or sixth time, so maybe it still counts.
“Yinsen.” Tony says again to Rhodey, clutching tighter and trying to convey just how important that unconscious man is to him. Rhodey hefts them both up into the chopper and straps Tony into one of the chairs.
By the time he makes it back to the Tower, his panicking has subsided. He’s managed to convince himself the thing with Anna is just a weird case of Deja Vu and his tendency to remember faces over places. Even if she is actually a symptom of some larger plot involving unknown socks and missing blankets, hyperventilating about it will help absolutely nothing.
Of course there is the pile of lifeless steel poking out from the sand like icebergs from a dry sea, but that is not what catches Tony’s breath. A few feet away and to the right is a sprawled body in tattered dress pants and an offcentered welders mask.
Instead he smiles, genuine because Pepper deserves that, and says, “Your eyes are red.” But it’s not the same as last time, he isn’t teasing her. He is awed. Struck dumb, because there in the watery blue he sees all that same love. So long before they really started their dance and somehow she is looking at him with that patient tenderness he will find the breaking point for time and time again. It’s a younger, softer love than what he lost months ago and it knocks him sideways. “Tears for your long-lost boss?”
most of them for the goodbye at all.
“You think you’re a regular renegade hero, but look at you; world’s falling to shit, and the dumbass you haven’t spoken to in months is fishing you out of the snow by your ankles,” Steve smiles at him and lets his eyes close. Tony shakes him, but they don’t open. “Stay with me, Rogers. Look alive.” He begs shutting the face plate again to check his vitals. They are better now, good enough for Tony to scoop him up bridal style. When he looks down before taking off, Steve is smiling, small and soft and perfect.
When they finish and Maria Hill herself tells Steve to get his ass back to the tower, however, the thoughts are too numerous to count. He wants to go find Tony and make sure he is alright. He wants to find Natasha, demand she tell him how long she knew and to list every person privy to the knowledge. He wants to scream because as close as he and Iron Man were, the intensity of his anger makes no sense.
“Mama!” Tony’s eyes are wide as her nails dig into the sides of his little arms to drag him fully away from the fireplace. She feels the tears rush up in her eyes, but cannot stop them as she continues to plea to any deity that will listen.
“Forget this, Cucciolo! You can never touch the fire, it will kill you.” Her voice is breaking against each word in wet shards of panic. Tony’s eyes are puffy red and widen as she continues. “It will kill you bambino!” His trembling is so fierce now, or perhaps that is her own arms convulsing where they hold his. “Never ever ever. Please forget this!”
“One more?” He asks, tilting his chin up and parting his lips because he knows how to play these games. Knows how to get Steve chuckling and leaning back down.
It is early, but not enough for him to consider another bout of sleep. He feels decently rested and decides the sun has the right idea about rising. Another roll has him sitting up with his feet firmly on the floor. He stretches, cracks his neck and takes a second to look over the room. It feels uncomfortably quiet, so he calls out for JARVIS to start his newest playlist on low.
“I just wanna kiss you.” Tony admits. It’s true, it’s all he wants to do. He wakes up wanting to find Steve and kiss him. He sits next to Steve at those stupid movie theaters and just wants to kiss his cheek, kiss his knuckles and his shoulder. He is so full of something, something both calm and desperate, and the only way to get it out is to kiss Steve.
like Tony hasn’t been with several close seconds. He’s bumped his uglies with a rather wide array of lovely bodies and for all they have a nice place in his spank bank memory, he never wanted to just kiss them goodbye for twenty minutes straight. He never wanted to actually
“God, Tony. What-”
They breathe, just lay there and breathe for a long stretch of liquid time. They sync up, in and out together as their heartbeats slow and the burning heat of the room starts to dissipate. Some external force moves Tony’s free arm, gets it wrapped around Steve’s back enough to rub down the length of it. It guides Tony’s head to tilt right and get his lips against Steve’s temple. He takes a deep inhale of the sent there, lets the sweat rub into his lips and savors every bit of it.
T-minus 5 and Tony has to at least say something, something for the ‘just in case’ and ‘what ifs’ the dramatically altered situation of his escape forces to mind.
“Iron Man.” He looks at the face plate, knows his face must seem somber when the gauntlet slips off his shoulder and into Iron Man’s lap.
“We could, we definitely could.” In what world can Steve think Tony would say anything else? He’s been completely incapable of not plastering himself to Steve since that first kiss. Tony’s been held back on nothing but duct tape and sheer force of will. It takes Steve hours to leave sometimes because Tony just won’t stop kissing him and Steve honestly thinks for even a second that Tony wouldn’t be jumping at the chance to do literally anything with him? Tony goes to football games, volunteers at soup kitchens, and fucking watches shitty black and white movies for him. Tony will literally do anything in the world if it means Steve will just kiss him. “I am all about doing something, never much one for doing nothing, I–”
After being awarded the medal for bravery by an unenthusiastic Stern, Rhodey had taken a personal leave to stay with Tony for two weeks. Those two weeks were always carried in a special place in Tony’s heart, the brief retreat to earlier days had smoothed away their shared guilt and anger. But in this strange repeat, the reaffirmed friendship is far from the best thing that weekend gave him.
“I will call upon my knight in shining armor without hesitation. Stop fretting mom, I know how to play this alright?” Scooting further into the car he motions for Pepper to join him. Happy watches through the rearview mirror with similar concern.
It’s too soon to feel so sure about something, they haven’t even kissed each other. For all Steve knows there might be nothing there for them to share. Maybe they’ll kiss and it’ll feel awkward and uncomfortable, maybe Tony didn’t even mean for this to be a date. It should make him sweat, should make him want to pace and question if he should cancel. Instead he is grinning at himself like a fool and knowing with absolute certainty that kissing Tony will be the single best thing in the world.
Steve wishes he’d followed right after him, wants to reach through the screen and comfort the Tony there. Even with the man cuddling into his chest as he watches, it feel like not enough. He pulls Tony closer into him even so.
They’ve kissed before, they’ve kissed so many times Steve’s done it in his sleep. They’ve gone to Il Ghiottone’s so often the waitress stopped begging him to try anything new. Steve’s room feels too quiet because he hadn’t slept there in weeks, had started keeping his straight razor in Tony’s bathroom over a year ago. That turned over photo is of them on their first vacation together, a selfie taken by Steve of the two of them tangled together in a hammock. It is blurry and Tony’s shirt is stained with BBQ sauce, but it’s been sitting there since last june. That blanket stopped being Steve’s the first time he left it with Tony before doing a week long OP for SHIELD. He paid for the ring on the first of september, picked it because it reminded him of the watch Tony gave him for their first anniversary.
Tony is becoming a bit of a problem in Steve’s life even without the unreal recollections. By problem, Steve of course means the best damn part of it, but the classification feels completely justified. They are spending more and more time together, more than they ever did when Tony was restricted to in his armor. Almost everyday Steve finds himself walking down to the workshop with a box of pizza or little white containers of chinese food. He spends hours down there, both sketching while Tony works and watching movies together on a tattered couch shoved in the far corner.
Steve ticks on the coffee maker and still there is no reaction from the other occupant of the room. Part of him wants to say something, wants to get the guy to look up and react to his existence somehow. The other, well the other part is fixated. He can’t look away, can’t be bothered to even remember why he came here in the first place.
“I’m not mad that you didn’t tell me. Well, I am, but that isn’t the point.” Steve starts, huffing out a breath but not dropping his hands, not even letting them twitch. There is no reason to lie, the truth will get his point across more anyways. “I told you knowing it wouldn’t change anything, Shellhead. I trust you.”
When Tony had initially outlined his proposed time table, Yinsen had tried and failed spectacularly to hide his incredulity. Which, of course was understandable, as not even Tony Stark would have been capable of the speed without deep long standing knowledge of seemingly non-existent technology. Even then, their luck with predicting their captors movements and observation angles was the main key of keeping everything on track. Yinsen’s amazement at that feat makes Tony squirm under the weight of all the lies this second life demands.
Steve nods at that and lets his hand drop with unreasonable reluctance before moving back over to the fridge. He pulls two glasses from the cabinet, filling one with water for Stark and another with the juice he came in for in the first place.
“This whole last week, I don’t know, I just have this gut feeling that something is wrong.” Again that feels too simple, doesn’t capture the way the whole world feels tilted like Steve is stuck staring through a fun house mirror.  “I wake up and my room is too quiet, I keep finding all these weird little things in my room. And I know they aren’t mine and I can’t remember how they got there, but they also feel like they belong somehow.”
“Do you still want to?” Tony asks him.
Although he knows the arc reactor so intimately he could probably build about 600 while hanging upside down and asleep, the resources are limited and he doesn’t have any of the tools of 2016. Plus, he is pretty sure synthesizing a new element would tip off the guards that he may not be building exactly what they are hoping. So, he melts down the palatium into a hand smoothed mold and resists the urge to flinch when he presses the device into his chest. Even though the poisoning is months and months away, he knows it is already starting. He clenches his fist tighter and reminds himself that every black line is really just dirt and oil, that he will get out of here again and already knows exactly how to save himself.
“Steve, tell me none of this smells a little funky to you?” And the whole lab is back in focus, startlingly bright and nothing but sharp edges. How long had he been completely zeroed in on Stark, absolutely unaware of his surroundings? It’s jarring, somehow shameful and Steve turns to the exit without looking back at Stark. He ignores the tearing through his chest and back as the tether screams for him to go back.
Steve’s lips are open before Tony even gets there and there is instantly tongue, wet and slick and sliding everywhere. His hips are grinding up and that just makes Tony’s entire body light up like the Fourth of July. It’s just like he thought it would be, just exactly like he wanted it. Steve is so strong, so fierce, driving Tony to press in closer and closer until they can no longer be considered two separate bodies. His own arms are flung so securely around Steve’s neck that he can squeeze his own elbows.
his let’s-get-over-Steve train for real one of these days.
The clean up takes hours and even though a handful of SHIELD agents tell him they really can handle it on their own, Steve stays through all of it. Natasha must take care of Iron Man, because no one but the other Avengers seem to know anything about the reveal and Steve does not see him in any of the med vehicles. It itches at the back of his head, but the horrid stench of the now blue tinted tan slime provides enough distraction to prevent more than that.
“Stark, you know that’s a one way trip.” Steve tells him, voice steady as ever, even as his entire body ratchets tight in panic. He can feel Stark’s body relax in awe at the portal, can feel him tense in fear as he slips past the border. He knows when Stark stops breathing. When his heart stops beating. When the tether loosens.
“What? Rock of Ages giving up so easily?” Steve knows he is smirking before turning to see it, knows the tautness of the fake beaming before making out the tense furrow of Starks left eyebrow. The reference makes no sense, but the way Stark glances at the prisoner gives Steve enough context to make due.
Steve’s kisses have made it down to Tony’s collar bone and he always knew that as a sensitive spot, but god the way Steve drags his tongue along the line of it is nothing short of a revelation. The rolling of his hips speeds up, muscles contracting of their own accord. They are pressed so tightly together, Tony’s cock feels trapped and he can only imagine how Steve is feeling in his beautifully tight jeans.
That also ignores the list of things he can not find anywhere. He is missing several pairs of underwear, a good dozen T-shirts and two pairs of jeans. His old straight blade razor is also nowhere to be found for three solid days, but reappears the morning of the fourth cleaned like it is brand new. Also, his favorite blanket seems to have evaporated in the wash, because even a thorough search of the common floors comes up empty. It, unlike the razor, stays missing even after he asks JARVIS to assist him.
Part of him wants to have Jarvis pull up all surveillance available, just so he could know what on earth the man is doing. It seems unfair to be bombarded with all the conflicting and overwhelming emotions without having any clue of the causes. During the battle, it had not been so bad. In fact, knowing the sudden spikes of fear and determination actually helped them maneuver together. When Rogers felt panicked, Tony could immediately sweep in to lend a hand. When he seemed to radiate sadisfaction, Tony could fly off to pummel new targets.
It seems simple enough at first, just a single guy in an outrageously bright blue pin-striped suit surrounded by a couple dozen slimy slug looking creatures. However, after the first few tentative hits, it becomes apparent that the creatures grow larger with each absorbed shock. Iron Man’s repulsors and Thor’s lightning cut through without causing swelling, but the masses quickly mold back together.
Yinsen’s mimicked reply still feels like giving up.
“The first group goes in Project 1, name Iron Man U2. Set them in a sub project titled mach 1 and take the next ten in for a mach 2.” He rattles off, settling down into the familiar comfort of the memory foam beneath him. “The next go in for Project Neutralize Stane along with all recordings on this.” He tosses the rectangle to DUM-E, who picks it up off the floor with his claw and carries it over to the center desk, where Jarvis will be able to scan in the contents. JARVIS lets out a hum of acceptance.
It takes Steve another two days to open up about it to anyone else. The same oddities keep happening and Iron Man has yet to stop by and see him since their last conversation. He’s taken to running a different path, unable to see Anna’s shop window without going inside and torturing himself with the horrible juxtaposition of knowing and not remembering.
“Sorry to cut your vacation short.” His walls draw up with a sniff and the straightening of his shoulders. “Meant to give you a full three months.”
Romanov tells him to sit it out, tells him he is out matched by these God's of legend. He does not hesitate, can think of little else than the need to follow the pull in his sternum. If this man is anything so powerful as the one God Steve knows, Stark needs all the help he can get.
“Why on earth would you leave the team?” He asks gently, keeping eye contact even when Tony tries to glance away.
"Oh." Again, like it is the only word Tony remembers. What on earth is his role here? He never even asks for help for his own unpleasant dreams, let alone helps someone else.
“Sorry, sorry. Didn’t mean to just…” Steve is saying, all blotchy red in the face again. It makes Tony blink back into the world and that just simply won’t do. He uses the new space to pull his sticky hand out from between them, takes just enough time to wipe it against his rucked up shirt, and then flings it over Steve’s back to join the other. With now two arms worth of leverage, he yanks Steve back down on top of him so they are flush chest to chest, noses scant inches apart.
“What is it, Shellhead?”
“We won.” And it feels like he is saying so much more than that.
“I have a test.” Steve replies and it sounds like a question, like he can’t even remember anymore. Tony can relate, he isn’t even sure what day of the week it is, couldn’t tell the time if his life depended on it. His lips are tingling and almost sore from all the attention. It’s a damn shame they can’t stay like this all the time. “Plus, your feet will get sore if we stand here all night.”
Steve shuffles back and lifts the edge of the three wool blankets up enough for Tony to slide in under them. The bed is larger than a normal twin, but Steve is huge and leaves little space for Tony to fill. After a moment of shuffling, the end up pressed chest to chest, face to face with Steve’s arms wrapped around Tony and Tony’s pressed up into the cavern between their bodies.
“Just find the cube.” He manages to bite out, almost running from the lab in a sudden fit of desperation. The air is cleaner outside and he pulls in deep breaths, calming as he feels Stark relax at his absence. It hurts more than any of the punches he felt hit Stark earlier. It shouldn’t matter, Stark is little more than a stranger and yet. Yet, they are connected and shouldn’t that make it easier for them to speak? Shouldn’t Stark feel how the panic coiled tight in Steve’s gut? Shouldn’t he want to do something about it?
“Well, this is–” Steve starts, but he can’t bring himself to say this situation isn’t what he was referring to. To be honest, Steve wouldn’t mind if this tentative step into friendship lead somewhere more romantic.
“Yep.”
He shrugs it off and thanks JARVIS as he takes the cup, sipping it greedily when he realizes his creamer is already mixed in. Seems Stark as been tinkering with his kitchen appliances. The idea makes him feel unreasonably warm, so he swallows the last of his cup and rinses it in the sink.
"Well, next time.” Tony’s voice is shaky and horse, but he is so comfortable that no matter how painful being held like this may be, he will not move for anything. “Next time, come find me. I'm not really good about the whole talking thing but. Well, I get it.” He uses his free hand to rub up along Steve’s bicep, slower than would be useful to warm it but it’s the only indulgence he will allow. As if this entire situation is not a huge indulgence. “Body heat is really the only thing that can get me through feeling that kind of numb. So, come find me. I won't judge you, I promise."
Tony looks like the cat that caught the canary every time he glances up to find Steve grinning at him like a fool. Steve thinks he should always look like that. It makes him flush, makes him duck his head and cough into his fist, but that only seems to make Tony happier. It’s ridiculous how easy everything feels. Steve knew the talking would come easy, knew there would never come a time when he couldn’t find something to joke around about with Tony. The soft glances though, the little grins and the bumping of their feet under the table, that he never really considered. He could picture kissing Tony, could picture it before all the strange memories even started. He never anticipated how looking down to see Tony’s hand resting on the table would look like such a blatant invitation though.
“Nice?” He does not know. This man is hiding a secret more deadly than anything like palladium poisoning without conscious effort. How on earth can someone so innately curious not figure out something so core to his own existence? There must be a reason, a reason she feels a deep blood thirsty need to understand.
The order drinks, or rather Tony orders them drinks. Tony orders the appetizers too and when the waiters comes by with them he orders their entries as well. Some part of Steve wants to protest, wants to insist that Tony is going a little overboard with the gentlemen act and that he can certainly open his own door and order his own meals. Most of him is so outrageously charmed by the silly gestures that he can’t make himself stop smiling long enough to really take a good sip of the wine.
“It didn’ hurt.” And now a perfect little pout fills the boy’s cheeks with air and Maria’s heart with a dizzying adoration. “The water- the water huuurts.”
They stay sitting like that for a while, just breathing against each other. It feels so good, feels as good as it always has everytime Steve gets to have him like this. He wants to fall asleep with Tony’s back pressed against his chest, wants to wrap his lover tight in his arms and keep him safe from all the loneliness. He can’t even begin to imagine how alone Tony must have felt, how much it killed him to see Steve and not be able to reach out. If Steve ever had to see Tony, ever had to watch him go about his day without being able to hold him… Well, he honestly wouldn’t be able to do it. Ever since the first night they spent together all those months ago, Steve’s known his arms were made to hold Tony. He knows his love for Tony is something that lives deep in his bones, something beyond conscious thought and memories. Even when he didn’t know what Tony meant to him, he wanted him. Ached to have him near.
Steve could get Tony to write off one night stands and parties with people he barely tolerated, in exchange for going to the school football games and taking an entire day drive to Vermont for no other reason than spending time together. He could get Tony to pine after him for nearly a year and a half without letting on for a second that he was doing the same thing. He could be brave and charming and wonderful, by suddenly squaring his shoulders and looking Tony dead in the eye mid argument over some dumb TV show. Only to then chance everything and kiss Tony like the entire world was ending and this was the last thing he would ever do.
They’re quiet as the ride up and Steve doesn’t even think about where they’re going. His eyes are closed and he can feel the rhythm of Tony’s breathing against his arm. He wonders if they will spend the night together, if he might be able to talk Tony into at least sleeping next to each other. The empty side of his bed would fit Tony perfectly, Steve would fit exactly into the space Tony leaves open on his own bed.
It plays through again.
“A press conference? Tony you have to go to the hospital.” Pepper objects, arms coming up in an aborted move to grab his arm, likely afraid of the injuries necessitating said hospital visit.
“Sorry.” Steve replies, but his smile betrays any true sentiment. Tony sit beside him again, leans his head on Steve’s shoulder and breathes deeply in the air around them. After a time he feels Steve’s hand run through his hair and hums at the sensation. The hand travels down, over Tony’s ear and down his neck into the hollow between throat and shoulder. A finger traces the tendon back up and then travels down over his adam’s apple and into the dip of his collarbone. Tony allows it all, closes his eyes and settles further against Steve’s side. Latched together.
“It hurts.” Tony says in his unique mix of pleading and petulance that she so greatly adores. Despite the hammering in her chest, a delighted smile breaks across her face and she lets her body list a little to the side on the door frame.
"Okay." And it turns out that Steve brought a third blanket with him, this one looks to be his comforter based on size and general plumpness. Tony only notices because Steve turns back around to go back into the living room and in the process pulls the blanket up from dragging behind him to drape over his head. His steps are slow and a little wobbly.
The meeting with Obadiah runs exactly to script, mostly identical to his last life and immortalized in a tiny black rectangle. The man knew about the arc reactor and when he touched the thing Tony nearly threw up. He promised Obadiah he will lay low while simultaneously planning to attend every single board meeting ever and calls Happy to pick him up the second the man leaves. Pepper comes along and relays the information she got back from the hospital, which mysteriously had Tony listed as Yinsen’s next of kin in their databases. (Tony had some time  and access to the internet while waiting for Obadiah to arrive). She also gave him a list of all the meetings they would need to schedule and in a bizarre change of position had demanded Tony take some time to himself and not attend every meeting the day after coming home.
