Normally Dean didn't cry, didn't allow himself that luxury; taught by his dad that any feelings he had were useless, that they only got in the way in their line of work the work he hadn't even want to be a part of, not at that age. But it didn't even occur to him to try to stop the tears from rolling down his cheeks and splashing unnaturally loud in the quiet cold. He was rocking back and forward head bent over Cas whispering mumbled words that didn't quiet string together that he wasn't even aware he was saying out loud. Some were angry at Cas at himself " how could you have been so stupid?" he garbled between sobs shaking Cas violent side to side feeling nausea at the lack of response and the floppy unnatural movement of the body below. And the far quieter and broken crack as Dean pulled Cas closer to his chest placing his forehead against cas'' and rocking slowly, methodically to his words back and forward, back and forward. " I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Cas, I never should have and I'm sorry, this is my fault all my fault, I'm sorry."
“Okay. What did you wish to discuss?"
Wiggling his toes through the dark Graham cracker sand, he watched as the particles parted, spread around him only to fall back to the earth clinging to one another. There was a time he would have been able to see every individual grain, to pinpoint its age, its origin, to know how long it had sat at the bottom of the ocean, how many times the bitter waves had crashed along its surface, but he had never know what they felt like as they cascaded somehow both soft and rough along his palms and through his fingers. He had believed then that he knew everything there was to know about the world, about life, but he knew now that there was a difference between knowing and understanding. He may have known all there was to know about sand, but that didn't mean he had experienced it. He hadn't taken the time to think about how he related to it. He hadn't felt its grainy texture between wet wiggling toes, or rough palms.
"Yeah. You just enjoy the view. I'll be sitting here with my eyes closed." Dean closed his eyes tightly as the seat rocked forward. Scooting forward, Dean opened his eyes "Nope that's worse, definitely worse."
“Tomorrow. I can’t tell you what, but I have another idea. It’s perfect for the whole learning about life thing.”
"This is the position you want to be in, got it."
Grabbing Cas' wrist, Dean dragged him towards the ride. "Come on before the line gets too long."
Memories from last night surfaced, floating through his brain in bits and pieces Dean was desperate to grab and cradle to his chest. He couldn’t stop the stupid dopey grin from taking over his face, even if he wanted to. But he didn’t want to. He wanted to remember this moment. He finally got to hold cas in his arms in the way he’d wanted to for so many years. In a way where he didn’t have to count the seconds, where he didn’t have to draw himself back and lie about the pain it caused.
"Yes Dean, believe it or not despite having to deal with you, I know what happiness is."
"Well hello."
"Sure that was it." Sam tilted his mug drinking his stupid calming lavender tea obnoxiously loud.
” Dean whispers, soft and desperate. He was never one for begging. People weren't there to help, so nothing ever came from asking. Life was just something you had to figure out on your own. But as always in his life Cas was the exception. He was always there. When Dean prayed, calling desperate and needing, Cas followed without hesitation and Dean
Burning with the heat of the sun he felt like he was melting, skin falling from his limbs in a gush of distorted scarred flesh. The heat radiated off him exploding from the inside out as if he had magma flowing through his heart and back out through his mouth. Fire licked up the spine of his frostbitten back blooming into his wings, scorching his feathers till they burnt to a crisp and fell into ash that floated alongside his falling shell.
There was a groggy groan and a long series of rustles, before the door was slid inward squeaky on old hinges riddled with rust.
"She didn't ask for help, we were just catching up and she mentioned the case and I asked if I could come help her."
“The stars are beautiful. I’ve never really been able to see them properly before now.”
A small smile spread on Dean's lips as he made an extravagant gesture down at himself, leaning his weight back onto one palm. "What do you think, this skill just happened overnight?"
Dean smiled, a small tilt to his lips, glad that Cas' Casness hadn't changed. Not in the ways that mattered. "Dude, it's different if you're just standing there staring at me versus if you're asleep."
"Okay." Dean said slowly, shifting awkwardly in his chair with a dragging squeak. "You sure, you don't want me to come?"
"All right, I think I will choose."
“All I want is for you two to be happy. And don’t forget that you can talk to me about anything okay.”
"Okay first of all I'm not buying that. Secondly," Dean leaned down resting his arm against Cas forcing his elbow to rest on the table. "I could use the time away from here too, I think the books are more likely to kill me than anything else at this point."
of praise,
Grip harsh like vines spiralled around old oak trees, Dean wrapped his hand around Cas’ shoulder, pulling him closer, encircling his crushing arms around his back, fingers spread brushing along the outward edges of Cas’ shoulder blades.
“Hey sleepy head,” He forces his eyes open, head tilting up to Dean, whose smile is wide and bright and far too pretty for Cas' brain to process so early.
"You should get some sleep," Cas remarks worriedly.
He wanted advice, hoping there was a way he could complete the necessary human task of sleeping without having to suffer the burden of his own fears and subconscious. He knew that Dean would understand, that perhaps he could help him.
Cas' hands were clenched tightly into fists resting above his knees, but his shoulders had dropped and his breaths evened.
"Well, I think you should tell him. You've already lost him once and I know how much not getting that chance hurt you." Sam breathed long and slow preparing himself from the inevitable backlash of denial and regression, "I think it would be good for both of you if you talked to him about it. You never know he could always feel the same way."
Careful Dean lifted his hand, resting his palm heavy on Cas' shoulder he tried to push him away. Cas’ groaned nuzzling his head deeper into the crook of Dean’s neck, dark hairs dragging ticklishly against his skin. Dean laughed, a soft rubble.
"Okay" Cas' reply was fast and hurried as if scared the word wouldn't get out faster than his tongue would freeze in fear.
Dean laughed surprised at how light he felt even with Cas’ weight laying on top of him. He would never understand how Cas could look both so grumpy and be so cute at the same time.
Sam barrelled onward, knowing that Dean was simply trying to deflect. "I think that this is just one of those things in life that you have to risk, because well if you don't one day when Cas is gone for real you'll sit there walling about all the missed opportunities that you could have had if you'd only listened to your brother."
offer life changing awe inspiring advice?”
“Cas relax. It wouldn’t kill you to unwind for a while.”
Dean laughs, bright as an LED and as airy as an aero. “Come on, we've gotta get up soon.”
that doesn't change whether you have wings or not. You're my best friend, my only friend lately that seems capable of staying alive. And being human doesn't make you weak. Do you think because I can't snap my fingers and reappear somewhere else or that because I can't make demons light up from the inside like an explodable glow stick that I'm weak?"
"Please Cas"
Dean stood staring at the beige blur in front of him. Struggling to maintain balance, Dean stepped forward tentatively. He had to make sure that it was Cas, his Cas. He needed it to be.
Dean closed his eyes not wanting to look at Cas' face as he pulled the sheet over his head. Throwing the torch, Sam set the pier ablaze and Dean watched as it slowly grew, climbing upwards. When the sheet caught fire an odd almost calming cold settled over him like the first dunk into a swimming pool in the heat of summer, but Dean knew it wouldn't be long till he was stuck there drowning in the emptiness.
"Sam."
Dean nods as if Cas' story means anything to him. "Right so if that's all, I'm going to head back to my room to get some sleep."
"Cas," Dean laughs, "seriously there's no need to keep thanking me. I'm here for you throughout whatever this is. Whether it lasts or not, we'll figure things out."
Eventually he was trained to become the perfect soldier, a vessel who acted without thought. A way for others' actions and beliefs to be carried without the brute of the consequences. He had always secretly longed to fly without purpose again. To extend his wings and see how high he could shoot upwards.
"We'll just stay here then and keep gazing at the musty books." He said in a mocking tone.
that.”
“What eons of years and you never bothered to learn to dance. Why am I not surprised?”
to interrupt you if you
"And I wasn’t sure you’d be interested. You’ve never
"What? I'll have you know that I'm very admiral and people wish they were more like me."
Bracing one hand on the wheel Dean dragged the other across his face. "God it's been a long time since we've gotten any moments like those."
Cas eyed the bottle skeptically, but took it anyway. “Thank you.”
Dean waved his hand carelessly through the air. "I'm fine, it's only for a few minutes."
Dean stopped turning on his heels to face Cas again. Struggling to breath, he was thinking so many thoughts all at once that even he couldn't figure out how he felt. He was happy, so unbelievably happy that Cas was alive, and he was relieved that he wouldn't have to learn to live in a world without him. But he was also angry at himself for blaming Jack and Cas. He was angry and hurt and looking for someone to blame, something to hold onto to keep the guilt at bay, and he'd hurt the poor kid.
A small mischievous smile grew on Cas’ lips even as his tone stayed decipitavely even. “I am beginning to think I should take back what I said.”
Dean turned to Cas' smile wide with the innocent joy of child fondness and nostalgia. "If we're given you the proper human experience, we've gotta start with the beginning and a childhood is no real childhood without cotton candy."
The echo faded and the silence settled amongst the rustling tug of sand, the splattering of waves on rock and the howling dance of air through branches.
Dean nodded in understanding.
Dean rolled his eyes, shaking his hand through the air up and down. “Dance with me?”
"You sure".
, one who was worthy of more than he would ever allow himself,
Lifting his hand to his mouth Dean whispered, quiet enough that even he himself was unable to hear it “One, Two, Three”. He surged forward using his shoulder to throw the door inward. Blinking he struggled to take in the space before, the sudden loss of light. When his eyes cleared he only had several seconds to take in the small room before him, against one wall there was a hideously patterned floral couch with stains he didn’t want to know where they came from, a Tv on the other and a small kitchen tucked in the corner and off to the side two doors. Before a girl was running at him, arms outstretched, sharp needle-like fangs, already barred.
Sam snorted. "Yeah you're gonna have to save all the Dean emotional allowance to talk to Cas. Right?"
an inconvenience at the moment.”
Cas cherished the food, the complexity of flavors and textures his human brain could now pick out. Somehow providing more variety then when he was an angel and could pinpoint every molecule and their atomic origin.
There was a soft groan of contentment, that reminded Dean of a cat stretching towards the sun after a long nap, and a brush of something along his neck.
"Hey," Dean knocked on Cas' door dragging his boots heavily along the carpet. "Me and Sam found something. Might be a lead, might not. We figure it's worth checking out in case we can get any more info on the whole angle sitch."
"Wow did you see her
Dean placed his hand on Cas' shoulder, forcing him to look into his eyes. "How bad is it Cas? Is it permanent?"
Dean chuckled but the sound was hollow, evaporating to nothing in the windy air. "I'm fine, just this thing goes higher than I thought."
"Dean."
Images flashed before him faster than his eyes could see, a splatter of red, the tumble of a piece of ash, a crumbling of limbs, a cry of pain and all consuming darkness.
"No," Dean waved his hands through the air as if physically erasing something. "It's fine I was the one that… you know," Dean scratched at the hairs that ran along the back of his neck, eyes on his hands hoping that his words would come out smooth instead of squeaky, "offered for you to stay here. So you know."
Dean groaned obnoxiously loud, while tilting his head down. "Come on okay watch me. Let your arms move to the beat of the music, bop your head. You don't have to do anything crazy."
Sam stops talking and its several long moments later when Dean grips Cas shoulder tighter than he should, a final check to make sure Cas is real. "Let's get you home buddy."
"I... uh, well I missed you when you were gone and it made me realize something. Well, not that I already didn't know it's just now my opinion on what I suppose I've known for a while, years actually. But that's not important. what's important is that I'm trying to say that I..." God he felt like he was going to throw up. There were way too many people around, and no matter how much he felt like he was gaping like a fish thrown onto the sand he didn’t seem to be getting enough air. And Cas was looking at him funny and god he’d just got him back. What was he thinking? This was a terrible idea. Maybe Sam was right; he is way too emotionally constipated.
"Dean-" Cas tried to interject, voice soft.
Dean was scared, in fact one might even say he was terrified, but he had to do it eventually. He had to tell Cas how he felt. No matter what it brought with it even if he ... lost Cas as a friend. No stop that you know that's not going to happen Cas isn't like that even if he doesn't feel that way he's not the type of person to leave you for feeling that way.
Sam finally catches up to Dean on one of his rare excursions to the kitchen.
It takes a second for his mind to catch up and remember last night, he must have fallen asleep.
“Because
Cas pried his fingers apart watching as they clenched and unclenched the fabric of his pants. "Thank you, Dean" The words were quiet and barely there in the way truth always seemed to carry just under the world's radar.
Call it whatever, but Castiel wasn't anyone. He was Castiel, and was just what Dean needed.
This was Cas’ place?
Fine, so he would take orange juice in glasses outside—wait. What glasses?
“To get me a drink,” Cas shrugged, “You didn’t get me one, and I am not drinking anything in which Dean Winchester dipped anything.”
He turned his head to the general direction of the sound, just as Dean called out, “In here!”
Meg laughed at that.
Why had they pulled him out? Why didn't they let him be at peace? Why did they have to pull him out of heaven into this hell? Why??
“Ticklish?” he asked Cas, doing it again, but he didn’t expect Cas to abandon his neck at that. Next moment, Dean’s hands were held up on either side of his head, and Cas looked down at him with a raised brow.
He had come to the kitchen to ask if the vodka was here. He left it with a beer bottle from Meg’s stash in his hand.  This would have to do till the booze came in.
Dean cut his body off from his mind.
Still uncertain, he placed the pill on his tongue and grabbed the water bottle.
He must've been tired too. They had been through so much. They deserved to rest.
“I see that look, Cassie,” Ellen was grinning, “It’s the look they give Jo.”
He had never done this before, because, until a while ago, he couldn’t hold anything in his mouth. He knew how it worked, because he had been on the receiving end many times, but this was the first time he was about to give someone a blowjob. He didn’t know how bad he could do, but he knew that it wouldn’t be very very.
He was thankful that he had enough brain-cells to decide that he was not going to tell her who his student was going to be.
Offer him the…
“Take a guess.” She smirked at him, and took his hand to drag him through a group of people ‘chatting.’
He barely knew the guy, why was he thinking like that?
He put his chin on Cas’ shoulder, and smiled.
He slowed down here, listening for the thud thud of boots behind him.
Tears threatened to spill out of his eyes. He doused the fry in ketchup and put it in his mouth, licking his fingers afterwards.
“Sure,” Dean shrugged too, and then a colour changed on his face, “I mean, if you’re free, that is. I don’t want to trouble you or anything.”
This was a ploy to get Dean away from the table, and from the thoughts of people and their words.
Dean groaned.
He didn’t have anything better to do anyways.
“Fuck!”
The music went down for the two seconds the phone buzzed again.
Another bark was heard, this time, a bit more excited one, followed by a Doodle.
“Can I do that again?” Cas asked, and Dean really liked his voice like that. It made his skin prickle.
Dean gulped.
This didn’t even come close to the plans.
“It’s mute,” Dean said, and Cas looked at him to see that he was smirking. “Also, you’re fifteen minutes late.”
Dean didn't know from experience what it felt like to be lulled to sleep-- or maybe he did? Seeing that he had fallen asleep listening to repetitive soothing sounds many times.
He was still very tired, and he needed Cas, so that he could fall asleep again.
Dean flipped to another page.
Just like the last of air in his lungs.
Was he blushing? No, why would he blush? This was just Cas.
He wanted to yell Cas' name. Call him back to save him from these people. But be couldn't make a single sound because there was water inside him.
Cas stepped upto the door, and rung the door bell, mentally reciting the words he was going to say.
The kiss wasn’t deep, but it was good, and Dean didn’t want it to end. He shifted his body so that his knees were under him, and he was able to lean in. He put his arms around Cas and pulled him closer which caused his lips to press into Cas’ teeth
"Are you okay?" Cas asked, helping him back onto the bed.
Dean didn't feel the kiss, because he was still half asleep, and his brain could only grasp the shaking or the kissing at one time.
“I’m free,” Cas nodded, and the refrained from physically face palming. “I can help you.”
[kissing][blowjob][handjob][msub Dean][somewhat softdom Cas][mutual orgasm][a little tickling][and some growling Cas]
He wouldn’t. Ever.
Cas didn’t know. He had never been to the ocean.
Dean sat down on the table, making sure he wasn’t sitting on the glass.
“You should take your shoes off.” Cas suggested.
By the sound of it, Cas really liked that.
Also, Cas could bet the kitchen door didn’t creek like his did.
Being the type of kid that he was, he knew how to pick locks with bobby pins. He’d learned that on the internet, and then had tried it on every door he came across until the art was perfected. So when he found the one and only door that was locked, he went to borrow a pin from the bathroom.
What could’ve made him leave her?
His body was no longer cut off.
Dean hadn’t told him that he was. He distinctly remembered that he wasn’t even smiling. He was laying there, with his mouth agape, and eyes wide. And Cas knew.
He could feel Dean smiling. Could he hear what he was thinking? Oh no.
“And you’re here to watch him?”
Wow, that long? Time flew really fast.
“I was a weird kid,” Dean shook his head, smiling as he put a football trophy up next to a track running one, on second prize and one first.
When he had applied to tutor for credit, he had not thought at all that he would be stuck in this situation. It was two days ago that he had been told that Dean Winchester—the badest of bad ideas of school—had been assigned to him. The boy drove a vintage Chevy Impala to school which, according to the rumors, he dragged raced with. He was barely present in any classes; Cas had no idea how his attendance was high enough to be promoted.
It wasn’t a question, and so he didn’t answer. He moved his hips matching the rhythm of Cas’ strokes, not stopping himself from moaning when Cas moved his thumb over the head of his dick.
“Sorry,” he smiled apologetically, “I haven’t really unpacked anything, right now.”
“What?” Cas sat up.
And now, here he was, failing in History of all subjects.
They shouldn’t be here.
This was a bad idea.
Wait, he wanted to tell Cas. Let him wake up so that he could kiss him back, but Cas decided that he couldn't wait anymore.
“I’m so glad you do,” Cas mumbled, kissing his way down Dean’s neck to his shoulders.
It was refreshing to have someone clinging to him who didn’t have alcohol lacing her breath.
“Where do you think I should put the angels?”
He just placed his notebook in his lap, and fixed his eyes onto its cover. He wasn’t going to look up. Nope. Not today. Not until Dean got up and left.
"I'm good." Dean croaked, and licked his lips.
The only problem is...
This is what Dean had always wished he could do. He wanted to stare into Cas’ eyes for hours at end, and never looking away. Never having to close his eyes, even to blink. He wanted to stare into them until he lost consciousness, and then when he would wake up the next day, Cas’ eyes would be there to greet him.
Dean sighed.
The neighbor’s freckled smile was beautiful.
“Now,” Dean said, “I won’t do anything. I promise. You don’t have to be afraid of me or anything.”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Doesn't look like nothing." Cas said, and got up. "You should take medicine."
He was knocked off his feet twice on his way up to the second floor. Apparently there were other people who had gotten this idea too. The bathroom was filled with girls, and then there was a line outside, too.
“Okay,” he nodded, and Cas smiled like he was proud of him.
Then the chair between them moved.
Cas moaned, placing a hand on Dean’s head, and he took it as a go sign.
He shook his head.
Dean admired that about him… okay no, ‘admired’ was just saying it subtly. This was way more than that.
“It’s alright,” Cas nodded, finding himself smiling.
The person held Dean to his chest, and Dean didn't have the energy to pull away.
And he texted him.
“Tiktok; Hi, Impala_67chevy, Silvesgayster posted a new video.
And not just with their hands.
Even now, Cas knew what to do.
Interesting, Cas thought, just as Dean came out holding two mugs in his hand.
Dean did as he was told, and if he was honest, he didn't feel any different.
The phone buzzed in his pocket again.
“Stop crying, you’ll mess up your mascara.” He said, and that was when Dean noticed that his cheeks were wet.
"I'm sorry." Cas let go of his arm, and sat down on the bed with him. "I didn't mean to startle you; I was just shocked to see someone in my room."
“Are you sure?” Cas asked.
Cas frowned; his pancakes were cold.
It was a heart shaped photo frame of a little younger Dean and a Dark haired girl.
"I'm so sorry." He really couldn't help it.
Cas' scent engulfed him. His cologne combined with the scent of coffee beans was very calming, yet somehow, exciting. The pillow was soft under his head, and through it he could feel Cas' folded legs. If he looked up, he could see the guy smiling down at him.
He didn’t need to be told that, he already knew. Besides, that was false… okay fine, not entirely, but yeah. False.
"You should lay down," Cas suggested, and Dean looked back at him to see that he was still smiling, now sitting with his knees folded under him on the bed.
His whole body shuddered at the sensation.
“Sorry,” Dean came back, “He lost his ball over there.”
Dean watched Cas’ hand, and then his eyes followed along his arm, to his shoulder and then onto his face. His lips were pressed against each other. They were dry, but Cas didn’t seem to mind. His cheek bones were very pronounced and there weren’t any bags under his eyes, unlike one would expect from a 4.0 GPA student. His lower lashes looked like soft delicate petals of a wilting rose. His eyes…
Right now, he felt his body calm down, and the cool air hit him again. He didn’t mind it; it felt like a cherry on top of everything.
Not babe, darling, love—or any of the other names that he uses in the rest of the day. Just my name. Always.
Dean chuckled.
“We should go,” Cas nodded, and—he didn’t have any books to pick, or coat to put back on. He just stood there awkwardly, waiting for Dean to get up.
“Fuck, this is torture,” Cas mumbled and he tore himself away from Dean and off the bed, leaving him lonely on the bed.
Ploy? Or was it called a plot?
Nope, he was going to the neighbor’s house to say hi. Just a hi. He would only stand outside the door, offer him the pie and welcome him to the neighborhood. Maybe offer him some help, just to be polite. He would politely say ‘No, thank you’, and Cas would be on his way home in no time.
“I’m not here for that, boy,” she waved him over, still looking out the window. “I’m here for that.”
He is…
He left her?
“That what?” he walked over to look over her shoulder, and then he saw it.
Dean had to clear his throat to get his attention.
To his utter surprise, it went down.
He added that to his mental shopping list.
Balthazar, Cas remembered him. They met at a gay bar, and had had their first and only date on valentine’s day. It was great, they both loved the time they spent together. But after that, Balthazar went radio silent.
“Thanks, man,” Dean said again, looked back at the pie once more.
No, he didn’t hear it, he… felt it.
“You can’t tell me you wouldn’t tap that.”
“Hmm,” Dean scratched his chin, “sounds great!”
Dean didn't know he could be more shocked. He didn't mean giving... did he?
He couldn’t even wipe them, because that would do exactly what Cas had said.
Good, he was leaving.
“I’ll get you some more.” Cas shrugged and Dean rolled his eyes.
“Let me see,” Dean leaned back his chair and held up his fingers, “I know that in fourteen ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue,” he lowered a finger, “I’m just like my country— I’m young, scrappy and hungry, and I’m not throwing away my shot,” he lowered another finger, “Ring around a rosie, pocket full of posie, ashes, ashes, we all fall down,” he lowered his thumb, “back in sixteen sixty-six, a baker set the whole of London on fire, “he lowered another finger, “and even though it’s irrelevant, mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell.”
“Cas,” Dean repeated after him, then he tried to spell it.
That he could check.
There was no reason to go back up there. There was one very good of reasons to stay down here.
Not so very thankfully, the phone buzzed again in his hand, and he threw it back in again, making sure this time it wasn’t too hard.
“Sorry I’m late,” came the voice from behind him, and Dean smiled.
The book shelf was full now. There were three boxes of old records on it, and in the top shelves were hardbacks. If there was place there, it was reachable by miracle, and the statues looked fragile.
The severe pain and suffering he had suffered through before and then after sinking to the bottom had all been worth it. He was at peace here. Just like he thought he would be. He didn't have to endure anything anymore.
He did feel a headache coming on, but not in the head Cas was referring to.
The rhythm of Dean’s foot tapping changed, and Cas recognized another song, but he couldn’t tell what exactly it was.
The he saw him.
In fact, Cas didn't do anything after that. It was as if he was gone.
how was that huh? This is literally my first time writing same-sex sex, so lemme know what yall think. I'd appreciate constructive criticism.
“Come here,” he put his hand back under Dean’s folded knee again, and put his face close to Dean’s.
Cas was here, watching him from the waters in front of him.
“They did,” Cas admitted. As a matter of fact, it was pasted at the very start of this very notebook, but he wasn’t going to say that. “But, I need to know when you are available, because they also told me that you’re not most of the time.”
Finally, he set the dog down, who ran over to the boxes.
Oh no.
The wind were picking up as Castiel closed the door behind him.
“It’s really nice,” Dean told him getting up on his knees to kiss him.
“It’s a good party,” she said, finally stopping, “you’re just grumpy because you didn’t get high in an hour.”
He rolled his eyes.
“Wow.” Dean didn’t have any other words.
"Ah," it dawned on Cas, and Dean was thankful for that, "you're lucky you have me."
They wouldn't stop, and Dean couldn't move his body to push them away. They were hurting him, like they always did. With their words and their expression and their sneers, and now with their hands.
“This is Lisa,” the way he said backed up Cas’s thoughts, “Lisa Braeden.”
His body still would not accept that he wanted to stay. Like everything else in the world, it too was a traitor.
“Him.” There was a grin in Ellen’s voice. “He moved in yesterday evening, I saw the truck.”
If the party were the streets of some city, this room was what people saw when they were roof topping.
Dean didn’t know that quiet Cas from English class lived in a house off campus. He always thought the guy lived in his little corner of the dormitories and rarely ever got out. He didn’t now that he actually was never there in the first place.
“Would you, uh,” Cas shrugged, “Would you like some help? With that? I can help, you?”
He focused his eyes onto Cas', looking for an answer. What happened? Why was he trying to wake him up?
He didn’t feel them though, and he didn’t want to either.
“I didn’t call you,” Dean shook his head, popping the tortured fry into his mouth. This was him having mercy.
Dean had a feeling that he had watched that movie. He couldn't remember the name though, he had other stuff to do.
He folded one of his legs under him.
Dean turned the page of the book. The pen in his right hand flipping over and over as his boot tapped lightly against the leg of the table. He bit his lip as his eyes roamed the pages of the book.
"Yes, go ahead and laugh." He shook his head.
“Ellen.” Cas, nodded, closing the door behind her. “Shouldn’t you be at the B and B?”
“What?” Dean’s question stopped his train of thought.
For some reason, Dean was pretty sure that Cas didn’t know there were that many people here.
Cas didn’t need to see his smile to know he was happy. He had always just known. Just like the time they had laid in the grass in the park after sneaking away from middle school. Dean was just looking at the clouds above them; one of them looked like a horse. He had pointed it out to Cas and he had smiled at Dean and said “I really like it when you’re happy.”
“Ow.” He rubbed the back of his head, and turned to check of he had tipped anything over. That was when the bottle of ketchup—that had been tumbling until now—fell onto his head.
Dean bit his lip. He pushed Cas back, and stepped off the bed, and Cas watched him, utterly confused until he got on his knees. His jeans did little to make the floor feel soft, but that was the least of his concerns.
Son of a bitch.
“Awesome!”
“I’m not—”
He remembered really well the first time he had had to sit in the front in any class. Professor Donatello—Donnie—had summoned him to the front because he was found snoozing off in the back.
The sleep that he needed.
The person kept compressing his chest.
It was the third day of his week long holiday, since Nora was mad that he didn’t take any days off. It was windy with possibility of rain, maybe in the evening. He didn’t get up very early, even though it still was at nine in the morning; his was as late as it got for him since the teenage. He had showered, and the water was just the right warm. He had already laid out clothes for himself, and that made him very happy. The pancakes looked great, the blueberries looked mouth-watering, the bottle of maple syrup was new, and the coffee—oh, the coffee.
Dean was in heaven.
Shouldn’t have.
Dean couldn't take people anymore, he just wanted to talk to someone. But he couldn't disturb anyone.
He didn't need to tell the fry anything at all. Why was he wearing makeup? Why didn’t he wear his jacket today? Why did his jeans have a tear on one knee? Why was he wearing a LOTR fandom shirt? Why was he alone? Why was the sky blue? What did one wall say to the other? Why was his phone so annoying?
Finally, Dean heard a sound.
Cas let out a sad moan when Dean removed his hand from his cock. “Why?” he breathed.
Then he noticed that Cas was sitting with his hands in his lap, watching his every movement.
Now, at the bottom of the pool, Dean heard again what he had heard then.
Call it whatever, but it was working.
If you don't like funky food combinations, skip.
Not even his voice.
The loud splash of him piercing the surface was quickly muffled out by the water.
What he didn't know from experience was what it felt like to have a person sing him to sleep. So everything he knew about lullabies was from reading.
Oh, he remembered. He was going to offer help.
His lungs tried to hold it in, but they could t grasp at it. Instead, they caught air, and the cold winds rushed into his body through his mouth.
He had read about all of this before coming here. And even if he hadn’t, he knew that there was no air down here for him to breathe in. All of that information was there, stored in his head. All he needed now, was wait for his body to catch up, and stop trying to look for it.
One of them—a curvy black girl in a short white dress—was even ‘kind’ enough to ask, “Are you okay?”
Dean opened his eyes to find Cas grinning, but he wasn’t able to pull back, because he got pulled forth by Cas’s other hand.
Cas lifted his head, and folded his arms over his chest.
Dean managed to grunt a response. His throat was dry.
He did!
He frowned when he found only orange juice and eggs.
I’ve found him in the porch at night too, just after dinner, when its getting dark. He goes there to look at the stars. He doesn’t take a blanket with him, so I do that. Sometimes he has miracle with him too, and I find him whispering to the dog about his favourite constellations, and the stories behind them. It’s the mythology ones that he likes. Like the one of Orion, where the goddess of love ran to save him, in the process ending up creating red roses, and then caught him just before he died, and made him into the constellation.
Cas didn't call his name after that.
“Hello!”
“My pleasure,” Cas had to gulp, his throat was going dry. Hearing his name come off Dean’s tongue so easily- he couldn’t, “And you can call me Cas.” he blurted out.
If he did, that was good.
I sometimes watch him read stories to Jack before bed. He makes the most silliest of noises, and gives the most accurate expressions, without breaking character even when Jack is cackling beside him. He loves it when his son wears the clothes he bought for him, and he loves to play dress up. Some days, I find them asleep on the floor dressed up in boots and pirate hats, with their sabers beside them as they snore on the floor. He carries Jack to bed, and never forgets to kiss his forehead and whispering “I’m so proud of you”, even when the kid is dead as a rock.
“Why are you doing this?” He asked her, taking a sip from his coffee to hide himself.
The glasses were outside in the box. All he had in the kitchen was the coffee cup he pulled out last night, and the coffee cup he pulled out this morning, both unwashed.
As if it wasn't enough already, they started compressions again, until they pushed so hard that the water which had gone into his lungs started to pour out.
I find you.
“Great!” Dean smiled.
“Beautiful,” Cas mumbled, sitting back to look at Dean. His hands grazed the sides of his body, then roamed up over his chest while his eyes marveled at what he beheld.
It was bad in classes, Cas wanted to confirm. It was worse now.
The guy didn’t show up again, but that didn’t stop Cas from looking, and after the umpteenth time he stopped by the kitchen window on his way to get some water, he went straight for his trench coat and then out the house.
“What if he’s not gay?”
“I’m not working!” he put his hands up in surrender, “I’m here to get Pie.”
There he was, right across the street, hitting a mat with a racket in his yard. His short brown hair was a mess, as if he had just gotten out of bed. His clothes—jean shorts and a Zeppelin t- shirt—backed up that thought.
This wasn’t going to be bad at all.
“Ow,” he complained when she was done.
All he wanted to do was get up and go knock on Dean’s door again. Just to see that freckled smile again.
But that wasn’t the problem.
Cas looked up to see Dean sit down again, this time closer than before. He could smell his lavender and woody cologne from here. It embraced him like a pair of wings, and it was oddly soothing.
"You trusted Meg Masters for this?"
Dean chuckled.
Dean took a sip of soda, and folded his other leg under him too.
tw// NSFW!!!
That was false.
So... he has to tutor a student for a grade...
“Good,” Cas kissed the corner of his mouth and pulled himself up to rub their cocks together.
Cas rolled his eyes. "I know Dean. I've seen you and Sam do this hundreds of times. I understand the idea behind it. I was there when the first guns were built."
The gentle haze was only broken by the startling cry of a bird close to their side. Once one landed, several followed, scooting towards the smell of food with sharp piercing cries. Eyeing them wearily, Dean pulled his sandwich closer to his chest.
room?"
“Huh. Guess I never thought of it that way.” Dean’s voice sounded distant as if the wind was carrying it in the opposite direction even as it whipped along, burrowing from Dean to Cas.
Cas leaned back in his seat but kept his gaze trained on Dean.
"And he knows that Dean. So no," Sam waved his hand threateningly through the air, "explanation."
"But you asked me I-"
"Saving the world, the apocalypse, all that stuff, they're the big things. The markers, the things that took up all our time that people think of as significant but... '' Dean breathed deeply, pausing to look at Cas. "That's not
Dean learned forward until Cas' face was only a few inches from his. His breath hitched and he wondered if Cas could feel it on his lips. He breathed deeply, hoping he could gain courage from the air.
He clutched his head, trying to stop it from spinning in motion with the dizziness swirling in his mind.
Sam rolled his eyes. "Perfect model to be teaching Cas how best to be human."
A slow broken sigh leaves Cas. “You still don’t think you deserve to be loved. But you're wrong Dean," He slowly slides his hand up Dean's neck till he's cupping his cheek in his hand, "love isn’t something you have to earn.”
Slowly hands clasping the lapels of his coat Cas sat stiffly beside Dean.
Cas turned and began filling his cup. "Cas, I know you just got back, but Sam found a case nearby. It seems to be a small vamp nest, shouldn't take more than a couple days. Do you want to come?"
Dean looked over at Cas letting himself take him in, because he can now. There's no need to hide behind darting glances and half hearted words. He doesn't have to hide, because Cas already knows and he feels the same.
Dean licked his way across Cas' bottom lip before he let his tongue explore Cas' mouth. God he thought, Cas shouldn't be this good at kissing for how little experience he has. But all Dean is really thinking about is how much of an idiot he's been. They could have been doing this the whole time.
"Why Dean? Why does the thought that Cas cares about you scare you so much? Isn't that what you want?"
Dean breathed deeply, shaking his head, hoping to start again. “Well when you were gone, I well … I realized I can’t live without you. I need you. And all I could think of was that I didn’t, before, I couldn’t, I wasn’t able to tell you I.. I…” Dean trailed off, struggling to think over the beating of his heart
After a petty stare off that Sam lost, he sighed. "Dean, I want to make sure that you're okay. You know I don't want to pressure you into something you're not ready for. I.. Well I know that, well suspected that you've felt this way for years and I think that it would really help if you talked to him."
"I...I" He never meant to hurt him. He wished he could be around more, but Cas had his own problems with heaven and all.
"Wow god
“Cas” Dean knocked, fist rapping against Cas' door. A deep rough groan echoed from the strip under the wood and out into the hallway.
"You don't need to take time off of your work for me. I'm fine."
Dean paused, brows drawn. "But our last one was-"
Cas looked at him eyes wide and startled like he's never bothered to consider how Dean might interpret his reactions about the inferior nature of mankind. "No. Of course not Dean, you and Sam, you're the strongest people I know."
He was going to teach Cas how to defend himself the human way. He hadn't thought about it before Sam had pointed it out, but Cas only fought with his powers or with his angel blades. Now that he was human that wasn't gonna cut it. Knives are only good as a short range tool. No, Cas was going to learn to fire a gun.
Cas rolled his eyes, a short sigh escaping his lips. "Yes Dean, you were right."
"About Cas?"
He heard a muffled grunt from the other side and then an unnecessary amount of rustling.
"Sam." Dean mocked childishly.
“My grace feels weaker and different since I returned from the empty,” Cas lifted his head resting it on his hand so he could stare down at Dean, “You know this.”
"Well I thought it was just planes but maybe it's all steel metal death traps that dangle you higher than humans are meant to go."
was not a word Dean had heard many times in his life. It was never said by his father and only fell from Sam's lips in joking, mocking tones. He'd never had someone stand in front of him and proclaim it. Leave it to rest heavy, and earnest as if they had the strength to hold on to the weight of those words. As if they were fundamentally undeniably true, as true as gravity, or math, or the grass being green.
Sam's eyes softened around the corners, and his voice became soft, slow and comforting. "Dean. He's going through a lot right now. I mean becoming human, losing his powers... it's not something we could ever understand. I think we need to give him some space, some time to sort things out."
Scrunching up his eyebrows, Dean's voice was a mixture of frustration and desperation. "
Dean lifted his hand stopping Cas from voicing the thought he could see growing behind Cas' pinched brows. "Nuh uh."
“Do humans always feel this much?”
Five days. It's been five days since .... since. Dean violently pulled open the fridge uncapping a beer throwing the cap over his shoulder, shrugging when he heard it echo on the ground instead of the counter.
“No, I'm a selfish asshole. I’m horrible about talking about how I feel. I only seem to cause people issues. I've never been able to hold down a real relationship, no matter how hard I’ve tried. I can’t be honest about how I feel. And the second I try people don’t want me anymore. I have no idea what I’m doing and I only seem to drag people down with me.”
"What's happening?" Cas asked as he dragged his feet into the kitchen, sweatpants dangling past his ankles dragging on the floor, shoulders slumped forward, small bags below his eyes.
"But-"
"Okay" Dean spoke in a low and calming tone as he moved to stand behind Cas. "Now you're going to lift the gun line up and look through here." Dean pointed over Cas’ shoulder to the eye piece.
Cas sat up and placed his hand lightly over Dean's. “That’s not true Dean. You have plenty of admiral qualities people desire.”
Rubbing his hand down his face he sighed pulling Cas arm off his back and rising from the coach, shivering from the sudden cold of the air. Turning to leave he froze, staring back at Cas' sleeping face where a small pile of drooling was collecting in the corner of his mouth, his hair somehow even messier than normal, if that was even possible.
Crossing his arms over his chest and lifting his hunting boots one over the other to rest on the table, Dean groaned for an unreasonably long time. "Fine I'll try, but only if Cas actually tries to listen to me and lets me finish what I'm saying."
"Okay pleasant." Dean nodded. "I can work with that but," Turning around so that he was walking backwards, his arms stretched either side, "by the end of the night I will get you to admit that not only was the time 'pleasant', but that you actually had fun."
"Okay." Dean said, voice quiet and oddly distant as if his words were echoing back from far away.a
"Hey, no need to thank me," Dean waved his hand nonchalantly through the air, stupid smirk pulling at his lips, "I take cash and for therapy I charge twenty dollars an hour"
Dean hadn’t expected him to show up at his door, with Apple Pie of all things, offering his help.
"It's not that," he shook his head. The words 'I can't swallow it' were sitting on his tongue, but they wouldn't come out.
He makes up for that in other ways.
Cas was so stupid!
Just like a lullaby, the heartbeat was fast in the start.
"Dean!" He finally said, and his hands on Dean's chest tightened.
He had been doing this activity for the past half an hour now, and by the looks of it, he wasn’t going to stop.
He was still ticklish on the sides.
The angel?
“Classes,” Dean told him.
“You know what?” he was still standing, “You’re right. I’ll go get something sharp to open these.”
“Discord; Oxy, oml, I could learn to cook, that would be so cute.
"Now, hold your fist like this," Cas held up his fist with his thumb pressed under his fingers, "and press on your chin, and this turns off the gag reflex."
“What gave it away?” he followed her to the other end of the kitchen.
Either way, he didn’t lose the view of the blue in front of him.
But he had cut the body off, so it couldn't be it.
There they were, under the player that was paused somewhere in the middle of Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! on loop, the notifications.
Swaying casually to a Taylor Swift song playing on the radio, he bought the cup to the table, and set it down by the breakfast.
Dean checked his knees and palms, which thankfully hadn't scratched.
“Fuck,” Cas hissed, and stepped closer to Dean.
Then the silence fell.
Wow Cas, very subtle.
The thought of that was what did it for him.
And so he did. He didn’t know what came over him— what little alcohol he had consumed, or the state of Zen he was in—but he reached up and held Cas’ face in his hands. That drew Cas’ attention back onto him, and his fingers stopped. Slowly, Dean pressed his nails onto Cas’s cheeks, and dragged his fingers down to his jaw. It did make the scratchy sound.
He didn’t plan on having to wash clothes just yet.
Cas shuddered at that.
“Very,” he said, bringing his face close enough for Dean to be able to see himself in Cas’ dark eyes.
There was no one to save him.
They started with the kitchen, which, Cas found, was just opposite to his own. Cas was ashamed of it, but he laughed each time Dean took five minutes to decide where to put the jars, and were to put the plates.
Cas would never open his eyes again. He was gone.
The phone buzzed twice.
He shook him so hard that the strap of the bag came off.
“It’s alright,” he nodded and scooted over to let Dean sit. Otherwise he’d have to sit on the boxes or the-
It was enough to make him light headed.
So he texted Cas.
“Where?” he asked, but he was already standing.
He was afraid that he would suggest something wrong and then Dean wouldn’t like it. So, he had to be very careful with what he proposed.
“Get up,” Cas told him.
"Wow." Was all he could say.
Cas thought about that for a moment, and then came to one conclusion.
“I couldn’t take it anymore,” he said, pulling the phone out for the umpteenth time today knowing he will chuck it back in again.
He saw his own reflection in Cas’ eyes. It was beautiful.
So he actually did not know that there were that many people downstairs. He was up here, chilling in his room in red pajama bottoms and a t-shirt while Meg screamed at people downstairs.
Cas laughed at that.
The person wouldn't let him do that.
“Uh,” Dean smiled awkwardly, and stepped back to show him boxes that were still sitting in the foyer, “Not exactly.”
“I am really sorry,” Dean was laughing, seemingly more at himself.
“One more,” Cas said, and this time he tilted his head so that it was resting on Dean’s head.
Then it was gone.
Finally, Cas pushed the phone back towards him, with a tiny nod.
He randomly walks into the room, grabs my hand, and if I am sitting pulls me up to the middle of the room, and gives me a spin as if we are at a ball, and then just let’s go of my fingers and leaves just as he had come in.
“Okay,” He nodded, and Cas looked up at him to see the dimples on his cheeks. They looked really good on his smile. Cas wanted to reach up and touch them, see if they were really as deep as they looked like.
And here he was, looking at him with eyes so soft, Dean wanted to lay down in them and sleep, and then never wake up.
Good. And then he’s offer him the…
"Huh?" Cas raised his brow and again and from this angle, it looked very different than it did before.
He liked it a lot, he thought. In the end, the Meg Masters’ Party didn’t really suck after all.
“Yeah. Mom and little bro.”
“What if he is? You’d never know until you go and ask!”
“Cas,” Dean had placed a flower from the bunch on Cas’ ear, “Your eyes are the color of forget-me-nots.”
It was an average boring ceiling—a typical college café ceiling. Dean counted twenty cracks—one of them looked like a car—while Castiel gently wiped under his eyes.
Neither Dean nor the guy waited for Dean to respond to where the strings were.
The people in a six feet radius turned to see what had happened.
Did that mean he loved Dean too? or did that mean Dean was a thing?
Castiel took a sip.
There was a very small list of people Dean actually flirted with on the daily, and Meg made the top three. Above her were only Jo and Ash. Meg only had two classes with Dean in a week, and in each of them she greeted him by throwing her arms around him and a ‘Hey, girlfriend!’ That had started when they had met in GSA, and that was start of college.
Then immediately regretted afterwards.
He let the feeling sink in a little deeper.
"Dean?"
“I’m so glad you’re here.” Cas nuzzled his neck.
Both of them didn’t get up.
So he let his eye lids fall. He didn't want to keep Cas up all night.
“Don’t make me cram stuff,” he looked at him, and Cas’s heart flipped again.
Whatever.
“I’ll see that box,” Cas excused himself from the awkwardness.
Dean watched him open the bottle and take a pill out.
He was just Cas. Just Castiel Novak, saved ‘Angel’ in his phone.
Dean sat up on the bed, faster than he thought he could. He was pretty sure that came off as too eager, but that didn’t matter because there wasn’t an announce of lies there. Dean really wanted to kiss Cas upright.
“There,” Cas finally removed his hands, and put them in his lap, “now you look pretty again.”
“Yeah, I was.” Dean laughed, and resumed putting things on the shelves.
Dean’s fingers brushed against his skin and Cas could swear that the lights in the room flickered. Cas’s breath hitched as dean trailed his finger gently down his cheek to his cheek bone. His heart threatened to beat out of his chest, and he felt like he was about to faint. All he could see was a deep glimmering forest green; as captivating as a siren’s cry.
“So,” Cas heard a chair being dragged, and Dean’s bag being dropped onto the table. “We’re not doing much today?”
At least he hoped.
Two hands wrapped around his bicep to pull him up.
Today was a great day.
Dean saw stars at the end of his vision as his body convulsed uncontrollably. This definitely made the list of best orgasms that he had had. He most definitely wanted to do it again.
“No,” She nodded, “I’m here for you.”
Now that he was away, there was nothing that could wake him up without his will. There were no obligations to attend to. No people to constantly be at guard around. He could rest now.
He thought Dean was pretty.
Yep, tutoring Dean Winchester was going to be the end of him.
Huh, he thought, seeing that it was Ellen through the peeping hole, looking all excited.
He took a sip from the bottle, and then pressed it to his head on his way back to the living room.
Cas kissed Dean gently again, this time reaching for his sweatshirt, and pulling it over Dean’s head. The cool air caused goosebumps to form on his skin.
Cas looked over to Dean who nodded encouragingly, “I know they are not
Cas looked down at himself. “I suppose this is a more aesthetically pleasing vessel.”
Dean waited in the heavy silence of the night only interrupted by his harsh breaths. He layed back down staring at his ceiling, thinking. When his breaths evened out and he could no longer hear the blood rushing to his ears and he was left abandoned in the empty dark silence of the night, he pushed himself off his bed. He didn’t want to be alone. He was sick of being alone of pulling himself back. God he’d almost told Cas how he felt so many times and yet he always backed away at the last possible second. He was sick of hiding, of running.
"Cas." He chocked on the word barring his face into Cas' neck. He knew he was crying, but he didn't care. All that mattered was that Cas was breathing and real and alive and in front of him. He wasn't sure how long he held desperately onto Cas or maybe it was Cas who was crushing him there, not that he thought he was trapped he wanted to be there, to stay like this.
Tugging on Cas’ sleeve, Dean laughed. “Come here.”
Dean turned to look over at Cas’ who’s smiling proudly at Jack. After seeing Cas’ smiling, Dean can’t help but smile himself. “Happiest I’ve been in a long time.”
Cas’ voice teetered like a seesaw left too long in the air. His lips curled upward, eyes widened even as moisture pooled at their sides. "Thank you, Dean."
that you truly think that. I’m working on it.” Cas' voice faded, as he turned his head to the side as if gazing through a portal to some unknowable future. “It will take time, is all.”
Dean stared at the floor, watching his foot drag along the carpet. "It's not worth the risk. Just stay here, for me. You don't know enough about defending yourself. It's not a strong lead anyway. You can come on the next one. Okay?" Turning towards the door, shoulders slumping with exhaustion, Dean whispered, words barely carrying over his shoulder. "Besides, we could use you here for research."
"Well I'm... thanks for you," Dean stared down at his hands watching as his thumb rubbed circles into his palm, "know, helping me calm down."
Normally, Dean would have pushed Cas away with a “no chick flick moments.” But he doesn’t, he leans closer to Cas burrowing his head into his neck and lets himself cry. He wondered briefly what his dad would think of him now. How pathetic he’s being leaning on someone crying when nothing even happened. But then he thinks of Sam and knows that it doesn’t matter what his dad would think, because Sam would be proud that he was letting himself feel, that he was crying instead of turning his sadness into anger. He was accepting comfort from others rather than hiding behind violence.
“Don't tell me about that, even the thought is making me want to hurl. You know we've been to actual hell, I think that's enough. You don't have to go through creating your own. We have enough problems to deal with as it is.”
Dean had thanked him for helping him out, and bringing him pie. He even lent Cas a foldable umbrella.
“What the hell??” Meg frowned, and then yelled, “PUT MY PLAYLIST BACK ON!!!!”
Dean looked back at him, popping another dry fry into his mouth.
A smile spread on his lips like a rainbow during light rain.
“I’m sorry,” he said more to the phone than to Cas.
Dean didn’t have words to tell Cad that he wished that it did get bruised.
He didn’t need to conform that, so he just took his phone and threw it back into the bag, and zipped it up. He knew he would do that.
“You can call me Cas,” he said louder this time, “if Castiel is too long—”
Yeah, he definitely didn’t want to break out of it.
He wasn’t going to let that happen. There wasn’t anything out there waiting for him. His house would go to his brother. His car would too. He never had a mother or a father who would grieve for him. He didn’t have friends in a true sense either. He no longer had the shitty job he used to wake up for every day. He didn’t have a pet that needed caring. There was no one he needed to pay a debt to.
He shouldn’t be doing this.
Everything had happened… everything had changed for him, and he loved it.
Maybe Cas thought that he was asleep?
“Because,” Ellen pushed off the counter, and came to sit in the chair next to him, “It’s been three months and two days since valentine’s day, and I haven’t seen that British guy come back here to meet you.”
He didn’t have to say anything at all to Cas. Ever.
He had thought of Sammy, but he was in school right now. He thought of Jo, but she was doing her volunteer work. He thought of Bobby, but he would be under some car, doing his tinkering work with it. He thought of Benny, but they had only hanged out once, was he even interested in talking to Dean? He thought of Mom—heck, he thought of Dad, but he wasn’t a kid. Besides, who went to their parents with problems anymore? Six year olds?
Dean nodded. He wanted very bad to feel Cas’ mouth against his again.
The problem was that Cas was as gay as a moth was for a flame. He had watched Dean—whenever he was present—casually stroll into the classes the two had in common, and had found himself staring at his every move, until the bell rung and he got up, once again walking to the door like he was in a park. The guy scribbled notes, and Cas itched to pass by him to see what he was writing. When the teachers asked Dean any questions, Cas would drop whatever he was doing to listen to what he had to say.
“See you around.” Ellen nodded, and saw herself out.
His eyes rolled back into his skull at the sensation and he felt Cas’ grin.
He mentally face-palmed.
Dean was right behind him. Good.
"Son of a bitch!" He looked at Cas, who was grinning.
“Huh?”
Castiel frowned, and turned the radio off on his way to the door.
Turning on his side, Cas smiled and even if it felt like its brightness was burning Dean, he couldn’t look away. “You’re a great person too, Dean.”
Sam clears his throat, "I'm going to try and get some sleep."
He rasped struggling to breathe through fire and ice. He did not need to breathe, at least he never had before, but his hands reached upwards clinging to his neck clawing at his skin almost like he was trying to dig an alternate route for the air to enter.
He was screaming howling desperately to the world and yet no sound echoed through the air.
Lifting both hands as if in surrender, Dean turned to face Cas, mock smile pulling his lips. “
"Dean, we both know this isn't healthy for you. Why don't you try talking about it just to see if it helps.  If you say it doesn't I'll leave you alone. I just want you to try."
The ringing startled Dean mid sentence, ending his rant about Jack. Careful to steady the wheel in one hand, Dean used the other to grab his phone, bringing it to his ear.
because Cas is - why would… What?
Shaking Cas' body violently he couldn't stop the bitter desperate flow of his words. "Cas how could you have been so god damn stupid. Going after Lucifer by yourself. Don't you know that your worth too much to go running around sacrifing yourself? Didn't I show you were worth more than the death of any creature, even if it's the literal devil?" Heaving struggling to breath he almost fell over crushing Cas. Feeling guilty and rather sick with himself for his treatment of Cas he didn't deserved to be yelled at and shaken, not when the person he was really angry at was himself and Lucifer he wrapped his arms back around Cas cradling him against his chest like he was simply a frightened child that needed comforting. "Why aren't you back yet, you've come back before? What's different this time? Why haven't you come back yet?"
, in a way a soldier should never be. Terrified of the inevitable landing. One can only stay in the air for so long, before they must crash onto the earth.
"Not about how I feel."
… she looked so surprised."
Cas nodded delicately placing the tape into the cassette player.
. I would know what questions to ask."
He walked as fast as he could down the familiar path to Cas’ room, hoping to arrive before his doubts could rush up and catch him. Lifting his hand to the door he hesitated pulling his arm back. No, he thought. You’re doing this. You can’t back out, not again.
"What, spend time in museums?" Cas tilted his head, words falling from his lips unusually slow. "I didn’t think you liked museums."
Dean pulled off his shoes, laying on the arms crossed behind his head with a satisfied huff. Peaking one freshly mowed grass green eye open he squinted up at Cas. "Come on.
"Dean." Sam said.
Dean suppressed a laugh at the sight of Cas' full force glare. He lifted his hands in surrender. "Okay, Okay. I get it that's not the point."
Pushing himself up with his palms, Dean pulled out a couple of rest stop sandwiches and kettle cooked salt and vinegar chips.
He lifted his hands, knocking quietly on the door.
"Cas." He slurred borderline delirious, beer splashing unnaturally loud in the heavy unrelenting silence.
Dean hasn't been back in his room except to shower and change clothes in two days, instead choosing to spend time in Cas's.
Dropping his arms stiffly, like the un-oiled joints of a doll, Cas steps away from the wall. “I'm sorry. I shouldn't have. I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable. I should,” He turns, feet facing the door.
He felt compelled to explain to Cas why he reacted the way he had, the fear he’d felt when the girl stood over him blade glinting in the dark.
“No.”
He was always in trouble when he was young for looking upwards, for flying higher than he needed, hoping to feel the rush of the air, to see the world below.
Cas stares at Dean whose eyes are closed, glossed smile on his face, at the arm he's thrown over Cas' side and the steady rise and fall of his chest.
Quietly Sam sat beside his brother, Dean wasn't sure how he had found him.
anymore so." Dean pulled his arm to chest as if he was the one who needed protection from himself. He hadn’t meant to say that. At least not in those blunt biting words. He knew Cas was sensitive about it, who wouldn’t be, but it had slipped out and Dean was once again the reason someone got hurt. He hadn’t meant to. But that didn’t mean he could pretend he didn’t see the hurt in Cas’ eyes or the way his shoulders dropped and his arms wrapped around himself as if he was trying to shrink to draw himself away from his new human body.
Dean shrugged, “not particularly. Now come on” Stepping away from the pan Dean turned towards Cas, brandishing his hand out in front of him. Cas stared at it, head tilted to his side.
"So, where did you go?" asked Sam.
“Yeah. It’s been...nice. It’s sad we never had the time before this. Which gives me an idea.”
“Yeah…” Dean's voice was rough and gravely as he shook his head attempting to clear his thoughts. “I’m fine… Everything’s fine.”
Dean laughed causing Cas’ body to lift with him. “I thought angels didn’t sleep?”
Dean froze, waiting several seconds for Cas’ face to relax and his breathing to fall back into a steady rhythm. He pushed Cas’ hair out of his eyes, fingers running across his forehead as delicately as butterflies legs ran along grass. Maybe things would turn out okay. Maybe they could make it through this. They’d managed to make it through everything else. They just had to keep moving forward together and things might work out this time.
"Metatron he took over, the angel's are falling."
." Cas whispered shakily as if the word itself held power. As if it were spoken loud enough it could be summoned into existence.
Realizing he would not be able to go back to sleep tonight anyway, he stood determined to just get this over with. He’d been dragging this thing for years and he realized now that all he really wanted was to feel a little less alone in this world.
"Let's make you an angel with a shotgun." Dean sang, causing Cas to look between the gun and Dean's smile.
"It's none of your business"
Dean smiled, glad that Cas was there, being well Cas, even if that meant he was being unreasonably grumpy and stubborn for a practically immortal being.
Reaching into his pocket, Cas pulled out two tickets stubs, the ones Dean and him had run out of time to use at the carnival. He started at their crinkled edges and where the lettering hadn't stamped correctly cutting off the ends of the words. Delicately he placed them in the corner of the box.
"Dean, I can't help you with that. We both know that this is something you have to do on your own."
"Yeah, yeah. You love me, I know."
Cas looked over at him, confusion clear in the furrow of his brows, but his face slowly softened, a wide smile growing across his face as he watched the tilt of Dean's head and the air fall from his lips.
Sam sighed. "I know what you mean, but there's not much we can do to help until we have more information. As frustrating as it is, this is the best way to help Cas."
Although, Dean refused to give up hope that there wasn't something he could do to help. Even if he was using the possibility of a case to avoid the bunker's dusty old library. Forgive him if he thought books were best when they had pictures. Sam could have all the alone time in the library with his dreary old impossible to read books.
"Cas." He breathed again a hope, a plea, an accusation.
As sad as it was, shooting practice was the closest to father son bonding he'd ever gotten with his dad. Besides it gave him a good excuse to get out of the bunker, spend some time out in the open air with actual sunlight not Sam’s stupid fake daylight lamps that are supposed to be good for mental health or some shit.
Cas tilted his head. “Depending on the situation,” Lifting his hands, Cas created an aggressive number of air quotes, “‘Unwinding’ could lead to my demise.”
"Well, why don't you try with something smaller first and lead your way up to it."
is better with music.” He picked up his phone, scrolling until he came across one of his playlist. Clicking shuffle, a heavy beat drifts through the shitty phone speakers crackling into the open air.
"I was skeptical at first, but look closely. Here." Sam pointed to a line a couple of paragraphs down the article. 'She claimed that a man approached her, asking for her permission to possess her body in order to ensure the world's safety.'
- He didn’t want to have to lose him, not like he’d had to lose so many others in his life.
Cas snorted and Dean glared in return and suddenly Dean realised that maybe they can get through this, because he no longer feels crushed by the weight of expectations.
Dean leaned forward chastely pressing his lips against Cas’. Then again, and again. He already wondered how he was going to get anything done now that he knew kissing Cas was an option. Especially because, god kissing Cas, was amazing.
“What if I make you some coffee?”
Cas was silent for several seconds. "Being human sounds complicated."
Despite the previous warning, Cas turned to look at the trees blurring passed the side of the car. "I don't think I want to."
"I'm trying to ask if you've talked to him about how you feel."
Dean whispers a quiet almost inaudible prayer. The praying started ever since, god he still couldn't bring himself to think it let alone say it like Sam wanted him to.
Cas tilted his head to the side, fingers digging absently amongst the hazel sand. “
Dean had wrapped his arm around Cas's body. He wasn't cold, not yet but he was no longer warm or comforting. Pulling him up on into his lap dean thought of the dreams he used to have, ones where Cas' head would be resting in his lap he'd wanted then, but he didn't now. It wasn't supposed to be like this. Cas was ... Cas was supposed to be... Well he wasn't supposed to be like this, limp and heavy in his arms.
Why would you? I'm not - Cas you could do so much better.”
When after several minutes of scrolling later Cas chose a nature documentary about bees, Dean was not surprised. Although he did consider stealing the remote so that they could watch something that wouldn't put him to sleep. He didn't though, when Cas started excitedly spouting facts. God, he'd missed him.
