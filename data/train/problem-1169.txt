John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck.  “Sherlock.”
John realised after awhile what it was.  Everything was too new and fragile to be talking so much about it.  If he had to do it over, he would have kept his mouth shut and waited until things had progressed and solidified before sharing.  As it was, John was feeling more and more agitated, alternating between wondering if it was even real and worried that he was going to fuck things up with Sherlock.
Sherlock turned away with a groan and started walking again, tugging John’s hand so he’d walk with him.  “Oh God, Molly.  She and Irene will be insufferable.  You know, Irene figured everything out when she realised I hadn’t had sex in months.  She kept hounding me to tell you.”  His eyes widened and he turned to look at John.  “Bloody hell, it’s because she knew how you felt.  Of course, how could I be so stupid!  I thought she was stirring the pot.”
Sherlock gave a husky laugh. “It’s true that watching you across the pitch as you pull off your rugby shirt, which you do at
John huffed out a laugh as he came further into the room.  “Yes, that’s exactly it.  You really are good at that.  Deducing people.”  He blushed, not wanting to bring up the sexuality ‘party trick.’  “I’ve seen it on your Instagram.  You seem to be able to figure people out pretty easily.”
Sherlock rolled his eyes as he parked.  “Because of The Work.  It was distracting enough being in love with you.  And the sex was
shouldn’t.”
Sherlock gave him a half smile.  “I don’t believe it’s going to be an issue for you, John, since you don’t have casual sex.  I can’t see you falling in love with an arsehole who couldn’t be trusted with…well, your arsehole.”  They both burst into laughter, and John felt some of his tension drain.
It turned out Irene wasn’t remotely surprised, given that she’d known how both men were feeling.  John chuckled fondly as he listened to them chat while he cleared up his dinner.
Sherlock pried open one eye to regard him.  “What’s that?”
John gave her an exasperated look.  “A few minutes ago you were cheering at the idea of him bending me over the table.  Now you’re saying I should continue hiding it for the sake of our friendship?”
Sherlock seemed to get increasingly agitated as well, probably annoyed that they were having to do so many takes.  He finally barked at Irene to just have Molly hand him a towel off screen, for fuck’s sake.  Molly darted off in search of one, John and Sherlock turning their backs on one another to compose themselves.
Sherlock pressed his lips together, his expression wracked with doubt.  Recalling Molly’s warnings, John knew Sherlock was about to massively overthink this.  John rocked his hips forward so that his erection pressed against Sherlock’s thigh.  “Please, Sherlock.  Don’t deny the evidence.  Don’t…don’t deny
Indeed, the door flung open before he had a chance to knock.  Sherlock’s expression was bemused.  “John?”
Sherlock’s lips curled.  “I’m not some bloody beast that needs slaking, Anderson.  Do us all a favour and have another gin and tonic so you pass out.”  He turned to John, and once more his eyes flicked up and down.  He seemed contemplative for a moment before finally looking John in the eyes, his features and tone of voice perfectly bland as he said, “Welcome to Knight’s, Captain Watson.  If you’ll excuse me.”
.”  He blinked several times.  “This can’t be what you want,” he whispered.
John stopped in his tracks and looked over at Sherlock, whose expression was vulnerable in a way he’d never seen.  “You…you want to have sex with me again?”
, John fiercely told himself, maybe he’d always been attracted to John, but his dedication to his work meant that he preferred to take care if it alone.  There was no guarantee that if John propositioned him again more recently, he would have gotten a different answer.
Molly huffed.  “You can’t take yourself out of the equation, John!
.  What the hell was he going to do?  John looked around the little suburban home he shared with Mary.  She was out with her friend Janine.  His normal fiancé out doing normal things with her normal friends while he sat in their normal home quietly going out of his mind with longing to go back to Baker street.  Back to Sherlock.
John felt a twitch of frustration.  “What the hell does that mean?”
Sherlock broke their kiss to groan, “Christ, I want nothing more than to bury myself in your arse right now.”
.  Someone who is that determined to think they’re unloveable might react badly to being told otherwise.  In such a case, maybe it’s best to leave him to it.”
When Sherlock’s shirt was off and tossed over a chair, he stepped towards John.  John decided to continue teasing him, as it seemed to be working so far.  He stepped out of Sherlock’s reach, inching back towards the bed, working the zipper of his jeans down as he did so.  John bit his lip, gazing mischievously at Sherlock.  Sherlock stared back at him, his eyes gleaming his approval.
John blinked.  “Me?  You want
Sherlock’s eyes followed his progress, darkening as John’s fingers teased at the button to his jeans.  His nostrils flared when John deftly pulled the button out of the loop and then moved his hand down to grasp the zipper pull.  But he went no further, waiting.  Sherlock’s eyes came up to gaze at him in question, and John flicked his own eyes to Sherlock’s shirt, the buttons of which were straining to keep in place.
John knew a little bit about Irene’s process from the handful of blooper videos she posted.  For instance, he knew that there were often multiple takes, especially if an error was made.  The same moments were often shot from different angles.  Some of those angles were rather intrusive.  It wasn’t something that John had ever thought about much until he was participating in these activities.  He wouldn’t really mind if it weren’t for the fact that it involved being in close proximity to Sherlock for endless periods of time.
Irene looked thoughtful.  “Well, for one thing, I noticed you watching at that video more than once.  Quite intently.  Are you telling me you didn’t feel sexual attraction for Sherlock?”
John chuckled.  “I did indeed, and I’m more than a little surprised that you would bring it up. You tend to reject all offers of food.”  Sherlock looked down at the blanket, his cheeks growing red as he fidgeted with the edge of it.  John tilted his head.  “You like the idea of me doting on you, is that it?”
well. I knew you were capable of so much more than what you were showing the world. But I don’t always trust my judgement.  Especially with how I’ve been hurt before.”
Sherlock lifted his chin, his expression solemn.  “Only John.”
Sherlock groaned and slid down under the duvet, pulling it over his head.  Clearly he was embarrassed by all the sentimentality.  John dived under the covers after him.  In the dim light he could see Sherlock had his eyes shut and his face scrunched up.  John giggled and gave him a kiss on the cheek.  “I agree, breakfast can wait.  I know of something else I want to devour first.”
Sherlock looked up from where he was selecting a handful of ingredients.  His brow wrinkled and he opened his mouth and then closed it.  Shaking his head, he finally spoke.  “If you ever need help again, you can always text me.”  He fished out his mobile and held it up.
god, please, Sherlock!”
John couldn’t fight the smile that spread across his face.  “Yeah, we were both wound pretty tightly.  So…we finally did something about it.”  He raised his eyebrows significantly.
Irene folded her arms.  “I know what happened with you, but you were kids!  It’s practically a rite of passage for boys to be rejected by a lesbian.  Whatever else has happened to John, he refuses to say.”  She gave him a significant look.
Irene waved her hand.  “Oh, they’re already following me.  Sally’s dating Greg Lestrade, and Sherlock’s slept with practically everyone else.”
“You’re putting it in the wrong order.”  John turned around and saw Sherlock standing there.
John sighed, knowing it was a waste of time to deflect.  “It’s nothing.  Just a bit weird sometimes.  I feel like I’m in the presence of a celebrity or something.  But like, the way I see you isn’t the same as how they see you and it’s…jarring I guess.”
John’s lips curved into a smile as he caught on.  He took Sherlock’s hand.  “I’m John Watson.”
John nodded. “And move back in here, if you’ll have me.”
Sherlock’s lips quirked.  “Because it’s the greater compliment.”
John tugged Sherlock forward, wanting to feel his lips again.  They kissed and kissed, and then John pulled back to stare down at the magical things Sherlock was doing to his cock.  He could also see where Sherlock’s was straining against his sweatpants, and prickling heat washed over him at the thought of Sherlock
Sherlock chuckled.  “Lavender is better.  I can dry them and the scent will last a long time.  Thank you, John.”  He finally reached out to accept the flowers.
Molly bit her lip.  “But she likes to be the one to…”  She stopped abruptly and put her hand on her mouth.  John wouldn’t have thought it possible for her to turn even redder, but she did.
“Do I get sex, now?”
In the weeks following Sherlock’s inexplicable suicide, John found it much harder to cope than he would have expected.  He hadn’t realized that his feelings ran that deeply.  The discovery of the secret box made it much, much worse.
Curiosity propelled him out of his chair and into Sherlock’s room.  Once inside, he took a moment to breathe deeply, in and out.  This had been Sherlock’s personal space, the part of him that wasn’t taken over by cases or experiments.  John had once imagined that it would be just as stacked full of books and petri dishes as the rest of the flat. But it was actually quite tidy.
John shrugged one shoulder.  “Yeah, I can tell you what it’s like for me.  Not all demis are the same, though, from what I’ve read.  What do you want to know?”
Unlike Irene’s choreography, which used contemporary music and mixed contemporary dance into the ballet, the recital was more traditional.  John recognised a song by Rachmaninoff that Sherlock was playing on his violin earlier in the week in his Instagram story.
John’s lips slowly curved into a grin.  Sherlock would never stop being amazing and adorable at the same time.  “Well, I’ll just have to see what I can do, love.”  He leaned up for a soft kiss.
After I wrote Sherlock’s recital solo, someone shared this video with me, which I found delightful because it perfectly conveys what I was going for (and he looks like Sherlock):  https://youtu.be/myUXoDac7h4
John shook his head.  “For a genius, you’re rather thick sometimes.  Does this seem like pity to you?”  He pointed down to where his sweatpants did nothing to hide his erection.
John approached the door to the flat, his fingers rhythmically curling into a fist and then uncurling as he attempted to calm himself.  He honestly didn’t understand why he was feeling trepidation.  This was Molly, his best friend from secondary school.  They’ve been keeping in frequent touch the past two years he was in Edinburgh, though admittedly it was a different sort of closeness than what existed when they saw each other every day.
Sherlock was back to fidgeting with the blanket.  “I’d like to…you know.”
Holmes shrugged.  “That’s because it is easy.  I just look at what they post on their own profiles.  They make their lives an open book.”  His gaze sharpened.  “You’ve been looking at my Instagram?”
John still left the parties early whenever some fit bloke started to chat Sherlock up.  And if the subject of Sherlock came up at rugby, John slid out of the room as unobtrusively as possible.
Sherlock swallowed.  “It’s fine, I’ve replaced everything.”
John blushed.  “Well, I follow Irene because she threatened me with bodily harm if I didn’t.”  The other man chuckled in that deep throaty tone of his.  It was contagious, and John laughed as well, easing a bit.  “Whenever I see you making snarky comments I usually end up on your profile to peruse a bit.  I like the chemistry and forensics stuff.”
Sherlock stood abruptly and grabbed his coat.  “Well, I think I’ve taken up enough of your time.  You have an assignment to finish and my experiment can wait till tomorrow.  Laterz!” He swirled on the coat and left the room before John could say another word.
John had hoped that prepping for the party would occupy Molly too fully to continue the subject, but it turned out to be the opposite.  Molly was quite able to keep up an endless stream of chatter as they set out snacks, booze, rearranged furniture, etc.  John was trapped into the whole ordeal by his sense of duty to his flatmate and friend.  He wasn’t sure why he was hating this.  Usually he loved nothing more than to share such things with her.
Just not as much of one.”
John felt a little on edge when he showed up to Lestrade’s flat.  He wasn’t much of a partier, he tended to prefer smaller casual get-togethers.  Most of the time parties devolved into a hunting ground, with people hoping to find someone to hook up with before the night ended.  John enjoyed chatting and drinking and even dancing. Not so much the drunken come-ons.  Often they would get confused that he was turning them down, since he was a bloke and must therefore always be up for a shag.  There was more than one party at Loudain that ended on a sour note.
Sherlock waved his hand.  “Oh John, the way I see it, if I hurt you I deserve to get beat up.  It’s only fair.  I’m more apprehensive about the talk you’ll eventually get from my brother.  That’s not a threat you want to take lightly.”
Irene seemed to ignore him, lost in thought.  “Trying to remember the last bloke you shagged.  Wasn’t it that new player on the football team?  Freddie?  When did he start?”
big deal in London right now, and they called to ask me to come in for an interview.  I met with them earlier today, and…”  Irene took a deep breath.  “They’re interested in possibly hiring me for their team.”
John looked up at the ceiling and groaned.  He didn’t know what to think.  Lifting his head back up, he took a deep breath.  “Right, here’s what I’m going to do.  I’m going to continue not saying anything to Sherlock, because Irene is right – our friendship is important to Sherlock, and it’s important to me.  I don’t want to burden him with all these feelings he doesn’t want if there’s a chance he won’t even notice.
Sherlock’s hands slid down his back until he was grasping his arse, and John let out a whimper against Sherlock’s lips.  The whimper turned into a squeak when Sherlock’s hands lowered to his thighs, and then John was being lifted and pinned as Sherlock slotted himself between his legs.  Christ almighty, that was smooth as
John burst into giggles, shaking his head.  “Why do I somehow find that more flattering than if you’d propositioned me for sex?”
Irene’s expression cleared.  “Ohhh, right.  I forgot.  John’s a virgin.”
Irene rolled her eyes.  “We’re not going for realism here.  Glistening skin is sexier.  Molly, the bottle’s right over there next to Sherlock.”
He’d always had friends, always been sociable, but no one ever seemed interested in
wrong about dear Sherlock.”
Molly bit her lip.  “And you know that how?”
Irene gave him a mischievous smile.  “Don’t forget to bring a bouquet of flowers with you.”
Sherlock’s expression morphed into something more genuine and he cleared his throat.  “In fact, I have a little something for you.  Consider it a hostess gift.”  He pulled a small envelope out of his jacket pocket and handed it to her.  John recognised the logo of the shop Sherlock mentioned earlier.  Molly’s eyes widened when she saw it, and she quickly turned beet red.  “My only caveat to this gift is that whatever is purchased with the card,
John raised his eyebrows.  “Oh?  What’s this about, Molls?”
Sherlock’s expression cleared.  “Ah, your mates were talking about me again.  Let me guess…Dimmock.  He’s not been fucked in ages.  He always gives me puppy dog eyes when he’s horny.”
John settled down into his new bed, enjoying the feel of the fresh sheets.  First night in his new home.  He heard his mobile chime and saw it was a notification from Instagram.  His mate Bill Murray replied to his comment on Bill’s post, which was a picture of rugby gear that had the caption, ‘Get ready.’  Their first team training was tomorrow, and John was definitely ready for a fresh start.
Sherlock nodded slowly.  “Yes, I know.  The new Captain of the rugby team.  I was there at the first match.  You’re
Greg’s brow furrowed.  “Because it
John laughed shakily.  “Quite right.  I’ve had to perform that stretch on my teammates more times than I can count.”  And it never unnerved him as much as it did just now, he reluctantly admitted to himself.  “Anyway, that just proved my point.  No need to rush here like you did.  Do a proper cool down.  Eat a banana.  You’re no good to me sprawled on the floor, you know.”
Irene smirked.  “Fine, but make sure to soak his hair so that water dribbles down, it’s more erotic.”
They both giggled, and Sherlock carefully rose from the floor, waving away John’s offered hand.  “Alright then, let’s see what Stevens has botched in his lecture this time.”  John studiously avoided the way that Sherlock’s sweatshirt slipped over one shoulder as he talked.
They settled on a striped jumper that was a bit nicer than the others.  It had a soft, touchable material and was in a shade that brought out the colour of his eyes.  She also recommended a pair of jeans that still looked practically new because he hardly ever wore them – the reason being that they were a bit tight.  Molly gave him a look when he complained about the snug fit, and when the penny dropped they both giggled hysterically.
Mike Stamford piped up.  “I’m still alive and well, thanks, but I wouldn’t mind passing the torch to John.  The only reason you lot voted me Captain last year is because you thought I’d be a pushover.  And you were right.”
One lazy Sunday, John was lounging in his room with tea and toast when his mobile chimed.  Irene had posted a video of Sherlock, and as usual John was unable to resist watching it.  Except this time…this time Irene had gone too far.  How had she
Irene looked the picture of innocence.  “You were able to do it with Sally.”
Irene hummed skeptically.  “Well, it’s true in Sherlock’s case.  He’s utter shite at dancing the day after sex.  But for months now he’s been at peak performance.  When
John knew he should feel relieved that Holmes backed off, but a part of him felt frustrated.  He didn’t want to sleep with the guy, but it would have been nice to get to know him a bit.  His Instagram really was fascinating.
“Yes, Sherlock Holmes.  He was in the same ballet course where Molly and I met.  He and Molly and another dancer, Sally Donovan, are quite gracious to participate in my videos.  It’s been a lot of fun, but as I said, it’s more than just fun for me.  I want to be a choreographer.”
Somehow the feeling of Sherlock’s weight on him was more erotic than when they’d been sitting flush against each other earlier in the afternoon.  The heat of Sherlock’s body was more evident, the velvet skin of his torso sliding against John’s making his adrenaline soar.  Then there was the sensation of Sherlock’s cock rubbing against his every time he moved his hips.  This was already so much better than what they did earlier.
Molly popped up next to Sherlock just then.  “Hello you two.  And how are things?”  Her smile was full of delight.
In fact, the purpose of the rainbow colours seemed clear after a moment.  For once the pairings weren’t exclusively male and female, it was a mix.  But as was noted before, all eyes eventually fell on Sherlock. The theme of the dancing seemed to be that he did not favour any of them.  He danced with any partner who approached him, but otherwise remained aloof, watching the others.  Eventually, everyone left in pairs or groups, leaving Sherlock alone.  He performed one last dance, his movements giving off the impression that he loved the freedom and flexibility of dancing by himself.
John chanced a look at Irene, who gave him a significant look and then shook her head in exasperation.  He turned away and concentrated on knotting the towel firmly again, relieved that he would no longer have to endure the torture of Sherlock’s hand or thigh brushing against him over and over.
“Because one was a man and the other was a woman. It confirmed your suspicion that you’re bisexual.  In both cases you were turned down.”
…it’s all fine.  But we’re ditching the party early. I’ll just have to promise Molly I’ll do all the cleanup in the morning.”
Once everything was inside, John went to find a spot for his car, which took quite awhile.  When he came back, Molly and Irene were on the sofa, giggling at something on a mobile screen.  Irene looked smug, and Molly had her hand over her mouth.  He could hear that song by Lizzo playing.
The jealousy, though – that wasn’t as easily dismissed.  Every single person Sherlock danced with had John squirming in his seat - especially the three men.  Had he slept with any of them?  The way he moved with them, touched them, the look of intensity on his face…John knew it was an act, but how could they resist him? They were all good-looking blokes.  Sherlock didn’t only go for rugby players, surely he must fancy dancers…as fit as they were.  John felt an odd flush of dismay and arousal at the last bloke, who kept touching Sherlock over and over.  And Sherlock was starting to sweat from the exertion of the dance.  None of it was sexual, but John had that same reaction nonetheless.
Fan art of our two boys as the Grease characters:
Sherlock let go of his cock to stroke his hand up John’s flank.  “You have me, John.  I’m here.  I promise I’ll make it good for you.”  He maneuvered over John until he was resting between his thighs, grabbing the bottle of lube and applying a generous amount to his cock.  He lowered his hips, sliding his cock along John’s.  “Fuck, I can’t believe this is happening.  This is so different, John.  It’s nothing like with anyone else.  I feel like…”  He shook his head as if he couldn’t put it into words.
He threw back the covers and started to get out of bed, but Sherlock’s hand on his arm made him pause.  Sherlock bit his lip.  “Do you think you could wait until after to make breakfast?”
But seven months on, the hurt has started to fade and he was once again experiencing the wonderful energy and fulfillment that spending time with Sherlock gave him.  The prospect of a life of “normalcy” was becoming more and more unpalatable.  But John hasn’t known what to do with these intrusive thoughts, especially since Mary and Sherlock were going full speed ahead making such elaborate plans for the commencement of the “normal” part of his life.  Sherlock, who once gleefully sabotaged all his romantic relationships, was now determined to offer him up on a silver platter.
Anderson sneered.  “Oh come on, I thought you’d appreciate some fresh meat.” He snorted with laughter and John jerked away from the hand still on his shoulder, debating whether to punch Anderson in his stupid face or storm off.
John snorted.  “Git.  I appreciate it.  But next time, no need to hurry over here on my account.”
They saw each other all the time now, not just in the lab or at parties.  They had meals together.  John introduced Sherlock to the delights of Bond movies.  He tried to resist being utterly charmed by Sherlock’s running commentary on the absurdity of it all.  It was moments like those that John didn’t even think about sex – he just wanted to wrap his arms around Sherlock and tell him how much he desperately loved him.
(See the end of the chapter for
John held up a hand.  “Yes, but you don’t have to worry about my heart.  We’re together now.  Romantically.”
Sherlock scowled.  “So, you’re giving them to me out of
John swallowed the wrong way and suffered a coughing fit for a minute.  “Where the hell did that come from?  Just because I feel sorry for the guy?”
John started to make a half-hearted protest, but realised she was right.  “Okay I get it.  You don’t want
John made a cutting gesture.  “No!  Stop feeling sorry for me, there’s no point.  Look, I’m not pretending like I don’t want more.  But I think I can be fine with just sex.  And as you say, it will be…
Sherlock abruptly stood up.  “I’m going to get a drink.”  He strode off.  Irene’s eyes widened and she shot up, taking off after him.
John let out a happy sigh.  “Sherlock, hearing you say these things…it means everything to me.  I can hardly believe it’s happening.”  He leaned up and captured Sherlock’s lips.  “You say you want things with me.  I want things, too.  And I don’t want to scare you, but I feel like we should stop hiding and just lay it all out there.  As you said…I
Greg glared.  “It’s a bit more than talking.  Saturday night you were standing close to her, touching her, gave her a hug on three separate occasions. She was trying to be polite, but it was getting weird.”
Sherlock growled against his lips and pressed him against the wall, kissing him and kissing him until a wolf whistle that could only be from Irene broke them apart.  John adjusted himself in his tight jeans, groaning in frustration.  The party had started, in more ways than one.
John had been sitting in his chair, numbly sipping tea, when he heard a shocked, “Oh!” coming from Sherlock’s bedroom.  Mrs. Hudson had been in there looking for some documents that she needed, having been unable to locate them in the more typical areas around Sherlock’s desk.  John had felt a bit guilty for letting her conduct the search on her own, but going through Sherlock’s things felt like more than he could handle.
are the one I care about!  I don’t want to see you hurt again.”
wanted it, but was giving up.  Maybe Mary was wrong about Sherlock being scared.  Maybe he was grieving what might have been by burying his feelings in serviettes and place settings.
Molly gave him a startled look.  “You really think Sherlock can reciprocate your feelings?”
Sherlock gave him a tight smile.  “Maybe, but that just makes us two of a kind.  I can hardly fault Victor for his opinion when I’ve had the same feeling about everyone I’ve fucked since then.  Though I suppose there is one difference between us.  I always make it clear
Sherlock’s eyes widened.  “I…I...d-don’t think this is appropriate.  For god’s sake, John, I’m helping to plan your wedding.”
John shook his head.  “But your face, though.”
More than two years later, John had long forgotten about his discovery…until he posted his blog entry “The Bloody Guardsman.”  He was sitting at his laptop, checking the new comments, and one lady had commented “Who doesn't like a man in uniform?”
Sherlock narrowed his eyes.  “She knew it would be torture.  A hell of our own making.  She needs to be punished, John.”
Sherlock smiled and nodded.  “Thank you, John.  I’m glad you came, though I know you’d never disappoint Molly.”  He still seemed a little out of breath, and he was glistening with sweat.
in me.”
Irene held up her hand.  “Nope, I’ve heard it from Molly, fast forward through that.  Did you realise you were demi then?  Or did it take it happening a second time?”
Like in the movie, there was an ensemble scene towards the end that included Sally with Greg (who was more chuffed than he’d admit that he got to be included) and Irene with Molly.  The latter two argued endlessly over which one would get to wear the rugby kit.  Molly won the argument, but John suspected it was a ruse by Irene to see Molly dressed like a rugby player.
knowing him like Molly had.  She had a way of seeing right through to the heart of things – she was like that with everyone.  Even after he confessed his feelings for her and she gently explained that she didn’t like boys that way, they didn’t stay awkward around each other for long.  They were able to settle back into their friendship and it remained that way until graduation.  They parted on very good terms when they went off to university - Molly to London and John to Edinburgh.
John knew deep down that Irene had not planned this deliberately.  It was the product of spur-of-the-moment brainstorming with people she might possibly work for.  But she couldn’t have picked a scenario more likely to torment him if she tried.  He couldn’t bring himself to say no, though.  This meant too much to her, and he had come to like her very much.
“John, you’ll come to our recital, won’t you?”  He looked up from his mobile to see Molly gazing at him hopefully.
John found similarly hilarious exchanges on many of the pictures.  And some of the stuff on chemistry and forensics were pretty fascinating.  He thought about hitting the follow button on Sherlock’s account, but if what Irene said was true, it was better not to draw attention to himself.
In fact, the more John thought about it, the more he realized pandora’s box was already open.  Whether or not he ever confronted Sherlock, the memory of those bloody dog tags and the red pants has uncovered all the feelings he’s been suppressing the past 7 months…the growing discontent in his future with Mary.  She was already second choice.
Molly shrieked and threw her arms around her.  Irene laughed and gave her a thorough kiss.  “But!  Before they agree to hire me, they want me to make another video, this time using professional equipment.  They’ll provide all that, and they gave me a budget as well.  They asked for ideas of what I might like to do.  We brainstormed possibilities and came up with one routine that they were over the moon about.  I hope you don’t mind, but I sort of included you as part of it even though you didn’t agree to something like this.”
John winced in sympathy. He knew exactly what that felt like.  He set to work immediately, grabbing Sherlock’s leg and removing his shoe, then using the heel of his hand to push against the ball of Sherlock’s foot.  With his other hand he massaged the calf muscles.  The simultaneous action always worked the best to get the cramp to release more quickly.  Sherlock groaned and whimpered, but after a few moments his face relaxed and his shoulders slumped in relief.  John didn’t stop the pressure or the massaging, as it was always a risk of another cramp if treatment stopped too quickly.
John let out a string of curses, each more vehement than the next, and Sherlock doubled over in laughter.  John couldn’t exactly skip his own party. Molly would murder him and then offer up his corpse to her anatomy course.  “Fine…
John rubbed the back of his neck.  “It was probably the most humiliating experience of my life.  We got into her bedroom and started making out, and I couldn’t get it up.  I felt really uncomfortable.  She was all over me and all I wanted to do was push her away.  She finally asked me if I was gay, and I feel like I should have lied and told her I was.  I told her no, I don’t want to have sex with boys either.  She concluded I was asexual and pretended to understand, but she dumped me pretty quickly after that.  I heard she achieved her all important goal not even a week later with some bloke named David.
John could see in Irene’s eyes that she wanted him to elaborate on his answer, but Molly was squeezing her wrist.  She took a different tack.  “Would it be too personal to ask about being demisexual?  I know the definition of it, but I’d love to understand it better.  Human sexuality is a fascinating subject to me.”
shop for us.  For uh…for tonight?”
Sherlock raised one eyebrow.  “Well, it’s such a nice one.”  He turned and went over to another table and began unpacking his bag.  Clearly he was about to get started on his own work.
John started chuckling, glad for the distraction from the fact that Sherlock was spraying up and down his arms.  “Sherlock, that’s very nice of you to think of my modesty, but I’m not actually naked under the towel.  I’ve got a pair of boxer briefs on.”  He giggled again at the look on Sherlock’s face as he realised he’d been concerned for nothing.
Sherlock gave a little shake of his head.  “No, I don’t have any lube.  It would be a crime if your first time being fucked is a quick spit job in a semi-public place.”  John whined in protest at the idea that Sherlock might actually stop what they were doing.  Sherlock seemed to read his mind, because he gave John a heated look and continued, “That being said, I don’t think I could stop touching you if the building were on fire.  We’ll think of something else.”  Sherlock nuzzled against the line of his jaw, nipping at his chin.
, John.  I’m sure you don’t want to see those things either, but…”  She shrugged as if to say, who else was there.
When John entered the building and keyed in the code to enter the lab, he was startled to find it already occupied.  Even more disconcerting was when the other person turned his way and he saw that it was Sherlock Holmes.  “Oh!  Hello.”
“I suppose we should stop nattering on and focus on the task at hand.”  John nodded his head rapidly in agreement.  His heart was pounding, and he wasn’t entirely sure it was due to the near miss.
Sherlock stared, and his mouth opened and closed a couple of times before spluttering out, “I don’t understand.  If you’re turned on, that would imply that you feel…
The setting of the video itself was inspired by this music video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHVWqauWiEg
Sherlock frowned, his nose scrunching up.  “Behaviour?  What does that mean?  Is this a boyfriend thing? What exactly are you wanting me to do?”
“Sherlock,” he moaned, “I need to feel you, all of you.”  Sherlock understood, lifting up slightly to tug off his pants.  John scrambled to get his own off, and after some awkward fumbling and kicking, they were finally completely nude.  Sherlock’s weight came back down on top of him and it was the most glorious feeling in the world.
John reddened.  “It was Irene’s idea.  She said you shouldn’t go without just because you’re unattached.”
Sherlock chuckled.  “Well, I didn’t want you with me because I intended to get something for us too and I didn’t want to spoil the surprise.”
John stopped pacing.  He needed to take action.  Now.  Mary wouldn’t be back for hours, he couldn’t wait that long.  He went upstairs and packed an overnight bag.  He retrieved his dog tags from the Army box and put them in his pocket.
Ignoring the sinking feeling in his stomach, John nodded.  “Of course, Sherlock. Your friendship means the world to me.”
about sex.  You really have no idea what John’s been through.  If you did, you’d understand why this is a disaster.”
there were so many sexual thoughts.  Every time he was in the mood for a wank (which was a lot lately) he had to forcibly stop himself from going to Instagram to watch Sherlock dancing.  That’s how bad it was getting.  Every time his mobile alerted him to a new video by Irene, his cock twitched.  He always had mixed feelings if it turned out to be someone other than Sherlock, and ended up with a raging debate inside of him if it
“Don’t be absurd!”  It was Dimmock again.  He stood up, his expression hurt.  He stared at Sherlock for a few moments and then shook his head.  “So when you said you don’t get involved, what you really meant was that you don’t get involved with
John felt alarm bells going off in his head as Sherlock approached.  He tried not to look apprehensive, but must have failed because Sherlock gave him a reassuring smile.  “Don’t worry, it’s filled it with warm water.”
This time it was Sherlock who stopped in his tracks, whipping around to give him a heated look.  “I would have thought you’d want to try fucking me first.  Remember what I said about bottoming being a vulnerable position?”
Sherlock’s jaw dropped.  “How
John was lounging on a lab stool trying to make heads or tails of his lecture notes when Sherlock burst into the room, panting.  John stared at him in amazement.  He’d never seen Sherlock in a hurry before.  “Sorry, I’m late, we just finished rehearsal.”  Sherlock took off his coat and John saw that he was wearing an oversized sweatshirt over a leotard.  He’d obviously not taken the time to change before rushing over.
John sniffed in irritation.  “Demis
Sherlock’s eyes sparkled.  “I left it at home, John.  We’re not ready for that yet.  It can keep until we’re more established.”
.”  His voice broke a little at the possibility that he could be rejected yet again.
Molly goggled.  “He didn’t invite himself to your room?”  John shook his head.  “Did he leave with someone else?”  John shook his head again.
Sherlock mumbled a response that sounded almost like, “Lucky bastards.”  John asked him to repeat it, and Sherlock shrugged and said, “It’s a bit different baring it all in front of two lesbians.”  John conceded the point.
John winced.  “I think for tonight I should go upstairs.  Doesn’t feel right until I talk with Mary.  Which I’ll do tomorrow.”
John gripped Sherlock’s arms tightly, overwhelmed by his declaration and by the novel sensation of being filled.  “Oh god, Sherlock.  This feels amazing, but…I need…”
that’s the real reason why Irene didn’t use Molly.  She wouldn’t have been able to stand it.”
John shook his head, trying to look reassuring as his heart pounded from what had seemed like Sherlock was going to kiss him for real.  “No, it’s okay.  It’s been a long day.  Look, I have an idea.  Most of the time you’re getting it in the right direction, it’s just falling short of the camera.  Maybe we can get a third towel and Molly can drape it over the camera right as you’re throwing yours, and it will give the illusion that it’s the same one.”  He looked over at Irene.
John tilted his head, pressing his lips to Sherlock’s.  He leaned back to look up into Sherlock’s lovely eyes. Rubbing his hand up and down Sherlock’s arm, he whispered, “Love, you’ve been making me happy for months now.  Ever since we met…no…since before we met, you’ve been putting a smile on my face.  Just keep being yourself.  Don’t forget, I know fuck all about relationships, too.  We’ll figure it out together.”
Irene looked pensive.  “But what if he pulls a Sholto?  He may reject you because he knows he can’t reciprocate.  John, he doesn’t deserve to be put in that position.  He values your friendship.”
try to spend less time with Sherlock to mitigate his growing feelings.  But it was obvious that Sherlock really appreciated their friendship. He had brightened considerably when John declared them to be friends, probably because it seemed like most people weren’t clamoring to spend time with him unless it involved sex.  It would be kinda shitty if John were to suddenly pull back from the friendship because he’s now starting to have sexual thoughts about him.
John took Sherlock up on his offer occasionally.  Not as often as he’d like, but he didn’t want to push his luck by annoying the genius too much.
True to Irene’s word, John didn’t have to dance.  He did have to do choreographed movements, like backing away with Sherlock stalking towards him, then reversing their moves with John advancing on him as he backed away.  The general idea of the story, similar to the song, is that Sherlock wanted to have him and was trying to get his attention, and John’s reaction alternated between amusement, irritation, desire, and flirting.
Sherlock gave him a bewildered look.  “The what?”
Sherlock brought his hands up and began to slowly undo the buttons, putting them out of their misery.  His chest heaved, and John felt like his own breathing was in perfect sync.  More and more of Sherlock’s torso was revealed, and John was just as greedy to see it as he had been mere hours ago in the changing room.
John started following Sherlock on Instagram, feeling that it was safe to do so now that there was an understanding between them.  He liked the posts he found interesting, but felt a bit shy about commenting on any of them.  Sherlock followed him back, and liked some of his posts, but he too refrained from comment.
Sherlock suddenly tackled him, pressing their lips together in a kiss burning with emotion.  John circled his arms around Sherlock’s torso in a fierce hug, holding him tightly.  He decided blowjobs and breakfast could wait as they cherished this absolutely perfect moment together.
must use on Irene.”
Sherlock huffed.  “You’re always so honourable, John.  What if I promise we don’t do anything?  Just…cuddle.”
.  John quickly secured the new position by encircling his legs around Sherlock’s waist.  John knew Sherlock had muscles from all his dance training, but even so this was an impressive display of strength. His admiration was soon forgotten as he was lost in the sensation of Sherlock’s erection grinding into his.
John turned away and bit down hard on his lip.  He concentrated on pulling on sweatpants and a t-shirt.  When he next glanced at Sherlock, he too was wearing sweatpants and a t-shirt that was looser than the one he’d been wearing for the shoot.  The dance belt was sitting on top of Sherlock’s bag and John found himself wondering if that meant he was going commando.
Irene looked up, narrowing her eyes and shaking her head.  “John, you’re not wet enough.  Molly, spray him down.”
Sherlock pressed his lips together and glared at everyone, then headed towards the kitchen.  John looked around at his mates, his eyebrows raised.  “Well, then.  Look, it’s…heartwarming, how protective you lot are.  But you need to take it down a bit.  Sherlock and I will be fine.”  He slapped Greg on the back and then went after Sherlock.
Sherlock blinked.  Then he blinked again.  “You’re giving me flowers?” He gazed at John with wide eyes.
John cleared his throat.  “So you were able to deduce in my case that I wasn’t interested in sex with you.  And that’s why you left me alone?”
Sherlock deduces it and doesn’t put the moves on me, I think I can live with that.  If he
John raised his eyebrows.  “Even the pants?”
Sherlock gave him a slow smile.  “Most people are too idiotic.  You’re an idiot,
“Turn over,” he growled in a tone that was almost subsonic.  John scrambled to obey, flipping so that he was on his stomach again.  Sherlock straddled him, his cock resting on the cleft of his arse, and John started to pant in anticipation.  Sherlock bent over him, his lips to John’s ear.  “I’m going to do something that may offend your medical sensibilities, but you have to trust me that you’ll love it if you just relax.  Alright?” John wondered what he could possibly be up to, but he nodded.  He did trust Sherlock.
of the bedroom.  Victor finally had enough of my clinging and told me that he loved taking my cock, but I was too much of a wanker to actually spend time with.”
The next morning, John and Molly talked over breakfast. He told her an abridged account of his conversation with Sherlock.  He shared up until Sherlock’s joke, telling Molly his theory that Sherlock confirmed.  He left out the details that Sherlock confided.
John cleared his throat again, feeling dazed.  “That’s…amazing.  It’s extraordinary.  You’re really quite brilliant.”
Irene gave Molly a smouldering look.  “God, I wanted to take her to bed that very night.”
John raised his eyebrows.  “Really?  There’s such a thing as top etiquette?”
Irene screwed up her face and shook her head.  “No, that won’t work either, will it?  He’ll figure it out, if he hasn’t already.  This is Sherlock we’re talking about.”
She gave him a sheepish look.  “Sorry!  We were talking about demisexuality a few weeks ago and I used you as an example.  I didn’t say you were a virgin, she figured it out.”
“Only it’s just…you and Mary.  It seemed like…she was the one for you.  Just yesterday you were going on and on about how she turned your life around.”
John stepped into the flat.  “Hello, Sherlock.”  He cleared his throat.  Well this was off to a fine start.  He looked over at where Sherlock was standing, taking in his pajamas, dressing gown, and disheveled hair.  Likely he’d been at home all day sulking over the failure to solve their case yesterday.
“Holy shit!  You fell for one of your instructors?!?!”  Irene gave him a look of shocked delight.
John’s eyebrows shot up.  “You don’t seem all that worried by the idea.”
A bloke called Dimmock slapped Bill on the back.  “He has.  And we trust his judgement.”  Bill beamed at him.
Molly huffed, her cheeks turning pink.  “Irene!  I
wanted, but I don’t think it is.  And parading John in front of him like a prize to be snatched away, it’s not funny.”  She turned away, her expression vexed.
A few years ago I was listening to the song ‘I Want You To Want Me’ and thinking to myself that the words were so full of longing and it was almost jarring with such an upbeat tempo. I wondered if someone had done a slowed down version to it, and found this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ1TgnXu_Ak
Anderson looked like he wanted to protest, but at John’s glare, he backed down.  “Fine, I’ll apologise to Sally.”  He glowered at John.  “Who died and put you in charge, anyway?”
Sherlock turned and smiled at him.  “Always a pleasure, John.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked over John before levelling an incredulous look at Anderson.  “Good lord, you’re offering him up like a virginal sacrifice.”  John couldn’t help a tiny flinch at the word
Sherlock huffed out a laugh.  “Christ, you really are able to read me well.”  He rubbed his hand over the back of his neck. “I’m used to sex being a game.  But after what happened this afternoon…I know it’s not anymore.  And it’s left me feeling wrong-footed.  I guess I hoped I could restore a little confidence if I went through the same motions, like it was a typical hook up.”  He winced.  “Bloody hell, John.  That was a stupid thing to do, wasn’t it?  You’re
Greg glared at him for a moment, then his shoulders drooped.  “Christ, I’m a mess.  This is Sherlock we’re talking about, he has zero interest in women.  He was probably inwardly vomiting the whole time.”  They both laughed weakly.
Reading his mind, Sherlock groaned and rolled off John.  He took John’s hand and squeezed it for a few seconds before sitting up.  Giving John a rueful smile, he said, “I think we should have gone with the condom.  Now we have a mess to clean up, and the tools to do that are in the hall bathroom.”
John somehow managed to make it through each day of filming and then went home and wanked until he almost blacked out.  He almost resented the way Sherlock behaved so professionally, even when they had to be up close and personal.  He also may have admired it a tiny bit.  Sherlock was so brilliant at what he did, and there were times when John would find himself staring at Sherlock as he and Irene hashed things out between takes.
Sometimes there was physical contact, like John would be in a crouch as if getting ready to scrum and Sherlock would roll over his back.  Or he’d be doing pushups and Sherlock was pretending to sit on his bum.  These takes were always the worst.  Feeling Sherlock’s weight on him.  Enduring the endless touching as Sherlock and Irene brainstormed the best way to block a scene.
the last time you had sex, Sherlock?”
He supposed he was concerned about how they’d changed.  Because of course they had.  It was inevitable when moving on to a new phase of life.  New location, new home, new friends, new everything.  Would they still be able to connect as they had?
Giving him a smile that was both grateful and lascivious, Sherlock efficiently rid himself of his own snugly fitting jeans.  Left in just a pair of boxer briefs, which did nothing to hide his straining erection, Sherlock followed him onto the bed.  He began a trail of kisses from John’s calf up his leg.  Pausing to nip at John’s arse through his briefs, he continued the kisses up his back and shoulder, nuzzling into the nape of his neck before giving him a nip there as well.
John’s voice was shaky as he replied, “It feels as if every nerve ending in my body is sparking, hot and cold at the same time.  My heart is pounding, and it’s saying with every beat that this is right, this is good, this is
you like about it?”
John nodded.  “I also remember you deduced I wouldn’t fall for someone I couldn’t trust, and you were right.  I trust you completely.  Besides, I would be a nervous wreck if I tried to top you. I’d spend the whole time worrying that I’d hurt you and it just wouldn’t be a good time for either of us.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows.  “That’s
John stepped forward until he was in Sherlock’s personal space.  “Because they wouldn’t have been mine, right?  Tell me something, Sherlock.  How exactly did you use the red pants and the tags?  Did you wear them, or did you wank over them?”
When he got to the lab, Sherlock was already there bent over a microscope.  John’s eyes darted away from his admittedly fantastic arse and cleared his throat.  “Thanks for meeting me.”
The dance troupe included eight people in total – four women and four men.  Irene once mentioned that though they got along with the other four people well enough, none of them had any interest in participating in her choreography.  The implication from her tone was that they were talentless hacks and she was relieved they turned down her polite offer to include them in her videos.
Sherlock’s smile was sardonic.  “Yes, well, no one ever wants to know mine.  By all means, feel free to deduce me as much as you like.”
To his relief, he could see the light on through the window.  He let himself in with the key that Sherlock insisted he have, and went upstairs. He put his overnight bag on the landing out of sight, because he certainly didn’t know how to answer
“Now, now, John, don’t kink shame.  You’ve only just begun your sexual journey, who knows what you’ll be into.”
“So you’re going to break it off with Mary?”  Sherlock’s tone was tentative.
John must have been in a dazed state, because he barely registered being turned over again.  It was the sharp sound of the lube cap being opened that had him blinking into awareness.  Sherlock had found the bottle he’d set on the bedside table.  He watched as Sherlock coated his fingers.  Sherlock gave him an affectionate smile.  “As much as I enjoy rimming, I don’t feel it quite does the job.  Certainly not for someone who has never been penetrated before.”  John was about to correct him, but Sherlock shook his head.  “Your own fingers don’t count.  I’d say this is quite a bit larger, don’t you think?”  He took hold of his cock, stroking it, and John whimpered in need.
There was a sound like a collective gasp.  Greg interjected, “Hang on, it’s true?”
Before he knew it, he found himself standing in front of Sherlock Holmes.  Hiccuping, Anderson slurred, “Look Sherlock, meet our brand new captain… John Watson!”  They thrust him forward and he felt his cheeks grow hot.
John pulled out his mobile and looked up her username.  Clicking on her profile, he saw that she was calling herself a Choreography Dominatrix and her tagline was ‘I like to order people.’ About half a dozen videos were posted, the thumbnails indicating various people dancing.  He tapped on the latest one, which featured a rather gorgeous man with tousled black curls in nothing but dark purple tights dancing to Lizzo’s ‘Truth Hurts.’  The caption read, ‘Why men great til they gotta be great? @thescienceofdeduction.’  John assumed it was the dancer’s profile, though it was an odd sort of username for a ballet dancer.  John resisted the urge to click on the profile out of curiosity, and watched the video instead, impressed by the man’s talent.  His features were haughty, but every so often he’d smirk at the camera, usually during one of Lizzo’s more cheeky lyrics. The choreography was an interesting combination of ballet and twerking. John imagined Irene’s intent was to showcase the man’s amazing arse.  John found himself watching the video a couple of times.
Molly folded her arms.  “So, you’re saying that you’ll just have sex with Sherlock, and then go back to being lab buddies? And when he sets his sights on the next new athlete, you’ll be fine with it?”  Her voice had a steely note he’d never heard before, as if daring him to answer her honestly.  Irene was staring at her with frank admiration.
.  Before he could process that he was about to be rimmed, Sherlock’s tongue was on his hole.  John slapped a hand over his mouth to stifle his startled shout.  Sherlock was right, the part of him that wanted to be a doctor was offended by how unsanitary this was.  But he was also right that it felt
John stepped up to him and gripped his shoulders.  “Sherlock,
He could no longer ignore the jealousy when one day before rugby, he saw Greg looking extremely put out by something on his mobile.  John could hear the song ‘Pillow Talk’ playing.  Greg shook his head and shoved his mobile into his gym bag.  “Bloody Irene.  Why couldn’t she have used Molly for this?  I don’t need to be seeing this shite!”
Ella once told him not to see such things as a reminder of failure, but a reminder of survival.  He’d been shot and survived.  He lost his best friend and survived.  He could survive this.  And for this reason, Ella had also told him, he should stop focusing on what would happen if it all goes wrong.  Because what will happen is that he will survive.  Instead, focus on what will happen if it goes right.  Use that as motivation to move past the fear and go for what he wants.  And what he wants is Sherlock.
John felt the air leave his lungs when Sherlock walked into the flat wearing the same outfit he’d had on that first party where they met – midnight blue shirt and black jeans.  He smiled to himself at the vast difference in his two reactions.  The first time, his appreciation of Sherlock’s beauty had been almost academic.  Now he wanted to get him alone, tear off his clothes, and ride him like a prize stallion at a rodeo.
As if reading his mind, Sherlock’s expression turned mulish.  “Come to gloat some more over the case?  The Bloody Guardsman,” he said it with a sneer.
John’s eyes widened.  “How do you know?”
Sherlock looked disgruntled for a moment, then gave him that smile that was reserved for him alone.  “I loved it, John.  It was the perfect way to celebrate us ushering in a new era of our life.  It pleases me enormously that you were willing to come here with me.  I know you can’t have as much enthusiasm for beekeeping as you did for crime fighting.  But today showed me that you at least…support me.”
John’s brow furrowed.  “Why would I be uncomfortable?”
“As ridiculous as starring in a Grease video?”  They both dissolved into giggles again, which died down as Sherlock began to clean the splatters that John had made on his stomach and then the oozing mess between his legs.  For the first time, John noticed that Sherlock had a towel draped over one shoulder, which he used to spread over the wet spot on the sheets.
John pushed away from his laptop and stood up.  He felt a little dizzy, as if he were Sherlock coming out of a long trip into his mind palace.
Sherlock’s lips pressed together, and his breath hitched.  “I want to share everything with you, John.  My work.  My bed.  My heart.  Though it’s hardly sharing when it’s already fully yours.”
John found that he liked the idea of that word.
John didn’t dare tell Molly about what was happening.  The thing was, he
.  Being attracted to someone in this setting, it was so much different than the typical lack of modesty with his teammates.
him.  “Sherlock…I want to touch you.  May I?”
She scowled. “No, I’ll be the one giving her flowers!  I’m talking about for Sherlock.  He’s the only one of us that’s unattached, but that doesn’t mean he should do without.”
Greg looked thunderous.  “I’ll murder him.  Finally got something good in his life and he ruined it!  John, I may have known Sherlock longer, but I’ve got your back on this.”
John reminded himself that not everyone his age spent their childhood reading Harry Potter.  “Never mind.  I can’t thank you enough.  I would have spent the rest of the night on this and would have ultimately failed the assignment.  You saved my arse.”
, for god’s sake.  John looked down at the box.  He supposed the best thing was to just chuck the box into one of the bins out back.  He didn’t know why Mrs. Hudson hadn’t just done it herself.  Sherlock’s voice whispered in his head, ‘perhaps she was worried that jostling the box would set something off and it would start vibrating.’  John collapsed into giggles at the thought.
To distract from his self-consciousness, he returned the favour and removed Sherlock’s shirt.  He bit his lip as his eyes roved over Sherlock’s bared torso.  “The first time I ever saw you, on Instagram, you weren’t wearing a shirt.  Just a pair of tights, and Christ you were magnificent.  But damned if that tiny screen didn’t do you justice.”  He put a tentative palm on Sherlock’s chest, then slid it up to his shoulder and then down his arm, marveling at the silky feel of his skin.
An example of rugby training:
Irene tilted her head.  “But developing feelings for someone changes that?  Like a switch gets flipped or something?”
Sherlock blinked rapidly and he drew in a shaky breath.  “You’re a dream come true, John Watson.  No…it’s more than that.  The dream had died, and you brought it back to life.”
John realised that Irene must have posted a video, and Sally was featured.  He took out his mobile and checked.  To his surprise, he saw that it was a duet.  That was a first.  His eyebrows shot to the ceiling as he watched Sherlock and Sally writhing artistically around on a mattress to the song ‘Pillow Talk.’  They alternated between movements that conveyed conflict and intimacy.  It was tastefully done.  They weren’t outright simulating sex, but it was certainly suggestive.
.  John kept his hand over his mouth as he keened, his thighs straining with the effort to keep still as Sherlock worked him open with his tongue.
Tears pricked Sherlock’s eyes.  John clearly worked hard on them, even if they looked a bit dodgy compared to the ones in Bexley.  He hoped they weren’t rubbish.  He didn’t fancy having to lie to John.  He tried so very hard these days not to tell fibs.  He took a bite, and was relieved to find that they were delicious.  Slightly dry, but the tea would wash it down.  “Delightful, John.”
“Yes, as a matter of fact.  It’s quite comfortable, a nice cosy space.  You interested in seeing it?”
.  Mary, who he loved, but could never come close to how he felt about Sherlock.
The only reason John hadn’t beaten a hasty retreat was because Molly got drunk far more quickly than usual and was sitting in his lap talking non-stop to Sally.  He was having a hard time finding a moment in the conversation to announce his departure.  He was on the verge of breaking in to pretend he needed a trip to the loo when Irene flopped down next to them and demanded her girlfriend switch laps.  Molly giggled hysterically and shimmied off John’s lap and into Irene’s.  The movement made John realise he did have to take a piss after all, so he went off to get relief.
her. But only because I follow Irene’s account.”
.”  He bit his lip.  “Obviously that didn’t work out well for me.”
Sherlock went over to his still open locker and slammed it shut.  “There are days when all I can think about is taking you to bed.  Especially when we’re sitting
John blinked.  Sherlock’s told him a little bit about his brother.  “Y-you think he knows?”
“I’m putting it in exactly as Dr. Stevens told us.”
(See the end of the chapter for
John shook his head.  “I figured she was right, I was asexual.  And then um…”  He cleared his throat.  ‘Molly came along and we became friends…”
John grinned and leaned over to give Sherlock a soft kiss.  “It absolutely is.  One English breakfast, coming right up.”
Sherlock stepped back, clearing his throat.  “Well, Irene, does this look porny enough for you?”
Molly finally arrived with a third towel, and they only needed two more takes before Irene was satisfied.  “That’s a wrap!!”
John huffed out a laugh.  “What do you mean? Only my hair should be damp, I would have toweled dry in the shower.”
Mike frowned.  “John, I don’t know what led you to think that, but you know Sherlock doesn’t…feel things that way.”
John bit his lip on a smile.  Once again, Sherlock had deduced him.  “Ta.”  When he finished with the notes, he packed up his bag to go.  “I really appreciate your help.”
Sherlock gave him a warm smile.  “John. Irene asked me to meet you all here.  She has some news she wants to share.”
Sherlock scowled.  “I was trying to be considerate for once in my life!”
Sherlock gave him a small smile.  “Into my bedroom this time?”
John found Molly and chatted with her for a bit, warning her that he would be disappearing soon.  He drank his scotch and felt it settle into his blood, transforming his anxiety into anticipation.  After awhile, Sherlock appeared next to Molly.  “Well, Hooper, aren’t you going to introduce me to your friend here?”  When she gave him a bewildered look, he turned to John and held out his hand.  “I don’t believe we’ve met, I’m Sherlock Holmes.”
Realisation hit him that he’d come close to starting a fire.  He’d been too distracted by Sherlock’s warm laughter.  John jerked his arm back from the Bunsen and from Sherlock’s hand.  He took a steadying breath.  “Thanks, I almost fucked that one up.”
As intimately as John knew Sherlock, this actually came as a bit of a surprise.  Many of Sherlock’s ideas and beliefs were difficult to understand, but his derision of Valentine’s Day wasn’t one of them.  It was perfectly reasonable to be cynical about it, or at least John thought.  But now Sherlock was saying otherwise?  “If you wanted to celebrate, why didn’t you ever say anything?  You know I would have indulged you.”
Molly made a sound of protest and Irene’s forehead wrinkled as she looked at her.  “Didn’t you say that John’s bi?  Then it’s not a problem.  Sherlock will be quite pleased to find out the team has a new member.  Fresh blood.”  Her smile turned feral.
