“Perfect!” Charlie hesitates a moment longer, then takes a deep breath and holds the DVD out to Dean. She goes still when he takes it, and shakily withdraws her hand, tucking it into the pocket of her jeans. Dean studies her, still confused, as her smile starts to fade.
"What the hell is that?" asks Bela.
They’re still an hour and a half outside of Sileas when the sun begins to set, so they stop at a diner in Seaside for dinner. That song from Dirty Dancing is playing when they pull into the parking lot, and after Castiel confesses to never having seen the film, Dean spends the entire meal extolling its virtues and refusing to admit that he just has a gigantic crush on Patrick Swayze.
This is a huge task to ask of Castiel, but at the same time, hasn’t he already taken it upon himself to take care of Dean? He chose his major based on nothing more than how easy it would be to get a job with either his uncle or his father and start making good money so that he can provide for Dean and their future family. So that Dean can live a real life and make all the art he wants without worrying about money ever again.
Mary leaves for work. Dean makes dinner, and soon after eating, Sam leaves, and Dean and Castiel quietly do the clean up. When the last dish is put away, Dean asks, “Do you want to watch a movie or something first?”
before. Cas had said he thought Lisa didn’t like him, but since she’d reacted so well when Cas talked to her about the kiss, Dean had figured that wasn’t true. Seeing her react like this, especially after Cas has been essentially
“The entire resort is private property, and Castiel is still a minor, so his invitations are invalid.”
It’s kind of jarring, to finally have a word for this constant itch to be around Cas, the thing that pushes him to always think of Cas first when he has a problem.
Cas isn’t the type of person to play games and force others through tests, so this probably isn’t something he’s done on purpose. But Dean could never live with himself if he left this building without trying one more time. It’s scary to think about, facing Cas one more time and trying to get him to understand something that Dean doesn’t even entirely understand himself.
Maybe he just has really intense affection for his best friend. That’s normal, right?
Castiel blinks up at him, breathing deep. “Nothing.”
, and whoever I was with were just stepping stones to
But no. He’s stuck in the woods outside the fortress with no one but his beloved horse for company, and it’s not like poor Impala can do much for him in this state except carry him around while he tries to get his bearings. Between the fever and the erection, Dean’s dizzy and confused and useless. He can’t even remember how to direct Impala home, and even if he could remember, he’s not sure he’d have the energy to do so. His whole body feels heavy, covered in sweat, and he can’t focus on anything except trying to stay in his saddle. Even that’s become a challenge, especially with his trousers soaked through with slick.
“Hey, guys,” he says loudly, drawing their attention away from the painting. “Glad you could make it.”
“I’ve already had my first kiss,” Dean mumbles, turning his face away. Castiel frowns and digs his nails into Dean’s arm until the boy yelps, loud enough that a dog starts to bark a few blocks away. “All right, all right! I don’t know, I can’t… I can’t say I have enough experience yet to know.” He smiles weakly. “Ask me again in a couple years.”
“It’s my favorite.”
“Not that I’ve heard about.” Charlie shakes her head, leaning back in her chair as Dean comes back and shuts the car’s hood. “Dean, I’ve told you, like, a thousand times. He hasn’t been on MySpace that much anyway, and he always avoids answering that question when I e-mail him. To be honest, he’s probably not all that eager to come back. You know that, right?”
But that’s not true.
Cas arches an eyebrow. “What do you mean, I’ve seen your… oh,” he trails off and rolls his eyes when Dean laughs. “Put up or shut up, Dean.”
“Excuse me,” Bela pipes up, crossing her arms over her chest. Both boys turn to her, though Dean quickly averts his eyes. “He’s
“I was on my way to the tennis courts when I saw you out here and decided to come say hello.” She grins brightly and gives him a cheeky wave. “Hello. Why are you wearing a date shirt?”
After they've discussed work and volunteering and how Dean has felt this week, Missouri asks if there's anything else Dean wants to talk about. He fidgets for a moment, staring at his hands in his lap.
Dean clears his throat. “Zeke and Kate,” he says, dropping the names back in the hat and shaking it for good measure. Kate blushes bright pink and giggles shrilly when Zeke approaches her, taking her hand and kissing it gently before leaning in to press their lips together. Dean doesn’t really blame her; it’s charming and sweet, and Zeke has a great smile.
Dean joins him a little later, groaning as he collapses into the bed, immediately reaching over to wrap his arms around Castiel’s torso, tugging him close until he can leave a kiss on the back of Castiel’s neck as he whispers, “Sweet dreams.”
“No,” Dean says firmly. He reaches for the coffee table, fumbling around until he finally gets a grip on his phone.
“We still have a problem though,” Michael continues. “It
Castiel pulls his phone out of his pocket and shows her the picture he and Dean took yesterday at the Trees of Mystery, in front of the wood carving shaped like a heart. Mildred’s expression softens briefly, as she gingerly takes his phone to pull it closer and get a better look. Her mischievous smile quickly returns, however, as she offers the phone back. “Lucky you,” she says, and Castiel can’t help smiling back.
Alastair gives him the information, and luckily the party starts late enough that Dean can at least get through dinner before he has to leave. It works, because Mary only has an hour before she has to go to her shift at the Roadhouse, so she won’t ask questions. Lisa learned during the school year that Dean would occasionally have to skip out on plans at the last minute. As far as she knows, it’s a job, though Dean’s pretty sure that, if Lisa were to spend more time with his friends, she’d figure out he was ditching her for parties pretty quickly. A part of him wants to tell her, this is
Dean swallows, because the next thought is harder to deal with but impossible to ignore: maybe he kind of wants to fuck him, too.
And Castiel wouldn’t look down on them if they were usurpers; he’s seen with his own eyes how loved Dean is, and what good this family has done even for people who are not their own. Sometimes kings lose their crowns to a better ruler, and that’s the way it should be. At least until a better system comes about, perhaps something where the people could choose their own leaders-
Sam rolls his eyes and storms off without another word. Dean gives Castiel a helpless look, and Castiel pats his arm again.
Dean’s shoulders tense. “Shouldn’t you be back with Jo and Charlie? I thought we were gonna watch Indiana Jones.”
, don’t you care about
Well, what the hell is he supposed to do? Say no?
She’s not smiling anymore, not amused by his antics. Her brow is furrowed and her eyes are wide, and when Dean approaches her, she takes a small step back. Perturbed, Dean gently takes her hand, brushing his thumb over her knuckles. “Are you okay?” he asks, leaning in to ensure she can hear him over the music.
Castiel has to take a moment to think about it. 'Nerd' and 'geek' are words his brothers and classmates would apply to him, but not that he would necessarily apply to himself. Especially now that he's taken to track so well. "I like math," he says thoughtfully, “and literature.”
(See the end of the chapter for
But he promised he’d work on that, and he intends to keep that promise. He
If he did, it might be Castiel’s fault. He’s not sure he can handle that kind of pressure.
She's grinning like a tiger toying with prey, and Castiel almost corrects her, almost tells her that Dean's not really his boyfriend. Not
Castiel glances down. Dean’s green eyes are looking up at him with concern, and Castiel loves him so much he can hardly bear it.
-----
They’re alone on the rooftop, the wind still rushing around them, so Castiel allows himself to nuzzle into Dean’s shoulder, holding Dean and allowing himself to be held. “What if I never want to,” Castiel mumbles, and he feels Dean’s chuckle more than he hears it.
Castiel frowns, staring out at the horizon as Dean takes a seat next to him. The ocean rumbles softly, the water going in and out, swallowing their legs, then rushing back, leaving sand and debris behind. “Do you really think of me like that?” Castiel manages to say, the words sour on his tongue. “That I just want to sleep with a girl for the sake of it, and any girl will do?” He turns to look at Dean, who shrugs.
Castiel is a goner. There is no hope for him now. Even if he wants a little more time, just needs to figure himself out, Dean is just too addictive. He just feels too
The weather in Oregon isn’t exactly unpredictable, so you’d think that, at some point, Castiel would learn to keep an umbrella on him when he runs. Everyone knows the Pacific Northwest sees frequent, heavy rains, and just because Castiel can look out at the horizon and see stormclouds far off in the distance, that doesn’t mean he can go on a five mile run and be back before they hit.
But he’ll also sleep with another boy for several months and claim that it was for Castiel’s own good. And his friends are so loyal that they will defend him even if it means ignoring Castiel’s own pain.
“It’s good to see you, Cas,” Dean says, surprised by the quiet honesty of his tone.
He slides out of bed and strips the sheets, then strips out of his t-shirt and boxers before collapsing naked on the naked mattress. He’ll clean up and figure all this out in the morning.
John wasn’t happy, of course. Mating would be out of the question while he was carrying some strange alpha’s pup, and it wouldn’t get much better once the child came into the world. Noble alphas don’t want a used omega, and they don’t want pups that smell like a different alpha- it's a threat to their lineage and their territory.
For some reason, she seems more worried about Dean than about Cas, who hasn’t been in contact with anyone in the Goonies’ circle since he spoke to Lisa the other day. Dean is officially a wreck. He drove down to the resort yesterday, but was stopped at the elevator - Cas had never mentioned that the visitor code changed regularly. When Dean tried asking for access to the Milton’s suite, he was sneered at and talked down to, told that if he was really allowed access, then he’d have the visitor’s code.
Dean rolls his eyes, shaking his head at her. "Why would I ever be jealous of you?"
Cas raises an eyebrow and turns back to Dean. “Well. I guess I have to meet her, after those rave reviews.”
"I didn't-" Cas starts, but he stops himself, dropping his hands to his side. "Okay, I did, but it was for your own good!"
Cas, however, finally frowns, finally makes an expression that Dean can understand and react to. “Because you don’t need to know.”
Castiel shrugs. He’ll probably regret getting dirt all over his good clothes, but right now it’s just nice to be back out in the world with Dean. “Father is very protective of his privacy, and our family’s privacy. It never even occurred to me not to keep it secret.” He glances up at Dean, hoping his eyes can express his sincerity, the way Dean’s can. “I didn’t do it to be cruel, or to trick you. I am sorry.”
The hard part is figuring out where that fits in with his love for Lisa.
“Who said I didn’t want to?”
There’s no point in even thinking about mating Dean.
“Bull
The realization pushes the breath out of Castiel’s lungs, and he looks helplessly at Dean. “You’re not going to lose me,” he says quickly, apropos of nothing. Dean blinks, his eyebrows rising on his forehead, and Castiel shakes his head. “I mean… if I want space. If I push you away. I’ll…” And he has to fight, almost has to rip the words from his throat, afraid of baring this much to Dean but knowing that it needs to be done: “I’ll always come back. You don’t have to worry about that.”
Castiel thinks he might be on the verge of a heart attack.
He’s not going to understand, and Castiel isn’t sure how to explain it to him. This relationship has become tangled beyond repair, and between Castiel’s tendency to shut down and run away, and Dean’s genuine belief that he deserves whatever punches he gets, Castiel is starting to worry that it can’t be fixed.
The question isn’t coming from a place of meanness. Dean’s voice is steady, calm, wanting to give Castiel an option out if he wants it. In all honesty, a part of him does. There’s anxiety buzzing in the back of his brain, little threads of fear starting to inch forward now that he’s said these words out loud, now that Dean has agreed to do this with him and take this new step. And one of those threads is definitely related to the possibility of being unable to perform.
“Don’t get me wrong. I’m trying not to be selfish. If you’re both gone, who will I hang out with?” Castiel nudges Sam with his shoulder and gets a small smile in return. “But Dean looks out for everyone. Someone has to look out for him too, and I can’t do it by myself.”
Dean purses his lips and shrugs. “Is that your way of saying you want to start over?”
Once again, big thanks to
The further Dean gets from that very dark time in his life, the more embarrassed he is by the mural. And it sucks, because whenever he goes to work, there it is, those big blue eyes staring at him until he’s safely in the office or the garage. Several times, he’s gone to Wal-Mart with the intention of buying white paint and destroying the damn thing, only to have Sam or Charlie or Mary talk him out of it. And Dean supposes it could be worthwhile to leave it up for the time being, until he’s honed his skills enough to replace it with something better.
"Paint?"
“Cas saved my life?” Dean says.
Her eyes brighten. “Would I!”
Not entirely, but it's a start. Castiel decides not to delve into the more troublesome aspects of his family just yet.
“Dean? Are you alright?”
But what can he say? Absolutely none of this is new or surprising information. Considering Dean has explicitly told him that he needs them to talk about their problems, Castiel has no excuse for his actions. There’s a choking sensation at the thought that he hurt Dean so badly, but all he can do is take a deep breath and turn to watch the tennis courts instead of Bela’s face. Michael is sending curious glances in their direction, so Bela’s body language must make it clear that an argument is going on.
“Oh no,” Castiel says solemnly, “don’t get confused. I’m totally out of your league.”
“Good boy.” And Jody salutes before sliding back into her car, turning it on, and heading on down the road at a crawl, obviously not wanting to draw attention to herself.
“Dean works at a bar?” she says in a small voice. Well, smaller than Castiel’s ever heard. He shrugs, running a hand through his hair.
Images of Cas’s face flit through Dean’s head, all of them with wide eyes and parted lips. Dean feels heat climbing up his cheeks and ducks his head, anxiously tapping his fingers against the tabletop. “I don’t know about that,” Dean mumbles, because it’s one thing to want to kiss Cas, and another to actually do it once or twice, and then a wholly separate third thing to do it in front of other people. People who might take it the wrong way.
Dean gets his first whiff of honey and roses as he’s on his way to collect Castiel for dinner. The smell hits him like a brick, and the physical reaction is instant: his muscles relax, his body goes warm, and a goofy smile stretches across his face. He can feel himself getting slick too, and even though he subconsciously continues walking forwards, it takes a few more moments for him to realize how much further he has to go before he reaches Castiel’s rooms. The scent is far stronger than it has any business being, almost as if Castiel is in a rut.
“I could hear the party from the other end of town,” Cas says, and his eyes are serious even though he manages to smile slightly. “I thought I might run into you here.”
Dean grins. “What did you think I had everyone doing all day?”
“Beggars can’t be choosers,” Dean snaps back, but he brings his hand to his mouth and licks it anyway, the heady scent making him briefly dizzy. It’s faint, but he can already tell Cas would taste totally different from Lisa or Tessa or Cassie.
“Like we’re mated.”
This is the stupidest thing Dean has ever done.
There’s noise on the other end, fabric rustling, doors closing, Cas swearing softly. “The elevator code is 6776. We’re in room 1268, meet me there.”
“Dean?”
Castiel groans, dropping his arm off Pam’s shoulder so he can rub his hands over his eyes. “I knew you guys were up to something.”
Dean opens his mouth to respond, but as he takes in the flush of Cas's cheeks, the spark in his eyes, he realizes that they're not just talking about Harry Potter anymore. Not to mention, this is the Cas that Dean has been missing. This bull-headed boy who is willing and ready to fight for what he believes in, who looks so incredibly beautiful, like a righteous angel, even though they're just arguing about the potential outcome of a children's book.
“Except I can’t clear my head enough to think of something to work on,” Dean grumbles, dropping his brush into the tray and running both hands through his hair. Everything in his head is running together in one gigantic, gray mass of panic, and while Missouri helped him get a leash on it, that doesn’t mean he’s not still struggling with it.
Dean laughs, putting the truck back in drive and heading back up the road. “You know she’ll kill you if she finds out. And God, how much eyeliner does one girl need?” Jo pouts at him when he meets her eyes in the rearview mirror, and he laughs again. “You look like a fucking punk raccoon.”
Castiel’s breath catches in his throat. “What?”
that Dean can fight back, likes that Dean can joke and tease through his heat. He likes
It’s the second time this morning someone has brought up what Castiel did to help Dean get out of his downward spiral, and isn’t that funny?
“Oh.” Clearly, Chuck was hoping to hear more, but Castiel won’t play along. “That’s nice.”
. And his touch is hardly gentle when it grips Dean’s hair, pulling until Dean’s neck is stretched taut, and suddenly, Castiel’s nose is pressed against Dean’s scent gland, inhaling deeply. When he growls again, a dark, possessive sound, that’s it. That’s all she wrote. Dean comes there and then, an embarrassing high-pitched noise wrenching it’s way from the back of his throat as visions dance through his head: teeth piercing the skin of his neck, leaving a mark for the whole world to see, and a sweet, apologetic alpha nuzzling the bruise and leaving kisses on his shoulders while they wait for the knot to go down.
Castiel hesitates, then shakes his head. “I’m assuming they won’t let me wear deerskin around the castle,” he says drily, surprising a laugh out of both Dean and Charlie. “Do I have time for a bath, though? I’d rather not meet royalty like this.” He gestures at his mud-covered clothes and skin, and Dean presses a hand over his mouth to suppress his gagging when he sees a patch of blood on Castiel’s thigh.
“I could say the same for you,” Castiel responds, smiling back. “What’s going on?”
Dean chuckles. “I know I’m no Casanova, but I can come up with romantic ideas sometimes.”
about having sex with someone else. And if Dean can ignore his feelings and have sex with Aaron, if all their friends can understand it, what’s wrong with Castiel if he can’t?
There are conflicting voices in Dean’s head, screaming at him about Lisa, about all the people around them, about their siblings and friends being in that crowd, but the screaming quickly dies down to a flail and a whisper, because Dean’s heart turns over in his chest and he can’t help pressing against Cas, closing his eyes, and accepting the kiss for what it is, drinking it in before they both come back to their senses.
Dean pulls away first, and now he’s blushing bright enough that Castiel can see it in the moonlight. They continue to gape at one another, Dean’s jaw working as if he wants to speak, but Castiel manages to beat him to it:
Castiel’s fidgets with the sleeves of his shirt, half-hoping Dean will reach over and take his hand again, but also hoping he won’t, if only because this thing, these feelings they’re playing with, well, the longer they drag things out, the more they will hurt when it eventually ends. And Castiel going away to school might be an ending.
“Hey!” Jo yells, startling both boys. “Save the mushy stuff for later. Did you bring Lisa?”
But as they approach the table, Castiel notices a large, bearded man is already seated at the head. He smells of fir trees and cloves, and he glances up as the rest of them approach the table, eyes immediately settling on Castiel.
“Definitely. Talk to you later, son.”
She stares at him. Hannah shifts uncomfortably, averting her gaze.
Meg opens her mouth to respond, but Dean groans loudly. “Who fucking cares? The story’s not about romance, for Pete’s sake.”
That something is Castiel.
“Dean?” comes from the speakerphone. “The service here is shit, can you hear me?”
“Okay. Bye.” Dean hangs up and rubs a hand over his face, sighing roughly. This is a bad idea.
It’s too soon for this. Dean is still trying to make peace with his feelings, and there’s a special sort of terror running around his brain like a mouse in a cage, screaming about what the hell they’re going to do if Cas really does return Dean’s feelings, and the even worse question of what might happen if Cas rejects him. But Dean can’t look away from Cas’s eyes, and Cas’s hand in his own is comforting enough to draw out that white light, let it flood into Dean’s veins and calm him long enough to say, “Maybe this is a bad time to bring it up, but Cas?” He takes a deep breath. “Cas, I think I have feelings for you.”
as, just before Dean’s lips press against his own. It’s sweet and short and it means everything, and Castiel only barely keeps himself from gripping Dean’s shirt and pulling him back in for more, when Dean sits back on his heels and gives him the radiant smile of the redeemed.
Dean clears his throat and turns his eyes to the wet sand at his feet. “I tried to help Mom. Told her I loved her as often as possible, spent all my time with her instead of making friends, but y’know, I was only six. What does a six year-old know?” Dean rolls his shoulders and rubs at his chin, still refusing to look at Castiel. “I was still up one night when Dad got home, and he and Mom started fighting, and he grabbed her and pushed her, so y’know, I tried to protect her and I just… got in the way, I guess.”
Castiel sits down next to Dean, staring at him curiously as he tries to puzzle this out. If Dean wanted darker pieces, he could have cooked them himself, to his own preferences. Why make Castiel do it?
Finally, Dean smiles. “Nah, I believe you. I was thinking about what it means for
Castiel sighs. “Did you get that version from Jo?”
All that potential, all that lost time, and they’ll never get it back because Dean was a coward.
“My dad won’t step up, and it’s not fair for my mom to bear all this burden.” Dean says as Castiel admires a sketch of Charlie with elfin ears (or possibly Vulcan; he can’t tell the difference yet). Half of him is saddened by Dean’s resolve to play a role that’s not his; the other half is absolutely taken by Dean’s sketches. A child, probably Sam, kicking a ball around. Batman, Ironman, Luke Skywalker… Castiel stops short when he turns to the next page, gasping softly, only to have the notebook torn out of his hands. He glances up to see Dean glaring at him, clutching the notebook to his chest.
“It was Charlie’s idea!” Dean blurts. Lisa rolls her eyes.
Cas stands up, eyes wide, and holds out his hands to gently grip Dean’s forearms. “Dean, it’s not that important. Please, calm down.”
“But,” Dean continues suddenly, “they might be closed already, ‘cause of the holiday. The pharmacy is just a couple blocks further. They’ll be open.”
He’s been telling himself for days that it’s better this way, that separating from Dean is what’s best for both of them, but he only realizes now that he was saying that with a weird, underlying certainty that Dean would wait. Dean has always waited, happily welcoming Castiel back whenever Castiel decides he’s ready to wade back into the shallows.
Castiel rolls his eyes. "Stop. That's Kyriel. Angel companion to Jared and Jensen in the Supernatural book series.”
“Something
Castiel twists his fingers together, shifting his weight between his feet, and says nothing.
“She fights dirty!” That comes through loud and clear, Cas’s voice and Meg’s ensuing laughter. Silence comes after that, however, and Dean is confused enough that he’s considering hanging up when Cas speaks again, sounding resigned: “Hello, Dean.”
“Lucifer?”
“Forgiving that kid is gonna be a little harder for me. He hurt my little brother. Understand?”
“It’s…” Dean looks away, but not before Castiel sees shame shutter through his eyes. They’re close to the ocean, can hear the surf crashing and smell salt in the wind as it ruffles their hair. “I’m…”
Snitched to Dean’s mom and maybe called the cops?
Dean actually has been saving his money lately, as much as he can, in hopes he can finally buy an easel and a few canvases, so he doesn’t have to wait until class to work or to try something new. A pencil and a sketchbook does okay in a pinch, but Dean really only feels like himself when he has a brush in his hand, dragging thick, tangible colors across empty space, creating something out of nothing, leaving a stamp, an example of how he views the world.
“You’re the only one I want staying here, all right?” Dean sounds almost angry as he says it, but Castiel had expected nothing less. “There’s a new Hampton just up the street, everybody else can stay there, or go to the fucking resort or what the fuck ever. I want you under my roof.”
Castiel scoffs. “Hardly. Nine is perfect.”
Then again, he’d been so horrified by their conditions that maybe that overrode the rest. Their fear had been more palpable than anything else, and it’s hard to be aroused when struck by that electric scent.
“I told her she could.”
They talk about the new book in between directions to Dean’s house. Chuck is pleased that Castiel approves of Kyriel’s place in the story, and agrees to send a signed copy to Dean once the final version is published.
And Castiel smiles, all his tension rushing out of him at the thought of Dean’s immediate concern. If this is what it’s like to trust someone, and to have that someone actually be deserving of that trust, then Castiel’s not sure there could be a better feeling in the world.
But when he lowers his hands, turns around, and opens his eyes, the first thing he sees is Cas, laid out on the Bradbury’s couch, with Bela sprawled on top of him. They’re not kissing, but there’s still something intimate about it, about Cas’s hands rubbing up and down her back, whispering into her hair as she gently clutches his dress shirt, then compulsively smoothes it out against his chest. Dean can’t see her face, but a few locks of hair, golden highlights, are curled around Cas’s nose, his cheekbones, his eyes, and Dean feels like he’s just been punched in the gut.
“You’re not walking to your death,” she teases, guiding him out a back opening that leads almost directly to a small, wooden door at the castle’s base. She unlocks and opens this door, leading him into the warm hustle and bustle of the kitchens.
Cas stares at him for a long moment, that small smile on his face leaving Dean feeling a little breathless. Again, there’s a crackle of tension between them, the kind that Dean enjoys just as much as the actual resolution that comes from touching, and Dean wonders if he could have gotten a kiss if he’d just waited for this moment instead.
“It was funny when you thought it was Victor!” Dean argues, following as she takes off across the sand. “What the hell’s the difference?”
Three, Mary tried to ground him again this morning, giving him a lecture about being a good role model for his brother, and attempting to express her own disappointment.
Castiel squeezes Dean’s waist, leaves a kiss on his neck. “This.”
Castiel sighs. "I'll ask Gabriel if he can take me. Okay?"
: What kind do you usually get?
“So what’s the problem?”
Someone has. Castiel’s hand drops as his back straightens and his skin goes cold.
But maybe Dean needs to hear it right now.
While Cas is distracted by Dean’s tongue in his mouth, Dean reaches back down and undoes the button on his own jeans, unzips, tugs his own cock out and gives it a few strokes. He’s not quite coordinated enough to work both hands at once, so in a fit of frustration, he moves as far up Cas’s lap as he can get, until their cocks slot together. Cas pulls out of the kiss in shock, looking down between them just in time to see Dean wrap his hand around both of them at once. Cas’s hips jerk into the touch, as much as he can under Dean’s weight, but then he leans forward again, panting heavily as he stares down at the sight, apparently hypnotized. Dean’s breathing is getting erratic now too, and he leaves a few wet kisses on Cas’s ear.
“I’ll tell him that I’ll only visit him, if you can come visit me.” Dean grins. “That way, problem solved. I’ll get to see you no matter what.”
Dean chuckles softly and shakes his head. “Like I can’t breathe, but everything is fine and I’m okay and happy.”
“Hi, Aaron,” she says warmly, even though it’s clear that she’s unnerved by this situation. “The usual?”
A door clicks shut. Castiel takes a deep breath, but leaves his head burrowed in his arms. The darkness is safe and silent.
Dean startles, genuinely surprised that that’s all Sonny has to say on the matter. As if he can read Dean’s mind, he smiles, sets the painting down, and claps Dean’s shoulder again. “You ever hear of Andrew Wyeth and his Helga paintings?”
Mary rolls her eyes and puts both hands into Castiel’s soaked mop of hair, playing with it until it’s sticking straight up in several places, which pulls giggles from Charlie and Jo. “I’ll get you a couple towels, dear,” she offers, then turns to the rest of the table. “And no complicated orders this time, please, this job is tough enough without my kids causing trouble.”
There is a point to this, and the point is Dean. Castiel wants to get to know him, earn his love and his father’s respect. He can’t run, or else he proves John’s fears right, and resigns Dean to a future far away from his family and the kingdom he deserves. Castiel is Dean’s only chance. He may be the
Cas shifts uncomfortably, glancing over his shoulder at where Charlie has just disappeared, but then he shrugs. “Sure. If you want.”
Dean shrugs. Might as well get the lecture over with.
“I still don’t know what that means,” Castiel mutters, which gets Charlie to laugh. “I just don’t want to go all in if he won’t do the same.”
It rings twice before Cas’s voice comes through, deep and warm and crackling: “Hello, Charlie.”
, Cas! I don’t want to work through weirdness every time we see each other, I don’t want to feel like maybe you hate me every time you look at me, and I don’t-”
Castiel blinks in surprise, and immediately tucks his phone in near his chest. Lucifer is seated on the other side of the couch, with Anna between them, and even though Michael graciously allowed Castiel to have his phone back, it came with the stipulation that Castiel still can’t talk to Dean. So of course, that’s practically all Castiel has done. When he laughs at his phone, when he clutches it tight, when he spends the whole evening texting, everyone just assumes he’s talking to Bela, and Castiel has reveled in their ignorance.
And they both knew what it was like when their brothers were all together under one roof. Castiel and Anna got along fine. Lucifer could be distant and a little haughty, but he had taken up for Castiel a few times during the past year at school, the only year they would be at school together. Michael has a similar aloofness, but as the oldest, he carries more responsibility. He's usually left to direct and discipline his siblings when their parents are absent.
Castiel smiles back. “How much?”
Dean is hard and he is close, and when she lays down on her back and lets him crawl between her legs, watches him fumble with the condom, he tries to warn her: he’s never done this before. This might suck. If it hurts she needs to tell him. It’ll probably only take a minute. And Lisa, God bless her, she just laughs and tells him everything will be okay, and maybe it means something that he believes her.
“You’re cruel.” Dean sighs, adjusting his hold around Castiel’s shoulders. “Slow is fine, though. Just let me know what’s okay and when.”
“Why was Castiel banned from seeing Dean in the first place? He wouldn’t have snuck out or lied if it wasn’t forbidden, so I’m just wondering why it was forbidden at all.”
“You were with
Dean blinks, taken aback. “Um… I guess?”
Bela cocks an eyebrow, then snaps her compact shut, tucking it back in her purse. She leans across the table, closer to Castiel than she's ever been; he can feel the warmth exuding from her skin, and his heartbeat skips slightly.
is what seems like too much?
“Okay.” Castiel’s voice rumbles through Dean’s skin, dark and smooth and soothing. “I’ll stay.”
They head down the stairs to Dean’s room, where Dean quickly hands over his sketchbook for Cas’s perusal, and his heart flutters a little at the way Cas treats the damn thing like it’s made of glass. As the tension between them starts to wane, Dean feels a little bolder, and pulls out his unfinished paintings. He lets Cas see the blue and green portrait, but keeps the angel sketch to himself, afraid that Cas will see all the unsaid words written in the careful shape of lips and hair and shoulders. It’s enough that Cas blushes a pretty pink, all the way to the tips of his ears, when he recognizes himself on the canvas.
Dean says nothing, but his arm does wrap itself around Castiel’s shoulder, drawing him closer. Despite himself, Castiel appreciates this, and continues speaking: “They don’t care that you’re a boy, on a personal level, but my uncle’s business makes our relationship a problem that Michael needs to either solve or sweep away.”
“It’s been… tempestuous. Between us.” Castiel stares at the table, fidgeting with his fingers. “He hasn’t explained himself well, and I got tired of asking and not getting a satisfying answer.”
He trails off when Castiel’s eyes meet his own. There’s something sad in Castiel’s gaze, something like longing or regret, and Dean just wants to nuzzle into Castiel’s neck and hold him until that emotion goes away. Snuggle up in a nest and let Castiel scent him and relax and slowly fall asleep in his arms.
“There’s a reason I’m not a goalie,” Sam shoots back, ducking away from her touch. “Jo, this is Castiel.” He slows the pronunciation, watching Cas’s reaction to ensure he says it right. “Cas, Jo.”
“Okay, I won’t tell you.”
"Are you really so pessimistic?" Cas asks, lifting his head to meet Dean's gaze. "Don't you want good to triumph over evil?"
“No,” Cas says firmly. “You need to get out of here. Now.”
Dean whenever he’s respectful of Castiel’s needs?
Jo cocks an eyebrow. Castiel stares at Dean instead, wondering when they became close enough to be this tactile. They’ve only  known each other a few hours, but Dean is acting like they’ve been friends for years. Then Castiel remembers that Jo and Charlie had been touchy as well: Jo had hooked their arms together, Charlie had felt no qualms about hitting him, hadn’t shied away from how close he was sitting. Maybe that’s just what people are like outside the stuffy confines of boarding school. So when Jo moves towards him, hugs him tight enough to make him grunt, he lets her do so, and even manages to smile when she eyes him.
The crowd is starting to dissipate, and Dean guesses it’s close to midnight, so he gestures towards the door, allowing Cas to lead the way back into the theater. Dean sends Charlie a thumbs up as soon as he’s seated, and tries to ignore Cas’s sudden bout of texting.
Benny cocks an eyebrow at Castiel before gesturing in Dean’s direction. “You better not be jerking my boy around, Milton. I know what your family’s like-”
Castiel is just very, very confused.
“Cas is going to be here for the funeral?” Sam tries to change the subject, sounding a little too perky, and now Dean’s convinced something’s up.
“Wha-”
No response.
Dean feels like he’s in a pretty good place now, if he’s honest with himself. Besides the therapy and the coping mechanisms, he’s signed up for painting classes, made peace with Jo, plays more with Sam, and showed enough improvement in his grades that he was allowed into AP English with Charlie for the spring semester. All that’s left is to make amends with the two people Dean hurt most: Lisa and Cas. But that’s proven harder than he expected.
For the first time in a while, Dean remembers that he’s supposed to be finding a suitor. That his father wants him to get married and go be a trophy omega in some other kingdom, even though Dean has been training to take over the throne since he was just a pup, and Sam has no interest in anything except studying with the Men of Letters. So Dean isn’t sure what John expects to get out of marrying Dean off.
“Sam and I would be there too,” Jo protests, but Lisa is still shaking her head.
“Why are you telling Bela?” Dean whispers back. “Does she know about Charlie?”
Castiel rolls his eyes. “You’re not really going to Portland.”
“No, no, just…” Cas sighs heavily. “I’m sorry, I’m-”
Castiel pauses when he notices the tables. The restaurant is bustling, and the noise plus the sudden warmth is admittedly jarring, especially since he’s now unsure he’ll be able to get a meal to take back to Dean. He recognizes the woman he had held the door for waiting in a small line, heading somewhere he can’t see, and hesitantly approaches her, gently tapping her shoulder until she turns around.
The conversation dies away, both of them waiting for the other one to make the first move. Dean’s skin is thrumming with anticipation, his cock starting to fill with blood just thinking about Castiel’s knot inside him. The only sounds are birds singing, and the wind moving through the leaves. Castiel shifts, staring at Dean’s thighs, and slowly lifts his hand… but leaves it dangling in the air, uncertain.
“Um,” Cas hesitates, and Dean closes his eyes and sits back, anticipating the words that follow: “Is Dean there?”
warmed up yet.”
“I have no idea,” Castiel answers honestly. “But this is going to be a really weird summer.”
But it’s too easy, and it can’t stay too easy. Castiel decides he wants a break, and Charlie quickly takes his place as Dean’s partner, which wipes the disappointed look right off Dean’s face. Castiel grabs a bottled water out of a cooler and sits cross-legged on the sand, watching his friends dance in the firelight. He hasn’t been this happy in years.
Dean takes a deep breath, then decides to just rip the band-aid off. “We played a kissing game.”
“He’ll be fine,” Bela mutters, sitting next to Castiel, close enough that their knees and elbows touch. Castiel feels like she’s staking a claim as she stares this older girl down. “Cas, can I introduce you?”
And his phone doesn’t ring.
“Isn’t it kind of…
“Hardly. But you’re not a poised, well-mannered nymph either.” Castiel rests his forehead against Dean’s shoulder, and Dean’s not sure how he managed to find such an affectionate alpha, but he thinks he likes it. “Other alphas,
“Next time,” he promises.
They spend that evening excitedly discussing
While stuck in the elevator, he sends a text to Anna, asking where she is.
“No, no, it’s…” Charlie laughs softly. “It’s kind of cool that you’re asking, actually. This is what I was prepared for when I first told you.” She clears her throat, and Dean can hear something creaking in the background. “Um. Well. I’d never really had any crushes on boys. I like you and Sam and Kevin, but those floaty, la-la, fireworks feelings never really showed up for me.”
He’s a terrible person. All his excuses for how he treated Cas, trying to corrupt Lisa, Dean Winchester is King of the Scumbags. And he just wants to lay here on this couch until he ceases to exist.
for several days, is a little jarring. “Lisa, what’s wrong?”
“Because that’s not how it works!” Dean says, almost pleading. “Cas, I’m not… some tortured animal waiting to snap. I…” He pauses to swallow, turning his gaze to his hands, where the knuckles are cut and glowing red. “When I lived in Topeka, I ran around with this bunch of other kids causing trouble. We’d pick fights and steal things and they’d get me to graffiti walls… all that stupid shit.” His hands clench into fists. “I did it to protect Sam. I knew, if I made a name for myself like that, no one would fuck with my little brother. But Mom got tired of the cops bringing me home, and that’s why we moved out here last summer. So Ellen and Bobby and Jo could help her keep an eye on me.”
Dean and Mary’s voices are echoing in the kitchen, but Castiel can’t make out any specific words. That's probably for the best, considering the immediate silence that falls when Sam enters the kitchen, Jess in tow, and the way Dean’s back straightens when Castiel pauses in the entryway.
Maybe Castiel could go with him.
“Mom will warm him up for you,” Sam mutters as they hit the top step. He swings around the railing, a small smile on his face, as he leads the way to a closed door, opening it and ushering Castiel and Jess inside. When he flicks the light on, the room is revealed to be a dusty, cluttered office, and Castiel realizes suddenly that he’s never been in the upstairs portion of the Winchester house. He’s hung out in Dean’s basement bedroom several times, whiled away more than a few hours in the kitchen or living room, but the upstairs has always been firmly set aside as Sam-and-Mary’s Space. And Sam makes himself right at home, flopping into the nearest chair and swiveling around with a grin. He’s all knees and elbows and teeth, but Jess smiles at him like he hung the moon, and Castiel feels a pang of loss and regret.
Dean looks up, meeting Castiel’s eyes. After a long moment, he exhales and sits back, flipping his sketchbook around to show what he’s been working on: there aren’t a lot of details, but it’s clear he was sketching Castiel, playing with the shadows from the sunlight through the window.
“I know, I said I’m sorry.” Dean scuffs his toes through the gravel, shoves his hands in his pockets, and sighs. “Do you want a ride back?”
A waiting game. Dean can handle that. In the meantime, they’ll talk on the phone and exchange letters and gifts again, and next summer, Dean will be ready, and hopefully Cas will too.
"I figured you'd enjoy it," Cas says wryly.
, you know first hand I got experience.”
do whatever you want.”
Castiel is still stuck on ‘last time.’ Dean’s brought someone up here before. He’s done ‘indecent’ things with them before. And, from the way Jody’s talking, her tone full of exasperation and annoyance, it wasn’t all that long ago.
“Just not hungry,” he says.
“He’s pregnant,” she had said, as soon as she walked through the door, and with so much confidence that Dean didn’t dare question her. Mary, of course, argued that that was impossible, until Dean decided to come clean about his frolic in the woods with Castiel. What was the point of hiding it now? The proof was in the pudding, as they say.
“Who cares about those people?” Anna sighs. “Your friends and family don’t care.”
Dean closes his eyes and rubs a hand over his mouth as Alastair’s voice slithers through the phone and into his ear. He’d been afraid that the parties would pick up now that school’s out, and had considered himself lucky not to have been called about them yet. But Dean’s luck never lasts very long.
,” she whispers, clutching a book tight to her chest. Castiel swallows and glances at Jess, who only stares at Hannah.
“Charlie,” Dean growls.
“Okay.” The microwave beeps. Dean turns to retrieve his food and a fork, and drops it off in the dining room before getting the house phone. And yes,
Ellen has a list of all the things she needs taken down to the boardwalk today, to make everything easier for the festival tomorrow. Chairs, tables, menus and business cards, cups, plates, banners and decorations. Dean can handle that haul, no problem, and even volunteered his truck to haul everything down in.
“That’s Cannon Beach! It’s just about an hour north of here, you’d love it, Cas.”
Maybe it’s time to finally take up painting.
Briefly, Dean wonders why he’s working so hard to justify this, but quickly covers it up, excusing it with his love for Charlie and willingness to fulfill her dreams.
Did Dean tell Sam about his internet findings? “What makes you think Ky’s in love with Jensen?”
Jess’s eyebrows climb towards her hairline before she smiles and scoffs. “Oh, yeah, I know, you’ve probably heard all the bad things, but the refugees are all omegas. They’re great people. Oh!” Her attention turns towards someone standing behind Castiel, and he slowly turns to see who has joined them. “Like Hannah! She’s a refugee, and she’s working with Dean during the pregnancy, so you’ll really get to know how wonderful she is.”
“I’d like to meet your mother in person someday,” she continues. “I think we’d get along.”
Anna shrugs, attempting to seem casual, but the way her fingers are trembling speaks far more clearly of her current state of mind. “You know how Lucifer likes to sleep in? Well, Gabe went to go wake him up this morning, and his room was empty. His clothes and suitcases and everything was gone.” She swallows, eyes darting back to the floor, the television, the door behind Castiel. “Michael came home early to try and find him. Gabe covered for you!” she adds quickly, at the look on Castiel’s face. “But they still haven’t found Luke.” Her eyes drop to her hands, and she sighs softly. “I’m supposed to tell you to order a pizza and wait here until they get back.”
Dean jumps, which makes Sonny laugh as he takes a seat on Dean’s bench. “Sorry, son,” Sonny says, “but you can’t be getting much work done when you’re that deep in your own head.”
Dean sighs. “Sammy, come on.”
Hannah gives him a small smile as well. “They would love to see you. When you’re ready, of course.”
“Why?” She sounds suspicious. Of course she does. They were fighting, but the thing they were fighting about, well, it’s not a problem anymore.
For the next several weeks, long after Cas has gone back to school and a little past when Lisa abruptly moves to Portland, Dean goes to that blank wall after school or after work. And, weighted down with guilt and self-loathing and the image of Cas’s eyes burned into his mind, Dean paints.
And when Dean drops Castiel off at the hotel, happy with just a lingering good night kiss, Castiel knows that no matter what happens in the future, at least they will have this memory to smile about.
He’s not going to break them up. Not on purpose.
"Dammit, Cas, I appreciate the support," Dean laughs again, smiling crookedly. "But I don't really deserve it."
It’s hard being inside though. Out here in the sunshine is easier, but Castiel is starting to wonder if he shouldn’t try again to convince Impala to carry the omega home on her back. Unfortunately, that horse is as stubborn as a bull. She’s more afraid of her master losing his balance and falling in the middle of the woods than she is of Castiel doing something to hurt him. Even her interrogation earlier had seemed like an obligation, done because she thought she should and not because Castiel really needed to hear it.
“Oh, but it is.” He turns his gaze back to the intricate carpet under their feet. “I was already serving a king when you picked up your first sword.”
“No one you know,” Dean replies sharply, tightening his jaw. But Castiel just stares at him, waiting, until Dean sighs and lets the tension flow out of his shoulders. “Fine. She was in my chemistry class last year. Her name’s Lisa.”
“I’m well,” Castiel says after a long moment. He wants to add something comforting, something like I miss you, but manages to rein that weakness in. “How are you?”
Dean is just scum. So why not waste his time with more scum? Why not blow off some steam by getting in a few fist fights until his head clears?
"I would think that would be obvious at this point."
Dean rolls his eyes. While the tide’s in, he takes an opportunity to splash water at Castiel’s face. Castiel sputters and wipes salt water from his eyes before lunging at Dean.
“You don’t mean it. You’re heat-drunk. I can’t take advantage of that.”
But Dean’s not ready. If he actually thought that Castiel would ever be okay with his little experiments with Aaron, then there’s no way that Dean is ready for a relationship.
“Don’t forget, Dean,” he says.
Castiel isn’t stupid. Naomi can sit there and stare at him all she wants, but her retirement doesn’t change anything. It’s always about the betterment of the family. It’s always about status and what other people will say.
Castiel gestures at the barracks, and Dean immediately smiles. “Nah, the knights all sleep in the back, close to the castle, and our mages stay in the towers. Those are for the villagers, in case of attack or bad weather or whatever.”
Maybe this is their chance.
.” She draws the word out in a sing-song sort of taunt. “You were like this last summer too, and frankly, I don’t know how Dean puts up with it.”
Now Dean definitely can’t look her in the eye.
He’s off-key, but Castiel loves him so much that it doesn’t matter. It is exactly the song he was thinking of. He lifts his head and sings back, “
my boyfriend.”
Castiel smiles and drops a kiss into Dean’s hair. “I could visit you, if you go. It’s not like I’ll have much to do here.” Even if Pam and Charlie come home for the summer, Castiel doesn’t have high hopes for retaining their friendship after his encounter with Jo last night. He’s sure Dean probably has some nasty texts waiting for him too. “Maybe we can hit some of those milestones then.”
“Will you text me when he gets in?”
Castiel looks up at Mary, confused. He and Sam are forearm deep in the Touch Tank, tickling starfish and hermit crabs, and they’ve managed to spend almost an hour together in this tiny aquarium already, so this brusque conversation starter is just a bit of a non sequitur. “... Why?”
Dean takes a few deep breaths, then tells him.
Castiel frowns.“What kind of deal?” When Dean’s jaw tightens, Castiel rolls his eyes and throws his hands up in frustration. “No, you need to tell me what I just saw back there, I deserve to know.”
“It’s fine,” Castiel says with a genuine smile. “I like blue.”
This situation is far beyond Castiel’s capabilities. While he understands Dean’s desire to reconnect with his father, he understands Sam’s lingering anger too. It’s good that John has quit drinking, and is making more of an effort to engage with his older boys, but it also took him a long time to come around. Frankly, Castiel thinks it’s unfair that he couldn’t get clean for Sam and Dean, but seemed to have no trouble doing so for Adam. That said, as long as Castiel has known Dean and from what Dean has told him about his father, it’s always been painfully clear that Dean desperately wanted to reconnect anyway. The precious vinyl collection, the beautiful car, the quick defense of the first and only time John ever laid a hand on him… Dean still believes in his father, and wishes for his approval.
“It’s raining cats and dogs, Cas.” Dean chuckles softly, but his brow is furrowed in concern. “I don’t want you to get struck by lightning or anything.”
“The weather is rough in the winter,” Castiel admits, “but I like the community. I’ve made a lot of friends. And I like having a major city close enough to visit whenever I want, without actually having to live there.” He pauses, then swallows before adding, “But I don’t like being far away from my boyfriend.”
This suggestion is met with a frown. “The one in town? That’s covered in trash and full of local yokels, you could just go to the one right here-”
“Mrs. Milton, I’m Dean Winchester.” Dean offers a hand and another brilliant smile. Unfazed, Naomi narrows her eyes and crosses her arms. Eventually, Dean withdraws his hand and takes a few steps back, standing next to Castiel. “Tough crowd,” he mutters. Castiel smirks.
-----
“You should make it up to Cas,” Lisa whispers in his ear, “don’t you think?”
“‘Cause he’s working.” Sam frowns. “Plus, it’s Christmas Eve.”
“Are you-” Dean only manages that much before Castiel grabs the collar of his shirt and pulls him in for a kiss. It’s a little too aggressive, but Dean doesn’t seem to mind, quickly catching on and submitting himself to Castiel’s whims. When Castiel finally pulls back, Dean grins dreamily and teases, “That was kinda territorial.”
Laughing, Dean shakes his head. “Nah. C’mon, they’re not gonna throw the future heir’s dad in a jail tower.” He’s joking, reaching out for the alpha, but now it’s Castiel who’s turning a little green.
Castiel turns his head, smirking, as Bela appears next to him. “What are you doing out here, troublemaker?” he asks, making her laugh softly.
“Please, don’t call these stupid assholes a ‘rock’ band. They are so far removed from rock,” Dean scoffs, shaking his head.
Once they finally reach Castiel’s room, high in a tower, she pauses outside his door and turns to fix him with a curious stare. “Y’know,” she says, “even if you are from Cielo and being all mysterious and secretive about it, I think I see why Dean likes you so much.”
girlfriend, you’d tell my
“Law,” Dean answers promptly. “He wants to be a lawyer, help out kids and families like ours.”
“What the hell do you know? You’re sixteen,” Castiel snaps. “You’ve never been in a relationship.”
To his surprise, that’s when Cas groans and comes, dragging his mouth against Dean’s neck, and Dean loses his breath when wetness covers his fingers and he realizes
Even the music situation is fixed when Dean finds a radio station that’s playing hits from the eighties. It’s not Led Zeppelin and it’s not Dashboard Confessional, but they find themselves singing and dancing along anyway, and Castiel can’t remember the last time he felt so simply happy and whole.
Castiel looks back at Dean, confusion apparent in his stance. “Then why
Dean jumps and blushes before turning to look at him, but Sonny just smiles. “Looks like you broke through that block, son.”
“What did you want to do?” Cas asks, tugging at the sleeve of his shirt. Dean stares at him.
Charlie sighs, rolling her eyes. “Fine. Fine! I was thinking I’d have to tell you anyway, because of her birthday party coming up soon, and I was hoping you’d-”
“So,” she says brightly, “what caused your snit fit last night?”
Aaron shrugs. “It wasn’t my relationship. Dean made the offer, and I figured he wouldn’t have offered if it wasn’t okay.”
“What do they have to offer you?”
This changes
“Oh!” And Dean’s face practically lights up. He sets his sketchbook aside to take the green portrait from Castiel, smiling down at it. “Sonny gave me an art humanities textbook, and I kinda fell in love with Frida Kahlo. She painted mostly self-portraits, y’know? They’re just…” he trails off, closing his eyes and pressing his palm to his chest. “You can feel her pain when you look at them. She shows how emotional pain can feel physical, and what that physical pain feels like, and I… I wanted to try it.”
They start walking again, side by side, in a comfortable silence. When they reach the corner, where the boardwalk can be seen from Main Street, they notice the white and brown sheriff’s car parked just out of the way. Of course, even as Dean has grabbed Cas’s arm and started dragging him across the street, Jody climbs out of the driver’s seat and starts to approach them. “Dean Winchester!” she calls as they reach the opposite curb, “You get over here right now, or I swear I will handcuff you and take you back to the Roadhouse to see your Mama!”
Pharmacies are also brightly lit and open, but fewer people is a plus. “Okay.”
Sam scowls at the rearview mirror. “Sarah and I broke up weeks ago, Dean.”
“We wear them to bed tonight, and all day tomorrow,” Sam adds.
“What? Oh!” Dean turns away, running a hand through his hair. “I meant my other friends. Not Jo and everyone you’ve met. Other people.”
“The croissants here are really good,” Aaron offers, eyeing the menu. He’s trying to be friendly, and part of Castiel feels guilty about the other part that immediately raises its hackles, viewing Aaron as some sort of predator or villain.
Dean nods quickly. “No biting,” he warns, “but I want you to knot me.”
“Seriously, Cas,” Dean barks, his hand moving to grip Castiel’s wrist. “Don’t ruin this by bringing up all that bullshit.”
Cas laughs sharply, never taking his eyes off Dean’s face. “Don’t be stupid, Dean. This changes everything.”
He had told Dean he wasn’t sure he could make it to the funeral. Classes had only started yesterday, and if he wants to graduate on time, he can’t risk being dropped from any of them. It’s only as he’s seated on the couch, phone pressed to his lips, that he realizes how self-centered that line of thought is. Dean is in pain, disoriented, even if he couldn’t bring himself to say so. How could Castiel choose books and teachers over his boyfriend’s sorrow? And Mary had had an effect in Castiel’s life as well, outside of his relationship with Dean. She was an inspiration, admirable in her faith and hope and determination. Castiel wouldn’t be able to live with himself if he didn’t make time to say farewell.
The tension is heavy and immediate. Dean sinks under it, and when he opens his eyes he sees that Cas has too. In fact, Cas is leaning away, putting distance between them, his hands curled into his chest, his torso bent over his lap. He’s not looking at Dean anymore, and the heel of his foot is tapping anxiously against the floor.
When he’s able to lift his head again, he catches a glimpse of movement by the kitchen door. Sam is standing there, watching him with mournful eyes, but Dean quickly straightens up and clears his throat. Sam shouldn’t be worrying about him. Sam shouldn’t be worrying about anything - he’s got a few days off from school, Sarah, Andy, and Jess are coming over later, and all Sam needs to do is sit there and grieve and let his friends (and Dean) support him. Dean’s the adult. He’ll do the rest.
wanted us to be ready. And like I already told you, this is how I got to be ready. I didn’t want to freak out on you in the middle of trying something new, I didn’t want to put all that on you!”
“Okay, tell me what the hell ‘ran away’ means. He literally
Dean blinks at her, surprised. She’d never mentioned that to him before. Pam winks at him before gesturing at the cards. “Do you see anything?”
“Can I help you with anything?” Cas asks, sounding somewhere between exasperated and exhausted, and Dean’s starting to wonder if it’s even worth the effort anymore.
Lisa laughs, squeezing Jo’s hands before gently pushing her away. “I could probably put up with the music, but let’s face it: there’s no way my dad is letting me go to
Jess claps said hands together, then gestures for Castiel to follow her around the back. As he does, he glances back over his shoulder at Dean, who gives him a small smile and waves, mouthing the words ‘See you soon,’ before he slips out the front gate. Jess grabs Castiel’s wrist, and she laughs when he startles.
“Of course I do,” Castiel says. He can hear the breathless giggle underneath his voice, threatening to come out, and he ducks his head and turns to his plate, embarrassed by his reaction. Sam gags noisily, and Mary reaches across the table to swat his hand, hissing at him to leave them alone.
“I’ll keep that in mind,” Castiel says, though he’s more concerned about Dean than the king. Perhaps it wouldn’t hurt to start sharing pieces of himself with the prince. They’re going to have a child together, after all- it would be good to spend the remaining months of Dean’s pregnancy getting to know one another.
Lisa knows that Dean works for Alastair. She knows that he's hired muscle and it gets him access to parties and other perks. She doesn't know that Dean got into it to protect his brother and the people he cares about.
Cas turns and raises an eyebrow. “Because ‘Led Zeppelin’ is such a great name.”
), but maybe if he keeps reminding himself that he’s little more than a doll to her, he’ll still be able to respect himself in the morning.
Charlie and Benny stare at him, then exchange a worried glance before directing their own horses to follow.
. There was always a part of Castiel that liked to argue that Dean wouldn’t try to kiss him if he didn’t want to, but that little voice was always much too quiet in comparison to Dean himself repeatedly saying it didn’t matter-
“What do you want to show me?” Castiel asks carefully.
Now Charlie’s face lights up like a stop light, and it’s Dean’s turn to laugh at her. Charlie’s relationship with Gilda is still in its infancy, but Dean likes her well enough. She’s a pretty ballerina from Seaside, who Charlie met when she decided to give Dungeons and Dragons a shot, and the infatuation was almost immediate.
“He slept with someone else,” Castiel mutters. Anna turns to blink at him, and Castiel takes a little pleasure in her surprise. He only woke up a few hours ago, and already it seems like the whole world is against him, just because he decided not to give in to Dean Winchester’s whims. It’s nice to throw one of his detractors off, and maybe now he’ll have the chance to
I’m in charge of protecting Uncle’s interests, I have to do what’s best for this family-”
“When?”
“Then go to sleep. I’ll be in the bedroom if you need me.” After another hesitation, she awkwardly pets Dean’s head. He doesn’t wake, but Castiel feels his shoulders shift against him, and he nestles back into Dean without having to think about it, his arm still slung across Dean’s waist.
Dean takes a deep breath, and gently pushes Cas back. “Better,” he says, giving up a strained smile. Cas smiles shyly back, and Dean suddenly aches, deep in his chest, hating the awkward air between them. The one that’s all his own fault. “Mom grounded me.”
“Hey, Cas, we missed you last night!” Charlie says, cheerful as ever. “What’s up?”
. Don’t you see it?”
But Castiel doesn’t want to be the one to shatter her innocence. Instead, he tries to smile and change the subject, asking about the day’s schedule and what he should expect to eat for dinner. Jess seems to appreciate this, her smile quickly becoming more natural, her eyes brightening, and her hands starting to move excitedly as she speaks.
. And Dean had sassed him only a few moments ago. Dean is lucid. Maybe not entirely, but enough that he can follow the conversation, recognize Castiel’s reservations… and actually be
“You’re his lobs-”
“No. I want to talk to Cas.”
“You really like this, don’t you,” Dean breathes, mouth brushing the length of Castiel’s nose.
Pinned by green eyes, Castiel blushes and loses his words for a moment. To his credit, Dean waits patiently, thumbs brushing the seam of Castiel’s jeans.
Dean drops Lisa off at home, where she gives him a quick kiss good-bye, and warns him not to have too much fun. He promises to call her tomorrow, and as he pulls back onto the street, he hopes he can introduce her to Cas tomorrow too. It’ll all depend on how much freedom Cas has this year. A part of him knows it’s a long shot, but he can’t help hoping that Cas’s family learned something last year, and opted to give him a longer leash.
“Only ‘cause you don’t know better.”
“Maybe after you answer your phone, Picasso.”
“Fine,” Castiel says, resting his chin on his knees. The horizon has disappeared, the ocean the same deep purple as the sky, and Castiel stares into the void, trying to pick up his train of thought one more time.
“G’night, Mom,” Castiel slurs against Dean’s t-shirt, burrowing in under the blanket. The lights go out a few seconds after that, and Castiel is lucid for long enough to realize that means it’s night time, before he falls asleep again.
Once everyone is settled, Charlie clears her throat and explains the rules of the game. Everyone is going to put their name in a hat, then Dean is going to pull two random names, and whichever names he pulls, those people have to kiss. Ash asks why there aren’t two hats, one for boys and one for girls, and Bela snaps at him, telling him there’s no challenge or entertainment in boys kissing girls. Charlie agrees, and says anyone who’s too chicken to take the risk is free to leave. A few people shift awkwardly, but no one gets up, and Dean exchanges a smile with Charlie as she passes out scraps of paper for people to write their names on.
Both Anna and Castiel must have the same dumbfounded look on their faces, because Naomi bristles in the silence that follows. “I’ve raised a few boys before you,” she snaps, “I know how it goes by now.”
“I like that plan. I’ve missed you,” and she sounds sincere enough that Dean feels guilt piling on his shoulders. When she says things like that, those stupid dreams almost feel like cheating. The kisses, too.
“I don’t know, you started it,” Castiel accuses. He shifts slightly, rolling his shoulders, and Dean smiles.
“The worst part is,” Sam continues, “Dad wants us to visit him in Kansas this summer, and Dean is trying to talk me into going.”
,” Dean mutters, but he doesn’t get to continue the argument as Mary approaches. She sighs and runs a hand through Castiel’s hair, shaking the excess water off her fingers as she frowns at him.
“You’re back one day and already causing trouble?” Dean finally says, grabbing a chair from an unoccupied table and dragging it over to the booth his friends have claimed. Cas is up in an instant, his smile huge and brilliant as he wraps his arms around Dean’s shoulders. Dean returns the hug, squeezing hard around Cas’s ribs and slapping him on the back as they pull apart. Cas is taller than Dean now, though only by an inch, and Dean’s pretty sure he felt a light scrape of stubble on his cheek when they embraced.
Castiel rolls his eyes, curling up around his phone. “You’re not funny.”
Dean blinks at him for a moment, then kicks Cas's feet out of the way so he can get down and reach under the bed. The canvas on top is the one of Cas, so he pushes it aside and pulls out the other two: a vase of sunflowers and roses, and a portrait of Mary hugging Sam from behind. Only the flowers are finished, but Dean is really pleased with the way his family is turning out, so he proudly hands both canvases to Cas.
She surprises him by frowning and asking, “Why haven’t you?”
“Nope.”
Charlie scoffs. “Jeez, if this is the kind of miscommunication that happens in long distance relationships, I’m almost glad me and Gilda broke up.” She pauses for a tense second, then drops her shoulders with a sigh. “I’m not gonna sell you on Dean. I’m not going to defend his choices, and I don’t really want
He doesn’t even think about it. He doesn’t stop to say good-bye to anyone. Dean just storms out into the night, trying to control his breathing as he climbs up into the truck and drives back home.
He trails off, thinking of Hannah. Of Anna, his sister that he hasn’t seen in years. He glances down at his hands, turned palms up on either side of his soup bowl, and what little hunger he felt before evaporates as he tries to water down that awful, horrific day into something his potential future in-laws will accept, without completely lying to them.
One, this is the third night in a row that he’s been drunk.
“Then why won’t you talk to me?”
right. The rest will come when it comes.
“Well, c’mon!”
“Lisa’s here,” Dean mumbles, closing his eyes.
“Sexting your boyfriend can’t wait? C’mon, bro, you know there’s no privacy in this family.”
Dean grins and shakes his head, as if he can read Castiel’s mind. “They’re all mated, or they’re my brother, so they’re not
"Wait," Dean says, and if his cheeks start to turn pink he can pretend they don't. "Will you follow me out to the lobby?"
Charlie hesitates, almost as if she knows what kind of response the truth will get her. It’s only after a long pause that she finally answers, “Um. Bela told me.”
Dean is floating on air the entire elevator ride up to Cas’s room. Something has struck a giddy little spark in his chest, and he clutches his copy of
“Get a room!”
“To see you,” Castiel answers honestly. Dean sits up straight, eyes wide, and Castiel smiles when he realizes that, if the sun were out, he’d be able to see Dean’s cheeks turning pink. Dean tries to cover up his embarrassment with an awkward laugh, a little shrug.
Castiel actually blushes and ducks his head, much to Dean’s delight. Sam’s declaration of, “Gross, Dean!” is just the icing on the cake.
Castiel huffs, and makes a swipe at his brow with the back of his hand. The rain keeps pouring down and his entire body is soaked, so he doesn’t know why he bothered to do so. This is what old people mean when they talk about the arrogance of youth, he’s pretty sure. Just because he’s a first place finisher, that doesn’t mean he can beat Mother Nature.
scent, and Castiel can’t help leaning forward to press his nose into it, inhaling sharply. His hips jerk again, and he growls, wrapping his arms around Dean’s torso.

“Mother would be furious if she found out,” Lucifer mumbles after a moment.
“Shoulda thought of that before you woke me up by trying to kill me.”
Their eyes meet, and Castiel finds comfort in it. On sunny afternoons, Dean is brilliant, blinding sunshine, but here under the stars, he’s muted grays and purples and blues, his eyes dark and lonely. His freckles are almost invisible, his lips seem somehow fuller, and longing floods Castiel’s veins. He wants to pull Dean close and pet his hair and feel warm breath against his neck, maybe hold him until he falls asleep. It’s impossible to say where this comes from, but Castiel feels it so strongly that he can’t resist at least reaching over to place his hand on top of Dean’s. Dean blinks then, staring down at their hands, before slowly pulling his away.
“How is that my fault?” Castiel argues. Jo furrows her brow and makes a frustrated noise, but Castiel keeps going: “I never said I was going to be there. I think I’ve made it pretty clear that I want him to leave me alone for a while.”
