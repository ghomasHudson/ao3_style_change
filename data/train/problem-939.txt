“Sorry Sir, seems there was some miscommunication. There’s no body.” She scrunched her nose when she saw John. “What’s he doing here?”
"Well John, I never thought that liquid would get into your system. There uh… there's no antidote. Not yet at least."
‘The hell is he doing?’ He tried the handle but it was locked. “I swear to god if you are doing what I think you’re doing in there…” Lestrade let out an exasperated sigh and decided he really had to do it. He began picking the bathroom door lock.
John blinked, “You did? At the flat?” His breath went still. When he was talking to Sherlock, or at least believed he was, he had told him that he needed something personal of his in order to interact more.
John couldn’t even make out where the door handle was in the pitch dark of the tiny closet. He could only see a bit of light seeping through from the door crack on the floor. Two thin stripes blocked part of the light. Legs? No. No no no.
Ella’s expression suddenly changed “Oh no, is this Sherlock Holmes? You’re different without the hat.”
“Yea. It seems something has been scaring all his renters away. We were- I was going to come help figure it out.”
“Oh my god John!” despite wearing a nightshirt she pulled her blanket higher over herself. “How did you get in my flat?” She more confused then anything.
When he woke up again he could see through his small dorm window that it was dark outside, he had slept through the entire day. John felt extremely groggy and tried to stumble out of bed to look for something to drink. A small water bottle sat at the foot of the shabby mattress, John grabbed it and drank greedily before falling back asleep.
“There’s a bagelry two streets down from here, I’ve never been to it but when there’s a strong southern wind I can smell it quite well from my window.”
It was nice gaming and being able to look up at Sherlock laughing at the same time, tucked away in his corner of John’s screen. The night had passed quicker then all of their previous ones. He would occasionally look up and catch his pale friend observing him, though it wasn’t an unpleasant feeling.
But instead, all of his tentacles tensed at once, especially the one in Greg’s mouth before releasing its self inside of him. Greg now thrashed at full force against him as liquid poured into him from the tentacle tip, filling his mouth with something sickeningly sweet. He grabbed at the base of the tentacle again, trying to pull it out. But Mycroft looked as though he no longer cared as his other tentacles gyrated around him, gently caressing Greg’s whole form.
The man suddenly lifted the jar making John extremely nauseous from the movement. "You put me down this instant!" he grabbed his stomach to keep from vomiting.
He built up his courage and marched off for triumph. Sherlock’s smile should have alerted him that something was definitely askew.
Mycroft calmly stood up, twirling the handle of the umbrella in his hands. “Because it would be far safer for you here.”
John helped him pull one out. Luckily there was a light on the sink from where he occasionally lit candles. “I’m only letting you have one.” He lit it for him. “But it’s not fine. You need to take your damn clothes off before you get sicker.” He reached for the hem of the shirt.
“This has obviously all been a misunderstanding.” Sherlock tried walking past him but John blocked him once more.
“You bitch! You absolute psychopath!” Harry spat at the ground. “So what, John dumps you and you loose it?”
“There’s a tarantula three rooms to your left, it hasn’t seen you yet. The third is occupied with a rat, it likely wont bother you for some time, even if it sees you, best to avoid it regardless. The other three are downstairs.”
John had never been so close to being found out before. He had taken such careful pains to allude Lestrade on his nights out, changing at the gym and going through a back exit, mustering the confidence that the CCTV cams weren’t clear enough to recognize him.
Sherlock looked around for something to do, but settled on knocking once on the table. Molly immediately ran to John’s side.
He quietly stood, walking to the doorway of the bedroom and peering out into the hall. There was no one there. He stepped back inside and without warning the lights began to flicker softly.
Sherlock placed his phone next to the pillow, John hopped off landing on the hard wooden table with a light thud. The screen lit up clearly indicating it was in fact Monday.
Sherlock straightened himself back and glared at the offending rope near by. He had his own item to give him energy now and it was high time he used it.
Dear readers, I am tremendously sorry for never updating this story. I stopped writing all of my Sherlock fanfiction and this particular story was the absolute hardest to come back to. In real life, a very dear friend of mine took his own life after I last posted. For this reason, I could not bear to think about this story for some time. It has been years since I have written and I fear it will not be the same or even as good as before. I hope that I can give this story and others the closure that they need, though. I am very sorry for the sudden hiatus with no explanation.
John let go of the back of Sherlock’s chair and came around the front, before he could say anything, Sherlock cut him off.
A drop of rain fell on Lestrade’s note pad. “Shit.” He really needed more time. This was the third body in three weeks. He didn’t want to find a fourth. “Bag it!” He called out as two forensics quickly got to work on taking the body away.
John stood back as the fire slowly turned the wood around him black and warped downwards. A spider crawled in through the door and spied him. ‘
The case was still bothering Sherlock, he still couldn’t find anything that would make someone want to threaten Harry or John assuming he was on the right track. He had been in his mind palace for 10 minutes trying to find anything he might have missed when a knock came from the front door.
John had to stand on his toes to reach those cupid bow lips and force himself on them, which was always worth it. “I’m not going anywhere love.”
There was a sound like a person moaning. He wasn’t entirely sure that it was Mycroft or if it even meant anything, but it seemed like probable cause enough to him. He quickly stepped in, shutting the door to the rain behind him. His clothes were dripping on the floor, which he didn’t have much time to help. He quickly attempted to shrug off his coat and hang it up, but his mind was still frantic.
Lestrade looked up, the edges of Mycroft’s eyes appeared white as the inky blackness diminished a bit.
“I’m not going and that’s final!” Sherlock stood with a straightened posture and his arms crossed, his usual intimidation tactic not working in the least.
John was rifling through a closet when he found some old board games. He had wanted a way to more directly contact Sherlock still, but he was out of luck. There was no Hasbro Company Ouija board in there. After all, seemed like an odd thing to be sold as a toy. There was however, a scrabble set. Which gave John a promising idea.
The man cocked his head for a moment, “Oh, right, you mentioned on the blog that Mr Holmes didn’t always warn you about cases, I guess he’s the one that sent the messages. I’m Daniel Rogers, I messaged you about the flat problem?”
“John, I swear to you, this is just a dream.” Sherlock needed to think of something fast, logically he knew John would eventually wake up, but his mind was racing now. If it was a dream, that meant they needed dream logic to get out. “You need to think of a way out, anything, just imagine it really hard and vividly.”
Molly nodded, it sounded like something Sherlock would do. “I’ve seen things in the morgue before, not Sherlock, just… sometimes late at night in there, I’ll hear people, doors will open, that sort of thing. I… I believe you John.”
Sherlock’s smile widened greatly. “Oh, I was suppose to text Lestrade that I found you, he helped me all night.” He brought his phone out and rested his hands on the table as he typed out his message. John ducked under the phone and came up on Sherlock’s side to see what he was writing with a nod of approval.
“Let you…” It dawned on him, “You know more about this when you’re like this. Tell me whatever you need for you to stay here, I’ll get it, I promise.”
Sherlock would occasionally flip open the flap on his pocket and peer down at the sitting John to make sure he was okay. The new way in which Sherlock would look at John started to ease how he felt about being so small.
“You’ve really gone too far on this one.” He looked down worriedly at the mug. “I’m going to leave one of these days.”
“What the hell is this?” John stood in the kitchen staring at the various science equipment on the counter and slowly held up a large beaker of grey liquid.
Sherlock paced. Whoever that other ghost was- spirit? Entity? Whatever he was, he needed to find him. But Sherlock didn’t want to risk something happening to John again.
“This is hardly the time for such things!” He barely managed to get off the bed, standing at the foot of it now as his new limbs desperately tried to stop him.
That wasn’t the response John was expecting. “Sherlock, I don’t think you want to go to those kinds of clubs” ‘Or clubs in general for that matter.’
John smiled, appreciating the dreamy expression on Lestrade’s face. It had almost sounded like the way Sherlock treated him, always insisting they go out to eat even though the detective never ate a thing. Even going as far as to scare off John’s dates so that he could be there instead. John furrowed his brow, no, this wasn’t at all like Sherlock and him. Sherlock of course didn’t want anything like, well, whatever it was that Mycroft wanted. Could he?
John groaned internally, he must have made noises during his nightmare then. It had all seemed so real at the time. Especially Sherlock, although, in his dream, Sherlock held him. That was something Sherlock had never done and was possibly incapable of he thought. Sherlock had simply never been the sentimental type. He sighed, the last thing he had said to his friend in person was that he was a machine. He regretted the words more then anything. So he wasn’t sentimental or particularly fond of emotional outburst such as holding. Sherlock was honest and cared in his own way. John could never have asked for more then that.
Lestrade nodded and gestured for John to follow him. He wasn’t letting some creep sneak up on them. He pulled his gun, keeping it low as he made his way to the room. John was kicking himself for not bringing his own firearm. The door to the room was slightly ajar. He carefully peaked inside, gun front and center. The room appeared empty, though he knew there was also a closet someone could hide in. Greg put his hand up, silently telling John to stand back as he turned all attention to the closet door. He opened it quickly in a fluid motion, prepared for the worst.
John began gaining back more consciousness as he arrived back at 221B guided by Sherlock and Molly. He instantly flopped down on the couch once he was inside.
John let out a sigh “What did she bring- Sherlock? Why are you making that face?” he wasn’t sure how he could describe Sherlock’s face at that moment other then a combination of embarrassed bewilderment combined with sarcastic amusement.
Anderson swung around ready to yell at the so-called consulting detective, but froze when he saw no one was near him. Silently he went back to taking pictures.
John tried to force the water back in his eyes, “You git. You ruined your career you realize.” He pulled away to look into the eyes he could finally take in all at once.
John thrust the phone back in his pocket as he tried the handle, amazed to find it really was open. Sherlock really wasn’t trying very hard if he hadn’t locked it before texting him to leave.
“Hypnotizing you? Of course. Did you know that some people have the gull to claim that they have been hypnotized to perform a crime? The audacity to claim such an absurd thing.”
“Shouldn’t you be somewhere else right now anyway? Off working in that over priced suit of yours or eating cake?”
“Mycroft, get the fuck out of here. You know exactly why I’m here just like everybody else and I’m not putting up with this happy go lucky act everyone insists on putting on for me. I regret trying to do it if only because I’m stuck in this hell hole now.”
There was something suddenly different about the flat. As if the lights were now a bit brighter, but that wasn’t quite it. A heaviness that was there only a moment ago had lifted.
A/N: So when I started this story I sat at my computer and said to myself, I should put the twist in the first chapter. It wouldn’t make sense if I didn’t. Then I though, ooh, I could just surprise everyone in chapter two. Then I realized, I should totally string you guys along for over 10k before I reveal what my concept for this story is. SO I guess what I’m saying, thanks for hanging in there guys and waiting this out. We’re finally gonna see Sherlock’s point of view in this chapter.  Also there’s a bunch of clues in previous chapters :D
John looked up, noticing he was only a block from the morgue now. It was still early and he knew Molly would be working. The flat was an empty and constant reminder of what he had lost, perhaps paying a friend a visit could help.
‘Ah, of course, the inevitable. She would try and ask John out again in hopes of continuing there… relationship.’ Sherlock cringed. ‘If only this happened during the placebo test… I would have been able to convince John that he didn’t like her because he likes men. Ah, but there is this experiment…’
Not that he particularly liked putting on dresses in the loo or doing his make up there. Most people never looked his way twice, an advantage of being short.
“N-no boss! I didn’t mean it like that, honest.” He subconsciously put a hand on his gun and stepped back.
“I missed all of you, not your bloody thumb.” His grip tightened. “Please take me back to the flat?”
“I have to look up at you when you talk. Actually, it’s nice getting to look down at your messy hair for once.”
“Shut up. Of course you wouldn’t be able to find a way out, that’s why he’s a genius and you’re a hired gun.” Moriarty shot back as he focused on the camera watching John dart down the hallway of the dollhouse. He smiled wickedly, “This one doesn’t like to give up.”
John quickly stood, “You’re right,” Something about his friend was alarming him now. “I’ll dry it off a bit more.”
‘It was more then just that.’ The voice came again, almost as though it knew that Sherlock had quickly replayed the memory. ‘There must have been other times.’
Sherlock shot him a wistful look before turning towards the register, “Pick out whatever you want.” Referring to the clothes.
This was ridiculous. Completely ridiculous. Ok, so there were a few strange noises the other day and then Molly had brought over a Ouija Board. That didn’t prove anything other then mass hysteria. John leaned against the kitchen counter, tea mug in hand. Dreams, noises, and his grief stricken mind, that was all that was going on. He felt utterly absurd now that he thought about it. There were no such things as ‘ghosts’. Sherlock had died. It was a horrible thing and John knew he would miss him for the rest of his life. But god damn it, he wasn’t haunting him. This whole thing was giving him a raging headache.
Sherlock looked down to find he had become partially transparent, which meant John was likely remembering things which in his dream state was effecting the world around them. “John, I need you to calm down…” when had the kitchen grown so dark? “It’s alright, you’re just sleeping, none of this is real.”
Mycroft grinned at that, his prehensile limbs squelching in and out of his mate as the other tentacles began to wander about Lestrade’s body. One trailed over his chest and twisted its way around an already hard pink nub.
His tent and bedding seemed to fade away as water slowly surrounded him, drenching his clothes as the murky depths began to claim him as its own. John gasped for air that wasn’t there and felt the sting of salty water trying to flood his throat. He kicked desperately at the current to find the surface, seeing only a vague glimmer somewhere far above. His breath was running out as he neared what he could only assume was moonlight. But mere inches away from breaching the surface, he was ripped back down. Something perfectly smooth had wrapped around his ankle and was pulling with a force even a soldier couldn’t compete with. John quickly maneuvered himself around to pull the thing off, barely able to make out what the dark tentacle was. As soon as his mind could comprehend it, several more suddenly shot out all around him and enveloped him in their pure blackness.
“Footsteps were too light to be Greg’s or Mycroft’s, but the knocking is much louder then Mrs. Hudson’s.” After hearing a soft clicking on the ground outside the flat Sherlock had figured it out. “Ah! Maria.” His voice was sarcastically pleased and he remained in his seat.
Sherlock scoffed, “Of course I do John. People are so simple minded that they do idiotic things and then have the audacity to claim they couldn’t control their actions.”
“It is you. Oh fuck, I- I don’t even know what to say.” He was still horrified, yet relieved to know that there might be some way to help the elder Holmes brother.
“Speaking of which, where is John? I haven’t seen him around the past few days, you two haven’t been having a domestic have you?
“No I mean…” John shook his leg nervously, “I could never live with myself if I knew I hurt you, under the influence of one of your crazed experiments or not.”
“He’s staying.” His words were met with a somehow even more demanding look from the politician. “Anything you have to say to me, you may say in front of John.” Sherlock was really trying his luck this time.
I seem to be having a rather unusual problem in one of the flats I rent out. I cant seem to get any of my tenants to stay for more then a week, but when I ask why they leave they refuse to say. They don’t even refuse to pay the rent, but I’m running out of potential tenants. I was hoping you two could help me out?
John had a harder time of crawling off the purse and onto the counter, “I’m fine too thanks for asking.” He muttered sarcastically.
Sherlock looked around, maybe a previous tenant or Daniel’s himself had left a spare key. He grinned as he felt one just above the doorframe. A small flick sent it falling and caught Greg’s attention.
Upon hearing this, John doubled his efforts to kick at the door and knock on it. Anything to make more noise.
They found an innocent enough looking movie and watched. It was not an innocent movie. It was terrifying.
As much as he wanted to continue to tease his boyfriend, John gave in, taking Sherlock into his mouth, relishing in the plethora of sounds he made. Holding his hips down to lessen thrusts, John glanced up the stunningly white form and caught Sherlock's pale eyes watching him, pupils dilated fully, black curls pressed to his face from sweat. Light tremors shot down his legs, shaking them lightly against John, who tightened his grip as he felt them. John was almost painfully hard, he didn't care, there would be time for that later. This wasn't his moment, he told himself, this was Sherlock's.
“That’s it. Bed. Now.” John demanded, guiding Sherlock to his room and making sure he got into bed. “I swear to god, if you even think about locking the door, I will knock it down.” Sherlock was really not looking well now. “Stay here, I’m bringing you water.”
A month later the weather was colder and everyone had begun dressing warmer. The whole police force had been treating John nicer then normal, he knew the reason why and it made him bitter inside. They all pitied him. They only saw him as the suicidal friend of the wacko possible murderer. The insults had come slowly, but soon John found he was regularly insulting the police force in general and individuals as he deduced their crimes. They were still nice to him and bit back retorts. John didn’t catch the whispers about him, the comparisons.
John wasn’t at ease, he didn’t actually want Sherlock coming with him, especially after everything Ella said,
John excitedly grabbed a taxi, making a quick stop on the way to Doyle Avenue at a small pastry shop to grab something special for Sherlock and himself. If he wouldn’t be able to convince him to go out, he would at least bring Sherlock something nice to munch on.
John groaned, they really couldn’t risk standing there any longer. He began marching off rather irately, “Come on then, we’re taking back alleys and don’t you dare wander off.”
“I don’t understand,” Donovan sounded rather confused, “This room and the whole flat was already cleared.
Being moved around from place to place was starting to make John sick, holding onto Sherlock's fingers while in transport was all he could do to attempt to prevent extreme dizziness and vomiting.
"Why did you want to meet up?" he didn't notice the well dressed man carrying an umbrella walk in looking for him.
It was easy to find the police force, they had already roped the entire area around the fountain off with several officers standing around. Looking down at the grass below him, John could see where footprints had flattened out near him, meaning Sherlock was keeping close for the time being. It was his time to chuckle as he zipped his jacket closed upon feeling the cold weather. He held the crime scene tape up and ducked under, keeping it up a moment longer until he saw the disembodied footprints follow.
Sherlock didn't put the scarf back on the end table; instead he placed it on a pillow at the head of the bed and repositioned himself closer to the side.
His mind raced. "ah! John left the counter when he saw the fire!" a perfectly sound solution. But how far could John have gotten? He began calling for his flat mate again, this time checking every surface, even the floor.
“Glad you’re coming around.” Sherlock drank his tea in one long gulp. “Now then, for today I was hoping to-“
“That’s not…” John gently ran his fingers over the slits. “That’s not possible.” He pressed a bit against Sherlock’s ribs. There was a significant amount of give to them. Possibly more then he had ever felt on someone before.
Sherlock pulled John close so his back was against his chest and tucked the shorter man’s head under his chin; arms wrapped around him snuggly. “John’s my boyfriend.”
John had begun his search of the flat, looking for anything potentially suspicious or that might aid him in his investigation. There wasn’t much, but it seemed a few odd items had been left in the flat from previous tenants. Three quarters of a container of salt drew his interests in case it was in fact paranormal activity they were dealing with. But he feared lining any doors with it, in case Sherlock would be trapped. Besides, he wasn’t sure if the Internet was just listing off any old wives tale, or if it actually worked.
A case had called for Sherlock to take a look at a couple of bodied in the morgue. As he listed off his deductions for the ever-impressed John and of course Lestrade, Molly pulled John away to the far side of the room.
The tarantula was already entering the room, John had to back out without retrieving the post from the newly killed spider. This one had a smaller abdomen then the first and had no trouble following him into the next plexiglass room. It grabbed John’s leg with two of it’s massive limbs and began pulling him closer for the bite. John fell to the ground but kicked fiercely with his free leg hitting the tarantula in the face. It only paused his attack for a moment before continuing. John rolled quickly to the right, the spider missed but reared to strike again. He clenched his jaw and while it’s face was parallel with his he reached out and thrust his fingers through three of it’s eyes. The spider unexpectedly let go and jumped back for a moment giving John just enough time to stand and promptly empty the contents of his stomach on the ground after realizing what he had just done.
“You’re a damn ass you know that.” John’s voice was louder then he thought and he quickly covered his mouth with both hands, releasing Sherlock from his grip.
“Every time, you do this! Its absurd! I have cases to solve, work to be done. You can’t just pop into my life when you like and pretend you have any hold over me!” Sherlock already looked as though he was close to throwing something.
Sherlock’s hand raised slightly bringing his forefinger up, John immediately wrapped his hands around it. Sherlock smiled.
“I- I just don’t want to lose you again. I’ll be in my mind palace.” Sherlock brought his hands up and shut his eyes quickly to back out of the conversation at hand.
John looked up, his attacker was laying sprawled out against the cold sand. Everything was eerily quiet, he stood to get a better look at the man who now had a massive cavity in his chest. The sight was horrific and yet he couldn't take his eyes away from him.
Lestrade narrowed his eyes. “God damn it, you lied to me?” He was as bad as Sherlock. But it was too late, a cab already arrived. “You’re explaining yourself.”
Mycroft began lowering Greg gently onto the bed when Greg’s tongue, annoyed from its lack of space, flicked over the tip of the tentacle. The tentacle immediately squirmed as Mycroft’s strength left him for another moment and dropped him again, though this time onto the soft bed.
“I’ve already told you- It’s not your business. I don’t need you spying on me and reporting back to Mycroft! I’ve really had enough of it!”
Lestrade was not prepared for this. “Well, a bit yea. I mean, it was really short, just, yea.” His eyes darted across the room nervously. There was a good chance Mycroft already knew about his brother and John, but in case he didn’t, Lestrade had no idea how to tell him or in what way he would take the news.
Sherlock peeked outside the pocket, “Why the hell is he looking at a dead cat? That’s hardly important, likely just killed ‘
“We wont be long.” He mostly against the rock wall separating the property from the next and drawing closer to the lake.
“Yea?” One boy stepped closer with a strange swagger about him, both hands kept in his pockets. “That close by?”
John brought a fist up to stiffen his laughter but it still came through. “You’re too short for that. You’ll have to jump.” He lost all control and buckled his knees so he was on the floor.
“Sod off Donovan, it’s Sherlock’s brother, he was closer to the flat so he came ahead in case there was anything time sensitive.” It was close enough to the truth anyway.
"What are you doing in my bed? Wait... the last few days…" John took in his surroundings. It was an ordinary bedroom though it lacked furnishings, but he didn't recognize it. "Where are we… the dollhouse. Of course." John's body relaxed, so it wasn't a dream. For a moment he dropped his gaze. '
He squeezed shampoo into his hand and rubbed it through his curling hair, it was strange feeling the oversized cat ears on top. He knew they would be gone soon, allowing him to be hat free in public again and less likely to attack rub someone but he found he was already missing them.
Sherlock shifted on the opposite end of the sofa, John was only just realizing he might be here. He needed to show him, confirm John’s suspicion. But sending emails didn’t prove a thing. Sherlock carefully scooted closer to the teacup John had discarded, analyzing it carefully. He poked at the cup- nothing. Placing his thumb and middle finger around the saucer, he tried his best to slide it to no avail.
“You probably deduced it already, but the last thing I was working on was a way to make a person mute.” Sherlock knew full well what to do to make John speak again but the test was to see if he could do it on his own, proving the falsehood of hypnotism.
“I- I’m sorry about that Lock.” John’s voice seemed distant, Sherlock had just barely caught the words.
Sherlock frowned, John was only ever sad when he thought of him. “There’s no trick, I’m just sucking up all the energy in here to exist apparently. I would make it warm if I could.”
There. Just then. John could make out an almost unperceivable whisper. But it was Sherlock. He was sure of that much. But, who had he been yelling at then?
No, neither. Though I’m sure he would be very annoyed if you did come here. But it’s not you John, trust me. –
"John" the legs came back up around him, pulling him closer. John ghosted his hands up those beautiful thighs and placed a painfully light kiss on Sherlock's cock.
“You… “ Sherlock bit his tongue, he didn’t want to go down that route. “Why does it matter? I can just wear a hat and my coat and no one will know.”
John released a nervous breath. “This might sound a bit nuts, but” He picked up the salt container again. “Its not like it will do any harm to leave a line of salt in front of the closet.”
Alright, so maybe that was what the texting had been about. “And I know its really not any of my business,”
“Sherlock… if this is really you, not just a dream, we need to work out a better way of communicating.”
Grace crinkled her nose, she wasn't about to lose this, "You could have at least found a half decent looking man." She eyed Mycroft, assessing him.
"I knew what it did, but I wanted to find a reverse chemical before I used it. I'm not even sure if there is one…" his eyes unfocused again looking into a distant space.
“This is ridiculous Mycroft, she’ll wait out there until one of us come out. There’s just nothing we can do.” Lestrade had briefly considered escaping out the window, but it was far too high. He never thought he would be imprisoned in his own office.
This was a bad idea. An idea so incredibly bad that John couldn’t for the life of him believe that the so called ‘genius’ had actually come up with it and wanted to implement it.
“What? Me? Oh, no! No- I’m just- it’s fine is all- I’ve never… I mean, not that I wouldn’t, just that I’ve never really considered-“
“Sherlock is dead and I’m too upset to tell what’s reality?” John’s voice had a bit of edge, but he wasn’t too harsh. “She really was just helping me out and vice versa. She… well, she brought it over after she thought she saw him in the morgue one night.” Well, now that was out of the bag.
“Why? On edge? It’s really nothing to be concerned with.” Sherlock turned to deduce more about the scene.
“I will be able to and that’s hardly the point, it’s mine and I want it pristine. The one I’m wearing is a pale comparison.”
“Maybe even stay away from the flat a bit. Find some woman to take on dates and stay at her place for a few nights.”
Sherlock took a shuttering breath, “I want to see you, in person, I really do, but it’s just not possible.”
Sherlock bolted upright. John hadn’t noticed the sound. He seemed to be idly fiddling with his phone. Had someone come in when he wasn’t paying attention? No, that made no sense. John should have responded. No one should have heard him anyway, not if John still couldn’t hear him.
“Erm, I think I’ll pass on the jam…” he was sure he still had some on his clothes and desperately wanted away from the smell after so many hours.
“That would be perfect! I really cant thank you enough. I’m sort of too afraid to stay there myself…” Daniel ate another biscuit. “I couldn’t possibly handle the stress. In those creepy rooms, all alone, waiting for any strange noise to occur knowing that everyone else has left in what seemed like terror. Maybe it’s even some crazed psycho by sounds of that witness today. Maybe’s he’s even waiting to-”
“You know that’s not fair. I have just as much right to have a little pet of my own.” He smiled and motioned for Sherlock to take a seat,
‘Myc, I’m coming over. You don’t have to let me in if you don’t want, but I’m just worried about you and want to check up on you.’ –GL
John’s whole form whipped around faster then he thought possible, for a brief moment he thought… ‘No, no… you’re imagining things. There’s no one there now.’
"Hold on a moment, I thought I saw…" Lestrade stride towards the skull as John cowered behind it. He considered running for it if the skull was lifted, but when Lestrade picked it up, John was froze stiff. The DI's eyes widened tremendously. "John!?"
John wasn’t sure when it had started, but he could feel the tears falling down his cheeks now. Sherlock wasn’t ok, he was dead. Incorporeal, unable to touch things for the most part, unseen and unheard. He was gone for the most part, barely hanging on to reality by a thread and possibly trapped that way forever.
There was a ping sound from John’s lap top, which generally meant he had a new messages, except his computer had been frozen since last night when… Things were starting look a bit suspicious. John grabbed the computer, finding it in perfect working order now.
“Just… Let me look first?” Sherlock had no idea what he might find there, but he had a pretty good suspicion.
Her voice was softer and mousy then ever, “I just wanted to thank you for everything really.” She pulled medium sized box out from under one of the empty cadaver tables and placed it on top.
“I do not imply that at every chance John.” He turned to see John’s bright brown eyes peering deeply into his.
He threw his soaked cardigan on the floor of the dorm, wishing he could just ignore his computer for once but found he really couldn’t. John pretended he wasn’t thrilled to see Sherlock was online, but he knew he was.
Sherlock marched over to the couched and leaned on it, peering over the edge at his furiously blushing boyfriend. “Just come out, you look fine.” He leaned over further and pressed his lips against John’s softly. “Gorgeous even.”
John could feel his fist unconsciously clench, “He’s not why I play the game… it’s just more fun to play with him.” He could feel his phone vibrate in his pocket, it drove him crazy not knowing who the text was from or what he said, but he had to restrain himself.
“Hm? I don’t understand, it is about our life? I suppose I could put in just daily stuff, but then Sherlock says that’s boring and doesn’t like people knowing about those things anyway.” Again he missed his therapist’s implications.
Sherlock smiles at him, “Like you really doubted for a second that I didn’t have something planned?”
"Maria…" John had completely forgotten about his date that night. "Sherlock! You have to get rid her!"
He dried quickly, still thinking of the way Sherlock would look at him through the monitor, those strangely luminous eyes watching him. He was never too sure what color they were, perhaps it was the screen or the lighting playing a trick on his eyes, but they seemed otherworldly. He knew he would finally get a clear view of them today though and John chuckled lightly to himself at the thought.
John put his hands in his pockets as he followed Lestrade in. “Daniel Rogers sent me an email a few days ago. It was before…”
“Couldn’t make it.” he looked back at the body, “Strangled to death by some sort of chord, seems professional. She struggled at first, likely breaking a few rib bones, but died soon after.” He was proud that he could see all that by himself.
“Fifteen minutes John! They probably heard that, get out of there.” Sherlock couldn’t see where the three tarantulas downstairs were hiding, which means they were in somewhere within the wooded rooms he couldn’t see into as well.
“I don’t believe you.” The air from the words ghosted across John’s skin making him shudder.  “You only made me do that experiment yesterday because you knew I didn’t want to do it.” Sherlock backed off and began to pace the room.
“Faking. You’re not mad. You don’t care about the cabbie in the least, nor that I would insult a stranger like that, you are in fact very accustomed to me insulting strangers and don’t mind when I do it. But you almost always pretend to be cross with me, on rare occasions you don’t care enough to even pretend to be though.”
“Your studied have been dropping as of late. You’re not still playing that game are you? The online one?” Ella was holding a pad of paper for jotting notes down balanced on the edge of her knee. He real focus was on John, who was staring out the window and being relatively non responsive.
“I got a message from your blog, it just said that who ever sent it was interested in the case and I should come by today.”
John sat motionless in his chair, bare feet flat on the ground and arms laying flat on the arm rests.
Lestrade was writing everything down, but he wanted something more solid. Some clue that could actually result in a lead.
“Well get him to cut it out.” Lestrade came from behind the taller man and grabbed him by the coat, “Come one, back to the scene.” ‘
“I thought you would be pleased, strawberry is your favorite flavor of jam isn’t it?” He smiled at the large homemade jar before them.
“I thought I would never feel anything below my waist again, it was already terrifying that I knew I would never walk again.”
“What are you-” Greg struggled against them, the suckers marking him there as well now. A fourth tentacle came out, wrapping its length around Greg’s waist. Mycroft attempted to lift him up, but the weight proved to be too much for him as Greg thudded back on to the ground, his head hitting the marble entrance. As much as his head was now ponding, it was useful to remember that these things couldn’t quite lift him. Mycroft huffed in irritation; he didn’t want to injure Gregory. He wasn’t strong enough to lift him yet, but perhaps soon. Until then, he would just have to make due.
Curious, he stood and made his way to the bathroom to peer in the mirror. He could see himself quite well, though he assumed he was likely the only one that could view his own reflection now. He was wearing the same clothes as when he jumped off St. Bart’s. He was sure his corpse was probably not, it would likely have been stripped and left on a mortician’s table by now. There was no obvious cause of death, in fact, he looked rather alive. This made one thing obvious at least, the physical world apparently had no bearing on his appearance now. Though he also considered if he was what one might refer to as a ‘soul’, there was truly no need for clothing. In fact, he likely wouldn’t look like his physical form at all, genetics and souls having little to do with one another, he reasoned. But he couldn’t deny that he really did seem to look the way he always had.
“I do not have some perverse fetish.” Mycroft rolled his eyes, finally able to start retracting the damn tentacle.
Mycroft was furious someone could hold a gun to his brother’s head only to bolt out the door a second later, but he knew there was no time to run after him. The small flat was crumbling around them but he still turned the corner to find an elderly man tied to a chair, luckily he hadn’t been gagged.
“Mhm. Its a bit like paint, used contacts for my eyes- thought it might alarm you if you woke up to floating eyes.”
“I cant- I- fuck, Myc…” Greg let out a shaky breath, hardly able to say anything coherent at all. “Gonna-”
“Drop him?! You’re probably the reason he’s like this to begin with!” Sherlock flinched at this. “You’d probably forget about him or stick him in a jar for experiments you freak!”
John felt dirty. It wasn’t fair that he was alive wasting oxygen when Sherlock had truly contributed to the world. He should be the one buried, not Sherlock. Making a fake ruse to make people believe he was ‘better’ was like betraying that genius’s memory.
Sherlock had only just come back to the waking world, limbs wrapped even tighter around his John when he heard a knocking. He scowled, this was their moment and someone was at their door trying to take it away.
John gripped the dresser harder, his whole body feeling strange and numb. His head jerked to the side, almost as though someone had forcibly moved his head in that direction. He felt like he might panic at any moment, but as he blinked he realized something. There was a thin door. A closet door most likely. The numb feeling suddenly left him. “Have you guys check in there?”
Sherlock’s face was right next to John, slightly lowered so his eyes would be paralleled with the small man.
Sherlock turned and pressed himself firmly against Lestrade, “Rub my back, please please please rub my back.”
“Oh.” John looked down as a blush creeped across his cheeks. Swinging his head over his shoulder he checked that Sherlock was still in his mind palace.
“Oh Lock, you were not meant to live like this. Come here.” John picked him up by the waist and dusted some of the dirt off his coat.
It took Mycroft a moment to answer, his thoughts being elsewhere, repeating what Grace had said to him in his mind. “It’s Harriet, John’s sister… She’s gone missing, the two officer’s watching her lost track and haven’t found a trace of her since last night.”
John smiled “Come on, we have a crime scene to deduce.” He reached out to guide the detective by the arm as he turned to leave but accidentally grabbed his wrist. He loosened his grip “Sorry, I was-“
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Cabbie- you flunked out of high school, your wife thinks you’re not good enough for her and your kids despise you.”
“You could have talked any time you wanted to, you clearly didn’t try hard enough.” Sherlock brought his hands up to his classic thinking pose. “I’ve been doing some research on the subject lately. It seems there is a debate whether a person can be hypnotized to do something against their will or not. Only one study has suggested that it may be possible. John- look at me, this is an important study. What if someone claims they were hypnotized to murder someone? We would never know if that was possible unless-“
Sherlock opened a small Tupperware of casserole and placed it next to John. “I don’t think I’ll find anything here.” He grabbed a fork full of casserole for himself.
Sherlock barely managed to take care of himself, taking care of John was slowly becoming a nightmare. John was like a pet he wanted desperately but knew he couldn't take care of.
“Oh. So you don’t believe in hypnotism then?” If he was lucky he could talk the detective out of this idea.
“Of course I know of it, boring read really, not sure why people read it. Besides, he just posts things I already know about anyway. You’re acting as though this new ‘
“Twenty three-“ it had never occurred to him to ask how old Sherlock was, he knew he was in college now, but he could have been a kid for all he knew before. “You?”
Anderson looked about once more, blatantly confused and alarmed that the taunts seemed to have originated from thin air. Sherlock was so amused with himself that he didn’t see the officer headed straight towards him until he was stumbling to regain his balance after being knocked into.
“Shit, you scared the life out of me.” John panted, trying to catch his breath. “Here, drink this.” He leaned down beside Sherlock, a new glass of water in hand.
John wasn’t sure how long he waited after being pulled away from his deceased friend, just half sitting on the ground watching the paramedics wheel the lifeless body away, people holding him back. He didn’t question the strange actions of those around him, preventing a doctor and the friend of the deceased from getting close. He would later realize how very wrong the whole situation had been, regret his lack of action and taking control. But in the moment, he was motionless. Trapped in his mind replaying everything Sherlock had said moments before jumping.
Mycroft’s eyes snapped back open, their piercing blackness staring at him. The tentacle that Greg had bitten shot forward, forcing its way into his mouth now. Lestrade squirmed, his hands immediately grabbing the thing and trying to rip it out of him. But the digit was far too strong for that and only forced its way deeper, the tapered edge making it to the opening is his throat as his eyes began watering. He tried screaming for Mycroft to stop, but the damn thing was blocking him from speaking. The tentacle that had previously been around his other wrist came back and soothingly stroked his hair, though Greg was too occupied trying to pull the first tentacle out of his mouth to even bother with that one.
“Get dressed properly,” John said in a shaking voice, loosing his composure. He knew that somehow Sherlock wasn’t safe to be around. But he could at least keep him from getting sick for real.
Lestrade whipped his door open, gave grace a death stare, and grabbed Mycroft by the elbow pulling him behind the protection of the door and quickly shut it behind him. He had no intention of giving his ex wife any further attention.
Of course the world’s only consulting detective knew what his phone said already. “I have about an hour and a half.”
John’s fingers hovered over the keyboard hesitantly, he didn’t want to sound too excited over the prospect of seeing Sherlock for the first time. His hand dropped down to the mouse instead, clicking the symbol of the phone instead, waiting nervously as his speaker made an irritating ringing noise.
“No worries. He’s a wanker, just don’t let him get the better of ya.” Lestrade gave John’s shoulder a firm pat.
An hour passed and Sherlock made sure John was dead asleep before he scooted his smaller body against John’s chest and snuggled into him, gleeful when his blogger’s arm subconsciously wrapped around his body.
Sherlock turned bright red, "O-oh... T-that would be nice, yes. My... Boyfriend." He smiled at the word.
He took several steps closer before he could read one of the sea of signs, “Burn in hell fags.” His eyes widened at the realization that the crowd was an anti-gay group. His fists quickly balled up. “Get them the bloody hell out of here!” he sneered at Lestrade.
The entire kitchen floor lay in ruins in a heap of splintered wood. Sherlock had finally found the gnawed out tunnel but no evidence of John.
“aaah” John could barely move, but he looked up at the screen to see what was making the sound, in his haze he hadn’t recognized it. “Shiiiit” the out of place beep was complimenting the musical piece far too well with how it caused the vibrator to move and change. His screen showed that he had accidentally clicked the wrong button earlier when he thought he had turned skype off, it was actually only in his menu bar. “Fuck fuck….” The noise he only recalled now was his skype alerts that Sherlock was messaging him. He knew at this rate his friend was going to make him come.
Sherlock had been in and out of consciousness for some time. He was barely aware that John had been coming in and out of his room all day to check on him. Sherlock managed to sit up, noticing the room was now cast in shadows as the sun had gone down and tossed the sheets off himself as he attempted to reach a glass of water that John must have left for him on the night stand. His aim wasn’t quite right however, and the glass fell to the floor and broke.
“Hardly, if you couldn’t talk on your own the first time for hours after the initial hypnotism then you are clearly very susceptible to some forms of-“
"What!?" Lestrade's eyes went to the nearest street subconsciously thinking that would somehow aid them in finding the boy. "We'll just have to… Sherlock?"
Harry's expression revealed how distressing the detective was, "You must be Sherlock… John told me you might say something like that."
The moment he had, he could smell it. Practically sense it in the salty air around them.  It was that tingly sensation that meant a storm was coming. The Thames wasn’t quite the ocean, but it was connected to it, and Sherlock’s body ached for it.
“Hang on, I’ll get you something.” Greg’s body still felt weak from when the tentacle forced something down his throat. But he managed to get on his shaking legs. “Stay with me, come on.”
“Don’t be daft. That one was personal. But not the actual target. That’s what this is all about. Why they all look similar, why they’re all lesbians. Lestrade don’t you see? The dark haired one- she must have somehow personally known the woman this is all about, that’s why she was killed.”
“John’s been very good, I think I’ll let him out in an hour or so, then he can have one of your biscuits.” Sherlock kissed her cheek and opened the door for her to leave.
when Sherlock came back wearing his loathed deerstalker hat. “You hate that hat.” Was all he could manage.
“John, hurry up, I’m shaking and there’s no way people are so unobservant they wont see the floating water in my hair.”
Any thoughts John had previously that morning about the so called 'perks' of his situation were now firmly gone. Being small was terrifying and he would do anything to be tall again. '
“Well I was desperate and depressed last night! I could very well go out and find a new job before the rent is due.”
“It went off early.” He looked up at the bees still in their place. “Four minutes more for them now. John… I’m sorry. I’m sorry for all of this. For everything.”
“Damn it Greg! Yes! I’m small! I get it! You don’t have to put you damn face so close to me all the bloody time!”
Anyone else would have missed the small smirk Sherlock gave as he wrote down another note. Then pulled the second image.
“Thanks to you.” He smiled brightly. “Now if you don’t mind I’ll be needing that package next to you.”
Sherlock smiled dauntingly up at Molly, “I can and I will. Grab a pen and paper, you will write down questions to be asked exactly how I say them.”
As John caught his breath he looked around, he would have sworn he heard Sherlock’s voice before but of course now he was no where to be found.
A flimsy doll bed complete with bedposts sat in the corner of the room. John grabbed on of the posts and placed his foot on the frame of the bed as he pushed all of his strength into ripping it apart. Had it been a normal bed he would likely have no chance, but luckily doll furniture was made of the cheapest possible wood and didn’t make too much resistance for the former soldier. He gripped the post awkwardly yet firmly and whacked at the limbs that were nearing him.
“John- don’t interrupt. You have been slowly mentioning Sherlock more and more, and no one else. You use to come in quietly, smiling at the receptionist in the hall, even engaged in small talk. But lately you act as if it’s all beneath you. You talk about Sherlock’s work as if it’s your work and how inferior everyone is to Sherlock’s logic. The past few sessions you say they are even beneath your logic. You’re shutting the world out John, it’s very concerning.”
It was the day after his near naked bath experience with his socially awkward best friend and flatmate, that John found Sherlock in the front room focusing intently on his laptop.
“I’m working on a paper.” John frustratingly typed away, school was already starting to burn him out.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock finally got the cage open but John was too distracted to notice. “You can come out now… Do you… do you want my biscuit?” he stretched his hand out offering it not expecting John to eat it from his hand while on all fours, sheet starting to slip.
“Yea… yea, of course.” He gently took Sherlock hand as they walked. “Sorry, uh, if that was too soon.”
“I should have told Greg to grab something of yours. Your scarf or anything.” He would be here soon at least and know something was wrong when John didn’t answer the door. At least he knew help was coming.
Clenching his fists at his side he glanced over towards his closet where he had already set out a more casual suit for the day. He wasn’t sure what John would like, but he was pretty sure it didn’t make much of a difference, people didn’t tend to notice his attire too much.
Greg chuckled, “He’s not that bad. He’s just… not interested in anyone. I thought it was his way of turning me down at first. But then Sherlock’s the same.”
Sherlock turned the tv on and turned John’s chair to face it. “I’ll be in my mind palace, alert me as soon as you can move.”
Sherlock groaned, “oh come on! That was a perfectly stable stack!” He kicked the coffee table they had been sitting at, sending it sliding a few feet.
Moriarty switched cameras to ones in the ally. Smoke began draining from the seems of the warehouse but no one came out. It wouldn’t be long before the bees dies of smoke inhalation, which would make the detective and his tiny associate long dead by then. A fire engine could be heard coming down a nearby street.
John instinctually leaned down and checked the pulse, there wasn’t one. He then checked the body temperature and eyes. “Been dead for approximately 6 hours now.”
Sherlock watched John’s changing expressions carefully, he would see him start to struggle with his thinking process but the calm eventually won over. “So, ready?”
John felt his legs giving out on him as Sherlock stepped towards the edge, dropped the phone they had been speaking on- their only life line to one another. His hands stretched out, he hesitated for a moment before dipping forward off the ledge, and out of John’s life.
The following day Molly smiled softly to herself as she heard the clicking of her new heals as she walked down the tile floor to the morgue. There was no one to really admire them, or rather her in them, at the time, but idea of wearing them and that wonderful clicking sound was already enough to build her confidence a little.
“John?” The light voice didn’t match the loud knocking, John tensed immediately. Maria stepped in and noticed the large dollhouse right away, a smile curling up on her mouth. “John? Are you… in there?” She cautiously stepped closer until she could see him standing in front, her smile widened. “I’ve missed you John, I know it was probably hard to call me.” She eyed Sherlock with a look spewing of venom, but then her smile quickly returned. “You too now? Well, I suppose that isn’t too bad.”
Lestrade held the cheap coffee cup up as non conspicuously as possible. Hopefully no one would notice the small slit he made for Sherlock to see out of.
“Sorry about what? The walk? The lack of exchange of words? I’m hardly offended, just wondering what protocol would be.”
“He’s been texting you hasn’t he? You keep looking down at your phone thinking I haven’t noticed.” She puts her fingers to her temples in frustration. “Just, stop alright?”
Sherlock wrapped his hand around John’s mouth to silence him, “She could crush us in an instant,” he whispered.
Sherlock’s expression dropped and he brought John closer to him, “I know. I don’t either.” He placed a chaste kiss on his doctor’s forehead. “It’s not like… the last one. It’s safe, it’s just until we’re back to normal.”
Mycroft held his umbrella firmly and cautiously approached the dollhouse. He was slightly surprised to find John had already accepted moving into it, but then there was his very rumpled hair and clothes to take in. His eyes softened, but his overall form remained stiff. "Lestrade's phone is off…" he had a hard time looking John in the eyes. "Scotland Yard has been looking for him."
He was almost proud of John’s reply. ‘I hope you realize that Sherlock and I don’t keep secrets from each other.’ He liked to think that this was true. Well, sometimes it was necessary to hide drugs. Or how he would intimate John’s dates at times. But that was all innocent enough. He never thought that This would come up, after all.
John let out a loud sigh, “How would we get from one end to the other? We can’t even open a fridge Sherlock. Until at least one of us is big again we’re going to need some help.”
Sherlock stepped back inside the flat slamming the door behind him, A look of satisfied triumph on his face, not only had he gotten rid of John's date for the night, he had likely ruined all future dates between them as well. The unexpected sound of the door slamming caused John to loose his balance again, two steps later he fell into the hole, it was too dark to tell at first, but it went straight down the wall.
“It’s my fault you decide to accompany me on late night cases that cause you to fall asleep at work? Now really John, don’t be absurd.”
"I brought you this for now, I'll take you there later for something more fitting if you like. I don't know your um, current measurements." Sherlock placed a miniature outfit on the bed next to John. It looked like real clothing but made for doll. John quickly slipped into, already feeling much more comfortable that he at least had some dignity left. It was just simple brown pants and a dark green shirt.
Lestrade was doing his best to brush it off, “Its fine, really. These things happen.” He shrugged. “Locked myself in an attic once.”
“Not entirely convinced you didn’t have a hand in my mood, but yes, I suppose you can tell me to make an arse of myself now.”
“No, but its odd. Feels like more then a coincidence that the report involved rope if it really never happened.”
“Besides. I’ll feed you.” His voice sounded far behind John now, like it was coming from the kitchen.
He was only a few steps away from leaving when he heard a knock at the door. John stopped mid step, focused on the wood before him. The corner of his mouth twitched up a bit. He had heard that, right? A knock… But no, it wasn’t- it couldn’t be- but so many strange things had happened the last couple days and even Molly thought-
“Well, Sherlock’s plan was to steak the place out. Stay in the flat and wait to see if anything happened. Besides, since it’s a case, I’m sure the rent is free for a while as long as I’m investigating.” He wasn’t sure what his plan might be if nothing ever turned up.
“Right… Er, what’s it for then?” John really wished that things would start making sense. He tried lowering his legs from around Sherlock’s waist, but those inky black tentacles were holding them in place now, making him desperately want to squirm away. Especially with his damnable erection.
The last time he had accompanied Mycroft to the hospital he could see how much worse it made John feel. No hospitals this time. Lestrade conducted a one man search of the apartment for any form of narcotics. He got rid of the needle and cocaine before John was aware of himself again. Lestrade spent the night to make sure he was safe and texted Mycroft the developments.
John shook his head, stripped his clothes, and awkwardly climbed into the steamy teacup. Had he not had his back to Sherlock he would have noticed the larger man’s up curling mouth and occasional peek as he pretended to be in his mind.
“There’s a nice café down the street from where I live, we could meet up there and I’ll get you a cup of tea and a pastry.”
Everyone who worked for the Yard seemed to be aware of Sherlock’s aversion to his deerstalker cap, earning him a multitude of gawking looks and whispers.
“Thank you Dr Watson, you have no idea how much this means to me.” Daniel looked as though he were on the verge of tears. “I don’t want to be a failure of a land lord as well.”
"Oh look, the freak showed up alone today. Couldn't get your dog to follow?" Donovan walked over with the sole purpose to mock Sherlock.
“Already trying to get my shirt off? Really Inspector Detective, you should at least offer me a glass of wine first. He cocked his head curiously, watching Greg’s every little movement.
Sherlock bit his lower lip and sat up, John pulling back off him. "I…" he didn't finish his thought and instead looked away.
“Fine now… thank you John.” Sherlock’s eyes watched John’s hand before they flicked up to him, a small smile forming on his lips. “Planning ‘busting me out’ of here?” A glimmer of teeth showed through his smile as he tilted his head forward a bit.
Finally the spider broke through the entrance turning it’s fat abdomen to the side and forced John against the wall, post falling to the ground. The spider pinned him and backed it’s head slightly before it’s strike. John grabbed the leg on him forcing his nails up the joint socket in the exoskeleton. The spider suddenly let go making a noise John wasn’t aware tarantulas could make before then. Without a moment’s hesitation he slid down with his belly now parallel to the spider that launched forward to strike and hit the wall instead of it’s prey.
“You have been seeing your therapist for over a year now and your lack of emotions is worsening yet you haven’t told her about it.”
“How did he text me just now? He obviously didn’t plan for me to find his phone there, but then how and why did he get it there while I’ve been standing here?”
John wrapped himself around him, his hot breath hitting Sherlock’s neck before he licked at it and began lightly sucking. "What would you like us to be? I love you Lock."
The blackness sank away a bit more, his tentacles retreating as he tried to read Lestrade’s expression.
“I thought he hated that hat with a passion.” Lestrade attempted to break the ice with John after their last chat hadn’t ended so well.
Moran had often wondered by what power he had been found innocent. “Looks like he’s in no position to be asking me for shit, don’t you think?”
“Hit his head earlier, he’s just a bit mixed up at the moment.” Sherlock put a possessive hand on John’s shoulder, “Just taking him out for some air.
John’s throat felt as though it was closing off a bit, Sherlock looked as though he was on the brink of tears. “Shh, it’s ok, really. This is about that night isn’t it? When I… saw you’re computer screen?”
Sherlock continued to watch John for any sign of a social que or even hidden clues as to what his next move should be.
John nodded. One moment Sherlock had been there and the next he was just gone. Perhaps that was how it always was when a person died. “I haven’t even heard word about a funeral yet.”
"You'll just be in my pocket John, besides, I don't think it's safe to leave you here alone." Sherlock began calculating all the potentially dangerous scenarios that could befall the miniature John.
Sebastian sprinted back, small vial in hand. He tried keeping a cool demeanor to prevent making his boss any madder then he already was, but the slight widening of his eyes betrayed him. Moriarty’s clothes were pooling around him as his face grew murderous.
“Brilliant.” John could never shake the habit of exclaiming his enthusiastic admiration of the detectives deductions.
“Not entirely true. You seem to be able to talk just fine.” Sherlock wrote down more notes. “A very interesting development really. I had hoped this drug might come in useful for apprehending suspects while still allowing them to talk and thus give away evidence. It seems to be a success! This is great news, you have been most helpful John.”
Sherlock nodded closing the door just before the car sped off. Lestrade spied a camera on a nearby building. "Big brother's watching." He muttered to himself. "Sherlock's to be exact."
The music faded out as Greg reached Sherlock’s bedroom. But as he stepped inside, the violin in the corner shifted and gently tapped against the dresser as though it had just been moved. He carefully picked it up.
“Oh. Thank you…” She looked at the shoes thoughtfully; they really would look nice on her. When she looked back at John he was already halfway down the aisle and leaving quickly.
Sherlock looked up, facing John on the other side of the computer camera, eyes slightly shiny, he could tell John was being sincere. He had gotten particularly good at discerning lies. “You’re into that sort of thing then?”
John rolled his eyes but did his best to raise Sherlock higher, who in turn grabbed onto the seat cushion of the chair and climbed out.
Sherlock was glad his eyes were closed or might have winced at that. Lestrade sent the two a threatening look. A beeping came from the detective's pocket.
Donovan and Anderson strolled in suspiciously too close in time to one another. Sherlock could smell their matching tropical scent shampoo, not the brand Anderson's wife uses he mentally noted.
Sherlock's eyes widened dramatically as he spotted the hole the blender was hiding. He quickly pushed Lestrade out of the way to peer down the hole, but it was significantly too dark.
Dr. Watson has very few possessions of his own, he’s not a materialistic man. Find a way to check the bags if possible. MH
That was right, Sherlock thought. Lestrade was at their flat now. There were numerous items he could grab that might have some effect. He couldn’t exactly hail a cab down though. Could he even make it to the flat on foot from here as a ghost?
But the moment he was trying to figure out why everything was so uncharacteristically quiet. If Sherlock had been alone he would have taken John out or at least talked to him. So that meant people were around but no one was talking.
John crouched behind a barrier peering over the edge with his rifle in hand. He couldn't remember how long he had been in this position or at what point his thick military boots had socked up the water at his feet making him feel heavier and sluggish. Something told him this moment had happened before, that he was somehow reliving the past. In John's peripheral vision he saw a dark figure approach, he swung his gun around and recognized the enemy just before the ear shattering shot rang out.
Lestrade didn’t want to admit that a small part of him felt a bit better now that the closet was safeguarded from ghosts. Possibly witches as well. “Should we salt the main door to the flat too?”
Maria, forgot to tell you, I’ve been very ill for a few days, I went to the store for some medicine, but I’m still to under the weather to see anyone. Sorry about last night.- JW
"Sherlock! She's waking up." John stood at the edge of the table watching Molly. He wanted Sherlock to do more to make sure she was okay, but he insisted she would be fine.
“Mycroft! There’s a man in the back room, ask him where John is!” Sherlock began ripping books off the shelves on the wall opposite of John, he couldn’t hear John shouting his name.
Three days had passed and John came home to a small brown box sitting outside his door. It was the size of the prescription medication his therapist had been prescribing to him for his nightmares of the war. Like always, the box had no description on it other then his name and dorm address on a printed sticker on top. Medicine is considered a personal matter and pharmacies tended not to let information out.
The D.I. hated how strangely turned on that made him. But he wasn’t going to give in. He needed to know that he was more then just this perverted monster he had suddenly become, because the real Mycroft sure as hell would never had said anything remotely like that. “ ‘Croft?” He did his best to speak softly, hoping Mycroft would think he was being submissive.
John began sneaking out at night with his gym bag on a regular occasion. Lestrade was always there to follow him to the gym but never saw him come out. It was an obvious front for whatever he was really doing. He couldn’t figure for the life of him what John had in that bag but he was sure it was connected to his new sporadic shopping sprees.
“Perfectly fine. He walked away from the crash.” Sherlock’s gaze became distant. “He came to see me once when I was out of the hospital. He wanted to take me to another drug den.”
“Alright I suppose. It’s strange going to school again.” John sat stiffly in his chair looking out the large bay windows.
“He’s probably laughing at us right now… come on Lock, I know you love having people listen to you.”
Maria stopped before her hand touched it. “Oh what am I doing! You are so maddening.” She huffed and turned to leave until a hair-raising sneeze came from the skull. Sherlock clenched his jaw.
John nodded, Sherlock really was doing his best. “Fine. But only one.” Even though it was against his better judgment. “Where-”
Twenty minutes went by, Lestrade had several officers out looking for Sherlock, it felt sickeningly useless.
“Hold up- is he hypnotized? I saw something like this on youtube before.” His voice was growing annoying louder, they really didn’t need an audience.
Well, I have some now, plus the files on the other two victims. I’m too tied up at the yard right now to bring them over, but you can pick them up any time. –GL
Even as Mycroft tried to stand, a tentacle wrapped around a bed post, trying to prevent him. He was loosing control of them again, which generally was a bad sign he wouldn’t be himself for long either.
John spluttered and nearly dropped his teacup; he had a very bad feeling about today. “Please don’t tell me you plan on…” he couldn’t bring himself to say the words.
“Sherlock?! God damn it, come out right now.” John stalks off to the kitchen, looking around, then to Sherlock’s room. He looks around confused. “Sherlock?” his shouts have died off to a whisper.
"Get Mrs. Hudson at once, she should have the plans for the building and we can see where the pipes all lead. " Sherlock had his usual monotone 'facts only' voice but eyes were unfocused and glistened with water.
“I’m dead John, by definition I’m pretty beyond help.” Sherlock slumped back onto the sofa. “and I’m fine… just… really bored.”
John nodded and headed back to the living room and plopped down in front of his laptop. Maybe a movie would help. “You are there, right?” He whispered to the near by violin.
John kissed his way down Sherlock's body, hands gently massaging his sides. It took a certain amount of talent to undo pants without the wearer being distracted by it, he landed a kiss on the pale hip bone. How anyone thought something like this was a '
Greg cupped one Mycroft’s cheeks with hand, his thumb gently stroking his cheek bone. “I wouldn’t mind, so long as we’re together in any sense of the word.”
It was wonderful but he could only take so much. The tentacles felt as if they could rip him open. Suddenly, he was gripping the bed as hard as he could, his knuckles going white as he felt Mycroft releasing into him again, It was so much more then the last time. An impossible amount, he thought.
Sherlock held John in his palms the whole car ride back to their flat, never taking his eyes off him. John sat quietly drawing invisible circles with his finger in the giant hands, occasionally looking up to see green grey eyes watching his every movement.
"You're too old for me anyway" she shot a look at Greg's graying hair and spun on her heels to leave. "I hope you're both happy!" the words were dripping with venom.
"I would reconsider what you are implying unless you'd like to be punched in the face." Sherlock straightened his back.
Today was not the final straw. John shook his head but smiled lightly, “I never thought I would do anything so stupid for someone.” He drank it quickly and prepared for the worst.
“No… this is Sherlock, if there was another way, he would have taken that instead.” John took a shuddering breath. Sherlock wasn’t trying to kill himself. He wasn’t sure if that made things better or worse. “Idiot…”
“986 Chapel? I’m on my way. Be there in a moment.” Greg hung up and put his phone back in his pocket. “Sorry John, I have to-“
“These experiments are utterly ridiculous! Not to mention Mrs. Hudson thinks we’re doing some weird BDSM stuff with a cage now!”
“We’ve been over this, we can’t go there on our own Lock, how on earth would we get around?” John hated the thought of going with Mycroft just as much as Sherlock did but they didn’t have much of a choice.
“You’re getting closer John.” Sherlock whispered, waiting for him to tidy up before he could follow him out.
Moriarty snickered as his sniper closed the bag up and went for the door, shoulders blatantly tense despite his attempt at a cool manner. “Oh come on, we both know you’re not leaving.”
“Receptionist at a restaurant, it’s how we met actually.” John didn’t mention he had actually been on a date with another woman who had left him, earning him Maria’s number out of sympathy.
In an attempt to avoid human interaction John ignored Donovan while trailing behind the detective, until she cut him off.
“I thought you knew better by now then to experiment on yourself.” Mycroft grinned giddily as he approached the shorter Holmes.
“Sherlock I don’t think this is working out. I can’t keep doing this, and frankly the hypnosis has got to stop.”
“Already finished mine. I really ought to go though, I’ll be back in the afternoon.” John put down the paper and made for the door, another minute in Sherlock’s presence would surely do him in.
“Right. Time for a cuppa.” John quietly slipped out and headed for the kitchen hoping the previous night would be forgotten.
“Ah, of course,” something seemed off, Mycroft had never checked up on Sherlock this much in all the time Lestrade had known them. “Well, the barrowers are in the morgue looking over a body- Molly’s supervising.”
Sherlock nodded, in a way John's relationship with his sister reminded him of Mycroft. He had brought John's phone with him, thinking it might come in handy, he clicked on Harry's name bringing up the last conversation via text that they had.
“Well I don’t see a body anywhere.” He lifted one of the only remaining pieces of wood up and immediately jumped back with yelp. “Holy mother of god!”
John cut him off by putting a finger up. “Long night last night, I’m going to kip for half an hour, wake me up then and you can do whatever you like to me.” He smiled knowingly.
The house was relatively large and had a prime location on a lake. Sherlock was grateful that Lestrade’s coat pocket was much lower then his own, it allowed him to poke his head out more often without the risk of being caught.
Sherlock looked down in defeat. All John wanted to do was ruffle his dark curls, but instead he stood to answer the door. Before he could reach it however the door swung open as the tip of an umbrella pushed.
“No, no more damn experiments. I’ve really had enough.” John tried to keep calm but it was difficult at best.
“Er, Greg?” John was still focused on the closet. “You didn’t move that rope that was in here, did you?”
Sherlock turned around to continue his experiment but stopped in his tracks before facing John again, his expression completely changed but near impossible to read. "Which beaker did you break?"
Sebastian let out a pained breath as he ran his hands over his face and through his hair. He wanted desperately to call that psychopath and beg for forgiveness, he knew Moriarty would take him back if he did. As ‘changeable’ as he claimed to be, even Moriarty was guilty of following patterns.
He thought it would be horribly awkward to slip in wearing stilettos, fishnets, and a skirt if Anthea was in there. Then again the girl was so oblivious she probably wouldn’t have recognized him even if he wasn’t in full drag.
“Protesters?” John raised a quizzical eyebrow, he didn’t even notice that Sherlock had stopped pacing the crime scene and was listening to him.
No one saw or heard from John for a month but he legally couldn’t be recorded as missing and every few days his credit card would show up as being used at a store.
The attacker chocked and wheezed before gaining just enough breath to talk in a hoarse whisper, “Just a message.”
Suddenly Sherlock was standing in an empty ally surrounded by impossibly tall buildings. There was just enough ambient light to see by but it was otherwise extremely dark and filled with garbage. It looked a bit like the back alleys of London, but he couldn’t think of anywhere in the city that was this garishly painted or had quite so many trash bins. He heard the faint far off call of what sounded like his own voice, ‘Hurry up John! We’re almost there!’ as foot steps splashed through puddles and quickly approached him from beyond the corner. Sherlock blinked rapidly in confusion, he saw himself running around the corner right at him before fading away into nothing. A second pair of foot steps and a heavy panting breath followed, and within seconds John was running around the same corner. He came to an abrupt stop when he saw Sherlock standing there motionless.
Sherlock continued ripping the flat apart until he was sure he had come up with nothing useful. Just a pair of heels some woman likely left in John’s room after a date. He scowled at the thought of John having women over at the flat at all, let alone after his ‘death’ when he couldn’t even monitor them.
“She might not allow it, but alright, you can come. Just don’t be disappointed if you’re told to sit in the waiting room.”
The following day Sherlock and John showed up at a crime scene happier then anyone had ever seen them.
“And obviously you’ve seen through Sherlock’s little charade, so how about you leave now and save yourself some time.”
John cringed at the silly sounding username but flared with rage when he realized this was the man who had forcefully taken Sherlock out of his chair.
Sherlock looked a bit harder, Maria sat eating a light meal at a table across from them with another woman. Blond hair wasn’t exactly an unusual trait for a woman, nor was being short, but the rainbow banner going through the name “Lydia” was a definite indicator that the woman in question fancied other women.
“Relax, I will not do anything to you that will have indefinite affects. Everything is either reversible or will wear off.”
He was very unsure of himself and had yet to realize the overly close proximity of Sherlock in the cab, his question for the genius over dinner still sat awkwardly unanswered.
“I didn’t say that… I’m sorry. Of course you wouldn’t. I dunno. I don’t like this mind stuff frankly.” He glanced up at flatmate who still made no expression. “I’ll consider it.” He knew he was already under some sort of calming or compliancy technique, it was a tad unnerving (or at least had been momentarily before the full affect started) but it could be a bit good at night.
‘Have your way with him and leave me the hell alone. I don’t even want to know what jump of logic you were trying to make, but I will do us both the favor of forgetting you ever said it.’ –SH
“Just go investigate the damn scene Sally.” Lestrade stepped closer to the body and looked around to make sure no one was watching. “Alright, I need your help now.” He whispered.
“I’m only taking a pillow, his were softer and it’s better for my neck.” John told himself as he went in to grab one.
Sherlock had an intent look for a moment. “Food.” It was hard to concentrate, he just knew he had to leave and gather supplies. They already had shelter.
“Everything alright?” He nearly put a hand on the detective’s shoulder, but something held him back.
John was suddenly at ease and shook his head. “Sherlock. I’m such a fool, why didn’t I see it sooner?”
Sherlock clenched his fists and turned to look down the barrel of Moriarty’s gun. He tried to refrain from scowling.
“Why will you stop at nothing to coddle me?” Sherlock scuffed and stood from his makeshift bed. He could see the determined look in John’s eyes though, “Do we have any fish?”
John turned, “As a matter of fact I-“ Sherlock was no were to be seen. Had he only thought he heard his voice? Did he call out from another room?
Sherlock gasped in more air. In his haze, he wasn’t exactly sure what John had said to him or why he left. He only knew that he needed water and he needed it now. As much as he could possibly get. He held onto the door frame, pulling himself back to his feet before stumbling forward again. This time he managed to catch himself on the hallway wall and followed it down to the next door. Sherlock leaned against the door as he tried to regain his barring. The bathroom of course had water and he was so close now. He didn’t bother flicking the lights on as he felt his way into the darkened room. He tried grasping the hand of the bathtub but couldn’t manage to turn it, his strength feeling fully drained from him.
Sherlock let out a loud hiccup and covered his mouth. “I change my mind.” He turned to leave for his room.
John sat at the kitchen table, his hand shaking terribly as he lifted his tea cup to take a sip. The flat had never felt so empty before. He nearly jumped out of his seat when he heard Mrs Hudson come in.
“Don’t worry deary, the old thing needed to be reupholstered anyway.” Mrs. Hudson sat in John’s chair with a teacup.
John seemed to be yelling inflammatory remarks while making wild hand gestures but no sound came out. Finally he pointed at Sherlock with dagger like eyes.
A deep groan escaped his throat as he fell back into the couch opposite John, “It may or may not cause you to shift shape.”
“You can say it you know. I made sure that you will only do something if I’m the one that commends it. Wouldn’t want to be irresponsible after all. Oh, and don’t be surprised if you find everything I ask to be highly suggestible for a while.”
John grabbed the detective and pulled him away, “I’m so sorry, he’s uh, not been feeling to well actually and well, he’s a tad out of it-“
So it really was that serious. John sighed, knowing it wasn’t Sherlock’s fault that he was being left out of the loop again. Besides, maybe that daft genius would explain himself later once Mycroft was gone. “Fine, but I hope you realize that Sherlock and I don’t keep secrets from each other.”
Mycroft stepped in “John, I know you’ve stopped seeing your therapist, it’s really time you go back to-“
John stretched his back overly dramatically for affect and cracked his knuckles against the speaker before typing furiously. Sherlock didn’t need to believe him, in fact, it made it more fun this way. It wasn’t long before Sherlock’s screen was overlaying his own and he could see what he was up to. A small image of himself on camera was in the corner, he smiled briefly at his devious plot to get revenge for the time Sherlock had hacked his computer, even if all he would see was a few boring reddit articles. His eyes navigated over to the main part of the screen that Sherlock seemed to be focusing so intently on.
John sighed, “Fair enough I suppose.” He licked his lips, “I thought those would have gone away by now.”
"Sure, what should I tell her if she asks why?" Lestrade was beginning to feel more like a nuisance then that he was helping, but he also couldn't just leave the sociopath.
John placed Sherlock in a chair at the table and cleared away some of the science equipment. “I’ll bet one of my jumpers will fit you better.”
Sherlock sat on his knees behind John and rested his chin of the soft blond hair below him, wrapping his arms around John’s shoulders. He wasn’t good with sentiment, but he would try his best for John. With Sherlock wrapped firmly around him, John let out a breath, he knew his detective didn’t like repeating himself and he had a;ready promised they would find Harry.
“Rude, what if I was doing something private?” John clicked the call button, allowing Sherlock to see and hear him.
“Yes… it should seem so. The victim was viciously pulled by her hair, lacerations on her face and arms.”
“Oh God!” John hit his prostate dead on, it was almost enough to make him cum but he held back, not wanting to finish so soon. “Fuck…” he slowed down a bit, it was time to see what this toy could really do. John swallowed thickly, glad that his desk and computer were close enough so that he only needed to lean over to press ‘play.’ It didn’t matter too much what song he picked, only the actual beat mattered, control the sensation inside of him. He had hit a random song, The Cloud Atlas Symphony, John wasn’t even sure when or why he had downloaded it. The results were instant. The toy inside him began vibrating, slowly at first but it built up and intensified so powerfully. He was sure he had never played the song before but somehow it was eerily familiar to him, comforting in a way he had never known.
Sherlock attempted a few preliminary tests just to make sure John was under and was reacting positively to his demands. Again Sherlock noticed it was going a bit smoother then the first time.
“Red looks good on you. Uh, those there, the pumps, would be lovely on you.” He looked away and did his best to be nonchalant.
A small crash came from the front room, causing Maria to dash back in. “Damn it John” Sherlock muttered under his breath.
I just realized I never posted some chapters I had already written. Sorry about that. I stopped updating this on the other account as well, but never abandoned it. So new chapter on both accounts soon.
“That is strange… but I’m afraid I can’t help, Sherlock…” John cleared his throat, there was a strange breeze that only hit his neck. No… not breeze, breath. It was exactly like the numerous times that Sherlock would come up behind him and whisper something important in his ear. John swallowed hard, trying his hardest to keep from turning around, no one was there, he was sure of it.
“You’re doing it wrong and you’re going to poke me in the eye with the brush! At least take my heels off already.”
“Lovely isn’t she? There’s six Goliath Birdeaters in there. So that makes five more that haven’t been fed in some time now. Oh! And how could I forget! You get to play along too! Just look above you.”
The closet door was blocked by a semi clear white shield. He ran his hand over the strangely glossy surface. This was an interesting development at least. He tried kicking at the salt, but the shield prevented him. It seemed it really did have some metaphysical importance.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes in anger at first but decided against an insult, “Clearly you woke up due to the lack of my violin playing, so you are hardly to blame for your vile mood right now.”
“Well I’ve muddled up the results I can see.” He stroked the tabby’s head and John leaned closer to nuzzle him. Sherlock picked the cat up and sat on the couch with it. “What am I going to do with you?”
Mycroft pushed a button. The car came to a halt and John immediately bolted out and ran down the street- an impressive feat considering the height of his heels.
That was too far. John stood up and pushed Sherlock’s second hand barrier aside. “MARIA!” he had his commanding Captain John Watson voice. “That’s enough! Just leave, please.”
"Can't, he's asleep." Sherlock attempted to shut the door again but Maria had stuck her foot in the way, preventing him from doing so.
“If this is to do with a certain young man I’ve heard you chatting with on your computer, it certainly does.”
“Your spine?” Sherlock went to remove the sheet but as he touched John the smaller man doubled over in pain and clutched his head with both hands. “Shh, calm down, you’re going to be ok” Sherlock dropped to his knees and tried reassuring him. Still in pain John tried to crawl onto Sherlock’s lap. “John no, get off! I’ll give you another pastry.” He tried shoving him off earning him a bite on the hand. “Damn it John!” Sherlock stood up quickly, leaving John to fall back to the floor and hide under his sheet.
Mycroft’s mouth tightened all the more as he tapped the metal tip of his umbrella on the floor. “Not this.”
Were curses real? John wasn’t honestly sure. Last week he would have assured Daniel that he was being ridiculous and that was impossible. But now, well, he wasn’t sure what was and wasn’t real anymore. “I’m sure that’s not the case,” he attempted a chuckle that probably came out as more of a nervous reaction. “Besides, there’s sure to be an answer to this and I’m here to solve it.”
Anthea held her phone up for Mycroft to see. There was an image of a jam jar and inside what appeared to be a sleeping John Watson.
John frowned as their meal was interrupted by his phone, it was a reminder that he had promised to see Ella again today since he hadn’t stayed the full session yesterday.
As the days went by John had showed up more and more to crime scenes and solved nearly all of them in truly impressive time. He wasn’t as good as Sherlock, but he was the next best thing and still better then anyone else alive.
John blushed furiously. He hadn’t even thought that one day he would meet the rest of Sherlock’s family and the realization that he would likely still be five inches tall only made his anxiety worse. “Maybe it’s not a good idea… you don’t want to startle her or make worry after all…”
John woke early, frantically showering and thinking about what would happen today. He stood under the hot spray of water far longer then he had planned on. What if Sherlock didn’t like him when they met? That he wasn’t the person Sherlock thought he was? He had been getting a strange sinking feeling for a while now that there was something Sherlock had been hiding from him, though he couldn’t think of what it was. Why was he seeing a therapist? There was nothing wrong with that of course, but people didn’t see one for no reason at all. Sherlock had a secret, and John so desperately wanted to know what it was, to tell him that whatever he thought was wrong probably wasn’t and alleviate some of his concerns. But he wasn’t sure if he could, whether it really was a big deal or not. The very thought of what Sherlock might be hiding was starting to eat away at him slowly.
Sounds potentially fascinating, come to 221b Baker Street tomorrow afternoon, bring anything you might have that pertains to this problem.
John’s mobile went off, “Can you hand me my phone? That’s probably Jenny asking about our date.” Sherlock picked it up and looked at it for a moment.  “I have to somehow explain why my crazy flatmate has drugged me and is making me watch porn so I can’t make it.”
Greg’s flat was an absolute mess after Sherlock had died. There were old case files laying all about from cases he had the late detective help him with. Each one of them were only solved because Sherlock was there for input. There was no way one person could possibly fake that much work. He had to right this, however he possibly could.
“We sort of need your help, we got lost and we’re trying to make it back home. Or well, at least somewhere safe.”
A scream broke the tension and Lestrade immediately looked at the dead woman sprawled across the grass.
“Er- everything ok?” John eyed where the phone landed, not sure how Sherlock’s brother could have pissed him off so much this time.
“How could I have ever thought it was too soon for jam?” A chuffed John sat crossed legged licking thick jam off his hands.
Sherlock blinked not understanding what the impossible woman wanted now until she held her hand out toward him. “No. Absolutely not.”
Lestrade walked past her, he didn’t come all this way to not look at a crime scene. He nodded for John to follow him. “I think its time you told me why you were coming here today.”
Mycroft’s smile widened. “You never cease to amaze me with the feats you manage with my brother Dr. Watson.” Turning back toward Sherlock he added. “Well I’ll leave you alone until you are more willing to leave your flat. It’s been fun seeing you like this again. Until later.” He waved dismissively and left.
“At least no one can accuse you of being vanilla,” Greg attempted a small chuckle but it turned into a whimpering moan as he felt the tentacle still lodged inside of him pulling out slowly. Shite, he really hoped this didn’t mean scary pervy tentacle Mycroft was back.
“It looks good, on you I mean, erm, not everyone can pull it off, you do…” he started fumbling over his words, Sherlock caught on and flashed a bemused smile. John raised his hand to run it through his hair and hide his slightly flushed expression
