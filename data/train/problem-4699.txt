Because, yes the town wolf elders painted a horrid picture of these forests to them whilst growing up. Particularly, about the wolves that walked these forests. But, Dean, Sam and John were different.
“Cas, I insist, please.” The man smirked, “Besides, my mom always said that the one that doesn’t cook, gets to do the dishes. So, let me do this, please.”
alpha named, Balthazar?”
But, later that night, he learnt that being royalty came with privileges. Ones that entitled the prince to whatever pleasures the alpha so desired. One that commoners must adhere to, lest they be punished for failure to serve.
There were double scoffs from both Bobby and Rufus. Of course, Rufus the smart mouth retorted, “Who you calling an old man, Ellen! I bet, even now, you wouldn’t be able to resist a crusty piece of junk like me!”
(See the end of the chapter for
He had decided to join his surrogate dad for breakfast at his Auto Repairs Shop. The minute he parked Baby, Bobby, came bustling out, and wrapping him in a tight hug. “Boy, it took you one whole week to come and see me! You’re lucky Ellen didn’t come over to your apartment, just to give your behind a spank!”
. To any human it would seem like a cold, lifeless and eerie place. There was also the metallic stench of blood and the occasional growls that would make someone’s heart leap out of their chests. What lurked in the dark would make any human crap themselves- if they found out.
He watched them kiss hungrily, strip hastily, all in their naked glory, before Dean threw her onto the straw bed. He watched how Anna spread her legs apart toying with her hair covered sex, while Dean just growled, jerked himself and watching her with a hungered growl.
His heart was pounding and this dreadful feeling churned in his gut.
ignored! Just like he ignored them every time they
any justice?
Castiel pulled out his specially crafted triangular silver blade, holding it in front of Dean and Lee, “I think I can take care of myself, Dean".
No one!
The brown eyed wolf,
He couldn’t help it, now was his time.
Dean loved to look at his kind- Lycans- as more sensible, intelligent beasts. Whereas, the Lycans cousins, Werewolves- were mindless, killing machines filled with wrath and complete destruction.
. He found himself reaching out and running a finger down the side of his omegas face, carried away with how in awe he was of such a selfless omega, “Are you even real? Jesus, how did I get so lucky hmm, it is a privilege to have such a beauty so pure in heart and soul for a mate.” He was truly captivated and mesmerized.
He murmured right next to the man’s ear, “Now, I want you to hit the solid number 6 ball that’s very close to the pocket, in the right hand corner. However, you have to alternate your focus from the cue ball, to the ball you want to knock in. Like you’re calculating its direction of travel”. Of course, he was the one to take aim, as he was guiding Cas. He added, “Now, you’ll feel it in you, just how much power you need to hit the white cue ball with, in order for it to hit its target. Feel it in your arms”. He guided the stick back and took the hit. The cue ball hit the number 6 ball, sinking it into the pocket.
The way Castiel’s eyes lit up at those spoken words- the excitement he saw in those baby blues- made him wonder how often Castiel had been spoken to with such admiration? But, the smile was even more captivating.
rut. Which means, it was going to be an intense and scary one.
He checked out the final dining table setup.
He held out a crooked elbow, “Walk with me through the orchid gardens, my angel?”The smile that spread across the omegas lips was reflecting a hint of surprise and joy, those blue eyes peered at him like he was trying to see into his soul too.
Dean smirked and scooped a squealing Cas into his arms. He carried his omega bridal style to the barn across from the house. At least there they would be able to scream, shout and moan out loud without caring about anyone listening. Not that they cared when they were in the mood.
Dean would make a great alpha mate to Cas someday, well if he isn’t already being one right now. The young alpha knew that the happenings within the last few days were bigger than him. Good, responsible alpha his oldest made.
Whoever said that
“Ok good!” Castiel placed the contract into a file before slipping it into a nearby filing cabinet. The man got back to his computer and started moving the mouse around, clicking away, “I’ll print out a copy of your contract, for your safe-keep and references”.
John grit his teeth, squaring his shoulders- facing the challenge of another alpha. “I gave you advice that was part and parcel of being in this pack, Dean!”
“Scare you!? How about me, almost having a damn heart attack when I laid eyes on Jimmy’s replica back there, Bobby!”
The Milton Coven was the only other vampire family in Lawrence. They were much smaller and less powerful than the Novak Coven. Normally, the pack would keep their distance- hunting in the only 20% of the city limits they were permitted to, by the Novak coven. The Milton’s were also descended from Marcus Novak- however, their blood ties were mixed with other vamp clans- becoming fourth generation descendants of the original and first vampire- Marcus Novak. Only a few remaining vamps of the Milton family formed close bonds with the Novak’s. Well, as of now, there was only one- Gabriel Milton.
Now was not the time for questions. All he could think about was sinking himself deep into the omegas soft, wet cavern. His cock gave a hard twitch at his thought, the pheromones in the air making it impossible to think straight. He couldn’t wait any longer.
He leaned in and laid another peck on Dean’s lips, before grabbing the man by the crook of his arm, “Come on handsome. Let’s have some dinner.”
Michael meets the Winchester Wolf Alpha. Sam and Gabe text each other.
Sam nodded once again, “Yes dad. This is clear.”
A/N: Apologies that I haven't been able to update earlier. I had funeral arrangements to plan out for my father. Anyway, now that all is over, I am going to focus on my fics once more.
That’s when all hell broke loose and an epic war, that stemmed hundreds of years between Lycan joined by Werewolf vs. Vampires began.
There were many gorgeous omegas around, some seizing him up as if he were some delicious meal on a platter, yet, they didn’t smell right nor did they seem like his type. And most importantly, he had a gut feeling that they wouldn’t get along with his son. He for one wasn’t going to subject his kid to a life of misery.
“Next time, we go in our wolf forms, yeah?”
Cas did that cute tilted head thing he loved to do, when he got curious or had an idea to present. The blue eyed man’s next words had his heart skipping beats. “Maybe, I can make a home cooked meal for you someday, Dean. I’ve gotten good at it”.
Butterflies.
She beamed and clapped her hands together. “Ok good! Now, who’s up for some hot chocolate and freshly baked apple pie!?”
His protective side kicked in. He heard the scuttling of pawed feet on their varnished wooden floor. He turned around just in time to see Dean skid to a halt in the kitchen. He instantly caught sight of whatever was clamped between his eldest sons snout.
Gabriel was nearly intimidated.
John spares a glance at Castiel, green eyes meeting his blues,
’. He randomly asked, “Do you like bees?”
He and Balthazar grew closer, dating for nearly 8 months now. Soon, it'll be Christmas!
He giggled, “Yes, Dean. Let’s.”
Not when you were an omega of the
He watched as the green eyed alphas snarl slowly disappeared, only to tilt its head curiously to the side, studying the younger brown eyed wolf, questioningly. Meanwhile, the older wolf with strands of silver grey fur embedded in between its black fur- just stood there, leaving the two alphas to whatever was going on.
He watched for several minutes until they were locked and coming hard together. Then out of nowhere, he remembered releasing the most embarrassing sound through his mouth, as slick started pouring out of his hole. It was then that he saw Dean’s concentration shoot his way. It was then he saw how green eyes scanned his covered form with renewed hunger and want. He didn’t know where he got his courage from? But, he dared lower his cover, meeting Dean’s green eyes.
Cas was silent. He could feel the omegas scent sadden. He tried to reach out with his alpha within to soothe its omega.
Who could it be? He knew no one with an apple pie scent!
for all his brains and punctuality towards his schoolwork, ended with him working in the towns best bakery, baking pastries and brewing coffee.
One of the commoners that lived at least several kilometres away. A humble 30 year old who was willing to accept and mate her no matter what. Dean wasn’t going to restrain Anna from the one who was meant for her. Not for his sexual needs nor desires. He had also changed his tune- he would start showing Castiel affection- a little on the adult side.
I hope you enjoy!
. He could tell, from the corner of his eyes, that Dean’s great alpha head was equally perked up- watching them in curiosity.
He and Baby on the road, felt so good.
So, the next big thing was to approach mom and
Chuck’s jaw dropped and the mumbling of gossiping guests began. The Milton Pack leader stuttered, “No! You must not taint the fantastic bloodline of the Winchester Pack!”
. He then caught his fathers glassy eyes. The town alpha nodded, signaling that it was time to leave. He believed he was ready enough to too. He nudged Dean’s snout with his wolf nose,
He was bouncing on the balls of his feet, not really realizing, until his dad laid a gentle grip on his elbow, gruff soothing tone whispering, “Son, calm down.”
Michael nodded, eyes shifting to Dean and Castiel.
Napier and the other death dealers were taking too long. It has already been 4 hours and they haven’t brought Castiel back to him.
Sammy nodded, eyes filled with soft agreement, “Yeah, me too, Dean.”
“Ha-Ha-Ha, Sammy! Whatever.”
It was quiet for at least a minute. He wondered what was going through Cas mind at the moment. He didn’t have to wait long for an answer. Cas quietly and timidly asked, “Dean, may I sleep in your arms tonight? I would love to hear the beat of your heart and fall asleep to it’s rhythms.”
Dean comforted him with the words,
And so he tried. He really did.
to be here….made every ounce of anger and irritation fly out of him.
earlier this year, in his alpha biology and sex ed. classes. He was in a rut. And, not just any rut……it was his
Castiel responded, “Hello Mr. Campbell”. His eyes kept drifting towards the unresponsive omega. He felt his alpha stir and whine.
He nodded then turned his attention to Dean. The alpha looked hopeless and scared. He had never seen an alpha looking so scared before, this was a first for him. With great difficulty, he said, “ I will give you your time to speak, Dean. Not today or this week though, I need time and you need to respect that. If we run into each other, do not ask me when. I will tell you when.”
He loved getting his scent all over Cas.
The wolves unimpressed stares burned through his entire being- chastising and judgmental.
Dean could only roll his eyes at his cousin and boyfriend’s petulance. He pinched the bridge of his nose, “Guys, we have more pressing matters at hand. My dad would have sent his best scouts and they're
They also took from the northerners their precious omegas.
Ok here goes nothing.
“You’re welcome, Cas”. He cleared his throat and said, “I enjoyed your company too”. He licked his lips and shyly muttered, “We should do this again. Lunch or dinner? Maybe, um- dinner, somewhere?”
Castiel moaned out, “Ok alpha”.
The purr in Dean’s chest could be heard loud and clear- a deep satisfied rumble of affection. But then, the sniffing stopped and next he felt his alphas canines suddenly sink into his neck, just underneath his ear. All Castiel felt was euphoria- floating on a cloud of peace and pleasure. His omega wolf reaching out to it’s alpha wolf finally becoming one- feeling the love it’s alpha felt, feeling the arousal it’s alpha felt, feeling the want its alpha felt, feeling the heart rate it’s alpha had.
He and Bal had decided that they’d have a little fun in his bedroom, while Mary and John were out on a date and Sam was at a friend’s place for the night. They had at least 2 whole hours before Mary and John returned.
“Anna Novak is a young, highly fertile, omega that can bear you dozens of pups. The Council has chosen well for you, Dean".
. He barked, “John was ok with Gabriel, Dean! Nothing happened!”
Everything right now felt numb. He was so confused as to why he was reacting this way-
Oh my God!
Mary and John have that long overdue chat with the boys, clarifying a few things....
Hope. He saw hope. And, he felt it in his heart.
. Our pack is not only made up of Winchesters, but, other smaller packs that have wed, mated or chose to join into ours as per our ties of friendship; such as the Campbell’s, the Laffite’s, the Singers, the Harvelle’s, the Bradbury’s, the Baum’s, the Fitzgerald’s, the Myer’s, the Turner’s and a few others. You are friends with a few pups of these great families who all come under the Winchester Pack. Our pack do not shove away those who are in genuine need and most importantly, we do not let a bad apple sit and rot the other good bunch.”
in their closets.
This is a longer chapter. I hope you enjoy!🙂 Please, let me know your thoughts🙂
Dean only cracked a full laugh, resting a palm on his mid back, and guiding him towards the entrance, “Yup tiger! Soon, you’ll be chomping down on Lawrences’ finest burgers”.
“Well then. See! You’re definitely a lucky guy to be eating delicious home cooked meals! If I had a choice between takeout and home cooked meals; I would choose the latter.”
Again without looking at anyone, he nodded and said in the lowest- most emotionless voice (sounding almost flat), “Thank you.” Then, he was getting away from every single Winchester seated around the dining table.
Dean, being the gentleman he sometimes is, goes around to the passenger door with Castiel still hand in hand and opens the door for him, helping him sit down finally letting go as Cas’ ass hits the leather seat. “Ya know you’re such a gentleman when you wanna be.” Cas mentions before Dean closes the door and makes his way to the other side of the car, making sure Cas can see him roll his eyes with a smirk on his lips. Sliding beside Cas and settling in front of the steering wheel and Cas snuggles in closer and Dean starts up the car.
“Dean, I found an apartment that we can afford.” Cas says happily as he turns his laptop screen towards Dean, pointing to a dingy and a definite fixer upper apartment not too far away from their school. “It’s a bit gross and needs some fixing, but I think we can handle it.” Cas gives a half smile trying his best to be positive, moving a hand to hold Dean’s and rubs circles with his thumb into the skin there, trying to comfort him and assure they’ll be ok. They have each other, they’ll be ok.
“You’re doing good, keep going Cas.” Dean says encouragingly and keeps a hold on Cas’ hips, much to Castiel’s appreciation. Cas climbs a little more and Dean moves his hands slightly away to see if Cas is ok but Cas protests.
“Oh alright. Why are you guys laughing?” Gabe asks and Charlie just shakes her head and waves her hand as to say ‘never mind’ and Gabriel shrugs it off, thinking maybe it’s an inside joke between Charlie and Lucifer. So oblivious.
“Dea- oh sorry, hey um, do you think you could drop me off at Gabe’s after the movie, we’re gonna have a sleepover…” Sam mumbles looking anywhere but at his brother.
“Goodnight Dean, love you.” Cas says sleepily and drifts off quickly into a deep sleep.
“Yea of course, we’ll rest often. There’s actually quite a few cave-like dips in the mountain so we can go in those to take breaks.” Dean says as he looks down at Cas, seeing how he’s doing.
“Dean Winchester? Where have I heard that name before?” Bobby asks in thought, to himself mostly, through the phone.
“Cas?” Dean whines and grabs one of his lovers hands placing it on his hard-on that strains through the thong, his red and leaking tip sticking out at the top of the waistband.
“Don’t worry about it Cas.” Charlie says and they move on. “I can too.”
“Dean, what happened?” Cas’ walks up to his boyfriend and sets a comforting hand on his shoulder, tilting his head awaiting Dean’s response with worry on his soft features.
“Oh my gosh Lucifer… you didn’t even pick a movie? Well then I’m picking it, I know the best movies after all, right Cas?” Dean says cockily as he looks at his boyfriend under his arm.
“Alright let’s get this started!” Jody says enthusiastically into the microphone with a smile on her face and everyone starts clapping. Jody goes through the names of graduates and then comes up to calling Charlie’s name and as she hears her name be called she jumps up from her seat and runs up to the stage and accepts the certificate with great appreciation and shakes Jody Mills and Donna Hanscum’s hand as she exits the stage and walks back to her seat. As she sits down Dean, Castiel and Lucifer all smile and congratulate her. As Jody lists off more names she comes to the Krushnic children, first calling up Castiel. He looks over at Dean in surprise and Dean smiles big at him ushering him to go up on stage so Cas just about runs up there, accepts the certificate, shakes Jody and Donna’s hand and skips back to the friend group them all congratulating him and Cas even cries a little out of happiness, next Lucifer goes up, not as enthusiastic as Cas but he is happy and when he comes back with the rolled paper Cas cries more, being so proud of Lucy, embarrassing him a little, but Cas doesn’t care he’s happy. When Dean’s name is called and after he gets his paper and takes his seat again Cas hugs him hard and cries, once again, all over Dean’s gown making a small wet patch on the upper chest area, Dean just hugs his boyfriend and soothes him, calming him down.
“Fuck yes.” Dean says and tries to push back onto the finger, before he can though Cas removes it and grabs a bottle of lube from the nightstand and pours some on his fingers. “Wait Cas, can you uh-” Dean hesitates and bites his lip.
“Alright, we’re here!” Dean announces as he pulls up into a wooded area with a giant rocky mountain sitting in front of them and as Cas looks up at it, he swears he sees some rocks crumble and fall down the mountain, he swallows and shakes himself, preparing for the climb, he’s not gonna let a little crumble of rocks falling stop him. They’ve done this lots before, they can do this too, no big deal.
“Cas!” Dean yells over the many other voices of the teens of Sioux Falls High, waving his hand over the crowd of bodies surrounding him and the table he sits at with his and Cas’ friends; Sam Winchester, Dean’s younger brother of four years and dreams of the day he can go to Stanford and become a lawyer, Charlie Bradbury, a nerdy redhead with a bubbly personality and is openly lesbian, Lucifer Novak, Cas’ older brother (who was held back a year for not doing his work, which is now being done due to Cas tutoring him) Lucy for short, who is kind of chaotic at times and has a dark personality, very suiting for his name and is currently trying to get Sam and Gabriel together with the help of Dean and Cas, and last but not least, Gabriel Novak, Cas’ younger brother brother by four years, same age as Sam, he is a very goofy, candy loving well, trickster.
“Ya know one day we’re both gonna have heart attacks due to the amount of bacon and grease we consume.” Cas quirks his brow, looking at Dean, already three fourths of the way done his breakfast, Cas finally taking a bite of his.
“Dean…” Cas starts, Dean knows what he’s going to say but stops him.
“I can go, Gabe are you gonna come with?” Sam asks nervously.
“Wait, are you going somewhere tonight, other than the movies?” Gabriel asks curiously.
“Dean! Don’t let go of me!” Cas freaks out and loses his balance a bit but doesn’t quite fall.
Today is graduation day. The sun is high and bright shining down on the soon to be graduates of Sioux Falls High, birds chirp as they fly overhead in the slightly breezy sky. Kids are talking amongst themselves as they sit on foldable chairs on the football field, giggling and joking around as they wait for principal Hanscum to announce they will start the actual graduating portion of the event. The graduates wear a green and blue gown along with a cap, some kids fanning themselves due to the early summer heat with their caps or hands. Castiel, Dean, Lucifer and Charlie all sit together, occupying the same row as they talk together about Sam and Gabriel getting the guts to get together and Dean jumps in saying he was the one to make Sam get the nerve to do it. “Hey, I’m the one who made Sam ask. I even bribed him with a ride down the road in Baby.” Dean brags as he leans back in his chair putting an arm around his boyfriend who snuggles into the side of him.
“Yea, let’s watch a movie. Die Hard?” Cas suggests knowing Dean loves action movies and Die Hard of course.
“Hell yea, when have I ever said no to Die Hard?” He says rolling his eyes, bringing two cups and the Coke over to the end of the bed where they both slide down to sit on the floor instead. They pull up Netflix and Dean goes back to get the berries, wash them off and get the whip cream as well.
Everyone gets their snacks, soda and popcorn and walk down the brightly lit hallway with their tickets in hand, handing them to the ticket lady then making their way to theatre room number 12.
“It was fine, how about you?” Dean responds as he does some stretching and cracks his knuckles.
“What about us?” Charlie asks as she crosses her arms.
“Well, good job bro, I’m so glad Gabe has stopped mopping around that he and Sam aren’t dating yet,” Lucifer starts as he rolls his eyes but then sighs saying, “but now all he talks about is how much he loves Sam and he tells me everything about him, he won’t stop talking about him.”
“I love you Cas.” Dean says and pushes his hands partially under Cas’ sweater vest that matches so vibrantly with Dean’s moss green eyes that now protrude into Cas’ ocean blue ones with what Cas thinks is all the love in the world and it makes his heart warm and tingly.
They pull up to the Winchester’s house and Dean turns out his headlights as he drives into the garage so as to not wake anyone up with his high beams shining in the windows. Dean sees both his dad’s truck and his mum’s SUV in the garage as well and he mentally curses in his head that they’re home, wanting to have just had a night with him and Cas. So long to that idea.
“Wait-”
“Hey, you remember the first time we did rock climbing?” Dean asks as he takes the last bite of his sandwich, his cheeks looking like a chipmunk as he chews. Cas nods still eating his food. “Heh yea, I remember you were so scared, I had to hold you on the indoor wall. You wouldn’t let me let you go.” Dean sighs in nostalgia and smiles up at Cas as he reminisces.
“You ok Cas? You look like you’re gonna cry.” Dean notices and pouts a little as he pulls Cas into his side hugging him slightly as he does so.
It’s the last year of high school for Castiel Krushnic and Dean Winchester, and also their last year at home, even if they don't know it yet.
It’s no secret Dean likes to wear panties every now and again, he just likes the feel and look on his figure, no harm in that right.
“Hahaha.” Cas laughs sarcastically. “We’re not doing anything, stop thinking like that guys.” Cas says and continues his way to his room, grabbing his messenger bag and slipping off his shoes before going upstairs and into his bedroom.
“Cassie! You survived!” Gabriel exclaims from across the table and Cas just rolls his eyes.
“Oh.” Is all Cas breathes out as he looks over at Dean and sees exactly what Dean is referring to, as there is a slight tent in his pants. Cas’ face turns beet red and he looks down to the floor trying not to think of getting down on his knees in front of Dean and just- Cas shakes his head and tries to calm himself down as well now.
“It’s ok baby just ask.” Cas smiles and waits for Dean before doing anything more.
“Mum I-” Dean starts but gets cut off again by his mothers overbearing voice as she leans forward in the chair she currently sits on the edge of.
“Moose!” Gabriel gets Sam’s attention and Sam whips his head over to his friend beside him. “Why are you always staring at me?” He asks genuinely. Gabe is kinda oblivious that Sam likes him, the rest of the friend group know they both like each other but they don’t know they like each other. Charlie and Lucifer are currently trying to get them together though.
“Yea why not. What are we gonna be seeing anyway?” He questions and Lucy just shrugs.
“Yes, I am, tonight will be so much fun!” Cas says with vigor and smiles a gummy smile at Dean which makes Dean smile right back.
“What? I don’t get it, what was funny?” Cas asks, getting frustrated now.
“Yes, I said you can drive Baby.” Dean shifts uncertain on his feet, arms crossed.
Dean wakes up from a nap by Sam’s voice yelling, “Dean!” and Dean groans, rolls his eyes and gets up from his bed with hesitancy hoping it has to do with Sam and not his father.
“So, shall I buy more lingerie?” Dean asks with a smile as Cas looks up at him, settling on his elbows.
“Well, let’s go do something till Dean comes to pick us up. We could play a board game or something?” Gabe suggests walking over to the pantry where they keep their board games and other activities they could do. “How about a game of soccer?” He asks with a hopeful smile as he lifts the ball up turning towards his two older brothers. They both shrug in agreement and they all walk to the back door to play in the backyard.
“Bitch.” Dean responds.
Now it’s Dean and Cas’ time to roll their eyes as they look over at Lucy and make their way to walk to the theatres exit, hand in hand. The rest of them follow and all get into the Impala, Dean drives them home and drops off Lucifer, Sam and Gabriel at Cas’ and they wave bye to each other, Dean telling Sam ‘Be good and don’t get into trouble Sammy!’ before he drives away with just Cas left in the car.
“Oooo!” Both brothers say, smirking and giggling.
“Rock climbing? When did you book this?” Cas asks, trying to think of when Dean could have done such a thing.
They pull into a parking space and Dean cuts the engine, letting everyone out of the car and locking it once everyone has exited the 67 Chevy. “Alright so this is my treat for everyone so no one’s paying but me, ya hear!?” Lucifer speaks up as they enter the building, making everyone turn in shock at the sudden act of kindness from Lucy, the usual mean, menacing, rude and selfish guy he is. “What? I can’t be nice once in a blue moon?” Lucy snaps folding his arms in annoyance, scuffing his black and red converse on the tile floor.
“Eh, if eating bacon is how I go, screw it, that’s pretty awesome in my book.” He says as he gets up opening the fridge holding out a bottle of apple juice, shaking it slightly in his hand in Cas’ direction, silently asking if he wants any, Cas nodding his head. Dean grabs two glasses from the cupboard, a clear one with a bee, for Cas, he loves bees, and one with the Batman logo on it for himself since he loves Batman. He pours the juice, handing Cas his and sitting back down after putting the juice away. “There the orange juice will balance out the bacon grease.” Dean smiles with a now mouthful of the remnants of his breakfast.
They arrive at Charlie’s and she is already waiting outside for them when they get there, she runs up and get into the car, already in a bubbly mood, like she usually is. “So, I see Sam and Cas have overnight bags… does this mean something will finally happen, if ya know what I mean.” Dean and Cas see Charlie wink through the mirror and Dean rolls his eyes laughing breathily.
Gabriel looks at Sam blank faced for a moment before smiling so wide it looks like it might start to hurt and hurriedly answers with an exasperated, “Yes Sam, I would love to! You don’t know how long I’ve waited for you to ask that!” Sam then starts to smile too, looking at Gabr for a moment and then to his brother, Dean giving him a wink that says well done. Sam is so grateful that Dean somewhat bribed him to tell Gabe his feelings.
“Oh my gosh. Thank you Dean!” Sam says elated and he goes to hug Dean, which he returns the action, wrapping an arm around Sam’s shoulder and the other ruffling his hair like he used to when Sam was a kid, it used to make Sam giggle, now the action just makes Sam do one of his iconic bitch faces.
“Yea it was good, just the right amount of scary too.” Says Gabriel and looks at Sam for his response to the movie.
“Cas…” Dean starts to say as he pulls himself against the mountain, sure to keep at least one of his hips against the stones. “Just trust me, we’ll be ok now let’s go, it’ll be fun once we start ok?” Dean states as he looks down at Cas who just furrows his brows and sighs harshly as he puts his hands where Dean’s just were and pulls himself up just as Dean did, but maybe a little more carefully.
“Great, looks like we’ll be climbing for a while huh.” Cas mumbles and takes his cellphone out, checking for bars. None, great, they could get stranded out here. “Dean.”
Cas and Dean maneuver around the kitchen together effortlessly as they grab ingredients from the cabinets and fridge for nachos. They’re making chicken and cheese, Doritos nachos and dipping it in sour cream. Dean suggested this since he used to make it for Sam and him when his Dad would leave them alone for a while at home and Dean would be made to cook supper because his mum was at the hospital doing rounds.
“DEAN! GET UPSTAIRS RIGHT NOW!” Dean’s mother, Mary Winchester, yells with her whole chest from upstairs, Dean recoiling knowing something bad has happened or that he’s undeniably in deep shit. Dean jumps out of bed no doubt waking Cas up as he makes an odd noise and shuffles in the bed, moving to get up as well.
“You seem off is all.” Cas says simply and Dean gives him an odd look as Cas now looks away.
Dean thought Cas had gone home for the night after spending the day together one night and so he went out and got drunk, little did he know that Cas was still at his place, napping in his bed. Dean had come home very drunk and practically crashed into the house, stumbling over shoes and air, and while being so noisy he had actually woken Cas up.
“‘M tryin’ ta sleep.” Dean opens his eyes slightly and when he sees Cas he smiles goofily. “N’mind sleep can wait.” He says as he reaches for Cas, almost falling off the couch due to how drunk he is, but Castiel catches him before he falls.
Castiel then rubs the lube onto his cock, sighing at the feeling after being hard for so long and no stimulation, once he’s lubed enough to his liking he leans forward and puts the tip to Dean’s hole and pushes slowly. “Relax some more baby, you’re too tight.” Cas soothes and rubs a hand across Dean’s cheekbone and strokes Dean’s cock a few times til he breaches Dean’s hole. Dean groans from slight pain and pleasure as Cas’ dick finally slips in.
“Me and Cas can come.” Dean says looking beside him at Lucy.
“I have them too, see?” Dean says standing back up straight as he can on his bow legs and turning to the side to show off the same pair of yoga type pants with the same design as Cas’ but his color is a neon blue. “Now come on let’s go, I don’t wanna waste the day sitting around.” He says as he opens the front door, throwing Cas’ shoes at him as he walks out the door. Cas slips on his Converse and follows Dean, locking the door behind him.
“Get out!” Cas flinches slightly at the pure tone and harshness of his voice and stands up shakily, moving to get his shoes on, leaving his sweater in Dean’s bedroom, not wanting to bother Dean more. He’ll be more calm tomorrow, Cas will come back and get it and maybe have a talk with Dean. He slips out the apartment door and lets a few tears fall before he moves away from the door and makes his way home. How did he not notice Dean is an alcoholic? How could Dean not tell him? How can he help him? He’s not gonna sleep tonight, he knows that for sure.
“Cas ain't wrong ya know.” Sam says and chuckles looking at his brother who is looking at him straight faced, as the others laugh.
Once they’re done making the nachos they bring the tray over to the coffee table they found free at the side of the road that was in nice condition, bringing some soda over for themselves as well, sitting on the sheet covered sofa they have yet to get rid of and replace with a new one. “Ok, my first paycheck, we’re going out to buy a new couch. This is gross man.” Dean says with a face of disgust as he tries not to sit on the couch so much, sitting more so on the edge than the actual cushion.
“I’m just so proud of us all.” Castiel says as the ceremony outside ends and they all make their way inside to the gym as they now have a little downtime to walk around and say goodbyes and have some refreshers as they talk to people.
“Oh fuck, sorry Castiel.” Lucifer comes running up to his brother and Gabriel goes to get the ice.
“Ok, great awesome, thanks! My number is 907-3235, and my name is Dean Winchester.” Dean responds, giving the information Bobby has asked for.
“Bye Dean.” With that both men hang up and Dean sighs a relief as he knows he’s good, he has a home, job, a car, school’s almost done, he has Cas and his friends, he’s good. He slumps back into the chair he’s been sitting on for the past half hour and takes a deep breath of solace, relaxing after the long week he and Cas have been through.
END OF FLASHBACK
“Yea why not, we have a reason to celebrate this time so.” Lucifer speaks as he starts to take his gown and cap off already, getting tired of it and the heat. Charlie and Lucifer shrug and they all make their way to the parking lot together.
“Yea, yea, stop complaining, we’ll be fine.” Dean comments, waving his hand in the air as they make their way towards the base of the mountain.
“Great, cactus it is.” Cas smiles and goes to grab more nachos as well.
Dean drives with no destination, white knuckling the steering wheel as he thinks about where they go from here, Dean does have money saved up, maybe enough to get a place but, he and Cas would have to get a job asap if they wanted to keep the place though. Dean doesn’t mind the idea of getting a job, but he would have liked to be able to go to college and get a good one, not working at a gas station or at a car scrap place, which he’ll likely end up working at.
After their shower they put on some night clothes and clean up their mess with the food, then they both cuddle up in Dean’s bed, both saying an ‘I love you’ and ‘Goodnight’ before drifting off into a nice slumber, Dean holding Cas like always, afraid he’ll lose one of the last good things in his life, even if he has to keep him a secret from a lot of people.
“Want me to fuck you now Dean?” Cas asks as he moves a finger to rub against Dean’s hole that starts to flutter when his finger circles it.
“It’s just, you’re not usually like this is all Lucy.” Charlie says with a bit of questioning in her tone. At that everyone makes a sound of agreement and slight confusion but decides to just be thankful and ignore the strange behaviour from their friend.
“I was so scared at first but then I absolutely loved it, maybe even more than you.” Cas quirks as he takes a swig of water.
“Yep, kinda nervous but excited too ya know.” Dean half smiles and Cas nods his head understanding. “Sorry I texted you instead of waiting to tell you in person, I know you like it better if I tell stuff to you in person.”
Dean hears the door unlock and shuts the tv off as his husband opens the door. “Hey honey. How was your day?” Cas asks as he takes his shoes off walking behind Dean who is still sitting on the couch.
“I’ll have the chicken thanks.” Cas says as he leans over to take his sandwich from Dean, giving him a quick kiss as he does. Sitting back against the rocks Castiel smiles at his spouse and eats his supper as Dean unwraps his and eats as well, them just eating in comfortable silence.
“So, how was the movie guys?” Lucifer asks as he throws his soda cup into the trash from across the hallway, the cup just barely making it into the garbage bin.
They pull up in the driveway and Dean parks the car. “Wanna go get them for me so I don’t have to turn the car off?” Dean requests his little brother and Sam nods as he opens the door of the Impala and as he knocks on the door Dean sees the boys come out not a second later that it even startles Sam how fast they came out. Cas slides in beside Dean and Sam beside Cas, while Gabriel and Lucifer get in back. “Are you excited for tonight babe?” Dean smirks at Castiel, who is resting a hand on Dean’s upper thigh which Dean has one hand over Cas’.
“No one can like rock climbing more than me.” Dean gloates and Cas rolls his eyes.
“Alright, we’ll pick up Cas, Gabe and Lucifer first and then Charlie since she lives closer to the theatre.” Dean mumbles mostly to himself as he drives down a few roads to get to his boyfriends house.
Dean and Cas both take some climbing chalk and rub in on their hands as they reach the base of the mountain. “This is really steep Dean, are you sure we can do this on our own?” Cas hesitates behind his husband as Dean is already finding a good starting point, putting his hands on the jutted rocks, making sure to grip them right so as not to slip.
“Actually yea… I was wondering if there’s still a spot? If there is, could I come to work next week, it’s just that, I’m still in school and I’d like to graduate before coming to work so I’m fully ready to take on the job, ya know?” Dean explains as his voice is obvious of his nervousness as he asks such a big thing for Bobby, who he’s never met to hold back a position that may not even be available anymore, to hold back a week for his sake for schooling.
“What about you two?” Lucy asks Gabe and Sam, stretching his neck further to be able to look at them properly from down the table.
“Dean, stop and let me get a picture of us all for memories.” Cas says estaticly as he whips out his phone and asks the next person who comes down the hall to take a photo of the group of teens. Castiel thanks the man with a scruffy beard who nods as a your welcome, after the picture is snapped and takes his phone back looking at the picture with a smile, happy with the outcome.
“Yea?” Cas responds, settling comfly next to Dean, smelling in his scent, relaxing and calming himself as well.
“Alright, just let’s make sure to take enough breaks so we don’t wear ourselves out.” Cas states as they climb carefully, squinting their eyes as the sun beams down on them in the mid afternoon.
Dean pushes his mother away in anger and hurt and stands up quickly balling his fists as he walks over to the chair his mother was previously sitting in, grabbing Cas’ beloved coat and making his way striding quickly with purpose to his bedroom, before getting too far though, he feels a hand at his bicep and he turns quickly to stare a dark and anger filled look at his mother as she tries to stop him, probably to beg him to turn straight or something. “No. Let go of me, I love Cas and no one is going to take him away from me, not you, not dad, not anyone!” Dean screams in his mother's face with rage and tears in his eyes.
As he gets to the point of not feeling anything is when he puts the bottle away and runs his hand through Cas’ messy hair, trying to ground himself from this floating feeling of nothing. He always needs something to ground himself. Cas is his ground. Cas keeps him grounded. Dean sighs and keeps his hand in his husband's hair, letting himself know he’s still here. That Cas is still here, even if he might not have Cas if he finds out. That’s a deep seated fear in Dean’s mind that is always on his mind no matter what, that Cas will find out he’s been lying about being sober for two years and Cas will say fuck him and leave him, and not let Dean get better or give him another chance or help him. He will leave him, Dean doesn’t want Cas to leave him. So why does he keep doing this?
“Fuck, I don’t know I just know mum is pissed at me, and I need to go upstairs asap.” Dean quickly says as he rushes around his room to find clean clothes jerking them on his body as fast as he can, fixing his hair a bit before telling Cas to stay in his room and be quiet, the green eyed boy skittering up the stairs like a squirrel as Cas sits nervously on Dean’s bed playing with his hands and shaking his leg from anxiety.
The lunch hour passes quickly as they talk more about what they’re gonna do tonight and they don’t even eat anything, they rarely do anyway, they usually sit all lunch hour talking, laughing and having fun. The last few periods of school pass quickly as well as everyone is excited for tonight's endeavors.
“Yea, great, we can do it.” Dean smiles with determination and clicks on a few things so they can purchase the apartment. “At least it’s close to school, that’s good. That also means it’s close to the college you’re going too! Awesome. We’re gonna be fine.” Dean smiles more confidently now and looks at Cas, who smiles just as much back, still holding onto one of Dean’s hands.
“Sure, get me some snickerdoodle cookies and an iced coffee please.” Cas responds as he looks over at Dean, smiling once again, not wanting to be mad anymore, well at least not at this moment.
“I told you to stop calling me that Gabe.” Dean giggles and wraps his arm around Cas’ shoulder pulling him into his side into a half hug and Cas leans into the touch.
They finish packing Dean’s stuff and whatever Cas had there and make their way out to the Impala with everything piled in their arms, shoving it in the trunk with heavy sighs escaping their lips in unison.
“Oh, yea it was great.” Sam says, nervously as he realizes he’s supposed to confess to Gabriel right about now. Dean is looking at Sam expectantly with a raised brow and Sam swallows, trying to work up the courage to say something to Gabe. “Um, Gabriel.” Gabriel looks at Sam from his spot beside him and waits for more from Sam. “I want to tell you something… I’ve been thinking about this for a while and well… I like you and I was wondering if you’d like to go out with me?” Sam asks with his voice low and almost too quiet to hear, even with everyone crowded around like they all knew what was gonna happen.
“Sure Dean, can we get some snacks before going to your’s? I’ve been craving berries and whip cream.” Cas smiles slightly thinking of the fun night he’ll have with his friends and his boyfriend. They both hop down off the last step like they always do and laugh a little then continue making their way out of the building, squeezing against other teens in a fight to be the first ones out of the school.
“So, are we watching a movie or doing something else?” Dean asks, looking back at Cas sitting on Dean’s bed criss cross, as he puts stuff away, having his own mini kitchen in his room, well more like an apartment, in the basement.
Dean hugs Cas a little tighter and smiles. “Of course babe.”
Dean says pulling his phone out and dialing the number of a man named “Bobby Singer” from the ad in the paper under “Singers Automotive” and a few rings go by before a slightly gruff voice of an older man comes through the receiver saying, “Singer Automotive, how may I assist you today?”
“Don’t worry, Sammy knows we’re out here, if we’re gone more than five days he said he’ll come get us and call the cops. Now stop worrying and let’s climb Cas!” Dean says excitedly and throws Cas’ backpack at him and digs in the car for the rest of the snacks he bought for them earlier, tossing them into his bag and grabbing the rest of the equipment for them.
“Of course, I always put the whole package of bacon on it.” Dean responds, taking a hearty bite into the sandwich and moaning and closing his eyes as the tastes flow through his mouth.
“She, she found the polaroid. She knows. She’s kicking me out and is probably currently telling your dad too. So I guess it’s just you and me.” Dean says, his voice wavering, trying not to cry as he packs the last of his stuff, Cas dropping his head and coming closer to hug Dean tight from the side, Dean taking in a deep breath as he lets his hands drop in defeat from what he’s packing.
“You said you always wanted to be a professor right?” Dean asks wearily, not sure why his hands get sweaty at his question. Cas nods and looks up at him with softness, making Dean have butterflies. “Well, I was thinking… maybe I could go to work and fix some cars or something to pay bills and you can go to college and get your degree for teaching?” Dean says with a smile on his lips as he looks as Cas, whose lips are parted.
“I love you, Dean.” Cas smiles wide and stands closer to Dean, now close enough to breath in his scent, a nice mix of motor oil, whiskey, woods and Dean’s natural musk, oh and maybe even some fancy cologne Cas thinks. Dean’s heart flutters at Cas’ words and gets butterflies everytime he says it. He looks at Cas and thinks he doesn’t want to spend his life with anyone else, and he wants it to stay that way, no matter what.
“Raspberries, strawberries and oh, a watermelon!” Cas replies as he’s stretched out in the shopping cart, counting the things he lists off on his fingers. As Cas lists off the things he wants Dean makes his way down the aisle and grabs the things Cas says he wants and hands them to his boyfriend to hold and put in the cart with him.
“Of course baby just tell me if it hurts ok?” Cas smiles and Dean smiles back nodding and giving Cas another passionate kiss before getting back to what they were doing.
Cas lays them both on the bed and rolls his erection into Deans a few times as he kisses down his collarbone and chest. He runs his hands from Dean’s chest down to his hips then up again, taking the dress part of it with him, kissing up his belly, making Dean squirm.
“Fuck. Feels good, Cas, start moving.” Dean says as he holds onto Cas’ shoulders and digs his nails into the skin there. Cas starts moving in and out of Dean’s slick hole and soon enough Dean starts moaning and even fucking back onto Cas. Cas moves his head to nibble at his lover's nipples through the lingerie, making Dean’s back arch and mouth fall open on a whine. “Oh fuck Cas, yea, harder!” Dean demands and grabs Cas’ hips pistoning him harder into himself and pulling their bodies closer to another.
“Don’t worry Dean, we’ll figure something out. We’ll be ok. I promise you.” Cas says reassuringly as he hugs Dean from the leather seat of the car, Dean parking in the parking spot of the Krushnic’s house. Thankfully no one is home and they go in and out quickly with Cas’ stuff, also thankful Cas doesn’t have much he wanted to take as there’s not much room in the car.
“So I heard you got a job.” Cas startles Dean as he puts his hands on Dean’s shoulders jerking him out of a dreamless nap at the table in the school library, drool dripping down one corner of his mouth, his hand coming up quickly to wipe it off. Cas giggles at the sight and covers his mouth with a hand, making Dean roll his eyes and sit up in his seat and slightly turn to Castiel.
“That it?” Cas nods his head and watches Dean get out of the Impala and skip into the little convenience store, eyeing him as he makes his way around the cramped place.
“Uh we can rest for the night.” He responds as he adjusts himself more comfortably on the rocks behind him, stretching an arm out and moving his hand in a come hither motion and Cas walks over to him, sitting down between Dean’s legs and sliding down to lay his head on Dean’s chest, looking up at him and leaning up to give him a lingering kiss. Dean moving his hands to hold onto Cas, wrapping them around his middle, wanting the kiss to last longer Dean moves his tongue over Cas’ lips. Cas allows Dean to dip his tongue in and they make out for a minute and when they separate Cas leans back into Dean’s chest and closes his eyes. “G’night Cas, love you.”
“Hi, uh this is Bobby Singer yea?” Dean asks nervously as he plays with the newspaper in his other hand.
As they watch the movie they mess around with the whip cream and berries and Cas gets some on his lips missing it and Dean leans over to kiss it off of him, grabbing his waist and continuing the kiss. Cas deepens the kiss and climbs onto Dean’s lap, settling down and holding the other boys shoulders. Castiel rolls his hips forward into Dean’s, causing a gasp to come from Dean, Cas making a move to push his tongue into his mouth. “Cas.” Dean breaths into Cas mouth, him still rutting against Dean, undeniably making them both hard and breath heavily. Cas moves one hand down to the front of Dean’s pants and rubs softly making Dean jerk up for more with a whimper.
“I’m kinda scared now.” Cas says and fakes a shiver of fear laughing afterwards. “I have a polaroid.”
“I don’t know. I just wanted to go to the movies so I thought I’d ask you guys.”
“Thanks I knew you would.”
“You’re a fool ya know that.” Dean says as Cas climbs into the blue trimmed shopping cart, his legs getting caught a couple times as he hops into the metal contraption, making Dean shake his head and let out a breathy laugh smiling all the while. Cas laughs lightly and Dean pushes the cart to the fruit section. “What kinda berries do ya want babe?” Dean asks as he and Cas browse the fruit section, Dean grabbing some new weird orange berries he’s never had before, wanting to try something new.
“Agreed, also don’t sit on that end next to you, it was wet and I had to change my pants afterwards. Not sure what the liquid was either so yea, gross is an understatement.” Cas says as he shovels a handful of nachos in his mouth while looking at his boyfriend who tries to get comfy on the edge of the sofa. “I was also thinking, why don’t we get a cactus? Like as our first thing we can take care of together, ya know?” Cas suggests as Dean finally settles as is currently chewing on a giant handful of the nachos, sour cream dripping down from his mouth, being a messy eater, but Cas loves that about him. The blue eyed man simply wipes the cream from the green eyed man’s mouth and wipes it onto a napkin, Dean mumbling a thankyou threw the nachos in his mouth.
“Dean, do you do this alot?” Cas asks quietly, looking at Dean’s hands in his, rubbing his fingers over the man's knuckles. “Do you, have a drinking problem?” Cas asks now looking at Dean, watery eyes and Dean doesn’t respond, he just drops his smile and takes his hands away from Cas’ moving to turn away from Cas’ gaze. “De-” Is all Cas can get out before Dean yells.
“You’ll see what happens later… and no Charlie, we’re not doing anything like that.” Dean says with a blush, thinking about Cas like that makes him so hot and bothered, and with Cas’ hand high up on his thigh like it is is not helping the situation. He takes a breath in and squeezes Cas’ hand and tries to think of gross things like naked old people and embarrassing moments he’s had happen to him to try and not let his mind wander to him and Cas well fu- Dean’s thoughts get interrupted by Cas’ gentle voice calling his name.
“Shit you’re so fucking hot Dean, keep making sounds baby I’m so close now.” Cas groans and bites at his husband's earlobe and collarbone, thrusting harder, faster and shallower, now hitting Dean’s prostate. Dean arches his back and digs his nails into Cas’ back and a few thrusts later he yells Cas’ name and cums on both their stomachs. “Shit shit, Dean.” Cas moans and tries to bury his head into Dean’s shoulder as he cums but Dean holds his face up instead. Cas cums looking at Dean and then Cas goes for a kiss, recovering from his orgasm.
“It’s ok, I know you didn’t mean to. I think it’s sprained though.” Cas murmurs and looks at his wrist, which is slowly turning purple and swelling slightly, making Lucifer grimace and feel even worse. Gabriel comes back out with ice and hands it to Cas, taking it and putting it on the sprain carefully hissing at the slight pain it causes. “You guys can continue playing, I’m gonna go rest and get ready for tonight.” Cas says as he makes his way inside.
“I’m proud of us.” Dean smiles with a thoughtful look on his face looking at the blue eyed man he calls his. Charlie and Lucifer scoff and look at Dean.
“Sure Dean, anyway, are we sleeping  here for the night or continuing?” Cas asks as he puts his things back into his backpack.
Dean makes his way, grabbing what Castiel had asked him for as well as some beef jerky, some twinkies and a bottle of Coke, balancing the things in his arms as he goes to the front of the store to pay.
Castiel, Lucifer and Gabriel play soccer and Lucifer being Lucifer starts to get a little more competitive than everyone else and he ends up kicking the ball hard and it flies to land on Cas’ face but he raises his hands fast enough for it not to hit his face but it cracks on his wrist hard and it hurts. “Ow, shit!” Cas yelps and clutches his right wrist, breathing in through his teeth.
When he gets home he has about an hour before Cas gets home so he washes himself up and gets things ready, he throws on a house coat and waits for Castiel to get home on the couch as he watches reruns of Family Feud.
“Oh I know y’all can.” Lucy snickers and smirks and Dean makes an amused yet annoyed face as Cas looks at them, head tilted as he doesn’t understand the joke. Dean looks at Cas’ confused face and snorts.
“This is perfect, Cas will love this.” He says with a smile and grabs the right size off the hanger, bringing it to the desk and paying for it.
Mary then pulls a small square thing out of one of the pockets, a polaroid? Yep, a polaroid. Dean knows exactly which one too.
When Dean and Cas first met they were in Kindergarten, just two little kids who each thought each other were the coolest kids in the class, so they naturally got along and started to hang out everyday. They had playdates together all the time but then one day around the beginning of first grade, Dean and his family moved away, they kept in contact by their parents and phone calls but they never really got to see each other in person anymore, until they both moved and ended up going to the same middle school together, once again rekindling their friendship. Then more moving, they never forgot each other but they did kinda drift apart after that move sadly, but then they met in college and they’ve been together ever since, they actually didn’t want to date at first but a friend of theirs had a feeling they’d make a perfect couple, and so, Charlie was her name, set them up on a date and they both had the time of their lives. They still thank Charlie for that every time they see her. Without her they might not have ever been this close.
“I didn’t. We’re doing it on our own this time. It’s gonna be so fun!” Dean beams, grabbing some clothes for Cas since he still hasn’t gotten up yet, throwing them on the bed and going to yank Cas from the sheets as he grows impatient. “Now come on, get dressed sleepy pants! I wanna get a move on. Oh by the way it's a three day thing so, yea.” Dean says as he slips out of the bedroom, leaving Cas wide eyed as he takes in what Dean last said. Three days? That’s a long ass rock climbing experience. Cas gets up and changes into the clothes Dean layed out for him, putting on some, frankly ridiculous looking leggings that have a stripe of neon green down the seams of both legs and a plain black shirt.
“Are you guys done ogling at each other?” Lucifer asks in annoyance, his friends knowing he’s not actually annoyed, rolling his eyes as he asks, picking at his fingernails with a random dark red wood pocket knife he always has with him. They always wonder how he never gets caught with it at school.
“Sorry it’s just, I don’t know I feel off at the moment.” Cas admits and leans his face on his hand leaning in on the island top.
“Good afternoon dear faculty, staff, family, friends and graduates. It is an honour to be speaking with you here today. Graduates of Sioux Falls High of the class of 2020, congratulations!” Principal Hanscum congratulates the students, now graduates of Sioux Falls High as she smiles at the podium. “I’d like to say a few words as well.” Donna starts as she moves some more papers around in her hands. “I would like to thank all the graduates for being such wonderful students over these past four years and to congratulate them for making it this far, I’m very proud of each and every one of you. I would also like to say a thankyou to the teachers who put up with their shenanigans.” She laughs and so do some students and teachers along with some parents. “I could go on about more but I’ll let the ceremony start. Now here’s vice principal Jody Mills.” Donna moves to the side back of the stage and let’s Jody stand at the podium holding a box of certificates for the graduates.
“I loved it, it had a lot of old camera stuff and cool history in it.” Charlie geeks out a bit.
Day 1 Part 2
“Where did that come fr- Oh of course.” Cas starts to ask but then looks at Dean, knowing he’s done something for this to have happened. “Good job babe, now we won’t have to suffer all the long stares of wanting that somehow neither of them wanted to notice or address or whatever they were doing.” Cas says as he smiles at his younger brother and his boyfriends younger brother hold hands now and are just smitten with one another, making Cas think back to when him and Dean got together and how it felt so good to finally be with his soulmate, to finally love and hold and kiss and be with him forever. Cas almost cries of how happy he is in life at the moment, but he holds it back as he is in public after all.
The movie they watch is about some teens who find a polaroid camera and take pictures with it but soon find out that a shadow appears in the photo and soon a person from the picture disappears from it and soon dies and they try to figure out how to make it stop after the shadow from the pictures comes out of the photo and tries to kill them.
“Hell yea, and hey this green looks really good on you, it matches your eyes really well.” Cas compliments as he plays with the dress.
“Anyways, who wants to see a movie with me tonight?” Lucifer asks from beside Dean and slams his hands on the table just to be the dramatic person he is.
“Hey Cas, wanna come over after the movie, we’ll sneak in the back so my dad doesn’t catch us.” Dean mused, taking Cas’ hand, looking at the dark haired, blue eyed boy that he is so lucky to call his, as they walk down the stairs together, the bell ringing announcing school is over for the day.
Both teens grab the groceries, thankful to have brought their own reusable bags to carry them in so it doesn’t make as much noise, and make their way around to the back yard and go through the back door that connects to Dean’s room.
As they exit Walmart, Cas still in the cart, Dean pushes fast and then sets his feet on the cart and they speed down the parking lot as they whoop with excitement as the cool night air blows at them and through their hair. “Dean! Watch the car!” Cas yells as Dean almost crashes them both into Baby, him swerving out of the way just in time, scraping his shoes on the pavement of the lot and stopping just next to the car. “That was fun. Well besides you almost hitting your Baby.” Cas laughs and struggles to get out of the cart due to having a pile of groceries on him.
“Yea, sounds good, bye Bobby.”
“Calm down baby, we’ll be ok, we will. I have some money saved too, we can use that to get a place, and yes we’ll have to get shitty starter jobs but we can make it.” Cas soothes Dean with his deep yet gentle voice that always makes Dean feel like he’s floating and makes his heart rate go down.
Dean is the first to get up, he always is, Cas likes to sleep in. He reaches into his side pouch and gets some gum to chew on and so his breath doesn’t smell and taste like alcohol. He talks Cas awake with sweet words and when Castiel wakes he smiles up at Dean and gives him a chaste kiss and stretches getting up and yawning. “How was your sleep babe?” Cas asks as he walks over to his bag putting it on and making sure he hasn’t forgotten anything in the cave before they leave.
“Sure, we all like horror. Ok guys we’re going to see Polaroid, it starts at 10pm so be ready by 9:30 so I can pick you guys up.” Dean announces and everyone agrees nodding their heads.
“Yep, guessing you’ve seen the ad in the papers?” Bobby asks nonchalantly as if he knew what Dean was about to ask the older man.
Day 2 Part 1
“Dean, can’t you just give up, Cas…” Mary starts with a bitter tone, especially at Cas’ name as she stands up to come sit next to her son hugging him with an arm around his shoulders, Dean letting her for just a moment. “Date Charlie instead? She’s pretty and smart and you know her so well, you guys would be so cute together!” Mary forces a smile trying not to think of her son with another boy.
“That’ll be 13.67.” The old and to be quite honest, rude man says that is behind the counter, after ringing in Dean’s stuff. He hands the old man a twenty and the man gives Dean his change, not even looking at Dean once during the transaction.
Dean honks Baby’s horn and taps his fingers on the steering wheel in an impetuous manner as he waits for Sam to hurry up so they can pick Cas, Lucy, Gabe and Charlie up for the movie. Sam comes skittering out of the garage door and slams it behind as heads for the beloved Chevy, as he opens then closes the door after himself he breathes out harshly and sits back putting his belt on. “You’re fancied up.” Dean announces looking at his younger brother, an eyebrow raised. Sam is wearing a nice pair of corduroy pants along with a nice sweater to go with and he’s also styled his hair for the occasion. How sweet.
“It was good, how was work baby?” Dean smiles as he leans his head back to look at Cas and he leans in for a kiss on the lips before he answers. Cas hums into the kiss and runs a hand down Dean’s clothed chest.
The polaroid Mary holds is one Cas got Charlie to take of Dean and Cas’ first kiss together last year one late night at a big football game at school, it was a nice cool and slightly breezy night and the friend group were all hanging out under the bleachers playing some stupid games like truth or dare and what are the odds. Then of course Charlie asks Dean truth or dare and Dean picks truth, letting Charlie ask if Cas and him have kissed yet, which was a no, surprising all their friends as they’ve been dating for almost three months at that point, so of course everyone makes shocked faces and gasps like they’ve both committed a crime. At that Charlie and almost everyone else in the circle cheer Dean and Cas on to have their first kiss, and of course Cas lugs his camera everywhere he can and says only if they capture it on camera, so Charlie agrees and snaps the photo, Dean lunging forward to capture Cas’ lips and hold a cheek in his hand as Cas grasps one of Dean’s sides as he almost topples over at the impact of Dean’s sturdy figure coming at him unexpectedly. Both boys smile feverishly as they kiss, cheeks bright red and hair wind blown. A very happy day for everyone. Dean and Cas think of that day very often with much fondness.
“The problem isn’t physical. It’s the emotional abuse that kept me at Aaron’s side. I know he’s toxic, but I just can’t seem to get away from him. He always finds me, and he always finds a way to make me come back to him.”
Deeply moved, Dean kissed him, pressed him deeper into the mattress underneath with his weight. Castiel’s fingers grabbed his shoulder blades, dug into his skin desperately, as they rocked against each other while kissing passionately. Dean was about to lose his sanity – Castiel’s mouth forcefully opened his, his tongue slid sensually slowly against his, made him get goosebumps everywhere. He was such a good kisser, it made Dean all weak and thrilled, made him forget every care in the world. Yet he didn’t completely abandon reason for his pleasure, tried to maintain a sober mind. Even though it felt like a huge effort, he managed to let go of Castiel for a moment – he placed his hand on Cas’ chest, right over his heart, and smiled at him kindly, loved how their eyes locked intimately.
They gotta lotta nice girls ah.
“I feel the same way about you, Dean. It’s cruel to say goodbye to you at all tonight, every cell of my body is rioting against it… So, let me propose this: If you haven’t changed your mind by tomorrow, let us meet in Friar Gabriel’s chapel right after the evening mass. Friar Gabriel is very dear to me, as he had trained me and Uriel for the past years, and he knows me right from the cradle. I trust him and his judgment. I will ask him to give us his blessing, and if he does, I will happily do whatever it takes to be with you forever, even if that means I will have to live in exile and give up the name Capulet. But if you don’t show up there tomorrow, I will know your heart has parted from mine, and that I won’t ever be with you again.”
Sam doesn’t say anything for a moment, and Dean can sense him working through his words in his head. He feels oddly nervous, considering he hasn’t really admitted anything himself.
to this, Dean. Half of our lives, probably more. I want to decide what I do with the rest. See places, learn stuff. Have—maybe have a family, some day.’
Cas is everywhere, from the plants that he’d started collecting on the sideboard to the worn chair where Dean has sometimes found him reading, his feet tucked up underneath him like a kid. He is there in the place on the floor where a different Dean, with the mark burning on his arm and the taste of blood in his mouth, had punched and kicked him to a pulp. Where he hadn’t fought back once, even when he lay broken on the ground; just wrapped his fingers around Dean’s wrist and pleaded with him not to leave.
Dean refuses to meet his eyes, but he can sense his brother’s face crumpling. ‘
Sam’s eyes brighten. ‘Well, what would you have said?’
‘It’ll get you out the bunker.’ Sam offers, ignoring Dean’s glare. ‘And the owner likes classic cars.’
He won’t move on until Dean does, and Dean doesn’t know if he ever can.
‘Sorry. I’ve been busy.’
him and—well, it’s not like he hasn’t said it to us before-’
Dean thinks back to before the angels fell, when Cas was readying to return upstairs forever; tries to look past his own painful memories and remember the peace in his friend’s face, the resolution. Heaven, now that Jack has put things to right, is Cas’s home again: pure and peaceful and just, the way that he always wanted it to be. Even if—and Dean stands by this—every single one of his angelic siblings is a complete dick, Cas has only ever wanted to stand by them, to bring them together. Now the world has finally stopped destroying itself, he can.
God now, after all. But the expression on Jack’s face is unreadable.
He knocks softly at the door, and Dean knows what is about to happen even before it does. He grunts in an affirming sort of way, knocking back another mouthful of whisky, and tries not to think about the last time that he drank from it; clinking glasses with Cas while he smiled warmly at him. His stomach twists again.
Jack looks rather sheepish, for the most powerful being in the universe. ‘I won’t leave Castiel in there. If he refuses to give up his grace, I will find him a place in Heaven. But I can’t let him back on earth as an angel.’
‘Dean…’ Sam’s face is full of pity, which only annoys him more. ‘You may not think that you’re worth that, but Cas does. He always has. I don’t think he’s ever believed anything more.’
Dean is distracting himself by working on the Impala, back from a weekend visiting Jody. His mouth hurts from smiling for them all, he and Sam’s family, who know what’s wrong but don’t have the words to help.
, a complete mess of a human being. What he couldn’t explain was his own reaction. His inability to move away, the weird energy that seemed to crackle between them when they were alone. He dealt with it by turning it into a joke, would roll his eyes and complain, ignoring the way that it sometimes made his heart flip and sent a flush down his neck. He knows that Cas isn’t this way with Sam. He has seen his brother’s little knowing looks, usually full of amusement, then sometimes something much worse; something soft and understanding, even sad, that makes Dean feel unsettled.
Jack lifts his chin. ‘I fixed the Empty some time ago, Dean.’
but this is a lifetime, a sacrifice of a different kind. He needs something; deserves some kind of reassurance that Dean isn’t dragging him into a mortal life on earth where he will be alone, again. Dean knows this, and yet even after two months, it’s still too much; everything is tangled up inside him and he isn’t
He thinks of Sam and Eileen. His heart hurts from seeing the love in their eyes, their easy touches, the warmth in Sam’s voice that he hasn’t heard for so long. He watched Eileen’s face as they said goodbye, Sam climbing back into the car, and Dean hated himself.
‘Fixing the world is complicated. But Castiel is safe.’
is forever,’ he says, and the words come surprisingly easily, in the end. He thinks maybe he’s known it for a while, even if he hadn’t imagined in what form; that he and Cas are intertwined, branded into the depths of him along with the handprint on his shoulder. He swallows, slides his palm so it rests on Cas’s neck. ‘I just—I need some time, too.’ He pulls back ever so slightly so that he can look into Cas’s face and pleads for him to understand, tries to put everything that he doesn’t know how to say yet into his eyes.
Dean feels a wash of relief at not being pushed away, grips him closer. ‘Thank God,’ he mutters absently, only catching the irony in his words a second later.
‘Dean? I was worried. You alright?’
He’s heard the words come out of Cas’s mouth before, always in what he thought were his last moments. He’d told Dean and Sam that they were his family, that he loved them. Once he’d stared into Dean’s face as he said it, eyes fierce, and Dean wondered if … but this is different. It’s laying the quiet space between them bare, putting into words the thing that Dean had accepted was never going to be acknowledged. It feels like he’s broken an unspoken rule, pressed a reset button on everything they understood about each other.
dead. For two months. How much more time were you gonna take?’
Without anyone else beside him, the darkness becomes everything. It feels crushing, disorientating. Dean goes to reach for the knife in his pocket, then comes to the prompt conclusion that it probably isn’t going to work on anything here. If he’s honest, he thinks he’d rather the screams of hell or the bleak, colourless miles of purgatory to such total emptiness. It’s a grim destination for beings that are supposed to be immortal. He thinks about the fact that Cas has spent two entire months here alone, all because of him, and his stomach clenches.
The vice that had formed around his chest and the hot spike of tears have faded, leaving something hollow and empty. He wonders if it will ever go away.
‘We’re on our way back to the bunker, should be there in an hour or so. How did you and Cas-’
‘Jack?’ Cas’s face is a picture.
‘Dean, the last time I was human…’ Cas shakes his head, and the hurt in his eyes is almost too much to look at. ‘I can’t do that again.’
‘Dean?’
Cas corrects him, making Dean grit his teeth. ‘I’m sorry, Dean. But this isn’t an easy decision for me.’
‘Forever?’ Cas asks, and Dean knows he’s asking about more than just a place to live. Perhaps his happiness really was in
‘Let me get this straight,’ Dean says. ‘The only way to bring Cas back means him losing his grace?’
Dean inches closer than he’s ever dared before, until Cas’s eyelashes are flickering inches from his own, and he feels the softness of his sudden exhale on his chin. His heart skips a few beats and he closes his eyes for a moment, breathless. Cas tilts forward ever so slightly so that their foreheads meet, and he feels something inside him break a little.
The sympathy in his face even before receiving an answer makes Dean grit his teeth. He’s most of the way through the bottle and still isn’t drunk enough for this shit. ‘I told you, it was to save me. It was the only way either of us would get out.’ He feels that age-old guilt and self-hatred creeping up in his chest and knows that he’ll have nightmares later that night.
Cas watches him and Dean knows he recognises it, like he always does, like he’s looking past Dean’s face and into whatever secrets he hides inside. Moments pass and Dean
‘It doesn’t matter.’ Dean cuts in, his heart jumping. ‘He’s gone. It took him, because of me. He said it would be forever.’ He hears his voice falter on the last word and grimaces
The problem is, Dean doesn’t know how to want anything else anymore.
hits Dean like a brick wall. He skids to a halt right at where the darkness turns into worn bunker flooring and feels the rush of adrenalin that has been pulsing through him since he arrived in the Empty flood to his head.
And Dean said nothing in return.
The look on Cas’s face tells him
Dean made him sound like that, crushed the feeling out of his voice. He feels the same hollow sensation that he’s been living with for weeks; except this time, he has put it there himself. He’s a coward.
Dean shakes his head. ‘It’s not fair. That isn’t a choice. I can’t ask him to give up his grace, not even for—for this.’
It’s just more proof that there is something deeply, irrevocably wrong with him. Something that no misplaced devotion can fix.
‘I’m not sure I want to do this anymore.’
His brother pulls a face, but he is turning back to the phone, unable to mask the delight in his face as he taps a reply. Whatever she responds with makes him bark a laugh and then he is away, a spring in his step as he heads into his room to grab his bag.
he had said.
Dean feels bile rise in his throat and manages to choke out ‘Sure, I’ll see you then,’ hurriedly hanging up. He leans against the doorway and finds himself staring at the spot where Cas had been standing, face set in horrible peaceful acceptance.
‘I- Yeah. See you tomorrow.’
‘Jack.’ Cas says quietly, not moving his eyes from Dean’s. ‘I’m ready.’
He finds himself shouting, the yawning empty darkness between them seeming to widen by the second. He’s running now, heart hammering.
People, you are all too damn amazing wow! x) thanks a bunch for your lovely reviews, I never get tired of checking my mails for your comments! Well, another update so early, because I'm in a terrific good mood and I have time on my hands! So, no, Dean is not always going to be the bottom (what!), but most of the times cough cough... Now, be warned, this chapter is uhm... I don't know what this chapter is (emotional? Insane? Emotionally insane?), but uhm,... be warned lol x)
Castiel looked in his rumpled sheets, like he belonged to this place somehow. He appeared calm and at peace with himself, as if nothing could ever disturb him here again. Even more so, it took Dean's breath away when their eyes clung to each other and he understood the expression dwelling in the dark blue orbs – that
“Must be nice to feel that way,” Dean muttered, his voice husky with emotion – and now, he wasn’t envious of Castiel anymore, he was truly glad for him that Castiel had found a way out of his own misery. Castiel regarded him pensively, a cryptic smile on his mouth. He looked down at their intertwined hands and Dean thought he detected a faint blush spreading on Castiel’s cheeks.
Dean straightened his dark blue tie, feeling terribly uncomfortable in the navy-blue tuxedo he was wearing. Yeah, he was looking great – but at what cost? The thin material of the trousers was itchy, and his white shirt felt stiff. However, the appreciative looks he was receiving from men and women alike (and from all ages, on top of that) was rewarding, he had to admit that to himself. For Sam’s great night, he had wanted to look his best, considering it was a once in a lifetime event, and that they would probably take some pictures as well…
"I just want to ensure you know enough about Dean to give up your life here for him, alright? I get it, you two are kind of a thing, and obviously he's important enough for you to consider this step. But listen to someone who knows Dean all his life. He's never been in a relationship. Only once, and that lasted for no more than a few weeks," Sam explained, sounding muffled through the door separating him from Dean. At these words, Dean winced, feeling hot tears of embarrassment welling in his eyes. He clenched one fist in frustration and self-hate. So this was what that was about. Sam was elaborating what Castiel would have to brace himself for when he decided to continue this relationship with Dean.
When he flopped down on Cas, they were both breathless, panting wrecks. Castiel threw his arms around Dean and held him, unwilled to let him go yet. Dean was still inside of him, basking in the afterglow of his frenzy. He listened to his accelerated heartbeat, felt its powerful thuds against his ribcage. He was a little dizzy, yet nothing but wonderfully weightless, braindead. Castiel peppered his temple and forehead with sweet kisses, stroked along Dean’s back with both his hands mindlessly. Dean could have stayed in here forever… A sudden thought came to his mind when he remembered their conversation of last night and he grinned to himself.
When they woke up a couple of hours later, the sun had gained strength, and warm, yellowish rays of light flooded the room. Castiel rubbed his eyes and yawned heartily, then he sat up and regarded Dean with a sweet little smile on his mouth, fondness in his look.
"Well, I'm obsessed with cheeseburgers, as long as they're good. I love buying groceries late at night, because the shops are empty then. I already chose the graveyard and the coffin I want to be buried in. Sorry, that makes me a creep, I guess", he laughed shyly, feeling the blush returning to his cheeks. Sobriety emerged on Dean's face, yet with a whiff of tenderness when he beheld Castiel thoughtfully, contemplating his words.
"I won't," Dean answered, making an unspoken promise to himself, as he answered Castiel's sweet smile with one of his own. He raised his lover's hand and kissed each knuckle with caution, his eyes deliberately locked with Castiel's. He admired his beauty as the man next to him blushed, breath hitching while Dean handed Sam the phone, having enough presence of mind left to do so. Sam kept talking to Bobby, turning his back on the couple, as Dean cradled Castiel's face in both hands, drawing him near to shower him with countless, affectionate kisses. He felt the other's form almost tremble in his kisses, how hot and yearningly he responded to each press and slide of Dean's lips, as lust consumed them gradually. With each second it became harder to restrain, and so Dean pulled back, marveling at Castiel's wrecked features, his drooping, lust-blown eyes that scanned over his face restlessly.
“Yeah. So now it’s your turn, Dean, we’re waiting for you to become a fellow citizen of the beautiful town Sioux Falls.”
„No, it just means you’re an idjit.”
.  It was one swift movement, and he had injected himself the whole syringe with the morphine. The effect was instant.
“Not to repeat myself, Cas… but you’re always welcome here. If you want to and once you’re ready. Just saying.”
“You asked me why I’m doing this…,” Aaron said with a faux-friendly smile. Castiel stared into his bright blue eyes, detected the iciness of his soul there, the absence of sympathy. He wondered why he had ever fallen in love with him, what he had seen in him. That thing in front of him wasn’t a man, it was a monster.
“Yeah, I know, Dean, I’m not blind,” Bobby joked with a lopsided smirk, “but going round in circles won’t help.”
Castiel couldn’t speak through the ache in his throat. He nodded, gave Dean a small smile.
Dean knew he was ridiculously clingy today, but neither he nor Castiel seemed to mind. It appeared that ever since they had overstepped that last physical mark, their bond was even more profound. As if they couldn't stop touching and feeling when the other was still close, still near to their own body...
A frown appears on Castiel's forehead, and he starts to move; his eyes open up suddenly, and Dean catches his breath when they meet his, their focus on him becoming painfully clear. Castiel starts to sit up puzzled, and he seems disorientated or ashamed, but Dean grabs his wrist determinately and pulls him back on the mattress. Castiel lets him, and he lays down on his side and studies Dean's features silently. Dean turns on his side as well and gives himself the admission to wrap one arm around Castiel's waist as he approaches the angel's body with his own. Something changes in Castiel's eyes, and their look on Dean becomes soft and peaceful. He closes his lids in pleasure when Dean's fingers start to stroke his clothed side absent-mindedly, soothingly.
Suddenly, they were standing in front of each other again, merely a foot apart. With pleasure, Dean watched the gentle, fluttering smile appear on Castiel’s kissable lips, then, how he bowed his head and looked away, obviously shy. Dean wasn’t having it. He had made up his mind. Screw destiny, screw obligations, screw sides. He wanted this. He needed this. With his forefinger and thumb, he touched Castiel’s chin, carefully yielded a little pressure, so that he could move it up, make Castiel look at him again. Enraptured, Dean studied the vulnerability in Castiel’s eyes, which made him even sweeter somehow. Butterflies were flying through Dean’s stomach, up into his head, severed all his synapsis with their wings; he forgot every sensible thought.
He entered the hallway and stood in front of Castiel's shut door. The silence rang in his ears. He felt absolutely not like himself when he raised his hand slowly and knocked at the door repeatedly. There was no going back now. All of a sudden, Dean's heart decided to be human again, and it raced and screamed and raged in his chest at a tearing space, protesting against his plan. He swallowed thickly, fighting against the upcoming pain. Castiel opened the door with the brightest smile Dean could think of – and his eyes... oh, his blue eyes contained such mirth and suaveness. And within the length of two seconds, the fine features fell oddly and changed into a baffled mask. Dean studied Castiel's eyes wandering all over his body and face, taking in the damaged appearance of his partner.
“Quiet,” he chuckled, laughing when Cas bit into his forefinger playfully. Cas grinned briefly, then his face contorted into lust-tortured sweetness again, as Dean rammed into him from a different angle. He moaned again, barely managing to keep his voice down and holding on to the sheets desperately, as Dean stimulated his sweet spot, making him lose it with each stroke. Dean’s heart was somersaulting in his chest, his breathing accelerated, as he watched Cas getting closer to his orgasm. The sight alone was arousing enough, but to feel his heat, his constricting muscles squeezing him, to hear his whimpered, faint moans… Incredible warmth spread all over Dean’s body, made him lightheaded and his cheeks burn as one electric wave after the other shook him. Rapture was reaching out for him, wonderful thoughtfulness. With an animalistic urge, he suddenly seized Castiel by the hips, made him sit up on his knees, and fucked into him with all his might. He enjoyed how Castiel subdued to his lead, how he leaned his back trustfully against Dean’s torso, letting him do whatever he wanted with him.
Castiel tried to relax and to breathe deeply through his nose, yet he could not, and the quivering exhales he emitted matched those of Dean, warming his face repeatedly. Dean opened his eyes again and they got lost in the sight of each other, because this was the most intimate thing they could share, as far as they had never gone before. Wonder seemed to be painted all over Dean's face as he regarded the effect it had on Castiel, it must have been visible that he was perishing with the intensity of the act. It was a shock to be inside someone again, Castiel thought, it had been quite a long time. It had never been like this, never this wild and blunt – there were no romantic gestures, but devouring looks, there wasn't the soft stroke of a palm, no, there were Dean's nails scraping over his shoulders brutally instead. So when Dean kissed him, lacking the finesse and making up for it with a savage assault of his tongue, Castiel responded only too pleased to it, his tongue combating with Dean's in heady kisses. Then Dean started to move upwards, Castiel's length sliding out of the clutching heat for a bit, and when Dean crashed down on Castiel again, the world was spinning around. The high-pitched whimper escaping him would have made him blush, but he could solely focus on Dean kissing him, beginning to ride his heavy dick with a tentative pace, and it was driving him insane. His fingers found their grip on Dean's hips and for a while he allowed him to fuck down onto him – they had stopped kissing, too breathless to continue, and now Dean's eyes were locked on Castiel's as he took him deep inside again and again, controlling the pace and the depth of their collision with a mischievous glimmer in his eyes.
It seemed to Dean, they were performing a holy rite, like a marriage ceremony. As their bodies came together in this forsaken church, it was like giving and receiving absolution, like drinking blessed wine and eating Eucharistic bread. Dean's befuddled head formed mute prayers when he studied Castiel's opened lips, he was inwardly praising his lover as he felt so alight to be with him. He had no words for his heartfelt gratitude.
Castiel smiled broadly at that, trying to picture what it would be like to drive Dean's beloved car. He saw how Dean fidgeted with his car radio, and he found a suitable station that played quiet rock love songs. A corny guitar solo resounded in Castiel's small car while he focussed on the streets, and Dean gave him directions every now and then. Apart from that, they were silent, and Dean seemed sleepy; the company was soothing and Castiel was blissfully happy. To drive with Dean through the night and to listen to sappy slushy songs was somehow the perfect moment for him, to feel his love for Dean pump through his veins like an endless river. Sometimes Dean's fingers fled to Castiel's thigh and stroked along his clad limb, and then Castiel would give Dean a lopsided smile which would be answered with a tender glance.
Instantly Dean had a queasy feeling about this, a sense of foreboding defeated him. Fear clutched his heart, made it difficult to think clearly. Something was wrong.
„You feel damn good too, Cas,” he rasped against Castiel’s mouth. He initiated a slow rhythm, filling Castiel up again and again as his dick slid out and into him. It was like a hallucination, like a fever dream, to watch Castiel come undone so beautifully underneath him, how he threw his head from one side to the other, moaning and sighing in turns as he met each and every of Dean’s strokes with his hips. Dean intensified the rhythm and the force of his thrusts, feeling as if he was chasing his own breaths. He could hear his own wrecked moans in his ears, felt the fire building up and up and up in his spine. His whole body was tingling, felt stimulated and wonderfully numb at the same time. Then there were Castiel’s fingernails in his shoulder blades, desperately holding on to him – Dean detected the haunted look in Cas’ lust-blown eyes, saw how his chest tensed up, how Castiel stopped breathing. He was nearly clinging to Dean with all his might as Dean slammed into him.
Naturally, the two agents loved to tell everyone about their successes unconditionally; The longer Raphael spoke, interrupted with senseless interjections of Michael, the more Castiel felt all color drain from his face, and Gabe's eyes resting more often on his with a weird, knowing expression. They were being told how Raphael and Michael had led an investigation last week and that they had closed down a brothel outside of town; they had arrested the owner and the people who had worked there, and it had only taken a few thorough threats and interviews, and the owner had confessed he had been working for Alastair. They had been able to retrace their phone calls and had found enough evidence to put Alastair behind bars for a convenient period of time. Once they had left, Gabe got up and shut the door, then he closed in on Castiel with slow, catlike movements, his eyes never leaving his younger partner. He sat down on Castiel's table and searched for his eyes, and Castiel understood he couldn't avoid him until the end of time, so eventually he found the courage to raise his head and meet Gabe's prying eyes, while his heart throbbed frantically against his ribcage.
The woman nodded eagerly. Then she laughed coyly, played with her hair. She was pretty, her attire was neat. The lipstick on her mouth was bloody red. Dean watched her silently, wondered about her nervousness.
"Nothing. Just thought you sound older than nineteen. Guess I forgot how privileged I am. Surely, my folks aren't rich or anything, but at least I can live in the college's dormitory. But the room is pretty crappy, though."
if you made it till here, I'd love to know what you think <3
"I'm sorry", he gasped, feeling like he had crossed a line, and Castiel blinked friendly at him, showing he wasn't offended because of the inconsiderate question. For a few moments they were still, and Dean allowed Castiel to turn him on his side, so that he could uplift his hurt leg in an awkward motion, making Dean utterly embarrassed – Castiel was kneeling in front of him now, and his appearance was pretty distracting. Dean's eyes travelled over his slim stomach, hidden underneath his white shirt, to the V-neck. Protruding lines of his collarbones were visible, and Dean felt his breath quicken as he thought about biting into them, gnawing at them hungrily. There was a luscious, lengthy neck, and Dean would have done a lot to be permitted to suck at the smooth skin, to leave dark hickeys in the crook of Castiel's neck.
He slowly straightened himself and his heart throbbed rapidly and vehemently in his chest when he dared to look at Gabriel for the first time since he had confessed his dirty little secret. A confused smile of bewilderment graced his partner's lips, sympathy clearly written all over his face.
When it was time to go home and Castiel packed together, Gabe patted his shoulder encouragingly. Castiel turned around, incapable of replying to the kind smile Gabe gave him. The more he thought about tonight, the more he felt the urge to run – whether away or to Dean, he did not know, but he knew tonight would be important, maybe life-changing even, and he couldn't help be excited.
The second session of this Monday was even worse. Castiel was more silent than ever, and it was terribly contagious. Dean was suffused with an unhealthy portion of self-hate as he contemplated Castiel's reticent face while he himself didn't say anything either. He could still discern Castiel's soapy, fresh scent... he could still feel the tingling warmth of his palms seeping through his skin and bones when Castiel palpated his injured calf and massaged it with a concentrated frown. They were physically so close, but on an emotional level Castiel had shut all possible doors and refused to let Dean inside ever again – that much was certain.
Taken back, Dean scrutinized the round plate he held in his hand, it was so little he could easily shove it in his jeans' pockets. It was richly carved, he pondered whether he had seen such a thing before: To him it looked like countless interwoven knots, like entangled yarn with no identifiable end or beginning. It was some kind of symbol Dean thought he knew, maybe he had come across it in John's diary... Castiel's warm hand suddenly enveloped his and the carving in his palm, Dean could sense the warm, smooth texture of his skin. He hadn't witnessed how close Castiel had come as they were kneeling face to face on the carpet now. He uplifted his head, only to see Castiel's hovering so very near in front of him, the orange candlelight coming to rest on his head, making him look ethereal. Dean's exhales stagnated when Castiel squeezed his hand caringly.
Then he sensed nimble fingers covering his pounding length with another slick condom skillfully, unfurling it on his dick determinately. When Castiel slathered his cock with a decent amount of lube, giving it to him with a tight fist so that Dean was actually convulsing and sitting up slightly, Dean suddenly figured it out. The air was punched out of his lungs and his erection hardened even more, almost painfully, and his imagination ran free as he tried to picture Castiel's plan. Dumbstruck, he watched the younger man sit up so that he was kneeling, his ass hovering temptingly right over Dean's prepared cock. He could see how the layer of lube glistened in the setting sun's light, how his cock twitched in anticipation under the thin layer of the ribbed condom. Not even in his wildest dreams he had done this to Castiel. But the other lowered himself confidently, one of his hands enclosing Dean's dick, the other Dean couldn't see, but he assumed he was supporting his weight on the mattress. Dean gulped heavily, his heart leapt into his throat, as he observed how the tip of his length disappeared slowly in Castiel's tiny hole. The sensation was even more intense this time, now that he was seeing meticulously what he was carrying out.
Sweat was running down his temples, his lungs hurt with every breath. He didn't know how many minutes had passed, but he was certain they were running out of time. He hurried up and singed the grassy forest floor as best as he could. The flamethrower became heavy in his arms, weighing considerable seventy pounds. His sinews were protesting with every move, his fingers started trembling with exhaustion. He drew the last line and completed the devil's trap, boasting with jubilance. Dean let the instrument fall to the ground mindlessly, then he began pushing all demons, who stood outside the lines, into the trap. Castiel must have understood his intentions, for he did the same – it all happened so quickly, the demons didn't even realize what was going on. Sam shoved the last demon into the trap and they hastened to get out of the drawn circle, all huffing and puffing and decorated with countless wounds.
Dean and Bobby shared a silent look with raised eyebrows.
He took a deep breath, then he left the courtroom as well to find Jack. He found him sitting on a bench nearby, his care-taker silently sitting beside him. He gave her a kind smile, and she wordlessly understood his intentions as he made a beeline towards them – he wanted to speak with Jack in private. The lady got up and walked a few steps away, out of hearing range. With circumspection, he took a seat beside Jack, felt his big eyes resting on him all the while. He turned his torso towards him, gave him a kind smile as he took in his delicate, porcelain features.
The next time their gazes flickered over each other, Dean thought he saw worries growing Sam's face pale. He appeared sick, instantly Dean's heart accelerated its pace. Something here was terribly wrong. Sam handed him a document, which resembled a bible extract, for the letters were richly ornamented. The language must have been Latin, but luckily there was a translation written underneath. Dean read the lines fleetingly, his eyes darting over Sam's repeatedly, stunned at the content.
“Jack,” Dean croaked, breathing labouredly against the intense pain in his chest, “are you okay?”
“It’s short for Live Action Role Play. You know, you dress up, meet with others, who do the same, and pretend to be, I don’t know, an elf, or a medieval warrior, or, hell, Princess Leia, whatever you want.”
"What about him?", he asked confused, and Castiel tilted his head; ashamed he felt how his cheeks blushed and a wave of heat churned through him. His knees tingled when he realized he could not go back from here. He'd already told Gabe too much, but maybe it was time to tell him everything that had been occupying his mind for weeks now.
“She was
"We always got along pretty well... and our relation is good, I guess. Even so, I haven't seen them in two years – after Anna's death they sold the house and from their earnings they started travelling all over the world, you know... They told me they needed a fresh start and whenever I talk to them on the phone every few months or so, they do seem happier to me. I think they just needed time to let go of my sister..."
„Listen, Bobby, I was thinking… do you have some kind of storage space for me?” Castiel asked. Dean was only half-heartedly listening, as he was busy keeping himself awake and losing slowly but surely against his body’s needs.
He felt so connected to Dean, in more than just a physical manner, and as they watched each other come undone with lust-hooded eyes, he felt his second orgasm was building itself up in the pit of his abdomen. His stomach convulsed each time Dean drove inside him, sometimes hard and quick, sometimes slowly and sensually, savouring the feel of gliding into Castiel's scorching, hot tunnel. A hot sensation pooled in the depth of him, and when Dean hit his prostate and squeezed it gently with the tip of his dick, he heard his own, high-pitched mewl as he winced due to the intensity of scorching hot waves of lust washing over him; he uplifted his ass so that Dean could thrust deeper into his flesh, and his whole body trembled and shuddered, when Dean collided with his sweat spot again and again. It all felt like a dream, to see Dean lose it too, how the beads of his sweat trickled down his temple, his throat, his clavicle... A hot shiver ran down Castiel's spine, and his eyes rolled into the back of his head, as his orgasm surrounded him, circled in on him. Dean grunted and threw his head back, exposing his throat to Castiel. He watched his chest's muscles constricted, and he felt the exertion traveling through Dean's whole body, as he approached his own orgasm more and more. Castiel observed his lover coming loose in detail, and it aroused him immensely to detect the little signs of Dean's climax; The way he picked up speed and rammed into Castiel unrestrainedly, how he grunted and moaned loudly, how his forearms shook with thrills of joy – then, how he stopped breathing and thrust inside Castiel harshly, with one long, forceful stroke. Castiel came due to Dean's sight, and they reached their orgasms together.
“Thank you, Dean, you’re really kind… I know it sounds selfish, but can I ask this one thing of you? Can we please spend our last days here as if everything is okay, as if none of us is leaving? It would make my departure easier, I think… Also, I wanna enjoy the last days here with you while I can… Is this okay?”
"Dean, don't make me come in here," Castiel moaned against Dean's mouth, he could feel the little wafts of air of every word touching his bottom lip; his abdomen convulsed, he was shaking from head to toe with arousal. What a silly request, how could they stop now? Now that their chests were hotly conjoined, now that they were both hard and filled with pent-up, sexual ecstasy? In the background of his awareness Dean remembered the confession Castiel had made a week ago – that he wanted his next intercourse with someone to matter; and who was Dean to bereave him of that? He nodded wordlessly and wrapped his arms around Castiel's neck again. He tried to come down from this mind-blowing exhilaration when Castiel engulfed him in a hug too – his thighs still enveloped Castiel's waist, but neither of them seemed to mind. They held on to each other tightly; Dean could feel Castiel's wet, moist breath bedewing the skin of his neck and he snuggled into him and kissed his shoulder coyly. This felt good, regardless every reason, Dean thought. This felt homely, thrilling, intimate, just
Dean grinned as the memory returned to him. Oh yeah, that had been a wild night.
Castiel struggled to his feet and held out his hand for Dean. With a swift movement he stood as well, so very close in front of Castiel – they were face to face, and it made Dean short of breath. It seemed like his exhales were tuned to Castiel's, that they were breathing in unison, and it made Dean lose his composure rapidly. His hot breath mingled with Castiel's, it blew against his mouth repeatedly, made his head swim. It was so very strenuous to withstand the temptation to uplift his hands and frame Castiel's fine face – not to morph their lips together in heady, vehement kisses, claiming those plump lips with his own. Castiel finally found the strength to turn away, and Dean took his crutches and followed him wordlessly to the apartment door.
So, let me know what you think! It seems I will update every 2 days now, because otherwise my visit of a festival will intervene hehe…
Sam became frustrated, sat up, held his finger into Dean’s face.
Castiel chuckled softly when he remembered the way Anna had said these words, making him and his parents laugh with her, but they hadn't been able to hide the tears that were simultaneously streaming down all of their faces.
When he was shot the police stormed the building and freed the hostages while Castiel administered first aid to the women in her thirties. She looked at him with a pained expression as he applied pressure to her bullet wound in her stomach, trying to stop the bleeding. A few minutes later the medics rushed in and helped him, and he was glad to learn they would be able to save that woman's life.
“The kid’s great. I mean, he seems scarily composed in regards to what he has been through. Damn mature for his age… and I really liked talking to him. He’s so bright, you know? Straight-A student and all that.” He sighed, suddenly heavy-hearted.
His eyes darted to Sam and his girlfriend Jess, and he couldn’t help but grin amusedly. Sam was wearing a black tuxedo, but he looked as if he hadn’t quite grown into it yet. His shaggy brown hair was an untameable chaos – but his eyes were brimming over with joy, and his wide grin seemed glued to his mouth. His mirth was infectious. Dean couldn’t help but feel proud of him. He studied Sam beholding Jess, and the two were so adorable, it made Dean a little wistful, for they seemed so right together, and Dean still hadn’t found “the right one”. He doubted by now that he would ever find a person fitting to him perfectly. He was 27 years old by now, and apart from countless flings and short-lived relationships, he had never been in a long-term, committed relationship. When he beheld Jess regarding Sam with such a fond expression in her eyes, and them holding hands while they talked intimately, he knew however that this thing between her and his younger brother was something serious, that this looked like true love. He pushed his glum thoughts aside and simply allowed himself to be happy for his brother, to enjoy the night.
He bit his bottom lip and his hand speeded up. He moaned into his pillow, when the idea of Dean's eyes watching him overwhelmed him. They had shared such a sparkling chemistry, the way their eyes had rested on the other... Castiel wanted to experience this again. Quickly his mind drifted to wild daydreams; he imagined he could feel the heated skin underneath his fingertips again, and he longed for the knowledge of tasting these sweet lips just once. Castiel squeezed his dick with shaky fingers when he came, and he felt his eyes roll into the back of his head. He was surprised by the intensity of his orgasm, and for a while he couldn't stop bucking his hips into the mattress and moan unrestrainedly, Dean's name on the tip of his tongue. Heat and convulsions shook his body and relief washed over him, making his body go incredibly limp.
The hunter's way of life was catching up on Dean swiftly with each elapsing day and he knew deep inside he couldn't avoid it forever. The scouting expedition he and Sam had planned for tomorrow's Sunday was already too alike erstwhile events, Dean almost felt as if he had never paused being a hunter. It wasn't something you could easily quit, if you could quit it at all. He was just glad he had convinced Sam to leave the rest of this Saturday to him, so that he could spend it with Castiel like a normal guy, whose thoughts were far off demons, far off experiences between life and death and the damned devil himself.
On Sunday, he felt a little better, more hopeful about the coming weeks, even though he knew they would be tough. His mood brightened up even more when Benny called. God, Benny, he hadn’t talked with him in weeks. Benny was his work buddy, and they also sometimes went out for a beer or barbecued in Benny’s backyard. When you had the same shift and only each other to talk, you really got to know the other quite well – and Dean and Benny had instantly taken to each other. He was a little older than Dean, and often Dean felt as if he was the older brother he had never had; they sometimes even called each other “brother” – a thought, which made Dean chuckle now, as he listened to Benny’s gruff voice over the phone.
"Cas, that was even worse than the other ones!," he complained with an agonized wail, hearing Castiel's aggrieved, pouting "What?!" in return. Dean rolled around on his side to study Castiel's hauntingly beautiful eyes brimming over with flickering mirth as he regarded Dean with a cheeky smile. He had his face rested on his cocked up arm, his fingers began stroking Dean's torso absentmindedly albeit gently. Dean felt so calm and collected in Castiel's company, it was quite enthralling to share this level of intimacy with each other.
„Yeah, don’t mention it. We better get dressed up, then, I suppose?”
On Monday Castiel returned to work, still at variance with himself – he was already starting to convince himself of NOT going back to Dean on Friday, to let the whole topic drop. Nevertheless his heart hurt terribly at that idea, and pangs of pain hit his ribs with every thud of it. His rather gloomy mood was the exact opposite of Gabe's cheerful spirit when he entered their shared office, seeing his broad grin and his tanned skin. Castiel smiled a tiny smile and let Gabe talk about his vacation for the better part of the next hour. His tales about drunk tourists and a shabby hotel service made him laugh from time to time, and he felt slightly exhilarated, at last able to detach himself from thoughts about Dean for a while.
“I feel like a truck ran over me, to be honest. My neck is all cramped, my head feels like it’s about to explode… just groggy. I won’t be of any use today; I think I just might sleep a lot. Tomorrow it should be okay again.”
„Thanks, Cas, that’s awesome,” Dean said breathlessly. And then Bobby saw a faint blush spreading all over Castiel’s face, from his neck up to his cheeks and ears, making him look as if he was steaming. Castiel turned around again and put the peanut butter away, his moves all jittery and clumsy. Bobby shook his head in disbelief, not sure if he could stand this circus for even one more day. There were idjits everywhere. Unluckily, they were living with him under the same roof. It was cute and loveable, but unnerving at the same time. Bobby decided to address the topic rather sooner than later, or he would lose his mind. When Castiel had gone upstairs to refresh himself, Bobby made use of the opportunity to talk with Dean in private. He leaned forward in a conspiratorial manner, studying Dean’s startled features as their eyes met.
Dean hoped so too, and wondered what he could do to cheer Castiel up a little. The guy needed distraction…
"You realize this is not a dating agency, right? I'm just a hooker." Castiel had to burst out laughing at that, remembering Gabe's and his previous conversations on that matter. He became swiftly serious again though, when he noticed the man gave him an irritated, ill-humoured look, asking what was so funny.
"What will Sam do now? Have you talked to him?", John asked, more composed, but Dean's body still seemed to tremble due to his emotional outburst.
, see you soon!
Their kisses became less restrained with every passing second. Cas’ tongue slid into Dean’s mouth, licked against his teasingly. Dean shuddered when he sensed slender fingers carding through his hair tenderly while they French-kissed. Cas gripped his skull tightly suddenly, pressed his warm, pulsating hard-on into Dean’s abdomen. He couldn’t help but moan into their kisses at that, crave for more. Blindly, he let go of Cas’ kissed-abused mouth, let his lips move down to touch his lover’s throat. Open-mouthed, he sucked on it, bit into it in turns. Cas writhed underneath him, reared up his hips. With a pounding heart, Dean took in his reactions, felt how they made him harden even more. He moved down, left airy, ghostlike kisses on Cas’ pec, his ribcage, moved his mouth over the planes of his lean stomach. A whole-buddy shudder coursed through Cas, he sucked in a shaky breath. Gingerly, Dean left open-mouthed kisses on Cas’ rock-hard length, felt him twitch in response. His lover sighed lengthily. Cared his fingers through Dean’s hair with gentleness.
Jack scratched the back of his head abashed and looked down.
Hmmm what do you say? Please let me know, I cherish each review x)
So they lay there side by side for the next half hour, studying the other's face, while the man's fingers roamed carelessly and gently over Castiel's body, supplying him with little fond caresses. Castiel enjoyed his slender fingers gliding through his dark hair, the way they wandered down his cheek, his neck... He loved the way the stranger's eyes beheld him – there he saw the hint of emotions, something akin to passion and pure interest; he adored to be considered with such an attentive manner, and somehow he mused this was no ordinary night, neither for him, nor for the stranger. An unspoken thickness lay in the air, it was sensible in the way they looked at each other, in the way their breaths came so slowly and in the same rhythm of the other man. Castiel felt at ease.
"What the hell happened to you?" Castiel asked without breath, trying to read the expression of Dean's pensive eyes. Dean couldn't help but smile a little, for it was glorious to be regarded that important – that someone cared so much about him that this person was deeply concerned about these mild wounds.
“Yeah, sounds great. Pizza’s on me, though,” he agreed. Charlie grinned.
alcohol”, Dean started slowly, feeling Castiel’s burning eyes on him, sharp and knowing, seeing right through him and effortlessly understanding the pain he still carried within him. Dean tried to smile but failed miserably. He exhaled shakily, fought against the uprising agony in his heart, the voices of bygone days screaming within him. He really didn’t want to explore all the emotional baggage, which had been put on him in those past years.
Castiel smiled at him with sweet fondness in his eyes. It made Dean’s hair stand on end, made his whole body prickle. He hadn’t been looked at like that in ages, it seemed. With appreciation, admiration. As if he was someone special. Castiel leaned forward, into Dean’s personal space, his lids drooping as he regarded Dean with fire in his look. His voice was low and seductive, put warmth into Dean’s lower body.
At his words Dean was reminded he still wasn't allowed to share everything with Castiel. His head swam as he searched for a fitting explanation without giving himself away or making Castiel think he was nuts.
Hand in hand, they strolled the empty rooms, while Dean explained how he had envisioned their future home. Downstairs, there was a very spacious living room, and a big kitchen, directly bordering on the wooden porch, where their picnic for dinner was still waiting for them. There was also a small storage place next to the kitchen and a guest bathroom. To the upper tier, a flight of stone stairs led. Castiel couldn’t stop marveling at the size of the house as Dean showed him a master bedroom, two smaller bedrooms, and a generous bathroom. All rooms were bright and well-kept. When they finally stopped in their future bedroom, Castiel finally exploded with laughter.
Her glance instantly fell on Dean. Her demeanor became sharp, frosty, as she produced her silvered gun. With swift steps she made towards Dean, aiming at him. Michael and Raphael followed suit, drew their guns as well.
Castiel turned his face and smiled enamored at Dean, his rosy, ripe lips forming a touched smile. He extinguished the petty distance between them and pressed a long-lasting, hard kiss against Dean's cheek that burnt right through Dean's heart. Dean returned to his former position, but now he wrapped both arms around Castiel's lean upper body, letting his forearms slide under his armpits and holding him close. For a few seconds, they moved together with every breath, like tidal waves in an endless game of ebb and flow. They both studied the romantic scenery unfurling in front of them; Dean smiled dreamily as he watched the stars blinking vividly, seemingly so close that he could reach out his hand and pick them off for Castiel. He was so infatuated with this situation, with holding Castiel so close and hearing his every breath, the next time he spoke, his voice was husky and faint.
As they were waiting in a queue of other cars, Sam shifted the Impala out of gear and put on the handbrake. He looked at Dean through the rearview mirror, concern in his eyes about Dean’s words.
"One for thrombosis prevention, and one antiphlogistic agent. It will help allaying the inflammation of your leg and keep your blood vessels widened. You better get used to it, Mister Winchester: May very well be that you'll get injections more often these days", she explained as sweet as sugar. Dean decided he didn't like her, and as she left the room with a wink, he crossed his arms over his chest and sulked.
When the man lay on his back he opened his jeans slowly, his eyes never leaving Castiel's. A cheeky smile came to the man's lips when he let his gaze roam over Castiel's body, ultimately coming to rest on the obvious bulge in Castiel's jeans.
A thrill of gleeful anticipation made him twitch when there was a soft knock at his open door: Castiel stood there, leaning against the doorframe with a serene, affectionate smile on his pink, full lips. He beheld Dean with appreciation in his eyes, Dean felt hot and cold at the same time. He got pins and needles in his tummy when he read the desire in Castiel's face, how he more or less undressed him with his glances alone. Dean's mouth fell open when he examined Castiel's appearance as well, he looked absolutely mind-blowing. The other man wore black suit pants, which encompassed his firm thighs in a mouth-watering way; Dean's gaze traveled up the flat stomach and the well-defined chest and arms, enveloped in a baby blue button-down shirt. Castiel's eyes practically sparkled with their intense, lavender-blue shade, Dean sensed flashes of delight bounce through him.
“God, will you ever get tired of me?” he complained in jest, and it made Dean chuckle.
"Uh, I've... well, I've driven on the Golden Gate Bridge, when we were in San Francisco. And no, I didn't wear flowers in my hair", he joked, thinking about Scott McKenzie's song. It was one of the happier remembrances he had; the radio had played some quiet rock song, and for once, John had been in a good mood. Sam had slept in the back seat, and Dean had been sitting next to his dad. He must have been, what, 14 or 15 or so, and it had been summer, a few weeks, which had felt like a proper vacation to them all. The golden sunlight had cut through the thick fog surrounding the bridge in the early morning, while they crossed the sea underneath them. He felt Castiel's contemplative eyes resting on him, eager for more.
For the better part of the day, Dean was busy doing household chores and cleaning his apartment. It was good that he had so much stuff to do, because it kept his brain distracted from thinking. He suppressed all memories of him and Cas, suppressed all worries about him, and where he was right now. Dean had decided not to focus on Cas, but on himself, because otherwise he feared for his sanity, feared that he couldn’t stand being without him. Functioning like a robot was a lot easier than dealing with all these terrible emotions overwhelming him. So, Dean functioned. However, when he lay in bed again this night, in the darkness, visions of Cas appeared before his mind’s eye, and he couldn’t do a damn thing about it. He kept seeing Cas’ beautiful eyes, his gorgeous smile when he looked at Dean, and a wistful heaviness filled his heart, made him long for the other man’s presence direly. He could almost feel Cas’ kisses, could almost hear his voice again, his fingers carding gently through Dean’s hair, and his yearning for him nearly killed Dean. Frustrated about his train of thoughts, Dean shooed all those memories away determinately and willed his body to get some sleep, so that he could forget…
"I mean, don't get me wrong. You could drop in and... I don't know, just stay overnight. It would be comforting to sleep next to you, I promise, nothing more, I just want to feel you lying next to me again, okay? And the next morning I'll bring you breakfast in bed and pamper you."
whenever he shoved himself inside, sliding almost completely out only to ram his whole length in again. He saw Dean's cock was fully erect again, jerking against his abdomen whenever Castiel made another thrust. Through half-closed eyes Dean looked up into Castiel's face again – through the half-light Castiel could see the desperation, the bewilderment, while Dean panted in Castiel's arms, and it satisfied Castiel to the deepest core of his heart. He felt and watched Dean's insides cringe around him and he quickened his pace, seeing Dean screwing his eyes shut forcefully, biting down on his bottom lip until first drops of blood were visible.
“Are you mad? If I’m okay with it? I love it!”
“Do you wanna help me? I guess you know your way around Bobby’s kitchen better than me.”
noww... tell me what you think... :-) btw, if you wanna see something specific happen in this story, lemme know. I have the outlines for the story ready and know what should happen next, but I'm happy to include your ideas if they fit!
“Yeah, maybe,” Castiel thought aloud, half-absentmindedly. Dean counted backward from ten within his head, pretty certain that he would kiss Castiel when he had counted down to one. He couldn’t withstand this sweet seduction, this temptation right in front of him, for very much longer. Did Castiel know what he was doing to Dean? How gorgeous he was, how attractive?
Sam didn't say anything when Dean confessed he would spend a few hours in Castiel's apartment, he just made Dean promise to call him as soon as he would be back. They agreed Sam should be alarmed if Dean hadn't called him until midnight, then he would know something was wrong. Dean was somewhat averse to babysitter-Sam, but he knew it would be unreasonable to argue with him about this issue. By the looks of it, he still wasn't at his best, although he was healing and improving day to day. Despite his displeasure to be protected by his younger brother, it also created a feeling of safety in Dean's chest, tightened it with a tender sentiment.
The next seconds went by with shared silence, Castiel could hear Dean's breaths even out while his lungs calmed down likewise. His fingers still felt kind of numb and tingly when he clutched the phone tight, a small smile on his lips. He imagined Dean's satisfied body, completely slackened and whacked as he lay naked on the sheets. Castiel felt a deep demand to lay there next to him and hold him tight, to feel his sweaty body in his arms. He remembered Dean's smile so perfectly, and his lucid green eyes appeared in his mind's eye, seemed painted to his retina. He let out a soft sigh, listening to his heart pound against his chest ever so gently and slowly, but forceful, now that it had found a purpose again.
Automatically his hands slid under the hem of Castiel's T-shirt and stroked the sleep-warm, smooth skin on the small of his back absentmindedly. He inhaled his scent deeply, a fond sensation was stirred in his gut. He laughed a little when he heard the loud stomach growling coming from Castiel, the man in his arms chuckled lightly too. When he pulled back he beheld Dean with a cheeky smirk, but Dean was too perplexed to say anything because the sunlight was refracting in Castiel's endless, deep blue eyes wonderfully. Their shade was so enchanting, it made Dean blush with affection. As if by magic they both tilted their heads and kissed each other longingly; Dean's hands around Castiel's waist tightened their grip and he held him closer to his chest. His whole being was flushed with yearning as he savored the taste of Castiel on his tongue, the feel of his tender lips moving against his with gentle pressure...
"Cas, you better get your ass here asap! I think you have some explaining to do", Dean snapped at him. Castiel's frown deepened and he felt his eyebrows furrowed in bewilderment – what had he done wrong?
