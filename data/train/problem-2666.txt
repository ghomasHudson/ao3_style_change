“I shall deal with it,” Mycroft repeated obstinately. “Do not think my trust extends so far as to allow him so free a rein. Besides, I have another task for you. Meet me in the library.”
Sturgerson nodded. “This isn't a regular thrall. Loyalty on the human side is normal, but such deep devotion is not. Neither is the ah, passion, which you've displayed. And it
stay here, brother,” he commanded.
"All right now," Watson instructed, "close your eyes and then feel for me. Think in the direction of my voice and focus your mind towards mine."
To his credit, Mycroft listened, his massive body squeezed into one of the oversized chairs, and his face pulled into a craggy frown.
It was thrilling. Watson navigated the slate covered canopy with the sure-footedness of a mountain goat, leaping across rooftops and gutters and streets, dodging telegraph cables and chimneys with preternatural dexterity while below them London twinkled and smoked. Off in the distance, the great black serpent of the Thames wound its way through the heart of London, boats moving back and forth like fireflies on the surface of the water.
"How often has he fed from you?"
"His confession will take patience..."
It was not a hard promise to make. "I swear it," he said, and was gratified as the tension in Holmes' shoulders released the slightest bit. "If there is anything else I can do-" he began, but Holmes cut him off.
"Holmes," he whispered, voice rough and desperately wanting, “Oh, Holmes...”
his eyes glowing..." Montressor shuddered, nearly overcome.
That made the inspector laugh outright, a jarring sound that bounced off the white-washed walls. But this was not the sort of place that encouraged merriment, and he sobered soon enough. "Well, I suppose you know him best."
“Fight him!” Watson shouted, though of course his words would mean nothing to Holmes right now, not while under the influence of an Order. Watson grabbed the back of his chair and spun him around, pushed him away.
“What’s happened?” he asked, meeting Holmes halfway across the room. “Something is troubling you...”
“It is enough,” Holmes assured him, because it wasn’t really about the physical; that was only one aspect of many. This thing between them was so much deeper and richer and purer than any of that, that if Watson could do nothing at all Holmes would be content to do no more than lay by his side. It was not so wholly unsuspected in any case. If Watson's skin could not flush, he almost certainly could not become aroused, not in the physical sense. But Watson’s hands were as skilled here as they were in the surgery, and he soon unraveled Holmes completely, had him shaking and spent in his arms, thoughts no longer a torrenting river but a slow trickling brook, and every one of them had Watson at its center.
“Then why not kill Newman himself?”
Now free of its influence as well, Holmes saw no reason to remain clinging to consciousness.
"Did Stamford tell you of his dreams in the months leading up to his death?" Holmes asked softly.
"I see. Well then, consider yourself hired." He turned and walked lazily down the hall. "Will you stay and say what you've learned, or are you keen to return to the streets once more?"
"You did not merely thrall my brother," Mycroft replied, “for thrall seeks to impose the will of the vampire over that of its victim. It erases autonomy and choice, and is both temporary and deliberate. Bonding is quite a different occurrence, involving the fusing of two wills into one; the connection of one soul to another, were we to take a theological perspective. It is
"Your pet lunatic wants to climb up to the roof like a monkey and gawk at the body,” Gregson snapped.
Holmes picked up a tin and gave it a light shake; it rattled with the unmistakable sound of coinage. "His wages for the week I assume...curious he would leave it behind, don't you think?
Once the instructions had been given he doled out a handful of copper pennies and sent the boys off in search of food. He watched as they scattered like seeds, then turned his attention back to the church in contemplation of those tombstone grey walls, the ominous archway like a great maw and the huddled masses desperate enough to seek shelter within.
Holmes screamed too, feeling the vampires pain as it withered and died as surely as he had felt its hunger while it lived. But the connection was purely a mental thing, and he was free of it once the pathetic creature was gone.
Holmes then examined the neck, hands and feet, a crease forming between his brows. He checked the bottom of the man’s shoes, found something of interest and pressed it to his tongue before turning his head and spitting.
send him to spy on you. Your meeting was coincidental, and the feelings that developed between you genuine.”
Jackson smiled slightly. "This is more like what I expected. Very well, I shall prove it to you then. What piece of evidence would you find most convincing? The temperature and texture of my skin, perhaps?" He pulled off his gloves and held out a thin, white hand.
Holmes gave a grunt of agreement, and Newman spent the next quarter hour showing him about, much of that time spent in the shed where Father Deighton kept a small menagerie of a single parrot in its own cage and six clip-winged doves in a coop.
The conversation lulled, and the silence between them was not as easy a thing as it had been in times past. Holmes was keenly aware that Mycroft did not trust him, and that his insistence that he stay at the Diogenes was done as much to keep a watchful eye on him as it was to protect him from external forces.
"I am well used to danger," Holmes replied, watching the scene with reserved fascination. "But I appreciate the warning."
He still worried that Holmes’ cavalier attitude toward the business would fade with the thrall, but it was a feeling he was getting increasingly good at ignoring. After all, there was no remedy to be had, and no way out but through. As Holmes himself had said, what was done was done.
“Ireland!” he cried in sudden understanding.
"Of course," Holmes said. "But-" he closed his eyes a moment, gathering his strength. "-how is it a single day has fomented such a change in you? I saw you just last night; you did not seem unwell, nor had any trouble mastering yourself. Why were you suddenly so ravenous?"
The family name was Moriarty, anglicized from the old Irish
"Can I be of any further assistance, Inspector?" Holmes asked, still badly injured and deeply tired and Lestrade was at least smart enough to catch the dismissal in his voice.
you try to command me!" he thundered, standing up. Watson stood as well, glaring and unafraid.
a mistake could have been made; thralling seemed simple enough in its execution.
Holmes was obviously thinking the same thing. "Well, it is comforting to know your assistance is available for twelve hours out of the day. I will endeavor to face peril only between the hours of sundown and sunup."
"Did they remove anything?" He went to the most well-used books first, those with a focus on vampires specifically. Kramer had thought he was dealing with a supernatural evil. He would have researched; he would have wanted to be certain.
"The... easiest way to do this will be for you to drink from me; the amount of blood needed to cure all your wounds is extensive, and trying to drip it into your injuries would be needlessly messy."
“What?” Holmes asked him, and then to his questioning look added, “You wish to tell me something.”
"And what did you hear?" Holmes asked, wishing the man would come to the point.
London, 18--
For a moment he sat unmoving, stunned and star dazed, drawing breaths he did not technically need but which calmed him none the less. Then he looked at Holmes.
“You seem to have accepted the idea with a great deal of equanimity.”
“I know him better than anyone else. Even so, there are times when the inner workings of his mind remain a mystery. But he has certainly seen something useful in you, and for that we should be thankful. It will go a long way towards preserving your life.”
“Holmes!” Watson cried, and shook him gently, but there was no response, no awareness in his blank, staring eyes. Watson reached out with his mind and encountered a solid wall of noise.  A moment later Sturgerson came striding out of the inner room, alerted by Watson’s voice.
"Well, I might ask that you be more discreet in your disposal next time, should circumstance force your hand again."
Of far more interest to him was the fact that he had detected no pulse, no proof that any life flowed through the doctor’s cold limbs.
"No. He read my thoughts one night at my behest as a point of scientific inquiry; his presence was unmistakable, as was its absence. And since the thrall, I can find the shadow of him in my mind if I stretch my senses to look for it. It was not present that night.”
“A fascinating question. One of many.”
“Then you should not take offense when they are pointed out,” Holmes replied with infuriating reason.
"None that comes to mind. Though if you let me go, I shall hobble about a bit and give it some thought. I'll be sure to keep you informed."
"No one else will make you their thrall," Watson said firmly, rolling up his sleeve. The he bit down on his own wrist and quickly brought it to Holmes' mouth.
"You won't believe me," Jackson said with amused certainty, but continued anyway. "I am not technically alive."
"The roof of Saint Cyprian's Church, right here in Marylebone," Lestrade said. "No one's got a damn idea how it got up there. It's a gentleman, that's about all we can tell."
... it is unbearable." He shifted, shoulders hunched up like a twisted thing, Quasimodo in his bell tower. He drew a long breath on his pipe, watching Watson through a grey curl of smoke. The doctor still didn’t understand.
Watson looked away at that, stared into the fire, popping embers reflecting in his eyes like starlight on a river. "There are things that one does, especially soon after the change, that are often regrettable," he said softly. "Unless proper guidance is given, it can be quite...destructive."
"Do... do you want to stay here?" Watson asked hesitantly, and Holmes' own heart cried out against it. But the heart was a lawless creature.
"Do you play music?” he suggested, “Write, perhaps?"
Watson could hardly blush, but his mannerisms belied his discomfort. “Holmes-” he cautioned, glancing in mortification at Mycroft, who was far too used to his brother’s provocateur nature to react at all.
Holmes made no reply, because he did not yet have the data necessary to extrapolate an answer. They read on.
"Photosensitivity is a rare but documented condition; it is often combined - and even the cause of - sleep disorders." He was not actively trying to disprove Watson's claim; not exactly. He was simply applying what he knew of science to what he observed before him and comparing the results. "You say you feast on blood?" he reached into the pocket of his robe and withdrew a magnifying glass, examining each of Jackson’s fingernails in turn. "What of other food and drink? And what of bodily fluids?" His movements became more animated as he spoke, mind latching onto the mystery before him with singular focus.
"An unbreakable bond," Sturgerson added, "at least, according to all research...though there is not much to be had. Bonding is a very closely kept secret among vampires."
With no small amount of vexation, Holmes discovered he had nothing at all to say to that.
"I am not most men, and it was a better alternative than having you waylay an unsuspecting victim."
Holmes allowed himself a moment of anger. Damn it...damn Montressor and damn Watson too. How many laws was he compelled to break in order to keep Watson's secret? If the police found Montressor
Perhaps not.
The dead man’s name was Nelson Langley, a former sergeant in her majesty’s army. Whilst overseas he had suffered from a nervous breakdown that affected his mind and was summarily discharged, having been deemed unfit for service.
"The vicar, apparently. As for his reasons...to answer that, we must foray into the realm of speculation. But were we able to examine the boy I believe we would discover he suffered from some horrific mental or physical abnormality that necessitated he be kept apart from society...or perhaps he simply inherited his father’s madness. Either way, Deighton seemed to think his son could be cured through the power of faith and human sacrifice- he certainly went on a great deal about the purification of blood during my stay. I suspect his twisted mind sought to 'cure' the child’s ailment through the blood of others. How he planned to go about this, I do not know." It was a lengthy speech, and more than he had said in two days. It left him feeling tired and that annoyed him.
tell him what to do several times! Which of us is truly trying to control him?" Watson replied icily.
He perked up, "Correspondence, from who?"
He walked a bit farther, and then spoke again. “I am meant to be instructing you. Let us try something simple. Think of a tree, any kind you like. Picture it in your mind, and try to stop me from seeing it.”
The man moaned again, but Holmes had no comfort to offer. He dare not reveal that help would (eventually) come.
Watson shook his head. “I still do not like the idea of leaving you here alone, certainly not in your present state.” It was an understatement, to say the least. But the least was all Watson allowed himself to say.
think Newman will begin abducting people again now I am gone, and Montressor arrested? He must believe he is safe." Watson sighed thoughtfully, looking out the window at the cobbled street below. "How are you feeling?"
Upon entering Baker Street he was immediately accosted by Mrs. Hudson, who berated him soundly for being gone so long without word, flapping about him like a maddened bird as she shoved a letter into his hands.
“All men have sins,” the priest answered with chilling indifference.
The rest of their walk was taken in silence, and they soon arrived back at the spot where Montressor awaited them with an anxious expression. Holmes deposited her gently into her husband's care and stepped away. "There, you see monsieur; your wife is unharmed, and unchanged. There are things to fear in this world, but the doctor's 'magic' is not one of them."
"And what of his
Watson already knew what choice Holmes would make, for his sake.

send word if there is an emergency; I will come."
"When I believe your opinion to be crucial to the investigation, I shall ask you for it," Holmes bit out, motioning him over with an impatiently flapping hand. The boy looked ridiculous in his constable's uniform, jacket and trousers both too long, helmet swallowing his head like a black-jawed beast.

"Both, but not during a case. It is not...pertinent."
"I will," he promised, "As long as I can." He pulled Holmes down to the settee again, his body cold against Holmes’ own. "You are the most wondrous man," he muttered into Holmes' hair.
"If you take him with you, this truce is over," Mycroft growled. Watson paused.

“It was a private correspondence between Master and thrall,” he reminded, “and Moriarty certainly had no reason to deceive Newman as to his identity.”
"For what purpose?"
“Provided no one else comes looking for you,” Holmes pointed out.
Holmes sighed. "Mister Montressor, you are raving. Please calm yourself and then tell me your story, beginning to end; leave no detail out. And-" he looked around, "might I suggest I come inside, where there are fewer ears?"
"He said he dreamed of fire! There’s
, Watson. Technology, innovation and automation. We stand on the brink of a new age; civilization is in the midst of an industrial revolution with England at its core...and at the core of England is London. What vampire playing this great game of civilization would forgo the opportunity to capture this city for themselves? What city in all of Europe poses such strategic value? There is Paris, but it is known for its artists and lovers more than its industry, and I do not think I would be wrong in assuming it's claim is already well laid by some clan or another. But here? There is no claim, and no clan. There is only

would have to show good faith. Oh, but if Watson came to harm...Holmes honestly could not say how he would react. If Watson died and the thrall died with him, how would he feel? He would certainly not be happy with his brother; Watson had been an ally even before the thrall. But how much would he truly care? How much of these feelings were mere illusion? All of it, if what he has been told was truth.
"Aye, sure. He's at home with the Missus," she replied, pointing up at the flat above them.
"You will be there to stop her, should your wife try to run away," Holmes reminded him. "As will I. I swear to you, no harm will befall her."
(See the end of the chapter for
Holmes moved past all of that, unconcerned. He finally found what he was looking for in a passage written some four months previous. Here the handwriting became suddenly and violently distressed, words an inky smear where the author’s hand had passed through them, marring the page.  Beside him Watson leaned forward, and together they carefully deciphered the tortured writing.
He sighed and climbed down, instructing the firemen to handle the body with care.
"As for the dead man, he sealed his fate when he followed me to your flat last night."
He eventually returned home because there was nowhere else to go. Mrs. Hudson was preparing an early supper when he came in, clothes damp from the drizzling rain. She poked her head out of the kitchen and yelled up the stairs at him as he passed by.
Holmes didn't look up from his assortment of beakers as he answered. “Because he will have no choice. He is moved by either compulsion or necessity and either way, his hand will soon be forced; it has been too long. When he strikes again, we shall know of it and hopefully intercept him before he can complete his dark mission."
Watson glanced at him askance, and were it not for the fact he had touched Holmes' mind and knew the great breadth and depths of it himself, he would think the man was sporting with him. But Holmes was not sporting.
“That remains to be seen,” Holmes replied, hard gleam in his eyes, "but one thing I will
“North,” Holmes answered immediately, “no more than a day’s ride from London. Unfortunately, by train that puts him nearly anywhere between here and Scotland.”

"I'm confident you'll manage." He glanced to the window. "It will be dawn soon, but I have time to stay a bit longer."
"How strong are your powers of suggestion?” Holmes asked suddenly, and Watson blinked in surprise at the abrupt shift in conversation.
"I don't trust you yet."
“A reasonable supposition,” Holmes agreed, his face clean of all guile. “What of motive?”
was supposed to have been the mad one. "If the doctor is as dangerous as you believe, then surely bringing him to justice would be the logical route." Holmes said reasonably.
He sighed theatrically and conceded the battlefield, retreating up the steps to his rooms. London would fall before he admitted it, but he'd missed her tea. He paused on the landing, turning back to her with a lift of his brow. "The doctor- I don't suppose you recall his name, by chance?"

"Fascinating," he murmured, then louder, "And are the effects permanent?"
He was not gone long, some few minutes perhaps but even so when he returned he found Holmes on the verge of losing consciousness, though he came awake for the promise of water.
Watson was unsurprised to see him. "Come inside," he invited, stepping out of the way.
"How are you feeling?" the vicar asked, the words seeming oddly genuine.
“I never knew you spoke ancient Aramaic.”

All he had asked for in return was honesty, and Watson had failed him there, too.

He sat anyway; there was nothing else to be done.
Holmes usual reaction to Mycroft's anger would be playfulness, but this incident had revealed a good deal, and there was nothing playful about any of it.
Holmes set the paper down. "They only left out a few vital facts and fabricated a few more," Holmes remarked. "All in all, better than one usually expects from the press."
"It certainly makes your situation more compelling," Holmes replied. But there were many scientifically acceptable reasons for cold hands. Poor circulation, nerves, consumption...
Holmes sighed. Under normal circumstances mysterious strangers knocking at Baker Street in the dead of night were Mrs. Hudson's purview but she was visiting a sister and so Holmes was obliged to deal with it himself, which he did by opening the upstairs window and shouting down,
The doctor shrugged. "You can tell them whatever you like. I killed a man in self-defense, Mister Holmes; I won’t apologize for that. Then I made use of the corpse, that's all. They got the message; I should be safe for another decade at least.”
“However,” he continued, “I am not currently without a case, am I? I am in fact in the middle of what I may safely say is the most fascinating, important and dangerous case of my career, and perhaps in the history of modern London. And yet, I can
a man. You are a vampire, and one who holds my brother under a thrall. An unforgivable offense.”
“Give him time to reflect and repent,” he said, and Newman cast him a dark look, but dropped his arm.
For once Holmes did not correct any of the inspector's erroneous conclusions. "I not only remember him, I was working for him. He hired me because he feared someone was after him. He was right." Holmes didn’t have to feign the regret in his voice, though it came from a different source than the one Lestrade assumed.
"You would be surprised at the damage an incompetent doctor can do," he snipped, carefully unwinding the bandages around Holmes’ shoulder and knee, prodding gently at the wounds. Fortunately the blood Watson provided had caused both injuries to begin healing at a preternatural rate, and free from all signs of infection. Though the shoulder had been stitched closed the knee was still an open wound, but inside bones were mending faster than they should, and exposed flesh granulating. All-in-all, good signs that Holmes would heal in due course.
"You would think
“My beloved.”
The sound of the gunshot was deafening in the small room, like standing next to a lightning strike. The bullet ripped through flesh, lodging into the thick muscle of his upper thigh and the searing, blinding pain of it momentarily wiped his brain clean of thought.
There were too many questions and fallacies of logic in regards to anatomy for Holmes to tackle there, so he put it aside for the moment and continued. "You say your heart does not beat; why then does the blood not settle in your hands and feet? How does it circulate through your body with nothing to pump it through?"
"Of course!" Holmes emerged from the bedroom in his usual fashion of haphazard dress, waistcoat askew and cuffs undone. Lestrade looked him over once more and seemed about to speak but Holmes gave him no chance, sweeping out of the room with far more vigor than he felt.
Holmes acknowledged the truth of this, London was teeming with petty evils. But he surmised Watson had not gone hunting for criminals in many years, preferring to drink only from his patients; people who came to him willingly in search of blood letting services, and left his office alive once they had both gotten what they wanted. He had existed in this manner for a long time, taking what he needed to survive, but no more.
The whole business took less than seconds and still he was almost too late, the vampire held back only by the bonds around his wrists and the fact the bed was clamped to the floor. Even so, the creature had a hold on Holmes’ mind and the detective was pathetically attempting to reach it, one bloodied and trembling hand outstretched, mere inches away from the creatures’ mouth.
He was lying collapsed into his chair, eyes open and body twitching faintly, alive with tics and jumps that had no rhythm behind them.
"I haven't lied to you about anything," Jackson said slowly, his voice becoming heavy, the air around them growing thicker, more oppressive.
"It certainly is," Holmes agreed, and then he was gone.
For all of that, the door had barely closed before Holmes fit himself purposefully into Watson’s arms again, the two of them pulled inexorably together; planets stuck in each other’s orbit.
Watson watched him avidly, thoroughly invested and Holmes felt gratification spark in his chest like a warm ember. The rapt attention of men he was used to; this was something different, something
ensnaring him once again. "Holmes - I can't, I refuse! I've never turned anyone into a thrall, it wouldn't be right!"
Holmes held the lamp close to the pale face, watching intently but the doctor’s pupils did not react to the change in light. He reached out, brushing his fingers against flesh that was cold and stiff as a corpse. He tried to move Watson’s arm and felt sluggish resistance, ossified muscles tightened and slow to respond.
He let out a ponderous breath, grey smoke filling the air between them. "No, I have not heard of it."
“Not so great as it has been. I believe I am on a four-hour cycle of morphine.”
“You should have told me,” he chastised, frowning slightly. They could have come together...Watson would have been more than a match for all three of them. It never would have come this, Holmes laying half dead on the floor, bleeding and broken.
“As your

help - and the detective felt himself thaw, frost retreating to the shadows. Not gone, but abated.
All right then, it had been petty of him, and he was marginally disappointed in himself to find that after a hundred years, he still had the capacity for such picayune urges. But then again he had worked hard to retain his humanity, to live among mortals and love them and feed on them without killing. To befriend them. Perhaps a moment here and there of all too human weakness was no more than his due.
"Watson- don't!" he shouted, ducking in front of Watson to square off against his brother.
Now observe:  here is a man of decent wardrobe in good health, who's girth indicates a hearty appetite, yet the contents of his stomach suggest he had not eaten a true meal since breakfast. There are no particular religious holidays that require fasting this time of year, and a pastry is not the nibblet of a man skipping meals to lose weight. Ergo, he has been in an urgent rush today, so much so that he has eaten nothing since early morning and bought a penny pastry from a shop to stave off hunger."
He knew he should hate this feeling, knowing his mind was not his own, that this infatuation was born of something other than himself and yet, he did not. Though he also accepted that as the thrall faded, he would likely begin to feel differently.
"Indeed. Would you like to hear my conclusions?" he asked, and Deighton motioned for him to continue. "You are insane," Holmes said definitively.
"Come inside, my fellow, the Lord blesses all his flock."
And now finally, Holmes had all the information he required. “I will look into it, when I've the time,” Holmes promised. “Good day, gentlemen.” It was not lost on him that if Newman indeed knew Watson was a vampire, his intentions amounted to little more than sending Holmes straight to his death...and there would be one less detective in London sniffing around the church and asking questions about missing men.
"Aye," he replied, and related again his short tale.
"Yes, you who are supposed to be dead.” Even in his current condition the tone was unmistakably acerbic.
"If that is true, he is a remarkably gifted actor."
"Good afternoon,” he greeted him, “I'm here to speak to my brother, Mycroft. The lad is with me; he knows the rules. Do be a good fellow and show us to the Stranger's Room."
"I see. And what was the husband's name?"
Newman shouted and crumpled, dropping the cudgel as his hands sought to protect himself. Holmes reached through the door and hauled him out by the scruff of his neck, tossing him up against the stone wall of cellar and clocking him soundly in the face. His knees buckled and Holmes left him in a graceless slide to the floor. He stepped into the small room, the air already heavy with the smell of blood.
"And I think you're due a place in hell," Holmes replied with as much malicious cheer as could be managed.
Watson nodded. "I will see you at the shop, then." Watson did not require breath and was therefore unaffected. The only danger fire held for him were the flames themselves. He slipped down the alley, becoming no more than a shadow and was suddenly gone, vanishing like a desert mirage.
The officer looked over at him with a startled blink, “Sir?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“If they do not hang him first,” Mycroft amended, “and I came to the same conclusion myself some days ago. By that time, Montressor had been in custody for several hours already. But here, we are at your home.”
that much; he had been in the man’s head not two hours ago. Besides, were he to turn his senses in that direction, he would still be able to feel Holmes' desire shimmering around him like a heat mirage. Holmes still thought he loved Watson and still wanted him and both those feelings were a product of thrall, ergo it was not yet gone. In any case, it had not even been a full week since the thrall began; not nearly long enough for it to fade.
"His rooms?" the vicar repeated, sounding puzzled. "He slept in the shed behind the clergy house. I suppose it could do no harm to take a look. Father Newman tells me the man himself has run off."
," he said dumbly, and Holmes smirked at him.
But fascinating as it all might be, this secret knowledge of the inner workings of Holmes' mind did not help Watson understand the importance of a parrot.
“How, Watson. How could I willingly fugue, when you had already stated your objection to the idea?” He paused, trained those dark eyes squarely upon Watson’s own and asked calmly, “Am I not still under thrall?”
And that was that; Mycroft had delivered his ultimatum and would not be moved. No one could move Mycroft once he had planted himself; not even Holmes.
He was still thinking it all over as he dropped down onto the window ledge, opening the casement Holmes had left unlocked for him. He would eventually have to start using the front door, but that required influencing Mrs. Hudson’s mind and he didn’t feel like it at the moment.
The hour was far too early and he was far too exhausted to deal with Mrs. Hudson's clucking.
Watson smiled fondly. “He did say you disliked both doctors and hospitals, and preferred to look after your own health.”
"A ten percent tincture for morphine," Holmes answered immediately, “seven for cocaine.” He cocked a glance in Watson’s direction, critical tilt to his eyebrows. "I am not as careless as you and Mycroft seem determined to make me."
"The things I do for you," he muttered to Stamford under his breath as he tied the helpless man up. He then secured him in the storage room, made certain both bonds and gag were secure and locked up with Montressor's key before sneaking out the back, stealing a packet of matches on the way out. In the alley behind the store he tore off his disguise and stuffed it into the bottom of a rubbish bin, then headed up the stairs to the flat above, knocking urgently on the door.
"Hmmm," Holmes rumbled, "I suppose you ought to come in then." He left the window, threw on a dressing gown, stuck a pipe in the corner of his mouth and went downstairs, running a hand through the snarled tangle of his hair. He pulled open the door and stepped aside, waving the man in with an impatient gesture. He wondered briefly at the odds of the whole thing being a waste of time, but given the hour there was bound to be something to the business.
"Thank you so much Mr. Holmes," Lucy said, leaning on her husband. They turned and headed up the stairs to their flat.
"I doubt they will be looking for me at parliament in any case."
He did not bother with coyness or chicanery, nor did he hold his cards close. Mycroft was both alarmed and angry, and that was a fatal combination. Though his brother was the most indolent of men and abhorred physical exertion of any kind, he was far from harmless, for anything could be moved if enough pressure was applied. Mountains formed when the plates of the earth crashed together, and Mycroft Holmes abandoned his routine when he judged his younger brother to be in need of his assistance. Both were equally impressive in their scope, and terrifying to anyone who might be too close to the epicenter.
"Yes. I told you, I wish to keep an eye on you. I can afford no more bloodless corpses turning up on rooftops; I am out of tricks."
Holmes turned his attention towards her, nodding his head in lieu of a bow. "Mrs. Montressor, I presume?"
, and then Holmes would be obliged to hate his brother. He didn’t hate Mycroft and didn’t want to, but he couldn’t bear the thought of two weeks away from Watson either... "Let him visit me. Each night, here in the parlor. Let us see each other; under observation if need be. Grant me that, and I will stay."
Watson's eyebrows shot up as he shut the door. "Do I now?" he asked, faint amusement tinting his voice. "This is a rather sudden shift in events. Why?"
"Thank you, now-" Holmes knelt and took a bit of charcoal from his pocket, smearing it on the man’s hands and jacket. Then he locked up the door again and stuck both the key and the packet of matches in Montressor’s pocket. He took a moment to muss the man's hair a bit before standing and brushing off his trousers. "There now. You return to Baker Street; same instructions as before. I'll join you when I'm finished here, though it may not be until nightfall next. If you must flee the dawn it would be best to find somewhere else to weather the light; Baker Street is not yet secure from the sun."
"Don't take my husband!" she begged, trying to hold the constable back with all her weak strength, hands pushing futilely at his chest. The officer gently but firmly moved her out of the way and headed inside. She watched him go with an aborted plea on her lips then spied Holmes, crying out in anguish. "You!!!"
Watson blinked at the sudden change of conversation, then smiled. "I would very much like that as well."
"Does it? Some vampires I have encountered spoke as though spirits were real, but I have never encountered such a presence."
Holmes’ gave an indecipherable hum. Next to him, Lestrade looked increasingly put-upon, the small man shifting weight from foot to foot in agitation.
Newman smirked, noting the momentary surprise. “Perhaps you are not so indispensable as you believed.”
“It’s all right; I’m just happy your brother decided to let me live...for the moment.”
"I cannot say. I would like to kiss you again."
“Christ in heaven, why!?”
“Then you had best get started,” Mycroft answered, deeply unsympathetic and a faint smile touched Holmes' lips.
Holmes, of course, did nothing to alleviate his torment.
Watson had such a look about him.
"You should sit down," he said, his voice a low, purring growl, eyes burning into Holmes’ own, searing like fire. The words were more than a suggestion, they were an Order, impossible to resist.
Holmes studied his brother unreservedly. “You have doubts.” If Mycroft truly believed all of that, he wouldn't be telling Holmes any of it. Not while the thrall remained.
It was a somewhat cluttered space; not quite as disastrous as his own but the man had clearly been a bachelor as well as a profound bibliophile. Several cases of books lined one wall, with more of them piled on the floor and table and anywhere else room could be found.   Holmes walked over to a sturdy looking wardrobe, opened it and was unsurprised to find it crammed with more books again, several falling loose of the pile and tumbling down to his feet.
Watson to stop himself, even as he watched Watson struggle against his own dark impulses. Was there another such man in the world? Probably, but Watson had never met them.
The man nodded, and began. "I became aware of him a night or two ago. He was stalking my habits, lurking near my home. This alarmed me, as I have a few enemies who would be willing to kill me."
“It was...surprising, is all,” he said dismissively, “A momentary shock of the senses. I shall be over it soon enough.”
"We shall see," Holmes replied, looking around with mild interest.
Despite what Stamford might have said to the contrary, Holmes had no trouble quitting a game while he was ahead, and Father Newman's interest seemed to be growing a bit too keen. In any case, he had learned as much as was convenient in the role of aviculturist.
, if only Montressor had trusted him.  Then again, this all took place during the two weeks Holmes was busy ignoring Watson’s existence and doing occult research of his own. If Mycroft had discovered Watson
Watson darted forward with preternatural swiftness, stealing a kiss from his lips. "Never," he said. Then, "I shall miss you terribly."
!” he growled, the word deep and gravely, the power that infused it almost a tangible thing, shimmering in the air between them.  A chill crept into the room as the heat of the fire seemed to diminish.
The lad bobbed his head in acknowledgment and began. “Well sah, it were like this...”
Mycroft spared him a staid half-glance. “It is gratifying to know your brains still work, if properly agitated.”
"...Yes. Excellent."
"It is all quite biblical," Newman assured him, "supported by scripture. God loves the sacrificial lamb."
"I can help you," Watson offered suddenly, sensing the wave of painful nostalgia that washed over Holmes; vague impressions of Stamford, feelings of loss. "You don't have to do this entirely on your own. It's my problem and I dragged you into it -- let me look into Kramer. You say the man was fond of billiards; such places are open well after dark. I can ask about, find out his favorite haunts."
For various reasons, Watson attempted to steer the conversation elsewhere. "Will you stay till dawn?" he asked again, sitting down in the opposite chair. "You have done much for me, let me watch over you this once."
The day he died the world turned grey.
Holmes was in no mood for this at all, even less so than usual. "I am not a show pony,” he snipped crisply, “and I will not stand uselessly about for the sake of onlookers when a crime has been committed; that is what you have officers for." He turned on his heel and nodded to Lestrade. "Do feel free to contact me when you have something for me to
"A lifetime can be a very long thing," Jackson said slowly. "You are lucky yours will have an end, some day." He stepped away from Holmes then, frowning deeply. "But not today. I won't make you break your promise to our mutual friend."
Jackson didn't flush; if anything he became paler, his eyes hard as flint. After a moment he sneered, lip curling back against glittering white teeth. "My appearance is hardly important. A man is going to try to take my life, Mr. Holmes. Are you going to do anything about that?"
“No,” Father Newman said. “Everything is as he left it. I had thought he simply wandered off. The indigent do make a habit of it.”
“Why didn’t you tell me?” he demanded, a thin layer of hoarfrost coating the words. Stamford was not there, and so Mycroft bore the brunt of Holmes' turmoil. Perhaps that was unfair, but things were as they were.
The air in the room grew heavy and oppressive, bearing Holmes down as though he were a criminal being pressed beneath a stone weight. It pulled on his very veins and arteries, blood sluggishly struggling to reach his brain. Georgie, seemingly unaffected,  looked curiously about the room and Holmes tried to call for him, but all that escaped his lips was a wheezing rasp; the air had turned to damp cloth and he was choking on it. He tried to move next, but his body remained immobile, oppressed heaviness infusing his limbs.
"Better some days than others," Holmes admitted with a lackadaisical shrug, and it was a good day so no one privy to his inner thoughts - as Watson had just been - would guess at the organized chaos raging behind those dark eyes. "Cocaine helps. So does morphine, and music. But nothing helps so well as work. When there are problems and puzzles...that is when my mind is most at peace. When I've something to
Holmes sighed, setting his hand to his temple, feeling the bandages that covered the stitches which held his head together. "I would have done things far differently if I had known. But, it is pointless to dwell on it now. We must look to the future. The sire will know his protege is dead; he will come looking for answers. Perhaps not himself- it is likely he will send someone. Either way, he will know the story in the papers is false. There was only one witness to the whole affair, and that is me. You are not safe here. Certainly not during the day. Not if he sends a thrall."
"You," she spit, her voice hoarse. "What do you want?"
"Good afternoon," he said with an elegant bow, "I'm looking for Michael Kramer's landlady."
Holmes pursed his lips. Perhaps it happened with immortality that one became less concerned with living as the years stretched on. It certainly seemed true that one became less helpful. Why had he agreed to this case again? Ah yes, because Stamford would have asked it of him.
Newman raised his arm, a shillelagh of knotted blackthorn in his hand. “For the blood of the covenant is poured out for the forgiveness of sin,” he began, but that was quite enough of that.
safety cannot be guaranteed in any other venue. If he can be trusted to come here to speak with us, then I promise he will leave unharmed."
“I will see what can be discovered.”
"Will you...will you stay?" The words were soft, little more than breath. The dose had been a heavy one, and Holmes was almost asleep.
"Of course," the constable acquiesced grudgingly. He skipped briskly up the steps and Holmes followed, watching as he knocked loudly upon the door with his club. "Come out, Montressor! Scotland Yard!" He glanced back at Holmes. "He hasn't got a back door, has he?"
The presence of Watson’s mind pressing against his became apparent at once, like a mental shadow, but one with mass and weight. He experienced a strange feeling of buzzing lightheadedness, a minor charge like static across his brain. Something dark and cold and not his own slithered around within his mental landscape and Holmes was reminded rather unpleasantly of tentacles.
Watson shook his head as he returned the kettle to its place. "I don't think so, no. There were a few who made the claim, but I didn't believe them."
"And you are certain this man is after you specifically?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"No indeed; I came to the Yard as soon as I had his identity, as I think we can agree there are better men suited to that particular task."
“Of course I am going. There is little point in standing about watching him twitch.”
The answer, of course, is that he would. Very soon most likely, assuming he had not done so already. And because Holmes had let himself be removed from the case, he had no way of knowing when such an eventuality would occur.
was the creature Montressor had so feared, fierce-eyed and ravenous, impossible fangs grown long past his lips.
and warmth spread through his body as he felt Watson shudder and sigh in the chair next to him. The warmth quickly turned to desire and he found himself reluctant to stop as a drunken feeling of uninhibitedness washed over him. The world softened and shone like a morphine high and he could feel Watson's Will singing in his veins, taking hold of his mind but it was akin to a gentle embrace rather than an iron grip and he sank into it, unafraid.
Father Deighton let out a slow breath and stepped aside. Newman appeared behind him, club in hand and unlike the vicar, there was no reticence to his character. He was a man who obviously enjoyed his work.
. So, when Watson told Holmes to focus his mind on him, well.
"Mycroft works in the government. Indeed, some might say he
He stayed out of the lamplight, clinging to the shadows as he snuck around to the back entrance and Watson was there already, stepping out of the hazy fog as Holmes approached.
let me stay with you. I will leave before dawn; no one need know I was ever here." Noting Holmes' waxy pallor, the distressed rhythm of his breath, he spoke more gently.  "And if you are still in great pain, I might be able to ease it a bit more."
He aged as slowly as his heart beat; which science would posit there being a correlation. The affliction, curse - whatever one called it, not causing death but rather slowing it, reducing the natural wear on mortal flesh to a fraction of its usual pace. The average human heart beat eighty times a minute. Watson’s beat only once. One heartbeat per minute. One minute per day...how long before that golden hair finally turned grey? Did they ever live to see themselves grow old, or were they dispatched before then?
"I don't think the Yard has the right to summon a Bishop," Lestrade said with a doubtful frown.
"I can only promise amnesty for one meeting."
He did not go directly to the vicar, instead he simply flagged down the first person in black he found and introduced himself.
Inside the morgue proper it was cold and dark and damp, air stale and heavy with the smell of decaying flesh. In the corner great blocks of ice slowly melted atop three cadavers, keeping them chilled as they awaited autopsy and then interment. The miasma of blood and decomposing bodies was thick enough to taste and Dr. John Watson was red up to his elbows, hands buried deep in the body of their victim. He glanced up as they walked in, nodding his hello to the inspector and turning to Holmes with a face smooth as porcelain and innocent as the spring.
"A feint. You say he is clanless, but what if he is not? He has positioned himself quite well here as our 'ally'. He requires only a common enemy to engender trust. Once he has achieved that, he can begin to destroy us from within."
This time Watson laughed outright. "As I said, I have not seen it, but others speak as if it is fact."
"But I would only be able to go in the evening, it would be improper for a bachelor to call upon a lady at such an hour," Watson protested, strangely conscientious of the rigors of English society, those wholly mortal customs.
"I know," he said, voice heavy with regret. "until tonight? You will come again." Plan or no plan, Holmes could not bear to have Watson away so long.
“In a
He just couldn’t recall when.
“Until two weeks ago I did not, but you must admit rather a lot has happened since then.” Two weeks ago he did not believe in vampires, either. “And while it is clear whatever form of witchcraft this fellow practiced failed to save his life, I can no longer discount its existence entirely.”
There was a long silence, then the door opened once more, a single, wide eye glaring out at him. "That man,” Montressor began, voice skating on the edge of low hysteria, “claims to be a doctor only to work his evil on innocent women! My wife! Poisoned by him! Enthralled, hypnotized!"
"I suggested he take a walk, actually," Watson replied, and situated the chair next to Holmes’ bed, taking a seat.
"What were you doing before you were shot?" Holmes asked idly, and Watson sensed a deeper meaning behind his words, some distant point at which he was driving, but he could not see it.
"Beyond mad," Lestrade agreed, his shoulders sagging beneath the weight of his office. "I've seen madness - or I thought I had, until now. This is something truly monstrous." He sighed, "Well. At least London still has its detective."
trigger warnings: none
"Get out of the way, you damn fool," Mycroft snapped.
“I- I don’t have-” he began, but Holmes cut him off.
“What sort of things?” he asked, thinking it was going to be damn hard to focus on anything Holmes had to say if the man insisted on undressing him while he talked. “Is it the crest? Did you discover to whom it belonged?”
"On the contrary, I should think that was her intention exactly."
"You will find the garret room secure tonight,” Holmes said suddenly, apropos of nothing. “That is unless you'd rather back to your underground abode."
"You don't have to be," Watson said, but truth be told, a man who could only come out at night was a terrible guardian.
"I do. The drink is a strong tool of Satan, and it will call to you again. But through the blood of Christ you may be saved. 'But if we walk with God in the Light, blood can cleanse us of all sin,'" the priest quoted.
“Because I had uncovered but a few of their many secrets, and they were quite anxious that I keep the knowledge to myself.”
John Watson would always reach for Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes' face tightened imperceptibly and he clenched his hands behind his back. "I am acutely aware of the fact," he replied, voice thin.
Watson looked grave indeed. “I regret being so rash in regards to Langley now. I had no idea it would bring us such troubles.”
"Sir, I don't like this at all..."
“We will do what we have always done,” Mycroft intoned, “what our coven has done for ages past. Do not think, Doctor, that London’s safety is reliant upon you.”
“That sounds quite dangerous. You should let me come with you. The two of us together can do more than one man alone.”
Holmes had him stripped of both jacket and waistcoat in moments. "You give yourself too much credit. If all the thrall did was reflect your emotions onto me, should I
The morning after Father Newman returned from his forced sabbatical he came to visit Holmes in his shed, the later only just having woken and readying himself to feed the birds. The priest asked after his health in a stiff manner, and Holmes responded by rote. Newman then lingered by the door, regarding Holmes in an odd silence, the shadows on his face filled with secrets. Finally he spoke, words seeming to be pried from his chest by a crowbar.
“When there is no work,” he heard himself continue, “I suffer from ennui; it is a most unbearable condition and I become unbearable under its weight. Stamford knew when I could be cajoled out of such moods and when I could not; I suspect he was a frequent visitor of yours during those darker times. When I have work, it makes me unbearable in an entirely different fashion. I give no thought to food or rest. Indeed, I give little thought to anything save the problem in front of me, the puzzle that requires solving. It gives me a focus; a match in the mineshaft so to speak and I can do nothing but follow it to its eventual end. There is a small space between times, at the conclusion of a successful case and before the boredom catches me that I think I might be a reasonable person to be around, but such moments are few and far between. And now...now I am suffering from the worst of both worlds.”
"Quite a lot of the vicar's affects, but no record of what he was doing. We did come across some fishy correspondences that sound an awful lot like blackmail from what we've been able to make of them."
"There,” he said lightly, voice sounding thin as hammered tin in his ears. “You shall suffer no more. Well, for four hours at least." He smiled, and wondered if Holmes could see how artificial it was.
Mycroft stomped over to the wall and pulled a book off the shelf, opening it to reveal a hollow center filled with bits of dried plants and herbs. He took several and threw them into a copper bowl beside the water decanter, mumbling in a foreign tongue as he set them afire. The weight suddenly lifted from Holmes, and he could move and speak again.
you think?"
"He will certainly not risk confronting you without support," Holmes agreed. "I certainly wouldn't, in his place."
Holmes only shook his head, swatted Watson’s hands away as he made to pick him up again and grimaced at the pain the movement excited.
Before I make a choice you and I will both regret!" He scrabbled desperate hands through his hair, muttering,  “I can find a criminal.”
“Ought ta keep the parrot in the house,” Holmes mused, “He ain’t taking ta being out here with the doves.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not all of us feel quite the same way about vampires as your brother.”
Holmes had a part to play here and it was not the role of a smart man so he simply shrugged and nodded, ignoring the bird. "A'right then."
“I- I don’t understand...” Something was wrong. Holmes should not be immune to influence. And he certainly should not still be in love with Watson...
And there finally was the true source of Mycroft's ire, and the predicament he found himself in. For Mycroft was a vampire hunter...and now his brother's own fate was irrevocably tied to one of the very creatures he had vowed to destroy. And the worst was yet to come, for while it may not happen for many, many years, until Holmes was old and grey and feeble, eventually he would be obligated to say goodbye to the sun, and follow Watson into the endless shadow of night. The alternative was to let Watson die of a broken heart, for while his blood could heal and sustain Holmes for a lifetime, it could not hold back death.
"Kin it?" he asked, letting himself appear curious.
"Easy, Brother." Newman steadied the old priest, then turned towards Holmes. "I must ask that you refrain from upsetting Father Deighton. Mister Langley's death was terrible enough, and he has already been questioned extensively-"
"Have you a spare key?"
“Vampires are the purview of the Prince,” Holmes corrected, lighting his pipe with a long inhale and shaking out the match. “Particularly those who hunt within his territory without leave. They must be feeling emboldened. This is likely a trap to draw him out.”
We are aware that this version of Mycroft deviates from Stephen Fry's portrayal in the 2011 movie. Simply put,this Mycroft did not want to be that Mycroft and refused.
Watson walked unhurried as the dawn approached. He kept a number of alternate sleeping places hidden throughout the city, experience having long ago taught him to be ever vigilant of both the sun and humans alike. More than one vampire had met its end at the hands of well-meaning mortals who had pulled their supposedly dead body out of whatever makeshift shelter they had found to weather the daylight.
Holmes squinted about at the other beggars, then gave a hunched-over shrug and struggled to his feet, dirty crutch shoved tight under one arm. He started to hobble forward, following the reverend but was stopped by a stoop-shouldered mendicant in ratted clothes, wisps of soft white hair floating about his face like feather down.
There was a commotion within, frantic voices and the front door ripped open, Lucy Montressor standing in the doorway looking pale and frightened.
"Why? Are you a relative?" Her eyes narrowed suspiciously. "He told me he had no relatives."
“My own, Doctor John Watson. I was-”
He man looked at him again, eyes and voice steady. “I believe you ought to be damn careful who you talk to, if you’re going to be following Kramer’s trail.”
late update is late. New job means more money but less time for editing.
“You think we should follow his advice?”
Mycroft tipped his chin up. "No."
thing to say that Watson couldn’t help laughing, but then Holmes looked up at him and added with childlike sincerity, “I am yours.”
Behind them Sturgerson busied himself with his novel, eyes trained discreetly on the words in front of him and paying them no heed. It was hardly an ideal situation, but it was likely as close to privacy as they were going to get. That Mycroft would refuse to leave them alone together was a foregone conclusion.
“Has he now,” Holmes replied in a slow drawl, the ice in his voice thick enough to chill a corpse of its own. The intervening days had done little to improve Holmes' opinion of the doctor. He still didn't trust the man - creature - whatever he was, didn’t like whatever game Watson was playing, and had no interest in becoming his latest pawn. Fascinating as the mysteries surrounding the doctor's existence were, the man himself got under Holmes skin in an acutely unpleasant way.
Watson blinked and pulled back at the reaction, fire giving way to a wary sort of confusion. "I'm sorry. I-I didn't think it was relevant."
"I am sorry," he said again as the door slammed shut in his face. He didn’t know what he'd hoped to accomplish. He wandered about after that because it was too early for the fighting rings to be open, but the city held no distractions for him. No murderers lurked in foreboding alleyways, no blackguards with evil intentions crossed his path. For once the world was content to let him be, and he felt there was something deeply unfair about that.
that he knew that much; his emotions were quite strong."
Newman laughed again, a madman's lilt to his voice. "No one is coming for you, certainly not your Master." He grinned cruelly, insanely. "Or did you think he
"I have already told you the truth!" Montressor shouted, ready to work himself into another fit of anger.
So, what to do with his detective? He didn’t know.
"'For the life of a creature is in the blood, and I have given it to you to make atonement for yourselves on the altar; it is the blood that makes atonement for one’s life'," the vicar quoted, looking down at Holmes. "You cannot deny that you are a man of many sins; I know it well."
"So fire and heat
"God be with you," the vicar replied, and laid a blessing upon his head as Father Newman glowered.
Watson gripped the vial and gave it a delicate sniff. “This is pig’s blood- where did you get it?”
"I'm aware of my limitations," he said bitterly.
Holmes nodded again.
"He is an unusually odd individual."
"And we know for certain now they are coming here, likely in force. I wonder if this mysterious sire will appear himself, or rely solely upon his thralls? He surely has other vampires at his disposal, other fledglings he can call upon."
"Flatterer," Holmes replied, voice devoid of humor.
"Ah, Watson...good to see you." He smiled weakly up at the doctor, who frowned back down at him.
A lone candle burned on the table beside him, throwing half his face into shadow. He looked unwell, eyes feverish in the flickering light and a rash of stubble over his cheeks. If anything, he looked worse than when Watson left him the night before. He watched quietly for a few minutes, enraptured by Holmes' pyretic intensity, a sudden and unexpected cynosure. Then he spoke softly, as one might address a startled animal.
. There was something flowing past him, shimmering like gossamer. An undercurrent of love, adoration and deep respect. Holmes could feel it if he concentrated, and tried to reach out with his own mind, to touch that glimmering surface...
"'Old boy?'" Watson asked, shaking his head slightly with amusement as he settled again. "I suppose I could go ask after her. I know where she and her husband live."
Watson opened a desk drawer and withdrew an old army pistol, tossing it over with careless grace. “It’s loaded with silver; I thought it better if I hung onto it.”
"I love you too," he answered softly, almost desperately. "I do, I swear it. Don't let your brother fool you into thinking anything different."
Watson found himself smiling as he stepped into Holmes space, both amusement and curiosity growing. "Should I remove my shirt? I have another in my bag.” It was an old habit left over from the early days of his un-life, before he’d learned to feed without making a mess: always have a clean set of clothes. Perhaps it was silly of him, but he hated appearing unkempt.
"You know very well what I mean," Holmes replied, staring steadily back.
“Be that as it may, I know now, and have involved myself much as you feared. The question before you now is will you stand beside me, or in my way?”
“The boy’s sire,” Watson said immediately, and Holmes nodded.
"But it is rare many of them stay in one place for long," Father Newman interjected, picking up the thread of the coversation.
“I thought you said he wasn’t a priest.”
He followed his feet back to Baker Street but did not go inside; he already knew what he would find there. Instead he walked round to the side alley by the coal shed, kneeling with one knee pressed hard into the dirt. He looked, he observed, he was satisfied. That done he made a similar examination of the ground beneath his parlor window and, finding all as he expected it to be, left.
“Comfort?" Holmes mocked, his mouth warping around the word. "That I was hoodwinked and lied to by the two men I trusted above all others?”
Finally, a callow-faced youth barely out of childhood stepped gingerly into the gaping maw of the alley, lamp held before him like a paltry shield.
Holmes was up to something, Watson was sure of it.
“I do not know.”
“We do not know enough of the condition to theorize,” Holmes chastised.
Holmes shook his head. "The correct answer is 'being observed'. Why did the creature that visited you choose you, specifically, and not the other men who lay dying around you? Is it perhaps because you were fighting to save lives rather than take them? We know only one thing about the one who sired you, and that is she shunned vampiric society as much as you do now."
“I think it probable he had been observing you for some time,” he added.
A brief search of the alley turned over a broken oil lamp and a clump of half burnt cedar. The body itself retained all personal affects including money, negating the possibility of it being a mugging gone wrong.
He stepped within, ducking his head to clear the low ceiling and his senses were immediately assaulted with the heavy scent of copper and iron. The room itself was empty; bare of any adornment save three metal rings set into the far wall. A rough, shallow trench had been cut into the stone floor, leading from the wall to a point halfway to the door. It ended at a hole approximately six inches in diameter and twice as deep. It too, was empty.
"Your silence is answer enough" the vicar said mildly. "But do not worry. Once confession begins, you will see how easy it becomes to unburden your soul, and how welcome the release from earthly cares."
And then there was nothing to do but wait.
"I am more interested in what happened before them," Holmes replied, and flipped purposely through the pages.
Watson watched Holmes as he worked, catching on quickly enough to what was happening.
Mycroft ignored that. “How much of his blood have you drank?”
"Can't we? Is it not the most reasonable explanation for what happened to you?  You say vampires do not create others of their kind without reason. What reason did your sire have for creating you?"
trigger warnings: none
"Till we meet again." He tipped his hat politely, a tint of mockery underscoring the gesture.
"We had an agreement,” Holmes reminded. “I am willing to accept that my mind is not my own and that these feelings may be nothing more than illusion. I am also willing to forgo any blood sharing for the next few weeks while the thrall fades, and accept whatever lay at the end of it. But you must understand brother, there has been mercy in this mirage. The months since Stamford's death have been a waking hell and I have no desire to return to them. For the first time in many months, I am not haunted by guilt and regret. If it is an artificial peace, it is still peace and I am grateful for it as long as it lasts."
"That is precisely the question I am attempting to answer."
Holmes stared into the fire in contemplative silence. Then, “It would seem his abilities lent him a certain, advantage, in that area.”
"Sorted then," Holmes said, and indulged.
from Holmes. If he drank any of that precious blood it would only be to strengthen their connection, to join them together more completely.
"You would be putting your life, you morality, your very
"Everything,” he replied honestly. “Oh Watson...everything. All of you. Forever."
That same certainly that allowed him to offer his blood freely and without fear.
"He was badly wounded, and I wasn’t able to reach him before nightfall. By then, he had been at Newman’s mercy for nearly the whole of the day. I knew that my blood would cure his injuries, but the amount needed to do so would thrall him; he would be forced to bend to my will. I had thought to heal him and then leave immediately, that he could maintain as much of his own will as possible. But..." he faltered, and Holmes knew he was thinking of that first night, the inexorable passion that had come crashing down upon them both like a precipitous wave, washing away all restraint.
Lestrade was speaking again. "No identifying items in the clothing, no personal letters, and no one in the congregation had heard of him before his arriving at the clergy house. The man might have appeared out of thin air."
"Of course I haven't," she assured Holmes, putting a hand on her husband's arm. "I believe my husband, that the doctor was doing something terrible; I have no desire to go back."
humans, we are nothing but food to them, and one does love the pig that is turned into bacon."
see him tonight."
you did not have so thorough a dominion over my mind as we had both presumed.  What better way to test the theory then by direct and irrefutable disobedience?”
"You want me to move into Baker Street?" he said dumbly, and it was such an odd thing to consider, as bizarre a suggestion as if someone recommended he try living on the moon.
“He hasn’t confessed yet!” Deighton protested, and Newman shot him a disgusted look.
Holmes stepped away and Mycroft came up, putting his great bulk between them with a pointed look. Holmes saw Watson's jaw clench but he kept his anger in check, saying nothing as he watched Mycroft lead Holmes away into the bowels of the Diogenes. Of course Holmes looked back, until the last possible instant. Until the door to the inner rooms swung shut and Watson was out of his view entirely. A part of his mind whispered treachery, that Mycroft would kill Watson as soon as Holmes was out of the way...
He ignored the spectators and got to work. The man had been dead some hours already, skin pale and waxy, rigor mortis beginning to stiffen the limbs. The body was dry, but the roof beneath it wet. He turned the man’s head to see his face and recoiled in mild surprise.
"Firstly, you must quit your tenure at the Yard. Then you must steal a corpse on the way out. Having full access to the morgue at all hours, it should not be a difficult task. I once worked a case where a man faked his own death in a house fire, it was quite ingenious. I believe the same scheme will serve us well here. Your home will suffer a tragic fire and all that will be left to find is a charred corpse. I can then have the Yard charge Montressor with Kramer’s murder without risking your involvement."
Despite himself he drifted off eventually, though sleep was neither deep nor restful. He woke a little past dawn, coming out of his room to be greeted with cold tea from the night before. He shrugged and drank it anyway because there was no point in letting it go to waste.
Holmes kissed him back, uncaring of the spectacle they were making. "Nonsense. You've been granted license to visit. Whether we are together here or at Baker Street is of no real significance, and I will be as safe here during the day as anywhere in London."
Watson chuckled, noting the skepticism. "I will say scaling walls feels easier than it should be, even accounting for my increased strength."
They backed out of the chamber. "We will talk in a while," the vicar told him, and then the heavy stone door was pushed into place with a hollow, scraping sound that stole the light from the room until he was left in utter darkness. The man chained to the wall wheezed, a tale-tell rattle in his lungs.
“I’ll only be a moment,” Holmes assured him as he bullied his way inside. “Very queer business going on these days, very queer indeed.“
"What does the cocaine do to your mind?" Watson asked curiously. "The isolation of cocaine as a compound happened fifty years after I was turned."
“The world becomes...too much. More than I can bear, and I must withdraw until it quiets again.”
Holmes shrugged, "I don't remember."
Holmes continued on with his chores.
“I am quite at your disposal,” Holmes replied, which was a rather dangerous thing to say, and Watson quickly reeled in his more indiscreet emotions lest Holmes catch a hint of them, but of course it was Holmes and he was a bastard three times over and so he simply sat there smirking at him and Watson didn’t know if it was his mind or his face that gave him away. He cleared his throat, and began again.
“There’s no time for that. Or do you want to listen to it scream all night?”
Holmes was not looking at him as he replied, "That question is precisely why I need to continue my investigation."
"You'll be alright, just hold on a moment. A slight faintness is to be expected; let me get you the tea I usually serve my patients, it will help." He moved quickly to the fireplace, setting the kettle on and fiddling with tea leaves and sugar, pale hands flashing white against the firelight.
"They won't need to get that close to kill you!" Watson snapped, at least understanding something of Stamford's oft lamented vexation with the detective. It was all well and good to know Holmes' cavalier attitude toward his own well-being was fueled by an almost preternatural desire for justice and a desperate need for mental stimulation, but that didn't stop Watson from wanting to throttle him for it.
“Whatever his strategy,” Mycroft said, “he is almost certainly ready to set it in motion. The body pulled from the Thames is his opening gambit; he will likely wait to see how we respond.”
"Unnaturally so,” Jackson corrected once Holmes had moved back. “And so, you are out of scientific answers. That leaves only the supernatural as an explanation. If you choose to believe, that is."
Watson looked affronted, openly hurt and Holmes wanted to hit him. "I didn't know the vicar had a vampire son," he said, sounding aggrieved. "We had no reason to suspect another vampire had their hands in all this."
The skin of a dead man.
Father Newman's smile was made of smoke. “Very well. As you know, my confidence as a priest is absolute. Hearsay, on the other hand..."

"But her appointment had ended, and she had left," Holmes finished, picking up a letter opener the shape of a small sword and examining it idly. Montressor nodded miserably.
Watson looked disappointed, and Holmes laid a comforting hand on his arm which Watson covered with his own.
"You are not worried he will recognize you?"
“It was incredibly stupid,” Watson said again, and handed Holmes another glass of brandy. They had been discussing Holmes’ decision to willfully fugue. Or rather, Watson had been discussing it, in great long paragraphs that accentuated just how foolish he thought Holmes had been, interspersed with the occasional question as to what flavor of idiocy could have possibly driven him to disregard Watson’s warning.
A victim of thrall had no true free will, though many once freed insisted they could feel themselves fighting back against the will of the vampire controlling them, but to no avail. Direct orders were impossible to disobey and while implied commands could be questioned, ultimately the will of the vampire won out.
"I'm afraid I don't keep up on zoology," Watson replied a bit stiffly, tone turning frosty as a petulant feeling welled up inside him. "I focus on human medicine."
"But Father Deighton is,"  Holmes reminded him, "and Newman could hardly torture and kill half a dozen men in the clergy house basement without Deighton's knowledge, not to mention disposing of the bodies and evidence afterwards. Would my word hold against the word of a vicar, if I did not have proof?”
“Several.”
“What on earth were you thinking? How could you do something so foolish?”
"It may prove a few hours distraction in any case," he said. It was no secret that Holmes was already feeling the tedium of his semi-voluntary confinement, and Mycroft knew perfectly well what sort of havoc his little brother could wreak in a fit of  boredom, the endless mischief he could incite, and the dangerous self-destructive impulses that surfaced. Holmes had never dealt well with idleness, finding it to be its own sort of agony, one that ate away at the edges of his psyche like a rat gnawing a bone. An inescapable torture that left him feeling restless and reckless and dissatisfied with the world and everything in it. It was a state that often drove him to either the cocaine bottle or the fighting pits, when there was no other stimulation to be found.
The young man nodded in relief, hand over his mouth and made a less than dignified retreat, barely making it to the street before doubling over and retching loudly into the gutter. Holmes spared him no attention, turning back to the gruesome scene.
This sudden turn in events meant Holmes had to adjust both plan and timetable, and that required several hasty detours through various parts of the city. By the time he made his way to Watson's practice night had already fallen over London like ash, distorted shadows of people and horses looming out of the lamp-lit fog.
"When we have the man's identity, we will know the answer to that question."
"I was afraid of that," he murmured, then turned to the woman. "Thank you, you have been most helpful."
Mycroft, snorted, watching the scene with open displeasure. "Sickening," he grunted, turning to Holmes. "You two will stay here. I will send Carruthers to Baker Street to fetch your things. Sturgerson will watch you; I have had more than enough to turn my stomach this evening." He left and the other men went with him, the door closing with a hollow bang behind them. Only Sturgerson remained.
“I cannot tell what you are thinking. It is most odd.”
"I get bored," he said simply. "Though there are days when morphine is more appropriate."
"William!" Holmes gasped as his eyes snapped open, his whole body jerking in response to the command.
"Holmes!" Watson said, wrapping his arm around Holmes' chest to hold him back. "Settle, man, please.” He turned towards the door. “We should go."
Holmes woke in muzzy-headed confusion, and a bleary glance at his pocket watch set the time at nearly noon. He ran a hand over his face and pulled open the door to reveal Mycroft holding a silver tray laden with tea, bread and sausages.
"I would be delighted." Watson smiled, childishly pleased to discover Holmes had been thinking about him.
Watson’s slow heart quickened a beat and he immediately thought,
Holmes stiffened, feeling like a steel glove wrapping around his heart and he thought he would very much like to hit the man. "I do not believe there is much left for us to discuss." He turned purposefully away, and his hands did not clench at his sides because he was a remarkably gifted actor.
Mycroft remained unmoved. “No vampire has any love for its own kind outside its clan, and precious little within it. They kill each other nearly as often as they kill mortals and it is the only reason the Earth is not overrun with them. Those who live to an advanced age do so through cunning, brute force, and the size of their clans. Even within clans themselves, there is constant competition for status and favor. Whose clan does this “doctor” belong to?”
"He asked me to-" Watson started, but Mycroft waved him into silence.
"And it did not occur to your thick head that he was controlling your mind even then, to convince you to consent to such a dangerous thing?"
The man was on his knees, chained to the wall like a dog with iron rings clasped around his neck and wrists. He was alive but in a bad way, breathing labored and uneven. The commotion roused him slightly and he turned his head, blinking up at Holmes with pain-fogged eyes.
“How do you
“You will. You must.”
"Not particularly."
Thrall was, according to all sources, one of the most insidious weapons a vampire could wield. Not all vampires were skilled at it, but the older they became the more likely they were to have mastered the art, as it was a foregone conclusion that any vampire who intended to live long would have at least a few thralls under its command.
“We have been aware of their increased activity around London for several weeks. A galère -- a large gathering of vampires -- is congregating outside the city; open war seems imminent.” He fixed his eyes firmly upon Watson, “It seems very convenient, then, that my own brother would happen to become entralled at such a time,” he glanced back at Holmes, “and to such an intense degree.”
smiling, his whole body strung taut as piano wire.
It was nearly ten by the time he reached the Diogenes, and Holmes ambushed him almost as soon as he stepped through the door, his arms suddenly full of the detective and the scent of him nearly drove Watson to distraction. Holmes smelled sweeter than ambrosia and thank God he had fed, or he would not be able to master himself.
"I can find out about Langley's past as well, if you need me to," he volunteered again, wanting to do right by the detective, to make amends for having ever involved him in the first place.
"You know, I wish I could remember," he said with a mirthless laugh, shaking his head. "I think I was delirious at the time. I suppose she must have asked if I wished to live. I most certainly said yes."
"Mmmm," Holmes said, and the next moment had his ear pressed to the doctor’s chest, listening for the beat of his heart. He thought he would like to bring Jackson upstairs, where he was better equipped to examine him...
Perhaps other men would flee from such knowledge. But Holmes had never been like other men.
“As I said, London is shadowed by evil. The plan put into place by this mysterious sire proves both their cunning and patience; it is not an adversary I wish to face alone. But you were the only man I could turn to who might not have thought me completely mad."
Holmes caught his wandering hand and brought it to his lips, "Go," he said, "I will see you tonight."
"Lestrade..." Holmes mumbled, wrenching his eyelids open and it felt like tearing the dressing off a fresh wound.
Jackson shrugged a bit helplessly. "There are things even we do not know about ourselves. As a doctor myself, I have studied my own physiology. Without an autopsy, I can only presume that my digestive system has changed dramatically from its original form in order to process the blood I consume. It is apparently highly efficient, as no waste products are formed."
Fortunately, Watson had at least included the address of the billiards hall which was the focus of his fruitless inquiry, and thus spared Holmes the trouble of tracking it down.
"He was moved there after his death, of course." Holmes looked the body over, searching. There wasn’t a gun to be found but he wore an ammunition belt at his waist. Holmes opened one of the pouches and emptied it, rolling the small, shiny bullets about in his palm.
"It was overwhelming almost immediately," Watson confessed, shaking his head incredulously. "And my mind is stronger than it was when I was mortal. I cannot fathom living with such a maelstrom."
Holmes shook his head, disbelief garroting his thoughts and stealing the air from his lungs. “But-” but surely, he would have known. There would have been signs, clues. All men had secrets, and all men had tells. “-it cannot...I would have known he kept a secret from me at least...”
Knowledge was his weapon of choice, and he knew better than to meet an adversary empty handed. He needed facts, and he did not entirely trust Doctor Watson to provide them.
Watson blinked. Holmes certainly seemed to think he had explained himself, but Watson couldn't decipher the answer. "And that... means what?" he prompted.
Fortunately, Watson was more than amenable to such a pastime, and they soon found themselves pressed together against the far wall.
"Protecting you did not mean an innocent man had to die."
“Are you reading my thoughts?”
trigger warnings: none
"I do hope this is your handiwork, Doctor," he muttered to himself. The trouble was, of course, that he could not implement the next part of his investigation until he knew for certain. And he would not know until evening.
trigger warnings: none
"Oh- yes. His practice is very soothing, very professional. I could hardly believe what my husband said he saw."
“To think he could conceal so much...I wonder why he didn’t kill
For a long time Watson made no reply, staring at the body between them as though it were a divination pool that he might unravel the secrets of if only he gazed into it long enough. Finally he looked up.
His tone was as reasonable as any good-hearted man. “Then share with me what you do know. What was the ritual he was attempting to preform when he died?”
"To warn you, but it seems you may know more of the business than myself. I commend you brother; I never even suspected. How long have you known of the existence of vampires? For myself, it has been a little over a month."
Holmes nodded and then proceeded to ignore him in favor of his laboratory and a pile of notes he'd scribbled in three different languages apparently at random. Watson found himself with no great desire to leave, and passed the night entertaining himself with Holmes’ large library of books. It was well past 3 in the morning when he looked back up.
Holmes paused in the hallway, took a breath. “Because fire is one of the very few things that can kill a vampire, and Doctor Jackson must die. An empty warehouse would be too suspicious.”
It was late afternoon by the time Montressor returned, furtive look on his broad features as he stepped quickly out of a brougham cab and threw himself inside the shop, door banging shut behind him. A moment later he was pushing the young girl out the door, a look of surprise on her face as the sign in the window flipped from open to closed.
"I concur. The longer Mycroft is left waiting the more anxious he will become. I am sorry for this; I did not know of his true profession."
“You know him quite well though, don’t you?”
It was another small to-do to get him out of the carriage and up the steps to his rooms. Watson might or might not be home; it was certainly late enough for him to be up. Not that Holmes was unduly worried; the doctor could look out for himself. And indeed, Watson did not
Holmes glanced at Watson, the struggle plain upon his face. Mycroft had been goading him all night, looking for a weakness, though Holmes could have told him easily enough where to find it. Having been needled through the whole interrogation and now being in danger of losing access to Holmes himself, well. He was dangerously close to losing his composure.
defy you if I wished. I knew, Watson, I
Father Deighton listened patiently, face pensive and after Holmes fell silent offered him a benevolent smile. “You poor man,” he said gently, holding out his hand and bringing Holmes to his feet. “This is not so unexpected. It makes sense you would fall to vice now that things are looking up for you. It is so easy to forget the cold of sleeping on the street. Perhaps you thought to yourself that you deserved a reward for finally getting back on your feet. Does that sound right?"
Holmes had been carefully studying the faces in the room. Most of them were tense, glowering and suspicious. Watson was their mortal enemy, and it their moral duty to dispatch him. Only Sturgerson seemed to be listening with genuine interest.
“Promise...promise you will never enter my mind without permission. Promise you will not- that you will never use your abilities to shape my reality, nor close my eyes to the truth simply because you think it best for me.”
"I am sorry I am not Stamford," Watson said quietly. "And that I have caused you so much trouble; more than you deserve. Please, let me do what little I can for you."
Holmes considered that. "What of your own mental abilities? Were another of the sire's thralls to be found, could you likewise read their mind, and pinpoint his location?"
Holmes lifted his brow. “Indeed? And did you share this speculation with the police?”
“I don’t remember,” he said dismissively, because the truth was that he’d tended to avoid spending much time in his bed since Stamford died. He would sleep on the settee, or in the chair, or on the floor by the fireplace. But not the bed. Too many memories lingered there.
Watson inhaled, something akin to a chill running down his spine as he acknowledged the truth of Holmes’ words. It now seemed the height of coincidence that Stamford would just
"A moment, brother," Holmes answered, and tipped his head to Watson's shoulder. "I am going to miss you terribly," he mumbled.
“You should go see about the wards,” he said after a long moment, and Sturgerson was only too happy to make himself scarce. Mycroft Holmes had a dispassionate nature that even in the depths of fury caused his temper to run to icy exactness and his anger, when roused, was as finely honed as a tanner’s blade. No one who was not the principal offender had anything to fear from that cold and implacable anger and yet, even so, people were quick to move out of his path whenever it surfaced.
“Very well,” said Holmes, “Though I question the integrity of the experiment." But after a moment the library shifted again, and this time it did not stop, whirling about like a dervish and Watson smiled appreciatively.
“This wasn’t me, Holmes, nor any of my kind. On that I swear.”
"I think-" Holmes stood slowly, hanging onto the arm of the chair. "-not." His knees buckled and he sagged.
"Help me stop them, before they kill more innocent men in their efforts to expose me. I know who is after me, yes, but if I wish to stay in London the only recourse I have is to rain death down upon them. Despite what you may think of me, I do not believe that is the best solution."
Holmes blinked up at him a moment, then shook his head. “No, no, not the crest. I searched the books of heraldry...it was not there. No, what I have to say involves our dear friend Stamford.”
It could not be denied...
“I can still be sorry you are hurt,” Watson said gently, and Holmes flinched at the last word.
"Not at all," Watson confirmed, "though he knew it, somehow. I could
"Yes, it's possible," Watson said, “Though I have never done so myself. It is a process called ‘thralling’, and requires a mortal to drink the blood of a vampire. If given enough, the blood dominates a human’s thoughts, and he becomes the vampire’s tool in all things.”
Lestrade smiled sadly, backing down. "Very well. I suppose I can leave a constable to watch over her until she comes around." He stepped outside the flat to fetch one of his officers and Holmes left before the lies could get any heaver, turning his collar to the wind and his back to Dossett Street in something very nearly like retreat. It was a bad business all around and nothing settled to his satisfaction, but it was done. He paid a cabbie to drop him off at the corner of Baker Street and Marylebone and walked the short, unhappy distance home.
“Is there a reason you won’t share them?”
But Holmes did not answer him directly. “Bring me the vicar's journal, there's a fellow."
"Very well,
“It was not.”
“You should have deduced as much yourself,” Holmes countered, and Watson was forced to admit the truth of it. He, who had boasted of killing every vampire he met in the city, and hadn’t realized one was living right under his nose. He could think of no good response, but thankfully Holmes saved him the trouble.
Apologies for the delay. New job has borked the writing schedule for one half of the editing team and the other is busy moving to a new place solo.
Of course, Holmes came prepared for this. "I come here ta London lookin' fer work," he answered in a rough, smash-mouthed northern accent. "But thar's no work ta be had."
There was something more than the usual reticence in Mycroft's face. “Be
Watson kept his eyes closed, kept the shield of his Will between him and the nurse, maintaining the shroud around her mind. He was not terribly skilled in the art of such mental influence, having had no teacher and no particular talent for it anyway. Besides, he didn’t like using such mental manipulations beyond the necessary fugue created while feeding.
Father Deighton nodded, “Then all has been made right.” He turned back to Holmes. “If you would keep from sinning again, repent. God is merciful, and bestows forgiveness upon those who truly desire it. Pray daily for strength and he shall grant you perseverance."
"You've still got plenty of time to leave without being noticed, and you desperately needed rest," Watson replied, looking over at him and seeing only the rumpled lines of his back. "Here is your jacket," he added, standing up and bringing it over. "You should... probably also button up your shirt before you go."
Holmes harrumphed at him, quarrelsome twist to his mouth. "Hardly. Otherwise you would not have been chosen. I wager there were a few older than yourself that you handily dispatched; you would not have gotten such a formidable reputation otherwise." Holmes' pinned him down with a glance, "And it is obvious you have one."
For some reason, the doctor still felt like talking. "But it isn't
sleep during the night, shook him gently awake.
And yet, he could not shake the small but persistent voice in the back of his mind that told him something was terribly wrong.
"Please," he entreated, and the constable nodded again, hopping to his feet and hurrying away. Holmes sighed, sat back and enjoyed the feeling of not being in
Holmes shook himself as if waking from a dream and fixed Watson with a pleasantly false smile. "Nothing of importance to the moment." He reached to his pocket for a pipe that wasn't there and made a face, allowing his hand to fall to his lap again. "Now then," he began, "We must to the business at hand. You are in danger here. Montressor wants you dead; at the very least, he wants you found out and he has already killed a man to be rid of you. I may have convinced him you are only human, I do not know, but no one will convince him you are not a threat. It is only a matter of time - possibly a very short time - before he grows impatient with the Yard's lack of progress and points them in your direction. Even if all they wish to do is interview you...you know what will happen."
Holmes smiled, well ahead of the doctor. "I have already taken such into consideration, It will not be difficult to fake a convalescence."
“So that is why you deigned to visit me in the hospital yourself,” Holmes mused. “And yet, you trusted me then. Ah- of course. The carriage; much like this room, you had it warded against thralls. Very clever.”
“Of course, sir. Thank you, sir,” the officer said distractedly, setting off down the hall in a daze. Watson smirked quietly to himself as the constable disappeared around the corner, then slipped into the room.
Of course, were he perfectly honest with himself, perhaps he simply didn’t like the fact that Watson knew more than he did, and liked even less that Watson knew that, too.
“His death was unfortunate, yes. A weak heart, perhaps. But without our intervention he was already bound for hell. Better to have tried and failed.”
The man’s features were twisted in horror, frozen in eternal shock and between the teeth of his gaping mouth something protruded. Holmes removed it, unsurprised to find a crucifix of fine silver, encrusted with a single small jewel and fastened round the man’s neck by a delicate chain.
Her eyes took on a conspiratorial quality and she looked quickly around before leaning in, a hand cupped to the side of her mouth. "Ever since the old shop hand
But Mycroft would not be routed so easily; he was long used to Holmes' particular brand of artifice. "And what of the rest of you? Your mind is your worst enemy."
“Not since Langley,” Watson admitted, throwing himself into a chair, and Holmes’ face hardened in judgement.
Watson rubbed at the smooth skin of his brow in contemplation. "Not easily, though it depends a great deal on the strength of the master; a weak vampire makes for weak thralls. But even for the very young among us, thralling a mortal confers to them certain benefits; chief among them is an ability to withstand mental domination or attack. It is difficult to read their minds, and nearly impossible to give one an Order unless there is a very great disparity of strength between the two vampires."
"What is it?" Watson asked, thinking Holmes must have just had a revelation of some sort, those great flowing rivers of thought connecting together in some obscure way. "What are you thinking?"
She pulled away from him, gaze fleeing from his like a startled hind. "The day James found out the doctor's secret, of course. He wouldn't allow me to return." A slow flush creeped up her neck, throat ducking.
The realization of the enormity of his error sat full upon Watson’s shoulders and he felt like Atlas, struggling beneath its weight.  Good god, what had he done? His own perilous situation aside, Holmes was now neck deep in this business and currently unable to defend himself should danger come calling. And danger, it seemed, was forever calling on Sherlock Holmes.
Holmes blinked several times, found his voice and said, “Agreed.” Then he fit himself against Watson’s back, warm arms locked around his neck. "I wish you would order me to tell you not to go," he mumbled into Watson’s shoulder.
“That depends on why you’re asking, friend.” Holmes studied the man, grey eyes like indurated clay and the subcutaneous shape to the breast pocket of his waistcoat that bespoke of a hidden firearm. He carried himself with the causal confidence of a man not unused to violent encounters.
Her lips pressed together in a way that coupled with the pins made Holmes think rather uncharitably of a frog. "Well, is that going to help the rent get paid? Are
An hour passed, and Holmes knew it had been an hour, though it felt as if only minutes had gone by. Then Sturgerson coughed discreetly behind them, and offered an apologetic smile. "I have to send for Mycroft now," he explained, though it was nowhere close to dawn.
Sorry for the delay. One half of the editing team was dealing with a sick kid this week.
A wry smile tugged at the corner of Watson's mouth. "To my understanding, vampires prefer to attack each other in number. But I fear I am not so great an adversary as they believe. Against a vampire older than myself I doubt I stand much of a chance at all."
"I am ready," Holmes said, which was all well and good because Watson certainly wasn’t. But keeping Holmes alive was important, and surely any invading vampire
“How so?”
One of the editors has been busy with surviving summer school break in the southern hemisphere and the other getting their PHD in rock collecting, but school is officially back in session and so are we!
"No, they are not," Watson agreed. "Do you have anything you can take for your relief? I might have something in my bag-"
He shrugged. “It depends on the person; some minds are more easily persuaded than others.”
"Tell me about the thrall you have put my brother under; explain to me why I shouldn’t let you burn in the sun for it."
He’d half turned to the door when Holmes’ hand snaked out, winding itself around his coat sleeve.
"And who is this troublesome rogue?"
“Mycroft does have that effect on people,” Holmes agreed lazily.
“A test to detect human blood?” Watson said with genuine interest. “That is quite remarkable.”
"If there is an emergency, I doubt there will be time for letter writing. Learn all you can," Holmes reminded him, then he was gone.
"It is a form of mental domination," Watson warned, still trying to talk him out of it, "you may not like how it feels..."
he thought sluggishly, and his thoughts stopped there.
"They died too easily," he said shortly, and Holmes was obliged to hide his smirk behind his cup.
“You sound uncommonly like you are making excuses.”
again, uttered with such conviction that all Watson's protests seemed mean and petty and hollow; he couldn't begin to compete. Holmes commanded the English language with such precision as to make the most preposterous of ideas seem reasonable. Besides, Watson could not stop him now if he tried, not without thralling him first and was something he would not do.
"To see how far gone you are,” he replied, emptying his glass in one swallow and immediately filling it again.
"Wonder and horror in equal measure," Holmes agreed philosophically. "We are nothing if not consistent in our plurality."
"You need more light; you’ll be blind before you see forty."
He wanted Watson to do terrible things to him.
“Could it be a ruse?” Watson asked, though he did not sound hopeful and Holmes reached out, laying a comforting hand on the side of his arm.
"Tea? Good lord man, you're a doctor; surely you've a stronger medicinal drink to offer than that. And the answer is no, though the church I shall investigate in the morning."
Holmes gave a careless shrug that made the corners of Watson's mouth crimp together in irritation. “They are also still mortal. I imagine a bullet will be effective enough of a deterrent.”
“Can you usually tell what people are thinking?” he asked, but it was a foolish question and he knew it. Watson had been given to understand that for all his awkwardness at forming emotional connections, Holmes was a keen observer of human nature, and a shrewd judge of character.
"If he is a monster, he is a human one. It has been a month; has your wife expressed any interest in returning, or tried to sneak away?"
tfw you're doing editing and realize you forgot to mention Holmes nicking the pack of matches from Montressor's shop so you have to go back and add the line in because it's a small but important detail.
Things had happened much the same way with Stamford. Watson was not unaware of the pattern, the repetition of history playing out like a familiar tune but seemed wholly unable to deviate from the course laid at his feet. Holmes was already here, and Watson already invested.
"Just at dawn," Lestrade called back. He pulled out a battered notebook, flipping through the pages with one thick finger. "By one of the curates. They noticed something dark on the roof in the wee hours of the morning. Couldn't make it out in the fog, and by the time it’d burned off enough to tell what she was lookin’ at half the street had noticed too. Been quite a spectacle; we're having a damn hard time keeping people away."
"Ah- a week or so ago...bit more, maybe."
"Yes!" the man shrieked. "His mouth was on her
"Sir??" he said, glancing anxiously around the street.
"No!" Watson says, shocked. "No Holmes, you can't-" He swallowed hard, looking back to Mycroft. "Please. Let Holmes make his own choice, whether you trust it or not."
Holmes smiled soporifically, dreamy-eyed and lazy. "She worries too much. More now than she used to. We pretend not to notice."
“He was not-” Holmes began obstinately, but this time the club struck his shoulder and he felt something give. He stopped talking.
Holmes sighed. "Why do you ask such questions if you refuse to believe the answers I give?"
Watson stood and held out his hand in silent invitation, and Holmes found himself taking it without protest. Watson drew him forward to the bedroom and pressed him upon the mattress with a hand on his chest until he was laying supine against the pillows. He considered the ease with which Watson managed him, but the thrall prevented him from considering it too deeply. If Watson wished to take him to bed, Holmes had no complaints. How could he?
"The gentleman's name wouldn't happen to be Langley, would it?" he asked causally, and the girl nodded enthusiastically.
“Did Stamford share your belief?” Watson asked eagerly, but Sturgerson only shrugged again.
But Holmes
“What makes you so certain?”
Doctor," Holmes replied in that damnably cutting way of his. "Can you do it or not?"
"Many men have come to find work," the reverend agreed amicably, "Perhaps the church can help you in your endeavors. What skills do you have, Mr...?"
next move is to stay here where it is safe. Vampires are the purview of the Diogenes. I shall deal with this.”
Lestrade nodded. "What in God’s name has been going on in that church, Holmes?  I’ve got dead bodies, murdered priests, escaped maniacs- half the city’s in a panic and my superiors want answers."
"A terrible tale," Father Newman replied hollowly, "The sin of drink often lends itself to other sins, as you have discovered, but such transgressions can be washed away through the love of Christ.”
Holmes took a fortifying breath, labeled those particular memories as irrelevant and shunted them aside; now was not the time. He stepped over to the bed and raised the lamp, examining Watson’s features under the soft yellow glow.
In Watson's experience, nearly everyone enjoyed the act of feeding in the moment; that was simply the nature of the thing. But afterwards most of them were horrified at how easily they'd fallen under the sway of an Order. Terrified that next time, they wouldn't walk away. Holmes hadn’t been afraid. He had- he had
Watson fetched the paper, put it within easy reach and then admitted the truth, because it wouldn't mean anything to do so after Holmes was thralled. "It will pain me not to be around you."
Holmes shot him a fond look. “You forget that until very recently, Moriarty had no idea who you were, nor how powerful you might be. Even now there is no reason to assume he knows your true age. Given the relative ease with which you have held London, he likely assumes you to be far older than you are.   In any case, he has not lived so long by being rash, nor relying on his strength alone to save him. He is a predator, but not the kind that wastes its energy in the hunt. He is rather the spider sitting in the center of an intricate web, and he means to ensnare all of London within it.”
"And what did he say?" Holmes prompted, but Montressor's mouth closed like a steel trap.
Watson leaned over and took Holmes' cup, refilling it as he spoke. “Very, very little I am afraid. As I said, the one who created me told me nothing - not even her name. Why do you ask?”
"Of course," Watson said. "And you think he will reveal things to you as yourself, instead of the homeless man you impersonated?"
"There," Holmes pointed at Montressor's house while handing the cabbie another silver piece. "His name is James Montressor; he arrived home less than ten minutes ago and depending on how well his faculties are working he may even now be packing to flee."
"A few; I will see what can be arranged."
“It details the most likely reason why you are now immune to suggestion,” Mycroft replied, glancing at the letter with a disdainful air as he poured himself another drink. He then sat, lit a cigar and glowered at the fire in deep contemplation.
"But ye ain't bought nothin' yet," she protested.
“What?” he said stupidly, blinking like an idiot. How was it Holmes had the ability to muddle him so easily, even broken as he was?
, "If you won’t share your theories about motive, do you care to share the plan regarding said interception?"
But had taken him some time – and a brief detour through the city’s lesser areas – to find a suitably corrupt soul to provide him with sustenance. (He didn’t kill when he fed regardless, but without his practice he was relegated to surviving on the blood of the unwary, and it sat better with him that the donor be a person of dubious morality.)
city as well. Taken at your word, it is possibly one of the last truly free cities of man; certainly the most powerful. I will not let it fall into the hands of a conclave of parasitic blood drinkers without a fight."
He drank more. His mind was no longer his own, not really, Watson’s thoughts and desires now superimposed over his, not erasing them but melding the two together, fusing until he was uncertain where his own will ended and Watson’s began. He didn’t much mind. Watson would steer him right, and he found himself wanting to please the doctor, to listen to him and be guided by him in all things. He knew such thoughts were contrary to his own personality and understood them to be borne of the blood ritual he was partaking in, but he did not care.
It seemed unlikely.
If Nock had a skill, it was that he had learned how to be silent. How to creep up on an unsuspecting man (or woman) and not be heard until it was much too late. It was a skill that had both saved his own life and ended others, and he had gotten so good at it that it had earned him a small reputation among the other criminals in the dilapidated corner of London he called home. ("The only 'nock you'll never hear", is how the joke went.)
For his part Holmes turned over as much information about Watson as he dared. The culprit, he assured Lestrade with unimpeachable conviction, was a blond man of indeterminate age and uncommon strength, with a military background and a profound dislike of the church who nonetheless had likely been acting out of self-defense. No false words passed Holmes’ lips. His lies were those of omission, staggering in their scope.
“Stamford?” he said at last, once Holmes had finished. “You say he claimed to be a friend of Stamford’s? Impossible. The boy had more sense than that.”
Holmes ignored the first comment. One did not present themselves as a supernatural being to a man of science, challenge them on the point and expect anything less than a thorough examination. "And your bowls do not empty? Then where does the blood go?"
Holmes gave him a tilted look, head cocked at an angle. “Why would I not be?”
"I do not think so, no. She is under a great strain; I would keep her as much apart from the thing as can be managed. Her husband’s crime is not hers to answer for.”
Th priest was unmoved, hand and gun still steady. “None; I am a man of my word. I offer them work and shelter, and a chance to save themselves from sin. I provide all of these things, in due time.”
"He confronted me," Watson replied, and Holmes arched his brow questioningly.
"You might start by telling me your real name," Holmes said flatly.
“Do you think we should tell them?” He asked, holding the papers up. Mycroft glanced at them and his mouth formed a craggy frown that cut across his face like a chasm, dark thunderheads forming on the horizon.

Holmes flicked the comment aside with his fingers. "I am certain Lestrade would say he pays in a multitude of other ways."
Holmes could hear Mrs. Hudson shuffling about downstairs preparing breakfast. Watson's voice echoed in his ears,
Holmes acquiesced with a shrug, and Mycroft continued as if he had never spoken. “The rest of the public parts of the club are open to you, and Carruthers or myself can escort you to our libraries and vaults." He paused. "You've made the right decision. You will be safe here. The thrall should begin to fade after the first seven days, and you will begin to feel better."
“So I have,” Mycroft said from the door, maneuvering his considerable bulk into the room. He cast a coolly appraising glance at his brother as he walked over, checked his pulse in time to his pocket watch, then passed a hand over Holmes’ face, closing his eyes. Watson felt an unquiet chill creep down his back, the motion too reminiscent of tending to the dead for his liking.
The doctor came in halfway through the day, right as Holmes was being served whatever passed for luncheon at Saint Thomas'.
Through the accumulation of days he became a figure of both curiosity and derision at the library, patrons stealing glances from the corner of their eye, others openly staring as he poured over texts from around the world written in half a dozen languages. Fortunately Holmes had never found the pursuit of knowledge to be an embarrassment, however unseemly, impolitic or outright dangerous it might be and thus was wholly unconcerned with other’s opinions on the matter.
"As you say, the cases are related," Watson noted as they reached the parlor. "I can make tea if you like. On the subject at hand: have you any more of a clue who killed Mr. Kramer? Was it Father Newman himself, or a member of the congregation, like Langley?"
"Here are your quarters,” he said. “There is a loo and bathing room between your suite and the one adjacent, but as you are the only guest, it is yours alone. There is no maid. The kitchen is two floors down; you are free to feed yourself whenever you wish, as there is also no cook. There are no less than six men in the Diogenes at all hours; we do not leave the building empty. If you require anything, the bell pull will summon one of them.” He paused, “I have told them to approach you armed, and in pairs.”
Holmes made a sound something between a laugh and a groan. "Too many questions that account neither for my current state nor the pile of ash. I will...survive the night, I assume?"
He did.
Mycroft gave him a disapproving look. “Your preoccupation with the doctor has slowed your mind, brother. The answer is obvious.”
The only good bit of news was that Montressor's wife was still at home, which meant the man was bound to return at some point. He might leave all else behind, but he would not leave her. In other circumstances --ones that didn't involve murder -- Montressor's love and devotion to his wife would be admirable.

Unfortunately, his Will was Holmes’ now, and though he could not read Watson’s mind, he could sense his feelings through the blood that ran in his veins and he responded to it as any thrall might. It didn’t matter that Watson hadn’t said anything, had given no verbal command. Holmes could feel his desire and that was enough.
The hat shop was busy and the proprietor professionally unhelpful, courteous to a fault and showing all due sympathy for his deceased patron but unwilling to release any information until Holmes returned with either a warrant or a constable. Holmes then invited the man to consider a third option in the form of a handful of coins and he left again with the name Michael Kramer and the gentleman's home address scrawled along the bottom of a pay receipt.
"No, I think we've enough to take it from here," he said almost gently, and the courtesy chaffed against his skin like sandpaper. He hated being so pitiable a figure; especially in front of someone like Lestrade.
James tried to protest, but his wife once again nudged him gently forward. They headed down the street, stopped to speak for a moment, and then returned.
