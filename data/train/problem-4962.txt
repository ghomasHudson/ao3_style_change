“What?”
“Oh come on, we’re just getting to know each other. My boyfriend is my True Mate.”
"Sounds like a deal, Becks."
“Oh, come on stop being a baby. Here.”
"Okay, then it is settled. We should work on the paper and meet up on Friday to clear up some stuff."
“We’ll adopt or if you don’t want that, it’s fine. We’ll do other stuff.” The alpha placed chaste kisses on Dean’s face.
, Dean. I need this for extra credit.”
brother.” He had to do this because there was no one else.
Dean kissed Cas and moved to straddle him. He took off his shirt and resumed kissing Cas, hands cruising underneath Cas’ borrowed shirt. Cas shimmied his boxers off, his erection slapping back on his stomach, and then got to work on Dean’s. The hunter parted from the Angel so they could get undressed. Completely naked they interlocked again. They moaned when their dicks touched and Dean thought he would come just from hearing Cas make those sounds. He was holding Dean by the scruff of his neck as they kissed. Cas was the first to begin thrusting against the hunter’s body. Soon they found a rhythm and they kept at it. Dean felt he was close and curled his hand around both their dicks and started pumping. Cas made an otherworldly sound and started grinding faster against Dean’s hand. They came at the same time, starring in each other’s eyes. Dean collapsed on Cas, content.
“Sammy and I are on a hunt. Vamps. Weird masked vamps up in Compton. I don’t get why they’d wear masks, it’s stupid, they kill with their teeth. Anyway, it’s a job Dad couldn’t finish” he heard himself say.
“Why not?”
“What are you going, alpha?”
Dean stumbled in the bathroom. He grinned wide when he saw himself in the mirror. His neck was covered in big bruises that were quickly turning purple. His chest was vibrating. Shrugging off the jacket he got closer to the shower. He discarded the rest of his clothes, throwing the come-stained slacks in the sink to wash off some of the come and scent, and decided he would simply throw away the ruined boxers and go commando in his jeans. He scrubbed himself quickly in the shower and got dressed. He washed off the come from the borrowed pants in the sink with cold water before leaving the pair folded on the hamper lid. Back in the cave he found an old Chinese take-out bag and hid his boxers inside so the smell wouldn't permeate. He then shoved the entire thing in one of the pockets of his jacket.
Dean was fumbling, getting dressed “We aren’t going to tell Claire about uhm… us. Okay?”
, Deanna told him.
She turns, and Cas’s leaning against the other side of the Impala.
Deanna snorts. “Say it like it is, Sam. We started the apocalypse, and we died for it.”
Ada holds up the rings, yelling something. The world begins to swirl – Gabriel’s last bit of chaos. Michael-Deanna’s thoughts coalesce once more into harmony. They throw Castiel into a tree with a brush of their wings which will burn, and then break something in Ada Winchester’s ribcage that leaves her coughing up blood.
“Girl? Or righteous?”
“What,” Crowley spreads his hands. “You gave up the position!”
Cas turns. “Would you shut up for
“When are you not,” Sammy says, but it doesn’t really sound like a joke.
Deanna traced it, the hairlessness of it.
? Cas actually giggles.
“So tell me!”
“Oh, great,” Ruby replies.
Crowley glances up, and catches sight of the hanged man. “You think that’s a monster.”
After Sammy left, though, and John hadn’t cared at all –
Deanna’s starting to think there is no God, and then Zachariah gets to them all.
She cuts the weapons out of him. Slices along the grace-stitches, tears open the body he wears. It’s not the first time she’s done this, she doesn’t think. She can’t think.
“I don’t
Cas will have sad, sad, eyes.
“I bet there’s more monsters, too,” Deanna says.
Ada works the dye through the ends of Deanna’s hair. It’s unexpectedly gentle. “Your head is disgusting,” she says. “Bobby called.”
shit! Contrary to popular belief, I don’t know what’s going on
“I’m serious,” Deanna tells her. “You’d be better off if you just left us.”
. I’m on your side, Deanna. You know that.”
“Haniel means…joy, right?”
Sammy twitches as they hit a bump. Haniel turns to her. “Is she alright?”
someone, somewhere prays,
“But you don’t want to be just another pawn.” Balthazar laughs, back to being an angel playing with the body of a man in a v-neck and tight jeans. “As if you aren’t already.”
“You were the first seal, Deanna,” Alistair tells her, the drawl dripping through his words. “This apocalypse is all yours, honey.”
“Basically,” Ada says, “if the demon blood was like, weed or something, and when she got stoned her powers increased – ”
“Sure.”
“That’s not what I was asking.” Something flickers over Victoria’s face. “Let’s just find this asshole.”
So maybe they’re both walking on eggshells around her. So maybe Deanna’s also oscillating wildly between guilt and
Sammy glares. “This isn’t
They’re not the only one to say this. They’re not the only one to tell her this. She can never, ever, escape it.)
Sammy leans forward. She looks more animated than she has recently. Deanna got her to eat a whole sandwich earlier, too. “So before we broke the last seal – ”
Deanna takes a deep breath and pulls Sammy’s arm around her shoulder in one quick motion. The splitting pain in her head gets worse, threatening to overwhelm her. “C’mon, you big lug.”
Zachariah flicks his hand, and several other angels march into the alley, bodies stiff and warlike. They grab Deanna, and she yanks her arm away but does not, exactly, resist. “What are you going to do, Castiel?” Zachariah asks. “You’ve almost fallen, haven’t you?”
“Mom’s – mom,” Sammy says, her voice so very small. Deanna’s mad at her, so mad, but her limbs don’t even hesitate, carrying her over towards her sister. When she hugs her, they can both feel the sting. Sammy groans in pain, something burning, and the brand – Castiel’s handprint – on Deanna’s shoulder flares. Deanna just pulls Sammy tighter.
, Bobby said to her once.
“I think I’ve got x-ray vision,” Deanna offers. “Or I might just be losing my mind.”
(The Winchester sisters have been self-destructive since they were born. That was how it went, being raised in a household where you should’ve been a boy. Where your face just reminded your father of his dead wife. Because that was always how it was –
Sammy shrugs.
“Shh,” Ada says, holding Sammy. “Shh.”
If she didn’t ask, phrased like it wasn’t even a question,
Sammy glances past her, eyes clearing momentarily. The touch seems to calm her, as much as it hurts Deanna, so she nods her head at Ada, who grabs the other arm.
She should have said it.)
Sammy would curl up in her bed some nights, curl up for warmth. There was hair all over her arms, all over her hands. It was what happened, when a body didn’t have enough fat to keep it warm. Deanna wrapped blankets around her and held her in her arms, hated how her brightness was dampened like this, hated how her ribs poked out. It shouldn’t be.
“Bobby’s with Ellen and Jo,” Ada says. “I wouldn’t ask.”
Deanna pleads with Sammy through her eyes –
Victoria checks her watch. “Since seven hours and forty three minutes ago.” She glances up and blinks. “Girl, what the hell happened to you?”
Deanna could notice later, probably, that John had just always fought with Sammy, never tried to understand her weird hyper-focus, never tried to compliment her bizarre style choices. Part of that was the fact that Sammy was antagonistic and smart, but their father picked half the fights too. Deanna could notice later that John had, for a long time, been looking at Sammy like she was something that eventually he’d have to kill. Maybe he wouldn’t even mind.
Gabriel, having gotten very close to Deanna without her even noticing, snorts. “Like calls to like.”
A rustle of wings, and the takeoff. Blue and black and gold. The shadows of the wood, the shadows which it hid. Deanna’s wings flared wide.
(Sammy had cried, one day, and said,
“Be here, Sam,” Deana says. “To remind me.”
“Why can’t you do it?” Deanna asks.
“Hey, hold on, the other one’s here, too,” the hunter says, putting a hand down on the table, like he’s finally figured out this is
It was never
truly is.”
im posting this instead of facing my responsibilities pls indulge me
Sam shook his head and pointed at the tea “It’s a tea for better sleep Cas, Rowena taught me, I think it has had an important effect on Dean. He didn’t put a single drop of alcohol on his lips. I am also getting very, very sleepy.” Sam’s eyes were droopy and he looked at the table like it was the softest bed in the universe. “You should take him to bed, I can manage.”
“I know, brother.”
“Hey, bitch leave the guy alone. He’s a multidimensional wavelength of celestial intent, he doesn’t get all these human stuff.”
At the law firm, Dean and Sam met up with Cas and Ellen in the lobby, the alpha reaching for Dean to kiss and scent mark him. Crowley welcomed them in his office for preparations before the hearing. The man had suits ready for Dean and Sam - they couldn’t appear in court in flannels - and this answered why he asked for their sizes. The lawyer explained that the best course of action was honesty and that they should admit Dean was after emancipation. He schooled them about court rules, things to say, things to avoid and so on. Dean put on his suit, the light grey colour complementing his blond hair and green eyes well. He struggled with the tie, trying to remember how to do the knot, thinking Dad would rip him a new one for not being able to. Cas came up to him and took the tie away from his hands.
“I remember you taught me about the intricacies of vampire’s nests. I will assist you on this mission”.
“I decide to be fine ‘till the end of the week” Dean whispered to himself as he sipped coffee. He faked a smile while Sammy kept rambling about the hunt, reading from the journal. Sam was all he had left. There was a time when that would have been enough but now? After everything that transpired in the last years, after what he heard in that room, that night…he found himself longing. He found himself incomplete. Sammy wasn’t enough this time.
Close enough. It’s luA-he not luu-he”
Dean chuckled and tried to fall asleep.
Dean licked his lips nervously, his laptop on his lap, his head supported by multiple pillows on the headrest. He was looking at the blinking cursor in the Google search box with such intensity that were he an angel the thing would have been smote. He drew a sharp, deep breath and started typing.
The jukebox in the corner starts playing a new song, and Dean straightens in his chair with a wild grin.
“Trauma,” Sam answers gently. “Trauma and the lack of ever having dealt with it.”
He’s not sure how long they sit there in the paralyzing stillness. He’s afraid to move. He’s afraid to think. He just wants to run and build all of his walls back up again, brick by brick, after they came down like a wrecking ball in Castiel’s arms.
Tears spill like rivers whose dams have been broken.
Then Cas lifts Dean chin and kisses him, smoldering and quiet, smothering the sob that claws its way out from Dean’s throat.
Dean shuts his eyes and leans back into the headrest, and he doesn’t realize how much tension he’s been holding in his body until he lets all of his weight sag against the seat.
Nothing.
He smells like Cas.
to stop it.”
Tears cascade down his face without a blink. There seems to be no shortage of them; they slide and slide and slide down his cheeks and he feels them drip down his chin onto his chest.
“Cas,” he begins, Adam’s apple bobbing up and down, “about what you said..before you left-”
“Jack,” he smiles. His boots hit the ground and Dean’s striding over to envelope him in a hug. Jack’s arms come to wrap around Dean’s back, and Dean squeezes his surrogate son tightly. It’s the first time he’s able to take a cleansing breath in weeks.
“I was standing in a ring of holy fire when it happened for the first time.”
Tears slip out from behind closed eyes, trailing down his cheeks. The cool air of the bunker chills the warm rivulets on his face.
He’d said he was sorry. Cas knows he is. Logically, at least. He’d be lying if he said doubt didn’t sometimes reside quietly in the corners of his mind, in the chambers of his heart.
“Liar,” she says, eyes soft and knowing. She presses her lips together into a thin smile and pats his cheek gently before rounding the island.
He detests vulnerable.
So Dean breathes slowly, in and out, as Cas continues to work at the stubborn muscles. When it starts to feel bruised, Cas reaches one hand to grasp Dean’s outstretched elbow, the other resting on Dean’s bare hip. Cas leans closer against Dean’s back until he’s flush against it.
Sometimes Dean will practice in his room, sometimes on the bunker’s roof.
“I’m fine, Dean,” he answers stiffly, as if his well-being is of no concern. “I wasn’t there that long before Jack summoned me.”
“Yes,” he says again for tenacity, and the gravity of its sincerity begins to lift the weight of the world off his shoulders. He falls back against his chair weightlessly and takes a quiet, cleansing breath.
And, yeah. Dean doesn’t blame him. He shoves his hands into his pockets and walks the distance until he’s at Cas’s side, and that’s when he notices.
Cas’s eyes meet Dean’s, shiny and watery as tears slip down his cheeks.
“It really is amazing how they’re able to combine so many different flavors in this,” he tries. Because he really is
The sunburst body gleams in the corner of his eye - the sun fittingly reflecting off one of the tuning keys.
Dean drops his hands from the steering column into his lap, palms up and fingers interlocked. He rests his chin against his chest.
The wind blows again, harder this time, and Dean watches as it sweeps Cas’s hair up over his forehead before it flops down again. Cas draws his zip-up closer.
He wraps it in the cloth before carrying it with both arms down the bunker’s halls.
He grips his jacket and buries his head into the green fabric, right where Castiel’s bloody handprint lays. The gentle breeze of dusk sweeps through his hair and rustles the branches high above in the towering trees, the dead leaves catching a ride in its wake.
He sniffs as he blinks back tears, dropping his hand next to his thigh.
The smell of the crisp autumn air cleanses him as it fills his lungs.
know it’s not because of you. It was nothin’ that you did. I just—”
Cas’s finger curls under his chin then, and he lifts Dean’s face to bore into his eyes. Dean licks his lips as Cas’s thumb strokes his jaw. It’s a tenderness that makes his heart ache.
He turns down the hall and makes a quick pit stop before bounding for the roof.
“Yes,” Cas whispers with a kiss to Dean’s temple, lips trailing lower to suckle his earlobe. “Yes.”
Cas goes rigid and tries to push back against the force of Dean’s embrace. “Dean, no. Your back—”
“Let me check you,” Cas says quietly, reaching to place his hands gently at Dean’s side and urging him to turn around.
“Hello, Dean.”
Cas’s white shirt is unbuttoned at the neck, and Dean’s mouth goes a little dry at the naked dip of his collar bone. His sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, and Dean marvels at the ripples of muscle and bone in the angel’s forearms, his fingers itching to touch.
He leans into Cas’s space then, and wraps his arms around his waist, leaning his forehead into Cas’s shoulder as Cas’s arms encircle his back.
When he pulls into the garage and cuts the engine, the silence is deafening, making his ears ring once again. He can hear his heart pounding in his ears, and it’s racing with such an intensity that he feels like it might break out of his chest.
“I guess there’s more than one for you though, huh?”
Something resembling concern darts across Jack’s face. “You don’t, though.” And his eyes take on that soulful, deep sadness Dean has seen too many times on the kid.
Castiel turns his head to the source of the noise, and when he meets Dean’s gaze, he thins his lips in a sort of pained smile before turning his back to look at the sky again.
Dean doesn’t even have it in himself to brush it off. So just rolls his eyes with a nod and drops his head into his hands. Silence settles between them, and Dean revels in it as he focuses on his breathing. He reaches to grab his bourbon and sips it.
One of the perks about living in the Middle of Nowhere, Kansas is the total lack of light pollution. The night sky is always clear and visible for miles on end. It’s one of Dean’s favorite parts about living here. When he opens the door to the roof, a cool gust of wind blows in his face, and he welcomes it with a contented smile and inhales deeply.
Crickets start to chirp in the distance. Some breed of owl hoots, and the lake ripples gently against the shore.
Dean lets out a puff of laughter. “‘Course it is.”
“Ah — sorry, I probably shouldn’t call you that anymore huh?”
Dean takes a cautious step forward, and reaches out to bunch his hand in the fabric of Castiel’s trench coat.
“‘n I missed you,” he murmurs against the warm swath of exposed skin on the angel’s neck before pressing a feather-light kiss there.
Cas’s eyes stare back into his, but they flicker back and forth between Dean and Jack. It’s a tic, Dean knows, that he does when he’s nervous.
“Goodnight.”
They lay flush together for a moment, skin to skin, until Cas starts grinding against Dean’s throbbing erection with his own. Dean smiles and pecks Cas’s lips before motioning him to move.
“Yes.” But it’s a little breathy, a small crack in Castiel’s chassis. He’s nervous too, Dean knows, and it makes Cas even more endearing than he already was.
, comes a mocking leer in Dean’s head. It’s his own voice.
They never stop dancing.
Cas blinks slowly, and Dean watches as tears roll down his cheeks. He’s silent for several minutes before speaking again.
Dean screws his eyes shut as he clenches his jaw, and Cas knows he wants to protest, wants to berate himself and scoff at the idea of self-compassion. So he lifts his chin to press his lips to Dean’s forehead, letting the kiss linger for only a moment.
,” Cas whispers into Dean’s ear. Something blooms in his chest at the sound of Cas’s native language on his tongue as he reaches for his face, plundering inside Cas’s mouth.
“In the drawer,” he mumbles softly. Dean’s hands settle on the swell of Cas’s hips, grazing circles over the bones with his thumbs as he watches Cas reach into Dean’s bedside drawer for the bottle. Cas bends down to kiss Dean soundly, tongue grazing the roof of his mouth before he parts. Dean’s heart jackhammers in his chest, and he sucks in a breath, letting it out slowly in attempt to calm his nerves. His breath hitches when he feels Cas’s hand slicking him up, but relaxes again when both hands come to caress his face.
“Yeah, a little.”
Dean starts to tremble slightly when he cups either side of Cas’s jaw again.
“I’m going to say hello to Sam and Eileen,” he says with an emotion Dean can’t place, and Cas already has the door open when Dean speaks, rough and avoidant.
Dean nearly melts when Cas immediately reciprocates and envelopes him. He dips his nose into the crook of Cas’s neck and he’s finally, finally, able to breathe.
“I’m so sorry,” Dean whispers against the shell of Cas’s ear, voice thick and gruff. The warm caress of Dean’s breath chases goosebumps across Cas’s skin. “God, I’m so sorry.”
As the song ends, Dean thinks maybe this could be his forever. Surrounded by family, both given and chosen; blissful in his angel’s arms. The love of his life. The one who has saved him more times than Dean can count. At utter peace knowing that Eileen will take good care of Sam, and he looks forward to the day when they can all be together once again.
Dean turns around to see Castiel standing a few yards away.
“He told me he loved me.”
Dean stops then, eyes downcast to the space between his boots. His eyes are wet, but not enough to spill. He flicks his gaze to the hand on Cas’s wrist, and he hadn’t even noticed that he’d been stroking it with his thumb until now.
Dean breaks from Cas’s mouth for air, gasping and panting as he turns to face him. Cas’s hands are around his back, and then he’s flipping Dean over onto the mattress beneath him.
“Thank you.” It’s a hoarse whisper, and Dean isn’t surprised at the watery gaze he sees when he lifts his chin.
He’s alone. And it feels safe, familiar, unthreatening. No longer vulnerable.
He kind of prefers it, if he’s honest. Everything inside of him is too heavy and intense. His mind is completely devoid of any coherent or rational thought, yet it feels like there’s a hamster running on its wheel. He feels completely broken apart, open and exposed and raw.
“Dean,” Cas begins, and his eyes are heavy in something soft and broken. “What I said before, that night —” and suddenly Castiel can’t meet Dean’s eyes anymore and he’s pulling away from Dean’s hold and Dean feels a pang of rejection in his gut as Cas steps out of his space completely.
He can’t get the question out coherently, but Cas knows what he’s asking. Of course he does.
,” and all coherent thought leaves Dean’s mind as Cas angles his hips, guiding Dean inside until they’re flush pelvic bone to pelvic bone.
Dean sits back in his chair, glass of wine in hand. They’re a bottle and a half in, celebrating Dean’s arrival, and his head is buzzing in the best possible way at the base of his skull.
“Is fine,” Dean bites out and forcefully yanks Cas into him. “
Cas dips his chin in a nod. “I know,” he whispers. “I’ve noticed.”
Cas nods, and feeling emboldened, reaches to flatten his palms against the planes of Dean’s chest.
The air breathes cleaner; the breeze is cool and languid.
They find Eileen in the kitchen by the fridge after Dean stops in his bedroom to brush his teeth and change into his loungewear. Her smile lights up the whole room when she sees him. Dean grins wide.
Dean goes all in, and when his tongue brushes and rolls against Castiel’s, he feels another tear escape from his closed eyes.
“Is this okay?”
He lifts his head to the harsh fluorescent lights of the garage, and blindly gropes along the wall before finding the switch, and all the lights turn off with a resounding click.
“I know that that’s all there is for you here. And that’s okay,” he smiles, waving a hand between them before letting it fall to his side. “I didn’t say it to hear it back, or for some alterior motive.” he explains gently. “I said it so that you would know. Because in speaking that truth—acknowledging that truth, even for just a moment — I finally found that happiness.” Cas‘s smile widens, eyes glassy, and Dean feels like he’s going to throw up because Cas looks just like he did before—
The silence is heavy, trepid between them for a few moments.
Dean can’t see the tear that falls from the corner of Castiel’s eye as he closes them.
Cas gently presses his fingers into the muscles of Dean’s shoulder under the neck of his shirt to examine them. His fingertips are fire on his bare skin.
Cas groans and throws his head back with a grimace as he lets Dean guide him to the dance floor. “‘Got-dead’ party? Seriously?”
Dean throws his head back to crack it against the wall: once, twice, but his own voice reverberates and taunts even louder around the sharp throb in his skull.
Cas blinks and squints, then visibly resigns.
— and lets all of his weight sink against Cas, who accepts it willingly. Dean’s lips press against his temple, and Cas hums appreciatively as Dean starts to sing low into Cas’s ear.
When he looks at Cas through his eyelashes, Dean has to stifle a moan at the sight. Castiel looks absolutely wrecked, neck arched back, black hair flat against the headrest, panting through parted lips.
“Of what?”
“Awesome,” and then he’s walking up the porch and has a palm on the door before he stills.
? — and so Cas is trying his hardest to brush it off.
Dean’s heart aches, a sharp stab from somewhere underneath his rib cage. He clenches his jaw and squeezes Cas’a hand.
When a sob starts to claw its way out past his throat, he rests his forehead against the cold stone.
Dean’s instinct is to brush him off, to try to worm his way out of this conversation that he is not ready to have. But his head throbs, his body aches, and he feels like he’s teetering on the proverbial cliff edge.
Dean, in all honesty, wishes he could just bolt out of his car while pushing 65, and just run for the hills and never look back. He heaves a sigh and grips the steering wheel with both hands hard enough to leave imprints from the ridges into his skin, knuckles turning white.
It’s a lot.
, thank fucking Christ.
“And I know you can’t see it,” Cas murmurs gently. “But I want to help you see it. Every day. I want to love you through all of it. For there is nobody else in this world for me but you.”
In the days following Chuck’s demise and Jack’s ascension, Dean grabs a canvas drop cloth from the garage and takes the guitar from where it sits in the corner of his bedroom. A film of dust covers the instrument.
An acoustic Taylor six-string.
“Cas,” Dean groans as he cards his hand through thick, black hair before reaching to frame his face. Cas dips his chin, seeking Dean’s mouth again and presses inside. Cas is like velvet, and Dean
“Did you hit your head?” And Sam’s reaching to pull Dean’s hand away to examine the bump himself in lieu of waiting for an answer.
“Cas?” Dean croaks out in a barely audible sound. The angel blinks and gives the smallest, almost indecipherable of nods, almost like he’s afraid to move.
He dives in.
Dean freezes. His mouth goes dry, and his vision blurs out of focus as he stares unseeingly into his glass. He can’t move. The paralysis sits in almost instantly and his chest feels like it’s being crushed under concrete.
They’re buried into the cocoon of Dean’s bed sometime later, cleaned and spent and boneless, Cas cradling Dean in the crook of his arm while running his fingers languidly through sandy brown hair.
“No, Cas. Stay. Stay with me.” And he reaches up to brush his thumb along the stubble of the angel’s jaw. His heart hammers when Cas leans into it.
“Those things I said? I...It kills me that I ever even said ‘em,” he says, green eyes pleading into blue. “You gotta know that.”
“Dean,” he starts. But Dean pulls back slightly, hands coming up to cup Cas’s face, fingers still in his hair. He lifts Cas’s jaw so that he can search his eyes.
“I know you won’t.”
Cas tilts his chin as he watches the smoke rise from the pit and nods, as if coming to a conclusion. “You asked me then what broke the connection.”
“Right. And so when it happens like that, sometimes I just...shut down. I panic. But you
Dean squeezes his eyes shut and nods knowingly. It may be a little easier to accept love up here, but sometimes old habits die hard. Even in death.
Dean nearly jumps out of his seat when Cas moves to open the passenger side door.
Cas freezes as his breathing quickens, and then Dean is slowly leaning in to brush his lips against Cas’s own.
“Thanks,” he murmurs, and glances around the otherwise empty garage as if forgetting he was here at all.
Dean clasps Cas’s hand with his own and draws them to his chest, his other hand wrapping around his waist coming to rest on his back. Cas’s free arm mimics Dean’s.
“Oof. Y’got magic in those fingers, angel,” Dean slurs and leans back into Cas’s front, sinking into him as Cas’s arms wrap around his torso, hands splayed across his belly. Cas rests his chin on the relieved shoulder.
Contentedness blooms in his belly, warming his insides until he feels like his body is humming. Everybody he has ever loved and lost in one room.
He swears Dean leans into it.
“Yeah, you like that, huh?” And Cas draws his bottom lip between his teeth as he nods, blue eyes blown with lust and hooded and fucking
Dean licks his lips nervously and grips the train of the trench coat with both hands, shaking it for emphasis. “I didn’t—god, I didn’t know, Cas. I didn’t know angels could feel or lo-love the way we do. An-and then you drop this huge bomb on me, and I didn’t even get a chance to say anything ‘cuz in the next minute you’re all
Cas is thoughtful for a moment, as if he were looking at the dates on a calendar inside the stars. Dean watches him in his periphery as he sips his beer, swallowing roughly.
“When Lucifer ki—” he drops his gaze then, because now his voice is too thick and his eyes are too flooded and he can’t see a goddamn thing. The tears fall directly to the ground without a blink. When he looks up again, tears keep spilling, but he clears his throat and keeps his voice steady. “I tried to get Billie to take me. I had nothin’ left.”
So he shrugs instead. Takes another swig with his eyes to the ceiling.
“I’m sorry,” he whispers.
He sniffles as Cas runs soothing circles against him.
“I don’t expect anything from you,” Cas absolves, voice becoming more steady and firm with each syllable.”I know that I’m simply a friend, a weapon in battle, a comrade in arms to you.” and then Cas is taking another step back to put more distance between them before meeting Dean’s eyes again.
“Stop.”
“Look at me, Dean.”
Dean grasps Cas’s chin and angles his mouth because the kiss is a little stiff at first, a little too much teeth, and when he moves just a fraction of an inch, it’s the free fall.
-” and he reaches a hand to find a goose egg there. He scrunches his eyes shut for a second to try to clear his vision, and thankfully, he sees a little clearer upon opening.
And he’ll think, maybe, just maybe, he deserves it.
“I’m going to bed,” she announces to both of them before stepping into Sam’s awaiting embrace. They kiss softly, and something inside Dean melts because he’s so happy to see them together again.
“Shh,” he soothes. “I’ve got you,” and his thumb rubs tantalizing circles around him again. Dean’s cock is gorgeous; heavy and thick and pink and wet in Cas’s grasp, and he bends to press a kiss to the head, sweeping his tongue back and forth over the leaking slit, lavishing the taste that is purely and simply, Dean.
Sam’s face spreads into a grin and drops a hand to Dean’s shoulder. “Yeah. She’s good, man. She’s okay. She’ll be happy to see you.”
“Dean…” and Dean pulls back slightly at the crack in Cas’s voice. Tears spill over in those cobalt blues, and Dean’s thumbs are quick to catch them as he frames Cas’s face.
Dean closes his eyes involuntarily and reaches up Cas’s coat until they grasp either side of the angel’s neck, thumbs pressed against the curved line of his jaw underneath his earlobes.
Now though, after Jack pulled him out of the Empty, grace left behind, he’s finding it exceedingly more difficult to hide behind a mask. Especially now that his built-in armor is gone.
Cas simply smiles and gives Dean a knowing look. “Jack may have had something to do with it.”
Dean shakes his head, and there’s a pang of guilt that slams into his chest. He leans forward on his elbows into Cas’s space.
“Well at least I made it to Heaven,” Dean murmurs to himself. In the next moment, a familiar structure appears a few yards away.
“Sam,” he groans, the movement of his jaw intensifying the pounding in the back of his head. “
He’s thought about guys in the past, sure. He’s found them attractive, found himself curious about the potential of it. But he never allowed his mind to really go there. The only time it ever happened was when Sam was in college, and Dean was too shattered drunk to remember it the next day. It was always something that was kept out of reach, something completely forbidden like the fruit in Eden, and never acknowledged. He’s repressed and shut it down so many times—hell,
Dean makes a fist, and watches blood pool into his palm before pressing it against the cinder block.
“I mean, for you...how long—” Dean trails off as he stares into the dancing flames, hand clasped into Cas’s over the blanket. Cas’s thumb rubs against the back of his hand as reassurance that
The drive home is quiet.
Wings.
“You don’t need to be afraid. I’m here. For as long as you want me to be.”
Dean squeezes his hand and drops his head to the pillow. “
Dean sets his jaw and takes one step forward. His legs feel numb, like a shock of electricity has just bolted through them, and they suddenly shake under his weight.
“Hm,” Dean agrees, and he smiles as Cas trails a thumb over the back of his knuckles.
A breath.
His eyes flit between Cas’s and his lips and back again, and he flattens his free palm on Cas’s chest, just over where his heart would be.
Dean’s stomach drops. The wind blows again, and the fallen leaves swirl in a circle around their feet.
“Here, hold this there.” Sam’s moving Dean’s other hand, bag of veggies plopping on the table, to force him to press the ice cube into his skin until he’s lucid enough to do it himself.
Dean squeezes his eyes shut. He’s not used to this. Not used to the complete adoration that Cas gives him, not used to the aftercare or anything resembling this.
He lets his index finger trace the letters of her name. Grief, guilt, and loss unfurls from behind his rib cage and grips around his heart like tentacles.
Maybe Dean gets goosebumps, chick flick moments be damned.
, it turned his whole world upside down.
Dean’s arms grip him in a bruising, cocooning hug. He has one arm across the span of Cas’s back and the other is wrapped high and tight around his shoulders, hand cupping the angel’s head. Dean curls his fingers into the velvet muss of black hair.
Dean shifts minutely, dipping his chin slightly to move away for air; but not before he sucks Cas’s bottom lip between his own, gently nipping with his teeth. Claiming.
Dean smiles and chuckles low in his throat. “Hey Sam,” he calls over, and his little brother spins around to face Dean from where he stands next to a rack of vinyls.
“Hello.”
He wishes he could meld Dean into him then, just to envelope him completely, to shield him from everything that could hurt him the way he once could.
It’s a small, quiet thing. Cas’s hand stills over the rim of the second glass before he glances over his shoulder at Dean.
Dean’s hand comes to frame Cas’s face, curling the other into a fist against his chest, and he has his eyes closed as he lets out a whimper.
His phone continues to vibrate on the cement ground. It’s deafening.
It’s a gentle, smoldering thing; not urgent or frenzied, neither panicked nor rushed. Something heavy and ethereal blooms behind Castiel’s ribs and spreads through his limbs, leaving sparks and tingles in its wake. He lets himself sink against the counter, and welcomes all of Dean’s weight as he presses into him.
“Hey. What the hell happened?” And Dean doesn’t know how to respond.
He feels everything so much more intensely now. And he hates it, particularly in moments like these. Because he doesn’t want to feel insecure, he doesn’t want Dean to feel guilty, he doesn’t want to rock the boat.
“And I don’t mean it in a dick way,” he amends, and Dean knows he doesn’t. But still. Sam’s quiet for a second before continuing. “This has to do with dad, right?”
“Y’know what my mom used to tell me? Every night before she tucked me in?”
Silence settles between them for a moment. The wind blows, and it’s gentle and soothing across Dean’s cheeks. The slight chill that erupts over his skin feels not unlike tending to a bruise with ice.
“Yeah, well...obvious to everybody but me, I guess.”
,” he hisses through clenched teeth.
But then Dean’s reaching to take his glass out of his hand and placing it on the counter before his hand encircles Cas’s wrist. His eyes shoot up to meet emerald green, and he feels paralyzed, because lying to Dean has never been easy.
“Cas, listen,” Dean breathes as he turns so that he’s standing in front of him now. Cas’s chin drops to his chest, avoiding his eyes, so Dean tries to reassure him by wrapping one hand around his wrist. And it seems to work, because Cas is looking up at him again.
Dean reaches out both hands, gripping the beige covered shoulders before pulling Cas into his chest.
. He jumps.
Dean stills then, because he’s a mess from the flood of tears that won’t stop coming, and his voice starts trembling and his breathing is erratic and when he looks at Cas the moon is bathing him in a soft silver glow and everything is just
Ragged, panting breaths fill the air around them as Cas lowers his forehead to Dean’s, and Dean lifts his chin to kiss Cas’s mouth softly.
Dean turns in his arms, and Cas starts to step back when Dean’s hands fall to his hips, anchoring him there.
Cas knocks his head back against the finished wood and anchors a hand into Dean’s hair, gripping and releasing with stunted breaths.
A beat. Sam folds his hands together on the table in front of him.
Dean chuckles and rolls his eyes. “Different kinda magic there, Cas.”
Dean’s hand grips his shoulder and he spins Cas around to face him.
“Hmm?”
Dean sits down with a groan at the table and presses the bag to the back of his head. Sam hands him the compress before taking his usual seat opposite Dean. He deposits two beer bottles between them.
In every healing touch. In every embrace. In every answered prayer. In every sacrifice.
Cas lifts his chin and tries a fake smile again, reaching to take a sip from his glass. He hums softly as the hints of vanilla, butterscotch, and an array of berries flow down his throat.
He comes across it on a hunt one day.
“Are you ready?” Cas breathes, rocking against him again. Dean grips Cas’s sides and nods.
“Yes.”
“Ready to head in?” he asks.
A sigh of relief punches out from Dean’s lungs as he drops his head, chin to chest.
“‘s how I feel about you, you know. I’m not good with words, but..,” Dean slurs and sucks a gentle kiss into Cas’s neck. “This could totally be our song.”
“Sit with your back against the headboard,” Dean commands, and when Cas gets situated, Dean settles between Cas’s legs, eyeing his flushed, curved arousal.
“I dunno,” he starts, lifting his face from the compress to look Sam in the eye. “Think I had some sort of panic attack or somethin’. Puked, started hearin’ shit, felt like my heart was gonna give out. My mind was racin’ so I cracked it against the wall thinking it would help. Everything was too bright. Guess at some point I passed out ‘cause the next thing I remember you’re shakin’ me awake.” He reaches for a beer bottle and twists off the cap, tossing it with a clatter on the table.
“You’re stiff,” he deduces. “Sit down. Let me,” and he leads Dean to his bed so he can sit perpendicular to the mattress. Cas slides in behind him on his knees, hands snaking to graze Dean’s sides, pulling up the hem of his shirt over his head. He tosses it to the hamper in the corner and runs his hands up Dean’s arms before placing them at the slope of his shoulders.
Dean reaches beside him to thread his fingers between Cas’s as their eyes meet.
Dean’s throat constricts. His stomach churns at the memory.
Dean lets out a whimper into Cas’s mouth as his cock begins to strain in his boxers. Cas’s tongue rolls against Dean’s and he reaches his hands down Dean’s front, letting his palms run against the ripples of muscle and bone and the pudge at his navel.
The wind gusts gently around them. The blades of grass dance.
He walks across the room until the wall is inches from his face. He places the guitar gingerly on the ground, the neck with the wings and headstock resting against where the Empty had swallowed everything inside of him whole.
Dean looks up at Cas over the open fire, letting his face melt into a smile before glancing down again.
Cas’s mouth spreads into a small smile, and Dean turns to lead him inside. The bedroom is bathed in a soft glow from the lamp on his bedside table, and he reaches around Cas’s shoulder to shut the door behind them. He lets his hand brush against Cas’s back, and he grins at the shiver it elicits in response.
“Do you want me to do the other?”
The pad of Cas’s thumb sweeps over Dean’s cheekbone as both hands come to frame his face.
“Yeah, I know. Me too. C’mon, baby, I gotcha. Let go,” and Dean gives a firm squeeze with a flick of his wrist, and Cas shouts as he comes apart in Dean’s palm between them, grace shining out from behind his eyes. It only takes three more thrusts, and then stars explode from behind Dean’s eyelids as he shatters inside Cas, and then they are perfectly still.
Dean’s head snaps up then, and he stares sideways at Cas, brow furrowed.
“When you...did what you did, an-and said what you said...” Dean shakes his head to try to clear his mind. “I could never wash that jacket. Your handprint, it...it was the only thing I had left of you.”
“I’m so sorry,” Dean whispers. It’s a broken, barely audible thing. But the angel must have heard, because then Cas grips him even tighter and presses his lips into Dean’s hair.
“I wanted to let you know,” Jack begins as he steps closer to Dean, “that Eileen is back. She’s at the bunker with Sam. He’s explaining everything that happened. Donna, Jody, and the girls are all back too. They’re safe.”
The voice in his head is cackling now, and Dean wishes he could throw something at it, punch it, cut it out of his mind but he can’t. So he grips his hair and pulls. His stomach rolls again, but he knows there’s nothing left to come up.
,” Dean whimpers into Cas’s mouth before pressing his lips to his ear. “Please,” and he chokes on a sob because he needs; needs Cas like nothing he’s ever known.
Missouri and Pamela sit at the table nearest to Dean and Cas, talking about when Pamela séance’d Cas after Dean was rescued from Hell.
“Been wantin’ to do this for a while,” he says, eyes downcast while picking at the strings.
A life after death.
“I’ll go get us some more,” he says, plastering his best attempt at a smile on his face as he starts heading for the kitchen. Dean’s footfalls are quickly behind him.
“I prayed to you every night in Purgatory...because you’re the only thing I’ve ever believed in. ‘Cuz leavin’ without you wasn’t an option for me. It didn’t matter if it meant bein’ stuck there for another week, or another month or another year. I didn’t want to come back here without you.”
,” Dean groans and lets his neck go slack as Cas works.  His fingers are heaven, and he can feel the crunching underneath them.
But for the life of him, he can’t. Instead, his voice shakes.
Jack smiles. “All as it should be.”
It hits Dean then.
“Goodnight, Dean,” he whispers, and then makes to head to his own room. Dean is quick to grab Cas’s wrist.
and I will break your faces.”
”…I, ...well, ...obviously you’re going Dean, but I don’t want either of you dying young. It will take years before you will see it. Then again, maybe it’s better this way, I can still bring improvements”
“Of course”
kind of 'intent-to-mate' alpha bullshit. I thought Ellen could be my guardian." Dean had his arms crossed and noticed Ellen eyeing Cas but the omega resisted the urge to check. He knew Cas had his back so he kept his glare on the lawyer. Sam’s scent was going haywire, filled with anger and indignation.
Cas sighed.
“Hmmm, sounds good”
“Jack is fine, he’s growing into it, adjusting with his new status. He changed some of Heaven’s laws but they mainly remain the same.”
They went back in the mall. It didn’t take them long to find a jacket and some new flannels for Claire. They agreed to meet up at the hotel later and leave together for the concert.
“No! You have to try it on. And we still don’t have the flannel or the jacket”
Becky looked at him bewildered so Dean explained to her
“Hmm, is that so?” Cas chuckled. “Clean yourself up, pet.”
“Trail your hand over your hip bones and touch your belly, just above your cock…” under Cas’ instruction, he caressed his lower abdomen and inner thighs, ignoring his aching cock and throbbing hole and did so until he moaned his frustration. Cas chuckled and rewarded him for his patience by allowing him to cup his balls. Dean trembled on the bed from the intense sensation.
Cas took a moment to compose himself. "You said you've never been with an alpha, either male or female"
“What did you say?”
He spoke again, still crowding Dean.
“Claire…”
“I… erm, gods, this is so… I don’t know where it came from.”
"Marvelous. Please have a seat, there is much to discuss."
Dean laughed at that, picking the label of his root beer.
“Heaven truly is beautiful now. It’s open. Anyone can meet anyone, friends and family can visit each other. It’s how it should have been all along. I wish you could see it”
Dean slid his finger back inside and started working himself while he kept his eyes on the screen.
“You’re so tight, so wet for me, aren’t you?”
“Oh… Sorry, Ms Ketchum.”
“Hm. But it’s not burning adrenaline and sometimes it’s like my whole body is vibrating but I can’t do anything about it and I don’t think I could just sit there and meditate.” Sam was on the edge of his seat, eyes set on the older alpha, one hand holding his jaw.
“It’s fine. It’s so you to come out in order to defend other people.” Sam patted him on the shoulder, releasing him from the hug.
"He saw my ruble and told me." Dean played with the makeshift amulet. "He doesn't know I work for the mafia and he doesn't know Alastair is dead and he's afraid of going to see his family because of him."
WARNING: mentions of past child abuse (cuz John Winchester is a shitty parent), mentions of past underage prostitution (over 16 but under 18/21, no penetrative sexual acts), mention of past attempted rape, homophobic rhetoric at the end of the chapter (but the bad guys get a good ass-whopping)
Sammy pauses. Her shirt says,
Deanna coughed up a flower, and wondered if it’d be better if she just bailed on this case. Her dad would never know, she justified, and maybe she was already chafing under his strict rules anyway. This god wasn’t hurting anyone; this wasn’t even a hunt, just some people in the town who were killing each other because they wanted to, and this inhuman thing that merely existed nearby. Stories, Deanna knew, had power. Something amused came from the thing, which was now only human-shaped because Deanna had thought about it very hard.
“How are things, up there?” Deanna asks, rather than acknowledge this.
Deanna silently takes the proffered shovel and starts digging into the cold ground. Her bad knee aches in the cold and this is definitely going to make her back sore tomorrow, but she’d rather the pain than the unsettling nature of how it feels now when Cas’s grace trespasses through her veins. Cas perches on a huge cement statue – they must be in one of those old battlefield sites, from the Revolution or the Civil War – and watches. In the darkness, her wings arc vast and familiar over Deanna’s head; they blot out the stars.
Ada snorts. “Good luck.”
, Sammy says. Voice like a knife singing, voice like a man screaming.
Sammy groans. “Do you guys ever stop?”
It will echo around the room –
, something asks them, someday. A djinn, or maybe not.
Deanna turns. She wraps her arms around her stomach, head hurting too much to lean down and grab her shirt, but desperate all the same to hide her scars and the rolls on her stomach and the ragged sports bra she’d died in.
They walk into the room, and Bobby and Sammy both snap up. Bobby’s eyes are cold, kind of, and Deanna wonders how she missed that – was he really that angry, over their whole chaos? Something in her whispers it:
Deanna turns to the blonde girl sitting with them, who had called John’s phone that was nearly dead and has so far reacted to neither holy water, nor silver, nor Sammy’s horrible jokes. “So your name is Ada.”
Victoria shrugs. “Castiel over there doesn’t seem like she’ll stop me.”
“Shit changed,” Sammy says. “So we did too.”
Deanna looks over at her sister suddenly enough that the car swerves, and blinks past auras flitting through her vision to address her sisters and the baby in her lap. “Sammy, dude, you ok?”
Mom isn’t the only one who makes an appearance, as Sammy burns hotter, moving in Deanna’s arms and murmuring almost feverishly, talking to people who aren’t there. It’s terrifying, that Deanna can’t kill the things that are terrorizing Sammy. Then Alistair appears, which makes Deanna nauseous, and Jesse too.
“Yeah,” Sammy says. “There’s nothing more beautiful than putting art on your skin for the world to see, right?”
said Deanna’s sibling.
Then the sun’s setting, and Missouri’s rustling around in the kitchen cooking something that would smell good, if Deanna was any kind of hungry. The world’s awash in gold for a little while as the three Winchester sisters sit around the table, and then soon it’s gone, and all is dark again.
“Hey, angel,” Deanna says. “Welcome to the party.”
Sammy puts a hand on her shoulder. Ada leans into it and then away, blinking furiously. Apparently terrifying codependency is also a genetic trait.
“Apparently I do,” Deanna mutters.
(Here’s the story about Victoria Henricksen.
Joshua shrugs. “You started this apocalypse. He doesn’t want to stop it, and neither should you.”
Samuel Campbell sells them out, which is unsurprising. Castiel goes to find Crowley’s bones, and Magnus is God-knows-where, and when Samuel comes up to the door of the cage they’ve put Deanna in, she reaches out and grabs onto his head. He struggles but she slams his head forward into the bars, slams it hard enough to hear his skull crack like an egg, lets the blood splash and bares her teeth at the last bit of surprise in his eyes.
“Good things come in threes,” Anna says. “They say there are three – maiden, mother, crone, father, son, Holy Ghost.”
Ruby’s there then, and Sammy’s yelling at them to stop but Deanna can’t stop, not now. She loses herself in the exhilaration of it, the way it brings sharpness back into her world. She wonders what her dad would say, seeing her fighting alongside a demon, but then she remembers dad telling her that she might need to put Sammy down, too. She and the demon slam heads into tables, and Deanna loves this, loves knocking down men a foot taller than her who think because she’s a short girl that she can’t fight, loves the sting of it in her fists and loves the pain of it –
“De,” Ada says, sounding too much like Sammy, and Deanna wonders when she picked up that nickname. Wonders why it doesn’t sound wrong, like it does coming from everyone except Sammy.
Ada asks someday, a little angry and a little bitter over a small argument.
The hunting community likes to gossip about each other. That never changes.
. Sammy’s lips are a flat line. Neither of them can quite find the humor in the situation. Deanna doesn’t even know what she’s asking, just knows that if Sammy goes again something inside her will break.
“I know,” Joshua replies, looking around at the beautiful windows. “He is finished. It is admirable, I think.”
Ada mouths
“Hey – ” Sammy’s voice cuts off. “Oh.”
Bobby avoids responding. “So you said you found this kid on a hunt with Samuel? Campbell?”
Sammy says.
“Get me
(See the end of the chapter for
But then Castiel.
“Gwen says it’d be best if we took the kid back to the Campbell compound.”
Alistair is on the rack, and Deanna’s holding the razor and the needle. It’s a reversal, but it’s also the fulfillment of a promise. Deanna wants to puke, but she’s good at this, just like all girls – good at forcing things down her own throat, bottling them up, keeping them quiet and storing the hurt for a glorious someday.
Bobby seems as thrown by this as they are.
Bobby grimaces and explains the deal – his soul for the location of Death. Deanna’s
He’d given her that exhausted look.
Cas coalesces out of starlight and the smell of thunderstorms, out of rain and electricity and indeterminable things. “I do not exist at your beck and call,” she says.
The body that crashes to the ground is not Ada, not anymore. Ada, Deanna remembers desperately, is not Michael’s true vessel. Michael’s grace is seeping out her – their skin, pouring down their cheeks like radioactive blue blood, eyes full of light that promise nothing but annihilation. Blonde hair swirls like the rays of light extending from saints’ heads in old iconography, like a halo, and they are covered in gore as Ada’s body falls apart at its very seams.
Castiel’s face is stony. “You have far more capacity for good than even you think.”
“You found God yet?” Deanna asks. What a weird question. It sounds like something a preacher would ask you, or one of those big billboards –
“Do it anyway,” Jamie tells her, and then all that lithe gracefulness is replaced by
Deanna turns to her younger sister, sees the blood drip down her nose. She comes to the realization that was
“I am inevitable.” Death takes another bite of his pizza. “Now or later, it doesn’t matter. In the end, everyone will return to me.”
“Don’t touch me,” Deanna says, shoving herself backwards. “
Deanna leans on the shovel and takes this in. “Would my parents have even fallen in love if not for you guys?”
“I don’t know how we’re going to fix this,” Deanna says.
, she whispered.)
Victoria snaps into motion, stepping forward. “You give that boy his soul back,” Victoria warns Balthazar. “You might be an angel, but I’ve met worse.” As far as threats go, it’s not too strong. But Victoria’s angry, and Victoria picks things up fast, and the way she’s holding the angel-blade tells Deanna all she needs to know.
Deanna learned to sleep with a gun under her pillow, and always took turns too fast. Sammy learned how to skip meals, and then Sammy learned how to leave.
“Yeah, has been for a while.”
“Hush,” Castiel tells her, dangerous and righteous.
They light a circle of holy fire around the angel, Balthazar. He has silver flickering around him, if Deanna can even call it that, stitched across his skin like some kind of Frankenstein. He stands casually, but it is wrong. It’s always wrong, with angels. He raises his voice to catch Deanna, lurking in the shadows. “You could take me apart, righteous girl. You can see them, I know you can.”
Ada looks appropriately disgruntled.
Deanna starts, “There’s things here that you don’t know about – ”
“Yeah,” Sammy agrees. “That’s how you talk about family. Especially if you don’t like them.”
Sammy’s mouth purses. “Not really.”
“Why should I believe you?” Deanna asks, because angels
But Deanna asks eventually, because Gabriel is an ally or maybe a friend, now.
– and she will. “It’s fine,” she says aloud. “So whose side are you on? Heaven, or Hell?”
“Look, asshat,” Deanna starts, because, really, they’re going to get into this now?
"Fine,” Sammy says.
Deanna sighs. “Yeah, sure.”
“Fine,” Deanna replies.
They sit in silence for another minute.
Sammy goes ramrod-straight.
“Then why the hell are you asking how I am?”
Someday, monsters will yell and shriek and laugh that they have caught a
(Someday, Sammy will cry, and tell her the truth.
Cas looks at her, and Deanna thinks, just for a minute, that she will. Then Cas drops her. Cas is only an inch or two shorter than her, but the disgust in her expression is enough to make Deanna feel small. “Nobody deserves this pain, Deanna,” she says. “Not even you, as despicable as you are.”
Deanna makes out with guys in restrooms and then gets kicked out of bars, stands in the parking lot and laughs, drunk and split-lipped and hating herself. She wants to hurt someone. Except that’s not true, is it. She just wants to hurt herself.
(The thing that gets forgotten, in the following days, is that Crowley and Deanna have a hesitant sort of understanding after this trip. But nobody likes talking about that, so instead they focus on the fact that Cas and Sammy come back no longer hating each other’s guts.
“Are you a trickster?” Sammy asks.
“Uh,” Deanna says intelligently. “Vic – put your gun down, this is Castiel. Cas, this is Victoria Henricksen.”
“You killed me,” Cas says to Raphael.
“There’s something wrong with my head,” Deanna admits, instead of denying it, or wishing it away, which definitely surprises her as much as it does Missouri.
“What do you mean you don’t know – ”
“You’re literally thirty,” Ada replies. “Stop being so curmudgeonly. Jo says we should come back. Bobby’s got some news.”
Deanna swallows. “I know,” she says roughly.
Ada knows her too well.
“Just…I need to be able to – to protect you.”
They will all carefully avoid what else Sammy and Cas’s bonding time during Deanna’s Death-chase had resulted in. They will all carefully avoid what happened next.)
Deanna glances around, stumbling to her feet and clutching her hand. She doesn’t know where Cliff went, but right now she’s more worried about her own sisters.
Castiel slams her against the Impala, which,
Deanna feels the silence stretch out. “Yes.”
Castiel stops, and her eyes flare, and in them Deanna beholds galaxies. “You do a disservice to yourself, dirtying a soul so bright,” she says, which,
Deanna says,
, John roared at Sammy.
“Key word ‘sometimes’.”
Deanna shoves her shoulder, which is like punching concrete. She grits her teeth and tries not to show it in her face; from Gabriel’s smirk, the angel knows.
“De,” Sammy groans.
“Look,” Deanna says. “Whatever you’re thinking,” they all know what she’s thinking, “
Sammy doesn’t stop her from torching the bones, but as the sparks catch, she says, “Requiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.”
Sammy winces as she swallows down her eggs.
“Samuel called,” Sammy says. “Alpha shifter. When you get back, we can head up and deal with it.”
This isn’t a question any of them can answer, nor do they really want to. Ada hangs up not long after that, which leaves Sammy and Deanna to uncomfortably avoid the topics that aren’t good for conversation right now, which is more or less everything. Bobby’s face is much easier to deal with than the archangels that briefly resided in their bodies.
(Deanna never figures out when she realized, really, that Sammy always flinched when she touched the Bible. That her hands shook and there was a slight burn where the Rosary rested on her bare skin, that the exorcisms made her wince and that she sang the hymns anyway.
“Go find Sam and Ada,” Deanna tells her. “Don’t come back.” She doesn’t know what it means about her that she doesn’t want Cas to watch. Doesn’t want Cas –
Jo laughed, sharp like a razor.
– and Sammy makes a noise of pain, the bonds no doubt rough against her bruises.
“Well, that’s all well and good, Cas, but Ada said – ”
Ada grimaces. “Needles aren’t my favorite.”
Deanna snorts. “Yeah, apparently he’s not dead.”
Cas asks.
“Congratulations,” Crowley tells them. He’s looking right at Deanna. “Even I don’t know how you got out.”
She takes another sip of her beer.
Sammy raises her eyebrows and does the nodding thing, like
There’s a misty forest and a dark warehouse, and Sammy’s a bleeding-heart girl sometimes. She tries to get the other vampires out, the ones who were under the Alpha’s knife just as he is now, apparently, under theirs. Apparently, since Samuel didn’t see fit to tell them – the Alpha vamp’s in chains, and he hisses at Deanna as she sneaks past.
“Cas,” Deanna says suddenly, needing to offer something. She can’t stand it, can’t stand the way Sammy moves away. “I was talking to Cas.”
“I am not
“Normal didn’t
“I know,” Missouri says. “I know.” She steps back, and hands Deanna a big blue sweatshirt. “Pull this on, and then come help me with dinner.”
Ada untangles her fingers, scowling. “The sooner the better.”
Sammy’s face will be contemplative. Gabriel and Sammy are friends now, in a strange way, like actually friends.
Zachariah’s a dick.
Castiel is a being of cosmic significance. Yet for some reason she looks Deanna in the eyes, and for a moment Deanna is drowning in them, in the splitting of the world – in how
Ada sighs. “We had a fall injury go out earlier. Drunk dude put his head through drywall.”
“Jerk.”
“Work for me.” Crowley smiles. “And I’ll consider giving back dear old Bobby’s soul.”
side not my body is a cage is a good song, but the santa clara vanguard 2018 version of it is even better (baritone duet has my heart) probably nobodys gonna know what im talking about but if theres any dci ppl out there just know i love you
Deanna told Sammy, so long ago.
Castiel looks back at her. There is no emotion in her face, but she reaches out a hand that is like a beam of sunlight and Deanna feels the grace sweep through her, gentler this time. “I suppose neither of us are the weapons we think we are.” Then, “You did well, capturing Alistair for us.”
They talk for a few hours about what’s been happening. Bobby calls halfway through, except Rufus is the one who’s actually calling. He tells them that Victoria had gotten in touch, that the pair of them are going to start tracking Eve. Sammy, who seems to trust Rufus quite a lot more now that he’s actually working with Bobby, tells him what they know. Bobby hops on at the end, gruff as usual, and Deanna won’t admit it but even with how unsteady the whole world is, it’s good to hear his voice. His and Rufus’s, the crazy old bat.
Ada sinks into it, just a little bit. Then she stiffens. “Deanna – what’s this?”
“Aw, Sam,” Magnus coos, while Deanna grapples with Bobby, who’s got a knife and a face so devoid of expression that it’s terrifying. “Isn’t so easy now, is it, without all the fun juice keeping you high in the sky?” Magnus says to Sammy. He cocks his head at Ada. “Finally got her a tattoo, though, so maybe you’re not as dumb as you look.”
“I’m not bailing you out of the drunk tank,” Sammy tells her.
“Deanna,” Cas growls.
Then Cas is gone.
Sammy raises a spiteful eyebrow at her. “So we gonna talk about your drinking, then?”
“Oh, we’re not here for you, little runaway,” Zachariah tells her, smiling, though he sidesteps her like she is something repulsive. Something horrifying. “We were invited, didn’t you hear? The Righteous girl is finally giving in.”
Gabriel watches Deanna, standing illuminated at the front of the alley. Zachariah’s really dead this time, his body laying on the ground amongst the litter and the rotting food. The burnt outline of his wings on the ground is edged in silver, but already puddles are washing it away; there’s a metaphor in there, somewhere.
Deanna looks away. “Don’t know how I could forget.”
“Holy shit.”
“Maybe I don’t need you watching me every step of the way,” Sammy snaps at Deanna.
“Sit,” he says. He is the friend you greet in church, he is the man tucked in the corner of every library, he is the face you see before you slam closed the ambulance doors. He has a calm voice, and a nice face. He is the end of all things.
Deanna’s never alone, not anymore. Not even in her own head.
Sammy’s twitching, gesturing wildly with her hands as she talks about a Sumerian legend, about descending into the underworld. The dye isn’t really sticking in her hair, not with how dark it is. She’s not quite Sammy but at least she’s there.
Such fragile words. Deanna thinks they make her beautiful.
, Castiel.” For a moment, his voice sounds like John’s. “Don’t tell me you haven’t figured it out.” He waves a hand at the Winchester sisters, and apparently he’s the only angel who doesn’t mind being blunt, it just comes along with shorting out all the electricity within three hundred square miles. “Michael’s sword, Lucifer’s sword. You’ll say yes someday, the both of you. This has been planned for thousands of years. Funny, isn’t it?”
Deanna scoffs, and Ruby looks like the cat that got the cream. It occurs to Deanna that Ruby might be using Anna to make Sammy jealous, since Sammy’s whole falling-over-herself in front of Castiel. This makes Deanna want to vomit.
“I tried,” Raphael tells her. For an all-powerful archangel, he seems fairly put-out by the fact that he didn’t succeed. He continues to insult the four of them in equal turns.
When Deanna and Sammy return to life, everything is wrong.
“I wonder if Bobby would know who that was,” Sammy says. She’s still talking kind of quickly, but not as manic as she used to get when she was drinking demon blood. Deanna does and does not want to know what she’s on instead. Hopefully it’s something less harmful, like the fumes of the nail polish she keeps peeling off her nails. “I can’t think of what deity that would be, not with how much we’ve been focusing on Christianity recently.”
“Wow,” Sam breathes, and it’s zero parts shock and all parts knowing and Dean hates it.
He looks so painfully, beautifully
“Do you really think…” and he trails off, shaking his head because it won’t stop spinning and Cas is still too far away and he doesn’t know what the fuck to do in this present situation.
For him.
Dean leans back into his chair, left hand draped over Cas’s knee, the other nursing a fresh beer.  He stares pensively into the flames, watching sparks from the air pockets float up and disappear.
Cas reaches to cup Dean’s face before resting their foreheads together. “
“More than one.” It’s nostalgic; reminiscent of a lifetime ago.
That’s when he sees it.
He nods with a lick of his lips before taking another pull from the glass.
“Check it out,” Dean says, striding over to where the guitar is sitting on the floor leaning against one of the walls. He wraps a hand gingerly around the neck, his other hand coming to grip against the back.
The stiffness melts into a pliant congruity; Dean’s lips are wet and salty from the moisture on his face, Cas’s soft and dry and taking. The heady juxtaposition of it makes Dean draw Cas even closer.
When he goes to his room later that night, the wings gleam mockingly in the glow of the lamp on his bedside table. As if the guitar knows.
Cas squints in that way he does as he looks up at Dean through his lashes across the library table. He tilts his head in question.
“Jerk,” Sam shoots over his shoulder.
God, how he loves him.
Cas moans around him, and the vibration of Cas’s throat against him is exquisite. He begins to thrust slowly into Cas’s mouth, and Cas takes everything Dean gives, over and over again.
“When?” Dean asks some time later, barely above a whisper, and it feels like the most loaded question in the history of humanity. Maybe it is.
The smooth burn on his tongue settles into his stomach, and it grounds him, allowing him to bite back the tears that threaten to fall. He braces himself against the counter, and Dean’s hand falls from Cas’s wrist to his side.
The sun shines more brilliantly and warmer here.
Dean strums the guitar a couple of times, tuning the keys where needed and testing it again, alternating between picking and full strums. He glances at Cas through his eyelashes and throws a shy smile his way.
“You look good,” Dean says wistfully before patting Jack’s cheek. His hand falls with a slap against his thigh.
“It’s always been you,” he says, all sandpaper and gravel and thick with tears. He lightly hits Cas’s chest just above his heart.
Dean furrows his brow. “Don’t sound too surprised there, Sammy.” And he’s pissed at that because,
And well, it’s not a total lie. A lie by omission, sure. But still. Small victories.
He knocks his head against the backrest of his chair. “I’m scared, Cas,” he breathes, staring up at the sky.
“And that’s when I knew I had fallen in love with you.”
“I didn’t know what it was at first. But I would have given anything in that moment to absolve your hurt and your pain, because knowing I was responsible for it..it was the worst thing I’d ever felt.”
Cas squeezes his eyes shut before opening them again. He stares unseeingly towards the horizon.
It takes some time, but after a while, Dean’s heart starts to slow. His eyes adjust. He can feel the pressure in his chest begin to ease, and he’s able to breathe.
Cas trails off for a moment, pensive as he looks at their entwined hands before canting his eyes to the stars again.
Dean smiles. “Night.”
“I ‘unno,” Dean slurs through the parchment paper that masquerades as his mouth. “I got sick.”
Dean fishes blindly into his pockets, hoping, praying—
Most days, he finds himself practicing in the library, with his socked feet kicked up on the table, guitar cradled against his stomach and thighs, with a glass of whiskey nearby.
“You’re
The existential dread settles around him like an oppressive blackness, squeezing and crushing his bones and liquifying his limbs. Every muscle in his body aches, and his chest protests with every labored breath, anxiety and panic radiating from his front to his back like a carousel, and it feels like a vice crushing him: a sharp, hot pain.
,” Cas repeats slowly into his ear.
“I held your soul in my hands,” he goes on. “I rebuilt your body atom by atom. There is
Dean grins widely before grasping that tie again.
“Stop,” he whispers.”Just
Dean takes a labored breath, taking his free hand to rest it against his chest.
He can feel the heat creep up his neck and settle in his cheeks and in the tips of his ears. He’s not sure if he’s even allowed to show this kind of intimacy yet, and to spill his guts to Cas twice in the same night, it’s...well.
“It’s okay,” Cas murmurs gently against the line of Dean’s jaw, rubbing circles near the small of his back. “I know.”
“Hang on...how did you get out? How did you get here?”
“Cas,” he calls out, and Cas tries his best to steel himself against the ache in his chest as he continues walking.
Jack just smiles and waves a hand. “It’s fine,” he says, and Dean can’t help the small ache of pride that’s budding in his chest.
“Mm,” Dean hums around Castiel’s cock before doing it again, wrapping his fingers along its base, pumping and squeezing in tandem with the bobbing of his head. Cas’s neck arches back as he begins to move in Dean’s mouth.
Everyone’s here.
Once her footsteps have faded down the hall, Dean turns to open the freezer. “Ice” of course means a bag of frozen veggies, and Sam walks to the sink to soak a washcloth from the cupboard under cold water.
Silence settles between them, and it’s not entirely uncomfortable. But it leaves Dean too alone with his thoughts, too alone with the demons lurking in the shadows of his consciousness, waiting and poised for an ambush.
“It, um. It loosely translates to ‘So beautiful, my love’ in English.”
Dean’s shoulders drop of their own volition, and hangs his head because he
Cas turns his head to meet Dean’s eyes, and it’s tilted at an angle. Dean’s breath stutters in his chest because the dark blue of Castiel’s sweater makes his eyes pop so that the blues look like marbles. The crease between Cas’s eyes deepens as he furrows his brow.
Cas lifts his head and rests a hand on Dean’s elbow, fingers curling around his forearm. “I wanted to give you your space,” he says before letting his hand fall back to his side. “I knew Sam would come for you. Figured it would have been easier that way.”
“I love you,” Cas says through unshed tears lodged in his throat. And there’s such a raw sincerity and tenacity in his voice that it makes Dean’s bottom lip tremble.
Cas moans, deep and throaty into Dean’s mouth, and lets his weight settle on top of him. Dean can feel Cas’s cock twitching against his thigh, and his hands snake inside the back of Cas’s pants, cupping his ass. He arches his back to rut against him.
The intimate consonance of lips and tongue has him reeling; Cas’s tongue flicks and swirls so expertly and effortlessly against Dean’s own, it’s like he was always meant to be there. Dean can’t hold back the moan that rips from his throat.
Cas ducks his head. “It was an accident, I assure you,” and Dean can’t help but feel a little bad for the guy.
“Cas?”
“No,” Cas says, lifting his chin to look him in the eye. “We have now. That’s enough.”
He turns on his heel, and standing under the giant oak tree in the moonlight, about twenty five yards away, is Castiel.
“Forever okay with you?”
The world stops.
“C’mere,” he breathes, crushing their mouths together in a filthy, bruising kiss. The taste of himself on Castiel’s lips is spellbinding.
When he feels the tightrope that he’s been treading is about to snap, Cas’s hands are suddenly there covering his. And those hands feel like a safety net amid the raging storm in his mind. Like a soft place to land.
Jack smiles, and his arms fall behind his back.
“Dean. Come on, man. I’m your brother, all right? You can talk to me about this.”
“I forgive you,” Cas whispers around the tears clinging stubbornly to his throat. He lets one lone tear slip down his cheek as Dean’s fingers curl into Cas’s hair.
Ragged breaths fill the kitchen as they both heave for air. Foreheads rest together as Cas drops the hand from Dean’s hair to rest it over his heart.
His forefinger is tracing the ‘y’ when he tries to hold his stiff upper lip, tries to conceal the raging inner battle from Dean.
"I am not-"
“Yeah, man, I’m just peachy. Tired from the drive is all”.
Cas nodded in agreement, thinking. “The downside is that I look like a lumberjack”
. Dean closed his eyes shut and whispered to himself “I decide to be fine ‘till the end of the week” and temptingly tried to fake a small smile.
John’s voice whipped his mind. Dean inhaled sharply.
“That’s no way of talking to your old man” Dean chastised
“I know, I know, you’re so fussy.”
“Well, I know you’re one of the teachers that take care of the Spring Fling. Erm, I was wondering if I can bring my boyfriend to the dance.”
"I'm fine."
“You don’t like the feelings?”
"I want you to know. He noticed I was off today. He kept asking if I was fine and I am sure he didn't believe my food poisoning bull. The first time we met he told me to watch my back."
Cas rolled his eyes and sighed dramatically.
"We'll need more details in court but the first emergency is drawing the paperwork and filing today while we still can. Excuse me, I'll have the interns draw up the motion."
Sam nodded, taking all in. “I do running. About 15 minutes each morning, I can’t really do more than that yet. I don’t think I can pick up fencing though. Do you think I could do yoga at home?”
"Sure, alpha. I'll make breakfast."
“Dean?”
"Another thing. There was a female omega, a staff member. She had... bad vibes."
“What?”
“Yeah like are they dark like these of baby blue?”
The silencing spells weren’t placed in the hallway and Sam heard Cas making his way to Dean’s room. Sam smiled to himself and texted Eileen: “The idjits still think I don’t know. But they are happy. I’ve never seen Dean so happy. I am happy. I miss you. Dean was thinking we should take a vacation, go to the beaches in Florida. Would you like to join us?”. Her confirmation came fast. Sam smiled to himself, wished her goodnight, and went to sleep.
“Hey, come on, Sammy. We should get up, we have to get to that Goodwill.”
"I just want to be your friend!" Creepy Guy craned his neck and eyed Sam as the young one tried to unlock the motel door. Dean sidestepped a bit.
“Cas will..”
"I’m sorry?"
“Dean.” The alpha voice broke through his blood lust haze and the omega straightened to see Cas going through the man’s laptop with a piece of duct tape and a pair of socks next to him. “We don’t want other renters talking about screams coming from here.” Cas moved towards the paedophile and scented him. “I still don’t smell fear on you. Hm. You’re resilient, but don’t...worry” - Cas growled out the next words - “I’ll scent your fear… then I’ll kill you.” With Creepy Guy weekly trying to fight him off, Cas shoved the pair of socks in the guy's mouth, gagging him, then passing duct tape over his mouth. The alpha proceeded to zip tie the guy’s arms and legs rendering the man immobile and relatively easy to carry.
“I should get back to Sam. He leaves for his trip this coming Friday, we need to do an inventory of what he has. He needs at least one new shirt.”
"Sure. And I kind of have another thing to ask about that.” Dean tried to make himself smaller, anxious about the alpha’s reaction to the request.
“Good morning, Dean. How did you sleep?”
Half an hour later, with an overflowing cart, he called Castiel. He found the angel studying pre-made sushi.
“Dean, stop being-”
"Until next Friday, Dean".
Cas wanted to say something but she hung up. Guilt washed over him, remembering Jimmy. He tried to make amends by looking after the girl in the last years. Nothing much, really, just “how are you” texts and the open line. Claire had called him several times for advice or just to vent and he’d always listened. Now she called him “dad”. Why?
“Scent takes time.”
Mr. Smith huffed and went to a nondescript box he had in his office. It was filled with clothes. He rummaged a bit and came back with a piece of clothing that had a galaxy pattern. Dean couldn't figure out exactly what it was, all bunched up in the vice principal's hand.
“I’ll try this one. It’s Dean’s favorite album, we listen to it often.”
They ended up taking quite a few, some modest, some kissing but all of them were beautiful in Dean's eyes.
“Lemon? You want lemon in your tea?”
“And your plans for the future?”
"I… I threatened him."
"Again, why?"
“Oh, it will come back” Cas’ eyes were filled with mischief and his hand grabbed Dean’s length and started pumping slowly.
Dean's cock reacted to the low voice and the delicious accent.
“Are you alright, Dean?” Cas asked softly
Dean could have sworn Claire looked disappointed before she answered. “I’m happy to see you too”
"Yeah, well I'm pretty sure it's run by the Mafia."
Sam laughed and gathered his laptop. Other than that everything was already packed. He had to wait over 45 minutes for Cas and Dean.
Cas sighed and rolled his eyes again “You are so insufferable sometimes.”
“Was that good, Dean? Did you enjoy yourself?”
“Paint the walls, change the laminate flooring, replace the bathroom sink.” Ellen read from her phone.
“Hi, alpha. I missed you”
Ellen was happy to hear from Dean and agreed to meet with Cas and the lawyer as soon as possible.
He keeps walking until he rounds the corner, and he stands in front of the door. He can’t bring himself to look at it, so he focuses his eyes on his boots instead. But he knows.
“I never prayed before you.” he settles on hoarsely. His throat is sandpaper and his tongue feels like it’s wrapped in cotton.
Dean’s eyes flutter shut and they spill over then. Two perfectly symmetrical drops, and Cas’s thumbs are there to catch them. A shuddered breath escapes Dean’s lips.
“He loves me,” Dean mutters with a low growl into the empty space around him. “He said—”
He snaps out of his trance and meets Cas’s eyes. “Hmm?”
Dean’s heart aches. He craves Cas’s presence.
“Here, drink this.” And Dean doesn’t need to be told twice. He gulps it down in three mouthfuls and squeezes the bottle flat before replacing the cap.
Cas’s legs nearly give out then. He pulls Dean into his chest, cupping the back of his head to bury Dean’s face into his neck. Dean’s arms wrap around him like a vice, and he sobs quietly into his skin.
“I dunno if you’ve noticed, but I don’t exactly deal with my crap like I should.”
“And when I got back..I-I kept seeing you everywhere. On the road, outside of motel windows. In crowded places. It wouldn’t stop. My head,” he presses his forefinger to his temple “had to remember what happened there differently because I couldn’t handle the reality.”
“Are you alright?” Cas asks, and Dean realizes that he’s been caught staring.
And then Cas takes one trepid step closer, hands stiff and unsure, and he nuzzles Dean’s jaw, nose grazing the stubble its found. His hands reach up to gently, almost hesitantly, cup Dean’s cheeks. Anchoring him to this moment, here by the water by the light of the moon under the oak tree.
Sam puts up a hand in protest and cocks an eyebrow at his older brother. “Nah, I’m good,” he says, with a breathy chuckle.
“Bend your knees, angel,” Dean coos as he presses his nose to the soft patch of dark hair below Cas’s navel, lips teasing Cas’s tip. Cas acquiesces, and then Dean licks him from base to tip before taking all of Cas into his mouth.
He thinks about Cas as he stares at the setting sun. He thinks about Hell, and how this must have been how Cas appeared to all of the wretched souls when he came to receive him: a brilliant, shining beacon; a glowing orb, gripping him tight.
It’s all the assurance Cas needs, because then his hands are gently digging into the flesh of taut muscles.
He downs the contents of his filled flask in one go. He relishes the burn, welcomes the buzz and the haze. Because this will help. It will.
“Yeah. Please, Cas—
Dean gives a knowing grin then, a breathy chuckle escaping mid-verse. It’s funny, he thinks, how much it resonated with them.
Jack’s hands rest on Dean’s shoulder blades. “I’m just fixing the mess Chuck made. All is now as it should be.”
But then he thinks about blue eyes, and something inside him shifts. Because it truly would be as easy as breathing, being with him. They’ve always had that connection, that bond, since Cas pulled him out of hell. It didn’t really begin to click in his head how Dean felt until he lost Cas in that reservoir all those years ago, but still. Maybe it wouldn’t be so much about unlearning a paradigm as it would be about learning to trust the fall.
“Listen man,” Sam starts. He waits for Dean to meet his gaze before continuing. “I know how you felt about Dad, okay? I know how much you idolized him. But, Dean…he’s gone. And he has been for a long time. You can’t let him have this control over you, you know? I know he had some really shitty ideals when we were growin’ up, but...but I’d like to think he would have eventually come around to accept it. You know?”
Dean reaches to rest one hand over Castiel’s, the other on his cheek. Dean bends to bump their foreheads together, breath stuttering in his chest, and his fingers curl into his hair.
. You ain’t a machine, Cas.”
,” he whispers thickly.
Dean licks his lips and groans at how dry everything is, and it’s like running his tongue over grains of sand. Sam reaches into his back pocket and pulls out one of those miniature water bottles and hands it to him.
Everything is fucking
“Hello, Dean,” Cas eventually says, voice heavy with something Dean can’t identify, eyes still focused on the stars above. “It’s beautiful up here.”
Whatever Dean sees in Cas’s eyes must be distressing, because he’s looking at him with such pity and sympathy and Cas feels shame creeping up his neck. He looks down at the fabric of his navy blue t-shirt, picking at an invisible piece of lint by way of distracting himself from Dean’s stare. But then he hears soft footsteps before he sees Dean’s feet approaching into his space.
“God, Cas,” Dean whimpers, head thrown back into the pillow, pulling out slowly to thrust back into the sheath.
“I knew...when I saw the pain of my betrayal on your face, that I felt something more for you than just as my charge. I knew it was something different, something more profound, because the way I felt about you versus Sam…it was different.” He glances down at his feet as he trails off.
“So fucking beautiful,” Dean murmurs as he licks a hot line up Cas’s stomach and chest, grazing over aching nipples before devouring his mouth. Cas’s hands grip both sides of his face as Dean grinds low against him again and again, cock to cock.
“You weren’t wrong,” Cas murmurs in the stillness. “I made some really poor choices over the years that put you and your family in jeopardy.”
“I come up here to think sometimes,” Dean says. “Helps us mere mortals clear the mind when you think about there bein’ a whole galaxy out there.” He takes another step closer, enough for the fabric at their sleeves to brush together. When Cas doesn’t flinch, he lets out a small sigh of relief.
“Dean?” Sam asks as he meets Dean’s stride. “What are you doing?”
Dean lifts his head to gaze upon the lake in front of him. The kaleidoscope of the sunset’s colors are reflecting on the surface now, the sun’s final rays dancing on the water.
Cas cries out as Dean thrusts again, hitting the same spot.
Cas nods, and his heart begins to hammer under Dean’s locked gaze. He feels like he should step back in the interest of
He walks the short distance before standing in front of the bar, and he’s smiling so wide and he can feel his laugh lines on his cheeks and the crinkles of his eyes.
Eileen nods. “I’m fine,” she says while signing, then gives him a pointed look. “Are you? You were out there for a while,” and then she’s looking over Dean’s shoulder to Sam, apparently not trusting the answer Dean’s about to give.
Sam reaches under Dean’s arms and starts to lift. “Come on buddy,” and Dean lets himself be half-dragged, half-pulled to his feet.
Their mouths are inches apart, and Dean’s bowed legs go a little weak as he stares into Cas’s eyes. The lighting in the bar changes to ambient, almost candle-like glow.
“It’s okay,” Dean murmurs. “It just pulls sometimes. Kind of catches when I move too fast.”
Cas nods as he presses his lips to Dean’s forehead, drawing him to his chest as the last of Dean’s resolve crumbles like concrete.
Sam sighs, this time with a hint of annoyance on the exhale that makes Dean look at him.
Rufus is there too with Aretha at one end of the bar, Johnnie Walker Blue in hand. Dean doesn’t think he’s ever seen the man smile the way he is right now, so earnestly and genuine.
It’s irrational, Dean knows, all of it’s irrational because one, Dad is dead, and two, he wouldn’t care, right? All John ever cared about was that Dean got the job done. The last time Dean saw him, John told him that he wanted him to have a family, to be happy. Surely it wouldn’t matter if it wasn’t with a woman. Right?
“I didn’t use any grace.”
Sam finds him.
“Every day after that,” he shrugs, “it was just being. Constant. It became a second skin.”
“Hey, Cas?”
“What happened?” Sam says more than asks. It’s that no-bullshit tone that Dean’s familiar with when he’s about to be interrogated. His shoulders sag as he braces for it.
Dean sighs with a shrug, and turns away from Jack to look at the moon as it begins its ascent into the ink-purple sky. The moon’s glow bouncing off the clouds makes it look like it’s surrounded by a halo.
“You’ve changed me, Dean.”
sits on the tip of his tongue, and he rolls it around a few times in his mouth. It tastes bitter, kind of like copper, before turning to dust.
“‘s fine, Cas,” Dean says, but lets himself be moved so that he’s bracing against the island. Cas reaches for the hem of Dean’s black tee, lifting it up midway to inspect the once-gaping wound in the center of his back.
“Me, too.”
Dean blows out a breath he hadn’t registered he was holding before sagging his shoulders, not realizing the amount of tension he kept in the muscles there. He twists his body to pull Jack in for another hug.
Dean nods once, straightening to rest back against his seat. The fire has died down to tiny flames licking the charred stacks of wood.
Dean reaches down between them, palming at Cas’s thinly-covered cock, hard and rigid beneath his fingers. Cas tears his mouth away to arch his back, grinding into Dean’s hand with a moan.
“It’s damn good to see you. You okay?”
Cas shakes his head. “I’m not,” he says with a scoff, more on instinct than anything else. But then Dean’s setting his jaw, eyes piercing, and Cas relents. “It doesn’t matter. You’ve already apologized. It was a long time ago, Dean.”
Jack glances down to the dirt for a fleeting moment. “I would have brought him back sooner, but —“ he meets Dean’s eyes again “—I needed his help with some things.” And Jack’s eyes flick up to the sky before sheepishly meeting Dean’s gaze again.
Sam, Eileen, and the others will be along, Bobby had said. And he feels complete peace knowing that Sam is in good hands, and that they will take care of each other until their times come.
“Hmm,” Dean agrees, eyes searching the sky for constellations he recognizes. He smiles when he finds Delphinus.
Yeah, he can get used to this.
, his voice mocks.
Dean settles for clearing his throat instead. “Hey, Cas,” he murmurs quietly.
he curses under his breath. Cas’s hand is on his bicep almost instantly.
Cas gives a rueful smile. “I think the other angels knew long before I did. Naomi certainly knew. She saw that you were the only obstacle in her mission to fully brainwash me to her side.”
Dean’s eyes go wide as his breath staunters in lungs, mouth going as dry as the Sahara in the dead of summer. His heart pounds as his ears ring, chest feeling like it’s cracking open; bursting and releasing the pressure that has been building and building there since that night. His legs turn into lead, and his feet feel like they somehow grew roots.
Dean smiles. His cheeks are warm, and something curious blossoms behind his ribs.
Almost.
Dean sighs heavily and wraps the arm draped over Castiel’s chest a little tighter, interlocks his fingers with Cas’s over his abdomen. Cas kisses his crown as Dean strokes his thumb over Cas’s, feather-light.
When his hand grasps the knob, his eyes start to sting.
His trench coat, suit jacket, and tie are all draped on the backrest of the chair, because
,” he whispers as he grinds down again.
Cas’s voice is solid as stone despite the emotion on his face. Steadfast. Reverent.
And waits.
Dean gives a small chuckle. “Yeah, well...I’m a dumbass.” And then he’s inhaling slow and deep against Cas’s skin. Cas smells like sweet summer rain, the crisp air of fall.
Whatever. He loves chick flicks.
“I mean. Cas comes back from the Empty, and you camp out in the garage for a couple hours?” He sounds more concerned than disappointed.
Dean steps back and claps Jack on the shoulder, eyes brimming with tears that he doesn’t let fall. Jack gives a small, proud smile as his eyes flicker ever so briefly above Dean’s right shoulder to the giant oak tree behind them. Dean doesn’t notice.
Pamela pats Cas on the back. “All in the past, sweetie. No harm done. Well, no permanent damage anyway,” and then tilts her head back in laughter. Dean can’t help but snicker.
He practices whenever he’s not on a hunt.
The door opens and closes. Dean keeps his eyes fixed to the floor until the devil’s trap comes into view, and then he lifts his head.
Sam pulls a face. “Dean, c’mon.” And he cocks his head to the stairs leading out of the kitchen. “He’s up on the roof.”
A breath.
“Can you walk?” he asks, and Dean only half-rolls his eyes with a grunt, shrugging out of Sam’s offered grip. He cups the back of his head again as the throbbing turns into jackhammering, and all the lights are too bright and the nausea settles in again.
“I know it’s not reciprocated,” he says with the barest hint of sadness that somehow sounds more like reassurance, “and it’s okay, Dean. It really is. You don’t need to feel obligated. You don’t need to feel guilty. I’m at peace. I’m conten—”
Maybe he is.
Dean tilts forward so that his arms rest on his knees, and gives Cas’s hand a gentle squeeze. When Cas looks up to the stars again, the flames are reflected in shining blue pools.
Cas’s legs soon begin to squirm on either side of Dean’s head and Dean reaches up his free hand to rest on Cas’s thigh, thumb brushing back and forth on his skin. Dean lets off with a wet pop, but continues to stroke Cas slowly.
, because he never thought —
Dean’s eyes scan the entire barroom from the table where he and Cas sit: at the bar, there’s Ellen, Jo, Ash, and Bobby discussing their hunting glory days, Karen at Bobby’s side. Charlie and Kevin are huddled with their laptops at one of the booths (because there’s WiFi in Heaven, apparently), and are probably discussing the latest sci-fi series or some other nerdy thing.
“Thanks, Dr. Phil,” he mutters, clapping Sam’s back before turning to climb the steps.
“What did you say?” Dean asks in the stillness. Cas’s fingers stall in their movements as Dean peers up at him.
“What? They always smell so good, man. Want a sniff?” He tilts the guitar in Sam’s direction in offering.
“Dean?”
“That’s a bit redundant,” Cas deadpans, and Dean can’t help the chuckle that escapes him as he half-nods.
He looks at Sam questioningly. “What time is it?” he croaks as he cranes his aching neck back to rest his head back against the wall.
He tries, he really does. But none of it sounds convincing at all.
. God—” he says, green eyes ablaze with ferocity. And Cas wants to argue, but then Dean is pulling him towards his chest.
Broken.
“Yeah, yeah, shh,” Dean smirks as he turns to face Cas. “Here, lemme lead.”
Castiel kisses Dean’s temple, lips ghosting the shell of his ear. “I love you so much.”
Blood surges south and Dean bites his lower lip and swallows thickly. He breathes deep and slow, and averts his eyes before Cas can catch him staring. Dean hums under his breath as he reaches to pull his shirt over his head when he lets out a groan.
He feels Dean shake his head as a finger curls underneath his chin, lifting it to meet their eyes again. Cas’s chest aches when Dean’s palm cups his cheek, grazing the stubble.
He huddles in closer with a yawn, and Cas’s fingers resume stroking his hair. His eyelids begin to feel heavy, and Cas leans over to turn the bedside lamp off.  They nestle close together in the dark, sinking deep down into the mattress and pillows.
On the exhale, he scans his eyes across the rooftop until they land on a familiar silhouette standing by the ledge. He places the object in his hand against the brick wall and steps in the direction of the ledge, letting the door clang shut behind him.
She hugs back just as fiercely, rubbing her hand up and down his back.
But in the weeks after defeating Chuck, as Dean contemplated and ruminated on the past twelve years, he saw then that Cas had been declaring his love and speaking his truth all along.
Cas lifts a hand and places it on Dean’s left shoulder. Cas’s shoulder. Dean smiles a small, watery thing.
Something occurs to Dean then, and he lifts his head to meet Cas’s eyes. His hands travel up Cas’s arms until they rest on his shoulders.
Dean’s other hand slips down the back of his pants, caressing his ass as he kisses him again. “Get these off,” he mumbles into Cas’s mouth before shoving the last barrier between them down and off his legs.
Being human sucks sometimes. He used to be able to flip on a proverbial robotic switch whenever he needed to avoid feeling, to avoid emotion, because angels were soldiers first and foremost. And because emotions were always the doorway to doubt, it was important to be able to turn them off in order to preserve the objective of the mission at hand.

Dean just shakes his head as he rolls his rotator cuff, trying to work out the crick. “Nah, nothin’. Just my shoulder. Gettin’ old.”
“Mm,” Cas hums with a nod.
Dean doesn’t stop the single tear that slips down his cheek. In lieu of words, Dean lets a shuddering sob speak for him. Cas’s grip tightens in response.
Cas takes Dean fully into his mouth then, sucking and hollowing his cheeks greedily as he bobs up and down. He licks a hot stripe down the sensitive vein underneath, and that same guttural sound tears itself from Dean’s throat again.
“Thanks,” Dean mumbles softly, and presses the cool cloth to his aching eyes with a hum, sinking into it.
There’s a pang in his gut. But also fondness.
“Hey, hey. None of that,” he says through a smile, licking his lips. “You’ve got me. You always have. And I’ve got you, so…” he smiles and presses the softest of kisses to Castiel’s mouth before resting their foreheads together.
“Bitch.”
His heart is hammering against his rib cage, and his hands begin to shake. Blood roars in his ears as he wraps his other arm around his middle and rocks back and forth.
“You’re so good, Cas,” Dean pants, closer and closer to the edge as Cas grinds on him again. He quickens the pace of his fist as Cas throws his head back.
“Don’t do that.”
The corners of Dean’s eyes crinkle as he lets out a soft hum of laughter. He angles the guitar in both hands to get a proper look at it.
And Dean is surprised at how quickly the answer falls from his lips. He blurts it out before he even has time to register the answer consciously in his mind. And that’s when it hits him, because he understands now that the truth had punched out from within his soul. The same soul that Castiel pieced back together. The same soul that has been screaming to be heard for decades.
Cas’s mouth is like silk against Dean, and Dean reaches one arm down to wrap around Castiel’s waist, a moan escaping him as Cas reaches up to tug the short hairs on Dean’s scalp.
“You’re early,” Castiel whispers.
There’s a twinge in Dean’s gut as he gazes into Cas’s eyes. They look sad bordered on pained, as if he's waiting to hear bad news that he knows is coming.
So he does.
Dean lets his eyes flutter shut as Cas’s fingers continue to lull him to sleep. He shifts to pillow his head on the angel’s chest, and silence settles softly between them.
Cas tilts his head in that fucking adorable way he does, and Dean can feel something behind his ribs melt. He stops when they are a few inches apart.
It’s a little dusty, probably been here for some time. Dean lifts the guitar so that it’s a few inches from his face and blows forcefully, flecks of dust catching in the stream of sunlight that cants through the window behind his shoulder.
“Hey, kiddo,” Dean says, and then he winces because it’s so easy to forget. He pulls away with a grimace on his face.
Cas’s hand tenses in Dean’s grasp as he sighs, thinning his lips into a shy smile. He swallows thickly, nodding once. His eyes are fixated on a spot on the floor, avoiding Dean’s stare.
“Take your sweater off, stay a while,” he quips.
“Breathe, baby,” he purrs. “Just breathe for me. Don’t want you lettin’ go just yet.”
“I doubt there are any shrinks in the know, and talking to one about my repressed… my repressed sexuality and my attraction to a bona fide Angel of the Lord with capital A is going to land me in a psych ward.”
"Do you want to go to Tolstyy Chlen tonight? Gabriel asked me to dinner." Cas put a grounding hand over Dean's.
“How did you do it?”
“3 minutes is acceptable and I do expect it to be Garth’s fault. He talks too much sometimes. Have a seat, Dean”
“Claire that was rude” Cas interjected, squinting his eyes at the young woman.
The road was shining in the morning sun, the music was happy and the interstate empty. Not many people had business on that side of the county. Dean glanced at Cas. The Angel seemed calm and happy but somehow, with each mile they got closer to Sam, Dean was increasingly more nervous.
“I did everything you asked, alpha.”
and sure enough 0.45 seconds later over 100 million results came back but nothing there helped so he switched to “
“Can I bring you my Ford Puma? It needs a check-up and an oil change but I hate going over to the auto-shop on 5th Street. Those Russians are really creepy.”
“Cas, we could have gotten back to the motel. Take a shower, steal a few hours of shuteye. Why didn’t you do this earlier?”
“My boat is free for you to take any time.”
"Is this why you gave me the keys?" Dean gripped the steering wheel tighter in frustration.
Cas snapped his fingers and was changed in a soft flannel pajama in plaid. He circled the bed and went under the covers, snuggling into Dean, leaning his head on his shoulder. He furrowed his brow at the article.
The leader’s laughter died out. He took a step back, swinging his arm to take momentum before throwing himself at Dean.
set on Sam.
Dean scoffed, rolling his eyes "I am not a piece of meat".
“We need to deal with this now.” Cas tapped the trunk.
“So, kiddo, what brings you to God’s waiting room?” Dean perked up a bit
“Ellen…”
"Uhm… you expect me to wear this?"
“I am alive, Dean” Cas answered, or at least, the creature that was wearing his likeness.
The heavy tobacco and oranges were strong so close and he relaxed, his omega settling down. The alpha purred and nuzzled the top of his head. "I am proud of you." Cas whispered very low so only Dean could hear. The omega straightened and admired Cas' face in the sunlight, finding him gorgeous.
but he didn’t touch me. He made sure I was safe.”
“Back off, man, what do you – you have no right to tell me the buns will be fine when all you can fucking taste are molecules!”
"I can't sleep, Cas. Everything smells… sterile in that room. I don't like it, it makes me feel… anxious for some reason." Dean marched towards the bed, ignoring Cas' bewildered stare, and threw himself on the bed. He lifted the covers and slid underneath, squirming to find a comfortable position. He felt instantly better enveloped in the sweet scent of his alpha and ignored the other man in bed.
“Yeah, he’s adamant about going slow, slower than I’d like to be honest. But he did kick me out of the house when I triggered his rut and honestly I am thankful for it.”
“I can do much more.”
"I'll say it the rest of my life."
Sam and Eileen were enjoying the peace and quiet. Sam rubbed his nose on Eileen’s temple.
. On his closed eyelids he saw Cas’ face, his smile, the tears in his eyes. He could hear the pounding on the door. He could see the bloody sigil. Cas’ bloody hand. He opened his eyes again staring intently at the ceiling. He glanced to his left and saw Sam asleep.
“Hello, brother,” sweet wine and sea salt hit Dean’s nose. Like the other day, his inner omega wanted to scent deeper but this time the urge was much, much more muted, barely an afterthought. The scent was pleasant and soothing but nothing more.
“I didn’t want to leave it on you, it was selfish of me to leave it there, to begin with.”
“Yes, I am, ma’am”
Crowley returned to find the three on the couch.
Cas laughed and caressed Dean’s scowling face.
“Dean, this i-”
Dean went down and kissed him on the chest on one of the eagle's heads, then he moved to the other one. He pressed kisses to the inked skin all the way to the crook of the neck nuzzling until he found the mating gland. He sucked in his mouth, rolling it between his teeth. He started grinding forcefully on Cas. The friction was too much and too little and Dean wanted more. He clamped down on the skin but with not enough force to break the skin. The alpha squirmed underneath him.
“You always pick something from lunch to take home. You work, you never mention your father or mother, you're constantly talking about
Shit. Balthazar is the next in rank so he’ll see to things and keep me updated. I need you to be
“That’s fantastic. Will you be returning to Heaven after that? How is Heaven? Is Jack alright?”
“Well, compared to Dean’s
Sam and Eileen were ahead, talking in ALS. They were too far away to make sense of what they were saying, that is if you were not an Angel of the Lord, wings and halo and all.
. Hurt Dean like that,
"Okay, I trust you, Dean." Sam curled into himself on the passenger seat and Dean reached out to pat him on the back.
In the hallway, Dean passed the two guards that manhandled him upstairs. “I’m going to need my blade back. Now.” They scrambled to give it to him. The omega plopped himself on the couch and got the e-book reader from his backpack to continue
“Now, close your eyes.”
"That was awesome, Cas. I think it was the hottest thing. I never came so hard in my pants before." Dean was still recovering from the post-orgasm bliss.
Dean's Omega was sated but still, there was something missing. He cupped the alpha's jaw and maneuvered his face until he looked Cas in the eyes. "Mark me, alpha. Make me yours."
“So, you need… one dress shirt and some jeans plus two or three more shirts, some dress shoes,” Dean checked the list they made the night before.
"Yes, sir.". Castiel hovered over him for a while.
"But…"
“I can teach you. Do you have anything you need to be done tomorrow?”
as good as pie.”
“But I do, okay? It’s my job, it’s
” Yeah, it’s nice, I guess. I like it too”
“Two hours, give or take. If I keep this pace we could be at the bunker in another nine.”
“Not these, no” Cas slumped a bit in his chair, looking distraught.
"Yeah… Gods, Cas I was so afraid of losing
He removed his fingers, whimpering at the empty feeling, desperate to have it back.
"Okay,” he turned to put the spatula down on the counter.
"May I go now?" Dean gritted out.
Dean extended his hand toward the cat but it hissed and dealt a swift, no-nonsense hit, on the omega's hand.
His dick was already filling up and he cupped himself through his sweats, hissing at the sensation. Slick was forming, dampening his boxers so Dean took the decision to get up, strip and throw a towel on the bed before climbing back on it. His phone was showing a notification and when he opened the app Cas’s alpha cock was the first thing he saw - it was fully erect and red, each vein bulging on its length - and it had Dean mouth-watering.
Dean was naked under the shower, water flowing in his head, his neck, his back, his hips, his thighs, his calves, his feet, his toes. It was washing away everything. He faintly sensed Cas climbing in. He turned and saw the naked angel standing there, watching him. They switched places, Cas getting wet under the showerhead.
"Don't be impertinent, Mr. Winchester! Mr. Smith, now!"
"Shoot."
Dean suppressed a whimper and got out of bed, finding the headphones first. “I have to get the toy out of the box first, gimme a second.”
The sun was right above them, heating up the car. Led Zeppelin was playing softly. Cas was watching the scenery change and Dean… Dean was daydreaming about getting out of the life. He pictured himself and Cas just sipping coffee on a porch somewhere, enjoying each other’s company, talking about sweet nothings. He could open a bar or maybe join a mechanic’s shop. Even Jody joked that he’d make a pretty good sheriff and Charlie did sponge their identities well enough. Why not? He didn’t have to do this forever. He was tired. A low rumbling in his stomach reminded him he had been driving for a couple of hours and it was almost noon. He took his phone out to call Sam.
Dean followed immediately with the off gait of a man sporting an almost painful hard-on.
“Yeah… sure, we’ll head out after breakfast. How does that sound Cas?”
“I can and will beat the shit out of him. And, erm, Cas is game too.”
Cas scoffed. “Dean this looks… appalling. I can get some men to paint the walls while you’re at school.”
"I know, Charles, but then again everyone has shoulders too yet you girls can't show them."
Cas and Yelena entered the room.
“You… you changed forty schools?!” The beta was gawking at the files, his mouth hanging.
I liked it when you growled at Hannah. Possessive little Omega,” he chuckled.
"I came to buy some coffee, erm… give me a minute please, it's all… a bit too much." Dean was thinking fast. What
"Really?" Sam looked up from his plate.
"No."
“Erm, Cas,” Dean rubbed the back of his neck, “did you see the price?”
“Penetrative sex, Cas. Anal sex. I want us to have anal sex. Okay? God that sounded so clinical.”
“Yes Cas, beaches. You know sand between your toes, margaritas in each hand. Oceanview, soft ukulele playing in the background. Paradise.”
“DUDE! You’re in my head? It’s not cool!”
Gabriel finished the long reply, folded the letter, and got some sealing wax. He prepared the wax and sealed the envelope shut with his own sigil ring. He handed Dean the reply.
. Why was he being punished?
“Dean.” The alpha called his name out, and Dean’s head snapped to him. “Working at Tolstyy Chlen will be a good… career move.”
“Yes?”
They were all packed in the Impala: Dean driving, Sam riding shotgun, Cas and Eileen in the back seat.
“Assbutt.”
The beta looked at him with disdain but said nothing.
“Fuck you, jerk. And yeah… next time it’s gonna be Finding Dory” Dean winked at Eileen and she responded with a smile.
"But he just said…"
“For tea? I came for a beer, man.”
"I can stay and take care of you."
“No, I’m fine, but I do know that Alastair’s dead.” The omega came closer and placed a hand on Benny's arm.
“He can join you and your friends at the Roadhouse.”
“Well, isn’t this lovely? Settling down for the white picket fence life, Mr Novak?”
The door opened and Sam walked in, sweaty and stinking up the place, making them raise their head to watch him.
“Uhm” the kid turned to his boyfriend who nodded eagerly “yeah, sure, thanks. I am Caleb, and this is Bruce” – the other kid had joined them.
"This
(See the end of the chapter for
"I know, it's… it's true
"Well, fuck you."
“I can do the repairs, ma’am. Sammy, what do you think?”
“Angelfishes. They don’t really look like us, but they are beautiful.”
Castiel seemed to ponder the change of subject but he conceded. “It was busy. The Italians are trying to carve out a piece of my territory. I have to plan retaliation. And about the true mates issues you talked earlier - I didn't know that. It is problematic to say the least."
"No, pet. I am fine", the alpha took his hands.
They remained silent again, staring each other down. Finally, Dean leaned and embraced Cas, like they used to. Dean smelled the familiar wild scent Cas always seemed to have about him. It WAS really him. He felt Cas settle in the crook of his neck. Dean leaned back but didn’t remove his hand from Cas’ back.  Their faces were just a few inches apart.
“Well...alpha said he didn’t believe in True Mates,” Dean said, averting his eyes from Becky while rolling the hem of his shirt in his hands.
“Then maybe he is not your True Mate. He shouldn’t be able to keep to himself”. Dean could see Becky was serious about this. Until Saturday he too didn’t think much about the true mates' thing beyond it being a stupid trope in romance novels and movies aimed at omegas, which he did not indulge in
An idea comes to his mind then.
A soft gust of wind caresses his skin as he lets out a yawn, exhaustion creeping in. His eyes fall to the dying fire before them.
“Cas,” he breathes through a sniffle, his thumb swiping across Cas’s cheekbone to smooth out the lone tear track. His heart aches when Cas ever so slightly leans into his touch.
“Do you know what brought it on?”
“Before the Empty came. ‘s how he summoned it.”
He can hardly breathe through the stifling sobs. They crawl their way from deep within his gut and up his throat, punching out with guttural sounds. He chokes on the grief that grips his throat in a vice.
He can’t help but bound over to her with a “hey, beautiful” spoken with direct eye contact before wrapping her in a hug and kissing her cheek.
“Sam—”
Cas seems to melt at the contact and grips Dean tighter. Dean feels fingers card through the short strands of hair and Cas’s other hand comes up to cup the back of Dean’s head.
Cas’s eyes widen ever so slightly, flickering his gaze from one green eye to the other before he shakes his head minutely, causing one of Dean’s hands to fall. The sigh he gives sounds like defeat.
Cas’s hands slowly graze the expanse of Dean’s chest, brushing over his tattoo before swirling lopsided figure-eights around his nipples, thumbs caressing them to hardness.
He buries his nose further into the crook of Dean’s neck and breathes deeply, relishing the scent of his shampoo, scotch, and simply the essence of Dean Winchester.
Cas’s thumb traces the line of Dean’s chin before carding his hand through Dean’s disheveled hair. He rocks minutely into Dean’s belly as he bores into blown forest-green eyes.
The ice cube has been reduced to a melted mess, with only a chip of it remaining. He reaches over to grab a bunch of napkins out of the dispenser and wipes his hands, then the table.
“Sleep,” Cas says with a kiss to Dean’s crown. “I’ll watch over you.”
Dean just nods mutely. Sam’s words are a grounding, gentle undercurrent to the chaos in his mind, and he takes solace in them.
Castiel sits upright, slender fingers reaching inside the bands of Dean’s pants and boxers to gently push them down over his ass and down  his bow legs, cock springing free from its constraints. Cas throws them haphazardly over his shoulder before settling on his belly in between Dean’s knees.
Dean lets out a breath, half sigh, half chuckle.
“Thank you. I am. Good, I mean.”
It’s a quiet, heavy, broken thing. It's the fall of the last of Dean’s walls as the final bricks crumble. It’s a heady revelation, a brutal truth, unearthed after years of burial and denial and avoidance.
Until then, he’ll take this. The life he’s always dreamed of but was too scared to hope for. A life of love, warmth, comfort, and peace.
He feels the stifled sob before he hears it, and he pulls back gently to search Dean’s eyes as they spill over freckled cheeks.
Dean reaches into his back pocket and takes out his folded knife. He slices his right hand open, and the sting of it is grounding, relieving. He relishes it.
So Cas does, breathing deep and slow into his belly before exhaling and grinding into Dean’s grip. Dean presses wet, open-mouthed kisses inside Cas’s thighs.
Dean tips back in his seat, almost like he’s been sucker punched, and scrubs a hand over his face. “Jesus, Cas.”
His hands reach down a perfectly sculpted back, pulling Cas’s shirt over his head before capturing his lips again. He runs his hands up Cas’s bare chest and brushes his thumbs against the tiny peaks and traces circles there.
“Should’ve said somethin’ sooner.”
He doesn’t want to; he’s scared of what he’ll find—or maybe of what he won’t find— in Castiel’s eyes. He watches as the smoke billows from the dying fire in a tiny ring in the air and disappears in the distance.
. The yearning in every bone of Dean’s body makes him crave Cas’s touch. But he won’t. Not yet.
Earth and sky.
“Yeah. Sounds like a panic attack.”
“I knew I loved you then. But it wasn’t until Naomi that I really understood the magnitude of it.”
“Hi, Dean,” she says, and he squeezes her tight before letting her go. He makes sure she’s looking at him before speaking again.
The stroke of the pads of Cas’s thumbs against his cheekbones are feather-light.
It’s pounding just as hard as his.
Dean releases a breath he hadn’t realized he’d been holding as he reaches for his beer and takes a swig. He avoids Cas’s gaze, and he hates the insecurity swirling in his gut. Hates the nerves and chagrin and the second guesses. His eyes bore holes into the ground between his feet as he rolls his beer between his palms.
“It’s healing well,” Cas confirms. He removes his hands and lets Dean’s shirt fall back down, smoothing the fabric down his sides. “How does it feel?”
He ducks his head, almost shy, and glances up at him through his eyelashes. “Castiel,” he greets with pressed lips, eyes gleaming.
“You think that’s all there is for me?” And he hates the way his voice cracks at the end.
The ice cube being pressed into his palm is not unlike a defibrillator, and it slowly begins to shrug Dean out of his reverie before he’s swallowed whole.
The wall.
Dean’s eyes well up and his nose starts to tickle. He looks up to the sky and wets his lips in that way he does to hold tears at bay, before meeting blue again.
Dean shakes his head as he leans further back, feeling the delicious hard line of Cas’s erection against his tailbone. Cas’s lips fall naturally to Dean’s neck, and he sucks a bruise into the pulse point, tongue lavishing at the salty, freckled skin.
“Of fuckin’ this up. Hurting you. Lettin’ you down. Losin’ you. Take your pick.” He draws his bottom lip between his teeth as he stares intensely at the flannel pattern of his sleep pants.
They stay like that a while: listening to each other’s breathing, the crackling of the fire, the wind blowing softly around them. Crickets chirp in the distance in tandem with the calls of mockingbirds.
is at this point. And the unknown fucking terrifies him.
Their mouths slot together perfectly; Cas’s is warm and soft and pliant, and Dean brushes his tongue against the crease of Cas’s lips, and Cas lets him in.
, and if he’s honest, Dean wants to feast his eyes a little.
“You can touch me, y’know,” he murmurs as he meets Cas’s eyes. His fingers caress the nape of Cas’s neck. “I mean...if you want. I ain’t gonna break.”
“You don’t have to say anything, Dean,” Cas offers quietly. “I don’t expect-”
He cries. For the first time since that day, he lets himself crumble under the enormousness of his grief.
Sam’s face is contorted into something pitiful and concerned, puppy dog eyes on full display. He moves the hand that was on his elbow to the side of Dean’s face, trying to help him focus.
“I have to go,” comes the voice from behind them, and Dean whirls around to face Jack, one hand falling to his thigh and the other resting on Cas’s shoulder.
Dean groans a primal, guttural sound, rolling his eyes into the back of his head at the feel of Cas’s mouth on him: warm and slick and velvet. And he swears he’s never been more aroused in his life.
“Yeah?”
How does he unlearn that? How does he essentially retrain or re-wire everything he’s ever known when it comes to this?
Cas’s hand falls on his knee with a squeeze.
“I think that can be arranged.”
When Cas doesn’t respond (which is an answer in itself, Dean supposes) he licks his lips and wrings his hands. Something to do, something to
“I think he was just trying to show off in front of his boyfriend,” Pamela says with a laugh as Missouri drops her face in one hand.
Sam’s eyebrows shoot up just a tick before settling back down.
He feels his face cracking from smiling so wide, and he feels his eyes stinging with tears behind them. He faces Cas fully now, hands shoved into his pockets, and begins to walk towards him.
Dean doesn’t try to conceal the chortle that escapes his chest, and lets Cas’s assurance seep into the marrow of his bones and flow through his veins.
It’s a twenty-mile trek from the lake to the bunker, and the only sound passing through the car is the wind blowing through open windows. Neither of them have spoken a word since Dean led them silently to the Impala.
He waits for the burn to settle into his belly before he starts.
Dean cocks his head with a raised eyebrow. “What?”
“Thanks, Doc,” he mumbles, and Dean can see Sam rolling his eyes without even looking.
Horror flashes across the angel’s face. “Dean, no. I’m a terrible dancer. I couldn’t-”
They sway somewhat in tune with the rhythm, but Dean’s a little wine drunk and accidentally  steps on Cas’s toes. More than once.
“Sorry,” Dean giggles—
He glances sideways, not moving his head, to look at Cas.
Castiel sighs heavily as he licks his lips and swallows. “And then with everything that happened in Purgatory...hearing your prayers every night, and needing to do everything in my power to keep you safe—”
Heaven is strange, he thinks. He feels no sense of unease here. No nerves, no jitters. He only feels contentment. Peace. Joy.
It feels like grace.
Cas sits silently in the passenger seat, still as stone.  Dean only allows himself to glance at Cas in his peripheral vision, eyes never actually leaving the road.
“Thank you,” Dean grits out around the tears lodged in his throat.
, Cas.
Dean smiles, shifting to press his nose against Cas’s jaw. He smells like woodsmoke and earth before a storm. “Thanks.”
Dean clasps his hands together in his lap, picking at the label on his beer with a heavy sigh.
Except Dean doesn’t even know what
, the sickening voice in his head sings.
“You okay?” Dean questions, eyes narrowed and lips pulled taut in a straight line. He feels his Adam’s apple bob as he swallows and wets his lips. “I mean, did the Empty —”
“You know I didn’t mean it, right?” Dean says one night.
“Okay.”
Cas smiles again, and Dean thinks he’ll never ever tire of seeing it.
One lone tear breaks free from the corner of Dean’s eye, and Cas’s thumb is there to catch it as he sweeps it over his cheekbone before cupping his jaw.
Dean’s cock throbs beneath him, and that familiar pang of need grips him again.
