Bela ground against Dean, who tried hard to forget about Cas' expression in the photo he'd tried to rip up and throw out. Which he hadn't been able to bring himself to do. Bela's lips were hard and smooth on his. Demanding, bossy. He wished for a moment that they were chapped and hesitant instead. Goddammit. He threw himself into kissing her back but knew he was soft in his jeans, even when he slipped his hand up her shirt and underneath her bra, dislodging the stolen bills, even with her hot breath against his neck. She ran her hands down to his pants and discovered soft, pliant warmth.
They went to the Chinese takeout place that Dean frequented when too tired to cook and ordered a medley of different meaty dishes with varying sauces. Cas WOULD get the one that mixed pork and pineapple. Dean shook his head and pulled out his wallet to pay. Cas raised his hand to stop Dean and brought out his own wallet. (Sort of. It was an old one of Sam's.)
'Hello, Dean.'
Dean mouthed back, and pointed to the driveway.
Cas smiles. 'Yes. It's the main ingredient in glass.'
'So...you're in...what are you doing there?'
'So we're looking for a Japanese monster that lives in mountain caves.' Sam announced it like a drill sergeant and began to search eagerly through the pile of books.
'Well, it's true.'
Dean practically bubbled over with delight. He was going to tease Sam about this forever. “Thanks!” He called out at Sam's retreating back. “How much of a discount did you get, lover boy?” He wolf-whistled and Sam flipped him the bird. Dean laughed.
'What is it like when you're young and stupid?' Dean is watching Cas, who answers absentmindedly while steering out of the parking lot.
“In here. Fixing the fridge.”
Dean withdrew the bottle and took a sip. 'Not quite. Getting there, though. Want some?'
'Everyone from over there is evacuating.'
“Morning, Mrs. McGuirk.”
Dean shook his head and mimed it taking off.
He remembered the thick carpet, the pile of toys, the bright strange house. Someone else's dad. The thought of a napping baby. Jumping into piles of pillows, dreaming about outer space.
“On it.”
Dean won't go there, he won't. He can't catch his breath. He looks around, but there's nothing to distract him. He exhales and rubs his leg with his free hand. He sees hospital tile. He can smell the disinfectant. He throws back the rest of his whiskey and his throat aches. Windows shattering. Metal groaning. His father's head snapping back. He squeezes his eyes shut. He needs a recipe, something to do. Beat two eggs. Mix in oil and milk. Beat until it's smooth. Whisk in brown sugar.
'Hi, Cas! Merry Christmas! What's all that?'
'I have a few sticks of dynamite left, and a load of fireworks. It IS the 4th of July coming up, after all. We would be setting a fine example for patriots across the nation if we combined them into one big blowout.'
'Do you? The others usually have experience in hotels before they come here. But I don't think you do.'
'Magazine?'
Dean squinted at Sam, then cocked his head and walked into his room. 'Yeah, well, there you go.' He closed the door.
When John got home, he barely spoke except to tell Sam to pack his suitcase. Sam watched the muscle in his dad's jaw twitch as they folded clothes and put Sam's toothbrush into a plastic bag. Fury radiated from John like a noxious cloud. Sam was too awed to say anything into the thrumming silence, so it lay between them for the whole drive. Sam didn't remember nodding off, but he must have.
'You sure you're okay to take him? I could come along...'
'No, no. Just...I'm gonna sit for a minute.'
'What changed?' He said it quietly in the still air of the empty room, half-expecting an answer to come to him in echoes.
'So Jody thinks she found us a job. Three people killed in a town in Colorado in the last week. Houses locked, no sign of forced entry, and all the vics were missing organs.'
'It's kind of a matter of convenience.'
“Maybe Gabe has a friend he could set you up with?”
Dean tried to tug loose, tasting panic. 'What do you want from me?!' He didn't know what he was saying. He knew he wasn't making sense, but Cas seemed to understand.
Dean's eyes bulged. 'YOU put this here?'
Dean felt a thrill of curiosity. Cas brought his sketchbook everywhere. It was a permanent fixture like Cas' stupid baggy coat or his perpetually-messy hair. Despite that, Dean had never seen any of it. 'Yeah. I do.'
4th of July, 1996
The metal clanging of the kitchen usually drives all other thoughts from his head but now the noise reverberates through his bones, making him grit his teeth. He thinks of windshields shattering. His father's head snapping back. A seat belt tightens against his windpipe. He feels like he's choking. The kitchen air feels thin.
Castiel smiled back. “Can't complain. Would you like a pastry?” He offered Inias the half-full bag.
Against all odds, Birch Ridge made it to the modern age with a population of about 10,000 people who all lived lives as close to normal as the town could allow. Birch Ridge had a bank, bars, grocery stores, cafés, a post office, and a bus stop. Just like any other town. And, just like any other town, secrets.
'He can't hear a damn thing,' Crowley whispered.
Dean knew Cas wouldn't judge him. 'Yeah. I did. Even though I sounded more like a kids show than a Led Zep tour.'
“He'll be fine.”
Cas had leveled a heavy look at Dean. 'A magazine.'
'Thank you, but there's nothing to tell.' Dean scrutinizes him as they walk to the car but doesn't push it. Everyone has things they don't want to think about, places in their minds they never want to go. Cas gives him an exhausted smile and climbs into the passenger seat.
Three minutes and twenty seven seconds later he walked to his car armed with his comically large all-weather coat, keys, wallet, and lust for baked goods. The old trees cracking the sidewalks all down his street stood serenely above the scene. The windows reflected the early morning light through panes dewy with condensation. Castiel closed the car door as gently as he could and, as always, prayed vaguely in some upward direction while he turned the key in the ignition. The engine sputtered twice, rattled, caught. “Another point in favour of a higher power,” he muttered waspishly, and stared pointedly at the dashboard. The car rattled as he manoeuvred out of the driveway and down the residential street, eyes catching briefly on the 'SOLD' sign next door. He'd been meaning to ask his neighbour, Mrs. McGuirk, about who would be moving in to her former place.
'No thanks, Mr. Winchester.'
'No chance of getting a hokey section on fortune-telling past the advisor. I might mention it in passing though.'
But Sam just keeps raising his voice, he's almost shouting now. “ – and after all the shit he's been through for us he deserves better than that from you.” Cas is flabbergasted by Sam's ideas on the subject, but also that Dean is allowing Sam to speak to him in that way, at that volume.
School began again, and Dean didn't founder as expected. Benny's help had paid off. After the first week the three of them - Dean, Cas, and Benny - fell into a routine. Dean and Benny emerged from their homeroom and got caught in the stream of students in the hall. They were carried along the hallway to where they met Cas, as usual, whose homeroom was a few doors down from theirs.
Dean turns, jaw set, gesturing at the blackened trays. 'I burned the damn breakfast.' A hot spike of anger rises in his throat. He feels like kicking himself.
Maybe, he thought, his limbs were so heavy because of all the work he and Jimmy had done that day – splitting logs, climbing into dumpsters, hiding in a crawlspace when the owners of the house they were breaking into came back unexpectedly – The Family had many jobs that needed to be done, and some roles could only be played by children. No one questioned children when they were somewhere they weren't supposed to be, and if a child was caught stealing or breaking in they were usually given a sharp warning rather than a jail sentence. Even these thoughts came to his mind sluggishly, fighting against a tide of unnatural exhaustion.
'Jess' parents invited you, too, Dean, if you want to come? Can we go?'
Dean downs his shot. 'Besides, I'm here to visit with my little bro.' Sam looks so disappointed that Dean adds, 'Okay, fine. Maybe there's someone at work.'
'Dean's told me a lot about you in the last ten minutes.'
'I know.'
Sam stared, trying to make Dean out in the mass of students. He looked for Dean's leather jacket. There. Next to Crowley, Bela, and some pale-faced girl with long black hair that Sam didn't recognize. They were laughing and jostling one another. Sam relaxed.
Mrs. McGuirk smiled. “Thank you! I had a few offers from stuffy retirees but it's going to two brothers, quite young actually. You'll like them!” She planted proud hands on well-fed hips.
Hyun-Sook tapped her nose and winked at him. “The girl scouts didn't do a huge amount for me but it sure taught me all I needed to know about knots. Anyway, I'll leave you boys to get settled in. My number is on the fridge if you need anything, and you can always just knock on Castiel's door, he knows this place like the back of his hand.”
'Shut up,' Cas grumbled. 'Did you just come over with your little dog to steal Christmas or are you going to come in and say hi to everyone?'
Sam stares disbelievingly. 'How are you still eating?'
'What? No.' Cas looks startled at Dean's frank question.
'So how come you stopped?'
Cas smiles and pushes Dean back a bit. 'You're working, you know. I'll save it for later. Besides. This is not hygienic.'
'No! Not at all.' Cas slumps against a counter and sort of deflates. 'I'm sorry.' He runs a hand through his hair and chews his bottom lip. He opens his mouth and closes it again, then says, 'It's not you, not at all. I've been out of sorts.'
Cas must have looked unimpressed, because Dean was biting back a smile. 'How will I know...if the card is right?'
'Where's Jess?'
'You told me to read a magazine during your road trip to Nevada. So I went out and got one.'
Dean shrugs uncomfortably, then laughs. 'That babe in Daytona.'
He twisted around to face his niece. “Who's ready to make dinner?!”
'Oh, great.' Dean grouched. 'A monster with a healthy appetite.'
Cas' face darkens. 'Like I said. Long story. I had to leave everything behind when I moved.'
'It's not very ethical,' Cas – Castiel – finally says. 'Throwing out everything that isn't perfect? It's unfair.'
“And he looks thinner.”
'What?' Dean asked, annoyed.
'So you've never thought about it?'
Dean and Cas learned Morse code after the salvaged Christmas. Dean needed to keep his mind occupied. Yeah, he knew it was dorky, but Cas was so excited about it. And really, he eventually thought, it was kinda cool knowing a secret language that no one else around them did. It took forever to get a message across but that just meant that they never wasted words. Learning Morse code with Cas showed Dean how to cut out everything unnecessary and boil it down to what he really meant. Clear. Simple. Concentrated.
Dean holds his palm up as well. 'Yeah, yours are more impressive. I'd give them a 6 out of 10.'
When their first date drew to a close, Cas found himself pressed up against the door frame. Dean's hands were hot on Cas' hips, his lips tasted like the lemon sorbet they'd had for dessert, and his stubble felt exactly like Cas had imagined it would. It was hard to kiss properly while smiling like idiots but they managed it somehow. If this was the result of getting your fortune told, Cas was ready to sign up as a full-on believer. Black cats, magic wands, smoke and mirrors, the lot.
'Good to see you, John. How you holding up?'
Dean chuckles. 'Full of diapers? Covered in crumbs and extra towels? That doesn't sound bad, as far as apocalypses go.'
John finally broke the silence. 'C'mon, Sammy. You're going to stay with your Uncle Bobby for a little while until I can get this mess straightened out.' He must've seen something in Sam's no-longer-sleepy expression because his voice softened as he added, 'Dean's okay. And this will all blow over soon. I promise.'
'Cas thinks his job is more fun than ours.'
'Anytime.' Dean pauses. 'Really. I mean that. Uh, do you need anything else?'
'Starting your own business? It takes a hell of a lot of money and hard work to even begin.'
The next day, although a certain frostiness hung between them, Dean and Bela didn't talk about it. Crowley looked curious but something in their expressions must have stopped him from asking. It took every ounce of Dean's self-control not to look for Cas in the halls. He was jumpy and kept his eyes down. He was ready at any moment to leap around a corner or through a classroom door if he saw Cas. He didn't. He wasn't sure if it was because he was averting his eyes from everything except the floor or because Cas wasn't there. Dean supposed Cas could have just been there on Monday to register for the next school year.
'Well, what would
Aaron nods, looking only slightly disappointed. 'No prob. Hey, give me a call if you change your mind.' He winks and scribbles his number on a nearby beermat, then leaves with a smile. Dean smiles back, and Sam comes over, sweaty and swaying slightly.
Dean can't tell which is louder, the music or the conversation. The bartenders are buzzing around with laughter and smiles and hands full of drinks, and the atmosphere is more upbeat than Dean ever thought it could be in a bar. The chalkboard menu advertises the $2 shot of the night: Blow Jobs. Dean nudges Sam, points at the billboard, and sniggers. He doesn't even have to look at Sam to know his response is bitchface #9 (You're So Immature). He follows Sam, who is wading through the crowd like the enormous moose he is, heading toward the back, where a few scruffy girls and guys in novelty tees that say things like ' √(-1)  2(3)  ∑  π ...and it was delicious!' are setting up amps and guitars. They greet Sam warmly and shake Dean's hand.
He got a half-cocked grin in return. 'You were hoping for crystal balls and wizard hats, maybe?'
'What do you like about baking?'
The night before Valentine's Day, Sam asked Dean for help and Dean swallowed his cynicism long enough to help Sam make an unfolding origami heart out of construction paper. If Sam ignored the smell of tobacco and the edge to Dean's laugh, he could almost imagine that it was the old Dean, the one who had laughed easily and hugged people more.
'I don't think so. It wasn't making her hallucinate, it was just...psychic.'
he thinks.
Cas sucked in a breath through his teeth. 'I'm so sorry.'
'With coffee that black you'd be lucky to see my evening, let alone years into the future.'
'No, thanks. I'll see what's on TV. Marathon day?'
Dean steps into Cas' space. 'So what kind of congratulations-you-didn't-kill-anyone present are you going to give me?'
Cas glances at Dean. 'You miss him.'
'Yes.'
Dean was shaking. He fumbled for an answer. Crowley's eyes narrowed as he looked across the pitch. 'Oh, look.' His tone was sardonic. 'Dean's lover-boy is back.'
Dean nods emphatically, mouth full of sandwich. When the women all settle grimly with their plates, they don't chat like the kitchen crew. Dean looks them over and a tousled mop of black hair catches his eye. It's the new guy, Cas. Castiel. Dean can't help but think that he looks out of place sitting there. He must know the owner. Michael may be a dick, but even he has his soft spots. And Dean has to admit that if those wide blue eyes didn't do the trick, nothing would. Castiel's picking at his food while his neighbours dig in, and keeping his eyes down. Why isn't he eating? Isn't he hungry?
“Five minutes til bedtime, small bean,” he told her.
'You won't be. Stay.' Dean walks back in without giving Cas time to answer.
'I just thought...I thought you'd be happy to see him, that's all. You guys must've missed each other.'
'Did you like it?'
'Hey, Cas, you have your snacks? You be good and listen to Mr. Winchester, okay?'
“With chili.”
Cas swallows his mouthful. 'Not too bad. Although there was a family of five. I'm told that in a hotel that's equivalent to the apocalypse.'
'I live here, Dean, and I'm not deaf.'
They have a rare day of quiet. No cases crop up, no calls come through, nothing happens. Sam and Dean stay in their rooms until almost noon, so Cas wanders through the different rooms of the bunker and tries to take stock. He finds a stained wooden trunk that he can't open, several untitled spell books with handwritten notes in the margins, a box of beautifully carved bullets, and more than a few spiderwebs. He's walking back to his room to figure out what the bullets are for when he walks into Dean, wet from the shower and wearing only a towel. He tries not to look too closely but that sheer expanse of skin seems to be drawing his eyes as if by magnetic force.
The house felt too big to Sam. It was quiet and dark without their dad. When the weak snow-day sun went down and evening stretched over the house, the silence seemed to lengthen and he felt as if he and Dean were stuck, immovable, suspended in amber, waiting for something to come home and take off its leather jacket and make Rice Krispie squares like always.
'Dean Winchester, are you coddling me?'
'She would say that.' Dean kicks off his blanket. 'But let's avoid the whole mama-bird thing. I'm starving.'
The loud blaring ship horn in Sam's dream became raised voices on the stairs. A low sound. A long pause. Sam's eyes grew heavy. Then, 'Don't you walk away from me, Dean! Dean!' Sam heard Dean's door close. He rolled over, too sleepy to try to understand, only able to register the tension. His eyelids grew heavy again and his eyes felt sore, so he closed them. He drifted off on clouds of blackness only to be startled awake again by lights on his wall. His heart sang. Cas must be back! Cas, back with his flashlight to push bravely on through the dark of Dean's defenses armed with baby pictures, codes, secrets! The light receded and an engine growled. Sam blinked himself awake. The lights were white, not yellow. Headlights. He heard their car drive off down the street.
Cas is startled by this. Why is that important? His appetite has lessened, it's true. And he likes the feeling of being half-empty. It keeps him from staring at Dean. It keeps him present. It's hard to wish for his old life or a perfect self when his stomach is growling. The hunger is as mindless and weightless as meditation. He waits for Dean to reply but there's only a tense silence.
'Stop messing around and pose.'
Dean shrugged.
Cas kept his jaw from dropping, but just barely.
'So.' Crowley flicked ash to the grass. 'Judging by the mincemeat she's made of your neck, I'd say we can expect an announcement from you and Bela any day now.'
Castiel rolled his eyes. “What is he like?”
“No, I mean...he has dark circles under his eyes.”
'Who's laughing?' Dean thought his ribs might snap from the effort of holding back. Cas looked at him with a flat, nonplussed expression which contrasted his sweater perfectly.  'You look great. Really brings out the color in your eyes.'
It took them just over half an hour to find the crooked little side street which, according to Anna, housed a legitimate psychic. Or whatever you're supposed to call those new-age quacks. Cas stared up at the nondescript sign above the door as Anna stepped inside. 'Winchesters' it simply said, in plain lettering. Cas didn't know what he'd been expecting, but it wasn't this perfectly ordinary hallway. More smoke and mirrors? Candles and cats and patchouli? Instead he was faced with plain painted walls and clean floorboards leading to what looked like a standard sitting room.
Sam put the phone back down and walked into the kitchen. He found a can of soup and emptied it into a bowl, put it in the microwave.
Dean picked up the box, neck still sore and red. 'Alright, Picasso, just help me think of a place to ditch the dynamite. Unless you want it.'
Dean stood very, very still and looked at the sketch of himself. He was slouching in a chair and his legs were spread out, his arms were relaxed. He was smiling faintly, his eyes hitched up a little, his mouth quirked. Dean flipped backwards, just to see what else was there, and found himself again, hunched over the desk in his room, brow furrowed. Dean guessed he had been doing homework at the time. Heart pounding now, he kept flipping, backwards and forwards. Here was one of Dean in class, chewing a pen. Cas had captured the unfocused look in Dean's eyes perfectly. There was one more of Dean, a few pages after the sketch of him in the chair. It was just Dean's face, and Cas had painted in every last detail. Dean might have been looking in a mirror, except the Dean Cas had painted was light, breezy. Exuberant. Dean looked up from the sketch, dazed, and met his reflection's eyes for the third time that night. The Dean that stared back at him was...clenched muscle. Boundaries. Blood.
This is the worst it gets for Dean, promise. It's the rock-bottom bit, and it all goes up from here. =]
'C'mon, Dean, spill!'
He remembered a small tent by the train tracks, Sam's laughter, a series of knotted ropes and camping stoves and sleeping bags.
'Yeah! We can go see the apes, right? Cas has never seen one!' and with that he turned back to Castiel to resume their conversation as they clambered in and buckled their seatbelts. In his excitement, Sam threw his small stuffed toy at Dean, who patiently picked it up and handed it back.
him, Dean reminds himself, and he can breathe again. Nobody will ever understand how hard it was to see Sam off to Stanford, watching him disappear from Dean's homebound life like a pair of headlights at night. Dean still didn't know how he felt about it. When Sam left, Dean felt emptied out. He had no more enormous responsibility hanging over him, he didn't have a mouth to feed depending on him anymore, but he didn't have any purpose either. So he cooked. And cooked. And cooked. And had no one to feed but himself, which was how he became a chef.
“Because if you're not, what the fuck were you doing on Valentine's Day.” It's a statement, not a question. Cas begins to dread where this is going.
Dean's throat is doing something strange (Happy or sad? Dean can't tell.) and he can't quite speak for a moment. 'Come in,' he finally chokes out, and Cas steps inside. He kicks the door closed behind him and looks at Dean.
'Har har, blondie.' Dean stands up, gathering his cutlery onto the tray. He walks back to the main kitchen area, nodding at the table full of disgruntled maids as he passes. He watches Cas – CASTIEL, Dean, for fuck's sake – and Castiel doesn't look up.
'In his own way. Maybe too honest. There are some things parents shouldn't put on their kids. I kinda wish he'd lied more.'
4th of July, 1996
, he thought.
“...and that's why I'll never go to Tahiti again,” Hyun-Sook finished.
Castiel, following Inias back to the main building, groaned. “I keep telling them, it's just...just tea!”
'Anything, as long as it gets me out of cleaning this fridge. Remember Meg, who used to work here? Brought all that fruit for lunch?'
Castiel waved his hands in an 'I know, I know' gesture. “I didn't have time to make food. Any croissants today?”
Sam never thought he'd see Dean look mortified, but there's always a first.
“C'mon, for real.” Sam backed around the corner of the door and nearly fell over an excited Bones running back and forth behind him. Despite this, they managed to get the mattress into the room.
Tacos and burgers and all other kinds of fast food tasted so. Much. Better. When they weren't – well – fast. When Dean took the time to cobble it all together himself.
'I need a pump for my stomach is what I need.'
'We're looking for the homeless shelter.'
Cas' presence had the added bonus of softening Dean's rough edges. When their dad would go on one of his long-haul trips, Dean would stop smiling. He'd become tense and his sense of humor would dry up into something more biting and sarcastic. Sam worried when Dean bristled. He clung to the house, keeping his distance from Dean but not willing to let him out of sight, just in case. Having Cas around as a buffer took the edge off. It was as if he filled a gap in their family, a gap that Dean constantly tried to patch up. Castiel could spend a day dealing with Dean's insecure prickliness and remain completely unruffled, could even manage to look at Dean with something halfway between exasperation and fondness. Even then, it was hard for Sam when John wasn't there. As soon as their dad would pull up in the driveway, Dean would relax into silliness and start goofing off again. Sam's favorite part of dad being home was the feeling of freedom that came with the change in Dean's mood.
, Cas' mind repeats.
'I'll pick you up at six. Now. What food do you have in this place, short stuff? You look too hobbled to feed yourself.'
'Yeah. Right.'
Cas finally turned around and for a second Sam thought he saw a wince of pain. 'I would, but he's never around.'
She smiled at him. The last trace of Sam's disappointment melted. 'Yeah, I'm sure. My parents really like you.'
Dean smiled so he wouldn't cringe. He went up to his room and paced through the squares of early evening sun on the floor. He picked up a book, put it back down. Opened a notebook, closed it. He felt too restless to relax and too flustered to actually do anything. He stood still and closed his eyes. When he opened them, he looked out the window and saw Cas standing there across the way, in his room, looking in at Dean. There was an expression in Cas' eyes that Dean had never seen before. He looked helpless. Hopeless. Lost. In a bad way. The flip side of how Dean had felt when Cas had kissed him all those months ago. And that scared Dean much more than it should have. It lasted for a split second. As soon as Dean made eye contact, Cas looked away and walked from the room, his posture rigid. Left Dean shaking. Like always.
Dean shook his head. 'Nah, I like it. It's good to know that it can be like that.'
Dean and Cas, chatting and ribbing each other, work together to bring in a lot of equipment that, frankly, mystifies Dean. There are a lot of long metal rods and bags of what looks like sand. Sweat dripping between his shoulder blades, Dean bends over to grab a mid-size machine that looks like a kiln. Before he can lift it, Cas appears and hoists the other end. 'Got it?'
Bobby emerges from the house, pulling on his ratty old cap.
Dean, uncomfortable with his own feelings of mild pity and with Cas' unsettling lack of direction, had rolled his eyes and lifted his hands in a half-shrug. 'I dunno, Cas, strap on your wings and go see Rio. Catch up on some sleep. Read a magazine.'
He opened his eyes when Dean pushed on his hip a little to get him to lie on his back. His pupils huge and liquid black, like tunnels under the earth. Dean marveled with his hands and his mouth. He kissed the warm skin of Cas' hips, stroked the downy expanse of his sides, below his ribs. Cas arched up beneath him, biting his lower lip. Dean moved up to curl over Cas and kiss him. He popped the button of Cas' jeans and slid them down a little as Cas raised his hips.
'Keep it down,' Dean hissed. 'You want everyone in the neighborhood staring?'
Cas glared at them as they walked on down the hall, his eyes burning. 'Idiots.'
'Calm down. I don't even know him.' He waves his hand dismissively.
'Sure. Thanks, Cas. ...without you and Benny. ...breakfast?'
'Hah. Thanks, Sammy, but no thanks.'
Anna looked even more confused. 'Really?'
Hyun-Sook looked personally offended. “That's pretty rude.”
'Huh?'
“Beer for dinner, Dean?” Sam purses his lips but his eyes are soft. Cas can tell he doesn't want to cook either. Cas collapses into a chair, beyond caring about the state of his clothes or the bruises he can feel now that the action is behind them. Sam and Dean walk heavily up the steps to the table and Dean pushes a beer over to Cas as he sits down. He claps Cas on the shoulder.
They didn't say much as they walked down the block, content to let their breath freeze in the night air and listen to the sound of their boots in the snow and the far-off singing voices. The light from the moon, the brightness of the snow, and the winking colored Christmas lights made the night feel less lonely. Dean's face was thoughtful in the glow of it.
Dean smiles most of the time now. Kevin and Chuck are astonished, Jo is happy for him. Dean's days are softer, somehow, easier, and Cas spends a lot of time learning to cook at Dean's house after work. Cas says living with Michael until he gets back on his feet is not so much a lucky break as it is incentive to get his own place ASAP. He never stays over at Dean's and Dean never minds. It's enough that Cas is there, that Dean is able to discover him, one conversation at a time. They talk at work, in pubs after work, in coffee shops, on weekend trips around town trying to find someplace cheap enough for Cas to rent. Dean teaches Cas how to cook and makes him listen to Led Zeppelin. Cas tells Dean about books he likes and different places he's traveled to. They haven't kissed since the first time. Dean wistfully wonders why, but he doesn't ask. Aside from the constant urge to press himself into the other man and lick his chapped lips, Dean enjoys their time together the way he enjoys croissookies; he craves them, he loses himself in their flavour, he expects nothing more of them. Perk: Cas probably won't kill him with diabetes. Sam notices Dean's happiness over the phone, but he doesn't ask. Dean can hear a smile in Sam's voice after Dean mentions that Cas found a place to live; a tiny flat on top of an empty shop that Cas can use as studio space as soon as his equipment gets shipped over. Dean and Cas exchange numbers and text a lot. Dean sends Cas shitty pictures taken on his phone and bad puns and Cas sends back strings of emoticons and dry comments. Dean sets his notification tone to the sting from the old Batman series, and every time Cas texts him he chuckles.
Dean leaves Jo standing slit-eyed and hunchbacked over the coffeepot to brush his teeth, and she's dressed and caffeinated by the time he gets back.
Cas fixes him with a wide-open stare. 'I was trying not to complicate things.' There's a pause. 'I would love to come over for a drink.'
'...I guess...I don't have to think about baking. I just have to follow the recipe, and if I do it correctly, everything works out. And at the end of it, you have something that other people enjoy. Something that makes them happy, something that lives up to their expectations. I don't know. What do you like about...glass...blowing?'
Dean does a double-take. 'What?'
'And we brought pie,' adds Cas, smiling.
'Hello again,' he smiled, and Cas did a double take. The man was gorgeous, and that was putting it mildly. Happily crinkling green eyes and freckles and broad shoulders. Jeans and a wrinkled blue shirt. He looked more like an off-duty cop than a psychic. He spoke again. 'I didn't expect to see you back so soon.'
'Is that what you're after?' Dean folded himself into a well-worn couch, and indicated that Cas should do the same. Cas sat down.
Cas tried again. He took a deep breath and tried to force himself out of hysteria. 'I would love to go to dinner with you.' He held his breath to avoid laughing.
Sam gapes. 'I knew it!'
'Oh, don't be such a wuss. Think about it, Dean. What about drowning?'
Sam's door opens and he sticks his head out. Dean smirks. “It's like a summoning spell. Mention food and POOF! a leech appears.”
She tucked the money into her bra and walked over, her dangerously sinuous movements reminding Dean of the copperhead John had killed in their backyard a few years ago. It had emerged from underneath the front steps in the spring and Dean had watched its slick brown bulk winding like a stream across the grass. At first John had thought it was a rat snake, but then it had turned its head and revealed vertical pupils like a cat's. Dean knew he couldn't have, but in his mind he had seen himself reflected twice in the predator's flat eyes. John had beheaded the snake with one swift blow of the garden shovel.
“We finally got her that
'Isn't that your brother's car?' Jess gestured at the Impala parked across the street.
'Economical, Dean, not like dad's gas-guzzler.' He unlocks his sleek little hatchback with an ostentatious beeping noise that makes Dean grind his teeth. Sam grins at Dean's irritation. Dean rolls his eyes and settles into the passenger seat with distaste, eyeing the iPod dock. Augh, seriously, Sam? Seriously? Sam hits the power button with pride, so Dean doesn't say anything.
Dean closes his eyes and leans his head back. 'Dad's car accident. I distracted him. Wrong place, wrong time kinda thing. If I had been driving, it would've been me instead.' He keeps his eyes closed, as if the darkness was a safety blanket. 'I'm a bad luck charm, Cas.'
'Not you, hon, you get to go watch bad TV while we make you some dinner.'
Cas gave him a withering look. 'You think blowing up someone's stuff with dynamite is perfectly reasonable?'
'It's female.'
Over the years the town grew outward in spokes. Unplanned, chaotic, its roads crooked and curving around parts of the forest. The people of the area had babies who grew up and had babies of their own. Other towns sprang up in the surrounding areas, and grew, and befriended Birch Ridge distantly, the way children do when they learn to use friendship as a tool. The town kept its mysteries even as it evolved, even as its people built the community from the ground up.
“I was going to try and figure that out.”
“Hey Cas. What's that?” Dean leans over to see into the box and water from his hair drips onto Cas' hands. "Nice. What are they for?”
'Don't! Don't leave.'
Dean nodded. 'Seriously, I couldn't.'
Uncle Bobby was the last person Sam said goodbye to. He leaned over and smothered Sam in a huge whiskery embrace. Sam squeezed and hung on for a long moment before Uncle Bobby stepped back and handed Sam a slip of paper.
Dean heard Bones rattling the treats around in a valiant effort to free them, and then heard a different kind of rattling. He frowned and followed the noise the fridge, which was chuntering and whirring. He put his hand out to open the door and suddenly knew, as if he could see with x-ray vision, that something was blocking the compressor fan. He snatched his hand back from the fridge, disoriented. The fridge made the noise again. Dean tried to ignore the strangeness of that intrusive thought and pulled the fridge forward to unplug it and get at the rear access panel.
SPREADING
Dean nods and stands, brushing off his jeans, and Cas follows suit.
'What? I'm venting!' Dean wagged his finger at Cas. 'Which...is healthy.'
As soon as their dad would get home, Sam's mind would feel lighter and he'd run out of the house to play crocodile in the long grass by the park with Jess and the rest of them. On one particular day the sun was bright, the air was crisp, and Sam was the crocodile. He loved the feeling of the long grass brushing against him. He felt like an explorer, like the grass became some untouched jungle that existed for him to discover. He never felt alone; he could always hear the shouts and laughter of his friends. He stood stock still and closed his eyes, listening. Birdsong. Children playing in the distance. Wind through the grass. There, to his left, a rustle. He smiled, opened his eyes, and plunged in. Whoever it was shrieked in surprise and took off running. Before they could take more than five steps, Sam had his arms around them and got a faceful of curly blonde hair that smelled like cinnamon and vanilla. Jessica started laughing, then lost her footing and fell. Sam, tangled around her, followed. Becky and Zach came crashing over.
“Maybe.” Inias shrugged and half-smiled. “I still think you should make it a side business. What's wrong with giving people healthy tea? Besides, I've seen you make yourself tea with orange peel and other shi- stuff when you've got a cold.”
'Shut up, bitch.'
“I, Gabriel Novak, used the word serious?”
. With your face. Like you know something I don't.'
“Does Cas look different to you?” Cas hears his name and stops. He doesn't want to walk in if they want to discuss him. He should turn around and come back later. He should. But he doesn't.
Jess had asked him what he and his family usually did for Thanksgiving and Sam had told her: If their dad wasn't home, he and Dean would get TV dinners and a pumpkin pie from the grocery store and stay up late making prank phone calls and if their dad
“Yeah?”
“Yeah. I said it. Don't bother yelling, I'm leaving.”
“Is it okay is we do a test run at the house?” Jimmy always called their childhood home 'the house.'
Which wasn't exactly true. Dean closed himself in and looked around. He whistled softly. Large sheets of paper were tacked up on all four walls, covered in all sorts of things. There were a number of drawings in charcoal that looked as though they'd been done very rapidly, the broad strokes forming outlines of naked people in various poses. There were dark ink-splattered paintings of animal jawbones, light pencil sketches, intricate designs made up entirely of colored dots, and dozens of drawings of leaves, petals, hands, and what looked like a beetle.
'A beret?'
“I can do that!” She was absolutely determined while brushing her teeth, but conked out after being horizontal in the guest room for five minutes.
'Yeah.'
And that was how he found himself sprawled on the torn up couch in Crowley's poster-plastered garage playing a high-stakes game of spin the bottle. Well, spin the can. Meg turned the volume of the deafening music down a bit. The garage was crawling with people, all of them drinking the cheap beer that Crowley had pinched from his oblivious parents, and the thumping bass made conversation near-impossible. Somehow, a group of about ten of them had started up a game that was a mashup of puff puff pass and spin the bottle. Dean had scoffed at them for being immature, but then understood: It wasn't about kissing, it was about sex. Dean was awed by the gravity of it and the disregard they all had for something the rest of the world considered to be so serious. He wanted to self-destruct and scorn the rules, too. So he had joined in.
Sam stood there staring at Dean as Dean walked to his room.
Dean stares. 'Of course.' He feels his face get hot. He didn't mean to sound like that. Cas doesn't seem to mind. Dean covers his embarrassment by adding the sieve to the dishwasher and starting it.
He followed his usual route down the stairs, avoided the creaky spots, stepped gingerly from step to step. He noted the signs of his father's homecoming; the huge leather jacket draped over the coat rack, the boots kicked off at the mat, the kitchen light on. Dean felt very small and distant all of a sudden, as if he had wandered into a stranger's house by accident and was staring around at all the personal debris carried in and deposited on the tides of someone else's life. Then his dad's chair scraped back, his familiar footsteps sounded in the next room, and Dean snapped out of it.
'Thanks, Gabe.' Dean had been aiming for sarcastic but the atmosphere of the house somehow made it sound half-genuine. Gabe patted Dean's cheek obnoxiously and then turned to rummage through the bowl of candy on the coffee table.
Cas stares at him blankly for a second, then laughs. Eyes crinkle. Dean can see his gums. It's so sudden and it changes his face completely, lighting it up from the inside. Dean's heart speeds up and beats, beats, beats against his ribs and he laughs at Cas laughing. All tension is lifted from the air.
'Brains over beauty, huh? Well, can't argue there. Where do you want this?'
'I couldn't do that, in all good conscience, Dean.' Dean's heart sinks and he has no idea how to salvage this. 'I don't know Jo very well, but she seems like a nice person, and I think she deserves better.'
Inias' face appeared at the entrance to the greenhouse. “There's a woman inside asking to speak to you. She has some questions about one of the workshops.”
Sam gaped in disbelief. Cas backed out through Dean's door, then whirled around and stomped down the stairs. The front door slammed. Sam heard swearing and the sound of Dean kicking something again.
When John next came home, in late March, he stayed for a few weeks. Even if it was only, Dean bitterly thought, to lecture his eldest son about his behavior. Dean knew he was being a grouchy and reckless dick, but he couldn't seem to check himself. In school he felt like he was suffocating. With Benny he felt like Cas was missing. With Sam he felt inadequate. He could only forget about the gaping cavity Cas had left behind and his own failure to be a good human being when he was with Crowley, Bela, Meg, and that crowd. They were the antithesis of everything Dean's life had been before and he needed that escape. John's presence, instead of soothing him as it usually did, made his skin itch and crawl. He chose to spend most of his time at Crowley's rather than face his dad's judgement, lectures, and drinking.
The diner is crowded, noisy, sticky. The sun punches its way through the window and delineates patches of heat on their table. Children shriek and gallop between the booths but Cas, Sam, and Dean don't speak. Cas is certain that the brothers are thinking of her too – he has seen Dean's dreams and he knows that Dean never forgets the ones they couldn't save. Sam is picking at an omelette with mushy chunks of unidentifiable vegetables in it and scrolling through his phone. Dean is meticulously spooning cream onto a slice of pie. He drips a small blob of cream onto each bite. Cas sips a coffee grey with milk and rests his hand in a splotch of sunshine. The warmth feels like another hand on top of his own. He feels guilty for enjoying it and moves his hand back into his empty lap. Dean's eyes look shinier than usual as he finishes his pie. Cas knocks his knee against Dean's accidentally-on-purpose. Dean moves away. The coffee curdles in Cas' stomach.
'His name was Bartholomew.' Cas' voice is quiet. Dean looks at him, asking silently. 'My Young and Stupid Mistake.'
“Can I take my lunch break?” Inias said in a rush before Castiel could take the call.
Dean falls asleep on the sofa-bed as soon as his head hits the pillow, and feels surprisingly rested when he stretches himself awake at quarter to six. He wiggles into yesterday's uniform and snags some toast for breakfast as a sleepy-eyed Jo limps downstairs, yawning, blonde hair in tangles.
They drove out to the edge of town, the night warm and welcoming and filled with the sounds of people celebrating. Sam leaned his head back against the seat and listened to the voices of the people he loved filling the car. He pretended they were in the sea, that the car was floating and covered in seaweed. Excitement built up in him.
'Is that us?'
. He pulled out card after card, unsure of whether he was actually feeling a pull toward them or if it was just his imagination. As he pulled them out, Dean lay them face up, card after card, until they formed a cross. One card in the middle, three cards fanning out in each of the four directions. Dean gathered the rest of the deck back up and set it aside. He stared at the cards. Cas watched Dean's eyes moving from card to card and fidgeted silently. Was he allowed to speak or was he supposed to sit here in reverential silence?
Dean's smile lit the room. 'I'll pick you up.'
'Shaddup.' Dean poured himself a mug of coffee.
John looked torn. 'Glad you two got dinner, but this family is not a charity case.'
'What do you know about it?' Dean mumbled. He felt dizzy.
Dean offered his own with a smile and a simple, “Nice to meet you.”
Sam and Jess played tic-tac-toe with their fingertips on the leather seats for five minutes until Dean and Cas came back with Benny in tow. Dean laughed at something Benny said and Benny flung his arms over Dean's and Cas' shoulders.
'I'm sure.'
'Totally. Be back soon.'
“From ME?!”
'What, how I'd prefer to die? No. What kind of question is that?'
Dean sniggers. 'Blowpipes?'
Anna's absence changed everything. Cas said she had to go to a hospital because she was sick. Sam knew what that meant: The kids at Sam's school said Anna was a loony and had to be locked up. It made Sam's stomach twist to think of her in a hospital and when people twirled their fingers by their temples he felt angrier than he could ever remember feeling. After Dean gave Gordon Walker a black eye at the middle school for calling her a psycho the word spread to the elementary school and most kids stopped making fun of her. That was one benefit of having the elementary school, the middle school, and the high school all next to one another in a huge long strip, on top of being able to share sports fields. Every time Cas went to visit Anna Sam hoped to hear news but Cas always returned pale and tight-lipped. He didn't talk about it. Sam noticed that each visit Cas made was followed by several days of uncharacteristic quietness.
Cas ran his hands up the backs of Dean's thighs and sucked him down like he couldn't get enough. After the display Dean had just witnessed, he was helpless to withstand the small humming noises Cas made, the obscene (although quiet) sound of Cas' lips sliding on Dean's skin, and the pressure rising from the pit of his stomach. He gripped Cas' hair in a warning, lifted his mouth from the pillow and choked out Cas' name just before he fell from the edge of his orgasm and pulsed into Cas' mouth.
'Can't say that I do.' The night air streams past the car, the sidewalks and streetlights and buildings fading in the darkness.
“Did you find the place okay?”
'Don't mention it.'
“Remind me again why we couldn't put him in a crate in the trailer.”
'Well, none. But...'
His mutant gigantor brother wraps him in a hug and claps him on the back. 'Hope you didn't totally lose it like the last time.'
Jo frowns at Dean.  'Why do you sound so surprised?'
'Never met a Bartholomew I liked.'
Cas smiled to himself, dug into the chocolate blackberry cake in front of him, and turned to stare out the café window. It was hard to focus on the street outside past the reflected glare of the sun on Anna's hair. He stared at her thoughtful face next to his own.
'Dean, we are not blowing up this shed.'
“Castiel!” she cooed. “How are you?” Her voice was as luridly optimistic as her clothing. Castiel resigned himself to the inevitable.
Dean was already reaching for the 'end call' button as Cas said, 'I will.' Then, almost as an afterthought, 'Dean, you are a remarkable man and a very competent hunter.' He hung up.
'Sammy?'
He could hear the humour in Jimmy's voice as he answered. “Shameless, isn't he? It's actually one of your new neighbours! From what he's said they haven't properly moved in yet but they're getting some stuff ready at the house and need lunch. Gabe is basically holding their sandwiches hostage.”
'All part of my appeal.' He smirked at Dean. Bela slumped down next to them and grabbed the lighter from Dean's hand. Crowley raised his eyebrows. 'Don't snatch, it's rude.'
'Don't worry about it. A buddy of mine and his wife will be joining us. We can handle it.'
'Really?'
A loud noise and blinding pain. Dean doubled over, holding his face. 'Ah, fuck! Fuck, that hurt. Aaaah.' His face felt like it was throbbing red against the cold night air.
'Oh yeah. Like when lightning hits a beach.' Duh. Dean thinks that if he had to compare them, Cas would be the gathering storm and Dean would be the waiting shore.
Cas gets up and walks over to Dean. 'Yes please.'
Dean nodded and started picking through the pieces, looking for two of the long tubes and a shape to use as an alien head. He bent them into a hunched shape with gangly legs and added two different-sized eye-circles to the face. Then, to make it sufficiently alien, he added a tail. Cas wound some tubes into a big ball and stuck short little pegs into the cracks.
Dean nodded tersely and hoisted the box in his arms. The three of them started walking back toward Dean's house. Dean kept his eyes on the box as he walked. The quarter sticks of dynamite stared up at him accusingly, their glaring, unapologetic promise of danger somehow made silly by the addition of a number of glittery, highly-colored fireworks.
'What is that?'
Sam groaned. 'What, just because you argued before he left?'
you do?'
'Thanks,' Dean says, his voice husky. He clears his throat and takes the glass, his fingers brushing Cas'.
Lawrence, Kansas
'That
He turned the key and walked back to his car, the crumbs from the morning long gone, and drove over to Jimmy and Amelia's house. When he arrived, he noted that his parents' car was already in the driveway, and walked in with happy anticipation. As always, their house was bright, warm, and filled with people.
'Dean, I think we should do that with all the leftovers. Those men were very pleased.' They're sitting in the hotel parking lot next to Cas' car and Dean is trying to focus and not to lose himself in thoughts of exactly what Cas' lips might taste like. He clears his throat. 'Sure, it's a date.' Cas looks away. Dean feels like a complete idiot. 'I didn't mean – Obviously, I don't want to – Unless you? Want to? I mean,' Dean rubs his face and bites the bullet. 'Do you want to come over for a drink? Or get coffee sometime?' What on earth is he even talking about? He hasn't been this nervous asking someone out since Rhonda Hurley, and that was when he was barely legal. He feels like he's walking a tightrope over a shark pit. Everything is tenuous, precarious, and he's having a hard time remembering to breathe. He glances over at Cas, whose face is drawn.
“What kind of mice?” He asked gravely, hugging her back with one arm.
The stress in the kitchen during wedding days brings Dean back to youthful memories that he'd rather avoid. Days when he and Sammy were hungry and bickering, when the food was stretched thin and the motel walls seemed to close in around them, and visions of terrible accidents hung in the air ('What if he was hurt, Dean? What if he was hit by a car? What if he was attacked?'). Dean would try to reassure Sam as his own fraying temper bit at its leash and sometimes he'd end up snapping irritably, which made them both feel even worse.
'You're a mystery to me, Dean Winchester.'
4th of July, 1996
'You get freaked out by black cats and spilling salt, too.'
John sagged against the door frame and sighed. 'It was that Fergus kid, wasn't it? Dean, I don't want you hanging around with his crowd. They're a bad bunch.'
Sam didn't know where Dean was. All he knew was that Dean had gone out to get food a few hours ago and he still wasn't back. Sam didn't panic, despite the worry writhing beneath his skin. He knew what to do. He picked up the phone and dialed the number his dad had taped next to the phone. His dad answered and his voice crackled across the distance.
When he looked up, Dean was already well ahead and waiting for him. The sound of caroling was louder now, and Sam could see a group of people in coats up ahead. 'Maybe we can get them to sing our cussing version of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, hey Sammy?'
Cas thought about it. 'So it's like a placebo effect.'
“I think I've got dibs on the big room,” Dean answered with a wicked grin.
The second greenhouse was for re-potting to allow the plants to grow to full size. Breathless, recovering, putting all of their energy into new growth, the plants would stay in this greenhouse for several weeks before being brought out to be displayed and sold.
'Toronto.'
'Well, hi, Cas. I'm Ellen, and this is Bobby. Nice to meet you.'
'Yeah?'
'Oh no you don't. We're taking a day off today.'
'Oh, you're Sam's brother? Cool. He mentions you a lot. From what I hear, you're pretty close to hero material.'
That was when they heard the sirens. Sam's head whipped around.
“What is it today?” Castiel asked. Inias never drank the same coffee twice in a row. Castiel supposed it came with the territory of being just out of high school and still finding yourself.
'Thanks, son.' John clasped Dean's shoulder briefly. 'It's good to be home. How's Sammy? Asleep?'
'Touched a nerve, I see.' She was really angry now. She leaned into Dean's face. 'Always thought you two were queer.'
'Yes. I can't wait to fall into bed.' Dean tries not to project himself into that mental image as heat creeps up his face. 'How about you?' Cas asks.
When the aftershocks had finished rippling through his body, he looked down at Cas and wondered what – Cas pulled back and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and fuck if that wasn't the hottest part of the whole thing. Dean threw his head back and let out a satisfied noise that made Cas chuckle. He reached down and pulled at Cas until Cas wiggled his way up and sprawled across Dean, whose pants were still down. Whatever. He was too heavy and relaxed to pull them up and who really cared anyway?
'Take care of yourself, Sammy.'
The daylight is fading outside when Dean closes up. Sam, Jess, Bobby, and Cas are all sitting on the couches, picking at leftover pastries. Dean flops down next to Cas and throws an arm around him. He closes his eyes and Cas leans into him. 'I'm beat,' he declares. 'Thank you guys. I couldn't have done it without you.'
“Sure thing! Hey, how are the pets coming along?”
'I cannot believe you both geek out so hard over books. How are we even friends?'
'Say no more.' Sam left, wiping his eyes.
“Well, not with coffee anyway. Can you handle the shop and the till today? I have some work to do in the greenhouses.”
Sam laughed so suddenly he choked.
'Sure. Why not.'
'Your post-apocalyptic future.'
And then it's finished. There it is. It sits there, staring at Dean. There's nothing else for Dean to do, so he turns, rather helplessly, to Cas, who doesn't say a word.
By the time Castel pulled up to the house with Claire in the backseat, he had forgotten about it, pushing all the thoughts back into their usual corner of his mind. There was an old-fashioned black car in the driveway next door, he registered, and the lights were on. The new neighbours must have moved in today.
Dean sees the moving van from a block away. The back is open and a crew of movers are gradually emptying the contents into a compact little two-story townhouse unit with a big shopfront window. He pulls in and parks at the front of the shop, behind the van, careful to leave enough space for unloading. The movers glance over at Dean as Cas emerges from the shop looking excited.
There was Anna. It was unmistakably her, in charcoal. Her hair was longer, she was thinner, and her eyes had bags underneath, but the swells and curves of her face came alive on the page. It looked like she might blink or speak at any moment. 'She looks happy.'
Dean walks in, groaning. “Coffee.”
Cas unzipped his sleeping bag and padded over to where his sketchbook lay on top of his shoes in the hall. He came back shivering and dove into the synthetic fabric, then shuffled through to find the right page. He handed it to Dean, who took it with a sense of awe.
Sam looks up and smiles. 'Thanks, chef.' Dean hates being thanked, so he never says 'you're welcome.'
The lights next door went off and caught his attention. The new neighbours must be turning in for the night. A light closer to the back of the house flicked on, and Castiel saw one of them walk past the window. He jumped and turned away, embarrassed, but curiosity got the better of him. He turned back and immediately hoped this wasn't the one that Gabe liked, because he was gorgeous. Castiel felt his face heat up. The man rubbed a hand over his face and yawned, then pulled off his shirt. Castiel choked at the shape of his chest, the whirl of hair there, and the second twist of hair leading below the waistband of his jeans. He looked away, blushing furiously, and walked as calmly as he could to the kitchen to get a glass of water, hoping that the light would be off by the time he went back. It was, and Castiel was left with heart palpitations.
When they left, Bones' tail whapping against the door in a staccato burst as Sam put the leash on, Dean went to the fridge and got out a beer. Sighing into the peaceful silence, he opened the screen door and stepped out onto the back porch for the first time. It was a big yard with a couple of old trees that he would've loved to have climbed as a kid. An unpainted wooden fence at about chest height ran around the perimeter, covered over in some places with ivy or flowering raspberry canes. There was a picnic table, and old-fashioned bird bath, and little else aside from thick soft grass. Warm light spilled out onto the lawn from the house to Dean's right. Must be that guy Hyun-Sook mentioned, Dean thought. He sipped his beer and heard voices from the house next door. A low gravelly tone was saying something that sounded serious and was answered by a child's laughing voice. Mr. Next-door must have a daughter. Dean couldn't make out the words but their conversation seemed silly and made him feel nostalgic for childhood in general. He smiled to himself and went back inside.
John watched Sam run full-tilt to Jo and her friend, a miniscule girl with flame-red hair, at the first exhibit. His feet hit the ground so hard John thought it was a miracle the pavement didn't crack. He always forgot just how tall Sam was for his age until he saw him with other kids. Especially Jo, who was a year younger. Bobby and Ellen followed more sedately. John gave Bobby a firm handshake and kissed Ellen on the cheek.
Two hours later, they settled at a picnic table by the playground with some plain burgers ('No ketchup, Daddy, no no.'). Dean and Castiel scarfed down their burgers and took off running to the playground. John could see them howling with laughter and chasing each other. Jo, Sam, and Charlie were all playing around with their food and carrying on a half-nonsensical conversation.
'I'm getting cold, do you want to head back? I don't think I can eat any more cake.'
'Yes. I did.'
'She's actually gone to see her parents. I think she wanted to give us some space for 'bonding' or something.'
'He's not listening to your genius plan.'
'Yes. Sorry, I should run. I have to clock in.' And then he practically flees, and Dean is left feeling puzzled. Was it something he said?
He lost all sense for a moment. She was incredibly tight, wet, and hot. Slipping inside her felt unreal. Dean thought of molten metal, hailstorms, Cas' eyes. When his mind came back, he heard himself moaning. The air smelled like sex. The light from the streetlamp outside painted Bela's skin orange. Dean's hands roamed up her back and tangled in her hair. He thrust up into her as she bore down on him, her eyes closed and mouth open. He fell back onto the pillow and she stretched herself out on top of him, hands gripping the headboard, hips pressing into his and circling, grinding. She was gasping now, and Dean's moans were louder. The bedposts were banging the wall. Her breasts were near enough, so Dean dipped his head forwards and sucked her left nipple. His hands found her ass and pulled her down harder and harder, crashing their hips together like colliding cars, like punches. He couldn't stop the noises he was making now, knew he was making a scene but didn't care. She arched her back, cried out, and tensed around him. Her whole body quivered. Her mouth was open in a silent yell. That was when he came, throwing his head back and pulsing into her until he was spent and his entire body went weak and floppy.
“You know...that actually might work.”
He hightails it around the corner over the awful patterned carpet and, thankfully, sees a porter and hands him the tray. 'Can you run this down to 73? Thanks a million.' Dean dashes off before he can say anything. Dean walks back to Cas, who's still standing exactly where Dean left him, head hung low, rubbing his forehead.
Dean rolled his eyes. 'I know. I have something else in mind. Besides,' he said, rapping the art-covered wall with his knuckles, 'these are too good to destroy.' Cas' face turned pink. 'Yeah, you thought I didn't do it because I like you, but really it was to save your creepy nudist drawings.'
'What was that?' John's voice was sharp.
'How many Bartholomews have you actually met?'
Cas wriggled down into his sleeping bag on the couch. The muted TV cast bluish shadows on his face. 'You know, I think Gabe has an old guitar in his room.'
'My father's name was John.'
Dean looked back at the cards. 'It seems like, and correct me if I'm wrong, you're wondering whether or not you made the right decision about your career.'
'Beats me.' Dean stood up and brushed himself off. 'Bum a smoke?'
Dean had never heard his name spoken with that much venom. It made him want to fight. His entire body craved it. He emptied himself of emotion and said, 'What's it look like?'
'Shit!' He rips the oven door open to be greeted by clouds of black smoke and the smell of burning. He swears again and pulls out tray after tray of hard black croissants. He leans over the counter and rubs his hand over the bottom half of his face. Fuck. They're going to have to use frozen rolls and everyone is going to be rushing for at least an hour to cover his stupid mistake. His knees feel weak, his skin feels too tight. The rest of the staff begins to trickle into the kitchen. They cough and wave at the air.
As a matter of fact, it does. Dean surveys the display shelves filled with baked goods – the pumpkin pie muffins are there, the chocolate chip zucchini bread, the maple and pecan plaits, and, because he knows Cas loves them, chocolate lava cakes. There are also blueberry muffins, homemade bagels, slices of different cakes, scones, and macaroons. Jess gets the coffee machine set up and working, and then it's time. When they open the doors of The Bunker for business at around noon to catch the rest of the lunch rush, it fills up quickly, a rush of orders and laughter and busy office workers. Jo, Kevin, and Chuck come in on their lunch break instead of eating at the hotel and make a show of admiring the paint job. Dean gives them all a huge box of pastries to take back with them. When the lunch rush dies down, he asks Sam to man the counter while he gets more pastries from the back and Cas follows him. He grins at Dean.
'I understand.' Cas turned to leave.
'Congratulations. Your first day is half over. Nobody died or set fire to anything.'
'Trust me, man, you don't ever want to find out.'
Dean half turns to reply jokingly and sees Cas a few metres behind them, looking awkward. 'Hey, Cas! Can I talk to you for a sec?' He waits for Cas to catch up, and points over his shoulder at Jo. 'When we get home we're going to settle this once and for all, Cinderella.'
Sam got to his feet, still smiling, and watched them all traipsing through the grass, Jess' hair the color of honey in the low sun.
Cas' face hardens. 'You'd know if it happened to you. Count yourself lucky if it hasn't.'
Sam watched Cas nod. 'Good thinking.'
'Sam! This is so cool!'
'Follow me.' He checks to see that Cas is behind him, blotchy cheeks and all. He walks back to the kitchen and through it, shaking his head warningly when Kevin opens his mouth, and leads Cas out the back, to the deserted smoking area. Cas relaxes against the wall and closes his eyes, taking deep breaths. Dean leans against the wall next to him. The bricks are warm and damp and smell like clay. There's a private sort of silence between them while Cas collects himself. They just stand in the sun, breathing in the smell of fresh air and almost-rain. Dean relaxes and lets his head fall back against the wall. He watches the sky and listens to Cas' breathing return to normal next to him. After a minute or two, he turns to Cas, who's looking at him. Dean feels winded by those eyes. The sunlight makes them brighter, somehow. Clearer. Dean feels happy and peaceful for no real reason, and he can't help smiling a little.
Sam just grinned like the cat that got the canary and Dean out and out
“But I'm not tired, Uncle Cas,” she pouted, eyes drooping.
Castiel's jaw locks in frustration. 'Did they really need to do that?'
'Hi Dad. Dean left hours ago and he's still not back.'
'Yes, of course.'
Next door to Castiel, Bones gave a startling whuff and then barked properly, once. Sam blinked his eyes and adjusted the headphones of his white noise machine. Dean, though awake, kept his eyes closed, holding on to a warm feeling from a dream that had vanished as soon as he had woken. He tried to hang on to that sense of calm deep in his chest – a feeling of being loved, of comfort, of home. He chased the feeling back into sleep again.
'I don't know!' Cas said emphatically. Dean stopped struggling. 'Not...that. Not you running all the time.' Cas cautiously released Dean's arm. Dean backed up, rubbing his neck, and Cas had the decency to look the slightest bit sheepish. They stared at each other. Cas broke the silence. 'I'm not sorry. About kissing you.' Dean was the hot air balloon, Cas was the flame. 'I am sorry I didn't call, though. I knew what you – I was just – '
'Alright, so get mad. Think of someone you're pissed at.'
Sam looked back and forth between them. Dean put the plant down on the table and flicked his hands to get the muddy water off. 'Oh. Well.' He bobbed his head in a yeah-I-guess movement and turned back to his food. He wasn't about to question Cas' logic. The angel just did peculiar stuff sometimes, and when Dean asked about it, Cas always sighed and explained with painful exasperation. It was never very important for Dean to understand anyway, so he simply filed Cas under 'Unfathomable Inner Workings' along with cats, Twitter, and teenagers, and didn't worry about it.
Dean was sorely tempted to join his brother and Jessica's family for a barbeque and fireworks that wouldn't harm anyone. He knew Sam was worried about him. He could salve Sam's concern as easily as accepting an invitation, could make Sam believe that everything in Dean was whole and unfractured. He hovered on the edge of an answer before slipping off the edge of the knife.
It smells delicious, but Dean can never eat these pies. He doesn't want those thoughts back.
'That's great!'
'I don't like him.'
Dean and Crowley left Bela sleeping on the couch and went straight to school from Crowley's house on Monday morning. She waved them off and said she'd catch up later, so they shrugged and left. They knew she had enough stolen hall passes and forged notes from her parents to stroll in whenever she wanted.
“Cas!” Amelia greeted him at the door with a hug. Brief, because she knew he wasn't fond of them.
Dean was stunned. “I can't believe you actually met a mafia boss! And how did you learn to do all of that with just a shoelace?”
'Ah, no, I am letting you do that, because I feel bad that you're still limping like a pirate.'
The intercom crackled over the din with the morning announcements as Dean and Cas set off for their first class of the day. They were lightheartedly abusing one another for being a bookworm and a caveman respectively when Dean heard something about the wrestling team. The vice principal was congratulating the team on having won a victory against – and here Dean's heart skipped – his team from when he was at Sonny's. Someone bumped into Dean. He was standing frozen in the middle of the hall, blocking everyone. He didn't care about the match, really, but everything he had lost came rushing back in a furious surge: Sonny's smile, the other boys, Robin's laughter, the version of himself that dressed up for a dance. The feeling that someone believed in him.
Cas forks up a piece of the cake, taking a thin slice that goes from the top to the bottom; a perfect cross-section. Dean waits, watching, and is rewarded with a small blissful noise that sends heat to the pit of his stomach. 'This is incredible, Dean.' Cas takes another bite. 'How did you do this?'
Sam puts a hand on his arm. 'It's amazing, Dean.'
Dean thought he hid his grin but Hyun-Sook noticed and laughed. “That's alright,” she soothed, patting Bones, “it's easy to get turned around the first time. You'll get used to it. So tonight's the first night, huh?”
They walk slowly down the ramp, Dean backwards, Cas forwards, and into the shop. Dean is distracted on both sides: he looks behind him to see where he's going, he looks in front to see Cas sweaty, sleeves rolled up, hair even more mussed than usual. 'Not going to lie, Cas, those metal rods would make for a fantastic swordfight.'
'It was a good day.'
'Sleep sounds good.' Dean glanced over at Cas and saw him as a stranger stripped of all associations. A thin, muscular boy in paint-splashed clothes with mussy black hair and chapped lips was staring back at Dean and finishing off a bottle of whiskey. Dean smiled happily. Cas smiled back. The familiar-strange-familiar face lit up. Dean's stomach squirmed, not unpleasantly. Cas' smile faltered and he opened his mouth to say something. Time slowed. Dean felt an unutterable horror. Cas was upset. That meant that something awful had happened. Dean did not want to know. He didn't want anything to be wrong, he wanted to breathe and not know and then maybe it would all just disappear. All he knew was that he desperately needed to stop Cas from saying whatever it was he was going to say or the world would end. So he grabbed the whiskey bottle and threw it onto the tracks, where it shattered.
“It's our night, Uncle Cas! There's a hornbill in Africa that has long eyelashes like a person and eats mice!”
Somehow, that tiny movement clanged with a huge, unspeakable rejection. Dean's distaste was magnified as if his clarity were a prism. The beam of it blasted out from him and made Bela's hungry desires look crude and flimsy. She bristled at the sting of it.
Dean groaned and pushed himself to his feet. He hated research, he really did. 'Dude. We've been at it for hours. I'm human, I need dinner first.' He started toward the door.
“Yes.” Cas felt a deep well of yearning open inside him like a gulf. “You did.”
'Tell us what you really think, Cas.' Dean is exasperated, mostly because he knows Cas is right. 'Fine. I'll see if they can call in one of the part-time workers.'
“Yes please. You know Claire wouldn't have it any other way. Sundays are her fav – ” Here Gabe cut him off by pushing him forcefully into the kitchen. Castiel laughed.
“Suit yourself!” Inias fumbled to tie the strings of his thick green apron, faded from washing. “You're never tempted to switch it up, try new things? Boldly go where the path hasn't been forged or whatever?”
'I'm always here late. I'm one of the only ones with the keys. You headed home?'
“I think she's also interested in one of your teas. She's from some garden club. She said you gave one of her friends some tea as a get-well gift last year.”
Through the haze of his own delirious laughter, Dean hears someone speaking in a gravelly voice. He hiccups and tries to suppress his laughter and focus. There are a couple of bearded men in dirty, patched coats speaking to them. 'Is this your bread? Were you dropping it off?'
Sam raised his voice and spoke to the wood grain and the handle. He knew Dean could hear him. 'But it's Cas, Dean. You know he'd like to see you.' He could practically see Dean rolling his eyes. Defeated for the moment, he slouched back to Jess.
'Were those bags of sand I was carrying before?'
'Hi, dad. There're leftovers in the fridge.'
The presents were ripped open (they were a bit strange and Dean wouldn't show Sam what was in his stocking, but Sam was glad to have new things to play with) and Sam finished his cereal. As he took his bowl to the kitchen, he saw Dean elbow Cas and say, 'Thanks for all this, Cas. And for last night. This is fun.'
Dean couldn't have inhaled even if he'd wanted to. Cas was so close, his eyes were boring into Dean's, his jaw was set and hard. Even though he could see Cas struggling not to hit him, Dean couldn't think of anything but how glad he was that Cas was touching him again and how confused he felt about feeling glad. His brain, overstimulated, simply shut down. 'Fucking do it,' he managed to choke out. He braced himself for the blow. And Cas kissed him for the second time.
Naomi sighs, exasperated. 'Can you take Castiel around the kitchen? Show him where the teacups and room service supplies are, and then show him back to the trolley room. I'll take it from there.' She gives Castiel a brusque nod and a tight-lipped smile and leaves. Castiel stares after her like Tom Hanks stared after that volleyball, then turns to look at Dean. Wide-eyed. Unsure.
'Sleeping on the job, brother?'
“I know th – ” Defense. Confusion.
Dean sighed. 'Listen, Sam, I'm glad they're back and everything, but did you notice the lack of phone calls? And I don't see Cas rushing over here. We're not really friends anymore.'
. Sam sips his coffee with a mock-pretentious look and Dean cracks up. He has a smudge of syrup at the corner of his mouth and Cas wants to lick it off.
'AUGH!'
'You're not having any?'
Everyone in the cafeteria scrambled to find a window that looked out onto the shared soccer and baseball fields. Sam's height gave him an advantage: He peered over the heads of everyone else and could see the high school students filing out and standing in sections on the pitches.
'No, she's out on a job.'
'The name of an
'Where did you move from?'
Claws wrap around his shoulders and he can't throw them off.
'Where do these go?'
be angry?'
'Well, none. But...'
Thanksgiving, 1995
They stumbled back to the bunker bloody and exhausted and Dean headed to his room, fully prepared to collapse on his bed in his dirty clothes and sleep for a couple days. It wasn't to be. Dean opened his bedroom door and yelled. He had his gun out and aimed before he even knew what he was doing. Adrenaline pumped through his veins as he stared at a huge stuffed grizzly bear looming in the middle of the room. Its mouth was open in a silent snarl, its claws spread out and glinting dully in the yellow light.
The voices rose and rose, getting louder and louder. Castiel marvelled at the fact that the other children weren't waking. His body felt heavy, so heavy, so tired, but all he could think about were the shadows of people moving beyond the door. He wanted to know what they were doing – and at the same time, he was afraid to see. He gathered all his energy and tried to roll over. It was like lifting a sack of bricks. His arms wobbled. He tried to get his numb legs underneath himself to push his body up, but couldn't manage. They were so heavy. Shadows and light flicked across his face. He pulled himself forward on his arms, eyes half-closed, the world wobbling erratically in his vision.
'Alright,' Dean mumbled through a mouthful of toast, 'let's see what we can see.'
'Except 20 bucks.'
It became a small town with a big heart, as its motto succinctly proclaimed in peeling paint on the weather-worn welcome sign. A sweet place with just enough character to keep it from being trite and with something indefinable that made those passing through lift their heads and take notice. Not that there were many of those; Birch Ridge was not a huge tourist attraction. But it did have a smaller, steadier stream of visitors during the summer months that mostly consisted of middle-aged couples on the hunt for a nice B&B and architecture students from neighbouring towns and cities.
Cas watches him warily. 'Sure.'
“They're doing well. Although I think the humidity will need to be adjusted and the vents will need to be closed halfway.” And with that said, Castiel's work day began.
'Good boy. I'll be back soon.' He hung up.
'Dean?'
“Speaking of things you don't notice, are you
Kevin sighs. 'It was obviously that bad, because we're still hearing about it.'
Sam stares at Cas with that crease between his eyebrows and Cas smiles at him. “I actually am fine, Sam. No lasting damage.”
'Be my guest.'
Sam looked impressed. “How'd you figure that out?”
Cas paused in the act of following Dean. Sam looked up, saw, and raised his eyebrows. 'Or not.'
Sam stared at the back of Cas' head and fumbled to find the right words to express the foggy distance in Dean's eyes, the way Sam suspected that Dean hadn't really seen anything in a week. 'I mean he's never home. He's mad all the time. He doesn't talk anymore. It looks like he got into a fistfight. He doesn't...I dunno...he's off in his own head. Like he's not even there.' Cas made a hmm-ing noise and crouched down to reorganize his socks. Sam sighed. 'Maybe you could talk to him.'
'Yeah.' Dean stomped the slush from his boots onto the mat.
Sam and Cas turn to look at him. Cas, puzzled, blurts out, “I thought I heard you leave a few minutes ago.”
Dean was silent for a moment. 'Yeah, I know. He tried to wake you up.'
Castiel thought, and an unwanted image of his brother twisted in pain came to his mind. That was the day Castiel burned the house down, with most of the adults in it.
'That way.'
“Cas.” Dean's voice sounds just as shocked as Cas feels. Cas risks a glance at Dean, whose eyes are unsure. Dean reaches out and touches Cas' chest. Cas shivers and looks down. His ribs are slightly visible through his skin, moving like bodies under blankets when he breathes. Dean's fingertips are points of electricity where they touch him. Dean steps forward until his body is inches from Cas'. Heat radiates between them, even under the steaming water. Cas' erection is painful now and he can't look away from Dean's face. Dean's eyes are even more beautiful from this new vantage point, and even as they move uncertainly around Cas' face Cas is getting drunk on watching Dean's eyelashes. His head feels as light as air. He reaches up and touches Dean's face, brushes lightly over the stubble there. He has to close his eyes. He feels too much, he wants too much, and then Dean's body is pressing against his own from pelvis to collarbones. Chest to chest. It's so sudden that it takes Cas a moment to realise that Dean is kissing him, that he's kissing back with hunger.
Dean sighs. 'Chuck, are you shaking me down right now?'
'What's the weirdest nightmare you've ever had?' Dean isn't fully certain if he asked that out loud, eyes already closing.
|  .. | .-.. | --- | ...- | . | -.-- | --- | ..- |
'How long are you going for? Will you be back in time for Christmas?' Sam tried to keep his voice light and even. He handed Cas a matched pair of socks.
'Well, I did wonder if you were panicking or going into anaphylactic shock.' Dean looks at him blankly. 'Severe allergic reaction,' Cas clarifies.
Dean lifted a flat piece with holes cut into it and took a circle from Cas. He slotted the circle into the hole and pressed it flat with his palms, making sure the edges aligned. Dean liked it when things fell into place and fit together.
Bela wrapped an arm around Dean, who ran through a mental checklist of everything he'd brought with him. Nothing he'd miss.
Dean's hand came away from his face with a small amount of blood. He straightened up. Cas was so close he couldn't breathe. He could see Cas' eyelashes. He felt his face. It stung. 'I think it's just a small cut.' Cas' cold fingers touched Dean's now-swollen cheek. Dean jerked back as if electrocuted.
Dean falls asleep thinking about reaching for Cas in the dark and the low rumble of his voice, wondering what exactly they are to each other.
Birch Ridge was a location that worked for both of them: Sam had landed a minor job at the nearby university and it was a small enough town that Dean felt comfortable and confident that he'd be able to scratch out a living with so many commuters and their cars around. Plus. Dean reminded himself, having a house and yard instead of a cramped apartment meant that Bones could spend more time outside (read: out from under Dean's feet).
'Ain't you two finished yet?' Bobby grabs a beer and cracks it open.
Dean shoves the pile of  pages off his bed. SHOP FOR RENT, FITTED KITCHEN. UNIT AVAILABLE FOR RENT. CONTACT MABEL AT 785 695 4023. They flop to the floor and Dean climbs in underneath a thin blanket. The night is warm and the fan is on. Dean turns out the light and dozes with the fan's light breeze on his skin, and almost immediately wakes up with a jolt and a yell. He hears a rustle from the living room and a disheveled and sleepy Castiel appears in the doorway. Dean's heart is hammering and his brain is still half-asleep, so his reaching for Cas is more a reflex than a request. Nevertheless, Cas pads over to the bed, eyes half-closed, and gets in beside Dean. The weight and warmth of another body makes Dean feel safer, so he rolls over nearer to Castiel, nestling his back against the other man. Cas shifts around to accommodate Dean.
Dean nodded. When Dean got older, he'd look back on this moment and wonder why he'd thought he understood. He'd known that his dad's job was what kept food on the table, known that it had to be done. But he'd missed the undertone to his dad's question, the lines between the lines, that hands-out palms-up begging for absolution. In the future, Dean wouldn't blame his dad. He probably would've wanted to avoid the house just as much as his dad did if their places were reversed.
“I will. Am I still on for baby-sitting?”
Cas sits down beside him. 'What's your fault?'
'Oh. Do you want to take it home, or...?'
Sam glanced up from the GPS on his phone and wrapped a hand in Bones' collar, guiding him backward, away from Dean's face. Bones wagged his tail from the back seat as if he hadn't just nearly made them crash.
'I asked if you wanted a refill,' Cas asks over the sounds of 'Armed and Dangerous' on cable. He gives his lowball a little shake and gestures to the bottle of whiskey on the coffee table.
Under Castiel's careful tending, The Nursery had been reinvigorated. He had expanded the range of plants and supplies, added more greenhouses for keeping the plants in more specific conditions, and started offering short classes on alternative gardening. The Nursery had a good reputation in town; people said that the plants they got from Castiel were healthier, bloomed longer, and grew taller.
'Jesus, that's fucking poetic, Cas.' Truthfully, Dean is disturbed. Cas sounds like he's describing a dangerous relationship. Which makes him wonder...exactly what do his feelings about baking say about him? He doesn't have time to consider.
1991-1992
'Cas, what the hell? Why?' Sometimes you just had to make it obvious when you were talking to Cas.
“It's a graham cracker crust.”
'Thanks, dad. I love it.'
'Dean!'
“Look ma, we made it,” Jimmy said	quietly. One side of his mouth quirked up in a bittersweet half-smile.
'I'll give you the first piece I make in the new studio.'
A pile of sketchbooks was stacked on the desk. Dean put the box down on the floor and picked one up, suppressing his pang of conscience at invading Cas' privacy. In the dark he could just make out neat dates on the covers in Cas' steady handwriting. Dean picked up the one that was labeled 'Feb. - Oct. 1995'. Cas had done a sketch of Dean then, hadn't he? Cas had said he was breaking in his studio. It wasn't snooping if Dean just wanted to see the drawing of himself, right? Dean opened it to a random page and Anna stared back. It was the charcoal sketch Cas had shown Dean last year. Dean looked at it for a moment, then flipped the pages. A wine glass. A broken-down house. A page of colored paint blotches. A geometric design. Two hands. A tree. Dean smiling.
'Dean. OY.'
“No!” Castiel exclaimed. “I'm not certified or - ” He cut himself off as they walked through the door and he saw the woman at the till. She beamed over at him, face seeming to float above a neon-bright pink shirt with vivid orange lettering scrawled across it that spelled out 'Avant-Garden Society.' Castiel fought the urge to squint against the brightness of it all.
'It surprises me too.'
'My charisma,' Dean deadpans as Bobby walks in.
Dean squirms. 'I don't have a
It turned out the monster was a Satori, a Japanese creature that appeared human and preyed on lone travelers. A carnivorous clairvoyant nut job that gained strength from sucking out others' thoughts and feelings. The only way to get the drop on it was to make your mind completely blank. Needless to say, the Winchesters failed spectacularly and would've been the thing's lunch if it hadn't been for Cas. The lore hadn't mentioned any special way of killing it but decapitating it while it choked the crap out of Cas seemed to do just fine.
“He gets nervous, Dean, and carsick. Would you rather get some surprise affection or have to scrub dog barf off the seats?”
He feels dizzy. The claws cut into his skin and he feels them draw blood. He lets out a noise of pain.
'Well, if it means anything to you, this card - ' here he handed Cas a card with a big sun, with a field of sunflowers and a weird little cherub riding a horse – 'is really positive. It means success and fulfilment, basically, and it's in the line that talks about possible outcomes.'
'Lost?' Dean asks.
'No, I'm fine, really. Just don't...like....' He gestures at the TV. There was probably a better way to phrase that but the whiskey has gone to his head. 'The cars crashing. My dad - ' He looks away from Cas' too-steady stare.
'Hm?'
'Yeah, most people do. It's probably the hardest job in the hotel. Michael's your brother, right? Why did he put you on rooms? Most people have a year or two of experience in motels or something to soften the blow.'
Cas looked at the card and felt a weird hope in his chest. He was aware that Dean was looking at him and lifted his head to stare back. 'Anna told you all that about my Masters course and our dad, right? Seriously.'
The next day, Jo comes in to work with Dean. They goof off in the car, and are still shoving each other when they reach the doors.
4th of July, 1996
“You must be Sam and Dean! I'm Hyun-Sook McGuirk.”
“Yes?”
'It's going pretty well. I've had a few commissions and I've started supplying one of those fancy kitchen stores. I finally got to quit at the hotel.'
'Wrestling. And playing guitar. Acoustic.' Dean felt himself flushing. With Robin, learning the guitar had seemed cool; artistic but still manly. He could serenade maidens as well as swing the dusty guitar case onto his back and drive off into the sunset. But here, in the dark living room, surrounded by his life with his dad, he heard a faint whisper:
Cas only half believed that, but he'd ask Anna later. For now... 'Can I ask you a personal question?'
'Hello?'
John narrowed his eyes. 'Enough with this new attitude, Dean. The school called me about your attendance. Sam told me you haven't been yourself. It's time for you to shape up.'
Cas' face crumpled and Sam wondered if Cas knew what was wrong with Dean. If anyone would know, it was Cas. Sam sure as hell didn't. He had barely seen his brother over the last week. Sam tried to figure out how to ask without sounding nosy. Cas got up and walked over to his suitcase, his back to Sam. 'How is Dean, anyway? I haven't seen him around lately.'
Sam and Jess beam, Jess' engagement ring winking in the early morning sun.
'What a waste of good muffins!'
Take all the students out of a school, Dean thought, looking out the window, and you get an entirely new place – the emptiness feels welcoming and intimate, the silence seems magical, everything looks different. The classroom he and Benny sat in was filled with slanting butter-yellow light, looking completely different in the late afternoon glow from how it usually did in the chill light of morning. He could almost see into the middle school windows from here.
'Effort of will.'
“Alright. Ready?”
After a 15 minute tour of the house, Dean already knew that if the next-door neighbour was anything like Hyun-Sook they were definitely going to have to go over and make friends.
'Yes sir.'
There was a soft sound and two rows of sharp teeth clicked open, then closed. A yawn? A silent scream? Another, different sound as it moved into a clearing, feet disturbing the mouldering leaves of the forest floor. The trees quivered. Its eyes glowed yellow, seemingly lit from within. It paused in its movements, hunkering down, muscles coiled. Suddenly, almost too quickly to be true, it leapt. Claws flashed in the faint moonlight, and a tiny death was drawn out in blood. Fangs flashed again. The moon rose higher and illuminated a twitching tail, thickly padded paws, a raised ridge of fur along the creature's back.
Anna stood up. 'Well, are you a changed man? Did Dean blow your mind?' Dean stuffed his hands in his pockets and shuffled his feet. Cas tried desperately to keep a straight face and failed. 'You could say that.' He caught Dean's eye and they both bit their lips and looked away quickly. Cas felt about two seconds away from more uncontrollable laughter. Anna glanced between the two of them, her sister-sense tingling. She shot Cas a look that clearly said
Dean gives his head a quick shake. 'Sorry, what?'
Chuck leaned down to speak to Castiel through the open window. John had always wondered why those kids got stuck with such bizarre  names. Michael and Gabriel were understandable, but Castiel? Anael? He just couldn't fathom it. He heard an echo of Mary's voice: To each their own, sweetheart. He got in, fastening his seatbelt.
'Nothing.' Dean smiled. Cas smiled back, unguarded, open like a favorite book, and closed his eyes, tipped his forehead to press against the side of Dean's face. The two boys lay just like that – warm, intertwined, bared completely – as the last reflected light faded and darkness tiptoed in. Dean was so happy to have his arms and his heart full of Cas that he didn't even think about light.
“Okay, solid.”
4th of July, 1996
'For God's sake, Castiel, don't do that. It takes too long. Look, it's simple. You fold it in half, you fold it again, then one, two, three rolls and you're done. You should know this by now.'
Sam held his breath and waited for the explosion. It didn't come. But eventually Dean spoke and it was somehow worse. His voice was rough and sarcastic. 'I should've known. Everyone leaves eventually, right?' It wasn't a question.
He and Jess walked to lunch together and met up with Brady, Becky, Zach, and the new girl, Sarah. They were just sitting down at their usual table when they heard the alarm in the distance. Everyone stopped and looked around, as if the source was just out of sight.
'Broke and living under a bridge, I'm sure.' She rolls her eyes. Dean shrugs and smiles into his sandwich. Best part of working in a hotel kitchen? Getting free hotel leftovers for lunch. Whenever Dean takes his lunch break in the staff section of the kitchen (three ramshackle tables pressed up against one wall of the room where they store serving dishes) he feels like he's eating in a commune or a POW camp. Or a can of overworked sardines. Today's not so bad. Before Jo came over, Dean had been in the background, quietly watching Kevin and Chuck play a loud game of competitive hangman. Which is still going strong. Just as Kevin points out that Chuck's hanged-man's hat looks more like a frying pan and Chuck responds by throwing the pencil at Kevin's head, the accommodation crew walk in. It's a sea of sweaty, red-faced women, walking too quickly, like they haven't adjusted to being on a break. No smiles there.
'Surprise me.'
'Relax, man. I won't bite.' Dean is a little taken aback by this guy's hesitance. No, is it hesitance? It's more like fear. 'Seriously. It's not so bad here. I know it's overwhelming at first, but you get used to it.' Castiel nods, swallows. Dean stops at a section of wall shelving and turns to Castiel. 'So here you go. There are saucers, teacups, packets of instant coffee, teabags, and sugar. Don't quote me on this, but I think the room attendants are supposed to take about ten sets back to their trolley.' Dean waits for a response, any response. Castiel looks like he's waiting for something. Dean is starting to feel concerned, and a little lost. 'Seriously, Castiel – it's Castiel, right? Are you okay? You look like you're about to hurl.'
Dean thought. 'Let's go downtown. We can go get some CDs or see a movie. I'll let you drag me to that bookstore and I won't even complain.'
I loved the sass of the 'It's a shortened version of my name' line, and I just HAD to put it in!
'That's cool, it was going to go bad in a day or two.'
He keeps his eyes on the ground and walks as calmly as he can out of the kitchen. Halfway to the bathroom his vision begins to darken around the edges. His breathing is fast and erratic and he knows that can't be right. He stumbles into the custodial closet and holds onto the wall, trying not to sink to the floor. Their car crashed. The metal was twisted. His breaths are high and gasping and his heart is racing furiously in his chest. His legs buckle. He curls in on himself, wraps his arms around his chest, tries to remember how to be normal. HOW TO BE NORMAL. He sees the words in all capitals. The smell of burning metal. His lungs are seizing, his hands and feet are tingling from lack of oxygen, his breath is being ripped from him. Dean's father's face swims in front of him. Blurry. Vague. Vague. Blurry. And then. He sees it as clear as day. His father. John Winchester smiles and reaches for Dean, his expression clearing, then contorting. He yells as the car hits them. 'Dean!' Something hits him. His face stings. He sees Jo's earlier words. They hover in his vision. IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT, DEAN, ACCIDENTS HAPPEN.
Benny laughed. 'Yeah, I know. But the old bag keeps going on about wanting to know our real thoughts about the characters, not just, and I quote, “the same old recycled drivel.” She said anyone can pass a pop quiz with the faintest idea of what the book is about, but a book report forces you to think.'
Cas is overwhelmed. He turns around and leaves the bunker. He walks down the quiet roads for hours. When he returns, they all act as if nothing happened, aside from Sam watching what Cas eats with a sceptical eye.
'...thank you, Dean.' Cas pretends he doesn't see through it like glass and Dean pretends not to hear the smile in Cas' voice.
Gabriel came back out with a brown paper bag that looked like it had a whole herd of pastries squashed inside. “Doesn't matter. His name isn't important. The important part is that he was allergic to dogs.”
'I'm fine. I'm golden. What are we making?'
On the first day of July, Sam asked if they could spend the holiday with Jess' family.
Castiel nodded. “You know, I'm an adult now, Mrs. McGuirk, you can swear around me.”
Sam's face lights up. 'At the hotel? Awesome! When do I get to meet him? Or is it a her?'
'Yeah, man, is that okay? Thank you.'
Dean knew what was supposed to happen. He was supposed to drop his gaze and say 'yes, sir.' But he wouldn't do it. He couldn't. He had had it with unswerving obedience. Dean's vision suddenly cleared: He saw John Winchester for who he was – a broken man, a man in mourning, a functional alcoholic, an absent father trying and failing to do his best. The fight drained out of Dean in a matter of seconds. He had nothing else to say, so he walked up the stairs.
'No, thanks.'
The man grins appreciatively and nods. 'Let me get you one then.' He leans over the bar and orders Dean a refill. 'What's your name?'
After work, Dean goes into his house long enough to pack a duffel bag and make a phone call, then he heads to the airport. It's only a three hour flight out to Stanford, but Dean wants to leave as soon as possible because it tires him out to travel by plane. No, it isn't because he spends half the flight hyperventilating and trying not to scream, of course not. If he had a choice, he'd drive his baby out, but he only has a few days off from work, so he has to compromise.
After that, Dean barely came home at all until John eventually left on a cross-country trip, taking the other car and leaving the Impala for Dean. Even then, Dean spent most of his time with his new horrible friends. His voice started to bend in Crowley's direction with a barely-detectable British twang cut into short snippets. Sam saw acid forming in Dean's eyes. It was a bitter color wash that looked like laughter, but nothing was funny. Even when summer came, after school ended and summer school began (Sam went to take AP classes, Dean to make up for his failing grades) Dean still slept over most nights at other people's houses. He sometimes made and ate dinner with Sam and then vanished until morning. Sam watched as layer after layer of bruises and scrapes appeared on Dean's skin. He wanted to ask where they came from but every time he tried Dean clammed up and told him to mind his own business. Sam had almost forgotten what it was like to look at Dean and see something that didn't alarm him.
“Mildly, but not really. Why?”
'Sorry! You surprised me.'
Dean gets progressively worse all day. It's as if he's moving in slow motion, watching himself do everything wrong, but he's powerless to change it. Mistake after mistake, delay after delay. He can feel it all building up behind his eyes as a stabbing headache. It's the usual panic he gets himself into, but it's coming on slowly. Dean can't stop thinking of his father's face in the dream; slightly blurred, vague, as if Dean is forgetting what he looked like.
'I actually know the perfect place. Do you want to come?'
John, Bobby, and Ellen followed, and John called out, 'Dean!' Dean turned and Castiel turned with him. 'Remember what I said about running off, son. I want you to be able to see me, Uncle Bobby, and Aunt Ellen at all times. You too, Castiel. Understood?' he finished sternly. Castiel nodded solemnly and Dean replied, 'Got it, dad.'
'Barely. No dice, Cas, gimme the keys.'
Jimmy locked eyes with him. “We did. You always made sure we would.”
The cabin, usually steeped in shadows, was awash with light, excepting the children's room. Castiel, awake and fearful, wasn't calmed by the sounds of his sleeping sibling and the other children curled up on mats around the room. The flickering light coming in under the door was almost aggressive in its brightness, and the deep adult voices rising and falling with alarming energy were overwhelming his senses. Pavlovian adrenaline popped in his veins.
“Yeah, we just brought the basics.” Sam indicated the trailer hitched on the back of the car as Hyun-Sook led them to the front door. “Thanks so much for coming to walk us through. Our old landlord just left the key under the mat.”
All through the winter of that year and into the early spring, the flashlight beams woke Sam up. At first it was strange, invasive, and interesting, but soon it became comforting. His brother and his friend lit up the night sky, flung their hearts into the dark chasm of nighttime, cast their thoughts into each others' windows like fishing lines baited with hope. Sam would stare sleepily at the lights and shadows making shapes on his walls and fall asleep to the silent sound of Dean mattering to someone. Sam didn't know Morse code but he thought he understood all the same.
'No, that's okay. What's up?' Dean puts his bowl down. It is a bad time, but Castiel looks frazzled and exhausted and wild-eyed.
John eventually caved under the weight of Sam's enthusiasm, eased along by Sam's willingness to write down Jessica's address and home phone number. When Sam told Dean, Dean smiled and told him to leave enough food for the rest of Jess' family. Knowing Dean's fondness for whatever togetherness could be salvaged for family occasions and holidays, Sam was glad he wasn't upset.
Sam wasn't surprised. Anna rarely hung out with them anymore. When they were younger she had spent a lot of time with them. Even if she was a girl and did things differently, she was very nice and Sam liked her a lot. She was soft-spoken and she never let anyone kill spiders, preferring to capture them in cups and take them outside, for which Sam was secretly glad. Lately, though, Sam noticed that she said strange things sometimes and that it made people uncomfortable. He didn't want Cas to be upset, so he didn't ask why.
'What?' Dean is thrown by the abrupt change.
'Hey, Cas.'
'You KISSED me!' Dean didn't even know what he was saying anymore.
'Is that what this is about? You know I didn't have a choice about leaving! You ignored me for a week before I left! You told me not to bother calling!'
Cas left the Christmas card from his family on the table next to the ones from Bobby and Ellen and a few of John's work buddies and they retreated to Dean's room, closing the door behind them. They didn't turn on the lights. The room was lit by streetlights and the brightness of the snow outside. Fat flakes started falling, patting against the window almost inaudibly. Dean heard Cas sigh happily, and the two of them flumped down wordlessly on Dean's bed, twisting to face one another. Dean threw an arm over Cas, mostly to obscure his view of the sweater. Cas wriggled around a bit to get comfortable.
