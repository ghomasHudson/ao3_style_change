Inias sat down on the chair opposite Cas, "We should talk."
"Cas, what are you doing here?" Dean asked turning around in time to see the angel walk into light, "they're just humans. Not vamps, or werewolves or any of the crazy shit we've faced. Sammy is being held captive by a bunch of fucking psycho humans Cas it's not a big deal. And anyways aren't you supposed to be on a God hunt?" Dean zipped up his bag and swung it over his left shoulder.
"We found a pearl that's supposed to reach into our heart's desires, and grant our wishes or some bullshit, and dad just... appeared. I don't fully understand it," Dean said, scratching his head.
After a moment of silence, Sam shook his head, "You're out of your mind, Dean."
Dean smiled weakly, "Cas, it's 1 am."
"Cas, Jack, get Dean back to the motel and heal him. I'll stay with the kids until the police arrive," Sam ordered. Jack agreed and helped Cas move Dean into the Impala, and they drove off.
"Tell me about it. Although I must say I prefer this version of Lucifer over our own," Cas replied thoughtfully.
Cas was bitter, and pissed when he answered, "Dean was mine the moment I rescued him from hell."
"We need to go around the town and find the person who matches this handwriting but... we already know who it is so can we just skip all this?" Dean asked.
"Will you stop trying to talk to me?" Dean asked in the same condescending tone.
After a while, Castiel replied, "well... with the amount of pain you suffered, you'll probably lose your mind or... die."
Something in Sam's brain clicked, "hold up, your demons
Cas nodded. Suddenly there was a burst of thunder and lightning and it began to pour. Cas looked up as the water splattered on him. Dean looked up too, very confused, as it had been bright and sunny only a few minutes ago and now it looked like someone really pissed off God. They both brought their heads down at the same time.
"You have questions," Cas said.
Dean went back to his bathroom, kneeled over the toilet and let out last night’s dinner. He didn’t hear Cas calling his name. He didn’t see Cas fast walking, almost jogging, to get to Dean’s side. He didn’t feel Cas wrap his arms around Dean, holding him upright as Dean emptied his guts. Dean closed his eyes, feeling extremely light-headed and weak. Cas held him, not saying a word. Dean’s head lulled and fell back into Cas's chest.
"You remember this place?" Dean asked, trying to smile, but every time he looked into Cas's eyes, he just saw a broken angel.
"Dean, the story usually ends in-"
John looked at Cas, smirking, "Well then, you hear that? He's not
Castiel stared out from the balcony, admiring the city below when he heard some footsteps following close behind.
"You're not afraid?" Lucifer asked, surprised for the first time.
Dean finished his burger and pushed his plate away slightly.
Cas waited patiently until Dean came to a stop, "This isn't about Michael at all. This is about how
Cas didn't say anything, but he took Dean's other hand and let his head rest on Dean's shoulder. Sam watched Cas relax, probably for the first time in years and gently smiled to himself.
"I only said that to Inias to settle their nerves. Dean, I got you back because I needed you back. Haven't the past few weeks proved that?"
(See the end of the chapter for
"I can't believe I agreed to this," Dean complained putting on his 2nd layer of clothing. Sam laughed behind him as he and Jack started rummaging through Lucifer's old book collection. Cas approached him worried and uneasy,
by Brian Greene. I think I saw that book on Lucifer's shelves one day so you might wanna just check that out," Chloe said speaking increasingly faster.
"Your soul felt pure the way it always does. It felt warm and comforting. For all the pain you've been through Dean, your soul has always remained true," Cas said as he watched Dean go in and out of consciousness.
Dean softly smiled to himself, "Yeah, we thought the same thing but he inherited more of Cas's traits than our Lucifer- and thank god for that."
"A few months ago, you were hexed. Not your normal hex. This witch, she transferred this dark power into you. It started to kill you and turn you into a killer, like the Mark of Cain. Cas agreed to take on the power instead. It doesn't affect angels in the same way it affects humans, he's able to control it. We couldn't destroy the power you see, we didn't know how. We still don't. So we got Rowena to transfer the power from you to Cas. The spell she used… it had… side effects. One was that you couldn't remember Cas at all. All 10 years of memories were… I guess deleted or blocked. It was like you had amnesia, Dean. You had no recollection of him. Cas and I agreed this was the best. The power was inside you, and now it's inside Cas. When you and Cas come together, the power feeds off you, and it grows. The more it grows, the closer to the end of the world we get. I really mean it, Dean. I mean blood in the water, snakes popping out of nowhere, fire, flood, the whole thing. That's what Rowena predicted and it's better not to take a chance on these things. They don't end well for us. So anyway, we thought… if you didn't remember Cas, you would have no reason to want to see him. But then you started seeing him. Cas was so infuriated when I spoke to him. He said he's doing everything in his power to stay away from you, but it's like the universe won’t let him. Cas misses you, Dean. He misses you so much. But you can't see him. Do you understand?" Sam ended.
"Don't think too much, or your head will explode," Sam said coming up behind him. He sat next to Dean with his food.
"Basically to summarise, it's the same fucking spell. But kid, you know how we use Archangel grace for the spell, right? Well here, it says you can use some of the human soul to kick start the spell," Dean said, his excitement slowly coming to a stop.
"Sam, can I ask you something?" Dean asked, sitting down opposite his brother.
Dean looked at Cas, "You gave so much to these people, and they would just let you go? That's so shitty."
"What was it like having all those people call you "your majesty"?" Cas asked.
"Magnus seems cool. As do the rest of them. Dean, you should rest. I'll be back in the morning," Cas said, leaving Dean to his thoughts, which was never a good idea. When Sam came out of the bathroom, Dean went and cleaned up. Before passing out, Dean slid his gun under his pillow, making sure Sam didn't get a glimpse of it.
"Shut up, Dean. Anyways let's talk about you and Cas. Things look like they're going well," Sam switched the conversation.
Cas took a few steps forward, "you
The next time Dean saw Cas was at another meeting. Cas didn't talk to Dean and Dean pretended like Cas didn't exist. Sam agreed to bring in his army to their camp so they can discuss everything face to face, but of course, this would take a few days.
"Anyways man what's going on with you and the detective? You guys together?" Dean asked sipping his coffee slowly, careful not to burn his mouth.
"I love you, Dean," Cas said. It was unexpected, but somehow still felt natural. Dean was, of course, taken aback.
to Cas then they wouldn't be in this mess. Castiel went over to Sam and pressed his fingers on his forehead healing him. Sam thanked him and asked if he was okay to which Castiel just sighed and nodded.
"Cas? Everything okay?" Dean asked, falling behind to walk beside the angel.
"Every time I looked at that kid, I saw you. He's just like you, it drove me insane, Cas. He did that stupid head tilt thing you do when you're confused, he has your face, your features, your smile, your eyes, he's practically your kid and he
Cas stammered, "I- a glass of water, thank you." She nodded, smiled and walked away.
Cas closed his eyes putting his palm in his face, "I should have known David would pull something like this. He's always been so... resistant."
"Dude, where did you go?" Sam asked.
Dean smiled back, his eyes a little sad and envious.
"Hey," Cas said, sliding in to sit behind the Winchester brother.
"I am
Cas glared at him, "just because you're my friend, doesn't mean you get a free pass. I'm the one in charge here, remember? You're going back with Sam."
to be you," Dean was slow and careful. He hated that they even had to have this talk, but Dean trusted Cas to do the right thing.
Lucifer almost choked on his water, "We- uh- it's complicated…" Dean frowned giving him the
"Cas? You- uh- you got your ears on?" Dean started his prayer, "I just- I need to tell you some things. Things I should have told you before, things you deserve to know."
But of course, Cas knew what he meant, "oh, it was a gradual thing. I liked you since the day I met you, from hell to that barn when you first stabbed me. And then I think the more I got to know you, the more I fell in love with you. It was gradual and inevitable."
Castiel saw the glistening white pearl resting on the top of the map table. He recognised it almost immediately, a Chinese pearl also commonly known as Baozhu. It was supposed to grant your heart's deepest desires, and Cas was confused as to why the Winchester brothers had it in their possession. Cas entered the living area of the bunker and was immediately stunned. It was like a massive slap to the face- John Winchester himself was standing near the bookshelf.
Sam slowly nodded, "well, it would make sense, I suppose. Dean and I have been stumped over this case for a while. So, tell me more about, uh, your world. We need to know what we're dealing with."
Cas didn't let go of their hands.
"Red roses, huh? Dean, we should talk about all this," Cas said. He looked at the roses. Red roses. Love, longing, desire.
Jody nodded, "More than okay. We run this place!" Cas looked at Dean, eyes shining with so much hope it was overwhelming.
"But you're okay with me?" Dean asked already regretting his question.
Dean knew he was right. He was finally home, with his brother and his angel. Cas was the most powerful being in this entire camp and Dean knew that.
breaking down. Cas looked over at Sam and Jack, who were both confused and scared.
"Uh, thanks, you sure?" Dean asked as he took the flowers. Cas nodded. He just knew.
As the roar of the storm became louder and louder, the rain continued to thump down on them at a tremendous force. Dean winced at every crack of thunder.
"Cas," Dean said, taking a long breath. Cas looked broken and exhausted with red eyes as if he had been crying all night long.
"Don't be stupid," Cas said, offering a hand. Dean slapped his hand away.
Magnus smirked, his cat eyes returning as if to say "yes". Alec gently kissed him before he pulled away.
"Don't you ever do that again," Dean grumbled, holding Cas tighter.
This got Cas's attention but he just rolled his eyes anyway, "Maybe one day you can show me. Anyways, you should sleep."
Winchester," a woman's voice rang throughout the room. Dean's eyes locked with Sam's and Sam nodded telling his brother not to try anything stupid. Dean put his hands up in surrender and turned around to see a woman, probably a few years younger than him, with bloodlust in her eyes and a gun pointed directly at Dean's head.
Dean's eyes lit up as he cracked a smile, "it's a date."
I hope you guys enjoyed reading this little fic!! I hope after spn ends, one of the characters could make a surprise appearance in Lucifer (ahem Castiel singing) bc that would be epic!
"So, your best friend is an angel?" Clary asked with wide excited eyes.
"Dean?" A voice all too familiar called out his name.
"Monsters I get, but humans? Humans are complicated," Dean said laying his three knives onto the table without a care.
"I'm gonna pass out any second," Dean muttered as he stomped down the staircase, two bags in his hands. Dean wasn't sure when but recently he started to carry Cas's bags as well and it had become a thing now. Cas followed close behind, "Dean, you have five broken ribs, cuts and bruises everywhere, and I need to heal you."
"Yeah, I know. How are you holding up?" Dean asked concerned.
"Yes you did," Cas replied after a while making sure Dean heard him.
"Hey, I heard yelling, what happened?" Sam asked concerned.
"Cas, what
I hope you enjoyed the story, please do let me know your thoughts!
"Well, it worked, you pissed him off, job well done. Look, Cas, could you go out and get some food? Maybe Chinese? I'm gonna go back, and try to patch things up with dad," Dean said, turning to face the door.
Sam stood up and stretched, "you're right. I'll leave in a bit. How are you holding up Cas? All of this with Lucifer, it can't be easy for you either."
"Usually, the prince finds Cinderella and then they kiss. That's how the story ends. I mean they get married too but that’s like a fast forward skip you know?" Dean said quietly rambling into the night, avoiding Cas's eyes at all costs.
-------------------
"What is it, Dean?" Cas tilted his head.
"So, you're not- uh… joining me tonight?" Dean asked, suddenly turning red. It shouldn't be this uncomfortable and weird to ask after what they went through but it was and Dean hated it. He hated the sudden tension between them and pretending to go back to normal around their friends. He hated that he didn't feel comfortable enough to hold Cas's hand or be close in the way he was used to. He hated all of it.
the kind of crap he's done!" Dean started, throwing his hands into the air in frustration, "do you know, when I was around nineteen, I was fucking around with guys, experimenting and shit. Then when my dad found me, he released all of hell on me. He said some nasty shit, man, and straightened me the fuck up."
Dean, Jack and Lucifer entered the precinct with Lucifer chanting "GOOD MORNING" to everyone he saw. Chloe Decker was on the phone when she saw Lucifer and hung up, "you're bringing them along?"
"She did it. Rowena figured out how to reverse the spell so that she can destroy it."
"I'm not five, Cas-" Another boom. Dean ducked his head as if he was expecting something to fly out at him. Cas put his hand on Dean's back steadily.
"Oh hell yes-" Cas and Dean answered simultaneously.
"Yeah alright, shut up. Just try to get some rest alright? I'm gonna be right here," Cas said. Dean nestled into the angel, wrapping his legs around Cas and placing his head on his Cas's chest.
"Maybe later. I'm just trying to figure out some stuff. Why are you here, Dean?" Cas asked.
"John, it's...
Cas only stared at him, "
thing for you," Cas grumbled. Dean snaked his hands around Cas's waist inside his coat.
Inias walked in a few minutes later.
"You should- uh- get some rest," Cas said.
Rowena came and patched Dean up like it was nothing because really at this point, she's used to it.
"What is it, my birthday?" Dean asked relishing in the smell of freshly cooked waffles.
"Dean-" Castiel began but was quickly interrupted.
When the movie ended, Dean didn't want to wake Cas up. Sam offered him a blanket and Dean gently placed the blanket over Cas, careful not to disturb him. Dean returned to his room, with his shirt covered in Cas's scent.
Cas looked sympathetic. Dean was comfortable talking about the numerous amounts of girls he's been with but never talked about guys. This was a first, and Cas saw how truly
"Damnit," Sam cursed. He led the way through the forest with Dean and Cas following behind him. Every time they heard a noise, Dean swished his gun at it.
Cas didn’t turn around, he didn’t want to face Dean. He couldn’t.
Dean looked at her, speechless. But he saw it. The pain of losing your loved ones. It was written all over her face. He felt everyone's eyes drilling into him.
"Look, I'm Alec, this is Magnus. My sister Isabelle, my brother Jace and his girlfriend Clary. Now, put down the damn gun, we're here to
Sam smiled, "No, we don't. You just need some sleep, man. We've been on some back to back hunts. It's probably taking a toll on you."
Cas moved his hand from Dean's shoulder down to his arm, "when we get back to headquarters, I'll make sure you have some proper food in you. You're safe with me, I promise."
Song for the chapter:
"You call that
The wound healed perfectly, good as new. Dean looked at his hand, forming a fist. He no longer felt any pain.
Meanwhile, Sam and Cas were going through the 2nd set of supernatural mythology and it was driving Sam up the fucking walls.
"Hi."
"What?" The annoyed voice answered.
Castiel spent the next few days trying to get to know the people in the camp. He and Dean didn't speak much, so he decided to distract himself. Castiel always loved listening to people around him. Everyone had a story, a beginning, something that caused a massive shift in their path or changed who they are, and Castiel was always intrigued in their stories. There weren't as many kids in this camp, but Cas spoke and became friends with them nonetheless. Some of these kids refused to believe Cas was an angel, it seemed impossible. It was when Castiel healed a girl's cuts on her hands, that was when they believed. Dean watched from the corner of the room. He wanted to hate the angel because that would make it so much easier. It would be easier to despise him than to love him.
Cas intertwined their fingers together, always surprised by how well their hands fit together, "Sleep, Dean." Dean grumbled something like "kiss me" or at least that's what Cas heard because he bent a little to kiss Dean's lips softly. Dean smiled and closed his eyes, resting his heavy head on Cas. Cas watched and waited as Dean drifted off to another deep sleep for the second time that day. He brought up the covers over the man, making sure Dean was warm but not too warm. Dean sighed a little in his sleep as he swung his arms around Cas's waist and snuggled closer. Maybe their lives were a bit magical indeed.
"You good?" Cas asked.
"Of course, I will look after Dean every single day. You don't have to worry about us. Dean and I have each other."
"How long what?"
regret this, mark my words." That was it. When Dean Winchester made a promise, he kept it. And now David's fate was sealed. David backed away a little, stunned at how quickly Dean snapped and turned to stand up for Cas. Cas, meanwhile, sighed, pulling Dean away.
Dean rolled his eyes, "Yeah yeah sure."
"What the
If Dean wasn't confused before, he sure was now, "Of course, I am?"
After a beat, the angel muttered, "Okay, I promise. I just wish there was another way."
After a moment, the gunfire ceased, and everything was silent. Castiel loosened his grip on Dean but Dean could feel him breathing heavily down his back as though he had just run a marathon.
Dean's expression shifted, "wait, you were looking for me this whole time?"
"We'll get him back. Let's go," Clary interjected, and turned towards the door, not waiting for a reply. Cas saw Alec pull out his bow and arrow before following Clary out the door, always ready for a fight.
"I don't- I don't know-" Dean stammered, lost.
"So the demon is dead?" Sam asked, letting Cas check Dean again.
Dean found the rift and stared at it for a few seconds. He knew he should go back, and find Cas and convince him to come back home, but he was running out of time. Dean looked back at the forest, and he heard a growl, a deep low growl that he recognised. Dean panicked and left through the rift which closed behind him.
The pain and grief overwhelms Castiel as he tried to move on.
Cas shook his head, waking himself up from his little stupor and chased after Dean. When Cas went outside, Dean was nowhere in sight. And what was worse, the Impala was still parked, unmoved.
"Oh thank you! I wasn't aware you knew your cars," Lucifer replied looking up from his menu, "what's yours?"
"It isn't, dad. Cas is our friend. You know demons exist, well, angels do too. And so does God, but that's a different story for a whole other day," Sam said, with a faint smile.
Cas breathed, backing away slowly, "I want you to understand, I am still your friend. I just don't want to lose you again. Every time we get… close, the universe tries to pull us apart. And it almost did. That day, when the world fell apart. I almost lost you then. That can't happen again, Dean. Claire lost Kaia, I could have lost you."
Cas sighed and continued, "I know we've been beating around the bush for quite some time now. But I know you feel what I feel. Still, I would never pressure you into anything, Dean. Tell me what you want me to be to you." Cas was so gentle and delicate, Dean didn't quite expect that. He finally looked up and stared back.
"Who are you?" An unfamiliar voice replied from what seemed to be inside the gate.
Cas was grinning like an idiot, "I know. I know you love me. I know you care. I know you would never hurt me, and what happened between us, that's long gone, forgotten and forgiven. I don't want you to think about that spell, or what you did. It's in the past. Focus on us, now."
The door burst open, and it was Jody, "Sam's here!"
written in Cas's handwriting and Dean immediately knew where the story was going. Sam found him and pat his brother's back.
Dean tried talking to Cas but every time he did, Cas walked away and refused to look him in the eye, leaving the hunter very confused and lost. It got so bad that Cas couldn't even stand to be in the same
Dean smiled, "don't worry about it, Cas. We'll go at your pace. Hey, look at me." Dean cupped Cas's face and brought the angel's eyes back up to meet his.
Dean rolled his eyes and sat down. He bit his lips as he did when he was nervous, and stared at the wooden table in sudden fascination, "I- uh- ok, so this is going to sound crazy, but I saw this guy at this coffee shop a few days ago. And then before that at a motel. He, uh, I dunno, he was very kind and I wanted to ask him out for dinner but he was so- he seemed so-"
"May I come in?" Cas asked, politely.
"Your eyes are fucking blue," Dean muttered without really thinking.
Castiel turned to Sam, "Sam, remember when you came back from hell without your soul and the way I found out you were soulless?"
Sam gulped, knowing this was bad. This was
"Alright fine. But tomorrow we get straight back to work," the older Winchester said with a growl as he left the room.
"Always a pleasure, my dear," Rowena cooed. Sam let go of Cas. and Cas turned to look at Dean who was staring like an idiot with his mouth hanging open.
"I'm sorry. Tell me what I can do to fix this. To earn your trust back. To get your lo- to get you back," Dean said, desperately.
Cas re-entered the room closing the door behind him and walked up to Dean slowly.
Ella muttered a small "I figured." She excused herself leaving Dean and Jack with Lucifer who suggested they should go out for lunch, again his treat and get some food for Sam and Cas back at his apartment. Dean was a little hesitant but agreed and they headed off in Lucifer's gorgeous black 1961 Corvette.
"Hey, fellas," Dean said, approaching them.
"Got it. He's in an abandoned warehouse just outside of town," Alec said confidently.
"Me too. I didn't want to lose Emily and Natasha too."
“Stop!” Dean yelled. Cas flinched and stepped back.
the Cinderella story."
Sam waited until Cas brought his eyes up to meet Sam's. Cas also shut the book he was reading and sighed.
Cas never pressed further after that. But when the storms had come, striking the bunker intensely, Cas always stayed with Dean in Dean's little room, telling him stories about Gabriel being an annoying prick of a brother, or asking what Dean wanted for his next birthday.
"Yes. I put him in line; he won't be bothering us again," Cas said. His eyes fell to Dean who was smiling endearingly.
Sam opened the bottle and watched as the human soul simmered down and enter the mixture they had prepared. When the blue glimmer reached the bowl, it instantly created a crack in the open air in front of them facing the balcony. The rift was gleaming golden and stood there, silencing the entire room.
"Guilty," Lucifer chirped from the corner. Cas shook his head in disappointment and went over to Dean. He pressed two fingers onto Dean's forehead healing his cuts instantly.
Ever since we found you, Castiel has been different. He's been distracted and too… attached to you. You think we haven't noticed that shiny ring on your finger?"
"By the looks of it, apparently…" Dean just stared at the black pancakes. You couldn't even call them pancakes at this point.
"Hello?" Sam said to the phone. He immediately stood up and started pacing back and forth as he spoke into the phone hurriedly. Dean observed him.
"Cas, listen, we'll talk about all this later. You need to sleep. Take my bed, just fucking sleep, please," Dean said. For the most part, Cas didn't sleep. He slept sometimes to recharge, or waste time when the brothers were also sleeping, or because he liked it. But he didn't really need to. But now, Dean could tell Cas
"It's not that easy, Dean."
"So, what's the plan for tomorrow?" the Nephilim boy asked.
"Anyway, you boys must be exhausted. We can talk with Sam tomorrow and figure everything out. No rush, you know, just the end of the world," Donna smirked. Dean finished his plate quickly, following Claire out to clean the plates.
"Castiel, an honour. Magnus Bane," Magnus said, shaking Cas's hands.
" Sam asked.
-just enjoy the damn fluff
"Dean doesn't remember any that though. I erased his memory so that he didn't have any recollection of meeting me in hell. We officially met at a barn, and then Dean went stabbed me in the chest,"
Sam slammed his cup down, "Damnit, Dean. Can you please get your thick head out of your ass for a second. Cas is hurting right now. He just lost his son, and he's convinced we don't care about him. Cas is family. He's been a part of our family for a long time. Just please talk to him, and fix this." Sam was furious, and he had every right to be.
"This isn't
"Dean, you know Sam and I fully support you, right? Although I can't speak for your father. But what you're feeling, it's valid. You're allowed to love whoever you want, as long as you're happy, and he/she or they, treat you right." It was the words that Dean needed to hear all his life.
"Cas, if you're fighting, I want to fight with you. I don't want to come off as this clingy bitch. I want to help. I'm useful you know, not just a pretty face. I want to prove I was worth saving," Dean said.
Dean grinned, "Yeah, I was a bit of a little shit back then."
This is the official end of the story. I know it's a little soft for a finale but I'll be adding a crazy deancas centred sequel for the stans and some extra bonus scenes I had written for bants.
Sam smiled to himself, "right back at you. See you around!"
"You've been out of it, lately. I mean I know your memories came back and that must have been overwhelming, but you know, Cas will be okay. We'll figure this out, we always do," Sam said, almost as if he was trying to convince himself rather than his brother.
"Thanks," Dean replied. Cas let go, gave a small smile, and wandered out of the room. Dean finally let out the breath he had been holding onto the entire time.
Cas panicked, and snatched Dean's arm, "be careful."
“Dean, listen to me. What you did, it was the spell. I forgive you. Do you hear me? I forgive you, Dean. I can’t watch you rip yourself apart like this. Let me help,” Cas said.
"I got it! I found the fucking spell!" He threw punches into the air.
This is more like a filler because I know we all just want the ending lmao
"Dean, may I talk to you in private?" Cas asked, indicating to the ladies. Sam had gone oddly quiet on the phone. Dean simply huffed and followed Castiel out of the room, slamming the door shut behind him.
The little girl handed Cas a feather, his feather, "I found this in the corridor, the feather you gave Dean. You should have it back, it belongs to you." Cas could feel Dean was watching him intensely.
He stopped when Cas placed a cool hand on Dean's face. It was gentle and tender, and Dean leaned in, desperate for Cas's touch. It reminded Dean of his mother's touch and her love.
for a while. It doesn't matter to me, Dean. I'm a celestial being, I honestly don't care who you sleep around with. If your dad gives you a tough time tomorrow, I'll be there to defend you, and keep you safe- the way I always am."
Dean blinked, "You're telling me the fucking book was hexed and now we're living in some fairytale?? And you have a
"Oh, you're up. I- uh- got you breakfast?" Dean handed Cas the glass of juice first which Cas graciously thanked him for.
"Jimmy, right? It's Dean, we met once before. Anyways, uh, weird meeting you here," Dean said, with a small smile. He couldn't stop staring at the man's brilliant and vibrant blue eyes.
Jody found Sam and Dean bent over books, talking in hushed voices in Dean's little room. When Jody told Sam that their hunt had gone sideways, Sam pulled out his phone and called Cas but again, no response. Dean watched Sam and Jody worriedly.
the angel.
Dean shook his head, "We have nothing to figure out. We're not friends anymore, remember?"
"We can't work it out if you won't get your big head out of your ass," Cas hissed. Dean gulped.
Just then, the bell rang out and Lucifer stepped out from the elevator, "So, Maze decided to skip out on all the fun because all this interdimensional mystery-solving was too much for her- Oh, you seem happy." Lucifer smiled when he saw Dean grinning from ear to ear.
"How did you survive the nights though?" Claire asked, "It was pretty damn cold on some nights. Cas said something about sharing body heat or some bullshit but-"
The sun usually rose high and mighty in LA but today, it was gloomy and quiet, much like how Sam felt.
"He's just asleep, thank god. I guess we're going on a witch hunt," Sam grinned grabbing the sword tightly. Dean didn't argue, he could really use some action and a good fight and maybe killing a witch could help him snap out of his incredibly sour mood.
"Cas, just- if anything does happen to me, look after Sam and Jack yeah?" Dean said pulling away from the glass and straightening his back. His eyes found Cas, the way they always do. It was like his eyes were fucking magnetized to Cas's or something; he just couldn't stop it.
"It's fucking huge but at least it's in English," he muttered holding it in both hands.
"Ah, Dean! You made it!" Lucifer said standing outside the door with a friendly smile.
"Well, we figured since you're… you know Lucifer, you may know something about travelling between realities. We do know a spell that can create a door to our universe but we need archangel grace for it," Sam said watching them still unsure about all this. Lucifer was still Lucifer no matter which universe you were in. And anyone with a lick of sense will know not to trust the devil.
Castiel stood up going paler than ever.
"I'm truly sorry, Dean," Cas said, starting to leave, but Dean quickly grabbed his arm.
"Sorry, but have I done something to offend you?" John asked, smugly. His tone was dark and dangerous. Dean knew it all too well. It was the same tone John used when he was gravely upset with Dean, and Dean immediately knew he was fucked.
during an apocalypse for God's sake!"
While Lucifer gave Jack some leftover pasta from a few nights ago, Cas walked over to Dean.
Sam sighed, "you don't think I tried? I tried telling him you were dead. I told him to move on. But Cas knew deep down, you were still alive. Cas never gave up on you. You weren't there. Dean, it's like he was so sure you were alive, it's not like he went crazy or that he was in denial. He just knew. He put together this army, this place. He built friendships, relationships, brought people together, and gave them hope- even when he was running low himself. He found out everything he could about Michael and his monsters. He sent out teams to fight monsters, save people and a separate team to look for you. He had everything together. That's why people here respect him and look to him for guidance and support. Cas is their light. Cas saved them and gave them a reason to fight. When I lost hope, Cas never did."
" Dean asked, suddenly picking up on the conversation.
There was a weird silence on the other side of the phone for a few seconds before the angel answered.
"Yes, I would. And you admire Chloe?" Castiel threw the question back at him.
"Jack, stay with the rest of the hostages, and call the police," Cas ordered as he strained his eyes away from Dean, and Jack obliged.
"Wait, how much will this hurt?" Dean asked, laying himself down on Lucifer's extremely comfortable and soft couch.
are too afraid to let me go."
"Thanks a lot, Chloe. You're all good?" Sam asked, noticing the panic in her voice.
"You forgot his water," Dean growled. She looked at him unpleasantly, right on time to see Dean visibly hold Cas's hands in his. She stared at him for a while, and then apologised, and fast-walked away.
In the other room, Dean stretched his arms over his head. He pulled out a plain burgundy T-shirt and stumbled into the bathroom.
I'm gonna fight"
Dean stared down as his clothes which had magically transformed back into his flannel and jeans, "Aw man, I already miss being a prince. I bet I made a hot prince."
"Did you
Dean nodded, "Do you have an evil step-mom?"
"Damnit Cas, I said no," Dean whipped around to find Castiel inches away from him.
"I didn't think you would feel its presence, humans usually don't unless… unless they're bonded," Cas said, finishing his sentence quietly.
During the apocalypse, when Dean had been completely alone, it was almost unbearable. The sound, the lightning, and the thunder shook him more than he would like to admit. But this time around, it was different. He had Cas.
"Is my soul still intact?" Dean asked. Cas pushed the chair away and sat next to Dean on the couch. He didn't bother leaving any space between them the way he normally would.
Cas sighed, "Yes, she's rather nasty."
“What if I puke again?” Dean asked.
Dean squeezed his eyes shut, afraid that if he opened them and saw Cas, he would be puking his bile acids out to the toilet again.
It's really the end. Thank you for reading!!
"I am," But before Dean could open his mouth, Cas continued, "I know, I'll be careful. You should go."
"You're awake!" He smiled and then proceeded to reduce the AC.
"Don't you dare tell Sam we had this conversation," Dean muttered into the angel's ears, "he's going to think I'm a sappy 12-year-old."
Cas eyed him, "Did you think I would give up?"
Cas and Jack placed Dean down on the mattress. Cas gently took off Dean's shirt in one swift movement. The blood had stopped pouring out of his chest but the wound was there, larger than normal.
"Of course, Jack and I can't volunteer and neither can Lucifer because we are celestial beings, so it will have to be either you or Dean," the angel said shifting looks between the two Winchester brothers.
Dean slammed his hands on the wheel, pissed off, "
This is the official end to the story!
"Cas, I'm... scared. What if I can't get you guys back home?" Dean asked quietly, trying to keep his focus on Cas, and only Cas.
Cas grabbed his hand, "I'm okay."
"We found you," Dean spluttered speechlessly. They were finally safe.
Sam pulled away, gripping Dean's shoulders, "How are you alive? Oh my god, Dean, you're alive."
"One sorry isn't going to make up for how much suffering I've endured because of you," Cas said darkly.
Isabelle looked at him sympathetically.
Inspired by a tweet I saw on twitter, this is set a day after the events of 15x03. This is set in Castiel's POV.
"You're just fucking lying to yourself. Come on, you said it yourself before, you only got me back to use me as your weapon, right? So come on! Use me!"
"You sure you don't want something stronger?" Magnus asked, a small smile playing on his lips. He waved his hands and the bottle of beer, transformed into a bottle of vodka. Dean gazed at it and then back at Magnus.
It was late at night, around 10 pm when Sam and Dean got the news that the trucks were rolling in. Dean sprinted down the hallways to their garage, watching and waiting to see who would be left standing and walking on their two feet. Sam waited behind his brother tensely. Two men got off the first truck looking like they fought a hellhound, bloodied head to toe. The second truck came to a stop and out came a young girl with black curls, around Claire's age, and the angel in the trenchcoat.
"Dean, I know this is all weird, but you have to play this through, okay?" Sam said carefully.
"Goodnight, Sam," Cas said. He watched Sam walk away, very happy and pleased with himself for making him laugh. He hadn't heard Sam laugh like that in a very long time, and it warmed the angel's heart every time he heard it.
After a few minutes of burning eyes and brain cells, Dean yelped. Jack spiked his head up worried, only to find Dean beaming like a madman.
The evening continued in shimmering lights. The brothers stuck together, talking to guests and trying to be as respectful as they could. Sam could fit in no problem, but Dean found it difficult not to make stupid remarks to pop culture or a pun here and there. Needless to say, it was exhausting. A few beautiful ladies in flowy dresses spoke with the brothers, flirting with Dean especially. Dean spoke with them politely, however, he did not flirt back. His eyes kept wandering to the door as if he was expecting someone to walk through it.
Dean, Sam, John and Cas sat at the table with food laid out in front of them. It was a little awkward what with Cas trying to kill John with silent daggers and all. Cas apologised and kept quiet. John mostly interacted with his sons, trying to understand what he missed. Jack was brought up, and the table fell into silence.
"Dean that's them," Castiel said pointing from Dean's shoulder. He nodded and they headed towards the detective's desk.
Sam, meanwhile, swooped under the wendigo, lighting the flare as he moved. He threw the lighted flare at the deformed creature, who wailed and screamed as it burned. The fire was blinding white.
you," Cas asked.
liked the way Cas's fingers perfectly intertwined with his. Castiel's hand was rough from all the thousands of years he had spent scavenging around the Earth, but it was still gentle all the same.
Sam stared at him.
"Dean, no." Cas put a hand on Dean's knee to which Dean flinched. Cas slowly retreated his hand, now utterly perplexed by Dean's secluded behaviour.
"Cas, I'm tired. Please just let this go," Dean begged. He turned around to find the angel only inches away from him. Cas put his hand on Dean's shoulder firmly but gently, and went, "okay, Dean. But when you're ready to talk, I'm here." He knew Dean. The man had mastered the art of pushing away his feelings into the depths of his mind, and Cas knew he would have to be extremely patient if he wanted Dean to be more open with him. They were never eloquent at communication but lately, Cas noticed Dean was more straightforward.
Sam and Dean trekked through the forest, leaves crunching in their wake.
"You don't have to worry," Cas said, reassuringly as he noticed Dean's tense pose, "I've known about you and...
Dean, Jack and Lucifer entered the nearest burger joint they could find. A few heads turned to admire Lucifer in his suit and Dean realized his new feathered friend was extremely over-dressed. They took a seat at the booths with Jack sliding in next to Dean and Lucifer sitting opposite the both of them. Jack was flipping through the menu asking what a kid's special. Lucifer explained and then Jack proceeded to ask why Lucifer wasn't out solving cases with Chloe and Lucifer just replied with "she assigned detective
"Hello, Dean. I have to go," the black-haired man said, turning around.
Dean asked Cas to bring some dinner for their new friends/guests and Cas just replied with a text going
Rise Up- Zayde Wolf
The angel exited the basement and laid Dean down on the soft earth below them.
"Come here, and sit on my lap, angel," Dean said. Cas did just as he was ordered, swinging his legs around Dean.
2 days passed by since they found out how to open the portal using the human soul. Neither Sam nor Dean brought up the topic of who was going to risk their life this time but instead, the group set out to collect the rest of the ingredients: the Seal of Solomon, the fruit from the tree of life, and the blood of the Most Holy Man (this was the most difficult to find because nobody knew where to even start looking... up until Chloe Decker stormed into the room with a gigantic book).
Dean glared at Cas, "We don't need to put more lives at risk."
Sam observed Dean but before he could say anything, Dean spoke, "I broke him. I said he was the reason everything went wrong in our lives, that he was poison. Shit, Sam, I said I could never love him, that I didn't WANT to love him. Why did I say that? Why would I EVER say that? It's Cas. I would never say that."
Dean watched. He put a hand to touch the delicate feathers and then paused. Cas said it was okay, so he continued. Castiel's wings felt like holding a velvet blanket. The feathers were crazy soft and Cas responded to Dean's touch by making a hmph noise. Dean entangled his fingers into the wings
"Oh, come
Dean nodded looking extremely guilty as he left.
"Well?" He asked.
Before he could even blink, he saw the woman only a few steps away from him, pull the trigger. He saw the bullet racing towards his head. He closed his eyes ready to accept his fate. And then he felt a strong hand pull him back. He saw darkness engulf him and heard a man's voice scream ,"NO!" He closed his eyes not knowing what the fuck was happening, but he felt his back press against another body. He heard his brother scream alongside the sound of gunfire. Still eyes closed, Dean felt a pair of hands around him, protecting him.
Dean began pacing back and forth, "Oh, and what? You're willing to put
Dean stepped back, destroyed with the way Cas's rage was pouring out of him. He had never seen Cas talk back to him like this, and it was overwhelming.
Cas turned off the heat and faced Dean. Dean placed his cup of coffee down and walked towards the angel, a bit nervous and unsure.
of hell but not all of it. I erased any recollection he had of meeting me and put his soul and his body back together. Now since I went and tried to mess with his soul, it broke down the walls I built in his mind. He's remembering everything, all the suffering I tried to hide him from," Cas muttered. Sam stared at Cas speechless.
Sam and Dean returned to the bunker, Sam helping Dean down the stairs. Cas had healed almost all of Dean's major injuries but his ribs still hurt like a major bitch. Dean had texted Cas to say thank you but Cas hadn't replied. After making sure Dean was in one piece, Sam went to check on Cas. But again, Cas didn't answer. Cas avoided all contact with the Winchesters unless it was really necessary. Dean missed his lengthy conversations with Cas more than anything. But when he remembered the mortified look on Castiel's face when the saline tubes started to fill with blood in the hospital due to the magic, everything started to hurt again.
Jack, meanwhile, also rolled down and landed beside Cas. The rift sealed behind them almost immediately, and Jack groaned with his face covered in the tawny, auburn coloured leaves of Autumn.
"I hate these bitches so much," Dean said, scowling.
"How is he back here with us, Dean?" Cas asked, finally getting to the important golden question.
"We're actually looking for a man."
Cas smiled softly, "well, that's nice of you. Is everything okay?"
"Thank you. For every fucking thing you do and have ever done for me," Dean said clutching Cas's coat in his hands.
"Don't you dare die on me now, ya hear me?" Sam grumbled as he pulled away from the hug.
"Don’t move or we'll kill you!" Sam said quickly, pushing the sword forward. The witch laughed, waving her hands and the bodyguards dropped to the floor unconscious. Dean and Sam turned their heads in time to see the strong bodyguards collapse but when they turned back, the witch had disappeared.
"Cas, remember what I told you when I had the Mark of Cain? If I go fucking nuts, you have to take me out- smite me, put a fucking bullet in my head, I don’t care, " Dean said, keeping his eye contact steady and sure.
Last chapter! No pain I swear, it's just cute fluff, domestic deancas and cute brotherly moments.
"Alright, but if you push me off the bed, we're DONE," Dean said smirking.
Cas muttered a small, "thank you" before pushing Dean away from him. Dean looked up, listening to the rain that was much calmer, lightly drizzled over them. The thunder and lightning had completely dissipated.
"It's okay, it's just your body reacting to stress. You've been through a lot; it's perfectly understandable," Cas responded.
"Stop that!" The woman yelled which startled the hunter, "there's no way out!" Now Dean saw her for who she really was- a madman, or in this case, a madwoman. Her hair was tangled into a mess, hands shaking, clothes ragged. He looked at Sam who was now across the room who looked as worried as Dean felt.
Dean gave Cas a questioning look, "I didn't know you two were close?"
Dean couldn’t help but grin, “So, what did you do with the flowers?”
"You've got a good kid over there," Lucifer said eyes trailing Jack, "I would have thought he would be more menacing and well, devilish."
"Come on, coats and shirts off, I need to look at that wound," Dean said pointing to Cas's stomach. Cas winced as he took his layers off slowly. Dean prepared two clean towels, a few bandages, betadine, and some gauze pads. Cas grunted as he sat on the edge of the chair. Dean checked out Cas's stomach wound first, but to his relief, Cas's grace had already kicked in and he was healed nice and slow. He wiped the blood off and did the same to the maroon liquid drying on Castiel's face. Cas waited patiently, watching as Dean got to work.
"Your room sounds like a great idea," Cas said, his voice becoming deeper. Dean chuckled a little as he grabbed the remote turning off the TV and pulled Castiel into his room, quickly closing the doors behind them. He returned to Cas's arms as if he had finally come home.
"This is it," Sam said sure.
Inias stepped forward, observing Castiel, "why don't you just admit what this is really about. You're in love with him. He makes you weak, Castiel."
"Are you shitting me?" Dean hissed at him.
"Where's Lucifer?" Castiel asked, curiously.
The man stopped, "What?" His voice was cold and stern.
Cas laughed, shaking his head, "They're just not used to it. I never get close to anyone, and they know that. So when you came along, it's thrown everyone off. They'll get used to you, don't worry. And I don't care about what they think. I only care that you're well and happy."
Cas nodded.
“I put them in a vase, but I want to grow them properly. Especially those tulips, they would look pretty,” Cas said thinking. Tulips.
They came to a clearing, where no massive oak trees were hovering over them, or small scrubs of bushes swaying near their feet.
"Dean," Cas gulped, "We can’t do this. You know we can't."
"Cas, I'm doing this. I'm sure as hell not letting Sammy go through with it if it means putting his life at risk," Dean said quietly.
Dean looked down at the way he had just fallen asleep on Cas, "Sorry about- uh- all this."
Cas frowned as Dean winced at the pain, clutching the side of his ribcage where Cas knew Dean had a few broken ribs. Dean left to shower, clean up the blood from their incredibly intense hunt. It was meant to be one vampire but they had accidentally run into an entire nest. With Sam still in California with Rowena, Dean and Cas had taken care of the nest but with great difficulty. Dean let the blood trickle down the drain as he showered, the water turning a light shade of red. He struggled to stand upright properly due to his ribs so he tried to shower as quickly as possible. The soap caused his cuts to sting like salt on a wound, and even though by now Dean should be used to the searing pain, that didn't mean it hurt any less. He scrubbed himself clean, and then when he returned to his room, Cas was already comfortable and feet up on the bed. He was scrolling through his phone, mildly occupied.
" Donna asked gently, watching the way Castiel's breathing hitched.
"Sammy, let me do this," Dean said sternly but his eyes were pleading.
"What?" Dean asked surprised.
"Dean, when Cas is hell-bent on saving your ass, you can't stop him," Sam said with a small laugh.
Dean furrowed his eyebrows, fiddling with his thumbs "I thought that was fairly obvious…"
"Hey, Cas."
"This is different. I know it's been around 10 years now, but the human soul is fragile and takes a long time to repair, especially after the suffering you went through in hell. I put your soul together using my grace but if I try to meddle with it again, I'm afraid it'll all collapse."
, Sam," was all Dean could reply with.
"You guys can go ahead on your little adventure but I'm going to do more research," Cas said and Sam agreed out of nowhere. Jack asked if he could join Lucifer and Dean, much to Castiel's annoyance. Lucifer quickly and hurriedly got ready and they were ready to go, "come on chaps."
Dean sat down on the edge of his bed, and clasped his hands together, closing his eyes.
Cas looked at Dean, "I'm not going back. You should go and take the flowers back to Michael. I don't belong there, and anyways, you don't want me around. I have no purpose back there, I'm weaker. I'm not the all-powerful angel I was back then. You should carry on without me."
Dean huffed, "he's a pain in the ass sometimes but he's my brother and I would take a fucking bullet for him."
"Let me heal you," Cas said. Dean saw the angel's eyes glow blue for a split second before he felt a cool soothing chill, travel from his fingertips, up to his arm. He recognised it as Castiel's grace. Dean was always amazed and impressed with Cas's abilities because he would always forget Cas was an actual
Dean couldn't help but laugh, "you've seen headless people, monsters and the devil
"Yes, it is." Cas fiddled with his fingers.
"Can I kiss you?" Cas asked very slowly and carefully.
"Cas, it looks like a forest. I don't think this is the way."
"No, I'm fine."
This chapter song recommendation, because this song is fun and weird as is this chapter:
"Me too, Cas. Look, just, keep fighting, okay? We'll find a solution, I promise."
Dean froze.
To his amusement and relief, Jack was in a deep conversation with the police department's forensic scientist. Lucifer and Dean popped their heads into the room to find a girl with flowy black hair eagerly chattering.
Cas blushed, smirking, "I just wanted to piss him off. He doesn't seem to be fond of our
Cas turned around without waiting for Dean's reply and left. He kept walking and didn't look back. Dean watched Cas leave, for the 100th time now. He wasn't aware of how much Cas was hurting, and deep down he knew what Cas said was right. He followed the angel, through the bushes, and the leaves crunching beneath their feet. Dean wanted to talk to Cas, but he was afraid he would just make things worse. Because apparently, that what he does. Make things worse.
Cas remained quiet until he went, "You should go back to sleep."
"Anyway, what are you doing here Maze?" Lucifer asked watching her still seeking the room.
protective over you." Dean felt a massive knot tie in his throat and stomach and suddenly swallowing down his saliva became a challenge in itself.
Cas has said this before YEARS ago.
"So, we're back?" Jack asked with uncertainty in his voice. Sam looked around not knowing exactly what he was looking for until he found it. He spotted an impala on the driveway ahead of them and smiled knowingly, "yes, we are."
"Son of a bitch!" the man yelled and Dean instantly recognized the voice as his own feathered friend.
Dean sighed. After years of battling his emotions and feelings for Cas, he finally felt like he could breathe.
Cas smiled, "I've always liked them. They don't complicate and overthink everything as adults do. They love whole-heartedly and they fight for what they want."
"I- uh- just wanted to see you," Dean said nervously.
Dean grabbed his hand, "if you're going, I'm going."
Another burst of lightning and it struck the ground, fire erupting out of the Earth and spreading so that it was encircling Dean and Cas only. Dean felt it too this time. It was a sudden heat that coursed through his body, stinging his muscles, bones and tissues of his organs. But this was nothing compared to the agony Cas was enduring. The pain Cas was experiencing was tenfold what Dean was encountering. Cas screamed and blood exploded from the ground like lava erupting from the core of the Earth. Pools and pools of blood surrounded them as if the Earth itself was in pain.
"So, this is just another day, huh?" Cas sighed. The Shadowhunters introduced themselves to Castiel, who politely shook hands with everyone. He came to Magnus, who had a huge stupid grin plastered on his face.
"Bud, I didn't bring a change of clothes," Dean said laughing.
"What's wrong?" Cas asked, sensing Dean's agitation.
Dean's eyes met Cas's and Cas smiled, "My wings. They'll help keep us both warm for the night."
They had the funeral later on, which was as sombre and haunting as one could imagine. Sam gathered Dean, Cas, Jody and Donna to talk about the plan. The plan was much easier said than done. After a whole argument with Dean against literally everyone else, it was decided that now that they knew where Michael was hiding, they would attack in the coming week. They split up into six teams of six people. Each team would have one of either Sam, Dean, Cas, Jody, Donna or Claire because they were the hunters with the most experience on their hands. Each team would attack from different sides, leaving Dean's team to enter from the front to end Michael. Sam had brought the archangel blade with him, and it was safely tucked away. Dean tried to persuade them to use him as bait but none of them agreed that was a good idea, Castiel, especially. Dean begged Sam to reconsider and change their plans but Sam was as tenacious as Cas or possibly even more so. After their meeting had ended, it was late evening and everyone had gone back to sleep. Cas found Sam in the dining hall staring at his phone.
Dean gulped, "he wouldn't listen. I couldn't change his mind. I left him… again. Fuck."
"You should probably get some rest."
"Hell, if I can sleep when we have monsters on our ass," Dean said.
"This is your fault! She's dead because of you! Because you wanted to find him! You did this!" She yelled at Cas accusingly.
"And I'm so proud of you, and Sam too. You built an army together. And you're the commander, eh?" Dean asked pulling back with a grin.
"Alright, that's enough from you," Cas smiled, breaking away from Dean, and leaving his tent to go find Sam.
Dean just nodded, bouncing his leg up and down restlessly as they waited for more news in the dining room.
"I will overcome
"You're so sappy sometimes, you know that?" Dean said.
"Oh, Samuel. How about you make it up to me?" Rowena asked, her eyes glistening with mischief.
"Sam just told me what happened when I was under the spell. Cas, what did I say to you?" Dean asked. He needed to know. He HAD to know. He had to know how bad it was so that he could punish himself accordingly for hurting his angel, his best friend.
"Y'all had sex yet?" Sam asked, grinning. Dean sent silent daggers at his brother that said:
Dean wandered to the motel front desk, pulling out his wallet. There was a man, messy black hair and a beige trenchcoat, standing beside him. Dean looked across, frowning his head.
"No. You're going back with Sam. This won't take long. If Rosaline is dead, we just need to find her body and return it to her girlfriend, it's the least we could do," Cas said, packing the maps into a small bag.
"This is his," Cas said. Alec took it from Cas and called Jace over. Everyone watched as Alec and Jace parabatai tracked using Dean's jacket. The golden shimmering light encircling their hands as Jace and Alec stared at each other, trying to pinpoint Dean's location. After a few seconds, Alec pulled away.
Despite Castiels heeded warnings, the Winchester brothers run into danger but this time, it doesn't end well for them. Something's not quite right with Dean...
Claire Novak stepped out of the shadows, wearing a dirty green jacket, boots and a shotgun posed in her arms. She lowered her shotgun as her eyes settled on Dean and Castiel staring at her in absolute shock.
Dean had to hold the door frame for support because his legs were about to give in. He refused to believe that those words came out of his mouth at all.
"God, my head is about to fucking explode. I'm gonna need 10 bottles of beer after this," He said, slowly regaining his strength.
"I'm proud of you," Dean said abruptly.
Song for the chapter:
"Quiet! Castiel, what is the meaning of this?" David asked, confused.
Dean shrugged and nodded, "Well, anyway, I'm Dean." He flashed a charming smile.
to see you, Dean," Cas mumbled into Dean's neck. Dean didn't let go. He didn't
John was testing Cas, but Cas just wasn't playing his game- not anymore.
Dean relaxed back into Cas. He kissed Cas's feathers some more and Cas felt like he was in Heaven all over again. Better than Heaven almost. Cas loved the feeling of Dean's lips on his feathers, and it was something he never thought would come to pass.
"It's very evident he cares deeply about you but you're too oblivious to realize it. You have a lovely angel perching over your shoulder. Tell him how you feel before it's too late." Lucifer said stumping Dean.
Cas bit his lips, "I'm afraid you'll
"When in doubt, cut 'em heads off," Donna replied. Claire was silent on the table, and Dean who was sitting across from her noticed.
"Of course, your majesty," Cas said politely. Dean offered his hand again as he did at the ball, and Cas took it.
He was almost inaudible when he replied, "You matter to me."
"You don't have anything to prove, not to me or anyone. You know you can see me and talk to me whenever you want. Yeah, I'm fighting a war, but people like you remind me what I'm fighting for," Cas said calmly.
Cas hesitated before looking at Lucifer, "I met Dean when I rescued him from hell." He said it with the most deadpan expression, which threw Lucifer off completely.
-nethmi
"Hello?" Castiel spoke into the silent void ahead.
"You admire him." It wasn't a question, it was an observation.
Nethmi, ourvelvetscars
"Was he worth it? Was he worth all the soldiers we've lost in this past year?" the man, Inias, asked.
Magnus hurriedly stumbled over to Alec, who was weary but sitting upright.
. But he was extensively trying to find a solution to something damn near impossible and his frustration only continued to build inside.
This caused Dean to spin around with his coffee in his hands, "Leave me alone, man."
You think I don't know about all your bullshit, John?" Cas raised his voice, and it sent Dean into a frantic wave of panic, "you hurt Dean. You mistreated and abused him. You drilled him into becoming your perfect little soldier. You used fear against him and traumatized him from a young age. I couldn't be there to keep him safe back then, but I'm here now. You
"And what about you, sweetheart?" she asked, clearly not noticing how close Dean and Cas were sitting together.
Song for the chapter:
Dean walked over to Cas, "I don't think so. Castiel, care to come with us to the castle?"
"I feel extremely under-dressed," Dean said looking at the fancy restaurant they were about to dine in and then looking down as his worn-out boots, his old jacket and stained jeans. Lucifer held opened the door for him.
"Of course, I was. Shit, Cas, I thought- I thought something happened to you," Dean said frantically.
"I don't mind it as long as you're safe. I
Jack asked them to order a kid's meal for him and hurried off to the restroom nearly tripping over his own feet.
Dean took a sharp breath in, "When did you know?"
"You already did, dumbass," Sam mumbled.
Cas placed Dean in the backseat of the impala, with Sam trying to wake his brother up. Cas closed his eyes trying to heal Dean but something was wrong.
Sam smiled weakly, "You know you can't stop Cas. No one can."
"Calm your horses, we're here to help," the man with the spiky red streaks in his hair spoke. Dean noticed the rings on his fingers.
"And you trust this angel enough to put your life at risk?" Lucifer asked.
"Damn straight, I am. We figured out how to get back, well, kind of.." He trailed off.
Dean clenched and unclenched his fists, knowing full well he couldn't hide anything from Cas, even if he tried.
. You're gonna be just fine. You need to breathe, Dean." The hunter nodded, trying to be strong. He gripped Castiel's arm, trying to inhale and exhale. Breathing got easier by the second, but it still felt like there was a bag of bricks crushing his chest. Cas held Dean's shoulder tightly, never daring to take his eyes off the hunter.
Dean could see and feel the anger rising inside Sam, "you talked about this without me?" Sam looked at Cas and then back at Dean, feeling betrayed by them both.
Dean laughed, placing his clothes on the rack, "move over, feathers." Cas shifted to make room for Dean on his right side.
Cas hesitated because he knew this would break Dean as much as it had broken him, "You said you could never love me. You said you wished we had never met in that barn. You said you didn't WANT to love me."
"I'm not good at…
"Dean, what's going on with you?" Sam asked.
Dean laughed, "yeah, I'm not going insane, I swear."
Sam laughed, "exactly."
Dean and Cas talked about everything else EXCEPT their relationship status. Dean never brought up the flowers, or what they meant. Cas never asked Dean about it either. They worked together but Dean always felt there was an underlying tension between them. Heck, even Sam could tell something was up. One night, Dean was silently placing new red roses on Cas's bed-side table, when Cas stirred awake.
When Dean returned, he found Cas laid out on the bed and his eyes peeled to the small TV screen. They were playing season seven of Game of Thrones (aka one of the best seasons in Dean's opinion).
"Freaking
"Cas, how long?"
Sam and Dean approached the area where they heard the voice. The forest swayed with the wind as they moved against it
The unexpected knock on the door sent Dean flying into the air. After his heart had reposed, he opened the door to find Cas outside.
"Hmm… maybe we just have to play it out? Remember when Gabriel stuck us in that game show and Dr Sexy? Like that. We stay and act our parts until the end of the Cinderella story," Sam said.
"I probably could," Dean sank back into his seat, "I probably could have gotten through to him."
, the next person who asks me that won't be leaving without a bloody nose and I ain't even kidding. Nothing is going on, Sam."
"There's nothing to talk about really," Dean's tone immediately darkened as he turned away.
"But I felt something when he walked by me- like power was radiating off him and wait- you think he's
"Cas? Dean?" A very familiar voice called out to them.
to let go. Dean felt a cool rush course through his body and he knew it was Castiel's grace saying hello. It felt familiar, and for the first time in months, Dean finally felt
"I like it. Commander. It makes you sound so… authoritative," Dean smirked.
There was a long pause before Sam broke the silence, "That's for you to find out, Dean."
"Cas, what did I say?" Dean asked again.
"This ain't your fault, Cas. This is beyond our control. But we'll do what we can," Dean rustled into Cas's ear as he lightly nibbled on it, "and you know damn well there's no such thing as 'being safe' when it comes to our jobs."

"Great, that's hopeful," Dean replied, sarcastically.
"Hey, feathers. You busy?" Dean asked, poking his head out.
Incredible- Oh The Larceny
"Cas, do what you can to heal him. I hope Magnus can kill Hecate to save Dean in time," Clary said. Cas didn't say anything, his full attention was on Dean. Dean started to wake up, muttering inaudibly. He kept trying to clasp Cas or Sam's hand. Cas kneeled on the ground, trying to redirect all his grace to help Dean heal. Dean's wound began to heal but extremely slowly. It was almost useless. Castiel felt useless.
"Hey sweetheart let's just talk this through alright?" Dean smiled his award-winning charming smile as he walked away from Sam. He knew he was in deep shit but least he could do was keep his brother safe.
Dean paused, "I- uh- it's hard not having you around. I thought I lost you. I thought that was it. And now I got you back and..."
"Yes I mean I have never been in this situation before so I don't really know. And Dean can you please refrain from touching my back, my body is still healing," Castiel glared at him sharply causing Dean to step away and apologize.
"We're not taking this risk," Sam said his voice shaking, only slightly but it was still enough for Dean to pick up on.
"Feels good to be king," Dean grinned, fixing his suit. Dean wore a black suit with silver threads. The brothers, of course, had their crowns on and Dean never felt more powerful.
When they arrived at the camp, Castiel was immediately called for. Cas didn't want to leave Dean, but Dean just went, "It's okay. Go. I'm not leaving, I promise."
The seventh night, Cas woke up to red tulips. And Cas couldn't stop staring at the beautiful red flowers, tracing the vibrant petals between his fingers. Tulips. Love. A declaration of love.
Dean sighed silently.
Cas turned around to leave but Dean caught him by his shoulders, "Cas, I am begging you. Don't do this."
Dean eyed Alec and Magnus and raised his eyebrows. Magnus interlocked his fingers into Alec's before going, "I know, I got super lucky. Anyone in your life, Dean?" Alec smiled gently to himself.
This caused Cas's smile to widen, "yeah, he was a little shit. He still is."
"So, we're good?" Dean asked, his voice still a bit shaky and unsure.
The words carved into Cas like knives digging into his chest.
"I think the lore is a bit different in your world. You're Sam and Dean Winchester, right? You're hunters? You do what we do, except without the powers."
"Dean, I don't understand what's happening," Cas said as he intertwined his fingers into Dean's hand. Dean placed a gentle hand on Cas's waist, a little cautiously.
Dean chuckled, "Really? How come?"
Dust & Gold by Arrows to Athens
statement echoing in his head, but he quickly snapped out of his trance. Cas stepped forward, grabbing Dean's elbow gently, "Dean, I admire your loyalty and courage, but please, stop. You're making this worse."
Dean wanted to speak to Cas, to just talk and lay things out in the open, before he started to lose his frigging mind. He wanted to make it up to Cas, somehow, to show him that everything he said that horrible day was wrong, and that he was sorry, but he didn’t know where to start. Dean could never work up the nerve to talk to Cas, so he found other ways to communicate instead. The first night Cas fell asleep, Dean left a handwritten note that read:
"Wait, you
to sleep. Dean guided Cas to his bed, making sure he was comfortable and Cas fully passed out within seconds of hitting the pillow, shirtless and his hand resting on his bandaged wound.
"Yeah, I just got a text from Dan saying he's going after this serial killer. I gotta go Sam, but good luck!" She said.
After they sent away Maggie and covered up Rosaline's body, Dean stayed out of Cas's hair. Sam checked up on Dean, but Dean was silent. He was thinking. Dean had been terrified that they would bring back Castiel's body, but instead, it was someone else. He was spared this time. But now someone else was paying the price. How many lives did Cas have to risk to save Dean? Was he even worth all that? Dean sat at the dinner table mulling things over in his head.
Cas shook his head, "How about you keep it for me? My feather contains power, if you ever feel sad, or angry, or feel like giving up, hold my feather and remember I'm right here with you. Every step of the way."
can't do this to you."
"How long are you planning on staying like this?" Cas asked curiously.
" Castiel broke off looking up and narrowing his eyes at Dean.
"Hey, sweetheart," Magnus said, purple sparks of magic firing from his hands.
too young to be his dad, to be honest- but like- no disrespect or whatever- you know- what I mean is that you look great! Annndddd I'm going to shut up now," Ella stammered, going fully red in the face.
Maggie pursed her lips, still overcome with anger and pain, but she didn't raise her voice. She cried and cried, her body falling into Dean. Dean held her tightly, doing his best to comfort her. His eyes met Cas's and neither of them dared look away.
And I refuse to run
"Cas isn't my mother."
"Dean, just stop. I made it clear before. I'm not leaving you," Cas said. Dean was speechless, opening and closing his mouth dumbstruck.
"The funeral-" Cas said, suddenly remembering last night's events.
," the other boy, Jace, muttered.
Cas saw Dean inhale and their eyes met for a split second.
"As long as you'll have me," Dean said without really thinking.
He saw an opening to the door of the basement and ushered them all out. Just as the hostages rushed out, Sam entered.
"Oh, well let's hear it then!" Lucifer said and Dean explained the spell in the simplest way he could. Lucifer looked bewildered," the human soul? There's no way…"
"It's been quiet, we've been trying to scope out where Michael is hiding before your brother found us. Lost a few good men in some hunts. You know, there are these weird hybrid things, and it's made everyone restless," Donna said in a hushed voice.
"I know. But you'll have to. Unless I die before that," Dean said. Cas didn't reply, his voice was stuck in his throat.
"They're still there, you just can't see them," Castiel answered one of Dean's burning questions and finally found the strength to stand up, "you're an idiot you know that?"
"I think you forget, I know your entire life story, Dean," Cas smiled. It wasn't malicious or evil, it was kind and genuine.
"Cas, hey," Dean said, right before Castiel collapsed and his knees buckled under him. The pain and trauma that Cas shifted onto him were taking a toll. Dean held Cas, muttering a small "you're okay," and carefully placed the angel down on the edge of his bed. Cas didn't say anything; he was too busy trying to keep his breathing at a normal rate.
"No, it's okay Sam is going out to get some food now, he needs the break... No Dean… Yes, just get something small for me… Okay, I'll see you soon," and he hung up.
Dean smiled softly, "sure."
"Rowena said she found the book, the original spellbook that the witch back in the days had used. She's trying to reverse the spell so it'll take her a few days at most. We're one step closer," Sam chirped in excitement.
Dean felt a weird feeling of warmth and comfort, "I know."
"He'll be okay, Dean. It's
"So, are we gonna talk about this?" Sam asked crossing his arms across his chest.
Dean cursed.
A meeting was called for, soon after Dean woke up. Cas helped Dean, making sure he wasn't about to go crazy or lose it completely. Dean was fine, just extremely drained. The meeting dawned upon them and Cas became jittery and nervous. He knew Dean would never go down without a fight.
Cas didn't reply after that. So Dean didn’t say anything either.
Dean pursed his lips nodding, "I- uh- yeah, of course. If it weren't for the kids and everyone else in this place, David would have a god damn axe to his head."
"Oh, I'm dead serious," He said and turned to Cas, "Cas, is it possible to... maybe, extract the human soul? It sounds insane but I mean after everything we've been through lately, I wouldn't be surprised if we manage to pull this off."
Dean quickly changed the subject, "So, uh you're better now though, right?"
When they arrived in Dean's room, Cas gently closed the door behind him because he was pretty sure this conversation would end in raised voices.
"Cas, what's the plan? Where are we even going?" Dean asked, putting his back to the wall. It was a chilly night, and he was starting to shiver, and regret not bringing more jackets (he was already wearing two).
“Better?” Cas said watching him.
"These nightmares aren't just going to disappear. There's nothing anyone can do to fix this because I'm so fucking broken beyond repair. There's no point talking about this," Dean said, suddenly tired and exhausted.
The warehouse stood just outside of town, looking deserted and a little haunted too. It was pitch black outside, the moon was covered by the thick clouds so any hope of using moonlight as a guide was forgotten. The warehouse was massive, and when Sam Winchester first saw it, it sent shivers all around his body. Sam parked the Impala across the road on the opposite side and waited for Castiel to follow suit. Everyone stepped out.
Cas could hear Dean's
"I can't heal him. His body is refusing my grace. I don't understand..." Cas trailed off.
Magnus groaned, "Oh, this is bad. When I tracked the demon, she was in an abandoned warehouse just outside of town."
responsibility. So, please, do us both a favour, and don't provoke him anymore, okay?" Dean pleaded.
Dean wondered whether Cas would join him today, even though he had no reason to. He waited, texting Sam back and forth before he heard a knock on the door and Cas appeared.
Dean grabbed the gun from the bedside table of the motel and packed it up along with the rest of his weapons stuffing them into his duffle bag. Castiel stood in the back of the room hidden in the shadows, "Dean it's not wise to enter that house alone." Dean, thinking he was completely alone, jumped at the sound of Castiel's voice.
"Let's dance."
Cas stood outside the door, afraid to open it and find it empty. But he held the door handle and pushed it. The door opened and there was a flash of light as an angel was killed.
"No, really I don't. Tell me," Dean pushed but his voice was gentle. His eyes tried to meet Cas's but the angel just avoided his gaze altogether.
Dean had a marvellous shower, the best he's had in ages. He stayed in there for around twenty minutes just rinsing away the blood, sweat, tears, pain and death burned onto his skin. He dried himself up, changed into some new clothes and slowly walked into the main dining room. Jody and Donna were sitting with Claire and Cas in their table. A few heads turned as Dean entered, whispers spreading throughout the room. Dean heard a few of them as he went to grab all the food he possibly could, bacon, fruits, vegetables, bread and eggs. Most of the whispers were on the similar lines of
"Let's go home, Cas," Dean said softly.
Dean sighed, trying to meet the angel's eyes, "Cas, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. But you kept fighting, and you beat her."
"This is the one thing Chuck can never take away from us," Cas muttered, feeling Dean hug him tighter, "do you remember what I said before? About how in this massive mess, we're real. We've always been real. Your feelings, my feelings- that's real. We always fight for each other, no matter what kind of shit Chuck puts us through." Dean nodded, burying his head deeper into Castiel's shoulder. Sometimes they didn't need to speak words to understand what the other was feeling.
Dean clenched his fists together, "You don't know what he's capable of, Cas. My dad can be a prick, I know, but he did his best when he raised me and Sam. And I know you disagree. And trust me, I'm touched that you even care, but please, stay out of it. If my dad figures out how to kill angels, you're going to be number 1 on his hit list, alright?" Dean saw uncertainty in Cas's eyes for the first time.
"Oh yeah? What am I trying to tell you?" Dean asked, hoping Cas would say it so he doesn't have to.
"Can't promise anything, love," Dean joked. He waited until Cas quietly slipped out and shuffled towards Jack, before shouting, "over here asshat! You want this sweet piece of ass? Well, come and get it!" The wendigo shrieked before it lunged into Dean. Dean ducked and whirled around expertly, grabbing the lighter out of his pocket.
Dean grumbled with a small sigh.
"Sam is in danger; this is more important. Dean please let me come with you," Cas begged following Dean out the door. The moonlight was enough to illuminate the entire parking space ahead of them.
"I'm so sorry. For all the pain you've endured and the loss. You can't keep bottling things up, Dean. It'll destroy you from the inside out," Cas said, his voice velvet soft. The angel drew small circles on the back of Dean's hand. He read online that this movement is supposed to calm a person down, it's a sign of reassuring them.
"Please do come in, your majesties!" She said beckoning them in, bowing.
Cas nodded, "If I get kicked out with Dean, then okay. But I need someone I trust to run this place and carry forward my plans. And I trust Sam."
"You kept me within your arm's reach back at your camp, made sure I was well fed and looked after, like a pig going into slaughter, and then the moment I'm willing to give myself up for this fight, you refuse to let me fight. You pushed me away, but you still refuse to let me go. You're a selfish bastard is what you are," Dean fired back.
"It's not that easy, Sam. I fucked up hard. Cas isn't just gonna let it go this time. You didn't see his face when he left. I pushed him away so much so that I broke him," Dean said quietly.
"Sure."
-------------------
"He hates me," Dean said, his voice breaking mid-sentence.
Sam shook his head furiously, "No, no. We need to play this out. We need to get everyone's handwriting and then find Cas last. We need to stick to the rules, Dean."
Dean smirked as he saw Castiel's black socks with rainbow patterns. Dean had seen those socks at a gift shop once and gotten them as a gift for Cas who seemed to really love it. Cas, in return, had bought Dean some "send noods" socks with pictures of noodles that Dean adored. Dean smiled to himself softly as he thought about those simpler days.
Nevertheless, Dean didn't have the strength to keep going back and forth with Cas like this. Every time he thought they were going somewhere, Cas would take a completely different turn in the opposite direction, and it was exhausting. He was about to stand up when he felt Cas's soft but worn out hands grab him, and he looked down at them.
"Cas?" Jack asked, going over to his father. Cas proceeded to stare at Dean, shell shocked. The walls Cas had built, in Dean's mind were breaking down.
"Will you be okay?" Sam asked concerned. Cas nodded, trying to compose himself.
"Okay, go ahead," Dean rephrased, looking up again, staring at Cas's ocean blue eyes.
Also fyi, if it isn't obvious yet, the story is told mainly from Dean's POV.
"Do we even know what this flower looks like?" Dean asked.
And just like that, it was settled. Dean felt his heart weigh another thousand pounds. There were still words unsaid, feelings buried deep down and thoughts never ushered aloud.
"You sleep too, feathers. Recharge," Dean muttered, swinging his left arm across Cas's body lazily. Cas was used to this. When Dean was extremely exhausted, his walls came down.
"Sammy, I swear to god, I will light
"Yeah? You shouldn't be standing up..." Dean went over to Cas, and the moment he was close enough, Cas pulled Dean into him, putting his entire weight into Dean, and into the hug. Dean didn't say anything but again, like before, he could feel the exhaustion and suffering putting a toll on Castiel.

"Yes, Sam is leading us well. We know exactly where Michael is located at. It's only a matter of time before we attack. How are you and Dean?" Inias asked. Cas shifted his weight around, biting his lower lip.
"So, what am I supposed to do about it?" Dean asked, more gentle this time.
"No, it's okay. You just... surprised me."
place to make new friends, huh?" His sarcasm earned him a grin from Lucifer.
"You let my mother die! Rowena wouldn't have had to die if you just stuck to the fucking plan! And then you leave for god knows how long and you don’t even text Sam back, who was worrying about you for days! You just pop in and out whenever the fuck you want?" Dean yelled back, raising his voice.
"I just told you, I can't sleep, dude," Dean complained.
Cas nodded, smiling a little, "Dean is family, but so are you. I trust you, Sam. With everything I have."
Dean woke up feeling like absolute shit. It was 5 am; you could hear a pin drop. Dean got dressed and went to the main living area, where he would usually find Cas with his head buried in a book. They would usually exchange smiles, good mornings, Cas would make him coffee, and if he was lucky, sometimes he made him breakfast too. But today was different. Cas wasn't there anymore. Dean glanced around, the silence and gloom overcoming him. He missed Cas more than anything. Dean opened his phone and flicked through his contact list, his fingers landed on Castiel's number. But he didn't dare call.
The second night, Dean left Cas a small gift and a note. It was a small statue of a bee.
"I don't hate you," Was the first thing Dean said.
All the while Dean saw another man racing towards him on his side of the sidewalk and his instincts instantly kicked in. Dean swung the knife expertly, leaving a small scar on the stranger's arm. He kicked the man in the groin, grabbed his arm, twisted it back and pinned him to the ground. A few people around them cried and gasped in shock.
"I think we should send out a second-team, only a few people, just to check," Jody said unsure still.
"You're my
"Fucking hell, what took you so long?" Dean asked, burying his face into Cas's neck. Cas placed a hand on Dean's waist but pulled away when he saw the other men giving him a weird side glance.
The woman who was clasping Sam's hand looked a little aghast that Castiel had spoken to the princes like that.
Song for the chapter:
"Do you remember when Zachariah sent you 5 years into the future once? And when you returned, I pulled you away from him. You told me to never change. And I think at that moment, I knew," Cas said, stroking Dean's hair slowly.
