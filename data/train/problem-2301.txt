They smiled at each other, an easy smile that was somehow also loaded with promise. They’d be fine. John took a deep breath and decided that one of them had to be the first to move. He took the initiative, grabbing the leash hanging from Sherlock’s collar and leading him out to get a cab.
From the cradle bars
“Upsy-daisy, loves,” Spike cackled, herding them over and up the ladder after Drusilla.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I figured something out about you.”
Sherlock let go of John’s head and reached under the pillow behind him, pulling out a bottle with a somewhat smug expression on his face. John said a silent prayer of thanks to the gods of sex for the detective’s foresight. Sherlock flipped the cap open with his thumb and John cried out at the loss of contact when Sherlock reached up to coat his fingers. John spread his legs a bit wider, rutting unabashedly against Sherlock’s hip in the process. Sherlock clicked the bottle closed, tossed it down next to them, and then resumed his earlier ministrations on John’s arsehole, now with more viscosity. Instead of resuming his hold on John’s head, which was now free to have latched firmly on one of the detective’s apparently very sensitive nipples, Sherlock began working him open with fingers from both hands. He was trapped by Sherlock’s arms, held solidly in place while long fingers delicately pressed in and pulled out, curled and crooked, teasing him mercilessly and playing him like a violin. It didn’t take very long at all before John was arching his back and moaning wantonly.
John closed his eyes and took a deep breath, the reality of the situation finally hitting him. He was at a goth club, where everyone is supposed to believe them to be a couple. They were about to dance. He was about to dance with a very, very sexily dressed Sherlock Holmes, the man who had been front and center of all of his fantasies for the last two years. And they were here hunting serial killers, which to Sherlock was probably the closest thing to foreplay that he could imagine. And Sherlock was flirting with him. [Well, fuck it. It might all be a ruse for the case, but I may as well enjoy it while I can.] John stood up a bit straighter and looked Sherlock in the eye. He finally snaked his arm around Sherlock’s corseted waist, returning Sherlock's embrace. He shivered a little as he brushed the corset laces, thrilled that he had permission to touch Sherlock this way.
Drusilla and Spike wasted no time tonight, ignoring the longing stares and groping hands of the other dancers as they stalked directly over to John and Sherlock. John wondered how he could have, even briefly, considered Spike attractive as he watched him slink and slither with the most self-assured, smarmy expression on his face. In contrast with Sherlock’s natural grace and commanding presence, this guy was bootleg. Maybe his overconfidence was largely derived from his association with Drusilla.
“John. I’ve figured something out.”
“What aren’t you telling me, Sherlock? Trust has to go both ways, you know.”
“Who said romance is dead?” John replied as he tugged at the ankles of Sherlock’s trousers.
“We’ll find you again. You know he deserves eternity, John. Let him go.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows at John’s use of Polari. “You have been keeping secrets.”
“Well, then show me how good you can be. Count.” Before he even finished the last word, he brought the riding crop sharply down across John’s entire arse, just over the crease where his glutes met his thighs.
Like the sun through the blinds
What are our boys getting themselves into? Obligatory backstory chapter!
“Nah, seems like that’s your skeleton in the closet.”
stay tuned for one more chapter, the exciting conclusion to 'this cold heart never bleeds'. thanks for sticking with it, despite my rather haphazard uploading schedule. xo
Anyway, a couple of random things…
Not breaking his intense eye contact, Sherlock went on. “This club is a venue that entertains two types of clientele. The back room is the goth club, where our killers will be hunting their next victims, if I am correct. Which of course, I am. However, we will have to enter through the front room, which is a performance area dedicated for men who dress up as women to perform musical numbers. Please do not stare or appear shocked. It must seem that you are at least somewhat comfortable with this world.”
“Dru, you used to be a lot more fun. Let’s just eat them.”
Lastly, in an attempt at British continuity, the first floor is the second floor in 'murica, the second is the third, etc. Also I tried to remember all my s's and u's. Apologies to the fine people of the UK for anything I've gotten wrong.
As she scanned the eager dancers, looking pensive, she gasped and pointed to a shadowy figure. “Oh, Spike, look. There’s Daddy. Hello, Daddy. Do you like my dollies? They’re a bit wiggly right now but I’ll put them right soon.”
“Can’t. Too tired.”
“Yes- yes sir!” John cried as he spread his legs obediently. He was rewarded with a light tap on his thigh, the leather just grazing his skin.
“That’s an erroneous cliché for the circumstance, as we have not struck any sort of bargain for us to be indebted to you.”
John danced with an abandon he hadn’t known himself capable of, sober anyway. But as he danced, his mind raced. On one hand, he was alert and ready for the confrontation. Sherlock’s performance of vulnerability was definitely provoking the soldier simmering always just beneath John’s surface.  At the same time, though, he was struggling to push away the fringe thoughts of self-consciousness that were doing their best to creep into his mind and distract him. The soldier was winning, though. Logically, he reasoned, even though Sherlock had found a place here, once, with these beautiful people- maybe even admired a few of them- the fact of the matter was, what they had together- now- was all that mattered. He’d opened his home and his head and his heart to John, and that was not something the reclusive detective did lightly. And John would do anything in his power to protect him.
John narrowed his eyes skeptically.
“It can’t be true though, right? There’s no such thing as vampires.”
“What if I told you I set it up? I tipped them off- oh, I see that makes you more angry.”
“No, Spike. Down!” She slapped at his face playfully.
Oh, and as to Angel, I know in BTVS canon he’s not really fighting the bad guys until 1996, but I took some liberties because I didn’t want to invent a slayer character (there’s a gap between Nikki and India), and I like the dynamic between Angel and Spike and Drusilla. Sorry if it offends, but hey, it’s an AU!
“You know what everything means. Do you often go to goth clubs?”
Sherlock flashed a him a predatory grin before continuing. “As I was saying, there is a certain… decorum in a club like Cities in Dust. Because there is an unstated understanding of discretion, people feel liberated to dress and behave in ways that are a bit… unorthodox. There will people in varying states of undress. Please restrain your libido enough not to ogle.”
“And us? What’s our plan?”
“But—”
John laughed as he climbed up onto the bed. He ran his hands lightly over Sherlock’s shoulders and down his chest before pushing him down backward. He began working his way up Sherlock's impossibly long body by trailing light kisses over his legs, nibbling on prominent iliac crests, leaving love bites on each of his ribs, licking a stripe up his sternum, and eventually biting down on the carotid artery. John was naming each body part in his head as he went in an effort to keep himself from losing control and ending this before he got a chance to really enjoy it. They’d waited so long, and John was committed to savoring every moment.
“The fucking paps won’t ever leave us alone after this. Of course I’m mad!”
“Fuck, Sherlock. You can’t just go into people’s rooms hitting them with riding crops in the middle of the night!”
The line is thin
“Sherlock, I still think there is no way that two people could pull this off alone,” Lestrade disagreed, ignoring their immaturity. “There are too many victims, in too short of a time.”
“Yes, sir.” John whispered, desperate.
“They won’t be able to keep up. Spike and Drusilla will be expecting them and will have taken precautions. These may be the most cunning killers I’ve ever encountered, John. Nothing will get past Drusilla. I still can’t work out how they have managed to kill so many people in such a short time without accomplices, but I’m absolutely certain she is the mastermind behind the operation.”
“Most likely not. Everyone goes to the Batcave, it’s the most popular goth club in London. I’m certain that all of Drusilla’s victims have been there at one time or another, but they won’t recruit from there. Too obvious.”
“Do we have a plan?”
“But I don’t WANT to go with Daddy. He’s not any fun any more. He used to be ever so much fun, too. Now he's just all guilt and rats.”
“I do know how you love a serial killer, Sherlock. But I’m not quite understanding how we get from there to ‘involved’.”
Two days passed without any sign of Drusilla or Spike. Sherlock sulked and lay on the couch in his trademark drooping pajama bottoms and silk robes. John made tea, tried to convince Sherlock to eat, and tried very hard not to think about what was under said drooping pajama bottoms and silk robes- or when exactly he’d finally be able to do the things he was trying very hard not to think about doing.
“Also, you were stuck and you needed my superior deductive skills.”
“You know it is the only way. John, you can stop lurking outside of the kitchen and come join us any time.”
“Eleven. Twelve. Thirteen,” he managed to choke out before Sherlock became angry with him.
“John, I believe we’ve both had some strongly held misconceptions turned on their head this week,” Sherlock said, taking John’s arms and turning him until they were facing one another. “If it’s possible that you love me, then how is it any less possible that there are creatures on this earth who live in the darkness and must consume blood to live?”
He will wait until
Never one to let his lovers suffer, he gladly complied. As he bit down on the pulsating artery, he shifted their hips to stretch himself over the lanky man beneath him. He slotted their legs together and felt Sherlock shudder, voice quivering as he sighed John’s name. John continued biting his way up Sherlock’s neck to his jaw, then pulled off to stop and admire his work.
“Damnit, he was still just a kid.” Lestrade snapped. They’d been standing silently around the figure on the examining table lost in their own thoughts, waiting for Sherlock to burst out with something brilliant. But instead of issuing a stream of scathing insults and astounding deductions, the detective was simply staring expressionlessly at the boy on the table. John could tell that something was really bothering him from the way he was holding tension in his shoulders and jaw. It wasn’t out of place for Molly, or even Lestrade to express anger or sadness at the more vulnerable victims that have passed through this room, but he’d never seen Sherlock so affected. Looking around, John realized that could see what no one else appeared to notice- that Sherlock Holmes really was capable of love.
Seeing no other choice, John shook his head and followed after Sherlock, who had wasted no time in chasing Drusilla up the ladder, over several rooftops, and into whatever trap they had waiting.
yes! finally our boys stop being such idiots and work it out! our sexy song today is love like blood by killing joke. not super sultry, but i feel like it speaks for our lovers pretty well.
John let the veiled insult toward his composure slide and focused instead on Sherlock’s earlier comment that he was familiar with this woman. With the door open, he couldn’t pass up the opportunity to pry into Sherlock’s past, which he now realized how little he knew about. “How much are you performing for this role, Sherlock?”
“Sure, love. But we should really hurry up and choose, yeah? Do you want any more dollies tonight?” He waved idly at the crowd of people who were still clamoring to catch their attention. “I’m a mite peckish tonight, could do with a few courses.” John realized that this cocky bloke didn’t even seem to mind that they were standing right there, could hear them perfectly, and that no one else seemed bothered by his comments.
Under moonlight
also, a few notes, "disco dolly" is a loose reference to one of the weirdest songs of a weird decade, "sex dwarf" by soft cell. listen to it sometime, it's a real trip.
'Til the fearless come and the act is done
“Yes! Yes sir.”
Cities in Dust is a combination of two of my old goth club haunts. I was initially going to have three club scenes in the story but I condensed it to two to move the story along, so I ended up mashing together The Embers in Portland (RIP) and Leeland’s City Club in Detroit. Oh, and I tossed in some waiters from the Silverado in Portland too, just for funsies and because that was one of my first eye-opening, hedonistically drunk experiences in Portland and it made me smile to think about old friends and good times while writing this.
It was nearly time to go, but John was pushing the boundaries of said punctuality. He seemed to be unable to stop gaping at himself in the mirror. He turned around again, and again, slowly. He’d barely registered Sherlock’s comment earlier about buying him jeans and a jacket, but now the reality of it was wrapped around him in denim and leather and buckles and chains. Left to his own devices, he always shopped for comfort first, style second. Now though he was reconsidering his style choices. He'd spent the last ten minutes checking out his backside in the mirror as well as he could, pondering how something as simple as a different pair of jeans could perform such a transformation The tapered leather jacket hit right above his waist, definitely accentuating his- finer qualities. [Well, fuck, maybe I should let Sherlock buy all my clothes. Of course he knew my exact measurements. At the very least I’d be sure to have more luck with women if I went out like this more often. Well, at least until they met Sherlock.] He glanced at his watch, which he'd dutifully left on the nightstand since Sherlock hadn't mentioned it as part of his outfit. He nodded his head once, determined, and decided that it was now or never. He’d been listening to Sherlock crashing around downstairs for the last hour, likely undoing all the tidying he’d done today. Bracing himself for anything, he went downstairs to survey the damage, sparing one last glance at his arse in the mirror.
“I was under the impression that the romantic part was when we get to soil them,” Sherlock said, intently watching John make short work of his own clothes.
Sure enough, Sherlock unconsciously brought his fingertips up to his carotid artery, gently, and licked his lips. John considered this point his. Before Sherlock could sneak in the last word, John picked up his journal, saying he’d be upstairs working on his next article until they left.
John knew he was fucked. Royally. And literally, hopefully. Sherlock hummed as he very gently smoothed the emerging welt with the leather tongue.  He took his time now, knowing that John was in utter compliance. John felt Sherlock teasing the whip over his sore left buttock. His skin erupted in goose bumps as Sherlock ghosted the whip over his Venusian dimples and down to the center of the unblemished cheek. He began a slowly unfolding spiral outward, around and around, larger and larger, until he had nowhere to go with the tip of the riding crop but straight down the crack of John’s arse.  Sherlock increased pressure as he passed John’s opening and slid down his perineum and John cried out, rutting forcefully against the bed.
“Sherlock, how can you honestly believe that it’s so hard to love you?”
“Noted. Stopping this-” John pressed harder into Sherlock’s hand- “right now.”
In the middle of the chaos, the real Sherlock stood silently observing the officers, though refraining from his typical stream of criticisms and admonitions. Occasionally he would look up wistfully at the window through which the “vampires” had vanished.
Irene didn’t appear bothered by Sherlock’s scorn. “You’ll see, Sherlock. But if you’re so certain, perhaps you’d like to place a small wager?” she offered suggestively.
Your sky all hung with jewels
“Okay, then. So, we’re basically just waiting then for them to kill again now, yeah? This kid-”
“If you could just tell us what you are avoiding telling us, Irene, rather than trying to distract ‘my’ John with your innuendo.” Sherlock drew the attention back to himself, and their reason for being there.
The cab arrived at Kali before John had a chance to press the issue. Sherlock manifested some bills from a mysterious hidden location and tossed them at the driver. They climbed out onto the kerb. “Into the fray, John,” Sherlock said as he handed the leash over.
It sends you spinning
The detective wrapped his arms and legs tightly around John, leaning in close as he was hoisted into the air. He took advantage of his proximity to John’s ear by rumbling his approval at this turn of events, punctuating his grunts with nibbles and bites on John’s earlobe. John realized that there was no way he’d make it up the stairs and headed toward Sherlock’s room, crossing the distance in record time.
“Sherlock.” John turned around and saw that Sherlock was now doing everything in his power to not make eye contact. “There is a picture of us in the Times.”
“I was hoping I’d get to see you dance again,” John smiled.
“Then what, Sherlock? Help us out here.”
Without saying a word, Sherlock turned around and looked at John. He walked over and gently took the ill-fated mugs of tea, setting them on the table. He took a step back and started moving his hips, dancing at half-time to the music. Holding eye contact, he slowly began unbuttoning the top button of his shirt. John felt his cheeks growing warm as he watched Sherlock caress his hands down his chest with the seductive grace of Salome herself. With each button Sherlock was revealing an expanse of flesh that made John actually begin to salivate. He hadn’t ever really thought that the stripteases were sexy, but never had he seen anything like this performance, even by the most convincing professionals. By the time Sherlock had finished with his shirt and was reaching to unfasten his trousers, John was using every drop of his willpower to keep from reaching out and helping the process along. Given the way that Sherlock was looking at him, he was pretty sure that he’d be reprimanded-- that Sherlock was intent on torturing him for as long as possible. Which was just fine, except he seemed to be having difficulty standing up. Always one to find a practical solution to his problems, he backed up slowly and sank into his chair. Sherlock’s lips twitched; apparently, he was enjoying rendering John helpless. He left off removing his clothes and began to advance toward John, crawling up and straddling John’s lap by tucking his calves into the creases of the chair.
Spike, who looked like he’d barely exerted any effort keeping up with them, appeared and grabbed Sherlock by the throat.
Sherlock looked out of the window silently.
At last, in a reversal of their earlier position, John found himself straddling a prone and flushed Sherlock. He took the opportunity to exact some revenge for his own earlier torture and began rotating his hips in time to the music still drifting in from the parlor. Sherlock threw his head back when John ground down, giving John the opportunity to admire the expanse of neck that lay before him. He decided that probably he should leave a message for Drusilla. Just in case. He leaned down and bit and sucked, occasionally stopping to blow gently on the heated skin which, John was happy to learn, made Sherlock wail quite beautifully.
Sherlock shifted so that he could reach John’s lips, kissing him deeply before saying, “No, John. I seem to have recently found my humanity, and I’m not ready to lose it, even for all of the time in the world.”
“Fine. I do have a plan, though. Lestrade has people placed throughout the club. He’s going in ahead of us as well- in fact you can go on in any time, Lestrade.”
As he spoke, Sherlock was leading him through a curtained doorway into a loud, pulsating room. They made their way to the bar and Sherlock used his magic to lure the bartender’s attention away from the clamoring crowd to order drinks. He pressed a pint into John’s hand, coiling his other arm around John’s waist. “Let’s get into character, shall we?” he rumbled into John’s ear, taking the opportunity to nip at his earlobe. John shivered in response, pressing back into Sherlock. Trust Sherlock to intuit that his earlobes were one of his most erogenous spots, though it seemed like basically anywhere Sherlock touched him was now an erogenous zone. Needing little encouragement, John downed his pint, slamming the empty glass on the bar. He turned around and gripped Sherlock’s hip tightly, likely leaving finger-shaped bruises, and began nibbling a line across Sherlock’s exposed clavicle. He reached up and slipped his fingers beneath the black leather collar, really appreciating how beautifully it contrasted against the pale expanse of Sherlock’s neck. He twisted the collar a bit, causing Sherlock to gasp at the sudden obstruction of his airflow. He pulled Sherlock lower, and began sucking a trail up the straining tendons to the marks he’d made earlier, gently nipping and lapping with his tongue and teeth. He was trying to go slowly, to employ all of his tools of seduction, but it was torture. He lost patience and latched on hard, causing Sherlock to press his neck deeper into John’s mouth, moaning and grinding a hint of an erection into John’s hip.
Sherlock considered before answering, “There was a time when this was a place of refuge for me. These people here deserve the same place of peace.”
With the salt of Sherlock’s sweat and skin on his tongue, and the almost unbearable sensation of their erections sliding against one another, it was the only coherent thought in John’s mind.
“Right. What are you on about, then?”
John glanced around looking for the man who had prompted their flight, but he was gone. John hoped that whoever he was, he was on their side. He seemed to be the only person that the couple was genuinely afraid of. Or at least annoyed by, which to psychopaths must be rather like being afraid, John thought. They exited the sanctuary of the goth club and tore through the raucous front room and past the ever-vigilant Irene, who was pointing grimly in the direction of an emergency door John hadn't noticed before. Followed by a couple of people John assumed were the promised backup, they stepped outside. Sherlock scanned the area. He decisively turned away from the line of people awaiting entry at the front door and ducked through an alley, John just a step behind. They eventually lost the coppers assigned to help them. They careened around corners, scaled fire escapes, and ran along rooftops for hours, until the sun’s rays began to peek over the horizon. John was exhausted, sore, and irritated by the time they returned home, but Sherlock was positively irate. As they climbed the stairs, Sherlock commenced a scathing rant about how two nitwits could not have possibly outsmarted him, loftily declaring that surely they must have had much smarter outside help, and began reciting an increasingly angry list of the ways in which they could have possibly escaped without leaving a viable trail for him to pick up. John nodded along sympathetically, hoping they weren't waking Mrs Hudson. Though he was certain that Sherlock wasn’t looking for reassurance, nor probably did he even notice John's presence. Sure enough, after tossing his coat onto John’s chair, Sherlock plopped himself down onto the couch in the reclining version of his thinking pose. John sighed, brooding over how promisingly the evening had started. He knew he wouldn’t get another word from Sherlock for at least several hours, no less be able to explore the ‘later’ that had been subtly promised. He trudged dejectedly up to his room to try to sleep for a few hours until Sherlock needed him again.
They lay together, catching their breath and lazily caressing each other, too exhausted to speak. Eventually, John rolled carefully off Sherlock, whose eyes followed him contentedly as he left the room to dispose of the spent condom and get a flannel. He took great pleasure in teasing the detective’s sensitized chest with the rough cotton, taking longer than necessary to clean the evidence of their lovemaking. He was still exhausted, so even though he felt a vague stirring at Sherlock’s breathy reaction when he grazed his still-erect nipples, he knew they’d have to wait for another go. He tossed the flannel aside, not really caring where it landed. Gathering up the mussed bedsheets, he folded himself into Sherlock’s waiting embrace and tucked the bedding around them.  He turned his head and kissed the parts of Sherlock that he could reach without moving too much until he began drifting off into sleep.
“Seems like not everyone appreciates the show,” John giggled, indicating Anderson’s presence with his thumb.
We'll cut the thick and break the thin
The killing time…
“Got it. Play up being your jealous lover because everyone wants to eat your ass.”
Given Sherlock’s writhing and pleading, it seemed he was enthusiastically in agreement.
Oh life, always thwarting my best plans to just sit and update this. Sorry again for the delay! I have shortened a couple of chapters, now, or rather they've broken off and taken on lives of their own. So the entire story will be extended to more than eight chapters. Perhaps it will be ten- who knows? I've always known where this story was going, but I was never entirely certain of the route.
“Fuck. Fuck me already, Sherlock.”
“Hey Sherlock, these folks look a bit different from the crowd at Cities in Dust.
Up in your arms, too late to beg you
“Well, at least it’s put me off sex for the time being. Or maybe forever. I could have lived a thousand lifetimes without seeing him in a mesh vest.”
“I gather I’ll have to spell this out for you. There haven’t been any victims for two days. Therefore they must be waiting for me, trying to draw me out. So we’ll go out tonight. We’ll have the upper hand if we provoke them- be able to set the stage, so to speak. You will need to act the part of the jealous lover once they confront us. The blond man is extremely emotionally volatile and easily goaded. He will be careless if enraged. I imagine you’ll have no difficulty with this. You have been sitting around here pining for two days, and you’re primed to react possessively when challenged. That you are my lover, no one in London doubts. In case you’re not aware, we’ve had quite a lot of write-ups in the local queercore zines. The community is really quite celebratory over the revelation that we have a romantic relationship.”
“Both.”
Sherlock raised his eyebrows, adding, “I’m glad to see that you have abandoned your tedious habit of insisting upon your heterosexuality in the public sphere.”
Thank you again for reading, commenting, and kudos! Stay tuned for the exciting next chapter again on Thursday!
“Why, though? I mean, think of what you could do with forever. Your mind, Sherlock. Think of it. Think of everything you could do with all the time in the world to learn things, to study, to investigate. You could be one of the greatest thinkers of all time. When you die it is going to be a great loss to the world, and you have a chance to avoid that!”
Of  a ragdoll dance
“What am I missing, Sherlock? Please tell me how there’s a rational explanation for what we saw. Please,” he was practically begging for some return to normalcy.
“Sherrrlock,” she purred.
The cab driver hadn’t even given them a second glance, an aspect of living in London that John was extremely grateful for- he hadn’t really thought through how they would look to the random observer. Now, nestled into the backseat, John began to worry about what the night had in store. They’d been so wrapped up in their personal tension that he’d nearly forgotten that they were about to go confront two psychopaths who had slaughtered dozens of innocent people.
“Oh, tiger, my eager little kitten. Don’t worry. Mummy will make you better. Stronger. And so beautiful, more beautiful than even you are now.”
“I do not ogle, Sherlock.” He added one of his favorite eye rolls for emphasis.
John started at Sherlock's rare use of the word 'please'. He really didn’t want to let Sherlock think he wouldn’t be absolutely chuffed to proclaim to the world that he was in- whatever- with the amazing Sherlock Holmes. He took a deep breath before answering. “Sherlock. I don’t give a rat’s ass of the entire commonwealth thinks I’m a fruit, or a naff, or whatever in-between.”
“Oh John, you’re so much more fun than a corpse.”
Sherlock’s hips were doing something sinful, and he started twisting his long, beautiful arms through the air, around himself, and eventually around John, teasing him mercilessly with his repeated advance and retreat. John realized self-consciously that he wasn’t moving again- he really needed to see to this Sherlock-induced paralysis- and began trying to mimic Sherlock’s motions. While watching the exquisite man dance was calming in itself, all of John's feelings of awkwardness were completely forgotten as Sherlock began singing along in his silky, rich baritone.
“Sherlock,” John warned out of habit, though as far as Sherlock’s interactions with Molly were, that was rather tame. He must really be distracted.
Introducing Irene in this capacity made me desperately want some Irene Adler/Pam from True Blood slash in this universe- one in which Pam convinces Irene to become a vampire, though at first Irene resists the idea because her only previous interactions with vampires were Spike and Drusilla, and they really put her off the idea. Perhaps one day I’ll write it, but probably not, so feel free to have at it if you feel this story needs to exist too.
Actual monsters or no, seeing Sherlock in danger was all that it took to move John to action. He leaped up, ready to intercept Drusilla. But just before he reached her there was a thunderous crash. Sirens and lights filled the hotel lobby as a stream of police burst through the now-demolished doors and windows. John breathed a sigh of relief, realizing that he wasn’t going to have to deal with this alone. Before any of the cavalry reached them, though, John looked over and saw Drusilla whisper something in Sherlock’s ear. Sherlock looked- angry? Disappointed? John was pulling himself back onto his feet, planning to head over and sort out what the hell Sherlock thought he was playing at, but decided that he would deal with that later as he watched their two captors practically scaling the walls to reach an upper-level window for escape. At this supernatural display, all but the most seasoned police had stopped in their tracks and were staring, stunned, as the couple seemed to fly up and out of their reach. Drusilla stopped for a moment, perched on the window sill, and looked back at John and Sherlock. Although she spoke in barely a whisper, John heard her voice clearly in his mind.
“In case- anyone- was still uncertain,” Sherlock whispered into the heavy silence.
“Alright-" Lestrade looked skeptical that Sherlock might derive help from anything he had to recount, but he continued anyway. "It’s a right gruesome one. There’ve been four staged crime scenes so far, each containing multiple victims. Cause of death was exsanguination. All of the victims have puncture wounds on the neck imitating vampire bites. The pathologist determined that these were, in fact, the wound they bled out from. Since there was no blood at the scenes we assume they were killed elsewhere and moved. There have been two different sorts of staged ‘scenes’. One type involved victims who were apparently culled from some of the goth clubs around town. These were the first and third scenes that we found. The victims were all well known in their circles as Victorian Goths, or Romantigoths, all frill and lace like. They’re posed as though they’re at a tea party in a doll’s house. Some of ‘em are still propped up around a table with dead flowers and tea cups filled with blood. Others looked like they’ve been tossed about, like dollies that someone got tired of. It’s a little unnerving how much it reminds me of my what my daughter’s playhouse looks like after she’s had a strop, actually, but with real bodies. Creepy. We can’t make heads nor tails of it. Anyway, the other type of scene is, um… well, for lack of a better term,  juvenile.”
You give yourself to him
Still teasing one another with both wordplay and touch, they started toward the raised dance floor. As they walked up the illuminated stairs, the haunting notes of a violin rang out over the crowd. People from dark corners began filling every empty space, dancing to the unearthly music. Sherlock took John’s hand and found an opening where they were able to fit into the ocean of bodies. John was unsurprised that Sherlock knew the song, or that he sang along into John’s ear whenever they came together in the dance.
“John, do you trust me?”
“Then it’s a good job you’re here now, John.”
John was busy struggling to push away rather explicit thoughts of what ‘later’ implied when he felt his attention hijacked. A man and a woman had entered the bar with a presence that immediately commanded everyone’s attention. He was handsome- Irene had been right about that. But he emanated a sort of smug superiority in his black jeans, floor-length leather duster, and his condescending sneer that John thought was a little bit overblown. The woman, though- she was unlike anyone John had ever seen before. She was small and looked quite fragile. She wore a dress that looked like it was a nightgown from the last century, its high lace collar and long sleeves belying a conservatism that was contradicted by the sheerness of the shift. John resolved not to try to deduce if she wore anything beneath. Her long, dark, unruly hair was loosely braided with dark blue ribbons. She seemed like she existed separate from time- from modernity. Her large, dark eyes were somehow both ageless and innocent as she scanned the denizens of the club. She spun and twirled and practically floated onto the other side of the dance floor. But although she was attracting the attention of everyone in the bar, and enjoying the attention, she was obviously dancing for an audience of one. Her partner followed her onto the dance floor, never taking his eyes off of her.
He went downstairs with big intentions, but stilled as soon as he saw Sherlock, staring in speechless wonder. Sherlock’s makeup was subtle, he’d chosen to only line his eyes, and to do something that made his skin look downright translucent. His hair was perfectly ratted again, a dark halo transforming him into a vision of a fallen angel. He was wearing the same leather trousers as before, but John didn’t really notice of a single one of these details. His attention was fixated on the fact that Sherlock had also omitted to wear a shirt. Instead, he wore a simple leather collar with an attached chain leash looped in his hand. And he was wearing John’s dog tags.
Through the zero hour we'll walk
John had quickly deduced that Irene Adler was as cunning and perceptive as Sherlock himself. He was pretty certain that she saw right through their ruse and he worried slightly at her giving them away. He was also sure that she knew that he was in- whatever he was for Sherlock- and that for some reason she was trying to get a rise out of him . He was nervous that she could put them in even more danger than they needed to be in.  Sherlock must have had the same concern because he seemed to be making an effort to save John from embarrassment, which was completely out of character for the self-proclaimed sociopath. [He’s probably just warning me to stay in character, what with me being the dim one of the bunch.] He was trying to work out how this version of John Watson was supposed to be reacting to this situation when Sherlock wrapped his arm around his waist. Of all the options he'd considered, he was pretty sure he wasn’t supposed to startle quite so violently when his ‘boyfriend’ touched him. He’d have to definitely work on that.
“We dance, John. We dance and observe. Look for anyone who seems to be drawing people to them, attracting followers. Anything that sounds your intuitive alarms.”
Lestrade looked at the file in his hand. “He's from Hackney. He was reported missing in 1983- he was sixteen. Looks like the lazy bastards working his case wrote him up as a runaway and closed it within a couple of weeks. His parents didn’t seem to press the issue.”
Mine.
The cab ride had been… well, excruciating. John had been trying desperately to focus on the last minute information Sherlock was giving him about the case, which was important. Very important. But most of his attention was on his fingers, which were still trembling in remembrance of their contact with Sherlock. Not that it had been the first time John had touched him, not by a long shot. He was always patching him up in some way or another after an explosion,  or sometimes after an altercation with an angry client. But it had been the first time he was able to touch Sherlock in a way that even hinted at how he wanted to touch him. How he dreamed about touching him. Somewhere down that dangerous train of thought, he realized that Sherlock had stopped talking and was looking through him wearing his most self-satisfied smirk.
“Interesting.”
“Did you think we didn’t know about your planted coppers? Eh? That the muppet wouldn’t know what you were doing? Well, fooled you din’ I? No one knows where you are. No one will find you.”
Finally, Sherlock seemed to be satisfied with what he saw. His eyes blazed and he growled triumphantly as he took the three steps that had been all that separated them. He swooped down, grabbing John’s face and crushing their mouths into a maelstrom of finally- blissfully- requited passion. And it was everything. John didn’t hesitate now, throwing himself into reciprocating the frantic movements of Sherlock’s very clever, very talented tongue. Teeth scraped against teeth, lips slid and sucked and consumed. John slid his arms around Sherlock’s waist and pulled him closer, trying desperately to eliminate any remaining space between them. He slid his hands higher up Sherlock’s back, pulling their chests together. Sherlock hadn’t let go of his face, and John pressed into his hands, relishing the feel of Sherlocks’s long, violin-calloused fingers against his stubble. John finally had to turn his head aside to gasp for air, eliciting a very typically Sherlockian huff. But as John latched onto Sherlock’s neck, acting on his earlier fantasy and marking Sherlock exactly where he’d stroked earlier, the petulant huff turned into a low moan, which John decided immediately was the sexiest thing he’d ever heard. He released Sherlock’s neck, glancing at his handiwork and moving his hand toward Sherlock’s arse when Sherlock grabbed John’s arms and stilled.
Cracking thought the walls
“I’ve been keeping extra surveillance on our guests over the last several weeks. Like you, I’ve been certain that the police were being rather slow to realize that these events were connected. You know I like to run a tight ship, and I very much dislike the idea of someone- or someones- coming into my nightclub and killing my paying guests.” She paused.
A new song came on. John stepped back a few paces; he wanted to be able to be at hand if Sherlock should require him. He leaned against the rail that encircled the dance floor. While he was debating if he had time to nip over to the bar and get that drink, he picked up some of the lyrics and chuckled at the thought that either Irene Adler or the DJ seemed to have a great sense of humor.
It's o.k.
“Sherlock—” John choked out. “Lube.”
John pushed himself over and groaned as his now aching erection pressed between the mattress and his stomach. Before he could adjust it and maybe give it a little tug or two to take the edge off, Sherlock brought the riding crop down on his newly exposed arse cheek, though not as hard this time.
The killing moon
Eyebrows raised, “Indeed?”
“Hearing them again from you may provide new insight. Please proceed.”
“Look at them all, all the little dollies, Spike. They dance for me. Not these two, though. Dance, dollies!” She looked pointedly at John and Sherlock, who made no move to do as she requested.
It sends you spinning
“You’re fucking right it makes me angry! Now the whole city thinks-” he couldn’t quite decide how he wanted to finish that sentence.
“He is- was so pretty.  I bet he was really popular,” Molly added dreamily.  “Oh, Sherlock, maybe you-”
“John. I’m deadly serious. Do you trust me?”
“Eli,” Sherlock stated coldly.
“They know who we are now- that was the point of enlisting the paparazzi. But I didn’t count on them targeting my people so quickly.” Sherlock sounded irate now.
“What? That they’re actually vampires?”
Calling like a distant wind
“I know you can. You’re so clever. Now, John. Tonight we’re only going to go to twenty, and I know you can do that. You’ll want more, but you need time to adjust to this. So I’ll exercise self-restraint, though it will be difficult for me as well. If you’re very, very good then perhaps I’ll let you suck me off afterward. Would you like that, John?”
And get me out
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mine.
Following the footsteps
“I’m hurt, John. Just because your tiny mind can’t keep up-”
Sherlock nodded, his ratted curls brushing against John’s cheek. “Against the world,” he whispered.
“But I’m right.”
“Probably not,” Lestrade agreed. “Well, it seems he was pretty well-known in the club scene in recent years. He’s got a couple of minor infractions, all in or near the clubs.”
Spike snarled, but obediently released Sherlock. John was relieved- he was afraid he was going to have to use deadly force before Sherlock got the information that he wanted, and he wasn’t certain if not solving the case would put Sherlock off sex that night and was glad he didn’t have to take the risk. As he was struggling to regain control over his simmering rage, Drusilla leaped impossibly high and brought down the stair to a fire escape above her head and shocked his anger right out of him.
“Two.”
John opened his eyes. He could barely make out Sherlock’s tall- and rather nude looking- form from the light of the hall. “What the hell, Sherlock? What’s so urgent that you couldn’t even put on a robe?”
“What happened to ‘married to the work’?”
“And you needed to wake me at arse-o’-clock to tell me?” John was getting a little nervous. Knowing Sherlock, this could either be very good or very bad.
So soon you’ll take me
No sound to break no moment clear
Sherlock looked back at John, “Whenever you desire.”
“The plan is to capture these people as quickly as possible and then return to our flat to finish what we started.”
Still, John was having a difficult time ignoring Sherlock’s silent demands for his attention. He was practically vibrating with the effort of waiting as patiently as he could (though his patience was on par with a toddler on cocaine) for John to notice that he had something important to say. John finally sighed and put down his paper, giving in to his curiosity- though he was tempted to let Sherlock suffer a bit longer in retribution for last night’s chemistry fiasco that had ruined the lovely takeaway he’d been dreaming of during most of that day’s clinic duty.
John wasn’t quite satisfied with that answer, but he knew from Sherlock's dismissive tone that it was the best he would get and dropped it. Sherlock turned to follow Lestrade inside. John reached for his arm, pulling him back around to look at him. He asked quietly, “This is personal for you, isn’t it?”
Confusion flickered across Sherlock’s face for a moment. John couldn’t help but gloat a little at the fact that he could surprise Mister Know-It-All. Sherlock’s focus narrowed sharply, piercing through John, searching for any signs of deception. Slowly, a mischievous smile crept from his full, dark lips to his lined eyes. He turned around seductively, offering John a spectacular view of his leather-clad arse as he offered up the offending laces. As part of the aftershock of his brazen declaration, John's lungs had decided to join his limbs in their stupor. He reminded himself that he should know, as a doctor, that one should remember to breathe. He looked away from Sherlock from a moment, regaining his composure.  Once he had oxygen flowing properly to all of his limbs again, he made the rest of his way downstairs. His normally steady surgeon’s hands trembled a little as he took the laces from Sherlock's pale hand. He pulled them tighter through each eyelet with a little more force than was probably necessary.
“I don’t know, Dru, from everything I’ve heard he’s a right prat. I’m not sure I want him around all that much.”
John pushed down a stab of jealousy at Sherlock’s obvious admiration of the mysterious Irene Adler. “Please remember that I’m one of those posers tonight, you snob.”
“No, you definitely do not always have a plan, Sherlock.”
“Hmph,” John replied.
“Let’s just get on with it, pet, if you want to turn him by morning.”
“John, I am unable to lace this corset alone. I require your assistance.”
“You’re welcome,” Irene called after their retreating figures. “And you’ve got a tab with both bars. Tip your bartenders.”
The subject of Sherlock’s gaze was a beautiful and androgynous youth. His naturally dark, straight hair was dyed a deep shade of crimson. His delicate features were accentuated with a touch of eyeliner and the barest hint of a deep red stain on his now forever pale lips. John heard Molly Hooper arrive, then stand hesitantly in the doorway fidgeting nervously, toying with her messy side-ponytail and pushing up her large tortoiseshell glasses. Sherlock ignored her for as long as he could stand- which was about four minutes- before he snapped. “Yes, Molly, do come in and share whatever dazzling insights you’re sure to provide.”
A love like blood
Tears were threatening to form in John’s eyes. Those were the words he didn’t know he needed to hear. Still, he needed to be practical. Greater good and all.
“Are you with me again, John?”
“Your precious image of heterosexuality can be regained. As soon as this case is over, we will be certain to alert the world to our deception. You can write it up in your magazine serial- The Case of The Ouch My Masculinity, if you will. But I remind you, you consented to this cover. And now we have criminals to catch, so can you please stay focused for another day or two until I can resolve this case?”
Sherlock sighed and turned away. He hesitated for a moment and then walked out of the kitchen, but not before John saw that Sherlock’s eyes were now suspiciously glassy. Why was Sherlock running away? Did he go too far? He knew that Sherlock wasn’t generally comfortable with emotional displays, but he’d thought they’d gotten past that. He grabbed the cooling tea and followed into the living room, just as the detective was lowering a needle on the record player. There was a brief, rather harsh distorted instrumental introduction, and then a haunting voice began,
Sherlock was moving his mouth as if to protest John’s withdrawal, but all he was managing were incoherent huffs and moans. But although he couldn’t form words, Sherlock was finding other ways to communicate exactly what he wanted. He encircled John’s head with one hand, pulling him back down insistently to his neck. With his other hand, he began trailing his fingers feather-lightly down John’s spine, dipping down the curve of his lumbar region, up the curve of his arse, and then more forcefully into the crevice. When he reached John’s entrance, he lingered, rubbing circles around the sensitive flesh. There was no way this was going to last as long as John had hoped.
“You said, Sherlock. And I’d remind you that your own views on punctuality are rather opportunistic. Wait- did you say- what are you going to do to my hair?”
“But I don’t want to,” she whined, plucking at Sherlock’s sleeve. “I’m not done playing with my kitty.”
We must play our lives like soldiers in the field
Basking in his rapt attention, she twirled around a few times, singing to herself and laughing with the sort of manic joy that only small children and the highly medicated are capable of. Spike leered at Sherlock as he and Drusilla slowly closed in on the detective. John took a tentative step backward, then another, trying to avoid notice. He stilled his breath, tensing his muscles and preparing to pull his gun and shoot them at the first signal from Sherlock, but when he realized that it seemed Sherlock was actually going along with this madness he decided that he was going to have to take matters into his own hands, despite near-certain recrimination from Sherlock later about foiling his plans. Banking on the fact that on occasion Sherlock admitted that he needed John to save him from his own arrogance and stupidity, John made the executive decision that this was one of those times. Who cares if they found out exactly how these monsters did it? They had basically had the killers caught red-handed and what they had was enough to justify acting in self-defense. John focused firmly on the expanding wave of calm that was filling his center, his anchor of stillness that prepared him for instant and decisive action.
“No, John. I merely helped him. I have no interest in taking advantage of those unable to provide informed consent.”
Currently, John was sitting in his favorite chair. His tea was forgotten and cold next to him, and he was shaking his head and cursing under his breath angrily at the daily Times. Sherlock was sitting across from John, fidgeting and glaring at the paper as though it had personally offended him. Since Sherlock so often insisted that he had no time for politics and left John to his mutterings, John deduced that the object of his frustration was likely himself and not the contents of the paper. He did his best to give no indication that he noticed Sherlock's distress while he finished the article that he was reading about Margaret Thatcher’s new public policies.  John’s time serving in the Falklands had given him good reason to be tetchy with the prime minister, and he often muttered at the paper, but his typical stoicism only gave way to his real opinions after a few pints at the pub. Anyone who drank with him could predict that after his fourth lager he’d be sure to brandish his favorite Borges quote about the war being like two bald men fighting over a comb. Though he was pretty sure that whatever Sherlock had to say would probably be preferable to the tripe he was reading right now, he was intent on refusing to give in to Sherlock’s churlishness.  He let his mind wander from the paper and started thinking about his flatmate.  John knew that Sherlock's alleged indifference to politics was a ruse, and that Sherlock agreed completely with John on the PM. Sherlock cared deeply for the network of homeless people whom he’d amassed to help him solve his crimes, and John knew that it bothered him immensely that Thatcher’s policies were killing them. Sherlock paid his network lavishly to act as spies. John had also found Sherlock helping many people in accessing medical care (now easier with John’s help), or even entering university. As such, he had a large and loyal following on the streets of London. But their numbers were growing, and despite Mycroft’s lofty insistence otherwise, everyone knew that it was Margaret Thatcher’s fault. Mycroft had tried to enlist their help in tracking down the organizers of last year’s assassination attempt. Sherlock had looked him and Mags in the eye and stated calmly that he would do it only to help the assassins complete the job next time, and to thereafter never be found. Mycroft had since stopped bothering Sherlock with government requests.
“I’m sure he’s quite satisfied, Irene. We’re here on business, anyway. If you’ll remember.”
“Irene.”
Keep me walking
Drusilla, though. She seemed to have transformed completely from their previous meeting. Last time she’d had something of a childlike demeanor beneath her sensuality and power, but tonight she emanated nothing but pure purpose and rage. She strode inhumanly lithely toward John and Sherlock, reaching them within moments of their noticing her arrival. Spike followed her, remaining just a step behind a bit subserviently, but taunting them as soon as they were within hearing range.
“Please what, John?”
https://www.residentadvisor.net/features/1917
“Drusilla won’t be satisfied with just one victim. And now they’re fixated on me- don’t fret, John. That was the plan, after all. No, they’ll be back for me before Spike gets a turn. It’s Sunday, Cities in Dust will be closed until Thursday. They may wait to try again at the club, but it’s more likely that they’ll be too impatient and they’ll make a move sooner- especially when they see our write-up in the paper. I don’t think they knew who I was last night, but now that they know I consult with the police they’ll be impatient to get me out of the way, and to prove their superiority over such mundane 'human' institutions. My guess is that they’ll come after us in a couple of days. No matter, I’m formulating a plan. I’ll be ready for them.”
“Oh John, again you see, but you do not observe.”
John pushed down his anger. He knew Sherlock wasn’t used to considering others’ feelings, and that he was trying. But he also knew that he had to make himself very clear, lest the detective get any ideas in the future. “If something had happened to you, and I hadn’t had even a chance to prevent it, I wouldn’t be safe. Not from myself. I would have carried that guilt with me forever.”
“Sorry, Greg. He means-” John  started.
“It’s alright, I haven’t been very forthcoming about details about my previous life. I’m sure you have many assumptions that I’ll prove wrong.” He gave John a half-smile, then his expression changed to something sinister. “He was in my homeless network. He may have been targeted.”
“Obviously.”
“I-I’m John,” he blurted. [Oh, smooth, John. Real smooth.] Sherlock smirked down at him knowingly. [Oh great, and that git’s enjoying the hell out of this too, likely.]
You hear a laughter
“Yes, John. It seemed rather urgent that I test this hypothesis.” Sherlock stalked toward John’s bed slowly, his voice so deep he was practically growling. “You see, John, I have been developing a theory that you want me to spank you. Shh, before you protest, remember that I never make an assertion without proper evidence. You see, I began working on this particular theory based on the way you were looking at my riding crop last week. You thought I didn’t notice, but you should know by now that I notice EVERYTHING, John, especially when it pertains to you. I observed that as you watched me strike the corpse in the morgue you displayed multiple signs of arousal. Your pupils dilated, your face was flushed, you were producing a rather alarming amount of saliva, and you were stroking your hip repeatedly in the same location as I was thrashing the corpse with this.” Sherlock had finally made it to the side of the bed, and John watched in tortured silence as Sherlock produced his riding crop from the shadows, wrapped his long fingers around its shaft, and began teasing up and down, up and down. “And, John, if that was not evidence enough- which of course it was- the fact that your penis looks painfully engorged as I recall these events tells me everything that I need to know. So be a good little soldier, then, and turn onto your stomach.”
So cut the rose in full bloom
“Sherlock-”
Sherlock did his best impression of a smug cat. “Please fill John in on the details of the case.”
“Don’t I always?”
“So you won’t be needing the fag, then?” Just because they dressed in bondage gear and went out clubbing now didn’t mean John was going to let Sherlock think he could smoke too.
She sighed. “I can’t wait until my tiger is ready and I have someone fun to play with.”
Sherlock blinked a few times. They passed another two blocks in silence before Sherlock resumed his dialog as though he hadn’t been completely distracted. “I am personally acquainted with the owner of this club. You may find her appearance rather extreme- or perhaps not, given your newly revealed depths. Should I assume that you have a deep hidden knowledge of goth culture as well as gay culture, John?”
“John.” Sherlock’s voice called out from the darkened doorway.
John laughed, breaking the tension of the moment. He took a deep breath and adjusted himself in his jeans. “Well, then finish up this case quick please. I’d like to get back to this as soon as possible.”
John turned around, half hoping that Sherlock would maul him again, but instead Sherlock reached into the chair cushion and brought out his riding crop. He handed it to John and said, smirking, “One must always remember to accessorise appropriately.”
Lestrade rubbed his eyes. “I still don’t like it, mate.”
“Hm. To the point, though, if we do not catch them tonight, I fear we’ll miss our opportunity for several weeks, as the other killer’s victims seem to be chosen randomly from the larger population. We’ll have to be vigilant. And as you’ve perhaps picked up from your daytime telly, John, these people have enough public animosity toward them without also being a haven for serial killers. The talk shows are always accusing them of Satanistic rituals and the like. I’d like to solve this as quickly as possible.”
“Mm, he seems a bit neglected, Sherlock. You may want to reconsider after your case is solved. Perhaps your John will find himself with some free time.”
Sherlock flushed, but just barely. “I’m sure you’ll be brilliant.”
You pour yourself over me
“Obviously.” Sherlock turned to follow the couple out the door, John in tow.
And then he lost his focus, and in fact, all sense of reason as Spike and Drusilla’s faces distorted into something that John’s mind had no reference for outside of half-remembered Sunday School images of demons. Their foreheads elongated and warped into grotesque ridges. Their eyes burned with glowing yellow fire. But most disturbingly, it looked like their teeth were growing into actual fangs! Sparing a moment to wonder if they’d been drugged, his typical steadfast demeanor and preparedness failed him and he fumbled backward and fell over his own feet onto the floor. There was no way he could have prepared himself for this. A rational part of his brain was trying to get his attention, insisting that this was likely some sort of fantastic special effects and that there was no way this was really happening, but it was silenced immediately when the creatures seemed to blink out of existence and reappeared directly behind Sherlock. John tore his eyes away from the monsters, looking to Sherlock in hopes of finding some sort of rational explanation, some hope, but instead saw him simply close his eyes serenely, tipping his neck as though inviting Drusilla’s impending bite.
Sherlock fidgeted with the lacing on his thigh. “Indeed.”
“No, Lestrade, it’s not drugs,” Sherlock sighed, though his words didn’t carry their usual snark.
“Oh- um- Sherlock, I didn’t mean...” [Shit, John. Shut up.]
“I’ll be in touch.” With that, Sherlock turned and strode out the door, coat billowing behind him dramatically.
This was most certainly not a situation he’d ever expected to be in. Although they had pretty much both admitted that they wanted to jump each other, John hadn’t even had time to hope that they’d be able to negotiate this sort of thing into their- whatever the hell was going on. Apparently he was taking too long to turn over though, because the next thing he knew Sherlock brought the crop down sharply on his hip, exactly where he’d been describing John rubbing it. It didn’t feel nearly as nice as John had hoped it would, either.
You lift me up
“One.” It hurt more than John expected, but his arousal was almost unbearable anyway and he was glad for something to distract him. He wasn't sure he'd last very long in the state he was in.
A love like blood
John was growing dizzy with heat and lust and a little bit of asphyxiation. Sherlock pulled off, slowly, and sighed. John was still collecting his wits when he saw Sherlock fix his attention somewhere behind him. He watched as Sherlock’s face affected an expression of pure irritation. Just as quickly as it was there, though, it was replaced with a smug grin. With an almost inappropriate amount of childlike delight Sherlock looked at John and said, “Showtime.”
Sherlock nodded, still looking uneasy. “Good. We are going to let them lead us to their lair tonight, letting them believe that I am their willing victim. Since your acting skills are- lacking-” John punched him in the arm halfheartedly, but Sherlock continued as though uninterrupted. “You will act as though you are coming along to humor me, and to protect me, but that you don’t believe in the legitimacy of their claim to vampirism.”
