Dean looked excited for a few seconds before his expression shifted. He looked… nervous? “What’s going on Cas? Did I miss something? This wasn’t a date night, right?” His eyes raced back and forth as he wracked his brain.
The woman giggled and gave him a wide smile. “I just
“You’re gonna make me blush.”
“Really? Why?”
“Oh, hey man. Haven’t had a chance to introduce myself. I’m Dean.” He held his hand over the wall for the other man to shake.
“I figured. Listen, I don’t wanna speak badly about your mom but… you gotta realize that anything that happened between them should stay between
It was still early, so the place was mostly empty. Castiel’s gaze swept the room before landing on the back of his brother’s head. He was sipping a soda at the end of the bar and nodding to something Ellen was saying. The woman who was like a mother to Dean, and who had become one to Castiel as well, looked up as he walked closer. Her face broke out in a wide grin and she tucked a lock of her light brown hair behind her ear as she came around the bar to pull him into a hug. “Cas, honey. It’s good to see you.” She pulled back to study his face, her brown eyes sparkling with affection. “It’s been a few weeks since I’ve seen you boys. How are you?”
But he still kept dwelling on it. He really had no right to say anything. He’d just spent the last three hours in his underwear playing a virtual card game. He didn’t own his own house; he rented an apartment with Sam. He hadn’t been in a relationship in almost a year. Seriously? What the hell right did he have to act so high and mighty? That dude, chick?, was right. He should at least try World of Warcraft before he bashed it.
Dean stared at it for a minute before sighing. This was all supposed to be for fun right? He gripped the offered hand. “Yea whatever. Fine.”
Cas frowned in concentration. “I remember you getting here… Did- did I cry on you?” Cas looked mortified.
Castiel tried to look intimidating, but wasn’t sure if he pulled it off. He dropped his voice, “I should teach you a lesson.”
Dean turned his head for a chaste kiss. “You too babe. I’m ready.” Castiel started moving slowly before Dean huffed. “Nuh uh. Fuck me harder Cas. Wanna feel you for days.”
“I love you too.”
Castiel sighed. “No. We’re not ordering them off of Amazon. We have to spend at least forty-five days in Brazil before we can bring them home.”
He glanced down at his watch. It had been almost ten minutes. That seemed like a long time. She may be stuck with another patient. Castiel went through his phone while he waited but grew more agitated by the minute. Now that he was aware how long he’d been waiting, it was hard to ignore. Ten more minutes passed until the nurse returned. “Here is the information the doctor wanted to pass along to you. Call if you need anything.” She handed him a stack of papers and pamphlets and left.
“Cas!” his husband’s voice broke through his mental spiral.
“No! No Cas, they’re ok. Uh- well…” Dean floundered but Castiel just waited patiently. His husband dropped his face into his hands and shook his head.  He took a fortifying breath and sat up. “So, after we left, Hannah started complaining to Anna about how you’re always getting sick and that you’re just doing it for attention.”
“Dean?”
“Mr. Adler, I’ve never made a mistake like this before and it will never happen again.”
She looked hurt and angry. “Why would he tell you and not me?”
“I think we should. The doc said this is what you had to do and you’re thinking about not doing it.”
“Sure.”
So, Dean told him his life’s story. Losing his mom; dealing with his dad. John Winchester may not have been abusive, but he was neglectful. He checked out most of the time. The best times were during football season. Only then would he really make an effort to spend time with his boys. Didn’t take a psychologist to see why Dean became such an invested fan.
“If that’s what you want. I’d give it some more thought though. I know how much you love this house Cas.”
“We both did. Spent over an hour picking stuff out for you.”
Dean pushed into the room and dragged Cas to sit next to him on the bed. “What’s wrong? Is it what I said?”
Castiel snorted at his friend’s floundering and climbed out of the car. He leaned in before shutting the door. “Thanks, Bal.”
“What?!?”
The next two months were insane. The Saturday after the life-changing e-mail, Dean and Castiel hosted a cookout in their backyard. They invited their families and friends to the party and once everyone had eaten, they showed the reveal video through a projector aimed at a sheet stretched across the lawn. Gabriel had helped him edit it to cut out the naughty bits the day before, much to his disgust (which was made worse when Castiel requested a copy of the full video). At the end, they added a copy of the letter from the agency and the photo of the children. Naturally, Gabriel had wanted to record the larger reveal to post on social media and Castiel gladly agreed.
With that, Castiel disappeared through his back door and Dean returned to his party.
“You really should be nicer to your dad.”
Castiel stared at the other man with wide eyes. “That’s- that’s terrible.”
“Lemme see.” His husband gently pulled the rag away and hissed. “Crap, Cas. That’s gonna need stitches and you need to get checked out. Vomiting after a head injury means you may have a concussion.”
He felt his cheeks go a little pink. Castiel nudged her “Don’t scare him, Meg.” He turned to Dean and held out his hand. "It’s nice to meet you, Dean.”
Lisa giggled. “Yes. Between you and me, I think Ben has a little crush on her.”
“I don’t think I like your tone Joanna.”
Dean followed. “What’s up with you?”
“I shouldn’t be—”
“He’s sure somethin’.” Dean just realized what a golden opportunity he’d stumbled across. “Lookin forward to riding him like a bronco.”
The testing took two weeks. Before leaving the office that first day, Castiel had another hearing test and something called an electrocochleography, or ECoG. The purpose of the second test was to measure the pressure of Castiel’s inner ears. The nurse informed them that Dr. Adamson would call them with the results and scheduled Castiel for further testing.
“I doubt that Cas. You’re not sick all the time. If it was serious, I think it would be affecting you in other ways.”
“Dean, I know what your father did to you. It’s too much to put on a child.”
Dean brought their lips together before kissing each of Castiel’s cheeks. “I love you.”
Impala67: well…. no
Castiel looked at his feet. “Are you sure you don’t want to talk?”
Castiel and Dean both let out a sharp gasp. Dean cleared his throat. “T-today?”
“What’s for—” Dean stopped as he caught sight of the box from Gabriel’s bakery. “Is that pie?”
“No! No. That’s not it ok? I- I don’t know to be honest. Something left over from my dad, I guess.” Castiel watched him carefully as he spoke. “Ballet is hard, I know that. I don’t think less of you. It’s impressive. I really admire male dancers. Y’all have to lift the girls and make it look effortless and you have to be flexible and in shape and… no. I don’t think ballet is just for women.”
Just after Dean left the room, Patience came in. “Hey baby. Want to help me set the table?”
The sidewalk in front of the bar was crowded with people who’d stepped out to take a break or have a smoke. He weaved his way through the black and gold colored fans and reached the bar. He nodded a greeting to Benny and ordered a beer. He could afford one or two. Leaning back against the bar as he took a sip of his beer, Dean scanned the crowd. He recognized a lot of regulars before his eyes landed on a new, yet still familiar, face. He walked over to the dark-haired man and waved to get his attention.
It took Dean a second to register what she said. “What do you—”
Castiel interpreted that for Dean before answering. “You are going to stay with us but not in this house. We live far away in America. We are going to fly in an airplane to get there. Would you like to live with us?”
“It’s good to see you too, Ellen. I’ve been busy at work and wanted a break from cooking. Naturally, you were my first choice for dinner. You serve the best burgers after all.”
Cas smirks. “I may have a few ideas.”
He barely heard Gabriel shout, “I’m your only brother!” before starting the car. With a grin and a final wave, he backed out of his spot and headed for home.
“He went to talk to the kids and get someone to stay with them. How’re you holding up Clarence?”
“Ok? What did they do?”
Castiel waved his hand in protest. “No, well, yes technically it was, but not the way you think. I did mention to Naomi that I spoke with you, but it was only to mention how understanding you were when I asked you to keep the noise down once it got late.”
“It’s too big, Dean.”
Castiel tilted his head thoughtfully. “I think we should go back to the beginning.” He reached over and held out his hand. “Castiel Novak. I like honey bees and playing the occasional prank.”
“Not really. She just sorta shows up around the square ya know?”
Dean pulled back in mock-offense. “Hey!”
“You wouldn’t get it.” He growled out.
“It just frustrates me how she kept blowing me off.”
. Understand?”
“Psh! I was starting to like you kid.”
“All part of the master plan babe.”
The next week, Castiel had his appointment with the ENT. The older man came in and didn’t even introduce himself. He was dismissive and only asked a few questions.
Dean composed himself and answered. “This is our third date.” He shot Claire his most charming smile. “Figured I should meet the most important person in his life before we got too serious.”
“You want some medicine?”
Dean looked at the paper over his shoulder. “Thanks, Doc.”
Dean nearly stomped through the agency while Castiel moved in a daze. No wonder Max was so closed off. He was kept away from the only family he had left and the language barrier only exacerbated his isolation. Trauma was hard enough to deal with when you had support. Castiel couldn’t fathom how the little boy was expected to cope when he felt so alone.
Patience’s eyes grew wide. “This is for me? To keep?”
Four months after returning from Brazil, it was early October. Castiel, Dean and the children had spent their Saturday at the costume store picking out the kids’ Halloween costumes. Patience chose a fairy, Alicia wanted to be a witch, and Max picked one of the characters from his favorite show: PJ Masks.
Beeping from the moving van backing into the driveway had the man turning to walk towards it. His eyes met Castiel’s then and he gave a friendly wave which Castiel returned before turning back to his gardening. He knew how stressful moving could be without nosey neighbors jumping on the new arrival before they’d settled in. There would be plenty of time to get to know the man later.
Impala67: im really sorry about before. i was a dick
“That sounds fluey. Come on, Cas. If you feel that bad, you should be in our bed. Don’t wanna get Max sick.”
“Hold on.” Gabriel ran to his car and pulled a bag out of the trunk. He came back and handed it over. “My camera is in there. You remember how to use it?” Castiel nodded. “It’s got a full battery and plenty of space on the memory card. Hide it somewhere to record when you tell him. It’ll be great to show the kid one day. Just…
Castiel shifted his weight. “Dean is a good friend of mine. He wanted to join us today so he could meet you.”
He got to the office with five minutes to spare and had to go straight into his morning meeting.
“The descriptions are on the website.”
“Losers?” Dean cringed. He turned around to see the instructor standing behind him. “Is this what you think of my students?”
Castiel turned exasperated eyes on him. He could feel how puffy his face was but Dean just waggled his eyebrows. That startled a chuckle out of him and he couldn’t stay upset in the face of Dean’s antics. “You’re ridiculous.”
WaywardAngel: Us losers tend to be nice people. You’re attitude wouldn’t win you any friends.
Right now, Cas needs to learn how to
“He’ll be alright. They’re all fine, I promise. I’ve been going back twice a day and Gabe would sit with you while I was gone. You’ve been here three days, babe.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“And he told you that those higher ones always go first?”
“See you at the finish line Dean.”
“I don’t understand. Wouldn’t that make my vision blurry?”
“Oh, God. He was in
Gabriel was more subdued than usual but Castiel chalked it up to the day’s events. When they got home, Sam was asleep on the couch but Ellen was acting odd as well. The older woman would barely meet his eyes while she provided a brief run through of what the kids had done before going to sleep. She seemed to be in a hurry to leave, but promised to return the next day to help with the kids while Castiel recovered. Dean walked her out while Castiel changed into pajamas. The doctor said he could sleep, but had to be woken every two hours which was why Sam was staying.
Finished with the bandages, the doctor pulled her gloves off. “Well Castiel, you do appear to be exhibiting signs of a concussion. But at the moment, I’m more concerned with your other symptoms. What you’re describing could be a lot of things, MS, migraines, a tumor, Meniere’s disease. While you’re here, I’d like to get an MRI. We can get a better look at your head injury and see if there’s something neurological that’s causing this vertigo. Is that ok?”
“Fifteen of those days are for interviews and paperwork and thirty are for the child to live with us. It gives them a chance to get used to us and for us to learn a bit of their culture. There are also regular meetings with their caseworker.”
And then there was Jack. Jack’s adoption was finalized last year. Dean and Castiel never planned on adopting any more children, but when Helen had tearfully pleaded with them two years ago, they couldn’t refuse. As Jack started spending more time with their children, the Winchesters and the Klines grew very close. Kelly really came out of her shell and was much more comfortable with them. She and Jo got on particularly well and became the best of friends. Then one day, four years ago, Kelly’s ex contacted her. He spun some story about how he’d changed and wanted to meet up to discuss child support and possible visits with Jack. She agreed to meet him at his hotel. Kelly was found dead by the maid the next morning. Her ex was found the next week on the other side of the state and arrested for her murder.
“So I see,” he replied stiffly. Castiel switched his focus to the yard and its occupants.
“She a 67?” she asked as she swept an errant strand of dark hair out of her face.
Dean’s head whipped up in shock. “Are you serious?”
“This is only two milligrams. Very mild. You could probably give it to a chihuahua with no issue. It’s only to take during an attack; it calms the brain down and should stop the spinning.”
Patience tried to relay the message but kept forgetting everything she was supposed to say. Castiel gently reminded her when needed and he could tell from the little boy’s body language that he was listening to every word.
World of Warcraft was fucking amazing. There was so much to do. He quickly leveled up by going on quests and killing monsters. Before he knew it, it was well after midnight and he had zero desire to stop playing. Just one more quest he told himself… Two hours later, he stumbled to bed exhausted.
“Well… I mean you guys have so much in common with your bees and everything and he stares at you all the time and makes you laugh…” Dean swallowed before continuing. “He’d be a lucky guy to get a catch like you, Cas.”
Dean shot the phone an indignant glare. “How dare you? That place is awesome. You got your movies and your snacks all in one spot.”
Impala67: my favorite server is pvp actually. well, rp pvp
this game. It was
The test was loud and made his already sore head hurt even more despite the provided earplugs. Tara brought him back to his room where Dean sat playing on his phone. “Ok, Mr. Winchester, your doctor will be back after she gets the results from our neurologist. It’s late, so it may take a while for the doctor on call to get to them.”
Both men turned at the sound of Sam’s voice. The taller Winchester had agreed to pick them up since the airport was an hour from Lawrence and the lot fees to park their van for almost two months were insane.
“Patience is painting and I just put Alicia down for a nap. Speaking of, Max should be taking one too.” She reached for him, but Max clung tightly to Castiel.
Their chats soon branched out. They ranged from the philosophical to the mundane. Dean quickly figured out that anything bee-related was sure to brighten Castiel’s day and he spent more time than he cared to admit scouring the internet for bee puns.
Cas. He knew her better than anyone else in his life besides Sam. They’d been talking almost daily for nearly half a year. Their conversations tended to get pretty personal. Everything would be fine. People met all the time on World of Warcraft and became friends. He’s even seen a few stories of people get married after meeting in game. Maybe he could even see if his crush might be reciprocated after she got over Balthadouche. Yes; this could be great.
The next was an English to Portuguese dictionary, then a book titled ‘What to Expect When You’re Adopting’, ‘Be Prepared : A Practical Handbook for New Dads’, ‘The New Father’, ‘My Two Dads and Me’, ‘Daddy, Papa, and Me’, and finally ‘And Tango Makes Three’. With each book he pulled out, Dean’s frown deepened. Before pulling out the last thing, he looked up. “Cas, babe, we talked about this. We agreed not to do any shopping until we got approved. I don’t want to get our hopes up if…” he trailed off with a vague hand gesture.
Impala67: tried both, but i like alliance
Castiel was still getting dizzy on a regular basis. He kept taking the medication from Dr. Barnes and there was no change so he was starting to think she was right about the Meniere’s disease diagnosis. It was finally time for his appointment with the neurotologist at the beginning of February and Castiel entered the ENT’s office again, this time with Dean at his side.
“You were right earlier Dean; small world.”
He grimaced when he noticed his brother’s car in the lot. He had hoped Gabriel would listen to him for once in his life and just let their cousin Alfie drop the pie off with Ellen. However, Gabriel was like a dog with a bone. He hadn’t believed Castiel’s story about just wanting to spoil Dean with a nice dinner and desert and Castiel knew his brother was waiting in there to ambush him. Groaning in frustration, he made his way inside.
He drank what he could and then dropped back on the bed. His body shivered as he tried to burrow under the blankets. The tremors hurt his already aching muscles and he let out a few involuntary whimpers. He fell into another fitful sleep.
“And last night, they didn’t find signs of anything serious right?”
“Might help. I mean, you can still talk to me but… maybe talking to people who have already gone through this?”
So far, all of Novak’s ‘pranks’ had been pretty tame, but this was going too far. This meant war.
“There’s more than one?”
“A homophobic bitch?”
did he miss that?!
“Well, the other kids left after that and so did Hannah. Jo had to bring Anna home since Hannah ditched her. Garth, Jesse, and Cesar left too. Benny and Andrea stuck around to clean the grill and get the food put away. Gabriel came back after they left and Alfie was still here since they came together. I think Meg told him what happened and Gabe kinda lost it. He tried to punch Alfie and Sam pulled him back. Then he used some colorful language and fired him.”
So that was how he found himself sitting in his primary doctor’s office. He’d stopped by a few days earlier for bloodwork and was here now for the results and an exam. His doctor, Tessa Reap, knocked on the door before entering. “Hello, Castiel. Haven’t seen you in a while. Why don’t you tell me what’s going on?”
Meniere’s disease. There was finally a name for what he had. He wasn’t crazy. He was so flooded with relief he nearly forgot the most important question. “Is there a cure?”
“Yea ok, Dean.” He pushed past the other man and stalked into the bedroom to change.
Castiel laughed. “Oh, she goes to visit her brother every year for a month or two. She came back a few days ago which is why I moved the prank to your car,” he finished sheepishly. “I am sorry about your car and the fine. I’m normally a very nice neighbor.”
“I’ll just call him when I get back to my office.”
Claire looked a little taken aback at that. She chewed her lip and looked down at her shoes. “Well… I’m not impressed easily.” She raised her eyes to meet Dean’s and took a step closer. She poked his arm with a small, yet somehow intimidating, finger. “He’s still my dad and you gotta prove you’re good enough.”
Then it was Mr. Rocha’s turn to speak. With Maria’s help, he explained that he believed Max’s silence was a result of trauma. According to his older sister and family acquaintances, Max was normally an animated and talkative child. But ever since he had arrived at the group home, he hadn’t said a word. Max had been the one to find his mother’s body and it seems he had spent quite some time trying to wake her before the neighbors investigated his cries. The girls had spent the night with a friend for a birthday party and the coroner estimated their mother had been dead nearly fourteen hours before the woman next door found the little boy clinging to his mother’s corpse.
Now he was thoroughly confused. “What?”
“They’re at home with Gabe and Ellen.”
Text conversations turned into phone conversations and they’d spend hours breaking down each new film. That is, until the day came that Castiel ran out of movies to watch. He called Dean in a funk and it took nearly ten minutes before he admitted what the problem was. He assumed Dean would no longer want to talk now that they’d run out of movies to discuss and it took another ten minutes to convince him that that wasn’t the case. He finally shut Cas up by inviting him over to watch another DVD, which instantly broke the other man out of his foul mood.
“Your celebration party!”
“Yes. He’s been wonderful. He coordinates with my other doctors to help figure out the best treatment plan.” Katie smiled softly and turned to pet Falcon.
“He needs to pull that stick out of his arse. Just ignore him Cassie.”
At last managing to form words, Castiel whispered, “Thank you Bal.”
Medical gaslighting is a common occurrence. It happens when health-care professionals downplay or blow off symptoms you know you're feeling, refuse to order appropriate tests, or try to convince you that your issues are caused by something else.
“So, what now?”
Reading over the files, Castiel was a bit confused. The way the e-mail was worded, he had been under the impression that they had been matched with a few different children and they had to choose. Instead, what came up on the screen was a photo of a group of three siblings. While they had indicated on the application that they would be open to groups of siblings, they had not actually expected to matched with one. They were also a bit younger than Castiel had expected. The oldest girl, Patience, was only five. Then there was a set of twins, Max and Alicia, who would be turning three next month. They were beautiful. All three had light brown skin and dark hair. Patience and Alicia had chocolate brown eyes while Max’s appeared to be hazel. Castiel wanted nothing more than to board the first plane to go get them. He glanced over at Dean who was staring at the photos with watery eyes. His husband looked up at him and smiled. Castiel raised his brows in silent inquiry and Dean nodded in agreement. That was that. Both sets of eyes returned to the screen to read about their children.
“He did brave Claire’s for you after all.”
His fiancée cautiously lifted the lid before freezing in shock. There sat the puppy wearing a big pink bow in what looked like the same glittery material as the covering on the box. Castiel brought up both hands to cover his mouth as he let out a small sob. He dropped to his knees and scooped the puppy out to cradle her to his chest. Dean dropped down next to him as Castiel cried and nuzzled the confused looking pup. He turned to lean into Dean’s chest and peppered kisses on his neck. “Thank you, Dean. Thank you, thank you” he whispered. He leaned back and looked at Dean, his eyes sparkling with tears. “How did you know?” he signed.
“Couch. I think I just need to rest a minute.”
“Why would you do that for me Dee?”
“Sure is! Good eye.” Cute and knew cars? Jackpot.
Dean furrowed his brow and looked around in mild shock like he hadn’t even realized he’d come inside. He shuffled his feet uncertainly before steeling himself and crossing his arms. “Is your little prank worth a theft charge? Baby is vintage and those valve covers were original.”
WaywardAngel: I brok up with Balthazarrr
“I left them in the garage next to the black ones.”
Patience nodded and the three children followed them down the short hall with Dean bringing up the rear. Castiel opened the first door. “This room is for Alicia and Max.” Alicia peered in and screeched when she caught sight of the toys in the corner. The little girl dragged Max to the corner and started pulling everything out of the small bin.
“Can I sleep next to you?” Cas’s looked at him with pleading eyes and his bottom lip trembled.
“She may try. I don’t think it would do her much good though. It would probably just end up making her look bad after what she tried to do to me.”
Castiel’s eyes flicked up to meet Dean’s before dropping back to their hands. “I know.” He took a deep breath and lifted his head back up to glare out the window at nothing in particular. “I know I’m not going to die, but finding out I’m never going to get better is almost as bad.” He clenched his free hand and concentrated on the sting of his nails against his palm to ground himself.
Dean feels his eyes sting. He’s not going to cry. He can’t make Cas feel guilty like that when it’s Dean’s fault that their friendship is falling apart. He rubs a hand down his face and blinks quickly before dropping his gaze to the floor. “Oh.”
Panic shoots through him. Cas doesn’t want to be friends anymore. “Please, Cas. Please just try to forget you saw any of that. You’re my best friend. You’re one of the most important people in my life. Please can we stay friends? I won’t do anything to make you uncomfortable. And if I do, just tell me and I’ll stop. Just don’t--”
“I know babe,” Dean said softly. “That’s why it’s important you listen to your doctor. He said—”
Dean glared; his earlier ire restored. “Well I’d like to say I’d never been either, but you fixed that for me didn’t you?”
The day dragged on and by lunch, he was invited to sit with Lilith and Gordon’s friends at their table. They gave Dean the typical intro interrogation while telling him about their little sea-side community near Corpus Christi. He told them his dad was a FBI agent this time and was in town on a case. They tried to get more details, but Dean pretended he wasn’t allowed to know anyway. Lilith clung to his arm with newfound interest and threw in some eye batting for good measure.
“Nothin’ really, just… there were aliens man. It got weird. Ford was still great though. Look, here’s the other two.” He plucked Temple of Doom and Last Crusade from the shelf and handed them over.
He looked once more at Castiel and smiled before closing the door. Definitely not letting him go again.
Castiel barely suppressed a shiver. “Behave, or no dessert for you.”
Meg sat at the front desk with her signature smirk. “So, you ready to meet her?”
“Cas—” Dean started.
WaywardAngel: wish u wer heer with mee dee
“I’m glad I was able to get you some answers. Call my office any time if you have questions and we’ll see you back next month, ok?”
“Don’t know. Got dizzy.”
He was given a clean bill of health at his follow-up appointment and the whole family quickly put the horrible health scare behind them.
Castiel laughed before he tried and failed to give Dean a stern expression. “You’re going to have to watch your mouth around them you know?”
Their son’s momentary braveness fled and he shrank back into Castiel’s leg. “Sorry. He doesn’t talk.”
But… he was here alone. A quick glance at the clock showed Cas wouldn’t get here for at least another hour. He checked the tag. They were his size, but they probably wouldn’t fit anyway. Women’s and men’s sizes were totally different. Besides, he’d never get his dick to fit in this little thing. No. Forget it.
Dean opened and closed his mouth a few times before he quietly spoke. “I’m not lying. We’re not together.”
The children were starting to notice something was wrong and Castiel was nearly caught at work with his head on his desk during a spell. He’d worked out a system with Balthazar; he’d text him when an episode started so his friend could play interference. He had come to Castiel’s rescue again to distract Mr. Adler just as his boss was about to walk in without knocking. It was getting ridiculous.
Dean was breathing a little heavier now and his pupils were starting to dilate. “Hell yea babe.”
Becky smiled in understanding. “Of course, Mr. Winchester. Nobody really
Soon the party died down. There were quiet conversations and Garth sat in the corner playing gentle Christmas carols on the piano. Castiel snuggled up to Dean on the couch and dozed while his husband chatted with Benny. Their family started saying their goodbyes and the guests trickled out slowly. Max came to curl up in Dean’s lap and Ellen came in a few minutes later to show them the picture she’d taken of Alicia. The little girl was curled up in a pile of stuffed animals, fast asleep. They figured that was their cue and the tired men loaded their kids in the car and went home.
Kelly’s parents, Helen and Jack, were awarded full custody of her son. Then a year later, the stress of the trial caused Jack to suffer a stroke. After another year of struggling to care for her grandson and her husband, Helen asked if the Winchesters would take him. The poor woman was terrified of something happening to her and having his father’s family getting custody of Jack. At least this way, she could still see Jack as often as she wanted.
The e-mail opened and Castiel actually had to put the phone down so he could read it because his hands were shaking so much.
“Oh yes, you just adopted. This whole thing is probably just stress-related then.” She waved him off and started gathering her notes back into his chart.
“Taking a vacation just before tax season? Zachariah won’t be very happy about that.”
Eileen and Sam shared a look. “Seriously?”
She snorted. “Whatever. So, how long have you dated green-eyes here?”
“A bit. Let’s sit for a minute, ok?” Castiel led Dean to a bench. He landed heavily and sipped his soda. “No more roller coasters for me.”
“It could be so much worse—”
your accent.”
“Uh, your mom isn’t too helpful when it comes to your dad wanting to do stuff for you.”
After a quick check and instructions on concussion aftercare, Dr. Barnes gave them her information with a reminder to follow up. Dr. Kali gave him his discharge papers while Dean called Gabriel to pick them up.
“Just wait until tomorrow.”
They walked into the kitchen holding hands and hardly let go for the rest of the night.
“Talk to me please. We’ve known each other a long time Dean, and I thought we were friends…” his voice trailed off.
“Fuck off.”
. Then there was the fact that his avatar was female… But a lot of other players did that too… Plus his taste in music was something he’d assume would appeal to more woman than men. Individually they did mean much but all put together, he could see why he came to the conclusion he did.
Sam and Gabriel came out from behind a tree. Gabriel held a video camera in his hands.
“Really?”
Castiel deflated a little. “Ok.”
Hot rage flashed through Dean. “Oh, I’m sure they did. The NFL isn’t a big fan of the Saints or our city. You know they even tried to sue a little t-shirt shop a few years ago for putting ‘who dat’ on a shirt?”
Cas turns to face him more fully. He licks those beautiful lips nervously. “Pretty much all of it.”
Castiel shifted uncomfortably. He didn’t want to explain to this man that he had trouble making connections with people. It was one of his biggest insecurities. “I have my neighbor, Missouri. She’s watched Claire for me before.”
Dean drove as fast as possible to get to Cas. It helped that there was absolutely no traffic at this hour. He couldn’t believe he was doing this. It was the middle of the night and he was driving across the state to comfort a drunk girl he’d never met. He could be walking into anything. Except every reasonable argument he could come up with was immediately shot down. He
“You forgot something as important as that in your eighty-five checklists?” Dean looked at him in mock horror. “I’m shocked.”
“An egg?! I don’t think George has ever had egg before.” He looked down worriedly at the tortoise. He wasn’t sure if he could eat it.
Cas closed the distance between them and put his hands on Dean’s hips. His fingers stoked the smooth fabric as he spoke. “I really do. You said you bought another pair?” He ran his nose along Dean’s jaw as he whispered an affirmation. Castiel hummed and he felt goosebumps erupt on his skin. “Good. I have a feeling we’re about to ruin this one.”
Cas hiccupped and took a shuddering breath before he pulled back a bit. He grabbed Dean’s hand and stumbled into the house. Looking around, Dean noticed a living room near the entryway and steered Cas towards the couch. Once he deposited him there, he went in search of the kitchen. He searched the cabinets until he found some aspirin and poured his friend a big glass of water.
“I’m sorry Dean. It’s just nice to know she cares.”
“Look at the rest.” Castiel went over to sit next to him.
“Yes, actually. That’s good to know then.”
: I watched Star Wars.
“What am I gonna do, Bal?”
“I know. I’m just afraid that by the time she does, she’ll be all grown up. I don’t want to miss her whole childhood.” He slumped against Dean, who wrapped an arm around him. “Maybe I should just tell her the truth.”
Castiel tried to wrap his mind around what he was hearing. “So, secondary hydrops symptoms are a result of outside forces causing damage and Meniere’s causes damage which then leads to the symptoms?”
“Well, I still think you’re manly and sexy as hell.”
“Ya know, your behavior isn’t helping much.”
Dean sighed again. Sometimes Castiel needed things spelled out plainly. “Cas, look at me.” Castiel turned but would not meet his eyes. Dean lifted his chin with a finger and waited until he did. “I. Like. You. I am
“Clarence, where-” Castiel slowly moved his eyes up to the face of his friend. Meg stood in the doorway with a look of horror on her face. Castiel groaned and closed his eyes. The light coming in from behind her was too bright. “Oh my God! What- holy crap. Are you ok?”
WaywardAngel: realy?
Had to.
“Well, I’m hungry. Pizza?”
“I just think we as parents have the right to know what our children are going to be exposed to. They shouldn’t be brainwashed into thinking your behavior is normal.” She looked over at Claire and Ben. “Poor Claire. She must be so confused. This is why gays shouldn’t be allowed to have children.”
“Well then. It seems you’ve found safe ways to channel your anger. Anything else I should worry about?”
Why hadn’t he thought of that? “I wasn’t planning on it.”
Balthazar pulled into his driveway. “Call me if you need anything. Or if you need to…” he struggled to continue, “
Dean paused. Nobody besides Sam had ever actually asked him that. “Why?”
“I was just telling Patience your name.”
“He had some family members stop by, but they were no trouble and Dean made sure everyone left early so the noise didn’t carry into the night.”
“Dean.” Cas cuts him off and stands. “I don’t think I can forget reading this.”
“Seems our little Clarence and his hubby have finally been approved for adoption.”
He hadn’t planned on mowing his grass until tomorrow, but apparently while he’d been at work, Dean had decided to do some yardwork of his own.
“You too. Though we’ve spoken so much over the last month, I feel like I know you already.”
Castiel shrugged. “He doesn’t bother me. Especially not today.” He smiled again and clasped his hands in front of his mouth. “I still can’t believe it. Dean is going to be so excited.”
“It’s nice to meet you. Cas talks about you a lot. I’m glad I have a face to go with the name. Hey, Dr. Adamson, it’s good to see you.”
“Ok.” Castiel pulled Dean into a kiss before his husband went back into the house. “Patience? Wanna help Papa in the front yard?”
: Unless you don’t want to talk to me…
When the timers on the pizzas went off and Dean and Cas went to get them, Sam and his wife had a quick discussion. “I thought they were just friends.” Eileen signed.
He bit lip again as he looked down at himself. “I mean, I guess so. They’re really soft and I feel… kinda sexy. Do you like them?” He glanced up hopefully at his husband.
“I still can’t decide which is worse; the constant flirting or the undoubtedly disgusting amount of PDA that would occur if you two actually got together.”
Cas gave him a small smile. “Me either.”
“Ok, how about you sleep on the couch hmm?”
All too soon, the music trailed off and the dance was over. The Russian walked around giving advice and correction to those who needed it. Jo didn’t need any. Of course she didn’t. His honorary sister was awesome. After a water break, they went through the dance once more. This time, Dean watched the teacher. The man had a presence. He exuded an air of power, but not in a negative way. He was firm, yet kind in his direction. He didn’t have to raise his voice to command respect from his students. His movements were graceful and Dean felt his eyes drawn to the man’s rear as he demonstrated a move that he noticed left several of the female dancers swooning as well.
“My uncle likes to restore cars.” She shrugged her shoulders and smiled at him. “I picked up a few things.” The woman’s attention turned back to car. “She’s in great shape.”
He shouldn’t read any more. He really shouldn’t. It’s such a horrible breach of Dean’s privacy… but… he has to know. He pined over Dean for years (who was he kidding, he never really stopped) before writing off the idea as a fantasy that would never come to pass.
Dean pocketed his phone and keys before heading out the door.
Could he ask Sam? He dismisses that plan just as quickly. No way Sam would have known about this and kept it to himself. He would never betray Dean’s trust, but he wouldn’t let him hide something like this for long either. As much as Dean would hate it, he would have given in eventually if only to make Sam happy (or to shut him up).
“It’s an office.”
“Yes…”
Lunch was leftovers from the party while Castiel and Dean got dinner started. They’d splurged on a honey-baked ham and only had to make sides. Dean baked all the pieces for a giant gingerbread house for dessert. The children loved putting it together even though in the end there was more icing on them than the house.
“Dean, I promise, I didn’t—” Naomi. Castiel should have known. She was way too interested in Dean when they spoke all those months ago. “Oh.”
“Then what’s the problem? Are you alright?” His eyes moved over Dean’s body as if he expected to find something physically wrong.
“Can it, Cassie. Dean-o, call me if you hear anything.”
“You mean after you covered my yard in flour?!” Dean yelled back.
“I know. He’s wanted a puppy since we were kids. Ok, I gotta get back to work. I’ll see you this afternoon. And make sure nobody ruins the surprise!”
“Maybe you should go lie down. You’ve had a long day.”
This guy was adorable. “Of course, dude! Most of them are from out of town, so they’re not going to be staying that late. I doubt if anybody is still here past eight.”
Her eyebrows arched up a bit. “Clarence, are you ok?”
“You’re welcome sweetheart.”
Castiel studied the card. When he saw the clinic logo, anger flared in his gut. “You’re joking. This is the same ENT I saw before.”
“He fired Alfie?” Castiel couldn’t believe it. Gabriel cared deeply for Alfie and had been thrilled when their younger cousin had asked to work with him.
Dean ground out, “That’s because this fucker hasn’t quit messing with me all weekend and I’m about to kick his ass!”
Castiel was brushing his teeth when Dean came in. “Finally got Alicia to sleep. How was your appointment today?”
Castiel blinked. Why was this guy being so rude? “Um, I don’t know. Would that help diagnose anything?”
He found Cas right where he left him. He sat there sniffling and staring off into space. Dean made him take the pills and drink as much water as he could. Cas turned to him with a watery smile. “I’m so glad you’re here Dee. Though I wish it was under better circumstances.” Even though he slurred his words, Cas still tried to use proper grammar. Dean thought that was just how he typed. Apparently, he spoke that way too. It was adorable.
Dean lowered his voice. “You sure? You kinda ran out of there.”
“CAS!” Dean had been trying to interrupt as Castiel became more and more hysterical. He was crying now; big loud sobs. He’d covered his face with his hands and was muttering about how pathetic he was. “Cas. Look at me. Please look.” He gently pried the man’s hands off his face. Tears still fell from his eyes to soak into the pillow and Dean couldn’t take it anymore. He grabbed his friend by the shoulders and pulled him into a hug. Castiel still cried a bit and Dean rocked him until he settled down.
He meets Cas’s eyes and the joy he sees there has him tearing up all over again. “Dean. Sweet, beautiful, incredible Dean. How could you possibly think I would ever leave you?”
Sorry *hides*
Dean smiled to himself. “Yea, he’s great.”
The housewarming party was in full swing. Dean had only moved about an hour and a half away, but that was still a long drive for some people just for a party, so he was glad most of his family could make it. His parents occupied his new patio set along with Bobby and Ellen, Sam and Eileen had teamed up against Charlie and Jo in what was turning into a cut-throat game of Cornhole, Garth and Benny chatted over the grill, and Victor, Jody, and Donna were trading war stories.
“Hey!”
“Does he know yet?” Balthazar asked.
He felt his eyebrows shoot up. “Doesn’t really seem like anyone’s business actually.”
The man’s blue eyes widened in recognition before a delighted smiled appeared on his face. “Dean! It’s so nice to see you. What are you doing here?”
Dean snorted. “No. But I wouldn’t have waited till the end of the day to come get her. You’re right Meg, she’s perfect.”
Sam huffed. “Dean, their food is expensive and the overdue fees are highway robbery. Netflix is so much easier.”
Castiel slowly opened his eyes. Dean was crouched next to him while Meg and Gabriel stood nearby. “Got dizzy. Fell, I think.”
Dean hated that he made Cas doubt himself. Giving him an actual smile, he replied, “Yea Cas. It’s freakin awesome. People are gonna love it.”
“I’m a grown man, Dean. I shouldn’t be cute and adorable,” he grumbled.
“Ok.”
“Not bad” he chuckled.
His next class contained two of the kids from his gym group, Gordon and Lilith. He walked with them and they chatted a bit more. Gordon seemed cool but Lilith was attempting to velcro herself to his side and, while she was hot, there was something about her that put him off. Still, he was a sixteen-year-old boy and the attention was nice, so he decided to enjoy it for now.
“What?! Why?”
WaywardAngel: he id a douhc
Despite the fatigue, Castiel and Dean could not be more thrilled. Getting a hug or earning a smile from one of their kids made up for everything else. The couple felt honored to have been chosen as parents for these precious tiny humans. Seeing the joy and wonder on their little faces was amazing and each new day was better than the last.
Garth was currently in the middle of the children, playing right along with them. Three of them were his and his wife Bess sat in a nearby chair laughing at her husband’s antics. She was heavily pregnant with their fourth and was due in a few weeks.
“I got this Dean,” Katie cut in. “Look at me Castiel.” He lifted his eyes to meet hers. “What makes you think I’m handling things better than you? What makes you think you don’t have the right to be upset about your own health?”
The man gave him a confused head tilt before he seemed to remember the DVD in his hand. “Oh, yes. I was trying to figure out if this was a good choice or not. I’ve heard of this character before.”
A glance at the trash bag showed it getting pretty full, so Dean tied it up and headed to the can along the side of the house. His neighbor was there just on the other side of the low brick wall separating their yards when he rounded the house.
“LARPing group. My friend Charlie is the current queen. Long may she reign!” Dean punctuated that with a hand over his heart and a little bow.
Castiel bit back a snort. What good were answers if he would never get better? He just wanted to get better! He turned to snap at Dean before he caught sight of his husband’s face.
“Thank you.”
His hand squeezed involuntarily against Dean’s and he gave the other man a deliberate once-over. “’People’ huh? Interesting.”
“Why?” she snapped.
Gabriel bounced out of the room, pulling a sucker out of his pocket as he did so. The second the door closed, Castiel slumped back. “I love my brother, but sometimes he’s exhausting.”
Castiel was in shock. “You separated the twins? And does anyone else in this home know French?”
“I’m good.” He lied. From the way Cas squinted at him, he didn’t buy it.
“Well--”
Claire closed her mouth, looking a bit chastised. “Yea well…”
Dean wasn’t sure he liked how vague she was being. They entered the puppy room and there with the staff vet Amelia, sat one of the cutest puppies Dean had ever seen. She had white fur on her chest that faded to grey on her back. She also had black and light brown patches down her back and legs and also formed a sort of mask around her face. And good Lord was she fluffy! He just wanted to scoop her up and run his fingers through her fur. As he got closer, she turned her face towards him and he noticed her piercing blue eyes. They were so bright, they almost glowed. He could see why anyone would be drawn to her.
Ellen left soon after he got Max settled to get to the Roadhouse. Castiel found Patience at her art station. He watched her paint for a while and gave her advice on mixing colors. By the time her new creation was set out to dry, the twins had woken up.
The little boy was obviously longing for his sisters but made no indication he would move closer. Dean had looked over to Max almost as soon as Castiel had. Their eyes met and the near-decade of being together aided them in their silent conversation. Castiel released Alicia and addressed the two girls in French. “Your brother looks lonely. Let’s go sit with him.” Castiel repeated what he said in English for Dean’s benefit and to help the children get used to the language.
: Seriously?
It was a great party, but they were more than ready to bring their kids home.
Castiel looked at the other man. “What do you mean?”
Thrown off by that comment, Dean forgot to be angry for a moment. “What do you mean?”
Dean made a noise of distress before pulling him into a hug. Castiel felt hands rubbing over his back and let out a sob. “I know you don’t, baby. I know.”
“That would be most welcome Dean, thank you.”
WaywardAngel: How would I not take offense to that? Big talk from someone who I can tell plays a lot of HS.
It’s ok. It’s ok. It’s not a big deal. You’re all alone here. Nobody has to know. Quit being such a bitch, Winchester. You’re a strong, sexy man. A little pair of panties isn’t gonna change that.
“I’ve been so upset. I thought she went to a rescue. I know we’ve talked about a dog, but I thought we were waiting until after the wedding.”
“Well, it’s worth it for Ben.” Dean stared lovingly at his son.
“Your body doesn’t like all that alcohol dude. You’re probably gonna throw up.”
“No way man! I live on Oliver!” His crush lived so close by? This was awesome!
“What’s this? Did Cassie finally agree to that threesome?” Balthazar’s accented voice called from the doorway. He had a mischievous smirk on his face as he walked towards the coffee pot. “Good for you! I once had a… what’s French for twelve?”
The picture on the front was of an attractive (and nude) young man actually covered in milk.
Mardi Gras happened several weeks later. Of course, half of the themes were related to the no-call. Floats were decorated in different football themes, riders were dressed as refs, and yellow penalty flags became a coveted item thrown to the crowds. Dean and Cas went to every parade. They both dressed in team colors and when Cas caught a flag for Dean, he received a passionate kiss in return.
For the next month, the spells kept happening. His cardiologist was more attentive than his neurologist had been. She examined his heart, did stress testing, a tilt table test, and had him wear a heart rate and blood pressure monitor for twenty-four hours. She declared him free of any heart issues. Based on his symptoms, she suggested he find another neurologist for more extensive testing and an ENT. He followed her advice, but it was another two month wait for the new neurologist and several more weeks for the ENT. For now, he just had to live with it.
His husband came into view. “Yea?” Dean’s eyes widened as he caught sight of him. What must he have looked like, that Dean reacted that way? “Geez Cas, you ok?”
Castiel nodded with his face still buried in his husband’s shirt. “Ok.”
Castiel leaned against the doorframe and casually crossed his arms. “Hello, Dean. May I help you?”
“Made a mistake on some forms. Could have cost millions. Been sick a lot too.”
“Sorry, Gabe. I didn’t mean to.”
The whole family was getting better at sign language. Castiel, Dean, Sam, and Jo had enrolled in a once-a-week class at the local deaf center and would then go home and teach the children what they’d learned. Their instructor, Eileen, understood the situation and was very helpful. Sam was quite enamored with the young woman right from the start but tried to play it off, insisting that it was pointless if she would struggle to understand his attempts at conversation.
“Dean are you in…” his voice trailed off as he noticed Dean.
Castiel grabbed Dean’s hand. “I understand now Dean. It’s ok. We all have things we cling to. Mine is my photography. Yours is football.”
That probably wasn’t the right thing to do.
Dean stood up and crouched down next to the doctor in front of Castiel. “Now, you see… he still has a slight tick…”
Dean deflated somewhat. “Yea, ok.”
“Don’t assume everything Cas. Look how that worked out for me.” He shot Cas a wink.
Specifically, Cas is looking at Dean’s dia- journal.
Castiel’s expression turned predatory. “To start. I am thinking those curved legs of yours would look good wrapped around my waist, yes?”
Dr. Adamson smiled warmly. “My pleasure Castiel. My wife, Colette has Meniere’s. I know how frustrating it can be to find answers. You’re not alone in this. Here…” he pulled out a flyer and handed it over. “This is a support group my wife helped start. They have a Facebook page and meet up sometimes. Check it out if you feel up to it.”
“That’s very comforting, but no. We really need to focus on getting ready to go on this trip.”
Castiel clenched his teeth as rage flushed though him. He had no idea Amelia had been telling their daughter things like that. He took a deep breath and glanced over at Dean whose eyebrows had shot up in shock. Looking back at Claire, he spoke calmly. “Your mother hasn’t been truthful. I’m not gay.” He stopped as he thought of how to explain this. The truth was always best but he still didn’t want to discuss his orientation with his baby girl. He shrugged and let out a sigh before continuing. “I’m bi. I like men and women. And yes, I am dating Dean.”
Christmas day was a lazy affair. Dean made everyone hot chocolate while the kids tore into their presents. After a quick discussion late last night, Castiel and Dean agreed to get Max his turtle. They wrote him a note from Santa saying that the turtle couldn’t fit safely with the rest of the presents and he could pick it up in a few days. Max smiled widely and jumped up and down in excitement. Castiel asked what kind of turtle he wanted and he kept signing “zoo”. They were confused until Max grabbed their Brazil album. He flipped to the back and pointed at the redfooted tortoises they’d had there. Castiel said they’d tell Santa while Dean quickly looked them up to see if they could even be kept as pets.
Castiel noticed Max next to the tortoise table, which had been dubbed “Tort Mahal”, when he got inside. The little boy spent a large portion of his time staring at his new pet which had been named George. “Hey, Max.”
He whips his head up and Cas is right there. He’s close enough to touch and staring at Dean intently. He looks nervous as hell, but determined. Dean notices movement and looks down in time to see Cas’s hand reach slowly towards his own. Dean takes a shuddering breath and lets his fists unclench. Their fingers tangle together and Cas feels so warm, so perfect. He feels like he’s always belonged there. Cas’s thumb grazes the back of his hand and he gives the rest of Dean’s fingers a gentle squeeze.
from the spigot. He glared as he looked around before he saw that same dark-haired guy from earlier. He had a small smile on his face as he washed his own car. He turned to give Dean a wink and a little wave before turning away again. Son of a bitch! Oh, it was on now.
Meg barked out a laugh which she tried to turn into a cough as Raphael glared between the two of them. “I don’t remember you being a part of this conversation Balthazar.”
“Probably. I think I should lie down. I feel nauseated too.”
. Everyone’s eyes were glued to the TVs watching the game play out. The atmosphere was electric; fans young and old thrumming with excitement. Just one more win and we’d be back in the Superbowl. The game was tied, but Brees always worked best under pressure. So close. Just over ten yards to go and if The Saints got one more down, they could easily run out the clock to beat the Rams. Piece of cake.
“Want some of your honey in there?”
“No. Please don’t leave. Tell me what happened.”
“Sure.”
“I see. Well, do you like them?”
Pamela furrowed her brows before understanding lit her eyes. “Was he older? Grey hair? Walked with a limp?”
She asked a few more questions while checking out his motor functions and reflexes. “Ok Castiel, I’m not seeing anything obvious here. I’d like to send you to a neurologist and possibly a cardiologist. It could be migraines, a blood pressure issue, any number of things. There are a few disorders that mimic each other and it’s best to have a specialist clear you. Come back after you’ve seen them, or sooner if you feel worse. In the meantime, I’d like you to take something for anxiety. Stress can manifest in lots of different ways.” She scribbled something on her notepad and handed it to him.
The two men watched as long as they could before Jaqueline ushered them into the hallway. “Is Max ok?” Dean asked.
“What things?” Dean looked at him over his shoulder with a cheeky grin. “Sexy things?”
Dean caught up with him as he spoke with the scheduling nurse about his therapy and other follow-up appointments. “You ok?”
“Yea I know. She talks about dad a lot.”
“STOP IT! Stop trying to fix it. Stop trying to remind me of how much worse it could be. I know all of that!”
“Yes. Like the cloud.”
“Take them at night.”
way but Dean couldn’t help the small flare of jealousy that happened whenever Cain’s name came up.
“Oh no! I know what kinds of parties you throw Bal. I’d like my home to still be standing so our child has a place to live.”
“Yea.”
“Well… Littering! You left several hundred forks in my yard.”
He huffed and swore a few more times to calm down before starting a new match. His opponent had a design on his cards he’d never seen before. They played a close match which the other guy won. This was just not Dean’s day. He sent the guy a friend request and then opened a chat.
“Partially. I really do have insomnia though. I can’t seem to shut my brain off at night. Hey, while you’re here, could you give me a hand?” Dean followed him back to his truck and Cas reached in to pull the biggest box to the edge. “We have to be very careful with this one.” Dean nodded his understanding.
Everything unpacked, the couple got dressed and ventured out to explore the neighborhood. There was a small bar and grill nearby where they enjoyed a few drinks and an early dinner. They then stopped at the market to stock their kitchen before heading back. Once the groceries were put away, the two men got ready for bed and snuggled up in their room to watch Netflix on their laptop before falling asleep.
“Yes. I’m fine.” He sat clenching and unclenching his fists and started to count his breaths.
“Yes. I filled these out for one of our accounts last week.”
Castiel threw his head back and laughed. He looked beautiful. His eyes lit up and he got the most adorable little crinkles on the sides. Dean couldn’t help but chuckle with him until he remembered the loss his team just suffered and sobered up. He clenched his jaw and stared at the opposite wall.
“Yea. He was trying to pick out some Barbies.”
“Yes. So Dean, I saw you watching the dance. Do you like the ballet?”
Michael and his girlfriend, Lucifer and his wife, Hannah and her husband, and Anna and her girlfriend sat in a large circle around the firepit talking with Katie and Balthazar. Hannah had apologized for her behavior when Castiel first got sick and they made up years ago. Seeing his cousins made him think of Alfie. Their relationship had never truly recovered and Alfie had never actually apologized. He moved to New York after he finished his arts degree and they rarely heard from him.
Castiel scoffs at the idea immediately. Dean talking about feelings? The pandemic will end before that happens.
And maybe those few sentences were just a huge misunderstanding and Dean really meant something else. He really should make sure before making this into a big deal.
Castiel sniffled and sat up. Dean wiped his cheeks and kissed him softly. “Ok. Thank you, Dean.”
After four months of sleepovers, Sam and Eileen finally showed up one night to meet Dean’s new friend. They were surprised when Castiel opened the door barefoot in a t-shirt and sweats looking every bit like he lived there. It didn’t even look like he’d tried to control his hair. “Hello. You must be Sam and Eileen. I’m Castiel. Please, come in.”
“Yea, really. Look, I know you just broke up with what’s his name and you need some time and I won’t push. And if you just wanna be friends that’s fine. But, uh… if maybe some day you wanna try… I’d- I’d really like to try Cas.”
He bought her cotton candy and a funnel cake bigger than her head. He tried tell her no to the candy apples, but a tiny pout and the promise to eat an extra portion of salad with dinner had him quickly caving. Dean internally scowled at her behavior more than once but tried to remember than she was just a kid stuck in the middle of two fighting parents and was only doing what kids do. Even so, he hated to see the man he was growing to really care for perk up at the slightest smile from his daughter.
Holy. Crap.
Patience followed her sister. She regarded Castiel and Dean curiously before joining the conversation. She helped interpret when even Maria didn’t understand the toddler-speak. She seemed to be trying to speak Portuguese but would get frustrated and quickly slip back to French. Her hair hung loose about her shoulders and she wore a light green shirt, jean shorts, and blue sneakers.
“HE SAID THIS IS PERMANENT!” he exploded. “The damage is
Instead of a postcard, Castiel received a DVD. In was in a protective sleeve that read:
“I know Cas, but I think you have the right to under the circumstances. She said some people go into remission and she admitted that she wasn’t sure since this is not her area. Let’s see what this new doc says. One step at a time, right?”
Eileen rolled her eyes. “Dean, why didn’t you tell us you guys were dating?”
“I just don’t want to stoop to her level.”
: Dude, I wouldn’t have asked for your number if I didn’t want to.
“Yea?”
“Dean…” Cas looks like he wants to say more, but aside from opening and closing his mouth a few times, nothing else comes out.
He browsed the website searching for the customer service information. The sooner he returned these, the sooner he’d get the
“How-” Cas paused to swallow again. Yea, he was gonna blow any second. “How did I drink too much? I’ve h- uh… had more than this plenty of times before.”
His gift…? “What? You knew I ordered these?”
Castiel didn’t remember moving until he registered the faces of his family and friends in the living room. He tried to focus as he searched through the small crowd for his children. Sam held Max while Ellen had Alicia. Patience stood near Jo. “Papa!”
“Oh come on. Don’t be like that. I think they’re cute. I never would have thought of doin something like that.”
Not too long after that, Gabriel walked in, followed closely by Meg. She slipped her arm through his and Gabriel looked like he would burst with happiness. Castiel caught Meg’s eye and she froze before raising her chin defiantly and leaning further into his brother. Castiel grinned and gave her a nod of approval before going back into the kitchen for more food.
“It’s complicated…”
“I’m sure we will. It was lovely meeting you as well. I’ll see you next time.” She pulled him into a brief hug before Cain helped her stand. “Goodnight Colette, D-- Cain.”
Cas nods slowly. “I realize that. I’m- I’m sorry for violating your trust. I just wanted to check something and the document was just… there.” He dips his head and starts picking at his fingernails.
“Well, son. I don’t know how much I can help you. There are only a few things that I can treat that cause those symptoms. But I don’t suspect any of them. The spells aren’t caused by position changes, so you don’t have BPPV. You’re not vomiting during spells and there’s no hearing loss so that leaves out Meniere’s disease. An MRI would have shown a defect in your ears.”
While eating breakfast on the ninth day after the children came to live with them, Patience shyly asked how to say “dad” in English. Dean looked like he was ready to cry and Castiel had to refrain from bouncing in his seat. After testing out a few names they settled on “Daddy” for Dean, since it sounded like “Dad Dean”, and “Papa” for Castiel since that was the French version of daddy. Every time Patience or Alicia called them by their new titles, Castiel’s heart gave a little squeeze.
“Hey Meg, what’s up? Cas ok?”
Dean sighed in relief. “Ok then. I’m gonna go change before we eat.”
Castiel spent extra time taking his husband apart that night and later they would agree it was one of the best Christmases they’d ever had.
That bastard.
How the heck was he supposed to walk home holding this thing?!
a bit flashier. It was a beautiful deep red color and came with leather-appointed seats, dual Blu-ray DVD players, a nav system, and doors that could be opened with the key fob. While Castiel would miss his old car, he couldn’t deny that he was a little excited by all the features.
“Very well. And yourself?” Castiel tried to say as little as possible to Naomi whenever he could help it.
Dean rubbed Castiel’s back and made gentle shushing noises. “I know babe. You have nothing to be sorry for. And I’m going to be with you every step of the way. If you want me to start coming to appointments with you, I will. Anything you need, Cas, ok?”
Castiel arched a brow again. “Is that so? Why not? Do you think is just for women? What about me, Dean? Am I less of man because I dance?”
“Please don’t do that for me.”
He knew Dean was always nearby; sometimes talking to him, sometimes to other people. Where were his kids? Where was he? He didn’t recognize this room.
They all laughed. Sam and Gabriel waved their goodbyes and left. Dean grabbed the box and Cas carried the puppy as they made their way to the car. “What should we call her?” Dean asked.
“Me too.”
“But it’s different. The truth is that Amelia cheated on you. That’s not the same as what she did Cas.”
“And then when Ben started in school, she tried to convince them I was some kind of pervert and I should be barred from campus.”
… he would never know if he didn’t try. He chewed his lip as he stared at the lace. Panties and briefs were pretty much the same thing, right? This pair may fit a bit tight, and he could just pretend that the lace wasn’t there. Maybe he wouldn’t even like the feeling of the satin once he got it on. Better to at least find out before he went through the whole return process only to be disappointed when the right thing came in. Yea, that would be the smart thing to do.
Dean sighed before stepping into the school. He hated this part. Filling out forms, finding his classes, trying to figure out if he was behind in the curriculum. Not to mention all the questions. He knew most people were just curious, but having to tell his whole life story to a new group of fellow teens every few weeks was exhausting. He used to tell an abridged version of the truth but he couldn’t stand the sympathetic looks anymore. Lying was easier.
“She’s a mini Australian Shephard. And you may as well quit tryin Sam, she’s deaf.”
Castiel gripped him back just as tight; his hands rubbing soothingly along Dean’s back. “I’m so sorry I scared you sweetheart. Do they know how that happened?”
“I don’t know. I suppose I could go stay with Gabriel for a while. I don’t know if want to stay here or not.”
“Maybe you’re dehydrated. You never drink enough water.”
“No, I leave that for you.”
Alicia was a bit more rough and tumble than her sister. While she liked dresses and skirts, she once told Dean it was only because they made going to the bathroom easier and had no problem getting her clothes filthy right alongside Max. She preferred to play with the boys whenever they went to the park and loved kicking around a soccer ball or climbing trees. She also enjoyed the baby dolls and tea set she had in her room and had a particular fondness for any play jewelry she would find whenever the family visited a store or gift shop. Her and Max’s relationship had only grown stronger and she rarely left her brother’s side.
“Plus, you’re hot as hell. I think I can deal with a little football issue now and then.”
After they snuck past security while Meg provided a distraction, they hit up one of their favorite bars and had a few too many margaritas. None of them were in any condition to drive and were discussing calling a cab when Gabriel pulled up. The two men looked at Meg who shrugged innocently before getting in the front seat and scooting a little too close to Castiel’s brother. Gabriel was pleasantly surprised and was too distracted by Meg’s low cut top to bother asking why they were smashed at three o’clock on a Tuesday.
“Same. I must admit, I wasn’t a big football fan before I moved here, but I’m finding the city’s love for the team quite contagious.”
Castiel rolled his eyes before turning to their brothers. “Thank you for taking care of her.”
: I still don’t understand why you insisted I start with episode 4
After playing some games and winning some prizes, they moved on to the rides section of the park. All three went on the gentler rides, but when it came to the fast stuff, Claire went alone. Castiel got horrible motion sickness and Dean opted to stay behind with him. Together, they watched Claire have fun and chat with other kids. Dean made a point of wrapping his arm around the other man or holding his hand as often as he could. That always earned him a shy smile from Castiel and a thoughtful look from Claire.
it proclaimed along with an arrow pointing towards his house.
Come to think of it, He’d seen Dean twice in passing in the last few days and the man had ignored him the first time and given him a dirty look the next. Castiel had assumed he was just in a bad mood, but…
Castiel’s shoulders sagged. “I know, Bal.”
“Yea. I picked her up on Wednesday. She’s been staying with mom.”
“Can you do somethin for me?” She nodded. “Just, pay attention to what your dad does alright? Not just what your mom
She scowled at him as they reached the front of the line. “You’re on.”
They stayed in the break room for another twenty minutes coming up with ideas. Balthazar kept going to the extreme with everything from a strip-o-gram to a skywriter while Meg kept calling out ideas she found on her phone for pregnancy announcements (“It’s basically the same thing, Clarence.”). In the end, Castiel came up with a simple plan that the other two begrudgingly admitted was perfect.
Gabriel looked up and gave him a pitying look. “I know, Cas. I was just teasing.”
“You want some coffee? Started bringing my coffee pot with me. Customers love a free cup.”
Castiel let go. He cried and cursed the universe for his shitty luck. He cursed encephalitis-causing mosquitoes and his broken ears and every crappy doctor who didn’t take him seriously. He cried for the life that was stolen from him and for everything he’d already lost: his job, his cousins, time with his family.
Colette tapped his shoulder and he turned to her. “We’re going to be going now. It was so nice meeting you in person Castiel. I hope to see you at the next meeting, but I’m sure we’ll talk again soon.”
“Well you can’t really tell until they’re bigger. Hit me up in a few years and I might be able to tell ya.”
Castiel didn’t leave until the next morning.
Alicia pulled Castiel to his feet and dragged him to the play area with Dean and Patience following behind. The two men lowered themselves back to the floor while the girls quickly started offering them ‘food’. Max appeared less tense with the return of his sisters but still kept his eyes down. While Dean ‘ate’ a plastic waffle Alicia had given him, Castiel addressed Patience. “Can you tell Max that I am Castiel and this is Dean? We are very excited to meet you all and would love to get to know him better when he is more comfortable.”
“The kids…”
“I know we wanted to look around the city a bit, but I’m too tired. I think we should unpack and then relax for a little while. Maybe after a nap, we could go out?”
They made their way through the studio and out into the bright sunlight. “So, you and Castiel huh?”
Castiel paused. He looked down at the puppy and then raised his eyes to the sky. A slow smile spread across his face. He lifted a hand and spelled out the word ‘Nimbus’.
Impala67: that explains it. i dont play wow
“Can I try?!”
They were joined again ten minutes later by the agency reps and continued their meeting. Mr. Rocha explained the therapy they were doing with Max and gave them some pointers on how they should treat him until they could meet with the new therapist. Castiel didn’t like some of the things he was hearing and he knew his husband’s expressions well enough to know that he didn’t either. The man instructed them to not speak to Max until he made eye contact, to not include him in conversations with his siblings to try and force an interaction, and to ask him to respond verbally before resorting to nonverbal gestures. They weren’t about to argue and cause problems, so they agreed.
“I mean it. With any luck, he’ll be too sore to teach class tomorrow.”
Dean’s phone chimed and he pulled it out before snorting. “Oh my God.” He typed out a response and put the phone back in his pocket. “Gabe said your doctor slipped him her number on his way out.”
“I can sleep right here on the floor. Brought a sleeping bag and everything.” Dean continued to rub circles into his back.
Castiel really was thirsty and downed half the glass in one go. “Thanks.”
“It’s policy to keep the boys and girls separated. And he sees Maria with Mr. Rocha several times a week. She interprets for their therapy sessions.”
“Uhh… After I think.”
Dean met Cas’s eyes and the other man smiled warmly at him. Man up, Winchester! He cleared his throat, “Yea Cas. Let’s go. I could definitely use a drink.”
“Hey, it’s ok babe. We have an answer now right? You’re going to be ok.”
It turned out that they could and Dean was even able to find a local breeder who had some. Dean sent him a quick email explaining the situation and rejoined the family. The kids got a few more Disney movies so they popped one in and snuggled on the couch with fluffy blankets and popcorn.
“Oh thank God. I’m tired too. We slept almost eleven hours but that is not our bed and my whole body feels stiff.”
“Whoa, wait. You’re leaving?”
Dean grinned at her. “You bet. Got them all set up in the kitchen. We can go put our toppings on and play a few rounds while they cook.”
“She?”
He checked his watch. Any minute now. He busied himself unpacking their dinner. Ellen had packed all the toppings separately so he could reheat everything properly. After a few minutes in the oven, he was assembling the first burger when he heard the sound of the Impala pulling into the garage. He raced back into the living room to turn the camera on before going back to the kitchen.
“It’s possible, but I doubt it. Most people who deny being stressed do so because they don’t want to acknowledge that they’re not in control. I’ve gotten to know you over the past few months and your behavior doesn’t match that of someone in denial. You face every issue with Max head on and have voiced it when you’re concerned. I think you’d admit it if you were feeling stressed.”
Dean snorted and nudged him. “Ass. I need to go tell them you’re awake.” They shared another kiss and Dean left to find a nurse.
“Don’t worry. It’s almost over anyway and there’s enough people here to stay with the kids.”
The audiologist was just as rude as the doctor and he almost felt like he was inconveniencing her just by being there. She went through the instructions for the test, telling him to press a button whenever he heard a beep. The low tone in his ears that was now always present only became more noticeable as the noise cancelling headphones were put on. Sometimes he couldn’t tell if he actually heard anything or if it was just the ringing. The doctor snapped at him a few times to remember to press the button and by the time he left the booth, he somehow felt like he had failed, which was an odd reaction to have for a medical test.
He read it. Dean can see all over his face that he read it. His eyes are wide with shock at being caught and he definitely looks guilty. While they stare at each other, Dean has the thought that he should be angry over Cas going through his stuff, but that just doesn’t seem as important compared to the dread that’s slowly settling in the pit of his stomach.
“You… um, like a date?”
Patience’s birthday was the day before Thanksgiving. Everyone agreed when Castiel and Dean announced that they would be holding a separate party on Saturday instead of at Thanksgiving dinner. Castiel’s birthday was three days before Christmas and he hated it as a child when family members tried to skimp and get him one gift for both days. His parents and Gabriel never did. They always made sure to celebrate each separately and Castiel was determined to do the same for Patience.
The methods suggested by the psychologist for helping Max are very outdated techniques and are now strongly discouraged. He was not being intentionally malicious, but was just misinformed. He truly wanted to help Max.
Dean broke into a wide grin. “Oh, my friend; prepare to be educated.”
Castiel told him what happened. “She shouldn’t have to think like that Dean. She’s only five. She shouldn’t be responsible for the twins. That’s supposed to be my job and I can’t do it.” He shuddered and sobbed louder.
“Yes. That sounds vaguely familiar.” He gave Dean a breathtaking smile. “Thank you for coming all this way Dee. I don’t know how I could handle this alone.”
“Becky, hmm? What a charming name.” Balthazar cooed.
“Thanks, Charlie. I’ll think about it.”
Charlie leaned closer. “Let me tell you something. I’ve seen this a lot and so have my colleagues. Some doctors don’t like mysteries. They want to be right and if the patient’s illness is too vague or unclear, they jump to a logical and easy conclusion. There’s a saying, ‘When you hear hoofbeats, don’t think zebras’. It means that the most logical conclusion is usually the right one, but some doctors take it too far. They assume everyone is ok or has something simple and they dismiss the idea of zebras entirely.”
“I said your name like three times. Where did you go?”
Impala67: hey. cool cardback. havent seen that one before. where’d u get it?
First, he ducked into the craft store and found the employee he had spoken with on the phone. With a bright smile, she took the envelope he handed her and promised to have his item ready quickly.
“Then what?”
Castiel had listened with a growing detachment until that last part. “Hearing aids? I might need hearing aids? And what about the spinning? Will it ever stop?”
“Then I suppose you’ll be stuck with me for a while.”
Cas’s eyes narrowed further before they widened in comprehension. “Do you- do you think we’re…
Thankfully, the children were settling in so well that it made getting back to work easier for both Castiel and his husband. Naturally, Bobby would let Dean go home if anything happened, but Castiel’s bosses would not be nearly as understanding. He’d used practically all the vacation days he’d saved up over the years on their trip and Mr. Adler expected him to stay focused now that he was back. Of course, his workload was much smaller than it had been earlier in the year - for which Castiel was grateful. He was finding it difficult to concentrate when he kept thinking about what his kids were doing and wishing he was with them. Balthazar was a big help. Since they were in the same department, he would nudge Castiel back on track whenever he needed it and kept Raphael from noticing the new father’s distractedness.
Castiel grunted in disagreement. “Cold.”
Dean gasped. He cleared his throat and crossed his arms. “Psh. Jealous? No. Why would you think that?”
Castiel chuckled at that one. “Six times would be impressive,” he mused.
It was another hour before they finally got around to eating dinner. They agreed to wait until after they’d eaten to read the rest of the e-mail. Castiel was shocked when Dean finished in record time and then proceeded to say that the pie could wait.
“I think this is his way of protecting you. The truth can be pretty painful sometimes.”
They both spoke at once. “Pepperoni and pineapple.”
“A tumor… I could have a tumor?”
“What?”
“Sounds like you’ve been through a lot. I’d like to do a quick exam and check on that concussion, but then you’re free to go. I would like you to make an appointment with my office when you’re feeling better. It doesn’t sound like your previous neurologist was very thorough, but I can’t do a more detailed exam while you’re concussed.”
“I suppose that will stop now that you know I’m a man.” Cas mumbled.
Dean blushed a bit. “I guess.”
“Yea, sure.”
“Great! Santa’s already paid for him, so y’all are good to go. You got a box in your car?”
. Shit
Castiel kept up his leisurely thrusts. “Ask nicely,” he crooned.
“No Cas. He’s a great guy. He seems to really make you happy.”
Castiel chuckled. “You’re just like your Daddy. Go find him and he’ll get you something to eat. I’ll be here keeping Max company.”
Meg had saved both his and Balthazar’s belongings from Sandover and gleefully reported that Raphael was not pleased over having to take over for both of them. In just a few days, the man had completely lost his composure and was snapping at everyone. He also still had a wonderful bruise that was taking its time healing up.
“What does that mean?”
In contrast to their Thanksgiving, Patience’s party was chaotic. Since Patience wasn’t in school yet (they’d made the decision to homeschool until her English was better) there weren’t many children to invite. She didn’t have many friends in her ballet class (even though her English was much better, most children were confused by the accent and random language changes) but she had some. Although with the holiday, only two of them, Claire and Kevin, were able to come. There was also a four-year-old boy who lived next door who showed up.
Balthazar scoffed. “Probably some of those little followers of his from advertising.”
Dean studied his face carefully and then threw his head back in laughter. He kept trying to speak, but couldn’t seem to mange it. “You mean—” he bent over his knees, shoulders shaking, “all this shit—” more laughter, “was—” Castiel was starting to worry at this point, “for nothing?!” Dean’s laughter was sounding more hysterical and pretty soon the ridiculousness of the last few months caught up with him and Castiel joined in.
Dean’s eyes darkened. “Mmm, yes please. But let’s get outta here first. Really don’t wanna pop a boner in the doctor’s office.”
Castiel was putting their plates on the dining table when he heard Dean call from the living room. “Hey Cas? What’s this box for?”
When he was finally called back, he barely got his story through to the distracted doctor before the man started doing the same neurological exam his primary had done. He asked questions that Castiel had already voiced the answers to, which proved he hadn’t been listening in the first place. He was told to return in a few days for some tests and sent on his way. The whole meeting took less than ten minutes.
The note continued on to state how to pay his fine and was signed by the head of the HOA.
“What?”
Castiel huffed in annoyance. “Bal. I’m ready to go.”
Castiel took her hand and walked towards the garage. “We’re going to rake leaves.”
Castiel set the box on the coffee table before going to retrieve Gabriel’s camera. If he hid it on the bookshelf, he should get the perfect angle to record Dean opening the box.
When the dance ended Jo walked over to Dean and gave him a huge smile before punching him in the arm. “What the hell Jo?!”
“Hey guys. See ya met Cas.” He signed the few words he knew as he spoke. “Thought y’all might wanna play Monopoly.”
They talked and cried and talked some more over the next few hours. Dinner was just a few sandwiches as they were both too exhausted to cook. The couple fell into bed early thinking about the next time they would see their children.
“Ok.” Dean raised his eyebrows. Castiel huffed out a breath. “I’m nervous. What if there’s something really wrong with me?”
Dean snorted and shoved him. “That makes more sense.”
Two weeks passed quickly. Castiel and Dean saw their children every other day. As Jaqueline promised, the visits got progressively longer. After a week they stopped being supervised, though Maria always remained outside the door in case they needed help communicating (which they never did).
Balthazar let out a loud sigh. “You know for a gay man, you really are boring.”
Castiel just looked at him with glazed eyes before nodding slowly. It’s fine. It’s fine. Just taking care of my friend. Dean took a breath before reaching down and undoing the button on Cas’s pants. He felt eyes on him the whole time and tried to keep his hands from shaking as he pulled down the other man’s jeans. Cas lifted his hips to help, but otherwise stayed silent. Dean tried not to stare as inch by inch of skin was revealed. He looked up to Cas to find the man watching him with hooded eyes. He turned away and finished getting the pants off before scrambling to cover the now bare legs with the blanket. “Thank you Dean.” Castiel said softly.
“What kind?”
“Yes. I saw you during the show. Is always easy to spot those who are moved by the dance. Your reactions were beautiful.” Castiel came a few steps closer and stared at Dean intently. He was startled by how blue the other man’s eyes were. “What is wrong?”
Dean leaned over to kiss him. “I’m sure everything will be fine babe. Did you call those specialists?”
No. He shut that thought down. No way was he trying on
Castiel started his tale again while Dean interjected with any details he forgot. He was kind and attentive. How was this guy related to the last ENT he saw?
After a few minutes of silence, Castiel opened the door. His eyes were red-rimmed, making his normal blue irises so much brighter. “Hello Dean.”
was printed in front a tiger striped background.
“That’s a lot of detail bro. You sure you didn’t hit on him?” Gabe gave him a shit-eating grin.
“For once I agree with the shrew, Cassie.”
“Some nausea, no vomiting, and only get out of breath if the attack is particularly bad. No headaches.”
After a few minutes, he heard Dean’s voice. “Jesus, babe. What happened?”
Castiel turned to watch his daughter. She seemed to be having fun with Ben. Maybe it would be good for him to try and become friends with Dean. The other man had a point; he’d been on his own for too long. Castiel deserved a social life and Dean appeared to be a good guy. Castiel smiled warmly. “That sounds like a great idea Dean.”
Castiel fought the urge to roll his eyes. “No. Just said I would keep trying. I’m seeing him again in a few weeks remember? I’ll talk to him then if I have to.”
Food consumed and candles on the cake blown out, it was time for presents. Of course, everyone got Patience way too many gifts and Castiel was worried this trend would continue. A little spoiling was good, but he didn’t want his children to turn greedy. He’d have to try to reign them in. But after seeing how happy Patience was, he figured that chat could wait until after Christmas. A quick glance at the twins and the small toys Ellen had included for them made him consider waiting until after
Castiel looked a bit embarrassed. He picked up his coffee and spoke into the cup. “I decided to try carving the wax into little ornaments. There wasn’t much else I could think of to make. They’re probably stupid.” He scowled at his drink.
Bobby, Ellen, Jo, Sam, and Gabriel showed up around five. They brought the kids more presents and everyone chuckled as they ripped them open. Dinner was wonderful and smashing up the gingerbread house to share for desert was the most exciting part of the meal.
“Jo has talent. Is good to know she has family that supports her.”
“Only for you babe.”
The shape of the package sitting in his box gave him pause. From the end, it looked like a cylinder and Castiel was instantly suspicious. He eased the tube out slowly and gasped at the big, bold print on the side.
Dean did not handle the ride better.
Christmas Eve found everyone at Bobby and Ellen’s for their annual party. They’d agreed weeks ago that Gabriel was going to dress as Santa and the kids were very excited to hear that he was visiting them and wanted to look their best. The children each had gotten a new outfit. The girls looked adorable in their sparkly dresses and Max sported the cutest sweater vest with gingerbread men on it. After greeting all the adults, the kids disappeared into the room that had been set aside for them months ago to play with their toys.
“No, I
Rubbing his arm, he asked, “Why would I make fun of you? I thought you were awesome.” He lowered his voice, “So much better than these other losers.”
“Whiskey.” Castiel bit out before gulping heavily. “What’s wrong with me?”
The five days since Castiel lost his job were interesting. Dean was distraught over Castiel’s job but more at the situation than the fact that they were down to one income. Bobby’s garage was doing well and now that all the adoption fees were settled and their mortgage had already been paid off, they only had utilities and groceries as regular expenses.
At a red light a few blocks from the clinic, he spoke. “Bad day?”
After dinner, they played some pool and then took a walk though the park on their way back to the car. As they rounded a corner, there on the path under a lamppost, a box came into view. Someone, he suspected Gabriel, had covered it in bright pink sparkly paper. Castiel noticed it right away and looked at Dean curiously. Dean put on his best confused expression and shrugged. They got closer and noticed a note on top of the box that read ‘For Castiel’. Castiel’s eyebrows shot up and he looked around suspiciously. He turned to Dean again who couldn’t control his grin any longer. He nudged Castiel closer to the box.
Castiel rolled his eyes. “Open it and see.”
“Not always in that context, but yea. This city has an interesting history dude.”
“I didn’t even know he liked guys.”
His friend turned and lit up like he hadn’t just seen him forty minutes ago. “Cassie! How did it go? Have you met this lovely creature?” He gestured towards Becky who let out another giggle and blushed.
Eileen dropped her face into her hands with a sigh before lifting her head again. “Ok, maybe he’s working up to telling us. Just don’t say anything.”
Her hair was pulled back into its normally severe bun and her eyes studied him with the same intensity she studied every house on their street for HOA violations. “Hello, Castiel. How have you been?”
“I’m really not stressed.” Castiel looked at the name of the medication. “Will this make me drowsy? I have work and my kids…”
He followed Meg to one of the puppy playrooms. She spoke as they walked, “I was going to text you. He stayed an extra twenty minutes playing with her before he left. I thought he was going to cry when he had to leave.”
She chuckled and shook her head. “Castiel that sounds like Meniere’s disease. That even explains your drop attack a few weeks ago.”
Dean cut him off. This was the second time today he’d managed to make Cas think he’d done something wrong. “No, Cas. You didn’t do anything.”
“What?”
It didn’t get any better when they sat down to play. Dean would lean in to murmur advice in Castiel’s ear and Cas hardly ever made a move without glancing at Dean to try and gauge his opinion. They seemed to have whole conversations with looks and gestures. Maybe they didn’t realize how obvious they were being, but to Sam and Eileen, whose every interaction took place through non-verbal communication, they may as well have been holding up neon signs.
“Well we usually mill about with the snacks for a bit before we split up. Family members have their own get together down the hall.”
“What d’ya mean?”
“How could I forget?”
Castiel rose and shook it numbly. He turned and left the office on autopilot. Before he reached the end of the hall, Raphael caught up to him. “Castiel. I hope there are no hard feelings. I was just looking out for the best of the company.”
“Go.” Sam made a shooing motion.
“Yes.”
Castiel sobbed in Dean’s arms as his husband rubbed his back. “My God, Dean. Our poor baby. He must have been so scared.” He shuddered and a fresh wave of tears ran down his cheeks.
His son ran up and hugged him tight around his legs before reaching his arms up in a request to be held. Castiel picked him up and walked over to stand next to the tortoise. “Have you been playing with George?” Max nodded. “Did he do anything cool?”
“Guess so. Look, I mean it. I really care about him and I could see myself falling for him. But you’re the most important thing in his life. If we can’t get along, he’s gonna pick you over me. I wouldn’t have it any other way but can we at least try to get along?”
“Heya Cas. Small world huh?”
Castiel smiled at her enthusiasm. “Of course you can.” He handed her the other rake and they got to work.
“Please,” Dean pleaded.
The woman was still staring at him with a confused frown. “Ok then. Well, good luck with that.” She turned and practically ran into the store.
“That’s not good Cas. You could have a concussion.”
The door slammed shut behind him which caused the group of around fifteen dancers to stop and stare at him. His eyes landed on Jo whose expression quickly went from surprised to annoyed. The music that had been playing abruptly stopped and Dean looked over to see a dark-haired guy watching him from next to the sound system. He titled his head and narrowed his eyes at him before he called out, “Yes? Can I help you?”
“No strippers.”
Dean brought Castiel a spiked eggnog and they stood chatting with Jesse and Cesar when Sam walked in with a beautiful woman on his arm. Castiel nearly choked when he recognized that woman as Eileen. He nudged Dean and his husband looked shocked before a smirk settled on his face. He made his way to his brother and pulled him in for a hug. When he pulled back, he gave Eileen an obvious once-over. He signed as best he could as he spoke. “Alright Sammy! Dating the teach. If I wasn’t a married man…”
A look at his husband showed Dean was dismayed as well. Castiel nodded and reached down to grab some things. Between the two of them, it only took one trip to pack the waiting taxi. All of their children’s worldly belongings fit into two boxes and three trash bags. Castiel wasn’t a materialistic person, but the pitiful sight was just another blow, a reminder of how much the children had lost.
Castiel was a bit upset for the next few days. He kept insisting he was fine, but Dean knew he was upset that the puppy had supposedly been moved to a different rescue. It was killing him to keep this secret. Every time he looked at Castiel’s slumped shoulders or heard him sigh he wanted to break down and tell him. He resisted. He had held out for months, a few more days and the surprise would be well worth it.
“What the hell?” The chick (he figured going by the username and the fact that they said they had a boyfriend), must have been more upset than he thought.
“Cas, I use those for everyone. Even Charlie. I also called you Angel and Honey a few times.”
“First, we eat. Gotta soak up the rest of that alcohol. Then, we toss out that mattress and burn those sheets. Sound good?”
Castiel grinned. “I live a few blocks away on Vallette.”
For the next hour, Dr. Adamson performed a large variety of tests. He checked everything. Nose and throat were normal. Heart and lungs were good too. He also checked his reflexes to confirm his nervous system was working correctly. The eye exam revealed some abnormalities. His vision didn’t track smoothly; especially when the doctor had Castiel shake his head and then try to track an item. Not only did the head shake make him wobbly and nearly fall over, the doctor noted something called nystagmus in his eyes. When he shook his head, his balance system struggled to compensate. This caused his eyes to jerk back and forth in an attempt to re-orient himself in space.
