“I knew different words to that verse,” Kit remarked.
“Or maybe he is flirting, but not just after getting a leg over tonight, but playing a longer game,” John suggested, field glasses still before his eyes.  “He’s heading back under the big, old trees.  Ms Swann is gazing after him.”
I turned to face west, leaving Kit behind me.
I shot another bolt close to the last.
“What other mistake?”
“And I shouldn’t be loving cities and roaming around through throngs of people.”
“Change into something else, so I can look at you while you speak,” John said.  He felt the weight lessen, but he did not open his eyes.
“Come,” he urged.
I smelled the trees, the damp bark, the leaf mould and the moss.  There was water running somewhere below me.  An owl hooted.  A wolf howled.  The breeze grew stronger.
“The arbour behind the oleander,” he said.
I sniffed.  I smelt the spices along with the yew and juniper and pine.  I rubbed my head against the log.  Its bark was very smooth.
Sherlock looked over his shoulder at me.  “You requested warmer weather.”
A woman glided out of the trees.  Her dark hair was piled high on her head, her cloak was picked with silvery threads.  She swirled about the tree, shrugged the cape from her shoulders and tossed her head until her tresses fell, her hair pins flying into the grass glittering with captured moonbeams.  She paused an instant, facing towards me.
He wrinkled his nose.  “No, but someone inexperienced who needs better tutelage.”
“Why would it come back?”
The man's shirt was long and shredded, an old scar ran halfway down the inside of his bare leg, another marked his forearm.
I leaned over the parapet.  “Is that a moat?”
“She’s our cook,” Mrs Hudson said, placing another tray on the table, this one holding two glass dishes and a plate of tiny biscuits.
“Hold out a leg.”
"I thought that had been turned into a sewer," I said and it seemed a pity that that had been the fate of almost all of London's rivers.
“A rest, while we wait for moonrise?” Sherlock asked softly.
Puck’s eyes grew very wide and his gaze darted back and forth between his king and his prince.
Mrs Hudson called Archie and he took his leave of Greg and Sherlock.
He had whispered it again and again as my exertions had moved his body beneath me.
Slowly, I bent my knees.
“She doesn’t keep you on a lead, does she?” I ventured to guess, straightening up enough to pat him on the back.
Mrs Hudson was pouring boiling water into a large yellow teapot in the middle of the kitchen table.  “That was fast.”
I closed my hand over his fist, rubbed my thumb across his knuckles.
The boat reached the landing.  Sherlock stepped onto it and bowed.
Of the black mountain-lake,
I turned to look at Holmes.  He’d been very quiet.  I found him staring at me.
I pinched the arrow between my thumb and forefinger and flexed my other fingers.  I understood muscles and their functions.  What in my hand could have told him that?
He glanced down at me and scowled.  “John?”
I imagined the hill must have had many names, but I liked the sound of the one Sherlock used.
I scowled in the dark.  “I’ve seen it in the shops,” I countered.  My fingers fluttered down his side to that sweet curve I loved so well.  A little conversation was not going to divert me from my ultimate goal.
“Because of the river?”
“I was so annoyed I didn’t know how to adjust the camera focus manually,” John explained.  “I was sure the auto-focus was malfunctioning.”
“Your family always did do things differently,” Lord Holmes said with a trace of sadness in his voice.
“As much as I’m going to be, I suppose.”
“Not as brightly lit as the foyer and the hallway, but there were two gas sconces over the fireplace, in which a coal fire was burning steadily, and a gas chandelier above a round table situated in the middle of the room.  We were told that Madame Willow would join us momentarily.  The servant then closed the curtains and withdrew.”
Sherlock hummed.  "There should be paths for the gravediggers and the mourners."
“Ah,” I said and accepted that invitation, too.
He set the harp in a corner.  When he stood again, he held out an arrow, source likewise unknown.
I drained my wine glass and resumed my narration.
“Exactly so, as we enjoy your company,” Oberon continued.
“I’d rather not,” I said.
Despite the balmy air, I felt a chill.  “We’re going there?”
“I didn’t need to.  Someone had already gone through the box and dropped the partly-unwrapped book on top,” he replied.  “Fool.  I spotted the binding half a block away and scooped up the whole carton with hardly a break in my stride.”
I held my lower lip taut with my teeth and swiped at it with the edge of the stone.  The third attempt stung and I tasted my blood.
“Oh God, I need a cup of tea,” John said passing the receptionist on his way into the staff room.
“She was neither imposing of stature nor alluring of face or figure,” I began.
The paper rustled when I folded over another sheet.  I put all the blue pencils in my shirt pocket and went to stand by the bottom corner of the bed.
“Because the swan is changing into a man and you caught it on film, John.  I’ve not read of that ever having been done before.”
“And now I do,” I repeated.  I drew in a long breath and let it out slowly.  “So what’s Wild-Eyed Boy do to amuse himself other than try to seduce you?”
“Quite new,” Sherlock replied.  “Well, from my childhood.  I did most of my early experiments in the kitchens, before the lab was set up.”
“Dean Bradley,” Sherlock called, his voice pitched very low, but still carrying in the hushed space.
Sherlock stood in shirtsleeves before the grand piano in the corner, swaying as he played, his back to me.  Sunlight slanted through the southern windows, throwing blues and violets over him, greens and golds at his feet.
“Financial worries a thing of the past?”
“No.  I told you this summer that you were changing.”
I raised my eyebrows.
“And this physical proof lent credence to the more ethereal claims that had been made about their son,” Holmes deduced.
My brows must have hit my hairline.
“Am I seeing what I think I am, Sherlock?” I asked, not taking my eyes off the mother and son as I stood up.
I parted my lips and he pushed it in.  The flavour was bright.
I took a step back.
I held the knife out to my side.  My chest burned.  The blood was warm against my skin.
"I was at home when you texted," Sherlock replied and glanced at the forensics team crunching across the gravel from the river stairs.
Mycroft smiled that tight smile of his.  “You’re welcome, John.”  He got into the car.  “I always know whom I should contact if I need an extra hand,” he added as the door closed.
The room throbbed with the beat of drums.  The ebb and flow of a rhythm I knew, of blood through a beating heart that was slowing down.  I hid my face in Sherlock’s hair.  “Don’t leave
My eyes half-closed.
Sherlock shook his head.  “Not yet.  That takes the whole year.”
I exhaled and turned back to the hall.  I still was not sure I could attempt to fence with him, but I could join this mind game of his.
“It is good to see you, John.  It has been too long,” Angelo said, patting John’s shoulder.  “Anything you like.  On the house.”  Angelo drew his hand away and pressed it to his heart.  “Do not wound me by saying no.”
“You aren’t helping,” I gasped.
John’s muscles remembered old motions, seemed eager to practice them again.
I looked up from my reading, counting the strikes under my breath, …”two, three, four…”
I tilted my head, shut my eyes for a moment before I spoke.  “I can hear the music.  It was clearer before, but I can still hear it faintly even now, and...”
The outstretched hands with which Ms Swann had approached Sherlock drifted down to her sides.
“I think so,” I said.  “And you?”
The taxi tooted.
"I’d climb up the mountain for to mourn and weep,
Sherlock had been wearing the same scent for the past few days.  For the longer days and brightening skies, he’d said.
“How is this possible?  Was he not actually dead?  ”
Sherlock sat back.  The pattern was finished.  Stalks were sprouting where lines crossed, small leaves unfurled and buds formed as I watched.  “It’s a season wheel,” he said.  “Quite appropriate for an equinox.”  He stared at me.  “You didn’t intend that either.”
What John could see was a fairly new flat of the open-plan variety, littered with books and papers, photographs and art supplies.  There was a keyboard along the western wall near a half-open door revealing a smaller room equally bright with late afternoon light.  The only thing keeping the flat from having the cluttered appearance of Baker Street was the size of the space and the sparser and less eclectic nature of the furnishings.
The smell’s intoxicating.
I put my gloves on and took hold of the tree limb.
Around us, not a twig stirred with his motion, as though he were no more than a whiff of smoke.
His head shifted on my lap, the hand behind my back tightening and pulling me forward as though he were adjusting a pillow.
Oberon opened the purse at his waist and drew forth a golden key.  Puck rose to his knees, resting his chin on the table to watch.
“Not at first, no.”
“Nothing else?” John persisted.
I couldn’t understand why Sherlock hadn’t dispatched this creature.  Perhaps it wasn’t polite to incinerate guests inside the house.
I did not look back to see where, focussing instead on the centre of the door where the iron hinges did not reach.  I wished to show him, give him further proof that he had not erred in retaining me, that it would not be a mistake to give me more.   My arm was steady as I sighted between the feathers.
I tilted it to the light.  “Madeline Anabel Lenore Usher and…ah, here is Lt Simpson, but why wasn’t ‘beloved husband’ written on the tomb?”
We gathered up our cards and fanned them out.  The oh we both uttered was simultaneous.
“You’d end up splashing at least the stitches on your lower back trying,” Sherlock said, rinsing the flannel and hanging it on the towel rail.  He tapped John behind the knee.
Sherlock raised his camera.
The man was kneeling.  The woman gathered her cloak over one arm and lifted a booted leg.  The man crouched lower and she stepped on his shoulder and swung her other leg over the horse’s back.
for the flame on the hill in the night.
“Keep doing that,” I said.  “Your heart’s strong; it can keep doing that.”  I pressed his knuckles against my bottom lip. “Open you eyes now,” I whispered over them.   “Open them for me.”  I had crawled up onto the bed, knelt beside him.  “One more miracle for me, Sherlock.  Please.”
I clutched Sherlock’s wrist.
I held my hand over his head, poured more water into my palm.  It dripped through my fingers onto his hair, onto his face.  Red water.  It stained the sheets.
Exactly.
Mycroft inclined his head.
~~~o0o~~~
~~~~~~oo0oo~~~~~~
"To find the dock-master," Sherlock said.  "We need a couple longshoremen and a cart."
“I didn’t understand where I was,” I continued.  “I thought I was just up on the heath, tired and drunk and seeing things.”
“Strangely calm,” Lestrade replied, almost as if it had just struck him.  “Though I’ve seen parents do remarkable things when they’re defending their children.”
I squinted into the dark and thought I could see wooden posts.
Somewhere in the telling of the Morrows’ tale, I had lost the gloom that suffused my own portion of the saga.  I had not thought of the Morrows since Holmes’s return, and recounting their story to him hadn’t clarified my understanding of it one jot.
“Are you writing on me?” I asked.
“Five minutes,” I murmured and slipped from behind him.  “Just five minutes.”
“Yes, it did,” Puck conceded, “but I was there to snap it up and bring it hence.”
“It’s the scent,” he said.  “The Joy.”
He lifted his head at that, lips pressed together and eyebrows raised.  “Yeah.”
I tried not to scowl.  I didn’t want some stranger in our house.
My shoes bumped over the threshold as I was dragged across it.
His tail thumped harder.
“There is the interesting box of which I spoke,” Puck said and sat at the king’s feet.
I raised an eyebrow.
He opened the case, slid the shining disc into the dark.
“Yes,” Sherlock said, “repugnant fellow.”
“That probably clinched it,” I admitted, "my carrying on with them instead of going home when the play was over.  She’d been good in her role.  On the Tube, she'd been chatty, vivacious and pretty.  There’d still been glitter in her hair.
Once more, the music paused.  I had managed to remember the figures Sherlock had taught me with the care of an armourer showing how a new gun should be assembled.    He hadn’t explained explicitly how it might be, but I had been sure a misstep would mean far more than a trodden toe and had applied myself accordingly.
“Good thinking,” Sherlock said.
I looked at Sherlock.  His attention had shifted again to the band in his hand.  He had it suspended from his thumb.
The path widened.  A wave of speech and song washed over us as the trees gave way to trampled grasses.
His fingers tightened around my hand as he glanced down at his cards.  He frowned.  “Both my kings looked like you.  The king of hearts held your gun; the king of spades a scalpel.  Between them was an eight of clover.  The king of hearts now looks like me and is climbing across the eight to...join...the king of spades.”  A flush crept up Sherlock's cheeks.
“I don’t want to get up now,” Sherlock said.
They felt very good in my hand.
By my other side, Kit was crunching on nuts.
drifted over the room.  I leaned back against the window casement and watched for Mrs Hudson’s hands to play over the upper reaches of the strings of the grand harp.
“John?  Are you all right?”
I caught the phone, checked the seat of my chair for pins and finding none, sat.  “No you didn’t.  You were married to your work.”
>>>>>>>>o0o<<<<<<<<
Don’t know.  I think that’s where Sherlock wants to go.
Yet I could not give myself over fully to the pleasures of the table with the jester’s tintinnabulation intruding into every pause in the music or the conversation.  Neither could I ignore the incantatory voice on the other side of Sherlock.  I kept having to resist the urge to lift the tablecloth to see what Wild Eyes might be attempting under its cover.
I let out a long sigh.
John stroked with his fingertips.
John’s hands were in Sherlock’s hair.
He got up on his elbow and stared at me.  “Where did you read about doing this?”
That it wasn’t the buildings on the south side of Melcomb Street was no surprise, but neither was it the oak and evergreen forest under whose branches I had hunted with Sherlock.  Instead, a broad terrace stretched from the thresholds of the French doors to a balustrade broken by what appeared to be a staircase down to a wide river whose waters reflected the radiance of a full moon.  The far bank was indistinct, neither could I discern the outline of the grand trees I had come to know well.  Only the modest foliage of low shrubs and plants blooming in urns softened the geometry of the view.  The scent of their pale flowers wafted in with the cool air – hyacinth and lily and lilac.
Despite the closer bond we had forged since Sherlock…yes, yes, that is the name I whisper in the dark and cannot say in the light without thinking on it…since Sherlock had returned to me, I had never complained of my hurt at his having left me to grieve for years…and he…had never told me how my marriage had made him believe I would not care overmuch whether he was dead or not.
We stood in the forecourt garden of the Tate Modern, Sherlock slowly circling the raised platform that held the officially untitled sculpture popularly dubbed
John and Sherlock exchanged glances.
He blinked at me.
The inside of Sherlock’s thighs were pressed against the outside of mine.  My head sagged against my upper arm.  The sun was warm on my head, his thighs cool against mine.
Mrs Hudson didn’t miss that.  “They haven’t impaled one of us yet,” she said.
I poured milk from the little pitcher, added the tea and sipped.
Perhaps she isn’t usually here.
The starlight sparkled in his curls.
“I did,” I grumbled and shifted in my chair.  “They looked so happy, Holmes.  Ten years at least had dropped from their age.”
“Which one’s Chiltern Court?” I asked.
“No,” I replied and slapped the journal onto the table beside my chair, narrowly missing my tea cup.  A few more measured inhalations had apparently been needed.  I took a couple of them before I spoke.  “The artist’s brother is no doubt a worthy fellow, but I don’t see why he has to represent you to the British public.  It doesn’t do you an ounce of justice.”
Molly popped the tiny tart that was balanced on the top of her dish into her mouth.  She closed her eyes for a moment and swallowed.  “Boar,” she said.  “Chapalu’s been hunting.”
I froze with my hand on the door of the refrigerator.  There had been.  I had used them for a side experiment that had occurred to me during my research.
“Next was Kate Whitney.  She placed a small pistol on the table and gave it a little push.  Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Mary wince as the gun skittered past her.  Madame Willow released Mary’s hand and stopped the gun from falling off the table.  She didn’t pick it up or rest her hand on it as she had with the letters and the shawl, however.
A sharp pain in my leg distracted me from the stench.  The golden dragon was up on its hind legs and biting into my thigh.  On the floor, Sherlock’s dragon was scrabbling to get its feet under itself.  Its silver scales shone in the fiery light, as it collapsed back onto its belly.
Sherlock simply shifted his arm to indicate where he had pointed first.
Sherlock half smiled, another cutting edge to John and another name.  Perhaps he should find out all his names.
“I’m too sleepy for this,” I said, but pulled the first document from the bottom of the pages on my lap and squinted at it.  “It’s a marriage certificate.”
I smiled and smashed my hands together.  We were luring him into the river.
I hadn’t noticed the heron among the reeds.  His beak was gold in the evening sun.
He always came to see what I was drawing if he was around and awake, but I drew at other times, too, and those he wouldn’t have seen unless he had looked through the folder before.  From the sound of it, he hadn’t.
John reached out for Sherlock’s shoulder with a sigh.  “They were hard, bitter months.  I thought I had died, but no one had bothered to bury me,” John said.  He glanced away.  “I would have chosen to go with you, but you’ve told me why you had to go alone and I understand.”  His hand tightened on Sherlock’s shoulder.  He looked back at Sherlock, pulled him close enough to kiss and held him there, with his hand tangled in Sherlock’s curls.
“That’s interesting,” he said and I saw that the small chains were horizontal to the floor, like so many compass needles pointing north.  He moved his hand above mine and the chains fell straight down.
“Saved, yes, thank you, Miss Turner.”
Rathbourne’s box was well-situated; little of the stage would be obscured from view and at that distance the art of set and costume would be most convincing.  Despite the full house, it was not too hot in the auditorium, which was a blessing.  As we were not interested in mingling with the throng, we settled early into our seats.
I may have been dreaming.  I was in a lovely place to dream.
“Did you catch something?” I asked, shifting my attention to his face and scalp.
The front door banged and Billy dashed up the stairs.  “Your hansom is at the kerb,” he said, puffing a bit between words.
“No,” Sherlock said.  “I asked him to send the food round later.”
Like the knives, it caught the light, which was surprising considering how dim they were and how small the band.
John stopped looking through his field glasses and checked Sherlock’s expression.  “You’re not joking, are you?”
A celeste tinkled.
I doubted this level of cooperation would last beyond the need to turn the next page, but I was happy to have the chance to see his whole arm in the correct position.  Quickly, I resumed sketching.  Accommodating a live model had never been an issue in my past; the biology and anatomy specimens had been long dead.  My pencil stopped, poised above the paper.  It was a cold thought.
Again and again I had registered a vow that I should deliver my soul upon the subject, but there was that in the cool, nonchalant air of my companion which made him the last man with whom one would care to take anything approaching to a liberty.  His great powers, his masterly manner, and the experience which I had had of his many extraordinary qualities, all made me diffident and backward in crossing him.
“So the baby was born in London?” I asked.
He began poking at the screen.
“Well, all right.  Maybe the stepladder, too.  We should open the window on the landing, I think.”  She turned towards the stairs.  “What was it you couldn’t find?”
He shook his head.  “Some come alone or in pairs, but they’ll usually be invited to join another campfire.  There’s only so much room in the clearing.”
“I am sorry,” John said.  “Maybe I should have stayed.”
“My interrogator came back and I told him that he could catch his neighbour, the coffin-maker, and his wife in flagrante if he went home right then,” Sherlock replied.
Lady Holmes touched her husband’s shoulder and the silvery drape of her sleeve gleamed. “River could never abide anyone hurting our boys.”  She fixed her eyes on her husband.  “You see, it was well worth giving birth to them in the River, storm or no storm.”
“When I was falling asleep…” Sherlock said.
“Only the first one,” Sherlock said.  “Any others will simply have to suffer.”
No.  I knew his face best and it held incredible allure for me. He was looking down as he so often is.  He had his phone in one hand.  That was a relief, because I knew my eyes were caressing every line and curve of his face.  Perhaps I would draw the first nude with mobile?  Surely someone’s done it already, but I don’t frequent the right places to have seen it, I suppose.
Kit is singing the beginning lines to
Sparks flew.  Some landed in his hair, glowing a moment before fading.  Others landed on his shoulders, sizzled and fell.
“I think so, but some other sorts might be mixed in.  I’m better with plants than with trees.  I’d have to ask Anji to be sure.”  Mrs Hudson tapped her lip. “Gabriel might remember.  I know they got them from the park for the most part.  They sketched there and knew some of the gardeners, but we were all collecting.  I couldn’t pass a fallen branch on the pavement without lugging it home to see if Anji thought it good enough.  Why, dear?”
Even from where I stood, I could smell it and my mouth began to water.
His shoulders relaxed.  “Yes, well, fairy gold is an illusion, a glamour.  It has its uses, of course, but that’s not what these are.”
He was half naked, wet and cold.
“Do you know where Sherlock is?”
John nodded and started up the tightly-coiled steps.
Sherlock had looked away when I glanced back at him.
I lowered my eyes, looked across the space between our chairs, and found Mr Holmes swiping through screens on his mobile with rapid flicks of his thumb.
Not here.
The candles burned low.
“His lips are like the roses fair…” I murmured.
Some in the reeds
Then, he started in on the touching.
They took the left-hand fork in the path, down the hill and under the bridge.
We’d spilled out of the station laughing and run across the heath.
There were singers on the gallery now or maybe the winged creatures painted on the ceiling sang.  The voices rose, urging me on.  My footsteps hit to their beat, harder and harder, until the floor resounded like a drum.  With each stomp, our fortress walls rose higher.  They would block every attempt against us.  All of us.  And within their safety, I could tend to Sherlock.
His phone buzzed again.
“Thank you,” Sherlock said.  “Might I enquire if any of the other invited mourners have preceded us into the crypt?”
I looked about and realised the hallway had emptied.  “All right,” I said and nodded.  “Lots of stories when we’re back.” I turned towards the voices I could hear in the vestibule and dragged the willow branch in that direction.
Sherlock gripped my shoulder.  When he spoke, his words were clipped and low or they were in my head and he didn’t speak aloud at all.
The sound seemed to rouse Sherlock.  He stepped away from noisome Cock No. 1 and looked at me.
“Yeah, it seems fine.”
A wave of heat came with the memory.
“The Misses Knight make no reference to her involvement.  I am without data on that side of things.”
“You get used to that as well,” Mycroft remarked.  “People will talk.”
I smiled.  It’s always a pleasure to have Sherlock’s attention.  “Not the same species, but, years ago in the Caribbean, I saw a green one from a train window.”
“Where are we?” I asked and opened my eyes.  “Oh.”
I turned and looked over my shoulder.
“Do you know what you are, Doctor Watson?” he managed to ask between peals of laughter, his face contorted by the effort.  The colours of his cap were separated by rows of diamonds.  They sparkled as he threw his head back, the bells at the tips of his cap jingling in accompaniment.
The hansom pulled up in front of the Dean’s Yard.  “Ready to help grieving Corvus now?” he asked, flinging the door open, seizing a satchel from the floor and alighting on the cobbles.
My gaze followed the flames upwards.
John often woke during the night, or a few hours after whenever they made it to bed, after a case.  In darkness, he’d shift closer to Sherlock’s warmth, curl his arm around chest or hip or shin and let sleep claim him again.  In the light, he’d rest a hand on the curls above the duvet’s edge when the air was chill or stroke along the double curve from shoulder to thigh when summer days led to covers being kicked away.
On his first leave home, his mother asked whether he wanted to take the clarinet abroad with him.  John told her to sell it or give it away.  He had brought it to university his first year and only touched it once.  First heartbreak.  He had barely been able to breathe into the instrument.  He had brought the clarinet home after that and left it there.  His mother said the neighbour’s son was going to start lessons.  The clarinet moved next door.
Sherlock snorted.  “Birth certificate, passport, corroborate that?”
A rectangle of faint light filled the opening where the pot sat.
“So little surprises me,” Wild Eyes lamented.  “I’d almost forgotten how good a really
I watched him whittling a fresh stick to a wicked point with three flashes of his knife.
Sherlock gasped.
John caught up.
Sherlock lifted the violin to his shoulder.  “Sometimes, the dark is better.”
“But a knight must go forth with lance and sword to fight any wild beast that threatens our realm,” Oberon said.
I looked up from the battered cod I was cutting.  “Was there a doctor in residence then, too?”
John stared out the window.  The day was grey and still.  He felt a twinge of what Sherlock felt when London was too quiet.  John teased Sherlock about his boredom, but knew he probably shouldn’t, because he, too, felt the restlessness creep under his skin on quiet days.  He attempted to hide it behind a book or a long walk ending in a glass of whiskey when he returned home.  It never worked; Sherlock always knew.  Fortunately for London, it rarely afflicted them both at the same time.
“Not without swinging them,” he said.
“There you go,” she said and placed the tripod over the half-burnt logs in the fireplace.  “That should keep your pot at the right distance from the flames if you don’t stoke them too high.”  She dusted off her hands.  “Now, you need to select which pot you want to use.  Mrs Turner and I poured over those instructions and we could not find any mention of it there and it makes a big difference, you know.”
The tambourine player arrived with a jangle.  He had garters of bells below his knees and above his elbows and naught else I could see.  He thumped his drum near the women’s heads.
I smoothed the nap of the upholstery on the arms of my chair.  I should have been grateful to take my ease after the two weeks of vigorous investigation from which Holmes and I had returned only the previous day.  The case that had taken us to the Cotswolds had involved more than a goodly share of traipsing up and down the countryside as well as some nocturnal and clandestine explorations of certain interiors belonging to the key suspects.  Our prompt discovery of the murder weapon had not narrowed the field as much as I had thought it would, the family having several extant branches, each as fruitful as the others, together with households replete with staff and landholdings well-populated with tenants, any of whom could have borne a grudge, real or imagined, against the deceased.  Unfortunately, their intricate tale, which had had me on tenterhooks the whole time Holmes was unravelling the tangled skein of clues and eliminating the numerous contenders one by one, was of that type that may never be shared with the public, even at a distant date and thoroughly disguised, and so there had been no point in working on its notes, already recorded in cursory fashion, and I had simply filed them away.
The room brightened and a nutty smell rode on the glowing air.
"This, I think you must witness yourself," he said.
Sherlock went to her.  “But I was.  The summers when he visited France were such fun.  In was much later, in the darkest corners, that I learned things that convinced me that his side wasn’t mine.”
“You know,” she continued, patting her hip.  “It’s been feeling better lately and this isn’t usually the time of year when it does.  I wonder if the melody has been having an effect on its own.”
“All the boys modelled for her sketches for that one.”
I nodded, taking it in.  “A mellow place.”
He dropped it when the flame reached his fingers.
I closed my laptop and turned towards the long form stretched out on the sofa.  “I can feel your eyes boring into my brain.”
I inhaled; it pushed us closer.  Soft skin brushed the curve of my back.  My next breath was deeper.
Charlie came closer.  Even in the flickering light, I could see his jacket pockets were bulging.  “We could plant some down by the clearing,” he said to Sherlock.  “Plenty will already be under the leaves around here.”
"Aidan, good morning.  Can the Natural History Museum do without you for a few hours?  I have something with many features of interest over at Bart's morgue," Sherlock said.
“Jim loves risks.  Helps relieve the boredom that plagues him.”
Heat spiked inside me, but the wind blew it away.  And then, there was the cool grasp of his hand at my hip and the chill press of his cock against the warmest part of me.  I shifted my feet and he slid coolly in.  I clenched against his cold firmness and a chill ran up my spine.  It wouldn’t last.  My heat would warm him.  I had done it many times.
“Show me how good your aim is.”   His glance returned to my eyes.  “With the bow,” he added softly, his eyes saying something more.
The words had not been spoken through clenched teeth.
I raised my eyebrows and shook my head.
“Why not the lights?” I set the harp on the floor and settled into my armchair.  There was a newspaper on the table next to it, but firelight wasn’t the best to read by.
I tried to look, but there was only shadow, the heat of his tongue and the weight of him pressing me into the warm earth suffused with the scent of lavender.
Sherlock stopped. John would have bumped into him but for his waving his arm behind him.  “We’ll have to go back over the bridge to the towpath to walk west.  Anyone trying to access her building from the east would either have to swim or jump across the three houseboats moored in the slip.”  Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the boats.  “Doable, but awkward and risky.  Judging by the water line, someone’s home on the middle one.”
The tambour player had found his rhythm.
“Disguise it, transform it, but use it.  There’s strength in it,” he replied, drawing himself up.  He held my eyes a moment and extended his hand with a flourish.

His hand was doing soft, playful things in my lap.
The voices grew louder; I did not detect his.  The laughter rose higher; I could not hear his.  There was the jingle and thump of a tambourine.
A minute ago, you wanted me to accept praise for it.
My fingers slowed as I plucked the opening bars and sang:
“You know I don’t like that kind of work,” Mycroft replied.
John noted the colour creeping past the edges of Ms Swann’s mask.
“Ah,” I murmured.
“Well, it was early days and you weren’t at your best after your Roman holiday.”  She giggled a bit at her little joke.
Without even glancing at Sherlock, John added, “Of course, I prefer curls.”
He was grinning.
"You're not joking?" I asked as I untied Sherlock.
“As a young child, I thought the swans on the river were sea dragons.  The bane of the oceans.  Clever pirates learned how to appease them.”
There were tears in John’s eyes and he thought of all the ways over the years he had seen Sherlock help and protect the wronged and the weak and the misunderstood.
“I imagine.”  I tried holding the dagger in each hand.  It fit well in both.
“Where the hell have you been?” I muttered.
“My focus was elsewhere,” I countered.
He came back in two with a dead speckled snake in a box.  He dissected it and analysed the venom.  Then he synthesised and concentrated it.
Mycroft gazed in his inimitable, imperturbable manner and the key turned and the lock clicked.
His eyes dropped to his violin.  “Not with words, no.”
The brook spilled into a glade, smaller than the meadow and flat.  In its centre, a massive oak tree grew.  The moon shone through its bare branches.  The stream disappeared beneath its roots.
The date and the month: the 20th day of March.  No year.
I eased into a sitting position.  I seemed not the worse for wear.
“Come in and close the door,” Sherlock stage whispered from the foot of the stairs.  “Mrs Hudson will be complaining that we’re letting all the heat out.”
Beside me Sherlock was silent.  He seemed to be listening or watching for something.  I knew not what, but I felt the tension of it and I listened, too, and scanned the horizon and the dark reaches of the parapet on either side of us.  We had been standing on it long enough for my toes to begin feeling numb, but I was not inclined to complain.  Sherlock had returned from his latest foray relatively unscathed and he had not disappeared again yet.
The ends of the hall closed.  The smoke thickened.
“You are keen,” Sherlock remarked, retreating to the hall chair, tea cup cradled in both hands.
I hadn’t seen the drop of blood on his finger, but I tasted it.  My eyes widened.
Eyes fixed on him, I lowered my chin and extended my hand a little further.  “Let’s show them, then.”
“You think this fellow might loiter about there, too?” John asked.  “While you were napping, I read about what a big deal it is to identify a new species.  Is it possible that that’s what this bloke is interested in rather than gaming industry secrets?”
In the sky, the edges of the sun glowed around the moon.
“We will meet you here between half five and six,” he called to the cabbie.
Sherlock put his forefinger next to mine.  My whole body registered it.  I withdrew, busied myself separating the vial and capping it.  “What do you want on the label?” I asked, reaching for the biro that was clipped to the front of my folder.
“It provided an entertaining topic of conversation for them.  No harm done,” I replied.
He said not a word, but signalled to Corvus’ driver, who pulled away from the kerb at his sign, then Holmes turned to usher me into the open door of the waiting hansom.  Before climbing in after me, he spoke to the cabbie.  The clop and clatter of the afternoon traffic kept me from distinguishing his meaning.
He had reached where she stood.
There was laughter.  Loud and joyous.
“Sherlock.”
“By all means.  I think we’ll both need the strength.”
John re-filled the kettle, switched it on and studied the plate of sweets in the middle of the table.  They were decorated with either blue eyes and red buttons or red eyes and blue buttons.
The face was Sherlock’s, just as it had been in the video.
Sherlock put a hand on my shoulder as Chapalu stepped into the torchlight, a huge, grey wolf clamped in her jaws.  She dropped the limp body at Sherlock’s feet and disappeared back under the trees.  A moment later another lifeless form was dropped on top of the first.  She sat up beside her kill.
“No,” John said and grabbed Sherlock’s shoulders, held him upright.  “Not yet.  I can wait for that pleasure.  Be patient.”
“You wouldn’t have needed to,” I grumbled.  “A few good photographs would have been sufficient...”  My voice trailed off.  They hadn’t appeared to be sufficient when one of them was placed in the hands of Madame Willow, the renowned medium.  The thought had crossed my mind at the time, that perhaps it should have been the glue pot.
Wide-eyed, I looked down at him and sang ever more softly:
“At least she didn’t mention the cards.”
"There wasn't much on it," I said.
The notion of venturing up to the roof for another look despite the weather resurfaced in my brain.
John shook his head.  “I won’t say no, Angelo.”
Puck swallowed.  “Yes, sire.”
I whipped back around, pulling Kit between Sherlock and me.
Sherlock nodded, folded his legs underneath himself and looked at John.  “You remember I told you of my dog, well, Mycroft’s and my dog, Redbeard?”
I sampled a bit of salad.  “Oh, that is lovely,” I murmured as the flavour of the dressing on the greens suffused my mouth.
From the gallery, a gentle melody floated, all strings and woodwinds.
Mrs Hudson was stood at the bottom of the staircase, hat and coat still on.
John flushed and turned towards him.  “Sorry,” he said.
“Oh, John,” he breathed.  “The other blood would have been fine.”
The music poured from the gallery.
The air whistled past the wings.  John felt his heart thumping against the warm back.  He tightened the hold of his legs and his arms, lowered his head and brushed his lips along the straining sinews of Sherlock’s neck.
“No, and Mum, a paralegal in the City, was making sure this didn’t turn into one,” Lestrade said, nodding.  “The older boy described the chittering as being like words.  That whatever was up under the bridge was calling his name.”
Two silhouettes appeared on the shades over Ms Swann’s bedroom windows, the man still with his cap on.  Ms Swann pushed it up and back until it fell down his back.  Her hand dropped to his shoulder.  She raised her other hand and rested it on his cheek.  They stood like that for a moment or two, then slowly leaned towards one another.  Ms Swann's arms folded around the man’s neck.  She kissed him.
Sherlock led us in, long fingers wrapped firmly around my arm as we slid deeper into the thrum of conversation and song.
I took a step towards Sherlock and stood very straight.  The closer I am, the taller he seems, but the difference was less pronounced at that moment.  The shoes didn’t have heels; they were more of a glove or a leather sock with ties, but there was a pressure beneath my arches which brought to mind the way Sherlock massages my feet when he feels he has dragged me through London rather longer than my mortal bones can withstand.
My friends and I might have been guilty of augmenting the mythos a bit, passing it on to new pupils at school.  I had even written down a scary story about a beautiful ghost and a lovelorn lad in the back of one of my history notebooks.  Maybe everyone loves to spin a yarn.
“The river is very protective of the manor,” she replied.
We were alone.  I looked down.  His eyes were focussed on me.  Electric blue.
The box of cards sits on my nightstand.
Sherlock’s camera clicked.  “He’s rather magnificent rearing up like that.  The ones on the river near our house would do that if anyone came close to their nest.”
I shook my head slightly.  Whatever grains of truth might reside in the legends must be the echoes of some eccentric forebears.
“You’ve been discarding strategies that posed too great a risk to me,” I continued.  “You think someone might break the rules and attack before we can dance the dance that could foil them all.”
Suddenly, Baskerville jumped away from the beast with the stick clamped between his teeth.
I did not take offense at being likened to a goat or a sheep because the idea that I was being called home appealed to me.
I set it down on the corner of the table and stood regarding Sherlock.  His hair was sticking up in various directions and there was a crease from the seam of a pillow running across one of his cheeks.  Ah, the sleep of angels!
“Someone claiming to be a long-lost relative appearing on the scene?” I wondered aloud.
It’s I who is holding onto his.
We were on the east side of the Manor, an orientation which the sinking moon behind us allowed me to identify.  I was surprised I had the presence of mind to take note of it.
Mrs Hudson’s gaze was on me.  “This does not have juniper in it.  You should keep track of what you perceive as well.”
“I thought you had a headache,” he mused and closed his cool lips over mine.
“Thirty-five, set designer at Shakespeare’s Globe for the last three years, worked in Bayreuth for five years before that and in Edinburgh for six after finishing university there.  Has a studio flat this side of the river two developments east of here and a German boyfriend who visits every couple months for a week or so.  Employers happy with her work, not so happy to be woken in the middle of the night to tell me about it,” he said and handed Sherlock his mobile.  “Have a look at that.”
The swan’s feathers seemed to be folding in against the wing bones.  The swan appeared broader with each passing second.  One hand grasped the top of the railing, another was splayed against the brick of the building’s wall.  A leg clothed in feathery trousers was raised, a shod foot wedged between the bottom strut of the railing and the floor of the balcony.
A man couldn’t help smiling at a statement like that, but I covered up the frolicking simulacra nonetheless because their antics were getting wilder than I thought I could view and remain scientific.
Blood.
"With nary a pause, they had come.  Mostly women, but sometimes men.  They’d knelt before me and I’d gazed into their faces, hoping with each new one that it would be my moonbeam, but it never was.  Then, I’d looked up and the dancer was beside me, but he was not alone.”
Holmes finally bestirred himself and stretched out his hand.  I handed over the notebook.  He would, no doubt, read more from the smudges and ink blots than from the words on the pages.
In the event that at the time of my death any Ward for whom I have the power to appoint a Successor Guardian shall not have attained the age of twenty-one years, then and in that event, I name, constitute and appoint my only sister, Madeline Anabel Lenore Usher, as Successor Guardian of the Person of said Ward or Wards, with all the powers, duties, privileges and liabilities of a Guardian under the Laws of England and Wales.
He’s a cheeky bastard, is Wiggins.
“Nothing left?”  I asked.  There was a scratch on his cheek.  I heard him wince.
“Ahead is a barren islet, the last land before the sea tumbles over the edge of the world.  If, instead of turning back to the night now, we fly on and land there, the dawn will come upon us soon after.  If you choose to look upon my true form in that place, you will be bound to me as inextricably as I to you, and from that bond there will be no release for either of us.”
“This is what I should have done that night,” he said.
"Of course," I chuckled.  "So, after you got that HR confirmation and strode off to the stairs, did you realise we were all trailing after you like you were the Pied Piper?  You barely looked up from your phone.”
She pointed north.  “The Tyburn branches about where the boating lake is now, one stream flowing to the east and the other to the west of the house and reuniting a little south of us.”
I followed Sherlock onto the landing and up the steps.
The door to the passageway opened and Mrs Turner led the waiting guests into the dark, the sound of their progress silenced as they passed into it.  Last of all, Mrs Hudson waved Kit and Midnight along ahead of her.  She winked at me before she followed them into the shadows.  She’d told me once that a good host never loses a guest.  I smiled at the memory as the panel closed behind them.  All signs of their presence erased.
“Can you bring it back here, dear?  I’m up to my elbows in flour.”
Mrs Hudson looked over her shoulder.  “Could you pour me a half cup?  The dough’s just ready for it.”  She lifted her chin at the counter and John spotted the purple cup with the floury handle.
“Assuredly.”
I remained staring at the point where it had disappeared from sight.
I won’t deny a wave of gratification.
He bounded a few metres away and turned, tail wagging.
“You’re not going to stop them?” I asked, bending one leg and then the other to see if the blood was flowing properly through them.
“If my mother had stayed, she would have tutored him.”  Molly shook her head.  “He wasn’t strong enough when he and his brother first arrived.  Neither of them were.”
He waved a few fingers airily in John’s direction.
I had noticed that the violin no longer accompanied the harp.  I glanced around the room and found Sherlock joining Greg.
Caution.
“True enough.”
She tapped a gilt covered dish. I wanted to make it last night, but Mrs Turner prevailed upon me to tackle it with all my faculties intact.
Siròc landed on my shoe and dropped my phone between my legs.  She fixed an eye on me from her perch then fluttered towards Baskerville.
“The minstrel boy to the war has gone,
“Mainly,” he replied.  “One was a boot.”
“I interrupted his attempt, but upon reflection, I don’t think it could have worked even if I hadn’t intervened.”  Sherlock glanced at Mycroft’s feet and one side of his mouth lifted slightly.
“I can keep that on my desk, if you’d like to check upstairs,” the shopkeeper said, reaching for the plant.
“They don’t waste surgeon’s time on the dead,” he said, “but in a morgue it can be a factor.”  His lips curved upwards slightly on the final words.
Would this parasitic heart I had created have sharp points, like claws, at the tip of its mobile veins and arteries, to slice open the skin and slip beneath it, or did the skin open to it once it was near?  How would that mechanism work?  A chemical cue of some sort?  I watched and read science fiction; I could extrapolate from this unusual premise my mind had directed my hand to invent.
Sometime during the preceding few hours I had surmounted my difficulty with calling him that.  It had probably been the roof jumping that did it, although it may have been when I got the suspect we were pursuing in a choke hold and pinched a nerve in his arm before he could aim his gun at my new employer.
When I reached the bottom, Sherlock already had one foot in the skiff bobbing at its moorings there.  He continued as though he were simply walking along the stones and, once he was aboard, swayed gracefully in time with the water slapping at the stone landing.  He held the torch higher then to light my way.
Pretty much.
“Well, your leg’s got better; that’s a fine thing,” she said.
John had curled about him, held him in his arms.  It was probably best not to bind John up, no matter how safe and delicious he would be.  His embraces were sweeter, warmer; savoury, too.
“As an early morning swim.  Come, walk with me.”
"He may have some broken ribs," I said, catching the line and knotting it around the closer end of the rope securing Sherlock to the bench.  "Guards at the Tower let the lights go out?"
“She told me about two trips you took to Afghanistan a couple years ago,” I said.
“Not hellish enough,” I muttered.
The sounds were always sweet, none of the squawks and screeches with which novice woodwind players are more familiar than they would like to be.  As a boy, I had been banned from playing my tin whistle in the house, so out in the garden or down the street I had gone.  In addition to my discordant mistakes, the whistle had often played my complaints or other things I didn't say aloud.
“Yes, of course.  So, there we were and Mary was setting your photograph on that table.  I couldn’t see it because the frame was face down, but I knew which one it was – a profile where you’re looking a little upwards, a slight truculence in your expression.”
Sherlock said not a word.
I was an interesting specimen.  My flush grew hotter.
Sherlock remained with his head next to mine until I held out a handful of cut plants.  He took them and sat up.
"Not the donkey?" Lestrade asked.
I waited.
I pulled the breath out of him with a long, slow glide.  “I do so hate to rush.”  I smiled in the dark when I was seated on his thighs.
“Lestrade!” Sherlock shouted.
Midnight hissed.  Kit switched his torch into his left hand and walked closer to my side.
“Or a yak."  Holmes slid his eyes across to me. "No, a goat, I think.”
“No,” he said, “I don’t need a transfusion.”  He slid further under the blankets.
I had no clever comeback for that, but hoped it wasn’t true, because if somewhere, deep down, it was, Sherlock would know and he’d never ask.
I held in every sound, did not allow even a hum to vibrate in my throat.  I felt his smile again.  Oh, to please him was a pleasure.
He pried the top sweet off, studied it a moment and put it in his mouth.  His eyebrows went up and I thought he might spit it out when he smiled and nodded at me.
“Blades used to be made of the stones just for that purpose.”
Twice Mr Braithewaite attempted conversation, first, to express his hope that the evening traffic would not impede our progress to his office near St Paul’s and when that garnered no replies, he said he was glad that the rain had held off and hoped that it would continue to do so until we were all safely home.  I gave him a nod each time, but as no one else made any sort of response, he turned his genial face towards the river.
“I already have,” Sherlock replied and lay back on the cushions, fingertips pressed together beneath his chin.
I was amazed.  And starving.
I was out in the hall before he had finished his sentence.
My circuit took me deeper into the crowd.  They parted.
He nodded slowly.  “I understand,” he replied solemnly.
He was very still.  It seemed as though his chest did not move.  He knows how to do that.  He knows I know he knows how to do that.
“You are a sweet man,” she said, blushing.
“Because of the sea that was here.  But that was long ago.”
I almost asked whether he was a psychiatrist, but his engagement was too intense, as though he were reading my mind.
My gaze wandered to it.  The youth with the winged sandals was missing from the seascape.  His sandals, and his cap, rested on the cushion in front of the window instead.
‘The road was a ribbon of moonlight over the purple moor…’  I hadn’t thought of that poem in years.
He shook his head against the cushion.  “Time isn’t the issue.  What’s on our skin needs to stay there.”
“And the jester?  Why does he want to ‘woo’ you?”
“And every year they burn?”
Long, low notes snaked through the opening.  A shard of light from the hallway illuminated a wooden floor in need of varnishing, the corner of a frayed red carpet.  Everything above the floor was dark.
I was about to say that I could barely see the door from where I stood when the oil lamps either side of the door ignited.
“Are you closer?  What can I do?”
The question hung in my mind.  Was I?
“Sherlock,” I said.
There are things he can do with his voice that I attribute to his musical training.  Vibrating like a plucked string, I drew out a chair, sat myself at his table and separated the contents of the envelope.
The dim interior gleamed with a thousand small reflections.
“Right.”
“Perhaps,” Corvus agreed.  “He was not pleased to learn that it would be some time before Roderick’s and Madeline’s wills could be probated, and he could receive the items of jewellery that they had left to him.”
My head lolled against the window casement.  Each time I blinked, my eyes stayed closed longer.  Opposite me, Sherlock leaned his elbows upon the window sill, his face turned towards the terrace, a plate nearly empty of food I hadn’t seen him eat balanced on his lap.  I had, perhaps, kept my eyes closed longer than I had thought.
How can a voice smirk?
The doors opened.
“The antlers in the library?” I asked.
Sable wings opened and closed.  Six feet clung to the edge of the brick.  Two antennae felt the vibrations upon the breeze.
The song resumed.
The bites stopped.  No wings or fragile legs stepped over his skin.
Sherlock murmured something.
My mouth opened with a question, but Sherlock spoke first.  “We’re here,” he said and a few more steps brought us into a glade full of people.
‘Tis true.  I have.
(See the end of the chapter for
Mrs Hudson had left us to rendezvous in Bath with her sister, Lily, and her neice, Flora, for a holiday of sight-seeing for the younger generation and reminiscing for the older.  Mrs Hudson had begun rehearsing her tales with me and by the time she departed I felt I knew more about her family than I did about my own.  In her absence, Mrs Turner had served us one sumptuous meal after another, but Baskerville had had to remind whoever he could find that he needed his nightly constitutional.  I was rather chuffed that after only four days, he had come to me.  I chose to ignore the fact I had gleaned about Wiggins having been sent out of town.
"And so?" Lestrade coaxed.
I dropped my feet to the floor and managed to lift my head without keeling over.  “Debut?” I echoed, which wasn’t at all what I had intended to come out of my mouth.
It wasn’t a blatant place for me to sit because
“Long ago,” he whispered.
He was staring at the grass we had flattened.
“Ah, well, Henri will no doubt expand on that topic when we have supper with him after the concert.  You two share a tendency to romanticise mundane processes, like hearing a bit of a melody and using it to write a symphony.”
Mrs Hudson wagged a forefinger.  “That’s not her theory.  She’s convinced that he didn’t just write about time machines, but actually had one, so it would have been with him when he lived on Baker Street and instead of popping down to the newsagent for his morning paper, he’d pop into his time machine and go back to whatever date interested him and buy his newspapers there.”  Mrs Hudson folded her hands in front of her.  “She’s very pleased with that theory.
“I’m listening,” John said softly and understood that he had not always been as patient as one needed to be with wild things.
“I don’t need much,” he said and his teeth were clenched as he spoke.
“What did you think?” Sherlock asked once we had closed the door behind us.
There was movement in the dark and an earthenware mug was set before me and a bowl of stew with a spoon already in it next to that.
I glanced about.
We meandered along.  I named the birds we heard or saw as best I could:  ducks, geese, grebes, coots and two regal, jet black swans on the water; robins, doves, magpies, crows, finches, sparrows and tits among the trees.
Heights do not trouble me.  Open-bayed helicopters and jumps from aeroplanes have not been a problem.
“I could.  I observe more than most people,” he said, untwining his fingers and pressing their tips together in front of his lips.  “I have enough information to make my decision.”
“But afterwards, I should have figured it out.”
I nodded and continued on:
The air grew colder.
“I did as a child.  Who knows when a relapse might occur.”
I shifted my eyes to the left.  The dot was also moving.  Northeast.
I reached for one, my mouth already watering.
Effective move then, because I am distracted.  All those moments he had that can never be mine.
I woke up on the floor, well, on the hearthstone actually, although there were cushions beneath me again.  My clothes were absent, except for my shoes, which were keeping my feet nice and warm and my shirt, which was draped over my side.  On the flags of the fireplace, a mound of the pearly stones was glowing in white light bright enough to show where there had once been a bas-relief of robed figures carved into the stone walls of the firebox.  I wanted to lean forward and peer up the chimney, but I didn’t have the strength.  I thought I’d find the moon shining directly down it.  One of those really bright full moons that come at perigee.  I stretched out my hand instead and touched the nearest stone.  It felt pliant, like a ripe fruit and the light felt cool and pleasant on my skin. I closed my eyes again.
I drew in a breath.  “Speaking of telling, Mrs Hudson…”
“Yes.  Keep beating.  For me.  Keep beating for me.”  I opened my eyes, pushed the matted hair off his brow, rolled him onto his back.
Her use of the past tense confused me.
Sherlock stood.  “John’s a man of many talents, Lestrade.  Let me show you.”
It’s not what he asked.
Sherlock is asleep now.  Another case concluded.  Happy client sent on her way.  Payment already in the account.  I checked.  And I wrote up the case.  I don’t usually do that so quickly, but it was one of those cases that are incredibly simple for Sherlock to solve and seem like magic to everyone else.  Even me, after he’s explained it and it appears as clear as day, I feel the magic of that clarity appearing where only murk and confusion existed before.  I wanted to catch that feeling in words while it was fresh.  His mind is such a beautiful thing to watch at work.  But it’s asleep now.  So I wrote up the case.  Not just a rough draft, but a finished version.  Revised it, proofread it, posted it.  No one has commented yet.
The little boy stopped to stare, clapping his hands in delight and the older boy closed his arms around him and brought him back to the fireside.
John picked it up.  Such a small thing.  Thin.  Light.  A perfect circle waiting inside.
“John, look up!  Through the trees.”
Not quite that exciting, I hope.
I raised my free hand and waved it about a bit.  “But this tree is hundreds of years old.”
I looked about the room.  There were long, cushioned seats running the length of the outer wall.  I wondered if they contained equipment as the bench in the music room had concealed the harp.
“As soon as the last parts of the design are finished, we’ll try.  And if we succeed, I’ll slow down your wheels within wheels.”
“John?”
John backed away from the window, the moonlight full upon him.  More than his hand was shaking.  “New nightmares,” he groaned, eyes darting around his room.  “Don’t infect this place.  Leave the blood on the sand.”  His leg buckled.  He stumbled, reached out for the casement and sagged against the wall next to it, panting.
“That’s why she was so clever, John.  Basements are where people are unclogging sewage drains and checking gas pipes, storing and shifting crates and tanks.  She chose up here.  Less disruption.”  His light played over the beams and pulleys, ropes and shelves.  “There,” he said and dashed across the floor, grabbing a burlap sack from atop a pile of rough woven cloth on his way.  “Shine your light up here,” he said as he climbed onto a thick coil of rope.
She put her hand on his shoulder.  “I know.  He was thinking with his heart and it saved you both.”  She rose on her toes and whispered something to Sherlock I couldn’t hear.
“It wants the stones back.”
“I had a hunch that might be their relationship when I watched them in the park, after I got past the fear that she was going to have Baskerville for supper," I said as the door swung open along a deep groove in the stone floor. “So why doesn't she want Baskerville to go to her hunting grounds with her?”
“Since last year,” Molly quipped and picked another titbit from her plate.  “We had boar earlier.”
I didn’t step on his feet again.
She nudged my pipes aside and set her burden down on the coffee table.  “Tea?” she asked, looking up at me.   “Oh, I see.  Mid-summer was it?”  She winked.
Sherlock stood, his arm raised, beckoning me, his skin gold in the evening sun.
He seemed aware of my homicidal intentions and his eyes gleamed at me.
Sherlock was silent.
Sherlock’s life is endangered and John is ready to do whatever is necessary to save him.
The insect hovered among the branches above the bed, settled on John’s shoulder when he sat and moistened the reed.
It did, but instead of flushing at the possibility that they might disapprove, I’d grown colder.
“She had a whole story brewing by the end of the evening, with Mr Wells being friends with someone from Chalfont Court and asking them to store the carton for him when he left.”
All right.  It does have something to do with sleeping with Sherlock.  That intimacy is a gift.  It can’t be demanded and neither can his knowledge.  He shares things in his own time and in his own way.
Poetry now, is it?  I have no intention of offending him.
The child let go of his mother’s hand and clapped his together, then with a quick glance up at her, he ran straight at the flames.  He clambered up the burning lattice of branches and when he reached the top he turned around and sat on the edge and waved to his mother.
It made me want to hurry out of the empty hall.
The bubbles stopped mid-circuit.
John stuck his head out the door to check whether anyone seemed to be loitering in the vicinity, even though a pronoun wasn’t much of a description to be going on with.  Seeing no one lingering who fit the description, he shut the door firmly and waited a moment before following Ms Swann.
“Well, look at the poor sod.  He doesn’t stand a chance against those grand birds.  They give him a good nip if he tries to get in the water.”
“Brother, dear.”
“They are taking their seats,” Sherlock said.  “We will be expected shortly.”
“Where did you get a photograph of me?”
“She had recently been pregnant,” Molly stated.
I opened my eyes and looked up at him, grateful for his grip on my arms.
“Fair enough.  I’ll go get them,” I said and nipped out to the hall.
I pulled myself higher and pushed him onto his back.  The urge to bite into the muscles of his neck was strong, but I restrained myself and merely nibbled along the length of his throat and nipped at his ear.
“That clinches it.  Not too many blokes with hair as glorious as that,” John said.
“Can you tell who?”
Animals adopt orphans sometimes.
“I’ve never been this way,” John remarked.
Mrs Hudson ducked inside.  “That was the marvellous thing.  I let the flat today and he took it ‘as is’.  I can hardly believe it.”
She smiled.  “Good.  I’ve got sweets cooling in the kitchen that I need to dip again when we get back.  Sherlock is partial to the ginger ones, but I varied the recipe for you.”
“Will I be able to fly?” John asked.
I grabbed a pencil and jotted this down in my notebook.
Sherlock stood framed in the doorway, shoulders back, arms back, hands twisting, fingers fanning.
I looked away.  “I saw a place.  A wood.”
I took it from him.  It was heavy.  I opened it and drank.  It was full.  “That’s useful,” I remarked and handed it back.
“Stand.”
“You grew up locally.  You’ve heard the stories,” he said.
I gazed out over the people clustered in groups, their faces ruddy in the light of their fires.  I squinted into the wavering glow.  Here and there, I saw cheeks as pallid as Sherlock’s.  I frowned, my eyes darting between those I could see.  None were talking or singing or eating.  Indeed, they were all very still.
My hand pressed against the moon blade under my clothes.
I strode to the desk, still not bothering with the sash of my dressing gown.  I’ve never felt self-conscious in a locker room and I wasn’t going to start now in my own bedroom.  The envelope was sealed and the writing looked like Sherlock’s, the kind he used to label anatomical diagrams or write out chemical formulae.  It was sealed with silvery wax and stamped with an ‘H’.  I was using a knife from the breakfast tray to slit the envelope open when I felt hands at my collar.
It was spring and summer and autumn and winter.  I suckled and bit and gulped.
“I didn’t.  I said I’d deleted them accidentally.”
“Closed pocket doors facing the windows, the door through which we had entered, which faced the fireplace, and a door next to the windows through which our hostess arrived just before her absence became too awkward.”
"Do you ever bring her hunting with you?" I asked as we crossed the lab.
Both my eyes opened.  I even lifted my head.  That was definitely what was written on the paper around the small box.  I ripped it off, opened the box.  There were rubbers inside.  Ten maybe.  All different sizes and shapes, one like a pencil, one like a biro and in the corner a small metal pencil sharpener.
“I should be honoured if you would stay, John Hamish Watson,” he said.
Evening Standard
The hand was withdrawn.
“There,” he said, rising to his full height once more and grabbing my elbow to swing me around.  “Quickly now.  I want to arrive before Lestrade does.”
I continued staring up at him, thought of when I’d spotted him by the light of the full moon on a rooftop in Brixton.  He was the solver of mysteries, not me, and yet, because I had been scrutinising them for hours, I did have a theory.
There was a ruffling of feathers.
For the second time that evening, my eyes opened wide.
John watched until Alan had turned into the stairwell, then closed the door and leaned back against it.  “He couldn’t know, could he?”
I had rather thought she might avert them in matronly modesty, because every court card had borne an uncanny resemblance to a regal Sherlock with royal robes that covered less and less of him the more cards I had turned over.
“Check,” Sherlock said and the fine, deep voice had a quaver to it.
Sherlock held out his hand.
He let a leg slip off the bed, pushed up into that firm hand when he had a foot on the floor.  The pressure increased, his back bowed and his wail told of a different feeling.
“Far more,” Sherlock agreed.
“Conflicting sensory input,” I said.  “That’s what causes the queasy feeling.”
“I suppose it was.”  I stood up.  “Coffee?”
Barricade.
I would show him what John Watson could do with a firearm when we made our way there.
I crouched down and found one of the places where the branches grew from the polished wood at the base of the spindles.
I reached up with a hand and Molly bent down to shake it.
Sherlock chuckled.  “It’s the Joy.”
“I didn’t know, but if you stayed, I thought I might find out.”
“Let’s not go swimming just yet,” he said.  “Lie down…”
I smiled.
“But there was only the faintest gleam of water visible in the distance from up there.”  I gestured towards the terrace steps.  “No wide river.  No landing.  No terrace.”
The tea cup rattled against the saucer in Corvus’ hand.  He set it aside and reached again into his jacket, this time taking out an envelope.
“Siròc told me you were here,” he said.  “She thought you were in danger.”  He patted the falcon and it took wing.
His head jerked up, his eyes wide.  They flashed over me, stopped at the unbuttoned cuff of my shirt, the dot of blood on my sleeve.
Eventually, we thought about food.  At least I did.
“Anything noteworthy?” John asked.
It seemed the time to kneel, so I did.  Got down on one knee facing him, as if I knew exactly what I was doing and that had been the signal to do it.
I shook my head.  “Nothing,” I murmured.
“Mrs Hudson is fond of baking.  She has Mrs Turner to help with much of the cooking,” he replied.
“It’s wood...or glass, I suppose.  A box or a jar filled with sand.  I don’t know,” I replied.  “I liked the heft of it.”
I checked his face again.  There was a smudge of clay across his cheek bone.  It made his eyes brighter.  I reached out and tried to wipe it away.  Instead, it smeared.
“Precisely,” Sherlock said.
Nor burst into flames.
“Are you tasting me?” John asked.  The vest began to slip off his arm.  He let it fall.  “Shouldn’t I introduce myself first?”
I gripped the root again.  “It doesn’t hurt?”
“You’re sure they’re the same person?” Sherlock asked.
Oh, god!
“Greg!” I yelled
A gust of wind blew through the open doors, its scent more of the seashore than of flowers.
Well, that was me done for several minutes.
His hand reached up and pushed me over.  He crawled atop me, panting.  “You know all the steps now.  They’re on your skin, in your blood.  All you must add, all you must surpass them at, is passion.”
Sherlock’s eyes narrowed, then he shook his head.  “Who’d believe him?”
My temperature shot up and I stared at my feet.  Given a choice, I would have preferred the latter.
“I tried getting up twice, but you just held on tighter.”
“I doubt the amount of time surprised him,” Sherlock said.  “He’s had to wait a year for their mother’s bequest.”
Not arguing with you there.
He leaned across me and took another piece of apple.
Must not like Fucker.
She was gazing towards the twilit windows and she didn’t turn towards them when she spoke.  “Dark,” she whispered, “like a shadow on the sunlit pavement.”  She remembered her guests and turned their way.  “It was hot in the sun that day, and there’s no shade near the pond.  I was annoyed at myself for not thinking to bring a hat and at the swan for sailing off.  There was a slight breeze that kept blowing my hair into my face, which annoyed me further, but I didn’t want to leave before using up the food I’d brought.  I’d raised my hand to block the sun and was scanning the circumference of the pond for my wayward bird, when I saw the man, standing at the water’s edge like a cool shadow.  As I watched, he turned towards me and smiled.”  Her voice had trailed off.
“Yes, likewise,” I replied, but Mrs Hudson had already turned her away.
Sherlock moved his arm, pointing further east.  “And there.”
“I have already chosen him, Sherlock,” Mycroft said, lips pressed together once the last syllable issued forth.
“The feather is a reasonable start,” Mycroft said.  “When did they begin coming in?”
Yeah, it would.
I turned back to the window.  “I don’t recall this last year.  Were we away?”  I leaned out.  The breeze was sharp.  The sound of bells louder.
“You’re not going to pour it on me, are you?” Mike asked, sliding his empty glass slowly towards John.
I yawned, and despite my outrage, my eyes were closing.  “Your troops are well-trained,” I murmured and let go of consciousness again.
Sherlock stood, bow raised, and nodded to Molly.  Her fingers skimmed over the harp’s strings and she began to sing, “Up the airy mountain, down the rushy glen, we daren’t go a-hunting for fear of little men.”
“Why do they care whether one of us is lured away from the other?”
The napkins fell to the floor.
I edged around the table littered with the remains of our meal and strode to the windows.  Brass rings rattled as I shut the world away.
I didn’t turn my eyes away and instead of the barely audible hum that I’d come to use, I sang it.  I’ve played the notes, whistled them, hummed them both loudly and quietly, but I have never given them full-throated voice.
The boatman manoeuvred us towards the shore.
The little boy and his mother were walking quickly towards their companions.   “Her friends don’t seem that surprised.”
John’s hold finally slackened.
As the man came abreast of the women, the honking of the geese sounded across the water.  The pigeons rose in a cloud from around the women’s feet and the swans began flapping their long, white wings and rising out of the water.
It was a long day and now we’re nearly into the next one.
I hesitated to name myself his lover; it sounded so bold to claim the title, despite all we had done…
“Only a bit,” he emphasised, reaching over his head and scooping up both bands.  “Enough so we don’t chafe wearing these, no more.”
It was a silent three miles to Baker Street.  From time to time, I checked the side of the hansom where Holmes lounged, staring out the window.  After giving the driver our address, he had said not a word, although his hand had sometimes risen slightly from its resting place upon his thigh, fingers swaying back and forth as though he were conducting music.
She lifted it up.  “Oh, isn’t that pretty!” she exclaimed, running a fingertip along the strip at the top.  “Surely, Sherlock can pick the lock for you.”
“Step here,” Sherlock said.
I didn't step on any other sharp objects as we followed the path between the tall grass and wild flowers by the water, and the trees and brush of the woods.  Amidst the latter, Sherlock had been foraging, and when he delved further in amongst the brambles, I would lean against the nearest tree and play.
“How’s he doing it?” John asked.  “He douse himself in eau de Great Dane or something?”
Above the northern woods, the sky rippled.  Between the trees, a hint of rose outlined the bare branches
“And I found two people as serene as bereaved parents could be.”
And I’m going to try my worst to keep it so.
“Evening, John.”
“I knew how it fared with you after that,” Sherlock said.
I looked down my body.  One part of me, clearly did not feel fatigued.
Midnight leapt off Kit’s shoulder and walked along the trunk, sniffing.
I chased the afterimage.  To do otherwise would be to be left in the dark.
I peered down my chest.  I couldn’t see much.  The candles must have burnt out because the only light in the room was a faint one emanating from the fireplace.  I tried glancing to the side without moving my head.  It wasn’t ideal.  The moon had left its perfect alignment with the chimney and the dim glow that remained looked to be from the pile of stones.  I wasn’t sure how that could be.
The moth walked to John’s wrist and swept his antennae across the skin there.  It tickled.
“You ran out of spunk.”
Free association is an interesting thing, but I pushed it aside and focussed on medical considerations.  Having only met him and Mrs Hudson, I did not think health care would take up much of my time, although either of them might be suffering from conditions that were not obvious and there were the signs of osteoarthritis I had already noted in Mrs Hudson’s hand.  I would need to review their medical histories and run some tests of my own, but filling the time when I wasn’t needed as a physician by assisting Mr Holmes with research or experimentation had a strong appeal.
The man swatted the horse’s hindquarters.  The woman smiled down at him, as she dug in her heels.  The horse reared up then took off at a gallop.

The night he thought he had seen a man fall from a roof and not hit the ground, he had dreamt of the butterflies.
His hands closed about my forearms, pulling me to my feet with such force I collided with him.  It knocked the wind out of me.  He held me long enough for me to feel his cock firm against my stomach.  “We must take cover," he whispered, "if I am to keep my promise to you.  There are others abroad tonight who might like to have you, too.”
“We have three days to raise your game then.”
I caught a glimpse of a smile as Sherlock whirled away, grabbing his dressing gown from the back of the bedroom door as he went.  “Come,” he said from the hall.  The sound of his rapid descent echoed up the stairs.
Mycroft smiled.  “Thus, if you could locate the box as expeditiously as possible, we will learn what further steps to take.”
I never would.
Chapter 4 prompt: #13 (Storm).
I picked up the largest circlet.  As I held it up to the light, it fell open; the coiled tail of a serpent unlatching from the red enamelled tongue protruding from the serpent’s gaping jaws.  Red-clawed forelegs were drawn up close to the head.  Scales were etched into the narrow body.  Folded wings thickened the middle portion of the body, each plume delineated with precision.  It was a three-dimensional version of the creature on my harp.  It looked ready to take flight.
Just because two things happen at the same time, doesn’t mean one caused the other.
I complied and opened my eyes, but feigned an interest in my final disrobing rather than meet Sherlock’s penetrating glance.
Wiggins held a stout stick to the small fire beside him.  Its end took light.  He took it out and offered it to me.
"That puzzle is yet to be solved," Sherlock said, "and there may be another."
Then, I heard what I thought was a lark and tried to imitate the notes of its song.
“A bit like gambling,” he murmured.
The section I was reading was a long one, covering fractures of both mundane and supernatural origin and their complications.  The piece of music at the end covered two pages with cramped notation.  I began to hum, then thought better of it.  My harp would yield more precise tones.  A quick glance about revealed no harp, which puzzled me until I recalled that it was next to my bed, where I’d set it aside once Sherlock had fallen asleep as the sky brightened to a lighter grey with the dawn.
Keeping it that way will be harder at Westbourne Park.  I’ll be at the entrance to her building at five. SH
He ran up the stairs.
John grinned, locked his legs behind Sherlock’s back and rolled them onto their sides.  “First one way,” he said, pressing their cocks together and nipping at the plump bottom lip he loved so well.  “And then the other.”
I drew a breath to continue and Holmes raised a finger.
His lips quirked up at one side.  “Better,” he said.
I don’t have much of anything with me.
they are ready, bring them to John’s room.”  Sherlock said and turned away, dismissing Wiggins with a flick of his fingers.
“I am sorry for the pain this will cause you,” he said.  “I should have anticipated your response.”  He took his feet off the chair.  “Sit, John,” he said, reaching inside his jacket.  "You’re going to be needing this more than I will.”  He extracted a slim, leather case from his jacket; unsnapped its fastenings.  Wedged in the blue silk lining was a syringe and two ampules.  A space for a third was empty.
I hummed attentively and took a forkful of peas.
“Not too cold,” he murmured drowsily.  “No need to warm me…”  He turned over, scowled and cupped my face in his hands.  “You’re hot.”
“A bit of everything,” the shopkeeper replied.  “Down here we have most of the books and prints and the furniture.  Up there, everything else.”
It was my turn to raise my brows.
Let the portcullis fall.”—
“But he did, just after he came back from his time in the Army.  I remember being confused when Mama and Papa told me over dinner one night that we were going to live in Bath because I thought it strange that we would leave our nice rooms off the courtyard to live in the hammam.”
Molly was nearly scarlet, but her smile was radiant.
I chuckled.  Whatever that might be here.
“I wished to be anywhere else once,” I said.
matters, as they referred to them, was paying off as was my keeping detailed notes of everything I had observed and everything Sherlock had observed and the deductions to which they had led him.  The gap between what I saw and what he did was large, but I felt it was diminishing with each new case.
I paused when Mrs Hudson arrived with the tea tray and little Martha followed with sandwiches and cakes and fruit.  All was arranged at our elbows.
The admiration in Sherlock's expression when he had handed my knife back to me at the dock may have been contributing to my sense of well-being.
I reached for it and laid it aside on the desk.
A flurry of shots broke through the song.  A score of feet trampled the underbrush.
As though I had punctured its sphere, the crimson haze leaked away.  I let out a long breath and looked at him.
“Always,” I whispered, “from danger and the jagged edge of doubt.”
John emerged from the bathroom rubbing a towel across his chest.  It was not easy to dry off in a wet room that tiny.  He held the ends of the towel with both hands and dried his back.  He opened the wardrobe, bent down to pull a vest out of a drawer with one hand, running the towel over his damp hair with the other.
In the manner he had taught me, I set mine in his.  His fingers closed around it and he brought me near again.  “Think of the steps like a melody that is playing when we are together.  Feel which way I move and come after me.”  He clasped my hand more firmly and I felt the rings on his fingers.  “It’s a spell for two.  We need to survive the other dances…
“We out-danced them,” he said.
John stood.
“Yes and yes,” John replied.  “I’ll have to do more research.  I’ve been reading about human genetic medicine not veterinary medicine.”
I had forgotten that our journey must end in a bridge of some sort.
John felt queasy.  “What did they do next?” he whispered.
He smiled one of his dangerous smiles.  In a blur of motion, he was off the bed and across the room, me and a pillow or two clasped in his arms as he stepped out onto the balcony.
“Aren’t those dead?” I asked.
I considered sitting, but my head didn’t feel ready for it.  “That’s good, since we don’t have a week to spare.”  I rolled onto my side facing him and propped myself up on an elbow, although I didn’t think the elbow part was going to last.  “How long have I been asleep?”
I tucked my fingers between the pillow and his back, pulling his vest higher as I did.  “Yeah, I suppose that’s where the idea came from, although he’d died before I finished university, so he never knew I actually did it.”
The hallway was not on the other side.
I slipped the moon blade into my belt.  I wasn’t going to risk its being contaminated by his foul blood.
In a grove of trees, shadows moved, whispering and laughing.  Against one tree a tall, pale figure leaned.  He glanced at me, his eyes gleaming with a light of their own.  I reached for him, but I was too far away to touch.  Behind him, a taller figure coalesced from the gloom, glittering of eye, broad of shoulder and cloven of hoof.  He closed his arms around my tall, pale beauty and turned him to face the tree.
The music stopped.
“Ideas, no.  Flesh, yes.  The fever has almost consumed him.  He is on my doorstep,” Mycroft answered, dipping his fingers in the water so that a new image appeared.
“That took you a while.”
There was that small upturn at one corner of his mouth.  “Would you like to go deeper?” he asked.
“A warmer place?” I asked hopefully.
“I’ve seen those, here and there,” Sherlock said.
It was a fair point.  I could take a moment to place my bet.
"People from the National Antiquities Museum came to collect it.  They were extremely excited," she said.
John chuckled and loosened his hold.  “That, you already know.  Lucky for me, it was one we could manage in our current condition.”  He ran his palms down Sherlock’s arms, paused with them splayed on Sherlock’s thighs.
Discordant notes fell from the gallery.
Sherlock had stopped a few steps ahead.  He turned back to me, a glimmer of a smile on his lips.  “Play, John,” he said softly.
Greg met us as we approached the bridge, strobing blue lights reflecting off the glass walls of the office building to our left.  “We’ve got a positive ID,” he said, “Dea Blatto…”
“Gold suits the sunlight in you,” he said, “the fire.”
"So it isn't dead?" I asked.
“Oh?”
“You managed this while I slept?”
“Tonight, it will have been a year and a day since we became lovers,” he said, thoughtfully.  “Particular periods of time have an effect on magical beings.  They can serve as catalysts or intensifiers or nullifiers.”
He stepped closer.  Picked a raspberry from my cupped hands and tapped it against my mouth.
Ms Swann’s eyebrows were up.  “Yes.  How could you know that?”
At my wrists, knots were tugging apart.  My cuffs fell open.  Around my legs, the garters loosened.
“What happens to those who want to go back and don’t know how?” I asked.
I’d suffer death ten thousand times.”
I watched him study the target.
“Show me,” he said.
He held the sprig to my lips and, one by one, I closed my lips about its berries and pulled them off their stems.
My hand darted out and under the soft drape.
“A little.”
He had not turned quickly enough for me to miss the colour on his cheeks.  I considered accusing him of romanticism, but I forbore.  It was not anything so simply labelled, but rather one facet of his infinite variety.
“You had time to read all that I sent you?” he asked, regarding us both in turn.
“I don’t have much to move,” John replied.
"Something that shouldn't be on this side at all," Sherlock said.
I tensed in his arms.
“From Baskerville?” I ventured.
He settled his weight across my hips and leaned down to kiss me.
“The lecture wasn’t that bad,” a familiar voice whispered by my shoulder.
I removed a second layer of paper from my clump, which was starting to look cylindrical.
We don’t always play cards when we retire of an evening or early morning or mid-afternoon.   Sometimes we are too tired, ofttimes too aroused, but now and then one of us deals a hand and we check whether the cards have retained their unusual properties.  For purely scientific purposes, of course.  So far, they have.
“We could have done it all in dreams,” I murmured, realising that that was what we had begun to do.
His arm circled round my back, nudging me closer.  With my cheek against his chest, I could feel how fast his heart was beating.
“Hugh Town,” I said.  “She told them that if they were willing to make the journey, they would find what they sought in Hugh Town, in St Mary’s Church there and they should bring the letters with them.  At this Mrs Morrow sobbed and I thought her husband would join her.
~~~~~~o0o~~~~~~
I didn't qualify to be a doctor in a year either, no amount of studying could have made it so.
“What does he look like?” Mike enquired.
“Show me,” I said.
There was a soft, tearing sound and the band split open in Sherlock’s hand.
He raised one back.
I could see the holly on the bannister now, more berry-laden than ever.
Not really.
Letting him instruct me would be good exercise.  I pictured us fencing in this splendid, spacious room.  It was a much more satisfactory image.
“Pfft.”  Sherlock’s head turned towards me.  “I was watching your expression, John, and that, I could have done at home.”
"You definitely had other things on your mind that night."
“If you would read it aloud, Dr Watson,” he said to me.  “Pray, finish your tea, Mr Corvus, it will be best to face the coming hours fortified.”
Miss Turner bobbed a curtsy then took the hand I held out to her.
John pulled another desk chair next to Sherlock and sat down.  “No one would believe this film wasn’t tampered with.  And why is the subject blurry anyway.  I thought this was about the highest speed camera there is?”
He recalled the first time he had seen them.  He had still been grey and fluffy, but no longer small enough to ride on his mother’s back.  He had been surprised that his parents had not hissed at the creatures, who were large, nor had they chased them away as they did with any other creatures who set foot on their island.  His mother had explained that they were called ‘boys’ and that these boys were cousins and that was why they were welcome.  The swan had been surprised that these ‘boys’ were birds because they only had feathers on their heads, so they couldn’t fly at all.  They could swim though.  He had seen them do it near the river bank.  They were not very fast and they splashed all the time, not only when they were busking.  His mother warned him that there were others who looked very similar to the boys, but were not cousins.  These boys could not come to the river banks or their island, but if he went exploring, he would see such creatures and he should avoid them.
Up to the minstrel gallery I had gone, checked the fencing room, double-checked the laboratory, scanned my bedroom, the bath, the courtyard, the upper kitchen, walked a little faster after each disappointment.  Ran.
John would not like it.
A scratching sound along the floor made me look down.  The two dragons were circling our feet.  Sherlock’s stood on its hind feet and began to climb his trouser leg.
They look so similar.
John looked over his shoulder, startled.
Sherlock half-smiled as he swung his coat over his shoulders.  “Grab some bread.  We can feed the birds while we wait.”
“Do not despair.  You will know the feel of me when only the stars remain in the sky to watch."  The tip of his tongue traced the edge of my ear.  "Even in utter darkness you could feel me, if your desire proves strong enough."
Madeleine didn’t open her eyes.  The dream was the most vivid she had ever had.  She didn’t want it to end.
“Kindly peruse the rest silently until you come to a passage that you think relevant for me to hear prior to meeting our new client,” Holmes said.
“Yes,” Sherlock said from somewhere behind me.  “’Tis the season.”
“Not as sensational as the ones that do get around,” he replied.
Holmes rested his hands on the arms of his chair.  “It is a matter of honour,” he said.
I kept glancing to the side, but without leaning over the parapet all that was visible were the tree tops, mostly the bare oaks' branches with a sprinkling of evergreen here and there.  “Ouch.”  I hopped the next few steps.  “Was that a caldron?”
Sherlock sat with his back against the narrow side of the row of chimneys and his feet pressed up against the low wall around the edge of the roof across the road from 221B Baker Street.  The brick at his back was warm.  His feet were getting cold.  He had been there most of the night.
Angelo set the candle on the table.  “First course coming soon,” he said and hurried away.
“I do believe we have a client,” John said, setting his cup down and pulling a mask from the box on the desk.
Sherlock dismissed it.  The strength of the instinct to display held his attention though.  His wings grew dark; he added snowy edges and expanded their span even more.  He dipped and swirled about the light.  It showed the swallowtail shape of his wings to good advantage.
“To move through the water is very wonderful,” he agreed.  “And then there is the freedom of the air.”  He started walking faster.  “Come.”
The voice of a driver calling his horses to a stop rose from the street.
The heat of the night receded.  I sighed as I embraced him; everywhere I touched was cool.  My hips lifted to meet his.
“One faithful harp shall praise thee.”
“He had a fright over by the Pond and ran off a bit to wait for me, but then he saw a squirrel and the chase was on.”  She hooked the lead to his collar and stroked the dog’s back.  “Poor boy.  That’s the second time that bird gave you a shock.”
“Not in enough,” Sherlock grumbled, his fingers closing around John’s ankle.
I glanced back at him.  “What was it?”
“I could carry that for you, sir,” piped a young voice.
Mrs Hudson patted my leg again and told me to drink my tea.
“Are any of the ingredients hallucinogens?” I asked.
Sherlock sat up.
He sat back on his heels and his head dropped to my thigh.  I stroked his curls away from his face. He sighed and closed his eyes.
“I have, then,” Mike replied.  “He came with Mrs Hudson on her first visit.  Looked me up and down when I came into the consulting room, didn’t introduce himself, just turned to her and said, ‘He’ll do’, and left.  I was too amazed to even ask her who he was.  I’d assumed he was some relative, her son, maybe.  He didn’t come again after that.”
To wear or for the blanket?
“You may,” he said, but did not move.
“We do.  It’s the second paper I gave you.  He had been seriously injured in an accident aboard ship and sent back to England to recuperate.  Shortly before he was due to return to active duty, he contracted smallpox and died here in London, in fact, in the next room, two years before his mother-in-law.  She had not been in robust health for several years prior to her death.  Roderick mentions how she rarely ventured even into the garden anymore in the same letter from which I just read.  It would appear that the annual trips to London were a thing of the past for her well before Simpson’s death, so it being seen by her mother shouldn't have worried Madeline.”
Sherlock’s smile reached his eyes for an instant.  “You were used to swimming with them.”
Sherlock looked from my face to my hand and to my face once more.  He was searching for something there.
“That’s one of them,” Sherlock said, looking over my shoulder.
The time will come that we have seen,
I sat down on the grass and watched the lioness groom the dog.  It was strange seeing Baskerville look…like a puppy.
She left us alone with our refreshments, but before she turned to leave, I saw her hand twitch near Holmes’s head and I think she only just refrained from ruffling his hair.
Between the lace of the curtain, the hazy light of the day and the brim of our visitor’s hat, I had not had a clear view of his countenance from the window.  In our doorway, however, he was like a framed portrait of some noble scion weighed down too soon by sorrow.  The colour was drained from his face, which only heightened the beauty of its lines and threw his large, dark eyes into startling contrast.  He looked from me to Holmes and parted his lips to speak.  Judging from the formality of his dress, that bore every token of mourning I had ever encountered and a couple that I had not, I expected him to address us with equal formality.  He surprised me.
I inhaled, which was a mistake at that distance.  A light fragrance emanated from his open collar, something that made me want to lick the skin over that delicate throb, to taste it or even bite into it.
“And I had a wire just before we left the hotel in Paris, confirming our tickets for the concert in Montpellier.  A suite from the incidental music for
“We’re both idiots,” I said, waking up the phone.  The end of the passenger manifest for the
My hand glided down his side and over his hip to nestle between his thighs.  High between his thighs.  In a warm, sweet spot.
Chapulu blinked her golden eyes at Sherlock.
“I can see why anyone who sees you in your true form would be bound to you,” John said.
“It was despair, John,” Sherlock whispered in my ear.  “He must have fed the leeches on his dying victims’ blood, storing up their despair to use on people whom he couldn’t bring to feel it in any other way.”
Sherlock chuckled.  “What’s more discreet than one more fairy among the fairies?”  He slipped down several branches, disturbing not a leaf.
Bert stood up with similarly full pockets and found a knothole in the trunk near his side of the path and slotted his torch into it.
He was looking down, turned slightly away from me.  I couldn’t see his expression clearly.  He would know the bones were his.  I hadn’t thought much about what images were flowing from my biro, but the phalanges that dug into the muscle of the heart were long, the position of the hand otherwise the same as in my first drawing.
It was a relief to hear my name, the one that was just me, not linked to who sired me or who sired him.  “I can choose my term?” I asked and wondered who this negotiator was that seemed to have taken charge of my tongue.
“Just below the water,” I said, staring at the bolt.  The stones either side of it were pulling away from the mortar, tilting upwards at the seam.  “A dead…a deadly eye.  I hit it there.”  I shivered.  “The wind is cold along the river.”
“Then I would have brought your heart.”
