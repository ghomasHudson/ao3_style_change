Scotland Yard turned against you?!”
“But you didn’t keep in contact with her throughout the night?” Sherlock asked, his baritone voice echoing across the room, “A protective mother surely would.”
“Thank you, thank you,” the woman whispered, her voice wavering in pitch, “It’s… so hard… so many people talking to us…”
But the tables turned, and the grunting from the men kicking him turned into yells. Someone else had arrived, apparently, and John managed to drag himself away from the scuffle to look up. Of course it was Sherlock - he knew where he was; after all, and Sherlock had not disconnected from the line.
In all truth, this was a bit not good.
The mother rose to speak but dissolved into tears again; John could practically feel Sherlock roll his eyes behind their backs. Disapproving, John reached over and offered a tissue box to the woman, who gratefully accepted it.
“Do you have any pictures of her?” Sherlock asked, “Ones from the last
“And whatever was in that drug killed her… so she was poisoned by - what did you call it? Wolfs…”
“And?”
“Of course.”
“Her phone was found just outside the club, according to the files” Sherlock said, not turning to greet John as he entered, “Someone handed it in as lost property and it was identified as it was handed in a few minutes after the girl left - a connection, obviously, made by me. That and the fact she is a subject in her lockscreen along with other friends.”
“Alright,” John said, but added as Sherlock made to stand: “But eat your noodles, first. That cost me £4 and God knows I hate wasting food.”
“Just what I’m thinking.” He locked the phone, sticking it in his pocket. “We’ll need to show this to Lestrade when I show my theory… but we’ll need more evidence. Come on.”
at harm. I… worry about you.”
Sherlock’s gaze flickered to glance out the glass pane of the doors leading out into the back garden where the sun was now steadily lowering, casting a deep golden glow filtering through the fabric of the cream curtain. Sherlock’s clever eyes reflected the deep orange of the sunset, then turned back to face John again.
, little brother. I only wanted to keep an eye on you, in case you put yourself in any danger.”
“There was an indent on her nape from a needle puncture. Clearly, someone else administered it and likely in surprise, too. Recent puncture but not fresh.”
Mycroft had developed many epithets over the years. Tubby was one of them, as a child – a ceaseless nickname given by Sherlock and Redbeard in his youth (he flicked his head slightly; Mycroft disliked thinking of Redbeard, as if the blame was on his shoulders). Another one was Ice Man, one that was additionally unpopular with the man yet often echoed in his brain like a continuous insult. It was justified, admittedly – it matched with his opinions and morals, which he had tried to force-feed to his little brother for many years but simply ended up fruitless.
Mycroft paused, awaiting an aggravated response for daring to mention his end with such an unfriendly tone; he was not disappointed, as the reply came after a few seconds of silence. “If you’re going to bring up the fact that I shouldn’t
I’ve always
“Are you alright?” Sherlock asked, stepping over to reach John, who was leaning against the wall trying to regain his breath.
with each day passing, and it was an internal debate within Mycroft whether this was a positive thing or not. He always believed that sentiment did not suit the Holmes trio, but it was starting to occur to Mycroft that maybe it did suit Sherlock after all. Clearly, John meant a lot to Sherlock. Maybe too much, in fact.
Sherlock blinked with some puzzlement, intrigued and confused by the phrasing of his words. “John, I… what are you saying? That you’re irrelevant to me?”
John thought.
“Are you badly hurt?”
Oddly surprised at the firmness in John’s attitude, Sherlock’s gaze slid very momentarily, perhaps just within the slight space of half a second, to John. This man seemed to be full of small surprises today - perhaps he was not telling him something? Or something was persisting the man? But now was not the time to linger - Sherlock knew John was fully capable of dealing with whatever internal struggle might be happening.
Once the snickering died down, they were momentarily quiet for a while, in a comfortable companionable silence, now quickly approaching the street sign for Baker Street.
“I’ll be just round the corner,” she said, and John realized she was probably talking to whoever’s foot was crushing his back, “Deal with him. I can’t have witnesses. Sorry, Doctor Watson..” The passenger door opened, and she clambered into the seat without sparing a second look at John, slammed the door and the car rumbled away down the street.
“Sorry,” John muttered, his head low.
“I have told you many times before, Sherlock. Caring is not an advantage… people die, hearts are broken, trust is destroyed and love is often not worth the trouble. If you genuinely believe that John Watson is more good for you than bad, then by all means… resume your relationship together. But love is a weakness, brother dear, and one day it will ultimately destroy you… I pray it will not be John Watson who does it to you.”
“We’d have called her in the morning if she hadn’t come back-”
“That girl did mention that Kelly was acting a little different,” John said suddenly, “That she was a bit more sociable. But, Sherlock, I'm still not quite following you - how is she missing? She was here yesterday.”
Mycroft’s thoughts were disturbed by the calling of his phone, which rattled beside him, but the man made no physical movement to display any sign of being startled. Instead, after a couple of rings, his eyes lazily flicked open and travelled to the screen which glowed the caller’s ID:
“And I think you’re forgetting who
“I would rather know sooner than immediately,” Mycroft replied, his tone starting to shift rather cool, “And I meant to have a word with you about Doctor Watson.”
“No,” John replied, surprisingly coolly, “Like you say, she’s an adult, she
“I… no, I don’t know.”
“Yeah,” he managed to cough out, “Just going for a walk.”
His thoughts were interrupted, once again, but this time not by Sherlock. Instead, it was by a woman standing around the corner, a phone to hear ear and the locks of a gold-brown hair flowing in a bob, with the ash of a half-smoked cigarette building up on the end of the stub.
Ah, of course - Sherlock was right. A client.
“Ah,” he said, and opened his eyes to stare at John. His eyes were tingling with excitement, a slight twitch of a smirk on his lips, “How interesting.”
“Not at all, little brother,” Mycroft replied, with a slight twist of a smile. He ended the call, placing the phone on his desk and outwardly sighing.
“I was merely
“Yes, yes - what else?”
Sherlock cleared his throat, not quite looking at John. “I’m not one for giving praise or gratefulness, John… but it doesn’t mean I don’t feel it.
angry at me.”
“Don’t be daft, Mycroft, you
“Then don’t laugh!”
John nudged Sherlock’s arm a little.
“I had a suspicion you would say that.”
chatter at that: gossip, giggling, mindless babbling and pratting about pathetic, and quite frankly pitiful, conversation topics that did not expand the mind or make decisions on the
But John was still puzzled. “So the smoking - the coat - the jewellery. What's all that mean?”
It was John who picked out their spot for lunch - a rather small and newly-opened Japanese restaurant. The two preferred their Chinese takeaway, but John felt it might be nice to branch out a little. It only had two people on the counter who stuck their noodles in a cardboard box and pointed to them to the benches available to sit at. But it was cheap at least, and not too bad either, he thought as he picked at the noodles and tried to eat them without the noodles flicking up his nose. Sherlock wasn’t eating his much, but when did he?
He finished and the silence stretched on for a moment. Then Sherlock replied, his voice colder than before, slightly tense, “John Watson will never be a burden on me, nor a hindrance. I don’t appreciate you suggesting that. I won’t let go of him.”
“But your ego is too high to actually do it? Because the Mighty Sherlock Holmes’s head is far too high up his arse to consider me -
This one was a fighter and certainly knew what he was doing. John was instantly winded with a harsh knee to the stomach then felt a blow to the back of his legs, finding himself tipped over and on the ground. The ground was

“I'm saying we're not just dealing with a murder case, John, but also a missing persons case.”

The phone picked up. “Sherlock?” John said, “She’s here - you were right, it’s got to be replacements - the girl’s here. Alive.”
intelli-”
“... it’s not brilliant, it’s just observation.”
“But we need it done,” Mr McKenzie answered, directing to both the duo and his wife, “If you’re here on the case, Mr Holmes, then I really think you’ll be able to help us…”
As if he cared. So long as he didn’t have to stare Sherlock in the face right now…
“And… what exactly are we looking for?” John asked, looking around the room.
Rather surprised, Mycroft picked up the phone and answered it, raising it to his ear and gazing at the door to his office, as if expecting the caller to burst through the door at that moment.
The woman was quick, he’d give her that. He was forced into a light jog as he hurried to meet her, turning a corner of a street.
“I’m not,” he said, pushing himself off his chair, “I’m… just tired.”
Sherlock performed weakly in front of the grieving.
Sherlock’s thought process was,
“Just some bruising and abrasions. Mostly to the ribs. Let’s go, already, it’s bloody freezing out.”
“Wolfsbane. Very fast acting poison, but comes in the form of a flower. Just touching it can cause problems.”
“Everything I ask in an investigation is relevant,” Sherlock said, his voice smooth and confident, “Everyone’s minds are so wrung by the facts in front of their nose that they miss out on the tiny yet most important details that could resolve a case in a heartbeat. That is why I am here - to
“Er - just outside a pub,
The man himself, the eldest of the Holmes siblings, was intimidating in his own manner. The shortening crop of his dark hair was neatly combed back and the creases on his forehead furrowed in the depths of his thoughts. There was a slight growth of a pot belly, one that just refused to vanish despite his work-out training and diet but it didn’t deter him very much. Poised in his windowless office, he sat with his chin resting on his knuckles, eyes closed. You would have thought he was asleep.
Once the final attacker had been left semi-conscious on the ground, Sherlock straightened himself and adjusted his scarf. Well, at least there was some excitement to his night. Maybe he should ask John to look for fights more often.
John did not bother to disturb the man. It gave him time to at least reflect on the strange feeling that was bubbling up in his gut again. He sat himself down on his favourite seat, stretching out his legs and aching knees.
able to look after herself.”
John looked puzzled at this last sentence, then drew himself together. “Alright. So - the girl we found has probably died from… drug poisoning…?”
“Sherlock, brother dear,” Mycroft spoke, his voice thick with a sort of condescending pleasantries, as if mocking the happy women who would greet friends on the phone with raspy giggles, “What a surprise, I didn’t expect
“It’s alright, John,” Sherlock replied, digging an arm underneath John’s armpit and helping him to his feet, “It’s alright. Just catch your breath. We’re going back home. If a constable catches us, you’re drunk, alright? John? John, can you hear me?”
John did not reply. He exhaled slowly and tapped his foot, staring down at the floor. Then he responded, “Reckon this is going to be another unsolved case then?”
“But it's just a theory right now,” Sherlock replied a little bitterly, leaning back and stabbing a tender bit of chicken with a chopstick, “We need more evidence.”
“For God’s sake,” John replied irritably, not really scared by her statement but rather annoyed instead, “I’m not
when others are too out of their depth to. Mr and Mrs McKenzie, over the past seven days, has your daughter been in any way different? Any personality changes - hobbies - any surprising changes in the slightest?”
Sherlock thought to himself, flickering a glance at the grief-stricken woman, but the disdainful look John was occasionally hurling at him assured him not to say this aloud. He made to speak, but the mother interrupted him: “Why is that relevant?”
“Did she say what?” Sherlock asked, his fingertips pressed together.
He’s not my boyfriend.”
“Mr and Mrs McKenzie?” John asked solemnly, and gave a slight bow of the head, “I am so sorry to hear about your daughter… truly.”
to step out and have a cigarette. But now Kelly’s body has turned up for us to find on purpose - why? Why did the replacement back out? And why show it off to the world, not even bothering to try frame it as a suicide?”
“Well, they’ve done their best to mimic it,” John said, “But it’s definitely a bit different. Doesn’t curl her y’s the same way… and writes her ampersands differently, too.”
“I don’t know - what happened,” John breathed, “Shit, Sherlock - the girl was here. The dead girl. But you’re right - she must be a replacement, she was smoking, and,” he paused, drawing out a breath of air.
“But,” Sherlock finished, his baritone voice quiet, “That is not a story for tonight. Maybe another night, John. I will explain it to you… not tonight, though.”
Honestly, he wonders why they don’t just scrap the Parliament and let one person make the choices others can’t make. Why negotiate when you can just decide?
Sherlock paused, just for a beat, before replying, “What for?”
, I-I can’t see a street sign-
But John couldn’t help it, and neither could Sherlock.
“Oh, please, John - you flatter me.”
Mr McKenzie cleared his own heavy throat. “I mean, i-it was just a normal night. We had dinner together, some homemade pizza… then half hour after dinner, she said she was off out to a party and she’d be home late. Then she left… and that was the last we ever heard of her…”
“Sometimes I feel like I might as well be,” John replied bitterly. In truth, he was half-wishing he hadn’t brought this up. He wanted out of this place right now - away from that bloody idiot, gazing at him like a confused child -
“Finally, John, you're starting to
He had turned a corner into an alleyway, and he suddenly felt his legs give way as he tripped. Falling to the wet pavement beneath him, his chin slammed against the concrete and the wind was momentarily knocked out of him. John saw his phone clatter from his hand, but as he reached out to snatch it back a foot kicked it away. Not
to everyone - swatting away opinions that did not match his own, ignoring ideas that were not a part of his ideal code and motto. Perhaps it was the need for attention - it was always Sherlock this, Sherlock that, we all love Sherlock Holmes, thanks for the help Sherlock Holmes, you’re our hero Sherlock Holmes, your website is amazing Sherlock Holmes…
The night air had turned chilly, and their hot breaths exhaled out in front of them as wisps of a thin steam. The lamp posts above them glowed, and the distant hum of traffic from the main street was a comforting buzz in the background - it seemed almost faraway, as if stepping into it would lead to an entire different world on its own. Instead, the pair remained in the quiet empty streets, only with the rare drive-by of a passing taxi or an occasional stranger out late who would hastily cross the street upon their approach. Not that Sherlock or John really cared.
“You know perfectly well if I put myself at harm then John would notify you immediately.”
“So,” Sherlock said, after a while of companionable silence, “What did you find out?”
Sherlock looked up from his spiel to see his companion listening intently, idly devouring his food. It was a little nice, admittedly, to see his words actually be listened to. But his heart sank a little more as John said, with noodles still in his cheeks, “But it's just a theory right now.”
“Yes. Like I said… we need more evidence. We’ll talk to the parents, maybe they can give us something.”
The screen flickered to black.
The mother’s retched gasp in surprise made Sherlock have to resist the urge to roll his eyes, but luckily it was the male who answered defiantly. “No. She’s had no past experience in smoking - not in any form of drugs, asides drinking. Nobody in this house smokes.”
The pair snickered for a moment. “Yeah, you are,” John agreed, “An obnoxious, self-centered ass-”
“Mycroft…” Sherlock’s reply was dangerous and warning, but did not remotely concern Mycroft.
“Because I am.”
“So - the replacement is
who was there for you when even
“Certainly, Mycroft,” came the response from the other end of the phone, “That’s more Mrs Hudson’s thing, don’t you think?”
important matters.
Ignoring his stutters, John turned on his heel and marched out the door, leaving Sherlock sitting upright on the sofa. Slamming the door behind him, he headed down the stairs with his blood pumping. He barely noticed Mrs Hudson, who had been busying herself in the hallway.
Mrs McKenzie shook her head and managed to choke out, “S-She’s an adult… we trusted her to come home… safe…” Her body shuddered and she breathed out, “Was that a mistake?"
“Yes, yes, I can,” he replied, haven paused to try catch air.
“John Watson, right?” The girl said. Her voice wasn’t London, “Listen - we appreciate your concern, but you and your boyfriend are toeing a line into a world that you shouldn’t be messing with.”
“Her eyes, John. They’re blue.”
Look around the room: handwriting on the notebook smudged because she’s left-handed - empty tea-mug titled to her left to pick up with her left hand - pens on the desk that were abandoned there were on her left, but the pencil holder is on the right, though tilted to the left when moved to reach with her left hand. Power sockets - plug on the left but more scratches on the right from more usage. People look but don’t observe, that’s my problem with Scotland Yard and why they come to me.”
“Had another argument, have we?” She tittered.
How the hell could Kelly McKenzie, the dead girl from the dumpster, be
to the face and sending him sprawling back on the pavement. There was very small chances of getting back up; best he could do was protect his head, face and throat and waiting for the blows to pass.
John rustled a little in his chair. “Yes.”
“Alright,” John said, leaning forward, “So clearly something about her being a smoker is interesting.”
“The way you often treat him, I’m occasionally inclined to believe otherwise,” Mycroft said, with an air of coldness that even surprised himself.
The point that Mycroft Holmes was trying to make to himself was that his office was really quite comfortable.
His favourite handle so far was “the British Government”. His confidence shone with this one, pleased to actually have gotten somewhere in life as a Holmes – as if you could call being a private detective a career! The man didn’t even get paid! That poor doctor, trying to pay the rent for himself… but that was beside the point. Almost immediately after the incident with Eurus and Redbeard, Mycroft had decided to assume the weight of the responsible Holmes in the family. It was good he did too, because his drug-fuelled fool of a brother wouldn’t be able to. Despite the fact he had both the title of the family name and the entirety of the United Kingdom on his shoulders, he did his utmost to never waver or show a sign of weakness. One false move and it all comes crashing down.
“And she specifically stated that the woman was going out to smoke?” Sherlock asked, eyes still shut.
“And in truth,” Mycroft confessed quietly, “You do too, Doctor John Watson.”
Now even John was avoiding eye-contact.
Again, there was no response from the end of the line, but Mycroft could almost feel Sherlock’s desperation. It pained him. He dragged out an outbreath of air. “The cameras will be turned off tonight and I will send someone to remove them.”
Sherlock jumped back from an attempted kick, slamming one of the attackers into the wall. John nearly winced as the man’s skull crashed into the brick wall with a sickening crack and slumped, clutching the back of his head in a daze. The detective sprang back once again as the other crony swung a left punch, but Sherlock was quicker - he twisted the man's arm around his back, spinning round like some kind of ballet dancer; Sherlock thrust his elbow pit into the man’s throat and kicked at the nice, sensitive part of his legs - below the thigh, above the calf.
John hardly had time to make his first move before realizing he was, apparently, playing the black pieces of the chess game. The girl spotted him, dropped her unfinished cigarette onto the pavement and walked away without stomping it out, the phone still pressed to her ear. John followed, digging out his own phone from his pocket and hurriedly dialling.
“Going back to your dead daughter,” Sherlock proclaimed a little loudly, and John threw the man a cold look as the mother quietly starting weeping again, “I have a few questions. Was your daughter a smoker?”
“The body was blue, too - but they were heterochromatic. The eyes on the body had a silver of green, just on the right. Barely noticeable at a glance. The girl here has pure blue eyes - in fact, maybe a little
“No - I mean - no, that’s - John -”
But as he walked, with the damp pavements and roads softly glowing in the puddles from the lampposts glaring white lights, his anger settled into a form of depression and shame. John didn’t really want to have kicked up a fuss. He knew when he signed up for this mess that he wasn’t to expect a lot of praise for heroic deeds or good knowledge. Had he not had the same treatment in the army? He joined for the adrenaline to flow through his veins, the excitement and fear of knowing any corner could be his meeting with death, the thrill of skin against bone, the recoil of a gun in his hand, the pinging noise of the bullets as they rattled off brick walls and sand under his army boots -
“What cameras?” Mycroft asked innocently. For a brief second, he felt childlike again, as if trying to hide his mischief from his elderly figures or teasing his younger brother- but he shook off the feeling quickly.
“Okay, okay - she’s right-handed. So?”
am,” John retorted, the tone of his voice low but starting to slowly increase in volume, “I’m not your follower - I’m not some background character - I’m
But Sherlock had gone into the kitchen, and John returned the crying woman with a sympathetic smile before following him. The kitchen was of smooth marble, connected to a dining room; Sherlock was leaning against the counter of the kitchen island, holding an iPhone with a pink plastic case.
“Not at all,” Sherlock drawled, his voice almost devoid of feeling, “Why, I think it'll be solved before dawn.”
“So you
The rant exploding in his head, that had slowly been getting more aggressive, was abruptly cut off by the deep, baritone voice. John’s head flicked over to where Sherlock was lying, who had not moved position but simply turned his head to look over. John shuffled in his spot, not uncomfortably but rather defiantly, before replying: “Figure that out well enough, huh?”
“And that’s about as modest as you’ll get. What’s our plan now?”
The addition was a little macabre but genuine - he'd probably get killed in this line of work.
The once peaceful and relaxed atmosphere that Mycroft had been indulging in had evaporated, replaced by a peculiar tense feeling. It was as if two superpowers were desperate to break a truce – each word carefully hand-picked to somehow be simultaneously snarky and cold, yet pleasant.
“Two of them at once was just…”
John squinted to gaze a the picture. From a mere glance at the photo and what he could recall of the body, they were identical. But of course it had to be tiny details that were off…
Deciding not to hide the truth no longer, Mycroft gave a sigh and leaned back in his chair, though maintaining his high and professional stature. Even in the absence of the audience, he did his best to scare and intimidate.
John hardly heard her reply as he donned his coat and walked out. He knew Sherlock was probably standing outside the window, the curtain slightly drawn back to watch John march across the street in an entirely random direction. He was also fully aware of the chances Sherlock would ring up his brother and request someone watch him on the cameras - the other side of the chances was that Mycroft was already doing it without Sherlock’s asking.
“John, please. I commend you for your work in gun combat, general intelligence-”
“Her parents? We’re going to see them?”
Perhaps it was envy. John had always been amazed at the consulting detective’s profound ability to analyze and decipher at a mere glance, to state the impossible with a sense of casuality, to read into someone’s life with a flicker of a glimpse from head to toe. Perhaps it was irritation at the man’s attitude, he was always so
“Which is?”
Greg snorted. “You mean he fancies him? A Holmes has a crush?”
John swallowed, before offering a bashful smile, feeling heat rush to his cheeks. “I’d hardly call them heroics. I mean he could’ve died from the fall, I was hardly going to sit and watch. Hurt like hell on my arm though.”
Sherlock heard the first sniff and he knew what was happening. He opened his eyes, and glanced over, John was crying again.
Though he stopped focusing on what Sherlock was doing, and more on what Greg had just said, and what that meant. “Oh.” He replied simply, unable to wrack his brains for a better response than that. “I can tell him we aren’t if you want, I’d get the secret back.”
But he just…
“Sometime this week and we might find out.”
Before he could embarrass himself, or John could embarrass him more he decided to try and shush him and get him out. He preferred to get his social life out of his life at school, preferring to keep up the persona that teachers eat, sleep and breathe school. “Yes, thank you, Mr Watson, we are aware of the severity that hitting your head can become, thank you for your concern, will that be all?”
He had a knack for simply falling back onto ground like there was no risk of injury, it was quite fascinating to say the least, very entertaining to watch at the most.

might have to go to school tomorrow, might fake sicker to get out of it.
“The pubs’ll still be there tomorrow.” Greg repeated, giving John a look that shut him up and warned him not to be guilty about it. He still couldn’t help but feel that it was his fault. “Unless Sherlock explodes them all in rage.” He joked and the three of them shared a smile, even if it vanished quickly. The idea was plausible, not that any of them would ever share that thought.
John.
believe that’s what I mean.”
Mycroft squeezed his eyes shut for a moment trying to quiet down his thoughts. “Who?” He replied opening them again,
“You really care about him don’t you.” Mycroft spoke once they were out the door, into the cool night. “John, I mean.”
“If, uhm,” John cleared his throat. “If you don’t mind.” He replied.
your classes, John, even herbology.” Other than quidditch, they were usually together in Herbology, it was the class where she’d asked him out. Besides that he didn’t really associate anything good with the class. Professor Sprout was fairly nice, and he wasn’t particularly awful at it, but he was always put with Sarah for practicals. She was usually quite dictatorial when they were partnered and always nit-picked at the little mistakes he’d make.
“Yeah,” John said, “Fingernails have a yellow tinge to them… and her teeth. So you were right about the smoking part.”
was it… right? A form of irritation. John was irritated at the detective. Irritated… impatient… mildly aggravated. Yes, that was it. But
he bitterly thought as he handed over the money and clambered out of the back seat). By the time he had trudged up the stairs and into the living room, Sherlock had already retired onto the sofa, fingertips gently pressed together and eyes closed. He had his nicotine patches - yes,
“You do worry me, Sherlock Holmes,” he said, turning to the tablet in front of him. The black-and-white CCTV flickered as Sherlock himself pocketed his phone, turning his gaze up to the camera and crossing his brow impatiently. Mycroft started deactivating the cameras one by one, almost painfully slowly; he was being stripped of reassurance as each one blackened out. The last one remained in the sitting room of 221B Baker Street, where a grey-haired man was dozing on the couch.
“- and medical care, but you are not the greatest liar. You’re forgetting who I am, John.”
One of the men dived in for a right hook, but John weaved round and hurled his own. His fist connected with the man’s nose and felt the bone shatter; a spurt of blood shot from the man’s nostril, flowing into his lips and between John’s knuckles. The ex-army soldier lunged forward, aiming for the throat, but was intercepted by his gravelly-voiced friend.
I was calling about the cameras.”
Finishing in his spiel, Sherlock glanced to look at John. The soldier sniffed and gave a nod, rolling back his shoulders. “Bloody brilliant.”
“I didn’t finish my sentence earlier, John.”
John came over to one of the notebooks the girl had been studying out of. Both pages were flooded with writing, certain lines and key-words highlighted. John squinted at the writing. If he looked carefully…
The mother broke down into fruitlessly suppressed sobs once again, and the father pulled the woman tight to his side, grimacing.

“Kick him about a bit,” his partner replied - less gravelly, new smoker, “That’ll please her.”
Silence.
Irritation.
And that was all that needed to be said.
“She was just… just Kelly,” the woman sniffled.
John blinked a few times, then his forehead creased to think. After a moment, he said, “There… were no physical signs. Right?”
John couldn’t help snicker a bit, which made his ribs ache, and they set at a steady pace with arms slung around each other; it really looked like Sherlock was just carrying a drunk buddy home - John was stumbling over his feet occasionally and looked a little dazed. Sherlock hoped it was just part of the act.
“Yelling at you. Telling you a pompous prick.”
John swallowed his food, placing down the plastic fork. “The girl’s name was Suzi. Her description matched up with Lestrade’s recount - too drunk to remember Kelly had gone out.” He bit his lip for half a second to recount what she had said, trying to strike out the garble of pleading to prove her innocence. “She said the girl had gone bathroom and came out looking worried about something.”
“Agreed. What’s the matter this time then? I do hope you haven’t been dabbling in your ‘medications’ again.”
“Not at all, your business is your business.” Strictly untrue, Mycroft had tabs on John almost constantly, almost as much as Sherlock at this point – though admittedly he only preferred to intervene when he was certain it was a 100% dire situation, which thankfully was rarely (the truth was, Sherlock could handle himself - when it came to a case, that is. John was more talented in that form, however.) “I merely heed a warning.”
John didn’t have the chance to try glance at the drivers licence, because someone had already yanked the scruff of his neck and hauled him to his feet. John was slammed into a brick wall and felt his head spin before being thrown back onto the floor. He did his best to regain his senses as his attackers started conversation.
With the investigation underway, Sherlock and John work together to crack the case. However, there's a strange bitterness in John's emotions that even he himself can't define. What is getting John so worked up? And will it affect the case, or even his relationship with Sherlock?
The girl has been replaced by someone and she - that's to say, Original Kelly - was a killed a week ago by her replacement. And since then she's been leading Kelly’s life - but obviously missed out on details. Was more sociable than she reckoned the original girl was, and her smoking - the replacement had a smoking habit she couldn't break, just
John nodded, and stuck into his noodles again. “Okay. Did you find anything else?”
The warmth of the sun had settled into twilight by the time the pair returned to 221b Baker Street. Sherlock had ditched John in the cab, leaving the army doctor to pay the fare (
“But truthfully - sometimes I think you need John more than John needs you,” he added.
“Are you sure?” The man’s eyes narrowed firmly, crouching down to survey his friend, “They kicked you quite a bit, if I had been sooner -”
“Practically.” But Sherlock ignored John’s comment, and has already swiped onto the photos. He practically thrust the phone to John. “Here, take a look. Are there any differences you notice compared to her and the body?”
“That’s the most interesting part, John, because she
Ignoring this, he said, “You handed over a tissue to the mother, she took it with her right hand. The father’s coffee - titled to his right to take with his right hand. The dead body had calluses on her right fingers from her guitar, and her handwriting is also right-handed because the page didn’t smudge when writing on ink. On her lockscreen, she was taking a picture with her right hand.”
He did not understand why he felt mad at Sherlock.
The girl ignored his statement as a car rolled up behind her. John squinted -
“Can you tell us what happened the night you last saw her?” John asked.
The woman gulped shakily. “Oh, well… she’s always taking photos on her phone, i-it’s on the kitchen side… oh, what’s the word for it - taking pictures of herself, all dressed up and p-pretty…”
I managed to squeeze in this chapter before I go on holiday. I have been very overworked from college, hence the gap of time between chapters. I don't even have the next chapter written yet... but it'll come.
“Reevaluate your priorities, John.”
They snickered again, a little more enthusiastically. “Don’t make me laugh, you prick, it hurts my ribs.”
The married couple exchanged confused glances, as if checking with each other, and John could almost read the answer before it parted from their lips. “No,” the man replied, “No - nothing noticeable…”
“I won’t let go of him,” Sherlock repeated, and added a little more weakly, “I can’t let go of him, Mycroft. I just…. can’t.”
“Yeah, bloody thanks for that.”
what cameras,” Sherlock continued crossly, “I can see them clear as day, and it’ll be a matter of time before John does too.”
Despite the absolutely ungodly hour, the traffic and vibe of London was by far from dead. By far, in fact, it seemed to resume in its incessant stream; flickering taxi lights welcoming or denying the men on night shift, or gaggle of girls tripping down the street, teetering on the balance somewhere between tipsy and drunk. Some individuals simply cannot withstand the roaring turmoil of the city traffic as cars, buses and taxis alike rambled down roads with the constant blaring lights of advertisements pushing forth their marketing deals in attempt to woo the general public to consume in their products. The buzz of the mindless chatter was what was most aggravating of all –
“Not just that,” Sherlock said, “John, as I have said before - you may not be the most luminous yourself but you are an excellent conductor.”
John glanced up to Sherlock, noticing that the man wasn’t looking directly to John but his eyes were closed. “No… she just made an excuse, said she threw up in the toilet. Then she said she was going out for a smoke and that was the last time they saw her.”
“Good to know prison hasn’t changed you.”
“Fine, thank you.” Sherlock replied, pressing his forehead against John’s back as a sign of thanks, before he went back to tracing words and spell motions into John’s old and worn out Ramones t-shirt, Sherlock knew it was a hand-me-down from Harry.
“Hm?”
Was implied but unspoken.
He swallowed thickly before replying. “Harry? Harry I need you to come pick me up.”
“Don’t be, Myc. I'm just being a jealous git for no reason, honest.” Mycroft’s mouth quirked up at the nickname, and he heard Greg sigh, pushing his mouth into the shoulder of Mycroft’s coat. He mumbled something into the fabric that sounded an awful lot like “
“I know the book you can copy from; we’ll get it from the library tomorrow.” Sherlock let out a huff of hair on to Johns neck and he squirmed a little and laughed. “I’m not
Johns heart stopped, and then kicked in far too quickly, beating fast.
“I’m sure. So why am I here?”
sad boy hours my dudes. im in an art-block and im ready to throw myself off a bridge.
“You’re always a twat.”
The Slytherin shot down his attempt to lighten the mood, his glare icy enough to freeze a man to the core, but it thawed slightly as Greg stared right back at him. “I'm serious, Greg.”
“I wont ever stop worrying, that’s the turmoil that comes with Sherlock Holmes.”
The taller boy offered him a soft smile, before throwing the cigarette to the ground, stamping it out with his foot.
“No, I mean… I mean I’ve been keeping something from you.” Greg replied, biting his lip and eyeing Mycroft nervously for his reaction.
“You asked me to teach you how to fly. So, I’m gonna teach you.”
“Mycroft was too busy staring at him anyway.”
John gave him a look that told him he was fucked for his excuses. “Bullshit, Mycroft is too busy for this he wouldn’t have come if you didn’t, and I doubt you’ll miss the train that much, what’s the real reason?”
So, he needed to know, not wanting to worsen the situation for John.
“You’re a cock.” John laughed, was crying now, against his best intentions. “Thank you.”
“I don’t know.” Considering what his answer was, it suddenly didn’t seem all that surprising that Sherlock couldn’t deduce it.
Sherlock frowned, rolling his eyes and turning back to his book. “I don’t do tutoring, and unfortunately my transfiguration is only fourth-year level, so it wouldn’t be much use anyway.” He muttered distractedly, in the way that aggravated Mummy and Father so much (
He was hanging by the gloved hand of John Watson, and he was holding on for dear life. Because it quite literally depended on it.
“John?” Sherlock spoke up, realising that if now was the time for apologies he may as well go the whole nine yards.
Mycroft somehow made coming up the ladder somewhat intimidating, the three-piece-suit overshadowing John’s wrinkled plaid shirt and oversized jumper.
They stayed like that for a little while, making out in their kitchen, pulling each other close.
, over him.”
“Broken then, how this time? Boyfriend? I don’t doubt it, I’m sure John will be pleased to hear you were making out with somebody at our kitchen table.” They had quite a teasing relationship, always had. He wasn’t terribly upset about it, but it did ruin his plans for the evening. Rosie was generally quite honest, she got that from John, and she felt quite strongly about things being fair, also from John. So, it was incredibly likely she’d give him the money for it, once she got payed.
They were tired, exhausted even, a case had just been wrapped up, and Rosie had been put to bed long ago, John made a mental note to buy Mrs Hudson flowers or something as a thank-you. But John didn’t want to retire just yet, perfectly happy to spend a few more moments in the late-night company of his flatmate.
“Not just her, my dad too. It’s stupid, I'm sorry.” John’s face tinted red as the embarrassment of the breakdown hit him.
“She sent me a valentine in second year, I ignored it. A few months later and we were dating regardless. Nobody said anything.”
So, when they started what was apparently more than a friendship, given the kisses and the sex, John Watson didn’t really expect Sherlock to nestle into him when he was reading a book. He was surprised, but not repelled, so he moved his arm for Sherlock’s own to wrap around his torso and got on with reading his book.
"I wondered how long it would take you to catch on."
She gave John a once over before tutting. “Oh dear, you silly boy! Right, I’ll have something up as soon as I can. You know what your father’s like without his paper.”
John was bi, that wasn’t hard to tell, he checked out men just as much as he checked out women.
“When I was a teenager, life was hell. I hated it the moment it happened. I
. But his friend was a good judge of character, and he seemed happier when he was with Mycroft than when he was pining.
He grabbed the bottle of lube he kept in his bedside cabinet. He knew for a fact there wasn't any need for a condom, John had his ovaries frozen about six months after he moved in.
Th time dragged out, all of which, the boy on the stool spent staring straight ahead, his eyes vacant as if he wasn’t present in his own body.
“To Sherlock?”
“Then apologise.” The Hufflepuff replied simply. “Just tell him you didn’t mean it. Its not rocket science. He’s a human lie detector isn’t he? He’ll know if you’re sincere.”
. I get it.”
He had to do something.
“What time is it?” John asked to nobody in particular.
He was shown by Martha Hudson into one of the spare bedrooms. It was light and spacious, with a comfortable looking bed. His bag had been left down to the room.
Sherlock stiffed against him, his gaze fixed at a man loading boxes into a moving van. “It’s him, the suspect, he’s staring at me now. My cover, what do couples even do?”
A roar went up from the crowd, as it was declared that Gryffindor won the match, and Mycroft was amongst the cheering and clapping.
Against his best efforts he found himself gripping the bar as the match aged further, and people were tiring out, leaning so fa forward he could have fallen off the edge, straining just to make sure he didn’t miss anything. Greg was breath-taking in the air, his hair pulled back when he flew against the wind.
He makes the connection -
At some point during the evening when Sherlock peeks out from under the blanket, there is a steaming hot cup of tea on the side of the sofa. He wants to tell John
Greg was Mycroft’s only friend.
John laughed, shaking his head, calling out behind him as he ran out of the hall. “No, that proves his innocence!”
“Quite a few I’d’ve thought.” John replied, words slurred, stifling a yawn. “But I don’t care, I’m tired, I want to sleep.” He wasn’t even sure that Sherlock was interested in anything of the sort, considering the first and last time they spoke on the matter, Sherlock said girls weren’t his area, and neither were boys.
He gave her a cheeky grin. “That was last year.”
Sherlock forced himself to look up. “John, what’s my favourite colour?”
Her face reddened slightly under her foundation, she was ringing her wrists behind her back thinking he couldn’t see. “Oh uh…”
“How’re you feeling, Sherlock?” Greg had dropped his hand the moment the door opened, now standing up. Guilt struck him again as the question hadn't even crossed his mind, he just opted for the knowledge that he’d be able to tell immediately. Now it seemed as though Greg cared more than he did.
“I know you’ve forgotten, and I know you aren’t expecting anything but I did get you something for your birthday. If you want it that is. I know due to your financial circumstances left to you by your parentage it was never an option but… You have looked into, uh.” Sherlock faltered. “Top surgery, haven’t you?.” He spoke, his words were slow and carefully chosen.
“Sorry, thinking, put the kettle on would you?” Sherlock asked, standing up, and going in search of John’s laptop.
His stomach sank when he realised he’d inevitably have to explain his reasoning.
“Right.”
He came out moments later, jumper in his hand, looking pleased as all get out, chest flat underneath the shirt that he was too self-conscious to wear on its own.
Sherlock smiled at him, bringing Johns hand in his to his mouth, kissing his knuckles. “Very.”
“Mother, Father, is Sherlock with you?” Mycroft asked, and their smiles quickly faded and John’s heart began to beat in his throat.
"I can't th-think when you-" He gripped a handful of Sherlock's hair as his body tensed. "You- You already know." John stammered, groaning the last word as Sherlock used the flat of his thumb to jerk him off. Sherlocks face was glistening as a result of the doctors arousal. It was hot.
He’d sat on the bed by the time John had turned around, the hoodie baggy enough as to not show anything.
“Yes, it was. Observant aren’t you?”
Two sugars found their way into the small ceramic mug he’d bought her when they were on a case in Brighton, the childish motif of the three bears had caught his eye due to it’s striking resemblance to a mug he’d had as a boy.
“Because I am partially to blame.” Sherlock replied, his voice filled with more sincerity than he could remember having ever before.
His eyes scanned the crowds, trying to read them and their motives as a means of easing the tension in his throat. Some of them looked utterly ridiculous, faces painted with the colours of their house, signs made to support their favourite team member. Somehow it seemed to bring warmth to his chest to see everyone so riled up and excited.
enjoyyyy
“Why would I? I can tell that its certainly not mine, so I have no reason, nor right.”
“What d’you mean wrong?” John tilted his head slightly, much like a dog.
“Hold tight, I’ll be back in a second.” Sherlock replied, walking down the stairs as quickly as he’d come up them.
Sherlock stopped for a brief moment, turning to his desk again and scribbling something down on a sticky-note. He pressed it to John’s chest, and the shorter man’s hand instinctively went over his, holding it there. “Here, my personal number, I prefer to text and I do like coffee. Evening.”
“John, mind if I sit?” A boy he knew by the name of Mike Stamford asked, peeking his head through the glass door.
is wrong with you! You were fine mere moments ago, and from my knowledge, its not your time of the month.” The anger had been sudden. Mycroft knew Greg to be more impulsive than he was, but never manic in his decisions or emotions. So, this came from nowhere, and he was confused to say the least.
John didn’t know how to reply. His head was spinning, and he knew Sherlock knew it. How
“I’m glad, this chair is a pain in the ass.” He smiled again as Greg laughed as quietly as he could manage
“Yes, boring, shake hands and make nice, now get out of my room.” Sherlock ordered, waving a hand in Mycroft’s general direction.
He sat on the kerb by the green. They used to play rugby and football on that grass, childhood friends that had drifted apart since he’d moved to Hogwarts. They’d told everyone he got a sports scholarship to a boarding school. He’d been fairly good at rugby in primary school, captain of the team, popular with the girls. He got a lot of attention, he was good at his subjects, he was breezing through it all.
“Lockie? You gonna kiss goodnight?” Rosie asked in the dim lit bedroom. She was still able to make out Sherlock’s lean figure in the darkness.
sorry for the wait. school has me dead.
enjoy!
Dampness clung to his hair, signifying that he’d just come back from a shower after Quidditch practice. The winter game was coming up soon and there was a lot of pressure on Greg to do well, he nearly missed the snitch in their last game.
Sherlock laughed. It was genuine, and it vibrated through the shorter boy as he was pressed against him.
“I'm fine.” His response was indignant.
The grey-haired teenager looked at him confused, so he lifted his hand, waving it a little to emphasise his point.
“With the amount of questions you ask, it’s a wonder you’re still such a gormless pillock.”
She’d been told in little detail some of the stories from their cases. As an attempt to embarrass the older man John had told her about their Buckingham visit, but much to the doctor’s dismay that only caused her to hold Sherlock in higher regard.
He could have thrown up when it came back red and sticky and he noticed it pooling in the grass, feeling ill as he fixated on it soaking into the dirt as Greg lay there. With shaking hands he tore the fabric of his own shirt, ripping the sleeve off of the body, sliding it off his arm and wrapping it around the seeker's head, in an attempt to slow the bleeding.
pains.” Sherlock spoke, after a moment of drinking their tea in silence.
Greg put a hand on his shoulder, not gripping tight enough to hurt, but firm, grounding him, holding him in place. “Stop. Stop talking, you’re getting worked up, just breathe alright?” He gave John a look and the younger boy nodded, closing his mouth and taking a slow breath through his nose. “She should get expelled for that, that
“Tell me to stop if you need. I won’t take it to heart.”
“Okay fine, yes, I am grateful, you know that Father. Thank you, goodbye.”
“Exactly. The same way me and Lestrade are, but if I had to ask Greg for help, I’d sooner shoot myself.”
“Why would I do that?”
“Yes, I will also
Finally, after enough deliberating and muttering to itself, the hat perked up again. “Oh, thank god- RAVENCLAW!” An applause went up from the blue table, and Mycroft too found himself clapping. Ravenclaw suited Sherlock, somehow more than the others, though Mycroft had little to no doubt that it was due to the colours over anything else.
Sherlock sighed, squeezing his eyes shut, and pressing his fingers into his eyes as he did so. He’d already had this class for a period in the morning, and now he had to suffer with them for two more on a Friday afternoon.
He did his best to ignore the stares as the marched through the Ravenclaw commons, before it got too much and his last resort came to taking a book from his bag and hurling at the wall, expression blank, mouth wordless, narrowly missing the head of Victor Trevor.
it for you, I told you I’d help.”
Mycroft had been talking since they met in fourth year about his father putting him into a job at the ministry.
He was glad to have the captain back. He’d gone to visit the older boy a few times in the hospital wing, it was pretty clear to him that he appeared like some snot-nosed kid, tailing after this seventh year. He felt that way sometimes too, but Greg was probably his only friend apart from Sherlock, he always treated John as his equal. His visits gave Mycroft a break to dart back to the commons if he needed or go for a walk, so they were welcomed. But he was just happy to start off practice once again, flying was one of the only things that could clear his head, where he could channel his pent-up energy, anxiety, fear, worry, whatever, into something useful.
“Well I told you I’d show you, so this is it.” Mycroft spoke, making a half-hearted gesture. This wasn’t really how he’d planned it to go down, trust Sherlock to ruin that. “Nothing too dangerous, well, nothing that can hurt you if you’re careful.”
He didn’t go down to dinner when the rest of the boys vacated the dorms, instead choosing to lie back and collect himself, not quite sleeping again but almost there, if he just relaxed a little more.
“Don’t insult me, I know when you’re lying Gregory.”
So he wasn’t too thrilled at the idea of having to do that again.
John didn’t take issue with the fact itself. In fact, it was quite pleasant to wake up with somebody beside him. Especially somebody he knew was not just another fling. It was comfortable.
Fuck that was incredible.
“Yes, because bloody fanged roses are perfectly harmless.” Greg replied, keeping his distance from them as much as he could in the slightly squashed greenhouse. The prefect wanted to make the comment that the roses were perfectly clean, the last time they’d drawn blood was when they’d been planted, and Mycroft had been careless enough to take off his gloves anywhere near them.
“John? Are you okay?” He asked after a moment, John wiped the tears away from his face and straightened up, sniffing, but there was a smile on his face, a
“Fancy.” John muttered.
“Daddy!” A small voice came from down the hall and John sighed softly, a smile creeping onto his face at the sound of his daughter’s voice, and he quickly made his way to her room.
“Really?”
They talked about quidditch and how work was going for Greg and what John was planning to do further in school. Greg gave advice and eventually they got talking about Rugby. It was good to talk about something other than magic with somebody because he was a muggleborn with an aloof family.
He wasn’t sure how much he believed her on that last one, but he appreciated the compliment nonetheless.
“Thanks, Myc. No promises though.”
“I’m in a fourth-year class for transfiguration.” Sherlock deadpanned.
Greg managed a hex that forced him to only speak in rhyme, and he in turn bewitched Greg’s tongue to interrupt him whenever it pleased.
“Right.”
Mycroft nodded to nobody other than himself. “You’re possibly dehydrated, there’s water on the table to your left. Do you need help sitting up?”
They walked to the park hand in hand, as she babbled on about what she’d read about ducks in school, the sweetcorn now in a zip-lock bag in the pocket of her yellow raincoat. He didn’t really understand her fascination with them, ducks as far as he knew were vile creatures. Then again, she generally had a fixation on all things yellow, even if ducks weren’t, outside of story books.
“What kind of idiot do you take me for?”
He’d tried his best to be more polite in the beginning, and gradually ease John into the mess that would be life with him, if he did choose to stay.
“Here, around two, next Saturday. It’ll be after quidditch practice.” Lestrade asked, his expression smug but the excitement and anxiety creeping up Sherlock’s spine was enough distraction for him to ignore it.
John told himself not to get used to it, but still enjoy it while it lasted.
Mycroft removed his face from his hands. “Well I suppose I should get it over with. He is not going to be happy about this.” The grave look on his face told John something more than that he was worried about himself. A feeling in his gut told him that Sherlock would somehow be involved.
The Gryffindor was hyperventilating now. “I can’t do it Sh-Sherlock- I can’t b-breathe- I just- I don’t- I-I-“
"You know perfectly well. So tell me what it was."
“I told you, I don’t care. What happened this morning didn’t mean anything to me.” Sherlock spoke, when John turned from the TV to look at him, he was met with the pale green. “Stop worrying about it.”
“I don’t see why not?”
Sarah had done something then, not him. She’d hurt him, he wasn’t sure if it was physical or verbal just yet, maybe she used his mum in some way. Was she really that evil? Maybe not, her style was oblivious manipulation, not outright hurt. Mistake then. Either way, John wasn’t alright about it. Sherlock chose instead to change the subject. “Suit yourself. Class was awfully dull without you. Though my chat with Anderson certainly spiced the day up a bit.”
“Your binder. You’ll be wearing the green one, the black one is dry for tomorrow, and I’ll wash the white one for you today.” Sherlock replied, taking a seat on the side of the bed, beside him, watching fondly as he took the mug of tea in a shaky hand.
He’d just won the first quidditch game of the year, and he was hugging his boyfriend.
Greg’s smile disappeared. Had he? He thought he was better at hiding it. There worst part of it all was that it wasn’t even from training at work.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, one hand resting just below where John's shirt ended, he used the other to unbutton John's dress shirt, as he began to move gently. He enjoyed how John's breaths synchronised with his thrusts.
“So scary.” Mycroft muttered, taking his hand and squeezing it before lying down, the grass was cool beneath him, and the warm summer air was cut through by a gentle breeze. He allowed his head to stop turning for a moment to appreciate the simplicity that a summer day seemed to bring.
“Whoah, easy, it was hearsay from Myc.”
“My violin is over there, if you’d like to look at it. Do you play?” Sherlock gestured to where his violin sat, by a music stand with a few sheets in it.
She gave him a look and rolled her eyes. “What’re we gonna tell Clara?”
“Me, then.” John replied, and when Greg didn’t say anything he looked to the floor. “That’s it, then. Greg I get that we’re mates and that you’re older, but you don’t have to babysit me. Just ‘cause my dad can’t be assed with me doesn’t mean you’re obligated to.” He spoke, and Greg felt the guilt pile in his stomach, he’d meant the gesture to be comforting, not smothering or pitiful.
“He’s my only friend, if you think for a second I will leave his side while he’s still in pain, for something as meagre as sleep, you are sorely mistaken.” He didn’t look up at her, his leg was jittering, he was still missing a sleeve off his shirt and all he could do was keep his focus on Greg, in a childlike fear that he’d miss something if he looked away.
He knew he was being ridiculous, he’d get up tomorrow and they’d let him out to get his stuff, and he’d go to classes with John (John would have said yes to having classes with him, it was just the way his moral’s operated). But this was the day they’d usually sneak out to the forest, and John would laugh at his inability to fly, and he’d insult John back until they were in a fit of giggles, but he couldn’t do that anymore. Not now, maybe not ever again.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” She replied, her expression turning coy as the anger faded into panic, staring around her at everybody staring.
you did.”
Sherlock didn’t reply, but the way he placed his vacant hand on John’s leg told him he understood, or at least he hoped that was the gesture.
John let out an exasperated huff. “Fine, maybe I was. What’s it to you?”
“It runs in the family.”
Greg was quite surprised, just like he’d been the first time after the quidditch match. When Mycroft had told him that he didn’t mind hugging it was usually Greg that initiated it from then on. Most times it was after a particular draining quidditch practice, when everything in his body was spent but the stress bottled up in it, then he’d find Mycroft and ask to be held. So, when the prefect hugged him on his own volition, it was a special occasion.
Greg caught the snitch in a tumble of glory, and the crowd clicked back into full gear as an uproar of applause cried out over the pitch.
"Sherlock and I are gonna head off, its past his bedtime." John replied, and Greg laughed.
“Sherlock.” It was John. John was in the Ravenclaw commons at midnight, for no apparent reason. “Come on, mate, get up.”
.” Sherlock paused, standing up. “ You seem to think more than others, Doctor. Seven o’clock, Baker Street, the address is 221b. Take the umbrella.” He gave John a wink and the click of his tongue, before showing the doctor out now he’d finished his tea.
“Is she going to be expelled?” Mycroft asked after a moment of silence.
The younger boy was laid on his bed, eyes closed, and hands clasped together across his stomach, his shirt was open mostly for comfort, barely hanging onto his shoulders, his entire chest and midriff exposed to where his trousers were belted at his waist.
“I'm trusting you.” Mycroft replied, letting go of her hands, and allowing her to hug him.
Sherlock furrowed his brow, that didn’t make sense, nothing had happened that day to warrant an apology. Was he saying sorry for not really talking? That was ridiculous, yet so very John, for some reason that explanation didn’t sit right with him so he disregarded the assumption and opted to ask. “What for?”
“I’m only trying to help John.”
“That’s extraordinary.” John replied with a small laugh of surprise. “You know you’d be frowned upon for telling me that.”
