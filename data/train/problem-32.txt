'You sure the last bit wasn't made up as well?'
Mycroft sauntered out of the door, his posture straighter and his stride more energetic, as if distributing prosaic advice had buoyed his spirits. Sherlock resisted the urge to stick his tongue out at his departing back, settling instead for rolling his eyes as he eased himself to his feet.
‘Before everything.’ John teased the image from his grip, slipping it back between the pages of the book in which Sherlock had found it. ‘Moriarty, Mary, all that mess.’
Hard not to. God knew what strings he’d pulled to get Anderson his job back. Greg didn’t know, and nor did Anderson. It had just happened. Sherlock snapped his fingers, and it seemed the world shuffled around to make his wishes into reality.
A faint frown cinched Sherlock's brow, darkening the shadows that pressed their marks beneath his eyes. His clothes, casual and baggy, reminded John of finding Sherlock back in that bloody drug-den, high as a kite. At least this time, his gaze seemed clear of any stupor and no stubble lined his jaw. He may look tired and scruffy, but he was not nearly so unkempt: a disguise, then, rather than anything else.
‘Christ, Sherlock.’
‘So, wait. Who gets the money, then?’ He gestured to the blank TV screen. ‘That thing sold for over a million quid!’
'I'm not asleep.' Greg huffed a laugh, sitting up straighter and making room among the empties. 'Just comfortable. 'S a good pub. Good chairs. Good fire. Maybe I should rent somewhere with a fireplace?'
Darkness and light swirled across his vision, daubed with smears of colour. Snatches of sound rang in his ears as time stretched away from him, pulled thin only to clot anew. He skimmed the interface between sleep and wakefulness, locked in dreamlike confusion, but through it all he sensed Sherlock right there, within arm's reach. Just like he'd promised.
Sherlock shoved the door open, him and John moving in unison. There was no space to stand to either side of the top of the stairs, so their only choice was to lunge forward. Sherlock smacked the light-switch even as John jerked his gun in a sweeping arc across the room, snapping it up to take aim at the figure frozen over near the familiar, scarred wooden table. A laptop, one of Sherlock’s, cast its glow on her face, and furious bile burned the back of John's throat at the sight of the woman before him.
John narrowed his eyes, trying to understand the jagged edge to Sherlock’s voice. He sounded desperate, as if there was something at stake that John couldn’t see. Yet he didn’t do what he’d done to Moriarty. He didn’t compel John to move, even though it would get the quickest results.
Opening his eyes, John swallowed, wetting his parched throat as he took in the sight of Sherlock in front of him. The sheet had pooled across Sherlock's thighs, luxurious cotton against silky soft skin, pale everywhere except where it flushed dark with want: lips and nipples and the proud arousal between Sherlock's legs. John's mouth watered, and he reached out, his fingers circling Sherlock's heft and feeling his heat as he gave him a single, firm stroke from root to tip.
He cocked his head, realising Sherlock's sleep-rough voice had come from the bedroom. He'd been working a case – nothing too dangerous or difficult – but engaging enough to catch his interest for the past few days. John had feared that the Work would hold the same, all-encompassing thrall as it did before, but he had been pleasantly surprised. Sherlock would never keep regular hours, but he made an effort. He brought files home rather than lingering at the morgue or in the Yard, and tried to remember he couldn't always just dash off when he had the answer.
'Oh, what's the matter?' she asked, her smile all teeth. 'You're not squeamish, are you, Sherlock?'
A hint of salt danced across his tongue as he lapped at Sherlock's pulse, chuckling darkly at the harsh gasp of indrawn air he elicited. He and Sherlock had explored one another's bodies, charting every ridge and hollow, and still this was as intoxicating as that very first time. Heat and want crackled in his belly, sharp like glass, and he gently sucked, adoring Sherlock's trembling cry at the contrast of rasping friction and the nip of teeth.
‘All right.’
Not when Sherlock was smiling down at his phone screen, soft and content in way John had never thought he’d witness.
'A small consolation. I'd rather have information on what they're planning.'
‘You made that up!’ John’s cheeks ached with the effort of hiding his grin. Sherlock’s face at his accusation was a priceless sight. The cocktail of outrage and disbelief made him look constipated. In fact, it rather strengthened the resemblance between him and Mycroft.
Those silver eyes met his own, bright with reluctant certainty. 'It was Mary.'
John pulled a face. His cooking was basic squaddy stuff. Sausages and mash. Baked beans on toast. He could cobble together a stew if he had to, and pasta offered no challenge, but it wasn't as if he were plating up gourmet food every night. Not that Sherlock complained. He assumed the mad bugger knew how to cook, but he'd never seen him do it. The fact he was making an effort in the name of John regaining his strength was... Well, it was brilliant, actually.
With a gusty sigh, Sherlock raked his hands through his curls, glancing at the clock on the oven. His back ached from hunching over the files and photographs. Lunch was a distant memory, and the light seeping through the windows had taken on the syrupy quality of late afternoon.
Not that he had to go. Since they became a couple, those brief moments of Sherlock’s thoughtfulness had been far more frequent, and he had graciously invited John to sit this one out. Maybe he would have, except he knew how Sherlock could terrorise the staff of Harrods without saying a word – ears pointed, tail-lashing, canines bared in just a fraction of a sneer – and they fell over themselves to please. At least he had been able to spare them the worst of that.
The first bite of his Snickers tasted wonderful, and he scoffed it quicker than was polite. Buying a bottle of coke to wash the claggy texture of chocolate from his mouth, he took a sip before screwing the cap on tight and putting it in his coat pocket. Its weight made the fabric drag at his shoulders, but the rush of sugar and caffeine was more than worth it, chasing back the weary cobwebs that hazed his mind.
He had watched, in the weeks since the pandemic exploded across the world stage, how John's stress increased with each passing day. He tried to hide it, of course, concealing his concerns behind smiles that never reached his eyes, but Sherlock was not fooled.
John's face shuttered, his eyes turning dark and hard as he acknowledged the slew of images that carried both himself and his daughter as their subject. The sheer number suggested they had been under twenty-four-hour watch, an uncomfortable thought for anyone, but one Sherlock could imagine was doubly vexing for a soldier like John. The implied threat within Harmattan's actions was impossible to ignore, but where they had sought to document every moment of John's life, they had not done the same to Mary.
‘It’s about the people, not their assets. They did not “attack” the expensive, mass produced jewels. They went for the pocket-watches, which are made on-site. Each one’s unique. Look into family enemies. Ex-lovers, estranged offspring… that sort of thing. The owner was hit where it hurt, and it was not in the finances.’
Scrambling in his pocket for his phone, he typed as quick as he could, his fingers fat and clumsy as the knot of panic left him.
'I don't think he is. He's –' Molly frowned before casting the rest of her thought away. 'Never mind about Sherlock. You think someone's watching you?'
‘I don’t suppose you know what happened in Cairo?’ Greg asked, grimacing as John shook his head. He appeared to chew over his words, his expression full of sympathy as he met John’s gaze. ‘You’ll keep an eye on him, yeah?’
He blinked, wetting his lips and squinting as he tried to remember the question. 'My head,' he managed at last, 'and my legs. Joints. Just...' He sighed, knowing he was giving Sherlock nothing more to go on than general malaise. 'I think I'm going back to bed.'
John turned, and Sherlock hid his wince at the dark shadows underneath those downcast eyes. Blond hair stood up in all directions, a testament to his restless night. His skin held a grey cast, and his movements were shuffling and stiff as he approached the kitchen island, carrying two mugs of tea with care.
‘Four broken bones. God, that wanker really did a number on your arm.’
Molly hadn't been with Mary when she called. She'd captured Molly's distress on tape and played it to him, knowing neither he nor Sherlock would be able to stay at Baker Street and allow their friend to come to harm. She'd acted, not to lure John in, but to get him out of the way.
Then came Mike and Molly, a pair despite all their differences. Most people would have turned Sherlock away from their respective domains – lab and morgue alike. False pride made many professionals defensive, and few welcomed such an intrusion.
The furniture was meticulously clean, he noticed. The wood glowed and the glass gleamed, especially the tall, narrow case by the window. In it, a sword in a scabbed hung upon a stand: a sabre, judging by the curve of it. John was no expert, but it looked like the kind of thing you saw in museums.
And then all that turned out to be a lie: a fiction and a fantasy Mary had constructed in the hopes of escaping her past. She'd built a future with John, but had never told him who she was. What she was. If it hadn't been for Sherlock, there was a good chance he'd never have known. Mary wouldn't have volunteered the information, never in a million years. John knew her well enough to believe that.
'Let me guess,' he drawled, leaning on a desk for support. 'The splinter group has seen fit to put in an appearance?'
Was it possible? Of course. Sherlock may have turned a blind eye to many of Mary's qualities for fear of what he would really see, but he had never doubted her determination. She saw what she wanted, and she got it, no matter the cost.
God, what was wrong with him?
Maybe that was why, even now, he second-guessed what she said. Just because she gave him purpose – gave him hope – didn't mean she was right. Who should he believe? Mary, dead and gone and free of any consequences – or John, alive and lost within the tempest of his own, complicated grief?
Narrowing his eyes, he curved his hand over his mouth as he considered his discovery. Rather than offering answers, the files seeded more questions. It was, he suspected, only half the picture.
Mycroft reached into his pocket, pulling out a familiar, sleek black device. A cobweb of cracks burst across the dead screen, and the case had split to reveal the guts of its circuitry: Sherlock's phone. Someone had brought their boot heel down on it and then seemed to have run it over for good measure. They would get nothing of use from it.
She sighed, a world-weary noise like a mother who was tired of her toddler throwing an unnecessary tantrum. 'Well, at least I tried. Perhaps this will change your mind.'
With a blink, he reconnected more fully with his surroundings. He had been aware of them every step of the way, his instincts standing sentry in case of any threat. Now he realised that the sun had risen, gilding the city in its gleam. The traffic on the roads grew more dense as the early commuters tried to beat the morning rush to work, and on his right the vast sprawl of Kensington Gardens lay, sparkling with dew.
'Of course. Stay in touch, Sherlock.'
He disconnected the call, knowing that if he didn’t, they ran the risk of the whole conversation devolving into an argument. John seemed to live on the knife-edge of his temper these days, not that Sherlock could blame him, but the added layer of sentiment made the current situation all the more difficult. He only hoped that John's desire to take care of Rosie exceeded his own stubborn resistance to accepting Sherlock's help.
It had been an all-consuming rage, rooted in pain and anguish and all the stronger for having been nurtured through so many long months of deception. Yet looking back, he could see it mattered.
'Very well. There have been no developments of any note within London. In fact, there has been little activity from those who were watching John Watson at all. Whether they are awaiting additional orders or merely planning their next move, I cannot be certain.'
'Got it.'
Perhaps Sherlock had them too.
'Mary?' He spoke softly, knowing the echoes would carry his voice. It bounced up to the roof, startling a pair of roosting pigeons, but otherwise there was no response to his call. John cleared his throat, not allowing his circling doubts to encroach. He knew he was in the right place, and he had got here in time, though admittedly only just. Yet all that awaited him was this empty, hollow space and a growing dread that filled his chest and tried to climb up into his mouth.
'You could say that. There is no autopsy report for Mary. None at all.'
'Piste?'
‘I doubt any toxins will get in through the skin. Also, a small amount is unlikely to do much damage. Look at him.’ He gestured to the hapless victim, a man who looked like he’d put on weight over a short period of time. ‘I suspect he’s been sampling the merchandise as he worked. Sugar is as addictive as any drug. A licked finger here becomes a spoonful with his coffee there, and before he knows it, he’s drinking straight from the bottle.’
'Probably. Mary was a clever woman, well-trained and disciplined, with a vested interest in keeping her secrets buried not just from her enemies, but her friends as well.' Sherlock sucked honey from his thumb, his gaze distant and his frown thoughtful. 'It's what I'd do. Something hidden in plain sight. Something that requires specialist knowledge to even attempt to decode. Whatever she has concealed is valuable, at least to Mary.'
'But there was nothing there?'
'No. What is perhaps more unexpected is that Mary was observed, more than once, meeting with the individuals who had you under surveillance: members of the Harmattan splinter group. That implies a somewhat closer working relationship than Mary indicated. My sources say the conversations were tense, but not antagonistic. Not yet, anyway.'
With a sigh, John took the first step towards the door, then the next. Gradually, they left behind the chlorine heavy air and stepped out into London’s smog. God, he hoped he wasn’t making a mistake. It was one thing to get tangled up with a half-mad flatmate, but quite another to throw your lot in with the Fae.
No, he would concentrate on Rosie, his daughter, because at least when it came to that he knew what he was doing. She was a known quantity, and for her sake, he'd keep going. Even when it felt like the only one who belonged in the ground was him.
'Are you forgetting this?' He held up the DVD Mary had left him, the one where she had urged him to tear himself apart in the name of saving John.  'An individual driven out of their marriage by a third party – even an imagined threat such as myself – would not have sent a message like this.'
Every garment was new, from her knickers to her shoes and jeans: tags ripped off and disposed of as she shrouded herself in their anonymity. Even the ambulance didn't technically exist. Its plates pointed nowhere. It had been nothing more than an unmarked van twenty-four hours ago. Now, it was her ride to the start of a new life.
'Will do. Look after Molly.'
At least Mycroft's people seemed kind. He'd feared they'd be distant and impersonal in their fine suits, but the pair – a man and a woman – were all warm, genuine smiles and honest reassurances. They spoke to John as if they understood and treated Rosie like a person rather than an objective. It put John's mind at rest, but his heart still cracked clean in two when they drove off.
The operatives sprang into action, moving in an odd half-crouch as they dispersed from Sherlock's sight. His leg throbbed fiercely, radiating pain down to his knee and up to his hip. He clenched his teeth, prepared to force his way through the discomfort, but John had other ideas.
‘Yep.’ Greg had his arms folded, practically hugging himself. All of them, even Sherlock, were wearing all the body coverings for forensics. None of them could afford a fuck up, not on a case like this: a media wet-dream.
'And if he didn't?'
For now, at least.
'I was checking in with one of my network out in the alley behind the building, making sure I was up to speed. I've double-checked the windows and doors downstairs. All are closed and locked. Beyond that, there is only so much we can do to secure the place.'
'Oh, you want to look at those, do you?' John asked, knowing full well that Rosie couldn't care less about them, but if she would be quiet while he studied them then he would take the opportunity. 'Let's see what we've got, shall we?'
Sherlock made a non-committal sound, still unwilling to give all of his theories voice. Yet he kept thinking back to that day at the aquarium, to the pertinent details that his mind had stored only to regurgitate later. More than anything, he could not help but recall how Mary had stepped into the bullet's path, as graceful as a prima-donna taking spotlight on the centre stage.
A shrill ringing clanged in John's ears, crying in a banshee's wail as he pressed his cheek to the unforgiving concrete. He had thrown his arms over his head: a desperate effort, and now he curled in on himself, cringing away from the debris he knew must be falling down around him. Pain beat its drum in his skull, and every breath he took tasted of smoke and ash, underscored by the bright, greasy tang of blood.
For the first time in his life, Sherlock
John's grip shifted, his thumb brushing over Sherlock’s knuckle as if he were some animal that needed soothing. Perhaps he was. He could feel a wildness in him, something riding the crest of a wave, desperate to survive but terrified of the fall he felt sure awaited him. 'What about what you want?'
‘It’s a bit bloody American, isn’t it?’ Lestrade muttered, glaring at the Halloween decorations that festooned Knightsbridge. In this part of the city there was a lot more money than sense, and even Harrods had filled their windows with pumpkins: each exquisitely carved.
Fear clenched icy fingers through the cage of Sherlock's ribs, rattling his bones with every breath, but he refused to succumb. Panic would get him nowhere, and it would certainly not help John.
They had all the time in the world.
'And you have more traumatic things to dream about than most,' Sherlock finished, tilting his head and raising an eyebrow. A flicker of something – regret, maybe? – arced across his face, but it was gone before John could focus on it. 'I should take your temperature again.' He tilted his wrist to check his watch. 'You can also have some more paracetamol, if you like?'
Of course, there was a chance Mycroft had replaced them with some of his own, but John could not bring himself to care. He felt like he teetered on some brink. As if, now that he had reached the sanctuary of this place – a flat where, years ago, he had last known anything akin to true happiness – all the hasty walls around his heart were crumbling to nothing.
He wanted life to return to how it had once been. Before Mary's so-called death, before the bloody wedding... Further back than that, even. If he could excise Mary from his history like a tumour, he would. The only part he could never regret was Rosie's existence. Now, bitter with anger and disgust, he could not say the same for the woman who had been his wife.
A bitter wind smacked them in the face as they swept out into a quadrangle, surrounded by stone arches and sheltered pathways that reminded John of ancient cloisters. He huddled in his jacket, eyeing the gleaming constructions all around.
They did not use each other's to avoid cross-contamination, and they had a pump to prevent either of them touching the cream not being used. It seemed like such a small thing, but John had found himself grateful more than once when he saw the state of his colleagues’ poor fingers and palms, sore from constant rounds of hand sanitiser and soap and latex.
'Perhaps. However, I feel that we may have been overwhelmed by the volume and revelations of the other files. There is a slew of information pertaining to AGRA, and the encoded folder was well concealed amidst them: vaguely named without being nonsense and therefore suspicious. Easily overlooked.' Sherlock lowered himself to sit at John's side, indifferent to the stains he might get on his clothes. Plucking a daisy from the lawn, he tickled Rosie's cheeks with its petals, smiling at her laughter.
Sherlock shifted from side-to-side as theories sparked across his mind before being dismissed just as quickly. Various cultures and religions ascribed different colours to the primary directions, but Mary had spent most of her adult life operating in a sphere that could be described as military. She would not go for an obscure, esoteric answer when she had a logical one to hand. 'North is marked in red on most compasses. The red numbers will be for the north-facing side.'
John barked a mirthless laugh, shaking his head and rolling his shoulders in a shrug. 'I've finally lost my fucking mind.' He held out the photos, jabbing his finger at the figure caught in the background of the frame. 'Tell me that's not who it looks like. Tell me I'm seeing things.' His voice hitched on the plea, strained over the fretful flutter of his heart. It wasn't hope he was feeling. It should be, but it wasn't.
say when it's over, John, not you, or Mycroft,' she snarled down the open phone line. 'You've run out of options. The file. Now. Or Sherlock dies.' Her finger tightened on the trigger, her knuckle bleached white with restrained pressure. Mary didn't bluff. They all knew that by now. In her eyes, this was a means to an end. Nothing more and nothing less.
At first, nothing happened. Sherlock was bloody miles away, but within a minute the chopsticks descended with expert precision. Before Greg knew it, Sherlock had eaten a fair amount, all on autopilot. It was sad, in some ways, that his body seemed to be taking advantage of his mental distraction to sustain itself, but hey, it was better than watching him starve himself as the case dragged on.
Now, she leaned back against a nearby desk, turning a burner-mobile over in one hand while the pistol hung from the other. She stared at Sherlock. On one level, she would be watching him, but on another he doubted she saw him at all. Her thoughts had taken her elsewhere, and any gleam of triumph that may have lit her features was instead replaced with a waxy pall.
'I expect we can manage that. It's probably for the best. I have no idea if there's anything left in the fridge.'
'Mary expects both myself and, I suspect, the splinter group. Her inviting us so promptly to her location implies she knows they are on the move. You, John, are the only unknown in all this: the single factor of which Mary cannot be certain, and that is a natural advantage. We will distract her with both our presence and by taking control of the CCTV network. You must take that opportunity to get to Sherlock. Once that is done, you should leave the rest to us.'
Sherlock never understood the need for people to make themselves acceptable to others. He was perfectly aware that he came across as cold, abrupt, macabre and cruel. If that was all people ever saw, well that was their own fault for not looking deeper and observing the truth.
Sherlock opened his eyes to the meek dawn light that crept around the curtains, frowning as the details of the dream slipped through his fingers. Something nagged at him: not the emotional echoes of it, but some small, pertinent detail he had seen but not observed. It painted an accusation that his waking moments stole away from him.
'He knew you were trouble,' John murmured. 'He wasn't wrong about that.'
His eyes carried the glazed expression of a man whose focus had shifted inwards, and those thin lips were a chapped line of tension and misery. Grey shadows tinged that expressive face, and Sherlock frowned, deducing all the evidence John's appearance had to offer.
'Of course. Talk soon, John.'
John blinked at his glass gleaming empty in his hand before reaching for his wallet. ‘Here, my round this time.’
John wet his lips, trying not to think about how people were mostly water. Could Sherlock simply freeze the blood in his veins? Here he was, holding a gun: a toy soldier doing its duty, and Sherlock could just flick a finger and kill him right there.
'Not for him or the baby.' Norbury's gaze pinned John in place, but if she had been hoping to shock him, she would be disappointed. Oh, Mary might claim she'd left to protect them, but John doubted that was her real reason. He would not allow himself the foolishness of hope. Not again. Mary had broken every promise she had made to him, a fact he would not forget in any hurry.
With a firm nod to himself, Sherlock retrieved his pyjamas, retreating into the bathroom to change. Nightfall was hours away, but any normal schedule had long ago fallen by the wayside. The both of them were at the mercy of John's body and its whims. Need awoke them and need lay them both to rest. He would not doubt get better sleep if dressed for the endeavour.
It started with the scent of coffee, rich upon the air. The shadows lessened, their veils drawing back as the occasional lamp pocked the darkness. A rickety desk, lashed with rope to offer it support, stood in the centre of an empty room, and various screens glowed from where they perched on its surface.
Had she truly spared his life with the placement of her bullet? He doubted it. More than likely, her precision had been affected by a rush of sentiment. Not for Sherlock himself – the friendship they had managed at that point was wary at best – but for John.
'Maybe,' he acknowledged. 'But I can't stay here. I need...' He cleared his throat and shook his head, trying to explain. 'I need something that's just me. Mary's not been at work with me for months, now. Here, she's everywhere.' He pointed his finger at the floor, indicating the flat. 'There, it's just me and my colleagues and my patients.' He gave a single firm nod, wondering who he was trying to convince. Molly looked as doubtful as he felt, one eyebrow lifting in a perfect curve of disbelief.
John nodded. 'I don't know much about it, but Mycroft had cosmetic surgery to look human. Something to do with his career. It's part of why he and Sherlock are like... that.' He waved his fork around, indicating the bizarre cocktail of fury and protectiveness that hovered around the pair like a cloud whenever they found themselves in the same room.
Miraculous.
John was at work, and the flat loomed empty. No experiments scintillated his mind, and no case emerged to distract him. Normally, he turned to music for release, but his violin lay mute in his grasp, neglected as he pondered his inability to play.
‘No, it’s bloody not,’ he muttered. ‘He treats what you do like a – a party trick – or a con. But at the same time, he’s coming to you for help. Two-faced, arrogant, stuck-up…’ He pursed his lips, biting back the litany of insults.
He had not seen her so sprightly in her step for months, and Sherlock knew that her presence was another piece of the foundation on which John was slowly rebuilding his existence. She may not be their housekeeper, but Mrs Hudson was part of their lives, and from the sounds of it, she was thrilled at the prospect of having John and Rosie as tenants.
Lastly, he placed the TV remote at John's side and set about plugging in various cables. It was not state of the art, their little telly, but it was better than nothing. Besides, Mrs Hudson had hooked the whole property up to Freesat, which at least meant a good number of channels to choose from, even if it was mostly reruns. The screen flickered to life, and John began his search for something he could watch: something that required no concentration and, with any luck, would take his mind off how damn wretched he felt.
She stayed on the play mat for almost half an hour, intrigued by the new input before growing bored. As soon as that happened, John stopped what he was doing and gave her his full attention. At seven months old, she had learned how to commando crawl across the floor, and now Rosie set about exploring her surroundings with clumsy hands and beaming smiles. She'd be walking before long, which delighted and terrified John in equal measure.
No. No. It was for the case. John had nothing to do with it. John had made that clear from the moment Sherlock had crashed back into his life. Yet while his words – you fucking bastard! – said one thing, his actions said another.
She sucked in a breath, and there was true hate in her next words. 'When I met John Watson, he was a broken wreck of a man, and it was all your fault. You left a hole in his life that no one could fill. Not even me.'
'I doubt the flat will be much warmer.' Sherlock shouldered aside the door, hesitating before flicking on the hallway light. He was right, John realised, the entire building felt like a crypt. It had only been empty for a handful of days, but the chill had crept in. Well, bugger that. His life might be about to go spectacularly tits up, but he was not about to freeze to death in the process.
'As long as it responds to medication,' Sherlock pointed out, offering John the blister pack of paracetamol for the second time that day. 'There's a glass of water on your bedside table. What else do you need?'
Mary's knowledge of codes had been the first indication that she was more than she seemed, but her preferences lay in complex ciphers. John was a military man: a doctor and a front-line combatant. Clear communication was key, and in those rare times encryption became necessary...
'Not unfamiliar, though,' John pointed out. Whatever else his wife may be, she was bloody clever. Not in the same way as Sherlock, all logic and deduction, but she was an expert in the art of secrecy. He shook his head to himself, still lingering on the strange, sharp edge between outright denial and raging accusation. He felt like he was swinging wildly from one to the other with every moment, with no stability in sight.
This time, things were different. He could see it in the tense line of Sherlock's shoulders and the way he moved: a tight, stalking pace back and forth, like a tiger trapped in a too-small-cage. He had spent hours plucking apart Mary's code, and each line they uncovered only cemented their certainties.
There were conversations, or perhaps merely memories of them: something about Moriarty and gunmen. Fear and helplessness. More than once John thought he was awake only to open his eyes to the blank ceiling above him. A moment later, he would be pulled under once more.
Bloody lethal.
'You hope.' The commander's tone carried a faint edge of resignation, as if she was more than used to throwing her life on the line in answer to beliefs, rather than certainties. 'Be sure, Mister Holmes. If there is a better way –'
John twitched, turning to stare at Sherlock in surprise and wincing as his pulse thudded hard against his ribs. He'd not noticed his approach, nor the way the quality of the light shifted around him as time crept ever onwards. The news report he had been watching had turned into a half-hearted film review by some obsequious idiot, and John hit the mute button to block out his nasal tones.
'She believes that whoever may take action against her if she were free is more of a cause for concern than anything that myself, Mycroft or the justice system may throw at her.' Shifting away to hear his thoughts over the seethe of the boiling kettle, Sherlock pointed his finger to the palm of his own hand, laying it out point-by-point.
'That would be the first evidence you have demonstrated, throughout the length of our acquaintance, of action born of malice rather than necessity.' Sherlock looked down at her, shaking his head. 'Perhaps that's what you would like us to believe, but it's just another lie. You left me this hoping I would do something dramatic: something that would capture all of John's attention, leaving neither of us with the time or inclination to look too closely at your so-called death.' He set the DVD down again with a decisive "snick" before stepping back. 'It would probably have worked, too, if John hadn't noticed your allies watching him and reached out for help himself.'
'You don't think it's a bit soon?' Molly's brow wrinkled, her dark eyes boring into him. He remembered her back when they first met, timid and overwhelmed by Sherlock's personality. God, she'd changed a lot. Now, she watched him, her chin at a stubborn angle, challenging as only someone he considered a friend would dare.
‘Size,’ Donovan said. ‘If it’s big, it’s a ship.’
‘Oh, god. That explains what happened to our victim’s eyes.’
Shaking himself free from his rapt reverie, John bit his lip and shifted around the back of the pillar. The lights had been turned off when the class ended, leaving only the piste bathed in the glow from the spots above. He needed to make use of that to get behind the idiot fighting Sherlock, and he had to do it without being seen. From there, he'd be ideally placed to take the fucker by surprise.
Sherlock grunted, his jaw clenched tight as he withdrew the handkerchief and refolded it, pressing the last bit of clean fabric to the gash. He reduced the pressure too, making sure any new clots wouldn’t be disturbed too badly when the dressing moved.
A moment later, he wished he could unsee it.
‘You’ve got that look on your face again,’ Greg teased, his dark eyes agleam and a crooked grin hooking his lips. ‘You’re going soft.’
‘You’ve believed stranger things,’ Sherlock pointed out, his indignation ebbing as he tilted his head, pinning John with that hungry, all-seeing gaze. ‘Why draw the line now?’
Yet the courage to speak of it always failed him. How many times had he parted his lips to utter... what? What could he say that would make John understand the strength and breadth of his emotion?
'I believe you.'
Mycroft’s hand clenched into a quick fist before he reached into his inside pocket, pulling free a single piece of paper. He handed it over to Sherlock with nothing but a nod of thanks. A moment later he was gone, striding out of the door of Baker Street as if his pants were on fire.
In the gloom, Sherlock's pale face seemed translucent, his eyes shards of starlight. A frown pleated his brow as those full lips parted in horror. He looked so real, and John's heart broke apart all over again, oozing raw, fresh grief into the cavern of his ribs.
She wasn't dead.
The silence was wrong. Gone was the comfortable peace that came from Sherlock’s voyages into his mind palace, or the quiet companionship they’d shared. There were no rustling clothes or chiming crockery. It was all too still: a home-cum-tomb, and John wanted to scream just to break the peace.
The things she could do if she set her mind to it... Dealing with Moriarty would be child’s play in comparison. That was why Sherlock found himself turning over aspects of every investigation in an effort to discern her touch.
'We will.'
The moment he both craved and feared had come upon him. Not, as he'd always assumed, in the whirlwind aftermath of a successful case when they were high on victory. Instead, it found him now, in this small oasis of calm certainty, and he knew that if he let it slip through his fingers, then it would be a moment he could never reclaim.
'You all right?' one of the paramedics asked. She didn't know his name. She never would. This wasn't about making friends.
'That's what I'm still trying to discern.' Sherlock watched him like a hawk, reading God-knew-what from every flicker of his features. How much did it cost him, John wondered, to keep his body so relaxed in the face of John's undeniable tension? He felt wound tight: a spring about to snap – a gun with a hair-trigger, liable to fire at any moment.
Perhaps, he mused, it would be his last gift to John: the information he needed to finally choose his freedom from the burden of their friendship.
John cut in, answering Anderson before Sherlock could say anything scathing. ‘More likely she touched them, then ate something without washing her hands. Maybe she got sap on her when she put them in the vase.’
'I'm fine,' Sherlock promised. 'I think he got off worse.' He jerked his head towards Townsend, who had a fine bruise blooming on his jaw.
‘Zero.’ The scrape of Sherlock’s chair on the tatty lino seemed loud after nothing but the pop of the fire and the tinkle of glassware. ‘It’s zero degrees centigrade. Not even that cold, on a global scale. It’s the humidity that makes it feel so much worse.’ He padded away, returning a moment later with something in his hands.
The rumble of the engine changed, going down the gears, and Sherlock rocked where he lay as the vehicle came to a halt. The slam of the doors echoed through his aching head, but he had the sense to realise that there were two sets of footsteps walking over tarmac, rounding the back of the truck.
He took a deep breath, setting Rosie's spoon down and tilting his head. 'Yeah. I'll – I'll be fine.' He looked down at his old, comfortable clothes, pursing his lips. 'I'll change.'
'Mycroft's people?'
'Straight to the point.' She sneered. 'No dramatics? How disappointing. I thought it ended rather well, last time.' Her eyes flickered to John, who stiffened, but he held his silence. He wouldn't rise to such obvious bait, and neither would Sherlock. 'Where did you come across that name?'
Over the next few days, everything changed.
John shrugged, his eyes glazed as if the effort of making such a decision were too much for him. Perhaps it was. He had been inundated with stress these past few weeks, buffeted by events and buried under an avalanche of revelations.
Something clenched under his ribs: not anger, for once, but a different kind of sorrow. He thought back over the course of his relationship with Mary, at how often Sherlock had spoken in such a way as to ease John's ire with his wife. He had blunted the sharpest edges of her betrayals with reasons that, at the time, John had seized gratefully.
The most telling conclusion was that the pictures dated further back than he had thought. Sherlock had believed this situation was a recent occurrence, something that had begun since Mary's passing. Now he could see they had been watching John long before that. Sherlock recognised the occasional location or a particular combination of clothes that John was wearing. Those pertinent details let him pinpoint the images to weeks, or sometimes months before Mary had succumbed to a bullet on the floor of the aquarium.
‘She is one of the best lawyers in the country: specialising in family law. She owes me a favour. A big one. Mention my name and she’ll help you. No charge.’
‘Hmmm?’ Sherlock blinked at him before glancing at the tv. ‘Oh.’
'Is Doctor Watson safe?'
John grunted, folding his arms over his chest. The gun dug into his back, but he'd rather spend the next hour uncomfortable than bring it out into plain sight. 'I wonder what it is?'
He should have stayed quiet in the den: let John come and go, none-the-wiser. Instead, he had heard that voice and perked up like a dog hearing its master.
'Including us.'
Perhaps that was why suspicion strafed its fingers over the back of his mind. Mary had been his friend. Against all his own expectations he had liked her, admiring her sharpness of wit and intelligence, but trust? No, they'd never managed that.
John spluttered, trying to argue as Sherlock bundled him into the taxi, but in the end, he didn’t protest too hard. He’d missed breakfast, and Sherlock was paying.
It was an old trick. Normally when he queried a suspect, they were all too happy to fill in the blanks. Some, however, the smart ones, had a tendency to turn it around. It was a test: a way to see if he was as good as his reputation suggested.
That, Sherlock assumed, was why no one had examined the ballistics. It was unnecessary to tie the gun to the scene, since Norbury had been clutching it, still smoking, in her slender hand. Now, he stared at the bloody bullet they had found on the floor: A through-and-through shot that had lost momentum before it had the chance to hit the opposite wall. It matched the weapon, but doubt's weight clouded his brow as he considered the logistics.
They had been there for years, those frail, spidery shoots of deeper sentiment. Now they bloomed, and Sherlock found himself lying awake at night, trying and failing to tear his mind from the man at his side.
'God, you've got it bad,' he murmured to himself, slipping into the flat and smiling when he saw Sherlock stretched out on the sofa like some kind of effigy. Long fingers pressed together in prayer, resting against his lips as he lost himself in the vast sprawl of his mind palace.
'And after Sasha?'
Sherlock took in each scene with care. There were not many of probably-Mary after her death: only two, both taken on the same day. The pictures focused on John and Rosie. Mary, on the other hand, was out of range of the camera's piercing gaze.
Sherlock pressed a cup of tea into his hands, and John guzzled it gratefully. Caffeine: an acceptable addiction. God, it was all so fucking arbitrary sometimes. From coffee to alcohol, nicotine to sugar – they could all have strange effects on the body and mind. Though, he had to admit, mostly they were locked firmly in the realms of sedatives or stimulants. The kid who had staggered into his surgery today…
‘And wrist,’ Sherlock added, shrugging his left shoulder. It would aggravate him no end in a day or two, of that he was certain. For now, though, he had good painkillers and John’s presence: his golden skin and ruby blood. His sapphire eyes and ivory bones. A veritable treasure trove bundled up in the form of his friend.
He felt he was disappointing them, somehow. Or that they thought he was being stoic in the face of terrible sadness. He couldn't tell them that all he felt was remorse: for not being more upset, for not grieving as he should, for deep-down being a little bit relieved that Mary was gone. He couldn't say that, not to them and not to anyone. How could he? He could barely admit it to himself.
'My brother is far from helpless.' Mycroft glanced at his watch before turning his head to survey the skimming motorway through the windscreen. 'If he is able to do so, he will already be formulating ways in which to turn the situation to his advantage.'
John tried not to scowl. What Suzie wanted, she got. John hated her on impulse, which was awful, really, considering Suzie was only seven. Still, she was a pain in his neck and she wasn’t even his!
Electrical shimmers snapped through John's body, and he bucked up helplessly, garbled apologies falling from his lips as Sherlock drew back lest he choke. Spots danced in the corner of John's vision as he tried not to come, one hand grasping fretfully at the root of his cock to stave off his release.
His heart leapt in his throat, thrumming with a volatile mix of terror and exhilaration. His grip around Sherlock’s wrist slackened, his fingers drifting over pale skin in a tremulous caress. It would be so easy to overthink this, to tie himself up in knots of uncertainty, but John did not give himself the chance to hesitate as he stretched up and brushed a warm, soft kiss against Sherlock’s lips.
Tentative, Sherlock reached out, rapping his knuckles on the door. A silhouette moved behind the frosted glass. Sherlock's heart surged in his throat, only to rip itself in two – simultaneous relief and disappointment – when it was Molly Hooper who greeted him with dark eyes and a grimacing smile.
Sherlock nodded, his understanding absolute. John had always been very aware of the propensity for alcohol addiction that ran in his family. As such, bar one or two occasions that Sherlock knew of, he did not drink alone for fear there would be nothing to stop him. Here, at least, he trusted Sherlock to help him stick to his limits.
'Mary placed her own bugs,' Sherlock explained, 'having first neutralised the ones others had left here with this short-range EMP device so as not to give away the details of her visit. We'll need to trigger it in every room to be certain, but any surveillance equipment in this area of the flat should now be offline permanently.'
Whoever hid behind the mask might have expected a struggle, but they clearly had not anticipated Sherlock's level of skill. Suddenly, all of the stranger's attention was focussed on Sherlock by necessity, locked into a brutal exchange of blows that made the room ring with the chime of steel-on-steel.
'The splinter group's surveillance operations are, obviously, a distraction,' Sherlock pointed out. 'All this time they have made very little effort to hide themselves from sight. It makes sense that many of their tactics have been designed to deliberately unsettle those that they are watching. However, it also forces their quarry to underestimate them.'
There was no doubt that he recognised her. This close, it was impossible not to. Her hair may be brown, as it had been in the photographs, but her face remained the same: as familiar as ever. Pale eyes widened in surprise, and one eyebrow curved upwards as she surveyed them. She was dressed in almost identical clothes to the ones she had worn the night she shot him. Her expression, Sherlock realised, was similar as well: professional and remorseless.
His thoughts stopped, the scene frozen in the panorama of his mind's eye. The eerie blue of the aquarium rippled around him; northern lights made terrestrial by the undulating waves. Fish hung suspended. Bubbles pocking the vista like perfect, improbable spheres. The humid, heavy scent of water filled his nose, treated for just the right salinity and pH. It was an arena of control with chaos at its heart: Sherlock and Mary, Norbury and the pistol.
'But what's that got to do with me?' John sagged in his seat, cuffing a hand through his hair and leaving it tousled. With a sigh, he answered his own question. 'It's not about me though, is it? You're right; it's about Mary. This Dio person vanished at the same time it all went south with AGRA. Maybe Mary knew who they were and they think she told me?'
Anger flared again, but he stamped it down. He'd already spent so much of yesterday rattling around this house like a pinball in a machine, constantly pulled back to Sherlock's side only for his resentment to propel him away again. It had got him nowhere, leaving him to spin in the same stupid circles. This was about moving forward, getting through it, not being trapped in a rut of his own making.
'Here.' Sherlock held out the tympanic thermometer. 'If we do this now, we can get an idea how high it is without the influence of paracetamol.'
‘And you didn’t?’ Sherlock challenged. ‘You take almost as much pleasure in upsetting Mycroft as I do.’
'Mister Holmes should be arriving in an hour or two,' the driver added, offering a quick smile before stepping back. 'Should you require any assistance, there are helpful numbers to dial by the phone. Good day, Sir.'
Sherlock closed his eyes, too tired to manage more than a fraction of a smile. ‘What’s the prognosis?’
God, he hated himself.
If Sherlock was right, and he always was, this destruction was both precise and personal. ‘My money’s on family. A brother or sister. Maybe a kid. This is…’ John wrinkled his nose, wishing he could put a finger on what his gut was telling him. ‘Petty?’
'Could anyone else get in to this area of the college?'
The first time she climbed on John’s lap, he almost jumped out of his skin. He winced and hissed in expectation of claws and pain, but she simply gave him a glare and flopped her not-inconsiderable weight down on his lap. A disdainful flick of her ears was the only reward he got for tickling a fingertip over the top of her head, but he kept going until he coaxed a purr from her. It started off quiet, but before he knew it, she sounded like an underground train: deep rumples with occasional wheezy squeaks.
The footsteps went in separate directions, circling around, and Sherlock's heart picked up its pace. He could sense both the commander and John bracing themselves, the tension escalating as they bided their time. They would need to act at the last possible moment so that their enemies had no chance to leap for cover.
Sherlock sauntered over, apparently unconcerned by the eyeball-eating parrot. ‘Think. Both of you.’
John’s lips pinched, like he was biting back a smile, and Sherlock belatedly realised he may have said that last bit out loud.
Mycroft's men had managed to get control of the CCTV network, or at least some parts of it. Now, he could approach unseen, and if he wasn't mistaken, they were pointing the way, giving him clues to where the operatives thought Mary was hiding. Had they seen something to give away her location? Were they sure, or was it just their best guess? He'd take that over his own uncertainty any day of the week, and his boots scraped on the chipped concrete as he ghosted through the shadows, moving ever-closer to the heart of the airfield.
Sherlock turned the page, picking up his coffee to take a sip as he examined the question in his mind. His first, horrified concern had been that this was some vestige of Moriarty's network: some sleeper-cell that had awoken to some unspecified signal, but no. It couldn’t be.
‘You’re high.’ John eased him back onto the uncomfortable hospital bed, little more than a bench with notions of grandeur. ‘Get your head down. It’ll be a while before they can wrangle someone to decide what to do with you.’
'Hold.' The commander raised her closed fist to shoulder level, a clear visual to back up her verbal order. She and John hunkered on either side of one of the broad pathways, pressed against opposite walls as they observed the hulking silhouette of the Hind.
John frowned at the kettle, which bubbled its confusion at him. A moment later he turned, popping his head around the door. ‘What do you mean the first one?’
'Hi,' Molly murmured, closing the door at her back as if trying to stop their voices from carrying.
He had spent the night digging back through his clients, looking at each of them in a new light, cracking open the shells of their lives and prodding for any secret that may have escaped his attention. There were plenty who might hold a grudge: spouses caught cheating, committing fraud or otherwise being underhanded, but their retribution was more linear. They threw punches and were swiftly put in their place. None of them had the connections or resources for any kind of surveillance scheme. Besides, if the aim was to punish Sherlock, then they would do more than watch John. They would take him, hurt him or otherwise make their intentions known.
'I am merely saying what I see, Sherlock. My only advice to you would be to not rush things.' Mycroft raised an eyebrow. 'You've waited this long, after all.'
‘Second case in a row.’
He couldn't give up. That much was certain. Whether John wanted to see him or not, he had to make the effort. Not by text, nor by the dubious intervention of his brother's CCTV surveillance. Being there for a friend, that's what mattered to people, wasn't it? He could wait for John to seek him out, or he could bite the bullet and lay himself open to John's wrath. Like purging a wound, it had to hurt more before it could start to heal.
'What went wrong?' Sherlock tucked his hands into the pockets of the Belstaff. 'What made the splinter group escalate from clumsy surveillance to house invasion and arson? What did you fail to provide?'
John wrinkled his nose, sighing in irritation before turning back the way he had come, counting hallways until he returned to more familiar territory. The double doors to the practice room stood shut, though light still glowed through the panes in the wood. A gentle push showed they had been locked. No doubt the main training had ended for the evening. The swipe card in his pocket let him in with an obliging beep, and he slipped through, easing it closed behind him as he took in the scene.
Rosie squealed as John smiled, his fears melting away like mist before the dawn. There were a lot of things he regretted about the past couple of years, but Rosie was not one of them. She had become his anchor, since Mary died: a focal point for his scattered existence, and every day he loved her all the more.
There was no telling how long he'd be in there, gone but not, a silent presence in the house they shared. Still, John was used to it. It was nice, actually, to get a little bit of peace and quiet: some false solitude to read a book without Sherlock scoffing at his choice of novel, or peruse the paper without his flatmate belittling the journalists.
‘I’ll take them to my office.’ The Dean held out her arms before Sally could respond. ‘There’s a lock on the door. They should be safe in there.’
'Thank you.' Sherlock felt a twist of annoyance. Up until this point, it had been the other way around. He'd been making sure that Mrs Hudson wanted for nothing, not just with food but with her herbal soothers. 'John filled the cupboards a few days ago.'
Or maybe it was simply that John cared for Sherlock more than he had ever loved Mary.
Sherlock lounged in one of the many cafes near John's work, pretending to read a copy of
It suited him, though he’d never, ever say it out loud. Sherlock Holmes plus children seemed like a recipe for disaster. At best, Greg had always thought he’d traumatise them with horrible pictures or ill-considered words. Yet there was something steady and honest about Sherlock that Rosie seemed to love.
'Yes, John. It's over.'
'No.' Sherlock lifted one shoulder in a shrug. 'I reached out to her, as well as Mrs Hudson. Cooking is more your forte than mine, but I thought some recipes might help.'
He did not reply straight away, turning the query over in his mind. He and John had already discussed the idea of surrendering the information when they were at the safe-house. Back then, John's answer had been resolute, but it was one thing to make a decision in the abstract, and quite another when faced with the reality.
He blinked awake as Sherlock set the steaming plate down in front of him, focusing on the meal with a weary gaze. 'Thanks.'
When had it been taken? Before her death, obviously, but not long before it. A week, perhaps? He scanned the pavement that formed her path, looking at the hazy strangers around her, but none of them played a role in the portrait. They were scenery, nothing more. She was the only one that mattered: the star of this particular show, and she knew it.
‘Your phone, though, is new. Top-of-the-line and the latest model. You thought I didn’t see it when you came in. You tucked it away, but not quickly enough, I’m afraid. Your perfume, too, tells a different story than your appearance. It’s the same one as when we first met. A deliberate choice. All of it. An effort to appeal to my sentiment.’
'No. Any wrongs Mary may have committed against me are inconsequential when compared to what this has done to you and Rosie.'
John sighed, reaching into his pocket for his keys and trotting towards the familiar door, gleaming black in the streetlights. It was good talking to Greg, because while the DI may be as normal as they came, he knew what it was to spend time with Sherlock. He understood the insanity John's life could sometimes become, and sympathised without hesitation.
'It does.' He reached up, resting his palm over the back of Sherlock's hand. Those strong arms still banded his chest, supporting his body and offering their comfort. Now he tried to press his reassurances into Sherlock's skin. Wrecked he may be in the ebbing tide of this wretched illness, but he had strength enough for this.
He felt John’s hesitance, the bare moment of sullen, grudging respect before his flatmate finally engaged, asking all the right questions to tease out more symptoms. Within a matter of minutes, he had settled on a diagnosis, and Sherlock knew it would have been quicker still if he’d actually been ill.
‘All right, point taken.’ John got to his feet. ‘I’ll make us some tea. Do another one!’
'But you're not John,' Mary pointed out. 'What do you care?'
‘I thought a ship had to have three masts and square rigging.’
A misjudgement. He saw that now. Time had led to familiarity and offered deeper insight into Molly’s fierce compassion and Mike’s unwavering loyalty. Both, over the months and years, had forced Sherlock to alter his initial assessment into something far more favourable.
And now this. A baby. A blessing to most, but all Sherlock could see was the ultimate, inglorious end of his time with John. Their friendship would fade and falter. John's family would come first, and Sherlock would once again be alone.
What would he have done if he were alone? Would he have kept it together for Rosie's sake, or would he have succumbed despite his daughter's presence? As it was, he looked like an automaton, a man distancing himself from a painful world and going through the motions, rather than actually living.
Sherlock sighed, but it was not his normal huff of irritation. More, it was the sound of someone who had tried explaining to others a dozen times before, and had only managed to confuse them further. ‘In any given case put before me, outlining the chain of deductions that brings me to my conclusions only clouds the issue. The manicure was part of a bigger whole. If Lestrade were asking, I would give him as much information as possible to encourage his belief. Mycroft, on the other hand, deserves no such thoughtfulness.’
'There is some evidence that suggests Mary may have manipulated events in a similar manner to the way I did when I jumped from the rooftop of Bart's.'
'I can – um – I can move upstairs if you want.' The crow's feet at the corner of his eyes deepened as a quick smile flickered across his lips. 'To sleep, I mean. Let you have your bed to yourself again?'
Downstairs, Sherlock shuffled around, making himself another cup of tea, perhaps, or merely pacing the kitchen as he organised his thoughts. The sight of him that morning, lost within the vaults of his Mind Palace when John came down for breakfast, was so familiar that John ached with it. He had not realised how much he missed Sherlock's presence; how much he relied on him, even now.
He'd felt all right yesterday. He'd come home from work, braving the blustery late-March weather, and hopped straight in the shower, the better to disinfect himself as best he could. A decent home-cooked curry and a pint of beer while watching good telly had helped him unwind. He'd gone to bed, and then woken up feeling like shit.
'Long enough. I was coming downstairs to ask you something, but I didn't want to interrupt.'
Morbid he may be, but he would not deny his fascination. Not for anyone.
'But –'
'Oh no you don't.' He flipped her over, ignoring her protests as he got her redressed, manhandling her into her clothes as she struggled to be free of them. By the time they were done, they were both flustered, and John gave a weary groan as he picked her up and carried her downstairs, intent on feeding her.
'That's,' John frowned to himself, 'nice? I can't quite imagine her with Mycroft, but if you say so.'
. If Sherlock could help him, then John would be a fool not to reach out.
Now he stood, bathed in the morning's insipid light with shadows pressed under his eyes and his hair in disarray. Stubble shadowed his jaw, and he tilted his head from side to side, as if attempting to relieve the tension in his neck as he spoke to his brother.
John resisted the temptation to snap at Sherlock. It wouldn't do either of them any good. He was grumpy because he was ill, not because of his flatmate, and losing his temper would only make everything worse.
The days bled together, passing in a kaleidoscope of daylight and darkness. Once, back in his youth, Sherlock would have resented another relying on him so thoroughly. He would have loathed being needed, but when it came to John, everything changed.
Mary was pregnant. Obvious. The truth wrote itself within the outlines of her body and the quirks of her behaviour. Easy to write off as wedding jitters to most, but there was more to it if you cared to observe.
With any luck, it would also bring John some peace of mind: a way to be sure that his life in London had not vanished in a surge of flames. Rosie remained safe and happy in her father's arms. Sherlock allowed himself a moment to breathe a sigh of relief, forcing aside the harsh "could have been's" that circled in his thoughts: ones that ended up with more gravestones and grief, and him on his own to bear its brunt.
‘You haven’t figured it out? And you call yourself a police officer.’ He giggled as Greg threw a packet of crisps at him. Thankfully, they’d not been opened yet, so they didn’t make a mess. John hummed appreciatively. Steak and ale. His favourite. ‘Good beer, nice crisps… are you trying to bribe me for information?’
The hook of her smile quirked up, just a fraction, her eyes carefully warm. A moment later, her expression became a mask as Sherlock continued.
Assuming John had not already succumbed.
‘What? Why?’ Sherlock propped himself up on his elbow and squinted at John in confusion.
The temptation to ask questions burned across Sherlock's tongue, sharp and biting, but he urged it back. That was what Mary wanted. She was watching them even as they observed her, trying to assess how much they suspected and what they knew for certain. To fill in the silence would offer her the foundations on which to twist this scenario to her advantage, and Sherlock was weary of giving her that opportunity. John deserved better. He deserved the truth, and it was about time Mary gave it to them.
'No, it's not.' John spoke with such certainty, as if he were writing the law in stone. 'I know you. You won't stop until you've got the answers, Sherlock, you never do.'
Then there were days like today, when the wind blew just so, and Sherlock lifted his face to the horizon with a peaceful sort of longing. The Belstaff billowed behind him, all swagger and style. The cry of seagulls as they cruised up the Thames only added to the image, and John could almost hear the creak of rigging above his head.
'What would happen if the group became aware of your identity and your current situation? So far, an intermediary has protected you from their knowledge, and they've been distracted by their search. What would they do if they realised that you – the purveyor of the information they had purchased in the past – was being held in custody? Units such as theirs do, after all, rely on secrecy. What would they do to avoid becoming the target of scrutiny, I wonder?’ Sherlock paused. ‘You may think yourself safe in a maximum-security facility, Ms Norbury, but you would be surprised.'
Alas, a furious roar met his generous offer: the noise that had earned his opponent the nickname he wore so proudly. It hummed in Sherlock’s ears and rattled his ribcage: the perfect intimidation tactic.
'An educated guess,' Sherlock admitted, 'extrapolated from your previous nights out with Lestrade.' He reached a hand across the expanse of their bed, his fingers catching in the denim of John's jeans and giving a demanding tug.
With a curt nod, she sat back in her chair, uncrossing her legs and rubbing her palms over the hub of her knees as if to wipe away nervous sweat. Her tongue skated over her lip and she closed her eyes, seeming to martial her strength. Sherlock braced himself, more than ready for further fabrications to pour forth, but this time, it seemed, Mary had run out of stories to tell.
As if in the end, despite everything, the answer would be anything but “yes.”
The closest thing he could conjure was the notion of soul-mates: a ridiculous, romanticised idea that he had always believed to be ludicrously saccharine. Yet taken at its face-value, stripped of its romantic trappings, it made the most sense.
Glancing up at one of the cameras, John smiled as it deliberately turned away from him, fixing its cyclopic gaze on a point further in to the compound. The one over on the next building did the same, and John's pulse skittered in giddy relief.
Sherlock nodded and padded through to the kitchen, wiping down surfaces and washing his hands before he started putting together the simple fare. At least he didn't have to remind Sherlock about that, John thought as he swallowed back the tablets and sipped his water. Sherlock may have a bit of a blind spot when it came to human remains in the fridge, but he had a strong understanding of good hygiene and the spread of disease.
'Mary Morstan has returned.'
'John, what is it? Is something wrong?'
'No.' Sherlock slumped in one of the armchairs by the fire, dumping his bag on the floor and kicking his feet out in front of him. The silent restraint of Diogenes always rasped at his nerves, inciting him to childish rebellion. The whole place was built on a firm foundation of etiquette and tradition: stifled, old thinking that set his teeth on edge. 'And you can stop pretending to be civil for my benefit. What have you found out?'
'You were right; they've been at it a while.' John shrugged, his mouth wrenching to the side. 'Longer than Mary's been gone. Maybe it's nothing to do with her after all?'
Now Mary was gone, and John would never forgive him.
John trembled, victim to an uncontrollable shudder that worked its way down from the top of his head to the tip of his toes. 'Just say it, Sherlock.'
'I could have just... wounded her.' John swallowed, prodding at his uncertainty like a sore tooth. 'Distracted her with a flesh wound, bought us some time...'
Sherlock raised an eyebrow at John's question, turning his mobile over in his hand. 'Not long. Mycroft was right. Now that Mary knows her list of secrets has been compromised, she will be eager to salvage what she can. However, I doubt she'll ask her friends in the Harmattan splinter group for help. To do so would admit weakness, something she would not wish to put on display. Mary will probably attempt to solve this problem herself.'
'And if it comes back?'
A tight noise caught in his throat: a stifled explosion of anger. Sentiment. Mycroft would be appalled. Still, Sherlock himself could not see it as a weakness. Unpleasant as his fears may be, they were a symptom of the care he had come to feel for John. The soft regard that he could not bring himself to wish undone, no matter how much it may, at times, pain him.
‘Someone called Tomas Cubric. I’ve got Dimmock questioning the fencing team. Kids seem pretty shocked, though. You think it’s one of them?’
'That's not the point.' John sighed, knowing it was no use pushing the issue. Sherlock wouldn't change, not for someone as peripheral as Sally. Besides, it wasn't as if she endeared herself. The "freak" comments may have come to a halt, but her dislike of Sherlock was poorly concealed at the best of times. If it weren't for the fact he improved Greg's solve-rate so much, he suspected the sergeant would put her foot down. They'd lose access to anything the Yard had to offer, from decent cases to dubious coffee. 'Where to now, then?'
Yet John seemed louder, this time. Anger, not sadness, appeared to be his primary emotion, and one that Sherlock had learned to respect. John Watson's rage was not something to be taken lightly. It made him unpredictable, even to someone as observant as Sherlock.
They had one another to rely on for strength, and while he could be sure of John's gun at his back and presence by his side, he had to repay the favour. He had to sort out the mess they had found themselves in, no matter the consequences to John and Mary's marriage: or whatever was left of it.
'There are few who would blame you for that, considering her actions. Besides, giving Mary the file would not only secure her survival but, in theory, remove the threat that hovers over you and Rosie.'
John agreed with Norbury on that score. Looking back, he could see that Mary wore emotion like a convenient mask. Even now, he could not be sure how much of what he had ever seen from her was genuine.
‘Bloody hell, no.’ John grinned. ‘Mycroft got him in with some Harley Street cosmetic surgeon at almost midnight. I dread to think what it cost, but with work like that, it probably won’t leave a mark. At least, it won’t as long as you leave it alone.’
'She knew they were there.' John jabbed his finger into the top photograph: one of Mary as they had both known her. 'She saw them take this.'
He needed to see Sherlock, to meet him face-to-face. He needed to see the truth of his words with his own eyes. Anger simmered in his veins, aimless, and John clenched his teeth in an effort to calm the roil of his emotions. Control. That was what he needed; some element of fucking control, and if that meant he had to confront the man, then so be it.
Sherlock stirred milk into John's tea. 'That is what's causing me some confusion. If they were looking for something physical, then I would expect to see more efforts to recover it. They would not burn your house to cinders, and they would be far more likely to make incursions into your digital life: hacking and so forth. They have not done so; I already checked.'
Mrs Hudson hid a smile behind her cup, watching John and Sherlock over the rim. They probably did not realise they were doing it: little touches, fixing each other’s clothes or patting down a stray curl without a second thought.
With a sigh, Sherlock shook off his melancholy, settling in front of the laptop and checking his emails. Lestrade had beaten Molly to the punch, and Sherlock opened the attachments, narrowing his eyes at the crime-scene photographs.
This time, it seemed the balance tipped in her favour. 'From a Greek unit who has been conducting a surveillance operation in London. They appear to be looking for someone or something connected to Mary Watson. The obvious conclusion is that you might know something about these... individuals.'
Her hand was shaking against his head. He could feel it: a gentle stutter. He wasn’t sure if Donovan’s concern was for his well-being – it seemed unlikely, considering their past animosity – or if she was worried how Lestrade and John would react when they found out he was hurt on her watch.
Lestrade groaned, scrubbing a hand over his face. ‘Sherlock, any ideas? Anything at all?’
The tip of Sherlock's tongue darted out to wet his bottom lip, his gaze shifting to the side as if he were considering the option of a kind lie, only to dismiss it a moment later. Instead, he faced John fully, tipping his head to one side. 'May I come in?'
The stairs creaked as John rose to his feet, his hands clenching into quick, nervous fists at his side. Those blue eyes remained downcast, reading God knew what secrets in the grain of the floorboards. The light caught on the hints of silver in his hair, playing among the strands as he closed the distance between them.
The idea of her stepping into the path of a bullet to save Sherlock? In hindsight, it was ridiculous. The woman had shot him herself, not so long ago. Oh, maybe John could make up some rubbish about her changing her tune once she realised what Sherlock meant to him, but there wouldn't be a grain of truth to it. That would require a level of empathy he doubted Mary could manage.
'Back to Baker Street. I need to think.'
John clenched his hand into a tight fist before letting it go again, trying to shake off the phantom tremor that still haunted him. For a long time, it had been Mary: he told himself she was his reason for staying away, but really, she was just his excuse. It sounded awful to say she had been a consolation prize. Not the one he wanted but the next best thing, and yet…
Sherlock hummed in agreement, clasping a hand over John's shoulder before striding over to the rickety old thermostat and coaxing the heating into life. He marched down the stairs, retrieving the groceries, luggage and the takeaway before depositing them on the table. 'Will you be all right seeing to that?' he asked. 'I want to make sure the building is secure.'
'The USB stick, the one you threw in the fire when you made your choice about Mary... I took a copy.'
Though even he had to admit, this was edging into a whole new territory of creepy.
Had he overheard? Was he now reconsidering his request to stay here at Baker Street? Sherlock had not planned to speak of his turbulent, desperate heart. He had hoped to give John time and space to find his balance once more before mustering the courage to speak up – assuming he ever said anything at all.
One day, that changed.
Depression was a strange beast. It affected people in so many ways. Most people thought of those who suffered as unable to get out of bed or perform basic tasks: so lost in their apathy that they couldn’t function. Except it wasn’t always like that. Sometimes it came out as aggression or frustration so sharp it cut like a knife. Often, it could bleed out in acts of violence or self-harming behaviours.
John nodded, putting his book aside and sitting forward on the edge of his armchair. No smile graced his lips, but at least he was taking part in the world once more. Sherlock had given him a problem to solve: one focussed not around a mystery, but around the care of Rosie, and John's nature would not allow him to ignore his daughter's needs. 'I haven't even considered the insurance claim, yet. God.'
Dragging it free, he cursed as it slid in his sweaty palm, the glossy plastic slick against his skin. The screen bathed the small space of the wardrobe in an acid blue light, and John quickly darkened it, plunging them back into shadow as he dialled the only number that mattered.
After what felt like an age, John’s tension ebbed, replaced by the drag of exhaustion. The wracking sobs subsided to hitched, pained breaths, and Sherlock closed his eyes, blinking away the sharp scratch of emotion that stung at the seam of his lashes.
‘There’s something in the syrup?’ Donovan asked, her face pinched.
Sherlock bowed his head. 'No. From what I can tell, there is a steady decline in her gathering and trading these secrets, but she never ceased. Not entirely.'
The buzz of the dial-tone echoed in John's ear before he could question Sherlock's orders. He whimpered a curse as he slid the phone back in his pocket, wrapping his arm around Rosie and listening for movement beyond the wardrobe.
Only then, once there was no uncertainty left in his mind, would he acknowledge the likely truth.
'My strategy didn't work out the way I'd hoped.' She turned away, reaching out for one of the chairs tucked under the dining table and pulling it out, perching elegantly on its edge. She crossed her leg over her knee and folded her hands in her lap. 'Harmattan were supposed to give up – to realise that there was nothing left for them here and move on.'
No. Just no. He had been a coward long enough, hiding away from the roil of his emotions rather than facing them. He wouldn’t do it again. He wouldn’t skulk in the corridor, waiting for someone else to bring him news. Sherlock deserved better than that.
He owed it to Rosie to be a better father than that.
'What can we do?'
‘But it’s not one of those?’ Greg gestured to the weapons in the racks around them.
Now, he ambled along a cold street, eating fish and chips that tasted like ash in his mouth. No companionable laughter reached his ears and no friendly weight nudged his shoulder. Initially, he had thought John’s distance a puerile punishment: a way to make him feel guilty for his long absence.
Tears had been shed: the red rims of John's eyes made their accusations, and his skin seemed to sag from the bones of his face, slack with misery. It had been a long time since Sherlock had seen John look so defeated. The last had been at Sherlock’s own graveside, the cane clenched tight in his hand and his body tense with rejection of his new reality.
'It was always you, you know,' she murmured, the wind snatching her words away almost before they reached his ears. 'Even after you were dead, it was still about you. He grieved, though he felt he had no right to do so. You are both the best and worst thing that could ever have happened to him.'
'Sherlock...'
'Enough.' Sherlock got to his feet, gratified to see a very real flinch twitch over Mary's features: perhaps the first genuine emotion she had shown. 'You've proven yourself skilled in the art of manipulation, but that was a clumsy attempt at best. At every step of the way, you have been managing my reactions and John's anger. Now, seeing that we are a united front, you seek to divide us.' He stepped towards the table, forcing Mary to look up at him. The glisten of her tears vanished from her eyes: shamming. He was not surprised. It's what he would have done.
A sob pulsed in John’s throat, and he put his hand over his mouth, stifling it behind his knuckles as a tear tumbled over his lashes. It was another breach in the dam, even Sherlock could see that much, and he gently set Rosie aside, making sure she was safe before climbing to his feet and pulling John from the chair and into his embrace.
This was home.
‘I’d better be off!’ he sang, throwing a grin over his shoulder. A rictus: strained and gruesome. No real mirth in it at all. There was hatred in his gaze now, furious and fiery. ‘Have fun with your little… pet.’
Sherlock shifted, moving around the motionless tableau and taking in the angles of Mary's body. He had not seen her face. There would be nothing of fact written in her expression. Her truths lay in the poise of her muscles and the stretch of her joints. He saw it now: not the panicked sprawl of a split-second decision, but something graceful. Mary had not leapt in front of the gun, she'd stepped before it, putting herself directly in the bullet's path.
Greg grinned, the sparkle in his eyes only dimming when he noticed John’s injury. ‘Need a paramedic?’
'Not long,' he rasped, wincing as he did so. God, he felt worse. Cold and hot and aching something fierce.
'Come here, love,' he murmured, surprised by the sudden rush of genuine affection that bubbled in his chest. 'Let's get you sorted.'
Sherlock wrinkled his nose. Sadly, John was right. He sounded like someone imitating a cough, rather than anything more serious. Still, it was yet another expected symptom, and one that had turned up on schedule. 'How about your breathing?'
'No, Sherlock. Ten minutes, that's all. Rosie needs to see some sunshine, and there's a walled garden through those doors.' John jerked his thumb towards the nearby French windows. He was right, there was a neatly manicured stretch of velvety grass and flowerbeds in bloom. Old grey stone blocked out the potential for prying eyes, and at this time of day the space was bathed in sunbeams.
Mary straightened her spine, her gaze flickering, once, to John, before returning to Sherlock as if magnetised. When they first met, she had looked at him with indifference, as if he were merely a factor in her calculations she had to consider. Later, he had thought there was the warmth of friendship in her expression. Now, however, what took its place was cold and unyielding. If she still had her gun, she would pull the trigger and finish what she had started in Magnusson's office. Of that he was certain.
John would not understand. He would see the romantic – the sexual and nothing more. He would assume infatuation and fall into a funk of jealousy, as if he had some prior, unspoken claim to Sherlock’s affections that neither of them acknowledged.
'They're not as clear,' John warned him, plucking free the pages and handing them over like a man handling a live serpent. 'I keep thinking maybe I'm wrong, but...'
‘Irish, actually.’ Sherlock sipped his coffee, trying not to shudder in the chill. The wind howled, fierce and furious. Even his Belstaff struggled against it. No wonder John and Lestrade looked so miserable. Their cheap clothes must be next to useless. They were ambling back from the pub after a beer. Sherlock had accompanied them since he had nothing better to do. Besides, both of them had seemed in a foul mood at the crime scene earlier. He felt it best to keep an eye on them just in case. ‘Though they carved turnips. They took the tradition to America.’
Sherlock blinked, a faint frown marring his brow as he dragged himself back to reality. ‘The switch Banksy made to stencilling around the turn of the millennium allowed for wider dissemination of the Banksy movement, and made it possible for others to emulate the style freely. Most of them are the work of copy-cats.’ He gestured to the tv screen. ‘Like that one.’
'O Dio? I don't –' John shook his head. 'What does that mean?'
Autumn went two ways in London. Either it howled a gale and threw down with rain, ushering in winter in one crap day, or it did this. Clear skies, cool and crisp, with leaves crunching underfoot and festooning the trees in colour.
'Get out!'
Mary had indicated the biggest of the huts, and he allowed his gaze to wander, noting the exits and escape routes. There was nothing in terms of a perimeter fence, no barrier to hold him in, and yet the open landscape was its own deterrent. Running in any direction would leave him exposed, and Mary would have a bullet in his head before he got more than a few paces.
'Smart man,' she praised. 'Do you have an oximeter, just in case?'
'Closing the door after the horse has bolted?'
Well, that was about to change. Solving the situation with Mary's past and the ominous watchers of John's day-to-day life would help John's peace of mind, but there was more to it than that. John could not take care of himself in his current emotional state, and so Sherlock was determined to do it for him. How many times had John stood there, urging him to take care of the needs of his transport when his mind tried to prioritise more cerebral pursuits? Now, when John's aching heart claimed all of his attention, Sherlock knew he had to return the favour.
