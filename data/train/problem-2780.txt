“Vera?” He called out nervously. “Shit.” He muttered when she didn’t resurface, stripping himself of his flannel. He ripped his shirt off over his head, only the see her head break the surface as his shirt dropped to the ground. He dropped to his knees and leaned over the edge of the boat, peering down at her, his unamused frown not matching her mischievous grin at all. “You scared the hell out of me.” He said, offering his arm to help her out of the water.
And that was the moment that triggered the meltdown that had been boiling in Dean’s blood since he woke up handcuffed in the dungeon. He forcefully knocked the book off of the table in front of him, sending it flying across the library. He stood up so fast that his heavy chair fell to the ground with a crack, and he brought his boot down on it making the wood splinter. He picked up the nearest lamp and threw it as hard as he could, the glass exploding when it came in contact with one of the bookshelves. Dean stopped himself, his chest heaving in anger. The Mark was quietly mumbling but had little interest in Dean’s anger when there wasn’t another living being involved. Charlie was dead. He had almost killed Cas. He had almost killed Sam. Sam was probably one incident away from a stupid self-sacrificing decision pertaining to the Mark, and Cas was beginning to spend more time with angels that would probably convince him to return to Heaven. And it was all Dean’s fault.
“I’m Dean.” Dean offered his hand for a firm handshake before gesturing to Cas on the other side of the table. “That’s Cas.”
Sam smirked at Dean’s bored expression and continued to console a very shaken Mia. She wasn’t of much help and just kept repeating that she had told Oliva and Bethany that trying to talk to a spirit was a bad idea. Sam was only half listening to her while she ranted about her superstitious family and how they would kill her if they knew she was messing around with the paranormal. She mentioned voodoo at one point, which piqued Sam’s interest, but he quickly found out that Mia only brought it up because he family was so against anything that involved communicating with the dead.
“I’m sorry, Molly. Listen, this must be hard. We don’t have to talk about it anymore. I was just on my way to the lobby to grab some coffee. Would you like some?”
Dean looked like he was on the verge of strangling Sam in the middle of the street. “Shut it, Sam. I’m going to kick Cas’ feathery ass the next time I see him.” He shoved Sam out of his way, relieved that they were almost at the diner.
the men that have been staying there. This entire time I’ve been trying to figure out a motive, or at least a connection between the victims. I can’t think of anything, at least not without questioning the families.”
fluffy.” Cas’ voice was absolutely fascinated, turning his head to continue looking at the cow as they drove past it.
Cas was outside, not bothered by the cold or fading daylight, scoping out the best place for him to plant his flowers once it was spring. He had tried to coax Dean to join him, but Dean felt like Cas’ absence was the perfect time to approach Sam about the subject of how they planned on celebrating the holiday. Dean shifted his weight from foot to foot in embarrassment before sighing. “Listen, when he was a human, he didn’t get to experience all this sappy holiday shit. I had to kick him out of the bunker to protect you. I know he’s not a human anymore, and I know that holidays may be dumb and overrated to us, but-“
“Son of a bitch!” Dean yelled as a now dead honeybee fell from his hand. Dean ripped the stinger out of his palm unceremoniously and didn’t want to think about how he was used to it by now.
not sexy, smoldering quips. But Castiel had the patience of a nun, and somehow found Dean’s effort endearing and loved him even more for it.
Dean smiled. “Awesome. Well, uh, I think this is the right house.” He changed the subject as they pulled into the driveway, grasping at the opportunity to change the subject that he had brought up. Cas leaned forward, looking through the windshield. “You should wear your seatbelt.” Dean growled.
“I favor the eternal Tuesday afternoon of an autistic man who drowned in a bathtub in 1953.” Caught off guard, Sam raised his eyebrows.
Dean snorted. “No, thank god. I don’t want to move anyone else in this house with all the issues it’s having. It’s a safety hazard at this point.” Cas tilted his head slightly, and Dean’s eyes grew wide. He realized Cas was trying to find out if he was dating someone. “I’m uh, actually not dating anyone.” Cas was now looking at him thoughtfully, and Dean decided to sprinkle a little extra information on top. “No women have really caught my interest lately. Or men.” Cas smiled, and that’s when Dean realized he was fucked. It wasn’t just a smile that made his eyes sparkle, it was a smile that lit up his whole face. Castiel was smart and kind and thoughtful. He was funny despite being awkward and had listened to Dean rant about the Impala for almost fifteen minutes even though he clearly didn’t care about cars. He was passionate and open minded and liked Dean’s cooking. He was somehow both handsome
Hating this question the most, Cas dismissively replied “It changed a lot.” Before hiding behind a sip of his cola.
Castiel watched his back, feeling a smile form on his lips. Dean was such a selfless, thoughtful person, but never wanted credit for it. He was always modest. Regardless of wanting to deny his worth, he truly was the righteous man, and it was small moments like these that reminded Cas of why he chose Dean over Heaven.
Their lunch was awkward at best. Sam tried to force conversation and assure Dean that there would be a real lead soon, that Crowley or Rowena, or someone working with them would slip up and leave a trail. Dean didn’t want to hear it. It was his birthday and he would be petty if he wanted to.
Cas looked at him like he was speaking a foreign language. Well, maybe not that because he spoke all languages. But he was definitely looking at Dean like he had said something crazy. “I’ll always come back to you.” The sincerity in his voice floored Dean.
With Lisa, it was different. He had tried to create a future with her. He knew he was just “playing dad and husband”. He knew it was absurd to think that he could just impose himself in this normal life and hoped it worked. Sam was gone, and Cas was gone, but Lisa and Ben were there. He knew now that they were just poor replacements for what he was missing. Lisa was just someone that was replacing Cas in the sense that she was someone that he loved that he could actually
I also really miss how absolutely bratty Cas can be at times, so I'm gonna make sure to add that in as much as possible while still remaining in character.
Sam shot him another disgruntled look, but Dean smiled noticing that his expression immediately softened when he looked back at Eileen. “I’m in South Carolina right now. I could swing by on the way back to the bunker. It would be a few hours though. ‘A few’ being generous.”
Cas swallowed his last bite slowly. He wasn’t sure what he was expecting. Normally when people offered so much personal information about themselves, they usually expected the same in return. “I finally moved away from my mother. She was… very overprotective and over bearing. I was a… sick child. She always worried that I would get sick again, or that people would treat me differently if they knew about it.”
shower, Sam had returned with deliciously greasy McDonald’s breakfast and coffee. Cas was nowhere to be seen. “Cas isn’t here.” Sam said, replying to Dean’s eyes scanning the room for the angel. Sam narrowed his eyes at him. “What did you say to him?” He asked, not bothering to hide his suspicion and not even giving Dean enough time to cross the room to his duffle bag.
“The ones that want me to lead feel like they owe me.” Cas replied simply. “They’re…willing to do things for me that the others aren’t, regardless of the situation being taboo. Many of them will not talk, but there’s one angel who may know more about the mark and may be willing to talk. Finding her is proving difficult. She had no interest in returning to Heaven.”
The den looked cute (though Dean would never speak those words out loud) with all the Christmas lights, their little tiny tree, and even three stockings hung by the fireplace like some kind of damn nursery rhyme. He wasn’t sure if it was just the alcohol talking, but it made Dean want to plan ahead for holidays, for real this time. He wanted to celebrate holidays with his brother and best friend, and even though he knew their lives would never be normal, that there was no white picket fence in sight, he desperately wanted to cling to this little bit of normalcy.
Dean laughed nervously. Okay then. The guy had a weird sense of humor, and a voice that sounded gravelly and just perfect for fucking. Dean could handle that. He rubbed the back of his anxiously but kept his smile intact. “It, uh, was just a joke. A really bad one, apparently.” He raised his hand holding the pie. “I’m just here for this.” He added before placing it on the counter.
Dean immediately tensed and turned over in the bed so that he was facing Castiel with wide eyes. “Y-you don’t have to do that. It took forever to get here, and you didn’t sleep at all in the car.” He bit his lip nervously and slid over to the opposite side of the bed, making room so that Castiel wouldn’t have to walk around to the other side. Castiel finished taking off his slacks and removed his socks while Dean looked everywhere in the room except at Castiel.
Vera chewed on her bottom lip and avoided his eyes for a second. She plopped down on the seat behind the helm sighing deeply. “I know you can’t tell me… what’s going on here.” She met his eyes again. “Feds are sworn under oath or whatever, right? I guess I don’t need details. I don’t even know if I
“As you already know, this is my room.” Dean said, waving a hand at his closed bedroom door. “And you can have this one.” He added as he stopped in front of the next room down.
To distract himself, he began to follow Cas’ instructions about preening, first trying to realign the feathers that were sticking out at odd angles. Cas shuddered and let out a content sound and Dean had to get in an internal argument with his dick not to take Cas’ reaction the wrong way.
“A what?” Sam asked in confusion, definitely not expecting Cas to bring up the case, but a little relieved. They weren’t getting anywhere, and Dean certainly wasn’t helping.
“Both.” The word was out of Dean’s mouth before he even realized he said it. He flicked his own cigarette on the ground, crushing it with the two of his boot and avoiding eye contact to hide just how uncomfortable he was.
“Out.” Dean muttered gruffly. Dean stumbled his way towards the Impala. He didn’t even know why he bothered drinking like this anymore. It didn’t help. Nothing helped when Sam was in this kind of trouble. But
Dean woke up, groaning slightly. His head felt foggy, but through the brain fog he realized that he had gotten out of bed at some point in the night and undressed down to his boxers. He rubbed his eyes and went to sit up, but a warm, firm arm snaked around his waist and pulled him in closer to whoever it belonged to. What the fuck? Could Djinn juice make someone sleep walk? Did he pick someone up at a bar and go home with them? He tried to turn to see who the arm belonged to, but before he could, a small, sleepy kiss was planted on the back of his neck and a pleading voice rumbled “Five more minutes, Dean.” Dean froze. That was Cas’ gravel on sandpaper voice. That was Cas’ arm wrapped around him lovingly. That was Cas’ chest up against his back, Cas’ lips against his neck. That was Cas’
“Her father admitted to the affair as her mother was on her deathbed. He felt like he wouldn’t be able to deal with the guilt if she died not knowing. They kept it from Molly.” Cas finished his entire glass with a single smooth swallow, leaning around Dean to abandon his glass next to Dean’s.
“Bye, losers.” She choked out, taking a deep breath. She looked up at the sky, still blinking tears out of her eyes. “Beam me up, Scotty.”
“You know” the lady said. “You three could have easily passed as Sam, Dean, and Castiel!” Her eyes flickered between the three of them before resting on Sam again. “Your hair isn’t quite right, but you’ve got the height. But since you had no idea the books kept going, I guess you’re not that big of a fan.”
Dean swore with every fiber of his being that he would never fall in love. It scared the absolute hell out of him, and he knew he wasn’t as strong as John, Bobby, or Sam. They withstood their hearts being broken, just barely, but Dean barely made it through just
Castiel finally looked back up with him, his whole body aching with want at the thought of Dean touching his wings. “No human has ever seen angel wings, only their shadow… and no human has certainly ever touched angel wings.”
It’s not that he didn’t believe love existed, but he certainly didn’t think it could possibly be “worth” it in the end, not after what the things he had seen.
Castiel nodded, and then vanished, leaving Sam swaying at the sudden absence of his grip. Dean snorted. “You know, I think I liked it better when he couldn’t do that.” He said with an eye roll.
He used so little and there was so much in the vials that he hadn’t even realized how much of it he had burned through since he started injecting. His arms were littered with ugly track marks that made him nauseous to look at. He would spend too long in the shower scrubbing at them as if he could one day wash them away. It was a slippery slope, going from using it when he needed it, to using it because he
. Cas looked up and caught Dean glaring when Dean didn’t school his face quickly enough. He tilted his head in confusion and Dean hated how fucking cute he thought that was.
Dean went missing for a few months after he massacred the Styne family, holing himself up to try to get a grip on the Mark of Cain after what he did to Castiel. Sam never stopped searching for his brother or trying to contact him. He continued to threaten and blackmail Rowena to use
“Uh, no. I’ve been practically raising you since you were in diapers. I would remember if you got stung by a bee, Sam.”
“Oh, no reason.” Sam dismissed, and even over the phone Dean could tell that he was lying. “I just thought it might be something interesting to study.”
Goodbyes were quick, and Dean stumbled out of the bar, immediately looking for the Impala before realizing that Sam and Cas must have taken it. Dean drew his leather jacket around him tightly, the cold bite of the night air sobering. He began making his way towards the motel that he had booked earlier and was a little surprised by how little he was freaking out by his impromptu make out session. He had a sneaking suspicion that he might not be as calm once he completely sobered up. He didn’t think it would take long with the just above freezing temperature and the three blocks to walk.
“I’m the devil. You think an angel blade can kill me, boy?” The beast growled, slamming a hooved foot down onto Dean’s chest. He felt several ribs crack and pain shoot through his body. All the pain rushed to one spot, the mark on his arm. He glanced over at his arm, blinking blood from his eyes. The mark burned bright red against his flesh.
Dean choked on his food. He coughed and chugged half his beer before being able to completely clear his throat. Sam shot him his best bitch face before responding to Cas. “Really? You know you can stay here, right?”
Sam walked over to a section of costumes and flipped through them with disinterest until he came across a clown. He flinched and immediately walked back over to where Dean and Cas were. Fuck that. He was steering clear of the Halloween section.
“Fuck off, Sammy.” Dean growled, internally wincing when he felt the skin over the mark tear and draw blood from his nails still scraping over it.
“I don’t know, Dean. It’s a difficult decision to make. But after rejecting the throne in Heaven, I’m not sure if I would be allowed to split my time between there and here. Very few angels have spoken with me since I turned down the role of God. Only a few angels from my old Garrison and Ariel have been willing to speak with me.” Castiel responded sadly. Sam and Dean had treated him like family far more than the other angels had since his rebellion, but it still saddened him to know that so few of his family members were even willing to speak to him.
Cas smirked. “Who knows? You could be.” He then winked, or at least tried to. It was awkward and unpracticed, but it had Dean grinning like an idiot anyway. Cas picked his mail up off the ground. “I’ll see you around, Dean.”
Dean shoved his fingers through his hair in frustration and sat his mostly empty plate down between them. He’d lost his appetite. “I can’t even
“Of course.” Cas replied, his eyes suddenly growing wide, realizing how close they were. He let go of Dean and stood up very abruptly, seeming flustered, before offering Dean his hand to help him up. Dean took it, and Cas hauled him up like he didn’t weigh anything. “What happened, Dean?”
They both parted for some air, and Dean realized just how badly he was shaking. There was a voice in the back of his head telling him this was a catastrophically bad idea because they had both been drinking, but a louder one was telling it to shut the fuck up for the time being. The string lights hanging from the roof of the tiki hut bar were sparkling in Cas’ infinitely blue eyes, and they were wide with wonder. Dean wanted to know what he was thinking, wanted to know where Cas’ head was at in all of this, but before he could ask, someone to the left cleared their throat.
Ariel scrunched up her nose in disappointment, immediately realizing where Castiel’s thought process went. “Michael and Lucifer are out of the question. Do you think that any of the angels would allow you to risk Lucifer escaping his cage just to save Dean Winchester?”
Dean stood up, and Cas mimicked him. “Thank you for your time, Mrs. Brayden. We’re so sorry to hear about your loss. We’ll be in touch as soon as we know something.” Dean attempted sweetly, reaching his hand out to her. She shook his hand and he flinched and made a face, realizing her hand was wet. He wasn’t sure if it was from tears or snot, and when he looked up, Cas was smirking at him.
his skin was. He didn’t know what it was, but he always assumed with Cas just using a vessel, the skin would be cold. He gently let go of Cas’ arm to repeat the same action on his other arm. He smiled at the angel, ignoring his face growing hot. There was just something so
“Would you stop worrying about the bees?” Eileen said teasingly. “They only take what they need from the flowers. They won’t take enough to harm them. It’s the natural balance of things, they know what they’re doing.” Dean had already lost track of her hands.
pies. And he had to admit, it was kind of cute to see Cas tilt his head and concentrate on the taste after every bite. He eventually admitted to liking the apple pie better, and Dean couldn’t have been prouder. Key Lime wasn't one of his favorites, but it was on sale. Once they finished desert (Cas insisted on cleaning the dishes with his angel mojo), Dean led him down the hallway to one of the spare bedrooms. It only made sense for Cas to have the room closest to Dean.
from where the hunter had fallen asleep next to him after preening his wings. It had been far too many weeks for most living beings to still pick up on the scent, but as an angel, Castiel was still able to pick up on the smell that was so
Castiel lined up on the firing line again, and Dean observed him intently. While Cas’ posture was immaculate, his stance was rigid and stiff, his feet too close together. He raised the gun to eye level, squinting his incredibly blue eyes, and he pulled the trigger, the bullet once again missing his target. Cas let out and furious groan, and Dean felt static in the air like any second from now the angel’s wings were going to flare out behind him angrily. Dean sighed, approaching his friend.
“Scream all you want.” Alastair sneered, sharpening his knife once again. “No one is coming for you. No one can save you here.”
“I’m not done, Dean.” Cas said, narrowing his eyes. Dean immediately shut his trap. “I still didn’t tell him anything. It wasn’t the first time I’ve been tortured. I doubt it will be the last.” Dean tensed up, and when Cas saw his reaction his expression softened. “Even though I was stubborn, he didn’t give up. He eventually noticed how….uncomfortable I got when he would bring you up. He was amazed that after everything, bringing you up was what affected me.” Cas’ eyes searched Dean’s face sadly. It took every ounce of his will not to wrap himself around the angel and comfort him, instead, he just spoke up.
Dean woke up and stretched in bed, a little annoyed that the sunlight peaking through the window woke him up until he rolled over. That same ray of light was falling over Cas, making his dark hair shine and his skin golden. He smiled, unable to resist the urge to lean in and capture his boyfriend’s lips. Cas responded with a grumpy noise of acknowledgement and swatted Dean away in his sleep. Dean pouted and flopped back down on his pillows, closing his eyes again.
Before Castiel could even react, Dean’s lips were on his. Despite Castiel’s shock, a content moan escaped through his lips. Dean’s fingers found their way to Castiel’s hair, knotting in them and pulling him closer with each, desperate, loving kiss. Dean kissed down Castiel’s jawline, to his neck. His lips curled into a smile against Castiel’s neck as he felt the goosebumps from his stubble spread across Castiel’s skin like wildfire. This. This is what Dean had wanted. This is what he had needed for so long. Castiel’s hands found their way to Dean’s hips, pulling him all the more closer. Dean sighed hungrily, working his way back to Castiel’s mouth. His fingers released Castiel’s hair, only to work their way under his trenchcoat, shoving it off of him and to the ground. He could tell Cas was nervous. But just as Castiel had promised to prove to Dean that he was worth loving, Dean’s lips were tracing a silent promise to him that there was nothing to be afraid of. As long as Dean was there, Castiel didn’t have to fear a thing.
Ariel rolled her eyes again. “Lots of dumb, unfunny pranks with the intention of teaching a lesson and an increase in the number of pornstars on vacation on the coast.”
Dean frowned and draped his arm over Cas’ stomach. It wasn’t like they were cuddling, he was just… getting more comfortable. That was all. “Did it use your grace to have to do that? Your eyes glowed too.”
“Cas… if you hear this… I need you. Real bad, man. Sammy’s not doing too good. Me and Bobby have done all we can do, but I don’t think it’s working. I think maybe-“ Dean stopped, hearing the familiar, faint rustle of wings that always gave away Castiel’s presence.
Sam took his seat across from them and stared at his food for a moment. “When I was in the shower, I almost slipped on something. When I looked down, I saw this.” He reached in the chest pocket of his plaid shirt and pulled out a single black feather, smaller than the one Dean had found awhile back. Dean looked over at Cas and the angel’s eyes were huge. Just like before, Cas immediately reached over and snatched the feather out of Sam’s hand, glaring at it before shoving it in his trench coat pocket. Sam looked at him in shock but then plastered on his best puppy dog eyes. “Are you okay? You’ve been hanging out with us for years and I’ve never seen any feathers lying around.”
Sam quickly packed a bag and headed for the door while Dean kicked his feet up on the map table, his last beer in his hand. He was so sick of having to buy more alcohol, of needing it just to get through the day when he wasn't on a hunt. Sam stopped just shy of the staircase. "You know, Jack could still bring him back. Have you tried praying-"
running through his head. Castiel must have sensed the doubt and the fear, because he pulled away from Dean just long enough to look into the forest of greens and browns in the hunter’s eyes. Cas gave him a soft, tender kiss on the on lips, before trailing down his jaw, his lips screaming reassurance. Dean’s rehearsed daydreams may have flown out the window, but all his doubt shattered like delicate stained glass. He heard the rustling of Cas removing his trench coat, and he thinks the sound is more deafening that it should be. His clumsy fingers go after Castiel’s tie, failing quite a few times before finally managing to undo it, and he wonders why he came undone more easily than the piece of fabric.
“No, I haven’t, because he doesn’t! His wings are just fucked up and he needs my help to fix them. So, if you’ll move out of my fucking way, that’s exactly what I’m going to do.” Dean shoved past Sam one last time, being much more forceful than he actually needed to be. Dean knew he was being childish, but just the thought that Sam might be right had him panicking. There was no way Cas felt the same, and to go into this thinking of it any other way would be disastrous. Dean was getting too close. No longer toeing at that line, but attempting to step over it now, and he needed to stop before he started hurting even more than he already had.
When Dean left the bathroom, he offered to buy Sam and Cas a slushie and tried not to think about how he went from having the best Christmas he had ever had to shooting up in a bathroom less than 24 hours later.
If you were at all confused by the Cuthbert Sinclair/Magnus story line, I would suggest rewatching episode 09x16, "Blade Runners".
When Dean realized that Cas had no intention of quickening the pace or bringing him any closer to finishing, he let go of Cas’ hair long enough to reach for the night stand, blindly fishing around in the drawer for the lube without looking away from Cas. He felt Cas’ lips stretch around his cock in something that resembled a smile as he tossed the bottle closer to Cas, and Cas grabbed it before it could even bounce on the bed.
“That’s fine, Sam. I’m still not completely sure if it’s a case, but I think it might be a skinwalker. I could handle it myself, but cases are more fun when you tag along.” Eileen laughed at how Sam immediately started blushing again, and Dean couldn’t stop grinning. Oh god, Sammy had it
Dean made his way over to the usual booth he sat in and plopped down angrily. He understood that Sam’s heart was in the right place and he was just trying to be a good brother, but he wasn’t in the mood to hear any of it after last night. The dream would have never happened had he never had to abuse Djinn magic if he didn’t have the mark. He really wasn’t in the mood to be lied to about a lead that could potentially remove it.
Dean stood up quickly, placing his beer on the coffee table and rubbing his sweaty palms against his jeans. Sometimes Cas having no social grace was funny, sometimes it was handy, but at times like this it was unbearable. “Wanna go down to the bar?”
Dean jolted awake to the sound of his cell phone ringing and groaned groggily before accepting the call and bringing it to his ear. “Hello?” He muttered gruffly, still rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
Realization flooded Dean’s senses and he immediately relaxed. The kid knew him from a case, so at least their cover wasn’t blown. “Jesus… you, uh, grew up.” He replied awkwardly. He glanced over at Sam and Sam was raising an accusatory eyebrow at him. “One of my first solo hunts.” Dean explained. “Dad was… he was around but he let me do the hunt on my own. I got my ass handed to me, but it all worked out.”
Cas quickly learned that he had no reason to insult Dean’s driving. While it was clear that he drove over the assigned speed limit, Dean was completely in his element behind the wheel of his car. He knew how it drove like the back of his hand, and Cas had never felt safer in a passenger seat.
“Of course, we’ll check it out.” Dean answered for Sam, shooting Cas a glare when he realized the angel had stolen the remote and turned the tv back to the documentary.
to be funny, but he was telling them a story about how when he was young and first created, he almost stepped on a fish that was attempting to haul itself onto the shore. He would have singlehandedly stopped the start of evolution had one of his brothers not stopped him, and the story really shouldn’t have been funny, but between the look of relived horror on Cas’ face, and Sam attempting not to laugh so hard that his own face was twisted in effort, Dean was laughing so hard that he had to hold his side because of the cramp forming. When Dean asked if the brother was Gabriel, and Cas responded that Gabriel would have only encouraged him to step on the fish, Sam finally lost it and started laughing along with Dean. Dean couldn’t wipe the grin off his face when he looked back and saw a small smile on Cas’ own.
Dean leaned against the Impala, folding his arms on the hood, thinking for a moment. “Yeah, man. I think they both really loved each other.”
“Well, I’m sure I’ll see you around. Or at least I hope so, Cas.” Dean shortened Castiel’s name because he felt like pulling out a term of endearment was laying it on a little
Dean swallowed hard and nodded, turning his attention to Castiel. “What about you, angel? What kind of celestial New Year’s resolutions do you have?” This was Dean deflecting, not longer wanting to talk about the subject of betrayal. Castiel knew better than to not take the outing when it was offered to him.
Dean laughed shakily, trying not to think about the searing pain coming from the mark of Cain on his forearm. “A lot better now that you’re here. Where’s Sam?”
“Ah…Dean…” Magnus chuckled, and began circling around Castiel, taking him in from all angles like a shark circling its prey. “When Crowley told me that he could get me an angel, do you know how difficult it was for me to believe that all it would take was an old voicemail left by Dean Winchester on one of Crowley’s old burner phones? Between that, and you stupidly calling Crowley yourself months ago… well, all it took then was a number you wouldn’t recognize and Crowley hitting play on the voicemail. He obviously doesn’t trust my magic much, he vanished the moment the call ended. If only he could see you now.”
One of the Men of Letters had a neat scrawl that filled page after page. Dean sat back down in a new chair, interested in what Djinn could possibly have to do with inventory in the bunker. He flipped to the start of the written chapter and began to read the excerpt.
“Well I’m gonna go on a beer run. I need a few drinks after everything I’ve seen tonight. Just try and fix ‘em up, alright, Cas?” The angel nodded at Bobby, already placing his index and middle finger to Sam’s forehead. Dean brushed past Bobby, taking the seat that was once his.
Dean wasn’t entirely sure how the whole gardening thing had started. Well, he wasn’t sure how he actually started
They ordered pizza and had it delivered to the convention center. They caught Charlie up on their lives, and Charlie caught them up on her time in Heaven while they waited in line for her autograph with Emma Watson. Sam told her about how successful her attempt to hook up high speed internet at the bunker was, and how it had helped him create an algorithm to track down Rowena. Their time was full of laughter, and almost like old times. Charlie kept subtly bringing attention to Dean and Cas’ closeness and Sam had to roll his eyes when it kept going over their heads.
“I enjoy all music. It’s one of my favorite things that humanity has created.” The angel’s eyes had returned to the field when Dean finally glanced back at him again.
Castiel’s phone rang. He pulled it from his trench coat pocket, reading the number carefully. It was not a number he was familiar with, and it worried him. Sam, Dean, Claire, Jody, and possibly Donna were the only people who could possibly have his number. It was possible that one of them had changed their number or gotten a new phone, it was something that hunters did frequently.
Castiel’s eyes scanned the diner and immediately found Ariel. She was sitting at a booth by herself, as promised, stirring a cup of coffee. There was a blueberry muffin sitting in front of her, untouched, and Cas wondered if she ordered it to look normal or if she too was indulging in human sustenance like he had been recently. He approached her booth slowly, aware of how reluctant she was to originally meet him. He was glad he had sent out Hasdiel to speak with her once she was located because he felt like the angel’s kindness and warmth played a large role in Ariel agreeing to meet him. Even in Heaven, she had been an angel that preferred to work alone and did not spend time with the other angels often.
“For what?” Dean asked, puzzled but returning his eyes to the road. He had started to swerve, his eyes resting on Cas’ smile a little too long.
“You know, that’s one of the most pleasant sounds to me. Your laugh.” Castiel observed Dean as he said this, tilting his head slightly. Dean felt his smile drop and his face grow a little hot. He had never received a compliment like that. Even if it did come from a weirdo in a trench coat.
him. Cas had seen him at his absolute worst in Hell and knew literally everything about him up until that point, and he
Cas was looking impossibly attractive, wearing his cheap, dark walmart v neck and jeans, which was practically naked in Dean’s book compared to the holy tax accountant get up that he was so used to. His hair was an absolute disaster from his nap earlier, his beautiful, blue eyes happy and focused solely on Dean. Happiness was a good look on Cas, and Dean was completely overwhelmed at the realization that he was the reason it was there. Cas was an
“Holy shit.” Sam muttered only loud enough for Dean and Cas to hear when one of the guards told them to wait. “That’s… that’s Emma Watson!”
Dean had been so grumpy about it that Castiel had strongly considered just not sleeping. He was needing less and less sleep, and his grace had been growing stronger after Magnus’ spells had weakened it. But Castiel was selfish and wanted to take any excuse to be close to Dean, even if Dean definitely didn’t seem to feel the same if slamming the bathroom door was any indication.
Later that day, Dean’s paranoia got the best of him and he texted Eileen to ask her if the bees could hurt his flowers. She sent a bunch of laughing emojis that Dean frowned at, but then FaceTimed him. Since he was sitting at the dinner table (definitely not eating Spaghetti-O’s straight from a can), he propped his phone up against his cheap fake fruit centerpiece. He wasn’t good at signing yet, and he knew very little, but he was
“Fuck.” Dean swallowed hard and hoped that Sam and Cas were okay. Dean noticed that Seb was staring at him oddly. “I got something on my face?”
This had been his mornings for a little over a year and a half. Dean had tried to continue fixing up his house, but he was starting to sink way too much money into it and the house was continuing to fall apart. Cas had insisted that Dean move in with him, which Dean had been more than okay with, regardless of how Cas was the furthest thing from a morning person. Dean had been at a total loss for what to do about his house until he spoke to Sam and Sam explained that he definitely had a case against the realtor for not giving an accurate depiction of the actual quality of the home.
The candles provided just enough light to illuminate their ‘playing board’. They had created a pentagram using duct tape and placed a candle on each point. In the middle of the pentagram was the most important part of the challenge. A piece of paper was placed in the dead center, with a cross drawn in the middle. The upper left corner of the cross and the lower right corner both had the word ‘yes’ written, while the upper right and lower left corner had the word ‘no’ written. One pencil was placed perfectly along the horizontal line of the cross while the other pencil was balanced on top of it, perfectly along the vertical line of the cross. It was time for the game to begin.
“How is he?” Sam asked earnestly. “And how are his wings? I have so many questions about them, but I know right now isn’t the best time to bring them up…”
Dean felt some of that petty annoyance he had experienced before return at full force. “Oh yeah, I’m
. But even before he knew that, he couldn’t even do a fucking hookup right because he was too busy thinking about the fact that the person he was kissing wasn’t his best friend, a
“Whatever you say, Dean.” Cas murmured with a soft smile. He wished that sentence didn’t carry more weight than flirty banter. Dean was easily one of the most stunning people he had ever seen, and it wouldn’t be hard for the mechanic to convince him to do just about anything with the right motivation.
The Djinn essence hit him like a crashing plane, both injections of it. He tripped towards his bed, but he knew something was wrong. Very wrong. Where he normally immediately felt calmer, freer,
Dean used it as an out to call it a night. Much like they always seemed to be lately, they were completely in the dark with this case, and between the drive, boring camera footage, and lack of a lead, his brain was fried.
This chapter is a lot longer than most of the others. I planned to break it up into two chapters, but most of the shippy stuff is in the second part of the chapter and didn't want you all to wait. Also, someone told me I should just do a long chapter instead of two chapters (hi, Emily).
There is an angel introduced in this chapter by the name of Ariel. It's pronounced Are-ree-el, not Air-ree-al like the mermaid. Just a heads up!
Sam dropped his hand from Dean’s shoulder and rubbed the back of his neck awkwardly. “What was that terrible advice you gave me in high school? ‘The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else’? or something like that?”
The moment Sam left, Cas sat directly across from Dean and tried to meet his eyes. Dean avoided his glance and grabbed a napkin. He began ripping it up in tiny bits just to have something to do with his hands. “Dean.” Cas said softly. “Don’t be mad at Sam. This was my idea.”
“Getting rid of the wee handsome angel, of course. He’s far too dedicated to the Winchesters and won’t let us touch a hair on their pretty little heads.”
“Dean, if this is an issue, I can wait to sleep once we get back to the bunker.” Castiel offered, sliding his dress shirt off his arms and draping it over his coats. He then reached for his belt, the buckle clanging loudly in the quiet room.
“Don’t worry about it, buddy. Just let me know if you need anything, okay? I’ll be right next door.” He gave Cas a gentle pat on the shoulder before heading towards the door. He hesitated in the doorway. “G’night, Cas.” He shot the angel a final smile before closing the door behind him, and tiredly trudging towards his own bedroom. He was exhausted, but he knew he was too restless to sleep because whether he wanted to admit it or not, he was
Castiel wasn’t sure what to write. There were plenty of areas that he knew he could improve in, plenty of wishes for the new year that would make sense to be a part of his New Year’s resolutions. He glanced up at Sam, who was already writing away diligently, and then over to Dean who seemed nervous. Castiel worried about him. Dean was probably obsessing over things he could change about himself, while Castiel would never want to change a thing about the hunter. Castiel started his list, trying to base the length of it on Sam’s so that his wouldn’t be too long or too short. He kept catching Dean looking at him out of the corner of his eye.
Ariel frowned at him before speaking. “I was. I’ve been in hiding for decades now. It’s been nice. I don’t wish to return to Heaven.” She fixed him with a look, clearly stating she didn’t expect him to change her mind.
love with him, but I definitely love him. I worry about him a lot. Sometimes he thinks he can take on things completely by himself and I wish he would just call me, so I could help him with the hunt. But he always tells me I would be a distraction.” She didn’t fight the smile that formed on her lips. ”But Jody is really over protective, and I feel like I should tell her, but if she doesn’t like him…” She shook her head, finally meeting Cas’ gaze again. “Alex just keeps telling me to go for it. She said that he reminds her a lot of Dean- which is fucking gross- but she said that Jody will love him as long as I’m safe. I just know that she’s going to completely grill him the first time they meet.”
Dean fought against his restraints, his ankles and wrists rubbed raw from the constant friction. Despite Alastair’s teasing, his continued to scream and fight, because that’s what he did. He fought until there was nothing left in him, he always had to, and he wasn’t going to stop now. He felt blood running down his body, surprised that he could feel its warmth because of the heat of the pit. Flames licked around him, close enough to cause his skin to sting, but not enough to burn him.
Ariel took a sip of her coffee and stared at her plate for a moment. She finally met Castiel’s gaze again, her light brown eyes tender. “I may have left Heaven long ago, but the angels are still my family.
It was one of those moments when Dean could barely resist the urge to lean into Cas. There was that cosmic pull that he had no control over that pushed him to cross over that line of
“What happened?” Cas asked, trying to mirror Sam, though he hadn’t quite worked out the soft tone that coaxed information out of people.
The extra struggling hadn’t done him any good. He was still strapped to Magnus’ table on his stomach. His wings were still in some contraption that force them to spread far apart and prevented them from flapping. Castiel was able to ignore all of this until Magnus brought down a mallet onto the coracoid of his right wing. The blow pulled a scream from his throat as he heard the bone crunch under the weight of the mallet. His scream echoed throughout the abandoned building and bounced off the walls.
“If you two are done bickering like a married couple, I’m going into the library to write down my resolutions really quick. Are we supposed to share it with the class when we’re done, Mr. Winchester?” Sam said mockingly, tucking a strand of hair behind his ear.
but they needed to start working on a plan b because he wasn’t sure how much longer he could hold on.
The door swung open, causing Dean to stumble into the tiny dressing room. He got a good look at Cas, and suddenly his lungs weren’t working. There was nothing spectacular about the way he looked, he was just in cheap, Walmart jeans and an even cheaper, plain, black v neck, but it completely took Dean’s breath away. Cas’ hair was an absolute disaster from trying on a bunch of shirts, and he was staring at Dean with wide, blue eyes, taking in their accidental proximity. Dean could feel saliva flooding his mouth, and he worked his throat, swallowing roughly. “The button is stuck?” He questioned dumbly.
Dean just scoffed, hiking his canvas tote further up his shoulder, sending Castiel one last glare before making the trek back to the Impala.
. He would even deal with some holes in his clothing here and there. But once something had bleach on it, it went in the trash. He was not about to be one of the douchebags that wore acid washed jeans, even if it wasn’t intentionally.
Castiel and Ariel spent most of the night (or evening in local time) in Bora Bora attempting to track Gabriel. Due to having their wings back, the travel was fast work, but Gabriel apparently did not want to be found if he was truly still alive. Ariel had still been hesitant to reach out to Gabriel, but she and Castiel both agreed the timing was right. They needed to try and find the truth before any more suspicious activity attracted the other angels and the rumor spread that Gabriel could still be alive.
The rest of the drive back to Kansas was mostly small talk that Dean was using to avoid conversations about the mark, or to keep his mouth from blurting out things that sounded a lot like flirting with Cas. They stopped at Taco Bell for dinner, which Cas didn’t like at all (Dean was a little heartbroken), and later stopped at a gas station to get gas. When Dean paid, he also grabbed Cas a pack of Skittles, figuring maybe he would like to try some candy. He couldn’t help but smile when the look on Cas’ face made it abundantly clear that he was forgiven for the Taco Bell.
She nodded, her hair bouncing slightly. She uncrossed and crossed her legs nervously, pulling at the hem of her skirt. “As far as I can tell, this is just a rumor, but I thought the rumor would be something of import to you. It’s about our brother… Gabriel.” Castiel immediately tented his eyebrows in shock. Gabriel was supposed to be dead. “Yes, I know. He’s supposed to be dead.” She answered his unasked question. “But if the rumor is true, this wouldn’t be the first time he’s faked his death. There has been some activity on the western coast of Bora Bora that seems very…trickster.” She rolled her eyes, equal parts fond and vexed. Ariel was very familiar with Gabriel’s knavery. When she was in Heaven, she ended up developing a close relationship with the archangel. Being the angel of protection, she often had to chastise Gabriel for his impulsive, risky decisions and remind him that his actions impacted Heaven. She always seemed exasperated by her older brother, but Castiel always knew there was some endearment there as well. Gabriel often had that combined affect on others.
Dean took a breath and just shook his head. It was time for a subject change, this was making him feel like shit. “So, you still tasting molecules or whatever?”
Cas didn’t laugh. Well, he did. But it was rare, it didn’t have this ease or familiarity to it. “Good morning to you too.” Cas said to Dean’s fucking boner, like life was some fucked up episode of
“You know, if someone would have tried to tell me that Dean would be anything but this skirt chasing playboy, I wouldn’t have believed them. But then you came into the picture. You changed a lot of things, Cas. You’ve changed a lot of Dean. It
“Wait! Uh, can I… can I keep this one?” Dean asked. He was pretty sure it was a primary feather based on how strong and large it was. Cas was staring at him with an unreadable expression. “I mean, it’s just kind of awesome, you know? I’m the first human to ever see or touch angel wings and they’re
"Cas just... just shut up for a second." Dean interrupted, putting his hand on Cas' shoulder. "I know...I know I sorta froze up back there. I wanted you to stop talking back there, but not because I didn't want to hear what you had to say. I did, just... not like that. I didn't want you to tell me you loved me only to leave me, only to have to lose you
, Dean. You refused to leave until you got Cas back. You actually take pictures of him on your phone, even though I’ve heard you say countless times that you hate pictures. You intentionally skip ahead when watching a show with him so when you actually watch it with him, you can focus more on his reaction than the actual show. You complain about him constantly, but the moment anyone else says anything about him, you fly in to defend him so fast that I almost get whiplash. And yeah, for years I tried to dismiss all of this as the fact that for the first time in your life, you actually had a friend that you could trust with everything you have. But once things started adding up, they didn’t stop. So, yeah, I
Cas narrowed his eyes at him, but the kid just gave him a cheeky grin and grabbed a mop to help him clean up. “Thanks, Kevin. You didn’t have to help.” Cas said once the floors and counter were spotless. Kevin even offered to change the slushee contents himself so that Cas could go ahead and clock out.
to find a cure for the mark. Meanwhile, Castiel tried to restore some order to Heaven when the other angels called to him for help when things became total chaos. Cas was able to restore as much of Heaven as possible (being forced to kill Metatron), and all the angels got their wings back, along with Castiel's grace being restored. The other angels insisted that he lead Heaven in God's absence, but Cas was far too preoccupied by trying to find Dean and helping him with the Mark, and he split his time between Heaven and earth, only helping the other angels when he could.
Dean had never sat up faster in his life. He could feel the mark dulling the pain from his broken ribs and aching head. He could feel the mark searing on his arm. He could feel the hatred and anger coursing through his veins as the mark started up with a steady mantra of
“Yes, I’ll cut up some fruit, Sammy.” Dean groaned dramatically. “Even though the jelly on the toast counts as fruit.”
Cas could hear his blood rushing in his ears, and feel it rushing south. That sounded suspiciously like a proposition. He
Narrowing her eyes, Andrisha looked Dean up and down observantly. “You don’t look much like a detective. Undercover, I’m guessing?” Dean nodded. “Well, I’m sorry Detective Morrison, but I don’t know anything about the attacks. I know one of the victims was a regular here. A really pretty girl. This wasn’t really here scene though. When she came in, she was always decked out in cheap Hot Topic apparel, but anytime you saw her around town she wouldn’t be dressed like that.”
Cas nodded empathetically, taking the bait. “I do believe this house is very old. A lot older than mine. What brought you out to the middle of nowhere?”
Dean and Cas both looked up at the same time, seeing a small branch of mistletoe poorly taped to the doorframe that they were both standing under. Cas just observed the branch curiously while all the color drained from Dean’s face. He was going to fucking
Sam. Sam had his phone out and snapped a picture, then immediately burst into a fit of laughter and Dean threw his empty milkshake cup at him.
.” Natasha snapped. “Ted isn’t here today and I’m not dragging your ass all over the place. Magnus let up on the mobility curse and you’ll be able to walk but he doesn’t have all day.”
“I’m alright.” Dean shrugged. “I… I’m better now that you’re back.” Dean abruptly crawled off Castiel, dropping on the bed next to him with a bounce. He picked at a piece of fuzz on the comforter nervously as Castiel sat up to cross his legs and face him. “I…. I feel like shit about all of this, Cas. I should’ve known there was something wrong sooner, but I… I thought you just didn’t want to talk to me. I thought after you found me, you just couldn’t look at me the same and wanted nothing to do with me.”
Cas’ voice replayed in Dean’s head for the millionth time in the last few hours, reminding him that Cas was only a phone call or a prayer away. Dean could pray to him right now, and he could zap into the back seat of the Impala before Dean even said ‘amen’. But there was no way in hell Dean was doing that, not when it made him feel like a needy teenage girl asking ‘so, what are we?’ after the first date. He would just talk to Cas whenever he came back. Dean cranked the Impala and kept the windows down, the warm spring weather creeping in. He pointedly ignored the way Sam was looking him as they pulled out of the Burger King parking lot, but it apparently wasn’t enough to keep Sam from poking.
just hearing Cas say his name in that voice added at least three new scenarios to his spank bank. Dean was suddenly the one flustered, and almost forgot his bag with his pie before remembering to snatch it up at the last second before turning to head to his car.
“I could heal you.” Cas offered. He observed Dean with a head tilt. “You’re sweating… a lot. Are you running a fever?”
Cas pressed another kiss to Dean’s skin, this time his shoulder. “Well, we can both worry. Tomorrow. Right now we need sleep.”
Dean stripped himself of his jeans, immediately bringing them to the washer, tossing them in, and hoping for the best. He could get blood out of
Cas’ eyes shot up to Sam and he looked absolutely scandalized. “No.” He said in a voice that left no room for argument.
“If your pool skills are anything like your skills at the gun range, I don’t think I have anything to worry about.” Dean replied cockily, a teasing grin on his face.
person was the reason why Dean’s garden was completely infested with a bunch of bees who were dicks. Dean started making his way towards the hives to tell his neighbor to keep the bees in his yard when he stopped himself. Not one of his brightest ideas. He didn’t have a suit and he was pretty sure it was impossible to force bees to stay anywhere because they were wild animals. Dean just huffed a frustrated sigh and hauled himself back over the fence into his yard.
“Ugh, coffee. Thank god.” Dean said, grabbing the cup out of Sam’s hand greedily. Dean was already dressed and sitting on the edge of his bed, ‘not’ watching Dr. Sexy M.D.
Dean chuckled. He was flirting so hard that he didn’t even bother to introduce himself. “I’m Dean. Dean Winchester.”
Dean licked his lips nervously, because that sounded a hell of a lot like flirting. “Of course, Cas. But only if you’re done being grumpy towards me.”
“Uh, I’ll probably need you to lie down to get the back of wings. If you’re on the bed, you should be able to spread your wings out a little more.” Dean muttered. Cas obliged immediately, tucking in his wings temporarily so that he could lie down on his stomach on the bed. Dean cursed himself for once again not thinking shit through, because literally the only position that made sense for him to reach all the feathers was if he straddled Cas’ hips. So, he did. And had never felt more lightheaded in his entire life.
Castiel was distractedly flipping through television channels as Sam and Dean changed into their suits. His mouth was pressed into a thin line, and his eyebrows furrowed as he rested on Jerry Springer, seeming to be immediately taken by this particular episode of trash tv. Dean watched him as he buttoned up his shirt, curious as to what could possibly being going through that messy head of his.
Dean bit his lip. This would be a good opportunity to fill up on pain meds for his first aid kit, he was running low after a particular bad case involving a werewolf a couple of weeks ago. But he had a feeling this guy was on a hell of a lot more than Vicodin. “Do you have anything for pain?” He asked carefully. He was a solid ninety-eight percent sure this guy wasn’t an undercover cop, but hunter’s instinct taught him to use caution in every decision he made.
“Cas.” Dean croaked hoarsely, his body immediately sagging towards Castiel in relief despite his arms being pulled taut.
“I couldn’t do it.” Cas finally met Dean’s gaze. “When it was you, I couldn’t do it. That’s why I could never kill you. Even if the Mark took a turn for the worst, even if you became a demon again, I wouldn’t be able to kill you. I would watch you scorch the earth and destroy everyone you love, and I still wouldn’t be strong enough to kill you.”
“It’s no problem, man. We’ve all been there. That machine was a pain in my ass when I first started working here, but now I could change it in the dark. Didn’t you say you’re new to Lawrence on Tuesday? How are you liking it so far?” Kevin asked, squeezing a large dollop of hand sanitizer into his hands.
To Dean’s shock, after a few drinks, Sam was actually the one hustling. Sam often still had his moments where he preached about a ‘honest living’, and seemed to think he was above hustling some drunk bastards at a bar. Dean watched him proudly, making his way back over to the bartender to order another beer. He took a seat on a barstool, dizziness settling over him slowly. Okay, so maybe he was just a little more drunk than he was planning to be. But today had been rough, and he certainly wasn’t thinking about some ghost that just assumed everyone liked it up the ass anymore.
