Of course Tony wanted to do something nice for Steve. He was sure that his husband had some sort of idea about what he had planned, but Tony tried to keep it as vague as possible. “Keep Saturday night free. We have plans,” was all Tony had said.
When Tony turned around with what he needed he saw Steve sitting on the edge of the bed with Peter sitting on his knee. Peter was looking up at the soldier as he spoke and suddenly Tony noticed that Steve was holding a Captain America plushie.
At first finding the bases was difficult. But once they found one location there were usually other coordinates in the files. That was how they found their latest target. This one seemed suspicious, though. Normally locations could be found on computers, but this one was only written down in a notebook that they had found. In fact, most of the group thought it didn’t exist. Steve had to beg the group to go check it out, and in the end only Sam and Clint had come along.
“What happened to you Steve?” Tony breathed, lifting his hand to brush a stray tear from Steve’s face. It was clear this was not the Steve from his timeline. This Steve was different.
“Hey Dad!” Peter said, fighting back the tears. He hated seeing his dad alone like this. Especially when it was nearly Christmas. And if Peter felt horrible during the holiday season, he could be sure that the inventor felt even worse.
There were only two candidates for which kid could be his, but Tony already knew it was the kid on the couch. He wanted to go over there. He wanted to wake the kid and just look at him. He seemed to be the age where children could talk. Not well, but they could. Was this kid even developed enough that he could speak? Tony wanted to do so much, but the image of the kid sleeping stopped him. He wouldn’t disturb him. Not that face. So Tony opted to just staring at him from afar.
“They were at one point,” Tony said flatly. “Long gone before Steve got there though.” There was a pregnant pause as Pepper tried to decide what to say to Tony, but the man continued to speak before Pepper could say anything. “Mary Fitzpatrick Parker. The mother of my son,” Tony muttered, still looking at the screen.
All of the Avengers were there, of course, since it was a party to thank them all, again, for saving the city. This time little damage had been done to the city, so it really was something to celebrate! The entire team did small photo shoots and interviews in their formal wear before moving to the open bar and dance floor where the rest of the guests were dancing.
“You too Capsicle. And for God’s sake get a haircut,” And in an instant the man was gone, leaving Steve alone by the car.
“I mean...you’re not wrong,” Tony said, running his hand through his hair. “But what I’m wondering right now is...what are you still doing here?” Tony asked.
“Oh Peter, no buddy.” Tony said, his face falling as the tone in his voice fell as well. “I-I-I’m not your dad. Okay. There is a big difference between a dad and a father and-”
“That’s okay,” Tony said after taking a deep breath. “I’ll teach you. It’s pretty easy! Now lay down so I can change you,” Tony instructed as he pulled out the changing mat, and a fresh diaper. He was sure he needed more, but he wasn’t really sure what. He had only changed a wet diaper, and other than that he had no experience with this. He was kind of winging it.
“That’s right, we were,” the soldier confirmed and then the two fell into silence. Tony had calmed down considerably, but Steve was going to give him as much time as he needed. The silence was cut off, though, by the sounds of Tony sobbing against his husband’s chest.
It was almost hypnotic as the hips swayed from side to side in rhythm with the music. And slowly a warm sensation started to build in Steve’s core. He knew that Tony had a good figure, sure, but he hand never seen it at so many angles. He never knew that Tony’s body was so…attractive. He never really knew that Tony could dance that that. But it made him want to do naughty things to the man.
Tony tried not to think about that and continued thinking of a solution. Peter would need someone a bit closer that could nurture him. For some reason Tony thought of Pepper, but that thought instantly went away. One, because he knew Pepper couldn’t handle a child (especially his) and two because
The one thing that made his head spin, though, was when he read about the women who had died while carrying his children. Of course none of those children had survived. Steve couldn’t tell if he felt relieved, sad, or upset. But one thing he did know was that he felt responsible, even if it wasn’t his fault.
“You need to get your life together, Captain,” Loki said after a moment. “A drunken mess does not look good on you,” the man said as he took away the cup that Steve was holding in his hand. Steve opened his mouth to object but nothing came out. So all he could do was wipe away the tears that were drying on his face. “Get a life, seriously. It is not fair. But you have to pick yourself and make something out of nothing.” Loki said before taking a swig of Steve’s drink. “Besides, are you not luckier than most men? You can travel through time. Use that to your advantage.” Loki said, shrugging as he finished off the drink.
It was nearly three in the morning, and Tony was still awake. Both he and Pepper had taken up camp next to Peter’s bed. They quietly talked back and forth between each other for a good part of the night. Pepper would get all of the legal stuff sorted out so that Peter would actually exist in the eyes of the government. From there they worked out getting a room ready for Peter. Tony wasn’t sure how long Peter would stay with him, but both he and Pepper thought it was a good idea to give Peter his own room. From there they talked about little things, but soon Pepper fell asleep.
By the time Steve had realized that he was staring, Tony had noticed the gaze of his boyfriend and was dancing towards the solider. Not only had Tony noticed where Steve’s eyes were directed, but he also noticed how aroused Steve seemed to be. It wasn’t hard to notice the bulge in the Captain's pants.
“First I would suggest getting wipes, and baby powder. You’ll need them later. As well as a trashcan nearby.” Friday’s voice rang out. As she spoke Peter quietly looked up at the ceiling with a wide smile on his face.
“Right. Meaning tomorrow is Christmas. And do you have any idea what you just did to this ham?” Steve asked, slightly shaking the gold item in his hands.
“Peter. Please don’t play dumb. You left the ham out in the kitchen all day. I brought the groceries home after my morning run, and I asked you to put them away while I was at work. It’s been almost nine hours.” Steve said with a groan. “I’ve spent almost seventy dollars on meat and you’ve spoiled half of it!” Steve said, dropping the ham on the counter. “What am I supposed to feed our guests tomorrow night!?” Steve asked in frustration.
The movie was about fifteen minutes deep when Steve’s eyes found themselves wandering. He looked over the cityscape for a long moment before he watched a small flickering light launch itself from the river and high into the sky. He knew exactly what it was, but he couldn’t help but jolt as the light exploded into the sky. The explosion sent brightly colored lights in every direction and a defining rumble ripped through his eardrum. Fireworks.
“Next Stop, Eighth Street,” The voice over the subway system called out, dragging Peter from his thoughts.
So the team collected it all. Normally the group would camp at the base for a few days and then send the files they had found back to Wakanda where T’Challa would keep it safe. From there they would spend a few weeks in Wakanda or Clint's farm to recharge before heading out to the next location.
During the time in between Tony had come up with quite the plan for their evening. Dinner on a private yacht in the early evening, watching the sun set over the water before making their way to the Brooklyn Bridge Park. It was one of their favorite parks, and it would have a beautiful view of the city as night fell. It wouldn’t be completely vacant, but it would be private enough that they could enjoy themselves together as they walked along the paths. And from there, the two would end the night with one of the outdoor movies that played in the park on the weekends. It was supposed to be some old 1930’s comedy that he was sure Steve would like.
“And that’s where you’re wrong kiddo,” Tony said as he lifted a shaky hand and rested it on Peter’s shoulder. “We...We are...We’re connected in a lot more ways than you think.” Tony was having a lot of emotions coming up and he wasn’t sure if he should bring the subject up now, but before he could fully think, words were coming out of his mouth.
It was definitely Tony, though. He didn’t seem asleep, but he didn’t seem like he was paying much attention to the TV. It was playing
The two stood there in shock, staring at each other before the girl rushed forward and gave Steve a hug.
So, I have been pretty busy lately but I really wanted to get this chapter out by the end of the week. I honestly just wanted to write all the fluffy scenes with Tony and Peter, but I really needed to do this chapter. I know my writing is crap, I apologize. Anyways, if you still want to read...well...enjoy!!
It takes two more days for the next video to arrive. It contains the same stomach churning gore of Tony’s torture. They can all see how the genius slowly withering, despite how he still has his sass intact.
‘Don’t worry I’ll marry you when you reach forty, Antoshka, if you couldn’t find your soulmate,’ Natasha tells him one time he vents to her about his single-ness predicament.
Where is he? What is this cold, semi-dark place that smells of rust and decay? He tries to rummage his hazy brain for clues. And the only thing that answers him back is more pain. God, his head feels like he’s been hammered by Thor himself. It takes him back to those mornings with a hangover. Only worse.
Why is Steve even down here with him? Why can’t Steve sketch somewhere else? Ugh! How many gods did he piss off to be tortured like this? And that all-too-small shirt that Steve is wearing doesn’t help him control his ogling.
And Tony just needs to say Steve’s name back and Captain America will know that he’s mated to no other than one problematic Tony Stark. Damn, all his baggages that Steve has to carry around if the genius let
He can’t imagine coming out and saying it so bluntly. He'd sound like a fool or a teenager with a silly crush. So, he’ll have to make do with what he can get away with: be his usual, flirty, sauve self. Steve would not get the wrong impression because he’s been a victim — countless of times — of Tony’s debauch personality.
‘Is that why you need me?’ The blade sinks further. ‘As leverage?’ He chuckles darkly and the man leans back away, looking at Tony like the genius has lost his mind. ‘That’s a very stupid plan.’
“Need help?” A baritone voice called from the once closed door. And there was Steve, standing there with that lopsided grin and messy hair. Tony felt his heart flutter for a moment as he thought about the old days, but he quickly suppressed those thoughts. He couldn’t think like that.
“We’re at my place now. I mean, this isn’t where I live...but this is where I bring people when they’re sick or hurt.” Tony began as he continued to look out of the panel of windows.
From there the two had wondered around the living area a bit more before Pepper cornered them in the common room. She was adamant about Peter needing a haircut because his hair was
“I found a place. It’s an hour away. Don’t worry,” The seventeen year old responded, trying to move past, but Steve put his hands on Peter’s shoulders, giving him a concerned look. “Peter. It’s okay. You don’t have to go out and do this. I forgive you.” Steve said, squeezing Peter’s shoulder.
“Hey Tony,” Steve hummed a sad smile on his face as he looked up to see the inventor staring back at him. He was still wearing that old suit they had found before coming on to the base the first time. “What are you doing here? Shouldn’t you be back in your time?” the blonde asked.
As the door came off, Steve came face to face with a blonde girl who stood a few feet away from the door. She was young, maybe sixteen, but definitely no more than eighteen. And she looked sick. Her skin was pale and sticky like she had a fever or had been sweating a lot. Bags hung under her hazel eyes as she looked at Steve and the soldier noticed that she was very pregnant.
“Tony,” Steve warned. “The only good time is, well, not a good time. I do something pretty shitty to you, and even though you say we’re on good terms, it’s still hard to believe. I honestly don’t think there is a good time,” Steve admitted.
Everything was perfect, and then suddenly it wasn’t. And Tony had no idea why but suddenly he was panicking. He heard the loud noise from the river and then suddenly he was in the sky, fighting the chitauri as everything exploded around him. Another firework went off and suddenly Tony was back in Afghanistan, alone behind a rock as bullets rained down on him and bombs went off in every direction.
“Okay,” the inventor huffed quietly as he reached up and scratched the back of his neck. “Do you want to see him?” Tony then asked as he looked back up at Pepper.
“They’re not just testing on people,” Bailey interjected as she looked at the three men. “I think this is some sort of breeding program for super-humans,” she explained. “I mean...I haven’t been here long, not like Peter here,” She said, wiggling the hand the the boy was holding. “They took me off the streets like….eight months ago. I don’t understand a lot about what they were doing, but they have been getting a lot of girls pregnant. I’m pretty sure none of the girls have survived after their babies are born though. Actually, most of the babies don’t survive either.”
A song with a Latin flair came over the speakers and everyone in the room seemed to recognize the song, except Steve. He didn’t think much of it. Instead he took another sip of his drink and continued to watch everyone dance.
“Or I can just sleep here with you,” Peter offered innocently. A nervous laugh bubbled out of Tony’s throat and he shook his head as he sat up.
And sure, besides returning the stones, Steve had only ever been to space once, but it was nothing like he had expected. Sure some aliens had blue, green, or pink skin, and some had extra eyes, or looked like slug monsters. They were aliens. But the thing Steve was taken back by was that there were aliens that looked very...human. It was surprisingly easy for him to adapt, and in a few weeks Steve was easily blending in with the crowd. The other surprising thing was that alien liquor got him drunk. Like really drunk.
Tony had made it sound so easy, he really did. He said it with ease and in that moment, Steve had never felt so empowered. So he listened to what Tony had to say. He went back to his apartment and collected some things and soon he was making his way to 2016.
Tony’s head slowly turned to the staircase and he let out a nervous whine as he scrubbed his face. He really didn’t want to do this. He didn’t want to see this kid. He wasn’t good with kids. He was sure he would screw this up. But at the same time he felt responsible. So taking in a deep breath, Tony descended the staircase.
“Of course. I’m sure you still are,” Tony said as he tapped the screen to show a shot of Steve, Tony, and Scott standing in an alleyway before all three of them disappear. “You left with the scepter, and honestly, I was a little worried,” Tony said, eyeing Steve. “But then Jarvis tells me a few seconds later, a man that looks like Steve Rogers with a beard had returned it to it’s case,” Tony said as the screen shifted one more time to show Steve returning the scepter. “The thing is Cap, you didn’t leave like the other versions of us. You just walked out the front door...and as far as Jarvis knew, you didn’t disappear. Since then I’ve been keeping tabs on you. So, what are you still doing here?” Steve let out a heavy sigh but Tony just smiled and shook his head. “I’m assuming it’s a long story. I cleared my schedule for the day, so let’s hear it,” The inventor said, watching Steve carefully.
“Are you hungry?” Peter asked as he eyed Steve who was now sitting down at the table across from Peter.
“Oh my god,” She cried, her body shaking as she held on to Steve tightly. “I-I’m being saved by Fucking Captain America,” She said before burying her head into Steve’s shoulder. Steve was obviously very taken back by what was happening, but was quick to snap out of it as he rested a hand on the girl’s shoulder.
“Sure. Sure,” Tony said as he stood up as well. “I’ll walk you outside, okay?” He said as he walked with his son to the elevator. It was silent as they made their way to the front doors. “Text me when you get home, okay? You may be seventeen now, but I still worry about you kid,” Tony hummed.
“Friday, please tell me how to change a diaper,” Tony said hesitantly as Peter obeyed, laying down on the mat. With that Tony pulled up the T-shirt Peter was wearing so that his bottom was free from obstruction. Now he could see that Peter was pretty full. “A very poopy diaper,” Tony specified as he eyed the bulging material.
“A father?” Peter asked, a little confused. Tony only nodded, prompting Peter to answer the question. “A father is someone who is related to a child. They share the same DNA...usually,” Peter said as he blinked up at Tony.
When Pepper walked into the kitchen area of the living-space, she was surprised to see Tony and Peter sitting at the table with eggs, turkey-bacon, and apple slices on each plate. Honestly the eggs looked overcooked, the bacon looked a little more crispy than it should for peak taste, and the apples were cut askew with seeds still on some of the edges of the fruit. But when Pepper looked over to Peter, he was eating the food with a big smile on his face. It was clear he was enjoying himself, and Pepper didn’t want to say anything to ruin that.
“I’m going, I’ll be back,” Peter called out as he pulled on a hoodie and stepped out of the apartment door.
“Tony,” A strong voice sounded from behind him and suddenly the man felt himself being pulled up from off the ground and against a strong chest. “You’re okay. You’re okay,” The voice soothed. “I got you. Just follow my breathing, okay. You got this,” The voice said as a hand came up and rested on Tony’s head. Now Tony could feel the person taking deliberate breaths, and even though he knew he should be trying to match the breathing, he couldn’t.
“Alright,” Steve said with a kind smile as he put a firm hand on Bailey’s shoulder. “I’ll stay with you once everyone is accounted for.” And with that he turned to Sam. “After that, Can you start collecting information while I arrange for everyone to be extracted?”
“Mr. Stark!” The young girl said as tony walked by the door, only to backpedal quickly. As he did so, he could hear some shuffling around in the room and before Tony could fully open the door, it was opened for him. A man in his mid fifties stood before him. He looked like an absolute wreck, but he had a wide grin on his face.
Opening the door to the apartment quietly, Peter made his way towards his room. He just needed his card, and another dose of Nyquil. If Pops didn’t see him, it would make things even better.
“No prison can hold me for long,” Loki chuckled. “Besides, I can catch up on some reading, relax during my time there. I’m in need of it,” Loki said before standing up, clapping Steve on the shoulder.
I know this chapter is super short, but I just wanted to get started on this....so think of this as a short prologue or something... hehe.
“Hey, I’m sorry. I’m all for telling Stark, but you absolutely cannot call him from here,” Sam protested.
“Tony didn’t hurt you Peter,” Steve soothed. “He’s just trying to help you. He even told you it might hurt,” Steve hummed. “C’mon, just hold on to me and it won’t hurt in a minute,” Steve prompted.
Steve Stark-Rogers stood in the kitchen with hell in his eyes as he held a gold wrapped item in his hands. Upon further inspection Peter decided that it was a ham. But why did he look so angry? Okay, he was wearing his winter coat…so he was just outside but…
The final part of the night began when the two approached the movie on the lawn. Steve eyed Tony for a long moment and the smaller man was quick to catch his gaze.
“Okay,” Peter said as he leaned forward and wrapped his arms around Tony. “I love you dad,” He said, his voice hoarse as he spoke. “I love you, I’m sorry I can’t stay longer. I wish I could.” Peter said. He was so mad. Why did he always have to please one parent and make the other suffer? Why couldn’t things be a win-win for once?
Suddenly Tony didn’t care about the perfect anniversary date that he had worked so hard on. He didn’t care about the angry spectators who’s view he was obscuring. Hell, he didn’t even care about Steve who looked so alarmed as he tried to get Tony’s attention. He just needed out.
“It might. But remember, you’re brave. You got this,” Tony said as he securely took Peter’s wrist in his hand before spreading out his fingers. Tony could feel the tremors that began to shake through the boy’s body but before he could say anything, Steve was already doing so.
Tony took the man’s hand and gave a firm handshake before he walked into the room so that he could see the two adults better, as well as Bailey and the other occupants. Pepper simply stood in the doorway and watched.
“Sorry,” both men said in unison. Steve kept his head down avoiding eye contact as he tried to push past the man who he had just hit, but suddenly the man spoke up.
“Right okay,” Tony hummed as he eyed Peter’s diaper. Honestly this was giving him a lot of anxiety. He had never done anything like this. Part of him wanted to ask Pepper for help, but another part of him didn’t want any help because god dammit, he was the kid’s father. He would need to know how to do this sooner or later.  “Okay. You got this,” Tony said as his hands hovered over the tabs of the diaper. “You’re Tony Stark for god sakes. You can do anything. So that means you can change a diaper,” Tony muttered to himself before taking one more deep breath and going for it. In one fluid movement he was awkwardly picking Peter’s ankles up, and the next he was undoing the diaper.
From there the two fell into a comfortable silence of just eating. They stayed like that for a while and Peter seemed to be content with it. Steve simply ate his food as he watched Peter eat his own. When the little boy was finished, Steve got up to take his plate and wash it, but the little boy opened his mouth before he could touch the plate.
“I-I-I-” Tony stammered as he quickly wiped his face with a hand before looking over at Peter. “Yeah Peter, I am,” Tony said, cracking a nervous smile. Peter seemed to like this answer because a smile spread across his face, going from ear to ear.
“Actually,” Steve muttered, biting his lip. “I was wondering if i could come with,” He said and there was a long, pregnant pause. ‘I-I mean if that’s okay,” he stammered. “I just wanted to make sure everyone got to their families and everything,” he explained. Tony was taken back by Steve’s request and it took him a moment to respond, but even the inventor as surprised by his own words.
“I’m pretty sure their testing people here. Like Wanda and Pietro,” Steve explained. “Though I’m sure these-” Steve cut off and looked at the two before continuing. ‘-kids are not here willingly.”
“I sure am,” Steve said as a small smile spread across his face. The food Tony had cooked was out on the table so Steve simply grabbed a spare plate and began to serve himself some eggs and bacon.
“Never.” Steve said, squeezing the boy’s shoulders. “He won’t be mad at you. Just the bad people who had you.” Steve explained. “You did nothing wrong though, understand?” Steve asked as he pulled away enough so that he could take Peter’s chin in his hand and tilt it up so they were looking at each other.  Peter just blinked up at the blonde ban a few times, as if trying to find the right words.
The teen now lifted his head and sat up, the comforter sliding off of his body and onto the bed. The boy knew that Steve probably wasn’t shouting too loud, but in his state, everything seemed too loud.
“And to what do I owe the pleasure of this call?” Pepper asked. She didn’t seem annoyed, but maybe a little amused. The last time they had talked was last week about a deal with the company, and things had ended a bit heated.
Without suitable pajamas, Tony opted for getting one of his old T-shirts for Peter to wear. Tony took Peter into his room and showed him around before finally stopping by the closet to get a shirt. It was an old gray T-shirt that said
“Oh we have,” Lynette said with a small laugh. “He was here when we arrived. But don’t sell yourself short Mr. Stark,” the woman said as she gave Tony a smile. “Because without you our daughter wouldn’t be getting such exceptional care...and she’s safe. So Thank you Mr. Stark.” The mother said, doing her best not to cry like her husband was now doing.
“I’m sorry,” Tony interjected again. “I don’t know what happened. I've never freaked out like that with fireworks. I’ve been fine I just...I heard the noise and didn’t know where it was coming from and suddenly I was back in Afghanistan and fighting and-”
A part of Peter seemed to feel embarrassed that he liked the movie, because that was one movie that he and Pops loved to watch every year, and then suddenly Peter understood why Tony was watching it. Peter’s heart hurt even more.
“That’s not anything new,” Tony said, letting out a light laugh. “Come on Cap, people are going to start staring, let’s get out of here,” The inventor said as he towed the man out of the alley and towards a car that was parked outside of the camp.
“Tony,” Pepper said in a warning tone. “You needed sleep too. It’s not like anyone is going to blame you for-”
“I’m here to help miss,” Steve said has he strode towards the door before putting and hand on the handle. Of course it was locked. “I’m going to get you out of here,okay? Just bare with me for a moment,” He said before literally ripping the door from it’s hinges.
Silverink58 did a commission for me from the last scene in Chapter 8. It's directly below this. It is absolutely beautiful and I couldn't be happier! They did such a wonderful job. - Make sure to check out their work on Tumblr!
“Yeah..of course,” Tony said as he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. “Listen, I need to get files from these computers here...You know, make sure we know what they were doing here, get the information we need on all the kids, that sort of thing.” Tony said. Plus, he really just wanted to know more about the kid. “I’m going to get F.R.I.D.A.Y. started on collecting all of that and uh...I’ll just meet you back here in a few hours,” Tony said as he pointed his thumb behind him, towards the double door.
“I like Mr. America better,” Peter said as he took the plushie from Steve. “But I like it. Thank you.”  And with that he tucked the stuffed version of Steve under his arm securely.
“But this is where I’m from Peggy. I never should have been pulled from this time but I was, and now I have the opportunity to come back. I have you.”
me know all that stuff. It’s not my fault.” Peter cried out, covering his small face with his hands.
“I’m here to see you,” Steve said, shocked that Peggy even asked something like. “I have to return the other stones, but when I’m finished I’m coming back. For you I’ll only be gone a few seconds. But then we can be together Peggy,” Steve said leaning forward and putting a hand on Peggy’s shoulder.
“Peter…do you know what day it is today?” Steve asked, trying to stay calm.  The teen narrowed his eyes and looked around the kitchen, trying to find something that would proclaim the date. A clock, a calendar, anything would do. Because to be honest, Peter had no clue what day it was. A Tuesday maybe?
And then Steve saw it. There in the mix of everyone else, was Tony. His suit jacket was off and his tie was lazily undone, resting around his neck as the man moved around the room. A light sheen of sweat shimmered as Tony moved under a light, and Steve could see that Tony’s shirt was slightly damp as well. But the thing that really drove the Captain crazy was the movement of Tony’s hips.
“Two days,” Tony muttered as he scrubbed his face with a free hand. “Okay. Two days. Got it. Thanks again for your help Dr. Lucas. Just keep me in the loop, okay?” Tony said as he began to turn back towards the beds in the room.
and there wasn’t going to be any cookies for Santa. There was no Christmas Spirit. There was no Christmas.
“I uh...”Peter muttered, a sudden wave of emotion flooding over him. How could Pops seem so angry almost an hour ago and now be so calm? “I went to the store but I didn’t have my card on me,” Peter admitted with a shrug as he pushed past Steve, and towards his bedroom where his coat resided.
about Tony Stark and his personality. He was a cocky jackass half the time, but from the moments Steve would overhear Nat or Pepper talk about, Tony was equally this very shy, caring and protective man who loved very deeply.
for mercy, because Tony knew that Steve couldn't allow himself to look so insensitive when his loved ones were on Death's doorstep.
Steve placed a kiss on Tony's nose, "And I wouldn't have it any other way. Come on, let's go get that coffee and a bite to eat."
She gently reached out to scoop Tony to her side and kissed his head. She reached out to the side of the bed to get the face cloth from her nightstand. After cleaning Tony's face of tears, she hugged him tightly until his weeping quieted down.
She discovered a man who was traumatized multiple times in his life and had undergone something unknown to man's creation. Something so excruciating, it was almost as painful as reliving her days in the Red Room.
, in every known galaxy, in this known universe and beyond! I love you more than infinity, and back again!"
When he was finished, Steve maneuvered Tony so he lay in the captain’s lap, his head resting against Steve’s chest. Steve draped the blanket around them, drawing all the warmth close. He fed Tony small bites of his favourite flavour doughnuts from Randy’s, relishing in the content hums he’d hear from the genius when he enjoyed the bite.
Stephen looked up, slightly startled, "Oh! Miss Romanoff, you nearly made me spill my coffee with that stealth technique. But, please, sit." He gestured to the seat across from him.
"It is currently 02:15 AM on Saturday, 07th November 2013, the temperature being moderately cool with a forecast for rain showers after 09:00 AM today. You are currently in your bedroom at the Avengers Tower, Young Sir."
And Pepper — his dear lovely Pepper — who manages his company better than he did, making sure that every single employee is taken care of. Pepper will also not come for him, it’s protocol that SI will never pay ransom money for him.
‘I can help you, you know,’ Steve continues. ‘But not unless you tell me what’s got you worried.’ And he sounds so damn sincere that Tony wants to cave in and say fuck to whatever is left of his moral.
Another wicked smile as he scratches one of his eyebrow with his pinky. ‘Thanks, but no thanks.’ He pulls out a short knife from his back. His adept fingers plays with it, tosses the blade from one hand to the other. ‘We’ve figured something out.’
Barnes isn’t even looking at the man he’s being introduced to. No, his blue grey eyes are wide with shock as they dig into Tony’s face. His whole body is rigid with tension that wasn’t there like six seconds ago.
I suck at chapter summary, so I'll just gotta tell you in advance that I have introduced a new character from a different universe. The competition really. So, are y'all ready for Player 3? Well, you don't have much of a choice actually. LOL! But I'm crossing my fingers that you'll like them. And off you go and hope you enjoy!
So, he needs to start working on the places he can fix. On the people he can help. People he believes have potential to makes the world safe.
He’s been busy. Not evasive. And if Pepper found him that one time in his office doing soduko at 1am when he should be home she got him some coffee and closed the door, bless her. Because he couldn’t imagine haunting his workshop as usual, it was team movie night and both Steve and Natasha have override codes.
But let’s be real, Captain America doesn’t have that much issues. Maybe only being alive in the twenty-first century when everyone he knows is dead. Except for Peggy Carter. Tony doesn’t want to think about the little time she has. It aches.
his own subconscious repeats over and over again. He hates it because his own subconscious sounds like his father’s voice.
And they both turn to Barnes, who looks annoyed at being ignored and talked about like he’s not in the same room as the two scientist.
whoever they is — needs him alive. So, they’re not going to kill him. That doesn’t mean that this bad guy won’t make him suffer though. Sadistic bastard!
The next video comes sixteen hours after the last one, Steve and Bucky were the one standing vigil for any news. The team had developed a schedule to have someone — usually a pair — wait up for important updates. Not that any of them get any sleep longer than two hours when they are not on duty. Ever since Tony was gone, sleep has been a scarce commodity in the tower.
The video only last five minutes, but it feels longer. It plays on a loop, with them cursing every second of it. But they have to study it, in case it clues them to where Tony’s being hold up.
Steve had to fix him back together after his melt down, and he feels bad for stealing Steve’s own rights to mourn for his missing teammate — and probably, the man Steve loves that he doesn’t know yet. It’s embarrassing to need Steve like that because it had always been the other way around, with him taking care of Stevie. But times can change.
Bucky has long accepted that Tony had feelings for Steve, just as Steve has feelings for Tony. But witnessing it so bluntly is something else. He waits for the pain or jealousy to come. Surely, it’s inevitable for him to feel any of the two or both, given that his soulmate uttered someone else’s name when all hope is lost in Tony’s eyes and Steve’s name sounded like a saving grace.
Cold is the first thing that registers into his mind as he slowly gains consciousness. The pain follows like an inevitable addition to the discomfort. Why is JARVIS not doing anything about the temperature? He should be at least warm even when he’s in pain.
Not everyone can stomach him as a person, so it shouldn’t be surprising that Barnes had wanted out before whatever they had could have progressed. Hell, Tony’s sure most of his friends are ticking time bombs and would one by one leave him in the future.
What will Natasha tell him if she knows that he’s Captain America’s soulmate? Maybe request him not to get between Steve and Barnes. That’s what people would say because that’s the right thing.
He invited the two super soldiers to his workshop, where he feels safer. The suits will be around him in case he needed a quick escape when it all gets too much for his poor heart. JARVIS will keep an eye out of him, and so will his bots.
‘They’re probably dead.’ She’s not meeting Tony’s eyes as she looks ahead on the TV. There’s enough nonchalance in her voice that sounded fake.
The groan escapes his lips as the pain spreads into his body. And here he’s thinking that he’s numb to feel any pain with how much every nerve ending is burning from his injury from the explosion.
So, Tony keeps his mouth shut and only utters Steve’s name in the safety of his workshop when he’s alone. And sometimes when the nightmares come to haunt him, he mutters Steve’s name like a prayer as if to taunt his demons that he has a knight to save him. Even when he knows he doesn’t. Still, he pretends that he does.
Back on his first reason. Has these idiots forgotten that Steve is bonded to James, and would probably sacrifice anyone — much less Tony Stark — to keep his soulmate safe? Seriously, bad guys should study the laws of soul bonding too because they are just clueless as to how far people would go for those they love.
‘Please.’ Tony snorts. ‘You’re not as innocent as you’d like to seem, Cap. That could have worked with me before. But not now. I know that deep down those angelic baby blues, you’re a little shit.’
The spy is gone but Tony continues to stare at the elevator door and contemplates on what Natasha had just told him. It’s quite perplexing to believe that his pain is valid, that it doesn’t make him a bad person to not forgive Barnes. But then again, he had already decided to.
A man with an ambition to make the world safe for the future generation. Cliche as it may sound. But it’s the truth.
‘Steve’s been looking for you since the day before yesterday ,’ she tells him blankly. But knowing her, Tony’s sure she’s trying to watch him for reactions.
‘JARVIS, I hope you’re tracking the source of this video.’ There’s a hardness in Steve’s voice that he’s never heard before. Steve is usually gentle when speaking to people, especially towards JARVIS or the bots.
So many people in the universe. Eight billion alone on Earth and yet none of them could have been Tony’s soulmate. Nope. It had to be Steve Rogers, who is already bonded to his dead best friend, James ‘Bucky’ Barnes.
Some of the worry on the blond’s face sheds a bit. ‘Well, in that case I can help you with some PowerPoint if you want.’
‘Okay.’ Tony silently makes a mental note. He casually pats the metal table on the other side of him. ‘Sit here, soldier boy.’
It’s a blessing in disguise when he and Steve tend to collide with their personalities. Polar opposites really. And just a living proof that there had been some mistakes when matching Tony’s soulmate. But that doesn’t mean that there’s not a second the genius aches to hold Steve’s hand or be stared at by those baby blues with warmth that thirteen year old Tony had dreamt of.
‘It’s not that easy, Buck.’ Steve runs a hand over his tired face. ‘We’ll find him.’ The blond reaches out a hand to comfort, but Bucky moves away from it. Hurt and confusion mixes in Steve’s face.
So, Captain America has to shoulder Bucky’s hidden anxiety, and he has to worry for his friend. Hence, Steve looking worse for wear.
‘Are you okay?’ Steve asks him one day when they’re in Tony’s workshop. The super soldier is sketching while Tony’s stupidly marvelling how gorgeous Steve is.
him. No one. So, he should probably stop staring at the door like someone’s going to come busting in and rescue him.
Oh, and he’s tied up to a metal chair. Great! Why didn’t he notice that before? Right, because his brain was having a hard time processing everything with how painful it is to even blink.
And if Tony’s heart isn’t beating so loudly in his chest, he would have asked if Captain America just subtly flirted back at him. But that can’t be right, can it? Are they already in that level? Like sure, Tony flirts like he breaths but that’s him. Steve on the other hand though... he’s old school.
Maybe he helps Barnes for Steve, but at the same time he helps the POW because he refuses to be a monster. He refuses to carry around a hate that his mother would never want for him.
‘That is so rude of me,’ he jokes. ‘Brucie-bear meet the Winter Soldier a.k.a., Captain America’s best friend and soulmate, a.k.a. Sergeant James Buchanan Barnes.’ He gestures to the super soldier sitting on the metal table. ‘Barnes,’ he begins as he turns to the said man who appears to be quite tense now, ‘meet the incredible, brilliant , Dr. Bruce Banner. He has like seven Ph.Ds. it's frankly amazing.’
When did Steve become so comfortable around Tony to flirt back? As if Tony’s not amazingly fucked before, now he really is.
‘Stevie?’ He reaches for his soulmate in concern. A hand on the blond’s shoulder for support. Did the videos finally break Steve as well?
So, who is Tony to deny Steve of anything? The super soldier’s happiness is important to Tony. Achingly so.
‘It’s past midnight, Antoshka.’ She raises an eyebrow at him like a mother silently reprimanding her child. ‘You have an early board meeting tomorrow.’
Barnes stares at the chair like a deer in headlights. The picture of fear is clear in his blue grey eyes.
And Bucky mutely asks for some miracle, staring at Tony’s motionless body on the screen. It doesn’t fit Tony to be this still when he’s always full of energy and life.
‘Where does it hurt?’ he asks and pulls up his hologram set up to do a full body scan of the man in front of him. Hoping that having something to do with his hands will keep him from getting excited and grabby with the shiny metal arm in his proximity. He has a feeling Barnes doesn’t want it to be touched without consent. His time in Afghanistan had told him that much about having an unwanted
‘It’s not his fault, Tony,’ Steve reasons out. Tony knows Steve will always take Barnes’ side no matter what. ‘HYDRA made him do it.’ There’s guilt and hatred in his voice that’s simply heartbreaking to hear. ‘Please help him.’
Steve whips his head back to the screen in a flash that Bucky’s amaze he didn’t break his neck in the process. Steve’s sudden alertness to Tony’s call is an embodiment of a siren calling to a sailor; like a sunflower following the sun in the sky.
‘It’s about Bucky’s arm.’ And Natasha really does knows how to pique Tony’s interest because it’s obvious he had been lusting over the metal arm. It’s the engineer in him, really. ‘Steve wants to ask if you can take a look at it because it seems like it’s causing Bucky pain.’
The evil man smiles, showing off chunky yellowish teeth. ‘It’s amazing how you still have humour after all that injury.’ He moves closer, right in front of Tony’s chair. ‘Guess that’s a good thing.’
Tony expects the pain, the ones that always comes when they see him as he sees himself: a monster. Hate will follow fear in the process. And he’s not ready to see those emotions on Barnes’ eyes pointed at him. He couldn't stand to disappoint another one of his heroes.
‘It’s okay,’ she says solemnly. ‘You don’t have to forgive him if you don’t want to.’ She stares into him, eyes colouring with genuine sincerity, just a dab of softness to the sides of her mouth. How he’d come to be so close to her to be able to read these things, he wouldn’t remember. Maybe it was all the time they’d been forced to work together, rub shoulders while sharing traumatic experiences.
‘JARVIS, what’s the scan say?’ He turns to the screen where several files are opening up thanks to JARVIS. At the same time he tries very hard not to ogle the man before him.
It also helps their case that Tony had been sent files about the torture that Barnes had undergone in the hands of HYDRA. It’s a miracle the ex-assassin managed to survive after those constant tormenting: the memory wiping, the unwanted operation, the inhumane training, and other more disgusting activity HYDRA planned.
Tony doesn’t ask how she knows. He only wraps himself into her tighter and wishes that she didn’t have to suffer under the Red Room. But he can’t change their pasts. He can only wish for a better path for here on out.
And under three minutes the doors of the shop open, and in stroll the super soldiers. He turns his swivel chair to have a look at the both of them. Maybe he can desensitise himself by looking at them, just so it won’t hurt anymore. Maybe.
Bruce squeezes his shoulder softly. ‘I’m really happy for you, Tony. It’s going to help a lot of people.’
Steve Rogers and Bucky Barnes are national heroes. They are legendary icon and honourable soldiers. They are beckon of hope. Light in times of darkness.
It’s not yet a panic attack, but Tony fears it will become one. He wants to reach out to Barnes and tell the man to breathe in and out, only he doesn’t. How could he? The incredulity slowly morphs into terror behind Barnes’ eyes. The same grey blue ones that are turned to Tony.
It’s not rocket science to formulate a decision on whether or not Tony should tell Steve or not. Besides Steve and Bucky are considered the one Greatest Love Stories of All Time.
Tony looks weak and fragile and broken. And it’s heart-wrenching to see that he deflates the ball he’s been playing with the bots. There’s far no greater pain than watching his soulmate slowly ebb to death.
Tony only cuddles further into her warm embrace. ‘But then you’ll be stuck with me.’ He throws his head back a bit to look up to her. ‘What about your soulmate?’
‘Tony.’ There’s a small relieved smile on the blond’s lips. He’s taking the lead while Barnes’ two steps behind. The sound of his own name on the Captain’s lips make his insides ache but Tony tries to pretend it’s hunger pangs from his recent eighteen hour shift he pulled with the new suit designs.
‘Can’t that alien god help locate him?’ Bucky demands, watching the newest set of video for too many times that he knows isn’t healthy. His therapist would disapprove. ‘What use is his magic?’
Bucky wanted to say yes… to both. He doesn’t give a fuck what happens to him or to that blasted sceptre. All he wants is for Tony to be safe, to come home. But of course, that decision isn’t up to him, and he knows that if they all follow his thinking it’d be a disaster, because honestly, he’s not even logical.
While Tony Stark is a narcissistic playboy who doesn’t know where parties end and priorities begin. And also, the Merchant of Death, can’t forget that bit.
Except Tony doesn’t have much to say. Only, ‘Really?’ And he even sounds believable as if he didn’t spend the entire week — since Steve’s return — avoiding the Wonder Twins. As if it’s all coincidence that he had lots of things to do in SI, the R&D needed him for some testing, and he had to fly to Wakanda for three days to meet with the genius princess, Shuri, to help with Barnes’ deprogramming.
‘Yes.’ He stands up from his chair and pops his back into place. ‘I’ve had JARVIS scan it. It’s quite revolutionary. But at the same time it needs great improvements because it’s sloppy work, very inefficient.’
Every quiet groan and tormented scream rams into Bucky’s soul like ton of brick. Mutely, he promises terrible pain to those who’ve caused Tony’s painful screeches. Morality be damned. There is blood and suffering to be paid in full.
Everything is in chaos: Tony Stark is missing. And Bucky’s not ready to face the worst case scenario that it completely breaks him; that’s how Steve finds him when the rest of the Avengers returned back home after being unsuccessful in locating Tony in Europe. They have all decided to recoup and plan.
Barnes goes down to Tony’s shop all by himself now, refusing to have Steve around to metaphorically hold his hand. The other super soldier believes it’s better for his healing, to get slow independence on his own.
There is instant relief in the ex-assassin’s feature. Although it is mild, because he still looks like he is ready to flee at the drop of a hat.
He can’t. Not even when everything about this reminds him of Afghanistan. The cold, the rusty smell of decaying metal, the foul scent of an unkempt room. Somewhere he can hear a faint water droplet that makes his stomach churn at the thought of dirty water and lack of oxygen.
‘Not really.’ Tony shakes his head and has the greatest urge to tell this idiot of the truth. How, firstly, there is no way in seven hells Captain America will ever let James near these assholes. Neither will Tony, over his dead body. And secondly, there’s no room for argument that his life can be use as a bargaining chip in exchange for the life of those who will be affected if HYDRA gets their hands on the sceptre. Because duh… he’s not worth it.
And also, thank you to you if you're still here. Thank you for staying, and I hope you're loving it so far. I may also have introduced an additional character. Please welcome them with open arms, they are lovely. LOL! The chapter title is from
It’s a good thing that Bucky’s a super soldier because Steve is heavy with how he’s relying all of his weight on Bucky’s arm. He’s never seen his soulmate so startled and terrified.
And before he can roll his eyes on Steve, Barnes grins widely at him like the brainwashed assassin can’t believe how lucky he's got to be to have discovered Tony’s brand of humour. It’s very special and rare, and it offends lots of people most of the time.
‘Tony, it’s time for bed,’ Natasha informs as she walks into the workshop. She’s been very strict with his sleeping and eating schedule all thanks to Peppers request to Natasha to keep an eye on him. And when did the two scary redhead team up? Become friends?
When SHIELD fell along with a huge part of HYDRA — because they have to face it, there’s no assurance that they have completely annihilated the secret organisation — and Steve discovered that his soulmate is alive, Tony is torn between being happy for Steve and accepting the loss of someone he never had in the first place. Now that Bucky’s back in the picture, it’s just clear that he wasn’t meant for Steve because the two soldiers managed to find each other despite everything that they went through.
There’s a new addition to his collection of pain with that blow. There’s a fresh batch of headache that follows the other one that had just ebbed from the explosion. Ah, just his luck.
‘Well,’ the man sits comfortably like he’s simply lounging around with Tony, ‘if it’s all the same to you,’ the punch completely catches Tony off guard, so did the pain, ‘I’d rather not get us both acquainted.’
And just like he had done before, Tony draws strength to the one thing that grounds him and gives him peace of mind when everything falls apart.
The times when he can’t breath thinking of how alone he is again. Alone like back in Afghanistan, in that cold cave with faint lighting and too many dark corners. He can’t say Steve’s name because it feels wrong. Steve isn’t his to love and to hold. The supersoldier belongs to Bucky.
Yes, there was an explosion when they were trying to infiltrate a lab that the officials said to be of HYDRA. The officials wanted it to seem like they’re doing government check-ups on private organisation. But it seems like there was a mole on Bruce’s alliance team.
‘Oh god,’ Steve mumbles quietly with disbelief and fright as he looks everywhere but Bucky’s own worried face.
Hello, lovelies! How are y'all? HAPPY NEW YEAR! OMG! It's 2019! And yes, I am late, as stated. All I can say is that I'm sorry. I wasn't really in a good place, and I kinda drifted off into a different place just to get everything off my mind. Thus, I am going to give a S/O to the manhwa that kept me company while on sabbatical:
And gosh, lucky him, he’s got burns littered all over his arms and legs. A few lacerations too on places he can’t specify, because every inch of him hurts that it’s hard to figure out which part of him is not aching. Just
Well, they can’t blame him, he’s not very sane to begin with. Your soulmate being threatened and in the face of danger doesn’t make the most rational human being either. So, he waits, instead of voicing out his idiotic ideas.
‘Well, that’s the plan.’ He shrugs, feeling embarrassed by the praise coming from another brilliant mind. Maybe an even better genius than he ever will be. ‘And I was hoping it’ll help Winter Wonderland here as well.’
‘It won’t be necessary as long as you tell your friends to give us back the sceptre,’ the man whispers into Tony’s ear, hand gripping on the knife handle and twisting it slightly, earning him another muffled groan from the engineer. ‘And they could send back the
‘Tony,’ Steve says, tasting the name on his lips and oblivious to the fact that he’s turning the engineer’s world upside down.
It wasn’t his best moment as well, he gets clingy and panicky when he’s not in the same room as Steve, or when he doesn’t see the man. And the weight of Tony’s loss still brands his chest like an empty crater. It’s the sort of ache that won’t go away. It’s the sort of ache that squeezes your heart time and time again just to remind you that it’s there.
‘Hey, Bruciebear,’ Tony flashes his friend a smile and closes the metal panels in Barnes’ arm. ‘Dinner time?’
This one is unbeta-ed because I wrote it sooo late, I couldn't find the heart to burden someone with my unchecked grammar. So, if there are any spelling mistakes or grammar error, please look at it with kindness and tell me in a soft voice, yeah? Thanks.
He hopes that those days don’t come. But it sure will. He knows it, because Howard had reminded him way too many times that he’s destined to be alone and unloved. It comes along with his legacy as one of the problematic Stark.
Helping the two soul bonded doesn’t mean he fully forgive Barnes. No, that will take time. Lots of time because it’s about his mother. Maria Carbonell Stark whom Tony loves dearly. The woman who understood that Tony needed to be human before he could don the mask of a Stark man even when Howard was such a horrible husband.
He needs to escape. He’s not going to be leverage for these assholes. They’re not going to be able to use him, no matter the amount of colourful addition on his face, not to mention the twin knives that’s sunk on both his thighs.
Bucky knows by experience what it feels like to have Tony say your name for the first time and be envelop by a phantom sense of safety and happiness. It’s like finding meaning to life all over again, and being lulled in euphoria. But he can’t imagine what it’s like for Steve when there’s also that dreadful emotion of fear for the life of a soulmate which had sat painfully on Bucky’s chest for days now. A few days that felt like years.
His tormentor has promised a much better means next time he sees him; something wet he said, that had Tony’s breath hitching with fear at the vague indication. He’s still have nightmares about dirty water and gasping for air. And that might just be the last straw that breaks the camels back.
‘And he also turns into a sublime green being that can get you and Cap a run for your money on being The Strongest Avenger.’ He tries very hard to ignore the sudden changes in Barnes, knowing it won’t do good if he hovers over him now like a mother hen. That’s Steve’s job. Not that he’s not concerned with Barnes’ well-being, too. It’s only that he understands that sometimes your nightmares haunt you with no warning or whatsoever.
Living with Steve is like having a taste of the what an amazing life he could be living with a soulmate. He’s not sure if it could be more awesome than what he’s getting now — all the genuine concern, the warm smile, the feeling of belongingness — or if he will ever get to experience it.
There’s this bald Russian guy that tortures Tony to beg the Avengers to rescue him in exchange for the sceptre and Bucky. The methods are simple: a few punches and a few stabbing. Nothing worse than Bucky had gone under HYDRA’s hands. But then, Bucky’s a super soldier, who heals easily; Tony on the other hand is a non-powered human, looking all bruised and battered with his injuries from the explosion and now the current tormenting.
‘Is that a challenge?’ he retorts, raising his eyebrows at Barnes. A wicked smile playing on his lips.
Maybe Rhodey will come for him. But his platypus is busy fighting more important battles that’ll save myriad of people who deserves to live. Not like Tony.
‘I see that you’re awake, Mr. Stark.’ A man appears from the only opening in the room. His English is accented with Russian that completely matches his hard military feature. He fits the perfect role of a HYDRA agent.
He needs to keep calm and think of solutions, because if he looks closely into his current predicament it’ll only spiral him into thoughts that’ll push him into a panic attack. He can’t have that right now.
Tony knows he shouldn’t, that he can say ‘no’ and ‘fuck you’, and he won’t be the bad guy because Steve just opened an old wound that had never truly healed - it just scabbed over his heart and disfigured his insides. He’s mourning for his mother once again. He’s allowed to be angry.
Being pessimistic probably doesn’t help anyone. And really, he’s only hurting himself by thinking of the worst. Yes, the worst could happen. But not now, not when he’s got Steve to tell him that it won’t. He’ll believe Steve, he always will. Steve could believe for the both of them.
But they’re not friends. They’re acquaintances, doctor-patient, housemates. Nothing more. And it shouldn’t be more. He should be afraid if he starts to crave for more.
The pain or jealousy didn’t arrive. Yes, there is pain, but it’s the same one he’s been nursing since Tony had gone missing and was tortured.
‘Language,’ the blond chastises mechanically. And then there’s ashort pause before he says with a mischievous smirk, peeking at Tony under his long lashes, ‘Angelic baby blues, huh?’
Twenty-four hours later, they received a message from the low class HYDRA franchise in Sokovia that had held Tony hostage. They are trying to hold the genius ransom for Loki’s magical sceptre (which Thor and Loki had successfully retrieved). And for him, the Winter Soldier.
But it’s Steve. Tony loves Steve, and he knows his mother would want him to heal and forgive. And there’s also that grieving look in Bucky’s eyes that Tony finds familiar.
And if Tony’s heart isn’t breaking he’d say that they both make such a beautiful picture and pair. Instead he ignores them both and ignores his pain as he mutely orders the soldier to the medical chair. He keeps it for when he’s injured in battles and refuses to go to the medical bay. Bruce reprimands him for it and keeps saying how he’s not that kind doctor, but nonetheless he still fixes Tony’s injuries.
‘There appears to be an overlapping framework, sir,’ JARVIS replies as Tony’s screen fills with the arm’s 3D structure.
‘Oh please… They’ll bargain for you,’ the man spits, putting on his sadistic mask again. ‘You’re their precious teammate. An important person in society.’ He produces another knife. ‘Surely, they’ll come for you and exchange you for the Winter Soldier.’
Steve comes back to the tower with Barnes in tow. And stupidly, that’s not the knife that metaphorically kills Tony. No, it’s Captain America’s grave news about learning of his parents’ murderer: James Barnes AKA The Winter Soldier.
This is long already and I am holding you back from your last chapter. So, once more, thank you for being here through the journey. And I hope you enjoy this last piece of the story.
‘I’ve thought of that.’ He puts his hands on his hips. ‘Helen said she’ll try to drop in two weeks from now, since she’s busy with the Regeneration Cradle at the moment.’
He lost count of the time Mike — that’s what he calls his instigator, the man didn’t appreciate it (rude much) and lands a rather heavy blow on Tony’s left lung — had come into the room to wreck him into submission. Tony is very close to his breaking point. He can feel his sanity slipping away with each punch that lands his face and body, with each twist of the knife, and the amount of pooling blood beneath him.
It was Leez's idea actually for the plot to go like this: with Bucky learning that he's Tony's soulmate before Tony learning that he's Bucky's soulmate, too. Because she's brilliant. So, it's all thanks to her.
It’s mild but the Black Widow’s eyes flinch with pain. Just for a second. Tony could have missed it but he knows Natasha by now. They’re best friends after that green pistachio ice cream incident in which they have slowly learned to trust each other and now here they are, cuddling to make Clint gag.
. No, he’s only being held hostage on an ugly looking chair. Fucking fantastic indeed. And of course, very classic: kidnappers and chairs. When will villains get creative? Tony can think of other ways to hold people hostage. Not that he’s ever going to share them with the bad guys.
They both walk on eggshell. And it’s not like Tony wants to close the gap between them, because he doesn’t want to. Well, logically he shouldn’t because he needs to move on. But at the same time he painfully craves to have Steve back in his life like before.
He scans his memory for clues again because his heart rate is starting to quicken, and the arc reactor in his chest suddenly feels too heavy, that it’s making it difficult for his lungs to distribute the correct amount of oxygen in his body. And he’s not looking forward to the worst case scenario when he’s still in a middle of another worst case scenario.
for beta reading this at the last minute. Thanks a massive, dear. :) And of course, all remaining mistakes are still mine.
‘Now that I think about it… I never got your name,’ he says. ‘So, what is your name? Or does HYDRA do the whole Hunchman One, Hunchman Two, etcetera thing?’
He turns to Barnes again, gently lifting the wrist to see the movement and the arm made clinky noises as it moved. The movement seemed natural and that was more than enough to peak his interest. ‘I’m going to open your arm panels and see what’s wrong, okay?’
Tony shakes his head to control his rogue thoughts. He’s not going down that rabbit hole. It’s not going to help him get out.
‘It doesn’t always,’ Tony agrees just to humour this villain. ‘Word of advice? Accept it and move on.’
But god is it clear to Bucky what’s happening. It’s written all over Steve’s face with how his eyes looks like he’s seeing Tony for the first time.
Those who do defy the odds are small and brave and strong. Tony is none of those, so despite his old age — Rhodey says that thirty-six is the new twenty-three, or something — he tried not to settle down with anybody else except his soulmate. Only now, even his soul bond is a condemnation from the universe.
Yes, he’s one, but there are times when he feels like he can’t do it anymore. Then he thinks back of the hell he went through and at the same time the hell he have brought, of all the amending he has to make for his mistakes. The latter alone keeps him moving forward, just like Natasha and Barnes, because he’s alive for a reason. And he won’t waste this second chance he got to turn his bloody legacy into something close to a shining beacon of hope for the future.
‘Cap,’ he greets back not bothering to stand up. He then eyes the ex-assassin. ‘And you must be the infamous Winter Soldier.’ He refuses to call him Bucky. They’re not friends. They don’t have to be and that’s fantastic.
‘No.’ He side-eyes her and reasons out that he’s not sleepy yet, but a yawn escapes his mouth. Great, even his own body betrays him.
It takes him another day to finally face the music. He hasn’t seen Barnes ever since Steve had brought his soulmate to the tower. Not that Tony’s excited on meeting his competition. Also, there was no competition.
To say that it hurts Tony would be an understatement. Rejection has never been gentle with him, and to think after all these years he should be used to it by now. The years doesn’t numb the pain so that one can get use to it.
Bruce nods. ‘Tasha’s finishing with the cooking so she asked me to come and get you,’ he explains, studying Barnes’ arm thoughtfully. ‘And this thing is connected to his brain?’
The former POW looks at his soulmate as if he’s trying to find some strength from Steve’s silent assurance. Tony tries not to notice the amount of trust between the soulmates. Tries to ignore the knife digging deep in his chest at witnessing the very thing he can never have.
Sometimes he wonders if this is why he’s close friends with Natasha — that could almost compete with his two decades friendship with Rhodey —  is because she understands what it’s like to be broken. It might be the whole birds with the same feather adage. Or maybe it’s because he’s wise enough to make friends with broken people because they know how to survive.
‘The Regeneration Cradle?’ Bruce’s eyes grow wide with amazement. ‘You’ve finished it?’ He puts a supportive hand on Tony’s shoulder, a grin creeping on his face. ‘Congratulations!’
The man looks like an ex-convict no matter which direction you approach him from, Tony finds it a shame, he grew up watching the old reels of the Howling Commandos. He had always looked up to both Barnes and Cap. Mostly to the former because Steve’s shoes are impossible to fill. Even at the young age of five, Tony knows that truth.
Princess Shuri’s device must be working, and so is the therapy because Barnes looks better than when Tony had first seen him. And it’s been only a month.
Steve looks just as weary as Bucky is. They all do, but he thinks him and Steve has it worse. His other soulmate is being maimed, and somehow he thinks Steve can feel the negative and dark energy within him. It might has something to do with how they are soul bond.
He tries to look at the positive side: he’s not going to be bothered very long by Barnes’ rejection because they’re not friends. It’s a good thing they’re not. Even when Tony wanted to be at some point despite telling himself that he doesn’t.
Tony’s not sure why he’s trying to convince his tormentor that he’s team cares so little for him. He blames it on the lack of common sense and sanity when all he can register is the pain. The last time it hurt like this it’s because he was betrayed. And he was betrayed because he deserved it — he deserves to be alone since he’s never going to be good enough.
Tony jumps off at the chance for a change of topic. He doesn’t like being the centre of attention. No matter what the media says. Well, he actually does like being the star of the show, but only if he has control on what’s about to happen. Praise makes him uncomfortable, maybe it's because the concept had been unfamiliar for so long.
‘We’ll it’s hard to stay asleep when your place lacks warmth and cosiness,’ he replies and tries to ignore the uncomfortable dryness in his throat. ‘Also,’ he gestures to his handcuffs, ‘we need to work on consents and safewords for this kind of thing, don’t you think?’
Shit! His head is pounding so bad it makes him nauseous just opening his eyes and looking around for clues as to where the fuck he is.
Can’t always get what you want.. This is it for Tony. He should start to accept that. He should. Even if it’s hard.
