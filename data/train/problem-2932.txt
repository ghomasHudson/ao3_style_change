Cas’ arms wrap around him so tightly he’s stunned into stillness. With his head burrowed into Dean's neck, Cas releases shaky breaths. Without pausing to think if it's the right move, Dean winds his arms around Cas’ form, the answering hitch in Cas’ breathing tells him he chose correctly.
It's a couple days of ‘translating’ before Sam has something that might actually work to set things right in the cosmic goo that is the empty.
“I keep thinking, y’know, back to that night you walked into that barn in Illinois, you told me that good things do happen, and I mean it’s not like I expected you to, but you didn’t believe me when I told you that nothing good happens to me. I don’t know if in the time from then to no—I don’t know if you ever figured out that I was right or not but I think that the one good thing that happened to me was the worst thing to happen to me too.” Dean stares at his name, willing it to actually be him. The cold bites at his fingers and his nose. His toes grow cold in his boots but he doesn’t move to leave; he barely even feels it anyways.
“Y’know you do make it really hard for someone to try to be friends with you. Just say yes that way we can finally get to the work in the shed, you’ve got to learn how to maintain every piece in there so it's not going to be a short day. And I don’t feel like using up every second of it because of your stubbornness.” He looks entirely bored with his accusations and he wants to be angry but never has someone had that response to his outbursts.
He takes Anael aside and tells her that she has a light to her that deserves to shine. That no matter what her value doesn't lie in how good of a wife she can be. That married or not, he’ll still support her. Tells her that if she wants to learn that she should. Ma had a chance to before she got married and that opportunity shouldn't be closed off to her.
“No, it's just the jelly is seeping into the gauze more than I thought it would, and at this point it looks no different from the fluid the burns could be making. But I looked at it not half an hour ago so I know it’s fine, we’ll just have to keep an eye on it so that if it does start with the pus, we don’t miss it.”
The thought of letting Cas in like that, of having bared himself so completely for another person to witness, scares him, he’s not foolish enough for that idea to come without wariness attached. What scares him even more, is the inkling of desire that comes with the thought. He wants to be open finally, he wants to be free of what he holds so deeply inside of him, the aspects of him that darken the soul so much that at times, he worried wasn’t even there.
This fits post canon, several years post canon actually but it has a call back to chapter six. This ficlet is entirely headcanon but the ask link validates it pretty well
“Cas—I have nothing to offer you. There's no life to live if you're with me, you deserve a good life, with a family and a job that makes your ma proud of you. I’m no one Cas, I—”
Now he sits in the shade of the same tree he and Cas sat under during their first lesson, calmly taking in the sounds of the birds, the way the leaves dance in the breeze, and the shapes he can make with the elongated shadow of his fingers as the sun heads to rest against the horizon again.
He knows it’s to free his other arm so that Cas can help him from his prone position but his mind, ever the traitor it is, can’t help but flash to them in a similar position but for a vastly different reason, Cas above him, asking for permission to lay his hands on Dean’s body, the pain not coming from an injury but from a steady push into his body.
His day moves along at a snail's pace. All he wants is for it to be after supper so he can spend time with Dean. From morning to lunch Castiel does little other than help his father with the books, it’s excruciatingly dull, Castiel swears upon anything that it’s worse than it ever was before, knowing that he could be outside helping Dean, teaching Dean, or even just being away from his father.
“Alright then, let's teach you how to shoot.” Dean steers them into the line of trees that they’d been riding in the shade of and navigates far enough in that the noise from the shots will be dampened.
“He’s not a threat, he can’t even fight back,” the man laughs wickedly. “Ahh I’m not living to regret a thing boy, run along now before I decide to relieve you of the rest of your things as well.”
Sam and Gabriel are resoundingly steady in the 'simp for' category as per the tag, and of course, I had to give them a loving and large found family because I love the trope.
When he wakes again Cas is running a hand through his hair, brushing it off his forehead and spiking it up with a fond expression. He blinks several times to try to dislodge the fuzziness of sleep but eventually, he keeps his eyes closed, content to stay in sleep’s clutches.
“I’m sorry, he told me not to tell either of you, he didn't want you to worry. He always said he was far from happy, I didn’t-I didn’t want to make anything worse. It was already my fault.”
He manages to get out to see Dean again. The man is looking a bit worse for wear in the early morning light.
During the first days, he thought his eyes must have been brown, possibly so dark brown they looked black, beautiful in their boundless depth and he knew they would be easy to fall into, like the curtain of nightfall and its inky hold on the heavy eyelids as waking hours turn into silence and peace. In the clouded light of the day, his eyes were shadowed, darkened by his brow. He knew that whatever they looked like there must be a deepness to the colour, but he hadn’t been able to get close enough to see it.
“I know I asked you all to come home quite some time ago but gave no reason as to why I felt it necessary to have my grown children home again.” Castiel can’t tell if that's a barb at him. “As you all should be aware, our home and the land it sits upon used to belong to my father and his father before him and so on. I was given the land when he deemed himself too old to work it feasibly. While I am not yet at that age, I felt it necessary to announce that Michael will be inheriting the farm at which time I choose. I have spoken to him about it in length, he understands that the farm will not become his until Anna and Samandriel have had the same chance as all of you to grow up here.”
A stone settles into Dean’s chest as his mind painfully provides that he will never be the one to give Cas that life.
Hearing Dean talk about leaving gave him that final push. Castiel is done living his life as though he’s waiting for it to start without him. He’s done waiting around for the day his parents will understand and accept that he doesn't want what they want.
His stomach twists again as he thinks about leaving Cas, and then immediately his heart beats faster at the panic that follows when he realizes just how much he wants to stay by Cas’ side.
“Morning, sunshine,” he says in a gravelly rasp. The term of endearment makes his heart flip in his chest and Cas’ sleep rough voice makes a shudder run down the length of his spine.
He’s always wished that his family's past didn't cause distress for his younger siblings and yet, Hannah would have been up and moving about the second they got a whiff that she was feeling better but their ma wouldn’t chance it, not after having the wound go septic under her eye, not after Gadreel.
A traitorous part of his mind wishes Cas had brought the flask with him again, and not because of the cooking being subpar, he’s used to meals like that. He wants to know if their first night was a mistake in Cas’ mind, he wants to know where they stand.
“Don’t you trust me,” he says in mock affront, knowing full well that Cas couldn’t possibly trust him much at all.
. He excuses himself once he can and through a constricted throat and misty eyes, he makes his way into his house.
There was a coldness in his childhood, one that only recently had he started to learn of, his parents shunned him for being the surviving child, so much so that he grew unsure of whether being alive was the winning position. Would it not have been better for everyone, for him to have died with his brother instead of living to remind them all of what they had lost? But then he thinks that had he died alongside Gadreel; the lives of his family would no more certainly be better than they would be worse.
He sneaks his arm around Cas’ middle. It feels so rewarding to be able to do so without worry. Sometime in the days after they left the farm, they came to an understanding about what all this was exactly and with it came the allowance of these tender moments they’d both denied wanting. Of course he’d disallowed himself to have this after Cas got shot, couldn't fathom why Cas would want it and he had to punish himself in some way for his failure but now things seem to be better.
In hindsight, he shouldn't have let himself get distracted like he did. Especially not around a horse that doesn't exactly like him, or anyone for that matter. Dean’s cursing himself as the scene unfolds in front of him, years,
After a brief introduction to some of the workers Dean will be working side by side with, they head back to the main house. During dinner they seem to have a consistent stream of people to meet, hopping from one table to the next.
He’s thrown from his thoughts when a small, but oddly forceful, arm—make that two arms—land around his neck.
“Maybe so,” he concedes slowly. “Come to bed,” Cas whispers against his lips, the gentle tickle making him shudder.
It’s selfish, cowardly. It’s inhumane not to give them the same chance that he has to store the memories, the last moments they have with their older brother. Not allowing them to look at him once more, possibly for the last time in their lives, not allowing them closure. And wasn’t that the one thing he’d always wanted when they lost Gadreel? Closure? One last ‘I love you’, one last hug, one last everything. He robs them of it, he hurts them as he was hurt. After more than a decade trying to keep them from hurting like that, he’ll be the one to cause it. But he’ll never leave if they understand, he’ll never be able to make himself walk away while their tears play over and over again in his mind. And so, he says nothing.
The moment snapped in two when Remy started huffing in her stable, Cas backed up quickly, looking resolutely at the floor as he picked up the saddle and hung it himself. The ease of the abrupt movement and the strength Cas held in his solid frame had Dean’s mind betraying him once again.
I would like to say that after a royal fuck up at the pharmacy I've been off my meds for five days and as such my cognitive abilities have been tanked (just like the general opinion of the show post-finale - woo!) which is why my notes are hella weird and my tags are shite
A young man stands right at the base of the stairs, his hands fidget at his sides but he watches Ringer with awe apparent on his face.
Cas opens his mouth and closes it again; he looks at Cas and notices the bleeding light falling along the shell of his ear as he scratches behind it. When he speaks again his voice is sun warm, but he might be imagining it.
“Right then, Castiel please come keep him steady.” Dean’s body heats up when Cas lays his hand on his bare arm and back, he knows Cas can feel the scars along the sinews of muscle, knows he can see the way they swallow up the freckles that litter his skin, the only thing that does so more than the scars. “Now this is going to hurt, I’m going to count to three and realign the joint, try to stay as loose as possible or it will only hurt more.”
“I don’t know much ‘bout that Sir, my mama and father both died when I was young, I wasn’t quite eight when my father was killed and my mama died the day Sam was born; a candle got knocked clean over and set the house up in flames. I was just over four when she passed on.” He doesn’t wait to hear the reaction from the man. He knows what kind of stuff comes out of a man's mouth when they’ve never known pain. It's always pity, and he hates being pitied. “I’ve been on my own with Sam since then, a kindly lady opened her shed to us on the harsh nights when we were first on our own but that’s about all the free help we got.”
They both are quiet as she unwraps the fabric for his sling, it's quick enough work, folding his arm in against his chest again and wrapping around and under and over in a crossing pattern across his chest and under his arm until he feels quite like he imagines a child wrapped in blankets would feel.
“Still, she shouldn't have asked, she’s old enough to know better, though she did seem to enjoy your response. You’re quite charming.”
He dreams as he does most nights. Dreams of blood and tears; screams echoing through his head joined by flashes of scenes he’d hoped he would have forgotten by now. The threats thrown at him root fear deep in his chest.
“We knew from the start that this life was one of loss, Sammy had a bit of a harder time keeping the want for that cookie-cutter life out of his mind.”
“We can talk to someone in town, we have a name, we can report it,” Cas says, his voice getting higher and louder as he pleads.
The last thing he remembered was Chuck leaning over him, Jack far off in the background staggering to his feet, blood pouring from his head. And through his mind he replayed the fight realizing he hadn't even had time to fully reason with it, hadn't had any time to process it, not any of it, and now he was going to die as well.
A low whine crawls its way out of his throat as he thinks about how Cas’ fingers would feel opening him, holding his hip and thigh bruising finger marks into the flesh as one, two, three fingers stretch him torturously slowly.
Cas opens the door and he stumbles in after him. The last dregs of sunlight stream in through the room’s windows, painting the walls in gentle yellows and pinks. If he had the mind for it, he would admire its beauty. He doesn’t though and the swaths go unnoticed as his thoughts begin to race.
Hours pass as they talk of this and that, stories of Dean’s time on the road, quips about the unsteady ground and Dean’s driving ability. He tries to keep the stories flowing to stop Cas from delving into the consequences of his actions. It’s not that Dean is afraid that Cas will suddenly want to go back, to return to the life he knows and loves. Although, if he did Dean would let him, it would break something inside him that he never knew he had to break, and it would raise the walls Cas spent weeks breaking down, but Dean would let Cas go.
He wonders how long he’ll get to spend in the presence of this incredible man, to watch as he grows in whatever capacity while he lives and works on the farm, the answer he knows in his heart turns his stomach, Winchester already said he’d be moving on, the season won’t last forever and he’ll be off to whatever life he had planned before he stumbled across their land.
A second later he’s glad the clip is empty as the gun falls to the ground, his fingers releasing it in favour of threading his fingers into Cas’ hair as the other man licks his way into Dean’s mouth.
He doesn't know why it still hurts to be reminded of that, he’s known since his childhood that he wasn’t the type of person that would end up with a respectable individual, much less considering the fact that Cas was a man, a man who still had not shown one way or the other where his ‘special interests’ may lie.
There are no words for what he feels as he watches them. No way to describe the vice grip on his lungs and the smile painted across his face living at the same time as they currently do. No way to piece it together in his own head because this is it. These are the last moments, these are the last memories of them. He’s going to savour it; he’s going to remember it.
He takes notice of a song that starts to play only because it is in such contrast to the music the machine has been playing for the better part of the afternoon. There’s a heaviness to the melody, an intensity that the other songs lacked, he spends much of the song listening only to the instruments.
One of the most powerful celestial forces in the universe. And they have no way of getting any. Michael has ignored their pleas for weeks, no way is he going to come now that they want to remove some of his grace from him.
Ringer doesn’t like the sound of the shot if his protests are anything to go by, but he’s not trying to run off or losing all his composure so Dean counts that a win.
“If my shoulder begins to bother me again I vow to tell you, does that appease you Cas? Until that time, understand that I am fine and your concern, while appreciated, is not necessary.”
“I understand that I have no seniority here but if you are worried about the safety of your family there is no way I’d allow for anything to happen to them if I could stop it. I am reasonably well versed in dealing with that sort of thing and I'm not one to shy away from an altercation if it means that I'm protecting someone."
On one sweep of Cas’ hand across his bare torso, his thumb catches on his nipple and he lets out a small moan. Cas does it again and Dean bucks his hips, his cock pulsing in its confines.
He sees the man taking in the house, a slightly awed expression takes residence on his face and turns it from hardened and rough to something softer and hopeful in a way. Before he can see him looking Castiel removes himself from the sill and makes quick work of finishing getting ready for dinner.
“When I was a boy, before my mama died, I have this memory of her standing over me, sayin’ that I could be anything, I figure you could do with hearing that same sentiment,” he says as he finishes mucking. He leans himself against the stood up fork and wipes a hand across his forehead.
Dean holds Cas’ gaze until the look in his eyes becomes too much. The heat he felt but couldn't name when Cas’ hand touched his back is there again, settling between them, heavy as the midday sun, and just as distracting.
these words, has spoken them a thousand times and yet he still can’t make the connection. He supposes that this particular feeling is why young children seemingly spontaneously lose their composure so often.
He nods, catching Cas’ eye before they both turn and walk towards the barn, the work is mostly separate, Cas at one end tending to the pigs him at the other cleaning stalls. The day’s cloudy, a slight rarity in the area but the heat of the day is as strong as the last week; sweat clings to his back and hairline causing his mind to focus on the feeling while he’s unable to do anything about it.
“Never again,” he murmured against Cas’ lips, “I know how awful I've been to you and I will spend as long as you'll let me to try to make you know how sorry I am for that, but never again will you leave my side, not by my words or actions, I love you Cas and I swear to G- well no I swear to anyone but him that that will never change. Not even in death.” Dean leaned back in for another kiss, and when Castiel took control he sighed into his mouth lost in the feeling of him, neither man noticed that Dean’s double had come back, standing in the doorway, a smile that was equal parts happy and morose played out on his lips.
He knows Cas will give in; it doesn't matter that they both know that really for Dean this isn't a cause for celebration.
, desperately. He pitches forwards, the force of it so strong that he ends up plastered against Castiel’s torso, on the first pass of Cas’ fingers against his prostate.
“Hello Dean,” the man says, and with two simple words leaves him stunned. Cas is the only one he’s ever heard use his name before. He assumed Cas hadn’t shared it with his family, and yet here he was being addressed by it as though it was the most normal occurrence in the world. Once the shock passes and he’s able to think better, he realizes that the man beside him must be Gabriel, but Dean’s never been introduced to Cas’ family, and he in no way wants to assume or offend.
When Dean lifts the pen after the final letter, equal parts of Castiel breathe a short sigh of relief and crumble at the fact that now it’s done, there is nothing he can say—not that he was going to—that can keep Dean here, keep Dean with him.
He’s gotten dangerously close to something; he can see it in his father's face. The way his eyes skirt around the room more than they had, right before they stop altogether and his face hardens. He’s never had much experience with dealing with that face, as a child he tried his best to stay out of trouble, not wishing to open himself up to the repercussions of ‘further wrongdoing’, and if something had gone wrong, Gabriel made sure that he was the one that had the stare trained on him instead.
He debates his next words carefully, this man doesn’t seem to know about the power of information, he’s clean of the scum that is a life like his. He seems like he wants to know about him, wants the story about the newcomer. He’s kept in it so long he isn't sure he can even voice anything but he wants to in a perverse way.
He’s keeping busy as best he can, walking Ringer around the paddock and stroking his hand through his mane. He speaks lowly to the animal, clicks his tongue every so often to hold his attention. It doesn't escape his notice when Charles and the buyer begin their walk over to him, he tries best he can not to seem on edge. Not only would they possibly pick up on it but Ringer most certainly would and Dean knows that making a horse jumpy is a sure-fire way to ruin a deal.
“Winchester, Si—Cas, that can be how you write me into the books,” he says half-smiling in the low light, Sam’s laugh echoing in his head as he thinks back to the sun on his neck the buzzing in his ears and the hot metal of a rifle in his hands.
He checks and cleans Ringer’s shoes and brushes his coat and mane. He also cleans himself up best he can, gets the dirt from under his nails, the mud from his calves, gives Cas his non-blood stained clothes for washing, and takes extra care in his shaving though he’s rarely let his scruff grow out while on the farm. Finally, he spends some time cleaning and straightening the stables and barns. The last thing he wants is for a lack of effort on his part to tank the sale.
As he’s making his way through ‘tch’, listing the words they worked through that used the combination, Cas returns. He has the slates tucked into a small bag along with what looks to be a few small books, they never made it to reading anything yesterday. Looks like Cas wants to change that today.
He pretended it wasn’t his father, made himself think of it as anything else because suddenly it was all on him. They didn't have records, names, he wasn’t sure if they’d have a place to live for long, so he was on his own, just him and his brother.
He moves closer to the window, taking care to keep out of sight, all he can see is Cas' side partially turned from him. It takes only a few words to learn who Cas is talking to as Dean hears Charles' voice rise above his son’s.
“They may if I was to leave after a courtship began, but if I am only leaving for school I can’t imagine they’d give me one,” Cas responds as Dean climbs out of the cab bed again after finishing with the cleaning and oiling of the hinges on the doors and the handles.
“We can do that, but I’d like to know more about your approach to training, how you went about gaining his trust and starting him on the drills to teach him all that he knows now.”
Castiel sits in his home, letting it sink into his bones, the smells and sights, the noises and the emotions that are almost tangible, able to be grabbed and understood through touch. He feels it all settle into him, every moment of his life, he lets it simmer, all the feelings that threaten to overwhelm him. Every part fits itself around his heart and it’s almost as though, as they piece together, something about the space shifts.
They practice more, Castiel speaking about how letter sounds go together, running through the digraphs, again and again, showing him how words like ‘shirt’ and ‘wheel’ work before moving to a few trigraphs. He struggles more with those because so often the same three letters will make vastly different sounds and so they decide to be finished for the day.
“My trust in you has nothing to do with your training abilities, but I would still like to see if for myself; he's all yours,” Cas responds, stepping back from Ibby and letting him walk up to the horse, eyes tracking his movement across the paddock.
He can't remember the last time he was hugged, though it was most likely when Sam left Dean to go off and make something of himself. Even still, he’s never been embraced this fiercely. Cas’ fingers ball against his shirt and he squeezes his arms in response, it's like they are using each other in order to tether them to this earth. In that moment all that matters is the two of them, grasping so tightly at what brings them comfort, and Dean never wants to let go.
. And it seemed really really upset that I’d done that. I feel bad for making it loud, I was never supposed to explode in there anyways and I just thought that maybe if we could make it quiet again it would maybe be more willing to give us Cas back.”
“Do I even want to ask why Ringer was able to throw you around like this, I thought my pa had told you to stay away from him.”
His breathing turns shallow as Cas thumbs the hammer, his face heats when Cas tilts his head and his farm roughed hand squeezes back on the trigger. It lights him up in ways that send his thoughts into a spiral of want to see hands that are capable of being so gentle and kind wrapped around the unforgiving metal of a gun. Paired together it does things to Dean he doesn’t want to dissect.
“I don’t blame my parents, I may carry something of the kind for my siblings, but I learned not long after his death that I was a constant reminder that he wasn’t there anymore, that each time my parents looked at me they saw him. Gabriel did his best with me, it was a long time ago now, but I’ll never forget just how far he went. Brothers and sisters are supposed to be your playmates, but Gabriel was hell-bent on doing more than that. He moved into my room and read me the stories that I hadn’t yet been able to. By the time my parents made their way out of their grief, I was doing much better on my own. I still needed their support though, sometimes I got it and other times it was lacking, but Gabriel never wavered.” Cas stops and takes a shuddering breath in and releases it in a steady stream as though he’s letting something go. “And in case you aren’t following, you are the Gabriel in Sam’s story, Dean, but you played an even grander role because you had to play parent to him as well. Without you or your steadfast protection, Sam wouldn’t at all be the person he is now. You said he’s a good kid, that’s because you raised him yourself,” Cas says, staring so intensely into his eyes that Dean wants to look away so as not to crumble beneath the weight of it. But Castiel doesn’t let him.
As he looks longer at the frame, it begins to remind him instead of the thin scratches in the door frame of the schoolroom in the house; small initials written next to lines with ages etched into the wood. Some start at one—a first birthday tradition in their family—others start later, forever remembering the first day a new sibling came home.
“This isn't about Chuck, I’m sorry if you thought it was but it—it’s about Cas,” he says, his voice breaking, as it always does, over the single syllable. “I never told you what happened the day but the empty took him, I never shared why it came for him.”
“Touch me, please Dean,” he begs, not at all caring for how desperate he sounds, not if it gets him some relief. He cries out when Dean palms him through his pants and his eyes slam shut when Dean leans in to breathe him in, just as he had done earlier. The hot wet breath seeping through the layers makes him weak at the knees. A coy smile plays at Dean’s lips when he opens his eyes again.
He figures the day will be reasonably uneventful, Charles didn’t return the previous night so work on a large scale is paused until he is able—until Hannah is able—to come home, or perhaps until she isn’t.
Dean has no clue what to expect from tomorrow. If Cas is truly leaving for town is he supposed to carry on as normal and work through the chores anyways, or should he focus on Ibby instead? And who’s to bring him dinner if Charles and Cas are both unable to.
They stop outside of a saloon that also functions as an inn. Large letters spell out 'The Roadhouse' above the door and as they ride up to the front Dean waves over a young man with long brown hair—though oddly enough it’s short in the front—and climbs from the seat.
“Don't worry about it Cas, kids are easy to lie to about this kind of thing, makes it easy to actually tell them, in the end, all they want is a story.”
“My brother Sam is the same way, always has been, but he’ll never stop being Sammy to me, not even in his old age.” The ever present itch that forms when he talks of his brother returns, but Dean is chuffed to discover that it's nowhere near as overpowering as it had been.
It had taken them nearly a day for the lingering cowardice to disappear, both afraid that the other wanted to forget what they’d done. The same night, only hours after he had been pressed against the side of the stables, when Cas brought his supper and the flask, there had been an undeniable tension hung suffocatingly in the air.
Hauling the thing up to shoulder height with all the weight that it carried and with only one arm resulted in him losing his balance. As Dean tried to get a foot underneath him to catch himself, hoping to avoid ending up sprawled on the floor again, he tipped, the weight of the saddle causing him to fall faster than what was normal and it seemed to do more to carry him down to the ground than his own wobbling had.
Dean throws a look to Cas who has the decency to look at least a little chastised. He smiles in spite of himself, Cas looks quite endearing with that look on his face.
He bucks his hips violently, chasing the bolts of pleasure that strike him each time Cas presses against the spot.
“The farm’s not overly large either, far longer than it is wide, I would reckon that you came in from just about the worst possible spot considering where I saw you walk in from with my pa.” He’s a bit taken aback that Cas had watched as he walked in. But at the same time, he likes knowing that he managed to catch Cas’ interest so quickly. He enjoys that for a few seconds before he realizes that it wasn’t him personally that caught his attention, but because he was a newcomer that brought with him some excitement for the family.
In the man’s hands is a small basket, and his stomach riots at the sight of the food he notices inside.
“I’m glad you did,” he says in answer, too much and too little coming to his mind to form anything more eloquent than that.
His chest is a cave, a ravine that drags all of him inside it. It bleeds him until there's not so much left to fill a thimble and then it bleeds him some more. And he lets it, he sits by and happily dies in a way he’s never known a person could die.
“You want to do it Cas?” he questions cheekily. “Wanna split me open on your fingers? Mmm, are you gonna give me what I really want.” Dean doesn’t frame the last one as a question; it sounds far too much like he’s begging.
. As he had that night, Dean still doesn't know what Cas meant with that statement. And as that night, he still desperately wants to.
Hours later they stop to water Ringer and check the map Cas had thought to buy. They have hours to go still but there's no doubt they’ll make it to town with plenty of time to bathe.
Cas stumbles backwards, blood blooming a dangerous red against the fabric of his shirt, his face is drawn with pain, with shock. It takes only a split second of deafening terror for Dean to act. Ignoring the pain the wound on his arm is making as he moves (of course the bastards hit his shooting arm) he raises his gun and with absolutely no hesitation, he fires until the men fall, collapsing upon themselves as their blood mixes into the dirt.
Sam shoots him a pointed look before he moves off the topic, “So, Jess was talking the other day about maybe finding a place to go on a trip to, and I need your advice.”
They eat in the quiet hum of dusk. It’s been a long time since he’s been uncomfortable in silence, he used to be on alert for every noise, his skin would crawl with the expectations of politeness when he was around others, but he never feels that now, not alone and not with Cas at his side.
Cas lived hundreds of millions of years and yet there was so much he left unfinished, he’s been around for eons and yet he still died too soon.
The pack of them head around to the back of the house using the shade from the trees to stave off some of the heat of the day. He wants to go over to see Cas but knows better than to do so, the only sibling who knows about them is Gabriel and it’s not his call if Cas wants there to be an introduction.
As they pull up to the house, Jody walks through the front door. With a wide smile, she makes her way up to the gig just as Dean gathers the courage to step out, knowing that it could be less than a minute before he’s being turned away, Cas in tow.
The entrance wound is decently clean, a frayed edged circle that’s a bit more than half an inch in diameter, and the exit wound, while larger, is better than some he’s dealt with. Still, his stomach churns at the sight.
Charles turns to him and he's taken aback by the look of the man, where this morning his face had been cloaked in worry and stress it now screams of defeat and anguish. “Yes, thank you, and make sure she’s tacked tomorrow before I rise, I’ll be heading back into town and I'll need her set up with the cab.”
“Little brother, you always were kinder than the world deserved, always allowed yourself to be subservient to it… always allowed others to take precedence,” Gabriel says airily as though the conversation wasn't on such a heavy subject.
“That sounds like a marriage proposal.” Dean joked because he couldn't help it, facing god or not he still wasn’t best with addressing his feelings.
In the remaining time Cas spends in the barn their conversations stay safely in passing topics and he wishes he had a way of making him stay longer.
Jack sends him a little nod before walking back to his room, hopefully, his facade was built well enough and he’s not about to stare dejectedly at the ceiling for hours and hours.
He stops as a horse approaches in the distance. The rider shouts at him but is still too far off to make sense of the words. So he waits, placating, passive, and unassertive. As the rider nears he puts on his prettiest face; the face that he knows people like most. It gets him things—food mostly; or sometimes a bed for a night, it’s gotten him a job once or twice in the past too—and it’s enough to distract from the scars that litter his face. This mask of an expression hides the truth of him better than any words could.
He’s settling into the barn that night, when he realizes that he’s left his washing at the house. Cas hadn’t been the one to bring him supper that night—but Dean found that even without that time with Cas, he wasn’t worried about where they stood with each other, not like he had been in his first days—and because of that, no one had made it known to him that he had forgotten.
“I was forcefully summoned here by a small child upon your bidding m’lady,” he says, getting a giggle from both his sisters. It amazes him how easily they laugh at everything, their childhood joy so pure and whole. Duma’s laughter echoes gently as she leaves the door, content that her job is done.
But watching as Winchester makes his way through the words he has been able to make sense of throughout his life, watching as the crease in his brow smooths in recognition and the peek of tongue disappear temptingly back into his mouth when he makes his way around a letter he struggles with is better than anything that he ever experienced before.
His mother has been praising God for bringing her back well, and while he had trouble believing her recovery sometimes as well, he’s not yet gone as far as to say it was caused by divine intervention, but rather a doctor with at least minimal competency in the matter of infections.
“If that’s as long as it takes, or here, new plan, I’ll believe that when you stop growing, you’re inches taller than I am man it doesn't make sense.” Jo catches his eye, a question of food or the like clear on her face but he shakes his head.
He’s not sure where his father is, he thinks that he should probably be here for the contract signing, but he’s not about to leave to go get him. Castiel has been angry with his pa since he started this ordeal without letting him know.
Imagine his shock when neither man stepped up beside him. Before Dean even has a chance to stand up to speak to the man, he sits down beside Dean, legs stretched out in front of him, his feet tapping together gently in a steady beat.
He still marvels at the ease the two of them have together and how they interact with each other. The light jabs and underhanded compliments would be unheard of with so many other couples, but the two of them understand each other and Castiel couldn't have asked for a better woman to keep at his brother’s side for the rest of his life.
Something hideous rears its head in his chest, and staring at the letters, staring at the name. He always deserved more than Dean could give him, than this world could give him. He deserves more than a scar in some bark in a forest hardly anyone treks into. He deserves more than to die without knowing—to die thinking he wasn’t loved.
“Ya! I’m in here,” he shouts, silently thankful his breath had come back enough to make that more than a weak wheeze.
“Shit that kickback is stronger than I thought it would be. How come it didn't take you back like it did me?”
He can’t lie though, the house itself is lovely. It is painted a dark muted red and stands out against the backdrop of the blue sky. It gives off such a welcoming aura that he can actually imagine it becoming a sort of home for him.
He looks at Dean once he’s done and sees warring emotions cloud his face. Scrunching his brow, he looks at him longer, but past excitement and trepidation Castiel isn't able to place anything.
“I remember everything Cas, all of it, every fight, every drink, every goddamn time we looked at each other. And yet I can’t recall a fucking thing because I thought I had more time. After everything we’d gone through, I still thought we would have more time. It's all broken and jumbled and set to static and I can’t handle it because it's crystal clear and as muddy as anything because I thought I’d be able to make more, replace what got muddled. I thought you had more time.”
“Goodnight Dean,” Cas calls quietly as he backs his way to the closed barn door. They both huff a laugh—though Dean does so far more forcefully—when Cas’ back ends up against the wood. He shakes his head as he opens the door before stepping into the well of the door.
He turns and leaves, his parents sitting in silence in his wake. A sort of smugness settles into him, his parents can hardly argue with him when it was his father's surety of the farms ability to function without him that—in their mind—is causing him to leave now instead of later.
Dean can’t seem to think of anything to say. Jody—no, Jody and others—want to employ him? A job where he’ll get to work with horses all the time, where he’ll have the resources he’s never had before to do the best job he can. He doesn’t know where this place is but it might be far enough away that he doesn't have to ever worry about his past again. A place where he can send Sam letters with a proper address on them, where he can maybe make enough money that neither he nor Sam will struggle anymore.
At dinner that night they learn why it is that all but one of them are back home. His father clinks his glass to halt the ruckus of conversations amongst the twenty-two of them. Castiel looks at the children settled into a table for themselves, sending an apologetic glance to Anael for the fourth time since they all sat down.
Cas walks further into the barn and he realizes he’s coming to get his flask back, standing and brushing some of the dirt off his pants he walks up to Cas with it—and the basket—in hand and the fire lights low in his stomach when the man tracks his eyes down his body before raising them up again. Cas’ head tips to the side a bit on the parse of his frame and he can feel a subtle heat rush to his face.
The relieved smile Castiel gives him is bright enough to light up even the darkest corners of him, reaching all the way to the recesses of his mind. He can’t help but think that maybe it was worth living through all the worst if it led him here.
Besides, he has more than enough money to buy one for himself if he ends up needing to. It’s odd to think he now has money enough not to fret over a left behind razor or an extra person on the trip.
He feels like he needs to offer a piece of himself, so that he is flayed open for all to see along with Cas, to let him know he’s not alone in his exposure. But before he can, Cas begins again.
This poem does not fit into any specific chapter but does connect to the latter half of the original story
When the haze dissipates Dean is standing in front of him looking oddly bashful. Taking a chance, he leans in again and catches Dean’s soft lips in a tender kiss. A gentle whimper makes its way out of his parted lips as he pulls back, Dean doesn’t seem like he’s done as he leans back in, catching the back of Castiel’s neck with his hand to keep him close.
“Ah yes, I’m sure the post workers are tired of sorting mail for me as this was the fifth letter this week but this one is from Inias. Well really it’s from Anael and is sent by Gabriel, but Inias asked for the letter to be written.” The whole chain of ownership to get a letter from the farm out here makes his head hurt with its layers but it’s more than worth it to see that dopey smile on Cas’ face whenever one comes in. “It’s a drawing this time, which Anael says is apparently me, Dean, and Inias from that day on the farm where she came over and then we eventually went and spent some time with everyone. And if I'm not mistaken, that right there is Ringer.” Cas turns the pictures around and Dean can see the shapes of people and just behind them an odd blob with four legs and a tail that is clearly meant to be their old horse.
“Castiel, what is it,” his father responds, setting the glass of amber liquid onto the desk with a sigh.
Cas gives him a watery smile, “The impermanence of life is what gives beauty to it.” It sounds like he’s quoting something but he doesn't ask what.
Once Jody is ready, they head over to the stables. Castiel makes a mental note to make sure the gig is moved into the equipment shed before the day’s end.
He watches as Ash shoves his hair from his eyes, the fringe should have long grown out by now but he’d found that he quite enjoyed the short front of his hair, only now he gets it cut to the length he prefers instead of playing around with fire as he had the first time he ended up with the style.
He’s never really talked about it to anyone except for Dean and Gabriel, but he truly loves to learn, the process of gaining new information, of making connections and furthering his understanding of simple and complex concepts excites him. To learn is to grow, and by growing he is ensuring that future generations of children, his or others, have a more solid foundation upon which to start their own learning.
There’s still a part of him that wants to stop all of this, to take Dean and make him not go through with the deal, but Dean doesn’t deserve that. Dean deserves to be happy. And if this, over Castiel, will make him happy, will help him live the life he deserves, he should have it. No matter how much his entire being begs Dean to say no to it and stay.
“Fuck Dean, no one should look that sinful handling a gun so competently, so assuredly,” Cas bites out as he traces his tongue around the vein in Dean’s neck. The cooling track it leaves makes him shiver, as do Cas’ words. “So beautiful, flawless. I should have known, everything about you is incredible.”
“Cas, I understand you may have some questions but I need you to think about whether or not you actually want the answers to them,” Dean cautions. He’s all too aware how conversations like these go, and the last thing he wants is to scare Cas away.
The bat swoops again in front of the window and Castiel finds himself present in the moment again. The light is out in the barn and he wonders how much time had passed as he stood at the window reminiscing. Cursing lowly at his lapse, he turns and makes his way to stop in at Hannah’s room once more.
When he looks up again, after spending some time getting used to his name, the way it looks, the way it feels to write it out, Cas is looking at him, his face is lit up like what he thinks deliverance must look like and he begs to one day be worthy of such a look. He thinks that with his name, he may be able to reach it one day.
At night Cas still spends time with him, they still write and read, the first night they read the information Jody had left just in case Dean needed help with some of the words—though he was pleased to learn that he needed less help than he would have thought.
He’s too shocked to ask why the empty would choose him of all its occupants to boot out. Hell, he's too shocked to do much of anything as Lucifer goes about zapping a reaper into the bunker, killing her, and having her resurrected as the new Death.
“No need Ma’am, it was taken care of before we made it here.” Vague as the answer is, Jody takes it and Dean breathes a sigh of relief, he really doesn't want to have to lie, or god forbid tell the actual truth of the matter.
“So fucking perfect, so good. Riding me so flawlessly. God the way you feel, the way you are, Dean you are perfect, so perfect for me. If you could see yourself right now, if you could see even half of what I see
It’s over as fast as it began, Dean’s shirt sways from its quick drop and the trail of Cas’ fingers feels red hot and completely cold along his skin. He knows his face is flushed, he can feel it curl around his neck and disappear beneath his freshly donned shirt. The heat in his body doesn't stop there, it sprouts in his chest when he’s unable to remember a time when someone was that gentle with his broken body. And most unfortunately heat curls itself round in his groin. With a brief shift of his hips he realizes he’s nearly half hard in his trousers, glad for the fact that his shirt covers his crotch.
. No, Cas said he wasn’t a killer, he wasn’t a monster or a tool to be used and thrown aside, and yet he killed another hadn’t he? Killed him by doing nothing at all because that's what happens, that’s his legacy, people get close to him and they get killed. They always get killed.
“Do you have a name at all?” Of course this question would come, it always does but that doesn’t stop the curl of acid in his stomach, the one that speaks of shame in a way nothing else has.
During the first days he spent with Dean he used the word fine to describe himself so often, but when Castiel called him out on it he conceded. For some reason, he isn’t convinced that if he were to go about the same route that he would get the same response.
Snow begins to fall as he stands at the tree, the beehive long since gone dormant, its occupants still burrowing in for their months-long sleep. And God how Dean envies their ability to escape reality for longer than it takes to sleep off a hangover.
The thought churns something ugly in his chest, as though he’s only worth something to Cas when his past remains a mystery, just another puzzle to solve. He wants to get bitter and angry; he wants to confront Cas about it, but he’s mostly just tired, let down in a way he didn’t know he could be. He wishes Cas would leave, go back to his happy life and stop making him feel special, stop pretending that he’s worth something when it’s so clear to him that he’s not much more than nothing.
He doesn't want to get his hopes up too high, but any deviation makes him think that maybe, just maybe there's still a chance for Cas to come back—for everyone to come back. That’s what's driving him, that's what's keeping his head above water as the undertow tries to steal him away again and again.
With this goodbye pertaining to so many of them it's far worse than it was with his brother, with his age now and all the understanding that comes with it, there's an extra blade carving into his chest, he knows what this loss will do to them if they love him even half as much as he had loved Gadreel.
“It's not my fault you had so many siblings to converse with as a child, in all honesty, I’m not sure I've ever had a friend before. Sammy, I suppose, but aside from him? Wasn’t so lucky as to make friends easy, ya see, and I never had the time to spend doin’ so.”
A flash of annoyance lances its way through his heart, it shouldn't be his job to make sure his brothers and sisters are raised into well-rounded individuals. He shouldn't have to worry about whether or not their potential will be lost in the process of them growing up in this house.
It's at the man's words of thanks that he first understands just how much trouble he has found himself in.
Castiel had seen the way Gabriel had watched the kids earlier, had seen how saddened he was for missing their milestones and birthdays. It was the curse of the older child again, dealing with insufferable young ones and the nostalgia and sadness that comes with missing out on that same insufferableness as they grow up. Soon enough Castiel will be the one missing milestones, so he has been soaking everything up while he can.
He tests a theory after the possibility of Michael opening Death’s book turns out to be a bust because what else can he do really? Dean calls Sam and Jack into the bunker’s gym, if you could even call it that—at best it's a sparring room. Which is exactly what it's going to be used for now.
Why would Dean want to subject Cas to that fate when he could make it so Cas could live as he should? Where one day he’ll get to be old and content, sitting on a porch watching his legacy fold out in front of him in the form of happy children.
He hadn't wanted to kill them, not really, but they’d left him with no choice. Now he just hopes they can put enough distance between them and the two dead men on the road before someone finds them. Not wasting any more time he grabs their money from in between their bodies and returns to Cas.
“All part of god's plan as Ma says,” Cas says through a mirthless laugh. “I love her, but she doesn’t seem to care what I want. And my pa doesn’t care one way or the other what I do as long as it doesn’t cause him grief.”
Dean makes it within ten yards when Cas and his ma exit the house. In her arms is a decently sized chest which he hopes has some medical supplies.
He wants to be furious but he doesn't have it in him, this fight has been long and tortuous and he wants it to be over. He wants the win. Plus he can hear Cas telling him again that anger was never what he was made from. So he swallows the anger even though it feels like swallowing coals.
that is, than he’s done since he was a child. Messes of emotions war within him, getting stronger day after day. It's exhausting, he thinks, no wonder young children need so much sleep. Already, he feels as though if he were to rest his head on his pillow he would succumb to sleep within a few minutes. And yet he doesn't stop despite the exhaustion, he can’t stop, any attempt to ignore the emotions seems to strengthen them as though his mind was hell-bent on making him relive a reality that isn't his yet.
“That’s right, me and Sammy found one in the brushes off a ways from town one day, when he was a kid he always liked to imagine he’d be a counsellor one day, the time we found the gun, he wanted to, and I’m speaking right from his mouth, ‘take the law into his own hands’, I had to manhandle him away from it before he picked it up and shot it.” He doesn’t mention that he went back to get the gun that same night, doesn’t mention that he used it for a time. Instead he says, “It’s the name I used on his school forms too way back when… I’d almost forgotten I’d done that.”
Dean doesn't know what made him decide on the tree. They didn’t have a body to burn, not this time. They didn’t have a six-foot hole to dig and he felt odd putting a marker over unmarred earth. So when he stumbled upon a tree in the woods surrounding the bunker, one with a beehive tucked nine feet up he didn’t even realize he had popped out his pocket knife and started carving until the first three letters were written in the wet bark.
His worrying had been for nothing of course. The second they had seen each other it had been tight embraces and wide smiles. When Sam mentioned a woman named Jessica, Dean’s heart soared. When he told Dean of the work he’d been doing, there was nothing but pride in his chest.
Worry gnaws at him as his time on the farm grows, Charles wouldn’t for a second attempt to shelter him against anyone if his family was threatened even for a moment.
“Sorry about the late supper, we got some bad news from the doctor today and Ma had a hard time with it,” Cas says walking into the barn and handing the bowl over. Their fingers touch again but he ignores the pull he feels much better than he did the first time.
“He did take the name to heart, while my other older siblings went off to marry and establish themselves in new cities, Lucifer fought against the way my parents wanted us to live, instead of marrying, he took off. We aren’t sure if he’s even coming back in a few days like the others, there have been rumours, told to us through my brothers, that he fathered a child. But no one knows if it’s true as we have no idea who the woman is.”
He peers between them to find Cas’ length and strokes it as Cas shudders under him, curses falling softly from his lips.
Realizing that Cas should probably at least watch as Dean loads the cylinder he walks back with an amused smile on his face as he watches Cas shift and shuffle his feet repeatedly. It's endearing how much he wants to get this right.
Oh, Dean thinks, so Cas is going to follow a plan, be it school or marriage. He plans to make more of himself, and from what he’s told Dean, it’ll mean leaving. Who better to ask than the man who's left everything behind more than once in his life, who’s strongest tie is to an adult sibling (who Dean fears only wants to keep him in his life for the comfort of their shared childhood)? His chest constricts upon itself, if he’d let himself dream, the reason Cas wasn’t offering to go with him was because he just wasn’t ready to leave, that his connections to his home are too strong. Then again, if he’s asking about it, didn’t that prove he was ready to leave, and that he just didn’t care to leave with Dean?
Dean crouches as quietly as he can, something in his chest pulls at the actions of the unknown person, like he’s heard those same steps in a similar pattern before. He tries to think quickly about who he could be about to face, which man he crossed who had a step pattern like that but comes up blank.
“Hmm,” he says with a raised eyebrow and an ‘oh well’ expression. “It’d probably be best not to let my pa see it.” And just like that the conversation seems finished.
The steps get louder, then they stop, their owner hesitates, they quiet down as they walk away from the barn, but then their owner turns back and walks closer to the barn door.
He walks up to Remy while he waits for the son to come out with his meal. Her coat is nearly pristine, her mane untangled and her hooves clean and properly kept. She’d be able to win just about anything, and he would be willing to bet that she already has.
They take their time as they eat and he remembers his thoughts from earlier and figures now’s as good a time as any to see if he can get some clarity.
He can hardly keep them all straight. Charlie was sweet, he knows that, Meg seemed to eye up Cas with immense interest, the group of young women blended together but he’s reasonably certain one was named Krissy and another Kaia. A man named Aaron sat beside Garth—who according to Jody is the town's dentist for both humans and farm animals—who talks so extensively about his wife that Dean doesn't learn a thing about the man from his own mouth.
The torture had lasted far longer than Castiel though fair, and by the time Dean had finished, his skin glistened in the late day sun, shining golden as he worked some tension from his muscles, soft noises of satisfaction had escaped his lips on nearly every pass of his stretching. Castiel had been far more grateful for his loose-fitting shirt than he’d ever had cause to be before when they made their way back to the house. The long fabric hung a few inches below his pant hem, sparring them both from the mortifying and damaging evidence of his attraction to the man beside him.
“Not particularly, no,” he says in response before turning his focus to his ma. “Should I start on the burn Ma?” Cas isn't rewarded with a verbal response, his ma too absorbed in inspecting Dean’s leg to do anything more than nod.
It’s embarrassing how hot he gets when Cas offers to take him in, the bolt of desire travels down his body so fast he can’t stop the growl he lets out. He cock jerks at the thought of being deep inside his lover as the flush that may permanently stain his skin reaches further down his chest.
The pain blinds him for a second but another shot rings out and a cut off scream filters through the haze of his pain. He had thought for a moment that he had been the one that screamed. When he turns, he wishes it had been him.
The sun begins to set when he washes for dinner. As he dresses he hears the commotion from his younger siblings, curious he sticks his head into the space of his bedroom window and his breath catches against his will.
He knows that Michael will do a good job with the farm, and by the look on his brother's face, he’s thrilled to be the one to inherit the land.
They gather their belongings from the gig and together they walk into the house, Cas laughs when Dean motions him to walk through the open door first as he holds it open in a grandiose manner. The house is a single storey, down a hall to their left must be the bedrooms and in front of them stretches the main parlour. Through a framed doorway Dean can see the kitchen. It’s cozy, quaint even, and the warmth of it makes it all the better.
“Hey hey! Dean, wait stop! You’re bleeding,” Cas says jogging up to him. He looks back and is surprised to see a decently sized pool of blood on the stable ground.
As Cas makes his way back over to Dean, he raises his good arm, “Afternoon Ma’am, I'm terribly sorry to have to pull you away from what you were doing, but I do appreciate the help a lot.” Cas raises an eyebrow at him, silently commenting on his change in demeanour and stands close by as he makes his way up the few steps of the porch. Cas grabs Dean’s elbow as he climbs but drops it like it’s branded him when he knows Dean’s stable.
Castiel leans back, running his tongue ever so gently against his shaft, revelling in the twitches of Dean’s hips.
“I was simply asking after a bit of confusion, it just seemed more logical to me to forgo the process a second time.”
“Wait, you mean to tell me you didn’t orchestrate the entire venture just so you could see me?” Dean says in mock offence. He may be swimming in a river of conflict within himself but he’s a master at pretending that all is well.
“I may be in town tomorrow. If I am you’ll be alone to work on the farm, my pa doesn’t like the idea because you’re still learning but we don't have many options currently with Hannah still ill. I hope I won’t be in town for too long as the farm isn't supposed to be left unmanned as it were in case someone was to come looking for my pa. With him gone that duty falls to me and if I'm off the property for long and someone was to stop by neither of us is sure exactly what would happen.”
“I’m going to turn in for the night, I know that it’s likely you both still have questions for me but I think it would be best to continue this tomorrow perhaps, after we’ve all slept on the information.”
He’s ignored his own cock, too caught up in Cas, in making this moment last, but Cas’ knee shifts and their chests press completely against each other. With every movement his cock slides against their stomachs.
“All we have is work to do here Dean, you’ve been busy morning to night since you’ve been able to work again. I have no idea why my pa ever looked into this but there’s no shortage of stuff for you to do here.”
His eyelids slip closed again as Cas leans in to press a kiss to his parted lips. Without thinking, Dean wraps an arm around his shoulder pulling him closer, deepening the kiss. He chases Cas’ mouth when he breaks away but Cas holds him back.
His mouth is barely on Cas’ before Cas has them walking back towards the bed. Cas’ knees hit the edge and his sinks down onto the mattress. He scoots back as Dean kneels onto the bed over him, settling down into his lap. His arousal surges and his hands shake as they twine into the ends of Cas’ hair at the nape of his neck.
His false name sounds odd coming from Cas’ mouth, as though the word itself knows that it’s not right, that he has no claim to it, no right to call it his real name. It’s not his name, never has been, never will be his first name. He’s not ever going to have one of those.
” stop his breath cold on every listen. He doesn’t allow himself to look too deeply into that, he’s long since accepted himself and delving into beliefs of a time long since past does no one any good.
He’s leaning against the railing when Dean walks in, arms half crossed on his chest, one hand plays at the scruff that's grown in on his chin. He stands up when he sees Dean. He has a question he needs to ask, but Dean can see that he doesn't want to ask it.
“I have complete faith that you would step in to help and we aren't expecting anything to go wrong in our absence but it's always best to be prepared,” Cas says as they walk up to the bag with the slates, he pauses and looks at his hands. “Is that what the scars are from?”
That warmth turns sour now, Castiel knew that his father's vitriol would eventually cloud over his time with Dean. Just as he knows that his own words spoken against the man would darken each moment he was allowed to spend with him in the future.
I'm really interested in what you all thought about this chapter, it fought me quite a bit along the way (but it did end up somewhere I'm happy with) and while it is a fair bit shorter than the last couple have been (though it was still long) a lot did happened in it.
“My ma is going to be calling me in soon, how about we go and grab the slates and you keep one for the night, that way you can keep practicing if you want to.”
After the extra work is done, he makes sure to do his normal duties, not wanting to leave them to pile up as well. With Cas in the house, he’s not as distracted as he would normally be and he wants to monopolize on the moments of productivity. Though he still finds himself looking to the house occasionally to see if Cas is coming back or even just standing by a window, hoping to catch a glimpse of him.
“Ah, just as I was hoping, Castiel has been quite busy these days and I’m glad he’ll have a day to catch up on what’s fallen to the side.”
He turns the paper over again as Dean had and peers at the paper Dean is reading now. He sees his father's signature written down, no doubt from when Jody was here last. The remaining blank space at the bottom mocks him and heat crawls along in his veins, his heart starts to beat ever faster in his chest as reality starts to sink in around him.
Charles shows him the steps for the chickens, pigs, and the few cattle they have before walking him to the stables.
He lets himself get swept up in the tale of his latest hunting trip and again tentatively accepts an offer to go out with the lot of them next time if his schedule allows it. It’s not that he’s overly busy on Jody’s ranch, in fact if he wanted, his job could be pretty hands off, but he loves his job because it’s hands on, why would he give that up simply because it wasn't required of him.
“Cas, not for nothing but how exactly did you think I made sure I stayed as safe as I could my whole life?” he asks while putting his gun back into his pack.
Dean’s shocked silent for a minute, wondering how a person who grew up as Lucifer must have turned into someone who revolted against the entire establishment. He wonders if Lucifer ended up like him. Hell, Dean wonders if he had even met the man unknowingly.
He’s stunned silent, his skin blushing deeply and covering those freckles that Cas adores so much. He tries to look away, shy away from the attention but Cas doesn't let him. He cups his hands on either side of Dean’s face and manipulates his head as he pleases. Drawing it forward he lays soft, warm kisses to his forehead, down his temple, along the hill of his cheekbone, over the bridge of his nose. Tracing his way along Dean’s freckles, leaving him breathless and causing him to blush more under the intense attention Cas is giving him.
Day after day the confusion hits harder. Conflating the rituals of friendship—not that he knew those in any proper way—with the rituals of courting—again with what little he knows of them—all while they messed around under the cover of night. It all leaves him feeling lost.
It’s different that night, and the night after, everything feels softer, calmer. Like for once, Dean can bask in the glory of a peaceful night. One spent outdoors no less. He still sleeps with one hand under his pillow, fingers a twitch away from his gun, but his other hand is always against Cas. When Cas curls up behind him their hands rest entwined on his stomach. When he tucks himself into the open space at Cas’ side his hand rests over Cas’ heart. If Cas mirrors that position Dean rests his hand on his hip. Never before has he had such tenderness in any of his past relationships—if you could even call them that—never before had he craved it so much.
The youngest of the bunch run around playing tag and jacks, Cas lifts one of the young boys up to hang off a low tree branch with a wide smile on his face.
Dean gets the feeling he might not be just talking about sex; he swallows around the lump that’s grown in his throat. The prospect doesn't scare him as much as he thought it would, and what he sees in Cas’ eyes takes much of the rest of the fear away.
Each word that drips from Cas’ mouth onto his heated skin inches him closer and closer to the precipice. The rough scrape of his stubble on his neck matches the rough almost too dry strokes on their cocks. Spitting into his palm he reaches down and completes the circle Cas’ hand had begun.
“That doesn’t mean you couldn't have still gotten injured again.” Cas comes to stand beside him, he doesn't try to stop the mild shiver that makes its way down his spine with Cas so close.
He mirrors the action again, hoping to show Cas that he’s there, that he understands how hard it is to go through what he’s going through. Seeing no better or worse time he takes a breath, preparing for the likely possibility that Cas rethinks all of this and goes back to his family.
“Here please let me help?” he pauses and waits for the nod before allowing himself to crowd in closer to help. He ignores the feeling, the odd clenching in his chest, when he lays his hands on Winchester’s, fiddling with the chalk to get it to rest on the ring finger of his right hand—it offers more stability than using the middle—and pointedly ignores the way Winchester’s breathing has changed since he moved close.
Dean’s not sure if Cas means listening to him complain or if he’s subtly referencing the fact that Dean never had a mother to pester him. Thinking that hearing about his own mother could bring up old wounds after a while.
“Well I want to be a teacher, it’d be a good way to see if I’m able to teach an age other than children, plus you already speak with little issue so it shouldn't be too hard to teach you past the basics. With my siblings, I could never get to teach them past learning the alphabet and reading small books but if you wanted I could teach you all that and then take it further and use some of my old books,” Cas says with waning confidence.
And he knows that to some degree, while he will always blame himself for what happened to Cas, Cas will just as completely blame
Cas already knows that Dean would have stayed on the farm had he asked, he already knows that he’s the only person since Sam that Dean would give anything up for. He already knows that Dean is prepared to do anything to keep him safe, the fear that took residence in his heart regarding Cas getting hurt never fully left, will never fully leave either.
He doesn't bother unpacking, not having the possessions he would need to do so, choosing instead to sit and wait for his meal.
He looks down and sees a tin pressed between his arm and Cas’ palm. Cas shows it to him when he lets out a questioning hum. Nestled into his palm is a tin of jelly and Dean feels his cheeks heat again.
The three of them work and work and work. Researching anything they can, reading up on lore, on spells, on anything that may give them an edge.
The next day is spent on chores, teaching his siblings and himself and sneaking glimpses from the windows at his father and Winchester. His father had asked him to get a name for him but he couldn’t bring himself to share it—even if he had let him know why his father wanted it—as of now his name was one of the few things he knew about him and he wasn’t yet ready to offer that up for everyone else to claim as well.
His burns had cleared up leaving an addition to his scar collection in the form of faint pink lashings across the top of his right shoulder. Luckily for him, they’d never festered, Cas had redressed them daily, checking for issues and changes.
The young girl is sleeping as she always had, like a log, unbothered by light or noise and she’ll stay as such until the sun has climbed its way well into the sky. It means more than Castiel can put into words to see her so much like her old self, while she was ill her sleep was fitful, and really, it was the first thing that had alerted them to there being a problem.
He watches the small faces for a short time before taking in more of the house. He moves his gaze up to the second storey where he sees a flash of movement as a person leaves from the sill of a window.
He tells them all how important they are to him, how loved and needed they are. How no matter what, he’ll never stop loving them.
He looks down, bereft. He had hoped the man would start with a question he could answer; hoped he could make a good impression before the sour truth was shared.
It seems that everyone just knows to leave them be as they eat quietly beside one another. The chaos around them doesn’t bother him, the noises and sights and smells of a well lived space filter into the small bubble that surrounds their table and he revels in it, the sense of being part of something; it’s something he wasn't even consciously aware of missing, and yet being part of this bigger picture, having been welcomed by all of the people around him despite the story that his face tells, fills a gap that had gone empty for so long.
The door to his father's study is ajar as he passes it and for a moment he debates not going in, not forcing what he knows is going to be an unpleasant conversation, but the itching that resides behind his ribs reminds him that he’ll never be fully content if he doesn't get answers.
When he looks up at Cas he again wishes for better light in the barn, so that he could see his face better because there's a haunted look in his eyes, and in the set of his face that he thinks he knows all too well.
He’d been nervous to test his luck the first day they teased each other, knowing how easy it was for someone to take it the wrong way, but even then Castiel had been open to it, welcomed it almost.
,” slips through his lips as wave after wave of disorienting pleasure hits him. Cas pulls back and taps Dean’s side to get him to shift out of the way.
“Castiel, hold on one moment please,” his father says. “Is this why you were asking about the state of the farm earlier this week?”
He sees Cas steal a glance at him from the corner of his eye before he responds, “Yes, I suppose you do.” in a wistful voice.
Dean had mentioned him in his letter, how could he not. Sam would’ve certainly asked how the hell Dean managed to write a letter and it was just easier to come out with it before he had a chance to.
But how could that be? Every interaction seemed clouded with a fog of unsure understanding that day by day was becoming clearer. He thought Dean was reciprocating at least in part, but now he worries he may have imagined it.
“Hey,” Cas says with mock indignancy. “Who are you calling old, you’ve got to be around my same age, maybe even older than I am!”
“Afternoon gentlemen,” the man says. His eyes shine in a sickening way. A trick of the light makes them gleam yellow in the afternoon sun.
He wanted to kiss him, kiss the stupid experssion off his face. He wanted to spend every second wrapped up in him so that when his payment was due, he hadn't wasted a second of his time with Cas. So that when he was forced to live his life alone, after a few weeks had ruined years of telling himself that he was okay with being alone, he could remember Cas in every way possible, the way he smelled when he was using his grace, like he was standing on a mountain as the ozone seeped into the air around him, heavy but light in the most confusing dichotomy there ever was, how he sounded first thing in the morning, the scratch of his voice sounding like every dream he never left himself have. The way his smile scrunched up his face and sent it tipping backwards to the ceiling. How much he loves Jack and their odd little family, how he would do anything to keep their son safe no matter the cost... oh.
“I just mean, I’ve taught my brothers and sisters, and I don't mean to offend but, you would be at the same level as they were when I did so. It makes sense that if you had a want for it, I could help you learn how to read and write a bit, we still have all the supplies, books and the like so it wouldn’t cost a thing for anyone.”
It’s quiet for so long he thinks Cas must have fallen asleep and is well on his way to the same when Cas’ gruff voice rumbles against his back.
He and Sam share a look once Sam’s picked the book up off the floor of the library. Every single page is blank. They have no hope of reading it… but there's no use to crush everyone just yet. Besides they have some things to talk about first.
“You would really spend your free time helpin’ me learn. A drifter who hasn't a penny to a name I don’t even have.” They've been standing outside the machine shed for quite some time and he rolls his shoulders against the stiffness settling in his now unused muscles, wincing when the raw section twinges against the movement. “Oh I see, I’m the only person in fifty miles near your age that you can spend time with, doesn’t hurt that I’m a fresh face does it, I bet the novelty excites you don’t it?”
“Sorry Sir,” he stops and shakes his head as he breaks the only rule he made. “But I’m not sure if I can do that.” He tries to fight instinct but he can feel himself getting smaller under the gaze of a man with so much more than him, “I—well it's a bit of an odd name, I mean no disrespect of course, it's just that there's a good reason I named Sam, Sam y’see...” He leaves the sentence hanging hoping the man can fill in the end of it. He recounts every time in his life he has come across someone whose name he couldn’t use, most of the time he would make a name for them, but this man was essentially his boss and he knows better than to do that for him.
“No marks where they’ll see,” he manages to get out between the increasing waves of pleasure that hit his form.
It all seems to go in slow motion, his mind reaching the ending long before his body does. Ringer huffs again, but not like he had been before, Dean’s hand has rested itself along his shoulder and it's clear that he’s not happy about it.
His ma is talking but his mind is elsewhere, on Winchester’s face glowing in the yellow light of the lamp, the way his lips curved over his name for the first time and the tensions that cloaked the barn from the moment their eyes had met. He replies to his ma even though he hadn't heard what she said and opens the door for her. It clatters loudly behind him and he flinches praying that the noise hasn’t woken any of his family up.
He walks up and shakes Ellen’s hand and Cas follows suit. Dean sees Ellen’s eyes catch on his bound shoulder but she doesn't ask.
But Cas deserves far better than Dean can ever give him, he knows that as much as he knows anything. Cas would lose his family and his life here on the farm if he didn’t find himself a nice woman to settle down with, someone who he wouldn't have to hide. What can Dean give him? A life of hiding, one where he can’t have a relationship with his family, one where they can’t show their affection openly, no devotion before God, no promise of a happy ending.
Cas spends his life in the warmth of sheets and blankets and the love of family, and he wants to be angry, wants to be jealous of all that Cas has that he doesn’t but, then he remembers who he is, sees the trouble he’s been through and knows that Cas wouldn’t ever deserve a life where he knew what the floor felt like as it dipped below the weight of a patron walking past a little too close to the sleeping forms littering the floor, didn’t deserve to worry if his face was covered enough as to not assuage suspicion but to ensure someone wouldn’t deem his pretty face one that was theirs to try to claim. He certainly doesn’t deserve the bloody knuckles that result from such an experience.
“When Chuck told us that you were the one who never listened,” he chokes out a broken laugh, “it honestly made perfect sense, you did always say that it was our story, that we were the thing that was real in a world of manufactured realities. And when he said it I swear it was like I was standing in that ratty kitchen, minutes before Lucifer rose, minutes before you di—died for the first time, listening to you say that we were making it up. And I thought as Chuck went on and on how maybe I haven't been dreaming it up all these years, maybe it wasn't Chuck’s doing, and I was going to try to talk to you about it, after a shit ton of booze mind you.” He’s quiet for a long time, the snow begins to blanket the space around him and he thinks about how he’ll never get to brush snow off of the lapel of Cas’ stupid trench coat.
Just as he was about to ask what he was talking about, ask him to continue and put him out of his misery, Cas spoke again.
“It’s the silliest thing, but I was the only child born or brought home on a Thursday at the time of my birth, even Gadreel wasn't born on a Thursday, but a Friday instead, and so I’m named for the angel of Thursday. It is far more obscure than my siblings, which will always be a bit of an annoyance.”
He can tell that they both want to say more, but he’s not in any mood to hear it, especially considering he knows their general consensus on his choices.
“Sorry about earlier, she’s a hugger,” Jody says after she turns back and seems to realize they are both still standing beside her.
While he washes, he can hear the low din of the family through the door that separates the mudroom from the house proper. He’s not sure where Cas ended up but he doesn't hear the man's gravelly voice amongst the voices that make their way to him.
Anger, he’s learned, is a gateway to unrestrained thoughts, without meaning to, he let slip far more than he ever intended for Cas to know, he’s realizing that his unassuming nature and kind face might be his power in this world, a power he doesn’t even know he has.
“When was the last time you used it?” Cas asks as he crouches near Dean, eyes steadfastly trained on his bag as though he can see the gun through the material.
When he leaves, Dean still looks a bit dazed, and if he’s smug about that in ways he shouldn't be, no one has to know.
With one last look at Jack, he starts to pray, to whom he wasn’t sure. A prayer he hoped Jack could hear, a prayer that said
That same night he had walked to the barn with Dean’s dinner and the flask tucked into the pocket of his pants. He had told his parents that he would check on Dean’s healing, granting him more time before suspicion could form in their minds. They sat closer than Castiel could remember them sitting any time before, even during their lessons. And though they spent much of the night talking, Castiel was pleased to find that when silence did settle, it wasn’t heavy, rather it was soft and calm like he’d never experienced with someone other than Gabriel.
“Morning Castiel,” Jody calls as he exits the house, the heat of the day is already creeping into the baked earth and his shirt grows hot against the breadth of his shoulders, even the breeze it makes as it shifts is warm. Quite different from earlier that morning when he’d escaped to help Dean write his letter to Sam.
did it not you or Sam or Jack, this is one hundred percent on me. I don’t want to go, I don’t ever want to leave you, or them. Things aren't perfect yet, I know that, we still have incredible risks to go up against, and I don’t know who if any of us is going to make it out on the other side of this war. I’m holding onto that fear for a reason, I can’t be happy with it looming over my head, not happy enough for it to come for me at least.” Cas said and the gears in Dean's head started to turn, trying to find a way out of this for Cas, but everywhere he looked it seemed to mock him. He couldn't think of a thing they could do to get Cas out of his deal.
His pa excuses himself a moment without explanation and his ma jumps right into asking about Kali’s pregnancy, forgetting that Castiel is sitting right there. It’s not that he is opposed to hearing whatever Kali chooses to share, it's that, normally men wouldn’t be in the room to hear talk of a pregnancy that they had no part in, in fact even the father may be absent for such discussions.
“All that matters to her is keeping up appearances, it’s been a constant thought of hers since Gadreel. Once Lucifer took off, she heightened her ‘participation’ in our lives. It’s been exhausting, truly, I know it’s because she cares but it’s the same thing day after day,” Cas pauses and looks at Dean. “Sorry, I can’t imagine this must be much fun for you.”
He’d talked down about Dean, implied that his interest in the man was born from something other than pure
He lets out a short peel of laughter and lays a hand in Cas’ hair, threading the strands through his spread fingers and allows himself a moment to relish in the softness of this little bit of the world they carved for themselves in the midst of a couple hundred trees and a bored horse.
He can feel the rage circling within him. Dean is far more than anything anyone has said against him, far more a man than Castiel’s father appears to be in this moment. And yet he’s sworn into silence for his own safety, for Dean’s safety as well, because he knows not how his father would react to such truths and does not know if he would assume that the unknown boy is the cause of his son’s seemingly sudden change.
His mind is thrown back to the task at hand when quite suddenly one of the tie-ups on the gig slips from his hand. He just barely manages to catch it before it falls to the ground. Knowing his luck, it would have broken had he not caught it. Castiel releases a low grunt at the shock.
“It was you, shit Cas your fucking hands—drive me crazy,” he says as he slides his hands under Cas’ shirt to score his back. Marking him in the only way he can, if only he could get his mouth on the untouched expanse of his chest or hips, bite into the flesh and suck his claim onto the soft skin.
He knows it doesn't matter, either which way, Cas is as untouchable as they come. His feelings, whatever they are, mean nothing here. He needs to focus on the fact that he will be leaving this farm, soon. As protection for himself and this family. The longer he stays the longer he’s at risk, the longer he’s putting Cas—Cas’ family at risk.
He had tucked each new piece of information away in his head, against his own better judgement he replayed them, ignoring the part of him that told him not to get attached to the man, even slightly. But with all the learning he had done, the part of him he longed to see most was blocked off. Until now.
He lets his doubts go. What his father said last night was true, he had responsibilities he’d let slide and Anael had been picking them up, which certainly isn’t fair to her.
Cas raises the gun again and takes a few deep breaths, his finger plays along the barrel before it curls to rest against the trigger and Dean finds himself frozen watching it.
All the air seems to have been sucked out of the barn, the silence of the farm around him hums as his nerves pick up again and again with every beat of his heart. He’s one for lying, always has been, yet this one refuses to be born so he sees no way around it. He closes his eyes, takes a steadying breath and talks to the floor.
They trade kisses because Castiel can’t help himself. He’s been selfless enough today—the past few days—and now he wants to be greedy. He wants to take all that he can, so he does.
“It's an odd comfort to grow up with a job already, but at the same time it's like a prison sentence, I can’t do much else now, I have almost no choice in the rest of my life. As much as it’s comforting to have this farm, I wish I had a way to do more.” He doesn’t stop shovelling as Cas speaks. “I always wanted to be a teacher, figured I’d make a pretty good one to all things considered. I taught my younger siblings when my ma was too busy to and they never complained—” Cas stops for a moment and he looks at him but the man is turned away, though his shoulders are set in a hard line. “I don't mean to complain Winchester, honest, but I don't get much of a chance to talk about this.”
But Dean could swear there had been times when he would catch Cas staring at him as he worked or as he studied beside him. There were times when the smile that graced his face was too kind and soft to be that of a friend. When his hand left an invisible mark too hot to be from someone who had no feelings on the matter one way or the other. But then what did he know of friends?
The spell hinges on Jack's blood being the blood of Cas’ son, just like what was needed for the spell Nick used to try to bring Lucifer back. Jack being family will bring Cas back. And dammit everyone is going to know that.
