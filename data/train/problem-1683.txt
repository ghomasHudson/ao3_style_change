"Three reasons," John explained, slowing his stride so Sherlock could catch up.  "First," he said, counting on his fingers, "it's free.  Second, it'll be quieter and a bit more private, which is something valuable when you're sleeping in the back.  Third, it's real easy to use the backroads to get back on the highway.  I
Releasing his hand with a faint smirk, Candii sat back down in her chair, indicating with a wave that Sherlock should also be seated.  She picked up the square bottle of Fiji water sitting on the desk beside her and unscrewed the cap to take a drink.  "Do you want one?" she asked, holding the bottle up.
Sherlock bit his lower lip and added just the faintest hint of wobble.  "Is that the only thing?  Because you seem tense...you haven't flirted with me at all tonight...are you...I thought...did I misread the situation?" Sherlock asked, giving John an opportunity contradict him.
John huffed and elbowed him lightly in the ribs.  "Stop that…that's no way to talk about my client…yours either, since she hired you to work with her horse."
The next morning Sherlock wakes curled against John’s chest, body warm with sleep. He’s so comfortable he doesn’t want to move, but he’s also internally panicking at the idea of having to shift away.
“Be nice to have a new vest on,” he murmurs, “Thoughtful of you, thank you.” Sherlock glances up, wondering if he’s being mocked, but John’s eyes are crinkling wonderfully at the corners, confident and straightforward, and Sherlock feels his stomach settle so quickly that it gives him vertigo for a moment.
The man laughs. Sherlock feels better but continues, "Guess I have to get a cab," in a low mutter, "if I can even get this hulk of metal to a parking place." But the man smirks.
Sherlock brushes his teeth, as John disappears again, presumably to do the same. When he’s done John comes back to collect the lot, deposit it in the bathroom, and then he steps in again, and asks, “Where do I sleep?”
Padding footsteps, and then a soft rustle of fabric. John’s face appears in his line of sight as he kneels between Sherlock’s knees, one hand on each as he looks up to scan Sherlock’s face. Sherlock’s heart skips once and he opens his mouth, desperate to say something that will fix the mess in his head, but John shakes his head softly before he can speak.
A cab ride later and he’s entering 221B, bottle in hand. As soon as the door closes he’s snickering, and the snickers start to turn to laughter.
“If I wash your hair, would you fall over?” John asks, and the tone surprises Sherlock by being nonjudgemental. Sherlock considers the night before, fingers sunk in his curls, searching for the bump to his head.
John is hard. The knowledge has him shuddering suddenly, breath in tight pants, and even as John considers pulling away with a lean, Sherlock clutches his thigh again, closer. He trembles and suddenly realises what they must look like, Sherlock on his knees, shaking at John’s feet.
Coming back to is like waking up after a long dream. The condom’s gone, and he’s wiped up, his trousers still around his thighs, John’s arms around him. He’s drawn Sherlock closer, leaning him forward so he's slumped into the man’s shoulder, panting softly still. Sherlock’s trembling, in contrast to John’s quiet steadiness.
“Conditioner?” he says. It comes out like begging, and he’d blush but he’s far past embarrassment now. The low chuckle above him absolves him of guilt anyway.
I have officially graduated University, and I get a gap year! I'm excited to be back to writing things for fun rather than coursework.
, wants to make John remember this even after the week is up, whenever he sees someone else on his knees.
John knows what he’s doing, but more than that he seems to know how to read Sherlock, taking each bob of his head slowly, gauging what Sherlock needs each time. Sherlock’s head rolls against the wooden back of the chair, trying to ground himself as he forces his hips not to writhe, but it’s so good. And the whole time John’s looking at him, those eyes fathomless as he doesn’t let Sherlock hide, drawing out pleasure after pleasure.
“Father, we mustn’t spend any more time with these hooligans,” he says, even as he winks over his father’s shoulder at them both. “Look at what they’ve done to your suit!”
“I don’t care,” he says, after a long moment. “And I do care. I feel stupid going, but if I don’t work with the company then I lose my stake in it – that’s how the trust is set up.”
“Sleep,” he agrees quietly, and Sherlock’s shoulders fall slightly, relieved, as John smiles. “I’ll make the bed if you want the toilet first.”
John has commandeered his sofa, watching the telly in Sherlock’s dressing gown. There's a now-empty mug next to him as he munches on chips, watching something Attenborough’s narrating, from the sound of it. He looks completely at home, fitting into 221B like a missing puzzle piece, and Sherlock feels his heart thump wildly.
Sherlock’s mouth goes dry at the sudden proposition. He doesn’t know. He’s well-versed in himself, of course; he knows what he likes to do to himself. But he doesn’t know what he likes others to do to him. The prospect is daunting.
Oof. Sorry for the long wait. Been writing Avengers fic and it was flowing really well, so that's been highest on the agenda lately. Back to your not-so-regularly schedule Sex God John Watson.
“Of course not,” James says, cheeks going pink. Charles is now having an internal fit, Sherlock notes, and if they were in a less formal arena he’d be shouting. As it is, he’s a wonderful shade of purple.
John nods slowly, rubbing his back. “I see,” is all he says, and Sherlock sighs. If he were a better man, John wouldn’t have that moue in the corner of his mouth.  It leaves eventually, but only because Sherlock knows John isn’t the sort to brood. Sherlock reaches up curiously, touching the spot where the lines on his forehead are now smoothed, and John’s eyes flicker to his, slightly amused.
By the time he can go home he’s trying hard not to second-guess everything he’s chosen over the past 24 hours. He can distract himself with thoughts of John in various suits, but that only lasts until he gets to the door, and that’s when his hands start shaking.
“Ah,” John says, eyes twinkling. Sherlock blushes; John seems to somehow know how much Sherlock will enjoy putting Mycroft out. “I’ll be sure to wear something appropriate.”
“Yes, well. It’s been a while since I was in practice,” John says, but Sherlock knows he’s worked recently, even if he can’t put his finger on how he’s deduced it at the moment, because Charles has started talking again.
For a moment Sherlock considers giving the address of a hotel, because after all, this man is a stranger. But then he decides he doesn't care, and he actually does want that liver. He’s still pretending to himself that he isn't going to ask this man up to his flat. He gives his actual address, and the man nods. Sherlock watches him shift the car into gear and has a brief moment of anger that it's so easy for him, but then notices the man's fingers on the gearstick and has a small internal conniption about their callouses and where he might feel them. The ride is quiet: Sherlock doesn't know what to say and the man seems content to say nothing.
He’s interrupted by a waiter, who comes by to ask about wine; Charles orders the most expensive glass of champagne with a voice meant to carry to the next table, then John glances at Sherlock and orders them both a moderately priced red. James, red-faced, is hastily scanning the wine menu when John speaks. “Do share our bottle?”
Sherlock loses track of time when he plays the violin. It’s a place for his mind to stop its racing and focus only on the next note, the next draw of the bow across the strings. When a calloused hand takes his, stopping the next movement, he’s taken off-guard, eyes wide. John’s hand holds his steady, not jerking the bow or the violin, careful of the instrument.
Sherlock changes his movements, eyes on John’s face, paying attention now; when John hitches a breath, he remembers the flick of his tongue, does it again. With time he finds what John likes, what makes his thighs tremble and his jaw shift to suck in a breath through his teeth. Slow bob of his head, a suck, a twist of the tongue, hollowed cheeks and pull back slowly, repeat, a steady rhythm; he wants John to fall into it. He does, beautifully, body unravelling for Sherlock, thighs spreading wider even as they tremble. John’s hand is still careful, but less guiding and more simple contact; John’s face creases with a million small lines. Sherlock feels like god and supplicant equally, powerful and worshipping at once at the altar that is John Watson’s feet.
“Good to meet you, James; I’m Sherlock Holmes, as I’m sure you know, and this is Doctor John Watson.”
“Come in,” he says, as though he’s not standing in Sherlock’s doorway. He takes Sherlock’s hand, and guides him in, closing the door neatly behind him. His touch is gentle, guiding Sherlock to the sofa to sit, shaky legs only barely making it.
There's a knock on the window, and Sherlock pants at the dashboard. He’s coming down from the shout and realising there's probably a constable just outside his window, ready to scold him for blocking the road. But it's not a cop. It's a man with a beard and sparkling eyes and slicked-back hair, wearing a suit that Sherlock likes much better than his own, even though it probably cost a fraction of the price. The man is looking amused, which takes Sherlock off-guard, because... well. Most people would be frightened, or annoyed, or defensive, not amused.
“This suit is going to need a thorough cleaning and a press, I’m afraid,” he says, as the wrinkled fabric parts to reveal Sherlock’s chest. Sherlock isn’t thinking about the suit. He’s thinking about how it would be so easy for John to spread his fingers over Sherlock’s skin.
even as his heart is singing. The man raises his eyebrows, glances over Sherlock, glances over the car, then glances up at the flat.
He wants. He wants to know the feel of him, the taste, he wants to know if he can do to John what John did to him the night before. His stomach has swooped down and back up again, and he parts his lips, afraid to ask.
Sherlock actually does think the business could do well, but certainly not under his hand. Only someone personally motivated could manage it. He is noticing that James seems on edge, as though he’s biting back comments he wishes he could voice. Attached to the company, then, despite it being the family business.
“Our profit margin last year was affected by that ridiculous business in the Caribbean,” he says, as though hurricanes were a mere inconvenience, but an inconvenience that had been purposefully created to upset his nerves. “We’ll be right as rain this next year, and I’m sure under your business management, you’d thrive.”
Sherlock knows he’s hard, the sight having made his cock strain at his trousers, leaving them distended and wet. John’s hands slide from his knees upward, and Sherlock’s thighs tremble once nervously before opening. He does want this, even if he’s not sure what this is. It’s already more intimacy than he can ever remember having. John’s eyes are steady on his, though, and when his hands move to the placket of Sherlock’s trousers, Sherlock only remembers to breathe out of sheer stubbornness that he doesn’t want to faint.
Sherlock wonders if John’s noticed that his breathing has gone tight. He wonders if John can feel the tension in his skin. John’s fingers, calloused and sure, are still undoing buttons, but then — but then — John lets his hands settle on Sherlock’s waist, and draws him close.
John’s hand is careful, never pushing him too far, but stroking his curls and guiding him gently; when Sherlock pushes himself too far and nearly gags himself, John tugs him back. When he forgets to breathe, John gently pulls a curl, making him suck in a breath. He’s patient with Sherlock, not urging him on, not yanking or demanding. Sherlock’s immeasurably grateful for the steadiness of the contact. It still takes a few minutes before he can bear to open his eyes.
"Not a problem," the young man told him cheerfully.  "You aren't the only person that does that.  Once you're done with that sheet, bring it up here and I'll get you back to see Doctor Stamford."
"I love shoe shopping," the blond confessed with another giggle, "but I hate breaking in new boots.  The trick I do to get a perfect fit every time is to take a nice, hot bath, wearing nothing but my boots.  I light some candles, pour myself a glass of bubbly, and I just lay back and soak in that nice hot water for an hour or so."  She informed him of these facts with a flirtatious bat of her lashes that made it look like something was caught in her eye.  "I did it with this new pair I bought last month and now my boots fit perfectly!  I just soaked and soaked; it felt soooo good," she continued with a rapturous moan.  "You should try it sometime."  She shimmied her shoulders, and blew out another sultry sigh at the memory.
in a way that makes Sherlock’s stomach do a flip every so often. There’s also the way John opens every door for him, ushering him through without a hint of pretentiousness or condescension. Sherlock has the odd feeling of being cared for without being paternalized, which is very strange. The only person he normally allows to care for him, aside from his brother, is Lestrade, and Lestrade is decidedly paternal about it (as far as Sherlock can figure out, Lestrade has decided to adopt Sherlock. Sherlock doesn’t know how he feels about this yet).
“I think it’s wonderful, helping people,” James says, sitting without taking his eyes off John, whose smile is slightly tight. Sherlock doesn’t know why.
“If you get yourself some extra things for your stay,” he says, one hand grabbing the other before he can fidget, “I’d be pleased if you put them on my card.”
Sherlock nods, but his legs are trembling like a newborn fawn’s, and after John helps him stand, he’s left clutching John’s arms for support. John’s eyes crinkle, and he bends and lifts, and Sherlock squeaks, clinging round his neck, breathing
John opens his eyes when it’s over, lifting his head with what looks like an effort to look down at Sherlock still on his knees. He must look a mess, hair awry and chin wet with drool and come. He doesn’t want John to look. Instead, he carefully tucks John away in his trousers, tugging his handkerchief out and scrubbing his own face, pulling back to stand. He offers his right hand, the left still blistered and sore. “Sleep, I think,” he says, trying to sound casual, but his voice is cracked and dry.
Sherlock nods, taking in the way James suddenly jumps and looks at his father miserably. Ah, a pinch beneath the table.
John reads his face, scanning it, and then stands again. For a moment Sherlock’s worries he’s going to leave, but instead, he slips off the dressing gown, and Sherlock’s hands clench on the wooden armrests of the chair as he forgets how to breathe. John is effortlessly sensual, comfortable in his body, unafraid of Sherlock’s eyes devouring the sight in front of him. John folds the dressing gown and bends, giving Sherlock quite the view, before placing it on the floor and kneeling again, using the fabric as a pad for his knees.
“You’ll come,” he says, meaning it to be a question, but his head is tilting into John’s touch without permission, his voice coming out breathless.
“You’ve been here before,” Sherlock observes. It’s a decently expensive place, rather nouveau riche for London but in one of the newer buildings by the Thames; as a result, even the more traditional gentlefolk have decided the place is acceptable for the sake of the view. John’s admiring it as Sherlock speaks, and he glances away from the window to smile at Sherlock.
“Oh, it’s not the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever said,” he replies, and Sherlock’s laughter turns deeper in his throat as John adds, “I
“You hated your charity gala, you hated your meeting, you definitely hate the small talk and ridiculous posturing at polo,” John says, eyes warm as he reaches across the breakfast table to adjust Sherlock’s collar. Sherlock knows his ears have gone pink, but he doesn’t care, because John’s hand is so close that he can imagine the heat of it on his skin.
Sherlock is already upset because he's had to go to a charity gala and Mycroft made a comment about his experiments. His PA, Molly, is so sweet but also can't seem to manage to keep truly terrible people from finding him, so he had to have a talk with Magnussen. He hates Magnussen; Magnussen only ever talks about business, but he does it in a way that makes Sherlock feel like he's wanting to buy Sherlock instead, and it leaves him feeling grimy in his skin for hours after. He'd snuck out but his driver apparently has a fucking American manual car where everything's on the wrong side and it's fucking with his head, and he's managed to stall it, and he's tired. He slams his hands on the wheel, grips, and shouts like a maniac for a moment, because fuck this, fuck it so much, fuck it, he has a liver in the fridge and he wants to go home and dissect it, that's all, and if he manages to get liver juice on this suit and ruin it, so much the better, he hates this suit.
Evidence that John is clever should not come with an attendant erection, Sherlock tells his body firmly, no matter how arousing it is.
John manages to catch the unopened bottle of red before it shatters itself on the floor, Sherlock notices, as Charles sputters indignantly at the state of his front. There is very nearly shouting, but then James quickly takes his father’s elbow.
It’s overwhelming. There’s taste, so much, salty and dark on his tongue. He knows he’s probably terrible at this – too eager, tongue darting everywhere to get more of the taste, and he can’t take John very far at all, he has no finesse. All he has is eagerness. He wants John, wants him so badly his chest aches with it: if this is the way to show him, Sherlock will do this for the rest of the week. It’s not like it’s a hardship. John in his mouth is everything he wanted in the shower that morning. Sherlock feels centred for the first time since he’d knelt on the shower floor.
“A new shirt, and shoes,” Sherlock finishes, voice surprisingly steady for the way his hands are shaking. John nods with a wry smile.
Sherlock shook his head against John’s shoulder. Now that John’s said it, he can feel his fingers shaking, the irregular heartbeat. He hasn’t had an anxiety attack since university, and now the sight of John in a suit has managed it. Sherlock is unsure whether that says something about John, or Sherlock’s self-control.
“Yes. I can give you the difference back if you like,” he sounds slightly reluctant, and Sherlock blinks. John isn’t badly off, he knows – no-one who can afford a suit like this is poor – and he doesn’t seem high-maintenance. A wife? Children? Where is the money going?
Charles is taken off guard, as Sherlock meant him to be. His son, however, starts in his seat, and Charles glares at him before continuing, gruffer than before.
Sherlock pulls his hand back, but John takes his hand and squeezes it gently. “Let’s go buy out a business, then,” he says, “If you can.”
“Just breathe for me,” John urges gently, putting a hand on his chest to feel his lungs. “That’s it. Easy now.” The hand makes his heart stop and then restart as Sherlock sucks in air, then releases it in a gust.
Dusting himself off, the clown walked back over to the horse and dropped to his knees beside its head, both hands clasped together in a symbol of desperate entreaty.  The horse shook its mane and rolled back up onto its belly.  After miming his thanks, the clown walked back around and slung a leg over the horse’s barrel.  The moment he was situated, though, the gelding pushed itself up on its forelegs but kept its hind legs folded underneath it.  The result was a living slide that the clown slid down landing on his bum.  Both remained frozen in their respective positions, before the horse turned its head back towards the clown and let out another loud whinny.
charge my exorbitant rates.  Besides—" she'd added, running one manicured finger up Sherlock's shirtfront before tapping him lightly on the lips, "—the challenge is a turn-on."
Sherlock blinked as John landed beside him, slightly in awe of how John had just risked serious injury or sudden death for the sake of a patient and wasn't even breathing heavily.  'Balls that would make a bull jealous indeed,' came the thought.  Sherlock swallowed hard, trying to keep the entirely inappropriate surge of lust in check when what he really wanted to do was slam John against the nearest vertical surface and ravish his mouth.
Brenda glared at him, but shook her head, dismissing Sherlock's theory.  "No.  There were a few people walking around, and yeah, some of the other horses seemed restless, but nothing unusual for an event.  It was actually pretty quiet in the barn."
"Is he used to being blindfolded?" Sherlock asked from where he was carefully affixing the muzzle to Scotty's head.
Almost every bar-goer had been wearing unrealistically clean cowboy boots, but the accompanying fashions had varied depending on the gender of the wearer.  The women generally favored skin-tight jeans, raggedly cut-off denim shorts, or short swishy skirts.  All choices that were completely impractical for the current British temperatures or their alluded-to 'professions'.  The women's shirts had ranged from sleeveless blouses with plunging necklines and rhinestones to waist-baring, flannel shirts tied underneath their breasts.
The foreman had made sure to introduce 'Billy Scott' to the rest of the staff as the expert Candii Ross had hired to rehabilitate Devil's Blaze and to inform everybody to give Sherlock their complete cooperation, before launching into a brief overview of the day's schedule.  Sherlock hadn't missed Socorro Valdez or Carlos Montoya's expressions of relief at the news that 'Billy' would be taking over Blaze's care.  Nor had he missed the somewhat dark looks that the Tredannick brothers had sent him, though he didn't know why.  The rest of the employees, Kate Holdridge, Cole Johnson and Mark Spencer had looked at Sherlock with varying shades of curiosity or bemusement.
"Eh, I don't really recall," Old Wayne said evasively.  "Didn't like him much.  I told that girl she could do better than date a guy who picked his nose and was possessive about her time."
"Steer decorating and goat dressing?" Sherlock interrupted, one eyebrow doing its best to crawl off of his forehead.  "What the hell are those?!"  Although he knew full well what pole bending and trick roping were, there had been no mention of the latter two competitions in the extensive research he'd done about rodeos prior to leaving England.
"The client insisted that the gelding loved the mare and had accepted her as his wife which is why he kept trying to mate with her.  He was trying to follow the religious mandate to 'go forth and multiply—"
"Ah," Sherlock pursed his lips.  He tilted his head, making his curls shift just slightly.  "You...called him by his first name...are the two of you...friends?"
"Only that he worked for Candii Ross for a long time and that the two of you occasionally butted heads."
"Oh, Sherlock murmured, looking at the violin inside, "now that is very fine."  Reverently, Sherlock reached in and brushed his fingers gently along the polished wood, before carefully picking the violin up to examine it.  The movement revealed several pieces of handwritten sheet music that had been tucked into the bottom of the case.  The fragility of the paper and the crabbed shape of the handwriting identified them as being old—probably the work of the violin's previous owner, Sherlock decided.  He spent a few moments studying the run of notes.  The top piece was a waltz titled 'Anna,' an original composition most likely.  The next piece was some sort of lament titled 'James'.  The third sheet was a lullaby in 6/8 time titled 'Johnny Boy'.  There were a few other pieces too.  Some named, some not.  None of the songs were especially technically complex—certainly not when compared to works by Massenet or Schubert.  In fact, they reminded Sherlock nothing so much as some of the traditional Irish instrumentals he'd heard in a pub in Doolin years ago while there on a case.  The songs took most of their beauty from the skill, mood and the improvisations of the musician playing them at the time, rather than the notes inscribed on the page.  Sherlock sniffed.
One of the pickup men nudged his horse closer and leaned over to undo the flank strap buckled around the bronc’s withers.  As the leather fell to the ground, the bronc reared and took off running, oblivious to the two ropes still wrapped around its neck.  Fortunately for the horse, the pickup men were right behind on their own mounts, keeping the ropes taut enough to prevent leg entanglement, but loose enough for the horse to not accidentally strangle itself.  Hatherley, meanwhile, was slowly limping along the arena wall, holding his injured arm against his chest and pausing every so often to bend over like he was about to be sick.  Sherlock felt his own stomach clench in sympathy.  There was a piece of folklore he’d heard before arguing that failure to vomit could be considered ‘proof’ that a bone wasn’t actually broken.  In his own experience, pain tolerance was more likely a factor, and it was evident that anybody competing in rodeos had a very high pain tolerance indeed.
Sherlock gave John a look.  "You actually expect me to believe that putting a brassiere on a goat has legitimate rodeo connections?  I call bovine fecal matter, John."
the analytical part of Sherlock's mind whispered, abruptly shifting Sherlock's focus from John's denim-clad arse to the Work.
Sherlock waited, flipping his phone idly from hand to hand.  There was no telling if Jim was even awake right now.  He kept odd hours, fueled by an almost excessive consumption of Tiger Energy Drinks, Jelly Babies and Swizzels' Love Hearts.
“NICE JOB THERE, CINDER-FELLA!” The announcer chuckled.  “HOPEFULLY YOUR PRINCE KNOWS WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE WITHOUT YOUR MAKEUP!  IF HE DOESN’T, HE CAN COME TO THE HONKY-TONK LATER TONIGHT FOR SOME LINE DANCING!  ACTUALLY, EVERYBODY’S INVITED!  THE BADONKADONK HAS SOME OF THE COLDEST BEERS AROUND AND DON’T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HOW THEIR ZOMBIES WILL LEAVE YOU CRAWLIN’ TO THE HEAD THE NEXT MORNING!!!!   RIGHT…THE JUDGES ARE DECIDING THEIR SCORE…AAAANNNNNDDDD CLINT ENGLAND CHECKS IN AT SEVENTY-EIGHT AND THREE-QUARTERS POINTS, PUTTING HIM FOURTH PLACE, JUST BEHIND BERYL KROON!  GOOD JOB!  NOW IT’S TIME FOR A MATCHUP THAT I’VE PERSONALLY BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO: JOHN WATSON ON SPECKLED BAND!  THERE’S A REASON WHY WATSON EARNED THE NICKNAME THREE-C—THAT STANDS FOR THREE CIRCUITS FOR THOSE OF YOU NOT ALREADY IN THE KNOW.  I’M A TELLIN’ Y’ALL, THIS MAN IS A HECK OF A RIDER.”  The announcer’s emphasis on the word ‘rider’ paired with the music track overhead switching to people singing “save a horse ride a cowboy,” had several members of the audience cat-calling while others laughed or applauded their agreement.
"The zipper’s stuck.  I can’t get my chaps off because the teeth are caught on something.  I need you to unzip it for me."
Sherlock swallowed hard at the unexpected surge of lust the image John's words conjured.  Would John choose a bronze or gold to tilt his eyes towards green, or would he go for a brown or sapphire to emphasize the blue?  He was so distracted by his musings that he stumbled over an uneven patch of ground and would have fallen on his face if it hadn't been for John's quick reflexes.
Donovan raised an eyebrow.  "Danegeld...as in Kipling's "Once you pay them the Danes' gold, you never get rid of the Dane"?"
"Lestrade here…yes, I caught a guy snooping around the stall where that trainer got himself killed a few weeks ago.  Said his name was 'Billy Scott,' but his driver's license reads 'William Sherlock Scott Holmes,' and he's listed as a British citizen.  Is that who…yeah."  There was a pause as Lestrade waited for the person on the other end of the line to stop talking.  Sherlock mentally cursed the man's earpiece which kept him from hearing the other end of the conversation.  After a moment, Captain Lestrade nodded.  "I thought so.  Will do.  See you soon."  He ended the call and turned back to where Sherlock was still sitting on the floor.  "Well, Mr. 'Billy Scott' William Sherlock Scott Holmes…that was the detective assigned to this case.  She'd like to speak to you.  You want to come along willingly, or do I need to arrest you?"
"Yes," Sherlock confirmed, oddly touched and pleased that John had remembered such a trivial, (yet personal) piece of information.  "I received my first sixteenth-sized violin as a gift for my fourth birthday and started lessons later that week."
As if summoned, the overhead speakers crackled to life, replacing the music with the overly-enthusiastic voice of the announcer.
"Wait," Donovan interrupted, holding up a hand.  "I'm a detective, not a horse trainer, so cut me some slack if this sounds like a stupid question, but you just talked about somebody shooting an animal capable of winning almost a half million dollars?  In a single race?  Not to mention all those stud fees and whatnot the reporters at the Kentucky Derby talk about?  Couldn't they have...I dunno, done some sort of surgery or something to repair the broken leg?"
"It's nothing.  Just old memories," John replied evasively, smoothing his face back into its normal, affable expression as he turned the key in the ignition and the engine rumbled to life.
"You can shut up, now, John," Sherlock interrupted with a snarl.  Beads of sweat were rolling into his eyes and making them sting.  He reached up to rub them away.
Officer Gregory gave Sherlock a puzzled look, clearly taking in Sherlock's bespoke suit.  "Are you a lawyer or insurance adjuster, Mr. Holmes?"
"Naturally," Sherlock replied as he cracked the lid of the water bottle open, not caring if his answer made him sound egotistical.  There was a reason he was the only Consulting Equestrian Expert in the world. He took a sip and sighed in pleasure.  The water was refreshingly cool against his parched throat, reminding him abruptly that he'd allowed himself to become uncomfortably dehydrated in the unfamiliar Texas heat.  Sherlock took another longer drink, then ran the chilled bottle against the back of his neck. He could feel the heat radiating from his skin, evidence of a sunburn, despite the high collar of his shirt and the waterproof sun protection he'd slathered on earlier.  Lovely.  With a grimace, Sherlock pulled the passenger door open and climbed inside.  The inside of the cab was hot, but at least it was shaded.
"I'll be gone all weekend starting next Saturday in order to investigate a rodeo that is known to be a target for activists and saboteurs."  It was a declaration, rather than a request for permission.  Mycroft had been the one to teach him the trick of taking advantage of habituated social conventions towards acquiescence in the face of declarative statements.  It was especially effective on individuals used to taking orders.
Bloody foam surrounded the horse's mouth, dribbling down its nylon halter and streaking the elbow-length bovine exam gloves of the person restraining the stallion's head.  Oddly enough, despite the sedative, the horse's eyes were wide and staring, blown pupils almost completely obscuring the irises.
Sherlock opened and closed his mouth and pursed his lips as he tried to think of an appropriate response.  "Dishes?" he offered, deliberately pitching his voice upward at the end so the inflection signaled a question, rather than a statement.
"Oh, um, okay," Molly stammered, looking slightly hurt at how fast Sherlock exited the truck.  "And afterwards, we'll go get coffee at 'Ground Zero'?"
Instead, what he'd encountered had been a blatant mockery of true equine professionals and cattlemen alike.
A fireproof box with the key helpfully hung on a ring around the handle yielded a bevy of potentially interesting papers, including letters from a solicitor's law firm, copies of loan documents, John's passport, tax filings, a handwritten list of accounts and their affiliated passwords, several handwritten letters and a miscellaneous assortment of personal and financial records.  Scanning everything took longer than Sherlock would have liked, but John never stirred.
"I know the premise is the same as bronco riding," Sherlock replied, puzzled by John's conversational tangent.  "I know the rider does their best to stay on an out-of-control animal for the requisite amount of time.  Both the animal and the rider are scored individually on their performance.  The totals are added up and the highest qualifying ride wins the division.  Bovines and horses are both prey animals.  They both buck, they both flee danger.  As far as I can tell, the only real difference between the two events is that bulls outweigh horses by several hundred pounds."  It was, of course, a gross simplification, but it wouldn't fit his character as a horse whisperer and rodeo novice to say otherwise.
"Well then," Mike began, a smile hovering around his lips, "we'll need an x-ray first.  My machine's digital so I don't have to worry about the price or time involved in traditional films.  Billy, if you'd care to follow me?"
"They are kept in a locked refrigerator until they can be appropriately examined.  Why?  You suspect Doctor Watson of something?"
"Oh!  Um...I'll...just...let you do that…" Molly brushed a few wisps of hair out of her eyes.  "I'll...um...see you at dinner."  Giving Sherlock one last hesitant smile, she left, pulling the door firmly shut behind her.  Sherlock could hear the clatter of her boots across the wooden porch, followed by the faint crunch of gravel as she walked off.
There was a brief pause, followed by tentative "Hello?  Um, this is John Watson.  I'm trying to reach Billy Scott?  I, er, got this number from Molly Hooper?"
"Hey," the rider began, seemingly sensing Sherlock's frustration.  He nudged the brim of his Stetson up, revealing eyes the same dark blue as his chambray shirt, before leaning close to better study Sherlock's face, his mouth set in a worried frown.
"Mmm, no," Sherlock lied.  He swallowed hard.  There was no way he was going to give John the satisfaction of being right.
"The face my brother does when he's figured something out.  Or when somebody drives by in a restored classic Bentley from the fifties.  The one that most people get when they've just had an orgasm.  Spill," Donovan ordered.
Sherlock set the quarter-full mug aside and crossed one arm across his torso in a stretch, a small smile of satisfaction creasing his lips as he did so.  Fortunately, for the Work he didn't just see, he
A familiar date caught Sherlock’s eye.  “What about this one?” Sherlock asked, tapping a fingernail against the screen under an entry for Sam Bayard and Penang.  “Did somebody die here?”
“Do I look like an idiot, John?” Sherlock interrupted, reluctantly sitting back on his heels.  He kept his hands planted on John’s thighs, though, teasing the tender skin with firm passes of his fingers.
Sherlock squeaked in surprise as John suddenly grabbed him about the waist, spun and shoved Sherlock's back against the wall in turn, only to let the noise trail off into a moan as John renewed his assault on Sherlock's kiss-swollen lips.
Sherlock fidgeted slightly, the fingers of his left hand tapping out excerpts Bruch's Concerto No. 1 in G Minor, Op. 26 to pass the time.  The slightly frenetic fingering of the last movement reflected his impatience perfectly.  He missed his violin; playing brought focus when he was trying to think, making muddled solutions clearer, but he wasn't willing to risk his beloved Guarneri at the hands of incompetent security screeners, subject it to jostling and knocks in an overcrowded bin or leave it out for random strangers to touch in the name of 'tidying'.  Even Mrs. Hudson, with her blatant disregard for the sanctity of Sherlock's experiments, knew better than to move Sherlock's pride and joy.
Sherlock tipped his head in acknowledgement.  The reciprocal apology was unexpected, but appreciated nonetheless.
"When you say the cattle are being abnormally aggressive, how do you tell?  Especially in a profession where bulls and steers are specifically bred to buck?"  The more he could encourage John to talk, the less likely John was to dwell on his verbal slip-up.
John smelled of something spicy and slightly woodsy.  It was enough to make Sherlock think of wood fires, Molton Brown's Re-charge Black Pepper Bodyscrub Bar and skin-warmed silk sheets.  It was addicting.  He wanted to stay there and steal a taste, but The Work called.
John pursed his lips as he looked at Sherlock sideways, visibly trying to decide what cuisine to offer next.  "Okay...tea or coffee...and it sounds like you aren't in the mood for heavy salt or grease.  How do sandwiches sound?"
"Are you sure you're okay with this, Billy?" John asked, biting his lower lip as he watched Sherlock pull both the cast-iron skillet and the larger of John's two saucepans out of the bottom cabinet.  "I know it's a bit stuffy in here, but I don't usually keep the AC cranked down real low."
"Fine," John huffed, exasperation evident in his tone.  "Lane Frost was a pro bull rider during the seventies and eighties.  A lot of people idolized him.  He was the 1987 world champion, after all.  His death was kind of a freak accident.  He'd just finished a successful ride on Taking Care of Business at the Cheyenne Frontier Days Rodeo when the bull charged and got him in the back with one of his horns—this was before riders started wearing padded vests, by the way.  The impact broke several of Lane's ribs, one of which severed his abdominal aorta.  He collapsed and died right there in the arena."
"Well, I can still kind of empathize with your brother." John replied, grinning.  "Most of us had that message drilled into our heads by our parents.  At least he got lucky and you grew up to be a functional adult," John continued, a faint trace of bitterness colouring his tone.  "Harry's only a few minutes younger than me, but the way she acts, it could be a decade.  She's always calling me up, asking me to bail her out of trouble and half the time it's because she's...well...never mind."  John gave a quick, tight smile.  "Let's not talk about that.  Changing the topic, do you play piano?"
He'd grudgingly participated in the requisite 'bonding,' which included two rounds of obligatory shots, (the first to the Triple C's success and the second to him as "the new guy.").  He also played three games of darts against Cole Johnson at the other man's insistence.  Cole wasn't a terrible player, but he wasn't fantastic either.  Certainly not on par with Mycroft by any stretch of the imagination.  The only challenging part had been ensuring that his opponent had won the third round without giving the appearance of allowing him to win.  He'd endured the conciliatory back-slaps before using his loss as an excuse to go to the bar and purchase a drink, trusting that if he took his time, Alice, Edith and the rest would get distracted and forget about him until the bar closed or the Triple C's employees were ready to leave (whichever happened first).  So far, it appeared to have worked.  He'd managed to secure a small table at the back of the room and had mostly been left alone to think.
Most of them were full of necessary-but-boring-equipment and supplies.  They were also colour coded.  Yellow for gauze, flex bandages and swabs, orange for antiseptic wipes, antiseptic sprays, iodine tablets and bottles of sterile water for wound irrigation.  The blue box held instant cold and hot packs, while a large white box contained gloves of different sizes, goggles and masks.  The green toolbox contained the supplies necessary for specimen collection: vacuum syringes, catheters, sample bags, sterile swabs, transport tubes and cardboard boxes containing an array of color-coded, plastic, Vacutainer collection tubes.
Sherlock's mind flashed to the contents of his wallet: UK license, British NHS card, and his European Health Insurance card.  The answer to the receptionist' question was yes, naturally, but revealing them would destroy his cover, plus there was the fact that neither insurance card would be recognized by the US.  Instead he shook his head.  "Yes and no.  I mean, I have a plan, but it covers catastrophic injuries only, and my deductible is high.  I'd rather just pay out-of-pocket."
Molly's summarization of the previous evening's events left enormous blocks of unanswered questions in its wake.  What had happened between the dart game (which he fuzzily recalled) and him waking up in a horse stall?  And how had he gotten drunk?  He rarely drank, and drinking to the point of unconsciousness was something he hadn't done since his early days in Uni, which meant that it was far more logical to assume that he'd been drugged.
The gesture and command drove the stallion's initial charge forward, past Sherlock, and into a canter around the edge of the pen while Sherlock pivoted on his heels to keep the stallion in sight at all times.  "Faster," Sherlock snapped, stamping his foot and moving in to deliver a quick blow to the stallion's rump when Devil's Blaze pinned his ears back and began to slow in preparation for a turn.  "I said
The vet looked up in surprise, obviously caught off guard by her approach.  He squinted at her in the dim lighting, brow furrowed in apparent concentration before his expression changed to one of recognition.  "Molly Hooper, right?  From the Triple C?"
His phone chimed again with the alert of an incoming text.  Sherlock pulled it free, unlocking the screen as he took a final fortifying inhale of smoke.  As he hoped, it was indeed a message from Molly Hooper informing him that she had just arrived at the airport and would be pulling into the pickup point momentarily.
"Are you vegetarian?" Molly's voice was muffled.  Over the phone, Sherlock could hear the sounds of clanking and thumping, as well as the chatter of voices in the background.
“I could say the same about you...except, oh yes, you’re not even considered a partner.  You only have a job because you-”
Sherlock blinked five times in a row at John's words.  He couldn't help it.  The mental imagery of animals wearing brassieres and knickers was enough to make his eyes cross.  "Why...for the love of God would anybody want to put lingerie on a member of the capra genus, or decorate a castrated bovine?!" he finally burst out.
The timbre of John’s voice caught Sherlock’s attention.  He turned slightly to see John watching him, a warm smile on his face.  “That’s an utterly unimaginative pickup line, John,” Sherlock pointed out, trying, unsuccessfully, to suppress the flush of pleasure at the compliment.
A commotion of shouting erupted from the far end of the corral.  They all looked over to see a trailer being backed in.  "You got any other questions for me?" Ned asked.  "I need to get back.  It looks like the next herd's about to come through."
Sherlock's eyes narrowed suspiciously at the combination of word-play and the feline-based diminutive of Katherine.  He closed his browser to better listen.  He'd already read several of the inflammatory, expose-style articles Kitty Riley had posted on her website.  It would be perfectly in keeping with what he'd observed of the woman's digital persona for her to create a nom de guerre to disseminate more 'evidence' that rodeos were abusive to equines.
"Not that I've been able to determine," Donovan answered.  "We interviewed his most recent known partner, hoping to get a picture of his last few days, but she couldn't tell us much…just that she knew Straker was a good ride in every sense of the word from his reputation on the circuit."  She turned in chair to look at Lestrade.  "Captain?  You actually spend time at the rodeos.  Do you recall anything?"
Mike tucked his chin slightly and raised an eyebrow.  "I see.  What have you had to eat or drink today?"
When Sherlock finally left the corral two hours later, both he and Devil's Blaze were hot and frustrated and exhausted.
"Woah, wait, Billy?  What's going on?  Is something wrong with a horse?"  John protested, ineffectually trying to drag his heels to slow them down.
John led them a further half-dozen meters before turning another corner.  Sherlock kept his eyes closed, trusting John to guide and support him.  There was a brief pause, followed by a thump as John kicked open a door hard enough to make it rebound off the opposite wall as he half-dragged, half-carried Sherlock through the opening to the room beyond.
"Come on now," the voice behind him barked.  Sherlock heard the unmistakable snap of a holster being released.  "Drop whatever it is you're holding, put your hands up in the air where I can see them and turn around slowly."
"That's hyperbole, John, and you know it," Sherlock scolded.  "Animals do not possess a capacity for the human ideological concepts of 'good' and 'evil'...my elder sibling's opinion on cats notwithstanding.  Physically?  Devil's Blaze's  injuries are mostly healed from what I can determine.  There will always be some scarring, but there is no indication that he's still experiencing physical pain.  Mentally is a different matter.  I'm still working on getting him to trust me.  Speaking of, I need to get him some water and walk him out."
"Shut it Holmes," Donovan ordered in an undertone replete with menace.  "This is your last warning.  I'm in charge of this case, not you, and this has gone on long enough.  Mr. Tregennis, Officer Gregory, I apologize for the conduct of my colleague," Donovan continued, raising her voice to address the other adults.  Her tone switched from 'threat' to 'supplicating' with a speed and skill that Sherlock couldn't help but grudgingly admire.  "The case we're investigating has us all stressed, but that's no excuse for Mr. Holmes making your daughter cry, Mr. Tregennis, or his unprofessional conduct."
"Good.  That's good.  Me too, I mean, I'll be here all weekend.  I saw that the Triple C was bringing one of the bucking strings.  I didn't think I'd be lucky enough to see you here.  I'm glad I was wrong," John added with an eyebrow waggle and another beguiling grin.
The endorphins, the teasing, the adrenaline, the apprehension of hacking John's files and the sight of John lying between his thighs, visibly enjoying himself all combined into a tumult of overwhelming sensation and in an embarrassingly short amount of time, Sherlock found himself coming with a shout.
“Hmmm?” Sherlock replied absently, covertly enjoying the way the tight denim of John’s jeans highlighted the excellent muscles of his arse. He glanced up to see John watching him, a smug grin creasing his face.
, and asked me if I'd found an appropriate bedspread in my rodeo!lock research.  I can now say I have!
“But I’m aroused, John!” Sherlock complained, throwing up his arms and gesturing to emphasize his current, tumenscent state.
"Your accent," John replied bluntly.  "Your constants are a bit too clipped, despite that lilt you have.  Also, around here, it's 'y'all', not 'all of you'."
“Okay,” John said, draining his tea and setting Mrs. Hudson's china cup safely out of throwing range on a patch of miraculously-empty kitchen table.  “What’s got you all wound up then?  Is it Anderson again?  Did Mycroft stop by while I was gone?”
Sherlock looked up from the screen with a frustrated huff as his latest attempt was rejected.  His gaze slid over Donovan, taking in the shadows under Donovan's eyes and the slightly wrinkled blouse and trousers she wore.  The faint, slightly spicy fragrance surrounding her was unmistakably either a men's aerosol deodorant or body spray.  Mass-produced feminine fragrances were almost always heavily floral and/or food based: rose, vanilla, brown sugar, cherry, cucumber, peach or lilac.  Donovan's scent meanwhile carried notes of musk, smoke and tangy citrus.  "Late night, Detective?" Sherlock asked waspishly, still more than a little irked at being thwarted in his hacking attempts and determined to take out his frustration on somebody else.
John laughed once, but it wasn't a mean laugh, it was more like it was a rueful acknowledgment of Sherlock's ignorance.  "Even blunted horns can do a lot of damage, Billy," John explained, his tone grim.  "Like a nail against a piece of wood that you hit with a hammer—if you take all that momentum and pressure and concentrate it, it's going to go through something.  The worst part is when a horn gets stuck in the abdominal region and pulled sideways, eviscerating the victim."
Bending down, Sherlock ran the torch's beam over the metal latch handle of the stall door.  He could see the faint smudges of black powder from where somebody had dusted for prints, though whether the forensics team had uncovered anything useful would be another question entirely.  Pulling a handkerchief out from his pocket, he used it to open the latch, before stepping back and allowing the door to swing open into the aisle.  The photographs of the scene that Mycroft had supplied had been useful, but he prefered to make his deductions in person.  Far too often, valuable data was overlooked because of a crime scene technician failing to view a scene in all three dimensions.  They tended to concentrate on the floor and walls, but ignored evidence on the ceiling.  When dealing with an animal that could rear to a height of ten feet, or more, it paid to look up.
Sherlock flinched when Mike’s fingers touched his skin as he started the cuff around Sherlock’s bicep.  The doctor removed his hands and lifted the cuff off immediately.
Sherlock abruptly pushed himself to his feet, startling the people around him and sending the half-eaten bag of crisps in his lap flying to shower on the heads of the attendees on the rows beneath him.
His colleague in Berlin, Klaus?  Kristoff?  Something that started with a 'K' would have scathingly referred to it as "der Säugling Bier" or "baby beer" for its inability to get even an infant intoxicated.  Clearly somebody at the bar was padding their profits by diluting the keg with water.  It certainly explained the terrible taste.  Molly had been charitable when she'd described the beers sold to the rodeo crowd as being same shade and comparable odour of urine produced by a well-hydrated horse.  It tasted worse than one of the cocktails he'd tried at Uni...fornification on the beach...or was it copulation on the beach?  Irrelevant data.  He should have deleted it a long time ago.
Lestrade also hadn’t been exaggerating when he’d mentioned that Johan Straker had a knack for picking winning bulls.  There were quite a few underground websites devoted to tracking particularly successful gamblers in a variety of sports and Straker’s name appeared repeatedly in connection to particularly lucrative bullrides.  Sherlock narrowed his eyes as he began calculating Straker’s reported earnings against the payouts listed.
"Scoot the seat back; give me some room," John ordered, pushing Sherlock back until he was leaning against the corner of the seat and the cab.  Sherlock ended up angled almost diagonally on the seat with his back pressed against the window. John, meanwhile, scooted backwards and shifted until he was kneeling partially in the driver’s side footwell, his body framed between Sherlock's lean thighs.  Sherlock raised an eyebrow, a quip on the tip of his tongue.
"Hold on, let me," John ordered, bending his knees and pushing himself backwards so he was kneeling, with one leg straddling each of Sherlock's hips.  "You okay there, Billy?" John asked, cocking an eyebrow, a hint of a smirk shaping his lips.  "I'm not crushing you, am I?  Do you want me to move?"
"How long am I expected to wear this?" Sherlock demanded, turning to where Mike was still watching them, a knowing smirk creasing his features.  He held up his immobilized forearm for emphasis.  "I'm in the process of working with a dangerous equine.  I need full use of both hands."
It's fun," John explained, his smile evident in his voice.  "'Course, it's a sport better slated for big guys.  Like Keshawn."
Naked, Sherlock flopped diagonally across the bed with a groan.  It was the only way his head and feet would both fit on the mattress.  He grabbed a fresh nicotine patch from the box he'd brought with him and slapped it onto his arm, not bothering to remove the two spent patches.  Folding his hands together, palms facing, Sherlock exhaled deeply as he settled into his thinking pose, analyzing what he'd learned since he'd landed in Texas.
or giant palmetto weevil grubs he was attempting to raise to serve as a source of protein for an experimental horse treat he was creating might have had something to do with Mrs. Hudson's reluctance to assist, (her aversion to earwigs was...impressive, to say the least), but that was beside the point.
"Oh JESUS!" There was the sound of something being dropped, the clatter of running feet, and then there was a blurry figure approaching Sherlock's field of vision where he lay with the right side of his face pressed against the cold concrete, inches away from a clump of manure.  "Don't move," the man's voice ordered as he dropped into a crouch beside Sherlock's huddled form, giving Sherlock a tantalizing whiff of clean sweat, dust, leather, and saddle oil to concentrate on instead of manure.  "Just lie there…catch your breath.  Blink once if you can understand me, alright?"  The man's voice was soft, but firm, brooking no argument.
Mike carefully removed Sherlock’s other boot and sock.  "That’s your problem, right there.  Cotton socks and cowboy boots don’t mix well in Texas heat, because when your feet sweat, cotton socks trap the moisture against your skin, which softens and weakens it.  You want to keep your feet dry, because dry skin doesn’t blister.  Wool socks are actually better in this climate, surprising as that may be."  Mike helped Sherlock lay back on the table and tucked a folded-over pillow under his feet and another one under his head and shoulders, making sure that Sherlock’s head remained below the level of his feet.  "I’ll doctor these for you and we’ll cover them with surgical tape which will protect them from further rubbing.  I’m also going to put a cold compress on your forehead and another one on your neck.  Cooling you off so that your blood vessels constrict will help with the headache.  There’s a straw in your bottle of water too, which will make it easier to sip while you’re laying down," he continued as he placed the bottle back in Sherlock’s right hand.  "See if you can finish that and I’ll be back to check on you in a bit."
"A 'Suspicious Activity Report," Donovan explained.  She picked up the second coffee Sherlock had brought and took a quick sip.  "It's an American financial reporting rule," she continued, setting the cup back down.  "Transactions over ten thousand dollars or just under are supposed to be reported by banks on the off chance they may be related to drugs or possible terrorism.  But Straker varied his deposits so the pattern only shows up if you look at multiple accounts side by side."
Sherlock could hear John licking his lips nervously as he waited for Sherlock's response and he frowned in confusion.  Why would John be nerv—oh.  Yes, Sherlock realized, comprehension suddenly dawning.  The often overwhelming and base human urge to fornicate.  Victor certainly hadn't enjoyed being put off when Sherlock had been absorbed in an experiment or his studies.  Judging by the hesitance of John's question, he'd likely had several dates end with disastrous abruptness from John answering his phone and then rushing off to deal with a patient or his sister.  He'd even said as much.
Donovan, meanwhile, continued to click her way through various websites and email messages in what was evidently an established morning routine.  Her expression switched between resigned, annoyed, and indifferent as she read.  Every so often, she'd pause long enough to take a sip from the coffee cup she still held in a death-grip in her right hand.  After approximately ten minutes, she pushed herself away from the keyboard and spun her chair to face Sherlock.  "Right," Donovan began without preamble, "now that I'm more-or-less awake—" she glanced sideways at the twenty-four hour, military-style clock mounted on the wall, "—what's this about me needing to add Sterndale to my pool of suspects?"
“Good.  Let’s go,” Sherlock interrupted, trading his grip on John’s shoulders to clasp him by the wrist so he could start towing him along in his wake.
"Never mind," Sherlock interrupted, placing a possessive hand on the small of John's back.  "It appears that the queue is starting to form for dinner.  Let's find our seats.  We can catch up with Molly afterwards.
"Ooooh, this is going to be hard," Molly said suddenly, her voice sounding torn.  "They've got funnel cakes
Traveling on the rodeo circuit was expensive, but for some competitors, it was how they earned their livelihood.  A rider's best hope of winning was to be paired with an exciting, aggressive horse and hope that the cumulative score was the highest in the division.  Since horses were randomly assigned, riders ran the risk of drawing an animal that would not perform well.  It was possible for competitors to pay a fee and be assigned a different horse, but it wasn't an option popular with the stock contractors because it reflected poorly on them.
"Tea, preferably something better than that disgusting Lipton pap I found in the cupboards in my cabin.  Failing that, I'll have coffee."
"Wait, wait," Sherlock gasped, wrenching his head away with difficulty.  To his disappointment, John not only stopped immediately, John removed his hands from Sherlock's waist and took a large step backwards as well.
The so-called peaceful countryside was surprisingly noisy; far noisier than London seemed to be.  The clicks and rasps of a multitude of insects filled the air, punctuated with the odd howl or screech from some other animal.  Breathing deeply, Sherlock sat down on the porch steps and looked up at the sky.
"Temperamental as ever," Sherlock replied, raising and lowering one shoulder in a graceful shrug.  "Leaving him alone for the weekend was a mistake, as I tried to explain to Ms. Ross, but she was insistent.  I've spent the past two days re-acclimating him to my presence.  I'm hoping to get him into a rope halter next week so I can start on groundwork…" Sherlock continued, launching into a detailed lecture about his methods.  He alternated between giving John hesitant looks through his lashes and one or two 'accidental' brushes of their knees under the table.
"So Mike has told me, yeah, starting with the Hippocratic Oath.  He's got some stories about the places he was stationed when he was working for Doctors Without Borders.  But those laws are intended for doctors treating human patients," John pointed out dryly as he re-buckled his own seat belt and tightened it across his chest.
"Pygophilia," Sherlock mumbled, rubbing his cheek against John's chest the same way a cat would rub their chin or jaw along something to declare 'MINE!'  John smelled wonderful: a bit like sweat, a bit like Sherlock and a lot like sex.
Candii's pace didn't change as she led Sherlock through a set of extra wide double doors and down a short flight of stairs.  Sherlock refused to let the burning ache in his feet manifest on his face as he followed Candii across the yard, around a large barn to a set of distant structures.
Doctor Früh gave him a disdainful look.  "As far as samples, we have collected blood, urine and fecal matter," she began.  "Those are currently being analyzed by a laboratory.  I hope to know more in a few hours.  My primary concern, however, is the danger that New Scotland Yard presents to both himself and my staff.  As you can see, New Scotland Yard is currently quarantined for rabies—yes, Mister Holmes,  I am aware of his current vaccinated status—" Doctor Früh snapped when Sherlock snorted "—this is a standard precaution.  New Scotland Yard will be kept under close observation for progression of his neurological signs.  If he successfully passes the quarantine period, I will revise my treatment plan."
"And is it worth it?" Sherlock asked, deliberately leading Lestrade to answer, though he already knew the statistics from his own research.  He tilted his head to one side, trying to meet Lestrade's gaze again in the rearview mirror.
John shook his head and smiled sadly.  "I wish I did.  My grandpa tried to teach me, but I have a tin ear.  I never got past the first few scales before he died and then everything...well, never mind."  John's lips twitched in an unhappy grimace.
Donovan tipped her head in a form of a shrug, before taking another sip of her coffee.  "Okay, so give me an example of sabotage techniques you've encountered so I know what I should be looking for."
Tucking his hands into his pockets, Sherlock began to walk in the direction of the buildings.  With every stride, he could feel the sharp corner of the box of cigarettes he'd tucked into one of his pockets bumping against his side.  Tobacco use was rampant in this part of the country, despite the plethora of billboards advertising help by calling 1-800-QUIT-NOW and the adverts for free smoking cessation aids.  Sherlock smirked.  As tempting as it was to visit a chemist and see if he could acquire some free patches, it would have to wait until he was done investigating.  In the meantime, offering (or begging) a free cigarette was an easy ploy to start up a conversation with a stranger.  The same social ritual was also performed with chewing tobacco, a smokeless alternative for a nicotine fix.   Sherlock grimaced at the memory.  He'd tried it.  Once.  The texture reminded him of nothing so much as Marmite and the reaction of his salivary glands had been…unpleasant, at best.  The thought of using it again made his gorge rise and he was a person who routinely kept samples of manure, blood, urine, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, sputum, hair and different body tissues in his refrigerator.
Sherlock blew out a breath, feeling adrenaline begin to thrum through his system.  John’s name was the eighth on the list, so it’d be a bit before he rode.  The chutes where the bronc riders were preparing was a sea of cowboy hats.  Tan, beige and black dominated, but there a few, more brightly coloured hats visible as well, including a one in a very pretty shade of lilac.
"Bonnie, hmmmm?" Sherlock remarked, dismissing the memory and continuing to rub the dog's chest, absently noting the lack of burrs, ticks or tangles in her coat. It had been a long time since he'd had a chance to pet a dog and Sherlock was surprised by how much he'd unknowingly missed it.  "And aren't you a pretty lady?"
Donovan shrugged.  "I'm no probate lawyer, but if he doesn't have a will and the lawyers can't find anybody else to give the money too, it'll pass to the state of Texas."
"Yes, I know," Mike said with a huff of laughter at Sherlock’s disgusted expression.  "It tastes awful, but it will help you feel better that much faster.  I can try mixing a packet in a bottle of diluted apple juice or strawberry kool aid if that would help.  It’s a trick riders sometimes use to get a reluctant horse to drink."
The room was almost empty by the time John shuffled back in, his expression tense and unhappy.  His shoulders were hunched inward and he was flexing and curling his left hand.
"Indeed," Sterndale replied brusquely, brushing off John's glare.  "Though I am sorry that I do not have better news for you, Mr. Scott."  Sterndale glanced down at his watch.  "Now, moving on to other matters, you said you needed my expertise regarding some cattle, Watson?  I cannot say that I am surprised.  What are the symptoms?"  He raised his mug and took a sip of the still-steaming liquid.
"Doc Watson," the rodeo clown panted, skidding to a halt, his boots sending up a cloud of dust.  He pushed his hat back to reveal a weather-lined face.  "Thank God you're here.  We need you in there bad.  Sholto sent me to help you carry stuff."
"You're worried, aren't you?" Molly asked hesitantly.  "I know Ms. Ross thinks that somebody's targeting the Triple C.  You think she's right.  That's why you're here aren't you?  At the rodeo, I mean.  Not to help wrangle the horses—though I'm sure you're needed—but to see if you can figure out what's going on."
"Not a chance," John purred, licking his lips as he met Sherlock's gaze.  "I'm here with you, aren't I?"  Still smiling, John stepped back slightly and gave Sherlock an unmistakable once-over.  "I probably should have said this from the first, but you look nice."
A few minutes later, the two of them were slowly ambling up the wide thoroughfare, taking in the various attractions and sharing the cone of honey-roasted almonds John had purchased between them.  It was almost as impressive as watching the various street performers in Covent Gardens back home, Sherlock thought as a group of men in matching blue sparkly dresses and long blond wigs hurried by, the paper running bibs on their backs fluttering in the breeze.
"Admittedly, a good portion of your early success is due to your own work ethic and talent.  You didn't develop the muscles in your forearms or the calluses on your hands by watching the telly.  There is also a distinct freckle line on your forehead caused by the helmet you wear while practicing outside, but Cream Soda's contribution to your victories shouldn't be overlooked either.  As your mother's preferred mount, she had the advantage of years of training and competition.  There is an old adage about how 'practice makes perfect.'  A recent study of the Hong Kong racing circuit by Bill Benter by showed that the number of times a horse ran a race on a particular track was the most significant factor in predicting whether or not it would win.  This same trait was evidenced by your late horse," Sherlock continued, as tears began to trickle down Brenda's cheeks.  "A YouTube clip from several years ago shows Cream Soda completing a race in a respectable fifteen point two seconds by herself after you fell off while rounding the first barrel—"
Sherlock shook his head mutely, too shocked and hurt to immediately reply.  The idea of John, blond, fit, intelligent
Doctor Früh nodded.  "He told me was that he had heard reports of livestock poisonings through the grapevine, possibly from eating some weeds, but since nobody knew what was causing it, he wanted to try because of his background in botany.  Something that most vets don't have."
Sherlock found himself holding his breath as he watched the different micro expressions flickering over James’ features while James read: resignation, disappointment, a quick flicker of a smile, a grimace, followed by an eye roll.  John remained seated beside Sherlock on the couch, still ostentatiously sorting through the mail, though the tension in his posture gave him away, meaning that John had clearly managed to deduce the sender as well.
Before Sherlock could do more than blink, the stallion attacked.  His head shot forward, teeth bared and snapping towards the neck and shoulder of the rake-holding cowboy.  With a curse, he threw himself backwards, out of danger's way.  Simultaneously, the one with the bullwhip cracked it in the air beside Blaze's body.  The sudden sharp sound caused the stallion to pull back and rear, even though he was unharmed.  Socorro and his assistant spent several minutes arguing with each other.  Their voices were too low for Sherlock to understand what they were saying, and their backs were to him, making lip reading impossible, but he had no doubt that they were both glaring daggers at the stallion who was now running around in circles inside the paddock.  They filled both dishes, one with a mixture of grain and Alfalfa and the other with water.  When they were ready, Socorro cracked his bullwhip in the air again, driving the stallion to the far end of the paddock.  His assistant took the opportunity to shove both dishes under the bottom rail of the fence while the stallion snorted and reared from a safe distance away.
Jakobo's body lay off to one side.  It had been covered with a horse blanket.  The stall itself was a bloody wreck of broken boards and gore, but there was nothing useful he could discern from the frozen scene.  The next few pages were copies of the official autopsy reports.  The listed cause of death for Melba Toastya was humane euthanasia via a bullet through the lower thorax since the horse suffered an acute, open fracture of the left foreleg.  Shooting a horse through the chest was a seldom-used technique: if a horse had to be euthanized via a bullet, the skull was the preferred target, but in this case, Sherlock could understand why they hadn't.  It was impossible to test destroyed brain tissue for the rabies virus and the resulting...splatter would increase the potential exposure to the virus itself.
"Don't—" Sherlock interrupted.  At Donovan's vicious glare, Sherlock gritted his teeth and fell silent.
"John!" Sherlock exclaimed as he jerked back to awareness, trying not to scream in frustration as his hazy daydreams of John whispering his praises and the wicked delight in John's eyes as he prepared to swallow around Sherlock's cock abruptly vanished to be replaced by the reality of John's presence in front of him.  He blinked rapidly, trying to get his uncooperative vision to focus.
"I haven't forgotten the text you sent about Straker being involved in illegal gambling," Donovan added, when Sherlock remained silent.  She tapped the nib of her pen against her notes.  "Even if it was—somehow—a hit, I don't see how it could be connected to a barrel racer in Arizona.  Straker had been dead for what, a couple of weeks before Brenda's horse went psycho?"
"Yep.  Turns out we had the same crazy drill instructor in Basic.  Watch your step—fresh pidgeon shit's slippery stuff.  I'd hate to have a replay of our first meeting."
"Several bags of candy floss.  A cup of unpleasantly sour lemonade, seven cinnamon churros, one half of some sort of burrito...thing made with a smashed candy floss tortilla and filled with ice cream and sweets...oh, a funnel cake and a deep-fried, cream-filled sponge...cake...thing."  Sherlock wrinkled his nose.  "A twink?  Twinkle?  Twinkly?"  He waved a careless hand.  "Something like that."
Doctor Früh narrowed her eyes in thought.  "Several weeks ago, I believe?  He said that he'd noticed an unusual cluster of unexpectedly aggressive bovines and was trying to figure out why.  He's asked several vets in the area to contact him if they observe something similar."
"Yes!"  He fully expected John to lean forward and kiss him again, maybe spend a few minutes fumbling awkwardly with his belt before giving up and shoving his left hand down Sherlock's jeans and wanking him to completion while humping one of Sherlock's thighs the way the two of them probably would have the other night, had they not been interrupted by Lestrade's inconveniently-timed phone call.
"Then where the fuck did you learn to give head like that?  Nevermind your knowledge about prostate stimulation?!"
"Yeah, well, some bastard set me up and got me fired," Ned bit out.  "Workin' with a bunch of queers ain't my preferred route—no offense," Ned added with a quick sideways look at John, "—but a man's gotta eat and at least a couple of 'em were good enough to vouch for me.  What do you need?  And make it quick; the next herd's about to come through."
"Thank you."  Sherlock stared down at his empty cup, frantically trying to think of a conversational topic that John would find interesting so he could attempt to woo the man.  Coccidioidomycosis?  Histoplasmosis?  Equine Protozoal Myeloencephalitis?
"The slack competitions started at eight," John corrected, reaching up to adjust his rearview mirror.  "It's true that the main performance that I'm competing in doesn't start until this evening, but it'll probably take us a while to find a place to park.  Plus, I have to pick up my registration and drop off my gear.  The sooner I get that taken care of, the sooner I can spend the day feeding you proper rodeo grub and showing you a good time."
“I know,” the shorter man smirked, enjoying Sherlock’s appalled expression as he reached down and adjusted himself in his off-the-rack jeans.  “They’re quite comfortable.”
Running his hand absently over the pool cue in a stroking motion, Sherlock circled the table, studying the position of the various balls.  John's last shot, though effective, had been messy, knocking balls askew all over the table's surface and sending Sherlock's prior strategy out the window.  Fine.  He'd play this game a different way.
, Sherlock decided.  Judging by the body language, the man in the green hat was trying to persuade the reporter to climb into the large red barrel standing upright between them.  After a few moments of ribbing, the reporter obliged, handing his microphone to the woman with the camera.  The barrel was then turned on its side and given a healthy kick by one of the men, causing the hapless reporter inside to yelp.  The crowd burst into raucous laughter that carried clearly across to where Sherlock was standing.  Sherlock rolled his eyes in disgust.  Public school students or adults, what
