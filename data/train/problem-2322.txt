He tried to focus his eyes on the strange, blond man. He did look an awful lot like John. Or had Smith left and was John standing at his bed now?
She still needed to do the washing up. Her brother had always hated it when she left dirty dishes on the kitchen counter.
How the bastard had managed to fake his own death while taking Jim’s life, they never found out. Perplexingly, though, even John Watson hadn’t seemed to know that he’d survived, seeing as he’d been walking around like an utter wreck, still deeply in mourning. Rose had told her that much at the time.
“He’s dead now,” Sherlock interjected calmly. “It happened a long time ago, John.” Sherlock seemed a lot more composed already. “You know, nobody has ever been angry like this on my behalf,” he said softly. “Seeing your anger and the way this affects you, makes me feel like less of an idiot.”
Then the doorbell rang. John turned and walked to the front door. When he opened it, there was a man in a suit standing outside. “When you’re ready,” he said.
Sherlock nodded. Yes, he had briefly been there; during his Hiatus, which he preferred not to be reminded of. Not ‘all this time’, as Sherrinford seemed to really mean, but there was no way to begin to explain that.
This sent a spark through John’s insides and annulled all ability of restraint. A fierce energy flowed through him as he swiftly pushed Sherlock’s knees towards his shoulders and carefully but eagerly entered him.
--Sounds great! Jack says it’s an incredibly posh place though... Maybe we should go to Negozio instead? It’s a lovely Italian restaurant down the road, slightly more affordable. :) Look forward to seeing you too. x
It was as if feeling Sherlock’s living, breathing body against his own, combined with the knowledge that Aunt Viv would never wake up again, lying in her coffin in the cold earth, made him see the essence of life in a radically altered way.
Shortly after, Sherrinford came back with an enormous, bulky object, wrapped in metallic blue paper.
Sherlock sucked in a sharp breath. “Ophelia!” he said, as an idea apparently started to take shape in his mind. “She wanted to play Ophelia in Hamlet. Oh, this is good, this is very good. Last week, in the hospital, I happened to overhear one of the nurses mention that there were soon going to be auditions for a small production of Hamlet by some award-winning amateur theatre group that her son was going to have a go at. Oh! This is brilliant!”
Well, probably when he’d been in his late teens, as he never mentioned her in any of his major life events, nor hinted at his mum not being there when he was little. And it likely happened in an unexpected manner, purely based on age and John never mentioning any sort of progressive disease he was familiar with from a relative’s or carer’s standpoint.
Sherrinford’s breath fluttered. Then his face subtly softened. He stared at the photo, and then at his brother, clearly touched. A shy, hopeful smile flickered across his face, which reassured John there was no need to interfere when Sherrinford reached out to briefly touch Sherlock’s shoulder as he looked at him (once more avoiding his eyes) – almost as if to check if he was real.
He had brought a plant that he remembered Sherrinford used to have in his room. It was one of the very few memories Sherlock had of him. His difficult, deaf brother meticulously running his fingers over the soft hairs of every individual leaf of this plant, that looked like it carried its own babies on its leaves.
According to the doctors, there was nothing more they could do but wait and see how John came out of this after the swelling subsided.
Several hours later, he was going over the results of his experiment, sitting in his armchair with his eyes closed as he committed the observed facts to memory and stored them in the relevant sections of his Mind Palace.
When they arrived at Priory School, the premises were still swarming with officers. There would only be a few more hours till dusk, creating a palpable nervousness in the air. Beverly led them to the DI in charge of the investigation, Lee, and announced to him in no uncertain terms that Mr Sherlock Holmes was to be given free rein and access to all parts of the operation.
Just like John had sat by Sherlock’s side as he recovered from his chest wound in hospital last autumn and also while Sherlock got better after the Culverton Smith case only last month, and had entertained Sherlock with unsolved crimes from the papers, Sherlock now reciprocated by bringing John crossword puzzle books from the kiosk down the hall, which they would solve together. Also, Sherlock read him the new comments on his blog or the occasional breaking news article from his phone.
Sherlock cleared his throat, schooling his face into a solemn look. “John, will you go out on a date with me?”
him at his side, either standing by to back him up with a gun during hazardous pursuits of criminals or just emanating his calm presence while sipping tea in his old chair in 221B. John had become as essential to Sherlock as oxygen, and infinitely more dear.
He thought about what it would be like if they were boyfriends (much as he loathed that term), and he would have to engage in small talk with John every day and often spend time together and regularly have sex with him.
And then some great news: one of my wonderful betas, 88thparallel, has made an amazing cover for this fic, which you can reblog from here, if you like:
When they were passing a particularly pretty village, John remarked, “This is really quite a picturesque area, isn’t it? Sometimes I wonder what it would be like to live in a charming old cottage like that one.” He pointed at a quaint thatched house on a country road leading away from the small group of houses surrounding a little old church.
“Oh yes, quite sure. In fact, I’m rather hoping they will come out of the weekend as contented as we are, as a result.”
There was only one thing he cared about – well, maybe two or three different things, depending on what his mood was – but they all came in a syringe, neat and straightforward. Bill Wiggins had just dropped by with another supply. Home delivery.
“Not really. Except the minor fact that Redbeard was wearing his leash, which was a little unusual to begin with, on the premises, but moreover, it was broken. When autumn came, we discovered the other end of the leather leash in the flower bed nearby the spot where the nanny found you.”
“I understand that now,” Sherlock said, his mind still reeling. “I suppose I should thank you for that. As a child, I wasn’t terribly receptive to brotherly advice, I’m afraid. But I can see why you deemed it necessary, what with our parents being… the way they are.”
“So the three of you spent a lot of time together,” she stated, as a summary of what he’d said. “And
Moore huffed, visibly shocked at the suggestion, and turned to his colleague standing in front of Arthur’s room, mumbling something unintelligible.
The night nurse exchanged some details with the new one who got assigned to this room and politely said goodbye to Sherlock as she left.
“Well… So... How was your date with that guy from Tinder? Kevin?” he said, blinking rapidly, still not looking Janine in the eye.
A body was lying on a silver chrome examination table, covered by a sheet up to the neck. A male pathologist stood at the other side of the table, holding a clipboard and pen. A woman was nearby with her hands on a wheeled trolley with medical equipment on it.
Suddenly, the chains were gone and John was being pulled up into the light. There were people talking. About him. He couldn’t quite catch what they were saying.
Some time after the cleaning staff had finished their rounds and rolled their noisy trolleys into other corridors, Sherlock heard another set of unfamiliar footsteps approaching from the hallway.
Sometimes he watched telly, wondering if John was perhaps watching the same programme at that very moment.
Sherlock smiled an uncertain smile, making a double chin as he tried to look down at John, which was however virtually impossible from this angle.
Rather than going up both flights of stairs, to get his cane – which he knew was still standing in a corner inside the wardrobe up in his old room – he entered the living room first.
Sherlock had no idea how to respond, so he pressed his lips together, trying to think of something to say, while he cautiously removed his condom.
like going anywhere. They’d finally agreed they would nevertheless go out a couple of times a week for some fresh air at least, and always head back the moment John wanted to go home, so that he remained in control at all times. Especially the argument of Rosie needing some vitamin D after having spent months inside, out of the sun, convinced John to occasionally come along outside.
Two hours later, the three of them were on a train racing westwards, on their way to pick up Sherrinford and then continue even further west, to meet up with Mrs and Mr Holmes, and, of course, Mycroft.
“Well,” Hannah said, “they would not tolerate Rosie crying and did not contribute to her stopping to cry in any way, either. Sometimes, they even made it worse, by startling her in all manner of ways, without realising it, apparently. Although they were lovely, helpful and friendly in many ways, they would promptly send me upstairs with her whenever she was unhappy.”
“Still the same,” she sighed. “But then again, there’s always something to complain about at my age, it seems. Now I’ve got this terrible constipation and nausea to go with it.” She shook her head.
There was no doubt in Sherlock’s mind that if John didn’t leave now, everything would only continue to go downhill until they’d reached rock bottom. They would never be able to have sex in a natural way anymore and eventually John would end up leaving him anyway.
When he woke up a second time, the bed was cold and empty. He sat up with a start, only to hear typical John Watson breakfast preparation noises coming from the kitchen.
He could hear John tossing off faster now, and Sherlock slowly realised that the accompanying slick sound was John using Sherlock’s semen as lube, which ignited a surge of fresh arousal in him in spite of his spent state.
After he’d hung up again, he felt like his own battery had died, too, and he collapsed back onto the bed, next to John’s. However, he couldn’t manage to fall asleep anymore.
Sherlock smiled. “At the goldsmith that made Violet’s case interesting enough for me to take it, which led to you solving it, which in turn led to us drinking wine to celebrate, and which subsequently led to--”
John’s cock had become almost painfully hard and was awkwardly leaking precum. He had a hard time keeping his voice steady as he replied, “Oh, Jesus, Sherlock, do you even have to ask?”
“Yes. I was wondering whether you remember or documented any other bruises than the ones around his neck. On the crime scene photos there seemed to be one that was not in your report.”
Just like himself, she had segmental heterochromia iridum in one of her eyes. Difficult to fake with contacts.
Open-mouthed, Sherrinford took in all the kinds of art materials the shop had, which were for a whole range of different media and techniques besides just oil painting, as he himself had only ever done. He largely ignored the products that were already familiar to him, and focused on the rest, intrigued. He ended up buying a couple of spray cans and template stencils.
But that didn’t match with the things he’d said, about having wanted to kiss Sherlock for a long time.
“Yes,” Sherlock exclaimed wearily, “which I’ve been trying to tell you: it makes me horny. Now stop objecting and fuck me.
That same afternoon, Sherlock painted her new names onto her bedroom door in sparkly, sea-green, swirly letters, with a mermaid next to it.
Her smile broadened, and she let herself fall back onto the bed so that a warm ray of sunshine fell onto her face.
, he thought, apropos of nothing. He drew a long breath, wearily looking around Lestrade’s empty office. He’d gone out again, apparently.
“I… I didn’t think you still felt that way,” he said quietly, his eyes flashing between John and his scone.
“I think I have, yes,” Sherlock said, pensively. “It’s rather impressive how children are programmed to copy their parents’ behaviour, in so many ways, and how they automatically approach the world in the same way
“Thank you. And in turn, I apologise for talking about you and John to our parents. I do understand now that I really shouldn’t have, as you didn’t want them to know just yet. I hadn’t realised.”
John closed his eyes. And there it was, in full detail, suddenly impossible to push away: the image of his father, drunk, no longer aware of what he was doing. Uncoordinated. Dangerous. The image he’d been living to erase from his mind.
John took the bottle from him with obvious hesitation. “Listen, er, I need you to know that I’m not sure if I’ll ever, um…, want to switch, you know. I’m just not ready for that, I think. I feel you should know that, before we do this.”
Sherlock smirked, valiantly attempting not to roll his eyes. Then, he added, “Just in case, let’s give her some of these leftover pastries as an additional peace offering for the fuss we caused by attracting another hardened criminal to her premises.”
Whether John was being an appreciative listener to his being particularly brilliant or not, Sherlock just wanted John
“Thirdly, the average couple has sex only about twice a week. At times you skip a week, or two, maybe even more sometimes when you’re busy and tired. That’s
“Like a museum, such as this, but much smaller,” he explained. “More like a shop. People can also go there to buy paintings they like.”
. Sherlock leaned down into Smith’s embrace as he stealthily fished the man’s phone out of his pocket.
“Oh, but you might as well give them to me,” Mrs. Hudson called after him, squealing in a way that was only endearing coming from elderly ladies.
When he woke up the next morning, his arm still on Sherlock’s chest, he gratefully drank in the sight of Sherlock peacefully sleeping a hair’s breadth away from him. He smiled at the thought that he would likely not soon get used to this kind of view. Then he closed his eyes again, not wanting to wake Sherlock just yet.
Mycroft had seen it all, from his bedroom window, and had been insufferable afterwards. “Better be careful, Sherlock. Don’t stoop to this level of hysterics ever again, if you want to be taken seriously in life at all.
And while he had never been one for cuddling and fluff, he found that with Sherlock, what he loved possibly as much as the sex, was just lazily lying entangled on the sofa together, studying the hairs on the other’s neck or the curves of the other’s auricle, or simply feeling each other’s warmth and listening to each other’s breathing. Just being
Secretly glad he could postpone telling John about Sherrinford for a little longer, Sherlock went over to the kitchen, and filled the kettle. He wasn’t particularly looking forward to sharing this painful memory. But John was right. He needed to know.
After a minute of getting lost in the press of each other’s lips, they disengaged and looked at each other in stunned wonder.
- - It is essential that Bob and Jack think that your uncle in South Africa has died. Please ensure to pass this piece of false information to either of them. It’s important. Add that you didn’t really know him and don’t want to talk about it. SH
Sherlock quickly got up and disappeared into the kitchen, where John heard him open and close cupboards and drawers as if his life depended on it.
Once in the bedroom, he gratefully collapsed onto the mattress, his mind almost instantly slipping into oblivion.
“Aww, doggy, doggy. Cute doggy!” she cooed, as she took a small packet of raisins from her coat pocket. “Come on, little doggy. Do you want some raisins?”
He’d wearily plonked himself down in his chair back at Baker Street, but hadn’t so much as taken his shoes off before he heard Mrs Hudson’s footsteps on the stairs.
Yay, an extra fast update! For all my faithful readers, who leave such lovely comments and who are so very patiently waiting until I finish this monstrosity of a fic. ;) You guys give me the energy to keep writing.
Once her steaming mug was ready, she made herself comfortable on the sofa with last Saturday’s newspaper supplement.
“Don’t worry,” John said, “I know it’s a bit too early to propose to you to get married…” He tilted his head and huffed out a bright smile. “… but in the meantime, there is something else I want to propose to you. And I’m sure that Chloe would totally agree, if she could talk about such things.” His hands trembled a little as he carefully lifted the lid off the box Chloe was holding. “Yes, let’s give it to Sherlock now,” he whispered to her, and helped her hold out the opened box in Sherlock’s direction. John’s eyes crinkled as Chloe showed Sherlock the contents.
Sherlock briefly opened his eyes to see John had crawled back towards him and was now tentatively touching himself as he lay on his side next to Sherlock.
“Um. Well, no. Eleven years later, he killed again. On his 18th birthday, for reasons unknown, he lost it, threw over some tables in the common room at the facility, opened the gas on the hob in the kitchen area and managed to run outside, locking everybody in. They all died in the explosion that followed and he was convicted for multiple murder. He spent the next fifteen years in prison.”
The waiter led them to a table behind a divider with plants on it and re-appeared shortly thereafter with the wine list.
“I never thought I’d ever be this happy,” John said, his voice catching in his throat. “And it has nothing to do with a sodding pearl.”
That had done the trick. He’d known that her pregnancy had made Mary extra sensitive to bad odours, so she thankfully changed her mind.
They did kiss good-bye: just a tender nibbling at each other’s lips, brushing and pressing them together as in slow motion. The minute John’s trousers threatened to become too tight, however, he pulled away. If he ever wanted to get home, he needed to leave right now.
Rosie, propped on John’s hip, kept staring and pointing at Sherlock’s wig, but seemed otherwise unimpressed.
Btw I just want to say in advance that I hope that nobody thinks that either me or John is mixing up cross-dressers with transgender people, because we’re not! Just so you know. :)
“I was peckish, but we had no cereal or bread,” John said, his voice practically back to normal. “But we did still have some flour and also some dry yeast, which you probably purchased at one point for some sort of foul experiment I’m not sure I want to know about.” He threw Sherlock a fond look. “Anyway, I actually mixed too much for one loaf, so I’m making another one with raisins that we still turned out to have as well.” He beamed at Sherlock as he rested his hands on the ball of dough.
to believe me,” he pleaded. “I know- I know lying and deceiving comes easy to me, especially for cases, but I promised you last year that I would always be honest with you in future, and I have been. I am.”
), Sherlock estimated they were almost there. The hospital was still a bit further away, but Smith had changed the plans in the last minute and invited them to some studio where he needed to be for the shooting of another ad he was in. But that was alright, as they would still visit his hospital afterwards.
Besides that, he was especially relieved that she hadn’t brought up Aunt Viv. They’d obviously lost touch and she had no idea their aunt was in prison. And John had simply not dared take the risk of telling her, and Harry then creating an uproar trying to prove Vivian’s innocence. And he wasn’t ready to let her in on a truth that only he, Sherlock and Mycroft knew, either.
John resolved to visit as many times a week as he could, in order to be there for her on her final days.
John’s eyes had just started to fall closed as he was drifting off into sleep, when the sound of Sherlock’s voice, serious and concerned, startled him back to full consciousness.
Looking at him uneasily for a moment, Saheed and his colleagues started towards the door. John awkwardly stepped aside to get out of their way.
When they went back into the museum to finish looking at the wings they had not yet visited, Sherlock noticed that Sherrinford had shifted his focus. He now spent more time looking at the other visitors as well, at them admiring the art around them.
He bonelessly collapsed on top of Sherlock, resting his forehead on Sherlock’s shoulder as he tried to wrap his mind around what they had just done and how utterly glorious it had been.
“Can you tell me how tonight’s events are related to the case with the Thatcher busts?” Sally Donovan asked, gently steering him to the purpose of their interrogation.
He looked down in mild horror at his own growing erection. Then at John’s matching one lying flat against his stomach mere inches away, straining and impatient. At the little drop of precome leaking out of John, glistening in the faint light from the streetlamp outside his window.
Sherlock met his gaze momentarily, then lowered his eyes. The world was still blurry. “You know why I’m here.”
They all stopped walking. Moore turned down the corners of his mouth and shrugged. “Maybe he didn’t want to be seen on the corridor?”
Then, feeling completely empty, he got up, leaving the cane propped against a chair next to the bed. With one last look at his best friend, he left the room.
I must say, writing this story was an enjoyable adventure, but also quite an exercise in perseverance. I'm very glad and proud to have successfully completed this writing project, which at times was rather trying but which also improved my English quite a lot, I think. :D Most importantly, it gave me a daily goal to work on during the past 2.5 years (yes, that’s how long this took!), next to my regular – and sometimes stressful – job, and I hope that people will enjoy the end result.
“Someone tried to shoot you. I shot them. Well, their hand, anyway.” Hannah’s eyes scanned the room. Strangely, there didn’t seem to be any blood. “Or perhaps I only hit their gun. Which seems to have done the trick, regardless,” she added, only slightly disappointed. She glanced outside once more, at the landscape of rooftops, where the intruder had come from. “I think it was a woman.”
John was eager to hear all about how Sherlock had found Arthur, so Sherlock told him; and John was once more in no way trying to hide how impressed he was. For a while, things felt just like the old days.
like this, he wondered, not knowing whether their loved one would one day simply walk out of their lives? Not knowing whether harsh words spoken without thinking might inadvertently drive them away forever?
So either the most observant man in the world had remained blind and deaf because he didn’t feel the same way at all, or they were both in the same place and simply lacked the necessary courage – a commodity that during their cases nevertheless they always had in abundance.
John grinned, and gave her her sandwich, even though it was still early. “Here you go, Rosie. Well done!”
Several hours later, he was going over the results of his experiment, sitting in his armchair with his eyes closed as he committed the observed facts to memory and stored them in the relevant sections of his Mind Palace.
Sherlock was still on the sofa, dozing, drifting in and out of the dream version of his Mind Palace, and John was pottering about in the kitchen, preparing dinner, when the sound of John’s phone rang through the flat. Sherlock gradually opened his eyes to see John raise his eyebrows at the screen. “It’s the earl.” John picked up in speaker mode, holding the mobile in front of him so that Sherlock could hear.
As he let the water spiral down the drain, he thought about Harry and her life back in Russia. About the good work she was trying to do, in spite of the dangers – especially seeing as she was just a foreigner there. In some strange way, it was a bit comparable to his mission in Afghanistan. Bringing tolerance and justice where it was lacking. And now they were both in a same-sex relationship with a mad chemist.
must be ended, please remember where you’re standing, because ... you’re standing exactly where I said you would be two weeks ago.”
Suddenly, the lump in John’s throat had taken on an entirely different nature. He managed a wet smile as he huffed out an awed, melodious, “Oh
His Mind Palace was a chaotic mess, though, and wasn’t providing any answers. But he was on to something. He just knew it. That tingly sensation of having found a loose thread in the world. Sherlock was intent on seeing where it led. All he needed to do was to get a proper hold of it, and pull.
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock sighed. “I gather that word has reached you we’ve completed Moran’s little treasure hunt and you’re calling to congratulate us, no doubt?”
“I did no such thing, don’t worry,” Sherlock replied smoothly. Then, turning his attention back to Violet, “The main thing is that
“Hello there,” John said to the criminal, his voice a sea of calm. “Now where did you think you were going with that rucksack?”
“Oh, wonderfully well, actually.” Mycroft smiled a weary version of his usual self-satisfied smile. “They seem to genuinely
at not even having shed a tear over his aunt. His amazing, wonderful aunt, who had given her freedom during the last months of her life for John, by taking the blame for something he had done,
“Well, let’s see, shall we?” Keeping his eyes fixed on Smith, Sherlock raised his voice and called over his shoulder towards the doors, “Faith, stop loitering at the door and come in! This is your father’s
Naturally, Sherlock was nowhere near interested in any of the scenarios John had let himself fantasise about in the still hours of the night. John had never
He fell back against the mattress and revelled in the prospect of an entire Saturday with John, and no plans other than a fancy dinner date tonight.
when he found out someone had nicked his entire draft manuscript. And I couldn’t believe my ears when I heard
The second time Sherlock sucked John off, he had lasted a bit longer and Sherlock had been able to at least practice this new skill a little.
He sat down in his desk chair, leaning back and intertwining his fingers, and looked at John intently.
Sherlock and John looked at each other, and instantly both knew there was no reason to quickly sit up and pretend they hadn’t been snuggling. They yelled ‘yes!’ before unhurriedly starting to disentangle their limbs.
.” Upon which Sherlock impersonated Lestrade’s wide-eyed and open-mouthed look of horror, one eyebrow raised slightly above the other. “Priceless,” he smiled. “Well, of course he caught the real culprit anyway in the end. Or rather, you did.”
Sherlock decided this was his moment. “Good morrrrrning, you hard-working men! Having trouble with the machinery, eh? I’ll tell you where you can find all the rings and various types of oil your hearts might desire. There’s a shop not ten miles from here. Cartman’s.” He’d seen it from the train, and it had looked like one of those shops that sold absolutely anything a handyman could ask for.
“Will you please not do that anymore, Sherlock? You almost did get yourself killed.” John clenched his jaw, visibly struggling with what to say next. “You know how well I handled the last time I thought you were dead. I married an evil assassin. So please stay safe, yeah?”
Sherlock didn’t move for a long while after that and just stood there vacantly watching the closed door. Even though his entire being was reeling, still trying to process the new situation, at the same time the excitement that was thrumming in his veins made him feel happier than he could remember ever having been.
Smith snorted quietly. He seemed about to walk away, but then took a couple of steps back towards John, looking angrily at him. “Are you... are you
He should probably shut up now, but his speech centre seems to have detached from the rest of his brain and developed a mind of its own. Also, he is angry and frustrated, which leads to him not caring very much. “Dear God above,” he grouses aloud. “Just a freaking blowjob, is that too much to ask? Apparently, yes.”
“That was...” Sherlock couldn’t quite find either the words or the energy to utter them, and just settled for a heavenly smile that came completely natural in the moment and that he was sure would convey the same meaning.
, alright?” John said, softly. “I understand. He shouldn’t have told them.” He looked Sherlock in the eye, making sure he was listening. “But what you said was out of line. You do realise that, don’t you?”
"There is a woman coming down the street, looking closely at the house numbers.  She is evidently searching for an address and I believe it may be ours," I replied.
"I know it, Mr Holmes" she replied, "but I wanted to make you think a bit.  What you did  -  it wasn't right.   And you know the worst of it?  You never gave it another thought.  You got what you wanted, and Milverton's gone, and justice was served and that, but you never thought of what would happen to me, or Tom, or any of us, not one bit.  We're not like some characters in one of Dr Watson's stories.  We're real people and you would have ruined our lives without even blinking if I hadn't found those tenners."  She rose from her seat and stood, hands on her hips, facing Holmes fiercely.  "Well, haven't you got something to say to me?   Don't you owe me something?"
When we arrived, the constable was continuing to shake the child, while he prodded a large bag on the step with his foot. From the bag, a low, menacing rumble emerged.
"I don't understand all of this.  You say you're dating him for the case, but then you go and do thoughtful things like this for him," John said.
"Honestly, I don't know where your head was just then," Sherlock said.  It looked pathetic how he was acting.
John entered the room and went to grab his laptop.  Next to it was a little black box.  Curious, John picked it up and revealed a shiny gold ring.  What.  The.  Actual.  Hell.
"It's not rude to point out the truth," Eric said, matching the smile that mused on Sherlock's face.
"No.  The shirt," John said irritated.  He turned back to focus on his coffee, not wanting to look at the cursed image anymore.  Coffee.  He needed coffee with tons of cream and sugar to sweeten up this bitter morning.
It had been three months.  Three solid months since that tragic event.  Mary had once again betrayed John's trust for the second time.  She knew how difficult it was to obtain John's trust and yet she still abused the privilege.  And now it had been three months since Mary and John divorced.  It has been three months since John has officially moved back to 221B Baker Street, since he couldn't afford a house by himself.  Even Sherlock didn't know the real reason why John and Mary divorced.  But he was too happy to have his friend back to really care or bother to ask.  Their conversation was quite brief about the matter.  John had met with Sherlock for coffee when he blatantly said "Mary and I are getting divorced.  Can I move back in with you?" and that was how he was back.  How the duo was back.
She cut him off, furious tears in her eyes.  "Don't you dare say it Mr Holmes!  Don't you offer me money!  It ain't money I want from you!"
We left the children in her capable hands and went upstairs, with Oliver twining about Holmes's legs, as he half-heartedly tried to shoo him off. Shutting the door firmly behind us when we got to the top, he collapsed into his chair before the fire. "I declare, Watson," he groaned, "chasing criminals across half of London is not half so fatiguing as dealing with children - and that dratted cat! - for two hours!"
"If you'd stop shaking him, he could probably tell us," I interposed, crouching down to bring myself to the child's level, although this move placed me in an uncomfortable proximity to the bag, which continued to rumble alarmingly.
He put his fingers to his lips and whistled shrilly. Within seconds another boy came running up from where he was sweeping the street. "Did you see the child and the cat?" Holmes asked.
As the dreary morning wore on, I began to question whether I had not after all, better gone with Holmes. Word had come that all was well with my patient, I had spent the last four holiday seasons without Holmes, the last two completely alone, as my dear Mary had died in that black time just before Christmas in the second year of Holmes's absence. Now that he had returned, as it were from the dead, I had looked forward to spending the New Year with my friend who had so recently become my lover as well.
“Wait a minute, you don’t happen to mean Bob Carruthers and Jack Woodley, do you?” the goldsmith exclaimed.
“To be fair,” Sherlock said softly, “it does feel like I had to wait 129 years to be where I am now, together with you, surrounded by my loved ones.” He had really only been talking to John, but everyone had suddenly fallen silent and seemed to have their full attention on him.
“I was still contemplating my answer to him,” Sherlock continued pleasantly. “Although, quite possibly, that is now no longer necessary.”
He quietly went to the bedroom, where John was having another rest. Sherlock stood in front of his disguise wardrobe – containing a large and varied collection of stuff from all sorts of charity shops – and tried to choose an appropriate outfit for someone of his age illegally putting up posters around the city. He picked a checked shirt that was too big and a pair of red jeans that had seen better days. Then he took out a wig with short, spikey, white-blond hair, holding it all in front of him as he looked in the mirror.
And why was his prick suddenly displaying an opinion, for fuck’s sake? God, this couldn’t get any worse, could it?
“Listen, er, Sherlock. I have an apology to make as well. I’m sorry I pushed you against the cabinets in the morgue and didn’t catch you when you fell. I should have been more careful. Should have realised exactly what state you were in. I’m
They had just been about to head for bed – and soon did so, after handing her some blankets and a pillow.
Once on the landing, he knocked, momentarily wondering whether they would be able to hear him above all the scraping of furniture legs, but he quickly heard Sherlock cry a loud “Yes!”, surprisingly followed by a second “yes!” as Greg was already in the process of opening the door – which he briefly found strange, but didn’t give too much thought to in that moment.
Also, he seemed so calm and composed, that John had a hard time imagining he had killed a dog and several people, and almost did the same thing to his very own little brother. But then again, that was the case with so many murderers. He’d seen it often enough in the investigations they’d helped Greg with. Nobody was mean and vicious all the time. Legend had it even Hitler had been lovely with his dogs, after all.
“Well, I finally came to my senses. Not being in a relationship with you was actually more distracting than the alternative. All I had to make sure was whether you could be interested in sex with a man. I wasn’t sure you were.”
As the afternoon light sifted through the curtains, which moved slightly in the spring breeze, Sherlock pressed one last kiss to John’s forehead before closing his eyes, a smile firmly plastered to his face.
“Christ, Sherlock, you are the best thing that ever happened to me,” he whispered urgently. “And that was before tonight. Now... you’re just off the scale. Oh
, he had no idea what had gotten into Sherlock. Why he’d gone back on drugs, why he’d gone after Culverton bloody Smith
“Babies love hearing melodies and they love hearing your voice,” she had explained. “Especially when they can’t sleep, nothing is more soothing than the combination of the two.”
They drank tea and talked for over an hour: Mycroft telling Sherlock about how he was always worried sick about his little, frail brother, who had – as they’d thought at the time – survived a murderous attack by a sibling only to get picked on by his peers for being different all the time. How he’d wanted to help him, be there for him in ways his parents should have but weren’t; explain the world to him, so he would understand people better and be less vulnerable.
“This dog doesn’t do much, does it?” Mary had said, ten minutes later. “He reminds me of you, John. Lazy and incapable, ha-ha! Not that you’re that much better, mind, Sherlock, but at least you’re good at pretending otherwise, right?” She had obviously thought this a very funny joke and had actually
John took in a long breath. “Well, I guess that’s one way to put it.” He absently rubbed the back of his neck. “The thing is, we’re just really different. You would expect two siblings who grew up with the same pair of parents to have some common ground. But sadly, we don’t. Everything one of us says or does, seems to come across completely differently to the other one from how it was intended. Basically, we just annoy the shit out of each other.”
. Having continuous hesitations as to whether John might perhaps feel the same or not; whether he should tell him how he felt or not.
Unsure of what to do next, exactly, John hesitantly gets to his feet, a giant smile threatening to burst through from just below the surface of him.
Well, her goal was pretty much achieved anyway, as Sherlock would probably be miserable for the rest of his sorry life now, which had kind of been the idea.
“Mister Holmes, I’m afraid it’s not a terribly exciting matter that I’ve come to see you about,” she said apologetically. “All I need is for someone to trace the identity of this bloke that keeps following me around, so I can report him to the police. They’re not willing to help me as it is, because they think my story is too vague and doesn’t seem
“Oh yes, no problem at all,” the man replied, and hurried away to get it from the tap in the work area.
Sherlock looked at John again and at the swelling slowly coming up below the red spot on his forehead.
“Exactly, yeah,” John said, now showing a noticeable spark of enthusiasm himself. “It’s all about consequences, isn’t it. That’s one of the great challenges in writing fiction, I think. To figure out how certain events make people feel, how they are affected by them in the long term.” He nodded, pressing his lips together. “It’s somehow always easier to see such things more clearly when it’s about someone else, weirdly, even if they’re fictional.” He looked pensive for a moment. “Someway, it still manages to teach you something about yourself and your own life.”
Sherlock gave a relieved huff, looking at John with an eager expression, as if he had just conducted an especially successful experiment. Who knew, maybe that was what this was to him. At least this was the kind of adventurousness John would not soon complain about.
John had looked around the strange space they were in, a corridor only just wide enough for Sherlock’s wheelchair, which Sherlock was now carefully parking at the far end. He’d had no idea what this was all about.
When Sherlock eventually pulled back, his face remained close to John’s, hovering above him as their eyes locked. John had drowned in Sherlock’s gaze so often in the past, not capable of reading his intentions, yet unable to look away. It had always felt like they stared straight into one another’s soul, without fully understanding what they saw there, but still being captivated and mesmerised by each other’s hidden depths. But now, John knew exactly what it was he saw in Sherlock’s eyes. And he knew that Sherlock could finally, flawlessly read him as well.
“Not just yet,” Sherlock replied. “Well, save for the odd, forthright armchair case. We’re mainly studying sign language at the moment. For my brother.”
“Mr Holmes?” an approaching woman said. “Culverton wants to know if you’re okay going straight to the hospital.”
“Oh, is there one over there as well?” said Mr Holmes. “Marvellous. That’s settled, then.” Then, to Rosie, “You’re going to get your own little bed up here, how about that?”
It was Ophelia Number Three – the timid one who’d forgotten her lines. “Hi. Sorry. Jenny Brown. I messed up just now and would very much like to have another go. I had a black-out, that’s all.”
“But then there was this woman flirting with me… She never even told me her name. We texted constantly, whenever Mary left the room to feed Rosie. That’s all it was, just texting.”
“Bugger this,” John said. “You know what? I’m not ready to give up. Exercise is supposed to be good for me, you know. And I really like finally being out again.
Once everything was sorted, and she’d managed to soak her garments in the wash basin upstairs without waking Rosie, she went straight back to the bathroom to stash a stock of pads there.
Mycroft pinched his lips together as he raised his eyebrows, staring into nothingness. “I don’t know.”
Sherlock made an effort to switch off the part of his brain that facilitated emotions and to focus entirely on the facts of the puzzle at hand.
“Ah well, once I realised that the shorter corridor on this floor indicated the presence of a hidden room, added to the fact that you are familiar with building work yourself, I figured you’d have found this the ideal place to hide the boy, since you could easily bring food and water to him unnoticed.”
When he walked up the driveway of Holdernesse Hall the next morning, wearing his suit again (slightly sweaty from the clammy train journey), Sherlock casually greeted the workmen that he’d interacted so elaborately with the previous day when he’d been in disguise. Of course, none of them suspected he was the same man. Meanwhile, Sherlock’s eyes scanned the grounds and anything that moved on them. There seemed to be one builder less than before. After a simple process of elimination, Sherlock realised that the one that had been coughing so loudly was nowhere to be seen. The older maid crossed his path and nodded curtly. The door was opened again by Amy, who, once more, appeared to avoid eye contact at all costs, and who silently disappeared the minute she’d shown him to the earl’s study.
Sherlock quickly turned out to be right in thinking these workmen weren’t locals. They seemed glad with the information. While they mumbled their thanks and continued debating whether they needed just the ring, just the oil, or both, and who was going to get it, Sherlock noticed something from the corner of his eye. The handsome fellow he’d chatted with on Wednesday – James, was it? – was tucking away something that looked like an old handkerchief. It took Sherlock a second to realise what had been special about the antique-looking piece of cloth. It had the Holdernesse coat of arms on it: the exact same three bears that could be seen carved into stone above the main entrance of the Hall.
The earl looked at Sherlock with open mouth, his arms still around his son. “You deduced all this from his handkerchief?”
He took a deep breath. “Mary used to be part of a group of four secret agents, who all carried memory sticks with their initials on it, A.G.R.A., containing the data about all of each other’s secret identities. They kept those as a kind of insurance for themselves. Then, six years ago, one of their missions went wrong. In Tbilisi, Georgia. They were meant to free a group of hostages at the British embassy, but someone had betrayed them and the rebels knew they were coming. Mary got away but thought that all of the others had died. Last month, when I ambushed the man smashing all the Thatcher busts, I found out that he was one of Mary’s team, and was looking for his A.G.R.A. stick, which he’d hidden in a drying clay bust of Margaret Thatcher while on the run.”
Then he thought of the woman pretending to be Faith, carrying around a gun and emulating the real Faith’s northern accent quite accurately. A master trickster, much like Jim had been. Great acting talent.
Sherlock and John looked at each other, and instantly both knew there was no reason to quickly sit up and pretend they hadn’t been snuggling. They yelled ‘yes!’ before unhurriedly starting to disentangle their limbs.
“Huh,” John huffed. “Probably just boys playing some prank on each other then, trying to break into one another’s dorm.”
The room started to fade a bit and the skin in his face was tingling unpleasantly. Sherlock tried to focus on breathing normally, but didn’t even seem to manage this simplest of tasks.
It was a consolation at least that a quarter of Rosie’s genes came from his mum. His wonderful, incredibly strong mum, who’d always been there for him, until the day she died – much too early. If only Dad hadn’t been so excessively drunk on that particular day, when there’d been so much dirty laundry from the school trip that she’d had to keep climbing up and down the stairs to hang it all to dry. It had all been a matter of chance, really. As was true for any accident, he supposed.
He’d let him down so often in real life. Even though he’d told himself he’d never ever lie to John again, John naturally still hadn’t forgiven him for all his previous lies in the past. And on top of that, Sherlock realised, he had not even kept his promise. He’d never told John about Sherrinford.
Sherlock pressed his lips together in a smile. He put away the dildo and took the lube, applying an ample amount to John’s length, meanwhile stroking away some of his tension.
“This is probably an inappropriate thing to say to someone who was once best man at my wedding,” John began, smiling nervously. He looked at the tiny legs of the giant beetle that Sherlock was lifting in mid-air with his forceps, and felt a bit like the specimen, heading for an uncertain destination.
About an hour after the first guests had arrived, when everyone was there and had been provided with drinks, Sherlock suddenly noticed two things.
John smiled, biting his lip. Boy, was he glad for the liberating effect of alcohol. “I just can’t believe this is really happening, you and me.” He nuzzled Sherlock’s jaw, adding in a whisper, “I want you so badly, you have no idea.”
John’s gaze shifted towards the fireplace, eyes unfocused, and he pulled in a breath. Then he took another two steps in Sherlock’s direction. “Sherlock, there’s something I need to get off my chest.” He swallowed visibly. “I’m not the man you thought I was. I’m not brave or valiant. And my moral compass is... not as strong as you seem to think it is.”
“I’d rather not,” John replied curtly, but managing to say it in a pleasant enough way. He calmly blew over his cup.
Hell turned out to be a lovely little place on the southern coast of a river mouth lined with deciduous forests. The sun was only partly visible behind the mostly overcast sky, not dissimilar to the day Rosamund had been in the area, six months ago.
Mycroft wasn’t half as deprecating as usual and even flashed a genuine smile at Sherlock when he gave his view on the matter.
Sherlock felt his stomach turn to solid rock. Was John disappointed in him for his lack of experience? But he could learn, surely? He wanted this,
Although it quickly became very obvious that Sherlock hadn’t kissed anyone in a while, it was also very clear that he really, desperately wanted this. He had grabbed John’s waist so tightly as if he were afraid John might otherwise turn and try to walk away again.
“You know, dear brother,” Mycroft said, signing along so Sherrinford could also understand, “this really makes you and John a proper family now: having a kid and a dog. Couldn’t get more domestic than that. I’d honestly never taken you for the type.”
It was naturally still rather scary for Sherrinford to visit public places, after not having been allowed to for most of his life. Everything was new and strange.
“I love you too,” Sherlock whispered back, still a little awkward, but very cute awkward, John thought.
“Alright.” John swallowed, not sure what to think. He watched as Sherlock took a tube of lubricant from inside the bedside table and smeared some of it onto his fingers. After stuffing a cushion under his bum with his other hand, Sherlock pulled up his knees, letting his legs fall open, and just like that, started circling his arse with his wet middle finger.
Since the task did not seem to call for a great amount of brainpower, it didn’t bother John that Sherlock continued doing this while John was talking to him.
It was a dreary morning in late December when I was awoken from a half doze by a commotion on the step outside. It was a few days after Christmas and I was looking forward to spending another quiet day with Holmes. For once, no geese stuffed with enormous jewels had appeared on the sideboard and no dignified schoolmasters had pitched headlong on the hearth rug. Mrs Hudson had returned yesterday from spending the holiday at her sister's, after arranging for a delicious feast for us with Mrs Baxter down the street. In return, I had bullied Holmes into already tidying up our rooms and we had put away the Christmas decorations, although I had secreted a sprig of mistletoe away for possible future use.
Holmes and I exchanged glances over Billy's head during this recital. "How old are you now, Billy?" I asked.
She pulled a paper out of her reticule and tossed it on the table, where it narrowly missed the butter dish and landed face up.  It proved to be the title page of a story entitled 'Seduced and Abandoned - The Chambermaid's Tale', complete with a crudely drawn illustration of a woman who faintly resembled Agatha, in an advanced state of dishabille, who, with her eyes rolled to Heaven, was vigorously repulsing the advances of a tall, thin man with a pronounced leer, and a general resemblance to Holmes!
Holmes gave one of his tremendous stretches - he rather reminded me of a cat himself when he did so - and gave me a suggestive smile. " I think I'll turn in, old boy. Coming?"
Cautiously, we slipped inside the stable. "I ain't seen no one anywheres around when I was 'ere before," said Squeaker, leading the way to where a horse in a spacious loose-box was vigorously banging his empty water-bucket.
As we turned to go, however, I was quite certain I saw him drop his hand to Oliver's head in a brief caress.
"And well you may ask." she said.  "I can read, you know.  I saw Doctor Watson's story in the Strand magazine after Tom said to me 'Here, Aggie, ain't that your plumber fellow?'  I knew at once, in spite of those changes he made.  I never thought that the high-and-mighty detective Mr Sherlock Holmes and my Escott were one and the same until then.  I have to hand it to you, Mr Holmes, you do know how to lead a girl on!"
Holmes pinched the bridge of his nose. "Constable" he said wearily, "does it seem likely to you that the lad was trying to steal the brass when he was making so much racket? Doesn't it seem much more likely that he was trying to reach the knocker to actually use it?"
"I'm not sorry old Milverton's gone either," she continued.  "He was a nasty bit of work and no mistake.  But I was just lucky I found that dosh and after the house was closed up and we was all turned out, I got to thinkin' and I went and found my Tom and told him what had happened and we made it up, right as rain, in spite of my bein' temporarily led astray by you, Mr Holmes.   If  I hadn't kept them tenners, Tom and me would be out on the street, like all the others.  As it is, well," she smiled triumphantly.  "We was married last month and it so happens I got prospects."
"So much for our quiet Christmas season," I said with a chuckle, "I think perhaps you may need to get used to the children. They seem quite determined to attach themselves to the household and I'm sure they will be very useful. They are both bright youngsters. I have no doubt that we can manage to see to their schooling and help with their upkeep. As for Oliver, there have been mice in the walls ever since Mrs Hudson's Tabby passed away. Let us hope that he lives up to his fearsome reputation."
Her mouth set in a hard line.  "No," she agreed, "but I had my hopes.  And you put paid to that, didn't you?  Besides, Mr Smithers said it added interest to the story.  Maid-of-all-work didn't have quite the same ring to it. 'High jinks in high life' he said, 'that's just the ticket!'"
Rolling up my sleeves, I set to work. By rights, I should have been called in much earlier, but I knew they had put it off as long as possible, hoping to save on the fee.
Some time later, I awoke with a start just in time to see Sherlock Holmes swirl into the room, discarding his wet jacket as he came in.
Here Mrs Hudson interposed. "Constable, put that child down immediately!" she said sternly. "Can't you see you're hurting him?" Abashed, the constable set the child on his feet, but retained a firm hold on his arm.
The child went on bravely, though her lip trembled. "Ma died, and then the baby, and Dad left. Polly married Tom, the cats' meat man, and they took us, but Polly's expectin' and Tom said 'e couldn't keep us no more, with a family of their own on the way, so Polly give Billy a sixpence and said to find you, Dr Watson, and maybe Ol' L-." she paused, bit her lip and went on "Mrs "Udson'd have work for us, now that I'm more grown up. And Oliver's ever so good at mousin' - even catches rats, 'e does. But it's a long walk over 'ere and we was tired and fell asleep, and the next thing I knew a copper 'ad ahold of Billy and 'e said to find you, and I grabbed Oliver and ran, and 'ere I am!"
"Well, surely we can find something for you to do," I replied, catching Holmes's eye with a tiny shake of my head.
We hastened down the stairs where Holmes, as usual, was able to secure a cab immediately. As we rattled off towards the East, I asked how he had managed to narrow down the list of possible destinations so quickly. "A simple calculation of how far it was likely two small children burdened with some amount of baggage would have been able to walk before succumbing to weariness, then estimating how far Neddie could have run, clutching the bag with that dratted cat, who is no insignificant weight, judging by the brief glimpse I had of him."
Back at home, we were treated to the sight of Billy opening the door for us, dressed in one of Holmes's second-best shirts, chattering excitedly about cocoa and bread "an' butter, too". There was some for Squeaker also and Neddie as well, as soon as I had made certain that she was not concussed and would be fine after a meal and some sleep. "But she will have to clean up first," Mrs Hudson said determinedly. "I'll not have her eating at my table as dirty as that. I'll send the maid up with tea for you gentlemen in a few minutes."
She cut him off.  "oh, so it's 'Agatha' now, is it?  You were free enough with 'Aggie, this' an' 'Aggie that'  back then,  It was all 'c'mon over here, Aggie, give us a cuddle' then."
As we started back for Baker Street, with a wide-eyed Billy in the cab between us, I asked him how things had come to such a pass. After repeating substantially what Neddie had already told us, with embellishments, "Tom's not a bad sort, always 'ad a bit for Oliver." He confirmed why they had left. "Polly didn't want us to go to work in a factory, even though we're old enough, so she give us a shillin' from her washin' money and told us to go find you, that maybe you could find us some work, so we set off. Tom won't be 'alf mad when he finds out what she done, neither."
Mycroft visits every few weeks or so, and John will at least attempt to hold stilted, awkward conversation with him. Mycroft is also grieving the loss of his nephew, but Sherlock sees him deal with it the only way he knows how: by throwing himself even more vehemently into work. He occasionally lets slip updates on the situation with Moriarty and Moran, and it takes every ounce of resilience Sherlock has not to grab Mycroft by the lapels and demand he tell him everything. Ignorance is his penance.
alone in this ‘pointless waste of a world’?’ John breathes, dangerously, ‘You selfish, fucking prick.’
Mycroft is no fool, and knows that Sherlock knows something is up, but in true big brother style, he does not make things easy on his little brother. He volleys back his own cutting remark about Sherlock’s choice of clothing (pyjamas and a dressing gown, despite the late hour), the state of the kitchen (every conceivable surface covered in various attempts at finding a hobby to fill the void left by the absence of Hamish and the Work), and only when he goes on to comment on how very aged Sherlock looks do the lines around the corners of his eyes deepen, and his jaw clenches infinitesimally as he struggles to keep the expression on his face reflecting condescension rather than concern.
"No, he was being rude.  You don't tell someone that based off of their diet and jacket, you can tell that their daughter is obese," John said as he walked up to Sherlock's side and gave Sherlock a look of disapproval.  Sherlock didn't pay any mind.
"Are you going to tell me what that was about, or am I supposed to deduce it?" Sherlock asked, shooting John a dirty look.  John didn't feel remorse in the slightest.
John had managed not to look below Eric's waist and was relieved to know that he wasn't stark naked in his kitchen.  But worrisome thoughts started to piece together in his mind.  If Eric was wearing Sherlock's shirt, then did that mean they had slept together last night?  And now, Eric was basking in the musk of Sherlock's sweat and tears.  John didn't know whether to be more upset by the thought that they had done it when he was still in the flat or be concerned that they had physical relations like that at all.
“Sherlock what the hell are we doing here?!  This is a school!  There aren’t any murders at a school Sherlock!”  John was pissed.  He had been wasting time only to find out he was supposed to be investigating a school.  That seemed ridiculous.
"Morning," Eric said from the table.  John hadn't even noticed the bloke was there.  Surprised, he turned back from the machine to see something that caught him off guard again.  Eric was wearing a shirt that John recognized.  It was an eggplant shaded dress shirt, unbuttoned completely and loosely hanging on the sides, exposing his perfectly waxed chest and abs.  Screw him.
"Look at the blood pattern on the shirt.  There's seeping around the collar and dripping down the front of the shirt.  That suggests the person's throat was slashed when they were standing up.  If it had been when they were laying down, gravity wouldn't have pulled it so low to the shirt.  It's evident this person wasn't injured below the neck because there aren't any holes in the jumper," Eric said as if it were the most simplest explanation.
John felt his heart drop to the pit of his stomach.  Sherlock never gave him a gift, not even for Christmas.  In fact, John remembered when he gave Sherlock a gift, and the git tossed it aside.
John scowled and squinted at the size tag inside the jumper.  It was rather large for a female's Medium.
That would show Eric.  Sherlock had never done such a romantic gesture like saving Eric from a fire.  That was how real relationships happened.  You do anything to protect the one you care for.  Didn't Sherlock know that?  Perhaps, Sherlock couldn't see that he was in love too.  Or he really was just married to his work.
A skinny old woman walked down the hallway wearing a long dark blue dress.  She smiled at the couple and opened her arms.
“This would be a learning experience for them!  I have always wanted a same sex relationship and I believe you two could show the class how easy it is to perform it”  Sherlock couldn’t argue with that.  He stood up and walked to the stage.  John almost protested but instead followed.  They stood up there awkwardly looking at everyone in the class.
"I knew you'd pick that up, considering you're a model too," Sherlock said, looking over at Eric with a short smile on his face.
“It’s not my fault I’m gay! You have no idea how hard it is.  When everyone is telling you you’re going to hell for something you can’t control!  You would never understand!” he cried out.  The police came inside the room and took the kid away.
"I almost put it on before he told me not to.  He said he didn't want me reminding him of his brother," Eric said.  John looked away and took a sip of his coffee, forgetting it was hot and hissed in pain at the scourging of his tongue.  He smiled through the pain.
"Fire exposes our priorities," Sherlock said lowly, turning to gaze around at the surrounding people.  He was still interested in the world around him, even if he had to convince Eric that he was head over heels for him.
John came back to the foyer to hang his jacket up.  As he traveled around the flat, he noticed a peculiar scene.  There were blue, green, and yellow balloons sprinkled around the living space.  Sky blue streamers were sprawled over the furniture and strung from the ceiling.  A table that was usually placed across from the chairs was seated on the sidelines.  Accompanied was another table full of snacks and plastic plates and silverware.
‘That doesn’t mean I don’t still love you,’ John repeats carefully, ‘And it certainly doesn’t mean that I don’t want you alive, or with me. I… Sherlock, these last six months have destroyed me. It’s like screaming into the void every moment, and no one can hear me, and I can’t seem to find a way out. I’ve never felt anything close to this level of all-consuming anguish. But… It was never about you, and I shouldn’t have said it was,’ he takes a deep breath, ‘You are still… You are still the best man, and most… Human human being that I’ve ever known. And I love you so much. So please… Just stop it. Stop this now, and let’s figure out another plan. Together.’
For the last week, Mycroft had people working literally around the clock to make a large enough, fast enough space station. It’s schematics and physics that would never work for sustainable space travel, but luckily, this trip is not meant to be sustainable. It’s a one-man one-way journey.
‘He was the one who found young Hamish,’ the cashier at the grocery store whispers one day  across the aisle to a pair of old women doing their shopping, ‘Held the boy in his arms as he bled out on the pavement. My cousin Billy lives in London, and was there that night. Says he’s never heard a more wretched animal cry than what came outta Dr Watson that night, the poor bloke.’
, Sherlock thinks, and texts John to come at once, if or if not convenient, because if not now, then when.
He told John once that he sometimes went days without speaking, and John said it wouldn’t bother him. He thinks that maybe John should have asked him if it would bother him if John went suddenly mute, but he knows nothing could have prepared him for this.
More words, a few songs, and then it is over. The mourners depart, and John is left, holding Rosie to his chest. Lestrade nods at him, Mrs Hudson tearfully gives him space, and then he is alone, faced with the hard black granite headstone for a second time. He wonders briefly if they managed to changed the year of death, or if this is a new, but identical grave marker.
He is yelling somehow, and his hands are shaking. His whole body is shaking, and it’s like being on cocaine all over again. His skin is covering live wires; sparking and shocking and burning up. He still can’t tell if it is anger or fear that is coming off him in waves, but it’s enough to make his knees go weak as his heart ricochets off his rib cage.
It’s the second time John has buried Sherlock, and the coffin is just as empty as it was the first time, but now there is no hope that Sherlock might have fucked off to adventures unknown to play the hero. There is evidence, in the way of transmissions, up until the moment of impact. This time, there will be no miracle resurrection.
, then, is it… He’s back,’ he asks, but his tone does not turn up at the end of the statement, instead staying flat, even.
John runs outside, and looks up to see a faint cloud of some sort of dust or smoke far up in the sky. It’s just the tiniest pinprick of destruction; but somehow the impact resonates like a sound wave. He frowns in confusion, not quite sure what it is he just witnessed. It’s then that his mobile rings.
They stand there, the sun setting outside their kitchen window, bathing the room in red-orange light.
The elusive new tenants must have arrived sometime later that night, under the cover of darkness, because after that, it is as though they have always been there. It becomes so common to see the dark figure of Sherlock Holmes perched unmoving, and expressionless on the wooden bench overlooking the garden, that even the nosiest passerby stops mentioning it over morning tea. After a few weeks, he begins attending mass at the local chapel, always sitting closest to the door, and never speaking to anyone. It is only out of the corner of an especially keen eye that his look of pure anguish can be spotted — to the rest of the world, everything about him remains set in stone.
, Mycroft,’ Sherlock snaps, ‘The message is that if I do not re-engage with him, he will get to John, because he has
‘You should receive a letter requesting your presence at the trial as a key witness the day after next,’ Mycroft answers, ‘I wanted to give you advanced notice in case John were to-’
The thing about living in a small town is that even non-events somehow seem like big events, because even the slightest break in the monotony is a distraction, so needless to say, when the famous detective from London moves into the old Wilmington Place at the edge of town with his husband (! Of all things!), it causes nothing short of an uproar. Even the sleepiest country bumpkin has at least heard of Sherlock Holmes, even if they don’t realise that the reason they knew his name was because of his blogger and ‘homosexual life partner’, Dr Watson. They know he’s had some recent trouble with the law, and that he’d been called into a big fancy trial as a star witness when that madman had called him out personally. And, more recently, they know that he’s suffered an unimaginable loss when his adoptive son had been brutally murdered trying to clear his name.
,’ he says with a bit of a swagger, ‘Have never done a damn thing worth doing. I solve the murders of the dead, Mycroft. John Watson saves the lives of the living. Who do you think has a bigger impact?’
, Sherlock thinks as he pushes John back, and sinks to his knees, keeping his eyes fixed on John as he takes him in his mouth, and
It’s a week and a day till impact, and Sherlock has been vetted, trained, and analysed six ways from Sunday to make sure he is mentally and physically fit enough for this mission. After Serbia, what the hell else matters.
‘There has been a new development in regards to James Moriarty,’ he states with forced calm, ‘Mr Moriarty has…
Sherlock sifts through Mycroft’s drawers, and finds scraps of encoded notes that shows John is at the top of his shortlist of people with military background, strong moral character, and the aptitude to grasp a flight system in a very short amount of time. Mycroft needs someone he believes could both successfully complete the mission, and keep it secret from the general public to prevent mass panic. Sherlock sees his point, but
Six months, nearly to the day after Hamish is killed, Mycroft shows up for one of these perfunctory visits, but even as his car turns into the drive, Sherlock can tell that something is different this time. The driver’s anxiety is nearly palpable when he goes ‘round the town car to let Mycroft out the back. Mycroft’s stride, though still measured and unhurried, had just the faintest trace of a wobble on the left step when his foot left the pavement.
