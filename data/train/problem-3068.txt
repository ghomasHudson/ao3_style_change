“Outside. Now. All three of you.” Castiel grunted, his eyes flashing blue for a moment. Dean gulped. The expression Castiel gave them was one he truly feared. Castiel was pissed. And Dean didn’t want to be on the receiving end of it. Ever.
Warning!! Please, everyone who is reading this! I have some spoilery warnings. This chapter features suicide ideology. Please tread carefully. Know that suicide is never a solution. It's an escape. Things do get better.
Dean, very confused and slightly nervous by his discovery, slowly closed the door and then turned towards the crime scene. When he walked in, he immediately winced. The victim was a young woman, looked to be about in her mid thirties. Features were very prominent, looking to be norse in origin. Much like how Spencer looked. Dean took that particular observation and kept it in the back of his mind, just in case.
Once semi satisfied with how he looked, he ran a hand through his hair and stepped right back out onto the street. The houses were all unique. None were the same. Perfect for Cas, Dean thought. Dean pushed the thought away and shoved down the tears and the sharp pain of regret that threatened to bubble over. He could cry later. In his sleep. Like he always does.
Castiel found himself blushing as he answered Dean’s question. Castiel ran a hand through his hair, pushing some of the stray hairs back. “Spencer and I met in the bookstore in town. He smelled awful, at least, that’s what everyone around him said.” Castiel chuckled. “So I recommended him one of the old cologne brands you used to use. He thanked me, and bought me the books I was carrying.” Castiel blushes again, sending a jab of hurt into Dean’s chest.
Dean’s face shifts into one of confusion and thought. “Huh, you think it was one of those like… Jefferson Starships or somethin?” he asks, shrugging his shoulders. Sam shrugs back at him, just as confused.
Castiel sighed, still not answering Dean. Dean shook his head, taking Castiel’s silence as his answer. “Fine. Have it your way.” Dean snapped, before he stormed off to get changed out of his wet clothes. Castiel was left standing in the middle of the living room, feeling guilty and forlorn for what he’d lost.
Once he got into the Impala, and closed the door to make sure no one heard him, or saw him, Dean finally let the floodgates open. And he cried.
Dean grumbled as he rubbed his eyes free from sleep, ignoring the obvious wet spot where it was clear he’d been crying in his sleep again. He’s gotta stop doing that, he thinks as he rubs the evidence away too. Every night Dean’s been hoping he won’t wake up. That this day would be his last to suffer through the pain he’s been obviously hiding behind an impenetrable wall that keeps getting taller and taller. That he won’t have to go out and pretend to be okay. When he knows it’s obvious he’s not. The scattered bottles of empty liquor around his room is enough proof of that on it’s own.
Dean hummed, his mind still not remembering the one, fragile detail of the entire situation. He nodded, frowning a bit as he pouted. He was still in his haze of the after sex. Castiel chuckled and kissed his forehead. “I… I love you too Cas..” Dean murmurs tiredly. Castiel snickered again and turned around, making his way to the front door and leaving.
Sam again widens his eyes at Castiel’s words, furrowing his eyebrows and looking at Dean in surprise. Spencer rolls his eyes again at Castiel, clearly not in the mood to argue. Dean forced back a growl. This guy had to be patient with Cas, not be short with him.
Sam looked up at Dean through his now burning eyes and nods. “Yeah,” He groans. “Yeah lets go.” The two then head down the stairs, Dean more zealously than Sam. Can you blame him? He finally had Cas back. There was no way he was gonna lose him again.
“I love you, Dean Winchester. You don’t have to hide from me.” Castiel assures, pulling Dean into a long awaited kiss. Dean’s heart skipped a beat, and he hesitated before he let himself kiss Castiel back. He felt the familiar spark reappear in his chest as he tilted his head, pressing his lips firmly against Castiel’s.
Dean growled again, stomping up to the entrance and grabbing Mark’s wrist, pinning him to the outside of the library. Mark lets out a grunt and starts to pant, looking around angrily until he sees Dean. He rolled his eyes, smirking at the elder Winchester.
Dean sighed, crossing his arms and putting his face in his hand. “I don’t know how much longer I can do this Cas. Please, be honest with me. Stop lying to me. Just tell me the damn truth.” Dean begged, gesturing towards Castiel.
Either way, Dean knew he was ultimately screwed if what he had on him didn’t work. Because just from looking at this new ‘form’ of Spencer’s, he was larger. Like he’d made himself bigger at will.
Sam joined Dean soon after, his eyes widening as he too looked over the small shattered phone and the note attached to it. He looked over at Dean and again put his hand on his shoulder.
“So, back again? You want to top this time, slut?” Mark asks. Dean growled and pressed Mark against the wall harder. Mark grunts for a moment before he starts to chuckle, not intimidated by Dean. “Really, Dean? You think I can’t toss you off of me?” Mark snarls. Sam widened his eyes at Mark, surprised that this was the man that Dean had the one night stand with. But he still growled at him, angry that this man would even think to call his brother that.
“Well? I need to know, Dean. I will not do this without your consent.” He asks again, his voice somehow deeper than normal, which sent a direct beeline of pleasure to Dean’s crotch. Dean’s eyes rolled into the back of his head for a moment, biting his lip. He couldn’t think straight, not with Castiel’s grace moving inside of him and his hand stroking him, even through his boxers. He thought of Spencer, even as a monster, Cas loved him. Or at least Dean thought he did. Did Cas still love Dean? Not that love was directly needed for something like this…
“Now, let’s see. I have the grace I need, no thanks to you, I have the blood, the herbs, angel feather, which was very hard to come by… I should be set. Of course, I still need you to speak to her for me. I don’t exactly know how to speak enochian.” Spencer says in a fake and pitiful voice. Castiel, if he could, would have scowled.
Once finished with his boots, Dean stood up with a groan. Then he began his trek out to where Sam was seated in the map room, a coffee cup in front of him as he looked over the details of the case that Dean assumed Sam would tell him later. Probably going to start with ‘So get this…’
“Fine. Let me see it.”
Dean could feel the anger in his blood start to boil, making it harder to retain his composure. This asshole…
Castiel snarled. "Would you stop that? My employees are not playthings. They are workers, trying to make a living. Not just to be viewed as toys for your enjoyment." Castiel scolded once again, crossing his arms and narrowing his beautiful blue eyes at Alistair.
“He isn't taking this well… Is he?” Castiel asks in a caring voice. Dean almost falls over at the words. Of course he wasn’t.
Dean runs into the living room and stops dead in his tracks as he sees Castiel holding onto his phone as he helped Sam put together some of the evidence. “What the hell? What happened?” He asks, gesturing to the two’s gathered documents.
“JUST-! Just shut up!” He yelled, his eyes flaring with anger. “You know for damn certain none of that is true. These problems start over and over again because of my ignorance. You can’t fix me! God! All I ever hear out of your mouth is pity for me! Tell me the damn truth!” Dean yells at Castiel, his body leaning towards the stiffened angel.
Benny shrugged. "Beats me. Let's just hope for your sake that they get here after your shift ends." Benny says, handing a plate of food to Dean. "Table seven, make it quick. I got a feeling we're gonna be in for a busy night." He instructs.
“Cas, if he was the monster, I’m sure he would’ve taken me out sooner. Besides, he isn’t of Nordic descent, and he studies the language. He’s just a civilian.” Dean insists, walking past Castiel. “You seem a little uptight Cas… maybe you should eat something.” Dean suggests before walking inside.
Spencer huffs. “Well, each of the victims were O negative. So maybe there’s your connection.” Spencer suggests, making Dean scoff. When Dean looked up to try and speak, he caught a glimpse of Spencer’s glare towards him, which dared him to speak. Dared him to step up and make a fool of himself again. Dean didn’t feel small per say, but he did immediately get a sense of shame, and of reason.
Dean rolled his eyes and his fist tightened. “Well, then you can blame your lovely Spencer for attacking me and breaking me down so much I HAD to leave!” Dean growled, exclaiming sarcastically. “He told me that I should leave before I hurt anyone else in my life. And you know what? At first I wanted to just get my mind off of it all, you know. Blow off some steam. But I guess even doing that I hurt people. So maybe it would be best if we called off this promise, Cas. It might be best that you never see me again.” Dean snarled, tears building up in the back of his eyes that he refused to let loose.
“Try the barbeque chips. They go better with the burger.” Dean says as Mark fixes his plate. “And not exactly. It’s much more complicated than that.” Dean uttered in a flat and sad tone. He presses the spatula against one of the burgers as he hears Mark moan in delight. Dean blushes promptly, gulping and looking away from Mark.
Dean groaned again. He hated this stupid spell. He knew that Cas was able to break it on his own, probably because of his underlying feelings that still existed for Dean. But there was nothing Dean knew that could break the spell off of Sam.
Sam looked back down at his computer screen and narrowed his eyes. “No, Dean he’s… He’s outside the entrance.” Sam informs, a tone mixed with worry echoed from his mouth. Dean refused to believe that Cas wasn’t okay unless he saw it for himself.
The whiskey in the shot burned as it went down, best to prepare him for whatever was gonna be in the private room this time.
“Dean! This has to stop! Spencer isn’t the monster, Dean. Do you really think Cas would be dating the monster? I think you’re just jealous! And that’s okay!” Sam says in another exasperated sigh. Dean shook his head.
“I thought a barbeque was just barbequed foods? Nothing else?” Castiel pondered, staying put as he analyzed Dean’s face. Dean looked away, not wanting to see the cuteness that Castiel had in his eyes when he was this confused.
“Yeah, uh I gotta get back. You know, my brother’s worried about me. I got that case to worry about.” Dean starts excusing, and Mark nods.
“Do I have permission, Dean? Can I retake you, and can I break this warding stuck inside of you?” Castiel asks, his hand stroking Dean’s length through his opened jeans and his boxers. Dean’s breath shakes, Castiel’s grace slowly and still moving inside of him. He was unable to speak for a moment, looking into Castiel’s eyes questioningly.
Dean didn’t know what he was feeling, but he knew it was draining. Because as soon as he walked inside, away from most of the crowd, Dean’s entire body began to loosen and he felt his face drop. Dean just needed a beer. Or two. He was sure of it.
Castiel had confronted Spencer right then and there in front of all of his colleagues over what Dean had heard. Spencer had tried to deny it, telling Castiel that Dean had been lying, like he was about what had happened earlier with the knife. But Castiel wasn’t budging. Castiel had gotten into Spencer’s face and broke it off, saying that he didn’t want a cheater as a partner.
“Cas… D-do...Do you still love me..” Dean asks shakily, his teeth clenching as Castiel’s grace stopped suddenly inside of him. Castiel tilts his head for a moment.
Dean sighed. “I--I don’t know, alright? I have an idea, but I don’t know for sure. You gotta believe me Sammy.” Dean exclaimed, walking over to Sam and gripping his shoulders. “You’re under some kind of spell. That smell I told you I smelled? Yeah, it's really bad out in the hallway but you just didn’t smell it! How else would you not unless you were under a spell?” Dean’s arms fly around as he gestures to Sam to try and get him to understand and to convince him of the truth.
Castiel’s eyes briefly felt two tears simultaneously build up in them and then fall as he pulled Dean into a relieved passionate kiss. His lips met Dean’s, and the spark lit up in their bellies. Castiel tilted his head, cupping Dean’s cheeks as he brought him flush against him, kissing him deeply.
Castiel’s face immediately turned white at the revelation that Dean knew. That he had found out what he had talked with Sam about. He looked down shamefully, as if he knew he was in the wrong here. “Dean… Yes, this was unfair. But don’t you think I just wanted to be friends again? That’s allowed, isn’t it?” He asks exasperatedly.  Dean’s expression hardens and he sneers at the angel.
Dean’s eyes scaled the living room. Any possible exit of the room was quickly put into his memory; The screen door, through the kitchen to the back door, out the open window Castiel had a screen behind, etc. Dean couldn’t let this monster hurt anyone else. The good news was that he didn’t seem to hold a grudge against Sam or Cas, so Dean just had to keep an eye on Spencer, make sure he doesn’t try anything to get alone with Sam. Cas was definitely safe and in the green zone. Spencer ‘loved’ him. But it was more like a yandere relationship.
“I haven’t forgotten.” Castiel whispered into the hunter’s ear before he slammed right back into him, eliciting a loud and shaky moan from him. Castiel began thrusting deep into the hunter, grunting harshly as he began a fast, but easy starting pace inside of Dean, gripping his waist a little too hard.
“C-cas…” Dean grunted, his hands finding where Castiel’s were on his waist and intertwining their fingers. Castiel recalled his grace, and just moved it deep inside Dean, successfully breaking the warding that Dean had inside of him. Castiel then slowly pulled out of Dean, eliciting a whimper from the hunter. Castiel chuckled and turned Dean around, leaning him against the wall as he helped get the hunter dressed once again.
“Of course. Take as long as you need, Dean.” Castiel says, his voice much less monotone than Dean remembered. Dean appreciates it, but It also sends a jab of hurt into Dean’s chest.
Present Dean could only watch over in horror as he waited to hear the words that started all of his problems. He felt like he was suffocating in his tears, drowning even.
Hey! Warning to my readers there is some smutty themes in this one! Don't worry, the real smut will come later, no pun intended.
Castiel grumbled as Dean took the chairs from him, sighing heavily. “I’m getting the chairs set up for the barbeque, Dean.” Castiel says, heaving the chairs out through the screen door. “I had hoped you would have slept longer, Dean. From the looks of how restless you were last night I figured you would need it.” Castiel grunts, opening the chairs and setting them up in a circular fashion around the tables that Sam was outside fixing up.
Sam sighed and looked up in annoyance. He flashes Dean his puppy eyes and looks back at him. “Just give the guy at least an hour. To explain the case and whatnot. Alright? If you really don’t want to work with him after that then… then we’ll work on the case on our own. Okay? You owe me that much.” Sam says in an exasperated tone.
“Okay Dean. Promise.” Sam says. They both then climb out of the Impala, Dean more begrudgingly and slow than Sam. Dean stared at the house in front of him. It was so Cas. It spoke volumes to him. The hedges were perfectly trimmed. The house was freaking blue. Sky blue, but still blue. The door was a copper red and the grass was seemingly fresh cut. Seemed fitting for the angel.
Castiel took a step closer to Dean, his hand reaching out to him. “Dean, you don’t mean-” He starts in a calm voice. Dean swats Castiel’s hand away and he growled at him.
Dean was done. After two times that he’d buckled under Spencer’s glare and his stare, he wasn’t going to let it affect him. Castiel looked at Dean, sighing and giving him the most pleading look he could muster, making Dean’s heart melt in the process.
“Gross! Dean is this the smell you said you smelled? It’s awful! It’s like what the revenants smell like, God-” Sam groaned, blinking his eyes a few times. Dean’s face breaks into a smile and he too covers his nose.
"Ugh, Benny, man don't bring that up. Bobby's being nice enough to let me pay my 'rent' late. But he's losing faith. Keeps bringing up the idea of me coming back to Lawrence. I'll be dead on the ground before I step foot back there." Dean swears, sighing as he settled into a seat at the bar.
"The name's Bobby John. Alright?" He answers, pouring the last drink and standing up. Once standing, Dean could see Gabriel was in the corner, giving him a confused look when he answered with something that clearly wasn't his name. At least to him.
Twenty or so minutes later Castiel wandered through to the backyard, looking around like he was searching for someone. He smiled as he spotted Dean, carrying a carry-out box over to Dean and setting it down next to him but not on top of the books. “Hello Dean. How was your translation process?” Castiel asks, taking a seat next to Dean. Dean felt his heart lurch in his chest, making him almost start crying again. He took in a deep breath and looked over his notes, shrugging.
"But they're underlings. they're supposed to do what we want." Lucifer whined, throwing a dart at the dart board in the corner.
“So a random hookup was more important than letting us know where you were? Huh? Was it that Mark guy?” Castiel asked, his eyes looking more and more hurt as he looked at Dean. “Dean, you made a promise to me. That you wouldn’t leave until this hunt was over-!” Castiel reminds, stepping closer to Dean.
Dean shook his head at the thought, waving Sam off “Don’t worry about it Sam. Now, uh… did you guys get any more evidence on this murder? The last guy was pretty fresh, so we might be able to get some info on him that we couldn’t get before.” Dean asks, trying to move on from the discussion. Sam still looked upset, but didn’t press the issue further. Dean was thankful for that.
Dean looked into Castiel’s eyes again, finding the courage to do so after being in Castiel’s arms for the first time in a long time. He found kindness, care, worry, all mixed into the stormy ocean that was Castiel’s eyes. Dean could only wonder what was being displayed back in his own eyes.
Dean’s first thing that he saw was Castiel’s Lincoln Continental. At that sight, Dean parked the car and started to put the car into reverse. Sam jumped up at Dean’s reaction and forced Dean to put the car back into park. “Look, Dean, I know I should have told you he was here. But if I didn’t, would you have even come?” Sam asks, again flashing his puppy eyes.
“Dean Michael Winchester, I have never stopped loving you.” Castiel leaned into his ear, whispering his response. Dean shivered again at how close Cas was to his ear. He had his answer.
“Anyway, the case has already had four victims. Uh... my contact says that the bodies were found with crushed skulls, drained blood, and shrivelled skin-” Sam began to explain, looking off of his notes to get the information across as well as he hoped.
Dean jolts up in bed again, looking around the unfamiliar room and slightly panicking. Where was he? How did he get here? His mind swarms with thoughts until he hears the gentle, consistent buzz of a cell phone. Then Dean remembers. And the pain in his ass remembers. Dean sighed and swung his tired legs out of the bed. He was thankful that Mark had wanted to help, but Dean really regretted what he did. Sure, Cas was with Spencer. But he was betraying what he did have with Cas by not telling him he was leaving. That at least would have been somewhat kind to do. Then he could have made their relationship still repairable when Cas found out he had another one-night stand.
Finally after a moment, Dean sighed and pulled out the chair next to him. “Go ahead. I’m not having much luck on my own end with these books.” Dean grumbled thumping his phone down in front of the guy. Dean was trying desperately to hide his now evident problem from this guy he just met. Dean seriously felt like a teenager again. Like he did when he first met Cas and he couldn’t control his mini-me for the life of him.
“Jealousy? Cas that’s what you call jealousy? He literally broke me down at the party to get me to leave! To break my promise to you! He paid Mark off to screw me! He has shown me nothing but hostility ever since he found out I was your ex! If that’s what jealousy is I’m a fucking saint!” Dean fumes, his hand returning to his side.
Castiel tangled his thrusts and began to pound into Dean’s prostate. It didn’t take more than three thrusts into Dean’s prostate that he came with a loud and pornographic cry of Castiel’s name, head tilted back and all. Dean’s release exploded over the wallpaper and the floor, dripping from his tip once it had finished. Castiel was not too far behind, as Dean had tightened up on him from his orgasm. He struggled to thrust any faster, and finally, after a good few more thrusts Castiel thrusted in as deep as he could, spilling his release deep inside of him.
“Sure, talk soon Dean?” Mark asks, winking at Dean. Dean smirked back, raising an eyebrow and winking back at Mark.
Dean gulped for a moment, leaning over to see Mark talking to himself, as if he was trying to remember what each pattern of runes meant. “So? What’s it say?” Dean asks, finding himself unable to back up when he knew he should’ve. Mark’s previous smirk fades and he looks up at Dean with a worried look.
Okay, so, long story short, life gets busy yadda yadda, I'm gonna be a bit slower in posting. Sorry. i'll try to post a bit more, but its all going to depend on how I feel. And how much literature my brain wants to squeeze out of my head like a zit.
Dean adjusted the pair of angel wings situated on his back. Again, marketing. They weren't huge. They were part of a 'sexy angel' costume. Or something.
“Gross, could you not? I’d rather not have my face burn off cause of your stupid grace.” Spencer growled. Castiel raised an eyebrow, still in confusion.
Sam pulled his phone from his pocket, shrugging his shoulders. “I don’t know… I was under that spell, remember? I can barely remember all that I did, Dean. I don’t remember my thoughts.” Sam answered, scrambling to pull up a new tab on his phone to find a map of the town.
Dean feels sick to his stomach and that he might just hurl. Not because it was disgusting, but because Castiel and him had never even shared a room together when they had been dating. Courting as Castiel called it. But now Cas was sharing a bed, a room, a house with this guy. Maybe he was superior to Dean, in every way possible.
“Dean, when you left the station, I was hurt. But I knew, I could feel that you were hurting more. That you were pushing me away again.” Castiel starts, making Dean’s chest hurt from the reminder. “So I left to find you. Sam and Spencer refused to go with me. Saying you needed your space. But I wasn’t going to risk being the reason for your suicide.” Castiel deadpans, handing Dean a glass of water. Dean widened his eyes at Castiel’s declaration. Was that really what Cas thought Dean was doing out there?
Alastair chuckled, gesturing for one of the men who had accompanied him to stand beside him. "You know I was only joking, Castiel. Although the King would love a pretty new asset like this." Alastair purred disgustingly.
“Sam… not now, please. My head is pounding…” He grumbled, rubbing his forehead. Sam scoffed, rolling his eyes and looking up at the ceiling.
Dean huffed in annoyance. He’d rather be getting this hunt done and completed than go to some stupid neighborhood gathering where everyone is fake and he’ll probably have to watch Castiel be happy and be happy for him for hours on end with no escape. And no alcohol.
“Probably Spencer’s spell. Cas did say something before about Naomi taking away his memories a few times. Maybe he could read them cause the memory of being able to read them was taken away?” Dean suggested, giving Sam a very uncertain look. Sam raised an eyebrow at Dean, a slight smirk tugging at his lips. Dean rolled his eyes. “I don’t know, I’m grasping at straws here!” He hisses in response.
Dean grumbled, growling a bit as he tried and failed to get the book back from Sam. Dean rolled his eyes and stood up, grabbing the book from Sam’s grip. “Yeah, I am. Cause that freaking message freaked me out, alright?” Dean admitted, closing the book again.
“What the hell is your problem with me having a one night stand, Cas?! Why?! Why do you care so much that some other man fucked me?!” Dean bellows, and he could swear he felt his blood rising to his face. Because he saw a mirror of it on Castiel’s face. Castiel was panting in anger now, and he firmed his posture as he almost exploded with his exclamation.
"That's no reason not to~ I got plenty to argue about, Muttonhead!" Gabriel slurred, before groaning and trying to swing a playful punch.
"Thanks for the heads up. What do they need?" He asks, sighing as Benny then gave him the most expensive looking wine bottle Dean had ever set his eyes on. The glass had to be made of diamond for a single shot to cost so much.
So here he was, sleeping away on Castiel’s couch. The motel hadn’t reopened since the murder happened, so he was stuck with Castiel’s place. No matter how pissed he was at Cas. And that is when he felt someone pull him off the couch, and he hit the ground with a thud. He banged his head against the coffee table, cursing to himself and looking up, seeing a blurry version of Spencer.
“S-Sammy-?! Wh-what? No, no I did not cut myself man! Let me go-!” He scoffed, pulling his arms from Sam’s grips, rubbing his wrists once they were free. “What the hell Sam?!” He demanded, blinking his eyes as he felt the sleep heavy on his eyes. At least he hadn’t woken up crying this time. But that was because Spencer decided to give him something to cry about.
Castiel chuckled, taking Dean’s chin and tilting his face back towards Castiel’s. “You are mine, Dean. No matter how much you push me away, I am not going to give up what’s mine. Never again.” Castiel says in a dark and serious tone, with hints of seductive pangs to it. At this, Castiel unzips Dean’s jeans, and looks up into Dean’s eyes, his blue and lust blown eyes searching his being for the warding and for Dean’s permission.
Dean rubbed his eyes free from tears, trying to settle the sobbing that had erupted in his chest. He couldn’t be doing this. He had to be happy. Try to be. For Cas. Not for himself. Never for himself. Castiel was happy. Why couldn’t Dean be happy for him? He’d found his someone. The man that would treat him better than any broken way Dean could. And Dean just had to accept that. No matter how hard.
“Sir, you have to answer my questions. If you want to ease the suspicion of you-” the officer started and tried to explain. Dean wasn’t listening. The blood roaring in his ears and the drowning thoughts in his head were too much. And then things turned red, and Dean’s now clenched fist collided with the officer’s face.
“But, Dean you aren’t Norse. Neither am I, why would it go after you?” Sam asks. Dean sighed and walked up close to Sam, taking out the knife.
“What?” Castiel asked, getting closer to Dean and putting a hand on his shoulder. Dean shrugged it off, wiping away his tears.
Dean woke up to a voice echoing his name. Dean’s eyes burst open almost instantly, his vision blurry from the presence of his tears. Dean sat up on the couch, as he realized he was awake again. He looked around for a moment, his chest heaving from his sobbing. Then he began to see clearer, and he felt like the bible characters that had seen an angel, because as his eyes adjusted, all he could see was Castiel.
“Sam, I’ve told you, the guy was Chris Hemsworth.” He says, turning to Castiel. Dean gives Castiel a weird look as Castiel was still focused on him, like he was trying to reach through the warding that Dean had written onto his skin. Dean blinked a few times, awkwardly looking at Cas. “Uh… Cas? You okay there man?” He asks.
Dean shrugged off the thought and finally entered the kitchen, seeing a clearly naked Mark pouring coffee into a mug. Dean swallowed the lump in his throat as he gripped his phone, wishing that maybe he had been smart enough to bring a weapon just in case. He still didn’t know anything about this guy other than his name and what he did for a living. And that he was terrible at sex. Sure, he was good at dirty talk. But when it came to everything else? He fell short.
Dean climbed into the Impala and he started her up, enjoying the sudden blast of Metallica that came out of the speakers. He truly felt at home in his car. If Dean was to be honest? He’d rather stay in the Impala than to stay in Castiel’s house. But what was the harm? Castiel had already seen him cry in his sleep, so there was no use hiding that from him. There was going to be that Barbeque tomorrow, Spencer wouldn’t want a body or a murder to dampen the party where he gets to show off his angel. So Dean figured one night couldn’t hurt. Still didn’t mean Dean wasn’t a little uneasy about the whole thing. He was still 99.9% sure Spencer was the monster. Or at least a monster, maybe not the one on the case.
Dean swallowed a hard sob in his throat and he firmed his expression, shoving the beer bottle into Spencer’s hand before he walked away, fast-walking towards the couch to grab what he could. He couldn’t stay anymore. He knew he’d promised Castiel but he couldn’t. Spencer was unrelenting and he just needed to get away.
“Sam, no. Trust me, I hit my head against the coffee table last night. Hell, I have a bump on my head from it! I’m telling you man, he had grey decaying skin and his eyes were glowing red! And I did my own research, that’s why I got those books from the library. I hit him with silver last night and that’s when he shifted back to how he looked like when we first met him. Why his eyes are so dead. Cause he’s already dead, Sam!” Dean exclaimed.
Dean takes a deep, and long breath before he untenses his fist and looks back at Spencer, who looks a bit puzzled at his actions. “Well, Spence’, when you’ve been in this business for as long as I have, you learn to improvise.” He insists, smirking at him as he smooths some of his hair out and starts making his way towards the crime scene and leaving a semi-pissed off Spencer and an amused Sam. And of course, a head-tilting Castiel, who didn’t understand.
Castiel tilts his head more, his own hands turning into fists at the thought of Dean even thinking like this. “Dean, I… I don’t understand.” Castiel asks, putting his hand again on Dean’s shoulder. Dean turns around and looks Castiel dead in the eyes.
Dean turned up Baby’s radio and rolled down his windows, pulling her into gear before starting to drive. As he drove, he spotted Spencer getting into his car. Though Dean didn’t roll his window down to do so, Dean flipped him off. Dean let out a happy laugh and he sped forward, singing along to the radio and trying his damndest to not think of Castiel, or the past.
Sam sighed and rolled his eyes. “Yes, Dean. I have contacts. You do too. Maybe we just don’t know all the same people. Anyway, like I said, each of the victims had crushed skulls, were drained of their blood through a puncture wound the autopsy reports say was through the back of the head, through what looks to be a human bite. Except the incisors and the canines were sharpened more, to suck in more blood. And the skin was shrivelled. Like all the life was drained from it.” He informs, looking back up at Dean.
Dean’s fingers drum against the steering wheel, nervous feelings running through him like a toddler high on pixie sticks. Was it so much to ask for Cas to be okay? For him to finally get a win after the last six months of regretting being such an asshole to Cas? Maybe it was. Dean didn’t know what exactly Spencer was, or what exactly the limit to his power was. What if he could kill an angel? Or at the very least make Castiel forget him? Dean would never be able to forgive himself of that.
Dean sighed and called the number back, pinching his nose and groaning. This had better be worth it.
Sam stepped away from the desk and grabbed Dean’s arm and pulled him off to the side. “Dean,” He whispered. “Are you sure we can even trust him? How come Cas wasn’t able to read the message before?” Sam asked, gripping Dean’s arm a little too tight. Dean sighed harshly, pulling his arm from Sam’s grip.
“Yeah, each of the victims, same cause of death. Each showed signs of a struggle before their heads were crushed. By bare hands.” Spencer adds. Sam widened his eyes and furrowed his eyebrows in complete confusion.
It doesn’t take long, but as soon as Dean starts to get comfortable in Castiel’s arms again, he feels the draw of grace in him. The slight push and pull of it through him starts to lull him back to sleep. He starts to fight it at first, wanting to enjoy this for as long as he can. But before he could even try to open his eyelids again to fight against the urge to sleep, he drifts off. The warmth of Castiel and his grace comforting him as he once again returns to his dreamscape.
Dean shoves away his thoughts, pushes them down before he gets up. The immediate feeling of the cold concrete finally wakes him completely. Reminds him of who he has to be. What part he’s gotta play. And it sends a piercing feeling through his gut. Making his body also feel weighted. But again, as with all of his feelings, he shoves it down.
Castiel furrowed his eyebrows. Of course he was talking about Dean. Dean hadn’t done anything wrong other than show up like Castiel had asked Sam to get Dean to do. It wasn’t in his plan for Sam to trick Dean into coming though.
“My contact doesn’t even know. He says he’s got an idea, but he doesn’t know for sure. He says he’s only been on the case for a few days. By the time we get there he’ll have been there for five. So he’s only slightly more informed than us.” Sam says in his best ‘Please don’t fight with me on this Dean’ face. The face and voice he usually uses when he knows Dean’ll probably be annoyed about anything. Or protest.
Dean sighed, giving the woman who ordered one of the meals her plate. Without looking at the culprit of the comment, he replied. "I don't know. Somebody like you would be lucky to even get some bitch's number. Unfortunately for you, I'm no bitch." He snips at the man as he gives the second plate to the second woman at the table.
As Dean walked towards the stairwell, he began to smell something he could only describe as awful. Horrendous, even. He groaned and pinched his nose, beginning to breathe through his nose. What could be making that terrible smell? Was Sam hoarding his rabbit food upstairs?
Sam raised an eyebrow. He turned to Castiel and shook his head. “Well I for one, wouldn’t mind staying Cas.” He says, giving Dean a stink eye. Dean can feel his lips curling into a scowl, and he has to rub his face and look away to keep from insulting or hurting Castiel again.
Dean shook his head, and firmed his face, swallowing his feelings. He didn’t need them anyway. He had the fake ones. Sam frowned and pulled the plate back over to himself, about to speak up again before the devil walked in.
Sam slowly rises to his feet, coughing hard as he finally stands to the best of his ability. Spencer had knocked his shoulder out of it’s socket, so his left arm was useless. Sam knew better than to attempt to attack Spencer while Dean was in his hold and Castiel was in the state that he was. So instead, Sam began looking for a photo. Any photo of Castiel.
At the mention of the message, Castiel and Sam straightened out. Castiel sighed and looked up at Dean. “What did it say, Dean?” He asks, sitting away from the back of the chair. Dean laid the book down and sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose.
Dean shook his head. What was he thinking? He was drunk. He wasn’t thinking clearly. Nor was he breathing correctly. He wasn’t going to let himself give up like that. The old Dean inside of him still had pride. And his pride wouldn’t let him go like this. Not by his own hand.
Dean couldn’t remember a time when he and Castiel had been so close. Castiel, instead of walking away to leave Dean alone, he stayed with him, even if he didn’t say anything more. Castiel’s body was so close to Dean’s own, and he just couldn’t stop his breath from hitching.
“Shh, Dean. As much as I love hearing every word that comes out of your mouth, no matter how stupid, I can’t let Sam know what we’re up to, now can I?” Cas asks, smirking as he holds Dean even closer to his body.
“C-CAS-!! Ngh-! FUCK!” Dean cried out, tears brimming in his eyes as Castiel began to slowly pick up the pace, causing Dean’s moans to grow even louder. Castiel’s hand moved from his waist to Dean’s mouth, covering his mouth as he leaned into his neck. Castiel left a deep bite mark in his skin, not deep enough to draw blood or to scar though. Just enough to establish his claim.
Castiel grunted in pain, gritting his teeth as he slowly came to from the punch to the face. He attempted to move his hands to his face, but found they were still bound. Castiel’s mind felt fuzzy and hazy, like something was trying to take over it. His grace felt weakened, almost stolen somehow. His head felt light, and his vision was blurry.
“Because you’re too special to be giving yourself away like that.” Castiel rephrases. Dean scoffs and rolls his eyes, laughing sarcastically.
Castiel’s face doesn’t change. Of course Naomi’s mind mending would come back to bite him in the metaphorical ass eventually. But this does qualify him getting ‘too close’ to the humans, so he guessed this was another time Naomi decided to wipe his mind.
His breath hitched as he heard a, in his opinion, very sexy, deep, and gravelly voice reply. "Come in." Dean took another breath and pushed the door open.
Dean didn't leave time for questions as he quickly turned away and began his trek to the stairs that lead to the private room. It was blocked off for anyone who didn't have the key, so Dean was pretty safe from perverts at least.
Dean shook his head and pinched the bridge of his nose. He sighed deeply and stood up straighter, walking back over to Sam. “So? Any ideas? You and Cas did go out and get that food for us. Did you see any places that looked abandoned? Maybe a warehouse or something? Monsters seem to like those places.” Dean suggested, crossing his arms impatiently.
Dean thought about running again. He thought about going against his promise to Castiel and just running away from all of it. Leaving all of his evidence for Sam and Castiel to shift through and running back home to drink again. But he couldn’t. He didn’t want to risk Spencer actually being the monster and putting Castiel at risk. Though Dean was still certain that Castiel would be able to deal with him, as he’s an angel, but Dean knew that he had to stay. He made a promise to Castiel. He wasn’t going to break this one.
Oh, and one more thing. More like a person.
Dean approached the bar again for what felt like the gazillionth time that night, taking the shot Benny immediately offered him. "What's this for?" He asks. Benny gave him a knowing look and Dean immediately sighed and groaned, dowing the shot in one gulp.
Dean rolled his eyes and stepped forward, getting into Castiel’s face. “And I didn’t! And I sent a text to Sam last night! So I wasn’t putting a ‘random hook-up’ over you.” Dean grumbled, making air quotes. “Why do you care anyway? You have Spencer. Sam is a good listener. You don’t need me. Why does it matter to you that yeah, maybe I did have a one-night stand with Mark?” Dean asks, tilting his head as Castiel’s eyes flash an angry blue.
“Hm? Something wrong Cas?” Dean asks, lifting each of the vegetables and putting them in a circular dish  and showing Cas each step. Castiel took a deep breath and blew it out softly. He leaned against the counter to avoid showing off his issue.
“Fuck-!” Dean pants, his ass pushing back further as he squeezes his eyes shut again, imagining Castiel in the place of Mark. Dean has to catch himself before he moans Castiel’s name out loud. He quickly changes it to Mark’s name, though he feels sinful doing so. As if what he was doing wasn’t sinful enough.
Sam followed with a grunt, his feet scurrying behind as they rushed out the entrance. Dean took out his keys and fumbled with them as he attempted to unlock the Impala. After a few short moments of frustration, Dean unlocked the car, climbing in and starting up her engine. Once Sam was in the car and his car door was closed, Dean didn’t waste any more time. He immediately pulled the car into reverse and began to back out.
Not his hunter. He wasn’t Castiel’s hunter anymore. No matter how hard Castiel wished it.
“Wait, what? Bare hands? You didn’t say anything about that Cas.” Sam brings up, turning his gaze towards the angel. His eyes still flickered back towards Dean occasionally, though Dean still refused to look up. Apparently the blank white countertop was much more appealing. Castiel’s eyes followed Dean’s for a moment, trying to see if maybe he’d look back up at him. Castiel’s frown deepens and he takes in a hefty sigh.
Sam gulped and put his hands on his hips. “Well… we gotta figure out who this monster is. Then we can figure out who exactly this message is for. Protect them. Cause it’s obvious they’re on this monster’s kill list.” Sam says, his eyebrows tilting up in worry. Castiel sighed and stood up, standing near Dean.
Dean rolled his eyes, before speaking through his mouthful. “Well I’ll take it.” Dean says while laughing, chewing the rest of his food. He smiled at Mark, who smirked back at him with a flirtatious grin. “So, mister businessman, are you gonna be trouble for me? Am I gonna have to call my moose of a brother to chase you away?” Dean flirts after swallowing his food. Mark snickered and laughed, leaning his head back.
Upon arriving at the crime scene Dean pulled out his fake FBI badge and slid it into his jacket pocket. He climbed out of the Impala, sighing as he yet again began to approach Castiel, Sam, and Devil 2.0. He slid his gun into the back of his pants, slowing his stride as he approached the three.
Castiel looked so happy. Content, even. And it was all without Dean. If only he could’ve held his tongue, not fought with Castiel when all he wanted to do was help him, then maybe that would be him sitting next to Cas, and not the man he’s replaced him with. Dean was jealous, he knew he was. In his head, Castiel was his. Well, used to be. Then he pushed him away. Because everyone that associates with him dies eventually. And his life is too complicated to give him anything remotely normal.
Castiel frowned, looking down at Dean with worry all over his face. He moves a stray strand of Dean’s slightly longer hair away from his face. “They are as bad as before, aren’t they?” Castiel asks cautiously. Dean half chuckled.
Both of them groaned as Castiel pushed deeper into Dean, sending bolts and shivers up both of their spines. Dean felt the pool in his core growing warmer. Damn Cas always had his way with him. He was already halfway there.
“So you remember what I told you about this case?” Sam brings up. Dean grunts a bit and looks up, registering Sam had said something before actually responding. Dean found himself more in thought than in the moment recently. He found that strange. Usually he was in his ‘hunters mindset’ as he called it. Going from one moment to the next with a no bullshit attitude. Taking no crap from anyone, just like John. But ever since… Dean hasn’t been in that ‘mindset’. He’s found himself distracted more often than he found himself focused. And it pissed him off.
Dean swerved the car as he turned right, making Sam grab at the sides of his seat. Dean took several shallow breaths, causing Sam to put a hand on his shoulder. Dean finally calmed somewhat, realizing that Cas would not want to find out that his rescue came with a police ticket.
Only one of them succeeded in that, but still. The comparison was there.
Benny sighed, sliding a pretty pink drink towards Andrea as she handed him a fistful of bills. "Sorry brother, the higher-ups have been having lots of meetings. It's your turn." Benny apologizes, picking up a white rag and a spray bottle and cleaning off the bar counter.
Castiel again looked disheartened at Dean’s urgency to leave. But he could understand why. He nods and smiles at his old friend. “Alright Dean. Please, take care.” He says. Dean nods wordlessly and turns around, and walks out the door, fully planning on drinking himself stupid in whatever motel room he could find.
The officer directed Dean towards the main area of the waiting room and immediately Dean wanted to groan. It was cologne shower. He was talking to the chief, but Dean could barely hear what he was saying till he was moved forward.
Sam sighed on the other end. "Dean… Dad's dead."
Sam raised an eyebrow and shook his head. “No, no Dean that-That can’t be true. Are you sure you weren’t just imagining all of it? You and him have been at each other’s throats the entire time we’ve been here.” Sam asks, his eyebrow raised hesitantly.
Dean scoffed, the officer leading him out forcing him to stand next to the two. The chief then looked towards Dean. “So, Mr. Thornhill, is Mr. Desmond’s testimony of the events true? Was that how it happened?” The chief asks. Dean rolled his eyes, rubbing his face to wipe the annoyed and angry look from his face as he spoke up again.
Dean caught a glimpse of the body first. It was like Spencer had described before. The skin was impossibly shrivelled. His hair was gray and barely even the dark ginger that it had been. And the skull was crushed.
“Hey Cas. Hey Sam. You missed quite the porno marathon last night. So, who was it this time?” Dean asks, shoving his hands into his pockets as he lied about what he’d done the previous night. It wasn’t like either of them could read him and see that he was suffering from a harsh hangover. Castiel seemed to be inspecting him, almost trying to pick apart the pieces of his soul that Dean had made sure after Castiel had left to get clouded, warded against any angel seeing his deepest feelings. Even pesky archangels that want to try and read him for a weakness.
“Leave, Cas.” Dean growled. Sam and Castiel’s eyes widened and immediately refocused on Dean in surprise, hoping he didn’t just say what he did.
Dean bent down as he looked in the fridge just as Castiel was turning to go look at another cabinet. Castiel felt his vessel’s breath hitch quietly. His cheeks reddened and he cleared his throat. His vessel had a problem now. And Castiel knew why. Dean stood back up when he grabbed a bunch of dippable vegetables from the fridge.
Dean slowly woke up, but not where he expected to be. He opened his eyes, immediately feeling the tears he’d been crying in his sleep falling against his cheek. He sighed to himself, getting quite annoyed with his persistent problem. Dean goes to wipe away the evidence of his tears, but his hand is held against the wall. Dean chuckled sadly, looking down at his hand.
Castiel sighed. “He’s over there. Doing his job.” Castiel says with a hint of animosity, pointing over to where the body laid. Dean turned his head and he saw a man with the ‘Forensic’ labeled jacket turn around and smile at the group, waving his hand. Upon further examination, Dean could tell it was cologne di-Spencer.
Dean took a deep breath in and ventured closer to Spencer and Cas’s room, his eyes beginning to burn from the potent smell. Dean entered the room and instantly coughed and rubbed his eyes. He opened his eyes as much as he could, and took a look around the room.
Dean entered through a farther away entrance, rushing to Castiel’s side. Dean’s knees hit the hard concrete and the flash of a knife followed. “It’s gonna be okay Cas, I got you. He’s not gonna use you, not gonna hurt you anymore.” Dean promises, cutting off Castiel’s restraints starting with the ones at his feet.
Dean exhaled in relief and took his phone back from Benny. "Thanks Benny, means alot man. Promise, I won't be late." He chuckled before he turned around and began to walk to the back door, pushing through and walking down the steps.
Dean shivers, crying out at Castiel’s bite. Dean doesn’t dare open his eyes, he can already feel the tears of pleasure cascading down his cheeks. Castiel’s grace wraps around Dean’s length, causing him to jolt his back straight for a moment. Castiel chuckled at this, and began to make his grace start to stroke Dean in time with his rapidly increasing thrusts.
So when this incredibly handsome man, who Dean will admit looked a ton like Castiel, he felt his jeans grow tight for the first time in awhile. Dean gulped a bit, but didn’t loosen his grip. The man then began to speak, and Dean soaked it in like a sponge.
“Then what are we all standing around for? Let’s go. Before this asshole finds another victim.” Dean commands, beginning to make his way towards the front door again. Dean was sure he wasn’t thinking. He was in his hunter’s mindset. So when Spencer cleared his throat, he couldn’t control the involuntary growl that left his throat.
Sam nudges Dean’s arm to get his attention, chuckling a bit afterwards. Dean fumbles with his words for a few seconds, making himself look effectively stupid before he finally says something. “Sure. Just don’t poison us.” He says, a little more serious than he meant.
Spencer blew hot air out of his nose and he crossed his arms. “Fine. But ask him first. You don’t want to force the man.” Spencer suggests, smirking as Castiel turned to question Dean. Spencer glared at Dean, daring him to even think of saying yes.
"For someone who not two hours ago took Slutty Kelly down a peg you look pretty nervous. What's on your mind, Dean?" He asked, leaning over the counter again. Dean slipped his phone from his pocket and gave it to Benny.
“No. No, I don’t think anything between us can be salvaged. So go fuck your cologne-loving boyfriend, and leave me the hell alone. I don’t want anything to do with you again. Friends, pah, who needs ‘em? Right?” He growled, narrowing his eyes at Castiel before he shoves past him, and turns to leave.
Dean waltzed into the kitchen, seeing Spencer making his way inside. Dean rolled his eyes and just popped open his beer, leaning against the fridge. Spencer walks in, and his comedic neighborly smile falls and he stomps up to Dean, growling and snarling. Dean rolled his eyes and just kept sipping his beer.
Kelly sauntered over to the bar, her tight, full sexy angel lingerie squeezing around her body as she approached the three who were bent over the bar in a hunched group.
Dean took three large breaths, and flipped down the visor. He opened the mirror and started to fix his hair, trying to look less like a hermit and an alcoholic and more like the Dean Castiel used to know. The less broken one. Dean straightened his shirt, and his flannel. He pulled on his spare hunting jacket, and made sure to arm himself. He’d feel better with the press of his demon knife in the pocket against his chest, right?
“Hey, buddy, I’ve been trying to be nothing but nice to you. And sure, he’s my ex. But I’m at least guaranteed a friendship with my best friend. Even if I blew up at him.” Dean scolds, pointing a finger at Spencer. Castiel sighed at Dean, wishing he hadn’t spoken up.
Mark’s tender fingers wrapped around Dean’s boxer briefs and tugged them off hurriedly, tossing them across the almost empty room. Mark followed this by his own pair, and began to grind his hips against Dean’s ass, teasing him with his length. Dean’s eyes rolled back as he felt Mark’s length. He was gifted, but a part of Dean knew he wasn’t Cas. Jimmy Novak was one blessed man.
Dean parks Baby a small distance away from the scene, stepping out in his FBI suit and running a hand through his messy light brown hair as he approaches a similarly dressed Castiel and Sam. His heart was still pounding as he walked up, but not as much as before. The thought and the knowledge that he’d get to go back to the bunker and shamelessly drink away all his feelings was something he cherished.
Mark, with a gulp and a clearing of his throat, looked back into Dean’s eyes and sighed.
“No, Cas. No. Because the entire time I’ve been here? I’ve hurt you. Spencer actually had some fact to what he was saying. I hurt everyone I’m around. Ellen, Jo, Bobby, Charlie, Kevin, Sam, You, you’ve all died for me. You and Sam more than once. When am I ever gonna stop losing the people I love?! Never! Because I’m cursed, Cas! I hurt everyone I’m around. I don’t want to hurt you or-or get you killed again! That’s why I keep pushing you away! Keep you far enough away that I don’t hurt you with everything else in my head! Do you know how many nightmares I’ve had of you dying? Over and over?” Dean rants, a single tear building up in his tear duct and falling down his cheek. Castiel widened his eyes, not expecting Dean to confess to how he’s been feeling.
Once Castiel noticed Dean he stopped talking about Spencer. He instead focused his attention on the incoming Winchester. Dean quickly forced a firm line on his face, knowing that was more believable than any fake smile he could muster after the previous night filled with alcohol and tears.
Aaaanyways, hope you enjoy this belated chapter anyhow. Buh bye(till next part)!
Dean rolled his eyes. “Can it Cas, just shove it up your feathery ass. Not even my own brother believes me. I don’t need my ex best friend doing the same.” He says harshly, causing Castiel to widen his eyes at the elder Winchester. Castiel took a step forward, glaring at Dean.
“Sam, you’re probably gonna think this is crazy, but the monster is-” Dean started, easing into getting to the point. Then he heard someone else coming down the stairs. Before Dean could react, his knife was cast out of his hand by Castiel.
Castiel sighed, looking down to where Dean had. His chest was filled with a bundle of human emotions. He detected jealousy, anger, sadness, guilt, and a tiny pang of happiness that Dean had shared something so hard to share. “Too many…” He finally answered. Dean let out a tsk and and looked up, blinking away incoming tears. Why was he so emotional? He remembered a time when in an argument discussing his feelings he wouldn’t even shed a tear. But now he was finding it hard not to.
What was he thinking?
Mark glanced at Dean again, rolling his eyes as he was flipped off and Dean purposefully got closer. “Look, this message is a little fuzzy. But the gist of it is ‘If you ever wanna see your angel again, I suggest you look where there are no people, a place long abandoned to conceal my death-like stench.’ or something like that. It’s fuzzy, like I said. Very formal text.” Mark says with a huff. “Now can I leave? I have a meeting to get to. And I would very much like to not be annoyed when I go in.” Mark sneered, his hands clenching into aggravated fists.
Spencer also eyed him threateningly all night, but at this point Dean has learned to ignore it. Sam was just uncomfortable with the energy in the room. He went to bed first. They had all discussed the case during dinner. No one at the party showed any reaction to the silver, no reaction to the salt at the doorway, the holy water they served, nada. So they were back to square one.
“Come on Cas, Baby’s outside. We can get you out of here, I’m not leaving you again-” Dean promises, a smile flashed onto his face as Castiel turned to look at him. And instead of a hug, a kiss maybe, he was immediately slapped and slammed against the nearest wall.
Dean looks down at the bottle again, taking a deep breath before he smashed it against the guard rail that kept him from the cliff’s edge. The end of the bottle shattered against the metal, creating a sharp end that he could use however he wanted. The thought kept racing through his head. That it could be over. That he wouldn’t have to go the way he always says. That he can give up now.
“Cas… Just… I’m sorry… I…” Dean scrambled to find the words, looking around the room, tears cascading from his eyes like a water fountain. He sighed sadly and looked down at his hand. “Is he at least a better bottom than me?” Dean asks, his voice breaking. Castiel looks up at him, his eyes confused and his heart hurt at what Dean was saying.
Dean grumbles again as he swings his legs over the side of the bed, tossing the covers off of his lower body, increasing the dread of the inevitable pain he knows he’s going to feel as soon as his feet hit the concrete floor of the bunker. He sighed, looked over at his lamp that was covered in photos at it’s base. All the photos are old, of people lost. People who he’d lost but not by his own fault. Except for one. The one photo is lying face down, as it had gotten too painful to look at every night and every morning. Reminding him of the angel that he’d pushed away.
Castiel blushes and nods, looking down in embarrassment. “Yes he is. He makes time for me. He even brought home flowers for me after his work a few days ago after we started the hunt. I didn’t even expect them.” Castiel smiled, his eyes flashing Sam a look full of endearment for the aforementioned cologne swimmer.
Dean shoved his phone in his pocket as he sighed. Dad was causing trouble back in Lawrence. As always. At least Sammy found himself a nice girlfriend. And hey, he got accepted into Stanford Law. At least he was going places.
Dean wanders over to the map table and takes a seat, grunting in thanks as Sam slides a coffee mug across the table towards him. Dean brings the mug to his lips, taking a second before he sips from the bumble bee pattern covered mug.
"Lucifer, I doubt he is a mute. However I would appreciate it if you wouldn't speak of our employees this way. We wouldn't have what we do if we did not have them." Castiel scolded, earning an eye roll and a groan from 'Lucifer'.
Dean chuckled as he entered his workplace twenty minutes earlier than usual. It was just how any night was going to go. Since he had the 'finest pair of bowlegs' the manager had seen, he was hired on the spot. Apparently the gay men that frequented the bar enjoyed having something to  look at. Dean didn't mind. It was a good job. It paid greatly. And it gave him experience with 'certain' types of customers.
Dean grunts and sighs. “Fine. I’ll stick around. With that recent murder we should be able to find some connections anyway.” He says, beating around the bush that was the issue. But when Dean looked back at Castiel, he almost smiled, seeing Castiel’s pearly whites flashing back at him as he was relieved that Dean wasn’t going to truly leave.
Spencer growled, shoving Sam off of him and slamming him against the wall. Sam slumped to the floor in a heap, coughing up a slight bit of blood from his tussle with the man, or monster. One of the two.
Dean spends a good five minutes behind Baby’s wheel, holding his face in his hands. When did this happen? He finds himself asking. When did Cas move on? How is this guy so much better than him and Dean barely even knows the guy? He doesn’t know. And he doesn’t want to. It hurts enough as it is.
Dean forces another smile onto his face as he nods towards the group, turning around and walking away. Dean tried not to make his steps hurried, but he couldn’t help it. He almost ran to the Impala, to the comfort of her drivers seat.
“Yes, Cas, I did. Now are we starting on this barbeque food? I know somebody’s gonna cook on the grill when the party actually starts. But is there anything else?” Dean asks. Castiel again tilts his head.
Dean looks back towards Mark, walking over and sitting on the edge of the desk. He picks up one of the Norse Mythology books and opens it up. He notices a dog-eared page and flips the book open to that page. On that chapter in which was titled ‘Monsters; undead and otherwise’ had a picture that reminded Dean very much of how Spencer had looked when he had attacked him.
The very last thing Dean wanted was for Spencer to hurt Cas beyond what Dean or Cas himself could repair, and for Cas to hate Dean for the rest of his existence. That was the biggest fear running rampant through Dean’s mind. If he didn’t have self control he would have started the car already, and sped off to Chuck knows where and probably screwed up Sam’s tracking.
"Enough, Alastair."  Castiel called after Alastair's behavior, his voice deepening as he scolded him.
Dean 1, Cologne-guy 0.
Castiel’s eyes immediately darkened the rest of the way, and he grasped at the hem of Dean’s shirt, pulling it up and over his head. He moved his hands to Dean’s waist, and his grace to Dean’s crotch. “Turn around,” Castiel huskily commands. Dean blushed brightly and nodded, turning his body and pressing himself against the wall. Dean used his hands to brace himself against the wall, waiting for what Castiel had planned for him.
Dean chuckled. “Maybe a bit of garlic, pepper, and a side piece to keep me going.” Dean says back, taking the last burger and laying it on the plate he had the burgers on. Mark eyed Dean for a moment, smirking.
Dean rolled his eyes and shoved the photo in Sam’s face. “You wanted proof? You got it. Now are you with me or not?” Dean asks, letting Sam take the photo in his hands after Dean had shoved it towards him. Sam blinked a few times, looking at the photo confused.
“Yes, Sam! So at least we know what the hell hurts him.” Dean expressed, pulling his collar back up and letting his hands fall to his sides. “Sam, the message fits Spencer too. ‘Stay away, if you value your life’, Spencer wanted me away from Cas. So he took that victim and decided to leave me a message while he was at it. Sam, his nails are freaking long! And they hurt like a bitch!” Dean expresses, holding up a finger and pointing it at Sam as he spoke. Sam rolled his eyes and continued pacing.
Dean grumbled and sighed. “Alright well, I’ll go check the perimeter, check to see if the monster left anything behind.” He excuses, walking away from the two without another word. As he slowed in his run walk away, he could still hear Sam and Castiel’s conversation.
Mark swallows harshly, glaring into Dean’s fearfully intense and unmoving eyes. He had two options here, and Dean seemed to be dead serious. Either he can live his life as an asshole after helping him out once more, or he can die at this man’s hands. Seemed like the best answer was obvious.
Castiel’s shoulders untensed for a moment, almost like he’d forgotten all about Spencer and the rest of the party. And he’d gotten hyper-focused on Dean and his activities. Especially that he was flirting. “Dean, you don’t know him. How do you know if he could be the monster or not?” Castiel tried. Dean shrugged, rolling his eyes.
Before Dean could make a break for the door, Mark turned his head and smirked at Dean. “Leaving so soon? I was about to make breakfast, it’s the least I can offer you.” Mark says, turning around and walking to the fridge to grab what looked like vegan eggs. Dean rolled his eyes. No thanks. He wasn’t against vegans per say, but he didn’t understand how they could resist eating meat.
So when they came tumbling into the bunker, Dean knew he was in for another lecture by Castiel as the angel healed him.
Sam grunts, looking up at his brother’s plight. His eyes glanced to Castiel, wondering how he could just stand there, even after attacking Dean and let Spencer nearly kill him. He didn’t know what it was that was holding Castiel back, but he had to fight it.
“Cas, I don’t understand. I was just doing some harmless flirting. You know, what you and Spencer should be doing? Keeping up the ‘act’ for everyone?” Dean reminds, gesturing towards the man in question who was giving him a strong death glare.
Dean circled around the perimeter of the building and walked into the library, immediately noticing the large group of students ‘studying’ around the YA section. He rolled his eyes, “Yeah, go enjoy your twilight while I’m trying to save you from something much scarier than a sparkly vampire.” He grumbled under his breath, getting a harsh ‘SHH!’ from a nearby librarian with the tip of the nose glasses and all. Dean rolled his eyes and made his way up the stairs, spotting the section that said in big, bold letters ‘History and Myths’.
“You’re really trying that again? Damn, you are strong willed. Or maybe it’s the feelings of love you have for that pathetic hunter, hm? You do love him don’t you?” Spencer sneered, visibly getting on his knees in front of Castiel and tilting his chin up.
Dean forces the tears down for just a little longer as he shoves Sam off of him and hardens his glare. “Why can’t you believe your own brother, for once?” He jabs back, before he stomps away from the building, leaving two broken men and two shattered relationships behind.
Granted, Castiel probably wouldn’t have believed him with how angry he had come down the stairs believing Spencer’s fake sob story, but still. It would have been nice to know.
A sudden surge of pain to Dean's ass had him yelping in surprise, and made him turn his head in shock.
“Don’t worry, these are my back-up. There, in the tan trenchcoat is my partner, agent Beyonce. And the other two are trainees. Their first big case.” He insists, a smile on his face as he fake introduced the three. Spencer, to say the least, was not happy that Dean referred to Castiel as his ‘partner’ in any sense of the word, and you could physically see his jaw clench. This little action caused Dean to smirk. Any act of rebellion was worth it.
In the corner of the room was a mirror and a dresser in between two windows. In the center of the room was a white comforter covered bed. Dean grumbled softly. Copycat, he thought.  He ventured deeper into the room and spies on the right wall, a door. He assumed it to be the closet. Castiel didn’t seem to change his clothing much. Dean hadn’t changed what he was wearing most of the time he’d stayed here. Just a change of jacket here and there and then the FBI suit he had to wear.
Sam widened his eyes as they met with Castiel’s, immediately turning towards Spencer and punching him in the face. “Dean!” He called, pushing Spencer against the wall as the two erupted into hand-to-hand combat. Sam only had the advantage due to the element of surprise. Had he not had that, he knew he could have ended up like those victims with their heads crushed.
As soon as Dean is out of the guy’s apartment he remembers. He didn’t drive the Impala here. Shit.
“Oh I’m not shackling myself to anyone. I choose you, Dean. And don’t worry about Spencer. He cheated first.” Castiel smirked, his eyes blown wide with lust as his mouth attached itself to Dean’s neck, and Dean moaned Cas’s name, his hands finding Castiel’s shoulders and gripping tightly.
What had even happened? All he remembered was running off to get away from Sam and from Cas, his breathing getting shallow and restricted, his chest beginning to hurt, the officer… Then it clicked. Dean cursed and put his head in his free hand. All he was doing was causing himself more pain by being here. By trying to be ‘happy’ for Cas. Well he’s not. 100 points to Captain Obvious.
“Cas… why am I here?” He asks, looking at the angel questioningly. Castiel’s eyes traveled and looked into Dean’s, making him sigh once more.
Spencer smiles back, and it’s obvious he wants to claw Dean’s face off. He takes his hand away and nods his head in understanding. “Well, this is Castiel and I’s bedroom.” Spencer clarifies, enunciating the I very sarcastically. Dean nods and plays along.
Castiel sighed and nodded, shrugging slightly. Dean could feel the awkward tension was thick between them. Sam or Dean could cut it with a knife. “It’s quite alright, Dean. I understand that you needed your space.” Castiel assures, his body moving a little closer to Spencer.
Castiel nodded, pulling away from Spencer and pulling out the lore book he had been reading. “We were able to find more information on their connection. Each of the victims had family ties. Thor had a sister, who was the first victim. His son was the second. But what is weird is that the third was a stray cousin. No immediate family ties.” Castiel suggests. Sam nods in consideration, pulling out a few of the documents he’d been able to find and collect.
“Dean, what are you doing?” Castiel asks, his glare firm and almost jealous, again. Dean’s expression didn’t change, and he just looked even more confused at Castiel.
“Cas… You love Spencer, don’t shackle yourself to me-” Dean tried after clearing his throat. Something began to fester inside of Dean, and it felt oh so familiar. Dean felt Castiel’s grace stroking him inside his clothed entrance. He immediately stopped, covering his face to prevent from moaning. Castiel smirked, leaning closer into Dean’s ear and where hickeys remained from Mark.
“Yeah, yeah Sam just track his phone damn it!” Dean ranted, looking back towards the road after giving Sam an intense glare. Sam held his hands in the air and rolled his eyes. He too, was tired of Dean’s bullshit. He starts typing in his computer, zeroing in on Cas’s location.
Though he was scared, Dean filed out of the motel room and stopped where Castiel stopped. Then the angel turned around and glared at Spencer. “What is your problem? Must you insult Dean every chance that you get? I asked you specifically to. Let. It. Go. But you have proven that you haven’t. That you have lied to me. Genealogy is something considered as a last resort, as well as blood type yes, but it by no means is a worthless piece of evidence. Now with this evidence, plus yours, I know that Dean needs to stay with us.” Castiel insists, making Dean’s pupils dilate with surprise.
“Thank you Dean. I assure you this won’t be the last time I take you, especially when Sam can hear.” Castiel winked, smirking as he buttons Dean’s jeans, followed by his own. Dean was still somewhat panting, beginning to lean towards Castiel again. Castiel smiled and pulled Dean close once more, cupping his cheek.
So Dean did the only thing he knew how to do, even in his current state of mind; He drove.
Castiel put a hand on Dean’s leg, trying to level with him. “Dean… you were crying. In your sleep. Do you know how concerning that is? That you have fallen so far that you’ve resorted to releasing your feelings while your body is unconscious?” He asks. Dean moves his leg so that Castiel’s hand moves away from him. Castiel again exhales as he looks back at Dean, questioning him and his well-being.
Mark chuckled again and leaned back, standing at the foot of the bed. He tugged off his jeans with a hungry lust and looked down at Dean hungrily. “Flip, I want to make you feel extra good.” He teases in a whisper.
“Yeah, talk soon.” Dean says, his cheeks still red from the ordeal. He waved at Mark for a moment before Castiel turned him to face the angel. Dean raised a confused eyebrow, his stomach full of butterflies beginning to sink as he’s reminded again of what he lost. What he does to relationships.
Before Castiel, Dean hadn’t been out as a bisexual. He’d been a strict women only kind of man for a long time. Though occasionally, when he didn’t plan on going on another hunt for a few days, he’d try a guy just to see how it felt. But after he met Cas, those feelings spiked. And he could no longer just get by with the occasional one-nightstand with a guy. Or the occasional masturbation session. No, he was in the shower with the dial almost always turned to the cold side when Castiel was around.  But now with everything that had happened, well Dean still found Castiel incredibly attractive. He found himself fantasizing in his wet dreams. As embarrassing as that is.
Dean pushed it off as Castiel partially wanting Dean to shut up about being a terrible bottom, quarter him wanting to show Dean just how good of a bottom he was and that he still loved him, and half that he wanted to get back at Spencer. Dean partially smiled at the last part. He never took the angel for the revenge type. Maybe Dean had rubbed off on him.
When Dean returns to his motel room, all he can think is to run. To go home. Drink himself silly. His mind is running a mile a minute with all of his exploded feelings trying to recollect themselves into the bottle that he’d always been hiding them in. Tears gush down from his eyes and he just cannot seem to make them stop. He feels almost one with the heavy and the harsh rain that pounds down on the windshield of the Impala. Dean can barely breathe again, but he refuses to pass out.
Then started the louder moaning, the distant calling of a name, and soon he could recognize the voice was Spencer. And Dean’s heart dropped. Cas was having sex with Spencer. Dean couldn’t say he was surprised. Cas and Dean had only been together for two weeks before Castiel wanted to try sex. Since he wanted to pleasure Dean as much as possible. The thought of the memory now made Dean’s heart ache. And made his stomach feel like it was being filled with heavier and heavier rocks.
“So it’s like that, huh? Best friend and unrequited love?” Mark asks, closing up his burger and setting his plate up with some chips as his eyes watch Dean, waiting for his answer.
Mark took the sticky note into his hand, and grabbed one of the books Dean had set in front of him. Dean raised an eyebrow at him, his expression still firm and angry. “Last time you barely needed a minute. What’s so different about this one that you need a reference?” Dean asked, snarling lowly. Mark snapped his gaze towards Dean and glared at him.
Castiel sighed once more. “Dean, this needs to stop. You need help for this. It isn’t healthy-” Castiel started again, and at once Dean snaps his gaze towards Castiel.
Castiel scowled. "Alastair. I would appreciate it if you don't shop among my employees. You know I don't condone your human trafficking practices your family endorses." Castiel sneered at the new person in the room.
“S-sorry Cas… I didn’t mean to interrupt anything… Just these ol’ nightmares have a mind of their own…” Dean jokes, wiping his eyes and looking away again. The weight of Castiel slightly on his legs still sent part of Castiel’s buzzing touch through him, even if it was slight.
Dean grunts and looks at Sam with a wild rage. One he was only familiar with when he had the mark. “Cas is your contact?” He asks in disbelief, blinking a few times in that same emotion. “Hell yeah I wouldn’t have come! I wouldn’t have wasted so much gas to come up here just to have to turn back!” Dean growled, forcing Sam’s hand away from the shift.
Dean rolled his eyes away from Castiel as he mentioned Spencer. Of course he did, more people to show Castiel off to. Though that move is something Dean would have done as well, he wouldn’t deny that. “Maybe he just wants to be thorough, ‘monster could be anybody.” Dean says sarcastically, looking away from Castiel as he set up his last chair.
Dean slowly stood back up, using the dresser as something to hold onto and to steady his wobbling legs. His ass was screaming at him, and Dean didn’t like it one bit. He guessed that was his punishment for doing this in the first place. Idiot.
Dean could again remember a time when he’d smirk and begin to whistle when he heard those noises coming from another room. Especially when he and Sam would get separate motel rooms and he could hear Sam’s bed frame banging against the wall. But now, all it did was increase his want to shrivel up, his memory of his mistake, and amplify his regret that he ruined everything between him and Castiel.
Alastair grinned. "And besides, you gotta admit he's got such a nice-" Alistair began to purr again and bring his hand to Dean's ass.
A hand landed on Dean’s shoulder and he immediately turned around, grabbing the hand tightly. When Dean looked around however, his chest began to lighten. And his heart fluttered. The man who put his hand on Dean’s shoulder chuckled deeply, and flashed his bright and striking blue eyes at Dean. Damn this man was gorgeous, Dean noted. The man had pitch black hair, and his cheekbones were nestled high on his face. His eyes definitely suggested asian descent. And the suit he wore suggested a businessman. Dean was hooked just by his face.
Dean rolled his eyes, following Castiel and doing as he did. “Cas you know me. I get my four hours then I’m good. Don’t need any more than that.” He says, unfolding the first chair and setting it up before moving onto the second. Castiel rolled his eyes, pulling out the phone Dean had given him long before the fall out.
“Spencer, you of all people know that I am an angel. Not many things can harm me. Plans are good, yes, that was a valid point, but when there are people on the crime scene, it is harder to actually gather evidence. With the presence of other people, I doubt our monster will strike in the same place twice.” Castiel assures his boyfriend, who rolls his eyes and looks away.
Dean groaned. This. This was the person.
“Come on, you’ve been cleared.” the officer huffed, walking in and uncuffing Dean from the wall. Dean grumbled, rubbing his wrist as he walked out of the cell, ignoring his brother’s gaze. He knew exactly what he was going to do as soon as he was out of this place. He didn’t care about the hunt anymore. He was going home. He was going to smash some vampires faces in and go back to the bunker. Sam could find his own way home.
“What is with this language? Are we dealing with, I dunno, Loki’s scorned younger brother or some shit?” Dean asks, shrugging his shoulders as he hands Sam the phone with the photo lit up on the screen. As he looks at Castiel, Dean notices Spencer glaring at him for his comment. Great, so this guy still believed in the norse gods? Was he really offended by Dean’s comment? Seriously?
“Every night.” Dean corrects. “I have them every night. With the added memory of when I screwed up with you and seeing Sammy die in front of me, losing both of you, you have your answer for my unconscious tears!” Dean exclaimed, glaring at Castiel with a hard, and desperate stare. He wanted Castiel to understand. To maybe get him to maybe share something of his own.
Hey guys, Sorry this one is short and late. Life happens. I wasn't feeling too hot yesterday. And this one was kind of a catch-all chapter anyway. Hope you like it though.
Dean’s eyes glanced over at Castiel warily, knowing he was going to read farther into his attitude, his actions, trying to be his therapist. At least, that’s how he felt.
Dean nodded, slightly annoyed. “Then what the hell are we still standing here for? Let’s go.” Dean hissed at Sam, beginning to make his way towards the exit, but not before getting a second ‘shush’ thrown his way.
“Would you shut up?! I’m trying to feed in peace here and you certainly aren’t helping! The world will be a much better place once you aren’t around to ruin my plans-” Spencer sneers, leaning into Dean’s neck, and almost turning his head completely around. His teeth were bared against Dean’s throat, like he was going to suck his blood like a freaking vamp. Oh hell no.
Dean sighed a bit, biting the inside of his cheek nervously. He didn't want to give out his feelings. He didn’t feel like giving gag gifts. “No Sammy...  Sure the idea crossed my mind but, no I didn’t do anything.” Dean assures, slightly lying. Well he still broke the bottle, thought about it very seriously. He was only still alive right now, he considered, because Castiel still cared even after Dean had scorned him.
Kelly flipped her hair behind her shoulder seductively towards Benny. "Well I just slept with the boss last night. Paid me nicely. I probably made enough money to cover all three of your salaries for the week. See what you're missing Benny?" She flirts, blowing him a kiss.
Castiel sighed, gasping again once Spencer let go and flexed his hands. He looked back over at Castiel like he was trash, like he was just another pawn to him. “You really want this Castiel? You want me to put this spell over you again like a child that needs to behave rather than being the mature one and helping me out? I can help you in return. I can get dear ol’ Dean to love you again, run straight back into your arms and he’d never leave.” Spencer offers, smirking at Castiel and at his offer.
“Dean, you are worth my grace. These near end of the world experiences that you’ve stopped are proof of that Dean. These problems are started sometimes in part by you but we work together to fix them-” Castiel starts, caressing Dean’s cheek. Dean smacks Castiel’s hand away and looks away from him, squeezing his eyes shut.
Dean sighed, cursing his nervous, shaking hands. "Its nothing, Benny. I just don't like the private room. You know that." He sighed, and gripped the bottle's neck with one hand, supporting the base with the other.
Sam rolled his eyes again. “Dean, calm down man. Please. We’re gonna find him. I promise. I just gotta focus on this translator thing. Maybe see if you can find anything inside? A book, maybe?” Sam asks with his puppy eyes again. Dean curses and rolled his eyes.
“No Cas. He really isn’t. He’s been kind of kicking himself for the past six months. You should have seen him…” Sam started, but Dean couldn’t stand there and listen to his closest family talk behind his back anymore. So he almost started running immediately.
Dean whistled a bit as he opened the front door, heaving the couple heavy books he’d borrowed from the library inside and into the living room. Dean huffed as he dropped the books onto the coffee table, earning an expected thud at how heavy they were. Huge Norse mythology textbooks. Great. Better to get into it now than later. And better to find out now if somehow Loki can make himself come back to life and Dean and Sam have to break the news about Gabriel being off somewhere and completely inaccessible to the demi-god.
Sam sighed, gripping the silver knife in his hand. He raised it to show Dean, his eyes widened in shock. “What the hell Dean? You threw a bloody freaking knife at me! What’s gotten you so tense?” Sam asks, holding the knife away from Dean. Dean grumbled, reaching up and trying to grab the knife frantically away from Sam.
"Sammy? What… why are you callin' me from Dad's cell? He'd kill you if he found out." Dean hissed, making sure to keep an eye on his surroundings.
Dean gulped, sipping his beer again as he fought with the tears in the backs of his eyes. Spencer chuckled. “Really? That’s all I have to say to break you? Remind you of what you did? How much you hurt him? Fine. You broke him so bad, Dean. He didn’t even try to kiss me until our fourth month of dating. All because of what you did!” He snarled, shoving Dean against the fridge again as Dean tried to walk away.
Behind him, a man with a fading hairline, a skinny chin and a goatee looked at him almost hungrily. He snickered and chuckled. He then began speaking in a language that Dean could hardly understand. But he could pick up that it was Latin.
Dean watched longingly across the yard, watching Spencer and Castiel laugh, while Spencer tried to coax Castiel into eating a strawberry. The neighbors around them laughed, but Dean could barely hear their conversations. He didn’t know what they were talking about, but he knew it had to be some of that fake suburban family crap.
Dean sighed once more, blowing a puff of air out of his nose and taking the plate. "Got it." He says, carrying the plate across the bar towards the designated table.
As he stalked up the walkway, he couldn’t help but overhear Sam and Castiel talking. “So… how is he? Is he treating you right?” Sam asks Castiel, seemingly talking about the cologne swimmer. Dean quickened his pace, trying to not have to hear much of the conversation.
“Ngh… Come on Cas,” Dean chuckled slightly. “You know I like it a little painful,” Dean reminds, looking back at the angel currently inside him. Castiel chuckled, and almost pulled out.
Dean narrowed his eyes and looked up at Castiel, he then opened his mouth to speak. But Castiel beat him to it. “I know you, Dean. You may not think that I do, but I have seen every part of your soul. I knew this would be something you would do.” He says, flipping a page.
Dean looked through the books, trying to see if there were any norse mythological creature books. His finger scanned over the titles as he squinted his eyes trying to read them. He didn’t know how anybody could find what they were looking for with the titles so small. After a good few moments he picked out a few books about Norse mythology and it’s fair share of creatures and monsters.
That smile was fueling him, Dean decided. If he could get Castiel to smile, then he knew it was worth it. That he was making the right decision. He just hoped Spencer wouldn’t chase him away first.
As soon as the door was closed, Dean didn't waste any time hurrying down the stairs and back into the bar area. Dean gasped and panted once he found himself near the bar again, leaning against it.
“The name is Mark, by the way. I own Morgan Corporations.” Mark introduces in an almost seductive tone, like he was trying to see how Dean would react to it. React to it Dean did. In his head though. In his head, he was panicking and wondering how the hell he could be attracted to this guy, Especially when he wasn’t ready to be in a relationship again, etc.
Castiel firms his glare at Dean, blowing a hard puff of air out of his nose. “Dean, please. He’s new at hunting.” Castiel tries. Dean grumbles, again looking down at his sleeve and the counter.
“DEAN!!” He yelled. “Spencer literally covered for you! Show some kind of gratitude, man. This is getting out of hand.” Sam says with a sigh. “Why can’t you just believe that for once, Cas is happy?” Sam asks. Dean stops, and he glares at Sam, his chest beginning to tighten again as he felt the stab of Sam’s words. So he wasn’t ever truly happy with him? Sounds about right.
“Dean, you have been my first, and my only partner that I have slept with. I would not lie to you. I was with Sam at the time. I had gotten the food you requested. So he was not having sex with me.” Castiel says. Dean looks up from the floor. He sighed, squeezing his eyes shut.
Sam sighed. “Dean, you promised me you’d give the guy an hour.” Sam protests, feeling fed up with Dean’s excuses.
Benny sighed. "Well, your phone kept ringing off the hook when you left it here. Since you had such a rough night, I'll let you take an early night off. Go ahead, call whoever needed to speak to ya so badly. Just don't be late tomorrow. Ya hear?" He teases, smirking at Dean.
“Fuck Spencer! I ain’t talking about him! I’m talking about how this whole--fiasco! Was just a ruse from you and my ass of a brother to try and force me to move on! Well guess what?! I AIN’T READY!! I haven’t been! Ever! Why can’t either of you believe me when I was literally struggling to breathe because you two couldn’t keep your damn conversations at home!” He yelled at Cas, his shoulders hunching and his face growing redder with each passing second.
“Hey, Dean, right? Cas had told me a lot about you.” Spencer says, using what Dean could tell was a fake grin. Fake asshole, Dean thought. “And your brother Sam, of course. About your hunts together.” Spencer clarifies, standing at the door, almost not letting Dean in.
“Because that motel is known for break-ins. And besides, he’s my friend. I wasn’t going to risk him killing himself with one of his guns he carries or by some other means. You need to understand that I have more people in my life than just you. Why are you surprised I am concerned about one of my friends?” Castiel asks, staring almost literal daggers at Spencer.
“You know, I really thought hiring Mark to try and get you the Hel away from Cas I really thought that it would work. Being that you were so desperate for someone to give a damn.” The voice that entered the room was immediately recognizable. It was fucking Spencer.
Spencer entered the room with a smile on his face, and he pushed against his glasses that he wore. He leaned against the counter, making room for Castiel. Castiel seemed less cheery than he was before. Dean immediately regretted his decision to give in to his harsh thoughts.
When he didn’t get a response, Spencer moved his hand and offered it to Sam. Sam took it hesitantly, introducing himself, but he wasn’t heard by Dean. Now Dean could barely even hear anything. His thoughts were drowning out every sense he had.
“Thank you again. We shall call you or your partner if we receive any news of any more murders.” The officer assures, before he walks off, leaving Dean to turn around and begin to discuss the new evidence with his ‘partners’.
Dean rolled his eyes. "Hey Gabe. I don't got time for you today. Apparently I got assigned four damn tables. So no sparing today." He quips, snickering as Gabriel groaned drunkily.
Castiel turned his head and shoved Dean’s hand back towards him. “Really Dean? A phone number, how is that not what it looks like?” Castiel snarls, hurt and betrayal in his eyes. This made Dean confused. Didn’t Cas want him to move on? Stop being so hung over on Cas? Well he was trying. Now what did he want? Why did he look so upset besides the fact that he was gone all night? Maybe it was just worry, Dean hoped.
Sam clears his throat, finally easing the tension between the two. Dean sighed in relief, looking down. He was trying so hard to do this for Castiel. To be happy for him. But it was proving to be a much harder task than he thought. “So… Tell us about the case. You’ve been on the case for longer, so you should have more information than us.” Sam assumed.
“No Dean I am… quite fine.” Castiel lied, images running through his head of Dean shirtless, bent over and begging, pleading. Images of Dean being fucked under him and Dean taking all of it in stride--Castiel had to immediately shake his head. His problem was going to get worse if he kept thinking like that.
“No, No Sam you gotta listen. I don’t care if you believe me or not.” Dean starts, beginning to rant before Sam looked Dean in the eyes with his own worried ones.
Dean immediately tries to take his hand away from Castiel, being unsuccessful in the task since Castiel was much, much stronger than him, “Cas please it’s not what it looks like-! Let me go Cas-!” Dean called out, trying to take his hand back.
“Cas… don’t play dumb. I heard you guys. Two days ago. I came back early from the library. I heard Spencer moaning. I put the pieces together. Just tell me that. Please.” Dean begged, looking into Castiel’s eyes again with a desperate look. Castiel looks down at Dean’s feet, then he turns his head back up towards Dean.
Dean wandered yet again to the bar. Benny didn't have any more orders ready yet, so it would be a minute before he'd have to deal with any more pathetic advances.
Dean reached into the couch where he’d stashed the knife and swung it back behind him at Spencer. And all of a sudden Spencer cried out in pain as Dean jerked the knife back. Dean turned around and looked at Spencer, who was holding his now bleeding shoulder with a large gash that seemed to grow larger and larger as his skin and eyes turned back to normal. What the hell even was this guy?
“Well you could at least teach him what he needs to look for. Not damn blood types. Vamps and monsters do not care what flipping blood you got rushing through you, just that you got some.” Dean huffs in a less harsh tone. This was finally him. The hunter that Dean knew. At least now he could focus on the hunt and not how Castiel looked at him so pitifully.
Dean immediately misses Castiel’s hand’s presence on his shoulder, giving him a sinking feeling. But he didn’t let it show, and he maintained his smile. “Of course Cas. Make sure you pick me up a burger. Extra cheese.” He teases. Sam rolled his eyes and turned around, starting to head to the cars. Spencer hung behind though. He glared at Dean for a moment, his eyes flaring red once more before he turned around and followed behind Castiel. Dean narrowed his eyes and smirked.
Dean turned his face away again, and continued in his run. Then he did something he wasn’t proud of.
Dean grumbled and threw his hands up into the air. “You know what? Fine. I’ll go save Cas from this asshole by myself. Thanks a lot, Sam.” Dean growled before he left the room in a huff. Dean slammed the door behind him, and immediately groaned from the smell re-entering his nose.
Meanwhile, Dean was still struggling against Spencer’s supernatural strength. His legs tried their hardest to kick or move, but he was unsuccessful. Spencer’s hand in which he held the knife raised and aimed at Dean’s chest. “Finally, I can cut away the loose strand that’s been annoying me since you got here. Your death is the piece of the puzzle I’m missing. Now I can finally get it, then no one can undo my spell on your precious angel-” Spencer teases, his hand then seemingly starting to thrust down and stab Dean in the chest.
Dean’s body slumped to the floor in a heap, soon after being engulfed in a tight hold. Dean forced his eyes open and looked up to see Castiel holding him tenderly. “Dean,” Castiel panted. “ Dean honey please, stay with me.” Castiel begged, his hand pressing two fingers to Dean’s forehead in a weak attempt to use any of his leftover grace to heal his lover. He unfortunately could not heal him entirely, just the smallest scrapes and bruises. Castiel’s eyebrows tilted upward and he held Dean closer to him, whispering a prayer in enochian.
“Dude! Those cost like, 40 bucks!” Sam exclaimed, looking at Dean in shock.
“Dean, you don’t need it. Why would you even need it? Wait… Dean is… Are you bleeding?” Sam asks, looking at Dean’s chest where Spencer had cut him. Dean rubbed his forehead and looked at Sam in a sarcastic manner.
Dean began to pick up what he could of his things, before a familiar face came into the living room. Mark rushed over to Dean, confused as to what was going on. “Hey… Hey Dean what are you doing?” Mark asks, moving Dean’s shoulder and making him look at him. Dean shoved Mark’s hands off, no matter how soothing he found them.
Sam raised an eyebrow at his brother. “Buncombe County. In Asheville Carolina?” He reminds, holding his mug of now colder coffee close to his lips. Dean had been forgetting things recently. At first Sam wanted to shrug it off. But now that it became such a consistent occurrence, he couldn’t ignore it.
Spencer came down the stairs behind him, smirking slightly as he buttoned his shirt, like he planned on going to work. Castiel came into the living room fuming, his eyes hinting at a glaring blue. He looked at Sam, and gestured for him to leave with his head. Sam gave Cas a very confused look, glancing over at Spencer, who had on a shoulder brace. Typical for him to make it worse than it was.
Spencer then turns around, Castiel’s vision slowly improving. As Spencer begins to formulate the spell ingredients, Castiel can hear the distinct banging of a fist on metal. And the stomping of feet. Castiel’s heart, although Jimmys and not his, began to pound with hope. The sounds began to get closer, making Spencer scowl.
Dean walked up onto the line of motel rooms, making his way towards the one doorway surrounded by police tape, when he sees his motel keys he’d left on the rug the previous night had been moved, and were beside the rug instead. He, very confused, picks them up and looks up, seeing his motel room door slightly ajar. Dean presses against the wood of the door, and peeks inside his room. When he does, he sees smashed bottles, flipped over furniture, and a torn apart bed. Dean blinks a few times as he stares into the room. Someone had tried to look for something in his room. Someone who had probably been there not too long before.
Dean throws the pillow back at Sam and scratches his eyes while sitting in the bed. “Dude, what the hell?” At the same time, he looks around and gets very confused.
“Come, Dean. Let me show around my home, well, our home now.” He grabs Dean’s hands and invites him to walk into the road with him. He’s excited to show Dean all the work he’d done with Jack here.
“What?” Dean gets out of his initial shock, and lets go of the door he was still holding. He stares at Fancy Sam.
, made him
They stared at each other for a few seconds first, holding their breaths cause it was just too much to handle. Dean feels so anxious that he could explode at any second, Cas on the other hand seems peacefully happy, but a little bit shy.
“Shut up, Sammy.” Dean tries to hide that he’s really enjoying the situation, but obviously he’s not  being that good at it. “So now what?”
close. They won't stop touching each other and kind of flirting.
Dean smiles when he sees Cas reaching for his hand. When they touch, it feels so right, feels like home.
“Forget the beanie Dean! How could you have seen Jared? Last time we just… took their places.”  Sam picks up his phone again and starts calling Cas.
Sam does not look amused at all.
He could just feel it wasn't Cas, not real Cas anyway, so they didn't have a connection, but then it made him imagine how would feel
They get out of the room and head to the closest elevator, the corridor has good quality carpets, fancy art on the walls and smells really nice, nothing like the motels that they’re used to. Sam observes everything trying to get a hint of what is going on while Dean is just dazzled with all this luxury.
He was definitely not prepared for that. There he was, the man that until a few minutes ago he still thought he had lost forever.
“Jesus fucking christ he’s showing his crotch to fake cas,
Dean looks like he’s offended by that commentary.
“Tell me what?” Cas is feeling…hope. After all the shame he felt, he knows what’s coming,
Sam starts getting frustrated and puts the phone away. He looks around in the closet to see if he can find anything useful.
After the hug the two are alone in the room and Dean can’t stop staring at Cas. After this whole thing with Misha today, he had finally realized that the thing he always felt when Cas was around him was not just brotherly love, it was…
Dean gets out of bed and looks through the window, it is not a view he recognises.
? Jesus, Jackles. You even dressed up for me didn't you.” Misha has a weird smile on his face, Dean thinks it's kinda sexy but shakes this feeling right away.
“I know, weird.” Dean waits to see if the phone call will work, but Sam nods when the call is not completed. “Maybe it is different now. Last time was a spell, right? What could it be now? Cas? Jack?”
“What you should do is quit drinking at conventions Jensen!” Jared laughs again.
“I can’t believe Chuck is still doing this crap.” He starts walking in the opposite direction. “And just cause he is God he can’t zap us to fucking Rome to go to a CONVENTION whenever he feels like it.”
“Shit.” He shoves the phone into Sam’s pocket. “Also i just met fake you in the bathroom. And he was wearing a beanie.”
. Like...
, a simple human. Hell, I never even thought you could love someone like that, I thought you felt things differently because you’re a goddamn angel.” He smiles to himself. “I can see things more clearly here in heaven now. And I feel so fucking stupid because i panicked after you told me that. Dammit I didn’t even prayed to you because I couldn’t admit it to myself. I was lost, Cas. All I wanted was you there with me. I wanted to tell you what i couldn’t say that night.”
“A parallel universe, yeah I already got that” He shows Dean his phone with an article about “Jibcon” on the screen. “Apparently that Jared Padalecki dude is very busy in this universe.”
----------------------------------------------------
“Yep. As you can see now, this is definitely not the bunker.” Dean reaches for his gun while Sam is stating the obvious. “Yeah, I already did that. Our stuff is not here”.
----------------------------------------------------
“Are you kidding me? Is this another convention crap?” He rolls his eyes, still looking at the demon look-alikes.
“Tell you that you
Sam picks up a pillow and throws it right into Dean’s face. “I said wake the hell up! Something is going on.”
Cas feels relieved from saying his truth. Dean is the one who’s very confused.
“Dean, wake up!” Again, Sam tries to wake him up but has zero success.
“Dude, are you ok?” Fancy Sam asks, noticing Dean’s confusion. “Are you coming in or what?”
“What?” He says back, confused.
angel. Cas looks surprised with the sudden show of affection, while Sam just giggles and leaves the room.
“I wanted to be there when you arrived, i’m sorry.” He seems nervous, his hands are shaking.  “I was ashamed and scared but I should have been there, I was just not sure you wanted to see me.”
“Ahn.. Yeah, I should… i should go to the..ahn..panel thing i guess” He says while leaving the bathroom.
“Ok Nancy Drew, you do that. I need to take a piss.” He starts walking towards the bathroom while Sam complains about how he could have peed when they were still in the hotel room.
“Hello, Dean.” Cas has a soft smile on his face, but also a concerned look. “I heard you prayer, made it easier to find you guys, good thinking. Are you both ok?” Dean sights, he’s a little embarrassed that Sam now knows about the prayer, but he smiles anyway.
Although it is as cliche as it can be, the kiss
The boys check out most of the hotel, but they can’t find anyone they know, but they do find some people wearing t-shirts with their faces on it, which totally creeps them out. At one point they see Chuck in a corridor, but quickly realize he’s actually fake Chuck when a staff member approaches the man calling him Rob and saying he needs to be somewhere for a closing ceremony.
They watch it for a few more minutes, not really understanding what is going on because one: Jensen is clearly drunk and two: He and Misha, the actor who plays Castiel, seen to be pretty close, like,
He enters the room and sits on the foot of the bed where he slept while he takes off the fake beard and Bobby’s hat. He's tired and doesn't know what to do anymore, he just wants to go back to his damn universe with his normal best friend Cas and forget everything he saw today. Dean doesn't know why he can’t just get those images out of his head.
“Dude, this is awesome. Are we rich now?” He says with a dorky smile on his face while touching every single piece of art that is in his reach until they get to the elevator, Sam just rolls his eyes and ignores him. “That’s why i slept so well. Did you notice the sheets? So comfy! AND THE MATTRESS? Best. Mattress. Ever.”
” That's the only thing Dean managed to get out of his mouth.
“I think we should see if we find someone from our universe, maybe Cas or Jack.” He answers. “Otherwise i have no freaking clue how we’re gonna go back.”
A few minutes later, they walk out of one of the cosplay shops at the convention. Both wearing fake beards. Dressed as Bobby.
“Rome?” He says while furrowing his brows. “Not complaining, I would love a “all you can eat pizza vacation”, but why?” He finds his shoes on the floor and starts putting them on.
Until they hear Cas' voice coming from an auditory. Is a little more high pitched than the voice they’re used to but at this point anything is worth checking out. The place has security guards, so Sam and Dean have to crash the thing without being seen. They hide behind a giant poster of their faces.
“Dude, I think fake you and fake Cas are a
“Tell me about it!” Sam smiles at then, relieved to be back in his own universe.
The boys arrive at the hotel lobby and notice a group of people with black eyes. Luckly they were far away because Dean quickly gets into fight mode and starts walking in they're direction. Sam holds his arm and points to another group of people dressed just like Cas.
“I’m the one who has something to apologize for. You were there and I just couldn’t say anything. I froze. And that’s on me!” His face seems a little more desperate now. “I couldn’t say it back right away because I never… I never thought you could feel that way.”
“I will give them this,” Dean says. “It does
That’s all Cas knows, and honestly, he doesn’t even need to know as much as he does. The only thing Cas needs to know is that this guy, Crowley, is that he’s fulfilling Dean’s sexual desires and making him happy. And whenever Cas asks Dean about it -- about ‘him’ -- the answer is always, ‘Yeah, things are great with Crowley!’. Perfect.
to be doing this right now?”
Ever since getting together, Dean and Castiel have slipped easily into a comfortable, familiar routine. Each night, right around eleven-thirty, Dean will yawn loudly and excuse himself for the evening, Cas will follow behind a few minutes after, Sam’ll do a poor job of feigning blissful ignorance about what his brother and friend are doing (an actor, he is not), Dean and Cas will have sex, and then Dean’ll pass out in the arms of the angel who now quite literally watches over him as he sleeps.
Cas prefers to just call him ‘Dean’s Guy’, although he does have an actual name: Crowley. A strange name, but to be fair, who is ‘Castiel’ to judge? They met via one of those many dating apps several months back. He’s older than Dean by about ten, maybe fifteen years, and he’s British (or is he Scottish? Irish? It’s somewhere in that part of Europe).
Frowning, Dean turns back to the so-called ‘impossible’ burger on the table. He picks it up, scrutinizing it carefully.
The only thing he does know -- and the only thing Cas ever wants and needs to know--  is that Dean is happy and satisfied.
“Thank you.” Castiel shifts in his seat and clears his throat. “So, did you also just come from work?”
“...but that’s just it,” Castiel continues. “I’m not forcing myself to do anything. Because I told you, I do like having intimacy with you, that’s not a lie. But what I like about it is seeing how
God does he love burgers.
want to, I don’t think I’m ever not horny.”
Castiel smiles brightly and nods, as he always does when Dean asks the question. “It’s perfect.”
“Yes, I’m more than aware of that,” Castiel says, chuckling.
“I was being truthful earlier when I said I’m not opposed. Because most of the time, I’m not,” Cas says, shrugging a bit. “However...it’s quite comfortable where we are right now. Like this? Maybe we could just do a little bit more of this until you fall asleep?”
Cas bites down on his lip and swallows. “The burgers. You’re right, there is something different about them, and that’s because...they’re not burgers. Well, not in the traditional sense, that is.”
“I swear, if you say ‘it’s not you, it’s me’, like we’re in some kind of a chick flick right now--”
Frowning, Castiel hesitates before he moves toward Dean and joins him on the bed. Dean throws an arm around Cas’ shoulders, bringing him close. “I need you to be honest with me. Am I doing something wrong here?”
“Of course he’s going to make that assumption, that’s all you and I do, that’s the purpose of all of this!” Dean exclaims, shaking his head as he turns back to Cas. “I’m sorry, this is probably the last thing you needed today.”
“Mr. Crowley,” Cas interrupts, pinching his brow and inhaling deeply. “I was just in extensive surgery for five hours straight. I haven’t slept in twenty-five hours. I smell of brain abscess. Are you
Cas forces a stiff, half-hearted smile as he shuts the front door. “Thank you.”
He says it just as he does after sex, that same hearfelt and sincere declaration that never ceases to make Dean’s heart flutter.
dying, it better be from something a lot more badass than that, or I’m not going.”
enjoy it. How you enjoy me, and how I can satisfy you in the way that you deserve. That means absolutely everything to me, Dean.”
“I must say, this is quite the fortuitous situation,” Crowley begins. “I’ve been wanting to meet you for some time now.”
to eat rabbit food? This is definitely the best option. Nice work, mission 'impossible' complete.”
Castiel winces; he doesn’t get the word out, but it doesn’t take a genius to figure out what he’s trying to say.
And yet, when the doorbell rings late in the morning on a rainy Saturday, who is standing there when Cas opens the door but him. Dean’s Guy.
“No, that’s all.” Castiel eyes Crowley dubiously. “What makes
And as Dean looks up at him and meets his gaze one last time before leaving, Cas sees that warm, beautiful smile on his husband's face, and it's all the assurance that he needs.
So tonight, when Cas walks in the bedroom to join him for their usual evening routine, Dean chooses to address it, blatantly so: “You want this, right?”
Well, maybe a little offended, but he’ll keep that to himself.
To lose Dean once again.
Oh no. Crowley
“It’s Doctor Winchester,” Castiel corrects, which normally, he wouldn’t do. But he just got off of an eleven hour overnight shift in the ER, and he’s more than a little cranky. That, along with the fact that he doesn’t want to be having this encounter whatsoever, of course.
Cas pauses for a moment, a pensive look on his face as he considers. “I’m not opposed.”
“Thank you.” Castiel beams at him, his smile big and bright. And seeing that warm, radiant happiness and satisfaction on Castiel's face? It makes it all worth it for Dean. It’s powerful enough that, for a moment, Dean almost forgets that he’s eating some frankensteined concoction of soy and wheat and not actual meat -- but only for a moment.
“Back here!” Cas calls out.
“But if it’s work you want to talk about so much--” Crowley gestures to the scrub pants that Cas still has on. “--you just got off, didn’t you?”
And it certainly leaves Dean feeling like more than a colossal jerk, especially now that Cas is back in his life after thinking he was gone for good, and especially after all that Cas had been through and miraculously survived. Of course he’s going to be scared to lose it all once again.
“But it
“I’m sorry,” Castiel apologizes again. “But please, know that my intentions were good.”
Normally, Cas didn’t have much of an opinion when it came to lunch and what they had for it. He didn’t really need to eat; he just did it sometimes so it wouldn’t be him just awkwardly sitting and staring while Dean shoveled some deep fried disaster into his mouth and Sam picked at his plate of leaves.
“Anything works,” Dean had told Cas as he handed him some cash. “And by anything, I obviously mean no leaves. None of that rabbit food. Got it?”
“Dean’s not here,” Cas says, bluntly. “He’s at the shop on Saturdays. I can give you an address, if you need it.”
“Yeah, yeah, I know that part. And it’s great, right back atchya,” Dean says, dismissively, probably a bit too dismissively, but he needs some answers here. “I mean the sex, Cas. Do you want to have sex with me right now?”
Cas winces inwardly (and probably a little bit outwardly, too). “Um, right. So what do you do for work, then?” He asks, even though, again, he doesn’t care. But it’s a topic change, something he sorely needs right now.
“Doctor Winchester?” Crowley parrots, his interest piqued. “Well! Dean never mentioned that he was married to a doctor! ‘Suppose that explains the digs.” He looks around the porch and then past Castiel, into the house. "How domestic. You’ve even got the white picket fence and everything.”
Except for the fact that he very much
It’s absolutely absurd, it makes almost no sense, but still, it’s so sweet, so sincere, and so very Castiel.
“Now that’s what I’m talking about,” Dean says, grinning and rubbing his hands together. “C’mon, bring her over, I’m starved.”
Not too long into their relationship, Castiel had finally pieced together that he’s asexual. It took awhile to get him here -- sexuality repression caused by a hyper-religious upbringing will do that to a guy -- and he had been so worried about telling Dean, afraid that it might jeopardize their relationship and cost him the most important thing in his life. But much to his surprise and delight, Dean had accepted it and Cas wholeheartedly.
of this would work.” He can hear Dean say as he begins his trudge up the stairs. “Thought you had a real ace up your sleeve, didn’t you?”
“Alright, alright, simmer down now,” Crowley mumbles with a huff. “A fiery one, aren’t you?” That perpetual smirk creeps right back on his face, like it was never even gone in the first place. “You know, you could’ve just said no. There’s no need to be so testy about it.”
Cas reaches into the bag and pulls out a few packets. “I have the ketchup!” He offers them to Dean, practically shoving them in his face. “I made it a point to grab some on the way out. For you.”
Dean breathes out a relieved sigh. “Halle freakin’ lujah.” He collides his lips with Castiel’s, kissing him.
He sits more upright and turns to look at Cas fully. “What is it? What’s wrong?”
“I love you, too,” Dean returns, smiling at his angel and holding him a little tighter.
Dean heaves out a sigh and runs a hand over his face. “Cas…”
“Oh, you’re right on the money about the insatiable part, darling.” Crowley says, chuckling. “And I know all about that whole ‘not keen on sex’ bit of yours--” Cas only just barely resists the urge to correct that severe understatement of his sexuality. “--But I also know that you two do fool around a decent amount. So I just figured that, if you were to fancy, we could all--”
“It’s bad enough that Sammy’s always on my ass about this health food crap, now you’re gonna be doing it, too?” Dean shakes his head and crosses his arms. “Can’t a man just eat a burger -- a
Dean inhales deeply before speaking. “Do you like having sex with me?”
There’s a silence that follows before Dean starts chuckling, and Crowley quickly joins in, laughing along with him. And Cas, he stops at the top of the stairs and stands there, bewildered  as he gazes down at the two of them as they cackle at their equally awful and unfunny puns.
“You always will satisfy me, no matter what. Don’t you ever forget that.” Dean presses his lips to Castiel’s forehead, kissing it. “But I don’t want you to feel like we constantly have to have sex every single night just because I want to. I mean, I
like a real burger, not like all that tofu crap Sammy likes.” He hesitates before forcing himself to take another bite. “And like I said, it’s not bad. For rabbit food, that is.”
satisfied.
Castiel blinks, his head tilting slightly. “Why would our not having sex make for a more strenuous shower experience for you?”
He had been reluctant and nervous during their first time, which was understandable and honestly expected, so Dean had made it a point to guide Cas through it and all at his own pace. It had gone well, with Cas never once needing to stop, despite Dean continuously pausing and asking if he was good. Each time he was asked, Castiel had simply nodded and smiled, assuring Dean that it was right for him -- that it was right for them both.
So to Cas, the obvious solution was finding someone who could do all that he couldn’t for Dean. And after a great deal of convincing, assuring, and insisting on Cas’ part, Dean went and found himself his very own, bonafide ‘fuck buddy’, as Dean so eloquently refers to him as.
“I don’t know...” Dean mumbles and takes another bite, chewing slower this time and really focusing on it. “It’s not bad or anything, maybe a little overcooked, but it’s more than that. It feels like it’s missing something?”
Really, he doesn’t care to know more about Crowley or his work, but he also doesn’t want the conversation to go any further in the direction that Crowley’s trying to veer it toward.
Dean laughs along with him, his expression then morphing to something more serious as he looks Cas in the eye. “I’m serious, though. From here on out, I’ll ask you. I won’t ever just assume. And if you say no, well, my right hand’s just got a little more work to do in the shower.”
Now it’s Dean’s turn to be affronted. “You’re ‘not opposed’? That’s not exactly what a guy wants to hear to get in the mood.”
man.”
It’s not too long before he returns, in the abrupt and confounding manner that’s so synonymous with the angel, and he’s got a promising looking grease-soaked paper bag in hand.
“No, you’re not.” Castiel reaches for the bag. “You have to try the yucca fries, they have twice the protein and fiber of regular fries. And the pie, they had a pie, Dean! It’s vegan and uses all natural sugars. It’s apple, your favorite!” Castiel excitedly pulls the contents out of the bag and sets them down in front of Dean.
Mystery solved.
“Of course I want you, Dean,” Castiel says, sounding more than a little affronted. “Why would I ever not want you? You know how intimately and deeply I feel for you.”
to begin.
Dean groans and pinches his brow. “Crowley, what did you honestly think was going to happen here?”
Castiel’s eyes narrow. He doesn’t like where this is heading. “And why’s that?”
Castiel falls silent, the look on his face mirroring the one that he often has when they are intimate. It’s that same look of reluctance and confusion, and it speaks volumes before he even gets a word out.
Considering that Cas doesn’t want to know a damn thing about him, he most definitely has no desire whatsoever to meet him.
going to make me explain the difference between having sex for the sake of my husband, the man I love more than anything in this life, versus having sex with him and his fuck buddy that I pointedly want
“Oh.” Cas’ brows knit together and he purses his lips. “Well, then I’d very much enjoy it if you were to fuck me right now. How about that?”
ask that?”
“Good morning, Mr. Winchester,” Crowley says, his voice chipper and his smile wide -- a little too wide for Cas’ liking. Immediately, he doesn’t trust it.
“They’re not?” Dean abruptly tosses his burger back onto the wrapper, like it’s some sort of lethal bomb about to detonate. “What the hell are they then?”
But as things progressed, Castiel started to realize that, even though Dean hadn’t said anything, he wasn’t fully satisfied sexually. They were having sex, yeah, but Cas knew it was not as much as Dean likely wanted or needed, nor was it any of that ‘kinky’ stuff that Cas couldn’t (and still can’t) bring himself to try. No matter how much he loves Dean.
“No, I suppose it doesn’t,” Cas agrees.
Cas nods. “Indeed I am.”
Castiel leans into the touch of Dean’s hand, nodding slowly. “Alright.”
But clearly, there’s chemistry between the two of them. Castiel doesn’t know how or why, and he doesn’t need to know, nor does he want to know.
Dean resists the urge to grimace and forces a smile. “Yeah, I, uh... I can’t wait.”
“So that’s it? No more work? No more miracle-working and life saving on today’s agenda?”
Dean laughs in an attempt to lighten the mood, but Cas doesn’t join in. He’s still got that dejected, guilty look still on his face.
Cas sets the bag down on the small table that Sam and Dean are working at. “No leaves.” He opens the bag and hands Dean and Sam each a big burger. “And I even told them to keep all of the unwelcome vegetables off of your sandwich, Dean.”
Now for starters, he does at least know of the man; it’s not like Dean is having an affair or anything. Actually, Dean sleeping with another guy on the regular had actually been Cas’ idea in the first place.
“Yeah?” Dean snorts. “And what were those?”
Still, he finishes the entire ‘burger’ and turns to Cas with a smile of his own as he finishes. “All done.”
“Not really,” Sam says, shrugging. “Tastes like a pretty solid burger to me.”
“Oh my god, please tell me you did not.
“Really?” Sam grins as he looks down at his burger. “Well that explains a lot! I’ve heard good things about Impossible Meat for awhile now, but I had no idea it was going to be this impressive. It’s honestly even better than eating real meat, so much flavor!”
Castiel shifts slightly and looks down at his shoes. “I was looking at some magazines when we stopped at that convenience store on the way here. And while you were obtaining the gasoline, I had time to read an article about ‘the dangers of red meat’. It said that overconsumption of it can lead to increased risk of heart disease, diabetes, even cancer, all of which could result in…”
“Alright,” Castiel agrees, begrudgingly, gesturing for Crowley to come inside. “Please, make yourself comfortable.”
It’s all still little confusing for Dean, someone who’s never been shy about the fact that he enjoys sex, very much so. And it could be confusing for awhile, hell, he might not ever fully understand it. But what he does now know is exactly what Cas needs and wants from him, and more importantly, he knows that Castiel is happy and satisfied with him and with their relationship.
And Castiel can’t argue with logic like that.
The universe really is cruel sometimes.
to be sex,” Crowley insists. “McDreamy over here made that bold assumption all on his own.”
“I do,” Cas eventually says. “But...I don't think it’s so much the physicality or arousal of it that I enjoy. If anything, that component of it makes me a bit uncomfortable.” He bites down on his lower lip and looks down at his clenched hands. “And I know that’s the part of it you’re
Castiel sighs and shakes his head. “Believe me, I wish I could.”
“What, not allowed to be fashionable when I meet my man?” That smirk comes right back on Crowley’s face. “Oh, my apologies,
It’s more so a question of whether or not Cas is satisfied with the state of their relationship. Specifically, if Cas is satisfied sexually.
me!” Castiel interrupts. “It’s my fault you’re feeling this way. This doubt, this disappointment, and it’s all because I can’t satisfy you in the way you deserve.”
“And kisses, are those alright, too?” Dean asks.
Suddenly Dean being Cas’ one and only “turn-on” makes a whole lot more sense, along with those nods and sweet smiles, and of course, the profound declaration of “I love you” at the conclusion, each and every time, without fail. They aren’t cold, artificial instances of Cas trying to conceal his sexual dissatisfaction with Dean -- they are exactly how Cas
“Oh, I’m aware.” Crowley reaches into the pocket of his suit jacket (who the hell wears a suit to meet their fuck buddy?) and pulls out his cell phone. “He finished up early, told me to come by and meet him here.” He shows Cas a text conversation between him and Dean, revealing exactly that.
“Nightmare?” Dean whips his head around to face Crowley, his brows furrowing together. “What the hell did you do?”
“Hmm?” Dean shakes his head. “No, just uh...not enough ketchup, I think.”
Gripping Castiel’s chin, Dean tilts it upward and locks their gazes together. “Let’s try this again, and I promise, no matter what, I won’t get mad at you. I just really need you to be honest with me, Cas. Can you can do that for me?”
Cas stops in his tracks and raises a brow at Dean. “Want what?”
“You’re wearing a three-piece suit.”
“No, that’s not it!” Castiel exclaims, frustration evident in his voice. It doesn’t seem like it’s directed at Dean, but a larger issue, perhaps the very same mystery that Dean is trying to uncover.
“Well, it’s 11:30. This is what we always do at 11:30.”
“This--” Dean gestures between himself and Cas. “--Me. Us.”
Sam opens his mouth to counter but before he can get a word out, his cell phone rings. “Hello?” He answers, glaring at Dean as he steps out of the motel room to take the call.
“And earlier than expected.”
“I have a confession to make,” Castiel abruptly interrupts, an anxious and guilt-ridden look on his face that immediately raises cause for concern from Dean.
“The only ‘impossible’ thing going on here is thinking you could fool me with this!” Dean glares down at the impostor of a burger in his hands. “This is an abomination.”
“No,” Castiel says, immediately.
Castiel doesn’t know much about the man his husband fucks, and really, he’d like to keep it that way.
“In my defense, I never explicitly mentioned it
“...I think I liked ‘not opposed’ better.” Dean heaves out a sigh and runs a hand over his face. He pats the spot beside him on the bed. “C’mere, sit down.”
“‘Course I do, we’ve been at this for ages now,” Crowley says. “But that doesn’t mean we can’t spice it up a bit, right?”
“I did.”
Groaning in satisfaction, Dean immediately takes another bite, but as he continues to chew, his expression morphs into one of bewilderment. He pulls the burger away from his mouth and looks down at it, blinking.
“Don’t mind if I do,” Crowley says, smugly, much like that smile, or rather, smirk that seems to be permanently plastered on his face. He steps inside, letting out a low whistle as he looks around, glancing back over his shoulder at Cas.  “Nice,
“You’re a true treasure, don’t let anyone tell you otherwise.” Dean unwraps his burger and takes a big bite.
Damn evangelicals.
“I was being friendly, suddenly that’s a crime?” Crowley complains, standing up and smoothing out the nonexistent wrinkles on his suit.
“You can’t satisfy me?” Dean says, incredulously. “No, no, everything is great for me, why do you think I’m friggin’ begging for you every night? I’m the one who can’t satisfy you, even after we’ve done it like a million times now!”
“Really?” Castiel asks, his interest piqued. “So you do like it then?”
Maybe it’s just his wounded ego talking, frustrated at the fact that Cas isn’t constantly begging for his dick, but Dean can’t shake the feeling that he’s doing something wrong here.
“Oh no, you misunderstood. Dean’s the lucky one here,” Crowley clarifies. “Having such a beautiful home that he gets to share with a handsome doctor? A handsome doctor who lets him fool around with trouble like me? He certainly hit the jackpot with you, darling. You more than exceed all that hype.”
tell me that you’re joking.” Dean turns back to Cas. “Please tell me he’s joking.”
Cas’ clenches his jaw. “Well. He’s not back yet.”
“Then why are you only ‘not opposed’ to sex?” Dean asks. “Why don’t you ever ask for it, or even talk about it? Am I
“Right, yeah, point taken. Don’t worry we’re gonna get outta here. Way, waaaaay outta here.” Dean kisses Cas again before he pulls back and turns to Crowley. “Alright, get your ass up, you’ve done more than enough damage here.”
“...actually, no, I’m pretty sure it’s ‘three’s a crowd’.” Castiel says, incredulous, as he just...stares at Crowley, because wow, he doesn’t even know where to begin. Or
to talk to him.
Cas had been hoping he could slip back up to bed and leave Crowley to just watch TV or play on his phone until Dean got back. But once again, the universe is truly testing him today.
“Something wrong?” Sam asks.
to enjoy, but no matter how hard I try, I just can’t bring myself to...”
“Nothing!” Crowley raises his hands defensively. “I merely tried to be courteous toward your lovely husband and see if he’d be interested in spending some time with us this afternoon.”
“Yeah, not bad for rabbit food, but compared to an actual burger? There’s no contest!” Dean argues.
But when Dean had broken the work-induced silence midday and asked Sam if he was hungry, it was Cas who had spoken up and volunteered to go out and get them some food. Seeing as Cas wasn’t exactly doing much for this research part in the case -- if he even so much as tried to touch a computer, he’d more than likely break it -- Dean figured it was a good enough idea.
It’s clearly not Cas’ more than slightly mismatched home decor that Crowley is complimenting.
Sam rolls his eyes. “You just said that it wasn’t bad.”
That should be all the affirmation Dean needs -- key word ‘should’ -- but it’s hard not to feel uncertain when Cas never makes a move on his own. He’s always just responding and reciprocating Dean’s advances. He never speaks about sex, not unless Dean brings it up first. And if Dean ever tries to get a little dirty going by asking Cas what turns him on, the answer is always just a slightly perplexed “you?”. Never any mention of specifics.
“‘Impressive and commendable’?’” Dean parrots back, blinking at Cas. Well if the mood wasn’t already dead, it surely is now. “Um, thanks.” He tightens his hold on Cas, giving his shoulder a small squeeze. “But I know you well enough to know that’s not the whole story here. Something’s on your mind, so go on, spit it out.”
Dean appears in the doorway of the living room a few seconds later, his breathing heavy as he comes to a halt. He looks to Cas, then across to Crowley, before returning back to Cas, his eyes wide. “I, uh, hey!” He says, with an uneasy smile. “I...I thought you’d be at the hospital still?”
