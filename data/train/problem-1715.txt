His eyes jolted open. "Where the hell did that come from?" John slouched further down and closed his eyes again '
Donovan adjusted her weight awkwardly, something seemed very off. When had John become so bloody clever?
“I don’t believe you.” Maria voice was fierce and as soon as the door opened she stuck her heeled shoe inside the flat so the door couldn’t be closed on her.
The detective eyed Moran who was standing back with his rifle still trained on Sherlock, they had clearly left 221B and were now in a warehouse of sorts. He couldn’t make out any distinguishing features though.
John rolled his eyes, starting to get rather annoyed by this dismissive behavior. “But I would prefer it if you stayed here, if I have any say in it.”
John would have typically been more annoyed at being sent on some errand for his flat-mate, but he knew something was up with him and didn’t want to press him too much about it. When he spotted Lestrade at the yard he couldn’t help but think something had gotten into everyone lately.
Mycroft seemed suddenly uncomfortable and horrified in his own right. Only just realizing what he had been doing. It was too late now. Gregory knew he was a monster. He disentangled from his prey, ready to leave. “There’s a key on the desk, you have to lock me in-”
“What? No fare?” The boy casually picked up a near by pipe that they had likely brought with them, John instinctively took a step back- wrong decision. “Oi he looks scared doesn’t he? What’s wrong old man? Get nervous out in the cold?” he trailed the pipe against the wall to make a light dragging noise.
John huffed and crossed his arms over his chest. He was wearing a ridiculous yellow raincoat, boots, and a hat. “Maybe I just didn’t want to get soaking wet. Your coat is going to get drenched.”
Lestrade was breathing heavy finally caught up “I need you back in there, wait, he wasn’t talking simply because he told you so? Mate, I’m sorry but that’s sorta your own fault.”
Sherlock placed John beside the skull, it would be difficult to run into trouble there, then answered the door. John looked for a good hiding spot just before he spied where his phone had gotten off to the past few days, blinking with missed messages.
“Oh… “ She set the phone down, smiling at the house keeper, “I think that will be all for now, thank you for your patience.
He looked up at Sherlock, he hadn’t noticed until know that the taller man had silently gotten up and was now hovering over the couch near him, an unusual look on his face that John didn’t recognize
“It’s similar to the last one where I could prevent you from talking. They’re just simple commands and I will test how you respond to them after being out of your trance and see how much time it takes for the effects to wear off. Tea?”
Sherlock opened the door but John was already on him, “Oh no you don’t. You are staying out here and letting me bask in your misery.” He aimed for the taller man’s center of gravity but evidently miscalculated and sent them both tumbling for the floor. “Er, sorry about that. Huh, your coat really is too big for you, and here I thought you made everything tailor fit.” He stopped as he saw the detective’s eyes water over. “Hey, I didn’t mean it honest.” John quickly stood and helped Sherlock to his feet.”
The two men hear no reply, but then it was also possible they just couldn't hear John's small voice through the hole.
“I don’t know but I swear to god if that paint comes off and you end up standing here completely naked I’m pretending I’m not with you.” John shot back, eyes darting about desperate for an escape.
It’s late the following afternoon that Sherlock gives in, has to find John and tell him he’s ok and waiting for him at the flat. He really thought John would have come home by now. It’s worth scaring the daylight out of Mrs. Hudson to use her land line, she might as well know he’s still alive anyway. But when he walks down to her flat, the door isn’t locked and she’s nowhere in sight. Good. He can just call John and get this over with in peace.
“Surprisingly simple actually. I’m not really invisible- I’m simply bending all the light hitting me around my body.”
I wasn’t- John had started to write but deleted it. He had no idea what to say, he didn’t want to admit to using it but he knew Sherlock well enough to know he had figured it out if he had directly said it.
Greg moaned in half pleasure half pain. “Myc, stop, fuck. That’s too damn much.” His breathing sounded pained.
Sherlock's eyes never left the content of the folder but a small smile did begin to form. "Naturally."
“I’m sorry John…” his voice was a light whisper, “It’s for your own good.” He gave a firm tug on John’s right arm.
Sherlock gave John a day to recover from their last experiment. At first John didn’t believe a word of what happened but as the day progressed it all came back to him. The worst part came when the two were eating dinner at Angelo’s together and Sherlock stood to use the restroom. For a brief moment without thinking Sherlock placed his hand on John’s head and rubbed it. John leaned into it and made a noise entirely too much like purring before jolting away with a completely flushed face.
It was late, a bit too late to start a new raid that would likely take hours of play, but John still had a good half hour still in him before he could sleep.
That only made Mycroft smirk more. He gently nibbled at Greg’s ear, still holding his inflated belly. “Pregnant.”
“Mhm?” He wasn’t up to speaking coherent words just yet and his vision was still slightly blurry. He blinked his vision back quickly though when he realized who had knocked. “Oh- Sorry, wasn’t expecting you…” he tried to clear his throat and suddenly regretted not getting dressed before answering the door.
“Just a magic trick…” John mumbled to himself, suddenly the odd phrasing Sherlock had used through out their last conversation was starting to make sense. “He lied to me!? He stood there on that building making me think the worst when he was….” Except that wasn’t how it had panned out. John’s sudden outburst was only made all the more awkward by the silence that followed it. “So… What happened? What went wrong?
Sherlock pressed closer and began landing chaste kisses on John's neck, slowly becoming light sucking motions. "Sorry."
“Conduit…” John repeated whatever that strange voice had said. “You need a conduit.” That was one of those pseudo science terms he had heard online while researching.
John looked back in the box, picking up the piece he hadn’t seen till then. His expression slowly turning from one of confusion to shocked surprise. “It’s… oh my god. Is this what I think it is?”
“In this economy? Granted you are a very skilled surgeon, I doubt you will find a new job in time, besides, I am hardly requiring much from you, think of what a great opportunity this is!”
John had tried his very best to quietly sneak by her and Anderson, though he highly doubted they would have the brain power to recognize him. But hearing that word, that one word that had made him cringe so many times before when she had said, he couldn’t take it anymore. John hit her square in the nose. He was very proud of himself.
"Serial killer, this wasn't his first time." Sherlock kneeled near a scantily clad woman whose body was awkwardly leaning half against the wall and drooping to the floor. She had medium blond hair that went just past her shoulders, eyes frozen open looking into darkness.
Once out of sight Sherlock turned the smaller man so his back was against a building. He tugged his left arm, making John’s body go completely limp as he held him in place.
“Hm? Oh, yea. I’m fine… don’t worry about the mug.” It was absolutely something Sherlock would do, often did whenever he had heard about John going on a date with someone. “He was joking you prat.”
John smiled and clicked the accept button, not sure how messaging on Skype was really all that better then the in game system. No sooner then he did that a small window popped up on his screen with a small green phone and a camera with a strike through it. Not entirely sure what it was he clicked the green phone.
Maria had pushed herself past Sherlock and into the flat. She quickly eyes the messy entry room. “Well I see he hasn’t been cleaning up after you.”
John pinched the bridge of his nose. How was he going to explain this to Sherlock? It was hard enough getting him to understand human emotions and the concept of sentiment.
Harry sat unconscious tied to a chair, her head and shoulder’s leaning forward awkwardly. The pounding in her head became too much, her eyes fluttered open. She was immediately aware of the streaking pain in her left arm and hardening dampness on her skin and clothes- she knew without looking that it was blood. The sickening smell of iron filled her nostrils.
John twists around in Sherlock’s lap until his face is against the crook of the taller man’s neck, he can feel it dampening from his own eyes.
Sherlock had subconsciously raised his hand very close to his face to better see his flatmate. Voice barely above a whisper, “Of course, and John- I missed you too.” His eyes narrowed as he felt hot breath on his face. “Mycroft! You are entirely too close for comfort!”
“We have to get to St Bart’s, it’s the only place he can’t get in. But then you have to leave me…” John’s voice had gone quiet; he looked as though he was on the verge of a mental breakdown.
John forced the deerstalker back on Sherlock’s head “I’ll explain later, I should really get him home now.”
Victor got up off the ground and picked Sherlock up into a breath taking kiss and the people around them cheered. As the excitement died down and both the men returned to eating their dinners, Sherlock was barley listening to Victor go on and on about venues and flower arrangements. Instead he sent a quick text.
"Good thing for me." John hung up the phone and Sherlock started walking. He was on his was to fuck the pain away.
"Staying in contact with a separate lover when ones going to be a married man would only repeat history." Victor turned around and gave Sherlock a small smile that didn't meet his eyes.
Hey guys I know this chapter took me longer to post than the  others, but I had some trouble coming up the dialogue. I hope you enjoy!
Victor looked up and smiled at Sherlock. It was the same smile Victor gave him the night he came to 221B to dull the pain. The smile made Sherlock melt.
“I wasn’t having an affair with him Dr. Watson. I also didn't beat him to a pulp multiple times. Say your goodbyes, there’s no way in hell I’m going to let you be here if he wakes up.”
"It has been a long time hasn't it? Now come on and pack a bag. Your brother has insisted on me kidnapping you for a while and I really don't want to do it forcefully." The smile Victor had on his face was bright enough to dull the pain in Sherlock's chest.
Sherlock heard John sigh on the other end. "When am I going to see you again? Am I even going to get to see you now that he knows? I know you said he was fine with it but if a man finds out he's sharing you, there will be blood."
"I always suspected you had a thing for blokes in uniform." John chimed in. The smile on his face was infectious and Sherlock found himself smiling back. He knew he should be upset that the man he loved was the reason his life had been ruined, but when John was looking at him like that he just couldn't find an once of despair. Sherlock turned so he was completely facing John.
“Then why did you decide to tell me? I had no idea.” Sherlock looked back at his hands in his lap. “I was reminded me of the pain he caused me, I couldn’t stand the thought of doing that to you.” Victor walked back into the kitchen and braced himself on the counter. “If you want to go back over I’m not stopping you.” Hands wrapped around his torso from behind and Sherlock’s head rested on his shoulder.
John stormed in and flung the door open to 221B. His face was red and scrunched up in an expression Sherlock learned to recognise as pure rage. The last time Sherlock saw that face on John was when John's boot had connected with his side repeatedly. Sherlock was ready for the beating he was about to receive and sat down on the sofa watching John carefully.
"I was taking a nap, you were the one moaning my name this morning while I was trying to cure you in the other room."
“His wife shot you and he still stayed married to her. You have an excellent boyfriend who will stand by you no matter what you choose. He’s still worse than you my dear.”
“I’m not mad at you Sherlock, hurt, but not mad. I know you don’t feel the same about me as you do him. I’m only asking because at some point John Watson is going to hurt you again and I have a feeling he already has. It took years for the pain to leave your eyes and it’s back now. What happened tonight?”
Sherlock was in the kitchen of the flat he and Victor shared together. He was staring into the microscope cataloging the bacteria found on the door handle of his boyfriend's office. Victor had been getting sick repeatedly for weeks and Sherlock was determined to find the source.
Without saying anything Sherlock ran back inside and up the stairs to the flat. John was screaming after him but didn't follow him up. Sherlock burst open the door and went for his coat and scarf. The room was silent upon his entrance and he could feel everyone staring at him. As he went back out the door he turned around to face the man who's life he was about to ruin.
John crawled out from underneath the bed and watched them leave though the bedroom window. Sherlock and Victor were holding hands as they walked down the street. Victor stopping now and then to pull Sherlock in for a kiss. John felt the anger boil in chest and it took him every once of strength not to act on it. For the first time in years, John Watson was jealous.
When Sherlock went to call John the next morning, Victor was still asleep in bed. Sherlock needed to tell John what happened when he got home, but this was really just an excuse to hear his voice. He put on his coat and stepped outside so he could have some privacy and keep Victor from waking.
"See love, even the man himself is stating that I've treated you better than he ever has. Now, let's go back inside and forget all this ever happened."
"I was drunk that night you were put in the hospital, the night I put you there. I know it doesn't make what I did to you any better, but I truly am sorry. I pushed the greatest thing in my life away, literally beat you out of my life even though I was always going to choose you in the end. I was just about to divorce her before she died but I wanted to talk to you first and make sure that's what you wanted too. I had been planning it long before she shot you, long before we found out about Rosamond. I just never got the balls to do it. Which is why I noticed what I was doing to you, but chose to ignore it because I couldn't be at fault for why my life was so shitty."
And with that they continued walking down the street. They continued to walk hand in hand, laughing and joking about everything that had just happened. It surprised both of them how quickly that were able to shift back into how things were before Mary, before Victor. And the two of them wouldn't have had it any other way.
"I'm so happy for the both of you, sorry about Victor Sherlock, but I always new you too would end up together."
John wasn't looking at Sherlock before, and when he did he had tears in his eyes. Sherlock couldn't think of anything else to do but squeeze John's hands in his. The next thing John said he said with a shaky breath.
Sherlock finished getting dressed and went into the sitting room to fetch his coat, but John stopped him before he could get through the doorway.
"I didn't want to hurt him anymore than I already had. He took it rather well actually. He wasn't mad or anything. I even told him that I couldn't stop myself from seeing you and he still didn't kick me to the couch. As long as I keep coming home to him we should be fine."
He recognized the shadow on the other side before he got to the door. He stopped and couldn't breath.
"Everyone, thank you for coming. Now the reason that Sherlock and I asked you all to come was because we have an announcement." Victor looked up at Sherlock, an expression full of love an happiness. "We're engaged."
"John, I'm going back to your flat for a reason." A small smile appeared on Sherlock's face and John reflected it back. Sherlock moved down and placed a passionate kiss on John's lips. They stood there like that, alone on the street embraced in each other's arms, for what seemed like hours before they broke away. Sherlock looked lovingly into John's eyes and placed a kiss on his forehead before whispering. "I am yours John Watson. I have always been. And I will continue to be until the end of time."
John knew Sherlock all too well, well enough to know what he was actually asking. "Rosie was taken away because of my drinking, I only blamed you because I needed to feel like something wasn't my fault. She's been staying with Clara until I can get my act together."
"I'm different now. I know how horribly I treated you and I know that you are the greatest possible thing that has ever happened to me. I have loved you since the day that we met and I have never stopped. I will regret how I've treated you everyday, but from this day forward I will devote my life to making you as happy as possible. Even if, if after everything that has happened you still don't want me to be a part of your life I understand. I only want you to be happy. Sherlock."
"No Sherlock, that was me, I remember." John finally spoke up from beside him. John's eyes were shooting daggers in Victor's direction.
"Yes, yes I am." John's voice never rose and sounded slightly panicked. "I get it I'm a horrible person and Victor is the man of your dreams and that's great I'm happy for you. Rosie is all I have. You're the only person I've seen since I've been back in London outside of work. You knew who I was before and you know the man I am now. Sherlock, I need my best friend to help me get my daughter back. After this, if you never want to see me again, I'll take Rosie and we'll go back to America."
“Sherlock, I’m so sorry. I’m so so sorry. I didn't mean anything that I said. You’re so smart how could you not have known?”
Sherlock turned to look at Mycroft. "Who told you about my hospitalization? John was still listed as my emergency contact, the hospital must have contacted him. I can't see him contacting you when he sounded so emotionally distraught."
"I needed my coat." Sherlock took off, walking down the street. He could hear John's footsteps at a slight jog, trying to keep up. "Why? Where are we going?" The anger was completely gone from John's voice and was replaced with heavy breathing; he had to move faster to keep up with the taller man.
"Are you telling me that I never actually beat you?" Lastrad moved forward and placed handcuffs on Victor. Victor didn't put up a fight as a look of defeat appeared on his face. "That's exactly what I'm telling you John."
"Why Portland?" Sherlock's head was resting on John's chest while John played with his hair. "When Mycroft told me you left I thought of every possible reason as to why you would choose America of all places. I knew Mycroft was lying to me about the aunt, but I could never figure out the real reason you left London. I new that you wouldn't have left the country just to avoid seeing me."
"But why? We were engaged! You were mine! I don't understand!" Tears were running down Victor's face. Sherlock suspected more out of rage than sorrow.
Sherlock felt the pain again. After being numb for so long he remembered why he couldn't cut things off after Mary came into their lives. John Watson was the only person who made him feel something.
"Enough." He was getting extremely irritated now. "Look Victor, it's true that John has consumed more than just my time over these past months, but that doesn't mean that my feelings for you have changed. I know what I'm doing is wrong and you have every right to be upset, but please stop acting like a child. I love you and if me not seeing John makes you happy, then so be it."
“You’re leaving already? You always leave so soon. Stay the night. Please.” John pleaded with him like this after every visit. It was a weak attempt to return to what once was.
"What the bloody hell was all that about?" Victor got closer and Sherlock could see something in Victor's eyes that he had never seen before. "Now you're leaving me for him? After choosing me? What did he say? What did he do to you? I swear to God I'll kill you!" The last remark was directed at John.
"Lastrad, arrest Dr. Watson. He's been supplying Sherlock with drugs." Victor looked like his whole world was falling apart and he was frantically trying to put it back together. Lastrad and Mycroft were visually disturbed by Victor's behavior.
"I never meant to hurt you, physically or emotionally. I don't expect you to believe me I just need you to know that I loved you with every fiber of my being. It's just that between Mary's death and Rosie being taken away I needed someone to blame, when I should have blamed myself."
John sighed and looked at the doorknob, placing his hand on it to make sure everything he was doing was real. Sherlock could tell he had done this many times before in his head, but of course actually putting his heart out there was more painful. This made Sherlock's next thought so much easier to go through with.
John's smile got wider. And Sherlock's did too. There were so many things they wanted to say to eachother; apologies  and professions of love. They knew that this wasn't the time or the place for everything left unsaid.
"Ah, I'm afraid John's right. I really have to agree with Doctor Watson on this one. I did just witness my fiancee get arrested after all."
“He’s been slowly killing himself for months according to that piece of paper. You’re a Doctor, John, how could you not have known?”
There was a pause on the other side of the phone. Sherlock could picture every expression that was passing over John's face. "Why in the hell would you go and do a thing like that?"
“It had already been done. I couldn’t go back in time and change what happened. I would if it was possible.”
“Did you want to?” Victor reapered in the doorway and leaned up against the frame, crossing his arms.
"Purely selfish reasons. The last image of you in my head had been you all beaten up near death. I needed to see you healed and alive, so I could live with myself."
Sherlock walked closer to the door and flung it open and he loved what he saw on the other side. John Watson refusing to look up at him because there were tears streaming down his face. He could see and hear in his voice that he was truly sorry and Sherlock was willing to let him back in. Seeing John's face, even scrunched up in pain, was better than not seeing it at all.
"Well I better get going, I'm going to be late as is." Victor crossed the room and embraced Sherlock in a passionate kiss before leaving the flat.
"With Victor's confession you're case will be looked over again. Instead of going through a trial the judge will more than likely just give you custody. He already has proof of the rehab so there should be nothing else that would inhibit him from thinking you're a good father."
John continuously hit Sherlock until he fell off the sofa and landed on the floor. John gave him a few good kicks before leaving the flat. Sherlock felt tears run down his face as he reached under the sofa. John's face was the last thing he saw behind his eyelids as he stuck the needle in his arm.
Sherlock hurried out of bed and started throwing John's clothes underneath the bed. "Victor's home, get under the bed. Now!"
Sherlock took his boyfriend’s hand and led him over to the sofa, sitting next to him and keeping their hands in his lap refusing to meet Victors’ gaze.
"And what should I tell them, Sherlock? What do I tell our friends? You left me for the man who broke your heart several times over? A man who drove you to a suicide attempt? Remember that Sherlock? Remember the pain?"
"It's a pleasure Victor." Mycroft entered the flat and went to stand next to his younger brother. "Sherlock, why didn't you tell Victor you already told your family about the engagement?"
"I'll take that as my cue to leave as well. And I suggest you both do the same before the rest of your guests realize that it's safe to come outside." Mycroft offered before stepping into an unmarked vehicle. Molly and Mrs. Hudson were the first of the guests to be brave enough to walk out onto the sidewalk. Molly walked over to Sherlock and John and pulled both men into a hug.
They fall onto the bed out of breath and breathing heavily. He hated the moment after they both climaxed, all the doubt about what he was doing washed over as soon as his head hits the pillow. He turned to look at John, who was already facing him.
As the room filled with cheers and congratulations, Sherlock found a break in the excitement and went outside to clear his head.
“He hadn’t told you till now? That wasn’t part of the apology? Look Sherlock, I know you love him and after all the suffering he’s caused you I have no idea how you are even giving him a second chance.”
Sherlock ran outside to join John on the pavement. The cold London air nipped and filled him with an excitement that wasn't previously there.
"Victor came in after John left that night. I had just injected myself with cocaine and had started feeling the affects. I was upset by John's words, buy not his actions. Victor came in after, beat me and then injected me with a fatal dose. He knew Mycroft was stopping by with another case so he just had to make sure that John would be angry enough to get intoxicated and then come over. Victor therefore, told the authorities that he was a concerned neighbor who heard shouting in the house next door and was concerned for the baby living there with a drunk of a father, meaning John. When the police arrived they found John passed out on the couch with a beer bottle in his hand while Rosie was crying in another room. An investigation was launched because the cop that arrived had a vendetta again child neglect, that was just luck. It wasn't intended to go that far. You just wanted to scare John into thinking he was going to lose his child, not actually get Rosie taken away. You hated our relationship, not John himself. John got drunk enough to convince himself that he was a danger to me and his daughter which caused John to give up custody until he could prove himself and leave me to get clean the most affective way he knew how. Which turned out better than you could have hoped. It was an excellent plan. You even accounted for me not being at my full abilities by drugging my tea every morning so I wouldn't be able to figure out your scheme."
John kissed his forehead. "Are you telling me that I stumped the great Sherlock Holmes?" Sherlock looked up at John and the cocky smile that was present on John's face made Sherlock melt.
Victor's face went form pained to confused and the tears stopped flowing almost immediately. "What?"
John's presence was enough for his brain to work at normal capacity. And Sherlock was just beginning to realize that John wasn't the cause for all his pain, Victor was. "You're the one who put me in the hospital."
"See you then." Knowing he was about to get his next fix was enough to stop the tears from flowing and put a smile on his face.
"Lastrad already informed me what happened. Mrs. H and I can tell the rest of Victor's family and send them home for you boys." Molly was doing them a larger favor than she realized. Sherlock suspected that John wanted nothing more to be buried inside him and was starting to get impatient. Sex first, feelings later. Sherlock couldn't agree with that order more.
Sherlock could feel the tears running down his face. He new John wasn't the healthiest thing, but he couldn't stop himself. Whenever he was hurting he needed more; the only thing that stopped the pain was John being inside of him.
Sherlock practically pushed Victor into the sitting room as he grabbed his coat off the rack. "Let's go out. We haven't done that in awhile."
Sherlock hung up the phone, his face and ribs still bruised. Tears were running down his face as he searched the flat for something to take the pain away. He heard unfamiliar footsteps climbing up the stairs. Sherlock wiped the tears away hoping the intruder was coming to end his life since he has been unsuccessful on his own.
Victor inhaled sharply and paused before continuing. “Thank you for telling me.” Sherlock looked up at him confused. Victor placed a hand gently on Sherlock’s cheek.
“John came by the flat a couple months ago to apologize, I’ve been seeing him at least twice a week since then.”
Sherlock never texted John back. He hoped John would get the hint and move on but that never seemed to happen.
"No no, that's not what I mean at all. Okay what you did with my office door handle, anything like that?"
"Sherlock, I know you're in there. I was in town and I stopped by our flat only to be told that you moved."
Sherlock had gotten text like this at least once a day since the proposal. He knew John was stubborn, but he was beginning to get on Sherlock's nerves.
Sherlock had to all but tackle Victor to the ground to prevent him from punching John in the face. In their struggle Victor was pushed and caught himself by stepping several paces back. "Victor, I'm leaving you it's done."
Victor took a deep breath and placed both his hands over both of Sherlock's. "William Sherlock Scott Holmes, I have loved you every moment since I first met you. Now that I know what it's like to be your boyfriend I have no intention on changing that at all. Well, maybe a little bit." Victor got on one knee and reached into his coat pocket and pulled out the most gorgeous ring Sherlock has ever seen. "Will you do me the honor of making me the happiest man in the world? Sherlock Holmes, will you marry me?"
"I found you Sherlock, I was at the hospital before Dr. Watson." Mycroft had a look if confusion on his face which changed in approximately 2.3 seconds. "Oh I see. I should have noticed it sooner. Lastrad, you might want to put my ex. brother in law in handcuffs before this escalates any further."
"I bought you a lobster. I suggest you eat it so the poor creature didn't die in vain. Now love, tell me about this case you're working on."
John was the first one to speak. He stopped suddenly on the sidewalk and waited for Sherlock to face him and take his other hand. "I didn't beat you that night. It doesn't excuse what I said or how I reacted. Hell, how I treated you after Mary died is also inexcusable. I knew you were using. I suspected that you were increasing your doses in such a way that would prove fatal over a period of time and I did nothing about it. I was too mad at myself and I was taking it out on you."
"What I don't understand, brother of mine, is how my man in America was killed without my knowledge."
He pulled out a cigarette and brought it to his lips. It was just the thing he needed to calm down enough to think.
John grabbed his pants and tossed them on as he crawled under Sherlock and Victor's shared bed. Everything was just out if sight as Victor opened up the bedroom door.
“How can you still say that after I’ve been cheating on you for months? I’ve never once let you touch me the way I let him and you still are willing to be with me?”
"Does that mean you'll be moving back in? Baker Street has been quiet since both you boys left. I don't like it." Sherlock pulled Mrs. Hudson into a hug.
“I wasn’t. The day he came over I told him about you. It’s similar to the arrangement we had before only this time the significant other being betrayed hadn’t shot one of the members of the adultery. Which I guess makes me worse than him.”
Sherlock looked at Victor out of the corner of his eye. "Please tell me how you came to that conclusion." Sherlock couldn't help the smile that appeared on his face.
"Hello William, you're brother called and said you needed a friend. Sorry to just walk in but the door was open." In the doorway of 221B stood a friendly face he forgot years ago.
“Tell him you have to leave London for a case and will be back tomorrow afternoon. I miss you falling asleep in my arms.”
That was the last straw. Before Sherlock could stop him, John walked up to Victor and punched him right in the nose. Lastrad then called Scotland Yard and Victor was taken into custody.
“Don’t blame this just on me, you’re the one who’s always spying on us. You know everything, how could you have not noticed this?”
"I thought you would have had all of this figured out the moment you looked at me." John's smile grew wider. "Guess I give you too much credit."
"They're taking her away from me. Do you understand that? They're taking her away because her father associated with the likes of you!" John stompped across the sitting room, pointing his finger at Sherlock while raising his voice which Sherlock did not think was possible.
"We're you having a wank? It smells like sex in here." Victor's tone was playful so Sherlock went along.
"Brother of mine, I'm surprised you called. So soon after being discharged. Thank you again for cooperating with the Doctors and staying the full stint, Mummy was so pleased. Now, I'm assuming you're calling about Doctor Watson. My sources have him landing in Portland sometime yesterday afternoon. It's assumed that he as an aunt there who's not in the best condition."
"We've been engaged for a week and the only people who know are the small audience we had at the restaurant and ourselves. Oh, and Dr. Watson."
"Tell them I left you because you only wanted to marry me out of pride. You saw me as nothing more than your property and you just wanted to stake your claim. You might have loved me once, but we both know love was not the reason behind that proposal. Not when it came from a place of hatred." Sherlock knew he sounded cold. And he was shocked by his own deduction. But he kept his face firm so Victor wouldn't have anything else to use against him.
"Oh, okay. Why?" Sherlock turned back to look at John, to tell him that he left Victor, and that he was willing to be a part of John's life in any way John would have him, but as he turned around he saw another man jogging up to them. Sherlock moved toward the man and positioned his body in front of John's.
Sherlock didn't know how to respond. Half of him wanted to run, the other half wanted to open the door and embrace the man and pretend that nothing had happened all those years ago.
A knock on the front door startled him. He hadn't heard the footsteps round the corner. He absentmindedly went to go answer it. Sherlock had noticed his change in brain function; he wasn't as alert as he had been, but he hadn't minded that much. He was still solving cases and Victor made him happy. He was content with his new life, well as content as one could be after a heartbreak that severe. He would often describe it as a numbing of his senses; still functioning but not at full capacity.
Sherlock was sure that the custody hearing was just an excuse. Sherlock couldn't have excuses, he was quitting his addiction and seeing John might cause him to relapse.
Sherlock analyzed John's face making sure to ignore the mocking grin and tone of his voice so he wouldn't be distracted. It was funny how a man could be more addicted to a lover than a drug. That's what John was to him, his drug of choice, why else would Sherlock let John share his bed again?
Sherlock didn’t know how to answer that question at first. It had always been easy to talk to Victor, the man is the reason he’s still alive after all. He looked back at their hands in his lap.
Sherlock couldn't stop the tears from flowing down his face. The look Victor had in his eyes was full of love and adoration. Sherlock saw his Victor, the Victor he fell in love with years ago, and the Victor that made the decision John never had.
The waitress brought over their food and filled their glasses with more wine. Victor smiled at her and began to eat. "Oh god, this steak is incredible! Love, please eat your lobster, I want you to enjoy it."
"What was that about?" John asked with a concern that didn't meet his face, which still had a hint of anger.
"I'm surprised there isn't one besides him. Sherlock Holmes, choosing sex instead of crime solving. Maybe that will be the title for Dr. Watson's next blog post."
The walk back to John's flat seemed to go on forever. They were only a couple blocks away but they walk there was in silence. Sherlock took John's hand as soon as they were out of sight from Sherlock's old life.
"Sherlock, I don't expect you to let me back into your life after all I've done. I am moving back to London to help Harry with her recovery but I swear that if you don't want to see me at all you won't. I wouldn't want to see me either."
Sherlock got a glimpse of something in John that he hadn't seen in a while. In that moment Sherlock was reminded of his humanity and of the greater man and detective John had made him. Sherlock then realized that he wanted no part of his new life, he wanted to return to what once was.
“Just the same, whatever she said, it isn’t true.” He reached out to knock Mycroft’s hand away from the door handle and grabbed his wrist by mistake. He flushed slightly, but his body was apparently not on the same track as his mind as his hand stayed there for a moment too long. He pulled it back suddenly realizing this, “Er, sorry…”
“No, Sherlock’s just being… Sherlock.” He placed both hand’s on the overly affectionate man’s hat to make sure it didn’t fall off, Sherlock didn’t stop in his act of head rubbing.
“Oh, right. Well, it’s alright if you want to be there in person too.” His voice was barely above a whisper.
As Sherlock was still hyper focused on the way the woman reacted to the string of odd questions, he felt a tug at his arm. He ignored John’s attempts until it became too distracting.
Mycroft held his hands in fists at his side, “I will not come to your aid again if you turn up somewhere half out of your mind on drugs.”
John thought back to that morning he had been desperate for a solution to his living situation over two years ago. If it hadn’t been for Mike Stamford he wasn’t sure what he would have done. He did have a deep suspicion though. No one had ever questioned how he owned nearly no possessions between the time he left the military and moved in with Sherlock. Just clothing, his laptop, and a loaded gun he kept in top drawer of his desk. The same gun that sat on the mantle besides Sherlock’s skull now. The thought to use it had passed his mind many times since the fall.
John smiled at that. “That would be nice actually. I could certainly use a few drinks.” It would beat drinking at home alone.
John knew Donovan was just making fun of them again, she often posted rude cutting remarks like that and people knew not to take her posts seriously. ‘
John let out an awkward chuckle, “Highly doubt that.” He waited for another informative whisper but when it didn’t come he looked down at the grass for an indication as to where his unseen flatmate was, and panicked to find he had left his side. John’s eyes grew slightly wider at the realization.”
John guided a woman inside, his voice noticeably softer with this woman then with his other patients. Sherlock quickly noticed the thick black glasses and walking stick. Blind. He lolled his head back, already getting bored with John’s job.
Sherlock blushed, no one aside from his therapist and Mycroft touched his legs, and that was only from necessity. He knew he had lost much of the muscle in them and they were beginning to get boney.
“John no! I don’t know what’s going on, but I definitely am not causing this…” He didn’t see any logical way of getting that message across to him though.
“It’s alright Sherlock, I know how hard you must have looked for me. It’s really my fault the fire started and I got lost.”
The next day couldn’t come soon enough. John didn’t focus on a single word one of his teachers said. He rushed back to his dorm as soon as possible, booting his computer up. He had set his skype account up so it automatically turned on when the computer came on, a small green check appearing next to his screen name. John smiled brightly when saw Deducing Otter already had a green check next to his name as well, clicking the name a small picture of a skull came up- he had grown very accustomed to this image representing his friend.
John still didn't want to go, but the idea of being trapped on the table all day with no food and nothing to do was unbearable.
"People will notice he isn't around for a while wont they? Especially Mrs. Hudson, she'll notice for sure."
John cleared his throat in a loud rude manner; Sherlock dipped back down in the pocket realizing it took stepping on his own toes to look outside. John couldn’t reach the top.
They continued emailing fashion advice and makeup tips as the days went by. Molly always kept an eye out for who the sender might be, but no one at work dressed half as nice as the fashion tips sounded and she really didn’t know that many women. Eventually she became suspicious that there was one person she never checked, couldn’t check anymore.
"Let me see." Sherlock approached him abruptly and grabbed his hand. "Won't need stitches, you should go wash and bandage it though."
“You could not logically expect me to go after that… it was pink Mycroft! And I should hardly think I did this just to avoid Mummy.”
Sherlocked turned at looked at him. John could literally feel him do this so he sat on the couch and tried to look away as he spoke.
Countless nights John sat in his chair waiting for Sherlock to come home. Just walk right through the door with his coat billowing in the wind as he pulled his midnight blue scarf off and rattled off a million deductions he could hardly follow. But he knew that day would never come again.
“But what if I didn’t catch you in time!” His gaze suddenly returned to John. “What if Moriarty found your first? He could crush you with his hand alone John! Or that rat?!” He placed his hands on the table on either side of John to rise out of his seat. John reached out to place his hand on the forefinger nearest to him, causing Sherlock to stop and look at him harder.
Sherlock’s hands fisted at his sides. So this was what Mycroft was warning him about. What was he even going to do if he succeeded with John?! He honestly wasn’t sure he wanted to know. He rose up, making the water jostle even more.
Sherlock’s hat fell off as he left Lestrade and went back to rubbing against John without a care in the world. “Never mind, John’s jumper is much softer and more cuddly and he smells like jam.”
John swallowed, Sherlock just wanted to be closer to him, surely. He carefully warped a hand around his waist and put the other under Sherlock's legs as he lifted him onto the mattress. Sherlock leaned forward to take of his shoes and let them drop to the floor, despite the tread having never been used and couldn't possibly have a bit of dirt on them. He looked up with hooded eyes, partially obscured from a few loose locks of black curls.
“No one’s online today, not much we can do in game I’m afraid.” The baritone seemed particularly bored.
John leaned his chair back a bit, noticing it was still raining outside. “Yea, he’s being strange, ever since Mycroft came over yesterday-”
“Why are you experimenting with hypnotism on him? Er… I probably don’t want to know the answer actually.”
“You don’t know- ugh, why do I even bother?” John did his best not to look at the box, but he found his eyes kept drifting to it.
Four days later and Mycroft hadn’t heard anything about the possible where about of John since. It was a fluke that he recognized him as he ran out of the club, of course at the time he thought he was watching the criminal who had just killed a man and otherwise wouldn’t have taken such a close look as to recognize John. Mycroft didn’t tell anyone about that night.
“What about my eyes?” It came out quite aggressively. He barely gave Greg a moment to answer before he sprung for him, trying his best to grab the DI by the waist.
Sherlock sat at the opposite end of the kitchen table from John wearing his silk purple shirt with a manila envelope and his composition book in hand.
John fell over with a lap full of Sherlock. “Christ. You really are a cat. Come on then, go over to the damn couch and I’ll do it properly.”
Sherlock’s eyes flicked up to Mycroft’s. His pupils were blown wide. Not unnaturally, but certainly strangely given their lighting. How was he making Sherlock hear him?
“You’ll just have to cancel it. Just think of how much you are giving to science and law enforcement, now, doesn’t it seem selfish to want to go on some silly date considering what science would have given up if you didn’t comply?”
Greg had waited several minutes and even knocked two additional times, but there was no answer. He tried calling, but of course, Mycroft never picked up and the phone merely went to voicemail.
He stood to leave but took another look at his friend. Sherlock seemed somehow thinner then ever. Far too many of his bones were showing through his now see though wet shirt. His hair was a soggy mess of curls. John just wanted to reach out and hold him. He looked so fragile and young, like he needed to be watched and protected. “be safe?”
"Already told you I'm not going anywhere." He smiled into their next kiss. But as John's hands wandered down Sherlock's torso he could feel the detective's body go rigid. He immediately pulled his hands away. "Sorry… too much?"
“Hmm? But those are all things that only fulfill my wants. I don’t care that you can’t work at the hospital or go on dates. I don’t even feel
“You’re looking far too down considering I have the world’s greatest frozen pizza.” Greg set the steaming tray down on the coffee table, deciding to forgo the plates and just pig out instead. “Now, no more ghosts unless it involves making pottery with them.”
“I really don’t like the idea of you messing with my mind, I’m not exactly the poster boy for mental health to begin with.”
“So as you can see, today is not particularly good as my brother’s idea of having fun has left me bound to the sofa.” Sherlock waited for John to be mad that he had lied, find some reason why he had to go, pretended now that they had met in person that he was wrong about the feelings he had confessed to the night before.
Moriarty continued to laugh even as the door slammed shut. He had finally shrunken down to just above five inches. He had no doubt that in a day or two Sebastian would come back begging him to forgive his outburst, it had happened before after all. He picked up the vial Moran had left for him, he grinned, even when mad he knew his pet wouldn’t leave him helpless. He drank it quickly and waited.
There was a light bemused laugh. “She was incidental. Only did it because she was in the wrong place at the wrong time.”
Sherlock decided it was best to walk. He slid a hand through his curly hair, glad the effects of the last experimental mix up was finally out of his system. He didn’t really mind the ears or tail, but he hated wearing that damn hat in public. He cast his gaze down at John, following fully willingly, but with a hint of concern on his face, he knew he could suddenly lose control of his actions at any minute based on the whims of his crazy friend.
Ella’s eyes narrowed. John had no way of knowing she lived alone with three cats after her ex fiancé left her. “John, let me see your phone.”
Sherlock was dreading this. He still couldn’t get past the door that led outside. He would be alone all day now. Somehow it seemed much easier to get John to stay around when they were in his room. He knew it was likely the same reason why he had better luck with moving objects that use to belong to him opposed to just anything.
Sherlock grinned, “You haven’t accepted my death yet, but you’re subconsciously slipping back into normality- which is why we’re in the flat, and since we’re still taking cases together, you want to work the finer details out in person, not fully trusting you own abilities yet.”
“This is boring.” Sherlock shouted, not that anyone could hear him. But there was nothing at all to do. He couldn’t even shoot a gun at the wall or talk to John. What was the point of being there if he wasn’t really there? Even dramatically flopping down on the bed had no effect. The sheets were exactly the same as before and John was unmoving.
She nearly gasped out loud as she read and reread the email. It was true. Molly knew she was the only one that knew this side of John. She felt strangely honored. The emails continued, slightly more open then before. John still didn’t come home.
“No. Just bite. One bite. I need to John. I have to.” He was pulling John closer without realizing it. “It would hurt.” He knew if he did, he was going to sink all the way in.
“Feeling less curious?” Sherlock mused, chucking the soaking fabric out of the bath and onto the tile floor. Only his briefs remained.
John glanced at his clock, 11pm. He really wasn’t tired yet but other gamers were getting increasingly hard to come across in game. John leaned back in his chair as they both waited for more people to log on, but it seemed futile. John tilted his head, even when waiting idly Sherlock always had such straight posture. He clicked the small icon of his friend and the image filled the screen. He was obviously not aware that he was being watched so keenly. John couldn’t help but notice Sherlock’s eyes were racing across his screen- obviously not due to the game they were playing, a small smile on his face, barely noticeable even with the screen enlarged like it was.
Sherlock had fallen to the ground with his overly long legs awkwardly sprawled around him, hands still to his temples, but now his head was ducked downwards making his expression impossible for Lestrade to see.
“You better not be looking at anything I have on there.” He could hear faint sound coming from the device meaning the detective was likely watching some sort of video.
“It would be a shame to squish your little pet before I leave.” Moriarty made an exaggerated frown. “Oh that’s right, I didn’t come alone either!” His fake smile returned as he took his cell phone out of his pocket. “Let’s see how many bullets my favorite sniper brought along.”
This time whenever Sherlock tried to pet him, John would either bite his hand or whack at it with his paw.
Mycroft’s phone buzzed in his pocket, there were very select people that even had access to that number.
“I can assure you that Mummy will not care that you’ve gone and shrank yourself, you are coming to her birthday and that’s final. You only have to see her, no one else.”
Lestrdae let his tongue stroke up the underside of the appendage, now gently sucking on it as Mycroft let out what even he could admit was a truly exquisite moan. Greg clenched his fists into the sheets beneath him, utterly annoyed at how hard this was making him. Fuck. He would just have to deal with that weird response later. Mycroft was so close to letting go now, he only had to keep teasing that tentacle for a bit longer.
The cap was filled with water; it was the perfect size for John, which only helped to further frustrate him.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes “You can stop dilating your pupils and ogling at my boyfriend any time now.”
“We’ll draw up a contract. But a week is too long, I insist on having him now so I know I’m satisfied with what I purchased.”
"Oi! Where are you off to now!?" Lestrade followed Sherlock out and spied the slick black car waiting.
“John wait! Come back, I said I’m sorry!” He calls after his flatmate as he follows him down the stairs.
John bit his lower lip before repeating the words for Lestrade to hear, he didn’t like that he was technically deceiving him, but it seemed better then saying
John always thought Greg only ever contacted Mycroft to help keep tabs on Sherlock. Was it more then that? “Are you two… friends? You and Mycroft I mean?” He also never considered Mycroft to be agoraphobic before, but then he never exactly sat down and had a real conversation with the man either.
“When Sherlock and I went to gather John back from his little misadventure, Moriarty was there. Threatened he would be back. I should have taken more precaution of course. Damn. What was I thinking?” His shoulders tensed harshly at this.
John thankfully woke in his own bed that morning. He remembered the previous day, but some parts seem to be slightly blurry. The only thing he was really sure of was that it was the first night in a long while that he didn’t have a single dream about the war. He lay back in bed and smiled at the ceiling, “That nutter did this.”
“That’s… that’s why you want me back to normal? So I can make you tea?” John’s brow furrowed not sure if he should believe what he just heard.
“Wha- well, of course not just… I mean, I already do all the shopping anyway I guess.” John headed for the dairy section knowing tall git would follow.
“You never cared what anyone thought of you, you wouldn’t care what the papers printed. Not now. Not ever. That’s not why you… there was a different reason.”
“Ah but that’s it!” He finally understood. He looked the way he saw himself as. He concentrated hard on the image before him, and soon found he could easily change what he was wearing just by thinking. Though with no one else to see, this new trick seemed to be of little use.
-That’s Captain Hedgehog thank you very much! And that sounds more like IN-ductive reasoning then DE-ductive reasoning.-
“And it didn’t! It’s not like you have to talk or that anyone would know. I’ve stayed true to my word.”
Molly was there in less then hour, still wearing her lab coat from work. John was on his fourth cup of tea, which shook nervously in his hand.
John clicked out of his skype account and plugged the device in, the box claimed it had a range of 25 yards. He wasn’t sure why anyone would need the range to be so long, but he wasn’t about to question it as he plopped down on his bed that was on two feet from his desk anyway.
Sherlock massaged his temples, “Jaaaawn. You are really going to sit there and say David Tennant is a ‘I would fuck him number Ten.’ And still claim to be straight?”
. “No, just trying exit if you could allow me.” His voice remained calm but he could feel the pressure building in his head.
Donovan and Anderson had been standing close enough by to hear Sherlock talking to Lestrade but hadn’t become involved in the conversation yet since that would mean putting up with Sherlock’s rude remarks about them.
He quickly went off to his bedroom, there was probably something there. Sherlock smiled softly. His favorite blue scarf had been carefully folded on the bedside table. John had done that, of course. But now he needed to get Greg in there.
John was flustered, “I don’t want people recognizing me… or you know… knowing I’m… a guy.” ‘Well that was awful to put into words.’
Next to the register was a plain small parcel with Sherlock’s name on it, after inspecting the contents that he ordered when he had first come to the store two days ago he put it in his interior pocket. Contemplating the other item in his pocket that he had brought with him he looked back at John who had changed into a striped shirt yet no longer seemed enthused about the new wardrobe selections.
One night in which John had been away for two nights Lestrade decided to text him, just a simple message, imply he hadn’t been trying to follow him.
Sherlock grabbed John’s computer sitting on the coffee table near them and began going through John’s files. “Vacation photos? Really John?”
John glanced over, seeing Sherlock definitely still had two legs. “I don’t know what I’m feeling right now, like I’ve lost my bloody mind I suppose.” Some movement caught the corner of his eye. There was something dark in the water, though he wasn’t sure what. John’s body reacted before he could, jolting away from the bath as fast as he could in sheer panic. He struck his head on the porcelain base of the sink causing a loud thud.
“Because you haven’t gone on a date in weeks, plus I’m the reason your last one didn’t pan out. It will be fun. Just ask her. When you come back I’ll tell you what was in your tea.”
John woke up again three hours later to the sound of someone knocking on the door. Light spilled through the window forcing him to open his eyes.
“You should have killed me,” Mycroft buried his face in Greg’s chest. How could he ever meet that man’s eyes again?
“ Is not sorry.” John could hardly keep his eyes open as he was being tucked into his flatmat’s bed once again.
“You’re sure of this?” Mycroft raised an eyebrow. “Its not only your own safety you should be considering.” John could have sworn that he glanced at him for a moment.
’ “Molly- erm, she’s a lab assistant, she should be here soon.” No sooner had he said that a cab pulled near by and Molly got out paying the driver. “Oh good, we need you in the lab right away.”
John finally managed to catch his breath, seeing that he was dry and out of harms way now. “I was drowning.” It still seemed so impossibly real.
Sherlock’s eyes lifted only momentarily to meet with John’s before dropping back down to what he was looking at, his smile growing coyer. “Nothing, looking a few articles online up.”
For once Sherlock was a tad grateful that Anderson really was the absolute moron he appeared to be. There was a strained huff from behind him, he turned to see a steaming mad John, all be it looking in slightly the wrong direction.
“John… I’m so sorry. God, what was I thinking?” He shakes John’s shoulder lightly, watching his eyes flutter open.
“In it?” The detective plopped the box on the floor and promptly crawled inside. “Can you believe Mrs. Hudson didn’t want this perfectly good box anymore?”
Sherlock sank into the scarf more and pulled some of it over himself in a futile attempt to hide. John rolled his eyes and let out a small yelp as the detective grabbed his arm and tried to pull him under the scarf with him.
"Hey there..." John said softly, kneeling to eye level with him as he cupped Sherlock’s cheeks and tilted his head up to look at him. "None of that now, alright?"
John's body was parallel with the ground before his mind could even keep up, but now his should was writhing in a familiar pain.
The interview was set up at an outdoor café, Molly had arrived a few minutes early and took a well visible seat towards the edge of the enclosed space. Normally not the best dresser when outside the lab, Sherlock had insisted she stop back at her flat to put on her best professional attire, the options from her closet were limited but she did at last managed to find A blazer Sherlock didn’t roll his eyes at.
“It should appear so.” A cup of tea floated upwards on it’s own accord, tipping in the air as liquid poured out quickly disappearing.
“That’s what happens when it’s raining.” How was his flatmate suppose to be a genius again? “I should probably dry it off a bit more. Sherlock? Are you alright?”
John unceremoniously plopped his head down on the kitchen table next to his empty plate. He didn’t want to face Sherlock when he woke up that morning. ‘
(Apologies to all of my wonderful readers, I had a very difficult semester at school but finally finished up all of my finals. I will be updating all four of my current stories, thank you so much for still reading and being patient.)
John meanwhile, had tried his hardest to kick out the closet door, but the damn thing was sturdier then expected. He had paused several times, being as silent as he could in the desperate hope that he might hear Sherlock’s voice again. But it never came. He wanted more then anything to believe that he really had heard it before, but if that was true, where had he gone?
Lestrade had nearly given up his search for John when he got the phone call. He rushed over as fast as he could. The sound of things being overturned and gone through were still loud as day. He cautiously took Mrs. Hudson’s spare key and let himself in.
“Well originally they believed something akin to a large predator like creature like a wolf, but I’ve been tinkering with it after all and now I’m really not all that sure.”
Sherlock watched anxiously, his notebook with “John” scrawled across the front in hand. Twenty minutes passed of intense agony. “John, this is really boring.”
“Still standing right here…” Lestrade shifted his weighted, “Oh, and congratulations on the whole dating thing. Been wondering when you two would-“ Lestrade stopped mid sentence as John popped up from behind the couch and came around it.
John took in a deep breath, perhaps he use this to his advantage. "Sir, as you can see I'm really just a regular person and if you would please take me back to my flat-"
So that’s why John kept slipping into plural. Sherlock and he must have agreed to take the case before Sherlock died. It all made sense now. He didn’t want to leave Sherlock’s work undone. He gave John a pat on the shoulder. “Don’t worry, I understand.”
Sherlock turned on the water and the warmth immediately reached John. “Oh, that’s quite nice actually.”
“What?” John’s voice was playful, he knew they should probably plan their escape now and find a way back to their flat from the warehouse and try desperately to find a cure for both of them, but he couldn’t help himself. He was finally,
But John was a fast learner and often deserved more credit then he was given. He diligently practiced for a few days until Sherlock sent him a picture text of his new computer while learning from Molly.
There was a deep snarling coming from the direction they were running towards, John went stiff. A deep fog was masking what was waiting for them.
John’s expression quickly dropped, “Feed me?! What is that suppose to mean? I’m not a pet Sherlock!”
“Any shorter and it would have missed you entirely and you wouldn’t have been in London looking for a flat share. So you’re the perfect height.” He could feel his soldier snuggling deeper into the embrace.
He bit down on his lower lip, he couldn’t believe he was really about to do this. He quickly disrobed and discarded his clothes to the floor. A small button on the bottom of the toy would cause the computer to start playing music and cause it to begin moving, but John decided to save that for a bit.
Sherlock looked around a bit more and spotted his violin. But even if he could move it a bit, there was no way he would be able to play it. He slumped in the chair beside it. He was fairly certain he had heard of ‘phantom music’ before. And he very much doubted ghosts were just playing regular instruments to do it. He looked back at the scarf. It was an odd feeling to see the real one laying there when to him it felt as though he had been wearing it all day. He could even feel the fabric of it around his neck. Changing what he wore had of course been his first experiment in this new form. Again, he doubted very much that he looked remotely like this anymore. Sherlock straightened up a bit. If he could make it seem as though he was wearing clothing he clearly wouldn’t be wearing, why not be able to hold something else that wasn’t strictly real?
Sherlock’s lips curled down, he didn’t want John to find out that he had ripped up the floor boards in search for him the night before, that would most definitely be coming out of their rent.
John was still teary eyed by the time his body was so exhausted that he succumbed to sleep in Sherlock’s bed. He wasn’t sure how the late detective would feel about that, but he still felt oddly welcomed there.
“Oh…” Molly couldn’t remember the last time John had even mentioned going on a date and he didn’t seem the type to actually go shopping with a girlfriend. But then she knew people tended to act a bit different after a traumatic experience, it was plausible anyway. “I’d love to meet her sometime. It’s um.. been a while. I’ve missed you.”
Moran dropped his duffle bag at the edge of the cheap motel bed with a small thud and rustling of metal. He was use to the peeling wallpaper and stained sheets of unfamiliar rooms, but somehow this one brought with it the weight of the world. He flopped down on the stiff sheets face first, not even minding the overly detergent smell. Eventually he rolled onto his back, staring at the ceiling.
“Oh that. A few things, nothing important. Now I’ll test how much you will retain throughout the day.”
“You’re asleep, I can’t possibly eat anything you attempt to cook.” Sherlock tossed the newspaper aside, scooting his chair back as he put his feet on the table.
Mycroft looked at him expectantly. ‘You want your proof?’ The voice hissed in Sherlock’s head. The detective looked skeptical.
A chirp came from John’s pocket. He was suppose to have his cell off during therapy sessions but he often forgot to do so. His therapist looked disapprovingly again.
"And if Sherlock doesn't find me?" he mumbled to himself, eyelids growing heavy and closing. Luckily the jam label blocked out some of the light from the room. He knew the answer. He would be trapped as some rich persons amusing 'pet' or experiment. Even if he was trapped in this height deficient form he rather be in his own flat with Sherlock. At least he had attempted to give him some resemblance of his former life, bringing him along on cases. As John drifted further into unconsciousness he remembered what it was like riding in Sherlock's pocket, the warmth, the smell of cigarettes, after shave, and something chemical- which didn't sound pleasant at all but he found that it was strangely soothing. His mind drifted to the way his flatmate carried him so gently in his hands, he could feel the few calluses he had from playing the violin but his hands were unusually soft other then that. He wanted very much to be carried by those hands again. '
Harry did more then just crack a smile at seeing her twelve centimeter tall brother fuming mad at another man.
if Sherlock was online and his computer was on. That was just not acceptable. He could probably hack the speakers and accidentally hear him or some such rubbish.
“Maybe.” They should keep looking either way. But he was starting to think all that talk of Ouija boards and morgues was just taking its affects on them both. He holstered his gun. “It’s a small flat and we didn’t see anyone else all night. Door is locked and,” He checked the window. “This too.”
“John,” Lestrade had a long pause, as if he wasn’t sure if he should ask him something or not. “Does Sherlock ever avoid leaving the flat? I mean, not because he just hates people, but, like he’s afraid to? Or… during storms?”
John continued to lay on Sherlock’s bed in the fetal position, hugging Sherlock’s pillow close, it still smelled like his over priced shampoo and after-shave. He wasn’t sure how long he had been there like that, but it was too painful to leave. It felt like Sherlock’s presence was right there with him, he knew it was just his grief-ridden mind playing tricks on him.
He bit his lower lip and watched intently until John had clearly finished with a louder moan. Sherlock snap his eyes shit knowing John would want to look back to make sure he wasn’t watching.
“There’s a fucking ghost, get out of here!” he could feel his face already swelling as he stood and made a wild dash to run down the ally followed by his accomplices.
"I'm really sorry about that Lock, he's quite possibly the stupidest person ii have ever met in my life. Just ignore him." John gently took the handles of sherlock's chair and pushed him inside, turning the chair to face him before shutting and locking the door. "Sherlock? Are you ok?"
“Anyone with basic cable knows what that means.” Greg pinched the bridge of his nose. “What does this have to do with the case?” He had a sinking feeling they weren’t looking for a physical intruder.
“Yea, sorry bout that, I should go check on forensics.” Lestrade turned to leave for the other room but stopped when he heard a bemused laugh.
Sherlock looked up at John with a curious expression. John took a step back. By the time Sherlock leapt from the couch and was on him, the shorter man had no where to run. He was forcefully dragged into the bathroom for a very new kind of experiment.
“Sometimes I just feel drawn in there. Like… I know it sounds absurd, but its as if he wants me in there.”
Sherlock’s eyes lighted up in an unexpected way. “Yes, very much so.” He wanted nothing more then to pull John in for a tight kiss, but he knew that was impossible at the moment.
It was strange, Lestrade felt like laughing, but then he remembered he was in a restaurant and everyone was likely staring at him and Mycroft now, but as he caught the tail end of Grace's dramatic exit, including slamming the restaurants door, he heard something wholly unexpected.
John didn’t answer. He didn’t admit to himself until then that he had been trying to be Sherlock. He didn’t want to be him anymore though. Sherlock was still gone, but John Watson was still dead. He needed to be someone new.
“That’s where he said he was going, yea. Why does this matter again?” John furrowed his brow, hoping some explanation to all of this was about to come.
The polish remover was of course in the beauty section, an isle John had never ventured down since he was a young boy being dragged by his sister.
“Work, what does she do for work?” Sherlock couldn’t take her eyes off her. There was no telling if Maria would kill this woman here, a simple flick of the wrist with poisoned nails- no, not that, she had been eating a croissant with her bare hands and had no time to equip such a chemical weapon nor fake nails. No, she was planning a longer death for this one just like the last, more showy at that. The deaths had been escalating. A teaser before she was done with Harry.
“I brought some things that might help, I mean, they might not work… but I thought we could give it a try.”
John had always been considered a 'short' man. It was a cruel trick of fate that he had been tall as a kid, only to never grow another centimeter. Harry had mocked him repeatedly for that and truthfully it might have been a factor when he decided to join the army. John was glad at least that his taller sister didn't see him now, nodding off to sleep in a man's pocket.
“I will, but not in the cab.” He nodded towards the cabbie, not wanting to say it in front of anyone else. “You… wouldn’t have liked the real reason why I was going to visit him is all.”
Sherlock stiffened. In his search of the flat one thing struck him as odd. The kitchen had no knives, the letter opener was gone, and even scissors seemed to be missing. “John tried to…” The worst flashed across his mind.
“You were snogging me senseless in another man’s pocket, I do have standards. But this! Sherlock, I don’t want this. I don’t want to live like this.”
John nodded, “It took you a while to get me to realize you’re here, and I think I’m mostly gliding on faith at this point, how would we tell him?”
Sherlock couldn't help it, he was still nervous as he felt John's fingers hook under the band of his boxers and pull them down, freeing himself in the process.
