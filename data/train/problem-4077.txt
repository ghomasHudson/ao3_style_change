Dean mentally agrees. He knows that, he knows it’s not necessary. But the man in front of him is walking away and he probably won’t see him again, and he’s not ready for it. He can’t explain why, he doesn’t know why his heart beats a little faster when Castiel turns away and calls the elevator, but before he can find an answer his hand his reaching for the duffle bag and ten minutes later he’s cursing himself for not having a dinner table in his apartment, his elbow brushing against Castiel side every three bites, sitting on the same side of the counter to the reheated lasagne Charlie had left the day before.
Dean interrupts the lady, grabbing the phone from where he’d discarded it on the bed to pull a shirt over his head.
"Cas you know I have to do it!" Dean insists, his voice breaking. Castiel knew he was right; he knew that once back into place his wing could start the healing process and the pain would pass quicker. Biting down on his lower lip and shutting his eyes he nods. He didn't trust his voice, and to be honest he didn't even believe he had any anymore, after all the screaming.
"I'm not talking about me, you dumb-"
Dean rolls his eyes. He’d called to get some answers and now he was the one being interrogated
Dean hopes his voice is calm and assuring, but the look he receives from the man beside him is impenetrable.
“Speaking of fast, I see you’re already freelancing…”
"Are you afraid I will hurt you?"
“They called him in, maybe fifteen minutes ago”.
"Hey!"
He watches his brother's ginormous back until it disappears, then gets up to get a fork, taking it back to the table and jabbing it in what was left of the cake, his mind wondering. He was happy they had the chance to do Sammy's birthday right. He still remembered the last time both of them celebrated their birthdays. Sam's was the day before he left for Stanford. They were staying at yet another crappy motel, and Dean recalled being happy, walking up to their room with a bunch of cupcakes he'd been able to buy with the money he won at pool two nights before, feeling lighthearted because their dad wasn't supposed to return from a hunt until the day after and that meant for once no yelling, no arguments. For once he wasn't going to get shoved aside because he had to physically prevent his father to get too close to Sam. Once at the door he'd heard the screams, furniture breaking, the word college being spat out like an insult. When he thought about it his heart still raced. He'd left the cupcakes fall on the floor, bolting into the room, in time to hear John throwing Sam out, in time to watch his brother walk away.
Dean hears Sam chuckle and smiles, bringing into the kitchen what was left of the cake. He was still trying to forget about what Jack had done. He was still fighting against his anger. What Sam kept repeating to him, that Jack did not have a soul at the time, that he wasn't himself, helped a little. Jack was a good kid. He could give him a second chance. Or at least he could try.
Ah there it was. Now Dean was going to tell him that he could never love him. That he pitied Castiel, that’s why he allowed the angel to stick around. He closes his eyes, trying to swallow the lump lodged in his throat
Castiel blinks lazily. Fainting was not an option, not in that moment. He hadn't done anything wrong. If only Dean would listen
It was Monday. Monday Dean usually worked out at home. But he could switch it up and do it on Thursday. It wasn’t derailing too much from his schedule if he just switched it up, and somehow he didn’t feel like staying at home, although the temperature had dropped significantly lately.
Dean scowls at his floor
“Sure. I’m peachy” he replies, not sure why he used that stupid word, but his brain had started to slow down, the adrenaline gone. Then he adds
"Are you Castiel?"
“Age?”
Dean snaps out of his dumbfounded paralysis only when he hears the soft thud of a closing door. Castiel was gone. He slowly reaches the elevator as the doors are opening, and the short man was hopping in. He steps aside motioning for Dean to join him, but he strongly scrolls his head
The back of his eyes sting, and Cas can only presume that it means he’s tired and he needs to sleep. He’s pretty sure that tears should not run down ones cheeks, but that’s probably because his heart is beating almost painfully, his hold on the tape so tight that the shape of it was getting printed on the flesh of his palm. For a moment he feels anger, bubbling in his chest, raising higher and higher.
Maybe it was the tone of the man, authoritarian, firm. Maybe the fact that his name coming out of his mouth did not sound like something dirty or shameful you look at sideways while passing by. Maybe because Dean sounded genuinely concerned, but Castiel stops fighting to get on his feet, raising his head to find green eyes kneeling at eye level. His face seemed both angry and worried, a combination Castiel had never seen before. His eyebrows were knotted together, his strong stubbled jaw clenched. After all, Castiel wouldn't have minded passing out if the last thing he saw was that beautifully sculpted face. Then a finger comes into his line of vision and he focuses
“Wait!”
It does take long. It's half past eleven when a nurse announces that because of an accident everyone will have to wait a little more and it's half past two when Dean's stomach reminds him that he hasn't eaten anything since the day before, rumbling loud enough for the woman sitting next to him to turn around. He smiles, apologetic, rubbing his arms for the tenth time in the past twenty minutes. He was cold. Hadn't thought about that when he was in the car or once arrived at the emergency room, but now, sitting motionless in just his t-shirt, with ac apparently turned at maximum in that tiny room, he kept getting waves of goosebumps. He shifts in his seat again, trying to get as comfortable as possible on the tiny metallic chair, but his butt was starting to get numb. Castiel's voice startles him.
Castiel continues, walking around the counter to grab his bag and pointing with his chin at the mug
"Wow you almost look normal" he remarks, trying to speak with a casual tone.
He sighs, loudly, even though he’s alone and there’s no one who could hear him.
“Dean!” he calls again and finally the man spins around, clothes stuck to his body. If his eyes weren’t so red it could’ve looked like it was just water falling from the sky, damping his cheeks.
"Are you injured?" he inquires immediately, not able to contain the strained worry in is voice raising a hand to grab Dean's shoulder but remembering to stop halfway, Dean's words ringing in his ear:
Almost as he had read his mind, Dean talks again
Dean takes a big breath, mentally preparing his speech, getting ready to explain that it was probably because when he’d put his insurance on the form the day of the accident he might have forgotten to specify who it belonged too, but when he looks down at him instead of the newly prepared apology what comes out of his throat is a strangled “Are you alright?”
"It's fine" Castiel insists, "besides, it's not his fault you weren't looking while walking". He feels strong hands haul him up and the stretch causes his chest to throb painfully, making his knees buckle. Dean's arm is immediately around his waist, keeping him from collapsing again.
The line goes silent for a moment, then
“Hello bitch!” she shouts, but her smile wavers a little upon seeing him and Dean rushes to fix his expression
"We can talk about it when you get better, I don't think you could take me now"
"He's fine. Take the troop out"
"Will that be all?"
"I mean the guy from last night... It was your boyfriend, right? Or just an acquaintance?"
He gets up, tiptoeing to his bedroom door, one hand outstretched, fingertips hovering on the knob. A soft rustling sound was coming from the other room. His adam apple bobs a couple of times before he finds the courage to unlock the door and walk out. Castiel was behind the counter, pouring hot, steamy, black coffee into a cup. His duffle was sitting on one of the stools.
Sam opens his arms in a surrendering gesture
“You’re not real” he repeats, clenching his fists at his side, preparing for everything to go dark again. For the torture to start all over. He didn’t remember when he’d started saying those words, but that mantra was the only thing that kept him sane, that prevented him to wail and scream for everything to stop. A hand on his shoulder makes him flinch, but he grits his teeth, refusing to open his eyes.
Dean stutters and she blows air out of her nostrils, turning away. His mouth opens before he can actually register the words.
“What? ‘course I’m real, Cas you’re home” Dean’s voice cracks and Castiel’s heart shivers a little, because that’s the kind of voice that would have him try to comfort Dean in no time. But he knows better now. For a brief moment he wonders how much of his mind the Empty has read.
Leaning back on the headboard he immediately wishes he had headphones, a slithering high-pitched sound echoing from the speakers as the flaming title – just one word, Supernatural – appears on a black background, but he stops himself from turning it down. Maybe he could teach his dear neighbour a lesson.
Three days later and the wedding was ready, thanks to an over enthusiastic Sam - "Finally! Do you know how many years I had to suffer because of you two!" - and Jody incredibly strong willingness to lend them her backyard. All the girls had helped with the decorations - Claire growling for the whole time but they'd discovered she was easier to coax if they let Kaia ask her to do stuff.
“You couldn’t just leave it alone…”
Dean takes a big breath
"Look! The kid is not even sitting anymore!"
Dean’s heart skips a beat. The woman continues, the smile still showing a set of perfectly white teeth.
The room got silent. The sun had set; the only light was now a lantern on the table.
When the next song starts, he concentrates again. He’d never gotten that far.
"Dean?"
"Of course" she smiles, opening the door and sliding out.
"And you totally look like Bing Crosby" she replies fast, cocky as always, before going to stand next to Donna, who was nervously repeating the words for the ceremony. Dean had asked her to officiate. His eyes scanned the small crowd once again. It was weird, to see so many butchered hunters dressed so nicely. He couldn't remember if he'd ever seen Jody in a dress, but there she was, sitting in the front row next to Alex, Patience and Kaia, all of them looking gorgeous. She waves at him when their eyes meet and he nods back, smiling fondly.
“Dehydrated shrimps?”
"I know Dean. But you like pie."
Before Castiel can say anything the two men that had been shoving his stuff in black trash bags walked up to them.
“Yeah ok, I’m sure there’s something on the radio”
Castiel doesn’t believe his lie.
"Sorry, are you... are you here for Castiel too?"
Charlie squints, staring at him almost as she knew something but wasn't sure she could say it, and Dean's eyes flickers from one point to another. At last she exhaled, her shoulders sinking down like she had physically dropped the argument, starting to rant about how her new girlfriend seemed to be oblivious about some online game Charlie insisted was the most famous in the world, and he gladly let her, relieved about the change of subject.
“Ya think?” Dean snarls back, and immediately shuts his eyes.
“Damn it Cas”.
But Dean didn't leave. He just locked the door and turned back to him.
"Shhh sleep... I'll watch over you"
written in his eyes.
"Before... You said you didn't lie to me because you were afraid, but because you were ashamed... of what?"
"Absolutely"
Dean greets his nephew by scooping him up - trying not to think at how much his side was pulling and stinging - and carefully throwing him around, causing a small fit of giggles to erupt from Sam’s five years old son. They all walk into the spacious living room, where John was sitting on the couch.
“Dean…”
When the door opened again on the sixth floor he sighed, relieved that the corridor was empty. Inside his home he let himself fall on the leather couch, wiggling his body as close as he could to the backseat pillows. He had a lot to do, the house to clean, but his eyelids were heavy. He didn't usually take naps, he always thought they were a waste of time. But the couch was incredibly comfy and his body had turned into gelatin, so he just gave up to the sweet call of unconsciousness, falling into a disturbed sleep, dreaming about when he was six and his father was yelling at him because he'd forgotten to feed Sammy, and about when he was eleven and he'd fallen off his bike scratching his knee, and John had told him to man up and stop crying. And about blue eyes, that seemed to stare at his very soul.
"My name... Joyce" she smiles, looking into his eyes just for a second before bolting out of the vehicle herself, joining the group that was already gathered a few feet away
He carefully places the trench coat on the bed, stroking it with a hand one last time, and that’s when his eyes fall on the cassette tape. He knows what it is of course. It was the only material possession he’d ever owned. Yes, he had had clothes and a sleeping bag when he was Steve, and yes, his picture was printed on different fake badges. But all of those were temporary, never really his. That small rectangle of polyester was the first gift he’s ever received. The only gift actually, and it was the most precious thing he’s ever held. Not the tablets, not the mystical object he had the chance to use.
The doors close and Castiel goes to press the parking lot button, stopping when he notices that it's already lit up. Dean follows his every move, and again his mouth seems disconnected from his brain, because he talks before he can stop himself
"Awww look at that, an angel. Didn’t you all run away? Are you lost?" a demon possessing a blond woman chimes, inclining her head.
Dean had said that in purgatory too, their last time there. He’d cut him off, for once not wanting to hear the whole ‘you’re like a brother to me’ speech, not when he was happy Dean had hugged him again, that brief contact all he would ever get, he knew that, but something he couldn’t live without. He’d heard Dean’s apology, he’d heard it through the prayer, Dean didn’t have to say it again.
Castiel wants to point out that if he knew that pairing up helped in the game it meant he had read the instructions too, but he sighs, instead typing something he hope will close the discussion.
"Dude, seriously, just eat, so maybe you can get up again and avoid getting trampled on"
He follows him.
“Are you sure? You seem… Agitated.”
Castiel doesn’t move, just closes his eyes and whispers “you’re not real”. Like he’s done for the other thousand times the Empty had tortured him with this. It always started like that. He would open his eyes, the gook retrieving itself to show the room he died in, Dean in front of him. The first time Castiel almost believed he was back. Then the Dean in front of him had started laughing maniacally, his face contorted in a sneering mask, and everything had gone back to black.
Dean scoffs. Joanne was fine. They'd been going out for six months steady. Dates once a week, text messages every two days - her suggestion, so it wouldn't feel like Dean was suffocating her. They hadn't really gone pass kissing - five minutes, no tongue - after date night, but he didn't really mind. He was way too busy to think about sex, and to be honest he still had to warm up to her... but there was time.
“Yeah”
“Good morning”
“We’re done here Crowley”
"You know he doesn't swing that way; you should stop coming here to find him" Cas jokes, stepping closer to the other man, waiting for him to take a step back, a waltz they’d started a year before. But this time Dean doesn’t retreat, the change in his behavior confusing Cas just for a moment, before his attention goes to the blood on the man’s clothes and neck
"You didn't"
Dean bites his tongue.
Dean stops. His brain reboots and the he asks
“Goodbye green eyes”
"Cas I don't understand this doesn't hurt this feels nic..." Dean voice cuts off, and Castiel could see something click in his eyes. He stops his fingers, moving back on the farthest side of the bed and laying down on his left side so that he didn't have to face Dean, both wings folded against his back. He could feel the heat on his cheeks, and he shuts his eyes when Dean talked again
He feels the anger bubble up again in his chest, and it doesn’t subside when he reads Gabriel’s next message
He walks out, closing the door behind him and leaving Dean standing frozen in place, mind empty. Castiel was gone. The strange prostitute that lived across the hallway, that he’d let sleep on his couch, was gone. Dean knew he was supposed to be relieved. To be happy. Life was good again, back on track. However, something was off, like a pebble in his shoe, but he couldn’t formulate what.
"I didn't think so... But attractive? Yes..."
"Really? There are still books about angels?" he asks, genuinely curious, and she steals a quick glance at him before launching herself in a heartfelt digression about the topic
Dean brain errored 404, his mind completely empty. When Castiel gets up again his voice sounds a lot less combative.
Cas grits his teeth, holding his breath while pressing even harder against his wounded side as Joyce hit another pothole, making the car shake again. He presses his temple against the window, hoping the cold glass could make his headache a little better. Another bump, this time he grunts
He and Charlie sat quietly for a couple of minutes, simply relaxing in each other’s company, until she slightly jumps up her seat
That’s when the car stops.
The other man squints his eyes, quirking slightly his head
“You look worse than me”
“What?”
“It seems we’re stuck”
"For who? Joanne? It' not like she's..."
The woman looks back unamused.
"Happy birthday Dean" the angel proudly says, a sweet smile blossoming on his lips and reaching his eyes, making the skin wrinkle a little.
"I'm... I am healing her"
He barely acknowledges the girls that were leaving, tired and still a little off from the drug that was circulating in his system, smiling at them tho, whispering compliments on their appearances, as each one passed next to him, one just saying bye, one whispering his name, and a couple scraping their nails on his bare back and chest. He only looked up when the last one giggled a thin "rightfull leader" before walking out.
Jack smiled again and took a step closer, softly shaking his head. “My powers will be enough. I just need you to guide me. To help me make the best choices. As you always have done, father.”
It took them another five minutes until, at long last, Dean saw the ocean and followed the dusty road parallel to the shoreline to find somewhere they could stop and ask, or somewhere that looked inviting enough to stay. And sure enough, at the end of the road between some high trees there was a sign.
The realization almost shocked him a little, though it should have come as no surprise.
Cas drank in every sound, his eyes open as he took in the sight before him, and he felt his own breathing speed up as he thrust up into Dean’s welcoming body, meeting the movements of his hips. Soon, the ferocity of it all made the headboard of the bed thump against the wall with each push.
“Morning,” his brother said as Dean reached the chairs.
in the mood for anything beyond that. He just felt… tense and a little preoccupied.
have. He had been too afraid, terrified even, to be rejected by Dean. All the years he had spent longing for something he, as he had said to Dean, knew he could never have, he had contented himself with keeping those feelings to himself. Treasuring them like something holy in his essence, something he did not have to share for it to be true. Something he knew was just about him, only
“Okay,” Sam quickly replied, and Dean felt so torn. Torn between wanting to take back everything he had said, and wanting to share everything else. Angry at Sam for asking yet grateful for it as well. Angry at himself, for sure, for not knowing what to do or say or feel.
“Ah, Playa Serena. That sounds nice. And there were two, three hotels, too?”
“Then maybe we should do that,” Sam said, and that hit Dean by surprise.
“Eileen and I aren’t getting married,” Sam said, but shrugged, smiling with what Dean clearly understood to be the expectation that this, too, was in the cards for them eventually. “And no, she won’t mind. We actually want to go on a beach vacation, too, sometime, but no offense, that’s something we’d probably want to do alone,” he said with slightly teasingly raised eyebrows.
Dean suspected Sam wasn’t being completely truthful. He did look tired, and he had yawned several times in the past half hour or so, but he appreciated his little brother wanting to keep him company.
“Really?” Alejandro asked softly next to him, leaning in a bit and giving Dean a slightly teasing smirk. “Star Trek? I thought you were into Star Wars?”
“Mmh, my turn,” Alejandro hummed against Dean’s neck, and Dean couldn’t deny that he had been waiting for this.
Alejandro’s brow was still furrowed in skepticism. “Was that another time travel thing, or…?”
The next day, it became apparent that fall was approaching inevitably now, even down here in Mexico. During the day, Dean had made good use of the pleasantly warm weather, lying in the sun and swimming in the ocean, but the morning had already been much cooler. With the sun having long set, the evening was no different, and Dean was wondering whether he should go grab a jacket to put on over his flannel.
“How about,” Cas interrupted him as he slid a little closer again, one hand reaching for Dean’s and waiting for him to entwine their fingers. He looked down at them, let his thumb run gently over the base of Dean’s before their hands clasped a little more tightly. “How about you stop talking and kiss me again, and we’ll figure everything else out when we do?”
Dean nodded, licking his lips, and he watched Alejandro’s hand reach over and pull at the hem of Dean’s boxer briefs to take them off, too. As soon as Dean was fully naked and Alejandro looked at his dick, there was a small, lustful smile on his lips before he bit his lower, and fuck, if that gaze didn’t raise mental images in Dean then he didn’t know what would. They’d have to leave
“If you do, please know you have my sympathy and my gratitude,” Alejandro returned with a mock-exaggerated, consoling tone.
“No, we’re not,” Dean said and, to finally stop beating around the bush, added, “we’re hunters.”
“That must be it, because I’m not very naive or gullible. At least not for some years.”
Cas raised his brows at Dean, though it was rather obvious what Dean meant: that Cas was, in his human form, male..
“Everything okay?” Alejandro asked with a predominantly casual tone when Dean had again been quiet for a while, just sipping his coffee.
Cas’ gaze went into the distance, his brow slightly furrowed, and his head tilted as he seemed to ponder the question. Then, he looked back up at Dean as he came back to the table. “I have no preference. Whatever you were planning, I’ll be happy to join.”
“Most of the hotels are further south,” the guy, who had a friendly, objectively handsome face, gave Dean an apologetic smile. Sam, now next to Dean, raised his hands in a typical ‘I-told-you-so’ gesture, accompanied with a matching glare.
Dean had to laugh at that as well.
, Dean thought,
“Oh? Like what?” Dean wanted to know, and this time, he finally did turn around as much as he had enjoyed Alejandro’s touches.
(Edit: Ah, I found a working link for the video.
Once in it, however, his thoughts drifted to Cas again, and with them came the longing, that deep ache in his chest and stomach that felt like something had torn a hole in him that he could scarcely fill with even breaths. It wasn’t just loss, though, but also the ever-present guilt and regret. If he’d only realized all of this sooner, if he had believed that Cas could even feel this way, or if he’d at least had the guts to try and find out. It was something he could just never make up for, neither to himself nor to Cas.
He briefly contemplated calling Sam again before he got too far, but a part of him that battled with the - very rational - knowledge that Sam would be perfectly okay with this was reluctant to do so. For whatever reason. And so he just drove on, stopped for some food, and found a cheap motel late in the evening.
Just five minutes later, he was in his swim shorts and had his beach towel under his arm as he walked over the warm sand that was crunching under his flip-flop sandals. He left the towel on one of the beach loungers, took off his shoes, and slowly walked towards shore, feeling how the sand, now wet, became firmer under his steps. And, finally, he felt the water around his feet and ankles, each small wave washing around them. It was a lot warmer than he would have thought but still refreshing enough, and Dean waded in further.
And Cas had to laugh, too. Softly at first, but then more heartily, freely as he wrapped both arms around Dean, hugged him tight and felt a chuckle vibrate against the skin of his neck.
Sam shrugged but then shook his head. “No, actually I mean just you and me. Just a week or so. I think… I’d actually like that.”
to save Dean’s. How utterly selfish and ungrateful was he for ever wishing it to end?
Another chapter finished with less than a week between them. A few notes on the previous chapter and some general ones, before I forget it again ;-)
“Cas,” Sam interrupted him again, seriously not wanting
Dean sank forward, breathing hard, and it took a moment to collect himself. When he did, looking down at Alejandro’s sweat-covered face, he saw a drop of white on his chin. Without thinking about it, Dean brought his thumb to it, smeared it over Alejandro’s bottom lip, and kissed him deeply, tasting the saltiness of it on his tongue.
Cas wanted to kiss Dean again, but Dean just looked at him for a moment as if he was drinking the sight in. His fingers came to the side of Cas’ face, gently brushing his skin, mapping each contour in feather-light touches, and then his lips were on Cas’ again, and this time, Cas answered immediately, let them wander, explore, feel and taste - become more bold, demanding and equally giving.
“Well,” Alejandro started and pushed himself back up in a sitting position. “That will all take a while to sink in. If I hear any more tonight, I’m not sure I’ll be of any use for anything else.” He gave Dean a quick peck to the corner of his mouth and with it a promise. And yes, that was certainly better than talking about his life story.
“Cas, I thought I--”
Speaking with Eileen, Claire and Kaia had been fun. It was nice seeing them again and hearing their voices, and the girls had even gotten Miracle in front of the laptop. He had actually recognized Sam and Dean’s voices and whined and barked loudly, which had made them all laugh but had also tugged on Dean’s heartstrings a little. He really missed the pup.
Also, there is a song mentioned here that some of you may recognise ^^
As the days went on, things got, if not a lot but at least a little bit, better. Dean still felt like he both couldn’t trust this new freedom and also didn’t really know what to do with it, or where the road was heading, this time. He could try to find a job, an actual, paying job, like fixing cars, or he could try as Lee had done - just minus the monster in the basement - and open a bar. Now, at the very least, with several days having passed without any sort of hunt having popped up, Dean could not deny that he felt a little bit bored.
He took a sip of the bourbon Cesar had poured him. Just the one; he had set that limit for himself and was adamant about keeping it, nursing his drink slowly instead of pouring it down.
It took a moment, but then the hesitancy in Jack’s question made sense. Cas understood.
“Alright,” his brother conceded before he got out of the car, and Dean followed suit.
“How about we take a shower, get some of that excellent tequila of yours, and see where the night takes us?”
“Tried to eat me alive,” Sam replied and opened a styrofoam bowl before he got a spoon from the kitchen drawer. “I got you a breakfast burrito.”
He knew his brother meant well, and yes, sometimes summer flings could turn into more. Still, even if that were in the books for either of them, the guy lived in Mexico, and Dean surely wasn’t going to drop everything and never return home because of the first guy he’d ever fucked and only known for three whole days. He’d have liked to say that all out loud to Sam, but this whole talking about feelings stuff had never been his thing.
Anyway, I hope you do enjoy the chapter even if it's rather dark. Please let me know.
Despite having done this before, it felt mostly unfamiliar, definitely different than riding a mechanical bull, and it took Dean a while to get used to the rhythm of the gait. Despite her agile movements, the mare was calm enough for an inexperienced rider, and so Dean wasn’t at all concerned and instead focused on his surroundings.
happy for him.
Hope you like the chapter. Please let me know if you do :-)
“I can do both. It’s not that difficult, actually. You just might have to hold still for a moment later,” Alejandro explained as his pencil was gliding over the paper.
“Tampico is a major city, isn’t it?”
“Right,” Sam just said, amused, but there was also that slightly regretful smile on his lips again. This was far from their last shopping trip together. Sam and Eileen had not found a suitable apartment or house yet because they wanted to stay close-by and find something that they could afford and turn into a proper home, not just for a few months. But sooner or later, that day would come, and then, everything would change.
Alejandro was right, and the prospect - vague and far in the future as it was - filled Dean with excitement. “I thought about it a couple of times. Running a bar, or bar and grill even. Not that I ever had the opportunity to do that, but… I think I’d like that. Still, not so easy without the starting money.”
Cas gave a small sigh but grinned and shrugged. “It’s a bit lighter after Tolstoy.”
“You think your dad would have acted like Raúl’s? If you’d figured things out while he was still alive?”
So that was something to tick off of his bucket list. Just that Dean knew now more than ever that it would not be a one-time thing.
He only heard a breathless laugh through the line, and then, with a tone of voice that made him practically see Sam’s wide smile, “Yeah. I’m a
. We have a son.”
cowboys, there’s this really gritty porn movie called ‘
“Uh, yeah. Just had to use the bathroom.” He put on a smile and finally turned to face Alejandro.
Cas knew it was meant to be a joke - a small step of improvement towards normalcy between them - though he did not get the reference. “It’s interesting,” he said. “Entertaining.”
“If I’d known you could cook, I’d have asked you to do this sooner,” Alejandro said, laying a hand on Dean’s right shoulder and briefly resting his chin on the other, peeking over it onto the countertop.
I have not finished writing the next chapter yet, so I can already say that I most likely won't post on Tuesday, but I will aim to finish it by the end of next week. Sorry about that. Hope you can wait a little bit longer ;-)
. Really damned good. And he was confident it was going to stay that way.
He nearly burned the eggs, cursing under his breath when he turned the much too brown ones around in the pan. For a second, he just wanted to throw everything in the trash.
Sam rolled his eyes but grinned while Alejandro released a soft, breathy chuckle. “I’ve got other things, too. Maybe something fruity? Mango, orange, banana, or.... how about a nopal ice cream milkshake?”
“Piece of advice, though,” he said before Cas could leave. He tried to keep his tone free from any exasperation. “Next time, try to just ask him. There’s no shame in misunderstanding things. So… you know. Open communication is key.”
’ Dean felt his nose prickle, his vision slightly blurred, and he swallowed, rubbed his eyes, and tried not to think about this, not to feel this sadness and longing.
“Oh, alright,” Alejandro said and briefly looked around the bar, probably wondering what else they might need. Some of his friends had come over for the night. A bit further down the beach, they were already lighting a small campfire and laying out blankets and cushions for them to sit on, already chatting animatedly and laughing, loud enough for Dean to pick it up even back here.
Dean felt strangely… torn. He should be looking forward to spending the night with Alejandro again tomorrow, and the most significant part of him did. But there was also this strange, heavy feeling in the pit of his stomach that darkened his good mood, and it didn’t entirely go away, even when, much later, he and Sam wished everyone a good night and walked back along the beach to their apartment building.
“Thanks,” Dean said, smacked his brother on the back and headed out.
“She’s good, huh?” Alejandro said next to him, leaning in a bit so he could keep his voice low. “She’s got some of her stuff on youtube and has quite a large following already.”
water, and he didn’t really believe in things like elemental theory anyway. What he could not deny, however, was that he felt drawn to it.  Maybe it was the peacefulness of it, the vast blue, unfathomable depths that stretched far beyond the horizon, or it was the way the water made him feel -  energized and refreshed after the first swim in the morning. Sometimes, when the sunlight was bright and the early day clear, he could allow himself to look at the particular shade of blue and get lost in the color. Only for a moment. A moment short enough to not let the vague feeling the color stirred turn into something more tangible. Something that became too much to bear.
He had his back turned towards Dean, and couldn’t hear him approach over the music that was still playing softly as he struggled with the hinges of the wooden pane that he used to cover the main entrance. Dean hadn’t meant to startle him, but Alejandro jumped a little when Dean got there and lifted the pane to help it slide shut.
So here's chapter two. Thank you for the kudos and the lovely comments! I do hope you enjoy this second chapter and that it gives you a bit of summer in your hearts and minds in this tough and - at least here in Germany - grey winter.
Alejandro considered him for a moment. Then, getting on his toe-tips behind the bar, he pulled his tank top up and the waistband of his shorts down a little to reveal a smaller, different version of a devil’s trap based on a heptagram, just about two inches left and down from his navel. Unlike Sam and Dean’s black one, his was outlined and adorned with some color, making it look very different and less conspicuous than theirs.
“Yeah. Didn’t want to wake you.”
“Sure. Go ahead, Picasso,” Dean replied, humour coming more easily than he would have expected. He gave the other man a crooked little smirk when Alejandro let his fingertips slide down Dean’s chest as he got up from the bed. Then, he walked back over to where he had been sitting earlier and continued his drawing.
Thank you all for your comments to the last chapter. I
Without a word, Alejandro opened the fridge, took out a bottle, removed the cap, and set it down in front of Dean.
the life of a hunter, did not constantly remind Dean of it.
Sam took a slightly deeper breath and pursed his lips in contemplation. “I dunno. I kinda always wanted to run a marathon. So maybe I’m gonna try to work towards that.”
And so, after they had finished their beers, the two brothers headed back to their apartment a good twenty minutes later, and Dean shot Alejandro another apologetic smile, drinking in the one he got in return.
And yes. Dean wanted that, without a shadow of a doubt.
Dean could not help the feeling that he might actually be blushing at those words, lowering his gaze and grinning to himself as he looked through some other items on display.
“It’s just a casual vacation fling. Why do
blond as a kid! See? And now it’s all coming out again. Besides, compared to most people around here, you’re practically platinum blond.”
Hey guys, thank you so much for the lovely comments for the last chapter. It warms my heart, makes me proud and a little sad that the same time that you are going to miss Alejandro and that you liked him so much. That character became bigger and more layered than I had initially planned and anticipated. I miss him, too, but I can tell you, in my head canon (that I spent quite a lot of time on ^^), good things lie ahead in his future eventually.
“Oh, it was bad, Sam. That poor horse probably never had anyone as unrefined sitting on it as you,” Dean shot back, thinking about their time-traveling adventure to the Wild West. And yeah, the fact that those twenty-four hours hadn’t allowed for him to have a full Wild West gunslinger experience was regrettable. He had always wanted to ride off into the sunset on a horse, like a hero in a Western movie.
After a while, Yolanda suggested they’d try a trot, and that definitely was a little harder to manage and not bob up and down awkwardly with each step. Once he had gotten the hang of it, he just amused himself watching Sam, who had a slightly harder time not looking like a clumsy idiot. When they switched to a soft canter after a few moments longer, things improved for both of them despite the gait’s faster pace.
training, catching up on the lore, or taking care of Sammy had been a moment wasted in John Winchester’s eyes. And Dean had simply internalized all that so deeply that it had still affected him, even way into his adult years, long after his father had died.
is awesome.”
His phone chimed again, and he found a video link Claire had sent him along with the words
Suddenly, images stirred in Dean that he had not seen in his mind for a very long time. A boy, sixteen years old, big grey eyes and light brown skin and a smile on his lips that had immediately brought one to Dean’s too whenever he’d seen it. Dean had liked Matt, had started to become friends with him even though he knew it wouldn’t last because they’d be on the move again soon, and he’d have to go to a new school. If he was allowed to go again at all. Dean hadn’t known what it was between them; he had liked girls, found them pretty and attractive, had kissed Robin just a few months before, and the concept of anyone feeling the same way about girls and boys had simply never crossed his mind.
Admittedly, the area they were currently driving through didn’t look very inviting - there were some small buildings scattered along the main road left and right, framed with bush and grassland, and the beach nowhere in sight, but Dean was not going to give into Sam that easily. They had already been driving through Mexico for roughly eight hours now, and Dean didn’t want to make another stop before finally reaching their destination.
“Uh, it’s not about… that. But about,” he cleared his throat awkwardly, “sex.”
“Sometimes yes,” Cesar replied with a small smirk, and Dean wondered, with a pang of shock, if he really was that obvious. “Other times, it’s just small things that make you wonder. I guess it was something in the way you reacted when we told you we’re married. The way it gave you pause.”
“Oh yeah? No surprise when you’re walking around looking like…” He made a waving motion with one hand up and down in Sam’s direction, “like a brunette Chris Hemsworth.”
Alejandro followed the direction Dean was pointing at and then looked back at him, brows slightly raised but a smirk around his lips at well. “A cowboy hat? Really? You can get those anywhere at home. Get a proper sombrero,” he said and picked one up from the rack to put it on Dean’s head.
For now, he shrugged slightly and said, “Well, the lyrics are a kinda… not what I’m feeling right now.”
As Dean raised his bottle as well, his thoughts lingered briefly on their exchange. Maybe there were things he was
long. So, just have a nice, pleasant moment between the brothers.
“Huh, who would have thought.”
“Alright. How about we grab some sandwiches and then go for a walk with Miracle? The weather is kinda nice today,” he suggested.
I hope you like the chapter. :-)
Dean should have known, and he cursed himself for being so transparent when he really didn’t want to be, wanted to just enjoy himself and have a good time with Alejandro. “Nah, it’s okay,” he said, making a waving motion with one hand. “I mean, I wouldn’t want to dump all this stuff on you. Plus, I’m really fine.”
“Oh, no, no. I’m not going to some big touristy resort. I just want to enjoy the beach and some good food and mingle with the locals. Didn’t you say there was something down here?”
“Dean, I’m sorry. We can just forget--”
“Aren’t you tired?”
As he went back to his room sometime later, not tired yet but exhausted nevertheless, he didn’t know what to do, what to occupy himself with. He tried to listen to some music, but it either felt too loud and harsh, or it tore at something he didn’t want opened. He didn’t want to let out the emotions the melodies and words could trigger. He drank another beer, and then another, starting to feel drowsy but still too restless to sleep.
Dean relaxed a little, or resigned even. Leaning back against Alejandro’s embrace, he closed his eyes for a moment, taking a slow, deep breath, and another. “Sorry. It’s just… some stuff on my mind.”
Dean spent the entire afternoon at the aquarium, watching all the different creatures - from small fish and all sorts of mollusks, as well as penguins and sea otters - both of which were insanely cute - to the various species of shark that swam around in the biggest tanks. While he didn’t care that he was one of the few adults who were there alone, he wished Claire could see this, wondering how often she had gotten to visit such places before her entire life had been uprooted and her childhood cut short. A moment later, he remembered that she
Apparently, his brother seemed to get it, turned around, and soon was breathing evenly and slowly in his sleep, and Dean followed just a few minutes later, the sounds of the waves coming in through the half-open balcony door making it a lot easier to focus on nothing but that.
“What am I supposed to do?” he whispered as his thumb brushed over Cas’ image.
“How his father hit him in the face and kicked him out when he found out he was gay.” This part was easier to mention than anything about his own life.
“I hope for Eileen’s sake your house has two bedrooms. The poor woman doesn’t deserve this,” Dean went on, and yeah, maybe he was being a little childish, but he didn’t care. “At least she can’t hear your snoring.”
“I thought I’d… get a beer in the meantime,” Sam said, mildly defensive. And yeah, well, he couldn’t have known.
“Alejandro’s,” Dean said, pointing his thumb towards the sea where the man was still swimming his rounds. He took the t-shirt and put it on his own chair instead.
“Uh huh, yeah, those seven years between us really make a gigantic difference,” he leaned in to kiss the skin below Dean’s collarbone, then further up his neck and to the line of his jaw, before their lips met. It felt nice, as kissing Alejandro always did, and Dean definitely could not say that he was
. It’s a bit like rummy. Not too difficult to learn.”
Dean looked down at his plate, still not eating, and he let out a sigh, both resigned or regretful and… strangely relieved. “No, I guess I wouldn’t have,” he admitted.
Two young women had come in, both of them extremely pretty, greeting Alejandro with words that were uttered way too quickly for Dean to even try and follow them. One of the women was slightly shorter than the other, and she instantly seemed very warm and bubbly, her big smile making her eyes shine as she continued to chat animatedly, getting friendly and welcoming replies from Alejandro.
Also, several chapters back, one of you (sorry for not remembering the name) was talking the difficulties Cas might encounter once he's back, and that has also helped me with some things I'm addressing here. Don't worry though, no real drama or negativity, just a few bits and pieces that the boys need to figure out.
“Sam,” he replied through gritted teeth, shot Alejandro an apologetic half-smile, and turned around. “I thought you were face-timing with Eileen.”
Dean could have quit, could have finished him off with his hand, but somehow that was out of the question. He’d tasted him before, tasted himself on Alejandro’s lips multiple times, and none of it made him think of Alejandro coming in his mouth as anything undesirable. He was just a little caught off guard when, about a minute later, he felt Alejandro’s release spurt inside Dean’s mouth and hit the back of his palate. Dean could just so stop himself from coughing as he let Alejandro’s dick slide out of his mouth. He swallowed and cleared his throat before a grin formed on his lips.
"Cas!" Dean almost whined and the angel sighs
Castiel’s eyes don’t leave his plate. He swallows, answering while impaling another bite.
Castiel retreats one step, but before he can argue again a nurse shouts his name, and after glancing back one time he follows her, disappearing behind a set of doors.
"Not helping..." Cas replies to him, clenching his jaw and swallowing, looking away at Dean’s hurt eyes and to the girl, who had gone silent
"You have questions?" he asks, rhetorically of course, and they both scroll their heads, running off.
Claire walks up to them, the flowers basket empty, a trail of petals behind her. She was wearing her hair down in soft curls, and a light blue full skirt dress that made her look almost angelic. Of course, her signature heavy winged eyeliner was ever present.
The stood up all night falling asleep on the couch, the half-eaten pizza they'd ordered at one point sitting on the coffee table in front of them.
He had proposed to Cas a week after they'd managed to rescue him from the Empty. They were laying in bed - well... they almost always were, poor Sam had to learn the hard way not to run into Dean's room gun blazing every time he heard a scream - next to each other, Dean's head pillowed on Cas shoulder, one arm swung over his body, the angel fingers softly grazing up and down his forearm. Dean loved those moments. Because yes, the sex was amazing - the best he’d ever had, and he had had a lot - but those moments, the closeness, Cas's solid presence and warmth against him, his breath and heartbeat, his strong and protective embrace. Dean had never experienced it before. Because with the girls he had to be the strong macho man, and with the few men... Well their encounters had never been as nice or as long. So he loved that part, loved it enough to find the courage to admit it to Cas, the third day of his return. They were undressing each other, hastily, and between kisses and moans he had admitted that more than the sex that night he was looking forward to the after. Cas had stopped immediately, slowly pushing him away, not too far but enough to look at him in the eyes.
“He thought you were a client”.
He leans on the wall outside the emergency room, almost to prove a point. His brother had decided to call him just when they’d finally found an empty chair, and he had walked out of there backwards, making sure Castiel wasn’t going to get up again.
Castiel eyes remain squinted, his head quirked, but now there's a line in between his eyebrow, and Dean doesn't like it when he stares for too long, he doesn't like how it makes his blood rush to his face. He gestures to the seats, just to take those blue eyes out of his
"What?" the man askes, a mischievous light flickering in eyes.
“Promise?” the man asks, voice almost wrecked, and Castiel nods, he shakes his head up and down with all the strength he has left because of course he was going to stay next to Dean, even if it meant dying.
Cas shoulders drop. He could understand. When he speaks again he’s staring at the road in front of him, his knuckles turning white from how hard he was gripping the steering wheel.
Dean’s not shouting, his voice nothing more than a whisper, barely audible over his pacing back and forth inside the tiny room, still those words whip the air and make him flinch. Castiel doesn’t answer. He’s not supposed to. That’s how it was now, between them.
"Richard said that the Camp has enough doctors, what it needs are soldiers..."
"Cas..." Dean whispers again, reaching for his face and rubbing away tears he hadn't realized were flowing steadily from his eyes, and he fought with the instinct to lean in his hands.
"uh?" Joyce replies, startled, confused by the last exchange of the two men, but one look at Dean made her decide it wasn't worth risking her neck to inquire about it, backtracking slowly to the door
"It's not necessary"
He pondered the question. Yes, Dean was going to be really mad. At least that new Dean.
"Oh... there are no seats now, but you can go... I'm sure they will call me so-"
“How is it? Does it hurt?”
unspoken but completely clear.
"They said you were running a fever, so they gave you some antibiotics" Castiel continued, gesturing to his hand and looking down Dean sees the IV needle stuck in his arm. He whimpers, looking away abruptly
"Sammy, still ridiculously tall I see" he replies, stepping in just for a small child to run up to him and collide with his legs.
He tries to focus his eyes on her. She was still bleeding from the cut on her neck, the blood shining bright against her pale skin. She was holding the steering wheel with both hands so tightly that her knuckles had turned white.
Dean just nods, following him into the kitchen, where Eileen was helping Brian sit down on his chair. The food smelled delicious, and Dean recognised Sam's touch. He tries to sign hello to his brother's wife, still feeling stiff and awkward whenever he tried to use ASL. He'd tried to watch tutorials on how to sign simple things - John kept reminding him that was stupid, Eileen could read lips, why would he do that. He still made stupid errors, like the one he must have made in that moment, because Brian laughs - the kid was better at sign language than him but not a good empath yet - and Sam pats twice on his shoulder, sitting down to eat. Fortunately, Eileen was always on his side, so she just signed thank you, smiling brightly and motioning him to sit with them.
"Well, he's not in here now"
Dean turns around, his eyes dipping on her hand and then back up, and she retrieved it like she had just burned herself
“That’s French?”
Castiel’s wing is being pushed into place before his brain can register it, then every nerve in his body catches fire. The sound that came out if his throat was inhuman, his body almost jack knifing off of the bed. Red dots danced in front of his eyes, and all he could feel was pain, white burning pain. After what seemed an eternity his vision cleared and he started to perceive his surroundings again, to feel the skin on his right side that was pulling and stinging, his right wrist that was throbbing and his head that was spinning so fast the only reason that prevented him from falling on the floor was Dean's left arm wrapped around his torso. He pulled in another ragged breath; the air seemed incredibly thin. He was shaking, harder than he ever had.
Castiel furrows his eyebrow, asking cautiously
“What’s the plan?” Sam asks, bringing the half full of tea mug to the sink. Cas stutters a little, now that he had to go right to the point he was lost
“I am his… partner”
“You mean you promise not to try to kill yourself again?”
Maybe he was afraid Castiel would sue him, that’s why he was showing so much concern, but that was screwing with his ability to think straight and Castiel needed him to stop coming around. He would’ve left the store already if getting that job hadn’t been so easy, and not being completely broke was nice. At least he could eat. It was with a certain feeling of pride that he saw the man blush at his words, flustered looked good on him, but Cas relaxed only when he walked out of the store, clutching the candies to his very toned chest.
Light shined through his closed eyelids, and Cas felt his body slowly being pulled into consciousness. Immediately he felt numb pain in his right wing. His side was burning, probably because he was laying on his wound. He stretched out, carefully, feeling his muscles protest.
Castiel stares at the screen, hands hovering, the balloon of irritation that had sewll in his chest deflating rapidly as a red rush crept up his neck and cheeks. He quickly searches for a way to delete the message, but apparently it wasn’t a feature. That was the fastest – and the crudest – he’d ever come out to someone. He’d accepted himself long ago, but he’d been shamed or threaten enough during his twenties to make him a little more careful when it came to his sexuality. That’s why he’d mostly only dated through apps – never more than one dinner usually – and then he’d accepted a secret relationship, that not only drained his finances but also his spirit.
Dean wonders if that Crowley had called Cas after their phone call, the other night.
he hears the demon chirp, opening his eyes in time to see her strutting away. Somewhere in the back he hears a high pitch grunt, and fighting against the white hot pain that made little black dots blink in front of his eyes he turns, his side burning angrily in protest. He has to blink thrice before being able to make out the form that the older demon was pinning on its knees by the hair.
Castiel is nowhere to be seen so he prowls around, picking up things and putting them down immediately, without paying attention, his mind on hold, when a familiar low voice makes him whirl around
She was staring at his wings, her mouth slightly open. Dean seemed to notice but before he could say anything Castiel intervened
He sits on his bed, not really sure what to do next. The light in the room was dimming, so the right course of action would’ve been to turn on a lamp. But now that he was resting he didn’t feel like getting up again. He was also hungry, he recognised the rumbling of his stomach, the sound similar to what would produce a very loud frog. But again, to eat meant to get up and find food, and his legs were now against that idea.
“I could ask you the same” then adds “Is this where you’re sleeping?”
"Nothing"
“I mean vaginas are not my type”
Castiel gut twists with guilt, but Dean voice is soothing when he speaks again
“I came by to take care of this. I knocked but you didn’t answer, so I thought you were having one of your orgies. I was going back to my barrack when I met Chuck. He told me that you didn’t answer to the girls either and he confessed about the sedatives, so I ran back here.”
"Eat. Small bites, and drink some water, you're probably dehydrated"
“I… I’m gonna go now…” says Chuck from the door, the last thing Cas hears, because his vision gets hazy and soon he’s spiralling into a restless sleep.
"What's that supposed to mean?"
"Who are you?" Dean inquiries, military tone back in his voice, furrowing his eyebrows, and the boy falters
Ragged breaths were all he could take in, knowing very well he was not going to get up again, his head was ringing and he could not hold the blade properly with his right hand. It was the end, and he wasn’t even too bad. He was starting to think that his death was going to be for an overdose. At least in that way he was helping Dean. It was an honorable death. He closes his eyes, ready to face the end, but the final strike never came.
“Cas, voulez-vous coucher avec moi, ce soir?” he recites, mentally patting himself on the shoulder for how smoothly it had come out of his mouth. But his pridfull moment doesn’t last long, because Cas's reaction is not one he’s expecting.
"Cas"
He’d tried to listen to it during one of his and Dean’s car rides, but the man had immediately forbidden it, cutting his questions with a harsh “you listen to that thing alone. You understand?”
"What?" he whispers, wondering if the blow to his temple had somehow damaged his hearing
She smiles and moves away to let him sit at Cas side, who was laying on his back propped on a pillow so that his wings wouldn't get squished.
“Do you have any idea how much you scared me? Don’t ever do that again. I already lost Sam. I can't lose you too”
"Castiel are you ok?" Dean asks again.
He lets his eyes wonder on the small crowd that was already seated on plastic chairs, tastefully decorated with blue and green roses. Not exactly something that grew in nature. A bush had suddenly sprouted in a corner of the bunker three days before, Jack's gift to them.
Suddenly feeling very tired Dean sits in one of the chairs that surrounded the table in the room. He didn't know either, what kind of relationship he had with Castiel. The former angel was the one who raised him from hell, the one who rebelled for him against his own family and nature. He was his best friend and, even if Dean was never going to admit it, not even to himself, something a little more. At least to him. Then the apocalypse had crushed on them, Dean had lost his brother, he failed Sam, and because of that he had ruined humanity. All that was happening was his fault. And even if Cas had tried many times to convince him otherwise, he did not believe him.
After ten minutes of silence he settles on a very simple explination. He felt responsible. And he never backed down from responsibilities, whether it was taking care of Sam, taking care of someone’s mess at work, that’s where he thrived. It was his fault the man had lost his job. He should fix his mistake. He didn’t mean to phrase it like that though.
When he leans back Cas fidgets a little, trying to gather his thoughts, but all that comes out is
"What demon?"
"Oh, don't worry about it"
“You’re leaving?” he asks, like it’s not as clear as glass. Castiel nods.
“And what does it mean?”
The angel eyes didn't leave the floor
“Through these doors, room 78”.
Castiel's voice sounds weird to Dean's ears and it takes him a good five seconds to understand why. The man's voice is gruff but soft, not smoky and malicious like usual. Dean just nods. Without his usual hooded stare and flirty smirk Castiel looks like a different person. His features are softer, the blue irises lighter under the bright hospital lights and the ever present five o' clock shadow looks darker. The man takes a couple of steps to get next to the bed, his eyes not leaving Dean's, and somehow that made him more uncomfortable than when he checked him out in the corridor. He squirms a little.
Flopping on the bed and pulling his laptop closer he opens Gabriel’s email to find the invite. Apparently, the game was not out on the market yet, and you could play only if you got sent a link. Castiel had never been into online games and starting to play now felt silly. He was in his late thirties, for Pete’s sake, full of debts and alone.
"So..." he finally asks, trying to relax his face and shoulders as he turns back to face the man, burying his hands in his pockets "What brings you in my den, rightful leader?"
“So?” Dean yells, shaking him, and almost as he’d turn on a switch Castiel feels his body tremble uncontrollably, the shivers starting from his very core. His mind automatically forms the words I’m sorry, but only drool comes out of his mouth, quickly wiped away by Dean with his sleeve, maybe a little rougher than necessary.
That would've been the right time to stop, walk to his car and go get some coffee - and maybe some common sense. But Dean is tired, and his brain is still logged off.
"I mean the hug"
“Won’t that be close by now?” Dean asks, ten minutes on the road, only getting a shrug in return. He drove with one eye on the road and the other on the passenger, half his brain trying to come up with a conversational topic, the other fighting the nausea.
"Well, that's stupid"
"I can't say..." he insists, making it a point to stare at the beer in his hand
"Are you sure?"
"Sit and wait for when you get called" she repeats, so he does, not without missing the confused look in Castiel's eyes. It last for a second, but it's there.
"He was neither" he finally replies, glancing sideways, and Dean's neck hair stand to attention, because the blue eyes are colder than usual. Maybe he had crossed the line. But that morning his brain is dead, not working, gone on vacation, and his gut tells him that since he was already over that line, he might as well keep going. He squints, quickly darting his tongue out to wet his lips, nodding his head
Charlie's voice was suddenly low, and he worries he'd actually made the strained sound out loud.
“Don’t worry”
“You’re not real”
"It's nothing new really, I'm fine now..." he continues, trying again to push himself away, but Dean's arms didn't budge, instead they pulled him even closer, the space between them was so small he could feel the other's chest brush against his knuckles, carefully drawn to his own body, every time he exhaled.
“I… we are…”
They had not brought anything that could kill demons, they were not supposed to be there at all, according to Richard and his scouts. He had two choices. Keep doing what they were doing and leave, abandoning Team one to die. Or move out now, alert team one and leave the city before the demons could reach them.
Cas refrains himself from stating his true opinion, rolling his eyes so hard for a moment the road disappeared from his vision. What he really wanted to reply was not appropriate for her age, so he settles for a seemingly innocent questions, regretting it immediately
"Okay... I will tell Richard to round up some people... come to my barrack in three hours".
"Yeah..." Dean replies, confused by the sudden change in his mood.
“It’s called blushing, you idiot, and I mean kissing. Kiss me again. Now.”
"Wanna talk about it?"
“Cas?”
"Are you alright?"
"Sam said you were probably going to get out of celebrating your birthday, and I agree. That's why I'm not giving you the chance" Cas grins, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes and Dean - he couldn't believe it himself and he would probably kick his own ass for it later - Dean actually lowers his head, flustered, squirming in his seat, because Cas looked so good sitting there at the table, in the kitchen, in front of him, a picture so domestic and so reassuring that he almost slips up and confesses.
"Hello Dean"
“I’m just saying” his brother insists, turning a page of the book in front of him “You two used to watch movies together, you can start to  patch things up like that, and-“ he raises a finger, knowing that Dean was ready to rant about how everything was just fine “you can say it in French, to impress him. He always brags about how many languages he knows.”
"I'll take them back"
"Good to know".
"Hello bitch! How's it hanging?"
"A cut"
"I... was afraid..."
Castiel watches them disappear, then take one long breath. Moving slowly he walks to the corner, rounding it and finding himself face to face with three black eyed figures. The demons stop dead, and Cas is pleased to see shock dance on their faces.
"It's dangerous! You have to change it, sooner or later it will collapse on someone!"
Dean doesn't know how long he stands there, looking at the bright copper H6 sign on the white painted wood.
He rotates something silver in his hand and Cas recognizes his angel blade.
"Dean...? Are you ok?"
"Are you cold?"
That is why he was rubbing his temples, staring at the phone that he had just hung up, meditating if 3 pm was too late for lunch. His side hurt, again. Had been for the past three weeks. He knew aspirin on an empty stomach was not ideal, but he didn't really have time to run to the bakery down the street and get something - he was excepting a call in twenty minutes. Pressing a hand on his side he bends slowly to pick a white rattling bottle out of the lower drawer of his desk, downing a white pill without water.
