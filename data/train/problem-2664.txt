He steps back and lets the lip of the crop brush over Sherlock's buttocks. The black leather is a stark contrast to the pink skin.
Sherlock just shrugs helplessly, yet still careful as not to risk another cut.
It doesn't take long before the first streak of hot come form their audience hits Sherlock's forehead. As the good whores they are, they stop kissing, allowing their mouths to fall open to catch what's offered. Soon, another guy shoots all over both their faces, and that sets them off to start licking ejaculate from each other’s cheeks and chins. It's not kissing, its just greedy lapping and sucking, interspersed with some lustful biting.
“And who are you?” John asks curiously. “Please tell me you won't keep up the persona of Miss Violet Smith.”
“Th-thank y-you.” Sherlock stammers.
“Now, shall we begin?” Irene asks. John looks over at Sherlock and nods.
“Yes, you will.” Sherlock licks his lips while his hand slowly trails down his chest, circling one nipple before reaching lower until he wraps his fingers around his already half-hard cock. He starts stroking himself, keeping his eyes fixed on John.
“You can shower, afterwards. Be thorough. And by that I mean really thorough.”
“Should we talk?” He asks.
----------
“Please...” he whispers.
A fist hits him just above his left kidney and all air is knocked out of him.
Instead of taking offence at Sherlock's condescending tone, Irene drops the riding crop and smiles. “Sergeant? Would you be so kind to take this silly bitch to the next room and start to... interrogate her. Make sure she answers to you properly.”
John watches him suffer, a grim smile on his face. He's hard again.
Sherlock nods.
“The tawse was used in Scotland and the North of England up to the early 1980s.” Mycroft explains in his crisp nasal voice above Sherlock's screams. “I remember watching thrashings at public school until they were forbidden by the European Court of Human Rights. What a shame that was. It would have done Sherlock much good if they kept it in use.” John hums in agreement. “That's what you get for bed-wetting, little brother. Well deserved punishment, don't you think?”
Looking down, Sherlock can see John's big cock slide in and out of him as he sets a fast rhythm. It doesn't hurt, quite the opposite, and as John starts to hit his prostate with every third or fourth thrust ,Sherlock knows that he won't be able to last  much longer.
“Get up on your knees.” John had ordered, pulling an almost boneless Sherlock up, and then had wanked him while Sherlock looked on, resting his brow against John's shoulders. He'd watched fascinated ad John had brought the cup just below Sherlock's cockhead and caught the thick white stripes when they'd started to pulse out of Sherlock's red, glistening slit as he'd come and come. He'd nearly filled half the cup before he the spurting abated to a dribble. Sherlock had been whimpering with sensitivity by now, but John had continued to milk him until he'd been spent and dry.
----------
“We'll attach another bag to your catheter. For later.” Mycroft chuckles.
The neoprene hugs him tightly, enhanced by ropes braided around his rubbery cage. He can breath just fine, but is unable to move. If need be, he could somehow wiggle out of the cupboard (the doors aren't locked) but it would be a challenge. He writhes a little in the sack, experiencing how strictly it holds him, how utterly helpless he is. It's intoxicating. He's lying in the dark, waiting to be used, the only sound his ragged breathing. He moans behind his gag as he bites down onto the short bulbous part pushed into his mouth, even sucking it a little. God, it's lovely, just what he needs. He wishes for it to never end. But then the end might be even sweeter than the lustful agony of anticipation.
“You won't believe what happened.” John shakes him awake, waving a newspaper in his hand.
He looks delicious, all taut muscle and sweaty skin. John's eyes meet Sherlock's over Marks shoulder, and he blinks, silently transmitting his consent.
“Massive. Like being ripped in half.” Sherlock pants. “I missed you. I missed this.” He holds very still and concentrates on his breathing.
----------
“Greedy slut.”
“Hello Mycroft.” John's voice is firm.
To distract himself from those dangerous thoughts Sherlock speeds up, riding the bottle as if it's John's huge cock. Meanwhile, John rubs the object of Sherlock's desire against the side of his face, his balls hitting Sherlock's chin. Sherlock holds onto John's hips and thighs to steady himself, to pull him closer, offering himself to John any way he likes him, breathing him in while being subjected to his whims.
“And when I deny it to you?”
Suddenly, Mark throws his head back in ecstasy, panting hard. Sherlock moans into his gag, slightly raising his head with to meet Mark’s rocking body, pushing the toy into his spasming hole as firmly as he can.
“Shut up and take it.” He hisses, but Sherlock continues to writhe on the bed and whines, his idle hands grabbing the sheets until he can't endure the pain any longer. He cups John's hands in a frantic gesture to make him stop, gagging and coughing so John looses his pace. Bubbles of spit well up in the corners of Sherlock's mouth. John slips free, thick beads of gooey saliva covering his cock and dripping from Sherlock's mouth, smearing the mess all over his face.
Sherlock's completely undone.
“Who knows? The more dodgy we look, the deeper the police will dig. So we better volunteer. Or solve the murder for them, quickly, so they won't have to investigate us.”
“How dare you...” John balls his hands to fists at his side.
“For your entertainment, I want you to suck on this dildo while I'm out. This will be the next toy I stuff you with so you better be thorough.” John holds up a large black rubber dildo and Sherlock almost snatches it from John's hands and starts to lick and suck with abandon. John strokes his cheek and as he feels the hardness of the toy beneath Sherlock's skin his eyes go dark with desire.
“As you rightly mentioned, I was averse to the pissing... thing, at first.” Sherlock gives a little embarrassed cough. “Therefore, I suggest that you give me nothing else to drink as your or my bodily fluids until I'm used to it. Aversion therapy.”
John can hear the tabs being turned and the water starting to run.
Sherlock sets the mug down and stares at him for a long moment before suddenly dashing into the corridor, pulling on his coat. John follows him onto the landing.
“See, John, it's always the same. It's never his fault, there's always someone else to blame. I've put up with this attitude for too long. It's time my brother learns a lesson in taking responsibility. Actions have consequences, Sherlock. This is one of them. Don't struggle, just let Doctor Watson do his job.”
He quickly slicks himself up and grabs Sherlock's hips. At the first push against his already taut ring of muscle, Sherlock reflexively clenches, but Mycroft continues to press forward. Suddenly, the head of his cock glides past Sherlock's sphincter and is swallowed by Sherlock’s body. Mycroft stares down, watching mesmerised as his cock is sucked inside Sherlock's body, already filled with another hard cock. It's not only the feeling of Sherlock's hot, wet heat around him, it's also brushing against John's shaft that sets Mycroft's blood on fire and makes his nerves tingle.
“My two sons joined under one roof. Is it my birthday?” Sherlock's mum chirps, blissfully unaware of the undercurrent of those remarks just exchanged. There are actually two separate conversations taking place in the same room. “Mind, you usually don't even turn up for that occasion.” The smile Sherlock's mother gives her younger son is somewhat tight.
But John is determined. “Don’t give me that, Sherlock. I could see that you got angry when he sucked me off. Tell me why.” John demands.
Ah, clever John. Sherlock smiles as he lowers his head into the bowl. The condoms are slippery and smell of latex, musk and salty come. He presses his face into the mess, deeper and deeper, turning it this way and that until John pulls him back by his hair. Acri sits next to him, grinning, touching the small of Sherlock's back, his fingers ghosting over the scar tissue there.
Sherlock swallows audibly. “Please, John, hurt me.” He gasps.
When John removes his fingers, Mycroft is leaning over. He holds a piece of melon in front of Sherlock's mouth to bite into it. But instead of letting him chew it, Mycroft closes the distance and sucks the fruit from Sherlock's mouth, his tongue darting out, licking at Sherlock's shiny lips. Sherlock opens under the onslaught, offering himself up, whimpering with need as his eyes flutter shut. Then Mycroft is gone again, leaning back in his chair, but Sherlock can see the bulge between his crossed legs, ruining the line of his bespoke suit.
Sherlock takes a deep breath and relaxes. After a moment, his piss starts to flow, quickly filling the bottle. The splattering noise is strangely loud in the silent, stuffy room.
John showers Sherlock thoroughly while he squats in the bath tub, arms wrapped around his lean torso. He's allowed to take a handful of Ibuprofen afterwards before John applies a cold compress to his nether regions. With that in place, he very thoroughly brushes Sherlock's teeth and rinses his mouth. Finally, he uses loads of lube to remove the cock ring. Sherlock whimpers as the blood flow to his penis and balls is restored. His painful erection flags quickly.
Sherlock is panting hard and almost unable to stand any longer when John enters the room about five minutes later. Sherlock's face is burning. He's only able to take quick, shallow breathes, and black spots dance before his eyes as he's on the verge of hyperventilating. His balls feel drained, yet there's still more clear fluid trickling from his slit.
“I want your come inside me, please, John, let him come inside me...” The kick to his arse he earns for this demand nearly sends Sherlock off balance.
Sherlock lays his head against John's collarbone. John’s arms wrap around him, not sure if he'll ever be able to let go again.
Mycroft gives him a stern look before saying something to the room of people over his shoulder and following John across the hall into the study.
Sherlock is swaying slightly, his spine arched. His cock has started to fill, jutting half-hard out in front of him. The muscles in his lean arms and legs are twitching as they have to support his weight now. It's not painful – not yet – but dangling in mid-air a few feet above the ground is a rather disconcerting feeling nonetheless.
John really had no idea who he'd been meeting. An old friend of Sherlock with a message from beyond the grave? An old enemy, still holding a grudge, out to settle the score once and for all? Some lunatic, who'd lured him onto the continent to share a particularly crazy conspiracy theory (there had been some disturbingly insane posts on the blog last time he'd bothered to look)?
“Oh, Sherlock, we tried that. Look at the mess you made. I'm so disappointed. Greg's piss, so generously provided, just streaming out of your hole. I get the impression you don't cherish his gift.”
“Open the straps. Take the dildo out.”
“Fuck yourself on it, nice and slow.” John tells him, and Sherlock does. He slides up and down the glass cylinder, his pink rim pulled taught around it. It gets easier after a while.
As Sherlock is crouching on his hands and knees in the tub John makes him beg again. "What do you want, Sherlock, tell me?"
“I have a few ideas how you could make it up to me.”
“I don't think so.” John states.
“There have been so many instances when you've acted like an annoying prat, little brother. Do you remember the Bruce Partington plans, for example? How many times have I sat here and imagined you, tied down onto this beauty, helpless, at my mercy. Well, I think it's time to turn this fantasy into reality. It'll get you in the right mood, I'm sure of it.”
Suddenly, something wet hits his left buttock. It's not piss, because it's just a singular, sticky glob. It's not ejaculate either – not viscous enough for that. Ah, it must be spit then. John's? He has no idea.
“Don't follow us. In fact, you might want to ask your host about recording devices hidden in this room. I'm sure that'll be rewarding.” John hisses. Some of the men turn towards Mycroft, glaring at him angrily.
“I can't remember. He drugged me.” Sherlock states aloof.
“Y-yes, Mycroft...” Sherlock moans, because Greg is again caressing his rim with two fingers of his free hand.
“Now, gentlemen, please, be my guests. Have at him.” John has opened a drawer and hands out condoms. “Sherlock, sweetheart, don't you think you could be a bit more... accommodating to our guests?”
Sherlock squirms again and is nicely reminded of the object up his arse. “It's nothing specific. It's more about sensations. Being held down, being confined, tied up. This sort of thing. Restraint, unable to move, helpless. To be at someone's mercy, to surrender. That sort of thing.” Sherlock looks up through his lashes, a light blush darkening his pale cheeks.
Sherlock hangs up and outright beams at John.
“So you know who was with those two tonight?” John steps up to Sherlock's side.
“Fuck, Sherlock, do I have to teach you how to suck cock properly?”
“I told you, guys, all laid out and ready to be used.” John answers as he moves around the group, looking sternly down at Sherlock. “Aren't you, love?”
Suddenly, Mycroft steps up in front of Sherlock, a leather belt in hand. He quickly fastens it around Sherlock’s neck, the black leather a stark contrast to his pale skin. Sherlock doesn't resist, doesn't fight it. He's too far gone for that. Only when Mycroft pulls the leather taught does he try to say something, but his voice dies in his throat. His face slowly turns almost purple, his eyes protrude from their sockets and his hands clench into fists at his sides. John can feel Sherlock's hole flutter and contract around him and speeds up his thrusts.
He's sobbing with relieve, even as John smears his come all over his face. Sitting back onto his heels, he lets his head drop down to nuzzle briefly against John's collar bone. John allows him a few moments of rest and closeness.
John had only met Sherlock’s parents once. They'd been in town to see a musical and had visited 221b before. They had struck John as surprisingly ordinary. Nice, a bit boring, just typical English pensioners. How they could have produced children like Sherlock and Mycroft is totally beyond John.
“Very nice.” Mycroft murmurs. Sherlock needs his brother to touch him again and tilts his hips, pushing his arse up, but that only earns him a sharp slap to his left cheek. Sherlock gasps and shivers all over. “Bit overexcited, though.” Mycroft comments.
“John. Please, John, fuck me. I need to feel... I need this. Please.”
“Yes. We couldn't leave you alone. Not in your state. Despite, we have to talk. But have some tea first. Though, you shouldn't eat as long as you have that tube down your throat. Which will stay there for some time. But that's for later.”
Sherlock feels content and guilty at the same time and it drives him mad.
“Look at you. Slobbering all over yourself. You have no idea how hot you are like this.” John grins. Sherlock stays kneeling on all fours, held in place by the heavy bucket that would rip his rings out if he dared to get up.
In the evening Sherlock is sitting at their kitchen table, bowed over his microscope, when John comes in from a walk. He's carrying three shopping bags from Tesco and just huffs in annoyance when realising that the whole table is occupied by Sherlock's equipment. He is forced to balance one bag on some papers piled high on a chair while setting the other two bags down on the counter. But there's just not enough space as John starts to put away the food, so eventually the bag on the chair slides down and apples spill across the floor, rolling in every direction.
“No, I wouldn't.” John confesses.
Sherlock has a hard time on the cab ride back to 221b. Even as Irene had paid more attention to his back, and John to his cock, his arse hurts and sitting is uncomfortable. John had washed him and had tended to the welts and wounds, patched him up and rubbed soothing ointment into his skin, but still, Sherlock's whole body aches despite him being high on endorphins. The pain, however, is somehow eased by John's hand on his thigh, caressing his bandaged left knee. Sherlock needs John's help to get out of the cab and limps towards the door while the cabbie watches both of them with a suspicious look on his face.
Sherlock sighs and opens his bleary eyes as John sets him down onto the mattress.
“Did you touch yourself, then, in your wet sheets, smelling of piss?”
“Greedy bastard.” John presses two fingers down onto Sherlock's prostate to shut him up.
“Good boy.” John's praise is like a soft blanket, hugging Sherlock's hurting body.
“I agree. He didn't deserve to die like this.”
“Not much.” He takes a step forward and the sound moves inside him. Sherlock can't suppress a moan. “Oh god... it's... painful... upsetting. Wow... it's truly shocking.”
“Ok, get up now and bent over.” John's voice is smooth and dark. Sherlock gets to his feet and leans over the table until his upper body is flush against the cool table top. He's glad to be able to hide his burning face.
And finally, John seems to have mercy with him.
“Good, your mouth... your filthy whoremouth. You'll service me with it today until your jaw aches, like the good slut you are. That's what you were made for.”
Leaving the whipping room behind, they enter what seems to be the last chamber. It's slightly larger than the others, with some kind of podium at its far side, on which is set a huge four poster bed like on a stage. As they get closer, Sherlock sees a very handsome middle-aged man lounge on it – fit, short brown hair, wearing a purple silk dressing gown (Sherlock longingly remembers his own he'd had to leave back in London...). He's surrounded by four absolutely stunning boys – they can't be older than twenty – stroking his skin, kissing him in turns or sucking at his nipples through the cool thin fabric covering his body.
“We should clean him up now before his wounds get infected.” Irene reminds John. But John can smell Sherlock's sweat and blood and musk and suddenly he knows that if he won't be fucking him right now his balls might explode. He's so hard he has trouble to unzip his trousers.
They both have to hold their breath, and only when John is sure that he won't come right here and now does he tentatively start to wiggle his fingers inside Sherlock.
“You do as you're told, Sherlock. And I am telling you now to get on your fucking knees for me.” John's voice is low; not sharp, but assertive, unwavering.
“Indeed, John. We're not sure if Moriarty wanted to get back in the good books with his former associates by exterminating you, or if he was driven by genuine hatred, but the murder at Miss Adler's seems to have been set up to specifically target you, Sherlock. Moriarty knew that I frequented said establishment.”
Now, John sets a sensuous pace, the needle sliding in and out of Sherlock's erect penis. It doesn't outright hurt but is still odd. The needle is not as big as the catheter had been, but as it moves back and forth, the friction provides an unfamiliar yet rather thrilling sensation.
When he's sure Sherlock won't pass out, John puts his pants back on before he gets a glass of water from the kitchen – but no towel. Piss, spit and come are apparently to stay. Sherlock smiles, still dizzy, wearing John's bodily fluids like a badge of honour.
“I want to put you inside of it for the night.” Sherlock can hear the hint of a question mark at the end of the sentence. He knows that he could opt out if this now. But he doesn't want to, despite knowing that this will put him right at John's mercy. But hadn't he been there for quite a long while already?
“No, there's a room in the basement I have in mind for this. It's specially furnished for medical proceedings.”
Half an hour later, they are sitting in a cafe, nursing an espresso each and some cream filled cannoli. Sherlock crumbles his pastry absent-mindedly, licking his fingers between sips of strong coffee.
“You are still not fully recovered. Can you feel the water dripping out of your arse? You can't clench your muscles properly. See, that's why I'm not fucking you.”
John reaches out and tenderly touches Sherlock's face, stroking his thumb over Sherlock's bottom lip until Sherlock parts his lips and sucks the finger into his mouth. He suckles and licks while humping his fist, and his eyes flutter shut as his tongue caresses John's calloused thumb.
John's hand starts to fist his shaft, and Sherlock moans with a mixture of want and disappointment.
But it's only granted after yet one more challenge: Sherlock has to put a beer bottle up his arse and fuck himself on it to completion; he isn't be allowed to use his hands. It takes Sherlock quite a while, but John has fetched some lube so Sherlock is eventually able to sink down onto the green glass cylinder. It feels amazing and the men film Sherlock on their phones as he stretches his hole beyond what he thought possible, impaling himself while squatting on the floor, reduced to a moaning, needy thing.
But instead of the expected next round of flogging John grips Sherlock's chin and rubs his thumb through the blood on his lower lip. “Look at me.” John whispers, and as Sherlock's eyes flutter open, John tells him in a dangerously low tone: “I'm going out now. I leave you here. When I return, I'll bring a few mates back with me. And you'll serve them. If you disappoint me again, I'll report back to your brother that you are a dead loss. You know very well that this might not just be a figure of speech, don't you, Sherlock?”
“So they don't know? That you are alive?” John’s not sure if he approves.
“Fuck off, Mycroft.”
“He vouched for Saint Clair.” John states.
Sherlock can sense both men standing close behind him, feeling their body heat, listening to the whisper of their clothes. He feels exposed, vulnerable, being totally naked in their presence, and the thought makes his swollen cock jerk between his legs as a thick bead of precome wells up from the slit. The heavy chain pulls at his nipples, the pain sweet and agonising, toned down to a throbbing numbness, only now and then interrupted by a sharp spark that goes straight to Sherlock's groin.
“So you do fantasise. What about?” John sounds intrigued.
“I told you, he's behaving like a cheap horny slut since we started. He's been absolutely gagging for it 24/7. Nothing's been out of bounds. He once fucked himself on a beer bottle just to get something up his arse.” John pinches Sherlock's cheek. “Isn't that right, Sherlock?”
“He saw the piercings.”
“You mean he wants to see you.” John murmurs into his shoulder, unwilling to open his eyes just yet, relishing the warmth that radiates from Sherlock's skin.
“Take it. Swallow.” John hisses, and Sherlock drools even more as his throat muscles spasm around John's cock until he retches painfully and his vision goes dark.
“What?” He blinks rapidly for a few times, trying to focus on John as if seeing him for the first time today.
John is squatting down by now and has opened the bag’s front zipper to part the fabric, smoothing it out. He's offering his hand to Sherlock again to help him sit down. Sherlock holds onto it as he lowers himself, his heart beating fast and hard against his ribcage. The neoprene feels surprisingly soft against his skin.
As it's already afternoon, John opens the wine, sloshes half of it into a pan and throws the chicken leftover into it as well before heating it. From what's left in the bottle, he pours himself a generous glass that he empties while stirring the meat. On his empty stomach he soon starts to feel a little tipsy. He takes it as his reward for dragging his body out of their warm bend. When the alcohol in the pan has been reduced to a thick gravy, he cuts the strawberries in half, puts them in a bowl and pours the yoghurt over it.
“If you don't believe me, take a look at his laptop. I'm sure he filmed himself while he was engaging in those auto-erotic practices. Now, if you excuse us, John and I have a rather pressing appointment with your superior officer.”
Come is dripping from Sherlock's mouth by now. He feels full but can't get enough. Each condom tastes different. The spoon adds a special note of lewdness to it, like he's having an exceptionally sordid dessert in a posh restaurant.
And suddenly there are five fingers inside Sherlock, pressing, rubbing, fucking him. He feels filled to the brim but somehow it's still not enough. The pain has receded and he therefore spreads his legs wider and pushes up his arse, inviting the intrusion, seeking to be good for John. He's offering himself up on a plate, all for John to take and claim.
Until the doorbell rings.
There's a case the next day and during the following 36 hours Sherlock and John run around London, inspect dark alleyways and search even darker dwellings before cornering the young but fierce leader of an all female money laundering ring in a chip shop in Hackney. Sherlock knocks her out with a frying pan as she tries to slice up John with a butcher's knife and that somehow seems to restore some kind of truce between them. In the cab home Sherlock looks intensely at John who stares out of the window and doesn't turn, not even when Sherlock whispers “Doomsday.”
“And the girl?”
Sherlock shifts on his knees and sighs. “No.” He breathes.
But as he's slowly coming round, Sherlock decides to make an effort and open his eyes. John is sitting next to him in bed, the
“Let's get some breakfast. Well, food at least.” John suggests some time later, glancing at the clock on the nightstand, but Sherlock doesn't move.
“Didn't you guess, little brother? Well, apparently, your brain seems to be preoccupied with other sensations.” Mycroft's eyes travel over Sherlock's body, taking in the bruises, cuts, his caged cock, laced-up waist and taped nipples. “I wanted something that described our relationship, but wasn't too overtly offensive. All those sluts, whores, holes... a bit crude, don't you think? Alas, not fitting for something so very delicate like you... us.” Mycroft smiles. “It says Blutschande. It's German. Old-fashioned word for incest. I thought it was perfect. Like you.”
As his arse is gaping open, Mycroft swiftly makes good use of it, pushing all the way in until his balls hit Sherlock's slightly sticky perineum. Sherlock chokes on a moan, because his brother's cock is much longer than the plug, filling him to the rim. Without additional lubrication, they both can feel every move much more intensely.
“Play with your nipples.” John rasps, his eyes heavy lidded as his hand speeds up. Mark's hand leaves Sherlock’s throat, making it easier for him to breath. Sherlock tries to inhale as deep as possible through his nose, smelling lube and sweat and sex. The man above him is breathing heavily as well, his rhythm quickening.
“Why don't you find out, Doctor Watson? You're the medical man here, after all.”
“Bed. Now.” John tells him, and Sherlock skitters over into their bedroom as fast as his smarting arse allows. “On your hands and knees. Face the headboard.”
“Move, please, John...” Sherlock actually tries to rock back further and John has to grab his hip with one hand to stop him.
Sherlock does as he's told. John follows a few minutes later with a transparent plastic bag, a role of gaffer tape and a pair of bandage scissors in his hands.
John reaches out and tenderly touches his thumb to Sherlock's lower lip, stroking it, spreading the sticky, wet remnants. Sherlock bucks his hips and arches his spine and sound and plug move inside him in unison, setting his whole body alight with arousal. His pierced nipples peak, the rings gleaming in the candle light.
He pushes the first one open. A post-mortem is clearly in progress. John mumbles something intelligible, sounding vaguely like an apology, as he retreats.
John's face comes into view then, his chin still glistening with saliva. Sherlock reaches out and brushes his fingertips over John's swollen lips that had just been sucking on his anus moments ago.
He gets up quickly afterwards and pulls Sherlock's boneless body back into a sitting position, propping him up against the large grey couch next to the rug. Still, Sherlock has trouble staying upright until John unties his hands and massages his arms and wrists to get the circulation going again, giving Sherlock needles and pins. After a moment, John wraps his arms around the shaking body of his lover, who clings to his sturdy torso like a drowning man.
Mycroft makes a few choked sounds as he comes in his office at Whitehall, and Sherlock closes his eyes to imagine his brother stroking his big cock to completion over a picture of his come streaked face.
“And do you?” Acri cocks his head ever so slightly, a dark spark gleaming in his deep brown eyes.
“Sherlock...?” But there's a knock on the door, and then the guard puts his head inside the room and signals with a stern look that John's time is up.
“No, you don't. Now lean back.” John looks at him sternly.
John starts to stroke Sherlock's hard and leaking cock with one hand while he massages Sherlock's rounded belly with the other. Sherlock bucks into his fist, throwing his head back, almost sobbing with pleasure. His balls are pulled tight and the pins must hurt like hell, but he doesn't seem so care.
He knows that he could have killed Sherlock tonight, and that Sherlock would have let him, willingly. They are living in symbiosis, a co-dependent unit. They belong together. It's beautiful.
John feels like someone has landed a punch to his gut. It's a physical pain, spreading from his abdomen into his chest cavity, making him feel icy cold all over.
It's not wholly pleasurable, though. The slight pain, the odd feeling of being stuffed where usually nothing is put into, the unfamiliar stretch and burn soften Sherlock's cock. Therefore John is able, after a little adjustment, to lock the chastity belt again.
Sherlock wrecks his brain to calculate something according to temperature, Molly's weight, height and the size of the freezer, but Moriarty must have given him something else than just Chloroform – GHB? Rohypnol? Ketamine? - because he can't come up with a sufficient answer. Jim waits, having by now cut off all the buttons, parting the thin fabric to take a look at Sherlock's pale body. His roaming hands distract Sherlock further.
His hand wanders along Sherlock's torso, slipping under the cool satin again, caressing one nipple. Sherlock arches into the touch as the flimsy kimono parts. The thin satin flutters open over Sherlock's pectorals, revealing more flushed skin and the suspender belt around his waist. Sherlock's belly is almost concave, and the glistening head of his cock peaks out of the small knickers. There's a dark damp spot on their front, and John makes a disapproving sound.
Eventually, he must have fallen asleep again (or did he just zone out?) because the next thing Sherlock knows is that he is roughly manhandled and rolled onto his stomach. The cold piss starts to slosh around again, and Sherlock nearly loses it as he can feel it running over his skin inside the bag, rivulets seeping over his arms and legs, drenching his groin and chest as he comes to lie on his front.
John's thorough and takes his time, checking the sutures every second stitch. It takes altogether fifteen stitches until Kate is sewn properly shut, only the catheter tube protruding from the seam between her legs, angry dark yarn against slightly swollen, sensitive skin. Finally, John once again dabs disinfectant over the fresh seam and admires his work.
He thought about the photo rather too much for it to be considered health.
epilepsy–“ Sherlock had been talking to John from the other room for a while now, but his voice faltered as he returned to find John staring down at the photograph.
“Are you, er…?” John wasn’t even sure what he was trying to ask necessarily, but he needed some confirmation from Sherlock that this was what he’d been wanting too. Because John had been wanting this for much longer than he himself had even realized.
What he wasn’t prepared for was nothing.
“So…you’re going to leave then.”
John looked over at his friend in surprise, catching the barest hint of a smirk on his lips as they passed a brightly lit restaurant.
At her words, John had feel Sherlock’s glare pressing on his face like a physical thing, and he’d stared innocently up at the ceiling, his face a careful, non-smiling, neutral mask. Not smiling even a little. Nope.
The rodent, however, appeared to be in no such hurry. John took stepped tentatively forward, arms held out, anticipating a chase. The mouse continued rotating the morsel until there was nothing left and reached for another piece.
It was something John couldn’t explain to other people who knew Sherlock, because as far as he knew he was the only one allowed entrance to this secret corner in the vast and intricate labyrinth that was Sherlock’s life.
And it said something about John’s mental state and frankly bizarre relationship with his flatmate that his first instinct was the find the vulnerability a little – endearing.
“Sherlock, are you-?”
“Would you really be okay just pretending this never happened? If you wanted something—“ Sherlock’s eyes jumped up to meet his own, bright and sharp and blue. “If you wanted something,” John repeated, “You’d be fine to just ignore that and pretend like it didn’t matter? Like it didn’t matter that you wanted it?”
What in the
He’d gotten a noncommittal “Mmmm” in response.
There was, however, a photograph.
There was a beat of silence and then they both burst into laughter. John couldn’t come up for air for what felt like hours.
“What did you imagine we’d do, hm?”
Too much caffiene, then. Right.
Still, he slept better than he had the previous nights, knowing his friend was home.
He did a lot of thinking.
Sherlock’s tiny gasp of surprise only drew John closer. He leaned down over the man and let his hand come up to firmly hold Sherlock’s head in place. After a moment he pulled away to study him the way an artist pulls away to consider the brushstroke he has just made. Sherlock’s expression, though shocked, clearly was not one of horror and disgust, so instead of letting him take a moment to recover, John mercilessly pulled him in for another kiss. He’d waited long enough. Both of his hands slipped into dark curls, cupping Sherlock’s skull in place as he pressed their mouths together.
“I’m testing their responses to a variety of threatening stimuli.”
John sat down. The typing continued. He stared at Sherlock for a full minute, but the man took no notice of him.
It was a long three days, during which Sherlock did not respond to either of John’s texts.
He’d just walked in on Sherlock having a wank.
John threw an arm over the back of the chair and turned towards the noise.
“Are you sure you’re alright?” he asked again, although his voice sounded off, too low.
Sherlock cried out and his hands scrambled for purchase across John’s back. John worked them together, his hand growing slick. Sherlock was breathing too raggedly to be able to kiss him back now, and John watched Sherlock watch John’s hand pump between them.
“You’ll probably figure it out on the plane ride there anyways,” John remarked, fixing himself a cup of tea as Sherlock bustled around the flat. Sherlock was packing such seemingly random objects into his travel bag that John couldn’t help but wonder if he was playing some kind of practical joke on him. Why on earth could he need two unopened packages of chopsticks and a book on the history of rotary dials?
Sherlock gathered evidence for a couple more hours, but as night rolled around he had pretty much exhausted any clues in the area. They took a cab back to Baker Street.
Sherlock moved his head from John’s hair to nose down his temple, settling his mouth next to John’s ear.
His clothes hung off him as if they didn’t fit and his shoulders slumped along with his bowed head, making him look defeated. He seemed to march with a wearied sort of exhaustion that coloured the air around him. John’s already white skin seemed so pale it was almost translucent, and he no longer appeared to be the social butterfly he always was, his interactions with others seemed purposefully limited. Sherlock could see the pain he was hiding under his well-constructed mask of normality.
“Wh- “John stammered. He began to squirm against Sherlock, trying futilely to escape Sherlock’s grip. First, he tried to bring his arms up and wedge them between his and Sherlock’s chest but there wasn’t enough space between the two men to allow it. After that he made some attempts to push Sherlock away by using the brute force of his body. Perhaps, it would have worked before Sherlock had left, but in John’s current, emaciated state he stood no chance. Sherlock steeled himself as he felt John shifting against him. He pressed harder into John, forcing him further back into the door.
“John,” Sherlock said gently, almost carefully. “Let me go.” He was greeted by prolonged and tense silence. “John.” His voice firmer to the point where he sounded as if he were reprimanding the ex-army doctor. “Let me go.”
John surged forward. His stomach lurched and twisted and the tears running down his face intermingled with the sweat. The darkness of the room cloaked him; although, he could make out his surroundings well-enough from pure muscle memory. The feel of Sherlock’s thin bed sheets twisted and warped around John, covered in his sweat and bunched up where John had thrashed around were like manacles. Loud sobs tore themselves from John’s throat. The force of the cries was almost overwhelming, John keeled over as his abdomen clenched and his muscles tensed to accommodate the gut-wrenching wails. Eyes, blurred with tears and body shaking like a leaf clinging to a branch amidst a storm, John tore himself from the bed, feeling as if it was constraining him. He stumbled onto the floor, guilt clawing up his throat and releasing itself in whimpers and whines.
A solitary tear drew itself from Sherlock’s eyes and meandered down the sharp lines of his face. “John. John. John. John.” Sherlock murmured, the fear in his friend’s voice had stung Sherlock’s heart. “I am here. I’m sorry I ever left. I won’t leave again I promise. John. John. John.” Sherlock’s arms, without losing any strength from his firm grip, slid over John’s torso until he had a near painful grip on John’s shoulders. When he was certain that John was secured, he slid around the shorter man and came to stand in front of him.
A fresh wave of tears welled up in John’s eyes. Almost sheepishly, John ducked his head. The distance between them made Sherlock’s skin itch. They had spent so long so far apart and the hour that they had spent together they had constantly been touching. Over all of the years that the pair had lived together, touching had never been part of their everyday existence. Sherlock always ensured that all touching was measured, planned or entirely avoided. The fragile concept of masculinity had always put a certain amount of distance between John. Touching was always a rarity reserved for dire situations or necessity. Perhaps Sherlock’s mind was clouded and overloading with emotion and confusion, but he had quickly grown fond of the sustained contact he had shared with John. He even felt that he had begun to crave it.
Pain struck Sherlock at the expression distorting his dear friend’s face. John’s eyes were screwed painfully tight and his mouth was contorted into a half-open silent cry. Sherlock brought his hands from John’s shoulder, gliding over the flesh of his throat, up to John’s cheeks. It felt so natural for Sherlock to so lovingly frame John’s face. He rubbed his thumbs over John’s cheeks, wiping away the tears as they fell. They stayed like that for a moment. The noises of the mundane world waking up around them played as background music to the two men. Sherlock was acutely aware of his surroundings, as he always is. Out of the corner of his eye he could see people beginning to drive through the area, the occasional pedestrian from a late-night escapade were also beginning to appear. Wanting to avoid a spectacle, Sherlock once again stepped closer to John, pulling him flush against his side. Using his black trench coat, he covered John as well as he could and began dragging him back to the flat.
John groaned and dragged a hand down his face, he needed to move. His eyes were gritty and he felt the annoying prickle of stubble covering his jaw. With a great deal of effort, he managed to heave himself out of his chair, which he had begun to sink into, and shuffled his way to the bathroom. Upon turning on the lights he immediately regretted it. The harsh, white lighting made him squint as he turned to the mirror.
“Mycroft stop, don’t apologise. It’s fine. Do you feel any better?” John interrupted. Mycroft looked up, surprised at the sincerity in the ex-army-doctor’s voice. The two men sat in silence for a little while, both uncertain of what just happened and what happens next.
It wasn’t a real question. Because of course Sherlock knew why there was blood on John’s shirt. If Sherlock had felt up to it, he could have said how old the blood was and the brand and thickness of the razor used to spill it. Regardless of how much Sherlock already knew, he was struggling to grasp the truth of the concept.
Sherlock felt perverse. There was something nauseating in the horribly exposed way John was positioned. He was lying unconscious on the floor, his clothes pushed up to bare his chest and stomach, Sherlock’s hands pressed flat to the skin of his chest, under the jumper as he crouched over him. Nevertheless, he couldn’t tear his eyes away.
“How?” John choked, extracting himself from Sherlock’s grip to look him in the eye. Sherlock didn’t let him go entirely, instead he slid his hands down John’s back to rest on his thighs as he kneeled on the floor. This time it was John who rested his hands either side of Sherlock’s face, holding him still as he stared into his eyes. Shock and awe and loving amazement shone through John’s gaze. It left Sherlock in a similar awed silence, it was an amplified version of how John would look at him when he uncovered a suspect through the most miniscule details. As always, Sherlock felt the overwhelming need to impress his dearest friend. However, looking at the fond amazed look on his face that Sherlock loved but seeing the underlying grief and sadness, Sherlock couldn’t bring himself to unload more upon him tonight.
“I’m so sorry,” his whispered to the prone form beside him, pulling John’s jumper back down to hide the scars once more. Sherlock knelt forward, hunching over John’s chest, bowing his head down.
“Sherlock get off me. I’m serious, leave me alone.” John thrashed more violently but still to no avail.
John lifted his head from where he was staring straight ahead to the black sky before falling back to the black water.
“You left.” John whimpered. His lower lip trembled although he tried to still it. Again he refused to look at Sherlock, instead staring resolutely at the upturned collar of Sherlock’s trench coat. “Not only did you leave but you lied. Because it’s fine to lie to John. John doesn’t matter enough for me to be honest with him. He’s not smart enough to understand my great master plans anyway. I don’t even need him so why wouldn’t I leave.” His voice raised as he mimicked Sherlock but lower to almost a whisper on the last sentence.
“John.” Sherlock said almost sympathetically, sad surprise in his voice.
Sherlock was shocked at the single syllable. It was hesitant and his voice had wavered on the lonely word. Sherlock lifted his face from John’s neck to stare at the back of his head.
He had expected anger. Was prepared for John to lash out and punch him in the face. Or perhaps he would have been happy. Maybe he could have gathered Sherlock up into a crushing embrace as he celebrated his return. That outcome was perhaps a little optimistic, but Sherlock would have happily taken a punch to the face over a suicide attempt. John was not supposed to do that. Never in any of Sherlock’s calculations and risk assessments and possible scenarios would John ever have done that. He was a happy man. A strong man. He was a survivor. He was supposed to grieve and move on a build back a life for himself and then welcome Sherlock back into it when he returned. Not end it all in a desperate, ill-thought out suicide attempt.
“John,” Sherlock whispered. Another jolt.
John grabbed his jumper from the bathtub and pulled it on over his head. The blood from his sides stuck to the jumper and pulled the rough fabric of it against his irritated cuts. Dropping the razor in the sink he stumbled out of the bathroom, not bothering with the light. Quickly, his eyes scanned the dark apartment for the vague outline of a pair of shoes. He spotted some laying on the floor by the door and stumbled over to them. Supporting himself with an arm against the wall, he shoved his feet into the trainers, the backs of the shoes folding uncomfortably under his heels. Ignoring it John unlatched the door, swinging it open. From the corner of his eyes he saw his keys, his hand half-way to them before he hesitated. Does he need them? Is he coming back?
He pulled his phone from his pocket, eyes scanning over his messages. His first reaction was to go to Mary and take comfort in her warm embrace but at the moment the thought of her worry and coddling didn’t appeal much to him. The next choice was Lestrade. He and Greg had become friends over their mutual link from Sherlock. John trusted him and regarded him as a close friend but the John felt a similar reluctance to be surrounded by his worry and grief. That only left Mycroft. Usually John was sceptical at best about the older Holmes but at the moment his usually irritating lack of emotion seemed welcoming. John pondered how best to word his message to the usually detached man before settling on:
“Thank you, for meeting up with me and I’m sorry again about Sh-your brother,” John said lamely after a moment’s hesitation. Mycroft just nodded, equally lost for words and turned and walked into the house, leaving John to follow.
The skin of John’s hips were a mess of scabs and scars. Some were silver-white streaks flecked over his hips, some were thin, skin-coloured lines tentatively dotted around his waist and stomach. The newer ones were a vast array of angry-crimson slashed and thick purple scars stretching down his ribs and playing over the top of his stomach. Three were fresh. Oozing, open wounds pulsing out blood in fat viscous droplets that ran over his sides in a race to the floor. Dried blood had been smeared around the cut by his shirt, forming patchy red spots that were already dry and flaking off his skin.
“John,” he whispered as he reached his friend. Sherlock resumed his earlier position by planting his hands firmly on John’s cheeks and gently tugging his head up to face him. Instead of having his eyes shut as Sherlock had presumed they would be grey-blue met with teary blue-green and it felt as if a jolt of electricity passed through Sherlock.
Mary. She was right, John hadn’t seen her in a while. She fussed over him at first, insisting he stayed at hers instead of being alone. John had thought of staying with her, he had, really, but overall what he wanted was to just be alone with his thoughts. There were other messages on his phone that he hadn’t bothered to check. Some were from Lestrade, one from Harry, even one from Mycroft. Most of them were much of the same. Messages of condolences, asking if he was alright, a few from Lestrade were offers for them to grab a pint somewhere.
He didn’t want to breathe.
“John,” Sherlock said in the unique tone of is that was somewhere between gentle and firm. He wanted to say more. To reassure John that he wouldn’t leave, that he wouldn’t leave ever again. He wanted to tell him to stop. He wanted to ask him to talk to him again. He wanted to ask John to lift his jumper, so he could see, because he knew how to deal with what he saw, that way he could asses and analyse and solve. What he settled on was saying John one more time in a slightly lower tone, almost as if he were pleading.
John stood abruptly, albeit shakily, and began to stalk away from Sherlock. For a split second when he turned his eyes flickered from the door to the hall to the bedrooms as he briefly contemplated which one to go for. Before he even managed a step forward Sherlock was up and trying to grab him from behind, similarly to how he had done so on the bridge.
“John turn around and look at me.” Definitely an order this time. Sherlock almost sounded angry at John’s refusal. The implications of the situation had finally caught up to Sherlock and his outrage at what John had tried to do triggered an emotional whirlwind within the detective that manifested as his anger.
Sherlock could feel his collar growing damp with each laboured breath of Johns open mouth against his throat. He tried to turn to the side, feeling the compulsive need to check on his friend. Just then John’s steps faltered, his legs stopped cooperating entirely and the two of them pitched forward. Sherlock barely caught them before they fell to the ground, he planted one foot in front of them, swivelling on it to catch John into his chest as he fell. The position was awkward and John’s head knocked painfully against Sherlock’s jaw as he caught him, sending a hot spike of pain through his skull. It seemed that John was well and truly unconscious at this point. John began to slide down Sherlock’s chest and he tried to wrap his arms around his middle, desperately clinging to his own forearms where they were circled just under John’s arms.
“John stop.” Sherlock barked out, pushing further forward against John’s chest. This seemed to stop John who gasped as the pressure on his chest increased, making a pained noise and dropping his arms limply to his sides.
Mrs. Hudson, Mycroft, Lestrade, they had all moved on, properly. They coped with losing Sherlock. They understood how to continue with their lives. John just couldn’t. He wondered if they would be able to do it again. Wondered how long it would take them to move on from John. Although he wasn’t sure entirely when it was, John knew that there was a point where he had stopped bothering to scold himself for thinking like this. There was a point when this became all he thought about. Sometimes he told himself that he would be missed. That it would be a mistake. Sometimes he even believed it.
London’s sky was grey and miserable through the window of 221b Baker Street where John Watson sat slumped in his armchair staring through the glass panes. The heating in the apartment was off and the chill of winter had seeped into the lifeless building. In the silence John could hear Mrs. Hudson bustling about downstairs, ever so often coming to the foot of the stairs and hesitating before turning back around. That had become almost a routine by now. She always came to check up on John in the mornings and evenings. That was routine. In the first few days she would come up more often, sometimes even spending the whole day with John. As the days progressed and John became no more responsive she began to distance herself more, leaving him to his own thoughts and allowing him to brood in solitude. John felt grateful and guilty, after all she had lost him too. John was never fully sure of the relationship between Mrs. Hudson and Sherlock but they had been close and he could tell that she grieved too.
“I love you Sherlock,” he whispered, putting one foot forward as if he were walking, “and I’m sorry.”
“It doesn’t matter right now. I’ll tell you about it later,” Sherlock reassured as John made a displeased look, a frown pulling his wearied features downward. Finally, Sherlock allowed himself to fully absorb every detail of his closest companion.
Walking was a slow process. John’s steps were stuttering and unsteady, his feet mainly dragging along the floor. The living room was cluttered and the kitchen was in an even worse state of disarray. The first room in the hallway was to Sherlock’s bedroom, for a moment Sherlock considered marching the full length of the hall to John’s, but their lethargic pace drove the idea from his head.
This took a while but my exams are almost done so I thought now was a good time to write. Bit of a longer chapter as an apology for the wait.
“Pull yourself together Watson, you’re a soldier. He wouldn’t want this for you.” John muttered to his reflection.
Without even loosening his grip on John, he pushed himself up onto his knees, awkwardly shuffling over to John until he was settled in front of him. He waited a moment, staring expectantly at John’s bowed head but no explanation was offered. As his patience wore thin, Sherlock began to extend his hand towards the hem of John’s jumper. John’s fist shot out like a striking cobra, catching Sherlock around the wrist in a vice-like grip. Other than that, John remained in the same position. Sherlock stared at his still bowed head and tried the wrest his hand from John’s grasp. It could not be done. John’s fingers clamped harder around Sherlock’s wrist when he began to move, making his whole hand fully immobile.
A tremble ran through John. As John was pressed flush against Sherlock he could feel it. Every point of contact between them felt the shiver as if both had experienced it simultaneously. One of Sherlock’s arms that was locked around John’s middle reached across his chest and grabbed his shoulder, forcing John further back into Sherlock’s embrace.
Sherlock could feel as John’s whole body shook. His breathing quickened and although Sherlock could not see his face, through the sound of his stuttering breaths he knew John was crying. The man went tense, every single muscle in his body was strained and coiled as if he were preparing to run or fight. With the amount of muscle mass he had lost Sherlock reckoned that he would be able to win. The arm pressed against John’s chest moved outward as John’s lungs expanded, taking a deep breath and holding the air there as if he thought it would help him float away.
Sherlock stood stunned as John swiftly hoisted himself up to stand on the wall of the bridge.
When the cold London air hit his face, he felt sobered almost instantly. The hysteria from the remnants of the memory began to fade into nothing, taking all else with it. Suddenly and instantly he felt drained and numb. His legs began to carry him, leaving his mind behind to catch up. Although only half-present he knew where he was going. He understood what he needed to do. So, he let his body drive while he retreated into his mind. Going through his life frame by frame.
Today. Today he would look for a job. Not wanting to be able to convince himself otherwise, he grabbed his coat and headed out immediately.
“John.” Sherlock croaked with equal pain.
Sherlock hadn’t noticed the silent tears that were dribbling from his eyes and falling into John’s messy hair. Belatedly he also registered John’s pitiful whimpering sobs.
John didn’t know what time it was. It must be some time in the early morning. His eyes were dry and aching from being open so long. He had been lost in his own thoughts again. The idea of getting up didn’t seem very appealing to him but his body felt heavy and disgusting in the way it sometimes does after an unsatisfactory night of sleep. Slowly, he dragged himself out of Sherlock’s bed, straightening the sheets to the exact same position they were in before he had started sleeping there before trudging to his room for some clothes and his towel.
Shutting the door behind him, John followed after Mycroft through the impeccably clean and organised hallways. They ended up in a reasonably sized living room with a large flat-screen on one side of the room directly facing a long, black leather sofa and two armchairs on either side with a small coffee table sat in the middle of the semi-circle of furniture. John hesitated rather awkwardly on the edge of the room while Mycroft just plopped rather tiredly down onto the sofa. Noticing John’s hesitation Mycroft made a feeble attempt at a smile, that held none of its usual pretentiousness, and said, “please, have a seat.”
Straightening, Sherlock looked down at John’s mobile form. He looked painfully stiff. More like a corpse than a living man. His gaunt features and sickly-white skin in his sprawled position on the floor mimicked the scene of a man who had supposedly had a heart attack that the two of them investigated years ago. Sherlock shifted his thoughtful gaze of Johns face. Blood was still seeping through his jumper which had ridden up very slightly. With one more glance at his face, Sherlock steeped over John’s outstretched arm and crouched by his side.
, a snide voice in the back of John’s head remarked,
In process of next chapter which holds the long awaited reunion.
Both men stood in the doorway, almost reluctant to part. John hugged Mycroft again, short but packed with meaning before he clambered back into the car that drove him there. As the car drove John through the winding streets of London and back to Baker Street, John felt a mix of light-heartedness that was being dragged down heavy sadness.
As he made his way further into the room John felt less uneasy and more concerned. Usually John felt no great deal of love for the other Holmes sibling but he did respect him and he had, on more than one occasion, noted his genuine concern and care for his baby brother. Mycroft usually always exuded an air of confidence and untouchability, seemingly always turning his nose up at everything. However, right now, sitting on his expensive sofa that seemed to dwarf his size in ordinary people’s clothes he looked so…small and vulnerable. It made John’s heart break just a little and made him regret all those times that he had only ever thought of Mycroft as an emotionless businessman. Being able to have a closer look at him, John could now see the greyish tinge his skin had taken on as well as the bags under his red-rimmed eyes. His voice was hoarse when he spoke instead of posh and clear like it usually was. That’s when it hit John, truly hit him. As much as he had offered his condolences and realised the fact before he had never actually understood. This man, no matter how he usually acted, had just lost a brother. A younger brother. His family. John couldn’t even comprehend how he would feel if he lost Harry. Especially if he had it in his head that Harry was someone that was his responsibility to protect. Sadness curled in the bottom of John’s gut for the man in front of him and he sat near him on the sofa instead of on one of the armchairs.
“Because you’re not there. You can’t be there and if I turn around,” he paused. A quick stuttering inhale signalled that he had began to cry again. When he continued his voice was choked and thick with emotion. “And if I turn around you won’t be there.”
Soon, he said to himself, soon I will go back to him.
It had been a few more days and Sherlock had finally decided to return to his beloved friend. During the day John had seemed occupied, his thoughts even further than they usually were. Sherlock dared not bother him while he was working and so had waited. Once John had left work Sherlock stuck close behind him, determined to catch up and proclaim his presence. Once more hesitancy struck him, and he let the opportunity slip past him as John entered 221b and Sherlock continued down the road.
The sobs stopped immediately.
Everyone around him seemed relieved at his return to reality. They felt like they needed to check up on him less and so John was still allowed his own time of isolation when he got tired of the world for the day. John seemed better, he really did, but he really wasn’t. Most of the time John felt this harsh overwhelming guilt. Guilt for not noticing what Sherlock was going to do. Guilt for not stopping Sherlock. Guilt for not telling Sherlock everything he had ought to when he had the chance. Guilt for daring to move on without Sherlock. Some days John felt ‘normal’ but John didn’t really understand what normal was. He couldn’t remember the last time he referred to anything in his life as normal. Ever since he met Sherlock everything had become so far from normal and that was ‘normal’ to John. But now, without Sherlock to constantly drag John into horrifyingly mysterious situations John was just meant to be an ordinary person again. And he had forgotten how. Sometimes, more than sometimes, John wondered why he bothered. Why he tried to force himself into a mould that he doesn’t even know the shape of. Why he pretended that he could ever move on when Sherlock became such a part of his life, such a part of him, that he lost a part of himself with Sherlock. Why he bothered to live when he didn’t want to anymore.
“He’s peculiar like that, my brother. He acts so closed off to everyone. Never letting anyone get too close. But at the same time, without you even noticing, he gets close. So close that he crawls under your skin and you feel at loss when he's gone.” Mycroft’s expression was reminiscent as he said it, dreamy almost. John understood what he meant though. Living with Sherlock had definitely not been easy but by living with him he had developed a bond with the man that he couldn't quite explain. With Sherlock gone now John felt an incomprehensible loss. As if a part of him were missing. A part that he had given to Sherlock and a part that he had taken when he left.
“John,” Sherlock ground out through gritted teeth, “why is there blood on your shirt?”
John stood silently in the centre of the room. His head and shoulders were bowed and shaking, and he looked on the verge of collapse. Cautiously, Sherlock approached John. His hands were half extended as he tip-toed forward, as if he were approaching a skittish animal.
“John,” he repeated more softly. He stared imploringly into John’s eyes. “Talk to me.”
“I love you.”
“John,” he said with more conviction. “Look at me.” It was more of an order this time.
I actually went back to watch the scene as I wrote this. Definitely a triggering chapter so please be careful when reading if self harm is a trigger for you.
He remembered the day he met Sherlock. The amazement and awe he had felt after seeing his mind at work for the first time. The excitement and bravery he felt as he and Sherlock had run together, and he realised his limp was gone. His fierce protective pride when he had saved Sherlock.
“No!” John cried as Sherlock managed to hook an arm around his waist. For a fraction of a second Sherlock thought he had irritated the cuts and so flinched his arm back slightly. It was all that John needed to easily worm his way out of Sherlock’s grip, making a beeline for the door. Just as she reached it Sherlock came up behind him, slinging one arm across John’s chest and grabbing his arm, he spun him around and pinned him against the door. Before John could even gather his thoughts, Sherlock took a step closer and pressed each elbow to the door on either side of John’s head. He allowed no space for John to escape, his body pressed fully into the shorter man’s front, his face so close he could feel John’s trembling breath on his chin.
We're getting there. I promise.
Pinpricks of light broke up the black ocean of the night sky, Sherlock stood in his black trench coat across from 221b Baker Street. He wasn’t sure what time it was, but he had taken reassurance in previous nights in just standing and watching, as if he were the protector of the flat. Sudden movement shook Sherlock from the daze he had been in as he watched John leave the flat and stride off into the streets of London with more determination in his step than Sherlock had seen since he had returned. Waiting a few seconds, Sherlock took after him at a leisurely pace, his long strides keeping just far enough away to be inconspicuous.
It was only 5:30 am by the time John was dressed and sat back in his usual armchair. He knew that he should find a job and soon. Even though John didn’t really spend money on food or clothes or anything really, without Sherlock his funds were drying up and he was only just able to pay rent at the moment. A part of his mind was quick to remind him that even if he did run out of money the rent probably wouldn’t be a problem thanks to some of Mycroft’s very discreet payments. John briefly wondered if those payments were already being made.
Sherlock wanted to refute what he was saying. Obviously, he didn’t think that. The only reason he hadn’t told John was because it was safer, for the both of them. And, he supposed, it was easier. Did John really believe that? That he didn’t matter? That Sherlock didn’t need him?
He remembered a number of their cases. Of Sherlock’s grotesque and disturbing science experiments where John would open the fridge to be greeted by an arm or leg. He also remembered the quiet domestic moments with Sherlock. Of his slender, long fingers skimming the strings of his violin as he played, almost as if he were petting it. Of how intently he would feel Sherlock staring at him sometimes when he though John wasn’t looking, or when he knew he was. Of how intensely John would stare at him when he thought Sherlock wasn’t looking.
John was momentarily surprised to see that Mycroft wasn’t dressed in his usual selection of crisp, clean suits was instead standing there in a plain white Henley and light brow khaki trousers. Although he still gave off an air of professionalism from his not-entirely-casual clothes John was still surprised at how unguarded he seemed. At first John didn’t know exactly what to say. Despite the fact that they had formed an unspoken connection through their shared care for Sherlock they had never been particularly close. John found something strangely comforting about the older Holmes’ presence and realised that he didn’t want to end their contact because they no longer had a common interest.
“Why is there blood on your shirt?”
“I’m so, so sorry.”
His face was gaunt and haggard. Bags and dark rings hung from under his eyes and his skin was gaunt and pale. His dirty blonde hair was exactly that as it lay limply, plastered to his clearly defined skull. John’s usual collection of baggy clothes hid the shape of his body but the way they seemed dented inward showed that he had lost weight. Not sleeping, not eating, staying inside all day. Textbook signs of depression. John scoffed.
It had been days since he had returned. Sherlock had waited so long to see John again, but he felt hesitant about revealing his presence. John had seemed so content when Sherlock had arrived; he had a new job at a small surgery and was seemingly living a contented and mundane life. The fleeting idea that John was better off without him was quickly dismissed. Whether it was because Sherlock was simply too selfish to let John go or he was certain that they were better as a duo, Sherlock wasn’t sure. For some reason Sherlock was just content to sit and watch his partner from a distance for a while longer. There was something odd niggling at the back of Sherlock’s mind, it was something similar to the way he felt when confronting a suspect, just a sense that something was off about them.
With a renewed passion John tried again to walk forward. Sherlock tightened his grasp as John struggled against him, unconsciously making shushing noises as if John were a frightened animal. As a surge of strength went through John in another effort to pull away which led to him almost tipping over the edge, Sherlock acted. With all the strength he could muster, Sherlock pulled himself back, causing John to drop back off the ledge. Still entrapped in Sherlock’s arms, John was in an odd suspended position. He wasn’t standing, more being supported by Sherlock.
Really sorry for the long break. Also sorry that this is mainly a filler chapter. The next one will be good though I promise.
John stood fully under the spray of the shower, not caring that the water was turned up hot enough to burn, turning his shoulders and back red with the heat. He tried to avoid looking down at himself. John was quite a modest man but he had always been quite well built with clearly defined muscles from his days in the army. However, in recent times he hasn’t managed to keep to his usual routine of eating and exercise and he often found himself disgusted by his shrunken body and gaunt features. At some point John had actually gone around the flat and covered all the mirrors. If Ms. Hudson had noticed she had chosen not to comment. When John had finally gathered the will to move, he shut off the water, only hesitating a second longer, before clambering out of the tub and wrapping a towel loosely around his waist.
“I suppose I just don’t know what to do now,” his voice cracked slightly on the last words and without thinking, John launched forward and drew the man into a hug. It was awkward at first, both, stiff-backed but John’s arms were firm and gripping him tightly. The hug exceeded the acceptable amount of time but John still clung on even at Mycroft’s half-hearted attempt to move back. After a few more seconds passed by John felt Mycroft relax completely, crumpling into John. His face tucked into the crook of John’s neck and John could feel the tell-tale wetness of tears pressing into his skin. Moving one of his arms so that he could rub one calloused hand up and down the others back, he folded Mycroft more comfortably into him as all the pent-up tears tore from him.
“Sherlock. Sherlock. Sherlock.” Each whined syllable injured Sherlock, his grip tightening further as the shorter man sagged against him. He sounded broken.
With a shaking hand, he gripped the naked razor blade, nicking his thumb in the process, not that he noticed. He started fresh, finding one unmarred piece of flesh just above his waistline and drawing the thin edge of the blade across his skin with sudden steady precision. For a moment he just watched as a smooth red line appeared, and blood beaded up on its surface before growing and sliding down to stain his sweatpants. But the pressure within his head didn’t subside. It didn’t even lessen. So again, he pulled the blade across. Then again. Then, finding on older, faded cut he traced it and reopened it, wider than he had intended to but it didn’t matter.
“Stop saying that!” John yelled. “Can you say anything other than that?”
“I love you Sherlock. And I’m sorry.”
The slightest hint of a smile nudged at John’s lips over the absurdity of anyone using a semi-colon in a text. It was barely a minute before the usual black car pulled up outside and John was driven in silence to a surprisingly modest looking house. By modest he means by Mycroft standards of course. The house stood alone on its own piece of land, unlike the rows of semi-detached or terraced houses that lined the usual streets of London. It was reasonably big and painted a rich creamy colour with black beams making a simplistic but pleasing pattern. It was surrounded by lush, neatly trimmed grass and systematically placed flowers. As the car drew up through the open black iron gate and up the paved driveway to a large empty space near the front of the house. When the car pulled to a stop John didn’t hesitate in stepping out, not bothering to turn when the car immediately drove off. John walked up to the impressive looking oak door, banging the iron ring knocker. The door opens after a minute and John was surprised to see Mycroft standing there instead of an elderly austere-looking butler.
His only escape. The one thing that had been getting him by. What he had been using to release his anger and sadness and frustration. His grief and despair and numbness. And it wasn’t working. Tears welled behind his eyes, blurring his vision and falling in fat, warm droplets onto his unsteady arms braced against the sink. He couldn’t breathe. He needed to breathe. He didn’t want to breathe. He didn’t want to breathe.
Sherlock opened his mouth to respond, John’s name about to slip from his lips but he was beaten to it. “Fine,” John said sharply, letting go of Sherlock’s hand so quickly that he almost threw it back towards him. “Leave.”
Sherlock thought to himself as he briefly surveyed the familiar apartment.
“John.” John jolted into a standing position.
They remained like that for a minute or two more, until Mycroft was all cried out and his slender frame shook with the effects of weariness and grief. All the while John just calmly stroked his spine, shushing and cooing the fully-grown man as one would an upset child. John didn’t even notice some tears of his own had slipped down his cheeks. When Mycroft pushed back more firmly, John let him go. They both wiped the tears from their faces, John watching the other man intently as he studiously avoided eye-contact.
He was met by silence. John’s eyes widened for a fleeting second before half-shutting, his mouth settling into a thin hard line. Sherlock pulled away from John, gripping his shoulders harshly as he held him at arms-length to stare into his eyes.
At some point during the night, well it was now a lot closer to morning than night, Mycroft suggested that John just stay there and return to Baker Street in the morning to save himself the trouble. Although John pondered it he eventually insisted he return. John would have liked to stay, he actually wanted to since after today he felt much closer to the once imposing and detached man, however he didn't think he was quite ready to break his habit of sleeping in Sherlock’s bed just yet. Although after endless nights, and sometimes days, of John laying there the smell of Sherlock had dwindled, the overall organised messiness of the room was overtly Sherlock and it set John at ease.
John was so lost in his thought, trying desperately to remember where that must be from that he didn’t realised he had been wondering for hours. He had made it so far that he was actually stood on Blackfriars Bridge. The cold air nipped at his exposed face as he leaned on the edge of the, surprisingly empty, iconic bridge.
Even though John’s hair had always been an almost dusty blonde, it held more grey than blonde and was longer and scruffier than his usual short style. Sherlock felt as if he rather preferred John’s hair a little longer, the thought of being able to run his fingers through the long strands appealed to Sherlock. His face seemed unnaturally pale. Usually John maintained a healthy tan, how he did so in London was a mystery within itself, but now his skin was almost translucent in how pale it was. His veins were clearly seen as a map of blue and green rivers running under his skin. Bags hung under his wearied eyes, they were so deep into his skin they looked like they had been carved into him. His eyes almost looked bruised by the dark circles that coloured his face.
So lost in thought, Sherlock almost jumped in surprise when they arrived at the door.
Sherlock stiffened his body as John leaned harder against him, slumping forward onto Sherlock. A sheen of sweat had beaded around John’s face and neck and his breathing was loud and almost laboured where his agape mouth was pressed against Sherlock’s shoulder. Moving his hands to clutch John’s waist, Sherlock stumbled them both back away from the door, allowing John to lean into him. Slowly, Sherlock manoeuvred John to face to the side, his arm snaking around the bottom of his rib cage, John’s weight still resting entirely on Sherlock.
“I can’t,” John’s voice cracked on the second word and the sound of it immediately shut off Sherlock’s anger. Taking a deep breath, Sherlock moved his head closer to John’s once more. His mouth settled just behind John’s ear, not touching him but close enough for him to feel the warmth of his breath. Another shiver went through him.
John had gotten a job eventually at a small surgery not too far from the apartment, Mrs. Hudson was pleased and had given him a tight hug and made him a cup of tea. He had begun to talk to her more, but he still remained rather inside of himself most of the time. She had seemed to accept it. Almost every day he would just leave to go to the surgery in the morning and come straight back to the apartment after his shift had ended. He spoke with Mycroft often, almost daily at this point. Occasionally they would meet, mainly just John going to Mycroft’s house and staying a while before returning to the apartment. They had become closer, but John still refused to stay overnight. Eventually Mycroft had started wearing his sharp, crisp suits and John had returned to the habit of showering and changing clothes daily.
Just for the sake of choice he pocketed them and stepped out before he could think any more about it. As quietly as he could he descended the stairs, aware of Mrs. Hudson sleeping in her room.
“No.”
“Sherlock?” he murmured, slow to react to Sherlock’s sudden change in demeanour. Sherlock stared at John, his eyes flickering between the red lines and John’s face.
“Keys John,” Sherlock asked the slumped figure at his side. There was no response. Sherlock half expected to hear snoring. “Keys,” he repeated slightly louder. When he was met with the same silence he decided to scavenge for them himself. He patted his hands down John’s sides, the only acknowledgement of the action was a small flinch from John. Retrieving the keys from John’s trouser pocket, Sherlock eased the door open and as quietly as possible urged his unresponsive former flatmate upstairs. Sherlock had no particular wish to confront Mrs. Hudson just yet.
“Sherlock?” The single word released the floodgates for both men. Simultaneously they broke out into loud, wailing sobs, clutching each other as tightly as they could. A fruitless attempt from Sherlock to manoeuvre them to the sofa ended with them both sat on the floor. John was practically in Sherlock’s lap as he was leaned so far into Sherlock. The crooked sitting position that Sherlock had adopted was uncomfortable and his back was strained from bending to clutch at the back of John’s jumper, but he couldn’t find it within himself to care. Instead he simply dug his fingers deeper into the scratchy material and pull it closer toward himself. Again, Sherlock began to make reassuring shushing noises between his own tearful cries in response to the whimpering from over his shoulder.
“A slut.” John pushes his free hand into Sherlock's hair and yanks. “Your slut.” Sherlock gasps.
“Yes. I need it. I need you to fuck me. Hard.” Sherlock blurts out, trying to sound seductive despite the pain. “You feel so good inside my mancunt. Please, take me. Deeper.”
----------
Sherlock is a sweaty, panting, leaking mess when John returns about an hour after leaving him, fully dressed now with a chequered shirt and one of his hideously misleading oatmeal jumpers. Sherlock's cock is by now rock hard, purple and swollen, the foreskin fully retreated.
“If you stop counting we'll start all over again, Sherlock.”
“I… I don’t… It’s just…” Sherlock stammers. He doesn’t want to have this conversation right now. He doesn’t want to have any conversation. He wants to rest, oblivious to all these confusing power struggles. Tears of frustration well up in his eyes.
“I'm not... god, this is difficult.” He sounds so annoyed that John can't suppress a soft smile.
Sherlock can see John's eyes go dark.
“You should be used to that.” Mycroft murmurs, returning to his file.
“Can you kneel up?”
“Of course.” Mummy exclaims, but it’s John who steers him up the stairs.
Sorry, a day late but I had lots on my plate last week...
Sherlock hums in agreement.
“I... I don't...” he stammers, confused and perplexed. Her gloved left hand slaps him, hard, and to his embarrassment his cock twitches. He gets even more hard when Irene pushes all five fingers sheathed into his mouth, making him choke and grunt in desperation. The taste of latex is almost intoxicating and Sherlock wants to suck, nibble, succumb to being forcefully entered like this. He wants to do whatever Miss Adler has in mind for him.
John hugs Sherlock from behind, kissing his neck, before resting his chin on Sherlock's bony shoulder to watch the two women in front of them. Sally has by now dropped the riding crop and is instead holding tight to Kate's hair, almost breaking the woman's nose as she humps the maid's face, glistening with cunt juice and saliva. They both moan and pant until Sally goes rigid, her usually stern features for a moment softening in pure bliss.
Slowly, Sherlock lowers his arms and glares up at the face looming above him. “Molly...”, he coughs, but Moriarty just shakes his head, smiling a dark smile.
“Now, that's convenient. I'll drench you in my piss until you choke on it. It feels there might be plenty. So we better go downstairs and get you into the tub.”
“My wife burned most of it after Will's last relapse. Said she just had one son now. Couldn’t bear being reminded of how happy Will had been as a child.” Sherlock’s father has to bend his head when standing in the low room. “Not as it all went down. He spun out of control.”
A hand reaches down, spreading the slimy substance on his body, and Sherlock arches into the touch before reaching out and pulling the boy in.
Sherlock nods. “Yes, John.” His voice is raw from screaming into the gag earlier.
Sherlock is left utterly open and vulnerable. He's suddenly very glad that he cleaned himself thoroughly this morning and is only fed liquid, especially when John starts to talk about nappies during their bondage session in the attic. Sherlock is sure that he wouldn't survive the shame.
Sherlock is lying naked on the desk, on his back, his head hanging off the other side of the table, like they did it back at Baker Street.
When Sherlock's breathing has evened out, John attaches the weights to his nipples again, and leads Sherlock up the stairs to his room on all four, pulling on the leash.
Another fierce nod, accompanied by a low moan. Sherlock blushes, a pink flush spreading all the way down his torso.
“Speaking of...” Greg says, his voice hard and unforgiving, “now that the linen are soaked anyway, piss yourself like the dirty slut you are.” As encouragement, John gives Sherlock another hard kick, and this time, he falls onto his side; a long streak of piss squirts out of his arse. Sherlock spreads his legs so that John and Greg get a good look and - quite naturally by now, due to John's training –  urine starts to flow from his soft cock until he's lying in a pool of piss that slowly soaks the sheets. The sensation of piss streaming out front and behind, mingled with the humiliation of being forced to do this in front of other people, makes Sherlock's head spin in a mixture of mortification and arousal.
The pain is like nothing Sherlock has ever felt. It's not just the burn and stretch, it's the unfamiliar intrusion that frightens Sherlock as well. His body screams at him that this is not right and fights this object inserted into him, into a place where it's not meant to be. John works it in regardless.
“Poor thing.” John says, a wicked glint in his eyes. He squeezes. Sherlock yelps in shock. John closes his hand only tighter until Sherlock is trembling all over, fisting his hands into the sheets. He's panting hard through his nose in a futile attempt not to scream as tears well up behind is closed eyelids.
Until they bring the dog over.
Sherlock almost screams when John finally pushes in. His own cock is still almost entirely trapped inside those tight panties, neglected, yet hard and leaking. John even stuffs his glans back inside the knickers before grabbing Sherlock's hips again to brutally fuck him.
He keeps the camera running.
“Lock, Sherlock, this is how it's done.”
“Just give yourself a break. One hour. That's all I'm asking for. Then you can get back to the case. You can even take your phone with you. Ok?” John asks in an unusually soft voice.
“Stop it.” John orders, and Sherlock's hand stills, falling to his side. John gets up and stands over him, resuming Sherlock's work with his own hand. He adds a lascivious twist to every second stroke, and it only takes a few moments before he can feel his balls tighten.
John cleans Sherlock up as good as possible, covering the cuts on his back with another towel to soak up the blood, then takes a hurried shower and dresses. Sherlock has told him that there is a pharmacy just round the corner where he'll get everything he needs.
“Moriarty's old key card has been used at Bart's about an hour ago...”
As he observes the effect the bag has on Sherlock over the next few days, John grows increasingly weary.
As Acri presents it to them with a sly smile, Sherlock can see that it is almost full.
Sherlock's eyes are by now screwed shut and his mouth hangs open. He's drooling. God, the tawse hurts. Especially as John is now flogging his whole body mercilessly, right up to his shoulder blades. Even when he has to pause for a moment, the leather tongues caress Sherlock's sore skin with . As the piss cools on his legs and he stands in a lukewarm puddle, Sherlock can feel himself sliding deeper and deeper into subspace, embracing the pain, the humiliation, trying to become one with it, accepting it, welcoming it. He's debasing himself but he doesn't care anymore.
First of all, John makes Sherlock crawl into the bathroom, were he is subjected to a cold shower until his teeth chatter and his lips turn blue. Sherlock has to kneel in the bath tub while the icy water cascades over his used body, making his nipples peak and his balls draw tight. Only when piss, lube and sperm has been thoroughly washed away does John haul Sherlock out of the tub by his dripping wet hair, dragging the naked, shivering mess Sherlock's been reduced to into the kitchen.
Sherlock wants to give an acrid retort, but only now senses that he can't open his mouth. It's sealed with something – adhesive tape? A bandage? Leucoplast? Whatever it is, it ensures that just a muffled sound escapes his throat.
It hurts.
He knew that it was kind of abhorrent. And still... just the mental images of Sherlock, clad in his pyjama pants, his crotch darkening; or Sherlock, standing in one of his bespoke suits in the kitchen, his tight trousers dripping with piss; or Sherlock, naked, kneeling on the bathroom floor in a pool of urine... suddenly, this had seemed incredibly enticing to John.
Dimmock points towards the bedroom, and so it falls to John to explain with an excusing smile: “He got into a fight while on a chase last night. I had to splint his finger and patch him up at three in the morning because, of course, his Nibs wouldn't go to A&E like any mere mortal.”
Reluctantly, Sherlock raises his head as the boy bends a little forward.
“No.” Sherlock answers. It’s not clear if in protest or in agreement.
“Oh.” Sherlock's mouth forms a perfect circle upon seeing John just in his pyjama bottoms, sipping black coffee. John looks up then and as his gaze trails over Sherlock's lean damp body his eyes darken to an almost violet blue. He stares at Sherlock over the rim of his mug, unblinking, and Sherlock feels pinned to the spot.
Only in the evening does John lead a still weak Sherlock into the bathroom and removes the catheter. Afterwards, John holds Sherlock's flaccid cock as he empties his bladder into the toilet bowl, all the while softly kissing his shoulders and nuzzling into his nape.
“We don't want anyone disturbing us, Sherlock, won't we?”
Until it suddenly flies open again, taking both men by surprise.
Sorry, no porn, just plot, drama and feels. But this is needed at this point of the story, so please kindly bear with me.
“I'll send the maid with hot water and towels.” Irene offers before silently gliding out of the room. At the door, however, she turns around. “He's something special, Doctor Watson. Look after him.”
John, sensing that something just happened with Sherlock, quickly pulls him into a tight hug as soon as they are alone, petting his back.
He visibly loves the taste. It's depraved to crave being treated like this, but Sherlock doesn't care. He savours every bite offered as if it's the most sophisticated meal ever served.
Sherlock is so hard it looks outright painful, his purplish cock poking upwards from his concave abdomen, blotchy with arousal. His pubic hair is growing back, and the base of his cock is surrounded by a halo of short black fur, a nice contrast to the blond hair on his head. His foreskin is fully retracted, allowing the precome to drip freely down his shaft.
“Yes, I told you merely half an hour ago.” John answers somewhat perplexed.
“And?”
Yet all too soon that skilled wet mouth is removed; Sherlock is panting, whining, begging. “John, please, John, god, please... please!”
Sherlock just nods.
“Oh... uhm,” he stutters before his brain comes back online. “How about I give you the victory sign then, with my fingers?”
“How long... how long do you think Miss Adler will leave me like this?” Kate asks with a weak voice, but her nipples are hard, her breathing is ragged and her pupils have dilated.
“No, but nonetheless you did it. Why?”
He's told to open his mouth so they can take turns spitting into it. Sherlock has to swallow it all.
“Shh, don't fight it, pretty boy.” The man behind Sherlock mumbles. Zips are being opened, and suddenly the musky smell of male arousal fills the small room, making Sherlock's mouth water.
“But I want it.”
“Thought he better not get used to it too much. I don't want to spoil him.” John retorts.
Sherlock wants to protest. No! No cage. Not with Mycroft being the master of the keys. It might be ages before he'll be released from it.
Sherlock slowly returns to the living room and sinks to his knees in front of John's chair, bowing his head. “I can't.” He breathes as he rests his cheek against John's thigh.
Suddenly, he can feel his stomach being flooded with liquid. John must have opened the clasp on the urine bag. It's true, Sherlock can't taste it, but the knowledge of his stomach slowly being filled with piss is impossibly arousing. It's still lukewarm. And he can't do anything about it. There is no resistance. They've made him into an orifice. He has no choice but to take it.
“Not now, John.” He makes a vague gesture with his delicate right hand as if to dismiss John like he's an annoying insect. Only, that's not on.
“Have you ever seen anything like this, Ormond? Such a greedy whore, getting his ass ripped apart and ruined and loving it?” Acri asks now, his eyes never leaving the arrangement of human bodies he's choreographed.
A totally harmless, unsuspicious meeting – two ex-pats bonding over being strangers in a foreign country. When they leave the bar, no one spares the bearded Englishman and the young blond Norwegian a second thought.
The next five blows hit Sherlock in a quick succession. His voice has become hoarse as he utters higher and higher numbers. Yet he stays in place, sacrificing his body for John's pleasure. They are joined by pain, one inflicting it, the other one receiving it.
Suddenly, a single finger if breaching him, pushing inside his hole. Mycroft immediately starts to rub his prostate without mercy, which in return also stimulates Sherlock’s bladder, encouraging it to empty itself faster. The feeling is like nothing Sherlock has ever experienced. He whines in despair, but Mycroft doesn’t stop. Contrary, he even speeds up, pressing down harder. Sherlock can feel his orgasm building, a sharp tingling down his spine. His balls tighten, his abdominal muscles clench, and when it hits him, his whole body spasms as he’s making helpless noises behind the rubber mask. His hips buck involuntarily while he shakes like a leave in John’s tight grip.
John is standing in front of him, still lazily rubbing his erection. Sherlock stares fascinated at John's hands as he slowly starts to unbutton his jeans. When John's hard cock springs free it's even bigger than Sherlock would have thought. Despite his pain and humiliation Sherlock feels an odd sense of pride in being the one responsible for this.
“Well, there is more, you know.” Acri glances over to the boy still leaning against the chest of drawers. Now, at a wink, he comes over to the bench and sits in his Dom's lap, facing Sherlock.
“Yes, little brother, I'm stroking myself over a picture of your violated arse. Good, it looks rather lovely, all red and stuffed to the rim.” Mycroft's voice wavers slightly at the end of the sentence. “Now, pull it out, Greg, I want to hear him moan.”
“Ah, come on, you can do better. Show me with your fingers.”
“Thirteen!” Sherlock screams, the muscles in his back flexing beneath his skin every time he hears the whistling of the crop in the air and feels its draught just before the impact. John loves how he falls apart in front of him, allows him to see how vulnerable, how human he is.
John loosens his grip to Sherlock's hair, then looks thoughtfully down at the man at his feet while taking another sip of coffee.
After a moment’s silence, the woman stands up, removes the grey scarf from her neck, pulls the flowery dress over her head, quickly unhooks her padded bra and sinks onto her knees.
John lifts his chin and forces Sherlock to look up at him. “That's right. You just drowned a whole pint of your own piss. Did you like that?”
Out on the corridor, John leans in and whispers: “Now, how desperate are you to find out what Sergeant Donovan can do with that riding crop?”
