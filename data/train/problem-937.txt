Mycroft smiled at the suggestion and agreed readily. He held out his hand, grateful when Greg took it. They left the room together, both of them already half hard from anticipation.
Sherlock couldn’t help himself, he burst out laughing. “You give the pearl to ladies. The shell is pointless.”
A short time later, long enough for Sherlock to have had too much and not enough stimulus from the mounted dildo, John pulled his chair up beside the younger man's and began feeding him from his plate. He was surprised when Sherlock took the bite, chewed and swallowed without any resistance.
The detective sighed and glanced up, slowing down to just one step at a time. Both Doms were on the landing outside of the room where the dead woman was. “But they take the poison themselves; they chew, swallow the pills themselves. There are clear signs even you lot couldn’t miss them.”
"Son," Siger said, "I suggest you go ahead and phone your brother with the news. You don't want him learning of it through other means."
"Alright!" If throwing out the toes kept John from questioning where he had been, it was a small price to pay.
The Dominatrix regained her composure. "Tie them both over the benches. I won't have either of them causing more trouble."
“What is it?” John asked. “What are you hiding?” He heard his own sub sniggering behind him. Clearly having already deduced what was going on.
A broken whimper came out around the gag and John muttered, "Aww, Lockie's nipples are hurting." It amazed the Dom how still Sherlock had gone. He teased his boy's nipples even more, twisting them and biting them until they were red and puffy from the abuse, then he applied a pair of clover clamps that bit down sharply. He began pulling and twisting them, revelling in the small whimpers Sherlock was letting out.
“Go and fetch our jackets,” John patted Sherlock on the arse as he carried the plates through to the kitchen to find a cloth.
Sherlock was glaring daggers up at his Dom from where he was in a bundle, but before he could spring up and lash out, John grabbed him by the scruff of the neck. He shoved him down over the bench and chained his collar to the eyebolt. Sherlock had gone back to underestimating him as a Dom, and it was something that would damn well change soon or he’d suffer for it. It was that simple.
Instead, drinks had been laid out by the staff, coffee for the Dom and a glass of water for Sherlock.
The Dom ran his fingers through Sherlock's curls. "You're welcome." He smiled to himself at his pet's gratitude, but he refused to get too hopeful.
Mycroft released him slowly, ready to grab his brother at the least provocation, but John took Sherlock firmly by the arm and started dusting the sand off of him.
After a few minutes of waiting for things to reconvene, Finn was bored, he was shifting around and fidgeting just like Sherlock did. In the end it was Greg who pulled him onto his lap as Mycroft appeared.
He wandered over to his bed, hanging his jacket over the chair as he went and kicked off his shoes. He settled in to the middle and made himself comfy, he didn’t know how long he would have to wait for something to happen, if anything.
“It is not down to you to control your little brother any more, Mycroft. I have contracted with him, it's down to me. I have 7 weeks left, he'll learn.”
"I know you can get out the front door. I know you have probably thought of a million new ways to test the security system. I know you are a hell of a lot faster than me. You won't be going anywhere like that."
Irene saw the government official's distress and laughed. "Don't worry, Ice Man, I won't be taking photos. More's the pity, but it was one of your sister's conditions if I wanted to come and play."
John gripped Greg's hair, tight in his hand and he winced. "You still haven't come, boy, do you want to?"
Because of the usual lack of Sherlock, John didn’t worry and he had had no warnings from any of the alarm systems, so Sherlock wasn’t up to no good. He could imagine that if he wasn’t well entertained, being up to no good would become a regular occurrence. That would be setting the boy up to fail.
John reached between the cushions and grasped the vibrator, upping the setting and enjoying the look of shock on Greg's face.
"He's got the girls. He only wants to know if you would like to meet up with the four of them for lunch later and spend the afternoon on the beach."
He was panting slightly by the time they got there. The sound deeply imbedded inside him moved and jostled completely new things and feelings inside him. Feelings he had never felt before. Feelings he wasn't sure he wanted to keep experiencing.
“No!” Sherlock snapped, but continued more calmly at his Dom’s unimpressed glare. “I mean, I’m sorry, sir, please don’t do anything to my violin. I do want it back.”
As if it had been planned, Sherlock let out a stream of loud, but muffled sounds. The doctor rolled his eyes and released Greg. "It's my sub that's the problem."
Sherlock sighed again, it was the wrong time to be arguing, naked in bed whilst his Dom stood in front of him fully clothed. It was a purposeful reminder that he was the sub and the ex-army doctor in front of him was the Dom.
“If you were to get out, boy, anything could happen to you. I have large extensive grounds, you are wearing nothing but a pair of pants and it is the middle of January and you, my little sub, are a long way from home; you could have got hurt or worse.”
Breakfast hadn’t been the ordeal it had been the previous day. He had also decided it was just best to get on with this part of the day without any agro. It wasn’t worth it. He’d knelt beside the table when told and even opened his mouth to receive every bite the Dom wanted him to. It was, however, taken advantage of as the doctor had made sure to eat less himself so there was more left for the sub. That had made the bother, both mad and snippy when he realised what John had done. Inevitably the tally had began to rise but it still was not as high as it had been this time yesterday.
Sherlock didn't speak, just dug into his waffle when John placed it in front of him. He smiled because John and filled all the gaps with blueberries.
"Try. That. Again." John got to his feet and took 5 threatening steps forward. His short stature did nothing to quell Sherlock's fear of punishment through disobeying, it never did.
Sherlock didn't comment on the random spot the hand cuffs were in, he kept his in the salad tray after all. Even so, he did what he was told.
It was ingenious in other ways too. The idea of using his phone to track his whereabouts meant he couldn’t get out of it at all. The Dom had even ensured there were no loopholes for him to worm his way out. He was used to loopholes, he liked them. Going so far as to tell him that he couldn’t keep going and hop in a cab… clever, clever Dom.
The detective quickly shed all his clothes in a neat pile and moved back to the exact spot John had put him in. He didn't ask why he had been told to get dressed again a few hours before, it wasn't like they kept apart from the other two anymore.
“Sir?” the sub repeated again, a deep frown brought his eyebrows together. John let his hand go and ruffled his curls, they were going to be even messier in a moment anyway.
While Greg was gone, John bent over and forced Sherlock's trousers down to his knees. Then toed his caged cock, making it bounce heavily.
The sub had taken a fair bit longer than normal to come out of Panic 3 days previous and he’d ended up being curled up in John’s arms, completely naked while the bath had run and his clothes had been put in the washing machine. The bath had been quick, an in and out job with Sherlock not really being much use and more of a pliable doll than a human submissive. They had proceeded to cuddle well into the night with John whispering soothing words in his ear and trying to comfort him the best way that he could, while the boy held onto the older man for dear life.
“Not for much longer,” John snapped back. “I assume you are a Detective Constable at New Scotland Yard.”
The Dom moved back to the table as calm as anything. He was pleasantly surprised to find his sub hadn’t moved at all. He tied the leash around the table leg.
They searched everywhere for over 4 hours before it got dark and they found nothing. They didn’t even find a trace of the direction Sherlock went in.
Sherlock waited what seemed like forever for the blonde to exit the box. Once she had disappeared, he made his way towards it.
A man much beefier than the one holding him appeared from a side door. He caught a glance at the new arrival before bowing his head as submissively as he remembered the pair liking. Just his luck to bump into not one of his bad memories but two, in one go. Benjamin had introduced Douglas, before they had had their fun.
“You get one warning, boy. This is it. Just because I am not facing you does not mean that your hands can reach for your cock, if they are behind your head when I turn around we’ll say no more about it.”
"That has been arranged," John said with a laugh. "It's been arranged very well." He let the flogger fall again and again.
“Men,” Mycroft called over his shoulder. Immediately 8, no 12 armed men came in, their rifles at the ready.
Across the room Sherlock had begun an string of expletives. John shut him up by the simple expedient of sticking three fingers into his mouth. Unfortunately, the sub bit down on them in protest.
"I haven't decided if the things she repeats are done so because she enjoys them or because she's struggling to understand something," Mycroft admitted. "Her mind is a puzzle not to be fathomed."
He disappeared into the bathroom to have a quick wash, thinking on Sherlock's behaviour the whole time, when he returned he had to grab Sherlock as the sub tried to force himself to his knees.
“No sub enjoys being punished. If they do, the Dom isn’t doing it right. No Dom enjoys punishing their sub. If they do, again they are not doing it right. However it has to be done for lessons to be learned, if not they are repeated. Do you consent to your punishment boy?”
John stared blankly after his walking sub for a moment and then smiled innocently at the Californian looking rather bewildered. He slammed the cab shut and jogged slightly to catch his boy up.
“I told you, that I used the same punishment as other Dom’s when my subs come without permission and I meant it. I differ from them in many ways, but this is something you were well warned about and something I can’t ignore despite how much fun we were having.”
Greg dropped his hand on Mycroft’s shoulder to prevent a reaction and it worked because the older man knelt back on his heels.
This chapter is different to the rest, it isn’t dark by any means but John is harder on Sherlock than we are used to. If you want more specific spoilers go to the end of the chapter and read the end notes.
“How did you know where I was, sir?” Sherlock asked quietly, after a while. “That was the only part of your assured rescue mission that I wasn’t sure on.”
“Well, in order to prevent that from happening again you need to talk to me more openly. I’d like to think we’ve established a bond between us now, yes?”
“You probably can. But I’m sure the front door that you will pass on the way will be too tempting for you to resist, and I think two punishments before 11 o’clock is plenty for now, don’t you?”
“What’s up, pet?” He hadn’t stayed under long, but it should be long enough to get him through the next few days. This wasn’t subspace quiet or even a variant on Panic quiet, this was something different.
Irene rested hee hand on the youngest Holmes' arm. "I don't think the Ice Man did anything." How could he have done? "I think your brother is an interesting challenge."
John could tell Sherlock was right on the edge of orgasm, so he pulled off before he could tip him over. Looking up, he saw that his boy's eyes were screwed shut and he was biting his lip.
The sub paused this time. “It’s murder. All of them. I don’t know how, but they’re not suicides, they’re killings – serial killings,” he amended. He spun on his toe in pure glee. “We’ve got ourselves a serial killer. I love those. There is always something to look forward to.”
As he settled in the corner, the detective struggled not to hold his breath. Instead, he tried to relax into the proper stance so he could hold it as long as John demanded.
When they reached it, it was empty but the keys to the helicopter were there. Sherlock scooped them up then ran out the door.
John stopped running his fingers through the sub's hair, gripping it tight instead. "You forgot something, boy."
John shook his head. “That’s 12. You may not like it, but it is a fact of life so you will learn and you will get used to it. Don’t try telling me it’s because of what happened in the past, pet,” John cut him off before he could interrupt him again. “You know by now I am nothing like them.”
Eurus pouted. "Don't make this too easy. Irene will find it boring." She held out her hand behind her. "Join me, Irene."
“Bollocks,” he hissed. John nearly collided with him. “I’m sorry, sir, but we’ve got to go up,” he tugged him towards a fire escape ladder and only let his hand go so he could grab it and begin to scramble.
"Alright." John paced a few steps, then stopped. "I'll just have to show him that I'm not going anywhere and hope he comes to his senses." He snorted. What were the odds of that?
Sherlock sighed at being called boy, he’d been a pet all morning. He worked hard for John to keep calling him pet and now it had stopped just like that.
"No, it's not," his father agreed sadly. Mr. Holmes sat in Sherlock’s chair, holding Finn on his lap.
Eurus had grabbed hold of the matching gag but rather than make Mycroft yell out in order to shove it in his mouth, she stood and stared at him.
Finn just closed his eyes again. “What about a private tutor?” Sherlock asked. “When you turn 5?” If he was honest, he didn’t want to let the boy out of his sight any more than Finn wanted to leave him.
Their meal had long since been finished and taken away. They were just quietly talking amongst themselves.
The doctor clipped him on the back of the head. That was the first remark the boy had made that was remotely the brat's usual attitude.
Greg walked over and ran the crop along his boy's spine. "I'm not going to tie you up. I expect you to stay right where you are without moving. Do not disappoint me."
Sherlock felt slightly awkward watching. His brother and Greg had been in a relationship for years. He had only been with this Dom for a week and would only be with him another 11. He glanced up at the doctor who had been watching him the whole time. Sherlock would never know they were thinking the exact same thing.
"I know exactly what you are thinking, Sherlock," he yanked his arm up his back. "And you are so far from the truth it's almost laughable."
Greg grabbed Mycroft by the scruff of the neck and pulled him to the side, intent on finding out what the hell is sub had been up to.
“Well?” He ignored the attitude and folded his arms after resting his cane against the wall. The sub hadn’t looked at him yet.
"Did I say you could make a noise?" Greg asked, gripping Mycroft's hair in his fist and pulling his head back.
so casually made him grind his teeth, but he had promised not to make things difficult for his sub. Still, the way he just seemed to expect it, but worse than that, accept it, was something John would definitely need to work on with him. Sherlock wasn’t arguing to be a good sub for his Dom, he wasn’t arguing because he genuinely believed it, he was almost glad that Sherlock’s tone was slightly more sarcastic in his reply.
“Your mum won't get out of prison, babe,” John could immediately sense what was getting to Sherlock.
“Coming from you!” The doctor laughed so hard that Greg had to take the tray of ice creams. “Good job we’re at the beach with no walls to climb.”
“Explain it to me, Sherlock.” He used his name deliberately, it would hopefully help the boy to understand that he wasn’t in trouble but could potentially be if he continued to be obstructive.
“I don’t care whether he likes it or not. It needs to be done or the past will repeat itself like it did last week.”
“It’s probably your first trip to London, right? Going by your final destination and the way the cabbie was taking you – sightseeing?”
Greg had returned with the clamps and was on his knees below the detective. He teased one of Sherlock's nipples until it stood out, a proud little nub, then the Superintendent placed a clamp on it. He wasn't happy with the placement, so he removed it, attaching it again.
“He hasn’t been in touch,” Sherlock offered quietly, looking away, but not stepping away from the firm grip on his shoulder. Greg had such a natural dominance about him that Sherlock felt himself drifting towards subspace. Something he couldn’t let happen, but didn’t know how to stop. He brought his head up and met the Dom’s eyes for the first time since he had arrived.
Sherlock practically yelped when his Dom took him in his mouth and sucked him. The sub's eyes rolled back in his head and all too soon he came, embarrassingly soon. He covered his face with his hands, but it did nothing to cover the blush that had crept down his neck and torso.
Sherlock growled and John’s whole demeanour suddenly changed. It was as if the growl was a switch and John had had enough.
At Sherlock’s continued confusion, he added, "What did you expect? You've been more of a father to him than his ever was."
He had had a case about these sorts of security measures before. They were used at supermarkets to keep trolleys from being stolen. They had also been used at an airport, but it wasn’t the luggage trolley being stolen that the police had been worried about. It was the amount of drugs stashed on one of those trolleys. Anderson, the idiot that he was, always ended up being put on jobs he had no clue about. They didn’t even need forensics there. He had claimed that there was no way the trolley full of cocaine could get past them when he was clearly wrong because it had. Sherlock had taken less than 30 seconds to make the deduction and had pointed out that it was in fact easy if you just moved around the areas that locked the wheels. It was also just as easy if there were two of them, which was likely given the size of the job, to lift it up past the magnetic force’s reach.
Sherlock shook his head, somehow already on the edge, he hadn't come since before he'd been caged. That had to be at least a week? Was it a week? It seemed like so much longer! He wanted to ask John, but couldn't find the concentration to do so. Or find the point, as his prostate spasmed again.
He snatched up the metal anal hook and began to work it in. It was cold, so Sherlock automatically flinched away from it. “No!” John smacked his open palm down on his sub’s arse. “You do not move.”
“Sherlock,” John closed his eyes, thinking briefly, he knew that would be brought up, and he hated himself for being the cause. But if this whole thing was a set up, an officer was 100% likely to find those shoes anyway. “I thought they would clear your name not damn it more!”
John fiddled with the leash and wasn’t surprised that when he headed to the door, Sherlock crawled along behind him rather than get up and walk. John slowed his pace to match his sub’s and absently dropped his hand to stroke at Sherlock’s curls.
The new man smiled, “Put it this way, sir, if he was a sub I would have snapped him up immediately.”
"Slow down, you git!" the Dom said, laughing. As soon as they had got into the shower with the water running, John pushed his boy to his knees.
His own Dom dropped a hand in his curls, and he tried his hardest not to push up into the comfort those few fingers offered.
"I'm not callling you a child, boy. But the brain chemistry of submissives is similar to that of one. I fear I was too gentle with you. I initially started to get harder as this progressed and then it had been so easy to become lenient as you'd learnt to behave and because of that, you lashed out by running away. As you haven't explained why you ran, nor seem to want to I am making the assumption that you need more of my full on attention."
Many, many hours later, John fell asleep, his pet curled in tightly on his chest, his two closest friends upstairs and his walking stick long forgotten on the floor of the kitchen.
John hit himself in the forehead with the palm of his hand. "Mate, we should have seen that coming a mile away."
John wrapped his arms around his boy and started teasing his nipples. He pulled on then, twisted and pinched them hard until Sherlock started making little whimpering sounds. "Aw, boy, do they hurt?" He pinched them harder. Just as Sherlock tried to move again, Mycroft bit down. "Mycroft is becoming… independent again," John laughed.
Greg could clearly tell because he left his fingers in Mycroft's mouth far longer than he had originally intended.
“So how old were you at this point?” John silently encouraged him to sit up and he passed him his tea.
Greg took the hint and gathered his two girls up. "Amy, Beth, get your coats. It's time we go home."
The doctor sipped his coffee and sighed. "I'd better keep one for him. He hasn't had a drink since we left this morning."
John smiled at the ingenuity involved in working that out, but knew it was probably nothing for Sherlock. It was just rocket science for everyone else.
“I… well, yes, sir,” he knew there was no point trying to lie, but he could at least defend himself. “I knew last night and then once you offered to do it in the morning and I agreed, I kept telling myself the number over and over and then you shoved that plug up my arse and I forgot.”
"Wrong," John said, sounding oddly like Sherlock. "I should have seen it sooner. All the clues were there for me, I just didn't put them together before now and I should have."
The guard that had been beating the eldest Holmes minutes before had stepped well back out of the way. He actually looked a bit wild eyed, like he wanted to bolt, but daren't.
With that, Greg's eyebrows shot up in surprise. "You want me to treat you the same as your little brother?"
John glared at him, his gaze strict and unyielding. “Kneel!” he barked, unimpressed by his brat’s show of such open defiance.
God, Sherlock wished for John. Just because he knew how to handle this didn’t mean he liked it. John had shown him a better way – the right way according to him. John always knew what to do, he was supposed to appear around about now; save him. Protect him. He knew now that his Dom wasn’t on ‘their’ side, he was on Sherlock's and he wanted to look after his sub, he hated it when he got hurt.
It was several days later that Sherlock made his next move, once again avoiding John by going while he was at work. Canary Wharf was quite the distance from home.
Seeing that the mood was a lot lighter than it had been, John decided to broach the subject that he had previously pushed to the back of his head for later discussion. “What about Greg?” he didn’t bother to elaborate, he knew he wouldn’t need to. That thought was probably already swimming around in his boy’s head with no destination in sight.
John attached the remaining clamp to Sherlock's other ball, then he gave the clamps a tug, causing the sub to grunt in pain. The Dom walked around and watched Greg put the collar on Sherlock. "I wonder how far he's going to push this?"
Greg reached between Mycroft's legs and grabbed his caged cock. "I'm going to take this off of you, but that doesn't mean you get to come, not any more than your brother is going to get to."
Benjamin had been one of Sherlock's ‘one night stands’ a long time ago – during university, his first year, before everything had gone so badly wrong.
He took Sherlock’s head in his hands, placing them either side of his face as he kissed him softly. When the sub offered his mouth, John rocked back, but didn’t let go.
“You can move from position,” John said absently, there was still an under layer of anger in the Dom’s tone, but it was fading rapidly, especially with a meek submissive in front of him. He watched as the boy collapsed from his knees and curled tightly into a bundle; protecting his mistreated cock.
"Guards!" Eurus yelled, not relenting on her grip on Sherlock as she yelled. They rushed in. "Chain my big brother's feet to the floor."
John  pressed Sherlock forward slowly so he fell to his chest. He helped lower him down and then began to wrap the rope around his feet.
John shook his head sadly and leant down he pulled Sherlock to his feet by his arm rather than his hair.
The shower prooved to be incredibly large. It was practically a room in and of itself. There was more than enough room for the four of them.
Sherlock had squeezed his eyes shut. The machine was fucking into him relentlessly and the lube was burning something fierce.
When he turned around he was right, Sherlock was inches from escaping. He reached out and snagged him by the scruff of the neck. “Don’t mind us, Mrs. Hudson, I’ll deal with Sherlock. And the curtains.”
He tied the leash off again so Sherlock couldn't go anywhere and then retrieved a cock cage from one corner. This one had an addition; a narrow yet long penis plug at the tip.
“Wait.” Sherlock whimpered slightly and stopped, regaining his balance on one foot. His shoulders tensed, but he didn’t pull away. His arms went out to the side as if he was expecting John to grab him.
The sub was about to respond with a snarky comment but retained it quickly at the last minute. “I apologise, sir,” he said quickly. He wished John had been there to head him apologise without prompting.
Sherlock tried to jerk his arms free from Greg's grip, but his hole was on fire and he lost his balance, falling into the Superintendent's arms.
John and Greg discussed the case Sherlock had hurt himself on and how far they'd gotten with the evidence the detective had provided, John tried to include him, tried to praise him to get his attention but Sherlock just nibbled on the pizza.
He wasn’t stupid enough to try and run when there was an ex army doctor sat beside him. It had been a plan, a simple plan, one to get the knife from the desk that his brother used to open envelopes. A very simple plan. The fact everyone seemed to believe it was some sort of escape plan had been exactly the point, but it served as further proof of them underestimating him.
"It's nothing to worry about, Sherlock. Just as John punishes you when you're rude or disobedient. I do the same with Mycroft."
He would have spat at her if he could have done. Instead, he closed his eyes, refusing to look at her.
John pulled him over to rest his head in his lap. After a few minutes, Sherlock turned his head towards John's stomach. He started mouthing at his Dom's zip. Again. John pulled him back by the curls. "Boy, we're almost at our destination. Don't push it."
“The smug bastard was laughing at me, I thought we were finally getting somewhere with our relationship and he laughed at me.”
The Dom swivelled on his chair to face his sub to see that Sherlock’s head had fallen forward to rest against the wall, showing off his long pale neck encircled in the leather of his collar.
Greg stood and stretched, working what stiffness he felt out that way, then he gave Mycroft a hand up. "Might I interest you in a shower, pet? Together?"
Picking Finn up and carrying him under his arm, Sherlock deposited him in a chair at the kitchen table. "It seems we shall be eating after all. Do you need any help John?"
John was the most surprised he had been so far when Sherlock didn’t stand up but instead crawled forward slowly, cautiously, as if John was going to lash out with his cane and hit him. The thought made the Dom shiver.
"Boy," John growled, dropping his fork and snagging Sherlock's leash. "We're done here," the Dom decided on the spot, choosing to drag Sherlock to the stairs.
The Superintendent crossed over to Mycroft and dropped a kiss to the top of his head. "Good job, pet."
John had told George to phone ahead for his staff to prepare tea and a late lunch in the den for the both of them. He carried Sherlock through and placed him on the sofa. He'd expected a few days of them being away so he didn't have anything planned. It didn't take long to realise spontaneity was never a bad thing.
"'Of course, mistress.' You always say such things. I don't believe you." She gave his head a shake. "I never have believed you."
He looked around for the stool that he had been over that first day and paused, was this worth the consequences if he got caught? It wasn’t like he actually wanted to run, he just…
Eurus gave her odd smile, then backed away, wagging her finger and shaking her head. "I'll never tell."
And Sherlock did. He gripped his right wrist with his left hand as tight as he could and braced himself for the paddle.
But again, I am getting negative comments saying how this is unfair, how John treats Sherlock badly. I'm sorry I just don't see it and pardon my language but think it's utter bollocks.
“No. There.” He pointed about three yards in front of him, beside where Greg stood, the greying haired man took a step to the side to watch. He was more than willing to let his sub have some fun. Both he and this Benjamin character deserved it. He knew him, but only for the time of a month and he clearly didn’t know as much about him as he thought he had.
At the sound of Mycroft’s voice, the detective flinched, trying his hardest not to bite down on what was in his mouth. That would make this worse.
The doctor placed an arm around Sherlock's waist and pulled him into his lap. He kissed him again, then started nibbling his way around to his boy's earlobe.
John reached forward and cupped the detective's cheek, tilting his head back. "You will be punished for that, but not with another enema."
The sub came immediately, come spurting out into the pot John had put down. The Dom watched as it gathered, then he cleaned his hand off, as well as his pet's cock, and held him close. He ensured the clamps came off quickly and the vibrator was pulled free, but the restraints stayed on. Sherlock always said he fell under and stayed under far easier when the Dom had bound him. Bound him safely and never leaving him alone.
“Whatever bottle you choose, I take the pill from the other one – and then, together, we take our medicine.”
Mycroft glared at his brother. "I'm sure he had a good reason for not telling me. One that doesn't involve supposedly protecting you."
"I'm bored of you hitting him there, babe," Eurus said, sounding so far from normal that Sherlock choked on nothing. "Hit him somewhere else."
Sherlock flinched, a Dom repeating himself and not even a raised voice, just who was this guy and where did he get such a calm demeanour?
“You are working miracles with that young man, John,” she said as she headed back into her flat. “If you are lucky, I might bring up a cake a bit later, that is assuming you are planning on staying here?”
He had to stop Sherlock dropping to his knees several times. "Go ahead and sit by the fire. On your ass," John added, calling through quietly. "Not your knees."
As soon as he was on the floor, John started untying him. When Sherlock was able to shift positions, his muscles screamed with pain. His Dom had expected it, however, and started massaging them immediately.
“Why now? I thought you had a Dom? Not that I believed that for a moment, but…” she had met John Watson again, too much of a coincidence for it not to be true. Something just didn't sit right.
The doctor didn’t miss the sarcasm in the last part this time either, but he was more impressed by the fact Sherlock had referred to him as his Dom, let alone address him so fluidly in front of someone he clearly despised. It wasn’t muttered or murmured, he hadn’t stuttered or looked away, embarrassed. He was proud of him already and they hadn’t even got to wherever the body was. He could clearly tell that this woman was a sub, he doubted even Sherlock would be that brash, but then again, he looked back at how he had been when they’d first started the contract. His rudeness and arrogance was a seriously strong part of him, but even now in front of someone he had already admitted rubbed him up the wrong way, there was no sign of that Sherlock, not at all.
Sherlock knelt waiting for the Dom's to untie him. He groaned when a minute had passed and that didn't happen. He quickly began struggling again.
The guard shifted the position of the gun to point directly at the detective and he went still, but he still wore a sneer on his face. "Leave me up here, don't pick on Mycroft!"
John was most surprised when ten minutes later Sherlock had actually eaten everything he had been given. He was so surprised that it roused his suspicion. He didn't say anything, but he started watching his boy closely.
Without saying another word. Mycroft stood with his pizza and swapped it for the one on Sherlock's lap.
“It doesn’t look more comfortable, sir.” the sub pointed out quietly. It wasn't aggressively said, it was more said with caution.
“Either way, I’m going to ask you some questions. I want you to answer them as honestly and truthfully as you can. Okay?”
Sherlock stared at him, unsure quite what this older man was up to. After a moment, he straightened up and started to walk around the front of the cab, clearly intending to get in it.
The doctor knelt behind his sub and removed his shoes and socks. At least he could do that much. Sherlock wriggled his toes, inspring John to tickle them. He couldn't move under John's ministrations even if he had had the energy to try.
"Sherlock, you dont-" John cut off when Sherlock just bowed his head, he hated these establishments as much as Sherlock clearly did. At least with a club or a bar there was mutual consent at the public display of submissiveness that Sherlock still hated. "You may talk to Kate, if you wish."
There was a glimmer of hope and once again John found himself imagining what previous Doms would have done at the sight - no doubt laughed and hidden it again.
He shook his head. “I’m sorry,” he whispered, barely audible. Sherlock seemed defeated, but not in a submissive way. The doctor would go as far as to say his sub was scared.
Sherlock ducked his head and stared at the floor. He didn't need to be the world's only consulting detective to know it was the same one Irene had used all those years ago.
Sherlock was staying as still as possible, or rather, as still as the fucking machine going in and out of his arse would keep him.
“Well, she must have done!” he explained, trying to get back to his feet, a rough tug in his curls stopped him.
The detective saw something in Irene's eyes that he didn't like. He realised he'd best get the dildo as wet as possible because she intended to use it on him.
“Even so, pet, go through to the other room. You can play something nice for Kate on your violin while we sort some things here.”
John laughed as he put on the kettle. "You'd be amazed what your Dad and your Uncle can say without speaking a word."
He had clearly done the right thing because John began to make noises similar to a cat purring. "Hands behind your back," the doctor ordered after a moment.
He suddenly pushed away his mug of tea, it sloshing over the side and onto the table and threw himself on the floor beside his big brother. He hugged him tightly. “Thank you, big brother.”
Several minutes later, Greg padded into the playroom quietly. He looked at the sleeping detective, then glanced at John with a questioning look on his face.
The detective nodded. “Good.” He cleared his throat. “Good, sir.” He glanced up at his Dom, it was clear that John had released some information about Sherlock's situation to the other man. Enough for him to know the boy was in trouble still. Quite right too.
Sherlock smiled at the plate in front of him; waffles. The pile was steaming and covered in Sherlock's favourite chocolate sauce. He immediately dragged the tray towards him, digging in with only a fork.
It wasn’t a complete shock but a slight surprise when Finn started to lash out at the blond. John caught his tiny fists in his hands (he was still far too small) “enough of that, mate.”
It had been weird the night before, it was the first time in a long while that the four of them hadn't slept all together.
The DI watched Sherlock be led away without complaint and turned back on his Sergeant. “Don't even try and talk your way out of this. Sub or not, you do not strike a suspect!”
He hadn’t given in, not by a long shot, but he knew that petty little feuds weren’t going to wind this Dom up. He couldn’t believe his behaviour last night. He hadn’t even been in Panic, and the aftermath had faded so he couldn’t blame the chemical imbalance. He must have been tired, but still he was beginning to slip up, so he had spent the majority of the night planning in his Mind Palace.
He had run free of John and collided with a few men in suits. Sherlock, at first had believed them to be his brother's men, but he had been thrown in the back of the van that had been parked in the alley and that wasn't something Mycroft's men would do through fear of dying painfully.
“Gone,” was the simple one-worded reply. “Now, shall we try that again or are you too primitive to understand the basic rules of sub-Dom interactions?”
John had also not used the contract cuffs, but instead, used the ones Greg had handed to him. It hadn’t taken much to get a friend or two to kick up a fuss at the hospital and it was enough for him to bolt out of the car mid way up the drive. He had known he had to time it well and despite London traffic, the car was its slowest on the drive. He knew he’d land on grass not concrete and have time to hide effectively.
“No, your hands stay there. You are still on punishment until I say otherwise.” He held the glass to his sub's lips and Sherlock guzzled at it greedily.
Now, there was no time for playing. “I’ve got a friend on his way over, pet,” John said as he entered the room.
The first one had caught him by surprise. The second had landed directly over the first and hurt a lot more than he expected. The third had come down so fast that it blended in with the second.
He stepped into the room from the hall, his eyes not leaving his sub. As Sherlock glanced up and saw him, he swallowed hard, wanting to hide behind the sofa rather than under his dressing gown.
Damnit! He was better than Mycroft! He pulled the stool over and clambered up, he needed to see out before his hands or collar went near it. He thought of trying to get the collar off, he was, after all, good at locks, but that was beside the point. All or nothing. However that wouldn’t anger John, it would upset him, Sherlock was sure. He seemed to be a very sentimental Dom and the aim of this was not to anger or upset the doctor, but to prove a point.
Pressing his lips to his sub's, John silenced him with a kiss. "It's fine," he said when they broke apart. "We're taking it easy today, getting back into things, but finding the joy in it again."
He laughed again. “Sorry, pet. Couldn’t resist kissing you, that’s all.” He patted his arse. “Up you get. I doubt you’ve seen the lake as it’s around the back. Unless you went round there when you got out?” At the shaken head, he nodded to the door. “Go and find some socks and grab both pairs of shoes. My walking boots are in my room.”
Mycroft hugged Greg goodbye at the secure compound. Sherlock hugged John and Rosie. After last time, they all understood the futility of avoiding the trip to Sherrinford. At least with their boyfriends and Rosie at the compound, they could hope they would be safe.
Sherlock watched as John caught him up, 30 yards from the water. “You don’t run towards the sea, Finn. Not without telling me or daddy or uncle Mycroft first ok?”
“As I was saying,” Greg carried on after clipping him on the back of the head again and tugging his leash sharply. “It is Mycroft’s actions whilst outside of Panic which he apologised for.”
“Can I go to the loo, sir? Please?” there was no point in fighting it with the Dom stood there, and he really was desperate. He wasn’t about to wet himself in front of the blond, especially after letting himself fall into subspace the night before.
Mycroft groaned. And then it was all over as Greg rolled off him and to the side. He grabbed his coffee and pressed it into his sub’s hands.
"The burglar smashes the glass. Waits for the window to be replaced and then takes the new pane out while the putty around the edge is still wet. No one notices, because there's no noise and he can get in and out with no problem."
The sub squinted at the two Doms for a moment. “Dear, God, what is it like in your funny little brains? It must be so boring.”
Sherlock's eyes took a moment to come into focus before he glanced briefly up at the Dom, not speaking. He closed his eyes again, trying to ignore the throbbing in his leg, pain had never bothered him like this before.
Half way through the meal, between feeding Sherlock and feeding himself, John ran his hand over Sherlock's shoulders. The sub looked up at him and then tipped to rest his head against John's hip.
“Wha-?” Sherlock’s eyes had snapped open wide as he looked at the Dom in confusion. He tugged at his chained wrists immediately making John laugh.
John crossed to stand inside of his fiancé. "We really could elope, if that's what you want. The only thing that matters to me is you being happy."
The detective growled when John carefully knelt down in front of him and attempted to remove his shoes.
John watched his face, the way it flickered through every emotion Sherlock had ever come into contact with before. He tapped the tip when he got it fully inserted and he jolted again.
There really was no choice. Mycroft moved out of the way and let Irene work. Much to his surprise, she unfastened the cuffs and did nothing more.
As soon as he had let go, Greg was there and had picked him up by his feet. Finn squealed in delight as the DI spun him around.
The detective pulled free. “I don’t get what the big deal is! After Donovan took her away these events are hardly a surprise.”
“I thought the game was: I ask you a question, you ask me a question? Because you’ve just answered your own.”
The Superintendent smoothed down John's hair, but not in a dominant way, in a caring, soothing way. "Trust me, I understand. Better than anyone else ever could."
Sherlock jerked in surprise when John reached up and cupped his cheek. "Fancy a bit of paddling, babe?"
His eyes snapped open and he looked straight down at his cock, imprisoned in his Dom's fist. John tilted his head on one side, squeezing harder as he tried to make a point. “I asked you a question, boy, you'll do well to answer it.”
John shook his head and shifted so he could see the washing machine. He has had Sherlock put the curtains in there for a spin, then he would deal with them. He put his attention back to his boy’s caged cock, teasing it through the bars.
It felt comfortable laying over John's lap. Greg was amazed how much he had missed this. At the first smack of the Dom's hand on his arse, he yelped.
John knew he had to move quickly, he got as far into the room as possible before letting Sherlock hear him and then he pulled the tight arm binder up over his arms, it had happened so fast Sherlock hadn't seen it coming to fight.
Eurus gazed at the Dominatrix for several long moments, making Irene uncomfortable. The Dominatrix thought the youngest Holmes was more volatile than Jim had ever been.
For his part, Sherlock had been fairly well behaved. It was the upcoming afternoon he was worried about. They had a busy day ahead. But a client visiting… if Sherlock was well behaved he might lift the new restrictions he had in place.
Eventually, Finn crept out from under the bed on the far side. He peeked over the mattress at the back of John's head. "You pwomise you're not mad?"
Rather than make the sub walk, John scooped him up in a bridal carry and headed down the stairs with him.
“Shh,” the doctor raised his hand to cup his cheek. “I know what you’re like, it’s fine. What’s the plan now anyway?”
"Wrong." John said bumping shoulders with his sub. "Let's call a time out. You can say anything you need to right now without fear of reprisal."
“Didn’t look like it,” Donovan’s smug expression was starting to irritate the doctor in a way even Sherlock hadn’t managed. Yes, Sherlock could be a brat, heck, he was a brat for 70% of the time, but he wanted to do good or ‘be good’ as he so often called it. He had the natural submissive inside him yelling at him to behave he just tried to ignore it until he felt comfortable enough not to and for him that was a very rare occasion. This sub clearly didn’t care at all. There was the slight lowering of the head when Greg appeared but whether that was through respect to the Dominant or respect to the Detective Inspector John didn’t know.
Mycroft settled himself in the armchair opposite. "Why, I am spending a few pleasant hours with my little brother and his fiance."
“No, you're not.” The doctor stood in his three piece suit, his tie loosened through the stress of the last 24 hours. His arms were folded across his chest and his voice was stern, almost dejected.
John swore internally. Just what he needed, all because Sherlock couldn’t control his deductions when they weren’t needed. The doctor had a duty to keep Mycroft to hand when Greg wasn’t around, not only because he was the only Dom for several miles but because of specific instructions from the government official’s Dom himself. That had been decided long before he had taken Sherlock on.
Sherlock jerked his head as much as he could in response as the plug vibrated inside him and his cock begun to harden by his Dom's touch.
“Yes, sir,” he followed on after the younger sub who was rubbing at his ear as he disappeared into the kitchen.
John shrugged, not worried yet, but not far off. "Do you want to go and take a seat in the lounge and I'll go and I will find out?”
“You'd better get that, sir,” Sherlock offered, smiling slightly. He was much more relaxed than he had been a matter of hours ago. He wanted to chastise himself for getting involved with John rather than the usual one night thing. According to Mycroft caring wasn't an advantage, but by the knock on the door, maybe his older brother had changed his mind on that front.
The leash was just long enough for the Dom to make himself a cup of tea without letting the boy go, so he did so and placed it on the table. Then he moved all the dirty dishes to the floor beside the kneeling man along with a bowl of bubbly water. He also dropped a tea towel on his lap.
Sherlock’s hands had slowly returned to behind his head as he watched his Dom but John wasn’t content with that, he grabbed both his arms, forced them behind his back and held him that way. “You know, this collar is mine. You may think it yours but it isn't. I gave it to you the day you came to me as a control mechanism but also because of law, you know every sub in a relationship, it doesn't matter what the context, every sub has to wear a collar. But I will not have my subs being rude to me or anyone else outside of my house! I despise it normally, but in public it is worse, far worse. That sort of attitude is inexcusable. It’s worst than coming without permission. Now you know how much you enjoyed that don't you?”
"You saying I don't look gorgeous the rest of the time, sir?" Sherlock asked cheekily, raising one eyebrow.
Sherlock wished he could do something to make these visits easier on his brother, easier on both of them, but he couldn't.
"You're my very first friend," the youngest Holmes told Irene. "And this would be like, what? A sleepover?"
Greg fetched the rope and handed it to John. It was dark blue and would bring out the colour in Sherlock's eyes.
Sherlock opened one eye. “I’m busy.” Then he closed it again, trying to get back to his Mind Palace.
Sherlock let out a shaky breath. John was here, of course he was. John was always there. Always. It would be alright, like he knew it would be, because John found him.
“Save it,” he hissed, then glanced over his shoulder at the officer stood outside the room. “Adams, take Mr. Holmes to the toilet, to sort himself out, then take him to the doctor.”
They had been 20 minutes from home, when the car had picked them up. The detective wasn't even sure if it was Mycroft's car or John's. To be honest, he didn't really care. Sherlock was asleep instantly, curled up on his side, his knees tucked to his chest and his head in John's lap.
Eventually the boy had decided he wanted to be alone and, seeing as John had not given him an order that would counteract him being alone, he expected him to just wander off. But rather than doing just that and leaving to go to his room, he came over and knelt on the floor beside his Dom. He leant against his leg in the normal comfort seeking position. It was the first time he had ever done it out of choice. He’d stayed there a few minutes and then asked permission to go.
The Dominatrix attached a chain to Sherlock's cuffs, then ran it back to a ring on the cell wall and looped it through, locking it in place. She did the same to Mycroft, only she pulled the chain tight, forcing him to back up.
He shook his head slightly to clear it as he heard footsteps, then he noticed Greg amongst the several police officers that had gathered around him.
The superintendent grabbed the tiger balm off the table and placed a generous amount on his hand, then he settled himself so he could comfortably wrap his fingers around Mycroft's cock.
"Shut it, you," the Superintendent ordered, "every piece of equipment here has a copy. The joys of money, eh Myc?"
Obediently, the guard fired a dart into Mycroft. In moments, he was left hanging limply from the hook overhead.
“38. I gave you a choice. I warned you. If you cooperated you could have been in the more comfortable position. Your own fault I’m afraid,” John didn’t sound as apologetic as his words seemed to make out. He forced Sherlock’s hands up to behind his head. “They will stay there, or there will be consequences.”
John didn’t know whether he was surprised or not to see the brat where he’d been left. He knew he couldn’t leave, but he’d half expected him to get up. Either way, he didn’t comment, just settled in the armchair, staring at his sub.
The ginger didn't feel like much at first, but soon enough, it started heating up and burning. It took everything Sherlock had in him not to shift his hips, but Mycroft's teeth were a very good incentive not to.
For a moment Sherlock thought they were getting in the cop car that Greg had obviously driven, but he was taken passed that just as blue flashing lights came flying into the car park.
"Hell, Mycroft. I've touched one. It walked through me." With that, John left the government official standing there and headed upstairs.
"Let's see if I can do something about that." Mycroft reached out in the darkness, finding Sherlock's shoulder and running his hand down to the ropes that bound his wrists. It would take time, but the government official thought he would be able to work the ropes loose.
It was well over an hour later that Greg stood in the observation room beside where Sherlock was now being interviewed. The boy had calmed down massively in a few minutes, he'd only held Donovan off for so long to give him some time to come to his senses. Despite calming down, it was clear Sherlock hadn't. He refused to answer any of the female Dom's questions and for most of them didn't even listen.
“Mr. Holmes,” a man, Sherlock recognised as the prosecution barrister appeared at the door. “There are things we need to discuss before we begin.”
John had thought that had gone rather well. He’d already managed to teach the younger man to hold his tongue, so for that achievement alone John didn’t put his tally up. The detective had smiled slightly when John voiced this and then sent him back to his unpacking.
It suddenly occurred to him that he was alone but not, in the sense that the box was talking to him. Did it talk to everyone? He got blasted by cold air. "You read my mind?"
Greg scooped the little boy up and laughed over the top of his head towards the two men slowly walking up the beach. “Whenever your dads say you can.”
They went into Sherlock's room together. Greg, with a bounce in his walk. He hadn't submitted for long, but he felt refreshed.
Mycroft didn't move. It didn't really hurt, not badly. He was used to headaches, it came with the job, and who his brother and sister were. One little knock would make no difference.
Sherlock frowned, "What?" He wanted to fight more, but he was exhausted from hanging there all night.
“Helping to soothe the pain you no doubt feel at the moment.” He was pointing out the obvious. Wasn’t that something that Sherlock detested? And yet he had asked the question, genuinely wanting an answer.
The Dom began gently humping his boy's arse. It wasn't urgent or frenzied, but slow and insistent. Mycroft found that nothing but frustrating and his growing erection was pointless where it was squished. He let out a frustrated groan.
The detective grinned broadly, moving to stand up to walk into the playroom, but John gripped him by his curls tightly. “I did not tell you to move and I certainly did not give you permission to get to your feet in the playroom.”
She nodded once. “I was merely thinking how imaginative you have been with him… He hasn’t been successful in relationships before, as well you know.”
John could clearly see what Sherlock was thinking. “I might let you if we continue with what I have planned or I might not. If you make me punish you, there won’t even be hope.” He knew that was warning enough. Sherlock wouldn’t come without permission, not again.
Mycroft smirked as he stepped back. "No, but there's a woman coming towards us, I'd prefer if she thought you were gay."
When time for dinner rolled around, Sherlock was laying on his bed fiddling with the strings of his instrument with precise finger twirls.
“Yes, sir,” he moaned. “But it’s not my fault, sir.” He had never been one for getting hard at the slightest touch. It usually took direct contact with his prostate and that had to be continuous, but this, the light pressure at his hole, the feathering touches of his Dom’s hand… it was too much like he was enjoying himself. He knew this Dom was different, the final proof had been what he had done to Wilkes, what felt like forever ago, but he made their sessions enjoyable for the both of them and Sherlock always got to come, always. He thought this wanting his pleasure would distract him from servicing his Dom, but it didn’t seem to work like that.
He saw who it was and gave Sherlock strict instructions to remain exactly where he was. Not that the younger man could move anyway. It just might give him a sense of achievement if he could obey his Dom.
John’s growl was deep and threatening. It was enough for Sherlock to sob. “Coming without permission, sir,” and then; “Please, sir, please don’t punish me again. I’m sorry, sir, I’m sorry.” He hadn’t meant to be provocative. His mind was quiet, but it was distracting. He couldn’t think straight around the pain.
When John got in from the shops all he wanted to do was relax, maybe have a cup of tea with his sub knelt by his feet and a surgeon's hand pushing through the mess of curls that was Sherlock’s hair, but the detective was nowhere in sight.
The detective made a sound of protest when his Dom's fingers left his hole. He knew what was coming next and wasn't looking forward to it.
“You'll be wearing just a shirt and trousers for her visit so finish up what you are doing and I'll take you to your room.” That was unexpected, he supposed he didn't want him naked in front of this Irene woman.
He nodded his agreement. John set about getting his other arm into the sleeve and then buttoned it up.
"She kills people, little sister," Mycroft said in a flat tone. "She calls it experiments when she does it, but Eurus does it just for fun."
John smiled, feeling rather satisfied with himself, but more importantly proud of Sherlock. He reached over and took Greg's hand leaving the brothers together for a moment.
That wasn’t part of his job that he had told the detective, but he was sure he’d worked it out just by the way his pen scratched over the surface of paper or card.
The detective felt a welling of all the warm emotions that he had so long tried to suppress. He kissed the top of John's head. "Good. That's settled then."
“You're leaving me alone, sir?” Sherlock asked, slightly confused. It would be the first time in days that the Dom had left him to it.
He quickly washed and then just stood under the spray, letting it try and wash away the headache of the day, but it didn't succeed.
He let himself say, "Ow." With Eurus playing the game, he wasn't sure how to behave, so he decided to take the middle ground.
Counting without protest. This was definitely an improvement and John could see that it was going to be a good day.
John sighed. One of his closest friends’ little brother had some serious trust issues. Those stupid bloody Doms that came before him.
Eurus stopped what she was doing and hugged Irene. It had to be the most awkward hug both brothers had ever seen. It was as if their sister wasn't sure she had got it right. She was more awkward about it than Sherlock had ever been.
The doctor shook his head, thinking on how well Sherlock had responded to being here since his arrival a few weeks back. The stern, but fair approach didn't seem to be doing his sub any harm.
John stood up and reached for his cane. “Usually I’d make you wash up, but you can stay there for now.”
That caught Sherlock slightly wrong footed; wasn’t this supposed to be about power and humiliation? He knew it wasn’t about pain anymore. After the last one, Mycroft had assured him that he wouldn’t be left in that sort of compromising position again. The Dom could do practically anything he liked. Why wasn’t he humiliating him at every opportunity? Why was he being so… patient? Understanding? Either way, he immediately climbed back into his pants, feeling oddly shielded despite it only being thin material.
As soon as Finn was dressed he took off towards the sea, John caught him by the hand, “No, Finn. You know the rules.”
They waited like that for what felt like forever. When the detective was finally calm enough, John stood up, resting heavily on his cane for the first time all day.
John crossed over the room and knelt in front of him. He leant forward and kissed him, then he drew back. "I've changed my mind about the clothes. Crawl to the bedroom, strip and crawl back in here."
Sherlock watched his brother out of the corner of his eye. He seemed happy and relaxed beside the Superintendent. That was good, he smiled softly.
John nodded to himself, then ran his finger around the sub's hole. Abruptly, he pushed it in as far as it would go, enjoying the gasp that Greg let out.
Sherlock knew exactly what that meant, despite the pants he had on it was clear to the other two men that he was caged, he ducked his head. “I apologise, sir.” He knew what that meant that bloody chair as well!
Sherlock was practically out of sight now and John began to make his way down after him but paused after a few stairs.
John smiled in satisfaction. Maybe it was vindictive of him, but he was enjoying seeing her so discomfited.
"My little big brother has teased him relentlessly since they were children about his weight. It was cruel, really."
"Thanks," Sherlock whispered, which surprised the older Holmes as he'd been expecting resentment. Or annoyance at the very least.
John had been about to ask Mycroft to fetch some pegs, but Greg let out a particularly lascivious moan. The doctor laughed and went to get the pegs himself.
Sherlock let his head drop back against the arm of the chair and John pushed his hand into his curls, tugging and pulling.
As soon as he reached the main road he pulled his phone from his pocket and smiled when he finally had full signal. He put his phone to his ear so he could listen to it ring.
Irene had come up behind the government official without him noticing. She had to keep Eurus happy with her. "What do you think you are doing?" She hissed in his ear.
It was Mycroft who picked Finn up to put him in his booster. “You’re going to have outgrown this one soon!” Mycroft laughed.
Greg wanted nothing more than for the doctor to be a sub right now. At least then he could gain some control over the situation.
The two Holmeses realised they needed to still and be quiet for a moment. They certainly didn't want Eurus' wrath turned on them.
“Stay.” With that he headed into the kitchen to make himself tea... after he’d locked the flat door.
The youngest Holmes appeared. She looked at the clumsy guard and called him, "Idiot," but she didn't order him taken away, much to his relief. "You certainly had big brother worried, but little big brother still doesn't react like I want him to." With that, she turned on her heel and left the room.
“Good, pet.” He wasn’t about to make him repeat it more understandably, it was enough he got the right answer for now. He released the cuffs and Sherlock fell back onto his knees, immediately wincing as his reddened backside came into contact with his heels.
John ran his hand between his boy's legs and fondled his balls for a moment before giving them a hard squeeze. "Greg's right, of course."
“Bloody baby brother,” Mycroft growled, his Dom snagged his collar before he could storm from the room. “Kneel, Mycroft.”
“Stop talking, Sherlock. Think carefully before you speak for the next several hours. You do not want to dig your hole deeper.”
Sherlock resisted making so much as a sound. He wouldn't have dignified that statement with a response if he could have. When his sister cupped his jaw, however, he cringed. He hoped she wasn't going to start actively participating like Irene.
John stared at the defiant sub pointedly for just over a minute before he swallowed his pride and fell to his knees.
“None of it was your fault,” John pointed out. “Well, hiding in the lab was your fault. But the shit with Moriarty and those Doms certainly wasn’t.” Just really bad luck, he didn’t add.
The fact the detective had apparently given up completely made John pause, but he couldn't tell if it was genuine. He tossed his shirt into his bag. "No. If you want any hope of this ever working out, explain what you were asking."
The majority of the blood was cleaned up, but he was watching the Dom with nothing but fear and he flinched when John attempted to check him further. He mumbled another, “Sorry, sir.”
Sherlock spun around and took in the rest of the room, in more detail than he had the first time. “Yes. Where is it? She must have had a phone or an organiser. Find out who Rachel is.”
“No. He's too clever for that.” He watched the back of the DI's head for a while as he thought. “He would have changed clothes.”
Walking over to the table, John picked up a Wartenburgh pinwheel. He came back to his sub and tapped the prickly wheel against the tender flesh on the insides of his boy's thigh. "I'm going to run this over every sensitive spot you have until you can't take it anymore."
“Now, pet, this is new. It’s similar to a retracting lead. It runs inside itself, and has a length of about 20 yards, if you leave the house, you will be on this lead, so if I was you, I would get used to it.”
The detective quickly got into his trousers and then pulled out the little suit Mycroft had got for Finn.
Mycroft grumbled to himself, but didn't speak. His Dom was right. He shouldn't have spoken to him the way he had, no matter the circumstances.
“You can have it until supper, but then I will have it back from you without complaint, is that understood?”
He held up his phone. "Now about that call-" He quickly pulled up Mycroft’s number and rang him. When the government official answered, Sherlock said, "Brother dear. Get Lestrade and bring him over. There's something Finn wants to tell the both of you."
Greg was already on the sand, his two girls well on the way to reaching America with their two foot hole.
He was leant back against one corner, staring at the toes of his shoes and his hands stuffed into his pockets.
At that, Irene hefted Sherlock back to his feet, then walked around him and shoved him forward. "Forhead to the floor!" She grasped him by the nape of the neck and bent him double. "You too, Mycroft, or your brother here will see the end of my cane."
With that, Sherlock leant to the side and threw up nearly everything he had just eaten, coughing all the time.
“I… No, sir. Sorry, sir.” He closed his eyes in defeat and his ear was released. “You’re going to make me start a new tally, aren’t you?”
John noticed Sherlock’s expression and sentences that started that way, from experiences so far, weren’t good.
"I seemed to have understood you that time." He cupped Sherlock's cheek and tipped his back to look at him. "You are getting better," John informed him. "You're learning again, it's a shame I have to tie you up like this to make it happen."
"Gregory is an excellent driver," Mycroft countered. Besides, if his boyfriend wanted to drive, there was no way he could tell him no.
John smiled, lifted Sherlock and stepped out of the hot tub. Sherlock turned into the doctor, asleep in moments.
“At least you didn’t attempt to run naked this time.” John’s voice was dangerously low and Sherlock knew he was playing with fire.
The government official enjoyed his coffee. When he finished it, he set it on the side. He stood and stretched, then headed towards the bathroom to join his Dom.
After a few minutes, Sherlock let out a sigh. He felt more relieved than he had expected to feel. Soon, he and the others would be spending a different type of time together.
He slipped the envelope knife from his sleeve and set about removing the cuffs, slipping the tip of it into the key hole and twisting. It didn’t take long to hear a satisfying click.
Sherlock had ambushed him as soon as he had appeared. Throwing him into the wall and cuffing his hands behind him. He'd practically thrown him at the chair, not pausing to ask for an explanation on his tardiness.
Mycroft was struggling to breathe and the Superintendent held his head back for a little longer because of that. When he was released he took in several deep breaths through his nose.
Irene tittered, placing her hand over her heart. "You went all out when you bought these crosses. Excellent." She moved behind Sherlock and rubbed his cheeks. "Now by all governing wisdom I should use lube for this, but some of my clients like it dry and unprepared."
But rather than take his seat again, Finn kept walking until he reached Siger. Without waiting for an invitation he climbed up on his lap. “Grandad.”
Eventually there was a quiet croak from the floor and Sherlock’s arms went back to his neck. ‘I’m sorry, sir.’
“John!” Mycroft yelled, taking in the scene in front of him in a way that reminded the doctor of his sub. He was the last in the room and his men were already in the corner.
He assessed the roof beneath his dangling legs and was sure it would take his weight. It wasn’t being up here that was bothering him, chasing criminals all across London as well as avoiding Lestrade and the Met had its benefits; roofs were his favourite place. No, what was bothering him was the descent. Usually he had a plan, because usually he climbed up so would know his way down, he didn’t think he had gone up the inside of a building and down the outside before. He would have to try the drainpipe, which was a common tool he had in his arsenal.
He quickly calculated how long he had been away from Baker Street. He needed to get back if he was going to avoid suspicion.
John hid his surprise that time as he let his hand fall, not as hard as he had planned this morning when he had first woken the brat up.
John whisked away the bucket, then hosed his boy off using only cold water. He toweled him off for the sake of the equipment. It wouldn't have mattered to him if Sherlock had started to shiver.
This was supposed to be the 'fun' bit but it just wouldn't happen, so next time people, probably June after finals
"Would you like to tie me up sir?" Mycroft suggested, hoping that would satisfy his Dom. "You could tie me up and take me," he added hopefully.
“Seriously, shut it, mate,” he called back between the seats. For once he wished the detective would do as he was told.
John didn't know how much longer he could hold out. He glanced at his boy on the screen and saw the naughty sod struggling again.
“So, Sherlock,” Irene began, intrigued by the man John had spoken so highly of, “you're a detective?”
He took a sip, just to make things go smoother with his sister. At least it was a decent wine. At the sound of his little brother's grunt from behind he could tell he was still face down into the floor.
Rather than just walking towards the stairs, Finn ran in a clear sulk. Sherlock sighed and glanced to his father.
Sherlock looked away, kneeling back on his heels so he could feel the shackles on his feet, being cuffed, he could reach them, but he could see over his shoulder.. He wasn't breaking free of those. And the fact the Dom had used actual shackles rather than the cuffs around his ankles bugged him more than it should.
“You took that well, pet. Hop up on the bed.” He had hold of the jar he had used last time. It seemed to help with the bruising.
Sherlock nodded once, not caring their little moment was interrupted. "Yes, sir." The detective hurried off up the beach leaving John with the older two men.
Sherlock smiled up at him dopily and the Dom stopped him ducking his head by putting his finger under his chin. "Are you in subspace?"
Mycroft stood and followed the two Doms, keeping his hands behind his head resting at his nape. He couldn't help but shake his head at his brother who had started struggling again.
John grinned at Mrs. Hudson. He couldn't help it. He was so proud of his husband and how he handled Finn. He never would have dreamt Sherlock could be like this during that first mad case that had brought them together.
“You were clearly thinking twice about being punished now, but that’s fine. It doesn’t bother me. It is supposed to be at 7 o’clock after all. I was just trying to make it a bit easier on you.”
John snatched his phone up from the table. He scrolled through the details until he found the message that Sherlock had sent. Locating the dead lady's number, he thumbed the call button and held it to his ear.
"No… but I can tickle you." He reached forward and jabbed at his brother's ribs. Sherlock squealed like a girl and took off running in the other direction. Mycroft chased after him, catching him up and tackling him to the sandy beach. He landed on top of him and held him down.
Mycroft became somewhat alerted at the pairs' appearance but Sherlock didn't. He was just hanging from the cross now.
“That is your name…” John trailed off. He had used it the night before, but he apparently didn’t recall. Given the circumstances, John wasn’t surprised.
“Hm? What?” Greg looked around and caught the detective looking in his direction. “I have no idea, unless… I mentioned the baby to John. Maybe he said something to him.”
He pulled his phone from his pocket and glanced at the screen. “No signal. Bollocks,” he whispered to himself. “Do you know where I can get a decent reception?”
The government official picked the little boy up. "Let's go upstairs and talk to your fathers, shall we?"
Mycroft glanced down at it and whimpered. He eyed the Superintendent carefully as he threw the key up in the air numerous times.
“Yes, and the Super has gone straight over my head to Donovan, she is dealing with the case now. I have no say in it.” His annoyance and disappointment was obvious, but it went unsaid.
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock whispered, wanting nothing more than to cry. But John had been right earlier, his attitude had put his brother in Panic.
Greg shook his head. "It certainly doesn't look like the old cold war they used to fight." He raised his voice, "Boys, over here!"
Sherlock frowned and glanced towards his brother who clearly looked uneasy with the way his own Dom was staring at him.
“You always have before,” Sam winked at him before getting into the driver’s seat, perfectly content to sit and wait as long as John needed. He appreciated the respect his staff had for him.
Trying to distract himself, Sherlock watched Kate, slightly unsure how to react at another sub he didn't know, let alone a female one. The only other sub he had knelt across from was Mycroft and his brother hardly made their shared company practice for these sorts of situations.
Mycroft let out a huff, then started edging backwards an inch at a time. It seemed to take him forever to get out of the corner.
Irene removed the clamps from their cocks. "Go to the trunk and pick out a dildo. Make it a nice large one, and don't complain that you're handcuffed."
John gathered him in his arms, surprised when his boy didn’t move to hug back. He didn’t resist and was pliant, but he held his arms stiffly down his sides and his head didn’t burrow down into the Dom’s neck.
The brothers didn't speak for the remainder of the flight. They were too concerned about what they would find back home.
Greg reappeared with more water that he offered to the sub and which Sherlock accepted. The detective drank the cool liquid appreciatively.
The other sub nodded. “Oh, yeah. And I’ll tell you what else: if you call the coppers now, I won’t run. I’ll sit quiet and they can take me down, I promise.”
He let it press all the way in to the hilt and tilted the machine just so, making it brush along his prostate. The second time that evening, Sherlock felt the spark of arousal wanting to settle in. He huffed into his gag, pissed off at the Dom for blocking off his speech.
The detective turned his face up into the streaming water and let it run over him. He gasped as, suddenly, John drew a lathered cloth between his arse cheeks.
Irene had no idea what to do, so she followed the guards' examples and did nothing until Eurus shouted, "Now!"
“No! She never got to the hotel. Look at her hair. She colour coordinates her lipstick and her shoes. She’d never have left any hotel with her hair still looking…” An idea seemed to hit him like a ton of bricks. “Oh… oh!” he clapped his hands together and jumped up and down for a moment.
Sherlock knelt upright, enjoying John's fingers in his hair. He let his eyes fall shut and filed the moment away in his Mind Palace for later perusal.
John used the position of his foot in the doorway to brace himself, then he reached a hand in and grabbed him by the scruff of the neck, pulling him out. It was nothing but a bunch of limbs that appeared to flail around. The doctor didn’t let him fall to the floor though, he just forced him to his knees as controlled as he could be and did the cuffs up behind his back. It wasn’t long before it was clear his feet needed to be cuffed too.
As he worked a second finger in, he put his foot on the spreader bar, pinning his feet to the floor as well as out wide. “I can leash you to the floor if you don’t keep still yourself, Sherlock.”
He chuckled softly. “He will be here at 7. Although you are due to remain completely naked for an extra two days thanks to your stunt at the beginning of the week, you will put on a shirt and a pair of trousers for the evening’s visit.”
A glance over at Mycroft's concerned expression and John snatched his hand away from Sherlock's back. He suddenly realised he was moving too fast in offering comfort.
“I'm not your son!” Sherlock snapped as Donovan grabbed him by the arm and took him off up the corridor. “Get your hands off me!” The boy tried to struggle free, but her grip became pinching. “Haven't you got a home to go to? Or anything better to do,” he hissed.
"Then you aren't observing, brother mine. The surveillance on me is worse than anything you have to endure and as for the microchip..." He reached up and rubbed a spot on his shoulder.
The government official was quite clearly asleep again. John smirked. "He was like this when I left him earlier."
Sherlock shook his head as he tested the new bonds slightly. All he succeeded in doing, apart from proving he couldn’t free himself, was tug annoyingly at his cock.
“I don’t want to prepare lunch. I’m useless at domestic things and can’t cook anyway. You’ll only end up-”
Sherlock's grin got wider. It was weird seeing Sherlock react without seeing his eyes doing the same. "I'm a volcano!" the detective said happily. "Like the one at Pompeii. Whoosh, and no one can resist me." He kicked his feet up in the air and rested them against the ceiling of the car.
“Sherlock?” John asked, crouching down beside him he held the back of his hands to Sherlock’s forehead. “You’re not hot. What is it?”
"I can tell it's not a person. It's a ghost. I would think that would be obvious." He pointed towards the shape. "What else could it possibly be?"
“That's the fourth time you've failed to address me correctly, Sherlock,” John replied, choosing not to respond to the question and offer a reprimand instead.
Sherlock was forced to meet his brother's gaze. It made him feel guilty about his biting dog remark seeing the predicament he had got his brother into. It made him feel less guilty when he was a mirror image.
The DI nodded. “Whether he wanted you to come then or whether he knew leaving at that stage was bad I don’t know, but whichever way you look at it that is a massive improvement.”
A squeal of delight sounded its way from downstairs and they soon heard Finn and Mrs. Hudson on their way up.
The other members of the room made a point to not pay any attention to Finn as he came back in. They didn’t want to embarrass him but the second the boy was on his feet, Siger swept in, scooped him up and dropped him, letting him bounce on the sofa.
“Stay here, sir,” it came out as a croak and it sounded so far from Sherlock, if he hadn’t been watching him when he said it, he wouldn’t have believed it.
Irene licked her firey red lips. "It will keep his mind where I want it and make it harder to ignore the other things I do to him. Besides," She turned to keep it hidden from Sherlock whilst showing it to Eurus, "extra weight can be added to it if he's a bad boy."
Sherlock physically tensed beneath the hand carding through his hair. He didn’t want to speak about that… about them, they weren’t happy memories.
Siger and Mrs. Hudson sat just at the edge of the water in beach chairs, the water rushing over their toes in shallow waves. They laughed at some private joke as Finn approached with his ice cream, Greg close on his heels.
Sherlock’s mouth formed a thin line. He hated to have to chide the boy, but he was going to have to go after him.
With a defeated sigh, Sherlock grabbed his rucksack, hoping his brother’s men had already dealt with his cases. He hated unpacking. It was tedious.
“The bastard!” John’s stomach dropped further than it ever had before, so did the phone in his hand as he picked up his pace with a determination he wasn’t aware he had been hiding.
Opening the front door, John gestured the two out. "Come on. We've got to get going or we'll be late."
Sherlock smiled up at him at that, the redness to his cheeks finally fading away. John ran his hand over his face again, cupping his chin.
The barrister frowned, disapproving, but Finn's presence did what no one else could. It calmed Sherlock instantly.
“That I am, boy,” he responded. He smirked as Sherlock’s head snapped up at that term of address and realised he wasn’t really in trouble. “But I meant with the case, you git.”
He roused him gently when they reached Baker Street, but Sherlock jerked awake, alert within seconds. John smiled, but realised it was most likely a defence mechanism - a way to protect himself.
When they had the detective where they wanted him, John adjusted the rope that tied his bollocks to the machine, then he added a few more ropes in other places for support. He wanted his boy to be uncomfortable, but he didn't want him hurt.
The kneeling man was so lost in thought, he didn’t hear the doctor coming up behind him and he actually jumped outlay when he spoke.
The doctor took Finn from the room and into the kitchen, aware Sherlock would want to ring Mycroft to discuss plans despite the fact Finn was only 3.
"It's alright, but you still have to go tell Beth that." He gave Finn another hug. "Take your time, though. We're not in a hurry."
Mycroft popped off for a second. "You've already come once today, sir," he couldn't help but point out.
With a heavy sigh of his own, Sherlock bent over, unlaced his shoe and handed it to the DI. As he did so, he glanced around the older man in search of his Dom.
"Open up, boy," Greg ordered. When Mycroft complied, he pushed the ball gag between his teeth and buckled it tightly in place. "Hmm, better, but there's still something missing.
"We're going to play with him, little big brother," Eurus said delighted. She gave Sherlock a shove and he staggered off of the stool.
"Have you got that one?" Greg asked. At John's nod, he bent down and picked Sherlock up, "Shower first, then we can get chips on the beach."
When they finally had him bound, a rope harness tied in place, the Superintendent lowered a hook from the ceiling, catching it in the loops of rope meant for just such a purpose. "Kneel," he ordered his own sub over his shoulder.
After several more minutes of John watching Sherlock, he dragged him across the room to the kitchen. He place a bowl beneath his mouth. “Spit it out.”
"I will not spank you or use the strap whilst you are in so much bother with your leg. I will keep your tally total until you are well enough for it to be dealt with. In the mean time." John got to his feet and left the room.
“No. It’s ok at the moment. If he sleeps for much longer I will take you up on that rather than move him. It’s clear he’s exhausted.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to protest, but John pushed a finger inside to cut him off, smiling when the sub automatically began sucking like it was the only thing he had ever had. “Let me finish, pet. You’ll spend the next few days in bed or in the lab or in the study with me, OK? You can also have your clothes back, but I still want you to sleep naked.”
By lunch time, Sherlock was sobbing uncontrollably, he had originally stayed curled up, but now he was sat back on his knees, his hands back resting behind his head, reminding him that the Dom was angry and had called him boy. He didn’t know why, he just felt closer to his Dom in this position, the one John had left him in.
Mycroft looked at the doctor. "John has recently engaged in coitus with you. Likely in the last 5 hours. He-"
On return, Sherlock wasn’t where he’d left him. As he opened the door and looked around, the boy was curled up in the corner, looking very cat-like.
The doctor ran his hand through his sweaty messed up – more than normal – curls, all the while letting his words sink in for a moment. “I know you are,” he said softly, eventually. “We have time for a cuddle before we’ve got to get ready for the evening. How does that sound?”
John glanced at the coffee shop and then at his sub. Before he could ask Sherlock, Irene grabbed his hand and pulled him through the door, muttering, "As if he has any say in the matter."
“Alright, boy, your choice.” John walked the 7 paces around the bed without his cane and grabbed the sulking detective by his collar. He pulled him off the bed and dragged him to the middle of the floor where he pushed him to his knees. Sherlock should be accustomed to kneeling there already.
“Back straighter,” John ordered and then returned to prodding his legs with his cane until he was in an appropriate position.
With a well-practised hand John had Sherlock’s length encased in the little metal rings, securing the cage behind his balls and locking it with similar technology to what was in the cuffs and collar. “This is more for orgasm control than denial, boy.” He tugged the collar, sharply. “You will ask for permission when the time comes, but you will also have to earn it.” The cage was fairly basic, except for the technology at the base, it would allow him to go to the loo without a problem but getting hard or reaching orgasm on his own was near-on impossible. John tugged the collar again. “Is all that understood?”
“Yeah, I pick pocket him when he’s annoying. You can keep that one, I've got plenty at the flat.” The detective seemed quite proud by that fact.
John's eyes rolled back into his head, his master's prick still down his throat as he was filled oh so completely down below.
Sherlock grunted as his cuffed wrists were grabbed by his sister and yanked upwards. "One, mistress. Two mistress." Sherlock kept counting, keeping his voice flat and indifferent.
John set a bowl filled with the waffle ingredients on the table in front of Finn and gave him a spoon. "You get that stirred up good whilst I get the waffle iron ready."
Sherlock returned to the table with the bottles of sauces which he began to squirt all over the place.
John didn’t stop on the second floor, but then Sherlock hadn’t really expected him to. “Your anger is not going to make this any easier for you to deal with. And frankly it’s your own fault. Move.”
It was at that point the waiter came over with a dozen empty glasses. Finn looked at them questioningly and, then he looked up at Sherlock. He'd obviously never seen anything like it before.
The eye roll Mycroft gave put Sherlock's best eye roll to shame. "But, sir, Gregory, I need caffeine," the government official whinged.
It was clear John was testing the younger man's patience as he moved about the room. He knew the boy's senses would be on overdrive trying to deduce what he had planned for him, but he'd get nothing. John was picking up and moving toys he had no intention of using just to mess with him. He wanted the scene to be a surprise to the sub, not play out something Sherlock knew was coming.
John played with his nipples, getting them to perk up and peak between his fingers. It was fairly obvious to the kneeling man what was coming next.
The Dom knelt down beside the younger man and took hold of his soft length. Sherlock pulled back, forcing the doctor to grab the D-ring on the collar with his finger to pull him back up straight.
After working it in and twisting it to and fro for a while, he patted Sherlock's white arse. Then, with that, he turned on his heel and left, more than content Sherlock couldn't do anything without his knowledge or his permission.
Sherlock's eyes widened. What had he done wrong this time? He gnawed on his bottom lip and tried to turn to face the back of the sofa again, the only way he could escape.
“Even better, pet. For that I’ll take one lap off the amount I was going to make you do. Now come back.”
“I was going to do this by a swimming pool,” Moriarty spun on his toe as he pondered out loud, “but I changed my mind.”
"You were lucky how little time we spent up there in the early days... Well for play, I punished you most of the time. Behaving is more important than the games. Even so, move."
“Now I want you to pick something you would like as a reward. When I think you’ve been good, you will be given it.”
“Sherlock, turn around for me, boy,” John ordered, his tone wasn’t sharp, but it was enough to be a warning to the kneeling sub.
Just as Sherlock relaxed completely, John bit his nipple, hard. The sub was so surprised he brought up his hands to try to cover it, then he flinched and lowered them. "I'm sorry, sir. I'm sorry."
Mycroft met his eye and winked unnoticed by the two mad women. They could do this. Mycroft hissed in a breath as Irene tugged at his cock again.
The detective took his brother’s words in the spirit they were meant, not looking for hidden agendas because they weren't there. "Thank you, Mycroft. He's more important than the rest of us, isn't he? I don't think I ever understood that about children before now."
The sub scrambled to obey, trying to lower his trousers as he turned. He ended up falling over on his side, legs tangled much to his humiliation.
“What? Why?” Sherlock's eyes were wide as he glared at this... switch. This man that seemed to have Mycroft so worried. Who even had the power to make his big brother worry? He was the British Government.
John and Greg exchanged exasperated glances, then the superintendent went into the playroom. "What?"
John glanced at his sub, waiting for the inevitable 'dont be a moron' comment, but it never came. "So was I," he conceded instead.
Sherlock had declared the entire collection boring, but John had enjoyed looking through them over and over with the little boy.
John saw the traffic first and glanced at his watch, it wasn't right at this time of day. It was far too busy in this part of the city.
Sherlock stared at the carpet just in front of the older man’s feet. He realised how wrong he had been, he had disobeyed a direct order, that was always bad, but this was the Dom’s private room, where secrets could be kept, he was technically only a guest. He should be punished much much worse than this, he should be left longer, he should be caned.
He knew the outcome of this. He was sure he had known the outcome when he'd got out of the cab in the yard.
John marched over and shut the windows with a slam. “Don’t even try!” John barked, knowing full well Sherlock was on his feet and by the door already.
"No buts. I can always pick up where we left off. But my point has been made and you have learnt your lesson. Haven't you, boy?"
“I know what’s going through your head Sherlock. I don’t need to be a Holmes, nor your Dom to see it. In fact, I don’t think either of them do.”
“Yes, sir,” Sherlock didn't know whether to be happy or sad that John was staying. Happy, because he got to spend time with the doctor and it helped ease his guilt, or sad because it meant he wasn't trusted. He was glad he hadn't had his violin taken away, it was on the list of punishments that had been agreed, but he had to admit, just knowing he had disappointed his Dom and lost his trust was far worse than losing his violin for a few days.
While he knew his sub would obey through fear of further berating, the doctor used the time to route through the big hold-all Mycroft had dropped off. It was full of everything he would need. He’d phoned his staff as soon as he realised Sherlock was playing up and told them to pack the usual gear.
Sherlock would have complied with anything at that point if it meant getting out on the beach quicker. As it stood, kissing him wasn't that bad of a deal. He opened his mouth beneath the press of Greg's lips, granting him entrance. Sherlock melted under the Superintendent's ministrations, going soft in a way he hadn't all day.
“Of course I know him. He’s my boss.” The way he said it, he was trying to make out that the blond had no idea what he was talking about.
Greg knelt, stunned, trying to figure out if John was being literal or just referring to following normal orders. He'd have to ask Sherlock to deduce it.
John wandered at a comfortable pace towards the kitchen. He was positive his pet would be fine alone. He had realised early on that when he was kneeling, he was a lot more focused and they seemed to have avoided Panic. John had contemplated taking him aside after a few sharp orders being ignored, but this was new to the younger man. He didn’t want to show him up more than necessary in front of a stranger, especially a fellow Dom. Humiliation was slightly different when it was just the two of them and they only touched on it now after the trust they had fought so hard to gain this week. Taking him aside would make them both look bad, even if he wanted a chat rather than to bollock the younger man.
The four of them washed their hands at the small sink inside and then Sherlock actually skipped to the counter.
Over the past couple of weeks the comments have been flooding in, thank you so much. It does mean a lot. I'm a nightmare at replying to all your brilliant comments and it's got to the point where there's about 300 I haven't answered so this is a massive thank you to everyone for your support. I had a very long discussion last night with sherlockian4evr who somehow despite some other nightmares with other fics has managed to persuade me to continue. Again, this is a thank you to all your comments and although I do love reading them and although I struggle to reply (both me and sherlockian4evr promise to try better!) i just needed to thank you once again for your continued support and will try to do better to responding to each of you. I will use the time I'm saving by thanking you here to write up the rest of my draft for the next chapter :)
John carried both cups through to the den and sat down in the chair, placing both cups on the glass coffee table to the side.
Greg started pulling on the 'vines' that were hanging from the ceiling. He had a mind to try a bit of suspension with his boy. He got everything just where he wanted it, then called Mycroft over. The government official was looking rather sorry for himself when he turned around, and then he saw the ropes. "Problem?"
The DI was slightly wrong-footed. Anger was one thing, anger was something the Dom knew how to deal with, but crying? Mycroft never cried. In fact, he had only ever cried once since he had contracted with Greg.
Irene ran her nail down his chest, humming to herself. Then she grabbed his cock and squeezed. He tried his best not to react. All that gave him away were the facts his breathing sped up and his jaw clenched.
The other 3 men watched him closely. If he noticed, he was ignoring them, he couldn't help but dwell on what Mycroft had said. His brother simply didn't understand. Sherlock was doing what he had to do to keep John happy. He understood him better than Mycroft ever could.
Sherlock shrugged almost sheepishly. “I’m sorry, sir, but my number is on the website… the old website.”
"Oi! Pet, I'm driving." He tried to shrug the government official off without success. "If we get into an accident, it's your fault."
“But why, sir?” the boy repeated. Now he was repeating himself, John began to think there was something else going on here.
He had covered all the paleness of the detective’s skin twice and now his backside was a deep red. Sherlock hadn’t groaned or whimpered until the tally had hit 30 and John had covered his sit spot for the second time.
Sherlock seemed relaxed, like being cuffed was a relaxing position to be in, he was usually tense. Extremely tense.
Aware that if he argued anymore he was more than likely to lose the offer of half his punishment now. Again. He would not fail at this twice.
Mycroft nodded. "Yes, but just every three days or so. It's the least I can do to give her peace of mind. She worries about me."
“Well… you see, Greg's a personal close friend of mine. My submissive’s brother is also Greg's sub. Sherlock, there, also works for the met… so you can see the problem here then, can't you?” the doctor quirked his eyebrow at the slow forming look of horror on the other two Doms’ faces.
The older three stayed outside the den for several minutes before returning. Greg wasn't as mad at Mycroft after he'd heard what the government official had wanted, but that could soon change.
The detective started squirming, his inner muscles twitching and clenching as the lube started to burn.
John took his sub by the hand. “Greg we shall leave you to it. Just ring the bell if you need anything and a member of my staff will come straight here.”
“I changed the men over that were at your perimeter, they are under strict instructions to mention anything out of the ordinary, I think my brother running through your land would count as that, don’t you?”
Sherlock watched her go, bemused. He cared for Mrs. Hudson, but that didn't mean he understood her. He looked back down at Finn when the little boy brought him two lego pieces that he couldn't make go together.
"Yes, just like a safe word." The Superintendent rubbed soothing circles on Sherlock’s back. "Is it worth a try?"
“You disobeyed me this time by running away. You are going to run to the end of the street and come back.”
Sherlock sighed. He didn’t know how to deal with this. He couldn’t yell at the boy, he’d terrify him.
Sherlock kept himself still. Despite what he wanted, he would protect Mycroft, and that meant doing as he was told.
John found Finn in his and Sherlock’s bedroom. The little boy was sat in the middle of the bed with his arms crossed. He sat down on the edge of the bed. "You need to come back into the living room and apologise to Beth."
“Doctor Watson,” the small blond was petite as she looked up over the reception desk. “You aren’t due in for several more weeks. Is everything going ok with your new submissive?”
John opened the cupboard door slowly, prepared to step back if the detective lashed out but he didn’t. He was curled up in a ball, sobbing uncontrollably, his shoulders trembling with heartfelt sobs.
"Really?" John asked. He gave his pet a thoughtful look, then ruffled his hair. He didn't care if it was due to the last few days. Sherlock didn't look like it was a burden to behave. In fact, he looked happy.
Sherlock hadn’t said a word as he was dragged out of the Diogenes, the cuffs digging into his wrists as the Dom pulled him along by the scruff of the neck. It was far more uncomfortable than he thought possible, as his shirt caught on his collar and John dragged him at his own, shorter height.
Sherlock’s gaze flickered to Greg then to John and he was immediately concerned that Greg would punish him. “I’m sorry, sir,” he said sincerely to the older Dom, hoping it was enough to temper the punishment if only slightly.
When he didn’t obey, John pushed him down into the carpet, sitting on his back to keep him still. He removed the cuffs from his hands and feet wondering if they had been too tight to affect the boy’s already shocking attitude.
Nodding, sheepishly, this time, Sherlock took it. John led him to the door and down the stairs. “How long is Baker Street, boy?”
As the Dom had been speaking he had unbuttoned his waistcoat. Sherlock was watching him cautiously, but he didn’t actually flinch back, for which John was quite proud.
“Greg-” he tried immediately. He needed answers. Needed to know what was going on and how long he had been gone. Needed to find John.
The grin that spread across Sherlock’s face was enough to make John have to sit back down and pull his pet up off the floor into his lap so he could kiss him without the risk of fainting. When he was done, Sherlock asked, “Sir?” with a raised eyebrow.
“Sir?” Sherlock was immediately wary; he’d tensed at the mention of his old Dom’s name. John hastened to reassure him that he’d be fine by running his hands through his hair and pressing just above his ear, Sherlock pushed his head into the hand and John continued.
Sherlock was getting stared at by Mrs. Hudson. She refused to take her eyes off him as Siger crossed the room and held his hand out to John. As the doctor took Siger's hand, he was pulled into a hug. Mr. Holmes patted him on the back enthusiastically. "It's going to be good having you as part of the family officially. Although, I’m getting a sense of deja vu.”
“You are well aware your brother is coming over in an hour, behave through that and we shall go from there.”
Sherlock couldn’t believe the burn, but it was almost soothing, it wasn’t a thrashing. This was John, no one else, just John. He was brought out of his thoughts by a slap. “S-Sir?”
Irene added two more fingers almost immediately, causing Sherlock to his in pain around his gag. "Some people pay extra for a quick and dirty prep. Trust me, the plug is rather large, Sherlock. This is being gentle." She worked him until she thought he could take it without incurring any damage.
It was nearly 12 hours later that Sherlock had his idea. He tried to sit up quickly but his collar caught where it had been tied to the bed post and he flopped back as he coughed.
As the old man fell to the floor, Sherlock dropped his pill in shock. No reason to take it now anyway.
“Sir,” Sherlock interrupted his Dom and took his hand in a way a Dom would take a sub’s, but despite his confidence, John could see the caution on his face as he was unsure whether he would be in trouble for such a gesture, particularly without permission. John chuckled nervously down at the long fingered, pale hand gripping his own. “You saved me from him. I thought when you left that it was your plan. You said he was there for business advice. I thought you were giving me away, but it didn’t match any of the data I had on you and only served to confuse me further. When you didn’t hand the leash to him, I knew I was still yours and would remain that way for the indefinite future. I knew you would be back. I didn’t know how long I would need to endure it, but I am so used to him that it didn’t matter… you would be back and you would get rid of him.”
than that, it felt fantastic. His cock was throbbing with pent up arousal. It always felt worse when the cage came off. He remembered it was there, he knew that sounded stupid, but sometimes he would like his Dom to fuck him with the cage on. It was at that point, with that thought going through his head, that John changed his position. He did it slowly to prepare the sub. He hit his prostate straight on, once, twice, three times and suddenly his release spurted from the tip of his cock before he tried to stop it. He coated his own shirt as well as his Dom’s in come. He wasn’t aware of anything for a moment, but when he came to, he was on his knees in front of John’s chair. The post orgasm bliss evaporated in a second at the look on his Dom’s face and he swallowed hard. “Sir-”
That figures, John sighed, he had to keep reminding himself how inexperienced with proper BDSM ettiquette Sherlock really was.
“No!” John snapped, he put his hands on Sherlock's shoulders and pushed him down, slowly, but there was no giving in.
Oh, John was cruel. He'd never be able to come like- The plug started vibrating even more urgently inside him. It felt so good in contrast to the tight grip the Dom had on him.
John was incredibly surprised when Sherlock did just that, he turned on his heel and headed back up the beach. He stared after him dumbly as he walked passed his brother and didn't make a comment about the ice cream.
Sherlock carried Finn as he and John walked along the shore. "Finn, there is something we need to talk to you about."
The first Sherlock knew of there being no John behind him was when he collided with a random man along a street he wasn’t overly familiar with and the doctor hadn’t been there to witness – to either laugh at him or berate him, he still wasn’t sure he knew John well enough to make that call in a public place. If he'd run into something at home he would most definitely have laughed.
The Dom made sure he remained in sight and when the time was up he reached for the leash running down the boy's back and tugged him towards the kitchen.
John took him to the den where he collapsed in one of the comfy chairs. Sherlock smiled when he assumed what was coming next. John shook his head. “I haven’t finished punishing you yet. Lay down.” John knew this was harsh, but he needed a decent reminder.
He almost felt sorry for his brother when Sherlock didn't respond. He stayed facing the way John had left him. As he removed John's shoes and socks, he caught his gaze. He bit his lip to keep from begging the Dom to relent and hold Sherlock. Even as a sub himself, he knew it wasn't what his brother needed at the moment. What Sherlock wanted wasn't what he needed, and when he thought on what had caused this, he deserved it.
John was glad the boy had moved for the comfort, he sat there with him for no more than 5 minutes then got to his feet, they needed to get this over with and get back to Mycroft. “Right, 60 with the usual paddle or 20 with the tough one? Your choice.”
Greg laughed softly. "I think you're right, pet." He looked at the laptop only to see that Sherlock had managed to flip himself onto his back. "I don't know what we're going to do with that one."
His eyes flickered toward Finn briefly. He couldn’t help but think that boy had helped as much as he, Mycroft and John had combined.
“Thank you. For letting me have half now, I mean, sir.” He honestly did mean it, twice that amount in one go would have been far too much and would likely have had him sobbing.
They lay together for a few hours, Sherlock even going as far as to fall asleep. The sort of thing he never did in the middle of the day.
Sherlock looked up at his father. "You should stay." He was still getting used to spending time with him and it felt awkward at times, but he wanted whatever Finn wanted and he had to get used to it sooner or later.
John grinned. “Brilliant. As always. Another Dom contacted me online. Said he’s looking to start up his own business in training subs.”
Sherlock could tell by the way Mycroft had walked in and his Dom's response that he wouldn't like it. "No," he growled.
Sherlock should have kicked off about something by now, real or imagined. His volatile personality wasn't meant to be contained like this. John didn't know what to do with that realisation. It was nice, he couldn't dispute that, but it was wrong. So very wrong.
Mycroft found himself wishing he could prevent this happening every month. But unless he felt like putting Greg, John and Rosie through some unknown hell the pair of them would have to endure.
The clover clamps gripped both brothers tightly and didn't offer to slip. Sherlock looked down, trying to hide his tears of pain.
Irene pressed the dildo to Sherlock's hole and began to press it in. He hissed at the stretch and burn, it was overwhelming.
When Sherlock heard the footsteps behind him he knew it was his boyfriend and sighed. So much for time alone.
“John!” Greg yelled, but he had already reached the lift and the doors had already slid shut. With a heavy huff, he took the stairs two at a time. He crashed through the double doors seconds before the lift opened up.
Sherlock smiled a genuine smile at the introductions. He loved being introduced as a family. It wasn't something he had ever expected to have, but now that he did, it meant everything to him.
John pulled his hand from his pocket and recognised the number, he knew he would have to step from the room to answer it.
Sherlock barely contained the rolling of his eyes, well aware John planned every scene in excruciating detail.
John had grabbed Sherlock’s glass as well and he filled them both with coke, adding cherry to Sherlock’s.
"Oi!" John smacked Sherlock on the arse. "None of that." He didn't trust his boy at all, so he fetched a padded blindfold and fitted it in place over his pet's eyes.
Sherlock didn't like the look of it one bit. He began thrashing and whimpering his protests. Mycroft grazed his teeth along his brother's cock and he stilled instantly.
With his cock caged, Sherlock knew that it couldn’t happen again. One good thing he supposed. He was expecting a cane to come out of the bag, when it didn’t it took him a while to realise why. He was still sore and bruised from the last time he’d ‘been naughty’. John wasn’t a cruel Dom, he knew that much.
John had had to remind the younger man of the rule - when he enters a room, Sherlock should kneel - and there had been obvious reluctance as he had knelt and handed his violin back to the Dom, but he had obeyed without complaint, despite the hesitance.
Greg came in carrying the largest thumb of ginger that they had. It had been freshly peeled and shaped.
"I can see that." Sherlock observed his brother’s countenance and, much to his surprise, saw nothing there but approval.
John stuck two fingers into his boy's mouth when he opened it to complain yet again. Despite, his annoyance at the situation, John could see the sub beginning to seep down into subspace, lower and lower his body went and higher and higher his head went. He'd be floating soon.
John took a deep breath, ready to engage his pet when he was still dopey from sleep, he was more likely to answer his questions at this time than any other. “You know what happened with Wilkes a few days ago?”
“If I see that again, pet, I’ll bite it off,” John laughed at the look on his face, he seemed to be trying to work out whether he meant it or not.
Mycroft managed to break his fall but he did nothing else, he just lay there and took it. The pair of them had decided on the way over to do whatever they were told to no matter what, then they would go home and forget about it completely.
“No-one else will die, though, and I believe they call that a result,” he was smiling to himself. Perfect result in fact.
Taking a deep breath, John stood up and held his hand out for the younger man. More eagerly than expected, Sherlock took his hand and the doctor led him over to the bed. He tugged him onto the bed so he was rested against him again. “Pet, if you don’t tell me, I can’t help. And if I don’t know what upsets you or gives you painful memories, I won’t be able to prevent myself from doing either something similar (which he highly doubted) or something that triggers a memory that you don’t need to experience.”
Deciding now wasn’t really the time for this conversation, but sure it would be nothing but destructive in his boy’s head, the Dom knew he needed a distraction to get him in the mode for the case. He reached either side of the detective and grabbed his waist, Sherlock had no time to protest before he found himself sprawled across the older man’s lap.
Sherlock hurried across the room and sat down immediately. He doubted John would change his mind and swap the chairs, but he wasn't about to risk it, even if it was slim.
"Shut it, Sherlock," John ordered. "As long as that cock of yours stays hard, I won't believe your complaints."
Sherlock closed his eyes and let his head fall back against the seat. He couldn't just shut the feelings he had off, even if he wanted to deny to himself and everyone else that he had them.
"That's not going to happen. Mycroft has seen to that." The detective didn't even sound annoyed at his brother's interference.
The detective shuffled forward and knelt up, leaning against John’s hip, his hands clasped together behind his back.
“I told you to eat, Sherlock,” John said from the door, he was clearly unimpressed and tired of disobedience. The plate of food had been pushed aside to make room for the case notes he was trying his hardest to read.
Sherlock smirked, but John could see his thoughts as plain as the current novel he was reading. “Oh and you can have your phone back for the run. You will keep FaceTime on as you are running, it can face the path. You’ll record the whole journey. If you so much as think of keeping going or not going the whole way or jumping into a cab or any other such crap, look at what you are wearing and know that if you have any ‘technical difficulties’ on a brand new phone, the plans tonight are easily cancelled. Your arse is due a spanking as it is.”
Sherlock went about getting dressed, he threw his shirt on but didn't button it up, and his trousers had to be taken off once as he put them on the wrong way.
Sherlock rolled his eyes, ignoring the Dom… or at least trying to. John immediately picked up the pace that his fist was fucking his cock, precome leaking out once again, he used it as lube and kept pumping.
"Call the DI," John ordered, one eyebrow raised as Sherlock was leant back against the wall while he did the 'heavy lifting'. Sherlock shook himself out of his head and nodded to the Dom.
The doctor fell in beside Sherlock. "It'll be alright. We'll talk to him. He's going to need time. We have to remember that and expect things like this."
“You’ll regret that comment, boy,” John told him. He cuffed his arms in front of him and locked the door, setting the alarm on the way out.
The detective picked up the little boy, resting him on his hip as Finn wrapped his arms around Sherlock without another word.
Greg blushed, feeling incredibly stupid. He knew for himself there wasn't a submissive cell in the Dom's body.
John was taken completely by surprise, he had 8 counter-arguments at least prepared in his head for when the sub said no and went on a rant about how wrong this was; all now invalid.
Irene unfastened Sherlock's gag and handed it to Eurus. "Is something wrong, Sherly?" She stroked under his left eye with her thumb. "I suppose we were a bit neglectful."
There was a knock on the door and out of reflex Sherlock snuggled into his Dom. John smiled at the top of his head. He couldn’t believe how far the younger man had come in a week. “Come in,” he called softly as not to startle his sub.
That statement was so outrageous that the other three men burst out laughing immediately. John laughed so hard it brought tears to his eyes. He lifted his hand up to the back of the detective's head and ruffled his curls roughly.
Wide green-grey eyes appeared, they were red rimmed and he looked terrified. “I’m sorry, sir, I’m sorry,” it was like a mantra, he just kept repeating it over and over and over. Like when Wilkes has been here.
Sherlock frowned, to which Anderson mimicked him as he breathed in deeply through his nose. “Quite clear.” He nodded once. “And is your wife away for long?”
The detective rested his forehead on his wrists as he fell quiet. If John would just rub his cock a little more... it wasn't satisfying, couldn't be, not the way he was currently locked up. God, he hoped John wouldn't keep him in the humbler all evening.
Mycroft watched him carefully, slightly surprised at such a question from his little brother, the one who hated Doms, period.
It took a moment but eventually Greg appeared at the window. John waved him down and was incredibly happy that the DI nodded his ascent.
"We met Irene Adler in town. Had a brief discussion about... Stuff. The whole time he managed to kneel on that leg and not say a word out of place."
Greg squeezed his arse. "I packed. One suit is in the car. One. And that is for a special occasion in a couple of days."
The sub dropped his head. He knew what John had said on the matter and he wasn't about to repeat it.
“I know but, well...” he trailed off with a sigh. “I’m sorry, Mycroft.” His words were as sincere as they had been to the DI as he stared at his brother. John had his arm around his shoulders and gave him a quick squeeze, feeling proud of his boy. He really had come such a long way in so few weeks.
The sub knew exactly what he meant. Both Mycroft and Sherlock had been naughty, attention seeking subs. He daren't act like them. He made himself be quiet and tried to be patient.
“How about I tell you how I got into my relationship and you tell me how you became a professional Dom because your brother clearly disapproves.”
John’s cab pulled up outside Barts and he quickly paid the driver before racing off inside. It was amazing how his stick he had so heavily relied upon was now nothing but a distant memory.
The government official groaned. He wanted an orgasm so badly, but he knew he'd never be able to stand seeing his brother being treasured whilst he knelt in the corner or some such. "A walk on the beach, sir," he said, defeated.
Irene's eyes went wide. She'd had no idea that Eurus actually meant it. After dithering a moment, she tried to pull the crazed woman off of Mycroft. "Help me!" she shouted at the guards.
"John," the Dominatrix said, smiling warmly, "fancy seeing you out in London town, while working no less."
“No you’re not. We’re stopping at the store,” John said with a laugh. “We’ll get you some proper shorts, a bucket and spade and some other beach toys.”
The Dominatrix bit her lip, then went and fetched a cane. When she came back, she used it to strike each of the brothers on the arse, urging them along.
The DI opened his mouth and licked the Dom's neck lightly. "We'd take care of you, though, if you ever needed it."
A deep chuckle came from across the room and the Superintendent looked over at Mycroft, still swaying to himself.
“I saw him at yours back when Wilkes was around and earlier today. A few weeks ago I saw how he was around you. It was different, to say the least, there was an almost instant appearance of respect between the two of you. And the following morning… he was… well, not very Sherlocky.”
"Now, I really don't want to do this with you right now. But I don't want to see you cry even more. So we are going to start slowly and I mean very slowly, Sherlock. Do I make myself clear?
Finn opened and closed his mouth several times. Then he paused and stamped his foot again. “But Daddy!”
About halfway through the film, John stretched, then stood up. "I'd like to check on the boys in person, see if they've calmed down a bit."
It got uncomfortably quiet for a few moments. Sherlock broke the silence, "Fine." He stood to his full height and headed towards the door.
Irene stared at her, waiting for her to finish her sentence. Finally she couldn't take it anymore. "What?!"
John crossed over to him and crouched down behind him. "Pet. Sherlock. Love." He placed a finger on the detective's shoulder. "I wasn't thinking. I forgot I had promised you cuddles earlier." He rubbed Sherlock's arm, trying to soothe him. "We can play another day. Right now we can be just us."
“Thank you for punishing me, sir,” Sherlock said it so quickly it came out as a muddle of words rather than a sentence.
Mycroft let out an indignant yelp from a few feet away and the pair of them saw Greg leaning over and nipping at his reddened nipple.
“Basically, yeah,” Sherlock grimaced expecting a clip around the ear for messing up so dramatically but John didn’t seem at all bothered.
John quickly searched him, wondering if the boy was high. It wasn’t something they had ever discussed but he knew about Sherlock’s younger days. Even if he hadn’t, he was a doctor, he could see a high kid when there was one.
“Of course,” John muttered. He needn’t have been worried. Mycroft’s driver stopped at a huge beach shop that carried everything from beach towels, to buckets and spades.
"I'll take your word for it... for now." John laced their fingers together and decided to just enjoy the moment.
John went over what he had said in his head and realised he hadn't specifically told Sherlock to get in and relax, merely implied it. "Babe, you could have waited for us in the Jacuzzi." He offered his boy a hand and helped him to his feet.
The Dom brought a chunk of toast to Sherlock’s mouth half expecting him to take a chunk out of his fingers. He didn’t though. Slowly, Sherlock opened his mouth to take the bite size piece of food. He watched it, cautiously, every second it was in the older man’s hand and took it from him, resolutely avoiding John’s fingers.
“Don’t ask.” John dropped his hand in Sherlock's hair, ruffling it absently between his fingers. “It’s been quite an afternoon.”
"Trouble. Ha! I like that." Greg grinned at John in the mirror. "You should get him a collar with that on it."
When he was done, he got rid of the jar and climbed up onto the bed to lay next to his sub. He looked down at Sherlock for a moment from where he sat back up against the headboard. He was facing the other way and seemed to have calmed down, his breathing shallow. John could mistake him for being asleep, but knew better.
The man grinned, proudly, the doctor couldn’t wait to work that horrendous smirk off his face. He didn’t want to be doing this though, he wanted his sub in his arms again. He didn’t want to be talking to this thick lump of shit but he couldn’t fire, specifically at a copper. But more importantly Sherlock was too close to the pair of them. He could get hurt.
“Whatever. Can we hurry up and get this over with?” Sherlock clearly didn’t believe the Dom, he felt the need to change his mind now so as to not be left disappointed later.
“Good boy.” John felt warmed inside. That was a genuine smile on his boy's face. Of course, he wasn't fool enough to think it would last, but it was nice to see nonetheless.
John was holding Sherlock’s hand as they headed out across the grass. He had his Belstaff on and his scarf around his neck. John wasn’t sure if he liked it as it hid his collar, but it seemed to keep the boy warm. If he had to choose he would choose Sherlock’s warmth, but it wasn’t a big decision when they were in his own grounds. It was different when they were out on cases.
“I know,” Sherlock sat on the bed beside him and pulled the tie from his pocket. “I hate them too. But brother dear says we have to.”
Sherlock’s Dom had his SIG and the detective didn’t even want to contemplate where or why he had it in the first place. He was levelling it at the smaller of the two men; the one behind Sherlock.
Hissing in pain, the government official closed his eyes and let himself settle into the discomfort.
John smiled, stepped out of the stream of water and let it rinse Sherlock off, then he went down on his knees and brought his pet's cock into his mouth.
The Dominatrix couldn't resist tapping Sherlock's cheek one last time. Her bright red laquered nail stood out in bright contrast to his pale skin. She noticed that Eurus' eyes were drawn to it. "I could do your nails if you like."
Once the detective had got himself laid out, the clamps tugging and pulling, John began prodding and poking at his hole.
"What have you done?" John asked softly as they turned the corner out of the street they'd apprehended their suspect in. "Have you hurt yourself?"
“Redbeard and I used to like the park and every Sunday, Mycroft would take us, except Redbeard’s Frisbee got stuck in a tree. Mycroft broke his ankle trying to get it back. We used to do everything together, sir. It was weird when he moved out.”
Once he'd placed some of his sharper clamps on Sherlock's nipples he backed up and ordered his sub over the bench.
“How many times have you been cuffed with those things?” John asked. “Enough to know you can’t get out of them anyway.” He picked Sherlock up again and threw him over his shoulder. “You should be thinking yourself lucky, boy. I could have quite easily have dealt with you in the front room. In front of your brother.”
Mycroft wasn't taking no response for an answer, he picked his brother's hands up, drawing his attention.
John smiled at Greg's tender ministrations and gently removed the plug from Mycroft's hole. "I expect you're going to carry this one to bed, aren't you?"
As the mini bus started to move, Finn leant over and took first Sherlock’s hand, then he leant in the other direction and took John's hand. He seemed perfectly happy just to hold them.
As they got closer, the doctor dropped his fists to his hips. "Look at the two of you. You're both completely covered in sand."
As the Dominatrix talked, the brother's eyes met. They knew Irene didn't understand what she was dealing with in Eurus. The Dominatrix was playing a danger game and didn't even know it.
"You can't believe that? I had him on his knees a few weeks ago moving rice," he pointed at the room Mycroft was asleep in.
John spent his time watching Mrs. Holmes. The more testimony Mycroft gave, the paler she looked. The barrister sitting with her didn’t look any too pleased himself. Every now and again, he leant over and said something to her. She never answered, just kept her mouth set in a thin line.
Greg lowered his boy to the floor and they started working on his bonds. When Mycroft was free of all the rope he closed his eyes at what John was holding. "Cage is going back on, boy," the doctor told him.
"When we got here, you both began going... soft I suppose is the best way to describe it, instead of being the stricter Doms we had agreed you'd be."
The Superintendent and the doctor fully intended to free the boys, but they didn't want to make it too easy for them. They'd have to earn it.
Sherlock glanced between the doctor and the bathroom door, then he stamped his foot. "What do you want me to do, sir?"
“I’m not waking you up for me to go for a piss.” Sherlock was angry again. Did Mycroft know this was going to happen? Because if he did, an argument was inevitable when they next spoke as was a punch in the face for the older Holmes brother. He gritted his teeth as the Dom spoke once more.
As the DI searched for his own mobile Mycroft was looking out of the window, still on his knees. His Dom would give him permission when he was to send out his minions on a search party.
Neither of them did, which was a good thing because when the dish of ice cream was presented, it was far larger than they had anticipated.
John looked at his own trussed up sub and laughed ruefully. "Yeah, I know I should have stripped him first, but I was so annoyed. At least his trousers and pants are down. I can get to the good bits."
She got to her feet, her chair falling back as she slammed her hands into the desk. “You little shit! I know it was you!” She slapped him across the face and Sherlock bit his lip. “You know it was you! Why are you trying to act all innocent?” She was a split second from striking the sub again when the door slammed open and there was a sharp,
Slowly, he dropped his arms, but just returned to his ball in the corner. John could see how his legs were now open slightly and spotted how red and raw his cock looked. He must have been feeling that, especially in such a strenuous position.
Irene smiled at him. She looked like a venomous snake. "That's more than fine with me." The Dominatrix began prowling around the cell, finally stopping in front of Sherlock. "Your hair is irresistible." So saying, she buried her fingers in it and yanked his head back much like she had to Mycroft, then she crouched in front of him. "Beg me," she ordered.
“39,” John leaned over and whispered in his ear. He clipped the leash to the collar and to the floor again before leaving him to it.
“You were busy with Donovan, sir,” Sherlock pointed out, hoping that was enough of an answer if a slight lie.
Suddenly terrified, Sherlock shuffled over as quickly as he could. John attached the leash to the radiator, leaving just enough length to sit up on his knees, but not enough for him to sit back on his feet.
Abruptly the sound ceased, to both their relief. The door to the small room opened and Irene stepped in.
"You need to let him calm down. Mycroft is taking care of him." Greg did a manoeuvre and had Sherlock on the floor, pinned down under him. Greg managed to pin his kicking legs. "Do you think John would really want to deal with you right now? We came here on holiday for Christ sake!"
Sherlock didn’t move, his breathing was erratic and there was no pattern to the deep or shallow breaths that he took, but suddenly he exploded into heartfelt apologies. “I’m sorry, sir, I’m really sorry. I shouldn’t have come in here, sir, I know that now. I know it’s not my place to ask, sir, but please, please can I come out now?”
John smiled at him. "Sorry? I don't know what for. I rather enjoy waking up with a dead sexy detective wrapped around me like an octopus."
The detective narrowed his eyes, trying to deduce again, but John distracted him by slapping him on his arse. "I told you to stop thinking."
Sherlock frowned, rather intrigued, everything about this man was intriguing. “Swimming pool? What swimming pool?”
Greg took Rosie's hand and tugged behind the secure gate, John stood for a while longer and watched as the two Holmeses climbed into the waiting sedan and drove away.
Soon, John had the detective untied and Greg heaved him to his feet. While the Superintendent held him in place, John started unbuttoning his shirt. When John got to the button of Sherlock's trousers, the detective began wiggling, he tried throwing the Superintendent over his shoulder, but he clearly miscalculated Greg's awareness of this situation.
When the kitchen was clean, he went to sit in his chair. He brought his hands together in a prayerful position and closed his eyes.
John's tone of voice alone made Sherlock looked down quickly. What he wouldn't do to swap places with Mycroft round about now.
The doctor could see how hard he was trying to hide what he was really thinking and feeling. “It’s OK to be happy, pet,” he used the term cautiously, still not sure how Sherlock was in his head with Panic the night before and sub drop so close. But at ‘pet’ he grinned. “Can I kiss you, sir?”
The blond merely unhooked the chain from the wall and dragged the detective over the bottom of the bed, chaining his hands to the headboard.
"Stop thinking, Sherlock, it isn't going to get you anywhere," John warned. "Except maybe more trouble. If that's even possible."
Sherlock watched his brother a moment longer before switching his attention to the little boy in front of him. He was certain John found the situation ironic as the doctor often accused him of sulking himself. “Thank you for apologising, Finn. Come on, then.”
Irene rolled her eyes as she leant back and placed her feet on the governor's desk. They were crossed at the ankles. She looked over the brothers' heads. "What do you think of that, Eurus? Sherlock seems to have a low opinion of you."
Mycroft looked at the cock in front of him for a moment before wrapping his lips around it. He bobbed his head, sucking, not paying attention to the sounds coming from his brother's mouth.
The knock on the door jarred the little boy from the bed. “Uncle Mycie!” He ran through to the living room in his pyjamas and threw his arms around Mycroft’s legs.
He dropped to his knees, still keeping half an eye on the other man. It felt weird having a layer of fabric between his usually bare knees and the carpet.
“Greg, you fucking moron. How is she still working here?” John thrashed, but it was half hearted. He knew he wasn't getting out of the cuffs.
The older Holmes handed Finn to John rather than Sherlock and gave Mycroft a small shove to the door.
Greg sighed, placed the other clamp on the remaining nipple and then stood to fetch a posture collar.
“No. I don’t know who told you that, pet, but they are wrong. You’re not there to beat and kick when I am in a foul mood. You’re there to be treasured. Yes, sometimes Doms need ‘Space like you need yours, but that doesn’t have to be through a cane or a whip. It should be through something light like bondage which I believe you enjoy, according to your contract.”
Sherlock swallowed everything that John gave him, gripping his Dom's hips tight. When the doctor finally pulled out, Sherlock rested his forehead against his abdomen, smiling and pleased.
The sub just waited as John stepped away.  He waited a long time. A very long time for Sherlock and then fingers were at his entrance. It made him flinch. One soft finger and then a second. John spent several minutes lubing his pet's arse. The intention was to be pleasurable, not painful. The detective huffed several times through the gag. It was just air.
Sherlock’s voice was low and nearly broken as he spoke. With much hesitance he crept forward and rested his head on the Dom’s foot. When he didn’t immediately remove it from beneath him he pushed his head into the lower part of his leg. “Please, sir, please. I’m sorry.”
John attached a clamp to one of Sherlock's balls and gave it a firm tug. "Don't complain," he said in response to Sherlock's grunt, "this is what you wanted."
John untied him from the table and ordered him to his feet. He had been planning to let the boy kneel until he had finished making the breakfast but after that comment he could be on it longer.
“What are you waiting for, boy? Run!” he shoved Sherlock in the back towards the longer end of the street and then immediately found his pet’s number to FaceTime him. “And you’d better answer it, brat!”
John tightened his fist in Sherlock's dark locks making the kneeling man wince. “I'm sorry, sir,” he puffed out, trying his hardest not to struggle. He should have known the Dom would react that way, John hated it when Sherlock avoided a question because he was ashamed or embarrassed of the situation. He always said if he was embarrassed of the situation it was because his own actions had put him there.
He found him sitting on the sofa, apparently lost in thought. Not wanting to disturb him, he knelt in the same spot he had vacated only minutes before.
At the door to the wet room, John reached around the Superintendent and his burden and pushed the door open. The whole room was tiled, a shower head in one corner and a hose in another. There was plenty of equipment lining the edges, including an enema set, beside the waterproof bench.
“I’m only going to separate them,” John said encouragingly when the detective’s hands hovered in mid-air. He needed to be reassuring.
It was Douglas who moved to comply, the member of New Scotland Yard seemed to have frozen where he stood. He snatched the keys up from the table they had been thrown down on 10 minutes ago.
Hi everyone, I don't mean to be rude but I know what way this fiction is going. I know how close to its end I am. Those of you who are TELLING me where to take it, please don't. 5 years of hard work have gone into this fic and I'm determined to finish it MY WAY or not at all. That means it will not become a slutty fic. It will not become a 'lock Sherlock in the playroom' (seriously?) Fic. And it certainly won't become a slave Sherlock fic.
John was so... casual was the only word for it. He had structure to his day, but he also had freedom. Freedom he hadn’t expected from a Dom, let alone a professional one.
It wasn't long before Mycroft noticed his brother had fallen asleep. He held him tighter, wishing they were both at home.
“Everyone has sent me back to him with a full refund and I’m usually... Well, that’s got nothing to do with you.”
Strictly speaking, he shouldn't have been there, but the barrister motioned him in. Someone had to collect Finn after all.
Sherlock was surprised the Dom had thought to check his phone. He was even more surprised he hadn't noticed John was doing it. He found himself rather proud.
Mycroft sank back to his knees. "Please!" He turned to their sister. "Please, Eurus. He's your brother."
The blond tutted internally, he brat was just being difficult. He wasn’t scared at all. So the Dom had been worrying for no reason. “And another 5,” he growled, deciding on the spot to drop the ‘soft’ edge that was beginning to hinder their progress.
Silently, they peered through the crack in the door and Greg smirked. "Maybe," he whispered, hurrying off to find Mycroft.
Sherlock managed to struggle up so that he was resting on his chest, and his arse was up in the air.
"Quite. Thought that might work. Running warning then, open your mouth out of turn again, or fail to do so when appropriate I will use the strap as instant correction."
“Sir,” Sherlock complained tugging at his wrists, despite knowing he couldn't pull them apart. Even now, it felt like something he had to do.
“It was only a matter of time, he’s called me Uncle Mycroft for the last fortnight.” He turned on his father. “Grandad.”
Sherlock thrashed and pulled and nearly knocked the three of them over with the amount he was struggling.
But if he pulled away from Irene, he hurt his brother. And he meant more to him then the revulsion Irene's touch made him feel. It was a matter of seconds before he realised that was exactly what she had been after.
“I am not going to punish you right this moment,” John began, “because I was in the middle of a nice chat with your brother, but don’t think for a second you are going to be getting away with this.”
The cabbie picked up the other bottle and slipped his hand around the lid, jerking it off. He poured the one tablet from the bottle into his hand
“You'd better lose that look on your face because as you can tell, your cock is caged and that sound deeply locked inside it won't let anything come free. If you behave and lose the attitude I might milk you tonight.”
"How long would he last like that before dying of positional asphyxiation," Irene pondered aloud. "Best not find out. She shoved a step stool beneath his feet, and he scrambled to gain his footing.
John hugged him to his side, hating the lost look in the little boy's eyes. "Are you all done, then?"
John shrugged glaring out the window and releasing his hands from fists to relaxed behind him. They pressed up against the chair, pushing him into the seatbelt like a grounding presence.
The detective took Finn's small hand in his. "You can come back now," he said with a soft smile for the little boy.
“No, sir! No!” Sherlock had no idea what John would be hitting him with and he was sure he would make it go up on his own when he couldn’t help himself. This time he hoped he could.
The detective's gaze flickered to Mycroft. "No, mistress." Sherlock glared at his brother and Mycroft got back to his knees, his hands immediately settling behind his head again.
"Don't blame me," John groused. "It's your consulting detective causing all the trouble." He buried his head under a pillow.
Sherlock let heavy lids fall shut and focused on the breathing of his Dom. His current Dom, not his past ones,
Sherlock didn't care about that, but he didn't say anything. Instead he moved around so he could massage the stiffness out of John's shoulder.
He cleared his throat pointedly. “You don’t want to show yourself up in front of your landlady now, Sherlock, do you?”
With slow, cautious movements, Sherlock climbed onto the bed and settled beside his Dom. “I’m sorry, sir,” he repeated.
He only just heard, “Quite. Deal with it, John. I’m 10 minutes away,” before his phone slipped from his grip and he slammed into the front room with his shoulder.
When John returned, he was highly disappointed. Sherlock hadn’t just moved, he’d done so excessively. Every part of his position was different compared to how John had left him. He’d slouched down on his knees and his hands were in his lap. He’d also moved so the leash was behind him, making him closer to the door, presumably so he didn’t have to look at the thing that was keeping him on his knees. If it wasn’t for the leash, John wouldn’t put it past the brat to stand up and walk away.
A guard soon ran up and placed a posture collar in her hand. She quickly swapped out the one he was already wearing for the one the guard had brought her. "Now let's try that again." This time their lips connected, but Sherlock kept his mouth firmly closed.
Irene laughed when Eurus kicked the breaks off the cross Sherlock was tied to and dragged it across the room, leaving it beside the eldest Holmes.
Sherlock tried to jerk free from the doctor's grip. "I've been good! I even helped Mycroft. I haven't been... bratty."
"Perhaps we have been pulled into a mass hallucination, though I doubt that's likely," Sherlock mused.
The doctor took a step back and sighed coming to a decision. He had intended on making him eat, letting him use the loo if he needed and then leaving him alone again, but that was not the answer he had been expecting. “You’ve been punished enough,” he concluded.
The Dom leant forward and kissed the back of his neck where there was a rather red blush creeping upwards.
Sherlock obeyed his Dom and started sucking intently. "Hmm. Not bad I suppose." For a moment, John pushed the blindfold up to see the boy.
Smiling at the top of the sub’s head, John tried to carry on where they left off. “You were telling me about your previous Doms.”
“So, little brother,” the older sub began as John lowered them both onto the sofa, letting Sherlock turn sideways to protect himself. “What was all that about?”
Irene opened the plug and started popping chunks of ice into it. She filled it as tightly as she could. "You can set the bowl down now, crop boy. I need you to get this one turned around." She patted Sherlock on the cheek.
For the first time since becoming a professional Dom, John had the urge to stop on 11 rather than continue to the end. The boy in front of him was broken, completely. He was no longer full of fire and rage like he was a few hours ago. He looked lost. Yes, subs were usually quiet during punishment, but meek? Meek wasn’t a word John would associate with Sherlock Holmes after the way his brother had described him. He knew he couldn’t stop, that wasn’t part of his job. Sherlock would still feel guilty until his punishment had ended. It wasn’t at an end at 11.
The Dom paused with the fork half way to his own lips, "I'll tell Greg, because he needs to know for the case. He'll probably tell your brother."
That actually kicked him up the arse, metaphorically at least, as he jerked forward trying to find John’s zip.
“Enough!” Sally snapped sharply and it was enough for the submissive in Sherlock to turn his attention out the window.
“She did what? Never mind that, there is enough evidence to put him in the frame for this. I've phoned Mycroft, he's sent a solicitor and is on his way over.”
Sherlock wanted to say nothing more than ‘I don’t like your mum either’ but he knew Finn still thought about her a lot. Maybe one day he’d forget completely, it wasn’t like it was ongoing for several years.
He would tell his sub to get up on the chair next to him and rest in his lap if he thought he would get compliance, but rather than force a change in submission when Sherlock clearly needed it the most, he settled for resting his hand in his curls and slowly encouraging his sub’s head over to rest against his knee. He tickled the same spot behind his ear that he had earlier and received the shame shiver as before.
The second time John tugged the leash, Sherlock managed to prevent himself from opening his mouth, but the glare he couldn’t stop. It was incredibly irritating when he was busy to be stopped just to look at his Dom who was laid back watching him like he was at the cinema. John had explained to him last time that this was probably the easiest part of submission and if Sherlock hadn’t previously screwed up his chances with his violin, he would have been in a better mood; a more cooperative one. Then again, if he hadn’t screwed up his chances with his violin, John would be off doing whatever it was John did when he wasn’t with him.
John reached over and ran his hand through Sherlock's hair, he decided not to mention. "Is your leg hurting, pet?"
The landlady didn’t seem surprised to see the Dom and she hid her annoyance at the youngest of the three well. She turned to face the blond and knew better than to lie to a Dom. She had that sort of air about her that all the elderly subs seemed to have around all dominants. Things were a lot different 25 years ago. He remembered what his parents’ relationship was like. Until his mum had the guts to throw his dad out.
Sherlock spun around so quick he nearly toppled over, then he got to his feet immediately. "Please, sir, no."
The blond Dom glanced across the table. The goings on had obviously put the other pair off their food and they were sat there quietly.
“I don’t think I've seen you naked before, sir,” he whispered, shifting his head from the Dom’s grip and glancing at the floor. He could feel the blush around the back of his neck and behind his ears. He didn’t know if that in itself was more embarrassing.
The doctor knew he had fallen asleep, his breath hot against the Dom's suit trousers. It was always likely with subs during aftercare, they drifted to a sleep to calm themselves down. That was why he had a few books in the drawer beside the bed.
Sherlock suddenly felt very nervous. He was sure Eurus would take her fury out on them, but instead she reached up and unhooked the cuffs from the ceiling.
Sherlock continued to watch the world go by in a blur. Why did John take him out? Let him go out on cases in public? All he did was embarrass the Dom and let him down. Wouldn't keeping a troublesome submissive at home be a safer route? Nearly everything John did confused him. He could never find rhyme nor reason for most of his decisions and it irked him.
“Go and put the kettle on, pet,” John ordered seeing his sub still eyeing this new Dom warily. He had a right to be wary. He didn’t have a great track record with Doms and he didn’t know if their level of trust was strong enough, so when there was no response, he added a sharp, “Now, pet!” He didn’t want to call him boy. He would if he had to, but Sherlock nodded.
Sherlock was nearly convinced the plug John was forcing into him was glass it was that cold, but when it didn't reach his prostate, and just sat there, an uncomfortably wide presence, he knew it was the control plug. It had been left in the freezer and a shiver ran through Sherlock originating at his arse.
John wasn't expecting any sort of response and the whispered, "yes, sir," was one hell of a shock. He let his hand fall on his lower back in a comforting gesture before getting back into his position.
The doctor raised an eyebrow. "Oh, I don't think so." He crowded close to Sherlock. "Are you going to run away?" he asked dangerously.
"Yes, sir," Mycroft whispered in response. He wasn't sure how long it would be before he at least tried to get away from the no doubt heavy strikes.
“And judging by your attitude so far, you have been punished before, whether it be more intense than what you have received just now or less.”
“You're being a sod, so either you cooperate and I'll put you in subspace, or I'll punish you and then put you in subspace.”
The DI snorted. “A) it's not my wedding. B) why would I want her there?” He looked around at the others who were surprised. "What? I work with her. She's not my best mate."
The sub didn't find it as annoying now as he had a few days ago when John had first forced him to piss with his company.
"Oh, you're throwing your own weight around now, are you?" John smirked as he pushed a finger into his boys hole and wriggled it around. Seeing as his boy was bound up nicely and wouldn't be able to come no matter what, he teased his finger over Sherlock's prostate.
At the mansion, Sherlock got Finn out of the car and carried him in without waking him. He'd known he'd fall asleep. All three of the kids had been asleep within minutes of the journey starting.
The vibrator shifted inside him and he groaned, fighting the cuffs around his feet and hands for a few seconds, as if it would help his situation. He knew what would help, but he couldn't bring himself to cooperate… how humiliating!
The Superintendent groaned, dropping his head forward. "Yes, sir." He should have known John would tease him like this.
Even as Mycroft tried to shake his head, the Superintendent spoke again, "It is my job as a Dom to remind you about your safe word. You know that as well as I do, so don't roll your eyes at me!"
Deciding not to waste anymore time trying to see if pleasure was a way of calming the detective, John pressed in a third finger. He didn’t spend much longer working it in.
The Dominatrix already had him stripped and hanging by his wrists. Try as he might, Sherlock couldn't keep himself from reacting. It was always the same, the brother's were one another's weakest point.
“Then at least sit back on your heels, pet.” He worded it like an order, but his tone was soft. He needed Sherlock to be more comfortable now, it was time to wind down and relax.
Irene lifted the cane high overheard with the intent to bring it down on Sherlock hard, but one of the guards grasped it and took it from her. "Eurus said you weren't to damage them."
"Oh stop it," John pushed him back down to his knees, face down into the chair. He tied the leash attached to Sherlock's collar to the buckle on the seat.
As Sherlock cleaned, he considered his next steps. He needed to see the location that he had found. He just didn't know when he would get a chance. The building the coordinates led to was odd. It couldn't possibly be a coincidence that it led to one of the most known buildings in London.
He knew he couldn’t trust Sherlock with such a hard dick right now so he fetched some ice. “This will be cold. I’m going to cage you for 24 hours. Go back to being the good sub I know you can be and I shall remove it.”
Greg wandered in behind him, barely awake and yawning. He breathed in the smell of the coffee brewing and perked up a bit. "You never make coffee."
"Now!" She screamed, her voice managing to shake. Even gone from the room, Eurus scared her to no end.
"Yes, sir. I am." And the thought of it made him shiver. His shiver was made worse when he felt the pressure lift around his bollocks and the sound slide free from inside his length.
"I'll see you soon, Finn," the government official assured the little boy. He moved in and took him from Sherlock’s arms so he could hug him properly.
There were two Saint Andrew's crosses standing in opposite corners of the cell. When Sherlock saw them, he swore.
He forced his two fingers in, ignoring Sherlock's whimpers. The way he was trussed up, Sherlock couldn't move or fight the Dom's fingers. He was forced to submit.
So it was a she… that was different. It wasn't uncommon for women to be Dominant, it was just the first he had heard of John knowing a female Dom. It was fairly obvious really and he shouldn't have been that surprised.
Sherlock’s eyes widened in horror as he glanced between his Dom and his brother... he had made a massive fuss out of nothing. And got in trouble at the same time.
“You’re not the first Dom to have me at their beck and call,” Sherlock spat, his voice was full of hatred and his hands had closed tightly into white-knuckled fists.
Sherlock smiled softly. He'd done the right thing. For the moment at least, he could relax. Even Greg seemed to be amused by his answer.
John returned with the humbler and flicked the machine off. "Don't worry, brat, it won't be off for long."
“Including having you tied to the punishment bench for the next 3 hours,” came a terrifyingly familiar voice from behind him.
“Your brother said you were a cheeky brat.” The eight words were said almost… fondly? No, that couldn’t be right. “He said that you hate to be dominated. Pretty shit trait in a submissive.”
Mycroft scrambled across the room, ignoring the shallow whimpering coming from Sherlock. He threw himself over the bench and waited to see what would happen next.
“Here we go then. You can play it here for me so I can listen or you can go back to your room, nowhere else though, pet, ok?”
Sherlock tried bouncing him, but Finn only held on tighter. The detective lay the little boy across his lap and started tickling him.
John waited nearly 10 mins of Sherlock sucking his fingers before it was clear the boy was getting bored. He reached around the sub and pulled the rope he had attached to the hook up over his shoulder, making him jerk as he realised exactly what the hook was for instead of a usual plug.
Greg swallowed awkwardly and shrugged just as John pumped the fleshlight, twice, hard. He inhaled in sharply as his hips started thrusting up seemingly of their own volition. "Jesus, John!"
John gave him a moment to reflect, then cupped the back of his head in his hand. “Tell me the plan then?”
It was easy enough to deduce who had fired the shot. John really had saved his life. But he would not tell him that.
“You trusted me to uncuff you and nothing else. Would you be willing to trust me if I gave you my word that your choice of rewards, whatever they may be will not be withheld from you if you have earned them?”
Sherlock raised his eyes high enough so he could see the other sub. She knelt in a position beside Irene almost proud, but terrified.
Sherlock dropped to his knees, and bowed his head submissively. Stay calm, make John happy. It couldn't be that difficult, he'd done it before.
Greg squeezed his boy's arm. "I don't know what you should say either, but he's your brother. It will come to you."
“When you ran off after that case in the skip yesterday,” he paused because his boy looked up at him guiltily, “I realised I couldn’t just activate the cuffs and lock you wherever you were so I set up your gps.”
That caused a mischievous look to come into the little boy’s eyes and he looked at John who winked at him. They would have to team up if they stood any chance at beating either of the Holmes’ towers.
John kissed his wrist when he was done and tried for several seconds to catch his sub’s eye. Once he had finally managed it, he kissed his forehead, “If there is any additional pain you must tell me, pet.”
He could see the internal war occurring inside his sub like it was a map laid out in front of him. He decided to make it a bit easier by gently tugging, this time Sherlock didn’t fight and slowly moved his head over onto John’s lap.
“Shh,” John put his finger to his sub’s lips. “Don’t speak. Focus on your breathing. Come on, in and out. You know how this goes by now.”
“You know I will allow you out to crime scenes, I have no intention of locking you up here.” John turned his sub’s head so he could see his face. “You knew that, didn’t you?”
Sherlock let himself be moved about willingly, not resisting in the least. He wanted to bury his face in John's belly, but wanted to show that he could obey more.
John ran his free hand through Sherlock’s curls. “The only way you could disappoint me is if you deliberately broke one of the rules. For now, you’ve got a bit of leeway. I’m aware that you haven’t had a Dom for a while, let alone in public, I’m not going to be as strict as I have been recently. Oh, my gorgeous boy.” He pulled him to his feet by his scarf and held him tight for a moment. “You okay now?”
Irene joined tge discussion, "And I intend to see that you gentlemen make up for your last visit. I don't like it when one of my friends is upset."
The Superintendent casually reached over and grasped Mycroft's cock, giving it a squeeze. "I plan on making use of that later."
Sherlock was clearly still in one of those moods because he thrashed and pulled and made it as difficult as possible for all three of them.
"See, pet. Even your brother can see it." John turned Sherlock around so they were facing one another. "Are we alright? Can we be?"
“You weren’t wrong for asking after him, Sherlock.” The Dom reached out and rested his hand on his shoulder in what he hoped would be perceived as a comforting gesture by the younger man.
"I don't want to gag you, pet, but I will if I have to. Remain respectful and keep your mouth shut unless I've given you permission to speak."
John grabbed a handful of curls and forced his sub's head back, making his back and neck arch beautifully. "Go ahead, Greg. I'll hold him whilst you do your work."
Mycroft lifted Greg's hand and held it. He played with his fingers and knuckles, massaging them. "Are you going to tell me where we're going yet?"
"I'm sorry, sir," Mycroft told his Dom. The truth was, he wasn't opposed to going back to strict and rough either. Not now that he'd thought about it. He grinned, looked Greg in the eyes and said, "Did we ask for a break, sir?"
Greg stepped forward and waved his shoe under Sherlock’s curls. His head snapped up and he winked guiltily, “He won’t be long, Greg, I’m sure.”
John slapped the crop down, hard on the table. He had taken to carrying it around with him in the house. It was easier to catch Sherlock's misdeeds when he carried it and it was quicker to grab his attention. The snap of the crop made the detective jerk in surprise and then groan as he shifted the dildo inside him.
John grabbed a handful of dark curls and pulled his sub up so that he was forced to kneel. Sherlock's eyes immediately went to the cock cage. "Sir, no! I don't deserve that!"
He clambered up onto the chair next to the doctor, “It’s alright, pet, you can lean against me, I won’t bite.” He softly ran his hand through the boy’s curls.
"Sherlock, what is your problem? We came out here because we all needed a break and yet you're being as bad, if not worse, than normal."
It was clear that if they kept Sherlock focused on Finn, he would be able to face the day better. Unfortunately, he would soon be sequestered away as a witness and that distraction wouldn't last.
"Still in a funny mood? I thought of letting you down so you could join us." He walked over and ruffled his hair, then pushed him.
Sherlock looked around the room and could immediately tell Mycroft had been there just before, reading the document on the edge of the DI's desk at a guess.
“My number is on a website I started at university. It was a while ago, but I didn't want it to be recognised, sir.”
"Well, you've seen them all. We haven't used the wet room yet though. Holmes on your feet," Greg ordered his kneeling sub.
The following morning when Sherlock awoke, he wasn’t cold, which he was quite surprised to find, but he was groggy. Usually John woke him up and they sat and drank tea before going downstairs. He could kneel with his head against the Dom’s leg and be fed toast and fruit. His gaze settled on the tray beside him, on it, a glass of water, a bowl of fruit and two slices of toast. Sherlock sniffed back a sob.
"We're going to play in a moment, but I want you completely calm before we start, is that understood?"
Sherlock nodded and pushed himself to his feet, he saw John trying to do the same and he held his hand out. The Dom smiled his thanks, rather proud of him, he was sure this was a different side of Sherlock from the DI’s point of view.
He stopped his thrashing and growled loudly. It was a good thing for Irene that he couldn't get free.
“Tonight will be different, alright. To get you used to being penetrated in a pleasurable way, you will more than likely be stimulated and if you behave you can get off as much as you want.”
"After?" Mycroft prompted, garnering a warning glare from Greg, but the government official didn't back down, it was clear he wanted answers.
"It's not Irene Adler that's the issue, Mycroft. I don't even try to misbehave and I still make things difficult for John."
"I said no more using that leg, pet. I know what the rule is, I'm removing it until further notice. Get yourself dressed."
“Mrs. Hudson?” Sherlock frowned in confusion. He held the suitcase rather awkwardly now he was with someone he knew.
Mycroft laughed slightly, clearly the younger sub knew he'd get a ride, as they'd left the crutches downstairs.
“Found by whom?” Sherlock snorted. “Donovan? She's setting me up, Lestrade, you blind idiot. How can-”
I know it's been absolutely forever since my last update but I started a new business in January and it just flew away from me but I promise I WILL finish this fic... One day 😂
"You're aware of the change of rules. You're aware that that was not an appropriate way to talk to me even before you ran off so certainly not now. Up and over my lap. If I have to force you it will be 5. And I will force you."
“He wants a good me,” Sherlock responded. “A good old me. I can be one or the other. Not both. And that one made John want to leave. That can’t happen, Mycroft.” He ducked his head as John appeared.
"Alright." Greg couldn’t help but reflect on how much Sherlock had changed from the sharp tongued youth he had first met. It was a change for the better.
"No. I'd better go get him. He needs to know I wasn't angry with him and I wasn't going to hurt him." John hated how fragile Finn could be at times. Certain aspects had come on in leaps and bounds, it would be a long time before the everyday things were easy.
Sherlock couldn't suppress the whine that built up in his throat. The pressure and the burning inside him had built to an incredible level.
Sherlock realised then that he must have been good. That was the second time John had called him pet. The more he was called pet, the better.
The Dominatrix rolled her eyes. "It looks like we're going to have to do something about the Ice Man, though that name obviously doesn't fit him anymore. Look how much he cares about his little brother."
Grabbing him by the curls, John shook his boy's head. "You are unfucking believable. You stood there, disobeying me whilst saying you would behave. Where's the sense in that?" He threw his boy sideways to the floor.
“Because you need your own space.” John wasn’t surprised that this question had come from the sub. It always did, but the thing that did surprise him was the fact that Sherlock of all people had wanted his company at night earlier than many of the other subs he had ever trained. “Subs always need their own space when getting used to a new Dom. I’m not going to force you to sleep with me, hence your own room from day one.”
Sherlock actually laughed at that, it hadn’t been the answer he was expecting, not from some seemingly uptight professional Dom.
Sherlock chased the cup as it was withdrawn from his lips. "John! No fair." He stamped his feet in a frenzy. "I'm thirsty."
Mycroft made the mistake of searching out his brother's eye. As soon as he had it, he couldn't help himself, he burst out laughing.
John stared at him for a moment. "Sherlock, nothing drastic has happened in the last few days, in the last few weeks even. If your head not being in the right place right now is your excuse for being such an arse then that is more of a reason for me leaving."
Sherlock glanced at the older man, almost asking for silent permission. At John's slight incline of the head he took off down a side street more than aware that John would be following.
John didn't seem to care, in fact, he seemed to find it amusing. "You deserve this, boy," the blond pointed out. "So don't look at me like that."
Irene frowned, watching, and knew immediately what the brothers' game was. She thought it best not to dispute it. "Get up," Eurus ordered.
Sherlock glanced up and caught his Dom’s eye. The look clearly said he’d be there a while. The sub had already angered the older man enough that morning. He had been trying to get a rise out of the older man. He wouldn’t say he’d got it, but he knew to mess up now might have drastic consequences for his arse later.
“Alright you,” Sherlock said getting to his feet and scooping the boy up before a full scale temper tantrum filled the flat.
"I knew it had something to do with you, you clever girl," Irene said with a smile. "Now about Mycroft." She walked over to the trunk and looked into it.
“Aren’t you meant to start the tally, sir?” The doctor laughed and buried his head in Sherlock’s back for a moment before coming up for air.
John settled down on the sofa, kicked his feet up onto the coffee table and flicked the TV on. After a few minutes, Greg came in, followed by the older sub, a tray of mugs in his hand.
