‘So circumstantial evidence shows us the man at the time and place of the murder? On what grounds? The tools? And you have them there?’
Then one morning, perhaps eight weeks after the event, there came an enigmatic note slipped into our letter box. 'Dear me, Mr. Holmes. Dear me!' said this singular epistle. There was neither superscription nor signature. Watson laughed at the quaint message; but sobered when he saw my face.
‘I wish you would not do this.’ Watson frowned. ‘Holmes, my dear fellow, you have thought of, spoken of, nothing but this business since we returned from Edinburgh a month ago. It is truly an
I was grateful for the shelter of our box, for my tears, weak and low as I was then, flowed freely under the stimulus of the music, and could not be restrained. Watson was also affected: his hand crushed mine mercilessly during the duet
He did not answer me directly, but looked down, and then away through the window, before speaking. ‘Before we address that issue, I wish to - perhaps we could take a little detour, if you will allow me. You and I have spoken, Mr Holmes, about Mr Worth. You investigated him under his alias in Antwerp, did you not?’
‘I do. I – I have much diminished my usage, I assure you, since reading it. I was never in the habit of taking more than twelve to sixteen grains in the twenty-four hours, so I do not believe it was so bad, but . . .’
The wine – six bottles of it, half the case - had duly arrived, along with a pair of ducks, (much to Mrs Hudson’s chagrin, for like all good housekeepers she prided herself on her ability to choose her meat herself), a bottle of an exceptionally fine Napoleon cognac, half a barrel of oysters and a dozen of Chablis. My brother was a generous man when he chose, and I was, reluctantly, forced to own myself touched.
His financial affairs were in a tangle. His blackmail clearly profited him as a business, and despite the suspicions of the hotelier who had handed him into police for running up a six hundred pound bill that he appeared not to be able to pay, he was not without means. I wondered, however, if he were not a victim of blackmail himself: certain regular withdrawals of the same amount monthly looked rather like some sort of fee to be let alone. The case disposed of for the time being (although I retained all the financial papers, and determined to examine into them further) and arrangements made for us to attend the trial on the seventh as observers, we amused ourselves in Vienna.
‘An interesting hypothesis, but not scientific, especially about the navel,’ I told him, and felt him quiver with laughter. His hand caressed my ankle, patted it. ‘Well, it is not, John, is it?’
'Yes. He - he thinks he knows, John. He said to me at the door, that the law punishes felons. And more besides. He spoke of – of Stevenson’s book: all who read are aware now, of its hidden meaning. He spoke of double lives.’
‘Turn to me, look up, look at me, my dear fellow. It was never my intent to hurt you with the comparison, it was only a little jest. In the first place, do not feel so ashamed of needing comfort that night. Your story hurt me in the hearing as it hurt you in the telling: I am not ashamed to say that after you fell asleep, I wept for the lonely child you were.  And I am trying to make light of your situation in the morning so that you see there is no cause to be distressed. I thought nothing of it, truly, indeed you must have seen, so close as we were, that I was in similar case myself. It is normal, as I have told you before, for men to wake so. I passed a comfortable night by your side as you have done by mine many a time before, I was warm, and I did not suffer from evil dreams, and should you need comfort again, it will be my honour and privilege to offer it. Nay more, it will be my joy that I may give something back to you. So there is no more to be said.’
‘After six, my dear chap: have you been sitting there musing all afternoon? I thought you were going to visit Lestrade at the Yard, or did you forget?’
The Valley of Fear is the only book other than The Final Problem that features Professor Moriarty. It falls out quite well that in my universe, Moriarty is confederated with Worth in crime, and Worth is an American, hence making it even more logical that Moriarty should be asked to help to exterminate "Douglas" who is a Pinketon's man. Conan Doyle had a lot of respect for Pinkerton's detective agency: he mentions it several times in Canon.
‘Perhaps you are right and that will help restore me.’ He deposited the glass into the newspaper I held out for it, and went to the bathroom. ‘I do not know what it is with me, Holmes, at the moment. My nerves are all a-stretch, my temper on a hair trigger.’ I heard the water run, then he returned, wiping his hands. ‘I must be the very devil to live with: I do not know how you can bear me in the house, for I can hardly bear myself. I am all fret and fidget and womanish worries.’
An ill-sorted trio of musical themes, I commented to Watson as the stage emptied and the hall began to be filled with the rustle of people leaving: the bargain of a doomed man with his pursuing devil and the punishment of a villain by a ghost, followed by the triumph of wedded affection and faithful love. ‘But you enjoyed the music all the same, my dear fellow?’
‘Why did you not tell me?’ I asked, weakly. It was not that I had not deduced the whole, for I had, although admittedly, I had not realised Trevelyan’s fate would be upon him so swiftly. It was Watson’s heart that amazed me, that he should – I knew he was a compassionate man, but that he was one to go so far out of his way for a stranger, and the stranger a man tainted not just by unnatural vice, but by a disease that would render him loathsome and leprous to many, that, that I had not reckoned with. ‘Why did you not say anything?’
‘I am sorry,’ I said to him later that day – a cold, wet, April day - on his return home, ‘for ejecting you so summarily, but the compound is dangerous if agitated, and poor Dupré’s hands were becoming more tremulous by the moment under the force of your scrutiny. You are most awe-inspiring at times, Watson, are you not? From a gentleman whose manners are generally speaking mild and complaisant, you become a very martinet: no lowly soldier but would jump to do your bidding. Were you thus in the army, my dear fellow? I am glad I was not one of your recruits, if so.’
I did not sleep at all that night. I waited and watched, not stirring from my room until Watson came quietly down, and let himself out. I followed him. As I suspected, he went to Brook Street, and it was to Trevelyan’s house. I saw him enter the house, then after some short time, he left it with Trevelyan, the latter muffled in a greatcoat and scarf. They hailed a cab, and I followed in another. There followed a long drive westward through the city, Watson’s cab twisting through street after street. Eventually we came to a long road of houses, detached and set back from the road. Watson’s cab drew up at one of them, and I told my cabbie to drive past.  A hundred yards further on, I stopped him, asking him to wait until I returned. The man looked oddly at me, so I told him I was on Yard business, and that there would be money in it for him if he kept his mouth shut. I doubled back, silently, down the drive, to where Watson and Trevelyan stood, and listened.
‘You cared for me when I was feverish, crotchety and snappish as a rheumatic old man, gripped with my vile colics and tormented by nightmares. I am not ungrateful. Nor am I a saint: you try me to the utmost of my patience by times. But if I am a martyr, it is a crown I wear gladly, my Damon.’ He kissed me again, a brief press of lip to lip. 'There. If I have caught your cold, you may cherish me, or we may cherish each other as much as is needed. It is the height of foolishness to refuse an offered comfort when it is to be had: the world is harsh after all. Now, I am not your schoolmaster, and you are not my subject. We are equals: is that understood.’
‘No need, they were a gift from a grateful patient. They were freely given, and so it is fitting they should be freely given away. Holmes, my dear man, I would infinitely sooner have your company, wherever it be. And a walk under the moon sounds delightful: I used to walk often by moonlight in the army, or to lie out, when I could, and contemplate the stars. So big and bright as they were in the still air, and that sky so velvet-black: it was a magnificent show. I would I could show you what like it was here, to feel so small, so insignificant under that immense sky, and yet to be able to name them in their myriads.’ He sighed. ‘Ah, Mrs Hudson, would it inconvenience you to send Janey to the Lestrades this evening? I have tickets for the new show at the Savoy, and wish to give them a treat. I thought Janey might sit with her brother there, and mind the children while they attend the operetta. And Mr Holmes and I are walking tonight, so perhaps just a sandwich or two for dinner?’
What followed next – our desperate fear that it was Sir Henry who had been set upon by the hound, our discovery that it was, instead, the convict Selden who has been run to his death by the beast, our encounter with Stapleton, his disappointment that he had not succeeded in his plan, and my manipulation of the events of the next few days to trap him, again, has been better told by Watson. It was extremely regrettable that the fog, impeding our plans, made it also impossible for us to prevent the terrible spectacle of that fiery hound, the distress and exhaustion of the event, and the deep and cutting blow that was Sir Henry’s discovery that Beryl Stapleton was the wife, and not the sister of his would-be murderer, from plunging the unfortunate baronet into an illness which, despite all Dr Mortimer, and Dr Watson could do, appeared to one point to be leading to a fatal termination. It was a wan, low, trembling wraith of a man, much reduced from his former hearty self, who set off on the voyage to far-off lands, where haply he might forget his sorrows and heal his bruised heart. I did not think he would ever love again, poor Sir Henry: his was one of those hearts which, once thoroughly impressed with the image of the beloved, retains the impression until their death. I felt sorry for the poor fellow, knowing myself to be in like case . . . and it gave me much to consider.
‘That is a decent man,’ I remarked to Watson, when he returned to our rooms after showing our visitor to the door. ‘An honest merchant, perhaps.’
‘As a widow,’ she went on, ‘I might be expected to have some of my deceased husband’s clothing remaining in my possession. Had I such garments, among them might be a . . .’
‘The beryls, Watson, the beautiful beryls belonging to a family so noble that our breathless Mr Holder, awash in sycophancy, hardly dared mention the name of their owner – those beryls that were lent as security for a cool fifty thousand, those very beryls in the coronet that we saw mutilated – those thirty-nine flashing, sparkling beryls with the emerald depths of cool and verdant forests in them -  ’
I rose, and took out my handkerchief, stepped into the bathroom and soaked it in my cologne, went back and gave it to him.
‘But it did not, Holmes, for you solved it. All is safe, and you have had thanks and praise a-plenty. I am so happy for your success, my dear.’
Watson and I were companionable together. We were always good companions. He bore so gently with my whims and fancies, as I bore with his occasional growls, when a sharper wind than usual set him limping. For the sake of prudence, and because, being strangers to the country, there was nowhere we were not remarked, we did not share a bed on our travels, save for two nights in the Cairngorms, where we lay together in a bothy on straw covered with our coats, a rough blanket over us, and our knapsacks for our pillows. We were fully clad, for it was a wet evening, but Watson drew me to him at once as we blew out the candle, and I was fain to lie close with him. His arms encircled me; my head rested on his shoulder. I do not believe we slept much that night or the next, only his fevered lips were pressed repeatedly to my flushed brow and cheek, and my hand lay over his heart to feel its flurried beating. If he burned as I did beneath my buttoned-up clothing, or took himself hastily in hand for relief as I had had to do after we parted in the morning to our separate cold ablutions, we neither of us spoke of it. What words we did murmur to each other under those two starless, moonless nights, I treasured beyond all else. I had never thought to find myself so cherished.
All information about the trials after the Phoenix Park murders and the Dynamite Conspiracy, are from the London Evening Standard and the court records of the Old Bailey. Richard Price's conduct, without which the conspiracy might not have come to light, was commended by the Old Bailey judge.
‘My throat hurts, I confess.' I contemplated my pipe, but that same sore throat made me suddenly unwilling to essay it. ‘Tell Mrs Forrester you have a rare, painless, periodically recurring and highly contagious disease that necessitates medical treatment in splendid isolation, and that you have been forbidden society, which only exhausts you and exacerbates your condition.’
‘Well, I have been kindly disposed towards him since hearing of him - and latterly, of course, we have had some slight correspondence - and upon acquaintance like him very much, as I do Melas. I would be glad to know more of them both.’ He paused. ‘They do not live together then? Not share rooms?’
Soon after came Christmas, our first together as room mates. Mrs Hudson had asked my permission to decorate our rooms. I could not see why she would want to, but gave it nevertheless, ‘Only that you do not disturb my decomposition experiment, Mrs Hudson, for a man’s life may depend upon it.’
.’ I gave him back his quote. ‘Come and lie down in my room, my dearest John; the stairs will be too much for you with that strain you have put on yourself. Tonight, I shall heat a towel at the fire, you may wrap your leg with it for comfort, and we will rest it with pillows so there is no pull on it. When you have slept, we will take counsel, and decide on our campaign. And tomorrow we will go to the Turkish Bath, that you may be supple once more, and at ease. And we shall – we shall, I promise you, live to fight many days yet.’
‘It is true: we have clear evidence that Moran, that Milverton and Worth are in some ways connected. I understand that, as you see it, Moriarty is their genius, and it is with his advice and direction that they think and plan. It is only – he is unassailable, surely, Holmes? What evidence can there be, that you hope to find by this visit?’
Private business. Was that indeed what he was about? My shock - it was, it must be an assignation – must have been visible, and also legible, for he coloured, a deep flush pinking his cheeks and ears. “Holmes! On this day of all others: how can you think it? Do I seem to you the sort of man who is so – so incontinent in his needs? What cause have I ever given you to think - ?”
"I cannot wait for you to announce me: I must see the doctor at once.'' Gregson was almost at our door, and by the sound of it, he was not alone:  two men accompanied him, heavier built than he was, shod in boots. Constables then. Better to pre-empt them. I left my bench and set the door wide open, affecting a bonhomie I was far from feeling.
So engaged was he in the subject they had been discussing - it was always easy to engage his interest when there was a question of the welfare of children, my dear, tender-hearted John - that I had almost expected him to continue the conversation he had had with Miss Morstan and Mrs Forrester as we took our cab home, but no sooner had the doors closed upon us that he turned to me.
‘Why are you leaving me, Watson? What has happened; where are you going?’ I could not repress my fear: I had been on tenterhooks since we had returned from Vienna. It was true that he seemed no less fond than before, but I could not forget how I had spoken to him on our last night there, pleading with him to share my bed. It was innocent enough, true: much as I wanted him – desperately as I wanted him - on that occasion I had sought only comfort. And comfort he had given me in tender abundance, until in the morning – but would he regret it, that was the thought that tortured me: would he decide, on sober reflection, and once back in London, that he had first been too complaisant, too caressing, too indulgent of my whims, and then that I was a vile degenerate, to be shunned at all costs? I could not be easy with him: indeed the journey back on the train had been a torment of avoidance. ‘Why have you packed a bag? How long will you be away?’
. . . and oh, but he was beautiful on that morrow, in the glimpses modesty allowed me. Too scarred for some, although to me each cicatrice wrote his history, too thin, too wasted, but a finely made man, compact and neat. His skin flushed deep rose under the
William Holmes, an ornithologist, did, in fact write ‘Sketches on the Shores of the Caspian’ at an appropriate length of time before this takes place for him to be our Holmes’ uncle.
So we wore out the year preparing for that work, and then it was Christmas again, the second of our fraternity. I bought Watson a very handsome pocket pistol from Paris: a pretty, deadly thing, with gold-washed fancy-work, and an ebony butt. He gave me the newly published sheet music for Sarasate’s Carmen Fantasy Suite, and a dressing gown. My mouse-coloured cashmere was shabby and torn, splotched with dye and stained with chemicals. He offered me its exact like, telling me that I should keep it to change into when clients arrived, and save the old one for experiments, and I smiled to think that my correct and proper doctor had been so far lured from
‘He had periods of lucidity, and then his torments were great, for he remembered what he had done and said, and what he was. It was a terrible end, Holmes. I am glad that you have never seen such. And the worst of it is how people treat the afflicted. It cannot be caught even from kissing, or from a cup, yet people shun those with the disease as if they were lepers. Or worse than lepers. Man is cruel to man.’
We had, therefore, passed two very satisfactory days engaged in our respective interests and so decided to take in some of the sights of Vienna and its surroundings before returning to Paris on the
'Slaughter!' He grimaced again, seeming to observe his entire disarray for the first time. 'Yes, there was slaughterman's work last night. You are right, forgive me, Holmes; I am in no fit case to sit at table. But let me at least have some coffee here by the fire or I shall sleep where I stand. Then I shall bathe, and we will go to it.'
'I am happy to be of service in any way I can,' I told her. 'But I imagine it is about Mr Wood you wish to speak to me.'
'I do not care how urgent it is, Inspector Gregson: I cannot have you entering my gentlemen's rooms unannounced. Please state your business, and allow me to determine whether Dr Watson is able to receive you at present.'
He did not sleep. I counted the hours, lying awake myself, moderating my breathing that he might think me sleeping, and not watching over him. He turned and turned in the bunk, shuffled like a dog dreaming, and at one point got out with a muttered curse to re-spread the sheets and blankets his restless feet had kicked into knots. I heard him sigh, and cross to the window where the faint light of the waning moon limned him against the glass as he looked out. He stood there for a long time, head bowed. I saw his shoulders hitch, and heard the halting breathing. When he turned round, the light silvered tears on his face. He lay awake after that until morning, as we completed our journey, and drew into the station; as the engine hissed and groaned its way into silence; as night deepened, then paled; as rosy dawn broke over Vienna. But whatever demon dogged him, drew deep, heartbroken sighs from his breast, wrung stifled whimpers from a locked throat – whatever his pain, when he greeted me in the morning it was as gently and cheerfully if he had slept like a babe in arms and not lain awake all night, nursing some mysterious grief.
‘I did not want to distress you,’ I told him. ‘And you were distant with me after you had told me about your childhood. I felt that it had raised ghosts for you that you regretted raising, and that by not bringing them sharp to your mind with our cases, I might lay them again. And the answer to the question that you asked me, and I did not answer – whether you dwelt too much on those events, or whether you should be more angry about them – is that what happened to you was terrible in so many ways I cannot begin to count them, and that if you are angry about it, it is no wonder. I have never told you anything of my childhood, and may never do so, for I also have things on which I do not care to dwell - but it was not terrible as yours was, Watson.’
‘It’s a strange thing, Mr Holmes,’ he began, ‘that whereas I would normally come to you off my own bat, so to speak, in this instance, I have been directed to involve you in an investigation. And I cannot for the life of me tell exactly whence that direction arises, and why. Or rather, I know why – it is the prettiest little problem in some ways, and just the sort of thing for you – but I do not like to be a mere messenger, see and not to know who is properly in the driving seat. It does not suit me at all, to tell you the truth.’
‘I am glad of it.’ I was all at sea in these domesticities, but I wanted to comfort him if I  could. My heart was tender just then for those in pain, being in that state myself. ‘Doctor Watson tells me that P-Polly is going on exceptionally well with the rest, and the nourishment, and that the doctors talk of only six or seven months more, before she may go to the convalescent home in the spring. Perhaps,’ an inspiration struck me, ‘perhaps when she goes, you and your wife might go with her, Lestrade, for a little holiday. Should not you like that?’
The dating of Wisteria Lodge is notoriously problematical: it cannot have taken place on the given date - 1892 - since this is in the middle of the Hiatus. I have therefore placed it where it is convenient for me - although it is often allocated to post-Hiatus, based on the number of previous cases Watson mentions. However, Watson being a totally unreliable narrator who often gets his dates muddled, and mentions things out of chronological order, I felt it better to place it here, just after the Labouchere Amendment, since it is a case with a definite homosexual subtext - not one but TWO m/m couples: Eccles and Garcia, and Murillo and Lopez.
He caught my sleeve. ‘Stay, Holmes. Your highly placed principal who met Lestrade with Adolphus Williams – oh, do not look at me like that, of course he is highly placed or you and Lestrade would not have been put onto this trail – do you think he is involved in this? I have not speculated as to his identity - ’
He broke off, clearing his throat, and I dared a slight pressure on his arm. My heart swelled with words I could not utter, and I stared in fierce, dogged silence at the unoffending ground.
‘I! Why do you place me in Monte Cristo’s position? Am I ever likely to have life or death in my gift? I am no hero, no protagonist of a fine story. If either of us is fitted to be a hero, Watson, it is you.’
‘Of c-course- it – it would be – would h-have to be – the nobler action . . . But, Watson, do you really think that – that men will be deterred from – from r-relations with, with each other - by the Act? It is not so long ago that it carried a death sentence, and yet men were not deterred. Cornwall and French, Kirwan, Malcolm Johnson, John Saul – they were not deterred.’
We did not converse much on the way home from that meeting: I prevented it by pleading headache, and so escaped discourse. The subject of Carpenter came up several times over the next few days, however, and when the promised book arrived, we did, in fact, read it together over the dark December and January evenings. It was, as I had suspected it might be, a passionate, detailed and scholarly exegesis of the phenomenon of Paiderastia in Greek society: the deep and spiritual affection between an older and a younger man. Watson bridled at its title and subject matter: he was no supporter of what he termed ‘the damnable corruption of the innocent,’ and at first was angry that Carpenter had supposed him to be in favour of love between man and child. I persuaded him, however, that neither Carpenter nor Symonds was advocating the vileness that had marred his own young life, and he allowed, somewhat reluctantly, that the situation had been different in Ancient Greece, where adulthood, and the taking of an adult’s part in life came earlier than it did with us, and where the relationship of erastes and eromenos, of lover and beloved, was spiritual, conducing to valour and high ideals, rather than what the Greeks would have termed effeminacy and softness, or even brute desire.
He tapped my cheek. ‘I fear you flatter me with fine words to mask your iron resolve, as one who should humour a child. You offer me a sugar-plum and take away a greater toy. Well, I will not insist in this case: you are the master here. But be careful for God’s sake. It is not just your body, but your reputation that is at stake, and both are very dear to me.’
I began, my nerves a-quiver. His free arm lay along the back of the sofa. I dared to lean into it, and he allowed his hand to rest tenderly on my shoulder, pressed it, and stilled.
‘Anyway,’ he went on, ‘There are many men who are not married, and who cannot seek release with a partner, and who will not use the services of such women as sell release. And for such men, when there is desire that is not relieved by that nocturnal emission of seed which all of us, even you, Holmes, naturally experience, then in that case, to deal with the matter oneself by – by simple manipulation is infinitely the best thing. First and foremost, it is clean, incurring no risk of disease. Then it is honest and pure, for it involves no other person bought and sold, and it is, very importantly, safe, for it gets no woman pregnant, to her ruin. It is, in truth, the best and most practical way of taking care of the situation when as it does in the natural way of things, it occurs – I will not say arises, lest you suspect me of a pun.’
‘I must have a look at that ankle,’ he said and his tone was apologetic. ‘How much walking have you done on it, Holmes?’
We spent a quiet, a very quiet summer. Watson pulled round, slowly, and the advent of better weather and some sun improved his health. The twenty-five guineas he gave straight to me, telling me that it would pay for his share of five more months at Baker Street. In July I renewed our lease for six months, to Mrs Hudson’s unexpected (unexpected to me, in any case) joy, and I returned him five of his guineas. I urged him to trust that he would be able to make the two months rent not yet paid by the time it was needed in the autumn, and represented to him very gently that he might need the rest . . . ‘your boots, my dear fellow, among other necessary expenses. We walk a good deal, do we not? And you are sure of some work through Stamford, not to mention that your stories are in requisition now. Let us be hopeful about our future.’
‘I do not have time to go to the Yard, and I am sure Mrs Hudson will not object if we use the area. The women may cover their ears and squeak if they wish.’
‘A merchant of the name of Julius Wernher. He is, unlike most of the diamond merchants, of Protestant Lutheran stock, but he works at the present time for the Jewish firm of Porgès et Cie. He returned in the spring from the Cape, where he had been at the Kimberley diggings for fifteen months. He tells me that the diamond business has been much depressed of late years, but that just as he had hopes of bringing some order out of chaos, this new company, Wynert, has begun to undersell the established merchants, bringing in rough diamonds through Amsterdam to Antwerp, where they are cut. Of course it was used to be Antwerp, where I go, that was the centre of the trade, but its primacy was usurped in the last century by Amsterdam because most of its principal financiers reside there and have the monopoly.’
, almost an obsession with you. To intrude on the man’s house, to penetrate into his stronghold is to run a tremendous risk: what if he returns unexpectedly; what if he discovers you? There can be no excuse for such behaviour. What of your reputation?’
‘My dear John.’ It was my turn to smile. ‘My dear and stalwart Captain, my honourable Doctor. You may not: I forbid it. Nay, you cannot. You, my dear, could not impersonate a rat-catcher did your life depend on it: you are a man entirely without guile. The fine art of dissimulation was left out of you when you were created. You would endanger me if you were but to set foot over the threshold, for you will never sound other than what you are, an officer and a gentleman.’
I was in this very low state, sore, and desperate and miserable, when he came to me one mid-November morning an hour or so after breakfast with a very serious mien, and that relentlessly gentle air he had when he was, as a doctor, most concerned for his patient. One look was enough to tell me that he meant to have it out with me, and internally I trembled, for I fully believed he would leave me, and I could not trust myself not to fall at his feet and plead my love for him, to my certain undoing.
'It is no matter, my dear. Anyone might react so. But at least in the case of your own involvement, we may take a little comfort from the fact that if life had been extinct for some hours, you could not have been implicated: you were elsewhere, delivering a baby. Ah, yes, the baby! And a girl, you said. What name did they give the little one, John? Was it Joan this time? Jane, perhaps? Janet? Joanna?'
‘Well I would not like it. I am not interested in diplomacy. Nor am I interested in the periodicals – you may use them to light the fire if you do not wish to read them – and I am sick of being stuffed with beef tea and fowl. But music – if he has sent concert tickets, I would like to see what they are. I have not heard good music for two months, and I miss it sorely.’
‘Good morning, Johnson: step into the light for a moment before you answer Mr Holmes, please. Let me look at your face. No, tilt your chin to the left. That is healing very well. You must continue to keep it clean. Forgive me, Holmes, pray continue now.’ Watson stood aside to let both Johnson and myself precede him into the house. ‘Yes, who do you have for us today?’
Alleyne, Hordle John, and Maude are from 'The White Company', a historical novel written by Doyle which he preferred to his Sherlock Holmes stories.
‘Then I admire and honour you more than I can say,’ I murmured. I could not look him in the eye, for fear he might see too much of me. ‘And – and I am sorry I let a transient dislike, an irrational impulse, blind me to doing good. For I aided Trevelyan, yes, but from material motives, and without my heart engaged. That was wrong of me, very wrong, to be so cold. Yet if I engage my heart, how shall I fare when reason only is required for deduction? What am I to do, Watson? Assist me, I beg you.’
. ‘You, I perceive, are in rather more promising case. That very elegant signet ring you wear was not father’s I think.’
Our attendant looked in at one point. He asked in the lowest of tones if I required tea, and I indicated yes, in an hour. He smiled, and went away, giving me a sympathetic glance as he did so – a glance which told me that for once, I, to whom all needs and longings were transparent, was, in my own need, my own heart’s longing, transparent to this simple servitor. As to refreshment, I needed nothing: my thirst was assuaged by every sip of him I took. I bent close: his breath fanned my cheek. A fine dew pearled at his brow: I longed to press reverent lips to it. He shifted, and the displaced linen released air warmed by his body: I passed my hand over the cloth as if to caress. I was in a fever, a delirium, yet so ruthlessly had I suppressed my desire, so much did I hate the thought of desecrating, by one unchaste thought, one hint of pollution, the trust he had placed in me as he lay there abandoned to sleep in my care, that my flesh lay innocent now, and unstirred. It was my heart that swelled, my mind that whirled and dazzled, my thoughts which turned in my brain with exquisite intensity. I was transported: no drug had ever matched this ecstasy . . .
‘I shall sit on the hearthrug, and be damned to my sore knees and back tomorrow,’ he said, resisting my attempts and dropping to the rug at my feet, where he sat half turned from me, so I could not see his face. ‘Here, move your chair closer to the fire, and I can lean against it and be warm. I am so cold, this evening. That is better. Go on then, do your worst. Or your best, whichever it is to be. What can you deduce – what have you deduced already - about my childhood?'
I saw Watson blush– yes, he positively blushed, like a boy at his first dance – while Carpenter continued to regard him with that gentle, encompassing smile. The man fairly radiated warmth, sincerity, openness, and Watson was blossoming in it like a daisy in the sun. His eyes brightened and he began to quiz Carpenter about his own work in Sheffield, (where he was much engaged with educating the working man) and his visit to Walt Whitman. Carpenter, for his part, extolled the virtues of his workers: ‘these rough lads, down to earth, simple of mind and manner, hands calloused with toil, bodies redolent of honest sweat’ in a way that left no doubt in my mind – and, it became clear, no doubt in Watson’s mind either – of his liking for physical, as well as mental communion with these objects of his approbation. Upon Ellis re-joining the pair of them, the conversation became more medical, and I became painfully, bitterly aware, while trying to sustain a discussion of Russia’s history with Tchaikovsky – who was not, I was saddened to learn, related to the composer whose works I enjoyed so much – that their subject was inversion.
‘Indeed it was, to spite a man she hated, and whom she felt had wronged her. I fear I cannot. Esther Pay, or someone like her, was seen with the child at a public house near the station, at the right time. She, or someone in her image, was seen with a child about a quarter past four in the afternoon, on the day we surmise the murder took place, going towards Judd's Corner. Someone on the road to that damned river saw her, or a shape like her, with a child of Georgina Moore’s age. At another public-house on the road to Yalding, a woman resembling her was seen by the landlady and by a man in the house, and two other men saw a woman and child leaving the house and going towards Yalding. But not one of them, Watson, was able to identify the prisoner as the woman they had seen. They have all ‘not been sure’ or have been ‘unable to be certain’. Oh, it terrifies me to think that crime can go so unremarked. But as I have often mentioned to you, my dear fellow, people see, but they do not observe. Of circumstantial evidence, we have
‘I concur entirely, my dear Watson. You could not have chosen a day’s programme more congenial to me. So tomorrow is fixed.  Shall we continue this evening with Dumas? We approach its conclusion, you know.’
‘I – I,’ I stammered. ‘I am, ah – glad of your company, too, Watson. And it was an excellent thought about the children. Perhaps I shall ask Mrs Hudson to provide some comforts for my Irregulars, what think you of that? Let us - ’ Yes, I knew then what I could say. ‘Let us enact the ghost of Christmas Present from the tale you told me, and spread some happiness, if it pleases you to do so. We have been fortunate of late: let us, as you say, give joy to others.
‘It does not suit me either, Lestrade, as you must know if you know me at all, man. I am no puppet to be moved at any man’s whim. Pray, what is the problem, and what am I requested to do? For I tell you now that with such a beginning I will have nothing to do with it, if I like it not.’
‘I am almost sorry the plant is too tender for our climate; else it might with advantage be grown here so that we should have our own supply of the drug,’ he replied. ‘Holmes, the gutter there is overflowing, change sides with me, or you will be muddied and wet. My boots are stouter than yours. There, my dear man, that is better for you. Now take my arm again, and let us be comfortable. Alas, as it is, the price of the purified alkaloid is prohibitive to all but the rich, I regret to say.’
He affixed the card (it was the seven of hearts) to the wall, loaded his Webley, and took aim. He shot out five of the hearts down each side of the card with the revolver, then loaded and re-loaded the pistol, and shot out the remaining two pips. He was deadly accurate – the holes might have been drilled by a machine
‘Then it may depend upon it out of doors for the festive season,’ she told me. ‘If it is flesh you have decomposing, Mr Holmes, it is not doing so in here. The mutton chop you disposed of under the sofa was bad enough.’
‘If you write this case up, you must conceal the dates and obscure the names,’ I warned Watson. We had returned home, after the astounding denouement of the case; the escape of ‘Mr Henderson’ and his devoted secretary, ‘Mr Lucas’: the aliases of Don Juan Murillo, the ‘Tiger of San Pedro’ and Lopez, his devoted – friend;  and the dramatic, drugged, escape of ‘Miss Burnet,’ alias Signora Victor Durando, widow of Murillo’s murdered ambassador, and aide to Garcia’s group of conspirators. Garcia, who had been surprised and murdered on his way to the assassination of Murillo would, Signora Durando had sworn to us, be revenged; there were many in waiting whose aim it was to murder the deposed dictator and his secretary, hunting them out wherever they might find them.
I did not tell Ross this immediately, of course. He distrusted me, it was clear: there was something about me that spoke to him of the mountebank and charlatan. I did not choose to be seen as such, and so I made my excuses and returned, after a charming breath of the beautiful Dartmoor air, to London, after advising him to send in his jockey, and by no means to withdraw the horse from the race since he would certainly run. It amused me that he would have to wait for his denouement: Watson had mentioned the fact that he had expressed dissatisfaction with the “London consultant” and so I persisted in putting him off despite his dour looks, until I could pull off the revelation with the éclat I desired.
Watson poured brandy and soda, and then took notes, as he always did, while Eccles told his sorry tale of the queer household he had, in his turn, been invited to visit; how the house had been unexpectedly gloomy, the servants unexpectedly morose, the dinner unexpectedly poor, and the host unexpectedly distrait. (I was certain, however, that he omitted at least part of the tale: that which took place between dinner and the two men retiring at eleven.) Then he told of the waking at one, his host asking if he had called him, his returning to sleep and waking again, to find the house deserted, of his trip back to Charing Cross and visit to the Spanish Embassy to seek news of Garcia there, and of his discovery that the friend at whose house he had met this obliging young man to whom he had taken so great a fancy knew no more of him than Eccles himself (And perhaps rather less, I thought to myself.) Setting aside all thought of any personal encounter that had taken place between the two men, it seemed to me that the case might well be described as grotesque and fantastic, the more so since the young man, Garcia, had been found not a mile from the house on Oxshott Common with his head broken, having first made a point of waking Eccles to tell him that it was one in the morning before leaving the house to go to his death.
'Take a pinch of snuff; I filled the box on a whim, but I am no Regency dandy to be making a show of taking it. Yes, retire. Do you think that we can live this life for ever? At the moment, we must bend our energies to dealing with the present threat. But afterwards . . . at some point, I must retire, certainly. You also, I think?'
‘Not so.’ Lestrade looked triumphant. ‘Only this this year, he was sentenced for burglary, and is now in Coldbath prison, so we have him again, and I thought to clear up the murder, for it is yet unsolved. Of late I have been speaking to some men who are prepared to implicate him, but that is all hearsay, and will not stand up in court, even though he has as good as admitted it to one of them. I need one piece of evidence, Mr Holmes, just one. There were tools at the scene of the crime – chisels, and such like, for the burglary, and we have one of them which could even be said to have the word ‘rock’ on it, which is near enough the man’s name. Yet it is not exactly his name, and we cannot hang a man on an unsafe conviction even though he be a villain who shot a man unarmed and doing his duty.’
‘I shall be taking luncheon with Lestrade: and in court all afternoon: we should go at six. I could ask Mrs Hudson to provide a cold collation here for afterwards, with perhaps some soup to reheat. Will that suit you?’
‘Indeed, Watson, there should not be. But those in power – is it not said that power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely – have many secrets, as witness the prevalence of blackmail. It is not surprising they wish to protect themselves. Tell me this, my dear fellow, if you will let us leave politics for a moment. Our term of leisure here draws to its close: is there anything we have not done that you wish to do? We must leave on Monday.’
‘I dare not strip to my shirt,’ I protested, but I had shed my outer clothing already, and my hands were on my tie, loosening it. My blood was up: my heart racing.
It was gratifying to see that I was right, and even more gratifying to see Lestrade’s awed face when I showed him, under the most powerful magnification my apparatus could reach, the darkly lined O-R-R-O-C-K that proved the man’s ownership of the instrument. He thanked me profusely, and after some further suggestions for how he could secure a conviction, I sent him away with renewed purpose to prosecute his case. My elation after he had left was short lived, however, for I still had to wrestle with my earlier comments to Watson. They could not be solved by using a microscope.
‘I take it the doctor is not in a good humour,’ she said, observing me narrowly. ‘I am not surprised, Mr Holmes, when he comes home wet and cold and tired after a hard day’s work to such a pickle as this. You had best tidy up a little – more than a little, perhaps. There really is no excuse for it: if it is still the paper you are testing,’ – for she was well aware by now of the extent of my experimental work – ‘you had much better rig up a line across the room and peg the papers on it to dry, rather than letting them lie all about, haphazard in heaps, and getting crumpled. It is what any woman would do after all, that has ever run a house. But there, you’ve never done washing, so you couldn’t be expected to know. Pour Dr Watson a sherry, take it up to him, and tell him the room will be to rights in ten minutes, a good fire blazing, and there will be a roasted partridge with bread sauce for his supper, and syllabub after.’
‘You were rendered unconscious by a knock on that same intransigent head, you foolish man,’ he told me, but his tone was gentle, and the word ‘foolish’ almost a caress. ‘I begged you to be still, but you have insisted on conversing. How do you expect to feel, pray? Yes, it will pass off, over the next days and weeks. Drink your willowbark tea – that is all I can allow you - and close your eyes. You will feel very much better in the morning.’
The following morning saw me in a quandary. I wanted to speak to Watson of what I had overheard – for I had deduced now the whole sorry story – but I could not without betraying my dishonourable dealings. That they were dishonourable, I saw clearly now, the fog of jealousy having lifted. I had been driven by my own demons to spy on my friend, a thing unthinkably base and vile. Yet I had been rewarded, not punished, as I should have been, and that most richly. For as well as having my mind set at rest over Trevelyan – who clearly was no more than his patient – I had heard enough to understand that Watson valued me, not in the same way as I valued him, it is true, but value me he did. I was, if not dear to him in any romantic sense, dear to him as a younger brother is dear. It was more than my deserts: I should be thankful, therefore.
He sat beside me on the sofa and took me into his arms. ‘This is not just the nervous exhaustion from the work you have done; it is the black sadness after the exhilaration of cocaine, and the physical sequelae of taking the drug. These things have combined, I am afraid, hence this deep depression of your spirits, and your bodily discomfort.’
‘Holmes, if we are to watch the storm together, go instantly to your room and put on socks and slippers. And smalls would not come amiss either. The air is chill near the window, and I doubt either of us will be sleeping for a while. This is a truly majestic spectacle,’ he went on, gesturing at the scene outside. “I have rarely seen one as tremendous, not even in the hill country in India.’
‘A little,’ I owned. ‘Forgive me, Watson: it must be tedious for you to live with a fellow who is forever either up in the attics or down in the cellar. I did warn you, however, that I was subject to moods during which I no longer wished to speak. I fear one is approaching me now: a reaction, no doubt, to our busy spring followed by a dearth of stimulation. I feel myself slowly sinking, I must confess. At such times the – the temptation is to resort to anything – I hate the desolation, the emptiness.’
‘No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the house-maid in the morning, and my valet, or my wife’s maid, during the rest of the day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in my despatch-box.’
‘Milverton had got wind of it,’ I said, looking at Watson. ‘Or had been told. And who better to tell him of that young man, Watson, than Moran, who had entrapped him in those debts in the first place. Moran it was who promised to settle with Milverton, if Holder would do him ‘a little service,’ do you recall? We have not seen those two together, but we have seen Worth and Moran together. It was at the opera with the respectable Professor Moriarty, as I recall: now there is a man who had better watch the company he keeps, for it is said truly that evil communications corrupt good manners.’
‘Then by all means seek your bed; you will be better in it than drowsing on the sofa and waking with a crick in your neck. I shall do very well here for a while. Go, Watson, and sleep.’
Towards the end of April, there was a new operetta at the Opera Comique. It was ‘Patience’, a satire on the Aesthetic movement which I longed, yet feared, to attend. It pained me to see Wilde burlesqued. We were not acquaintances, but I knew of him through the Fancy: for he was a man of my year, and had been up at Oxford when I was moping around my Cambridge rooms. We both boxed as amateurs, though we had never been up against each other. His was a very different character to mine, yet I had marked him long since as one such as I. He was a dedicated aesthete: I believed him also to be an invert, whether he knew it yet or no. And he fascinated me, for he was so much what I was not. His verbal and sartorial flamboyance astounded and appalled me; his courting of social disaster terrified and electrified me at once. Myself, although in moments of excitement I could not always control my manner, I took care that my demeanour tended to the coolly severe, my dress to the quietly prim, with no hint of a luxuriance that might betray me. Though internally I might feel so acutely as to be almost mad with it at times, and externally I delighted, as I have said, in the caress of silk, in all that was sensuous and fine, I allowed nothing of this to show to the world. In any case, I suggested to Watson that we might attend Patience, and was both pained and relieved at his decided negative.
Watson was sharper than I. ‘You wished to speak to us about our work? What is it you are saying, Lestrade? That Holmes and I might not always choose to be at the Yard? Or that we might not always be welcome at the Yard?’
‘A cot can be endowed for thirty pounds a year, Holmes, but one would want a little more than that so that after a year or so, the child could go to one of the convalescent homes in the country, and also so that her parents could visit her at intervals. Say forty, to be on the safe side. I have looked at my bank account, but I cannot rise to all of that at the moment.’
‘It argues a very feeling heart in you,’ I rejoined. I wanted desperately to take his hand, to wander home with him thus, linked as lovers, but all I could do was take his arm. ‘Do not be ashamed of it, my dear fellow. It is a most becoming gentleness.’
'My love,’ he said, possessing himself once more of my hand. 'It is my love you have, Holmes. Go on.’
'I know. Sherlock, do not - do not - not analyse, question, deduce anything. Just - be with me. For God's sake, just be with me. I cannot lose you.'
‘You would have been a pretty fair shot had you had army training,’ he commented, tossing me a handkerchief. ‘Wipe your brow and your hands, Holmes, and I shall clear up down here. Although I am afraid the wall is now looking rather pockmarked.’
‘But what of the information Mr Holmes requested,’ he asked, direct, a captain to one of his men. ‘What do you have for us, Johnson?’
I was sure I could have corrected Billy’s world view, but the effort was too great. And being hauled into the cab was doing vile things to my queasy stomach.
Later that evening, having taken a cab part way there, we walked to the Savoy Theatre, its new electrical lights a coruscating brilliance in the misty air. Watson, as I had not hesitated to tell him, was fine as fivepence in a smoothly brushed top hat, and a new summer suit. His cravat was deep blue, and seeing he had no pin for it, I had lent him one of mine, a diamond, discreet, small, but of the finest water. His eyes were bright with excitement, and his stride military: a month’s swimming, stretching, and walking in the summer warmth had put muscle on him and almost done away with his limp. He was beautiful – and, alas, I was not the only one who saw it, for we were not able to be alone, as I had wished. All London, it seemed, had elected to visit the Savoy that night. Among them were several of Watson’s acquaintance, although (despite a momentary pang of suspicion) I acquitted him of collusion as soon as I saw the comic look of resigned despair he turned on me when Burns-Gibson bustled up to him in the foyer, several people trailing after him.
‘Is it my fault if rats, once released into the yard, make a bee-line for where there is food in the house? It is merely their rattish nature to be drawn to richer pickings, indeed, I have no doubt they counted themselves fortunate, for, God help us, there is little enough for them to eat in some of those filthy kennels from which they came.’
‘I did. She seemed at first perfectly quiet. She was living retired, of course, in pleasant rooms, and seemed to be happy so, but she laboured under a sense that she was being punished. She said often that she had ‘done something dreadful’; that she was being punished, that her Mama would be very sorry and shocked to know of what she had done, and I had better not tell her. I replied, I recall, that her Mama loved her, and would certainly not wish to see her so sad, and she repeated that she had done something dreadful, that she had behaved ‘awfully’ and that she would be ‘sent home to Mama if she did not behave herself now.’ And at that point she seemed nothing but a child –  and a terrified, shamed child, not the merry girl I knew.’
‘You are weary now,’ Watson’s voice was low and tender. ‘I wish it were possible to transport you instantly to our rooms, Holmes, and to give you the silence you need.’
‘Indeed; I am so happy we have managed to procure him that small favour. I do not believe Mrs Lestrade has ever been so far afield before. What is your lecture? I see from the paper, by the way, that your erstwhile favourite Labouchère has been enraging the more traditional member of the House again.’
‘To no-one,’ he agreed. We had, as if by some common, unspoken, consent stepped back a little from the deep intimacy of our words, our locked eyes: we could not – or I could not, and he, I thought, would not – stay long in that place. Our eyes did not meet again. Our consent, though, his to me, and mine to him, to our closeness was acknowledged: henceforth he was my soldier and my shield: I his willing devotee.
The blind was not down in your room, and I could see Miss Harrison sitting there reading by the table. It was quarter-past ten when she closed her book, fastened the shutters, and retired. I heard her shut the door, and felt quite sure that she had turned the key in the lock.”
‘I do not care what the world says.’ His voice was a low mutter. ‘I do not care, do you hear me? You are my Damon, my friend above all friends, my more than brother, my – my soul, Sherlock. I will not let you be harmed. I will not put you at risk. But I will not leave and I will not be driven away, and I will not, oh, I will not give up the chiefest good in my life, this  - yes, I will, I will call it love, for David loved Jonathan with his whole soul, his whole heart – this more than all to me. I will not.’
Watson moved to assist me, helping me from the chair to lie upon the sofa. He covered me with an old worn afghan of ours, and when I would have spoken, laid a finger to my lips. ‘Hush now. You must neither exert nor excite yourself, but lie here until these palpitations subside. You are a poor subject for drugs, Holmes, you are too volatile as it is. Not another word out of you for an hour, and you must try to sleep again, please.’
‘Thank you.’ Watson stretched and yawned. ‘Will it ever stop raining this winter, do you think? I am not sure but what we are approaching a second Deluge. And are you not curious to know the sender of the missive you have just destroyed?’
‘He reached the rank of Colonel in my own regiment, the Fifth Northumberland. He himself was at odds with his father, my grandfather, an ironmaster from Bradford, who had wanted him to take over the business. But my father joined the army, with his mother’s, and an uncle’s support. You are right about religion. My father, and his, were Protestants – Dissenters, not our established church. My mother was a Catholic. She was Irish, from a good, though poor, family, which disowned her for marrying a Protestant. I never knew her family, nor those grandparents. My brother went back to my grandfather’s manufactory for a time, but he could never make a go of anything after my mother died. He was her darling, more than either me, or my sister. He had my father’s blond hair and brown eyes. He was a handsome boy, was Harry, until he ruined his looks and liver with laudanum and drink.’
‘Hush, my very dear. Of course you have not hurt me; you have the gentlest hand – indeed how can you not - you a scientist, and musician? But we shall talk of all of that later. Now I am truly feeling better today, and I desire that you shall see Lestrade, and then take some rest. If you will not leave me, then you may lie here with me to rest after the Inspector is gone, so I can wake you if there is aught I need. But go now, and speak to Lestrade. I have been thinking about this, and I was wrong. We must tell him what has occurred: such an attack cannot go unrecognised.’
'I believe that there is. But if you hope to persuade him to -  accept anything from you - he will not take . . .'
‘Yes,’ I said. I looked at him as he stood there, soft in dressing gown and slippers, his cuffs and collar off his shirt, and his trousers unbraced. The firelight set an aureole around his hair, haloed him like some saint as he looked at me. ‘John – you take such good care of me always. You are so patient. So kind.’
If I had known little of Cornwall before, I was soon to know much more than I wanted. The man was a bugger: that much was soon clear. Which is to say that he had regularly engaged in in the past, and habitually did engage in
Watson was ill for some days after his return home, indeed the journey home nearly did for him, for we conveyed him secretly in a dilapidated closed carriage that jolted and banged over the cobbles and wrung suppressed moans from him at every turn of the wheel. Jack and I had to support him upstairs past a shocked Mrs Hudson, and put him to bed in my bedroom, as being more convenient. The wound on his head bled again when I eased the bandage off and I had to bathe it loose, with his head on a towel on my pillow. I called Moore Agar in to see him, and told him the facts of the case: Agar could be trusted, for he was an invert as was I. He suspected me. I knew he suspected me for I found myself incapable of concealing either my concern or my affection for Watson when he was there, but he would say nothing.
‘Yes. It is true that then I thought I knew, but now – with these dangers . . . I do not. I do not know. You said that you would not bring harm to the man you loved: when you drew back from me after - after Leila, I thought you might not wish - might not want the risk for yourself, either.  And I am a selfish man, John, but no more would I bring harm to you, so dear to me.’
‘We have not been to the opera - of any sort - since July, when we heard the de Reszkes in Les Huguenots at Drury Lane. We need rest, and recreation for the soul: you, in particular do. I swear there are silver threads amid the gold, John.’
‘Yet there is much good in the world,’ I reproved him. ‘For example, here before me is an honourable doctor, once sorely wounded himself, and still in need of care, who has been kindness’ self to a chance-met stranger, succouring him to the best of his ability, unfailingly thoughtful and generous. And here is a man of, let us face it, doubtful morals and dubious reputation who is very grateful and proud to be companioned by that same good doctor. Pray let me attend with you, Watson. You developed a friendly feeling for young Trevelyan, I am sure. It is grievous to lose a friend, and so you regarded him, did you not?’
Some small good at least came out of the great evil, for I would not grieve him by taking cocaine when he was so over-pressed with worry, and he thanked me for my hard-won abstinence with a deep tenderness of his own: as loving and patient with me as any man could be with a lover. I burned for him, as I believe he did for me, but by a mutual agreement we restrained ourselves, hoping for a more propitious day to dawn.
'He knew it: did you see him quail? And as for what we thought it was -  what was there that I could do to protect you.' I could not stop my voice shaking. 'A cloud of damn sal volatile from a broken flask to choke him while you ran was the best of my invention in the moment: how ridiculous, how ultimately futile.'
‘We have already said that we cannot live one without the other. Hush.’ He paused, clearly gathering his strength, before he went on. ‘It happens sometimes that one person will have a pronounced idiosyncrasy – an intolerance – for a drug, and a dose that another may take is death to him.’ Another pause, longer, while he recovered. ‘Clearly, my system does not tolerate cocaine in anything but the minutest dose, and yours does.’
He laughed, picked up his modest valise, clapped me on the shoulder, and went to his work with a spring in his step and a smile. I packed, soberly, not forgetting his injunction to take a muffler, ‘for the air is chill in the evenings.’ If truth be told, I was wild to be away. The one taste of opium had re-awakened the craving, and I was hard beset at times. It stood before me, an Apollyon in my way, and like Christian battling the foul fiend, I was wounded, and weary and spent. Watson guarded me well, albeit unknowing the demon from which he guarded me, ever alert to my moods, ever ready to amuse or beguile, or suggest. As yet, I had not told him how long standing a war this was, or that he had seen only a minor skirmish in the campaign I waged against myself.
'That bandage tells of adventures,” said Watson. He grasped my hand, unwrapped it and examined my abraded knuckles and the cut that disfigured my wrist. 'We shall have some iodine on that, shortly and a stitch or two would not go amiss. I cannot think how I have never taught you to do a decent bandage, Holmes, but I must no longer delay doing so. But won’t you tell us what has happened, my dear fellow?'
‘I would be grateful to know the details of what I am accused, Inspector,’ Watson leaned forward, his eyes earnest. ‘This touches me in my professional integrity, and very deeply – very painfully. I am a healer, not a killer. I am who I am, the man you have always known. I cared for your son. I brought Lestrade’s wife back from the brink. I am John Watson, surgeon and physician. I do not lead a double life.’
'What fine feathers for my fine bird,' he mocked me, but gently, taking the ring I had shown him to examine it. He looked down then, and his face was sad. 'A plain gold band would suit you better than this. Your hands are beautiful, Holmes, despite the scars and stains, or so I have always thought. But the stone is very fine, of course: I love its clear fire.
All characters and events relating to the  Earl of Euston’s divorce proceeedings, the ‘Trial of the Detectives’ and the ‘Dublin Castle Scandals’ of 1883/4 are accurate and attested by evidence in the newspaper reports of the libel trials, police records, the records of the trials themselves, and, where parliament is referenced, Hansard.
He groaned, his eyes still closed, and reached under the chair, dragging his watch up by the chain. ‘It is five in the morning, Holmes. Could you not have chosen a more civilised time to come round after two days of near stupor? Go back to sleep until the day is properly aired for heavens’ sake: you know how I hate early mornings.’
‘Two days? What have you done? Have you slept, or changed your clothes? Eaten? Have you been with me all this time?’
‘You know, Holmes, I would not have thought he would have focused on the action of Mr Eccles before the case, nor that he would have investigated Mr Eccles further, once it became clear he could not have murdered Garcia. I would not have imagined he would have taken it upon himself to station constables outside the house of Mr Melville, retired brewer, of Albemarle Mansions, Kensington, where Eccles met Garcia, nor, even in my most unpleasant dreams, that he would have introduced a young constable posing as a rent boy into the house, there to trap those unwary wretches who were simply trying to live, Holmes, to live their lives with some  - some affection to have, in a world that condemns their seeking it. And to enter the house with warrants, no, I would not have thought he would do that. So, alas, I cannot be sure of what he would have thought had he come to the Bull  - ’
He sighed. 'I am sure you have thought of it. Of course you have. You would not be yourself had you not. I too know you, Holmes. It is a fine line, between who you are - and who you might be - and yet, my friend, I have no fear that you would cross it. You will not cross it.'
Watson quotes Cowper, with his 'rural sounds' statement, and Holmes caps his quote. Georgette Heyer aficionadoes may also recognise Kitty's Miss Fish quoting the passage to Freddy Standen from Cotillion.
‘You took the one I wanted,’ I grumbled, just to tease him, ‘The littlest one, that was least well done. You know I cannot stomach over-cooked pastry, or too much of it.’
I knew the instant he became aware, for he released me, and flung away, his breath heaving. He cowered there, his hands to his face, and I was broken, for I had harmed where I sought to heal, and all because of my own stupidity. I scrambled off the bed, went to the door to retrieve the brandy glasses, and approached him slowly, giving him time to recover a little.
'I know.’ He touched my lips with his finger, outlining my mouth, and I could not stop myself: small, hungry, shameless, I asked for his mouth on mine.
‘Dr Watson’s presence is provided for, in fact it is desirable, since it will give cover to your visit: there are many medical advances, I am told, that are coming out of Germany and that he could be interested in.’
‘It is more likely to return exasperated and resentful,’ I teased him. ‘if ‘ten thousand warblers cheer the day’ from first light to dusk. Although it is also more likely to be the prosaic cockerel that cheers the day, rather than a delicate warbler, Watson, and very early indeed. But I shall expect you not to mind it, lover of nature that you are.’
‘Ah, was there, indeed? Describe him, Lestrade: what like was he? Hair? Voice? Did he speak? Did you see his face, hear him? Would you recognise him again?’
‘On the third night, she was alarmed that her courses, to which she was not well accustomed, had come on, and she became hysterical - almost certainly because of the painful and distressing events of the two preceding nights.’ Watson told me. ‘Yes, I know you do not like to hear of it, but I am a doctor. And if you are to be a consulting detective, dealing equally with all, I cannot allow you to remain ignorant. I have heard from Lady Sheffield, who spoke to the Countess’s maid, and who is able to write to me what she will not say to you: my profession renders me almost neutral in this respect, and so there is no shame. In an attempt to stop her from crying, Durham plunged the poor child forcibly into a deep bath of cold water, from which she extricated herself and fled, screaming and naked, through a house full of servants to the garden, pursued thence by her protesting maid, and a furious husband who cried out upon her for her extreme and shameful immodesty and threatened that she should be returned home to her mother in disgrace.’
‘But Forrester is a good fellow – and it will not harm us to help him. He is kindly disposed towards you: we cannot afford to pass up any good interest we can obtain. Cases are not plentiful of late – Gregson has put none our way for months, and Lestrade has had nothing for us either, not that it is that he does not want to, but all domestic investigations have been put on hold for the police to deal with this terrible rioting -  and our coffers are low again. And matters are not shaping well for men like us, men who – for men who - ’
‘Good,’ I touched him on the shoulder briefly, a fleeting, treasured caress. ‘Then when you are ready, we shall go to Romano’s. And I would welcome your help on this new case that we may be consulted on, Watson. I had a telegram from Lestrade earlier, and it promises to be most interesting. Are you with me, my friend?’
'Some ten or twelve cases in prospect, but none which present any feature of interest. They are important, you understand, as they have a bearing on our great affair with the Professor - a matter of some of Worth's thieves, an informer or two to of Moran's to suborn, and ream for information -  but without being interesting. Indeed, I have found that it is usually in unimportant matters that there is a field for the observation, and for the quick analysis of cause and effect which gives the charm to an investigation. The larger crimes are apt to be the simpler, for the bigger the crime the more obvious, as a rule, is the motive. In these cases, save for one rather intricate matter which has been referred to me from Marseilles and relates to our quiet friend Mr Charles Augustus Milverton, there is nothing which presents any features of interest.'
