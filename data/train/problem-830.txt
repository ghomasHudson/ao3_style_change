“How do you want to come, John?” Sherlock deepened his voice and lowered his lips to John’s ear. “Do you want to come inside me?”
you mean, Holmes? Who am I?” It was so pained, so raw, that Rosie felt guilty for even hearing that small, questioning voice in her head. Rosie knew what it was like, growing up without knowing who both of her parents were. She felt that question- who am I?- in her bones, like a constant thrum under the rhythm of personality. They were both missing key pieces in the puzzle of self-identity. It’s why they fit together so well, but Rosie knew what it was like to feel incomplete. Stella was the most honest person she knew. She would never lie about who she was. Not to her. Not to anyone.
Sherlock looked taken aback. “Clearly,” he muttered under his breath, and something about his tone set Rosie on edge.
Sherlock pulled at John’s jacket. “Get all this off.”
“Leave, John.” John struggled and squirmed against Sherlock’s grip on his hips. Sherlock didn’t have the endurance to keep him down, so he needed to talk quickly, and harshly. “How dare you accuse
The owner was an older gentleman who had lived in the central Taiwan countryside his whole life, growing and selling tea and running the homestay for more adventurous travelers. He spoke with Sherlock in Mandarin:
Sherlock clapped his hands and leapt out of his seat. A few heads turned, but John wasn’t paying them any mind when this madman was at the brink of a breakthrough. He was mesmerizing, like this. “You’re brilliant
“A last hurrah?” Sherlock finished for her, and she nodded.
John smiles, swallowing the ball of worry in his throat. “Watson family trait, is it?”
“The blog was highly romanticized, exaggerated, and hardly an accurate portrayal of the facts. But he was easily charmed at the beginning, yes.”
to be John. How could he have missed the signs? She was Mary’s daughter, after all. He should have considered that she might be better at pulling off a trick than John.
He nodded.
“Welcome to Taiwan,” the cashier smiled.
“Watson woke up, for a bit. Mrs. Hudson made lentil soup. Watson had more of it on her face than in her stomach, but she seemed to like it, nonetheless. I read the insect book to her, the one Molly bought her, with the rhyming scavenger hunt. She seems to enjoy the desert landscape page most.” Sherlock moves his ministrations to John’s shoulders. “I put her to bed, and stayed to keep an eye on her and get some things done on my laptop. And...I didn’t want to disturb you.”
Past tense. Sherlock hated it. “An understatement.”
“I’ve got to stop this,” he whispers.
“You could stay here, you know.” Sherlock was trying to be nonchalant, and failing.
As they prepared the body for transport, he mentioned the importance of a toxicology report to the coroner. Her skin- it looked like it had been irritated by an inorganic compound. A persistent voice at the back of his head told him Sherlock would have known what it was.
She used his Chinese name, 夏洛克福爾摩斯 (Xià luòkè fú'ěrmósī). The first character of his last name meant “luck,” and it felt starkly misplaced at the moment.
“Is that what you would say about me? To the next woman who comes along? The next Mary?” Sherlock spit her name. John stepped further away, shocked to hear that name, from Sherlock’s mouth, in this context. He reflexively rubbed at the scar under his eye. Earl growled from across the room.
John was refusing to drink the tea without knowing what it did. Probably wise, actually, but Sherlock was too curious not to try it. He had always preferred practical research.
Oh. This could be an interesting line of questioning. “Wank fantasies?”
. “John,” Sherlock breathed, and John actually gripped onto Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock’s eyes snapped shut, his mouth dry. He couldn’t just let this lie between them any longer. “You said…”
to elicit an undignified moan from his new husband. More of that, then.
When he returned to the table, the slightest bit more composed, Sherlock was sitting, chewing on an apple as if their exchange hadn’t happened. His gaze was fixed on John’s legs. “You’ve joined a rugby league for men over 50.”
“Do it, John,” Sherlock pleaded, and John obliged. With a bit of maneuvering, Sherlock wrapped his legs around John’s hips, and John- as slowly and carefully as he could manage- pushed inside.
John stood to attention, already feeling that addictive rush of adrenaline. “Has EMS been called?” he asked, already striding across the room in Doctor Mode.
Sherlock Holmes? Detective?” Rosie nodded. Who else would be called Sherlock Holmes?
“I want you
She slumped back into the chair next to Dad’s. “I don’t want you tobelonely,” she mumbled, not quite able to look him in the eye.
1:18pm
Sherlock had tried hard to prove that life at 221B would be suitable for a child. He’d bought child locks, a playpen, a Bach for Kids album and an Alexa speaker. He had set a shelf aside for picture books recommended by the leading early childhood education experts. For Christmas, he had carefully set up gifts around the hearth as if Father Christmas himself had brought them- John and Mrs. Hudson loved that sort of thing. John noticed and occasionally commented on his efforts, but they made no difference. John and Rosie stubbornly kept their current living arrangement.
Until this question, Xiaowen had acted as if there was no case to be solved. But at this, she adjusted her fringe in distress. “That’s the problem-
Dad stole the microphone from Sherlock and stood directly under the flowered arch.
“Did you?” John would not let Sherlock duck out of this line of questioning, like he’d dodged every other question thrown at him in the last day.
¿Donde ______, Yolanda?
“Oh, and John Watson, too.” The woman stiffened, straightening her posture, focusing her attention on John. “Particularly enjoyed the Culverton case. I always knew he was rotten.”
Sherlock pretends he hates the attention, but John sees right through it. “What did Mycroft want?” Sherlock cuts in, desperate for the chance to change the subject and rail against his big brother.
“How do you think Dr. Watson will feel about this, hm? He has a young child.”

badly.
John shook his head and took a breath, preparing to tell a story that Sherlock wouldn’t believe. “Earlier, in the office. I didn’t drink the truth tea.”
To be honest, she had felt tossed away by John after the big rift with Sherlock. Molly had considered John a friend, once. But without Sherlock to give her and John an excuse to talk, they drifted. Molly had tried reaching out in the beginning, but John had ignored her. And after all the avoided texts, when she had dissected every interaction her and John had ever had, Molly realized that John had never been particularly friendly to her. He had

“I have reason to believe that someone’s been after Stella all along.”
Rosie surprised him with an enthusiastic hug, regardless of his current state. She hadn’t seen Sherlock in months, and it shocked her how much she’d missed him. She’d been all over the continent in the last seven months, touring her album at concert venues across Europe, eating cheap food, not getting any sleep. It had been an incredible experience, but she was chuffed to have a place to call home more permanently. Now that the tour was over, she had more promotional deals to do in London, more songwriting and recording.
He pulls on Sherlock’s curls, exposing his neck. He uses the momentum to flip them around so that Sherlock is backed up against the kitchen counter. John grinds into him, licking at his neck.
But it took only a matter of minutes for Sherlock’s brain to sprint back into action, and relief quickly solidified into confusion, pleasure into panic. He stiffened.
Sherlock scowls, setting his tea down with a
This Sherlock was staring at her from down the hallway, decidedly not from Dad’s desktop computer, but the stiffness was so very much the same, Rosie nearly laughed.
“I was in a bad way,” John admitted, rubbing the hairs at the back of his neck. “I spent a bit too much time imagining what could have been, and…” he held up the velvet case. “It’s cheap, and it might not even fit, but, will you put it on for me? I know it’s a bit weird, but it would, uh. Mean a lot.”
It should have been rather endearing, but the remark pulled at Sherlock. “Oh, well. Thank you, Weixian. We’ll see you tomorrow morning.”
“Don’t bring a gun, _____ knife, _____ tyre lever. Probably best not to do any arm-spraining, but we’ll see how the night goes.”
They were riding the High Speed Rail train northbound to Taipei, John and Sherlock in one row, Xiaowen in the next up.
John handing Sherlock his mobile for the first time. John pinning down a criminal in a back alley. John reading a terribly predictable novel in his chair at Baker Street. John starting a fire in the kitchen after a failed attempt at a wretched shepherd's pie. John learning to dance, his own hands nearly shaking atop John’s shoulder. John kissing him. Oh
John closed his eyes and drew in a breath. He was beautiful like this, on the precipice of confession. Vulnerability had slipped through the brick wall that was John Watson on so few occasions that Sherlock began cataloguing every detail of him out of sheer habit.
“John,” Sherlock whispered, his hand resting so lightly on John’s shoulder that John could have imagined it. It was the first time Sherlock had touched him in so long, and it calmed him. John desperately wanted Sherlock to wrap his arms firmly around his own waist and rest his head against John’s shoulder, but obviously, that didn’t come. “Let’s go inside. I’ll put the kettle on.”
The A&E staff member he spoke with on the phone didn’t give many details, so John can only speculate as to how- or why- the accident happened. He feels a hand on his lower back, both grounding and tentative in a way that can only be Sherlock’s. In the last couple of months, he’s become used to Sherlock’s small, reassuring touches. A brush of fingers when giving John a cup of tea. The briefest of shoulder rubs when Sherlock deduces John’s had a rough night with Rosie, or a particularly challenging therapy session. Fingers mussing John’s hair when he’s made a rude comment about Mycroft. A short hug nearly every time John leaves Baker Street. The two of them are on their way to being more comfortable with each other than they have been in years, and John is grateful for it.
“I’m not leaving London.”

, Sherlock, this is…” Sherlock’s hands deftly untied the knot on the dressing gown and reached for the exposed skin under his t-shirt around his waist.
“Oh, you’re perfect, so perfect,” John speeds his thrusts. Open-mouthed and panting, Sherlock lets go of his cock, letting the friction of John’s thrusts stimulate him. He uses his now-free hand to scratch along John’s back and side.
He turned back to Jacqueline. “You wanted to hurt him, didn’t you? The way Moran hurt you. He killed your husband, and the opportunity to kill his daughter fell right into your hands. It was too good to be true. But you’re not a killer, Jacqueline. You were sloppy. You were desperate. You made mistakes. You were trying to be clever, and in doing so, you weren’t clever at all. You could’ve very well killed the daughter of a man who made your husband’s death

thing Rosie had expected to hear. “Oh.” But as the seconds ticked by, she realized this was exactly the thing she needed to know; an essential piece of the identity puzzle. In a distorted, convoluted way, this hidden part of her history made sense. “Oh.”
“Her timing is impeccable. She’s brilliant,” Clara gushes. John smiles, agreeing. “She looks like Harry, a bit.”
she typed.
Sherlock nodded, handing him the bottle. With a promising kiss, they maneuvered into position, Sherlock’s cheek squished on the pillow, John leaning over him, admiring the smoothness of his back and arse. He poured a hearty amount of lube over his fingers and teased the slickness over Sherlock’s hole. With a questioning hum and an answering reassuring whine, he sunk a finger inside. Sherlock’s moan sounded like it was pulled out of him.
“Stay over, John.” Sherlock swirled the bit of remaining wine in his glass. He looked divine in the firelight, relaxed from the wine.
He lived through crushing grief after Sherlock’s fall. There was the loneliness the business with Mary had caused: bitter and sharp. The confusing pang of loss after everything in his life was uprooted left him feeling empty and so, so angry. The fake wife, fake baby, and fake death made him abandon everything that had made his life real.
John took it, rubbed some of the liquid onto his hands, started to stroke. Sherlock sighed at the touch, as if he had taken a puff of a cigarette after months of abstaining. John loved seeing the man he often remembered as the most chaotic he had ever met fully relax into his touch like this. He felt himself getting harder again. “What do you mean, it’s not ‘just me’?”
Sherlock gives both Rosie and John a kiss on the cheek by way of greeting. Rosie calms slightly at the sight of him, her cries turning to soft hiccups.
“That’s Amy,” Xiaowen gasped, not quite believing the words as she said them. (Amy, then).
the happy couple!” cried a sweet, reminiscent voice in John’s periphery. The familiarity of it startled him; that voice could only belong to someone he thought he’d never see again. He turned to look and--
Oh’s titular character in a BBC series
“I lied.”
John has imagined this hundreds of times, but the thrill of Sherlock’s hand on him like this is all-consuming.
“And I’m their doctor,” John called, carrying both suitcases and receiving some distasteful glares as he slid past.
Sherlock threaded his fingers through his own shirt in the same way, slipping a hand beneath the buttons onto his cold skin, imagining it was John’s. With John’s head resting heavily on his shoulder, he could so easily pretend his Mind Palace version was real. Gooseflesh formed underneath his own touch.
Sherlock nodded. Watson looked up at the ceiling to hold back tears, and Sherlock distracted himself from being affected by Watson’s tears by deducing her friends. Old friends-- likely from the fine arts school. One actress (obvious), and one artist- painter, perhaps? The last thing he wanted was to be stuck in this interaction getting emotional praise for minimal effort. It was John who had saved Stella’s life.
“Hm.” Sherlock considered. Lucky timing on John’s part. Iris must have brought it with her when she came in after he passed out. She had been planning on using it.
And from what Rosie found in Dad’s journal that morning, there was no question as to how much he longed to know Sherlock again, too.
Sherlock wondered if the chemical makeup of the truth-tea had attached itself to any parts of John’s memory altered or suppressed by the TD-12. Mary had caught Sherlock in the act- she had known about his feelings toward John, and she had shot him for it. Sherlock had strong evidence that she had also known about John’s feelings for Sherlock, even if he hadn’t confronted them himself.
That afternoon, John collects more things from his other flat. Then, he and Sherlock make a pointed phone call to an Anita Stimson.
Sherlock returns it. “Thought you’d never ask.”
“I’m gay,” she said. Dad had always preferred to get right to the point. It was a principle they shared.
Sherlock’s fingers shifted to her wrist in a shockingly intimate way of a first greeting. What was he-
So I wanna know
It only occurred to Sherlock a week later, once the paralyzing numbness over the loss of Mrs. Hudson had faded into more of a manageable grief contained inside his body, that he’d made a mistake. He’d wanted to see John Watson again very,
When Delia, a late 20-something with a bright pink, asymmetrical bob who made John feel about 85, caught sight of Rosie, her eyebrows shot to the ceiling. John stiffened. The last thing Rosie needed was validation that he’d given her hair a hack job.
“Help yourself,” Sherlock said, gesturing openly to the fridge.
John took a seat at the island, piling a large scoop of melted brie onto a biscuit, digesting this. It wasn’t John’s place anymore to pry, but he had to know about the drugs before he was pulled any further back into Sherlock’s orbit. “You’re clean, then?”

“You alright?” John asked her, and there was a single syllable response Sherlock didn’t catch. Xiaowen assured John that Iris would be passed out for about an hour, and he nodded. It took a few tense minutes of the security guard glancing nervously between Iris’s unmoving figure, John, and the door, but the rope was ultimately severed and John stood to his full height.

At this, Sherlock was too intrigued to feign indifference. “How did you get it open?”

Clara had always been humble, one of the things John liked about her, but this was a gross understatement. “No...you planned the services while I couldn’t be bothered to put down the whiskey. You’re basically a saint.”
A spark of anger flashed on John’s face. “Will you tell me what happened? Everything, Sherlock. Not the watered-down version. I’m not a child.”
Sherlock’s words from years ago echoed in John’s head:
They both knew it wasn’t. “I don’t want you thinking you’re an experiment to me, Sherlock, because you’re not.
as Xiaowen stepped into the cramped carriage. She had managed narrowly to slip on with the tour group ahead of her in line, but now they were chatting loudly and snapping pictures through the train windows. She wished she had waited for a less lively train, but silently cheered when she spotted an empty seat at the end of the carriage.
John’s worry intensified with Sherlock’s lack of response, and he took quick steps to join him back at the car. Sherlock looked away, embarrassed at his lack of suavity, but John took his chin with one hand and turned it to face him, his other arm rubbing Sherlock’s forearm soothingly.
She started writing.
John strokes, hard and fast, exactly how he needs this. John’s panting into Sherlock’s neck. “Harder, John.” John growls, biting and sucking at the skin there. He has an instinctual urge to mark him. “
and John gives him a playful slap on the bum before opening the door and walking out into the sunny flat.
The last time Sherlock had seen John Watson, he’d told him he never wanted to see him again.
“I’ve always been curious about that. Does he really need your help?”

“Well? What did you find?” Yasmin prodded. “I bet your dad has some secrets.”
soft tongues. Sherlock grasped at John’s button-up, pulling him impossibly close, wanting to absorb John into his skin. “John,” he whined.
“I love you, too. It’s honestly dangerous how much.”
any-” Sherlock cut in, but Molly waved him off.
Sherlock’s newly-bandaged head shot up to look at John. “What?” Ridiculous. Gaslighting. “I don’t know what you…”
He woke in a dark room next to a heap of cleaning supplies and forgotten museum labels with no concept of how much time had passed. His mind was foggy, and it took him opening and closing his eyes a few times before realizing he was actually awake, in the broom closet in Iris Lyu’s office, his hands and ankles tied with rope. His temple was throbbing, and upon touching it, he felt the beginnings of a bruise. When he pulled his hand away, bright red dots of blood coated his index and middle fingers. Iris and the guard must have thrown him in the closet headfirst. Idiots. The area around his acromioclavicular joint vaguely ached where the security guard had shot him with the tranquilizer. There were muffled voices outside, one of them John’s.
“I will. Thanks, Dad.” Rosie put her hand on his chest, taking comfort in the soft fabric there. “Don’t worry. My heart’s always with you, here.”
Her family owned a tea farm, and her mother had a fascination with jade, so she was well versed in the spectrum of greens. Fond memories of Saturdays spent at the flower market, finding turtles at the forest park and dashing through the tables at the jade market colored memories of her childhood. But the color green stood out among the rest. Flecks of mint, pistachio, and hunter green pebbled her mother’s thick jade bracelets and small hand-crafted figurines. Xiaowen had memorized them all.
“Rosie,” he started, his voice cracking a bit, betraying his emotion. He swallowed, trying to hold it together for the both of them. “I am so proud of you. Always.”
In fact, it
Sherlock pressed his lips to John’s. They let their lips linger there, revelling in the permissibility of it, knowing they had all the time in the world to find the right pressure and pull of lips against the other’s. “Shame,” Sherlock mouthed, licking at John’s bottom lip. “I had intended on dragging you to bed and keeping you there for a week.”
It didn’t stop Sherlock from ruminating on the possibilities for Xiaowen’s truth tea based on John’s discovery- ones of which Xiaowen could not yet have conceived.
2. B*tch, to a Russian
(See the end of the chapter for
“I’m- I’m glad you came, John,” Sherlock said, meeting John’s eyes. In his memory, John’s eyes had been the kind of deep blue of the ocean in nature documentaries, shot from the perspective of a blue whale or seal or shark. But today, it was as if he was standing above the ocean, looking down on the crash of dark, foreboding waves swirling in John’s irises. He fractionally tightened his grip on John’s hand.
He suspiciously surveyed the meal. “Is this some kind of apology? Experiment?” He curled his mouth into a smirk and held Sherlock’s eyes with his own. “Poison?” A certain incident involving sugar in John’s coffee in Dartmoor flickered in his mind’s eye.
John’s mouth, on his cock. Even Mind Palace John hadn’t gone there. The imminent reality of this fantasy was making him delirious. That, and John’s hand rubbing harder over his increasingly hard cock.

They were kissing again. It was hurried breath and wet lips and rough stubble and
The face rub clearly hadn’t worked. “Not great, to be honest. A woman on the hotel staff just died. You probably just passed the ambulance. I tried to revive her, but…” he trailed off, not wanting to admit his failure out loud.
“I think--” Daddy shifted in his seat, bobbing Rosie up and down. “People aren’t so black and white. I think everyday people can do heroic things, but making people into heroes never does anyone any good.”
when it comes to John Watson.”
She looked taken aback. Too harsh, then. People were impossible.
Oh, how his life had changed within the course of a few hours. Just that morning, he and John were having a domestic at the hotel breakfast buffet about who deserted the other. Now they were
“You’re Sherlock Holmes,” the flight attendant whispered, handing their drinks over. John didn’t hesitate bringing the plastic cup to his lips.
John raised an eyebrow, called out on his drinking. Sherlock did not ever comment on John’s drinking habits. It was one of those things they both knew about but had silently signed a contract not to speak about. “You know, this truth-tea Sherlock reminds me of the Sherlock I first met,” John observed.
John had moved on from working on the centrepieces to confirming with the vendors when Jacqueline, the peppy event manager, came running into the reception hall completely frazzled.
“I deduced it.”
As the receptionist handed Sherlock their (very separate) keys, John reveled at the lobby. “This place is insane,” he said, his mouth agape at the grand piano automatically playing Auld Lang Syne in front of the marble fountain. “Mycroft must have spent a pretty penny.”
John swallowed. The lump in his throat loosened. He stepped closer, placing his hands on Sherlock’s waist, curling his fingers in the thick fibres of his jumper. Sherlock leaned into the touch. “I can’t do another five years without you, Sherlock.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“It was rather last minute, actually. His brother got me a flight this morning.”
“Why...why would you not trust her?” Rosie croaked, the sense that this was going to be a fatal blow lodged in her throat. Stella looped her fingers through Rosie’s, a stabilizing force on shifting grounds.
“Oh, you.” Molly gave him a light smack on the arm, but the revealing hint of blush was so twenty-years-ago, John couldn’t help but chuckle. “I’m chuffed, really. For both of you. A bit put off I didn’t get an invite, but-”
He was hard. His own fingers loomed dangerously close to his erection, having followed the path he had imagined John’s would take. He didn’t particularly like the idea of masturbating a few metres away from John separated only by a thin door. But, it seemed, his penis did.
“Got anything in?” he called, already rifling through the cabinets searching for any edible substances. He wiped his hair with a tea towel and tossed it unceremoniously in the sink.
She and Stella settled in and unpacked their suitcases while Dad and Sherlock cooked, filling the flat with the scent of basil, oregano, and thyme. Italian spices; must be pasta. Dad was no cook, but the things he did know how to make, he made remarkably well. He was a man of routine.
“Flu,” John whispers, pointing to a man in his 30s wearing a striped jumper and clutching a pack of tissues for dear life.
They picked at the cheese board in comfortable silence (John shoveling the food down, whereas Sherlock merely grazed), feeding Earl pieces of prosciutto and salami every few bites. When Sherlock took a bite of a strawberry, John looked on to Sherlock’s lips, transfixed. A trail of red juice leaked down his chin, and John ached to lean across the island and lick it off.
“Are having an affair?” Sherlock finished for her, and he looked back to Iris and Amy, new deductions springing up confirming his suspicions. By their familiarity but inability to conceal their relationship in a public space, it was rather new. Sherlock estimated they had been seeing each other for about two months now. Sherlock had previously deduced Iris’s job in the art world- it was clear now she worked for the museum, and the two of them had come here together. “Undoubtedly.”
Poseidon is one
Watson had been away at school, and John had come to London alone. On sight, it was clear that the news of Mrs. Hudson’s passing, as anticipated and intricately prepared for as it had been, had wrecked him.
And with that, Sherlock switched into case mode. The game was on.
John stopped chewing and glanced to Rosie then back at him. “No. Sherlock, you know I-”
John puffs up. “Your turn. Switch places.” John plops on the bed next to Sherlock, who climbs over him dramatically, stopping to run a hand over his chest and plant an open-mouthed kiss on John’s nipple.
John spoke around a bite of chicken. “Two.”
38. Like most cases Holmes takes on (and this puzzle, I hope)
John reaches for the lube and coats his fingers generously. “Good boy.” He positions himself behind Sherlock on his side, most of his weight on his right elbow. He plants kisses along Sherlock’s spine and moves his fingers down to Sherlock’s cleft.
John needed to change the subject before this became too revealing. “It’s good to see you too, Molly,” he said with a bit of cheek. He knew she’d been avoiding him; Greg had told him so just yesterday morning at breakfast. “When did you get here?”
“So I’ll be living the rest of my life in
him!”
“No?”
The lift
John looked whiplashed. “Hm?”
“Rugby players often have unresolved anger issues. Aggravated temperaments. Perhaps one of your teammates is our poisoner.” Sherlock smiled fakely. John tensed. “You have an awful habit of finding and associating with the most dangerous people in any room.”
“I do it all the time,” Sherlock said, and John grit his teeth in order not to bite back with a response.
It was her missing backpack.
“For the honour of Greyskull” is her catchphrase
He reached around to take Sherlock in hand, stroking in time. To this, Sherlock responded enthusiastically, funneling John’s attention solely to the connection of their hands and bodies. “Faster,” Sherlock breathed, reaching behind himself to tug on John’s shoulder. God yeah, that was it. John nearly flattened himself against Sherlock’s back, tugging on Sherlock’s cock with one hand, and gripping his hip with the other, guiding him closer, closer, faster, faster. He was riding high and so, so close.
Sherlock smiled. “Don’t worry, John. I don’t see it in your future.”
“This looks delicious, Sherlock. You really didn’t have to go to all this trouble.”
“I love you, John,” he said. He didn’t want to say the words too much, for fear that they would become meaningless, and they were far from it. They were so meaningful, in fact, they’d taken root in Sherlock’s subconscious twenty-something years ago and slowly infected his brain and his body so every cell had been converted. “Good?”
. Right. That line of thinking was strewn with thorns and led nowhere. Sherlock had dismissed the very idea of them being involved just that morning, and Rosie was grasping at straws. Sherlock undoubtedly gave her the accessory to show off; to prove that he could pick out an uncanny match to the shade of white on a dress he’d never seen.
In Sherlock’s room, they tumble onto the bed, John climbing on top of Sherlock and kissing him deeply. Sherlock stretches beneath him, bringing a slow easiness to the kiss. There’s no hurry tonight, so John takes the opportunity to lick his way around Sherlock’s mouth, rolling his hips slightly, teasingly against Sherlock’s thigh. Sherlock arches into the contact, spreading his legs in an invitation.
“Oh! I think-”

“They’re here. Sherlock said they’ll be down in a moment.”
“Yeah? Okay.” He hardly had to think. He didn’t have a shift at the surgery the next day, and honestly, he didn’t want to leave this quiet haven for the bustle of London just yet. “More wine?”
The harsh lights were turned on in the airplane cabin, and Sherlock squinted hard as he opened his eyes to a much less comfortable reality than the one he had been inhabiting in sleep moments ago. His shirt was clumsily untucked, his legs were splayed out long underneath the seat in front of him, and the haziness of slumber fogged his senses. John was looking at him strangely.
he didn’t say.
“hard to deal with, this past year. This past week. Yesterday. But I want to work for this. I want to be a man worthy of you,” John confesses. The expression on Sherlock’s face is so loving, so open, John doesn’t know if he’ll ever be worthy of Sherlock Holmes. But god, he wants to try to be, with everything he has.
Sherlock rises again, coming to stand over John, the light from the window shrouding his dark figure in a soft glow. He extends a hand to John, who takes it, pulling Sherlock into his lap. The detective grunts in surprise.
His pulse quickened. “Moran? As in-”
He’d considered many times coming out to Rosie, in his own way, but the whole thing seemed terribly awkward. There were so many new terms these days, he would likely butcher his own sexuality label. What was he supposed to say? “I also like men. For the last twenty-some years, one man in particular.”
What's the name of the game?
He was tetchy, as he always was when he thought about Sherlock the night before. He had gone against his standing rule that after so much time, Sherlock was no longer allowed in his masturbatory fantasies. Last night, he decided, had been extenuating circumstances. There was only so much he could prevent when the subject was begging for attention at every turn.
John squirms in his seat. “God, yeah. I’m an arse for waiting until yesterday to say all that, but yeah, I did.”
Sherlock enough- to talk through this. He stepped back into Sherlock’s space, and John saw a ripple of surprise cross the man’s face before he could hide it. “I don’t want a woman. I don’t want any other person. I want you. And I want you because I
John refilled their glasses with the cabernet sauvignon. He revelled in the simplicity of sharing Sherlock’s company again. He felt like he had finally finished an enormous crossword puzzle that had been sitting on his bedside table for far too long, and now he could relax in its completeness. John put down his wine glass and crossed the fireplace to Sherlock’s chair. “May I join you?”
The flirty flight attendant served them breakfast, a rather sad tray with a foil-wrapped omelette and cut-up fruit, Sherlock’s with a wink. John puffed up at that, which only made Sherlock cheer inwardly. All the signs of jealousy were there.

John took his hand off Sherlock’s thigh as he made a sharp turn, giving his cognition time to partially recover.
It was the sight of John choking back a sob during Molly’s speech that was the unspooling of Sherlock’s restraint.
Rosie exhaled. “I may have done something reckless.”
12:46pm
Stella laughed loudly (by Stella’s standards) at something Yasmin said, holding her glass in a toast, and turned to Rosie. “Don’t worry. I only wanted to try a few sips--you know how much I love a good red.” Rosie kissed her and held up her own Moscow mule. She couldn’t resist wrapping an arm around her fiancée. Despite the bumps in the day, all felt right in Rosie’s world.
Sherlock studied him for a moment. “Not yet. But I can’t do it forever, John. It’s not sustainable.” He looked down, and John had a feeling this was the first time Sherlock had admitted it out loud. Sherlock had never wanted to believe that he was a captive of his human body’s needs or desires, and giving up the work was the ultimate sacrifice.
John blushed. Staring up at the man he’d loved for thirty years who’d just agreed to marry him, John decided it really, really was.
So this was their appointment in Samarra.
Sherlock’s hand had slowed over John, lost in his own pleasure, but now his focus shifted solely to bringing John to orgasm.
The figure stopped briefly, turning his ear toward Rosie with a distinct felinity. Apparently deciding she was worth answering, he turned. He looked different from the picture Rosie had come to know best- her mum in a wedding dress, Dad and Sherlock in morning coats and top-hats. He looked older, with greying hair, spectacles atop his nose, and a few more wrinkles along his crescent eyes than Rosie had remembered from the photograph, but it was certainly Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective.
But the rightness of it was also terrifying. This case, this trip, had to go perfectly. His friendship with John teetered on it. His brain teemed with ideas of how he could make their time in Taiwan edgier, riskier, more interesting for John without forcing him make the (wrong) conclusion that it was no longer responsible for him to be living this lifestyle. Sherlock had seen the thought cross John’s face 216 times, and each one of them dug a little deeper. It was the most prominent reason for why John hadn’t moved back into 221B, the invisible rope that kept John at arm’s length, tethered to his abysmal flat.
John kissed him again, his lips so warm and supple and achingly familiar, it was a test of will to stay stiff against them, but he was resolute. John pulled away, and he could feel the question coming before John asked it.
takes their IDs and simply instructs them to sit and wait.
“Let’s pace ourselves,” Rosie whispered in Stella’s ear. “We’ve got our hen parties after this, remember, and who knows what kind of shenanigans our friends have planned.”
“It’s non-negotiable.”
as a solo singer and songwriter, and she had been taking some much-needed vacation to spend time at home before she was due to go on tour this fall, before she left home for a very long time. It had been two weeks since she’d seen Stella, who couldn’t take off work in London to join Rosie until today.
“Yes,” said John. He’d have to give his notice to the surgery, but otherwise, there wasn’t much keeping him in London anymore. Earl would love the space, and, well, John would love the company.
Sherlock was too distracted by the deductions popping up in his head about her desk job, possibly in the art world, her dual residency in the UK and Taiwan, and her pet corgi to respond. Her face was starting to drop disappointedly when John intervened, “Er, thanks. Enjoy the rest of your flight. Breakfast should be coming shortly.” It was dismissive but not rude- John could be
is Sherlock?
Sherlock froze, and for a moment, John worried he’d caused Sherlock to picture some traumatizing image of himself sweaty, old, and covered in mud. “Say that again, John.”
John nodded curtly. “I’ll need a first aid kit.”
John swallowed, putting his plate and fork on the small table next to his beer. Then, to Sherlock’s horror, he started laughing. Not the full, wheezing, belly laugh that Sherlock had stored deeply and fondly in his mind palace, but a resigned, ridiculing chuckle. “Tomorrow? Good, yeah, let me just put my entire life on hold to run away to Asia. God, Sherlock. No. I can’t. I can’t do that.” He rubbed his brow between his thumb and forefinger. Working himself up, he stood. The position was reminiscent of their conversation on his birthday at the beginning of the year. That had ended in a hug and cake- why couldn’t this?
“What’s wrong?”
“Sod the paper!” she yelled, and Daddy gave her that warning look that said

Two of Mycroft’s people entered, and Sherlock compared them against the pictures Mycroft had texted as confirmation. One of them ordered Sherlock, John, and Xiaowen to leave, and Sherlock was grateful John couldn’t understand Chinese. He never did well with bureaucratic authority.
He waved off John’s concern. “Oh yeah, Molly’s great. Just lovely.”
“Christ, that was good,” John mumbles against Sherlock’s skin. He tastes a salty mix of sweat and semen.
He trusted Rosie’s judgment. Rosie was happy. That’s all he cared about.
For tonight, though, all she wanted to do was celebrate being here, with Dad, Sherlock, and Stella.
She pulled away. “Safe travels,” she said, steeling herself to approach Amy across the room. “Wish me luck, here, guys.”
Watson’s brow raised. “Dad never told me I’d been to Paris as a toddler.”
. Hanging up now.”
“Most people don’t celebrate Christmas in the traditional sense here, but decorations and Christmas songs are popular,” Sherlock said, answering John’s unasked question. “Thus, the Christmas bears.” They popped into the 7-eleven store attached to the station for some much-needed water and temporary Taiwan SIM cards, and the cashier was even wearing a Christmas hat.
Sherlock leapt forward. “Don’t! She can’t know you suspect her. If it
“Okay. Tell me about the case.” Sherlock took a breath to launch into the details, but John had a caveat, “And Sherlock, if it’s anything like a case of a glow-in-the-dark rabbit I swear I will wring Mycroft’s neck.”
He nodded. The bedroom. Yes. That was a good suggestion. Very good.
Sherlock turned to John. “He wants to take our picture. Is that alright?”
As the amber of tea leaves mixed with the steaming water, he ached for that sense of home he was seemingly incapable of creating without John.
1:16pm
He felt a stab of hurt somewhere deep in his chest. He couldn’t help but feel like he’d been downgraded from an ex-best friend to an estranged acquaintance only invited to mandatory functions. At least there was
It was delicious- light and flavorful with hints of a floral aroma on his tongue. The perfect temperature, it was smooth going down his throat. He expected to feel a great shift, for something to happen, but nothing.
Sherlock nodded curtly, hoping he’d move the cart along if Sherlock refused to engage.
She regarded him for a moment. John had obviously heard her speaking to Sherlock, and was looking for a way in. Molly’s loyalties were with Sherlock, and she didn’t know how much Sherlock would want John to know about his life now. She wondered if John even knew that he had moved out of London.
“Sherlock, I know this is bloody awful timing, at my sister’s funeral. But she deserves to know. She knew, all the time, Sherlock. She knew me. Harry understood me better than she had a right to. Sherlock, I love you. I love you so much.” His voice catches and it turns into a sob, and somehow Sherlock is there, dragging him off the podium and out of the church. John lets him. He is completely numb.
A week in London passed quickly. Scotland Yard was inundated with post-holiday cases, and Sherlock spent his days with Lestrade. John was back at the surgery after holiday break. The only thing that had changed was that John was spending nights at 221B, Rosie tucked in his old bedroom. He still had his old flat, though, and occasionally returned there for clothes and items for Rosie.
John chuckled. “Good one.” He hadn’t done Rosie’s hair in years. After a rather unfortunate Dad-DIY haircut, she learned quickly how to do her own hair in the face of his incompetence with her mess of curls.
Sherlock groaned. “Your train of thought is louder than those gulls,” he said, rolling over onto his back, propping himself up on his elbows. And John had to admit that the display of Sherlock’s cock, plump and wanting, helped to silence a few of his anxious voices. “Stop overthinking. Your best decisions have always been your most impulsive,” he assured, and John leaned forward to capture his lips in a kiss. As always, Sherlock was right. In John’s life, the decisions he’d perseverated on for far too long were the ones he’d made wrong (Never telling Sherlock he loved him before he jumped. Marrying Mary), and the ones he’d been thrown into were the rightest paths (Meeting and moving in with Sherlock. Having Rosie).
“I just...can’t believe we’re doing this. After so long.”
better than adequate.”
Watson was rapt. Sherlock finished the retelling with the bit about how John’s terrible French made them late for their return train, and she howled with laughter, causing a few of the other patrons to turn and stare. Sherlock spotted two Rosie fans in the bunch, their gazes lingering seconds too long in recognition, then excitement. He’d come to know the look well during the height of his internet fame.
“There are no sexual health concerns, on my end,” Sherlock said, pulling back. “I’m clean. You?”
John lays against the down pillow behind him and takes his cock in hand. “You’re beautiful, Sherlock. I love watching you like this.”
John would spend the next few hours watching crap telly, checking his watch and his phone (in that order) intermittently. At 11, John would start wondering if he should just go to bed. At 11:35pm, George would text John to buzz him into the building. John would welcome him into the flat with a glass of wine (John couldn’t let go of the pretense of romance), and they would start kissing before they finished them. Wet, sloppy kissing would morph into hurried fucking, George on his knees, face-first in the bedsheets, or on the couch. Once in the kitchen. John would take, and take, and take and it would feel deliciously wrong pounding into a younger man with wild, dark brown hair whose body he often imagined belonged to another. George didn’t mind- he once told John that he didn’t care who he was thinking about, as long as John kept fucking him like that.
, she would say). Probably driving, then.
Mike was the only friend from Before that John regularly kept in touch with, and their conversations were fleeting at best. It had been months since he had last seen the other doctor. It had been at least a year since he’d stepped foot near West Smithfield. John sparingly texted Greg only when the thought occurred, which it hadn’t lately.
These two men squabbling over the validity of her and Stella’s choices as if they weren’t there was the epitome of stripping them of their autonomy.
Elevated pulse. Dilated pupils. Genuine (rare) smile. All the signs were there.
In the precious waking seconds before his eyes fluttered open, John heard the chatter of sea birds outside his window and a ruffle of sheets beside him. A ruffle of sheets?
This display did not answer any of her questions. In fact, it just made her more curious. Gesturing toward the bench across the street, she offered for the pair of them to sit down. John began walking there without a word.
A lover or a friend?
Harry was supposed to be here, too.
John nodded, giving Mike his most convincing smile. If it seemed like he was doing well, John thought, he was a better actor than he gave himself credit for.
Rosie sipped on the latte, her mind wandering to conversations she’d had with Stella of their families.
Stella hiding some deep, dark secret?
“Ta.”
A flash of pity crossed her face before it turned soft. “Will you?” she urged, already turning around in the stool to face the vanity.
“Sir, as I’ve said, it’s clear that you have a
He moaned into John’s neck. He kept grinding into John’s groin, looking for friction.
“I’ll get dressed properly, then let’s go.” John looked up to see Sherlock smiling goofily down at him. John kissed him because he could, grabbed his clothes bag, and paused by the stairs. “I love you, Sherlock.” He couldn’t stop saying it.
“Then I remembered Xiaowen’s Christmas gift.” John nervously rubbed his hands down his thighs over his jeans.
Sherlock reached for the handle, his legs still tied, and swung open the door. “Not quite,” he clarified, and he realized for the first time since he’d woken that his throat was unbelievably dry. The words came out high and scratchy, but it got the room’s attention.
Laughing in the rain
hurting him. It’s clear to everyone around us- I think even Mrs. Hudson is starting to resent me, and I don’t blame her. I’ve decided: I have to leave Baker Street. I love him too much to go on killing him like this. I’ve shut down the blog. The last remnants of it are here, in this journal. Keep it safe.”
Sherlock’s affection quickly transformed into annoyance. “Watson, please. Do not lecture me on matters you do not understand.”
people got to witness the payoff to all your hopeless pining when I’ve been the one dealing with it for so long.”
He knew now- of course not.
John looked like he was punched in the chest. Quite deservedly, actually. Sherlock had taken a bullet there.
"Sometimes I wish that I could freeze the picture

Emil’s cheery boom of a voice echoed through the gardens, and Dad pulled Sherlock into him before Emil’s mouth closed around the last consonant. He kissed Sherlock a few moments longer than was socially acceptable with a tender vulnerability so rare from him, Rosie swore she was dreaming.
At the funeral, John had looked pale and sallow, like he hadn’t eaten a full meal since he got the phone call from Sherlock.
Sherlock tugged on their joined hands, nearly yanking John off the ground. His knees protested, but his heart was rather agreeable. John stood with a huff that landed on Sherlock’s lips.
Much more interesting.
John reached for the cup and took a sip. By the look on John’s face, it was scalding.
?! No, no, no.” Sherlock was getting the wrong impression. As wrong as he could be, in fact. “I don’t really go in for that sort of thing anymore.”
trusted her, for god’s sake.
Sherlock’s hands slid down John’s forearms. “Then don’t.” His eyes darted to John’s lips, and suddenly, Sherlock was kissing him.

“I see you worked it out, then,” she said with a hint of sadness. “Amy and I are done. Staying over was just…”
Harry’s dead.
“Do you want to be?” Iris asked, and Sherlock stopped breathing. It was a question he’d been asking silently, pondering constantly, and avoiding awkwardly for years now. A question he simultaneously ached to know the answer for but worked tirelessly to keep hidden. And Iris had just...asked him. It seemed perverse, to whittle the last few years of his existence down into five words from a mouth that wasn’t his. It was criminal to take this from him.
The attendant was good-looking, and after giving him a once-over of Sherlock’s own, he deduced that the man flirted with passengers in business class quite often. Sherlock knew that, if he wanted, he could have the man in the loo with just a look, a nod.  But he didn’t want. Well, not in the way that he found the man particularly attractive to his own taste, or felt the need for sex. But...
“It was a joke,” Sherlock sighed, but his cheeks flushed.
“What’s not to like?” Sherlock’s voice is relaxed, unbothered. John loves this post-coital Sherlock. “She’s been pleasant enough these past few days.”
The reception’s about to start. I’d really like you to be there.
“Stop.”
He was rather a lonely kind of man. His childhood had been rigid, his stiff parents not prone to displays of affection. In his teenage years, there had been social loneliness; his rugby teammates had iced him out after the goalie caught him snogging the football team captain behind the school- the
John waved a dismissive hand, seeing the thought cross Sherlock’s eyes. “I bought it after you died. It’s very simple, but-”
Not even subtext
She clutched her violin case. “You’re proud of me?” Her voice was small, uncertain. It tore at his unsteady heart.
“Oh, Sherlock, you look quite fit!” Mrs. Hudson cheers as she situates Rosie in the pram with a cuddly toy. She points excitedly at Sherlock and shouts “Bwack!”
Rosie didn’t answer as she pulled into the parking lot of the Crown Hotel and turned off the ignition, the air going still in the car. Stella looked at her expectantly, her nose wrinkling in a small tell of worry.
“I wuv you,” Rosie says fondly, waving her hedgehog cuddly toy at Sherlock, who freezes.
” The way Sherlock said his brother’s name had always held unparalleled disdain- it was quite impressive, really. “What the hell are you doing here?”

“I choose you, Sherlock,” John said, hoping to god that Sherlock knew he meant it. John slot their fingers together, Sherlock’s long violin fingers sliding electrically through his own. “I choose you.”
“It’s okay to miss her, you know,” Sherlock says, breaking the silence. “You’re human.”
“Let me,” Molly steps in before Sherlock can respond. Rosie’s cries had attracted more attention from the party guests than he’d thought. Sherlock hands the now-sleepy toddler over to Molly, who kisses her on the forehead. “It’s been too long, I’ve been dying to spend some quality time with this one. Sherlock, why don’t you go with John? The rest of us can pick up a bit.” She looks expectantly at Sherlock. John sees something unspoken pass between the two of them, and Sherlock nods. “I know where all her supplies are. Rosie and I will be here when you get back, won’t we?” Molly smiles, talking more to Rosie than John. She taps Rosie’s nose and the toddler squeals in tinkly laughter.
“What if what, John?” Sherlock’s eyes pleaded with him, and in that moment, John knew they wanted the same thing. Maybe Sherlock didn’t know how to say it with words, but he had already said it today with a silver dog bowl, hands through hair, hand-picked soaps, and rosemary bread.
“Indeed.”
He chewed on his thumbnail as he studied the man in front of him. “In the nature of full disclosure. Yes.”
many people could be after it. I’m just not sure how anyone would have found out what it does, or that I was going to be on that very train that day.”
“She needs to go for a walk,” John mumbled from the centre of Sherlock’s chest.
Sherlock cut at the rope while Xiaowen listened and John manned the guard.
She glances between them, recognition dancing in her eyes before her features sink in sympathy. “John, I’m so sorry. She’s dead.”
Sherlock’s mobile buzzed: an incoming call from Mycroft.
“Sherlock Holmes.”
“What would I be apologizing for?” It wasn’t an off-handed, dismissive remark. A challenge, then.
John said a silent thanks to the universe that Rosie was alright. Before John could tell her that he was, coincidentally, already at the hospital, Sherlock stole his phone out of his hand. The bastard!
At this, John let out a high-pitched moan and rutted into Sherlock’s hand. “Oh my
The moment they saw each other, an unspoken agreement for a cease-fire for the weekend passed between them. In the depths of their grief, they hardly needed decade-old tensions weighing on them. Sherlock walked carefully across the stuffy room, dodging Mrs. Hudson’s friends and family to make his way into John’s orbit.
Silence. Again.
“Here are your keys,” the owner, Weixian, said as he passed them over the counter to Sherlock.

He studied her, pointing his chin and flexing his left hand, the display a small tell of emotion underneath his blasé exterior. “I…” he started, and Rosie should’ve known he’d be as hopeless at this as she was. “I have something for you.” He pulled a small box from his bag of things he’d brought with him from home and handed it to her. The white box had a picture of a phone on the cover.

She felt the deployment of the needle and instantly the carriage began to spin. Oh
“Motivated by Mummy’s insistence, yes. She asked me to personally congratulate the happy couple on her behalf.” The man leaned on his umbrella, tipping his chin and smiling toothlessly. John had always found Sherlock’s parents rather endearing, and he was happy to hear Mummy Holmes was still alive and kicking. God, he and Sherlock had
“Really?” He sounded like a kid being offered an ice lolly. But
He gestured for Sherlock to join him, taking a sip of a dark, red wine. It left a stain on his top lip, and John tried to lick it away. Sherlock sank into the soft leather next to him. This John, unlike the original, moved closer, sliding a hand over Sherlock’s. He stared at it in perplexity.
Sherlock’s smile betrayed him at Harry’s mention of “family.” He’d thought of John as such for longer than he’d care to admit, but now they’d signed the papers: he was officially a Watson. For six seemingly innocuous letters added to his name, the emotional weight they carried was elephantine. “Quite unexpectedly, it seems.”
“Well,” he said, putting up walls that even John would not be able to climb. “I’m glad you found your orgasm satisfactory, but you should be going.” Direct, but polite. Hearing it from his own mouth was hateful.
His cheeks must’ve turned an alarming shade of pink. “Sorry, uh. Hello.”
“Fascinating! That’s brilliant, John!” Sherlock clapped his hands together, drawing the attention of several passengers around him. The HSR had a strict low-noise policy, and a few other riders shot him dirty looks. John sat back, cocking his head in confusion.
“I’m just going to-” John stood, pointing to where the serviettes were sitting on the buffet table. He already looked like a slob at the table with Sherlock, who could’ve walked off the set of a photoshoot to get here. John needed to clean the tea stain off his jumper before people assumed he was Sherlock’s charity case. But picking up a serviette triggered a vivid memory of Sherlock sitting on the floor of 221B surrounded by an array of intricately folded Sydney Opera Houses.
Sherlock thought he might resent this place, the home that stole John away from him for twenty years, but he found he couldn’t. It was so quintessentially John in the way that 221B was so quintessentially Sherlock, he couldn’t help but fall in love with its rustic charm. All old furniture, wooden cabinets and a desk, soft, inviting blankets strewn about the sitting room.
But he had scientifically been proven wrong. The tea quite literally didn’t lie.

Sherlock smiled in acknowledgement, but continued as if John hadn’t said anything. “I have everything I need here. But I admit, more recently I’ve had time to think about the life I want to have, going forward.” He fidgeted with his hands, placing them on his lap, then together under his chin, on the armrests, and finally, shifting forward in his seat, they landed on top of his knees. John also shifted forward. “After evaluating all possible scenarios, I’ve decided that my life will be considerably better with you...in it.”
John remembers asking Sherlock to stay. But he’s not here, now.
“Mmm,” Sherlock hummed, turning to capture the source of the breath with his lips. Their lips lingered there, barely kissing, just breathing into the other’s space. “Husband.”
Sherlock had forgotten the date amid the time zone shift and the case. His logical brain knew dates were arbitrary, but he despised the idea of starting the year with the shattering realization that John would never want him.
“You need a shower,” John said, though he didn’t particularly care about the mess. He brought his lips back to Sherlock’s.
“You’re beautiful,” whispered Stella as Rosie reached her.
She read the letter over a few times, trying to read it in Dad’s voice. She desperately wanted to write more, but Dad’s words echoed again in her head: “Only lies have detail.” When she was satisfied with the succinct John Watson-ness of the letter, she checked her watch. 5:05pm. Dad would just be getting out of work at the surgery, likely headed for a pint. He was so tediously predictable; she had some time. She glanced toward the door, listening for the wheels of Dad’s car on the drive, just in case. Upon hearing none, she hit print, and pulled herself out the depths of the armchair.
“Shame it isn’t. I’d love to watch.”
John was just dipping a sweet potato chip in chipotle aioli when Stamford asked the question he knew had been coming. Stamford asked it every time they saw each other, as if he still held out hope for the two of them. It just made John cringe. “So, have you, uh, spoken to...Sherlock at all?” John paused mid-bite to give an almost imperceptible shake of his head. Stamford retreated immediately. “Sorry, mate. I should stop asking. None of my business. Just curious, is all.” Stamford’s usually cheery face went red with embarrassment.

“He was my very best friend. Can you imagine if someone was after Jamie?” Rosie shook her head. That was a terrible thought. “Well, it was like that. My very best friend was going to be killed. And since your mum was so very smart, she figured it out before anyone else.” He took a breath. “She died to, um, save him.”
There was decidedly more than generosity behind Mycroft’s offer, but Sherlock kept his thoughts about that unvoiced. “In London?” he asked, secretly hoping. He imagined Xiaowen coming round for tea, maybe even helping on cases. John had been right- he liked her.
Sherlock caught John looking at him out of the corner of his eye with a curious expression, as if he was trying to parse him out. Sherlock himself was wondering if John would oppose the weight of his head on John’s shoulder. Best not to find out.
It was probably the drinking.
John’s breath on his neck felt shockingly real. He swallowed. Focus. What was John’s game here? “You’re being ridiculous, you know.”
John knew he had been given TD-12 in his recovery in hospital. He was bound to discover he had really been shot (in his previously-good shoulder and not his face, thanks to Sherlock’s last-minute intervention). The doctors had officially declared the treatment to be mandated by the British government due to state secrets, but John had guessed at Mycroft’s involvement- it wasn’t too difficult a deductive leap- and their friendship suffered for it. John didn’t trust himself around Sherlock, still haunted by fake memories of his own making. Sherlock didn’t know how to make a life with this John, but he also knew he couldn’t make one without him.
John groans, and takes the paracetamol. He closes his eyes and tries to listen for Sherlock puttering in the kitchen, or playing violin. It’s eerily silent.
John Watson was no hairdresser.
John yawned and stretched in an obvious display. Xiaowen took the hint and stood. “Sorry, I know you both must be tired from jet lag. I just have one last thing.” She pulled a bag out of her back pocket. Sherlock recognized the smell. It was the truth tea.
I want that, too,” Stella whispered into her lips. She pulled back, her entire face lit with the exhilaration of knowing, and being known. “Let’s just be together, learn about each other. There’s so much we both don’t know yet.”
You do. Or do you not remember how much I fucking

“And I want it.” She thumbs at her necklace nervously. “It’s where Harry and I lived for years. I’ve been renting a dingy flat for years now, and Harry’s place is sentimental. I feel...safe there.” She pauses, evaluating John and Sherlock’s expressions. She anxiously chews on her plump bottom lip. When she finds nothing shocking, she continues, “John, I know it’s a lot to ask. But Mycroft said you might be amenable, and he offered to make it so-”
“Harry loved taking risks, and she loved taking me along. Once, she planned an elaborate scheme to set off a stink bomb in school, and we had lessons cancelled for three days. She always knew how to get what she wanted in the craziest way possible. She was a risk-taking mastermind...until the end.” The room turns somber.
Rosie still had doubts. “But what if- what if the person who did that to you is
About 3 months ago, Molly went out for a pint (or three) with her boyfriend, Daniel (not from work
By the set of his jaw, Sherlock was getting frustrated, too. “I don’t know what you’re implying.”
John stilled, and Sherlock was petrified that he’d said the wrong thing. In the pause, his mind was rapidly catching up to his body. Luckily, John spoke before the race got too close.
With a gun in hand, John’s entire demeanor shifted to embody a soldier. His voice took on that familiar rough quality that left no room to question it. “Xiaowen, untie me,” he said, not breaking eye contact with the security guard, his grip on the gun unwavering.
“John. I haven’t touched the stuff in years. Didn’t work out so well last time,” Sherlock gave John a meaningful look. “Moving out of London has helped. My brain doesn’t need to work so fast here.”
Aunt Harry let out a “Hear, hear!” from the audience, met only with questioning stares.
Sherlock huffs. “You mean to ask if I’ve had sex with other people, yes?”
He gaped. “Rosie, what’s gotten into you?”
. It had taken some convincing, but as soon as Mycroft agreed to wrangle Sherlock into a rehabilitation program after he left, John packed up his and Rosie’s things and left 221B for good.
Sherlock’s look says
“But really, Sherlock. It’s sooo obvious, everyone can see it. I can’t believe you--
“Like lavender. And sandalwood. And tea tree.” John inhaled again. “You use such posh bath product, the smell lasts for hours.”
“It’s good to see you, John,” said Sherlock, far too casually. John stepped back to study him, on his way to fully believing that he was actually here. The years showed themselves in roots of grey in what John assumed to be dyed auburn hair (curls coiffed as ever), in lines on his face, in a softness around his middle. The detective still knew how to suck all the air out of John’s lungs, to absorb all the energy in a room so that he was the only thing worth paying attention to. Sherlock Holmes, on the Isle of Man, in the flesh. That train of thought led back to the question humming as background noise since he heard Sherlock’s voice, why was he here?
John sniffed in annoyance. “Xiaowen, hand me my pants. I’ve a sudden need to smack him.”
“So you plan to keep being indecent, then?” John’s tongue wet his lips.
12:34pm
Sherlock nods. “Please,” he breathes. It’s all the confirmation John needs to rub at Sherlock’s entrance and slide a finger inside, then two, stretching him until Sherlock gasps, squirming underneath him, pushing back against John’s fingers. “More, John.”
not you. You barely have a scratch. They had access to classified information and a well-organized plan. They could have tried to kidnap or kill you, but they didn’t.”
“The man doesn’t know what’s real and what’s not. We can’t have any potential risks on this mission. And I believe John Watson is a personal risk to your own-”
“Okay,” she breathed, pushing down a range of unpleasant reactions. “Edward Shih wasn’t the target. What now?”
“Your mum was so smart, Rosie. She’s where you got your big brain from,” he started, and Rosie conjured up the familiar image of mum in her wedding dress, smiling and thinking about difficult things, like science equations or the meaning of life. Rosie wished she were here. Daddy was good with history and writing, but if she was as smart as he said, Mum could’ve even helped her with maths homework. “There was a mean person who wanted to kill someone very important to me.”
“Jesus,” John shook his head disbelievingly. “
Xiaowen closed her eyes in pain, and John shot Sherlock a warning glare. He tilted his head toward Xiaowen, motioning for Sherlock to comfort her or retract his answer or something equally tedious. But Sherlock didn’t need to. Xiaowen accepted the confirmation. She was smart. She had suspected.
“Just for tonight.” Sherlock perks up, unceremoniously climbing off of John's lap and smoothing his pajamas as if they hadn’t just been snogging. “I do hope you intend to fuck me senseless once we’re rested. You have a magnificent cock, and I’ve already enumerated thirty six ways I’d like to use it.”
Clean, efficient, no nonsense.
John blushes, but looking at the mad, glorious, man who somehow loves him, he can’t deny it. “Fair enough.”
you’re so good, and
football team captain. Making and keeping friends had been hard for him after that.
John was weak to this request, and with Sherlock’s fist now flying over him, it was all he could do to nod helplessly in response.

“You’re so brilliant, gorgeous, talented, lovely. Sherlock, I am the luckiest man alive to be able to fuck you like this.”
The attendant took her cherry blossom-themed ticket with a short “謝謝 (xie xie),
He left out the part where John looked at him like this might be the start of something.
12:42pm
John tilted his head in put-upon consideration. “Depends. Is it cliche to say the light from the fireworks is making you look especially…” he paused, unsure of the rightness of the word. “Beautiful?”
1. Watson to Holmes in the ASiP case
Poor Daniel had to hear about these strangers all the way to the next pub.
John’s fingers responded, fumbling with Sherlock’s zip, reaching into his pants, and pulling out his cock, giving it a pull. Their mouths fell open, their joint moans mixing into one. Sherlock’s eyes flung open, shocked to see John was enjoying this just as much as he was- his black trousers were nearly bursting at the zip. Every one of Sherlock’s nerve endings was screaming with relief and pleasure and pure want. His brain, mercifully, said nothing.
John had no earthly idea. It’s not like he and Rosie gossiped over brunch. But whomever it was, he would make sure they got a hand-delivered (or rather, fist-delivered) message never to mess with his future daughter-in-law ever again. He was finding it incredibly difficult to concentrate between bouts of rage towards the mystery assailant and bouts of desire to grab the lapels of the man across the table and kiss him into those bloody floor-to-ceiling windows until he couldn’t remember the word “arsenic.”
“No. You’re right. He was.” John cleared his throat. “A long time ago, that.”
Earl barked from the kitchen. She was hungry, and she would start knocking over furniture soon if she didn’t get her breakfast. Three years earlier, in a moment of weakness, he had adopted the sweetest English springer spaniel in all of the UK and named her Earl, after his favorite kind of tea, of course. The animal shelter had informed him that she had undergone severe neglect and physical trauma with her previous owners, and together, they helped each other heal. Having to care for another living being had given him a purpose after everything in his life disintegrated. He loved her as much as he imagined he would have loved the daughter he once thought was real.
Sherlock rolled onto his side to face John’s bed on the far side of the room. “I had sworn off friends, John. Thought I was above all that. I thought you were mildly interesting enough to keep my attention, and I knew I could be of use to you by giving you some excitement. The idea of you was attractive to me. But no, I hadn’t known that I wanted a friend.”
- recoiled.
“Thanks for helping with the centrepieces,” Stella offered, gesturing to the pile of green ribbons on the floor.
“I know it
John laughed, a resigned, mirthless laugh, and pushed by the woman to exit the carriage. He was letting the emotions of the last 32 hours cloud his judgment. And if he was making a scene on the tube, then so be it. “I’m not signed up for this type of thing anymore, you know. Tell Sher- whoever sent you that I’m not playing this game. I’m not!” He stepped out just as the doors began to close. Letting the swarm of rush hour passengers speed by him, he opened the piece of paper to reveal some sort of code:
happened. I mean, I’ve wanted that for Christ knows how long. I still stand by everything I said, even if I should have said it all in private. I hate to think I pressured you into anything- if you were only letting me- you know- because you think I
Stamford nodded understandingly. He gave John a meaningful look. John fidgeted, flexing his fingers under the table. John ached to ask,
“She’s correct,” Mrs. Liu said evenly into the microphone. Everyone in the vicinity was leaning forward in their shoes and in their seats. Rosie wouldn’t be surprised if this turned out to be the scandal of the month:
“Sherlock Holmes. I’m a man who’s loved you for thirty years,” he started, and Sherlock’s blinks came faster. He vaguely registered some soft gasps and faint cheers from the people around him, but his focus was solely on this inexplicable novelty of a man, on articulating his feelings for him in a way he’d never been able to. “And I’ve never been good at it, but ever since the day I met you, I’ve been trying to tell you how much I love you.”
“Well. I hope you’ve enjoyed your prized life,” Sherlock spat with an air of finality, gesturing toward the remains of John’s breakfast. He sat and crossed his legs, finished with this line of conversation.
“Don’t have to,” John chuckled, turning smoothly down the next gravel drive, leading to a darkened, unassuming single story home facing the coast. John parked the car, and let the hushed stillness of the late evening sink in between them before opening the car door, nodding toward the house. “Come on, then.”
And John didn’t mind. He was used to Sherlock watching him. It’s possible he even enjoyed it.
Understanding flashed in John’s eyes, and Sherlock pulled John into himself, gripping him by the waist. John’s understanding morphed into want as he sunk into Sherlock, and the two of them crashed their mouths together like they hadn’t been able to do all evening.
Sherlock covered the back of John’s hand on his thigh with his own. “You take time to process these things. You’ve only had a few hours, and most of that was occupied with thoughts of me.”
It took him a minute to look away from his old friend’s face, to process that Sherlock had his lanky upper limbs wrapped around Stella in a...was that supposed to be a hug?
it wear off? Or- ah!
“That’s it, love, let go,” John’s voice turns sweet, and Sherlock lets out a low moan and comes in bursts over his chest. John’s eyes darken. He focuses on the sensations: Sherlock, pliable after orgasm around his cock, lean and muscular under his fingers, breathing heavily, hair wild against the white pillow.
Sherlock didn’t answer, instead returning his full attention to the microscope. He was probably just fiddling with the bloody taps to avoid conversation. “Sherlock,” he pushed. John desperately wanted- needed- answers.
Apparently, it needed not a single caveat or explanation.
John actually groaned, and the sound went right to Sherlock’s groin. He’d thought John’s current state far from his own arousal, but was it possible John was turned on by the sound of their joint names? John’s voice dropped lower. “Say it again.” His fingers gripped his thigh as if he was diffusing oxygen from it, and Sherlock was happy to provide.
The words cut through Sherlock’s nerves, distilled them into the realization that Sherlock was genuinely happy, too. He’d nearly forgotten what that felt like. “Let’s go inside.”
“You were married to a Watson. You know they tend to romanticize things a bit,” Sherlock shoots a challenging look at John, who only runs his tongue over his bottom lip in response.
John can read the question in that. “You wouldn’t have been. Disturbing me, I mean.” He turns around, and Sherlock takes his hands off his shoulders. John misses the contact immediately.
Xiaowen opened her mouth to protest, but Sherlock wouldn’t let her. “Now,” he hushed, and she rolled her eyes, but stuffed the clothing inside her green jumper and held her hands over her stomach.
What if they try something again? I don’t want anything to happen to you.”
Stella reached over to place a comforting hand on Rosie’s thigh and squeezed. “This is big, Rose,” her voice was soft, smooth as honey in her morning tea. “Why’ve you been holding onto this since April? You just needed some time to think it over?”
A miscalculation. John followed him and pulled at the tails of Sherlock’s half-tucked shirt, dragging him back a few steps. John’s grip was forceful enough to stop him from getting any ideas about pushing against it.
“So, how are things? Are you still at Bart’s?” John asked, and Molly scrambled to put her mobile away.
John sipped his tea, prepared just as he’s always liked it. “It certainly seems like it. The house is quite lovely.” Sherlock put his cup and saucer on the stand next to him and shifted in his chair so his jumper rode up to show a bit of his stomach, now a bit softer than John remembered. John stared, fixated by that patch of smooth skin. “Quite...lovely.”
could Sherlock blame him? Ever since Sherlock pushed his arse in those damn black trousers back against John’s crotch ten years ago (and if he was being honest with himself, years before that), he’d wondered. He’d wondered if he could ever have that, if Sherlock had ever thought about it, if he’d ever want it. If Sherlock would ever want it the other way round, too. “
She stuffed the letter, along with her wedding invitation, into an envelope, and made her way to the Douglas post office.
Stella smiled, and Rosie couldn’t help but mirror her. “Can’t believe that was four years ago. At that sketchy underground bar, of all places,” Stella laughed. Rosie remembered the night well.
He gave John a questioning tip of his head. “You like her,” he said, almost a whisper.
Sherlock’s eyes sparkle in the afternoon sun beaming into the flat. “Agreed, John.”
John went still. “Ah.”
John let his annoyance show for a moment before realizing that was Sherlock’s goal. “I panicked, when I couldn’t find Iris. Somehow she slipped away without me noticing.”
Molly knew exactly what Sherlock meant, and she had to bite her lip to stop herself from audibly sighing.
He nodded, not able to hide a chuckle. John looked surprised at the question, as if no one had asked him about his private life in a long time. She knew he had once been used to Sherlock, who never had to ask. Molly realized that was probably one of the qualities John had liked most about Sherlock. One could always count on Sherlock’s hatred of chatting about the trivialities of dating, social circles, and parties. John was also the sort of man who hated that kind of talk; he was just better at hiding his disinterest.
I'm no professional, and I know this cryptic breaks a few of the cardinal rules of puzzle-making, so no need to remind me that 2 letter words ~technically~ violate crossword regulation- this is just a bit of fun.
Ugh. Rosie crossed her arms in defiance. “Well, who was the person who was important to you?”
He knew that sentiment all too well. “Now that you’re getting married, he’ll have to make some of his own adventures. Otherwise he’ll punch through the walls out of boredom.” He didn’t dare make the same mistake that
“You cook now, too?” John asked playfully, walking into the kitchen area and leaning against the granite-topped island. Sherlock’s eyes scanned his body, and John tightened the belt on Sherlock’s too-large dressing gown. He had cursed himself getting out of the bath for forgetting to bring his bag of extra clothes into the bathroom, but after putting on Sherlock’s luxurious dressing gown over his undershirt and pants, John was grateful for the soft fabric. Sherlock had offered it to him, after all. Earl rushed to greet her freshly-bathed human, sniffing curiously at John’s use of different soap.
“John,” Sherlock started, his name tasting like warmth and home and pleasure on his tongue. John’s face was buried in the crook of Sherlock’s neck, now, and he made a questioning noise against it that vibrated through the space around Sherlock’s collarbone.
“You consider me part of your family?” Sherlock asks. It’s so hopeful, and vulnerable, John wants to kiss him. So he gets up from the couch, walks to Sherlock, leans over him, and does. Just a quick peck, but the rush of being able to do this now, anytime he likes, is heady.
“You may have a rebel on your hands,” she teases. It’s meant to be playful, John knows, but there’s a sadness in it.
. Fringe. Rosie had shown him pictures of some child TikTok star for reference. He’d attempted to replicate the style with monstrous results.
It’s arsenic poisoning, and she could be dead within minutes without treatment. She needs a chelating agent in her bloodstream immediately,” Sherlock commanded, deadly serious. John’s initial annoyance vaporized, crystallized into pure dread. Stella had been poisoned. The hotel staff member had been, as well. Were they dealing with a serial killer? Was Rosie safe? John hadn’t heard of a premeditated murder in twenty years on Mann until Sherlock stepped off the plane. He was like the queen bee in a hive full of murderers- wherever Sherlock went, criminals received some communicative radio signal to follow.

understanding. It wasn’t the sex that scared him. It was the build up to all of this, the vows they already made to each other. The philosophical question of a love that could span years, unbroken and unchanged, despite its broken and changed beholders. The potential disappointment of it all.
“John,” he tried, his voice coming out rough and desperate. It sounded like
The trip existed in a purgatory between reality and fiction, where so much seemed to have happened, and yet nothing did. They returned to Baker Street and never discussed it again, aside from a snide remark about the waning quality of the croissants in London.
When John finally solved it, he didn’t know whether to laugh or cry or throw the paper out the window.
“Yes, just, go slow,” Sherlock whispers, closing his eyes. John does, pushing in centimetres at a time, holding himself back. When he’s fully inside, he glances down his body to see their forms completely connected like this, and groans. He licks at Sherlock’s nipple. Sherlock arches into the contact, hardening again after losing some arousal to the adjustment pain.
“I must have lit my seventh cigarette at half past two
“Of course you do.” She leaned back in her chair to study him. “Why are you here?”
That evening, Rosie stands against the doorframe of 221B. John makes a tick, and writes:
and Sherlock nodded frantically, mouth wide open with no words coming out. “You’re so brilliant,” he whispered, sounding like a plea.
He already fit into their lives so seamlessly, it was as if he had been there all along.
“You’re...not...an experiment...John,” Sherlock mumbled between kisses. “In fact, I’m likely more of an experiment for you than you are for me.” Sherlock raised an eyebrow and leaned in for another kiss, but John didn’t know what to make of that.
“Dr. Watson!” Stella called. He’d told her to call him John, but he privately enjoyed it when people used his doctor title. “Are you alright? You look quite peaky.”
John, quite hungry himself, grabs a container of lo mein, an eggroll, and a pair of chopsticks and tucks in. The noodles are flavorful and familiar, the veggies are crunchy, and they warm John from the inside. Rosie is so enraptured with Sherlock’s buzzing, pieces of chicken are falling out of her mouth. When John laughs, it comes from deep in his belly. Sherlock’s scathing glance at John is completely put-upon.
“Hey, sweetheart. And Stella, hi. It’s good to see you.” Rosie insisted on helping him up from the ground like he was an invalid.
Rosie was home. At last.
He wasn’t going to get Christmas John tonight.
“Listen to me, John Watson. I never want to see you again,” Sherlock bit through clenched teeth, and John’s body went totally still under him.
shoulder. All other parts of him melted away in favor of this point of connection. His thoughts about the case ceased, interrupted by an image of waking John coming up behind him, wrapping his arms around Sherlock’s waist, one hand untucking his shirt to slip the other under the silky fabric onto sensitive skin, resting his head in the same place on Sherlock’s shoulder as he now unknowingly slept.
So John did. When they finished, they would do a perfunctory clean-up, John would thank George for coming over, and George would be off with a small smile. Neither of them wanted nor needed anything more. George slept with other people. John just wanted an outlet. They used each other for good sex. Occasionally they went out for drinks. The arrangement worked.
Sherlock turned and narrowed his eyes. “I thought you were here to patch me up.”
“What about crime-solving? Should I start my blog up again? Join you on cases?”
“I do,” Sherlock breathed against his lips. “I do, John.”
much enjoy all of that, but standing behind John, letting hot water run down them as he lathered soap all down John’s body, he wanted to know what it would feel like to be inside him.

“It was adequate for my purposes. But he was a bad knock-off replacement for what I really wanted.” Sherlock looks meaningfully at John, who reaches for his hand, intertwining their fingers on top of Sherlock’s stomach. “And John, I intend to shag you more than adequately tonight.”
something.”

Stella nodded solemnly. “Be grateful you didn’t drink more,” Sherlock appraised Stella with those striking light eyes of his. “This morning, Jacqueline brought up the incident again to John. Overcompensating.” His gaze shifted meaningfully to Dad, who shuffled on his feet a bit. “Not to mention, Jacqueline was the only one who would’ve had access to the storage closet, the water controls, and the caterer at the correct times.”
“No. That wasn’t how I wanted to hear it.” Sherlock brought a hand back to John’s thigh. He could feel the sturdy muscle beneath his jeans. “Say it now, John. Say it for me.” He was practically pleading.
Sherlock scrunches his nose in distaste. “What an awful, clickbait headline. Makes it seem like I was the one who died.”
47. Follower of Islam
“Oi! What the hell are you girls giggling about?” Harry shouted from across the dancefloor, tangled around her new girlfriend, who didn’t seem to be paying attention to anything but Harry. Since their teen years, his sister had always had such a strangely hypnotic effect on the girls she dated, he used to think she was practicing witchcraft. That was still true, apparently. The hypnotic thing. The witchcraft was still up for investigation.
Xiaowen’s father chose that moment to emerge from the kitchen with a dessert sponge, and Sherlock had to admit that he had a weakness for sweets.
“Oh god, Sherlock, I’m gonna come.” John’s orgasm hit him hard, and he pumped into Sherlock a delicious, blissful couple of times before slumping against him, totally spent.
They tucked in to their sad meal.
The remark stabbed at Sherlock with a thousand tiny needles. It was not a surprise John didn’t want him if he thought he and
John looks out into the sitting room of his flat to the small gathering of people here to celebrate Rosie’s birthday. Mrs. Hudson, Greg, and Molly are chatting over cake, Mike Stamford and his wife are pouring mimosas, and Sherlock is looking concernedly at John, clearly sensing that whatever John just heard on his mobile, it wasn’t good news.
At this, John stood straight, and Sherlock moved away from his ear as if fearful he had spooked John, gone too far. It wouldn’t be the first time. But John had no intentions of backing away. Instead, he held onto Sherlock’s waist and stepped into him, pushing them backwards until Sherlock was leaning back against the granite countertop, John leaning into him, pushing into the space between Sherlock’s legs.
64. Auld ____ Syne
“Do you really mean that?” John asked, sounding utterly spent. He lifted his chin from the table to find Sherlock’s face. Whatever he found there seemed to be enough of an answer, because with a little effort, he stood, brushed himself off, pulled up his trousers, and nodded once, soldier-like, before he left Baker Street forever.
This was the kind of clue he could tend to overthink. But after some internal deliberation, John scribbled SCOT into the four letter boxes.
It tasted of John, eyes shut tight in the midst of orgasm, Sherlock’s name on his lips.
After a delectable maple salmon and asparagus course, the party had indulged in rich dark chocolate and raspberry mousse. With stomachs full, the drink servers were busy delivering wine and cocktails to the guests. The caterer had gifted Stella and Rosie a newlywed bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon, but Rosie despised the bitterness of red wine. Stella’s cheeks shone bright red after only a few sips even under the posh restaurant’s low mood lighting.
-ABBA, Slipping Through My Fingers
Rosie’s roommate had already gone to explore the campus with her gran, so it was only Rosie and Dad left in the white-walled room. They’d registered, unpacked her luggage, made her bed, and set up the minimal decorations and school supplies on her desk, so there wasn’t anything else to be done. Her trunk sat empty beneath her bed, already collecting dust. Rosie eyed the elaborate picture collage hanging above her roommate’s bed, a bright collection of smiling faces, colorful birthday parties, and warm family photographs. Rosie’s side looked bleak in comparison. The only photo she’d brought was a selfie Dad had taken with her at Snaefell summit last autumn, printed on A4 paper from Dad’s office. In it, Rosie had two fingers up behind Dad’s head, giving him bunny ears, and his eyes were crinkled into crescents, mid-laugh. Rosie’s windblown hair looked wild, but she was smiling from ear to ear. She remembered feeling hints of a god complex standing at the top of the mountain with her dad, on a green peak where you can see England, Ireland, Wales, and Scotland at the same time. She loved this photo dearly, but suddenly the token felt childish and small next to her roommate’s expansive collection of memories.
“I love you, too, John.”
Sherlock bristled. He hated when John talked down about his social skills, as if John was any better than Sherlock at interaction these days.
Once again, he hadn’t trusted John with the truth, and now he was living a lie.
Sherlock sent a text to Mycroft with details of their plan to go to the National Palace Museum the next morning, and their discovery of the tea’s effects. Mycroft replied simply with,
It was raining when they emerged, the chilly wetness of the air soaking into their skin. Sherlock caught a cab at the North entrance, and John and Xiaowen hopped into the backseat. The minute the cab left Taipei Main and cruised onto a street bustling with tour buses, cars, and scooters, Xiaowen ripped John’s clothes out from atop her stomach.
“Yes,” John confirmed, and he looked pained. “Sherlock, when I opened that closet door and saw you passed out like that, the cut on your forehead...I wanted to kill whoever put you there.”
A few fans in the crowd started to notice that it was her, and within minutes, every mobile was pointed at her, taking videos and pictures. For a moment, it felt like she was already on tour, like everyone in the club was there just to see her. She was usually averse to this kind of attention, but tonight, surrounded by her best friends in a pulsing nightclub, it was intoxicating.

“Is it?” She asked innocently, too cheeky for her own good.
“Stella
at Dad. And Rosie had to do a double-take, but Dad smiled like a besotted schoolgirl. The two of them were unbearable.
“Again.”
“Thank you,” Sherlock nodded, and he meant it for far more than her felicitations. He wouldn’t be here without her.
“I’ve kept a lot of things,” Sherlock said, looking into the fireplace.
Rosie blushed. “Well, I- I actually already read it.”
“I have everything I need here. Country life has been good to me.”
He had pushed Sherlock away, treating him like scum, hiding the intensity of his feelings under scathing words, unanswered texts, and on one horribly vivid occasion, bloody fists. In the Sherlock-less years to follow, he had done a lot of work on himself with the help of a therapist (well, a few). But right now, John had the sense that he was living out the loneliest years of his life. He was nearing his mid-fifties, and every day he wondered where he might be if he hadn’t been such a bloody idiot. Sherlock probably hated him, and definitely never wanted to see him again. They hadn’t so much as texted in five years. That, John knew now, was the loneliness of heartbreak.
“Yes?” Sherlock answered, willing his voice to be as neutral as possible, lest Mycroft immediately pity him for bowing to emotional whims.
“Tell me, John,” Sherlock said, whispering against John’s bottom lip. “Tell me what you lied about.”
Sherlock’s mouth snapped shut. He stepped underneath the arch, his body seeming to move of its own accord, drawn into John’s orbit. If Sherlock was going to reject him, at least he had the courtesy not to do it from a distance.
She furrowed her brow. “She’s the only person I’ve told, besides you and M.”
Xiaowen. He wondered if she was still hiding. She would be terribly uncomfortable by now.
The piano music shifted to the processional, and Stella stepped out of the car in front of them with her mom. Rosie couldn’t suppress a gasp.
Agriculture, abbr.
The silence had gone on a few seconds too long. She felt Sherlock’s eyes reading right through her. He was probably cataloguing the beads of sweat forming on her forehead, her quickened breath. “I’m-“ she swallowed, forcing a response out. “I can’t believe you came.”
John gaped, nearly knocking over his empty glass in- surprise? relief? anger? on his way to standing. He shook his head vigorously, as if to shake off the phantom voice. It must’ve been a trick of the alcohol, or post-adrenaline exhaustion. It wasn’t unusual for him, he supposed-- hearing voices. One posh, silky, arsehole voice in particular. But it hadn’t happened in years. Wedding stress? God, he needed another pint.
He had naively thought the TD-12 would bring John peace- that knowing the truth would break him. But in agreeing to the TD-12 treatment, Sherlock had proven he learned nothing from the business with Magnussen. Once again, sentiment had compromised his critical thinking and worsened the outcome.
His mouth, his tongue, his hands, his body all part of one system that was turning Sherlock into a babbling mess of want.
“Oh, come on. You can’t tell me you two haven’t been...well-acquainted. Half the town’s encouraged it. And she-” Sherlock paused, his eyes roaming John’s torso. “You can’t deny she’s your
being an advocate for the TD-12 treatment.”
“Thank you, Mrs. Liu, for your honesty,” Sherlock said. “Now, back to Jacqueline.” His entire being went from posh and polite to menacing in half a second. The suspect had gone limp in Lestrade’s arms, having lost the will to fight any longer.
“When did you know you loved me?” he asked. Sherlock figured he ought to ask the big ones before the tea’s effects subsided.
She knew she was lucky to be here. Everyone told her it was one of the most prestigious fine arts academies in Europe, but their praise only served to fuel her anxieties. What if she wasn’t talented enough? Smart enough? She eyed the other students wandering the dormitory, some of them already breaking out their instruments and filling the hallways with incredibly practiced sound.
Xiaowen stared through the glass at Amy across the room (who
They left their wedding early and showed up to the wedding brunch more than fashionably late, but who could blame them? They hadn’t planned this bloody thing- the brunch had all been Rosie and Stella’s doing. If it had been up to John, he’d have been fine with a three minute wedding in jeans and t-shirts washed down with a bottle of beer if it meant he could keep Sherlock in bed for a week.
The next text followed within seconds.
good, but not enough. He takes his hand out from Sherlock’s trousers and hurriedly undoes his own belt and zip just enough to pull out his cock, so Sherlock can touch it, unrestrained. He doesn’t hesitate. Sherlock’s fingers wrap tightly around the base of John’s cock and stroke, and
Stella’s gaze was so familiar, so loving and gentle that Rosie forgot about everything else. She held tightly onto Dad’s arm as they stepped toward her love.
“With Sherlock in the family? There won’t be any room for that.” He looks lovingly at Sherlock, sitting in John’s own chair. Sherlock stares back at him, dumbfounded. Clara smiles privately to herself.
“Well, that encounter was hard evidence of our sexual attraction to each other. Of course, there were other signs, but none so glaringly obvious. You wouldn’t have proposed today if there were any doubts of my attraction to you.” John’s chest was finally exposed, his shirt and jacket and tie discarded, and Sherlock couldn’t resist tasting a bead of sweat that had gathered along John’s collarbone.
“You know.”
“You could have invited me without luring me here under false pretenses!” Sherlock turned away from her, wanting to punch the tacky floral wallpaper lining the hallway like sour milk in a constricted esophagus. He ran a hand through his hair, likely making him look like a madman. “You don’t understand. I cannot be here.” He scanned the rapidly shrinking hallway for all possible exits.
to solve this. The code swirled in front of him, but none of it made sense. Airplane seats? No, no, he was muddling the memory with reality. Irene was close! Sherlock raised an eyebrow. John looked down at the table. Nothing! Just tea, crumbs of toast, the crossword...oh! Irene’s lips touched his cheek. Sherlock beamed. He had seen the answer cross John’s face. “The crossword!” John shouted, only to wake up in his flat. No Irene, no Baker Street, no Sherlock. But to his right, on his bedside table, lay the Times, open to this week’s crossword puzzle:
45. A screwdriver has many, on Doctor Who
The signs were there: the message had been typed instead of handwritten, the tone had been a touch dramatic for John’s usual stylings, and John would hardly want him at a wedding after the catastrophe that was the last Watson wedding Sherlock had attended.
15. 221B’s kitchen when it’s full of dishes, say
“Must I remind you how hopeless
Rosie was about to make a grab for the microphone, when Dad growled, “But you trusted Mary, too.”
John reached for it, but Sherlock intercepted. “Let me.”
John stared straight ahead at the road, licking his lips. “Thank god we’re nearly there, because I’m going to die if I can’t get my hands on you immediately
They did, however, abstain from tea.
“Sh’lock. I love you,” John whispered against his lips, and Sherlock licked around them to taste it. “I love you.”
When John finally took him into his mouth, Sherlock was aching for it. He’d thought he would be able to study John as he held him there by his mouth, but he was under such a spell that each sensation was indifferentiable from the last. All he could think, feel, taste, smell, hear was
“Yes.” There was a tinge of regret, there. It was guiltily vindicating.
“God, yes.”
“But don’t blame me if Aunt Harry comes running after you. I don’t think I have the physical strength to hold her back.”
John held up his paper. It was opened to the crossword page.
We have a story and it survived."
In his own room, Sherlock was laid out on the bed, trying and failing to focus on the case of Stella Moran. The leaky tap was stirring whirlpools in his concentration. It didn’t help that Watson’s words in the lobby kept replaying themselves over again.
“We’re in
John flexed it a little and crinkled his nose in frustration. “Not great, but the seat’s comfortable enough, I s’pose.”
Xiaowen’s face did a series of emotional flips before it landed on anger. “Sherlock, be honest, do you think the two of them…”
He had been so focused on the fickle ribbon, he hadn’t seen their approach, and he nearly dropped the scissors at Rosie’s greeting. “Hey, sweetheart. And- oh! Stella, hi. It’s good to see you.” Rosie offered a hand to help him off the ground, and he took it with suspicion. He hated the idea of people treating him like an aging man- he was so prideful. Toxic masculinity, and all that. He gave Rosie a light kiss on the cheek and Stella a hug.
“Have you found any suspects?” she prompted.
25. Eye, to Dr. Watson
“Mm.” He ran a hand through his own hair, knowing it would send a fresh wave of scent in John’s direction.
But tonight was not a George night. He was too keyed up to wait, and too preoccupied with Sherlock to think about anyone else. Surrendering to the indulgence, John reached down and undid his fly, thinking only of dirty crossword clues and a detective.
“My mom died last year, so I shifted to part-time work at the pharmacy in Taipei to come here to care for my father and spend time with him,” she said, notes of sadness in her voice.
Obviously. “I can be extremely convincing.”
Sherlock narrows his eyes, reading the truth in the declaration on John’s face. “Easier said than done, John.”
Hello, Dr. Watson. This is Anita Stimson, celebrity news correspondent at the Daily Mail. I’m reaching out to see if you’d be interested in an interview regarding recent events...
John couldn’t just
The setting for many a teen- or unilock fic scene
“No. Nope. I don’t want to hear another word about it,” he said, shaking his head furiously. “Just get over here,”
“No.” Clearly, Dad knew who this Lord Moran was, and didn’t like it. He waved his index finger in the air to accompany the dissent. “Sherlock, no. It can’t be an accident that the
Mycroft opened his briefcase, producing a file. He handed it to Sherlock, who took it with as much demonstrated impatience as he could muster.
“I didn’t want to give Iris any more leverage than she already had. If I had known you were listening, Sherlock, I wouldn’t have-”
John let out a breath. “Sherlock, I -” his mobile started vibrating, “Shit, it’s Harry. I have to take this, say hi to Rosie.”
The lift fell into silence, but the buzz of curiosity radiating from Rosie’s friends was palpable. He stared at the multi-mirrored ceiling, into dozens of his own eyes staring back at him.
Sherlock could taste the beginnings of a solution, but they needed to find the proof. “John, go inside the exhibit and make sure Iris stays here. Xiaowen and I are going to break into her office.” He pulled a museum map from a nearby stand and circled it. “I’ll send a text when we need you.”
“Ohmygod, John,” he gasped. John looked up, gave him a questioning glance. Sherlock nodded enthusiastically, unable to articulate that
“Can I, now. I need…”
John’s soft mumbling was a wool blanket, not thrown atop him but woven into his very skin. Warmth emanated from deep within Sherlock’s body, but John was the source.
“There’s beer in the fridge,” Sherlock encouraged, hoping to take the edge off of John’s foul mood. He had bought the specific brand for John’s Christmas visit.
“Don’t be daft. What other reason would I have had to invite you? Aside from your ability to prevent murders-- but I had no idea we’d need to tap into that skillset.” She smiled sadly at him. “Thanks for that, by the way.”
“Of course,
“Indeed, John! You’ve a wedding to prepare for!” Sherlock yelled, madness dripping off of him, and he was out the door. They hadn’t resolved a single thing. A pit of dread that Sherlock would drift permanently out of his grasp too soon settled in his stomach.
John was fuming. “Don’t you dare walk away from me now,” he ordered, and the combination of the command and John’s groin pressed up against his arse was making him hard again. Fight it, his brain pushed against his arousal. Fight. It.
John barely left Sherlock’s side all evening, but when he made a trip to the loo, Harry approached him, slipping into John’s empty seat next to him. “So, Sherlock Holmes.” She put both her feet up on the empty chair beside her, slinging an arm over the back of hers, somehow managing to pull off this nonchalant effortlessness in a rather gaudy, witchy black dress. It was very apparent where Watson got her confident, rebellious streak. “Or are you going by Sherlock Watson now?”
Despite John’s reality-altering confession just moments ago, John’s softness with Xiaowen made something pull in his chest. She nodded and efficiently secured the guard’s hands behind his back.
“She always took the fall for me. I think she knew that for me to survive in that house, I had to be the golden boy. Dad had already written her off. I regret that I’ll never be able to properly thank her for everything she did to protect me from him.” John catches a glimpse of Clara crying unabashedly in the front row, and he has to swallow before going on.
Adored. Past tense.
Summer, in Paris
Sherlock sighed. “That would require leaving this bed.”
Sherlock’s face betrays nothing, but his eyes darken. Their chests are touching, and John can feel Sherlock’s heartbeat quicken through his posh black button-up.
John came with a grunt, spurting into Sherlock’s mouth, dripping down Sherlock’s throat.
“Lonely?” He choked, and she instantly regretted saying anything. Dad had never been the greatest model of confronting his own negative emotions. “I couldn’t be. I’ve got you.”
Xiaowen’s distress shifted into something more like excitement as she pulled onto a small road winding to a small home atop a hill. The building overlooked a steppe of tea plants. Her family home. “You’ll be able to see for yourselves in a minute.”
5. More intelligent (as Mycroft insists he is to Sherlock)
“Nice,” Sherlock spat, his perfectly styled curls bouncing with the quirk of his head, “or motivated?”
“This place is going to look beautiful tomorrow,” she said, gesturing to the large windows and radiant wooden beams along the ceiling.
Sherlock hungrily rakes in his body with his eyes, lingering on his crotch. “John, I know I said it last night, but it deserves repeating- your cock is
Sherlock smirks and helps him up. John wraps his arms around Sherlock under his dressing gown and leans his head against the man’s chest. John feels his heart beat quicken. “You’re going to be the death of me, Sherlock.”
54. Large group of related Scottish families
The fact that John
John stood at the flower-lined path (undoubtedly Watson’s doing- John killed every plant he’d ever tried to foster) leading to the front door, tipping his chin expectantly, but Sherlock was inconveniently frozen. He leaned on the car door for support, paralyzed by the gravity of the moment. This wasn’t some one-off chance. This encounter was going to set the stage for the rest of their lives. There was no stepping back from this once he crossed the threshold.
“John,” he murmured, his hands sliding up John’s back, into the hairs at the nape of his neck.
He slammed his hand down on the aluminium table, the reverberation echoing throughout the expansive room. Sherlock barely masked a flinch with a flick of the microscope knob. “Sorry, sorry,” John said, taking a deep breath, rubbing the knuckles on his left hand. “Why are you
83.8 cm. 2 years
Sherlock whipped around, taking his arm from John’s and placing both of his petulantly over his chest.
“Yes, Jo-
He pushed back against him. “Mm. More.”
The hard drive of Sherlock’s brain short-circuited. John’s confession was a trigger for a total system update installation. He retreated to his mind palace for data recovery mode.
For two minutes too long, there was no response, and Sherlock wondered if John had gone back to his other flat tonight, leaving him to the abysmal loneliness of Johnlessness.

did.”
, we’ll work it out. You’re Sherlock Holmes. You’re in the business of working things out. And I’m damn good at helping you get there.”
“When do you get off?” Sherlock said, leaning against the oak desk in the marble-tiled lobby, giving the green-uniformed receptionist a onceover. A tall, thin man with mousy features in his late thirties, he wasn’t Sherlock’s type, exactly, but he was flirting with him to sneak a glance at the employee schedule. The receptionist turned and smiled at him, and a nametag reading Connor shone under the warm light. Sherlock ran his finger along the spine of the scheduling binder. “Can I take a look?”
32. Dublin-born Total Wipeout co-host Amanda
“One room?” Sherlock asked, suddenly a bit wary about spending the night with John.
As if she had been summoned, his daughter ran up to pull them both into a hug. She offered her congratulations, and reached behind her head, pulling out the white flower John had put into her hair not long ago. “You should have this,” she said, offering it to John. “Something borrowed.” Rosie winked.
Jacqueline struggled against this Lestrade bloke as the handcuffs snapped. Lestrade seemed oddly familiar...and that name. Where had she heard it before? “How dare you!” Jacqueline shouted, her peppy demeanor disappearing instantly.

6. “I’m not a _____, I’m a high functioning sociopath”
“Oh! Of course, right,” she said, eyes glancing to the sky, searching for a memory that wouldn’t come. “Dad told me about Mrs. Hudson. I wish I remembered her.” Another tug. “I guess it’s just strange to picture my dad off on adventures without me. It’s always been him and me.”
@DailyMailUK mentioned you
“Always so humble,” Dad mumbled, and despite the absurdity of it all, Rosie couldn’t suppress a smile.
She shook her head in disbelief. “Well, that was odd.”
Stella, Mrs. Liu, and Jacqueline looked on in shock. Rosie wore an unreadable expression that could have been bemusement. John made a mental note to ask her about all this later.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Yet you’re currently hiding behind a teapot.”
But what can I say?
The five of them exchanged hugs and pleasantries. And if his embraces were a little more heartfelt with Elaine and Yasmin, no one mentioned it. He liked Stella, he really did, he just didn’t know her that well. At least, that’s what he told himself. She and Rosie had only ever spent a week or less at a time on the Isle, having met in London. John wasn’t the best with new people, and he hadn’t bothered to genuinely get to know Stella until he realized it was serious between the two of them, which was more recent than he’d like to admit. He was trying with Stella, mostly because he wanted Rosie to know that he approved. His hesitation had nothing to do with Stella being a woman, and everything to do with his own inability to be vulnerable with people (at least, that’s what his therapist would say).
Diwali celebrator
Sherlock ended the call and handed the phone back to John. He took it dazedly, unable to process all that was happening at the moment. “Sherlock, what the hell is going on?”
He forced himself from a slump to a sitting position as best he could with the constraints, and listened through the small crack between the door and its frame. He could make out John on one side of the desk, and Iris Lyu on the other. Sherlock could only see Iris’s chair from his point of view, but John fidgeted, meaning he was strapped down, but his arms were free.
But before he got the chance to adjust to the half-reality that was an airplane cabin at dawn, a woman with hair and a suit far too put-together for having spent eleven hours on a flight approached from first class. When she saw Sherlock, she leaned over conspiratorially to address him, as if they were old friends.
“Oh, well, congrats, then. On both,” John smiled.
Rosie had read the words before, but they stung more hearing them in her partner’s voice. The emotion in them cut bone-deep, especially because Dad had only ever expressed that level of heightened emotion with her. Sure, he had friends outside of their two-person family unit, even dated a few people over the years, but never ones he would say he loved. For twenty years, Rosie thought that she was and would always be the sole occupant of her father’s heart. It turns out, she had been unknowingly renting the space from Sherlock Holmes.
Sherlock’s room in the cottage looked shockingly like his room in 221B: same periodic table poster, same dresser, same simplicity. John felt like he had been transported back in time. The only things that were different were the bed frame, one black-and-white wallpapered wall covered in small designs of atomic structures, and the luxe shag carpet on top of old hardwood floors. And when John dug his toes into the carpet as he unbuttoned Sherlock’s jeans, he was thankful for the addition.
Everyone in the audience looked from Jacqueline to Mrs. Liu.
Turns out, the stocky man in the tour group was right. As the train came to a stop at the forest-shrouded Sacred Tree Station, the door opened and a gust of cool, fresh air filled the space.
Sherlock smiled sleepily. “Jooohn.”
“He has no idea,” she said around the edge of a chewed fingernail.
It took John a minute to realize he was talking about the Redbeard bowl. “Have you?” John asked, unable to keep the hurt out of his voice.
John is secretly thrilled- Sherlock is great company in the A&E lobby. And he really doesn’t want to do this alone. “You’re sure, Molly? I owe you.”
“I don’t know where she is,” John’s voice felt distant. Who was “she”? Focus! He could wallow about John when he was out of the closet.
“It’s alright, really, but why--” She was interrupted by the reveal of a white flower from Sherlock’s coat pocket, which he handed to her unceremoniously. The soft petals curled in on themselves almost shyly.
Network of the Scots
to pick this lock first. “Quickly, get between the filing cabinets and throw a poster over yourself. I’ll take the broom closet.” She did as he instructed, and it was surprisingly inconspicuous, but it allowed her little mobility and no view of the room.
“You’re the best shag I’ve ever had,” John mouthed into his ear.
When Rosie only bit her lip in response, Yasmin gasped. “Rosie! What did Confirmed-Bisexual Dr. Watson have to say about
“John,” he whispered, his name falling somewhere in the space between respect and worship. “Thank you, truly, but you don’t have to-”

John did the same, pulling Sherlock’s trousers and pants off and throwing them to the ground before pouncing on him. Finally,
“Want to go kiss some more?” Sherlock muttered, barely coherent against his lips, but John understood the reference.
“It’s lovely here,” John said, relaxingly holding on to Earl’s leash in one hand, and Sherlock’s in the other.
“Actually, Mr. Holmes, can I take a picture of you and Dr. Watson? It’s not often that I have celebrities stay here,” Weixian said, waving his mobile.
much catching up to do.
He had met Mike Stamford for lunch at a small cafe near St. Bart’s that was far too hip and crowded for John’s taste. He usually avoided this area at all costs, bad memories and the like, but he had already cancelled on Mike four separate times now.
“And while I’m grateful for your...authentic scent, you’ll feel most comfortable after you bathe. I’ll have lunch ready by the time you come out. Come on.” Sherlock reached down to help John get to his feet. His age was really starting to show.
“Only if you’re interested.”
Her cheeks coloured. “He doesn’t know. I- I sent the invite pretending to be my dad.”
, he scolded himself. Mycroft’s eyes swept over him, a trace of distaste making itself clear in the downturn of his lips.

John moaned, nodding his head as if to say,
17. Build-your-own furniture store
Sherlock huffed and stood to hold his full height over his older brother. Mycroft was referring to when Sherlock and John had tracked Mary to Morocco. But that wasn’t real; that had happened in John’s fabricated and TD-12-fueled version of events for the blog. The reality had proven to be much messier than the story released to the public, and it had left his relationship with John on the rocks, to say the least. He and Rosie still visited 221B twice a week, but it felt forced. Sherlock walked in quicksand around John: the faster he moved toward him, the faster he was pulled down and away.
“Yeah?” John smiles against Sherlock’s neck. He moves his hand down Sherlock’s body, reaching for his belt.
Sod the ceremony. He’d sit here all afternoon if it meant his daughter would sing a song she wrote for him. She fetched her guitar.
Sherlock raised an eyebrow and downed the last sip in his glass. “5 letters.”
the pressure of Sherlock’s arousal against his own is electrifying. Sherlock braces himself on the counter, bringing their chests together. John nestles his nose in Sherlock’s neck, just breathing in the scent of him. He smells like 221B, but concentrated with an added mix of soap and sweat and cigarettes. It’s heady. John rolls his hips against Sherlock’s, who groans.
John let go of Sherlock to place a small piece of gauze over the cut. Sherlock instantly missed John’s fingers in his hair, and he couldn’t repeat what John had said, couldn’t materialize his greatest miscalculation.
“Right. So,” John started, awkwardly.
Lord, that felt like a century ago. How was John thinking of anything but what the night would bring? But then, John had always been a dweller. Sherlock looked out the window, up at the stars. They were blinking in clear skies. “Fate intervened, it seems.”
Apparently, he’d simply been keeping secrets.
That just left Sherlock and Xiaowen, whose eyebrows were nearly up to her fringe. “Well, uh. Seems like you two have some secrets.”
They only finish three more patients (broken arm, sprained ankle, chicken pox) before John spots an oddly familiar woman with a nose ring, dark, intense eyes, and a head of black, springy curls across the room. “Clara!” John nearly shouts in his excitement to see an old friend he hadn’t realized he missed until this moment.
Hope you crossword nerds had fun. As always, you can find me on tumblr @disfictional. Hearts!
He wasn’t discreet, close enough to the microphone to be projected, and the question felt like a punch to Rosie’s gut.
Stella’s mouth hung open in shock, but then it was on hers, sucking on her bottom lip, her hands coming up to cup Rosie’s face.
But apparently he was indulging his masochistic side, because he agreed for John to do this one thing. Then he could wallow alone in luxury. And with a better bandage.
John was getting used to the new relaxed openness about Sherlock, and he hadn’t expected him to be so...forthright. “Jesus,” John panted, feeling the blood rush to his groin. “I meant ‘Kiss me,’ genius, but the other offer also sounds...tempting.”
Stella gave Rosie a knowing glance. “For my dad, really.” And it was. She didn’t personally care about the “something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue” fodder, but she knew Dad would like it if she wore something of his. He was sentimental, that way.
“Absolutely not,” he said, kissed her cheek, and left to chase after Sherlock Holmes.
John stilled for a moment. “I thought, tonight. Maybe I could…make myself a cuppa.”
sell you out, you deserve better.”
He remembered writing it in a haze, just days before leaving Baker Street, twenty years ago. He had been awake all night waiting for Sherlock to come home. He hadn’t. When Sherlock finally crept through the threshold of 221B at 5:30am, smelling of smoke and mildew, high as a kite, it hadn’t even been an argument. John knew- they
The air was cooler and windier on the mountain, and Sherlock wished he hadn’t packed his coat away in his carry-on. Xiaowen showed him and John around the outside of the house while her father went inside to finish preparing for lunch. The house was modest, but the view was breathtaking. It overlooked a tea farm that bled into foggy mountains, like a shot straight from a BBC One nature documentary.
“You’ve got a theory, then,” John said, lengthening his stride in an effort to keep up.
“I might have to turn in a bit earlier than planned, Rose, but I’m
“God, no,” he can barely get the words out. He’s livid. He flexes his fingers, fighting the urge to punch something. It’s this moment that Sherlock appears and digs his hand into John’s shoulder, equal parts warning and comfort.
Sherlock sighed. “I can’t leave London now. You
“Puffinus puffinus.”
“A gardenia. For your hair,” said Sherlock, rocking back on his heels. “To match your dress.”
28. Resources (John has many fine ones he’s overlooked in his obsession with Sherlock)
John laughed, a real, hearty laugh, and bumped his shoulder against Sherlock’s. “Hey, don’t make me regret coming.”
Sherlock looks vindicated. John wraps his arm around Sherlock’s shoulders, who leans into the touch casually.

John shoved a piece of bacon in his mouth, willing his erection down. He was an embarrassing cliche-- one verbal fight and a mention of danger to an ex-soldier and he was ready to pop off, even once Sherlock shut him down completely. He swallowed. “It certainly wasn’t one of our men,” he said, relieved that he sounded relatively normal. “They’re just a bunch of old blokes who like rolling in mud. It’s embarrassing, honestly.”
She beamed. “It

Sherlock reached down to undo John’s belt and the zip on John’s trousers. “Absolutely not,” he assured, pushing down John’s trousers for emphasis.
“You should go see him,” she urged, patting him on the shoulder encouragingly. He looked around at the dispersing guests, ready to protest, but Rosie stopped him. “There’s an ongoing investigation into the place I’m supposed to get married tomorrow. He’ll want your help. I want you to help.”
?” His voice had risen to a totally unacceptable level for the hotel breakfast buffet, but he found he didn’t much care that half the guests could hear his and Sherlock’s squabble.
Sherlock nodded. The guard had dragged him into the closet after he had been knocked out.
Elaine cooed, “That’s sweet of you, Rose.”
Mycroft, mercifully, turned and left.
John devoured plate after plate of pork fried rice as Sherlock rambled to him in Chinese about the geography of Taiwan and injuries and tea. Soo-Lin pulled up a chair, occasionally correcting Sherlock on his pronunciation and responding in kind. He had mostly heard her speak Cantonese in the short period he had known her, but being involved in the Black Lotus, she also spoke Mandarin and was familiar with traditional characters. A perfect Mind Palace mentor, really.
34. Cheers for Taehyung at a BTS concert, perhaps
Mycroft managed to sound even more exasperated than usual, which was quite a feat. Sherlock stretched his legs out over the coffee table in the center of the living room at 221B and latched his fingers behind his head, observing the absurdly pretentious man standing across from him. Mycroft looked disheveled. By Mycroft’s standards, this meant a few (grey) hairs out of place and a single button undone on his waistcoat, but disheveled, nonetheless.
“You lied.”
“She miscalculated. Didn’t take into account my…previous experience.”
He can’t stop the possibly catastrophic, emotional train of thought threatening to burst out of him now. “Harry Watson was blunt, perceptive, and intolerant of liars, which is why I have to tell her now that she was always right about me.” He draws in a breath, revelling in the riskiness of what he’s about to say, masochistically savoring the way his emotions have been pushed so far past the limit this week that he just doesn’t care anymore. “And she was right about everything when it came to me and Sherlock.”
The photo had been saved on Dad’s desktop computer under his wedding album folder, the entire contents of which Rosie had committed to memory. She had snooped there more than a few times in her younger years, a curious child eager for answers about her murky history. The current sight of Sherlock transported her to Dad’s office, clicking through a seemingly endless reel of lilac dresses, honey yellow walls, and cream-white flowers when she was supposedly “doing homework.” She could picture the file perfectly. Nestled between photographs of Mrs. Hudson and the bridesmaids outside the church, there was a picture of her mum, Dad, and Sherlock together. Mum wore a glorious smile. She looked gorgeous, and over-the moon. Dad looked happy, an arm each on Mum and Sherlock. But the peculiarity of the photo lay in Sherlock’s stiffness, as if he were steeling himself for a fatal blow certain to come after the picture was taken. She’d always thought it rather odd, but now that she had read about the nature of Dad’s relationship with Sherlock Holmes in his journal, the strangeness of that photo finally made sense.
Curated twitter feed, in slang
“I actually- I wrote you a song,” Rosie turned to face him, strong jaw set with determination. “Can I sing it for you?”
“Oh, please, John,” Sherlock shut his eyes and leaned back casually into the leather. “As if I haven’t seen you do much worse. Must I remind you of the case of the Zodiac robber?”
And the answer had always, so awfully simply been: no.
2. B*tch, to a Russian
Sherlock ran his eyes over Xiaowen’s uncombed short hair and the trousers and sweatshirt that were both one and a half sizes too big. Sherlock couldn’t hide his disbelief. “You slept with her last night.”
The breakfast trolley was approaching. “Buck up, John, here’s the other one.”
“I want you to take me upstairs to my bedroom, and let me watch from the bed while you take off your shirt and trousers,” Sherlock spoke as intensely as he would during a deduction, but the content was deliciously captivating. “You’ll crawl on top of me and kiss me until I need you to take my clothes off.” He rubbed John’s length over his trousers, and John
He can see people looking around helplessly, wondering how this speech went off the rails so suddenly, some confused, some excited. Mrs. Hudson looks vindicated. Mostly, he sees Sherlock, eyes wide, mouth open. John can’t tell if it’s terror or pure surprise, or a little of both. John relishes in it.
John took another bite of brie. He believed him. “Not much consulting work these days, then?”
He cracked on, “I have to take this case, but I can’t leave. Not without you. Not again.”
She took a breath. “I promise I won’t tell anyone.”
“The second thing I learned from Harry is my favorite: Danger is fun. I’m not sure how many of you are followers of my blog, but if you are, you know that I’ve spent most of my life chasing adrenaline highs, joining the army, catching criminals with Sherlock Holmes. I think I owe that habit to Harry, and I’m not sure if I should adore her or resent her for it.”

were ridiculous.
22. Like one with a long coat and a short friend
One night, Sherlock wandered up the stairs of 221B, totally spent. He had just solved a robbery involving a particularly high-speed running chase through London, and he was not as agile as he used to be. His feet were sore.
Dad’s breathing was becoming shallow. Rosie thought she might have a crisis on her hands if she didn’t calm him down. “It’s okay, Dad. It can’t be a wedding without a bit of drama, right?”
John changed that, of course. Sherlock wanted him, in all senses of the word- a realization he had unfortunately come to at John’s own wedding, but circumstances had never allowed it. His relationship with John was already balancing on an edge and suggesting a sexual component would undoubtedly tip it over. But Sherlock hadn’t missed the signs (he rarely did). The signs that John wanted him, too.
John didn’t know much about wedding gowns, but the dress suited her perfectly. It was simple, with thin straps and a lacy bodice that seemed to dance in the light of the window. Simple, but dynamic.
Denmark’s airport code
that’s so good Sherlock. You’re a bloody genius,” John panted, his heavy erection slapping noisily between their stomachs. “I don’t- oh- want this to ever stop.”
“I wanted you that first night. The very first night we met.” He ran his tongue over his bottom lip in the exact same way he had at Angelo’s.
A few blocks later they arrive at Baker Street. Rosie is sound asleep, clutching her hedgehog. She looks peaceful, which is so far beyond John’s current state of being that he can’t comprehend it.
She raised her eyebrows at him expectantly. Well?
Sherlock gave her a kiss on the cheek, emboldened by John’s public display of physical affection. “Enjoy your new lab. By all means, please order some expensive, ridiculous piece of equipment on my behalf as a middle finger to my big brother.”
“They’re on their way.”
Sherlock huffs. “Of course she’s sure, John. Let’s go.” Sherlock pulls on the sleeve of John’s blue blazer as he takes his coat off the rack. John follows on autopilot, swept up in the day’s chaotic turn of events. At the door, Sherlock turns and yells to the small group in the sitting room, “Thanks for coming everyone, now please leave!”
John smiles wickedly. “Bedroom?”
As wild and unexpected as the wedding had been, the brunch was surprisingly normal: catch-ups on the couplings of the previous night, comments about how fit he and Sherlock looked together, hangover comparison, laughter about Harry’s ridiculousness on the dance floor, follow-up gossip about Jacqueline Mann like inflammatory headlines: hotel catering event manager turned arsenic murderer.
John tugged him down for another kiss, and Sherlock let himself be pulled in by it. John kissed exactly how he’d remembered, with gentle conviction. He theorised that he could occupy himself with John’s lips indefinitely if he had access to an IV drip.
A rush of jealousy runs through John, despite having no grounds to be jealous of Sherlock’s only lover when John’s most recent of whom
Suddenly, this entire affair seemed rushed, incomplete. She turned to Stella, ready to propose a potentially controversial plan.
There's a lot you can teach me

At this, Sherlock scoffs. “We don’t need to make any sort of statement about it. People have been speculating for years. Let them talk. John hardly said anything scandalous.”
Twitter (57 notifications) 7:45pm
She sighed, hating the implication that what she was hoping would be a laid back affair would turn into girls gone wild, but she knew he didn’t really mean it. She wondered absently what his stag night had been like. If Sherlock had been his best man, had he been there? She couldn’t really picture Holmes down the pub with a group of Dad’s mates. The image made her stifle a chuckle. Dad’s phone vibrated again, and his eyes lit up. “Texting a detective?” she asked, the rum apparently making her bolder than usual.
Smart, John. He knew what he liked, and he didn’t need to hear it from Sherlock.
He whispered over the seat, “We’ve got to hurry. Stuff these up your shirt to look pregnant, and hide the lumps with your jacket.”
recognized whispering in Amy’s ear in a cozy way that was decidedly more-than-friendly.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes. “Your father’s skills are appalling. I can’t stand to embarrass myself twice.”
John is reminded of Sherlock’s similar comment some months ago. He nods against Sherlock’s neck. “I think she’d be secretly thrilled for us. She’d act like a right dick about it, though. Her being right all this time.”
John made his way to the edge of the wall separating the lobby from the bar and steeled himself for whatever madness he was going to see on the other side.
Stella’s eyes were glossy. Rosie leaned into her, at a loss for words. Stella’s dad was
“A bit cliche, isn’t it?” Sherlock said, not minding one bit, taking in the highlighted view of John’s arse in his pants.

John kept the gun trained on the guard as he felt for Sherlock’s mobile. Without response, he tossed it in Sherlock’s direction, and he promptly informed Mycroft via text that they had secured the tea and both members of the guilty party.
At the time, she had been stretching herself thin, performing gigs all over London every night, trying to establish herself in the music scene. That night had been an easy hour-long set, with a group of hip twenty-somethings going in and out of listening to Rosie and talking amongst themselves. Once she had finished her set and packed up her guitar, Stella approached her mid-step off the stage.

Sherlock placed his hand on top of John’s. It felt cool on John’s bath-warmed skin. “John, you can have everything.” His voice was low, and pleading. “I’ve wanted something more for some time.”
. “Agh, Mycroft! He can’t resist meddling. I’m sorry for the trauma meeting my brother may have caused you. What the

John leans in to kiss him, harder this time, and Sherlock pulls him into his lap. John falls over him gracelessly, and the room descends into giggles- from John, Sherlock, Rosie, and Clara.
“I will, I just need to give Earl some food, first.” John lifted his packed bag and pulled out the dog food.

Sherlock looks affronted. “Don’t go getting any ideas, Mr. Heart Wrenching and Really Quite Sweet.”
Dad was no restaurateur, but he was clearly trying- it was extremely endearing. Rosie squeezed Stella’s hand in her lap.
John smiled coyly. “You’re asking me how long I’ve wanted you.”
. Yes, indeed.” It clicked into place- the TD-12 had caused John to believe Redbeard to be a childhood friend of Sherlock’s, rather than his dog. Was the TD-12 wearing off?
When she stepped out into the hallway on her way to resolve the water issue, she spotted a tall, vaguely familiar figure with a head of curls, poshly dressed and walking like he had somewhere better to be. He was heading to the lifts.
Sherlock froze, pausing to bottle the memory for storage. His own name slurred from John’s sleepy lips into his forearm made his entire body instantly pliable. Sherlock knew John’s PTSD dream tells, and he wasn’t expressing them. It was a relaxed dream, then, probably so mundane that John wouldn’t remember when he woke. That meant John would be in an ideal state for Sherlock to run his hands through his silver-blonde hair.
So maybe Sherlock wasn’t off the table.
Stella thanked him for his help, and he waved it off. “I cocked up my own wedding by letting my best man do all the work, so it’s only fair I pay it forward now.” He caught traces of knowing glances exchanged between Rosie’s friends, and he was determined to figure out what those meant.
His phone pinged, bringing him out of the fluorescent-lit hole-in-the-wall Mind Palace Chinese restaurant with John and Soo-Lin and into his (empty) flat.
“It worked, did it not?” Mycroft half-smiled to himself, and Sherlock fought the urge to shake him. “Pack your bags for Taiwan,” his tone was firm. “This was part of the Magnussen deal upon your return- you explicitly agreed to take some MI6 work in exchange for your exoneration.”
“Hardly.” Sherlock pushed a full plate topped with what looked like smoked bacon, Manx pudd, eggs, and a grilled tomato towards him. “I was here early; I took the liberty of ordering for you.” He placed a steaming cup of tea into John’s hand, Sherlock’s fingers brushing his own, and John knew the rush of warmth to his cheeks wasn’t only from the tea.
But Stella.
The incorrect assumption reminded him so eerily of his own mistake after returning from his two years away that the tug in his chest pulled harder. She, too, had imagined her entire life by John’s side.
He desperately wanted it to be Sherlock, but latching on to that thought was dangerous and clouded by a combination of nostalgia and a deeply seated desire to believe that Sherlock wanted him. To be his friend again. Of course, it could be Mary- Moriarty-  anyone trying to get to him using his deepest pressure point. John had learned too much from being married to an undercover assassin with a target on her back to take any messages at face value.
He bit into a chunk of minced lamb, tomato, onion, and pitta as Watson studied him. She had Mary’s thoughtful, analytical gaze, but it was softened by John’s eyes. He didn’t mind being analyzed by her; it felt familiar. It had been years since someone expressed interest in him purely for the purpose of getting to know him, and she was contemplating something.
“Shit. Sherlock, I don’t have any lube.”
the questions.”
The Douglas Promenade Gardens were more vibrant than usual today, with bouquets of hydrangeas, peonies, and calla lilies lining the aisle Rosie would be walking down momentarily. The ceremony was being held just outside the hotel, at the gardens facing the harbor. The weather was on their side, a slight breeze tempering the hot sun. Carl, a pianist friend from school, was playing a softened version of a song from Rosie’s album for the waiting guests. She and Dad looked on from inside the chic vintage car waiting at the start of the aisle.
He opened the door to the room to find a large king-size bed with plush downy sheets, a balcony with a beautiful view of the city and Taipei 101, and a bottle of champagne and flutes above the mini fridge with a note reading “新年快樂 (Xīnnián kuàilè),” but it was an entirely
Xiaowen swallowed. “I’m going to end things with her. Obviously,” she said, though there was an undertone of insecurity. It bothered him. He’d end things on Xiaowen’s behalf right now if he could.
He wouldn’t have been able to identify a shift if he hadn’t been waiting for it, but it was there. He felt a veil of inhibition being lifted.
Sherlock turned to dash, just barely swerving a server with a tray full of drinks. John stood, stunned frozen. “Where are you going?” he called when he found his voice. Sherlock was nearly out of the lobby. “There’s a wedding on!”
Sherlock opened his mouth and closed it again. He awkwardly cleared his throat. “I’m glad you feel that way, John.”

“No trouble. I’m rather bored these days, John. Not bored in the way I used to be, I suppose, but I’ve been actively searching for ‘hobbies’,”  Sherlock said the word as if it were an affront to his existence. “Not ones of the injection variety.”
4. Sauce for a gyro

John contemplated this worriedly around the piece of bacon. This conversation was bringing some unwanted memories of his own sham wedding back to the surface.
Rosie paused her fingers over her laptop keyboard, precariously balanced on her curled knees. Was that too much? “Only lies have detail,” Dad had taught her, growing up. That was so typical of him, so private with the murky minutiae of his past. Rosie had learned to pull information from him detail by detail, with sly prying questions Dad didn’t even realize he was answering. Through the years, she had pieced together a story of her early childhood from strings of key words and recurring characters until it had a semblance of a plot, but there were still some gaping holes.
24. Sherlock investigates them in
John shot Sherlock a confused look. “She’s asking if we’re American.”
Sherlock kissed him, and John could feel the intensity of it course through his body. He gave in completely. Lips gave way to tongue and teeth and Sherlock’s hands running up John’s torso and John’s hands in Sherlock’s hair. Sherlock fumbled with the buttons on John’s shirt and kissed the revealed skin there. “I love you so much, John,” he whispered against John’s chest, which swelled at the words.
Sherlock immediately wraps a hand around his cock, stroking fast. He’s close. “Harder, John.”
“No,” Sherlock says, half-joking, “You like it when I obey your instructions.”

Truth was power. And later, Sherlock felt the rush of it in their bedroom, with John reduced to simpers and whines beneath him, not holding a thing back as Sherlock pounded into him from above.
“There’s a lovely trail at the back of the house we can use, if you’d like.”
Xiaowen recovered. “Yeah, I guess I did. Get bored, I mean. I love chemistry, always have, and I grew up around my family’s tea farm- I understand it. So in my free time, I started growing small batches of different strains until I finally got it right.”
“We have that bit of Xiaowen’s tea left, and I’ve been thinking you might want to talk to Truth Tea John,” he said, and Sherlock loved him impossibly more. He already had 127 different questions he could ask, but it wasn’t the possibility of knowledge that moved him. It was John’s willingness to be irrevocably open with him in this way.
He gently pulled out, sensitive of the fact that Sherlock hadn’t come yet. Sherlock kissed him, still in the throes of arousal. “Touch me, John.” And John did, using quick, efficient strokes.
“I need you to know, John. You weren’t killing me,” Sherlock said, his voice heavy with the weight of confession. John wanted to argue, to tell Sherlock to blame him for everything, but he stopped him. “What was killing me was trying not to love you.”
After putting on his coat, Sherlock firmly grabs both of John’s shoulders and scans his face. Sherlock must not find anything alarming, because he says with confidence, “You’ll be fine. See you tomorrow, John.”
Okay. He could work with performance anxiety. “Even if you mess up- which you

were sliding up and down Sherlock’s body like he’d wanted them to do for years, and he couldn’t pull away. Sherlock was drowning in John’s smell, in that frustratingly familiar pine shampoo, the musky, sweet scent of his sweat. That smell was a drug, and Sherlock was relapsing, running his nose and tongue down the length of John’s neck.
The other man was stockier, but looked strong. “Leave it on. It will be a few degrees cooler on top of the mountain, closer to 15.”
Sherlock ached for all the lost time. The missed connections. But he wasn’t ready then. He had been a different man. They had both been different men, then.
John cleared his throat, recovering from hearing Sherlock’s name in casual conversation (
“I missed you.” It wasn’t in Sherlock’s nature to be romantic, but he felt the truth of this statement in his bones. It was as if they’d been circling in retrograde for the last twenty years, and the planets finally went direct the moment he’d touched down in the same space as John Watson.
“I can’t-, Sherlock, I’m gonna…” Sherlock could feel John’s bollocks tightening, his pelvic muscles contracting. John pulled on Sherlock’s hair, urging him off, but there was no way Sherlock was letting John come anywhere but in his mouth. He wanted to suck him dry.
Here's a short bonus Rosie chapter for your week!
Can you feel it the way I do?"
“I’ll tell you everything, John. But you’ll be unbearably grumpy if you don’t sleep now. It’s for both of our benefits.”
Stella looked outside the car window at the passing green, sheep-covered landscape that faded into the dark blue of the ocean. “I trust Holmes, don’t you?” Rosie hummed, a low, resigned sound. “I can’t hide out forever.”

“I know, but I’m going to try,” John breathes, the sadness he’s suppressed for the last few days finally coming to a head. “I have to try, for Harry.”
Sherlock hums in agreement. “
Sherlock closes his eyes, as if digging in his nightmares for a memory. They don’t talk about the time when he was dead. John assumes this is why- it couldn’t have been pleasant. Sherlock only ever refers to it as his “time away”.
, John’s occasional hookup, of all people? In this moment, when John had been so open, so ready to finally have a conversation? His face hardened.
John wakes at an unknown hour feeling groggy and hungover, despite his lack of a drink for the last few days. His head throbs, and his body aches. He feels soft, pillowy sheets on the exposed skin on his chest, arms and legs that feel unfamiliar, but smell achingly so known. When he finally opens his eyes, he realizes he’s in Sherlock’s bed. There’s a baby monitor on the nightstand, along with a bottle of paracetamol and a glass of water. The room is dark and quiet, but through the window, soft yellow light from the streetlamp streaks the curtains.

Sherlock watches with interest and desire as John’s fist moves slowly up and down his length. “I enjoy watching you like this, too, John. So much new data to catalogue. It’s fantastic.”

Sherlock leaned in to kiss him, and it became heated quickly. John thought about what those lips had done to him downstairs, and his hips jerked, needing the friction. Their cocks rubbed together, and with a bit of time, John probably could’ve come from that alone.
When they stepped inside, Rosie was struck by the decor. She’d seen it on video calls, but the small window of Whatsapp was nowhere near to recreating the total immersive experience of 221B. Two chairs sat in front of the roaring fireplace, so perfectly representative of Dad and Sherlock. Odds and sods littered the place, from a bug collection to three different maps of London pinned to the wall. She recognized a few furniture pieces and blankets from their Manx house Dad must have shipped over- it was only a matter of time before he sold the place. Stella was smiling at a kitschy yellow spraypaint smiley face. “Dad, this place is so...eclectic.”
He rolled his eyes. John was going to be difficult about this.

John was dancing. In public. With Sherlock. At their wedding. It was all a bit unbelievable, to be honest.
“I already do. I always have,” John whispered against his lips, “Yes. A thousand times yes.”
But with John’s head resting on his shoulder, and his own fingers softly stroking his stomach, he could pretend this was normal.
“Mycroft.” he cut off his brother, neither wanting nor needing to hear the end of that sentence. “I know your position on John. It doesn’t change mine. He comes, or I don’t.”
Sherlock smiled, but it faded as he thought of his next question. “If you knew, why…” his voice lowered to a whisper, afraid to ask, “Why did you marry her?”
“You’re mad,” John laughs, punctuating it with a kiss. Sherlock leans into it, and they kiss and kiss until their lips are chapped, until they fall asleep in each other’s arms.
"For I know I hear a bittersweet song
“John,” Sherlock greeted, unbearably casually. He separated from Stella, moving towards John as if he were floating. If he had paid any attention to Stella, he might’ve noticed she was reeling from what must have been an uncomfortably long hug with a stranger (had it been long? John’s timeline had been disrupted). Sherlock’s eyes scanned John’s body for deductions as he glided over, and the familiarity of the gaze was like an embrace. John wondered, not for the first time, what the detective saw. Probably something along the lines of
