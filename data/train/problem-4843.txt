“It’s going to be okay,” She reassured him. “I know you can’t. Shh, I know." She reached for his hand. "Which, is why, I forced him to promise me he wouldn’t come bothering you till you were ready. Mercy me did he flashed me the worst set of puppy-dog eyes I’d ever seen.”
That made Tony chuckle, “Stop pitying me and go make sure Parker doesn’t accidentally set half the building on fire in his eager enthusiasm again.”
, he slowly calmed down. Nice and slow. This was all just a cruel hoax or it was a miracle. He’d pour Pepper’s glass out and lock up the rest till she returned, and he’d just keep breathing.
Tony never openly admitted how much he hated himself. How much everything ached, in his bones and when he breathed or bent his fingers. His existence hurt, but it wasn't without its good parts; like Peter and seeing Pepper and Happy grow closer because they deserved each other. He wasn't directly involved in those good parts. Except, he was. Ironman was his friend. And for some fucked up reason Ironman liked him, and he liked Ironman. But, he
Doom seated himself and snapped his fingers, signaling the servants to bring them chalices full of ice cold water and a tray of appetizers. Ironman quirked a brow as another servant came to unlock the bindings, releasing his wrists. "As I said, Anthony, Doom's Legion was an invitation," Doom said.
"Stark," Doom said, his voice a deep rumble and his accent heavy. "And, Captain America." He announced the latter curiously. Seems like Steve wasn’t a part of either of their plans, funnily enough. Yet Doom was prepared for Captain America all the same, even going so far as to invent special cuffs perfectly crafted to withstand a supersoldier.
“Yes,” She said, cautiously. “And I think perhaps you should rest while you're at it. I’ll come round early in the morning, make sure everything's okay.”
“What?” Tony licked his lips, blinking his eyes open once “Jarvis” slammed the door shut and started the car. “I’d thought you’d be enjoying the view, darling.”
"It's already half-past four in the afternoon," Steve chuckled and ran a hand lovingly through Tony's grease-matted hair. "I brought you a few gifts."
“I need you to come Tony. It’s going to be okay. I’m right here, I’m right here okay? Come, and then it’s okay to be over.” He reassured, beginning to caress the soft skin of Tony’s cock, the whole of it burning hot and twitching in his hand. It was leaking down along his fingers, helping keep his hand slick. Finally, Tony jolted forward, grasping for Steve’s arms—Steve’s anything—as he screamed through his release, strings of white coating Steve’s hand and abdomen.
Ironman cocked his head, "You mean--you'd have to ride me over to safety." He failed to realize what he said until Steve's face flushed a bright, highly attractive pink. He decided not to correct himself. "Bit of a tight fit."
Steve crashed into him; somehow enveloping Tony in the best, bone crushing hug of his life yet without damaging the bouquet in the slightest. It lasted only a few moments before Steve released him, but Universes was it the best few moments of Tony’s entire life.
"I'd be angry had Tony kissed you. You make my blood boil, what you did. Tony can forgive you all he likes; I can forgive you. Forgiveness means nothing when I can't know whether I'm able to trust you. What will you lie about next? Who will you choose over us? I deserve--we deserve your honesty;o let us in. You didn't wanna hurt Tony by lying about our parents? That's too fucking bad. It's a bleeding wound I don't know how to heal because we … I--" It was on the tip of his tongue. "We shouldn't. Somehow, someway, we do," he finished pathetically, yet keeping his eyes locked on Steve's bewildered gaze.
"Tony?" Steve asked softly, turning as best he could in Tony's direction. Well, at least being tied together back to back meant Tony had a fantastic excuse for not having to look at him.
They reached Doom's decrepit workshop--slash--lab, and as Tony figured, Doom was busy huffing at one of his servants dressed in a white lab coat--a scientist, maybe? Doom was still all tall and green, but that, of course, was assuming Doom also didn't have an array of armors he frequently swapped around. They simply happened to all look the same because Doom lacked any sense of style, Tony theorized.
So, supersoldier-proof then. Luckily, escaping wasn't part of the plan. Escaping would come later. Right now was figuring out what other property had been commandeered without him knowledge. Without his permission.
“Sorry if this is weird,” Steve said, grimacing, clearly very nervous. “I wanted to ask you something. Flowers, are, a, the traditional route. I mean, I did think about having fondue but I ended up burning the cheese and uh. I thought you’d maybe like cheese over chocolates, because it’s your favorite--”.
“God Dammit I’m sick of this!” He yelled and threw his dining room table over. He threw the bottles, the glasses, all of it. He was bordering drunk, and everything still hurt deep inside his bones.
"Uh, right." Trap, trap, trap. Tony licked his lips, suddenly very uncomfortable. Correction: more uncomfortable than he was before. "I see. That's why you strapped us together instead of inviting us over for tea."
An idiot Tony apparently liked very much. More than liked. "Okay," he repeated, clinging to Steve long enough to brush their lips together.
Steve’s eyebrows creased together, baffled. “The singings for me?” He wanted to laugh. He figured it’d be okay keeping nude himself, it might even help Tony by watching him get himself off. Regardless, Tony needed to come, and it was going to be excoriating.
"It was easier to disguise myself like this. Had a  little inspiration from Clark Kent," Steve explained, gently settling back onto the bed.
"You left,"came Ironman's unrestrained anger, unlike Tony. "You care about me, but how much?" He left all his other questions on the tip of their tongue (Doom was going to savor this, surely). He was aware Tony had been angry, except he also kissed Steve? He kissed Steve tenderly, and Ironman had been ashamed of himself. He never meant to kiss Steve like that. He never meant to keep going, to, to--he had no words. No explanation for his actions.
"No," Ironman tried clarifying. "Not that. I'm fine. It's only ...you haven't once asked about my armor." He changed the subject, relenting against Steve's adverse embrace.
"Peachy-keen," Tony answered, releasing Steve and making grabby hands. Shockingly, Doom didn't taser him with it, he simply tossed it Tony's way. Pretty trusting, Doom. But, it was more likely that Doom could easily build himself another once he got what he wanted out of Tony. The device, which upon closer inspection was really more like a pink, electric wand-sorta gizmo, sizzled when Tony hit the big yellow button on the side. The platform remained ...well like it's been since Tony stood on it. Doom was expecting him to literally understand the concept of magic, here. Magic. Doom might seriously think he's stupider than he first thought. "Might need a run-down, though."
"I--no?" Tony tried not to croak out. He failed miserably. He knew already. He wasn't blind like everyone enjoyed insisting he was. He had eyes, he'd seen the way Steve looked at him. Tony had been pining for Steve so long. He knows; God, does he know. It wasn't logical, before. The timing was never right. Then there was their age and Steve's utter inexperience in a long-term relationship. Steve's tendencies to keep secrets. Tony’s tendencies to keep secrets. The list was endless.
(Tony never did learn where everyone was, but he was too busy necking with his boyfriend in the tower’s kitchen to care.)
Steve was not far behind him, probably on purpose. Doom wasn't interested in him, that much was certain. Meaning that Doom was more than likely planning to dump Steve somewhere down in the dungeons (or jail, or whatever the hell it was Doom had installed down in the depths below) while Tony would be stuck facing Doom alone. And, yes, Tony originally attempted to do just that, but Steve's crystal clear photographic memory sounded magnificent now after taking in how massive this place was. Deeper, down at Tony's core, he'd rather die by Steve's hand than by Doom's--and wasn't that the most fucked thing imaginable?
And Tony just laughed, a natural tendency regarding the circumstances. "Oh, I'm sure you've done plenty of homework, I sure as hell have. You don't expect me not to invent my way out of hotel Transylvania here and find all the answers my pitiful little heart desires?"
Just believing Steve cherished his friendship as much as he did Steve’s... That, that was perfectly enough. He needed it to be.
"You," Doom addressed to another of his poor lackeys, "Retrieve my equipment!" Which, huh, Tony had bots and Doom had actual people. Not that was anything wrong with people. (Assistants, Tony’s mind supplied.) Doom, though, Doom seemed to enjoy flaunting his status as ruler here. Tony definitely doubted Doom trusted anyone. The curse of genius, maybe?
"He's scared," Steve said, hovering his hand over the hologram to try and scroll down, apparently unsure whether it'd work or not. Friday reacted faster than Ironman, Steve jolting slightly. "Uh, right. Should have known," He then laughed nervously.
"Doom has invited you because, unlike most, Doom admires your genius, Anthony Stark. As such, Doom requires such genius to aid in completing Doom's time machine," Doom explained.
"Tony!" Steve finally answered, lunging behind Doom as Doom was rising off the floor and taking him back down by landing on his shoulders. Tony fired a few more shots, but Steve elbowing Doom's head apparently knocked the guy right out.
“I—” Steve blinked. Oh. Gail was planning a small get together sometime between missions featuring her famous marble cake that Bucky swore by. “It’s been a busy night.” He said casually. Then, “Oh God, Tony. Really? You thought I’d like the Star Spangled Banner?”
Meanwhile, Steve let out a sigh, the bastard, and Tony took a deep, much-needed breath. Might as well accept that he and Steve were stuck with each other. Curious, Tony opted for fondling Steve's hands again with his own, ignoring how it made his heart jump in his chest and started tapping an index finger on the back of one of Steve's hands, hoping Steve's brilliance wasn't gonna fail him now. Delightfully, Steve instantly attempted to tug at his own binding. Tony wondered if Steve had already tried before he was conscious because regrettably, all it did was force a painful sounding grunt out of Steve's mouth.
Eventually, he put two and two together and realized the main controls were connected to the throne on the right side of the armrest, hidden from plain sight. It was in here because Doom tested on his lackeys, didn't he? Of course, he did. Or maybe he just sent them off on ridiculous time travel errands? Most importantly the entire machine seemed powered down. Figures. It was a ploy from the get-go to make sure Tony was close by and in reach. It hardly mattered.
“Ah, the whole erection lasting longer than four hours fiasco?” Tony had cooed, a few hours earlier, smirking and eyes twinkling as Shield medical was looking him over. Technically, yes, the Ultimates were a separate entity from Shield now, but apparently Tony was still working through all the details.
He managed to snag her as his assistant two months back, much to Carol Danvers lack of amusement. Pepper was efficient and was able to keep up with him. Plainly speaking, she refused to take any of his shit. But the important part was that she was easy to get along with and that Tony saw her as his friend, first and foremost.
He welded the door shut, ignoring Pepper’s desperate cries, and later, Pepper’s carefully hidden sorrow when she tore the door right off it's hinges.
Tony didn’t know what to say to that, processing her words. That meant that… that Steve hadn’t died?
"That sounds like the worst idea I've heard all day," Steve said, but he was grinning, coming to meet Tony in an embrace. They were almost the same height, making it easy for Tony to slot their lips together and taste the lingering coffee on Steve's tongue. He ran his hands under Steve's blue dress shirt, trailing his fingertips over Steve's luscious abs, hinting towards his added stipulation if he was planning on doing what Steve demanded.
"I think," Ironman continued, "I think I messed up kissing you. Kissing you first. I won't know till, erm. We didn't bother bringing a phone, too risky," he explained. "Tony's more delicate than ...he's earned you more than me." He wanted to say ‘easily jealous’. It was there, swimming around inside their head since that evening, but damnit, it might have been his own guilt muddling with the rest of their emotions.
His brain immediately thought of pizza, seeing as he was intending to snag a snack before returning to the tower for some tinkering time.
"Rogers," Tony managed, summoning every inch of anger he could muster. "Seriously?" Fortunately, he sounded absolutely pathetic.
The quinjet touched down, Vision briskly moving to greet them. They'd move everyone in groups, but first Ironman went to retrieve Steve's shield, perfected and polished to satisfaction. Friday already knew to request Vision fetch it for them, the smart, darling girl.
There'd be guards off around the corner, but first, Tony lit-up Doom's ridiculous sci-fi wand-thing-a-mah-bob and jammed it in Doom's shoulder. "Steve, you good?" he called out, dodging Doom's punch and flexing his fingers. His whole body felt taut and stiff, the metal thrumming to life and slowly enveloping him, round and round in strings of red until he was standing in full armor. The night vision kicked on, allowing him to catch Steve throwing said lackeys gently onto the floor.
Steve snorted, feeling hot all over. “That’s a fantasy alright. I guarantee you’d be choking on my name.”
Ironman scoffed. Steve was such an ass. "Please, just sit back down. We'll worry about your supersoldier metabolism in just a minute. First, I need to know what the fuck you think you're doing here. I mean, what is this with the beard and the horrible paint job?" He gestured at Steve's uniform with a finger. "Jesus, you even ripped the star out."
Pepper merely sighed. “We’re all very proud of you Tony. This life isn’t a cheerful, you can't argue I don’t I know it. Timely likes keeping it's misery in reserve, but it’s too been striving to do better and so have you.”
Steve blinked, a flush peeking through that damned beard. "Whatever ..." Steve tried. "Uh. Y--Yeah, um. Certainly unorthodox since we haven't even held hands. The uniform’s, uh, it's--"
Tony gave a half-hearted shrug, keeping silent the rest of way back to the mansion until he shut himself away inside his room.
Steve chuckled, “I missed you too. Miserably, you know." Tony heard him cross his arms. "I think I’m driving Red Wolf and Nat crazy asking about you all the damn time. See, they assured me keeping my distance till you were ready was sound advice. Sure, maybe a week or two, but now I'm just hurt.”
"Tony, hold up!" Steve called from behind him, but Tony kept up his pace. He wasn't angry. He wasn't ... Ironman was him. They shared this broken body together, housing fragments of the pain he'd endured from Afghanistan, from Vanko, from staring into the blackness of space through the portal and falling aimlessly to his death. He did his research. After, after Siberia, he finally chose to see a psychiatrist. He was working on taking his meds and remembering to do his mindfulness breathing exercises. He was trying to stop the catastrophic thinking.
"Lay on the bed, if you please," Ironman gestured. This next part wasn't gonna help with that whole complicated feelings thing, unfortunately. "I'm gonna ...um. Cuddle. We can cuddle without killing each other. I hope? Can’t be blowing our cover, now can we?”
Steve's arms then ensnared him, both their cheeks pressed together, Ironman refusing to lift the faceplate back on over his head. He blasted down through the cobblestone using a repulsor because, hey, that was half the damn fun, wasn't it? It wasn't like they were flying far, only to the spot where Ironman had placed the others. He was pleased to see several of them had already started waking up. He'd call for proper transport and medical, just in case. These people would need assistance.
"Like lab rats." Tony's distaste could be heard in his own voice. "Might've been dark but he's already gotten what he wanted. I think he allowed you to stay was because he hoped I'd show how the armor worked." Then he wrinkled his nose in disgust, "He's got footage of us kissing."
Ironman squinted for dramatic effect, responding, "You--you asshole! Flirting with u--yes. Yes, this would work. The armor is more than durable enough. You're like what, the equivalent of fifteen people, twenty.
"Tony," Steve's voice cracked, taking it with both hands. "Tony you didn't have to. You didn't; you really, really didn't."
And that was saying a lot, seeing how the school was always growing, always building. There were always new enemies and students sometimes Tony got overwhelmed in the chaos. He wasn’t counting that time he willingly spent the day with Loki just so he could avoid Amora badgering him for a “date” (again).
Doom simply tugged at his shoulder, directing him opposite of where his guards where taking Steve. "Answers Doom was already glad to give. Perhaps you were aware the Legion was an intentional invitation. The Captain, unfortunately, is an unexpected guest." He was leading Tony into a rather ornate dining hall, draped in purples and golds. There were fruit bowls on either end of the dark wood table, while a fire burned inside the fireplace center of the wall. "Come, sit," Doom commanded.
Then, without braving their new host's leniency, Ironman pulled out his chair and stalked out of the room. He insisted he know where his and Steve's shared quarters were, stopping in the middle of the barely-lit hall to ask a guard. The guard answered and let him go about his way, but Ironman had no doubt there were guards and probably all sorts of gadgets blocking the exits in case they tried to escape. So, he subtly surveyed the immediate area best he could. Mostly it was all just dark and damp with very few rooms, and then the stairwell leading up towards the bedrooms as he had been told.
“Red Wolf’s back.” Natasha, he mentally correct himself, said. Her face was pensive as she straightened herself out. “Peter came running back in shock, saying Rogers was with him.”
“Okay,” Tony said, resigning, all the anxiety washing out of him. He was gonna be cranky for days, and would probably succeed in driving Steve mad like he so often did Pepper on the harder days. “As long as you love me.”
powerful, powerful enough to tear apart Tony’s armor, and exposing Tony to whatever was left AIM left wafting through the air. Steve was automatically immune, and their rogue criminal Steve didn’t really care about asking the name of was detained unscathed.
Steve was actually really cute when he was flustered. He flushed straight down from his forehead to his neck, the grimace falling away as he bit his lip while he was thinking about how he wanted to answer.
"Stark," Someone whispered, and then there was a heavy weight pressing against his shoulders. Not the cave. This isn't Afghanistan. This isn't ...
"Did you now? For little old me?" He tried looking around, but Steve took hold of his chin, holding him still.
The medical aid only pursed her lips in response to Tony’s shameless teasing. “Sure looks like it, Mr. Stark. Only this isn’t as easy as dealing with Viagra like you first theorized. I’m ordering a full set of labs and I’m going to insist you remain hospitalized until we can figure out what we’re actually dealing with here.”
Ironman. His life was so fucked up, his brain split apart to so it could deal with it and he ...cared about himself. And he ...betrayed himself?
Steve sucked in a breath, hesitating to speak but ultimately shaking his head, "Nevermind. Shoot." He pointed to the console, and Ironman glared at him, slack-jawed. There was absolutely no way in hell that Steve could have figured out Ironman, and Tony, had planned to blow this place. "What?" Steve quirked a cocky, well-defined brow. (They were so discussing that later.)
"And, about your parents ..." Steve sounded remorseful. Yet, he was right in Tony's little bubble the moment Tony circled right back to the monitor, kicking Doom's head along the way.
"Oh, God! Tony, I thought you'd been defenseless the whole time, and I was sitting here worrying about you when you've been carrying the damn armor in your body?" Steve yelled, standing to meet him.
“Come on.” Steve helped him up, “I’ve dreamt about holding you in my arms long enough. I’ll get us some water and we can figure it out in the morning.”
Steve resisted breaking the handle and busting the door down, instead slowly pushing it open. He briskly walked past the archway and tried to not absolutely lose his mind at the sudden sight of Tony with his legs stretched wide, stuffed full on a pink, semi-opaque dildo.
Tony failed to be anything but a drunk before Steve was dead. Yet all it took was Steve dying and the unbearable pain Tony felt from losing him to push Tony forward. These last months gave Tony the time to reflect how much Steve truly meant to him; both as his dear friend and as someone Tony didn't realize he'd fallen in with. And how, at the end of it all, there wasn’t really a distinguishable distinction between the two.
“That makes me feel so much better,” Then Steve was sitting down next to him, removing the bottle from Tony’s grasp. “I spent months on the brink of death with an infected wound and a punctured lung hoping you all were alright. Turns out it was going to be okay. Fisk and Roxxon got what they deserved, and you.” Steve breathed deeply, “Well, and you came out of it unharmed, toting a giant medieval battle machine over there.”
No one said such as a word about it. No one pressured him or pushed him farther than he desired to be pushed.
Yet unfortunately, it was never a reasonable idea to just say fuck it, wear earplugs and fake a smile the whole time. Trust him, he's learned that one the hard way.
That was a lie. Ironman felt pity for him and plenty more. The great tangled web that was Ironman and Tony's connection didn't end at Tony's continual suffering. They shared it all together. They shared their hopes and dreams, and they shared their love. Love that was often never cherished or freely and openly given. Loving Steve Rogers was ... bittersweet. "I don't want you to do anything besides give me your hands." He sighed.
Tony had never heard Steve babble like this before. Steve was nothing but the straight forward, to the point Captain. But, but Steve liked him so much that Steve was suddenly an adorable mess?
"Shh!" Tony cut Steve off. The sound of heavy footsteps thudded along the stone floor as a caped figure stalked through the narrow doorway. He was tall, dressed head to toe in glittering silver-looking armor that was adorned with a green, fluttering cape. Victor von Doom, ruler of Latveria, a small country in Europe. A Proud scientist and inventor, from what Tony could gather on the guy. Doom had all the juicy details about himself heavily encrypted, which was a pretty huge testament to his brilliance.
"Yes. Of course. Absolutely. But the suit’s also in me. Literally. Call it an upgrade if you will. I don't want tall, green, and probably handsy discovering it." Then he intended to explain the rest of it. Most of it, anyway, excluding the whole “Tony's an idiot when it comes to EMP's” thing. Instead, he was taken aback by Steve's genuine look of concern. "You're cuddling me."
“I’m nothing but a patriot,” Tony mock saluted. Steve shut him up by slowly dragging out the dildo buried in his ass, twisting occasionally. Tony’s eyes fluttered and his jaw went slack. “Steve,” He moaned softly, his breathing heavy. “Steve, darling. I’m simply—uhn,” And then Steve pressed the tip of the tentacle inside him, so utterly captivated by the raw, unadulterated lust in Tony’s expression.
"Okay, first things first: how does it work? Second, what's specifically wrong with it? Then, finally, I’m hoping you've got the tools needed to mess around with this thing," Tony said, kneeling down to spread a hand along the device. It was smooth and cool to the touch, and when Tony gently pressed down, it sunk slightly into the floor. Weight-activated then. Pity, Tony always loved those cylindrical metal boxes that flashed pretty colors in old sci-fi movies. (That was a thing, right? Tony was positive that was a thing. Otherwise, he'd like to remind everyone it's been a good while.)  "Heh," he snorted at himself.
Doom chuckled, "Doom assures you, Stark, he has not overlooked your craftsmanship. It's with great honor and respect that Doom has decided to harvest and salvage this Legion at all. You live up to your name, and to your reputation."
“Yes,” Tony nodded his head, biting his lip as Steve took just as slowly filling him back up, savoring each desperate moan and cry for Steve to go faster, go harder. Eventually, Steve took hold of his own cock and pumped it just for Tony to see, like he’d imagined earlier. Slow and earnest, but quick. Steve had already been so worked up.
“Cap!” Tony yelped quite pathetically. “Didn’t see you there.” He then said trying to regaining his composure. The enticing, wonderful aroma was two-fold now. Tony could pinpoint the sage almost dominating the cheese with its intensity, and--Huh. “So, uh, just a passing thought, but where is everyone, and also, why do you smell like gourmet cheese?”
"Of course I was worried! I've been worried the whole time! I've never seen you do something so stupid without a backup plan,." Steve continued to argue. "And if I recall, it was you who kissed me!"
He hated how her words failed to make him feel any better. Instead, he found himself stuck on how it wasn't just about him. Fisk's mess cost Pepper her fiance, a gentle-hearted man known as Happy Hogan.
“Ah,” Tony purred, craning his head in a desperate pursuit for more. “Doing this sober was probably my first mistake.”
"It'd mean a lot to me because I'd get to share the occasion with my best fella," Steve flushed. Tony liked it when Steve flushed. The pink glowed down from his ears to his toes, and it was all Tony's to admire. Rarely, Steve would also fidget with his fingers, but he would still stare Tony down with a defiant glare at the very same time like he was now.
“When you’re feeling better I’d like you to come with me and meet Bucky and Gail,” Steve said briskly. He shifted his gaze on Tony’s throbbing cock, hoping to ease the sudden anxiety building in his chest.
He locked the door to his shop, then checked the main floor before locking the rest of it down too, making certain Pepper also didn’t forget her hat again while dutifully ignoring him.
Yes, yes. Great name for a separate personality. It was mostly Tony that found it funny. For him, for Iron Man, it was simply his name. His being: forged in the heat that molded the armor and the endless torture Tony had suffered deep within that very cave in Afghanistan.
"The rest of you--" Steve began, then amended, "You're in," he searched for the right word, "total agreement? I'm not sure how to..."
His cock was still very hard in Steve’s hand, but Steve pulled Tony forward into a hug and began stroking a clean hand through his hair. “Shh, Tony. It’s over.”
"Nobody’s going to come running, that's for sure,” Steve said. "But it's dead quiet. You're right, something's fishy," he confirmed.
Tony blinked, carefully returning Steve's embrace while doing another scan of the room. "There should be way more guards, shouldn't there?" he whispered against Steve's ear, unintentionally causing Steve to shiver.
"Maybe Doom is more of a genius than I've been giving him credit for," he mused, gesturing for Steve to sit right back down before the Supersoldier regrets it.
"I have a headache," he managed to say once Steve caught up with him. "I reckon catching a glimpse at that machine Doom's got might do the trick. Doom's probably around tinkering himself if he's as great as he says he is. You're officially on Dum-E duty." He patted Steve's shoulder without making eye contact, leading the way.
There he found his and Steve's quarters by the crack in the door; first on the left amongst the row of other doors. "Rogers," he greeted upon entering, spotting Steve sitting on the massive, purple duvet.
“More like dumb luck and Fisk’s ability to miss the careful details because he was too high on the moment.”
Once he was calm, it all came back to him: the rogue Iron Legion that survived after Ultron--the obvious trap too tempting to resist. He cocked his head to the side, and ah, there said Iron Legion was. Clean and sleek, and so, so clearly a bastardized zombie of his once beautiful creation. It was a bittersweet thought and a cruel reminder that regardless of his choices, his mistakes always came back to haunt him.
“Steve, really now.” And then Tony was laying back on the bed, scowling. Or, well Steve thought it looked more like pouting.
"Tony," Steve complained. "Riding you wouldn't be too aerodynamic. We'd have to embrace, I think. Am I the perfect height? Probably." Then he pressed the entirety of his body flush against Ironman's front once he turned Ironman away from the monitor desk. "Like this, yes?"
Natasha kept silent, leading him along towards the Sheriff’s office. He pressed his hand against the breast of his coat pocket, feeling the indent of the star beneath it.
Tony paced down the steps of Doom's ridiculously placed stairwell, his lips, and cheeks tender from Steve's stupid beard. He slipped back into control long after Steve was content having ravished his mouth, and Ironman had been idly running a hand through Steve's hair.
When he glanced back, he suddenly noticed Steve's beard, opting to ignore Steve's shocked, wide-eyed expression. It was attractive. It was beyond attractive; it was something for which Tony had no other words to describe. Looking at Steve was painful, seeing the torn uniform painted black. Simply because… because Tony had cared. Because Tony had yearned;Tony had wanted. He had wanted to be open, to be vulnerable for Steve in a way that so few were allowed to see. It wasn't because Steve was so gotdamn handsome, either. Steve was soft, underneath the layers of bullheadedness and bravado. Tony seemed to fall for soft people, really. He was drawn to them like a moth to a flame, dreaming they'd be gentle enough to care how tender his heart truly was.
“You’re sweating,” Was all Steve decided to say. He ignored the memory of helping Tony get dressed in the medical room’s bathroom stall. There was no hoping everyone in the building hadn’t heard the way Tony loudly decided to admire his hips in the mirror because Steve’s sweatpants were, in his words, so perfectly snug on the waist.
"So, you're fine with him making off with your armor schematics?" Steve pressed his lips together into a thin line, a hand resting under his chin.
Steve, in the meanwhile, had huffed, trying to maintain eye contact before he lost his mind staring at the tent inside Tony’s trousers.
"I love you," Tony said simply. He finished that second cookie and stood up, slowly working on stretching his muscles.
She had left out her sherry. The bottle was corked, but her glass was still partly full like she’d ran mid-sip in a mad dash. Hell, she’d even left her nice, fancy sash behind too.
“If I thought you liked me back I would’ve cornered you months ago!” Tony blurted, the adrenaline making his fingers tingle. “By what I mean, is, uh. I have a massively huge crush on you, but you’re you. So, I just accepted being your friend-slash-rival was all there was. Which-- which, you know,” he was stammering now, “is fine. I love being your friend-slash-rival! Nothing wrong with it, honestly! I wouldn’t trade it for anything in the world.”
Ironman snorted, and took Steve's hand, walking them inside the quinjet as Vision directed everyone else in their steed. "You're smarter than that, I'd hope."
"He mentioned some nonsense about a time machine. Totally sounds ridiculous because it is. I think he's got more dirt on my tech than he's letting on. And, I'm without a doubt that he's interested in my latest armor as well."
Ironman nodded, reaching to grasp Steve's hand in their own, "I'm sure you can come. We have a gift for you, anyway. We'll argue about it on the way to the compound." He didn't elaborate that he meant the Accords. Nor did he express his desire for Steve to start therapy. Steve would have to stop being a wanted criminal, first. There was going to be lots of arguing.
Doom was hardly down long. "In your body? Yes, how fascinating." He swung again. The guards started to pile in, Steve dusting through them like they were nothing. "It is the components of this technology that Doom needs to stabilize the field."
Tony shrugged helplessly. “He shot you, Steve. He shot you dead. What was I supposed to do?” Well, the cat was out of the bag now, he supposed. “I was going to kill them all or die trying. It was the least that I … It was the least I could do, for you.”
"Everybody's bound to know we went at it by now, Steve," Tony decided to comfort him. "It's ...it's just--" This was the hard part. "Why did you kiss me? Why did you kiss me back?"
. He was already making headway for the first patient on lamps powered by electricity instead of gas. In fact, he was the middle of trying to not shock himself several times building them.
"You weren't too upset about it!" They were getting off track. Something was off. Doom shouldn't have been so easy to take down.
He’d seen Tony naked countless times. It was impossible to miss when Tony was being loaded into the Iron Man armor, already drunk and nude. God, Tony was still coated in that slimy shear green goo, erection throbbing painfully, and so, so red at the tip when they hauled him out of it like everything was perfectly normal. Except, of course, it wasn’t.
“Oh, Steve.” Tony looked as flushed as Steve felt. “You’ve always been so pretty. I really am too scared the friction against my cock will burn. Maybe, um, maybe you can just fuck me with the toy? Any of the toy’s you’d like. That’d have to count. And, oh darling, the singing's for you.” He needed to clarify.
. You’re always right when it comes to me and the overworking, and ... I left the shop open. I noticed you’d ran off without your things, and I was worried. And then, you know... this.” He gestured towards at empty, moonless street they were standing in. She merely frowned.
Steve woke Tony with a kiss just below his jaw. Tony had been slouching forward in his chair, his head resting on the workbench after pulling another all-nighter.
Ironman blinked, "A time machine?" he asked, only slightly baffled. Doom was a bit of a nut, after all. "You want me to fix your time machine?" He tried not to laugh. The mechanics and science needed for time travel were literally impossible. Next, you'll be telling him it's possible to travel from here to Timbuktu through a portal made of magic. Hah!
"The genius didn't think to bring a notepad." Steve said wryly. Then Steve was right there, hovering close and caressing a thumb along their cheek. "I can wait. Tony will tell me, won't he? How he feels? What he wants?"
“I thought you’d be busy fucking one of your pretty girls,” He blurted. Then he winced; Good Job Steve. “I’m sorry I didn’t mean—”
"I also brought you a tree," Steve said next, gesturing behind him near the lab's entrance. There was one small, fresh cut evergreen already propped in a stand. But there was also a small artificial white one, complete with lights sitting right next to the evergreen that Steve must have set up minutes before coming to wake him.
"There wasn't much. It was heavily protected by several passwords, which were easy enough." Steve followed behind, and--God. Steve had finished in the blink of an eye.
"Hmph," Doom cut in, stepping between them. "I see. This explains much. Bold of you to presume Doom would allow you the comfort of one another's company."
The size of Doom's staff inside the (sort of?) fake castle was underwhelming. There were the four people in lab coats, and barely twenty guards plus the seven Steve took down in the lab. The caste itself was underwhelming upon further inspection. Horribly underwhelming. Besides the stairwell and the upper rooms, there was just one other room downstairs round another corner from the dining hall. Any transport used to escort Doom's tiny team of goons wasn't to be found, either.
“Cocky. Alright, darling. I’ll be choking on your name you’ll be fucking me so hard, hnn.” Tony grimaced, digging his fingers into the sheets. “Don’t arouse me like that, it’s painful enough as it is.” He panted, in pain again.
"Watch it, Prince-Charming," Tony snatched his hand back. "You're embarrassing me in front of our captors," he said, desperately hoping he wasn't blushing. Ironman never once seemed like he flushed while kissing Steve. Obviously it was hard to tell, and obviously, this was really, really stupid. He needed Steve to log into the mainframe while he was busy distracting Doom. They'd have actually discussed this if Ironman hadn't--ugh! He was the one that stormed off because he was so--so jealous. Of himself!
Doom chuckled, clearly amused. "Let us make our guests welcome, shall we." He directed his guards, who appeared seemingly from nowhere, to come and assist them through the long, expectedly dark hallways of his castle. He was probably going for the aesthetic, Tony mused, noting the pristine statues and jewels that adorned a few of the open rooms they passed.
It wasn’t till Tony sucked in a harsh breathe into his neck, Steve trying, and failing, not to rustle him too hard down the stairs that Steve realized Tony was also in severe pain.
Steve bit his lip, making his way all the way to Tony’s room, but hesitant to knock on the door. He could hear Tony’s labored breathing through the walls due to his enhanced hearing; and the low, drawn-out moan Tony uttered when he was being fucked just right.
“What a fucking bastard,” He bit out. He felt his heart pick up speed, dread flooding the pit of his stomach forty times worse than it had last night.
Tony fired up his repulsors, shooting Doom right in the chest and knocking him onto his back. "Wait, I really was here to help with your crazy-assed time machine?" He barely dodged Doom's slide-kick from the ground, jetting himself into the air. Then he aimed for one of Doom's hands, blasting it. It barely did any damage--Doom was good, Tony would grant him that.
"A-oh, Doomie," Tony hollered across the room, casually snatching a screwdriver leaning off one of the many tables littering the place. Yeah, sure, it actually was pretty tidy but it was a shop after all. "I think you got a little time machine for me." He twirled the screw-driver between his fingers.
Steve had waited for him. That's he kept reminding himself, making his way toward the workshop dressed in a fresh pair of hemmed trousers and an old, beat up shirt. Steve was waiting for him now, and wasn’t that wonderful? His Steve was actually alive. Heart beating, blood pumping; not dead. Not gone.
“Shh,” Tony quieted him. “No offense taken, sweetheart. I’d of liked to, if we’re going to be honest with each other. But I fear that’d be somewhat difficult to enjoy.” He gestured to himself. “I do have a reputation to uphold.” Right, because of the pain. Steve was ashamed he’d forgotten.
Tony isolated himself for two straight weeks. His urge to drink swayed only by the comfort of his bed and the sound of metal denting beneath the blow of his hammer.
"I always thought I was," Steve replied, smug. Right. That whole breaking a log in two with his bare hands on Clint's farm.
That gave Tony pause, stopping himself mid-bite on his second cookie. This was unusual for Steve, mostly because Steve liked making his gifts; sketches and sometimes extra sappy things like giving him a full-on foot massage. "Huh," He blinked. "So you mean, you wasted money on me to go all evil scientist, but Christmas style?" Something deep inside him felt all snuggly and warm. The implicit demand of needing to attend hardly bothered him. He was kind of impressed, actually.
"Funny," Ironman bit out, beginning to pace across the surprisingly large space and pinching the bridge of his nose. "You don't have that right, Rogers. And if I get my way you'll never get that right," he let slip aloud. Argh, damnit! Luckily Steve hardly seemed to notice his little slip of tongue, choosing to keep pouting.
Tony dashed out the door, crashing into Widow Barnes instantly. “What is it now?” He groaned, aiming not to slip as he regained his balance.
"It's a trap," Steve clarified. "The Legion was only part of it. It's a fake lab. Must be, give or take a few things. It'd seemed too convenient he'd just let me stay here as your boyfriend after I thought about it a while. I'm too much of a threat if he wanted your armor."
“I’ll be gentle,” Steve swallowed and started stripping down. He wasn’t leaving, not until he knew Tony was going to be alright. His attraction—his feelings—they didn’t matter. It wasn’t like it was the worst thing he’d have to suffer. This was for Tony. “And, and you can sing whatever is you want.”
Steve kissed him, threading his fingers through Tony’s oil greased hair. “Next time I’m telling Nat to piss off.” He said seconds after.
He focused on the sweet aroma. It was fresh and subtly sweet, like a garden almost. Maybe a … well, maybe a kitchen or a bakery or something he questioned once he was close enough to pick up on the heavy scent of cheddar.
Tony still had the other dildo inside him, and he spread his legs even further apart to allow Steve to kneel between them. “I appreciate the sentiment. It’s very touching,” Tony said, and then paused, taking Steve in. “My, my, you’ve really forgotten haven’t you?” He reached to brush a hand along Steve’s cheek, causing Steve to shiver and lean down closer towards him. “You darling, brute of a man. It’s been your birthday going on six hours now. You’ve missed the fireworks? They’ve been going all week.”
He drowned in whiskey to numb the pain but it numbed fucking nothing. There was no liquid courage, no nothing, not anymore. He drank to stifle the anxiety but was still hiding away like some pariah afraid to face society. He drank and he was still so terrified to even look at Steve in the face.
He missed Steve, desperately so sometimes it weighed him down. It’d been several months since it all changed. The town, the people. All of it. He’d been doing good when it came to craving a sip of whiskey or a taste of wine. But sometimes he got so lost remembering Steve, and how the blood trailed in the dirt he had to hammer pieces of metal till they were junk just so the urge to give in would stop.
“I, oh.” Tony bounced on his toes, outstretching his arms in what he hoped was an obvious invitation for Steve to hug him. “Come on you big doof, hug me. Please?”
Ironman considered himself better suited for the situation at hand. Tony shouldn't be subjecting himself to continual trauma over and over again like he does. Like ...they do. Ironman had a better stomach for it and was more than willing to use their MMA training to his advantage, plus a chair or two as a weapon. Finding the exit shouldn't be too difficult, then once out in the open air, he'd summon the armor and they'd be out of there. It defeated Tony’s purpose for getting caught in the first place, sure. Unfortunately for Tony, Ironman thought it was an exceptionally dumb plan to begin with. Well, they both knew it was stupid.
"It's--it's not obvious?" Steve blurted out and Tony almost jumped right out of his skin. There was no anger in his voice, only a whine. He was pleading so desperately that Tony moved to squeeze his shoulder.
Eventually, Tony relented, dragging Steve down to cuddle next to him. “Alright, darling. This time I’ll let you win.”
"Thank you," Tony said when they were done, holding Steve's equally dirty hands in his. "Next time, how about we stay in and watch dumb holiday movies until I'm so bored we have to make hot chocolate instead?"
“Oh, um.” Steve shuffled, clearly bashful about something. “That’s because, er, for you.” And from behind his back, Steve revealed a large bouquet of yes; cheese and herbs arranged just like a regular bouquet of flowers. Specifically, cheddar cheese, which was beyond obvious by now, and a selection of what Tony realized was a blend of sage and thyme.
The drink was harder to put back down having started right back up again. Except, instead of singing horribly in the street, he hummed tunes in the lap of his armor, hiding safely away inside the workshop.
"Doom," Tony finally acknowledged, "Interesting setup you've got here. I'm assuming here is, of course, your personal headquarters? It must be, what with the Frankenstein contraptions, and--oh. That beautiful piece of mastery you've transformed into the robotic equivalent of a cheap CGI'd special effect from the early nineties."
"Did I do that?" A beat. "Ah, yeah. Okay. I absolutely did that. If you're mad about it, you should be a hundred-percent aware it's your own damned fault. I absolutely don't forgive you, by the way. I--I can't forgive you. Not right now. It's too soon." He averted his eyes. "But by the power
"Tony?" Steve asked, clearly confused, but offered up his hands regardless. Ironman dug for a piece of wire stuffed in their pants, picking at the latches to Doom's fancy contraption and eventually freeing Steve from the bindings.
"No," Steve set his jaw, looking determined as ever. "I know I fucked up, Tony. I know I did. This isn't about the Accords or Ross, or whoever the fuck else! You were doing the right thing, and I was doing the right thing. I--I never told you about the bunker because I didn't want you risking Ross' wrath. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I was an ass about it. But you came. Because that's what you do. Because that's who you are, Tony. And I--I never told you about Howard and your mother because I," his gaze swept back to the floor, "because I was a coward. It hurt. It hurt so much knowing. Howard was my friend, and I-- everyone I've ever cared for, Hydra destroys; murders, tortures."
Feeling along his restraints, he was then also reminded of his companion, still holding most of their weight against him. Deciding to take the risk of being a creep, he continued moving his hands to where their binding met, the two of them purposely stuck together. He had to swallow the dread crawling up his throat when he felt the familiar material of a certain Supersoldier's, personally hand-crafted uniform, rough and matted with dirt. Great. Perfect. He felt above the wrist and was disappointed to find nothing more than the rest of Steve's arm.
Steve smiled softly, rocking back and forth on his feet almost nervously. "I assumed two trees might be necessary for what I've got planned." He was hesitating to finish, making Tony quirked a brow and motion him to please continue. "Uh, once Natasha and Clint are done arguing about where they'd like the tree to be, I requested we all decorate it together." He took a breath, "And, by we, I mean all of us. Including you." It was a statement, not a question. "So, I decided before-hand, I'd let you blow off some steam--whatever you wanted to do with your two new trees. Blow them up, maybe?"
Once he came, he used it to slick up his fingers and pressed a thumb delicately against Tony’s cock. “Is this okay?” He asked, keeping it as still as possible while effectively pounding Tony into the mattress using the toy.
"It's not necessarily ...comfortable," Ironman wavered in saying. Describing what it was like was, well, difficult. It was heavy. They could literally feel it dragging their limbs down, like wearing exercise weights. Yet injecting the armor straight inside their bones removed the constant strain against their chest from the arc reactor pressing down, being heavier too than most people expected. Yes, it was mostly the casing, even in the armor. It didn't matter. After Siberia ... "He must have to constantly change in and out of his armor in order to just sleep or eat, or... Summoning it automatically from within his body might alleviate some of the discomfort. Though, he could have actually fucking asked."
It wasn’t Steve’s. Steve’s belonged to Red Wolf now, as it should. But it gave Tony a sense of comfort either way.
“It’ll be happening, trust me. You and Pep are dumping all the bottles out in the dirt and setting that safe on fire. Cryings all I’ve got left, otherwise I’m going to I’m going to blister my hands wasting my well-paid iron.”
The three of them--if this was going where Ironman hoped it was going. A bit of a bitter hope, on his end. A painful one, on Tony's. "Stay close." He focused on the task at hand, "And be ready." The backs of Steve's fingers delicately tracing the sensitive skin of his cheek made him shiver, their--his and Tony's--fingers tapping away, breaking down Doom's programming to its bare bones and initiating the self-destruct sequence.
“I’m glad.” Steve said, “ It was hard to find anyone willing to bother. Edible flowers are hard enough to come by as it is, so I decided it’d be easier just growing a selection of fresh herbs in my dorm. The cheese was easier, um. I’d love to have made that on my own too, but. It sounded fun, honestly. Except, the lack of resources, that being cows. Or, or goats.”
Tony was crying, tears staining his cheeks and wetting Steve’s shoulder. “It’s hardly close to over,” He gasped. “But it’s …better.”
Ironman told him he was worth protecting. Written in such elegant handwriting, Tony was frankly disturbed it had been done with his own hand. They liked sharing a notebook to communicate over using a tablet or something much more reasonable like one of Tony's heavily encrypted phones. It was more personal that way--and so, so creepy. Ironman was blunt but deeply affectionate. He doodled--doodled!--little pictures of him and Tony hugging. Said that's all he wanted, to be able to hold Tony and keep him safe.
"Yes," Steve agreed, "I did, Tony." He met their eyes, "What can I ...what can I do?" he asked so softly, Ironman almost felt pity for him.
"Stark," Doom's voice boomed. "And Captain, we meet again," he greeted, stalking, always stalking, towards them. "It's not far from which you stand," He gestured to a metal panel along the floor, several feet in diameter. It was, very unsurprisingly, directly below a raised platform holding a throne. Tony doubted many even had the privilege of being let in here. It was, you know, pretty classic egotistical villain behavior.
"It's not the strangest request Doom has received." Doom chuckled again, sipping his water through a straw. Not surprisingly, he hardly touched any of the food his servants had brought. Which, honestly, Ironman figured it'd be pretty awkward stuffing food through his faceplate. They did that a couple of times in the Iron Man armor when it just seemed too inconvenient back during those early days, even if all they really ate were smoothies. "On one condition, regarding why, Doom has so generously invited you," Doom finished saying.
So, he'd wanted to avoid bringing everyone down with his mood by not going. He would have had just started a pissing contest after the crowds started making him cranky, especially with the constant bombardment of Christmas music apparently everyone else other than him enjoyed so much. But, God, did he hate it.
"I ...I was worried you were going to hate me forever," Steve's voice went soft, coming to hesitantly embrace him, armor and all. "It's a mess, Tony; you and me. I wish it wasn't."
“Pretty sure we gotta go on at least a few dates first. I’m thinking homemade pizza, extra cheese.” He’d hate to waste the fresh herbs.
"I should add," Tony said, cutting through the rather loud clacking of their boots hitting the stone floor, "that if we're intending to all have one big, snuggly sleepover, I'm not inclined to sleep away from my darling Captain." He faked his way through sounding ... well, he wasn't sure how he sounded. Anything but bitter and resigned was good enough for him, and being him, he was astutely a master of faking his way through horrible circumstances.
"There's more of Sam's Mom's, cookies?" Tony said with a smile, making grabby-hands towards the box Steve magically had behind his back, placing them on the work table next to Tony's schematics. They smelled divine--and, oh! They just so happened to be gingerbread, one of Tony's favorites!
Sheriff Rogers was always a tough son of a fuck. He rivaled Tony’s wit on the best of days, always managing to impress Tony when Tony decided to fake being shit-faced someday's, convinced maybe that was the day it'd all get better. Not that it ever did, anyway.
See, Christmas wasn't Tony's thing. In fact, it was amazing he wasn't giving into the urge to drown his thoughts with a bottle of Jack right about now (regardless of the fact he'd just woken up). The holidays were always a sort of solemn time for him. His father was never home, and on the rare occasion his mother was, she'd be plastering on her best media smile like he was stupid enough to fall for it. The only worthwhile memories he had were of Jarvis. Butler Jarvis, alongside his precious wife Ana, who'd take take him the kitchen for both Hanukkah and Christmas dinner almost every year till he was shipped off to boarding school.
"Right," Steve said very slowly, already expecting the nitty-gritty details of Ironman's plan. Faintly, Ironman could hear his stomach gurgle, leaving him  suddenly feeling guilty that he didn't snag an appetizer tray or wait for any dinner Doom might have been interested in offering. Ironman tried not to shiver, and suddenly Steve was latching onto him like an octopus. "Come on, let's get under the blankets," Steve suggested.
“Tell you what, I’ll go shower IF you say yes to going out tonight,” Tony points a wrench at Rhodey, who rolls his eyes.  “Let’s go out, find some company, get wasted and be thoroughly debauched?”
“Don’t S.H.I.E.L.D. usually handle all that shit?” Tony asks.  “I mean, aren’t you guys like, their super sexy superhero branch?”
Tony then turns on his heel and heads for the door to leave, all the while feeling the weight of Rogers’ eyes on his back as he walks away. Spurred on by how it feels to be watched, he adds a little more sway than usual into his hips as he walks.  What? He’s got a great ass and he’s not afraid to use it.
Pepper has ordered Tony to stay away from the office for as long as he needs, which suits him perfectly because he’s always preferred to be in his workshop anyway. He does the whole boardroom and meetings thing when he has to, but he’s always been better when he’s elbow deep in metalwork or computer parts. It calms his mind to be able to build things, to shape things. After dusting off the Iron Man plans, Tony dived head first into building the thing. The project was something he had thought about since he was a child, but he’d never had the means to do it until now. So he spends his recovery time crafting and shaping, bringing the exo-armour to life. Each part is a shield, made to measure to the curves and angles of his body. Each section is an extension of himself just stronger, better. He has to build the machines to help him build it first, and that means that he has to upgrade J.A.R.V.I.S. to do it, pride blooming in his chest as he watches his finest creation evolving and learning. It makes him feel powerful and useful. It helps him to push the feeling of weakness that Rumlow’s attack has left him with to the back of his mind. It feels good. And if he’s drinking a little more than he usually does, he tries not to think about that either.
“Pep, if Ben calls back today, tell him I'm not available. For the next decade. At least.” Tony instructs Pepper and Steve sees her roll her eyes.  Clearly this is nothing new. “And see if Sodi’s has a table for tonight.”
This chapter has graphic descriptions of attempted rape/non-con, physical assault and vomit so for the love of Odin, PLEASE don't read it if any of that is triggering for you.
“Tony has asked me to find him someone to help get him in better shape,” Pepper says one afternoon, after she’s updated him on Tony’s healing.  “And someone to teach him some basic self defence moves. Wouldn’t happen to know where I could find someone like that, would you?”
“Steve tried to put him through a wall,” Rhodey replies with a genuine smile. That would have been the shattering sound that Tony remembers hearing then.  “It was awesome Tones, you should have seen it. You were taking a while in the bathroom so we went to see if you were OK. Steve walked into the bathroom first and when he heard you scream, he didn’t even blink, he just fuckin’
“Considering that we’re all of the above, yes they are,” Steve quirks his lips. “But that’s not what you meant, is it?”
“Oh boy,” Rogers huffs out when his laughter subsides, and shakes his head pointing a finger at Tony.  “You’re trouble kid, I like it.”
“Sure, whatever Cap,” Tony is challenging, he knows he is, but he can’t seem to help himself.  One of things about Tony is that he won’t submit, not properly, to anyone. Especially to Dominants who think they’re owed something by a submissive, whether they know them or not. And Steve is an Alpha,
Steve had taken longer that he would like to admit getting ready this morning. He wanted to appear relaxed, non-threatening, but also faintly authoritative and only the tiniest bit dominating.  Nat had scoffed at him when he said that. “Have you
Pepper is waiting by one of the last doors along the corridor and Steve walks past her and into the office to find himself in large, airy open space.  There’s another wall of glass, this time behind a huge desk with no less than four computer screens. Beyond it isn’t a boardroom, but New York herself sprawling out beneath them and it takes Steve’s breath away.
“Mm-hmm,” Steve rumbles and turns his body towards Tony so that he’s leaning on one elbow and pressed even closer. God, he’s beautiful, Steve thinks as he takes in the flush rushing up Tony’s whole body.  He brings his other hand up to push a wave of Tony’s hair back from his face, fingers skimming across his ear and settling at the base of his skull, huge and warm. He lowers his head even further until they’re almost nose to nose.  “I always take care of what’s mine.”
Rhodey and Steve kept a bedside vigil, sleeping upright in the hard plastic chairs supplied with the room.  Rhodey had gone back to the mansion a couple of times to shower and change, but, like Pepper, he’d been right back as quickly as he could.
“They’re my teammates. It’s part of my job to make sure that they’re happy,” Steve bumps back, maybe with a little more force just to see Tony drop to his left a bit and scowl at him.
“They did,” Rhodey answers and reaches for his friend’s hand to lace their fingers together.  “He’s locked up waiting for his case to go to court. Attempted rape and assaulting an unbonded submissive is a serious charge Tones. Brock Rumlow is gonna be put away for at least ten years, maybe more. Turns out this isn’t the first time he’s tried this..”
“Have you considered Sarah from weapons tech? She’s cute,” Clint suggests while they’re eating dinner at the Avengers compound. Steve rolls his eyes because apparently, they’re still doing this.
“Oh I’m sorry, did I step on your moment?” Natasha’s grin is far from innocent as she passes Steve a fresh beer.  Tony sees Steve roll his eyes at her and then exchange what looks to be an entire conversation in a just series of wordless looks.
Tony’s breath catches in his throat and everything narrows down to just him, the man leaning casually against the bar. He’s
So Tony does pretty much whatever he wants, whenever he wants and with whomever he wants.  It's a luxury that being so disgustingly wealthy affords. When you’re in the 1% of the world’s richest, most successful and most feared people, you can do pretty much do whatever the fuck you want and no-one says shit. Of course, he has to show his face at a lot of fancy functions and dinners, as well as hold press conferences and TV interviews - that’s just part of being the face of Stark Industries now that Howard has taken a back seat and semi-retired. But he’ll put up with that if it means he can spend nearly all his free time either in his basement workshop building and creating, or out on the town fucking the latest hot young thing (or things, plural) without a single fuck given about his reputation or how it looks to the wider public.  His striking looks means that there is never a shortage of hot young things to play with, and Tony has no shame in using his looks to get what he wants. Doms salivate over him whenever he turns his chocolate brown eyes on them, or looks up through his lashes. His unkempt rich, deep chestnut hair frames his face, and his pink, full lips polish off his look of just-rolled-out-of-bed-and-sucked-a-dick-please-fuck-me look. Doms fall over themselves , switches can’t get enough, and other subs fawn over him. Tony fucking
I'm so sorry Tony. I promise that the next chapter it's comin' up Stark. Seriously, i'm planning on like, 10k of porn next chapter.
Steve uses the time to think about how he intends the meeting to go. He knows that his reason for being here is flimsy at best, but he’s been thinking about Tony since they’d met at the function two weeks ago.  There’s something about him that Steve feels naturally drawn to. There’s so much he wants to know about the sub, so much to discover. He’s not naive enough to think that Tony will want to get to know him in return, but Steve thinks he’s fascinating and he wants to know more. S.H.I.E.L.D. already has a contract with Stark Industries to supply weaponry and tech, but Steve thinks that a contract exclusively with the Avengers would be extremely beneficial.  S.H.I.E.L.D has a lot of red tape, but the Avengers are pretty much an independant team. Yes, they work closely with S.H.I.E.L.D., but that’s only because they’re the only agency out there currently equipped to deal with what the Avengers do. Steve really can’t see the army rocking up to a fire fight with beings from another dimension and being able to handle it with the same level as S.H.I.E.I.L.D. Those guys know what they’re doing and they don’t hesitate. Perhaps Steve can approach this from the point of view that Stark Industries would make some serious money from a deal with the Avengers, and in turn the team get the latest in defensive tech.
“Did something happen?” Steve can’t help the concern in his voice then because he knows what Howard’s temper is like, and he now knows what he’s capable of doing to Tony when he’s been drinking.
Tony’s chest does that thing again and this time he really does smile, stitches and swelling be damned.
doesn’t seem about to force Tony to his knees and bare his neck as punishment.  In fact, he sees to be amused by it.
“Beat it Fonzie,” Tony fires a warning shot as his eyes go back to his reflection and he tries to make his hair look less like someone grabbed hold of it.
“So you’re the famous Tony Stark,” Steve says,  eventually letting Tony’s hand go, and he’s a little sad at the loss of contact.
Tony has dragged him to one of New York’s most exclusive clubs and is now watching his best friend being sandwiched between no less than three pretty young things that are grinding all over him. Tony is well on his way to being blind drunk and he doesn’t seem to have a care in the world right now as he joins the writhing bodies on the dance floor. The only reason that Rhodey had said yes to this was to get Tony out of his basement workshop and back to reality. He knows how Tony gets if he hides for too long, knows how hard it is for him to adjust back to work and life. He also knows that what he really needs is a firm hand to take him down and apart with cuffs and a whip, then piece him back together with praise and soft touches. He knows that he’ll offer that later when they get home, because he always does when Tony gets like this. And Tony will say no, like he always does, because he refuses to put Rhodey in that position. Then he’ll go to one of his preferred places tomorrow and have a stranger do it instead because that means he doesn’t have to burden his friends with having to take care of him. Again.
...d..don’t…” Tony is sobbing and he doesn’t care. He can’t see out of one eye and he can feel it swelling rapidly, the cheekbone underneath shifting around where it’s pressed against the cold tile like it definitely shouldn’t. He’s pretty sure that his skull is cracked too and he knows exactly what’s about to happen if he doesn’t try to stop it. But his head is getting foggier by the second and he can feel himself getting pulled closer and closer to blacking out completely. Maybe that would be better he thinks, to be out cold while it happens. But he’s got to at least try. He takes a second to try and clear the cotton wool in his head then makes a sharp jab backwards with his elbow into the man’s ribs, taking him by surprise so that he stumbles back a bit. It gives Tony enough room to make a lunge towards the stall door and he gets his hand on the lock but the man grabs his wrist and twists his arm up and back towards his shoulders making Tony scream in pain. He’s shoved back against the wall face first, cheekbone grinding on the porcelain.
He only sees flashes when he manages to break the surface, snapshots in time. Sometimes it’s dark and he sees only shadows. Sometimes it’s too bright and he falls back again, shying away from the light. He remembers soft touches to his hands and face, gentle murmurs. There are times when the hands are firmer and they roll him, shifting him around. He feels sharp stinging pain and the wetness on his cheeks as he cries. He hears the sounds of machines beeping, muffled and syrupy. He remembers the smell of clinical things, alcohol and metal. Then that smell of sandalwood and cinnamon again and he tries to chase after it, tries to reach for it and the warmth and safety he associates with it. The smell of summer rain and lilies is there more often than not, as is the aroma of metal and autumn fires. He knows those smells he thinks and knows they’re safe. There are new smells too mingled with the familiar: vanilla and spice as well as citrus and gunpowder and then coconut and engine oil. He finds them all comforting:
This one is unbeta'd as my lovely beta is at Thought Bubble this weekend and i wanted to just get this posted before i change my mind AGAIN and waste more valuable NaNo time second guessing myself and rewriting the 1000th draft of this chapter.
“Tony c’mon, lets go,” Rhodey knows he’s going to lose this fight, but at least he can say he tried. He gives up and lets himself be dragged through the excited crowd to where the Avengers are, bracing  himself for whatever Drunk Tony is about to do or say. At least he’s sober so he’ll be able to step in when he needs to.
Dwelling on all this would mean going back to a place that he doesn’t want to be in. Steve remembers his breakdown and the public fallout it caused. But he’d wanted the world to know, to see how much he was hurting. He wanted to show the world how raw his pain was, and how broken he felt. Steve has never been one for convention, or following what the formalities that being a Dominant meant, so he had bared his soul to the world. Before the serum, no-one had ever taken him seriously as a Dominant, how could they? He’d been 90 pounds soaking wet with a seemingly never ending list of health issues, a joke, a cruel twist of evolution. But people listened to Captain America, and Steve used this to show the world that even Dominants can show pain and have flaws. And if his actions helped just one person then that was what all that mattered. He’d always found the strict protocols of life stifling, and being the leader of the Avengers gave him the perfect opportunity to try and make changes. As he watched the world get more relaxed about traditions, Steve wants to be at the forefront of helping changes along, and there is still such a long way to go.
. Tony suspects that it’s the Alpha part of him, a trait that doesn’t have to posture or preen to make his presence known.  Tony notes that not only is Rogers not in his dress uniform, he also isn’t wearing a tie. His cornflower blue three-piece has very obviously been made to measure, because it accentuates every angle of pure, raw muscle, every curve, to perfection. The pale lilac shirt is open at the neck and Tony can see the top of a tattoo just peeking out at the edges of the collar, and that just makes Tony’s eyes widen a fraction. He has a thing for very pretty people with very pretty tattoos and the fact that the peak of fucking human perfection has what looks like a huge chest tattoo is just…. Yeah.
"Apologies gentlemen, Avengers business,” Steve says, trying to look sheepish as Sam replies almost straight away with a yes. ”Never off duty.”
Steve watches Tony for a few moments longer, watches as he sees as very faint flush start to creep over his skin under the weight of Steve’s appraising eyes.  He really is just about the prettiest thing that Steve has seen in a very long time.
“He...Tony….he tore you and they had to stitch it. It took them awhile to get the bleeding under control enough to fix it. It… it was messy Tones, real bad,” Rhodey doesn’t look at his friend, but he squeezes their hands together tighter.  “But it’s gonna be OK. Doc says there’ll be no permanent damage and you’re already halfway there. It’s gonna itch like a bitch though.”
"Captain Rogers, leader of the Avengers but please, just call me Steve.” Steve returns warmly, a tiny twitch at the side of his mouth giving away how amused he is.
“Oh man….”Sam laughs as he looks at Tony, who looks confused and a little hurt to be laughed at.  “Don’t worry, he never says anything bad about you Tony, I swear.”
when he gets home later), but he’s so high on the feeling of flying, and the suit actually working that he doesn’t care. He knows he needs to go and get himself ready for dinner with Steve, but there’s just one more thing he wants to do. The shining silver of the suit isn’t really...him.
To everyone who has left comments, kudos, and love on this fic - I cherish each and every one of you deeply <3 I hope that I can one day finally finish this fic as a way to show how much I love and appreciate you all.
Just know that this will get a rewrite at some point later this year, so this chapter will have ALL of the porn. I basically just want this story finished so that I can move on with something else.
“Thank you for the coffee Katherine, it was delicious,” Steve says with a warm smile, because manners cost nothing and the Alpha in him likes it if people flush a little when he praises them and hey, he never said he wasn’t a little bit of an asshole.
Tony looks up from what he’s doing with a puzzled look on his face. Clint and Natasha? Huh. He waves his hands over the floating images of the Iron Man armour and it disappears before he throws a tarp over the already fabricated parts on another of the workbenches. He’s not sure he wants S.H.I.E.L.D. finding out about what he’s doing. At least, not yet.
“That’s great Tony,” Steve says eventually, his voice rich and low and Tony shivers because oh, that’s
“Then how about you tell me how your project is going?” He may not understand everything that Tony tells him when he gets into the details of what he’s doing but he likes to hear him talk about things he loves and that excite him. It makes him feel warm and pleased whenever a sub is happy, and that feeling seems to have dramatically magnify when it comes to Tony.
“That’s not a no,” He nods, eyes assessing Tony from over the top of his glass as he brings the scotch to his lips.  This kid is just delightful, and he’s reminded a little of another brunette with a defiant jaw and an attitude to match.
Steve remembers Clint wrapping his jacket around Tony to cover as much of him as possible, and then moving to slide his arms gently around the bleeding sub, pulling him in close to lift him up  and get him the fuck out of there. Happy had been waiting in the car outside and he’d driven to the hospital as fast as he could, while Steve and Rhodey both tried to soothe Tony with quiet voices and gentle touches.  Both of the Dominants had realised that they had to keep Tony awake, keep him calm before he could spiral into a head space that no sub wants to go to. It’s an extremely dangerous place to be, and there are recorded cases of subs who have never come back from that experience. Once at the hospital, Steve hadn’t let go of Tony until the ER doctors prised their patient away from his arms with gentle reassurances.  After that, Steve never left Tony’s side the entire time he was in the hospital, watching over him while he was being kept in a medically-induced coma to stop his brain from swelling further after the impact with the basin.
“Water,” Tony manages to croak out before a coughing fit takes over. Rhodey quickly climbs off the bed and hurries round to Tony’s side of the bed to get the bottle of water there and helps Tony sit up enough to be able to drink. He takes it with both hands, shaking a little but downs half the bottle in one go.  Rhodey perches on the edge of the bed by Tony’s hip and watches his friend slump back against the pillows.
, all Steve did was look at him, what the hell?! That’s the Alpha in him, clearly.  It’s like he made the entire room fold in around them by just his presence and one look.
He tells Pepper that he isn’t hiding, he says he’s geniusing thank you very much, but Pepper knows him better than that.  She’d noted Steve’s face when he’d walked out of Tony’s office, saw the blown eyes and the air of
“Captain Rogers,” The blonde switch behind the glass desk says warmly as she stands. She has no name tag like the people in the main lobby downstairs, which means that most people  who make it up to this floor have probably already met her previously. She extends her hand to Steve and he takes it. “I’m Katherine, i’m the administrator on this floor. Mr Stark is currently running a little late so please, make yourself comfortable while you wait.  Can I get you anything to drink? We have excellent coffee up here.”
“Tell you what, throw in a whole lot of hot rod red to the gold one, lemme see that. A lot less...ostentatious, don’t you think?”
“So Captain Tight Pants, what’s a nice girl like you doing in a place like this?” Tony is a shameless flirt when he’s sober, but when drunk? Yeah, absolutely no filter at all.  He’s vaguely aware of Natasaha laughing, but he’s more focused on Steve’s eyes widening a fraction, his pupils slowly expanding. He remembers what Steve said to him just before he left his office last week and he’s never one to back down from a challenge. Plus, he’s horny as fuck and Steve just so happens to be the owner of the most perfect body in existence, and he’s standing there looking less of a snack and more like a whole goddamn meal.
Rhodey looks back at Tony who hasn’t yet seen what’s going on at the bar, thank fuck. Maybe he can get Tony out of here before he sets eyes on the Captain because fuck, Rhodey really doesn’t want to have to deal with this shit right now.  He starts to make his way to the dance floor so that he can drag Tony out of the crowd and away, but all the writhing bodies are making it difficult. He gets there eventually, wedging himself in between Tony and a very young looking sub.
“No Ben, unacceptable,” Steve can see an earpiece in Tony’s ear as he gesticulates wildly with his hands. He comes to a stop at Pepper’s desk and starts fiddling with the intricate desk ornament there.  Pepper instinctively reaches out a hand to take it from him without looking away from her screen, and puts it on the other side of her out of Tony’s reach. Steve tries to cover a smirk with his hand. “You tell them that they can stick their 12% up their ass. And
There is graphic descriptions of alcohol abuse in this chapter so PLEASE be mindful of that when reading this.
he wants it all, but his brain is keeping him in check, reminding him that he’s not a possession, a trinket to be owned, that’s not who he is. Submitting to Steve, to anyone, would mean that he’s no longer free to work, to run Stark Industries. That would all pass to Steve if they bonded, and Steve doesn’t strike Tony as the kind of Dominant that would let him carry on doing what he does. He’s Captain America, Mr Apple Pie Life. He’d expect Tony to take a back seat, stay at home, do the dishes. Well fuck that, never happening. Maybe he can get Steve to fuck him tonight just so that he can say he’s fucked the Star Spangled Man once. A sparkly new notch on his bedpost, something to tell the grandkids about.  Yeah, Tony can do that, and that’s exactly how he’d like tonight to end. He pushes off the mirror and takes a look at himself. He looks wrecked, which is actually OK if he’s honest. Hopefully it’ll make Steve want to fuck him up even more.
“Well, this has been a delight,” Tony lies as he looks around at the other Dominants, all still speechless. He gives Steve a lingering look from under his lashes  and, in return, receives an eyebrow raise and a hint of a smile.  “Captain, you know where my office is so don’t be a stranger. Office hours are 8 to 6. Good evening gentlemen.”
“This one J,” Tony waves his hands through the other two plans so that they disappear and enlarges the remaining image.  He taps the fingers of one hand against his lips for a few moments as he watches the projections slowly rotate, taking in everything.  “And you’re sure this will work?”
He freezes when he feels movement to his right and turns his head slowly before he lets out a breath when he sees Rhodey.
, it’s like the Alpha is looking right through him and into his goddamn soul.  Tony has never met an Alpha Dom before and
“The more pissy you get, the more Tasha is gonna kick your ass,” Clint says as he drops down from the window to join them on the mat.  “It clouds your judgement. Y’gotta let it go man.”
been quite the talk when he defrosted), not a real person, but Steve has always been told that manners cost nothing so always addresses the ceiling whenever he speaks to the A.I.  “Are you well?”
J.A.R.V.IS. throws up the display of three possible ideas, all floating in blue shapes in front of Tony who immediately hones in on one of them after glancing them over.
“Captain Rogers, hi!” Her hand is warm and firm, and she’s dressed impeccably. Steve isn’t entirely sure how she’s managing to walk in those heels, let alone stand (he thinks that she’d get on famously with Nat), and he takes her hand with a warm smile of his own.  “I’m Pepper Potts, Tony’s executive assistant, personal wrangler and exasperated right hand.”
?” He almost begs. Not that he doesn’t appreciate his teammates and friends trying to help, but right now Steve only has one sub on his mind.
“Nice to meet you Cap,” Tony grins, still not breaking eye contact.  Not that he thinks he’d be able to look away if he wanted to, because his eyes seem to have locked on to Steve’s and don’t seem to want to let go.
Pepper calls him regularly to keep him updated on Tony’s recovery, even though he hasn’t asked her to, and he appreciates it more than she knows.
“Nice to meet you Cap,” Tony  grins, still not breaking eye contact and oh yeah, this kid is a whole lotta fun, Steve can already tell.
“I like it. Fabricate it. Paint it,” He looks at his watch and shit, he needs to get his ass moving if he wants to go and make himself look good enough to eat before Steve comes to pick him up.
“Let ‘em in J,” He pushes the welding mask up as the door to the workshop slides open and the pair walk in.  “Not that I don’t love seeing both your pretty faces, but to what do I owe the pleasure.”
“Gotta piss,” is all Tony manages to force out before he’s heading for the bathroom at an almost jog. He’s relieved to find it empty for the moment and goes to one of the basins so that he can splash cold water on his face and get a fucking grip on his libido before he has to go back out to his friends.  He leans his forehead against the cool surface of the mirror over the basins and tries to remember how to breathe. Tony Stark does
“Whatever you may have heard Captain, it’s all true,” Tony leers, waving the hand that Steve just dropped in the air as a vague dismissal of whatever he thinks that Steve might be thinking.
Howard hasn’t allowed Tony to go and see Rogers, despite the fact that he was being rehabilitated in an SI facility.  He didn’t deserve to be around a Dominant like Captain America, wasn’t worthy of being in the presence of an Alpha. The perfect Alpha.  He would spit insults at Toy about how he would never be good enough for someone like Rogers, never be enough, for any Dominant really, but especially not Rogers. Someone like Captain America deserved someone pure, obedient, quiet, not a sub who ran his mouth constantly, and had ideas above his station.  Not that Tony fucking cared. Captain America was dead, a legend passed down through history.
Steve does one of those weird snort giggles that makes him very glad that he’s alone, and he can’t help the grin that spreads across his face when he sees that it’s Tony.  Then a wave of guilt hits him because this is the first contact he’s had with Tony since the hospital, and it’s the sub that reached out for contact, not himself. Shame is not something that he feels much these days, but he’s feeling it now, his cheeks burning a little as he feels himself blushing. He hasn’t done that in years.
Or rather, Hawkeye doing his best to hold The Black Widow back from trying to shiv someone with a broken glass.  Rhodey watches as Falcon gets himself in between his teammates and the guy that has really just fucked with the wrong people and yup, there’s Captain America.
So far i have 8k of pure porn, and it may end up being twice that because i want to make sure that i give it the level of detail and feels that these 2 deserve. I haven't written porn in like, 5 years so i'm getting HELLA frustrated at not being able to get it right. I know that it doesn't need to be perfect but godammit, i want to get it as close to perfect as i can.
“Uh-huh,” Rhodey’s brow creases in worry, but he knows that Tony will tell him when he’s good and ready.  “You still need a shower though.”
The three Generals, or whatever the fuck they are, all make a sharp intake of breath at the sheer nerve of the submissive in front of them, even if he is the head of the company who is currently supplying them with top of the line, cutting-edge weaponry. Tony’s own molten brown eyes are met by the piercing blue of Captain America’s, and he sucks in a breath of his own because
“I am,” He says eventually and gives Tony a warm smile, blue eyes lingering on the sub’s plump lips for a moment before flitting back to his eyes.  “Although sometimes I wonder if there’s something missing.”
When Steve reaches the penthouse floor, the doors slide open to reveal a plush reception area with a deep, scarlet carpet, a couch in a rich, dark brown leather with matching chairs all with throw pillows that match the carpet, and lots of glass and chrome. It reflects the outside of the building, but the carpet and the splashes of colour from the seating area all make it feel less harsh, less clinical. A brief moment of comfort before the storm of a board meeting.  There is another reception area, but this time it’s an elegant chrome and glass desk topped with two computer screens and a keyboard with one person sat behind it. There is a wall of glass to the right of the seating area and Steve can see the boardroom behind it, the high backed leather chairs empty now and the three enormous flat screen televisions black. Behind the receptionist there is a well lit corridor with the same scarlet carpeting and several doors along its length.  It’s all quite sedate compared to the lobby downstairs, and Steve suspects that only a select few get to see this floor. He knows that a floor or so down from where he is is a whole section of meeting rooms and boardrooms, which is as far up in the building that he’s been until today. R&D are on the bottom 5 floors, as well as 3 floors of basement. S.H.I.E.L.D. has its own floor above R&D so that they can work directly with S.I. on specialist weaponry, and the rest of the tower is for all the other departments of Stark Industries.
Steve just hums and keeps looking into Tony’s eyes, delighted as he watches the brown being swallowed by black. Leaning as they both are, they’re touching almost all the way down one side and Steve inches the pinky on his hand next to Tony towards the other, brushing the side of his hand. He watches as Tony’s lips part a little then as his bottom lip get caught in his teeth.
Tony rips the ear piece out and throws in on Pepper’s desk, clearly angry at whoever he’d been speaking to. He doesn’t seem to have even noticed Steve yet, so he takes the opportunity to look before he’s seen.  Tony is wearing black pinstripe slacks with a matching waistcoat, and a white shirt open at the collar, just like he had at the dinner. This time though, there’s a scarlet and gold striped tie at his neck that Steve assumes was tightened properly and straight when he started his day, but has clearly been tugged at and loosened as the day has gone on.  Tony’s hair is wilder than when Steve had first met him, and he’s clearly been running his hands through it, probably out of frustration. His eyes are flashing with an angry energy and Steve wants to reach out a hand and put Tony on his knees to calm down and
“Hmm…,” Tony hums. This is actually pretty damn near perfect. The only snag is that he really will have to go to R&D to get a few of the necessary elements, which means having to get Howard to sign off on it. Not ideal, but he thinks it’s possible.  Maybe his father will just be happy that he’s applying himself to something. Doubtful, as Howard’s view of renewable and self sustaining energy is piss poor at best.
He’s still not entirely sure why they gave him the Alpha Dom designation, he just thinks of himself as Steve. But the powers that be seemed to think the serum made him “more” in all ways, including his Dominant side. Not that he’s really had much of a chance to figure out how the whole Alpha thing makes him any different from just being a normal Dominant. Sure, he’s had lovers since he came out of the ice - it’s been a decade, he has needs. It’s just that he’s not felt completely connected to anyone on that level yet, not since ...since Bucky. The pain is still there, and Steve knows that it always will be. Bucky was his, and he always will be. It will always feel like there’s a part of him missing, he knows this. Any bonded pair feels like he does when one of them...when one of them passes. It's a void that won’t ever fade, always there.  It is possible to bond again, Steve knows that, but it’s extremely rare. There are only a handful of recorded rebonds, and because that's over centuries, Steve knows just how rare they are. And he thinks he’s ok with that, truly. He’s made peace with the fact that he won’t find another bond. But somehow, since he came out of the ice and found himself thrown 70 year in the future, he’s had a few brief and fleeting hopes that being in the future might mean he stands a better chance of finding someone.
“We’ll stop when you tell us why you’re suddenly not seeing anyone,” Nat puts down her fork to cross her arms and fix Steve with a look at would make lesser men squirm in their seats.  “Although, we pretty much already know.”
“Nothing Tony,” Steve grins and god, Tony is feeling some kinda way about Captain America’s predatory look.  Tony can’t help sneaking glances at the bits of the tattoo he can see, too drunk to care if Steve notices. It looks like a collection of roses, all intertwined with thorns and Tony wonders what it’s going to take to convince Steve to let him see the whole thing.  Steve catches him looking and raises an eyebrow at the drunk genius, and he can see Tony thinking about what he’d purred in his ear a week ago.
Tony, c’mon,” Rhodey takes Tony by the wrist and starts to drag him away from the dancefloor and out to the club lobby.  He knows that Happy will be waiting outside with the car, and the mansion is only about 30 minutes away. Tony is trying to pull away, not getting far, and then he hears:
“Great, I’ll speak with her on the way out,” Steve sits forward to put his glass down then stands and heads to the door.  He stops next to Tony and puts a hand very lightly on his shoulder and it feels like a searing brand to Tony. Then Steve leans down, using a little of his weight on Tony’s shoulder to make his point as he gets level with the side of Tony’s head, and being sure to enunciate every word he purrs in Tony’s ear “It’s been a pleasure,
Steve has been looking forward to tonight for days, but now that Friday has finally arrived, he’s nervous as hell. Talking to someone on the telephone is totally different to speaking in person, and he wants tonight to go well and to not say or do the wrong thing. Tony has been through so much recently and he wants to make sure that the sub is relaxed and comfortable with him, so much so that he’ll be receptive to what Steve would like to suggest to him. He’s been battling with his feelings and thoughts since Tony had told him they were going out for dinner, but he’s made the decision that he’d like to court Tony. Maybe he should say date instead of court?  He hasn’t stopped thinking about Tony since they first met all those months ago at the military dinner, and his feelings have only increased since the incident with Rumlow. He thought that perhaps the feelings would fade, but even without seeing Tony, they’ve gotten stronger the more he’s spoken to the sub.
Steve was eventually convinced by Sam to go home and get some decent sleep and food as well as clean himself up. He’d lasted three hours before he was back at the hospital. He couldn’t understand why he was so drawn to the young sub lying motionless in a hospital bed, but he knew wanted to be there, and close. It made no sense as they barely knew each other, having only seen each other three brief times, but he felt the pull like a deep-rooted longing right to his very core.
“Sure, whatever Cap,” Tony challenges and Steve’s lips quirk upwards into more of a smile. He likes subs who break with tradition, who challange the norm, and this kid is just oozing with that Fuck You mentality that Steve likes so much.  He glances down at Tony’s neck where his shirt is open and notices that there’s no collar there, or jewellery of any kind. So he’s unbonded, which makes his behaviour even more enticing, because it means that there’s no Dominant watching out for him in a room full of them. The kid has got balls of fucking steel, Steve will give him that.  He also thinks that his collar would look rather lovely nestled there on Tony’s collarbone.
“Boss,” Pepper nods and goes back to her computer.  Steve watches Tony close his eyes and breath in deeply, blowing it out and giving himself a shake.  When he opens his eyes again, he startles when he finally sees Steve standing at the window.
The moment is broken and Steve pulls away leaving Tony a little bereft of all that warmth and promise.
The swim back up to consciousness is long and tough, like he’s moving through jello, never quite making it to the surface. He dreams of dark eyes, bathroom tiles and blood as he screams into an echo like chamber of nothingness. He dreams of bright blue eyes and roses bathed in sunlight. Those are the nights that his sleep is long and dreamless, when he hears voices, murmurs in the dark that sound familiar and comforting, but he can’t place them, not yet. He dreams of calm, cloudless skies the colour of blue that reminds him of something else that he can’t quite remember. He watches as equations take the place of the stars in the night sky, laying out neverending wonders before him, stretching out forever as he runs after them.
“What about that girl in accounting? Rebecca is it?” Nat says while they’re fighting back-to-back with what can only be described as baby octopi in Times Square.
of all people. Tony thinks that maybe he’s pushed it too far as he gets pinned under Rogers’ blue gaze, something flashing across his face that Tony can’t get a read on. Then he throws his head back and laughs, a real, genuine laugh that comes from deep in his chest, and Tony feels a warmth spread through him, because he was the cause of that.
Tony can feel his knees weakening with every word Steve says, the  deep, rich tone that seeming to trickle down his spine like treacle. He can’t stop the shiver that ripples through his entire body at the use of his full name and since when was that even a thing for him? Maybe it’s just when Steve says it
And Tony is bored, which is always a dangerous thing because hello? Genius. And when geniuses get bored (see: when Tony gets bored), bad things happen. Well, bad is all a matter of perspective really. Tony would argue that what people consider bad are all in a day’s entertainment for a bored 20-year old genius. Shenanigans is what Jarvis would say:  “You’ve got your shenanigans face on.” That always spelt trouble whenever Tony got That Look. Last time it had involved Tony shamelessly flirting with a very high up army Dom, and then slipping away with one of the waiters whilst said Dom had gone to relieve himself. He returned to find no Tony and his Bentley plus chauffeur gone. Howard had been so furious that he’d beaten Tony so badly he couldn’t leave the house for a week. Usually Howard kept the bruising to body parts that could be hidden. That time it had been his face.
like my father,” Tony says harshly, his eyes hardening.  Always in Howard’s fucking shadow, never seen for himself or what he can do.  He’s the fucking CEO of one of the biggest companies in the world for fuck’s sake, not just Howard’s wayward submissive child.
“Good afternoon Jarvis,” Steve smiles at the roof of the elevator. Fury had told him that J.A.R.V.I.S. was an A.I. (and hadn’t
As Tony suspected, getting Howard to sign off on the things he needs from R&D is a pain in the ass. He gets interrogated about why he needs all the items he’s asked for, and what he intends to do with them, and Tony only just manages to convince his father to sign the forms. It’s fucking ridiculous that he has to get his father to give him permission when it’s Tony that’s the CEO of the whole fucking company, but R&D is still mainly under Howard’s remit despite him being semi-retired, so everything has to go through him first. Add to the fact that for some reason, certain items on the list require a Dominant’s permission to be used, especially by a submissive, and Tony is in a fucking foul mood when Steve next calls him.
He lets his eyes wander over the crowd by the bar and in the room, and it's the same people as always. They’re all Dominants, all puffed out chests and overly red cheeks. A fog of cigar smoke hangs in the air above their heads, and the smell of expensive liquors and oak panelling fills the rest of the space. The white noise of separate conversations are a background hum and Steve really is trying to look and sound interested in the conversation he’s supposed to be taking part in with the three Generals standing with him, but he just doesn’t give a fuck. He’s bored out of his mind and he wants to go home. He might swing by Sam’s place on the way back, see if he wants to order a pizza and have a few beers. The food they serve at these functions is the type that's all show and no substance, and Steve has a supersoldier’s metabolism.  He made sure he ate a Steve size portion of food before he left for the function, but he’s going to need to eat again before he goes to bed. He gets his phone out to shoot Sam a text and ignores the disapproving looks of the men around him.
“Let’s try this again,” Tony gets himself ready for another attempt with the boot thrusters.  “Day 11, Test 37, configuration 2.0. For lack of a better option, DUM-E is still on fire safety. But if you douse me again, and I'm not on fire, I'm donating you to a city college. And please don’t follow me around with that buddy, because it makes me feel like I'm gonna catch on fire spontaneously. Just stand down,” Tony says to the ‘bot, and DUM-E makes a sad little noise and lowers his arm. Tony’s face softens at that. “Hey, if something happens, then come in.” DUM-E makes a much happier sound at that. “OK, we’re gonna start off with just 1% thrust capacity. And three...two...one…”
“One and the same,” Rhodey sighs wearily. He’s not ashamed of his friendship with Tony, far from it. But Tony is the CEO of the biggest supplier of weaponry to the military, and given his own position in the ranks, he’s never wanted  his friendship with Tony to be taken advantage of.
“More or less,” Steve replies with a nod and takes a sip of his scotch.  It’s excellent, of course. He watches Tony as he mulls it all over.
“Oh boy,” Steve huffs out as his laughter subsides, and shakes his head pointing a finger at Tony.  “You’re trouble kid, I like it.”
And right now, he wants to do exactly that with Steve and it’s fucking terrifying. His knees actually feel weak, wanting to betray him and finally give out so that he can sink to the floor in front of Steve leaving himself pliant and open. His body wants it so much that it feels like an actual physical burning  under his skin. He wants Steve to tell him how good he is, how perfect as he fucks Tony’s throat. He wants to see Steve’s intricate web of knotted rope against his skin as he’s spread open, laid bare. He wants to feel the exquisite, white hot sting of Steve’s whip across his back as he holds still like he’s been told to. He wants Steve’s plug, nestled in his ass all day to keep him open and ready to be taken whenever Steve wants him.
Steve tilts his head to one side as he considers Tony, the twitch of his lips slowly becoming more of a smirk as he takes in the fire in Tony’s eyes, the jut of his defiant chin.  He’s young, very early twenties he thinks, and very, very pretty. He does remind Steve a little of Howard, but he’s definitely inherited Maria’s stunning looks.
So he’s stayed away, and he feels like the worst fucking coward for not going to see Tony. He desperately wants to, but he’s actually scared about his feelings towards the gorgeous young sub. The draw he feels towards him, the longing that seems to have settled over him. Steve hasn’t felt this pull of want since...since Bucky. It fucking terrifies him.
“You’re not paying attention Stark,” Natasha sounds frustrated as she pulls Tony back up off the mat in the mansion gym again.  He resolutely ignores Clint’s snickering from his perch on the window ledge. “And you’re getting frustrated which is making you sloppy.”
“Seriously Tones, you fuckin’ stink,” Rhodey kisses the top of Tony’s head and then hops up to sit on the edge of the bench that Tony is sat at.
Tony just hums in reply, his mind thinking everything over and deciding that he should just stop being a dick about everything and reach out.
“Steve,” Rhodey looks a little puzzled for a moment before he catches on. “Didn’t let go until he handed you over to the ER doctors.”
“People keep asking me that,” Steve tilts his head as he watches Tony’s body language.  He’s open and engaged, but he’s also very clearly ready to run or fight if he perceives Steve to be any kind of threat.
“Tony…” Rhodey warns. He hates is when his best friend gets like this. Hyper, sleep deprived and horny. It always means nothing but trouble.
“We do,” Clint shrugs, hopping up to crouch on the edge of the workbench next to Tony. “But there’s not much doing right now so…”
“I can show you a few things to help you centre yourself, help clear your mind,” Clint smiles putting a hand on Tony’s shoulder.  “I spend a lot of my job having to sit still when I'm out in the field. It’s a skill I had to learn, but it really helps.”
Steve’s cheeks are burning again because how can Tony be so forgiving when he’s just been through so much? God, he feels like the worst person in the world right now.
“Oh, that much is obvious,” Steve shoots back, and he keeps his smile soft. This kid is…well, he’s someone that Steve thinks he could form something with. A friend, or maybe...  “You’re much more fun.”
“We work closely with S.H.I.E.L.D yes, but only because they’re the only agency currently equipped to help if we need them,” Steve says and he raises an eyebrow slightly at Tony’s swearing.  “But I thought it would be more beneficial to work directly with S.I. on Avengers business.”
Leader of the Avengers, symbol of freedom and purity and justice blah, blah, yada, yada.  And also the most Alpha Dom to ever have existed. In fact, Tony is pretty sure that the term Alpha Dom has been coined just for Captain Rogers.  It was like they felt they needed to make him ...more, like Dom just wasn’t enough. But then, Captain Rogers has always been
“And how do you propose I do that birdie?” Tony tries really hard to keep his rising anger out of his tone but fails miserably, but Clint just shrugs it off like he usually does.
“Yeah?” Is all he manages to breathe out when Steve’s mouth gets close enough to his ear that he can feel warm breath against his skin, sending a wave of goosebumps skittering across his flesh.
“Gonna teach you a lesson you little sub bitch,” He hisses in Tony’s ear, a hand against his head pushing the side of his face that he hit on the basin into the tile making him cry out as blazing pain shoots across his skull.  “Pretty thing like you with that mouth and no collar acting like a whore. You want it. You
Steve glances over Todd’s shoulder and suspects that the elevator is the Stark’s own private access as it’s set away from the main elevator banks and behind the reception desk.
being pulled into the abyss as three fingers are shoved back inside him, that blinding pain shooting up his spine again, and he’s grateful for the blackness closing in around his vision. Suddenly he hears a bang and the weight against his back and the fingers in his ass are gone and he slithers to the floor of the stall. His ruined pants pool around him, mixed with his blood and he presses himself back to curl around the toilet bowl and make himself as small as possible. He hears shouting, then a shattering noise - glass Tony thinks groggily, then dull thuds and more shouting and the sound of more smashing noises.  He flinches when he feels hands on him, but they’re not cruel, they don’t want to hurt him. There’s a hand in his hair and one on the side of his face that isn’t ground to a pulp. He feels something being wrapped around him, then he’s being lifted and held against a warm, solid mass that’s rumbling under his cheek. He smells hints of sandalwood, soap and cinnamon and his brain supplies
“I’m still sorry. I should have come to see you and I haven’t, which is wrong of me,” Steve is determined to try and put it right, no matter how much Tony says it’s OK.
Steve remembers jumping out of his skin the first time he’d been to the tower when the disembodied voice spoke to him in the elevator. He’s used to it now, but it still makes him smile. J.A.R.V.I.S. greets everyone when they step into the elevator, and his smooth British voice is soothing to Steve. It’s also one of the (many)  reasons why Steve is keen to get to know Tony a little more as he knows that J.A.R.V.I.S. is his creation and built the A.I. at M.I.T. when he was still a teen.
“Tony, what are you doing here?” Smooth Steve, real smooth. He pointedly ignores Clint’s sniggering.
After a few moments, J.A.R.V.I.S. brings up some different colour combinations, all of which he screws his nose up at, especially the all gold version.
you Steve?” and yeah, she’s right. Kind of hard to look anodyne when you’re a supersoldier. In the end he’d settled for a pair of pale grey slacks with a matching jacket, and a pale blue button down, open far enough that his tattoo shows a little. Smart, but relaxed. And according to Clint, the blue compliments his eyes, but whatever.
He looks in the mirror as he buttons up his shirt, watching as his and Bucky’s dog tags slowly disappear under the material. They never found a body, so Steve had a new tag made so that he could hang it next to his own around his neck.  Bucky would want him to try and find happiness, he knows that, but his loss is still a pain he will never lose. It’s gotten easier over time, though, and Bucky wouldn’t hesitate to kick his ass if he ever caught him moping around. He’d like Tony he thinks, would like his take no bullshit approach to life, and that’s what had made the decision easy in the end for Steve, knowing that Bucky would approve of his choice.
“Tony,” Steve smiles and takes the hand offered. They hold each others gaze for a few moments before Toy drops his hand and moves away towards the door he just came through.
Tony suspects that this is not just Pepper’s doing, and he stamps down the disappointment he can feel in his chest that it’s not Steve currently standing in his workshop. He spends the next couple of hours with Clint and Nat  putting together a plan to help him up his stamina and build some muscle. He’s secretly pleased because the Iron Man suit is going to require more muscle mass than he currently has. They laugh and joke, then order pizza and Tony feels more relaxed than he has in weeks. By the time Clint and Nat leave, they have a plan for the next few months and Tony is actually looking forward to starting to train with the pair of them.
and he goes boneless. He burrows deeper into the warmth and keeps his eyes closed. There are hands on him again, but they’re gentle, kind. He thinks he’s moving but it could be because his head is swimming again, and his innards suddenly try to crawl out of his throat. He lurches to the side, not wanting to throw up on the safe, warm mass underneath him and empties the contents of his stomach onto the floor of the bathroom. He hears it splatter on the tiled floor and tries to say sorry but his voice sounds strange in his head, slurred and mumbled. The arms around him tighten a little, holding him closer as he feels his mouth being wiped with something and then he’s moving again.
as he made arrangements with her for organising the contracts on the Avengers deal.  She also noted the look on Tony’s face when she went into his office to ask him how the meeting had gone.  He was still frozen on the couch, breathing heavy, dick tenting his dress pants and eyes hazy and heavy lidded.
“I don’t doubt it,” Steve says, and he does smile now, soft and genuine.  “You’re not at all what I expected from Howard’s son.”
Steve can see what she’s doing, and smiles into his phone because she’s sneaky as hell. And he knows that he’s not the best person to do what she’s asking, not while he’s still trying to work through how he’s feeling.
..He knows that Steve is a supersolider, but six punching bags in 48 hours? That’s...that’s actually really hot. He also makes a mental note to look into designing a punching bag that will stand up to a supersoldier sulk.
Steve watches as Tony saunters away, a swing in his hips that wasn’t there when he walked over. The little shit is doing that purely for his benefit, and Steve’s smile gets broader as his eyes follow the young sub across the room. He takes in the beautiful curve of Tony’s back as it narrows a little at the waist just before the swell of his ass. And boy, that ass is...it’s fucking perfect is what it is.
“Good question. Probably because we’re both unbonded, both hot, and both known the world over,” Steve states very matter-of-factly and Tony nearly chokes on his own tongue.  "People are nosy like that."
Katherine nods with a smile and then disappears towards the corridor, presumably towards a kitchen area that Steve can’t see as he settles himself in one of the leather chairs.  She returns shortly with Steve’s coffee in a glass cup and saucer and places it on the squat table in front of him before going back to her desk. A comfortable silence settles over them both, Katherine tapping away on her keyboard as she works.  Steve reaches for his coffee and Katherine is right: it really is amazing coffee. But then, this is Stark Industries, why would the coffee be any less than perfect.
Steve will definitely be paying a visit to Stark Industries in the next few days, or a perfectly valid discussion about Avengers equipment of course.  After all, he’s sure that Clint could do with some new, state of the art arrows. Yes, strictly a business visit, nothing more.
Tony’s eyes light up and starts to try and pull Rhodey over to the bar where the Avengers are all standing.  He can see security and Falcon pulling the guy who had started the whole thing towards one of the emergency exits.
“Yeah, been busy with these idiots,” Sam jerks his head towards the other Avengers, which gets a snort of laughter from Steve.
Yes J-Man, there is,” Tony smiles then because yeah, this is gonna be awesome.  “Show me all the files you have stored on the Iron Man project.”
“Jarvis, do you still have all my M.I.T. files locked down in your auxiliary memory banks?” Tony asks and waves his hands in a very specific way in front of him so that blue, floating numbers and shapes appear out of thin air in front of him.
“The brunette with the purple glasses?” Steve grunts as he smashes another group of the tentacled menaces.  “She’s cute, but she’s not really my type.”
Now that he’s back in workshop he thinks he could use the enforced downtime to get some work done, but he can’t seem to focus on anything. His mind keeps dragging him back to how defenceless he felt in that bathroom, how useless. He should have been able to put up more of a fight. He sends an email to Pepper asking her to start finding the best personal trainers and self-defence teachers that New York has to offer.  Then he remembers a project that he’d shelved years ago, something that was a passing fancy when he was at M.I.T. but had dismissed in favor of J.A.R.V.I.S. and his two ‘bots DUM-E and Y.O.U.
“Yeah, no. Tell you what Jay, do a weather and ATC check, start listening in on the ground control.”
“Yeah, ah,” Rhodey replies.  “She’s worried about you. You need to me to go kick Captain America’s ass?”
“Now that I can confirm is wholly true,”Tony says, wiggling his eyebrows at him and Steve’s smirk gets bigger. “You should swing by my office at SI, let me show you just how much fun I can be.”
Clint, Sam and Natasha come to see him too and they play poker, all sat cross-legged on his enormous bed. They bring donuts with them and they tease him -  it’s nice Tony thinks. They make him laugh and they don’t treat him like he’s made of glass.
“Whatever you may have heard Captain, it’s all true,” Tony leers, waving  the hand that Steve just dropped in the air as a vague dismissal of whatever Steve might be thinking.
I debated whether or not to take this story down completely, but the damage has already been done so there isn't really any point. And despite it being not particularly good, I'm still proud of it so I'm going to leave it up. Because fuck Romilly King, that's why.
“Cap, hi,” Tony blinks, then his face slides back into what Steve suspects is his Media Face and walks over to shake his hand.
“Hey honey bear,” Tony croaks and fuck he needs a drink. Rhodey’s eyes blink open, taking a moment to register what he just heard, then he’s wide awake and sitting up, hand hovering over Tony.
“Who would have thought that Captain America is just a big softie?” Tony jokes and shoulder bumps Steve who just rolls his eyes.
Steve had watched as Pepper came bursting into the room and climbed into bed to wrap herself around Tony’s body, sobbing into into the skin of his neck. She hadn’t left until Rhodey had managed to coax her into going home to at least shower and get a change of clothes. She was back within the hour.
“I get it Cap, don’t worry. Genius, remember?” Tony smirks and gets up to walk over to a cabinet that Steve can see is filled with very expensive looking liquor.  Tony raises an eyebrow in question and Steve nods so he pours two glasses of scotch. He walks back over and passes Steve one of the glasses, fingers brushing briefly,  and then walks over to sit on the coach opposite, crossing his legs and lounging back with an arm up on the back.  “What you’re saying is that you want to use my brain and my company to make bespoke equipment for the Avengers without S.H.I.E.L.D. getting to play with any of them. To start with anyway.”
Tony’s chest does a weird fluttery thing and if smiling didn’t hurt so much, he thinks his smile would be wider than his face right now. Steve did that, for him.
Tony is bored and tired and he wants to go home to his workshop and his AI and his ‘Bots, so he starts to think about just getting the fuck outta dodge without saying his goodbyes, when he sees a flash of colour out the corner of his eye that doesn’t fit in with the surroundings. He turns to look as he’s heading for the door and it’s like he hits a brick wall, stopping in his tracks when he sees who it is.
“Whoever taught you sarcasm should be fired,” Tony narrows his eyes and jabs a finger at Steve again.
“Colonel, a pleasure,” Steve smiles and takes the proffered hand to shake.  “And don’t worry, we get it a lot. Just not from the CEO of Stark Industries.”
Tony mentally shook the image from his mind as he forced his thoughts back into the stifling hot room and the drone of the Dom talking to him. This one was ...Master Sergeant? First Sergeant? Fucked if Tony can remember. Fist Master Boring McFuckwit is what Tony keeps calling him in his head and he giggles to himself, hiding his smirk behind his tumbler of really rather excellent single malt whisky. Smoky, with a hint of peat, rich and delicious.  Tony doesn’t drink like his father, not to get drunk. He drinks because it helps with his somewhat crippling social anxiety, which no-one except Jarvis and Rhodey know about. Plus, it all fits in with the outward public image that he’s been so carefully cultivating over the years. Oh, the copious amounts of sex with a neverending string of beautiful people is definitely not a cover. Tony loves sex. And he loves very pretty people, so the sex is just…..for pure pleasure. But everything else that the public sees?  Yeah, that’s all a carefully placed mask. The Tony Stark Media Face, Rhodey named it, and he’s not wrong. But its a wall of armour that Tony uses to keep people out, the people that don’t matter anyway. There are those who know him for his true self, and he can count them on one hand: Rhodey, Pepper and Happy. And J.A.R.V.I.S. of course and yes, his AI absolutely counts as a person. Not even Howard and Maria know him, not really. Obie thinks he does, but that’s just because Tony lets him believe it.
“It sure is,” Steve hasn’t been up this high much since he came out of the ice. Something about height not sitting right with him since… since he lost him.  But this view is nothing short of spectacular.
Steve hears a door open and a stunning red headed switch strides into view. He stands, because that’s what you do whenever a lady enters a room, and she beams at him, walking over and holding out a hand.
When he’s not thinking about Steve, he’s working on the Iron Man suit, but he’s come to a frustrating impasse. Nearly all the parts of the armour have now been fabricated and are slowly being put together by himself, J.A.R.V.I.S. and his ‘bots, but there’s one major thing that he can’t make work.
“OK,” Rhodey sucks in the breath. “Cracked skull, but nothing serious. Broken eye socket and cheek, dislocated shoulder and torn rotator cuff. And….”
“Captain Rogers,” Todd says, his smile wider now that Steve has reached the desk, and he points at small electronic box on the counter in front of him.  “If you would please sign in using the scanner here. Mr Stark is expecting you.”
It’s another week before Tony can get out of bed and get down to his workshop. His legal team come to see him in bed along with Pepper and the police.  Pepper’s eyes are red-rimmed and bloodshot and she never lets go of his hand when he has to recount every last detail that he can recall to the police. He sobs silently into her shoulder when the others have left and she strokes his hair and holds him close.
Tony is catapulted upwards, slams into the ceiling of the workshop and ends up in a crumpled heap on the floor, where DUM-E rather belatedly sprays him liberally with the fire extinguisher.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Steve asks eventually ,when he realises that he’s been lost in thought a little too long.
not a fan of the very real possibility of having to strap actually batteries to my back,” Tony throws a piece of scrap metal across the workshop in deep frustration and watches when DUM-E rolls off after it.
Steve notices all three Generals suck in a breath at the blatant audacity of the kid in front of him, and his lips twitch in amusement. The only other person this century to treat Steve in such a way was Natasha. Not really surprising considering that she’s the Black Widow and even Captain America finds her terrifying.  Steve meets Tony’s eyes with his own and fuck they’re even prettier now that he can see them close up. A deep, molten brown with tiny flecks of gold. He notices them dart briefly down to the opening of his shirt where Steve knows that the top of his tattoo is visible, but the kid’s eyes don’t linger, and he goes right back to looking Steve in the eye. Steve reaches out his hand to take Tony’s  in a handshake, and finds the hand offered is surprisingly calloused, a little rough. So he works with his hands, clearly. Steve likes that.
“To what do I owe the pleasure of your visit?” Steve assumes that Tony means for him to follow, so he does and finds himself in Tony’s office and it’s not what he expected at all. There’s none of the glass and chrome in here, it’s more like the library of a large stately home. There’s wood paneling along two of the walls with built in shelves lined with books about engineering, mechanics, programming and physics as well as a whole host of other books that Steve can’t even wrap his mind around. Tony’s desk is huge and made of oak Steve thinks. It looks old. There’s an aged leather couch on one side and two matching chairs the other. Steve is reminded of the layout of the Oval Office, just on a more excessive scale. At the opposite end of the room however, there’s two metal and wood work benches scattered with bits of circuitry, metal parts and tools. That would explain the callouses on Tony’s hands then.
Everyone knows this. The entire world knows. Tony Stark is the world’s richest, most well connected, unbonded submissive, and the brattiest brat to ever brat. The term ‘topping from the bottom’ could have been written to wax lyrical about him. It could be why, surprisingly, his queue of suitors is actually pretty small.  No Dom wants a pushy bottom, no matter how rich they are, how well connected. It would look bad at public functions to have a sub who wouldn’t do as they were told and ran their mouth and got drunk. It wasn’t proper. Submissives are to be seen but not heard unless expressly told to by their Master. And Tony…..well Tony has never been about what is right and proper.
As such, I don't really feel that inclined to finish this. I want to, but being plagiarised by someone who is making money off of my work, work that I do for free because I love the characters and love fanfiction, has really taken the wind out of my creative sails.
I do, however, feel the need to explain that this chapter got a way from me. I've rewritten it about a bajillion times, and each time it just wasn't working. I really tried to make the porn good lads, i really did, but it just....it just wouldn't come (Ha! Come...). So i made the executive decision to rip out a whole chunk and just post what you see here. I'm sorry for anyone who came here expecting explicit anal and blowjobs. I tried, i really, REALLY did, i promise. Maybe i should stop being such a perfectionist.
. Tony has grown up with the legend as an ever present force thanks to Howard. He never stopped banging on about how perfect Rogers was, and how it was going to be Stark Industries that found him, which they had in the end. After years of Howard ploughing funds into exploring the Arctic for the Valkyrie wreckage, it had been found.  Tony remembers the day that they pulled Rogers from the ocean and discovered that he was still alive. The world had held its breath to see if Captain America would survive the reanimation process, and Tony had held his own breath right along with them.
“Hey, Rhodes!” Sam is back from helping out Security and the two men embrace each other for a moment.  “Good to see you buddy!”
