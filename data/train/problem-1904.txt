John felt the slow slide of Sherlock’s penis and it caused his own to stir in response. John jumped to his feet.
“Clearly I was wrong.” Sherlock ripped the ears from his head, throwing them to the ground, and stalked off into his bedroom.
"What is this one for?" They asked but Jawn wasn't looking. He'd moved on to another room. "Jawn!" They called trying to draw him back so he could answer their questions.
John looked up at Sherlock, searching for answers. Why had Mary cheated on him? Why had she never said? Why had she pretended Rosie was John’s? Why had she left a note for Rosie’s real dad delivered on her death?
John put on a second pair of gloves and took Sherlock’s cock into his hands. He removed the ring and looked up at Sherlock.
His thoughts had taken an alarming turn and he furrowed his brow as he chastised himself. He was supposed to be mad at him, not lusting after him like a helpless little sub in a daytime soap opera. His life was not some silly romance novel where he rode happily off into the sunset on a white steed with his Byronic prince charming! He needed to get himself under control, was thirty-five, for Christ sakes! Far too old to be mooning over a stranger.
John didn’t allow him to finish that sentence. Whatever he said might deter or distract John, and John wasn’t going to wait a second longer. “I love you.”
John sobbed with relief when it was off Sherlock took it in its entirety into his mouth, warming John’s cock rapidly, causing him to cry out again. Sherlock worked John ruthlessly, tonguing at his cockhead and sucking hard.
Not wanting to lose it John stuck it back in his wallet, making a mental note to give it back to Sherlock.
Sherlock looked over and saw John wiping his face. The sweat from his face. But, it looked like… “Are you crying?”
No, that was insane. It was the positioning. He didn’t want to be sandwiched with a cock in his mouth. There wouldn’t be enough friction.
Sherlock crawled up the bed and hooked his feet over the side. “Please, sir, hit me with the paddle. Show me my place.” They were words Sherlock wouldn’t normally use, but he was high on endorphins and desperate for more pleasure-pain.
His lips were pink, moist cupid’s bow a sharp contrast against his pale milky skin, even with the flush across his cheeks. The root of John’s cock shined with saliva.
“Not really,” Sherlock said. “If they wanted you just discredited they’ve pinned it on you. That they didn’t means, most likely, that they’re planning on killing you.”
Sherlock waited for John to move but he didn’t. He was breathing, heavily but hitched. Was something wrong?
Sherlock writhed on the bed. John teased mercilessly. He knew it itched, it tickled and itched and was driving him nuts. Sherlock called out yellow and John risked continuing. He used more pressure, scratching the feathers along Sherlock’s feet.
John knew the idea was stupid. It had been years ago. The man probably never lived in London to begin with, and even if he did, he was probably married with kids by now. There was no way someone who looked like that, and was that good in bed, would stay single.
Mycroft hummed. “Yes, well, Sherlock does worry about little Rosamund. He’s taken quite a liking to her.”
He thought about Sherlock’s song, how it sounded like they were back to the beginning again. How he couldn’t tell that there was all that loneliness and pain in the middle. Sherlock had forgiven him completely and John realized that he was able to forgive himself too. Sherlock was happy and John couldn’t hold them back without making the song sad again. His orgasm was not toe-curling. Just a gentle wave washing over him.
sub. John had been shot and abandoned but he still had the strength to march out of the cab and down the hallway. He was in an impossible situation but he hadn’t given up. He was strong. He made Sherlock want to be worthy of him. And they’d only just met. How deep would Sherlock fall for him after a month, a year?
It was too deep, too fast. Sherlock had long since trained himself out of his gag reflex but this was still a large object—a little over twenty centimetres and with enough girth to stretch Sherlock’s jaw uncomfortably—and he’d acted impulsively, without thought to his positioning or breathing.
That was exactly it, Sherlock realized as he received a tentative lick. John was a sub, he wanted to please his Dom and he was unfamiliar with Sherlock. He needed direction until he acclimated.
“I’m fresh out. But if you boys can keep from shouting at every hour of the day maybe I can make you more.”
“How do you want to do this?” John asked breathlessly. Somehow he’d taken control of the scenario by letting Sherlock direct it. Amazing.
Marvelling at how he’d managed something so many people sought but never found, John peppered Sherlock’s back with kisses. True love. They were completely devoted to one another. No matter what happened, John always sought out Sherlock, and Sherlock always came back to John.
Maybe, after that whole thing with Mary, John had finally forgiven him. He had moved back in, after all. And he seemed to be better after he handed Rosie off to her biological father. That man (what was his name again?) from the wedding. Sherlock was livid on John’s behalf but John just seemed relieved.
“You are neither. I think having a sub will be good for you. I know my own sub has been a calming presence in my life.”
Sherlock pulled off, wiping his mouth. He gripped John’s hips with both hands and pounded into him. John’s muscles clamped down on his cock and he saw John, flushed, sweaty, with come splattered over his stomach sent Sherlock over the edge. He gripped John’s hips hard and his bollox hit against John’s arse as he came.
She winced. “It’s one of the things we have to do, so the sub knows what to expect with a command. Obviously, in this case, John shouldn’t be commanded until he adjusts.”
The people holding him back were suddenly pressing forward. They had cameras and microphones, vultures descending, making a spectacle of his friend, pulling out his organs, dragging him through the dirt and mud. Sherlock was sinking and John was trying to hold the monsters back.
John narrowed his eyes, thinking back. Who was Kate? Was that the redhead? The one who’d let them in? What did she have to do with anything?
There was a lower pitched hiss in the air and Sherlock tensed. A louder crack and a different sort of pain then the crop created bloomed over Sherlock’s buttocks. “One,” he said.
Sherlock reeled back wildly, almost running into him. John was alarmed, what had happened? John saw it a moment before Sherlock pulled it out and threw it away.
Mycroft had his sub abduct John H. Watson off the street. He waited in the warehouse, sitting on the chair getting text updates from Anthea. She had him, he was trying to chat her up. Mycroft frowned at that. Sure, Anthea didn’t have a collar but she was wearing his ring. And she was a sub. Could John not see that or did he not care?
John allowed the kiss and Sherlock was pleasantly surprised to find John being passive. John wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck and deepened the kiss. Sherlock groaned into his mouth.
Sherlock noticed the change in movement because the fingers were gone and there was something thicker pressing against his hole.
It seemed John was close to coming. He was twitching -- his legs, his hands, even his cock. He took one of his hands and felt down Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock moved to take him deeper. Sherlock knew when John felt his cock through Sherlock’s throat because John groaned.
When the back of his knees hit the bed John sat, then fell onto his back. He was soaked in sweat (when had that happened?) and his skin felt overheated.
The thing ran to Sherloc and Sherloc noticed it had writing on it like they'd seen on the rover Mycroft had let them play with on their last visit to this planet. Of course, then they'd had their original form and had been a bit giddy with all the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Sherloc wasn't feeling giddy now.
Bill was brushing Sherlock’s prostate perfectly, John’s tongue was a sin, and James was yanking on his hair hard enough for it to hurt. Bill’s fingers started digging in and Sherlock could feel him getting close. Sherlock worked his hand around James’s cock and it stiffened.
He spread John’s legs wider and laid down on his back, taking John’s caged cock into his mouth. He worked the plug and John’s cock leaked into his mouth. He sucked and rolled the flavour over his tongue.
Desperate to deduce something Sherlock leaned forward, resting his forearms on the door, his hands turned so they weren’t reaching into the car.
John started kissing Sherlock’s jaw and Sherlock couldn’t stand the tenderness. He clawed at John’s back.
John had noticed (stared, really) after Sherlock when he left the ceremony. He imagined sinking between those plush cheeks, groaning as the tight passage gave way to his—
Yes, he was curious and yes, he wanted to sate that curiosity but he could just have John write an essay after. They’d repeat this a few times until Sherlock was satisfied he had all the information. It wasn’t like it was a hardship.
John’s hand went back into Sherlock’s hair. He didn’t fuck Sherlock’s face and Sherlock was glad for it. John just moved in and out, forward and backwards, letting Sherlock match his rhythm. Sherlock found one easily.
James yanked on Sherlock’s hair from behind and pulled him up while pushing him forward, arching him until the back of his head was resting on James’s shoulder. “That’s not an answer,” he said.
He’d worked a case, once, shutting down sub slavery rings. The subs had been picked up off the streets lured in with a strong commanding Dom’s orders. They’d been so starved in their day to day lives for order most had come willingly.
Frankly, Sherlock found John’s behaviour alarming and he wondered at John’s mental state. He gave John a simple command, to get in the elevator, to see if he’d respond. He did, even following the order without undue hesitation.
John didn’t remember much of what had come after. Thank god Molly had come for Rosie. John felt bad for making her hand the note to Sherlock.
The sound of a text was nearly lost amid Rosie’s giggles and John dove for his phone. It had been seven months; Sherlock could return any day now.
“Yeah, got some more condoms too,” John said. His eyes raked down Sherlock’s chest and stopped at his flushed erection. “See you managed to get him to follow my orders.”
Carefully, Sherlock tried to remove the cage but John was too aroused. Sherlock shimmied out from between John’s thighs and rolled to get off the bed.
“No,” Sherlock gasps with sudden realization. He knows what she’s implying. Late second puberty, scent changing after primary sexual characteristics have emerged…
He unwrapped the towel from his waist and slid open the drawer, taking a dildo and lubricant out. He leaned back on the bed, feet planted firmly and legs spread wide. He took John’s laptop and opened a window. Normally he did this with private browsing but with the change in his and John’s relationship, he felt secure in letting John know what he liked.
John ran and petted Sherlock’s curls. He ran his fingers over Sherlock’s lips, meeting his wild eyes.
Christmas Eve, John had some sort of plan for them. Sherlock was happy to go along with it so long as it didn’t interfere with his own plans. John had reservations at Angelo’s and Sherlock was worried he was going to try and propose. He’d been worried and Sherlock hadn’t deduced why until John started acting smug. John hadn’t had a Christmas present. But, now he did. And he was proud of it. It was the same expression he saw on his own face when he thought about his present for John.
He was startled to find he’d always wanted to spend the rest of his life with Sherlock. Even when he was furious with him for pretending to be dead he’d wanted to be with him.
“Ah, ah, ah!” Sherlock shouted with each exhale. John spun the wheel, scraping lines into Sherlock’s flesh over the hardened nub. Sherlock let out a high pitched screeching from between his clenched teeth.
The song, for some reason, reminded John of Christmas. It started to build to another crescendo and then the bow left the strings.
The air sizzled and duel lines pain lashed in a cross over the small of Sherlock’s back, angled to miss his kidneys. “Fourteen, fifteen. Thank you, sir. Thank you.”
John hadn’t had time to shave so when Sherlock moved on to kissing his jawline and lips he got beard burn. He decided that as sexy John was with facial hair it wasn’t worth it. Still, he catalogued the feel, the rough scraping against his sensitive lips, the scratch against his cheeks. He distantly thought that maybe, had John had a beard when they’d first met, his feelings would differ.
“E-eleven!” Sherlock had to grab the mattress in order not to slide off it. He felt a line of pain across his calves. His legs shook and threatened to give out. John gave him time to recover.
“Great,” the counsellor said and moved on. “Budgeting. A lot of couples share money but some are uncomfortable. How are you going to handle bills?”
“You want to do this again? Bend me over the kitchen table? Spread my legs? Make me beg for your huge cock before ramming into me and fucking me so hard the table eventually hits the wall?”
Their lips touched and John’s thoughts scattered. He pushed into Sherlock, backing him up until he was backed into the couch. They had nearly a decade worth of pent-up sexual tension and finally had an outlet. Sherlock spun John at the last minute. John fell onto his back with an “oomph” and Sherlock spread his legs, trapping John between them. He knelt, caging John in with his arms, and kissed John again. And again. And again.
Slowly he raised back up, sticking his arse at Sherlock. He was embarrassed. This wasn’t something he should want. But just the one lick had felt so good!
John suddenly remembered the text message. "You said you'd get me off with your fingers up my arse," he reminded him.
Sherlock looked down to see John, lips red and shiny, eyes closed, long blond eyelashes brushing his pink cheeks. He licked and sucked and Sherlock had to stop him.
He pulled up a promising video. A lanky young man with dark hair was in the middle of two soldiers. It looked like at a base camp. There was a short blond man, he had a captain's insignia and he looked to be in charge despite the man who was in a major’s uniform.
That cinched it. This wasn't a joke. John stood, the chair scraping the floor behind him. He walked up, took Sherlock’s hands in his own and said, “I love you too.”
Just when Sherlock’s brow furrowed and his mouth twisted John thought he’d had enough. He dragged the feather along the arch of Sherlock’s foot.
He tackled Sherlock to the ground and they mock wrestled, neither gaining the upper hand until a knock sounded at the door.
John arched his back and shouted Sherlock’s name into the pillow, chanting it as Sherlock fucked with his tongue, keeping the seal with his mouth.
He turned on the mobile and called for takeout before checking for documents from his home planet. There weren't any. He reported in and read the documents the other council members had prepared for him while he was gone. There were different trade agreements and news on colony members and their adjustments to the planet. There was a proposition to release smallpox to reduce the human population that failed to pass the vote because no one was certain they couldn't contact the virus as well. He knew he'd have to do something about the overpopulation problem before one of his colleagues decided to take matters into their own hands. Mycroft noted that many things were in the works, they'd slowed research on new antibiotics and antivirals and had convinced the humans in many countries to stop vaccinating. Mycroft felt that was a better approach than some of the others, starting wars was another idea. Mycroft thought they should prevent births instead of killing those already alive and was wondering how to approach birth control in India while he scrolled through news headlines.
“JOHN!” he screamed as he came. He tried to maintain eye contact but he couldn’t. He was low on oxygen, he’d been aroused for too long. His eyes closed as John worked him through. Splatters hit his stomach and a drip rolled around his hip.
John licked his lips. His arse was still a little tender from Sherlock’s attention last night and he wanted to claim Sherlock after hearing Irene’s little moans. He had gotten a little something else when he’d bought the cock cage but had set it aside, unsure.
Sherlock getting fucked was turning John on. This whole thing was depraved. Sherlock moaned around James’s cock and started worshiping it. The weight on his tongue, the shapes of the skin under the latex, the heat, the
John’s face flushed and he was mortified. He remembered Sherlock’s scream and that they’d knocked some of the plaster down they’d knocked the headboard against the wall so much.
Sherlock took a seat in an armchair on the off chance that the counsellor would say something upsetting and John would turn to him for comfort (and because he didn’t want John to recoil or slide away from him when he read his profile).
“Don’t stop!” Sherlock cried. “That was my prostate!” He wriggled to try and get them to move again.
He worked John until his jaw started to get sore. Then he took a break to suck on John’s testicles and run his teeth against John’s perineum. He bit at John’s arse before sucking a love bite onto one cheek.
“Please, please, please, please,” John chanted, lowering his upper body to his elbows and dropping his head onto his forearms.
Maybe he was overreacting. Sure, he’d lashed out, but Sherlock sounded fine. Maybe it wasn’t as bad as he’d thought. Maybe he’d just held Sherlock down, and hadn’t hit him like he’d thought.
Next, John checked the bedroom. It had John’s old bed in it as well as the furniture that didn’t fit in John’s room anymore and all of John’s boxes that he’d wanted to keep were there as well. John decided he’d go through it later and move everything to a proper place.
When he glanced over and realized John had no such compunctions regarding watching him disrobe, Sherlock started putting on a show. Nothing overt, he just told his body to slow down and move more fluidly.
“You’re huge,” Sherlock groaned as James let go of his hips and John let gravity work Sherlock down. John had used a nearly excessive amount of lube. It would have been too much had Sherlock not already been fucked for so long.
Before John could castigate himself too much, Sherlock rested his hand against the back of John’s neck, rubbing gently. “I wasn’t complaining,” he said with a filthy smirk and a pointed drag of his hips.
“Uh…” Watson shook himself out of his daze. “Right, I found this civilian sneaking around.” He looked up at the other man, uniform indicating his name was Sholto. “I was just finding out why.”
Only then did Sherlock slide his finger inside. He stroked John’s insides, searching for the little nub.
John inspected Sherlock’s cock carefully. It looked a little inflamed, but then it had been through an ordeal.
“I don’t see why she’s complaining, she had the best gossip at bridge and Mrs Turner and her stopped their feud complaining about the noise to each other.
John had him slide the sound up and down twice more before allowing him to take it out and set it on the tray.
Sherlock looked in the mirror, seeing pearly white come all over his face. John had gotten his chin in addition to the other parts. His curls were sweat soaked and his face and chest were flushed.
“Here,” he said and handed his sub his cane. He was going out of his way to be nice and caring. It was absurd, he didn’t want a reliant sub but something in Sherlock made him want to provide. He’d never felt this way around a sub before. Of course, he’d never wanted a sub before.
“You were interested before your commander showed up. If he gives you the go ahead it wouldn’t be cheating. Really, it saved us a step and your guilt later.”
Sherlock screamed as he came, making John’s ears ring. The come shot up the bed. He twitched and writhed and he was still coming when John realized he should probably turn off the massager.
“SHERLOCK!” John shouted and he thrust so hard that Sherlock scooted across the floor. Once, twice, then John fell on him.
James’s lips were dry, chapped from dehydration and the sun. But his tongue took advantage of Sherlock’s open mouth and Sherlock was lost in the sensation. James pulled Sherlock against his sweaty, muscular body and started pawing at his arse.
That’s when the smell registered. He smelt Sherlock’s expensive cologne. His eyes flew open and he raised himself to his elbows.
He waited and when Sherlock didn’t relax or start up a conversation John said, “He said you weren’t a good man.”
Sherlock fell forward; he braced himself against John’s thighs but his nose still mashed against John’s pubis. Sherlock’s throat closed but he successfully suppressed his gag reflex.
“I don’t know,” the man admitted. “She started burning them as they came. I took these ones straight from the mail.”
“Aarguh!” Bill shouted as he came, buried deep. John was waiting and once Bill bottomed he shoved his cock all the way down Sherlock’s throat. The sensation of being impaled on both ends nearly made him come. He was so close!
And if John wanted to do kinky roleplay involving butt plugs he would be doing it with Sherlock and no one else. Sherlock was done with all the girlfriends and he wasn’t about to allow boyfriends that weren’t him near his John.
“Never! You’re a romantic, and when those efforts are focused on me I’m quite fond of that aspect of your personality.” With a pleased smile, Sherlock showed off his own finger. “I made mine to match. Your eyes are much trickier to get right, you know.”
John was dizzy. He could barely catch his breath. His lips slid against Sherlock’s, Sherlock claiming them, tasting them, nibbling on them before licking fiercely. John opened his mouth, gasping, needing more and Sherlock’s tongue entered his mouth. He tasted like honey. John wrapped his hand around the back of Sherlock’s head, holding him in place as he licked inside Sherlock’s mouth.
John soared above cavernous mountains and miles of sand. His squad was going to strike one of the green dragon’s encampments in the forest. It was a long flight; it’d take several days of continuous just to get there and they’d meet the reconnaissance team and then they plan an attack that would take the green dragons out. Another group of brown dragons was going to meet them there coming from a different camp. John’s team was ranged support.
they found Sherlock and he hadn’t been married long enough for him to damage John, he’d have to jump through hoops to keep his sister from abandonment charges.
“Sixteen, seventeen,” Sherlock counted as the crop landed on the backs of each of his thighs. He didn’t feel pain anymore, only pleasure.
“Why?” John asked, confused. He rather liked being next to the bathroom. There was a toilet upstairs but John didn’t use it. It was more than a little finicky.
John was completely naked. He had his arse pointed to the door and was on his knees and forearms. The skin between his thighs glistened.
John hummed again. He got a lot of comments on his ring. He’d found some synthetic stone that changed colour depending on the light; they’d called it a bi-colour sapphire. The stone didn’t capture the range of colours that Sherlock’s eyes had - there were no greens or teals - but he’d found one on discount that had a fleck of yellow in it. He had set it in a white gold band that he’d had stamped with a fleur-de-lis, designed to match the one that had been on the wallpaper. When it was dark, the stone looked silver, like Sherlock’s eyes had in the lab when they first met. When it was light, the blue in the stone shone through.
He was high on endorphins and he was pretty sure he’d never felt this complete. He had given orders before, in fact, he was in the habit of bossing around Lestrade and his team. Commanding John was completely different.
Sherlock had just turned thirty, all attempts at chance meetings with potential matches had failed. He was officially in the matching system now. Mycroft had all potential matches run through him first--he didn’t want his brother to end up with someone completely unsuitable--and had “accidentally” deleted three sub profiles so far.
He’d deduced the size of John’s cock, had seen his trousers tented, had even seen it flaccid on occasion. Never had he seen it exposed and erect. His heart rate sped up.
John threw his head back and groaned. He reached between them and Sherlock felt pressure at his hole.
Sherlock tried to slide onto the floor but John caught him. Sherlock hissed as John pushed on his welts and bruises.
As John moved in, out, in, out, each slow drag sent shivers down Sherlock’s spine. John’s stomach rubbed against Sherlock’s cock, the space between them already moist with Sherlock’s pre-come and sweat.
Sherlock opened his mouth to object but James filled it with his tongue. James was a skilled kisser and whenever Sherlock moved to try to take charge of the kiss, Bill would move away from Sherlock’s neck. Sherlock wrapped his hand around Bill’s head to hold him in place when he got to a good spot and surged forward to James, wrapping his other arm around James’ back.
He could hear voices and he figured John got held up by Mrs Hudson. He flopped back onto the bed and sighed loudly. He mentally willed John to come up the stairs. The door opened and shut and Sherlock waited, listening, but he only heard Mrs Hudson puttering around her flat, no John.
John swallowed thickly. He had that same glint in his eye he had when he was hitting on her. Oh. Interesting.
“Sherlock, your sub is at risk of a drop. You need to place your hand firmly but gently on the back of his neck, curl your fingers around…” Sherlock did as she said. “…Yes, like that.”
There were texts from Irene but Sherlock didn’t respond for months. It was from July that a text bubble appeared that wasn’t grey. John scrolled up to see the date.
John felt something in his chest clench. So, Sherlock did expect a Christmas present. That meant he had one for John already.
It was surprisingly easy to get into a routine at 221B. After you got used to the eyeballs, that is.
The tail didn’t sit properly no matter how Sherlock moved it but he decided not to worry about it. A quick check in the mirror made sure his hair looked natural around the headband.
The praise went straight to Sherlock’s cock. He came with a shout, angling his hips so he could mark John’s stomach.
They had breakfast and John browsed rooftop beekeeping supplies. He realized there was a lot of knowledge that he needed to make the decision for the best and, since it was the twenty-second, there was no way anything he ordered would arrive in time. It was probably best to let Sherlock buy whatever he wanted anyway.
The zing down his spine when Sherlock licked then blew cold air over his nipple. The heat the pooled in his abdomen when Sherlock bit it. The sharp sting of his teeth biting down on his lip. The tension in his shoulders when Sherlock’s finger poked and prodded his hole. The slick chilly crawl of lube as it dripped from his hole. Then the burning stretch of another finger sliding in against the first. The light behind his eyes as Sherlock slowly stroked his prostate. Sherlock’s hot hard prick sliding along his own. Speeding, faster and faster. A drip of sweat on his face. Looking up to see Sherlock absolutely wrecked above him. His face twisted in pleasure, sweaty hair sticking to his forehead as his hips snapped against John’s.
John was lucky. He was the luckiest man in the universe. He hadn’t died in Afghanistan and he’d found Sherlock Holmes. And when he thought he’d missed his chance, that he’d lost his best friend and the love of his life, Sherlock came back. And, if that wasn’t a big enough miracle, Sherlock hadn’t scorned John when he confessed his love, he’d kissed him. Then, somehow, they’d gotten here, with Sherlock sleeping peacefully in John’s arms.
Well, that would be awful for him and awkward for his sub. On the sub’s side, there was one person, obviously an old army friend. He was wearing his dress uniform too and the government’s collar. He was on leave and was clearly the only person his John had been able to ask to his wedding.
“Not at all,” John said. He didn't mind Sherlock having a lot of strange kinky sex with him. In fact, he'd rather it than with someone else.
Sherlock walked toward him and tripped over the leg of a chair, he managed to fall into it as opposed to over it so he counted it as a win.
Another slap and Sherlock felt a chill run down his spine. John still wasn’t holding back. “Two,” he said as his other arse cheek went warm.
“Ah, ah, ah,” he gasped, he couldn’t tell John he was ok, he didn’t have the breath but maybe John would see…
Sherlock looked back into the man’s eyes and found them darker, pupils dilated. Sherlock lowered his voice to say, “Tell me a better place to find soldiers.”
John pressed his lips to Sherlock’s, giggles interrupting the kiss and keeping it chaste. John sat up on Sherlock’s hips, wanting some space but not wanting Sherlock to get away at the same time.
When they were both seated John asked, “Didn’t your family want to, I don’t know, take pictures or something?”
John stated that he had survived the crash. He'd heard from O'Murtagh and Martinez was dead. He wasn't quite sure what to say about the creature so he didn't say anything. Whatever it was, was obviously intelligent and John didn't want to receive orders to kill it... or worse.
Arms wrapped around Sherlock, one undoing a button in the middle of his purple shirt and sliding inside. The other stroked his erection through his trousers. He could feel James grind against his arse.
Then Sherlock moved down to John’s neck. John had intended to tell him that he wasn’t allowed to leave marks anymore (they weren’t sixteen anymore) but he was too far gone to care. Sherlock sucked and nibbled down one side then the other.
Sherlock wrapped his limbs around John and ground his erection against John until they were both hard.
Sherlock felt the sting on his other upper thigh. “Twenty-four,” he counted. The last blow landed on his testicles. Sherlock’s back arched as a high-pitched cry was ripped from him. “Twenty-five!” He felt sick.
Suddenly, John was accosted with the memory of tackling Sherlock to the ground after seeing him for the first time, the little pained gasp he had let escape. Had John bumped his broken ribs? (Most certainly.) Had he pulled out his stitches? (Probably.) Was it flashbacks from being trapped under an angry threatening man?
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He could be open here. He’d never see these men again. “But I’m willing to settle for one of you.” Sholto was blond, and more muscular than John. He needed more information to deduce the size of his cock, but he was sure it was adequate.
Sherlock shuffled back across the room and his little penguin walk finally broke John. He started laughing causing Sherlock to look back and glare.
to the list. “Did we hurt you? We were too rough, weren’t we? Here, bend over the cot. Let me have a look.”
Sherlock smirked. Yes, the gym nearest to their flat was his. Those meddling school children on the red team shouldn’t ever have control.
Sherlock was livid with himself. He should have known better! He knew John had been abandoned. He should have tempered his command. Made it a one on the scale instead of going full out. Then he’d have fulfilled the counsellor’s request and wouldn’t have put John at risk. How could he have been so stupid? This was primary school stuff!
They were silent for a bit. John knew he was waiting for John to tell him why he called. John didn’t really want to tell Lestrade he called because he’d probably given Sherlock an STI and their landlady had heard their very loud and frequent sex.
Rosie nodded and started a fight with her veil. John straightened it out for her and she smiled, eyes bright and gleaming when they met his in the mirror. At her father’s expression her smile fell.
He took his coat and spread it across the floor while John took off his shoes, trousers and pants. John kissed Sherlock and ran his hand up under Sherlock’s shirt.
“John! My sub! He didn’t run when I told him to!” Sherlock pointed to the ring on his finger. “Where’s John?!”
The man Sherlock turned away in order to have sex was actually an embezzler and his cheating wife knew about this and so she’d gotten a cat and John really didn’t follow the rest. Sherlock wouldn’t explain everything properly until the case was over.
commanding him to stay put and that he was sending a car to pick him up, much to John’s dismay. He knew he’d been abandoned, but having other people know, having the government know, was horrifying. He knew the officer coming would give him the test to see if he was a danger to himself or others, they’d pry into his marriage and if—
Sherlock went to the lab, took off his scarf and coat and fiddled with the microscope. It was the lab where they’d met, Sherlock couldn’t think of a more important place for his life. Here, he’d met the love of his life.
I wrote this for a different fic that I ended up never posting. I tried to edit it so it fits the same tone. Hopefully you'll like it.
And John’s mood, which had improved with Sherlock’s laughter, plummeted. This fake relationship was starting to feel like a one-sided romance. He decided to distract himself.
John carefully, catching Sherlock’s eye to make sure it was ok, started moving forward. Sherlock moved so that he was taking the dildo and John in at the same time and then John would rock back and Sherlock would take a deep breath, sliding up the dildo so only the end was still in him. Then John would move forward and Sherlock was impaled on both ends.
Well, that was a problem. Sherlock would need to get John a Christmas gift. They’d gone shopping together before, and to Sherlock’s horror, he realized he’d be dragged along this year too. Getting gifts for Mrs Hudson and Harry and—shudder—Mycroft.
“It’s not… I’m not… It’s just…” John ground his teeth in frustration. He twisted his fist around the sheet.
It was like a punch to the gut. John had only a couple minutes to consider he even had a chance with Sherlock and although the possibility terrified him it had also electrified him.
Sherlock moved the hand that was on James to John’s hip. He guided John to the edge of the cot as Sherlock knelt up and turned. He managed to keep the tip of John’s cock in his mouth the whole time.
“You need to hold still for this,” John said. “That is, if you’re not going to be doing it to yourself.”
The counsellor handed them each a folder before sitting in the other armchair. Sherlock opened his immediately and John looked to the counsellor to see if he should do the same. She didn’t look disapproving so John decided to open his as well. Half of the folder had handouts, John flipped through those quickly, seeing pamphlets on safe sex, safe words and consent, resources for abuse and other standard things. The other side of the folder was much more interesting. His profile was on top, his scores on the cover page with pages stapled below them. John figured they were his limits and sexual profile. He didn’t check because there was a similar stapled packet below his with
“Oh, I’ve already rented out my flat to a lovely couple but I’ve left upstairs alone—aside from cleaning out the fridge. Sherlock will never forgive me when he comes back if he’s homeless.”
It was like John had been waiting for the command. Like he’d been holding himself in check until he was allowed to go further.
As soon as Mrs Hudson was out the door Sherlock shut and locked it. He turned just in time to see John crowd him up against the door. John seemed to have grown three times, he was everywhere, his lips on Sherlock’s, his hand rucking up Sherlock’s shirt, his other groping Sherlock’s arse.
But it took a toll on Sherloc, they stumbled and fell. They were cold. They'd never been this cold before. Their body was seizing and shaking. It was terrifying. Their eyes were leaking again and they nearly careened headfirst to the dirt when their body stopped responding. But Watson caught them and carried them. Sherloc clung to the odd feeling fabric, trying to be helpful instead of plain dead weight. They didn't want to die.
Sherlock shifted, waiting for the last blows and when they didn’t come Sherlock begged, “Please, hit me with the belt. I need it. Please, sir.”
If John had known it was that easy to get Sherlock to sleep on a case he would have slept with him long ago. (There were many reasons John wished he’d started sleeping with Sherlock long ago.)
“No!” Then John stopped to think. Actually, it had been very good. Just surprising was all. “No, I just wasn’t expecting that.”
Anthea and Mycroft didn’t have a romantic attachment. In fact, they didn’t even live together. She worked for him ten hours a day, six days a week. Both of them sought comfort in other’s beds and Mycroft had told Anthea that she was free to find someone to collar her if she so wished. But she was happy with their arrangement as well.
The pressure was gone and Sherlock tried to relax. It hadn’t been a lack of lube, it had been a moment of weakness—of fear. He was in a foreign country between two men he didn’t know. No one knew he was with them and they could do anything to him. He’d known this and had sought it out, but reality hadn’t really sunk in until he’d felt that pressure.
“Nothing,” Sherlock said honestly. At John’s obvious confusion he decided he needed to spell it out. “All those interviews Janine gave were revenge. She made stuff up for money. Bought a house out in Sussex with it.” Sherlock shrugged.
“What? No, I… what?” John stammered. He decided it wasn’t important and said what he had intended to say, “I don’t have the address.”
John lifted his sun visor to get a better look at the creature. It was worrying that it didn't seem fazed by death.
There was something about John Watson. He had originally assumed that Sherlock felt like he’d be forced to have sex with him. But, once Sherlock started talking again he figured it out. That Sherlock was afraid. Sherlock would have never admitted it to anyone and he was quite embarrassed about it. But John didn’t tease him.
Sherlock got as far as he could without the dildo leaving him so he had John shuffle forward until Sherlock’s nose was buried in John’s pubic hair. Sherlock swallowed around John, causing him to shout and he aborted a thrust in.
John decided it was time to step in. There was a case Lestrade wanted them to take, he’d talked to John on multiple occasions and all they really needed to do was go to a fancy dress party and have Sherlock observe the people there. Greg was sure that Sherlock would be able the ID the murderer straight away.
“It’s only for a little bit,” Mycroft assured him. “Just until your little escapade sorts itself out.”
I've got two chaptes for you then there's gonna probably be a little pause in updates, I've got finals in a week and a half and I need to write a policy memo for class, but we'll see what happens.
“Off.” He pulled the waistband of John’s briefs and let it snap against his skin with his free hand.
“Someone with friends in very high places,” Sherlock answered. “Now, as I said, leave or be escorted to the Dean’s. You’re choice.”
Sherlock was out of the cab first and paid the driver as John got out and shut the door. He straightened his coat as he looked up at the restaurant and gave Sherlock a curious as he stood next to him.
“Mr. Moran, unless you’d prefer a nice trip to the Dean’s office you will cease this harassment of Mr. Watson.”
“We shall improvise,” Sherlock said as he picked up the bottle and proceeded to take a long drink. He offered it to John once they finished and pulled it just out of the other’s man reach.
“Will you pay attention!” Irene braced her hands on his desk. “Honestly, it’s like speaking to a child.”
Sherlock smirked and did it again a muffled cry stifled against John’s hand as his pace faltered a bit. John kept one hand in Sherlock’s hair while the other gripped his back tightly content to let Sherlock take over.
“If you weren’t interested you would’ve told me to fuck off,” the man replied. He smiled amused. “But you haven’t.”
“Our anniversary of course,” she smiled. “Two years this November. At least, that’s what we’ll be telling people. Wonderful isn’t it?”
Sherlock reached for his phone again but she placed her's over his before he could pick it up. She looked at him with a soft smile, but steel in her gaze.
“I think...I think you two were kindred spirits, and god that makes me a little jealous,” John admitted as he took Sherlock’s hands. “But, he hurt you. I can see it in your eyes.”
“I’m fine, just a headache. I get them from time to time,” Sherlock waved his hand dismissively and swayed on his feet.
“John, I want to help you because you’re one my students and it’s my job to make sure you’re okay,” Sherlock remained calm.
They thanked him once John had finished getting changed and Sherlock clutched both photos and disc in his hands like a lifeline of sorts.
Sherlock turned and walked back to the sitting room. He picked up the stack of paper he’d left on the coffee table and picked up his pen resuming the composition he’d been working on earlier that evening.
He leaned down and kissed him as he wrapped his hand around his length and began stroking in time with his thrusts.
John pressed his finger to Sherlock’s lips, he was suddenly upset, not with Sherlock, he didn’t think he could be upset with Sherlock. No. He was upset with whoever had been there before him.
He was brought out of his thoughts when the door open and a girl nearly ran out of the office, holding her bag to her chest.
“I thought I told you not to wear that cologne…” John stood once he was sure he wasn’t going be sick again and flushed before turning to wash out his mouth. He covered his nose as he stepped into the bedroom and saw Sherlock sitting on the edge of the bed with his hands in his lap.
“Yeah?” John fiddled with the button on Sherlock’s jacket. “The one with the marshmallows and pieces of cone and caramel?”
John blinked and looked at Sherlock confused as the man started to move around. Sherlock shoved the bunched sheets to the edge of the bed as he climbed on top of John. He braced his hands on either side of John’s head making the other man look up at him. John spread his legs, his cheeks redder as one of Sherlock’s knees came to rest between his thighs, not quite touching his crotch.
“Angela thinks suffocation, I’m inclined to agree. There are no medical records indicating he was prone to seizures.”
“That’s...that’s wonderful!” Sherlock grinned. “Oh there’s so much we can do with all that extra time! And mummy will be so excited, she’s really been hinting that she’d love for us to come to see her before she and father go on their cruise.”
Sherlock swallowed as he thought back to the last case. “He’s a GP at a local surgery.” He said instead. “Could he have caught it there?”
As to answer any questions about why Lestrade and Mycroft used a surrogate rest assured it will be answered in the next coming chapters or so.
Would Sherlock have put his arm around him? How nice would that have felt if he had? He sighed and looked back down at the textbook on the desk in front of him.
Sherlock smiled as he titled John’s chin up and gave him a kiss. There were still remnants of chocolate and caramel on his breath as John leaned up to return the kiss.
The stores Sherlock picked up his clothes from are Charles Tyrwhitt, Burton's Menswear and Hackett London. I made up the maternity store for John.
“Oh…I see...” Sherlock stood and inclined his head towards John’s building.  “Perhaps this conversation would be better had inside?”
Sherlock thanked him and strode out to the waiting room where John was waiting with a curious gaze. He was not wrong about the attraction part, even before they agreed to have a baby, Sherlock had found John more attractive than the average man or woman.
Lestrade stood up at the knock on his office door and gave Sherlock a ‘behave’ look before opening the door and smiling at the woman on the other side. She was a bit taller than John with strawberry blonde hair, dark brown eyes, and lightly tanned skin. She was dressed in a fitted pantsuit, attention focused solely on Sherlock.
Dr. Carters was a stout man, with a clear smoking habit. Sherlock took a decisive step away if John noticed Sherlock drawing himself to his full height and placing a hand on his shoulder he said nothing.
The matron stabbed the bag of sand with a large flat knife and with a twist, sand began steadily falling onto the plate. John found himself more fascinated with watching Sherlock rather than the man tied to the chair working himself out of his bonds.
“Right…” Sherlock cleared his throat a little as he folded the paper and tossed it onto the floor. He rose and buttoned his jacket back up while John took a few minutes to reorient himself.
He shifted so his face was level with John’s stomach. He rucked up John’s t-shirt and placed his hands on either side. Another kick came a couple moments later, near where Sherlock’s left hand was placed.
“John…” Sherlock sounded exasperated as he knocked for the one-hundredth time. “John, how was I supposed to know she was
He set the phone aside and finished brushing his teeth. He shoved his phone into his back pocket and grabbed his backpack and keys as he left his dorm and locked the door behind him.
He’d dressed in a pair of worn jeans that were stretched enough to fit around the slowly growing swell of his abdomen, and one of the sweaters they’d picked up at the store a few days ago. The one Sherlock had picked out, a nice dark green v-neck with fitted cuffs on the wrists.
“I assume these are yours then?” the woman held up his red briefs with one perfectly manicured finger and smirked.
John nodded a little understanding and Sherlock led him into the restaurant. Sherlock had only been once before, a few years previous, but he was pleased to find much hadn’t changed as they followed the maitre d'  to their table.
“M’not,” Sherlock shook his head. “I use nothing.” He flung his arms out in an attempt at overdramatics and knocked the bottle of wine over. He blinked and watched the red liquid seeping out onto the sheets.
his mind supplied unhelpfully. “Teaching does seem the odd occupation for me, but I do enjoy it. Having the ability to shape the minds of the future, it’s exhilarating. Better than any high I’ve ever felt.”
“As a final act of redemption, I will look over your paper again and give you a fair grade,” Sherlock told him.
Sherlock chuckled and grabbed the bottle of lube he’d stashed under the pillow when he’d left their bags in the room and poured a bit into his hand to coat his fingers. He made sure to be quick but thorough with the prep, Sherlock knew for a fact he himself was not going to last very long but he wanted it to be good for John.
“Why didn’t you just pick Donavon to take over for you while you’re on leave, I know she hates me but at least I know her,” Sherlock crossed his arms over his chest.
Sherlock nearly growled as his phone began vibrating on the table and rolled over to grab it bringing John with him. John wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s torso and laid his head on Sherlock’s chest. He let one hand trail downwards and just let it rest on the waistline of his briefs.
“What do you mean you’re going to drinks with her?” John asked. “You never go out for drinks with anybody, I’ve to drag you there kicking and screaming.”
“How do you get your hair to curl like this?” John asked. He twisted a couple locks around his fingers and gave a small tug.
“Oh, you know, nights at the opera, dinner on a private yacht around the river, perhaps a few nights at the orchestra, I’ve season tickets…” Sherlock said dismissively.
“I love you Sherlock,” John pulled him down for a kiss and smiled more as Sherlock made a pleased sound in the back of his throat as they kissed.
“My reasonings were not half-assed,” John crossed his arms over his chest. “What is your problem with me? Ever since you found out I’m in your class you’ve been nothing but a jerk and an asshole.”
Sherlock followed his gaze to the young woman standing in the doorway. She smiled and gave a small wave towards John.
“No. No, I think that’s an excellent act of redemption,” John told him. “Thanks…” He shoved his hands in his pockets and started for the door.
The room was plunged into relative darkness and he picked up the remote. He turned on his heel to face the room and brought up the first slide.
“Tour?” Sherlock asked as he led him inside and upstairs. “Living room, sitting room, office, kitchen, bathroom, and bedroom.”
“Yours had a point. Adam Smith is dull,” Sherlock answered. “Yet there was doubt in your voice when you brought him up. I was giving you the opportunity to explain.”
“What do you mean you canceled my appointment for this afternoon…? Have you suddenly changed your mind?” John asked carefully.
John slipped off his shoes and sat on his bed suddenly exposed. He rubbed his hands together not sure of what to say.
. I want to marry you and spend the rest of my life with you and if other people can’t seem to get that through their heads then they’re not worth my time,” Sherlock told him. “I only have eyes for you, John. You’re the only one I want to have kids with and the only one I want to marry and the only one I want to have sex with. No one else will ever compare to you. Especially not DI Monroe.”
Sherlock reached into the cabinet and took down the cookie jar and set it on the counter. He reached inside and fished out a biscuit as he watched his mother check the food on the stove.
England's unusually pleasant weather was far too cheery for somebody as agitated as Sherlock Holmes was at that moment. He sat in the flatbed of the pickup with his boyfriend, who was possessively holding him from behind with one arm while carrying on a conversation with Sally Donovan, Philip Anderson, and Greg Lestrade. Sherlock was doing his best to ignore them as he hunched over a piece of paper, deep in discussion with Soo Lin Yao on traditional Chinese characters. Apparently, you could break down characters into different components that each have their own meaning or cultural significance. It was like a puzzle. The whole study of Hanzi was rather interesting and Soo Lin had a large wealth of knowledge in Chinese culture. In fact, Soo Lin was surprisingly knowledgeable on a wide variety of topics, including history, law, and art, but Sherlock had yet to deduce how she had acquired the knowledge. All he knew - well, cared to know - was that her and her brother, Liang, were not here in the UK legally.
When Mrs. Watson was finally satisfied, she opened the door to reveal John's alpha. He was leaning against the door jamb, one leg kicked up casually behind the other with both hands in his jeans pockets. An old, white T-shirt was visible underneath the tan jacket he wore. His head was bowed, only showing a ostentatious London hat. But as the door opened, the man lifted his head to reveal a surprisingly young face with pale and soft features. He was chewing gum and his eyes immediately bypassed Mrs. Watson to fix on John. A predatory smile grew on his face, giving a distinct impression of a snake setting its sight on a mouse, wanting to tease and play with its food before swallowing the mouse whole. Sherlock couldn't help but step in front, blocking John from this stranger's view. The alpha's gaze was now on him instead. His face didn't necessarily change expressions, but a fire of anger and contempt grew in his eyes.
Soo Lin giggled, which Sherlock did not understand. In absolutely no conceivable way was this funny. John was ruining absolutely
"Oh, for God's sake! Shut up before you lower the IQ of the whole street," Sherlock snapped in frustration.
"I'm John's boyfriend," Sherlock quickly interrupted, hoping this information would get the newcomer to back out. Dull men like him must have stupidly high morals and wouldn't want to ruin a perfectly good relationship.
Predictably, John went bright red. It contrasted nicely with his sandy blond hair, making it look even brighter in the sun.
? He let some anger loose by jamming his elbow backwards, squarely hitting his boyfriend in the ribs. The pained yelp was only a small vindication for his troubles.
Normally, Sherlock would have counted this as a perfectly happy moment. John Watson was wrapped around him and he was having an intriguing, intellectual conversation with a criminal. He would have stored it in his mind palace as a memory to come back to on more melancholy days. However, none of this could be viewed as a happy occasion because, Jesus Christ, he was going to
"Yeah, of course. I'm fine," John replied in a way that meant he really wasn't fine. Thankfully, Lestrade could see through it.
"Harriet and I fixed up the guest house for you two. It's heat-proof, so you two won't have any disturbances," Mrs. Watson said with a wink.
"Harriet, don't be so dramatic. The lower classes may have stopped, but it is still a very common practice among upper society. I would have set one up for you if you hadn't been so... unruly. No man would have made us an offer even if I had tried."
Hesitating for only a moment, Mr. Watson nodded. He and his wife backed away, allowing the new couple a modicum of privacy. Jim smiled, fully satisfied and victorious before crouching down. John immediately took advantage of the close proximity and crawled weakly into the brunet's lap.
But before Mr. Watson could finish, the ringing of the doorbell echoed through the house. All arguing ceased immediately, leaving a heavy silence to follow.
"Oh, that must be him! Come, come," Mrs. Watson cheered, motioning for people to follow as she bustled out of the room. Apparently, the prospect of introducing John's future husband was enough to let her forget all the unresolved anger in the room.
Sherlock let out an overly dramatic sigh that some might consider to be more of a groan. "You're practically draped over me," he said as he indicated John's current position. "You always put a respectable distance between us in public, yet now you've done the opposite. You are constantly shifting, which is usually a sign of anxiety. Although, you aren't showing any of the other indicators and your pupils are blown, so that only leaves the possibility that you are simply trying to get some friction to your penis. We will be at your house in approximately four and a half minutes. We will deal with your predicament there. Until then, control yourself so that you don't waste any more of my time!"
The last part was sneered, making his gender sound like a vile insult. Sherlock only narrowed his eyes, refusing to let it affect him.
Even after dating John Watson for one year, four months, and twelve days, the pleasure of John's lips on his own was still breathtaking. It was a different experience every time. Sherlock has spent hours alone in his room dissecting and cataloging the intricacies of snogging that John seemed to navigate effortlessly. This time, John wasted no time in the build up, immediately diving his tongue in to lick every crevice of the taller boy's mouth.
"Sherlock?" Mrs. Watson laughed, apparently forgetting that the boy in question was standing right there. "What does he have to do with anything?"
With confusion, he cautiously looked behind him and what he saw terrified him. John was no longer the angry, stubborn Watson he was a minute ago. He was now visibly sweating and his breathing had become labored. One hand was splayed against the wall seeking some kind of support while the other was clenched tightly at his side. This was the look of someone in pain and struggling for control. Despite this, his blue eyes never left Jim's. Omega stared at alpha, partly with fear and partly with... something else that made Sherlock's heart clench.
John started working his hand counter to his mouth as he bobbed up and down. Sherlock was vocal, moaning, groaning and calling John’s name.
A bead of sweat run up his spine to his neck. Sweat was dripping down his face. His legs were shaking, about to give out. One more minute, John was nearly shaking.
Sherlock exited the bathroom followed by a cloud of steam. He had a thin white towel wrapped low around his hips.
Sherlock searched the internet for John H. Watson. He didn’t come up with anything useable. John was a common name and the surname didn’t help weed out enough people. There was always the chance that John didn’t have any social media accounts, like him.
Then the woman had Sherlock give John a command. Sherlock told him to stand and at the same time the command was so strong he wanted to drop to his knees. His body warred with itself and he nearly fainted. He stood, obeying the command then Sherlock had to help him to his knees. He thought he might die of embarrassment.
Sherlock stopped and John came to a halt beside him. The cabbie stopped too. John looked up to Sherlock, wanting to know what their next move was. Sherlock looked around, searching the area for additional threats. John did too. He didn’t see anything. Apparently, neither did Sherlock, he sauntered up to the cab, leaning in when the window rolled down.
Sherlock gasped and came into his palm. He cleaned his hand with tissues and curled up on the bed, disappointed John was still gone. He wouldn’t have said no to a cuddle.
It was mesmerizing and Sherlock decided to lay down and lick it out of John’s hole, using the same techniques he’d used when he was getting the lube out.
John ordered a Pikachu costume for himself online, he figured if he got really desperate he could tell Sherlock it was a convention or something.
Sherlock sent a glare over his shoulder that told John not to go easy on him. “Please, John, punish me,” he said flatly to goad John further.
Sherlock put himself in a defensive position in front of John and John tried to move to get around him.
He kept up his righteous anger all the way out the front door and was still huffing angerly when he stood next to Sherlock.
So when John’s breathing slowed and evened out Sherlock noticed. He looked at John, the man looked so different relaxed in sleep. Sherlock examined him, updating his mind palace John of new grey hairs, wrinkles, how his eyelashes looked as the light from the television bounced off them.
Sherlock shouted in rage and swept the table, sending all his chemistry equipment to the floor. The shattering glass didn’t make him feel any better.
Murray was on leave and he squeezed John’s upper arm in support. They were waiting for the word that the official was ready for them.
“Then why?” John wanted to ask why Sherlock was experimenting with him. Why he was playing games with him.
The device the dead Terran—no, woman—was using was a communicator! Sherloc didn't know if all Terrans were dim-witted or just if this one was. Or maybe it—he—was injured? Sherloc didn't like that thought and waved it off. They had the mystery of the murdered Terran woman to solve. She had different writing on her outfit, it read
William narrowed his eyes. “Come on, we’re going to be late,” he said and stalked off down the hall.
Even better. “Fourteen. Please, sir, more, harder, please!” Sherlock shivered as he felt the leather tongue slide over his abused body. John traced it up and down his spine, dragged it over the plug. Sherlock writhed on the bed and humped the mattress.
Finally, John arrived in the communications room. There he found Mary's body. He checked her over. It looked like she hadn't been strapped in when they crashed and hit her head. Why hadn't she been wearing her helmet? The creeping sensation intensified.
“I see what you mean,” John said. He moved his hands to Sherlock’s waist and walked around to join James. He stroked a thumb over Sherlock’s lips, still moist from the kiss. “Hard choice.”
The sight was amazing and John came on the spot, shooting his come across Sherlock’s chest. He took a moment to breathe before he ran to Sherlock, turned him carefully and clicked off the massager.
But John was like a drug. He hadn’t been upset when Sherlock deduced him. He had smiled. They’d shared a moment. Sherlock couldn’t help wanting to know all about him, how does he take his tea? (With milk, but is there sugar?) How does he sleep? (Not well. Could Sherlock fix that?) How hairy are his toes? (Need more data.) What does his semen taste like? (Design experiments around John’s diet.)
John was the most expressive man Sherlock had ever met. Sherlock never could read him properly because he had so many emotions at the same time and they all showed on his face. So he could be happy/sad (whenever Sherlock said he had a case and John was with Mary), angry/disappointed/frightened (that time Sherlock didn’t warn him he was keeping poisonous spiders in the medicine cabinet), happy/livid/disbelieving/hurt (when Sherlock had returned from the dead).
His chest tightened again and Sherlock was forced to admit his heart was throbbing. Juvenile, maudlin, impractical and just… stupid. He wasn’t in love with John, he couldn’t be, not yet. But with every second spent in his presence the possibility grew.
The texts blurred. John was torn between screaming and throwing the phone against the wall, and curling into a ball and dying with the device pressed against his chest.
It was a song John recognized but he didn’t know who wrote it. Sherlock wrote it and it seemed to John that it was about them. Their first case, the excitement, their second case, the danger, and on and on through all there cases, racing on and on to a crescendo. It changed in the middle. The melody wasn’t rich, the notes were high and it sounded lonely. John thought it might represent their time apart. When the notes dropped down the song was melancholy. John’s heart broke. The song took on the same tone that it had in the beginning but the notes were off. It wasn’t the same. Then the little flourishes disappeared and John imagined them as Rosie’s laughter. After a bit, it started to flow like it had at the beginning but this was richer and had more depth. It was them finally getting together.
The pressure increased and Sherlock gasped when John’s cockhead slid in. There was plenty of lube and Sherlock was used to the stretch-burn of being breached.
He needed his sub. He needed to make sure that John was ok, that he was safe. Why hadn’t he run when Sherlock told him to?
When Sherloc came to, the pod was surrounded by red dirt and cracked so the air it provided was escaping. They coughed and opened the door. But they couldn't breathe. They looked around their craft but there wasn't anything to help. Sherloc could see something moving and they tried to run to it, waving their hands to try to draw attention. Sherloc figured if they could catch the thing's attention it might be able to help.
John chuckled. Bill released Sherlock when Sherlock felt pubic hair tickle his arse. Sherlock raised his torso, resting on his elbows so he could watch John as he started thrusting.
John considered fighting the command, if he left he could give a good enough argument that he hadn’t been abandoned, but then the police might start searching for him and Christ, there was no winning. It wasn’t like he could trust any cab that pulled to the curb and he wasn’t sure where the nearest tube station was so if he could leave and contact the police to tell them where he was going he had no way of getting to his flat and his gun.
The police had been to the flat, Sherlock worked with them, he’d probably put away enough criminals to have enemies everywhere.
The door opened again and John’s tread was buoyant on the stairs. He was excited about something. Sherlock figured he was excited to get the cock cage off. After a week he must be frustrated, John usually masturbated once a day if he didn’t already have an orgasm that day. It was why Sherlock was so careful to make John come as often as he could. John needed sex.
John had been attentive recently. Almost needy. And he’d licked his lips when that new male crime scene tech bent over. Whatever compunctions he had regarding his “not gay” bisexuality he was getting over. Sherlock had even noticed a few of those looks directed his way.
John strode out of the cab as soon as it stopped. Sherlock could tell he was in pain, that he wanted to limp but that he was too proud to stop now. He stopped at the foot of the stairs. He’d allowed Sherlock to help him up the first time.
John gave a short nod and left before Sherlock could finish his question. Of course he wasn’t! How could he be? How could he share a bed with Sherlock, with anyone, when he had nightmares? It would be one thing if he didn’t lash out when he woke, but he did. If he hadn’t already hurt Sherlock—and John was fairly certain he had—he would eventually. It was inevitable.
Sherlock didn’t understand why John seemed surprised. He dismissed it, rapped on the separator and had John give his address.
John’s ring caught one of the lights in the lab and Sherlock had to wrap his fingers around the base of his cock in order to stave off his orgasm.
Sherlock nibbled along John’s neck, finding all his erogenous zones before picking them each, one by one, and sucking bruises into them.
It was bad enough that his profile was now in the government’s matching system. He’d been granted an out while he was in the military. Subs were owned by the military while they served and even though they weren’t (officially) sexually serviced the orders were enough to keep a sub both physically and mentally healthy.
Sherloc felt The Pull and ignored it. The Terran was obviously male, and clearly a born Terran, not one of their species in disguise. Even though they were intersex right now Sherlock was determined they were a male. Their One couldn't be another male, right? Besides, no one had ever had a One that wasn't their species. Sherloc pointedly ignored the fact that they'd already claimed the male Terran as their own and that the Terran had saved their life for no reason.
Sherlock always talked about keeping bees someday and Mrs Hudson had just had the roof reinforced. John had heard people talk about keeping bees on rooftops and if he could get Mrs Turner to go along with it perhaps he could get Sherlock the bees and could keep a garden for them himself. Then they wouldn’t swarm away and they could spend time together.
"Don't give me that heartless shit Mycroft. These people will send others to recover their countrymen."
John lowered himself and Sherlock’s eyes rolled back in his head when he felt himself breach John’s body. John groaned and Sherlock could feel his muscles ripple as John sank down. Then, before he knew it, John’s arse was resting on Sherlock’s hips.
Still only using his hold on Sherlock’s wrist John spun Sherlock back around. After planting a firm kiss on Sherlock’s lips John released him and started removing his own clothes, tripping on the way to their bedroom.
John searched the internet for William Holmes, William S. Holmes, William S. S. Holmes, and W. Holmes with no luck. It was like the man didn’t exist. Sure, there were a few William Holmes with social media accounts but their photos made it clear they all either already had subs collared or were subs themselves.
John’s legs started to fail so Sherlock planted his feet and held John’s hips to thrust into him. John looked relieved and rested back on Sherlock’s knees and thighs. Sherlock was close and based on John’s hand movements on his cock he was close too. Sherlock pounded into it, holding John’s hips so he hit John’s prostate head on. John wasn’t as sensitive as he was and enjoyed the rough treatment.
Their paddle had holes in it but was light. Sherlock had wanted the heavy one with holes but John had baulked, saying it would be too easy to hurt him.
“It really sold the relationship. I’m assuming you said we have separate rooms because we’re taking it slow?”
“John said for you to wait,” he said. When Sherlock tried to wriggle free James gripped him tighter and bit him again.
He rubbed his hands over his face. He knew that the government was supposed to take his preferences into account but they obviously hadn’t since they’d matched him with a man. Or, oh god, had he forgotten to update his profile from bisexual to heterosexual? John ground his teeth in anger.
He stole one of Sherlock’s poncy fluffy towels from his room and tried to shower quickly, he didn’t want to use more water than he needed. He had a feeling that Sherlock would have him in the shower again before the night was out.
Sherlock pulled the ring from his pocket with a bit of difficulty, he was kneeling on his wrong knee, and he opened it.
John’s head went back to the pillow without him opening his eyes and his breathing evened out. He started snoring lightly and Sherlock smiled.
It wasn’t right to leave a sub to their own devices for too long. It was like leaving a Dom with no one to order about, they’d go stir crazy. Subs needed orders to follow to feel useful. Some needed more orders than others. And if there was no one about to give orders the sub might follow orders from anyone, do anything, just to satisfy that need.
“Well, sexy army doctor, if you’re going to live here then you should know there’s only one bedroom.”
Sherlock took John’s hand and had him step into the tub and lower himself into the water. He folded a washcloth and set it behind John’s head. Then he took out a lighter and lit the candles.
John came home, expecting to find Sherlock irritated and wound up. Sherlock hated to be told no. John guessed it was the reason Sherlock wanted to have sex during the case to begin with because he wasn’t allowed to while they were taking antibiotics. John also knew that Sherlock was clever and that he’d never keep him in line without some help.
The vibrations made John harder, a feat that he hadn’t thought possible. He lost control and thrust forward, his hand around the back of Sherlock’s head.
John picked up his cane (proof that he needed a Dom in his life, according to his therapist, since there was nothing physically wrong with his leg). And went to go check his mail.
“Yessssss,” Sherlock groaned. His testicles felt full and he could feel himself drip precome onto the bedsheets.
John checked the couch first, wondering if Sherlock had fallen asleep in the middle of his sulk, but he wasn’t there.
“No, we’re done with foreplay,” John said. He didn’t want to injure Sherlock. He said he could hold still but he squirmed all over the place. John was determined not to hurt him, especially his manhood.
Well, their first date had been Chinese after the case but John didn’t count it. He might have counted the first time they went to Angelo’s but Sherlock didn’t, they were on a case.
With a shake of his head, Sherlock said, “No you didn’t. I’m rather proud of myself and I don’t want you ruining it.”
Sherlock gripped John’s hips tighter. He felt warm, his hands slid with the sweat from both his and John’s bodies. He dug his nails in.
“Sorry, sorry, he’s just so tight,” James said. Sherlock could feel James’ legs quake with the effort of not thrusting.
John looked up, kissing Sherlock sweetly before standing and walking weak-kneed back into the bathroom.
Sherlock rucked John’s shirt up, his hand sliding up John’s ribs. John broke the kiss to pant into Sherlock’s neck, nibbling and kissing and forcing Sherlock’s hand out from under his shirt and onto his groin.
“The blog draft. He’d written it up so you wouldn’t have to. I thought you’d seen it when you wrote that idiotic notice that you wouldn’t be updating. I agreed that publishing my brother’s post was in bad taste. Still, my brother really deserved more, I thought.”
With a noise of displeasure, Sherlock brought his arm back to John’s chest, tightening his grip and pressing his whole body against John’s briefly. Just long enough to make it clear that John wasn’t to go anywhere.
John didn't have any. O'Murtagh had them in a standoff. John would probably survive longer than Sherlock since he had a heater in his suit but eventually the oxygen in his suit would be used up. The craft had limited oxygen reserves and John didn't know how much had already been used. They couldn't afford for O'Murtagh to open that airlock. It was possible the other airlock was closed, that this was a bluff, but the second door was more likely damaged.
Sherlock put on a blue scarf and a long wool coat. “We’ll meet there tomorrow evening, seven o’clock. Sorry, got to dash. I think I left my riding crop in the mortuary.”
John barely heard the official’s words. Thank god he had practised or he wouldn’t have known what to say.
Sherlock recoiled as if he’d been slapped. “You’re not going to stop this? I’ve been matched. Can’t you tell them I’ve already collared a sub or that I’m unsuitable?”
John shifted, nudging Sherlock so he could sit on the mattress and see the screen. He took Sherlock’s lube and with a tongue peeking out from between his lips he worked himself.
John sucked in a breath when he saw that familiar little speck in Sherlock’s iris. He couldn’t look away. Sherlock didn’t break the gaze until John blinked.
They manoeuvred around on the bed so Sherlock was on his back with John, condom on, ready between his legs.
John nodded his thanks and picked up a pen. On the papers, he wrote that Sherlock and he were living in separate rooms because they were taking things slow. That Lestrade and Donovan were picking on them. That he’d repeatedly had to defend his relationship with no evidence against it. That he was being coerced into writing this statement.
“Mycroft!” John shouted as the man slid out the door. The noise did nothing to stop Mycroft but did wake his daughter.
John figured this would end with Sherlock fucking him. He wasn’t opposed to the idea. He’d been with men before and although he personally preferred to top being a bottom was very enjoyable when done right. And he had no doubts that Sherlock would do him right.
John pushed against the crowd of people, trying to get through. “He’s my friend,” John said, even though it was nonsense. It wasn’t relevant, it wouldn’t convince them to let him through. It mattered, though. It was important. They wouldn’t understand. They were idiots. They wouldn’t let him through and he needed—
Mycroft had said Terrans breathed oxygen, not carbon dioxide, and that's why he needed a special suit. Their home planet had roughly the same percentage of oxygen as Terra. Though, he thought there was something else about the air too… Wasn’t there?
The scheduler at the front desk gave a long pause before responding but confirmed his instructions and began relaying instructions for people to evacuate the building before calling the police. He could hear the nurses and other doctors began the process of helping to usher people swiftly out of the building while he leaned over so as to get a second look and the amount of time on it.
James’s hands clenched around Sherlock’s hips and with a moan he was gently thrusting. The soldiers worked together so Sherlock was shifting back and forth between them. Sherlock tried to angle his hips so James would hit his prostate and it threw everything off. Soon John had both his hands in Sherlock’s hair, cradling his head so Sherlock didn’t move off his cock entirely or go too deep. James was petting Sherlock’s flank with one hand and the other moved down to Sherlock’s cock. The lube on his hand was tacky and his grip was loose, so it didn’t do much but tease.
But, he’d been abandoned. And a couple bouts of lovemaking and a day of commands wasn’t going to fix that. It might take months for John to fully recover. John felt sick. He should have run when Sherlock commanded him. But, he’d ignored the order. Since he’d dismissed it he didn’t even have the help of a conflicting order.
“No,” Sherlock interrupted and moved away. “I’m fine. I’m sure you have duties to be getting back to.”
“You alright over there?” John asked. There was a fair bit of concern in his voice and Sherlock reached up to briefly run a hand through his hair in an effort to dislodge the thoughts currently running through his brain.
John rubbed his eyes with one of his hands and nodded. “Yeah, I know...we should get going, if we wanna make it on time.”
“You and Lestrade both told me to behave,” Sherlock answered as he finished buttoning up his shirt. “What was I supposed to do? Say no? She cornered me just as I’d come out of the loo.”
John sniffed. “Well then stop being nice…be an arse. Be rude and inconsiderate and a prick and...and…”
He hauled himself to his feet and started looking for the still ringing device. He got closer to John’s coat and looked through both pockets until he got the phone and pulled it out. He recognized the number of the surgery and went upstairs.
“Just barely, but I’ll accept it,” Sherlock agreed. “Anyone else? If anyone bothered to check your student emails, you would know I sent out a list of Philosophers for this class.”
“As I was saying before we can begin to look at the present, we must go back and look at the past. The birth of the Human Conscious,” Sherlock continued. “To do so, we will start by answering a few of the W’s. The Who’s, the What’s, and the Why’s.”
“No, Sherlock I’m not worried about that,” John answered. “Just,” he cleared his throat, “you’ve put a lot of thought into...all of this.”
“Why don’t you go start and I’ll join in a moment. I’ve got to at least change the sheets,” Sherlock told him.
“Because that’s what normal people do,” he answered. Another amused smile crossed his face. He stepped closer and wrapped his arms around Sherlock’s neck, his fingers periodically brushed the nape of his neck. “You don’t get out much do you?”
John started to smile, but it fell short as his phone buzzed into his pocket again. He hugged himself in an effort to stem off another panic attack.
Sherlock watched the muscles in his stomach tense a little and tried to imagine what’d it could look like in a few months time when the skin was pulled taut and swelled. He looked up to study the man’s face. His tongue stuck out slightly as he balanced on the bed with his left hand while the right tried to keep the bottle from falling to the floor.
“John...phone,” Sherlock mumbled into the couch cushion. He used another to cover his head as it continued to ring.
John smiled and kissed his cheek as Mrs. Holmes walked back into the living room with a tray of tea. Sherlock quickly stood and took the tray setting it on the coffee table between them.
“You didn’t want to start your career with a job you were handed rather than worked toward yourself,” Mycroft answered. “Appealed to your humanity so to speak.”
“There are his fingers, and his toes...and Sherlock?” John reached up and cupped Sherlock’s cheek. “Love what’s wrong?”
“Don’t play coy,” Sherlock answered he leaned back on the couch. He started to unwrap the sandwich. “If I recall, I proved just how much I like your ass.”
Sherlock withdrew his hand and let his fingers trail up John’s back as his cell phone began to chime on the bedside table.
“But why name him?” Sherlock answered. “Out of all the easy ones:  Plato, Aristotle, Confucius, Socrates, Voltaire...and yet you chose John Locke. I’m merely curious as to why.”
“Turkey, and stuffing, perhaps some of the vegetables...your turkey always comes out better…” Sherlock answered. “And the decorating no doubt.”
“Oh yes, I really enjoyed reading about the case with the serial killer who based each murder off of a classical literature death,” she answered.
Sherlock let the name roll off his tongue. “Would you like to come back to my place, John? I promise I’ve got better music.”
“I prefer to give them,” Sherlock winked as he drank some of his wine. “So, you have a sister correct?”
Brushing against Sherlock’s nipple again, just the lightest touch, John danced the feather over the pink nub until it pebbled. Sherlock shook, panted, bit his lip and only just managed to hold still.
Yeah, I messed up. 1000 words into the chapter I realized it was supposed to be from John’s POV but I’m not rewriting at this stage so sorry, if I decide to go back and edit I’ll do it over. :P
And, oh, that was interesting. They were meeting up here, on the edge of the base. There was no logical reason for anyone to be here, far away from the entrances next to tents that held nothing of importance unless there was an attack.
John sipped tea and tried to empty his mind. He thought he heard the bathtub running but he figured it was just Sherlock washing the riding crop. He’d hurt and abused Sherlock during their relationship. He knew Sherlock forgave him, everyone forgave him but himself.
“If you wanted to do sex-periments you could find someone off the street. You could have told me going into this. You could have not lied to me!”
“A bit different from my day,” John said to hide his discomfort at meeting the potential flatmate. The man was wearing a suit in a lab! He was absurd. It reminded John of Sherlock… the idiot had worn a suit to Afghanistan.
from cases.” The way he said souvenirs made it clear he knew, at the very least, about the ashtray theft.
John was feeling warm and satisfied. He’d done well if he did say so himself. Sherlock was gliding along, but it was clear his legs were weak. A good orgasm would do that to a person.
John stopped reading. It was pointless. His Dom clearly hadn’t taken this seriously. No Dom in their right mind would consider letting their sub choke them. It just wasn’t done. And everything on the page and—John checked—the following pages had t’s next to them. It wasn’t like the man was a virgin. He
John turned and walked around Sherlock, ignoring Sherlock trying to shy away. Yes, the tail was attached to a butt plug.
“Do something,” Sherlock demanded. He wouldn’t beg. He tried to think of something he could say that would convince his brother, but nothing came to mind.
People were surrounding John again, holding him as he sunk to his knees. He was too late, Sherlock was dead. If he had been smarter, faster, better, maybe he would have been able to do something. Now all he had was a phone call. He’d spoken to Sherlock. He’d had a chance. But he was too slow, too stupid. He didn’t know how to talk his friend off the ledge and now Sherlock had sunk into the mud completely, a black slab of rock marking the grave. Not white, not grey, black. Because he’d died a pariah, a monster to the public, even though the real monsters sat at desks, writing headlines and collecting paycheques.
John looped the scarf over the hook and pulled, indicating that Sherlock needed to scoot up the bed. Sherlock did and John tied his other wrist. When he was done, he checked to make sure the knots weren’t resting anywhere they’d do damage and that the bonds weren’t too tight.
“Yes,” Sherlock said. He didn’t know if John was talking about what was happening in the video or if he was talking about his cock. It didn’t matter either way.
It was a hard strike and Sherlock cried out as his erection was crushed beneath him. The only reason it hadn’t flagged was due to the ring. “Five,” Sherlock sobbed and realized he was crying.
This wasn’t a one night stand kiss; this was something more, it had morphed into something deeper. Sherlock gasped, he couldn’t stop. He needed John. John was thrusting into him without breaking the kiss. Sherlock let his legs fall and wrapped them around John’s hips. John pulled away and they stared at each other, the only sounds their mingled breaths.
John might have laughed if the sight of Sherlock so dishevelled holding his hard leaking cock wasn’t so bloody hot.
He seemed embarrassed and Sherlock wondered how John would feel if he knew that Sherlock knew he’d been aroused.
He felt James’s hands on his hips and when the first dollop of lube (cold, despite the Afghanistan heat) hit him and was worked in, he relaxed and focused on John.
Sherlock hissed. It felt good, but it was too much. He needed lube if this was going to continue as long as he wanted it to.
John carded his fingers through Sherlock’s hair marvelling at its softness and the fact that he could do that now.
It was. It was starting to fill out in Sherlock’s hand, making the rod look all the more impressive.
Sherlock shook his head, that was nonsense. He knew John felt the same. And perhaps he was moving too fast but he didn’t really care. He’d waited far too long already.
When he hung up he was furious with himself. He was mad at Mary too but he was mostly angry with himself. He’d forgone condoms for oral sex despite knowing the risks. Chlamydia could be spread through oral sex. It was possible he’d infected Sherlock.
The door swung open and there was Sherlock, button-down shirt wrinkled, trousers and pants shoved halfway down his thighs.
Dropping the document, John rummaged through the box until he found Sherlock’s phone. The damned thing had to charge, of course, and John looked between the phone and the pile of letters, trying to decide if he wanted to wait for his answer.
. I changed things as per the suggestions and didn't have another go through so any mistakes are my own.
"You saved my life," they stated. They were quite a bit taller than John and John had to crane his neck when they stood this close. "Why?" They demanded while staring into John's eyes.
He shooed the boring man from the flat and went to the bedroom. He locked the door behind him and turned to see the door to the bedroom closed.
He wiggled back, trying to get his legs under him so he could kneel up and talk face to face about what to do next when he heard John’s giggle.
Sherlock leaned forward and John did too. Their lips met and John melted. Sherlock pulled back, biting his lip and searching John’s face.
When Sherlock pressed the frozen peas to John’s crotch he yelped and tried to get away. Sherlock reached out and held him in place by his hip, pushing him into the mattress. He held the peas there until his hand hurt.
The movement wasn’t much but Sherlock pulled back instinctively. He slid down an inch onto James’s cock.
Sherlock pulled the sheet over them and wrapped his arms around John. He snuck his leg between John’s before going to sleep himself.
Their lips touched once, a chaste peck. Then Sherlock pulled John down again, and again, and then held John, a large hand wrapped around John’s neck, long fingers buried in John’s hair, for a filthy kiss. Their tongues slid together. John cradled Sherlock’s face in his hands, running his thumb across Sherlock’s cheekbone.
Sherlock sank to his knees. He licked the fluid before taking the head of John’s cock into his mouth and sucking the fluid from it.
“Oh, no, and there’s only one bed? Whatever shall we do?” John asked. He wasn’t even going to pretend he was going to sleep on the floor.
“Because it was a date,” John said. He was nervous. He wanted this. He’d wanted it for a very long time.
“Yes. I should do that now,” Sherlock said and sat up. His shoulders ached and he thought he had bruises on top of bruises.
Sherlock perked up. He wondered what sort of hives would be good for the roof and what flowers would make enough food with just two roofs to work from.
John wanted to argue, to interject, to say something, but he had thought a lot about his and Sherlock’s relationship while Sherlock was gone. After the funeral he couldn’t stop thinking about it. He had gone to countless jewellers, trying to find the perfect ring. He hadn’t managed to, though. He’d written a million speeches but discarded each one. Nothing about any of it was right. At this rate he’d decided he would just blurt out, “Will you marry me?” as soon as he saw Sherlock.
But was it too soon? Would it remind John of Mary, bring back the heartache of losing little Rosie? Would John want to propose? What if he didn’t feel the same way?
“Fuck!” John’s cock hardened and he pushed Sherlock’s head down, thrusting into his mouth as he orgasmed.
John stood then, throwing Sherlock’s feet off him and the couch onto the floor. He mumbled something about tea and went into the loo.
He came home feeling much happier and more festive than when he left. Since John was off being fired Sherlock enlisted Mrs Hudson’s help in decorating the flat. He’d even hung mistletoe.
The next paper was from the hospital, the date from when Sherlock had been shot. John flipped over to the bloodwork. The STIs had cleared up but drugs were present.
John let go of his hair and Sherlock leaned forward again. Sherlock felt his arousal ratchet up. This was the situation he’d imagined, being walked in on while being fucked. He pressed his cheek against the cot and watched John march over to the new man. Sherlock rolled his hips as John whispered to this soldier. James grunted, his hand moving over the small of Sherlock’s back. Sherlock rolled his hips again and James’s hand flexed before he gave in and started thrusting again.
Once the Dom was back in his chair she had him pull out the pamphlet on sub drop and covered the most common ways to prevent it and what to do if it happened. She did this to let John have some time to himself, so he’d recover and wouldn’t feel the pressure of both of them watching him.
His legs ached but he didn’t want to get filth on them so he didn’t want to sit. They were four days into the case and John was exhausted.
As he said the words one of Sherlock’s legs fell to the side and John hit Sherlock’s prostate head on.
And now John had taken care of himself in the shower after giving Sherlock such an orgasm that he still felt a bit boneless.
“You just made me come in my pants,” John said. “That was ridiculous. That was… That was bloody amazing is what that was.”
“Oh, oh! Oh— Nnguh!” John said, panting now, trying to resist burying his hands in Sherlock’s hair and thrusting until he came down that long, elegant, pale, fucking impossible throat. He kept his eyes wide open even when Sherlock closed his and moaned around John’s cock.
He barely knew the man but he was drawn to him, every deduction made him more alluring. He could see himself falling in love with John. He should be pushing the sub away, he didn’t want that. Love can be a vicious motivator and it made people do irrational things. Never mind that loved ones always became targets. If he truly cared about John he’d keep him at arms distance.
