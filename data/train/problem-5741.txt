Steve stared at himself a little longer before reaching for his workbag which was sitting on top of the sink. He rummaged around until he found the old chip with the failsafe codes to the Synergy device.
“You’re going to scratch up my car inching back and forth like this.” Tony sighed just as loudly as Peter had done as he leaned up against the window. His body jerked with the movement of the car.
Natasha and Clint were dancing down below the balcony with the rest of the couples. Natasha discretely tapped on her earpiece.
“…I’m so sorry, Steve…” Tony whispered. The memory of seeing Steve lying in the middle of the lab after the explosion made Tony cry again as he leaned forward, nearly choking from how upset he had become.
Ned patted Peter on the shoulder as they gazed upward at the construction going on the school’s new gym. The building was nearly finished, which was good considering that it would be finished for state-wide science competition, but it was also marked by the three rather large and galling words: “Stark Athletic Center”.
Tony quickly glanced at him as they made their way toward the express elevator. “I wouldn’t let you near my lab if I thought you weren’t capable. Where’s all that military confidence?”
Steve nodded as he let Tony kiss him. “I love you too, Tony.” They stayed like that for some time before Tony broke away from Steve.
“First, we’ll have Barton and Romanov simulate locating the equations.” Fury pointed to Clint and Natasha. Clint waved as Natasha nodded sternly.
Both men stared at each other, ignoring everyone else around them. After another second, Steve shook his head to snap out of his daze. He pointed back toward his office.
Steve chuckled as he leaned away from Tony to look down at him slightly. “Sorry. Thought I would be able to settle more in the background tonight and you would be doing all the talking.”
Tony wished, as he followed the escort, he had a minute or two to get his wits about him; something about Steve being all over him just now coupled with not having discussed the kiss after Thor’s party made him feel uneasy again. He managed to regroup quickly in time before approaching the door to the billiard room, but the sinking feeling from trying to figure out Steve was beginning to overrun his composure.
Steve cleared his throat as he attempted to shift the direction of the conversation. “So, what else can you tell me about this?” He pointed to the image as he joined Tony side by side. Steve could tell that the redirection in the conversation had been greatly appreciated; Tony’s tone returned to be being annoyingly lighthearted.
Fury nodded sternly before motioning for his agents to file out. Tony turned to Bruce and Shuri. “Banner and Shuri, I need you with me at Stark Enterprises. We’ll get the device up and running as the rest of you grab your safety suits and head out to the island with Fury’s agents.”
Rhodey nodded back before closing the door. Tony sat up in his chair with his elbow rested on the desk, chin perched on top, pouting again. He pulled out his phone, tapped and swiped a few times until he found the photo he had taken of himself and Steve at the graduation, staring at it longingly for the hundredth time. He sighed heavily.
Steve nodded, walking up to Tony to kiss him before leaving the lab. “We’ll see you later, okay?” He smiled as he left, waving at Tony from the corridor.
Tony squinted his eyes again as he kept up the charade. “Yes, of course. Absolutely no mercy, whatsoever.” He then clenched a fist in faux rage.
Steve smiled to himself—just another innocent opportunity to get to know your lab mate better, right?—before following the rest of his team down the hallway.
Shuri chuckled. “Eh, I’ve been here so many times, but I think everyone is having a nice time.” She looked at Tony before looking at Steve, both mumbling about how nice the resort was.
Steve smiled back, retaining a tender expression. To him, Tony no longer appeared upset about the kiss, yet Steve remained wary; he told himself to wait for Tony to continue.
Tony stared up at the ceiling, instantly remembering that Steve was referring to the first time they went out to dinner together.
Steve nodded as he rubbed Tony’s back although Tony couldn’t see him. “I can call May for you…” He looked behind himself at a clock on of the tables next to the bed; it was four in the morning.
Sam and Bucky began debating with each other over which place they should have lunch. Steve stopped Tony by gently placing a hand on his shoulder.
Steve took a deep breath as he nodded back. He took his time sitting next to Tony on the bed. “I know, Tony. You told me…” He hesitated before reaching out an arm to hold Tony around the shoulders. Tony was now breathing more steadily.
Steve approached the shower, knocking on the glass sliding door. The humming stopped as Tony turned to slide open the door. He was smiling widely at Steve with soap already in his hair.
Tony watched Strange leave before facing Steve again. “Uh, do you have your phone, Steve? I want to call Peter to let him know I’m okay.”
Tony chuckled as he threw his hands up in surrender. “Okay, okay, just making sure we’re not stepping on any toes…”
Gamora shrug. “Maybe…but do we really want to take that chance? It may help father build the weapon he wants.”
“Our world is becoming more unmanageable and destructive by the minute. No longer can we rely on traditional methods to protect and sustain ourselves and our fellow people. This calls for alternative means.”
“Cap!” Bucky ran up to Steve and Tony as they approached one of the main areas, “there you are. Sam wants us to meet a few people before the rehearsal dinner.” He tugged on Steve’s arm.
Steve expressed his most genuine appreciation as he accepted the sheet. He kissed Tony before holding the sheet out to look at it from a better angle.
Tony nodded back, swallowing a lump in his throat as he let Steve take a hold of his waist as he pulled in him close. Steve closed his eyes and leaned downward somewhat, kissing Tony as he moved one hand to caress his cheek. They kissed each other for some time; and the urge to confess to Steve that he loved him reared its annoying head once more.
Tony chuckled before walking to the other side of the lab. He pressed a button on a panel below a console to reveal the chip embedded with the failsafe codes to the Synergy device. He typed in a code before retrieving the chip from the panel. He then turned around with the chip to show to Riri.
Fury sighed, facing the group before motioning toward Agent Hill. She nodded back before briskly leaving the helm.
“…my parents were pissed, obviously…they wanted to spend the night here before going back…” Tony stood up to walk over to the record player.
Whoberis stared Tony down with the most unsettling expression before looking downward to swipe through more data on her tablet.
Fury rose the table. “We need to prep a bit for the board meeting. Stane?” He motioned for Obadiah to follow him out of the room, and Fury winked at Tony as they exited.
“I don’t think we should see each other anymore.” Tony repeated. This time without opening his eyes, he turned his head away from Steve, holding his hand even tighter.
Tony pointed toward Steve. “I wanted to give you something nice and maybe embarrass you a little in front of your friends.” He winked before sauntering over to the grand piano, making a show of it as he settled in.
“To solve this crisis, Stark Industries is teaming up with the Strategic Homeland Intervention Enforcement and Logistics Division, or S.H.I.E.L.D. for short, to—”
“Was it really out of our control, Steve?” Tony stopped pacing, throwing his hands in the air in frustration, “from the very fucking beginning, every single precaution we’ve taken just made Synergy even more dangerous.”
But before Tony could figure out how to explain himself, Steve gave him an out as he wrapped his hands around Tony’s.
“Banner, we’re inside. I think it’ll be best for the rest of the team to stay put outside while Rogers and I get these specs. We’ll send them to you and Thor then switch places…no telling how sensitive this thing is…” Tony whispered as he motioned for Steve to wait for him to clear the area before they entered the basement.
“Sign in.” The security guard at the desk used her pen to point toward a sign-in sheet on the counter.
Tony was talking to himself as he paced back and forth in front of the bed, eyes focused on the ceiling. He eventually stopped with his back facing Steve who was a hot mess on the bed.
The longer they stood next to the device, the more nervous Obadiah became, but he wasn’t entirely sure what Thanos was trying to achieve. They had what they wanted; making the device bigger would only destroy everything around it, and not replicate weaponry like Obadiah had originally envisioned.
the worst thing I’ve been caught doing.” Tony smirked at Steve; his hair tousled in such a way that made Steve stare at him dumfounded.
Tony nodded back slowly as he withdrew his hand. Steve had trouble trying to figure out why Tony was still acting strange from last night.
Gamora looked down at the tablet before look back up at her sister, her expression becoming enraged.
Steve gawked at Bucky which prompted him to laugh uncontrollably again. He then patted Steve on the shoulder.
“Jesus, Sam. Let me buy you a drink.” Bucky looped an arm around Sam’s shoulder as he pulled him over to the counter.
“Yeah, I did, but I’m not going. Nothing exciting ever happens at those things.” Tony turned to pick up a tablet from the console.
Steve slid one hand down Tony’s neck, rubbing it before moving it further down his body while keeping the other on Tony’s cheek. Tony leaned in, rubbing Steve’s backside with both hands. Steve turned them around before laying Tony on top of the bed. Tony scooted up the bed as Steve met him, they resumed kissing as Tony spread his legs while the top half of his body was propped against the headboard. Steve pushed his body down in Tony between his legs as Tony hugged him against his body.
“…he’ll make a full recovery. I’ve never seen anything like it…” Strange scratched his chin, clearly thinking deeply, “…those heat resistant panels absorbed most of the blast...still...its depth and size would have killed almost anyone else…”
Silence hung once more in the air as unmistakable tension resurfaced between the two. Tony watched Steve mentally battle with himself before coming up with a good excuse. He sighed before taking a breath.
Tony barely nodded back, that sinking feeling forming in the pit of his stomach as he began over speculating what Steve might be referring to at such an inopportune time.
Sam smiled. “I know this sounds contrived, but this will work itself out. You and Tony are great together. Right, Buck?” He glanced over at Bucky who looked unamused.
After speaking with Natasha, Tony had everyone meet him in the conference room while Natasha had gone back to S.H.I.E.L.D. to question Dr. Selvig, and Pepper had proceeded to go about normal company business in order not to alarm the rest of the company about Dr. Selvig’s arrest.
Tony pretended to study the files as he continued to think about Steve. Although he wasn’t in the position to be dating, especially someone who was twelve years his junior, having someone around like Steve in his lab would be a nice change of pace and scenery. Yeah, maybe constantly staring at someone as beautiful as Steve Rogers would brighten up his day just a little more.
“…I snooped through Loki’s personnel file in Obadiah’s office when he was out…” She added before groaning.
Steve blushed as he accepted a tissue from Tony, wiping himself off before zipping his suit up. He looked up at Tony, seeing that the latter had been watching him while he cleaned himself off.
“Nice to finally meet you too, Mr. Stark.” Bucky greeted with a slight edge in his voice that was not lost on Tony.
“…Loki finally confessed that he planted an explosive at the police precinct while Selvig damaged the Synergy device…the traces of that explosive matched the chemical traces we found at Thanos’s lab…and from there, we made some more connections…”
“I, uh, don’t think I ever really apologized to you about that, Rogers…” Tony looked away before looking back at Steve, “I’m sorry for being such an asshole…”
Tony clapped his hands together, trying desperately to change the tone in conversation. “Okay, I’m going to see what more I can find out about these buyers.” He pulled out another tablet from his bag and handed it to Steve. “Why don’t you look through the building plans at the event, so we know our way around before we get there.”
Sam leaned up against another counter. “Jesus, that’s rough. He seems like he’s not worried though.”
“Wh—aaaa—t—mmmm—” But before the robot could continue, it started jerking around, spinning around away from Steve.
"No worries, Virginia. It appears that my assistant mixed up the times." He walked back to his chair as Tony tried to settle in his.
Steve nodded slowly. He leaned up against the back of the bed, clearly trying to remember what happened.
“…I am so embarrassed…” Steve let out as Tony removed his towel before slipping underneath sheets completely naked.
Everyone shuffled around to find their lab buddy. Bruce clapped a hand onto Steve’s shoulder as he started asking him questions about any lab experience he might have had in the past. Steve did his best to answer, but besides not having any lab experience, he was still a tad overwhelmed by the magnitude of Synergy.
Steve nodded a few times, trying to force down a lump in his throat as he attempted to read through Bruce’s notes on his tablet.
Tony sighed as he tried to mentally craft his next sentence. “I ran into an ex at the event…actually that guy I told you about…”
Tony perked up. He sat up straight, watching Steve before answering. “Rogers. I said it was fine.” He answered in a harsh tone which caused Steve to recoil somewhat.
A moment or so passed as Tony stared at him. Steve stared back, too petrified to explain himself. Then, Tony suddenly cracked the most unnerving smile Steve had ever witnessed. He watched Tony saunter over toward the bedroom window.
“Why did I come with you to the store if you’re just going to be all weird and secretive?” Bucky joked.
As they sat in silence, Tony replayed the last few interactions he had with Steve since they started spending more time together. Something about Steve willing to start over and the revelation that maybe he wasn’t as serious with Sharon led Tony to believe that maybe he could jumpstart his romantic relationship with Steve again. Or at least find some sort of relief in a very emotionally charged moment he hadn’t felt since the first time they kissed.
“Tony…I hope this doesn’t ruin our working relationship…” Steve managed to get out; he genuinely sounded concerned.
Steve was holding solidly in position, but his face was telling a different story as Tony finally looked at him. He had never seen Steve this upset before.
“Really? That would be awesome.” From the sound of Sam’s voice, Steve could tell that his friend was trying to appear cool as much as possible, but his eagerness was still recognizable.
And despite how serious the situation indeed was, everyone else took a moment before nodding or making small sounds of agreement with Clint’s statement as Natasha maneuvered the helicopter away from the island again.
“…I used to mess around with this guy in my twenties and early thirties, but stopped it long before I started dating Pepper, actually…” Tony turned to face Steve, “I feel like I really made a change after I started seeing her…”
Tony stared intently at Steve who was now leaning against the counter. “Tony, you not only figured out how to get Synergy to work, so I have no doubt you’ll figure out how to keep the team safe.”
“I…uh…I’m going to get some work done in here for most of the day before going to a meeting.” He awkwardly tried. He was doing his best again to mask an eventual panic attack.
Tony groaned as he leaned forward in the chair to place his head into his hands. “That’s the understatement of the fucking century…but miraculously, he’s on board despite my best efforts in pushing away one of the only good things to happen to me in a while…”
Steve sighed, shaking his head "no", as he held Loki down for Thor to tie up. Thor then slammed the door, before angrily getting into the driver’s seat. Steve slid into the passenger seat, trying to avoid Loki who was bouncing around in the backseat attempting to free himself from the cables.
“You know, that makes the most sense. I don’t know why I didn’t see it before…” Bruce removed his eyeglasses to peer downward at the device, transfixed by Shuri’s solution.
Tony inhaled and then exhaled deeply as he sat down next to Steve’s bed. He set his work bag down on the ground before taking Steve’s hand.
Clint shrugged. “Nat, I know you don’t want to hear this, but you’re probably going to have to make the first move.” Although his statement was earnest, his voice shook from fatigue.
Tony waited before continuing. “…I also brought some snacks…but those are for me, obviously…” He choked back another sob, “…you know how I like to graze…” he attempted to joke, rubbing Steve’s leg more vigorously.
“The great thing about these uniforms is that I can wire J.A.R.V.I.S. to them. So, you have all the essentials: GPS tracker, hardware and software specs, etc. Also, the suits play music. Can’t possible do Synergy work without great bops, am I right?”
Meanwhile, Tony was standing near Rhodey, but he was close enough to Bruce and Natasha who were standing not too far away by themselves.
“You know, I would not be surprised if you get hit on by one of your teammates. If that happens, your head will explode.” Bucky grinned.
“Oh my god, Steve…I think I’m close…” Tony murmured, pulling the hand Steve hand on his body tight with each gasp.
“Hey, Rogers.” Tony greeted with a smile as he waited for Peter to get out of the way so he could also greet Steve.
“Well, I’ve always been a sprinter.” Steve answered in a deadpan sort of way. Tony only huffed as he tried to get ahead of him before they walked into his lab.
T’Challa let out another jolly laugh before patting Tony on the shoulder. “Of course!” He then turned to a degree as his voice lowered, “my sister informed me about the work you all are wanting to do with Synergy while here at the resort…”
Steve stopped to address Tony, turning slightly. “Uh, yeah, sure. That sounds great.” He watched Tony give him a thumbs up before he quickly walked out of the space to head toward the restroom.
“Thanks, Tony.” He ran a hand through his hair, but immediately clammed up as Tony continued to watch him.
As was mentioned before, it had been a while since Steve had been in a relationship or gone out on a date. However, he found himself easily flirting back with Tony whenever prompted—if that was what his lab partner was doing, of course. Again, Steve couldn’t be entirely sure; Tony acted like this with everyone else.
“So, what do you have for us, Fury?” Bruce had taken his eyeglasses off to rub the bridge of his nose. Steve had never seen him so agitated before.
Tony finished tucking Peter’s blanket underneath him. “What’s up? And keep in mind that you only have a few minutes left until official bedtime.” He said through a grin.
Tony was out on the balcony of his penthouse with Bruce. Peter was staying over at May’s for the weekend and Tony needed someone to distract him from not obsessing over Steve. Neither one had made a move to reach out to the other since the blow up in the conference room.
Without more comment, Tony coughed again as he got up to walk back to the kitchen to look through more boxes. They remained silent for some time until Steve found another box with a diary hidden underneath a mound of papers.
Despite the new revelations concerning Dr. Selvig’s arrest, per Tony’s requests, everyone went about their normal tasks as usual, including attending the board event scheduled that weekend. However, everyone was still anxious about the stability of the project and whether they would be able to find Loki before an event similar to the precinct explosion unfortunately reoccurred.
“No, Tony. I screwed up,” Steve’s tone turned serious again, “I was so concerned about trying to help you that I didn’t think to consider how you might react…I don’t know if you’ve noticed this about me, but I have a tendency to want to ‘rescue’, I guess, the people I care about…I know it’s annoying…Bucky tells me about it all the time.” He laughed louder this time, which Tony appreciated.
Bruce groaned as he watched Tony calmly walk over to the other side of the room to retrieve his phone.
Steve handed Tony a pair of sunglasses he had produced from his work bag. Tony hesitated before accepting the glasses. He thought he had left them at the restaurant but had been too lazy to retrieve them. Besides, they weren’t the only pair he owned.
May nodded, conveying that she knew what Tony was referring to. “Really? That hasn’t happened in a while…”
He turned around with the glass and the bottle, sitting back down at the island. He tried to focus on relaxing but his mind drifted back to his dad’s diary. He poured another drink before rising from his stool, carrying the bottle and the glass to his office.
Steve sighed; he wasn’t sure if he should tell Tony that he had read the diary and he was beginning to feel guilty about keeping it instead of throwing it away.
Steve corrected himself as he watched Tony walk to the front of the conference room to address everyone.
Tony lingered before stepping to the side to let Thor into the room. Thor stopped at the threshold of the door before walking up to Loki who recoiled in his chair as his brother approached. Thor shook his head before standing on the other side of the room.
Steve tilted his head up and away from Tony. He couldn’t help himself from expressing how confused and a little embarrassed he was by the question.
Tony and Steve had a good rhythm going until some of the figures appeared miscalculated. Steve could only tell because the device’s usual exciting color glowed strangely, shaking uncontrollably with each input. He had encountered this as a possibility in the algorithm and knew that if he kept entering in incorrect information it might jam up the device.
Steve nodded once more, but didn’t respond verbally. Tony noticed that he was mostly talking to himself as he turned slightly to acknowledge Steve.
Obadiah leaned forward in his chair. “However, I think an open contract route for the remnants of Synergy’s hardware and software rather than foisting this thing on the government will more than salvage the project…” he looked upward directly at Tony.
Steve nodded. He could hear Tony through his headset, but most of his attention had been captured by the helicopter leaving the tower. He had seen New York from an airplane, of course, but it was nothing like seeing it from this vantage point, in a helicopter, and with Tony Stark.
a spy thriller. People’s lives are on the line and someone is trying to take away all of the good work this team has done so far.”
Peter squealed with delight as Tony carried him to the stove. Steve laughed as he stayed near the island in the middle of the kitchen.
“Also, there’s enough here for Tony to join us…that’s if he doesn’t need to leave so soon!” The tone in Sam’s voice must had made Steve blush the reddest color because Tony started laughing hysterically.
Tony sighed. He looked away from his friend, trying to find something interesting to rest his eyes on; he wasn’t sure if he should tell Rhodey about last night. However, after letting out one more sigh, Tony turned slowly to face Rhodey who now looked concerned.
Steve cracked a slight smile as he slipped his hands into his pockets. “I guess someone needs to keep you safe.” He waved once more before turning to head toward the exit.
“Tony?” Steve walked into the bedroom, “I’ve been looking everywhere for you. I forgot how big your place was…I thought maybe I missed my chance to talk to you in a non-work setting.” He shrugged, smiling as he put his hands into his pockets.
Tony took his time looking directly at Steve. Not only had Steve accepted the invite, he looked grateful for it. Tony could hardly believe his eyes.
Steve kept his arms crossed, but now his expression was coy. “You could probably figure out what I like to do in my free time? That sounds a little stalkerish.”
Tony’s eyes widened, realizing that he had gone too far this time as he watched Steve rise quickly from the couch.
Steve paid little attention to the incident as he walked inside, greeting the security guard before accessing the employee express elevator. After the elevator stopped on his floor, he walked as quickly as possible to the lab, hoping to see Tony.
Steve reassured him with a compassionate expression as he crossed his arms. “Well I care about you.”
Just wanted to say that I'm so grateful so many people are continuing to read this story and enjoying it!
“Great!” Shuri patted him on the shoulder, “I’m glad you liked the party. T’Challa has a habit of going overboard sometimes.”
Sam made a small noise of disbelief as he squatted immediately into a defensive position, hurriedly looking back and forth, trying to find the source of this dispassionate, non-human voice.
Steve swore again as he unexpectedly smacked Tony’s ass before pulling him down closer to his body as tight as possible.
“Make sure…my funeral isn’t tacky, Parker, because your dad is going to kill me.” Tony breathed deeply as he groaned from the aches and pains caused by the fall.
Bucky stared at Tony then back down at Steve before walking to the other side of the room. He leaned up against the wall, crossing his arms. The atmosphere grew exceedingly intense and silent, filled only with the sounds from the machines keeping Steve stable. After about thirty minutes, Sam finally appeared. He rushed into the room, panting from jogging through the hospital.
“That looks good to me, Parker.” He patted Peter on the shoulder before they ran from out underneath their cover.
“Steve Rogers,” Tony smiled a little wider as he felt the sensation in his chest again, “will you marry me?”
“I’m not okay, Steve…before I met you…only two things made sense to me and that was working in the lab and taking care of Peter…” he paused as another cascade of tears flooded down his face, “…Steve, being with you scares the shit out of me—but not because you’re terrible…it’s because you’re wonderful and you just so happen to be really fucking hot,” he tried for a joke, but the seriousness of the conversation squelched any hilarity, “…everything about you makes me feel exposed and I’m not used to letting my guard down with someone…not like I have with you…”
“We originally hired Rogers here to do our legal work, but he picked up on using the device so well that he’s now a star player.” Fury grinned as he patted Steve on the shoulder.
Tony glanced at Steve with a confused look, making it obvious that he didn’t remember the teacher’s name. However, he regrouped quickly as he reached out a hand to greet Mr. Beck.”
Steve eyed them both, making it clear that he didn’t believe them in the slightest bit. The standoff between the three lingered on for a moment or so before Steve finally backed down with a sigh.
“No. I just have better aim.” Steve nudged his friend with a lively jab as they grabbed their jackets before leaving the apartment.
“I didn’t think I would get to see you today.” Steve responded, still smiling although now his expression was reserved.
dad couldn’t even get the device to work, so he never had the chance to prove otherwise.” Tony countered sharply.
Tony had been working on the suits for some years now, but he never had the opportunity to test them out in the field; instead, he had been testing the suits out in the simulation suite.
“Remind me never to drink again, Cap.” He slowly commanded before unwrapping the sandwich. He immediately perked up as soon as he took a bite.
“I think it’s a great idea. We could simulate a few scenarios in the lab before going out into the field.” Tony nearly let out a sigh of relief. He was sure Bruce was going to give him shit about Steve.
Steve smiled wearily. “I, uh…told him I would only do it, if you and I did it together…since we’re a team.” Suddenly, Steve felt weirdly nervous discussing this bit of information with Tony; he hoped he didn’t sound desperate.
Tony gathered his things as he waited for the others to shuffle out of the conference room. He then walked up to Steve, leaning against the table with his arms crossed, smiling.
Tony smiled at her, feeling relieved that Shuri possibly didn’t hear about how he acted at his own party.
Tony was lying on top a table, sprawled out, bouncing a rubber ball off a nearby wall. Steve was on the other side of the lab, leaning up against a console with his arms crossed. He couldn’t stop laughing from Tony persistently quizzing him about his likes and dislikes.
Tony punched a button to the private express elevator once they reached the bank. Once inside, the shaft of the elevator skyrocketed to one of the upper floors of the tower. Steve nearly fell over, but his practiced balance saved him while Tony calmly stood rigidly in place, seemingly used to the speed of his building’s elevator.
“Tell me when you’re ready, Tony.” Steve called. He hoped he didn’t sound demanding. Too bad, though, because whatever was irking Tony before was now a major source of irritation.
Tony’s eyebrows raised, completely surprised that Steve was talking about him while also being out on a date with someone else. It made no sense, but something about it made him feel like maybe Steve cared about him still.
“So, how’s the team looking?” Tony glanced up briefly from the file he was studying to acknowledge Rhodey who had plopped down in a chair on the other side of his desk in his office at Stark Industries. He was grinning, as if to tease Tony about having to be a team player, let alone a team leader. Especially on a project that he was more or less obligated to finish.
Tony heard a hard knock on his door, praying for the best but obviously expecting the worst given how horrible the last day and a half had been.
“Hello, I’m here to meet a Ms. Lupho and a Ms. Whoberis?” Tony held his hand out toward the two women perched against the desk, both staring him down with the strongest intent.
“I’m pretty sure I was a big baby last night because of the trip.” Tony attempted to joke, but Rhodey frowned.
As he slid across the clinic to assist Clint, Steve told himself to stop being weird and just talk to Tony. Maybe something personal was going on with his lab mate.
But of course, he still wasn’t mentally prepared to deal with this surge of emotions; he kept telling himself that their relationship was just repairing itself.
Tony rolled his eyes, making a move to walk away from Bruce. “I really don’t know how that relates to Synergy, but we’re fine.”
Bruce nodded before exiting the office. Tony sighed to himself, now swiveling in his chair. He looked at his monitor, tapping on the armrest of the chair a few times before launching himself out of the chair to search for Steve in their lab.
But before Steve could really dwell on his missteps with trying to flirt like everyone else, Tony’s voice interrupted his mental torture.
Steve smiled at Tony, ignoring his hand to give him a hug instead, causing Tony to melt right on cue.
But before he could respond, Tony interrupted him by calling over to Thor. “Hey, Thor!” He reached out over the table to grab his glass. “Pour Rogers—” he looked down at his glass as he struggled to remember what the cocktail was called, “whatever this is!”
“I completely understand where you’re coming from…and I’m really sorry about that…” Tony breathed deeply, “…but I can’t do this without you, Steve…”
Peter nodded quickly. Tony’s face twisted with confusion as he looked at Steve before looking back at Peter.
Tony had been out of it during the simulation because he had decided earlier that week he would ask Steve out for dinner, and the idea was consuming him. He reminded himself of his conversation with Rhodey and figured that Steve was probably old school when it came to dating. Maybe a nice dinner—just as friends really, Tony was horribly aware of pushing his limits—would ease any tension between the two.
After the ceremony, they found Steve speaking with one of his professors. He waved at them as soon as he spotted them. With a handshake, Steve greeted Tony first.
A strained silence appeared between them as Tony fought internally with himself, half accepting he had definitively missed his chance with Steve.
Natasha grinned. “I guess Fury made the right choice pairing you two up.” She smiled as she leaned further onto the table.
Steve shook his head again as the elevator stopped at the lobby. “I can’t do that. I’m not going to make a scene at my friend’s wedding. I already asked to bring my ex-boyfriend along.”
But before Steve could finish, Tony burst out into laughter again. He laughed loudly to himself as he slapped the edge of the bed.
Loki rolled his eyes as he sipped from his expresso. “What do you want, brother? I have things to do today.” He was annoyed that Thor had called him out of the blue to talk later that early afternoon but had been cryptic on the phone.
“Steve never seemed like the type to take things lightly…I bet he’s struggling with how to show you that he cares about you without pushing you away. You guys always seemed like you clicked…actually, and I said this on the way here with Pepper, I always thought you guys were going to get married…”
He thought about spending more time with Steve. He thought about the way Steve smiled at him which, surprisingly, began to loosen the pain somewhat. He took a deep breath as he thought about Steve interacting with Peter, telling himself that everything would be okay.
Natasha and Clint ducked under and jumped over overturned cars, scanning the simulated victims of the crash for which equipment would be needed in the mobile clinic. Steve and Tony were inside the vehicle with Bruce and Thor, driving toward the scene of the crash.
“That’s no substitution for caution, Tony. It bothers me that you don’t even care about your own safety. You are
Tony eked out a small noise of disbelief as Steve pulled them further onto the bed. Tony settled on top of Steve as they kissed each other, getting lost in the kiss before he straightened up a bit to look down at Steve.
Rhodey stared intently at Tony, seemingly on the verge of making Tony be honest with him right there while he was trying to enjoy breakfast. But eventually he backed off as his expression changed.
Bruce stepped forward to stand next to Tony. “So how should we go about doing this? I’m thinking we should stay in our original pairs and groups.”
Tony turned around with a grin, sliding his arms around Steve’s waist. “Yeah, at that god-awful board event at the penthouse.” He laughed.
Tony forced himself to smile. He looked downward before looking upward somewhat. “I really appreciate that, Steve…”
“Don’t screw this up, Loki.” Obadiah wagged a finger at the carrier who was now taking his cap off with a wide grin.
“Obviously you’re aware that the failsafe you originally constructed was enough to safeguard against most disruption to its main hardware.”
Steve laughed, hanging his head before looking back up at Tony. “I actually forgot about the first simulation…we worked so well together after…”
? Is that a question?” He then knocked the tablet his colleague was holding out his hands with one sweep, causing the colleague to whimper some more.
The hand on Tony’s shoulder squeezed tightly as Steve sighed before letting go. Tony watched his lab mate take a seat next to him, looking completely worn out. That was the first time Tony had ever seen Steve in such a state, and that was including right after Thor’s party.
“And I wish I were more like you when I was your age. Probably would have saved me a lot of heartache.” Tony laughed, mostly to himself, even though it wasn’t funny. He concealed how he was feeling by drinking out of his water glass.
“Oh, what?” Obadiah snapped back to reality as he realized that one of the tech conference staffers was trying to get his attention.
He grinned as he patted Steve on the chest, dragging his hand downward a bit. Steve blushed, but didn’t pull away, although he was a little annoyed that Tony had taken so easily to calling him “Cap” recently. Tony kept grinning before turning around to address Natasha and Clint.
“Remember that comic book series Peter’s been working on?” Tony held the sheet out for Steve, “he told me he added you to it and wanted me to give it to you.”
“I got into a bit of trouble with the iron patriot just now.” Tony whispered to Steve as he motioned with his glass to indicate Rhodey.
“J.A.R.V.I.S.,” he called as the robot threw a broken stand in their direction, “give me a rundown of Peter’s robot, I need to disarm this thing...”
Ignoring them both, Strange chuckled. “I’m sure Tony already told you what happened, but long story short, you survived a pretty devastating explosion. We brought you into surgery, which went extremely well, and you’ve been here for several days recovering. But,” Strange clapped his hands together, “you’re free to go whenever. You're healing faster than I had expected.”
Tony turned slightly to squint at Steve. He shook his head a few times as he yawned before rising from the bed. He yawned even louder as he stretched his arms out.
Concerning Thanos’s past and the current state of Synergy, Fury and Tony could no longer afford to keep non-Synergy members in the dark about the team’s plans. Fury had called a meeting with the executive committee which then morphed into a meeting with the board. The board meeting was to discuss whether Stark Industries could convince the government to pick up the project with more strident security measures.
“Remember that board member guy Tony can’t stand who was at the party last night?” He placed the mug down behind him to brace himself against the counter as he crossed his arms against his chest. Sam looked up from his sandwich and nodded.
For the board presentation, Tony and Bruce had created a scenario in which the team needed to use the Synergy device to create a mobile medical clinic to save a few people from a car crash on an interstate highway.
“But he didn’t. You could have gone your whole life without saying anything and no one would have known.” Sam sighed from laughing so hard.
“Actually, that may work…” Shuri added before pausing to pose thoughtfully, “since the device is easily portable, we can take it with us to the resort and work on it during some down time…we don’t need the lab amenities to finish this last phase…and if it comes down to it, we can come back into the city if the worst happens…my brother’s resort isn’t too far away from here…and I’m sure he can get us back out quickly.”
Tony couldn’t help staring at him; the light from the candle in the middle of the table accentuated every little feature on his handsome face. Something about Steve’s demeanor and tone in his voice suggested that maybe he was interested. Besides, who starts talking about being vulnerable and such while having a nice quiet, intimate dinner like this?
He turned around to see Sam standing at the top of the steps to Low Library, waving at him before turning to talk to someone. Tony walked up the stairs to join the pair.
“Hey, Rogers, did I tell you that Shuri’s starting here soon?” Tony called as he and Peter went back to working on the robot after the sequence concluded.
Steve looked down at the map as everyone else continued to offer their own opinion about the holographic slide shows. He could see that it was a topographic map of New York City and its surrounding areas with a grid grafted on top of it.
Tony nearly made a face from the unmistakable slight edge he heard in Mr. Beck’s voice as the latter annoyingly explained the policy, practically insinuating that Tony and Steve weren’t Peter’s real parents. He felt Steve still rubbing his leg to calm him.
Steve sighed heavily as he hung his head. “…I’m so sorry, Sharon…I should have been more straightforward with you from the beginning, but I really thought I was over Tony…or even ready to move on…I…,” Steve paused, “…I don’t think I’m in the position to be dating anyone at the moment…”
Tony nodded, staying near the door before taking his time to walk back to the bed. Steve watched him the entire time over. Tony stopped short as Steve looked up at him, reaching out for him as he finally met the bed.
“I don’t know how I’ll be able to sleep while thinking about you…” Tony whispered, trying to retain his normal outside composure.
He took half a second before turning over to nestled himself on top of Steve’s chest, feeling his body before lifting his head to kiss Steve again. They kissed for some time, too amazed with what just happened between them to do anything else. From time to time they would pause for a break, but the emotional and sensual pull was too great and they resumed kissing the other softly and deeply for what seemed like ages.
Tony slowly nodded as he tried to smile back at Steve. “I’m fine. It’s just the board thing.” He half admitted.
Steve sighed before continuing, “…now it’s a little too much, don’t you think? I can’t eat a meal in here anymore…it smells…like really bad.”
Sam laughed. “Also, thanks for taking me with you, Cap. Although, it probably would have been better to bring a
Steve looked to be considering the idea before he answered, smiling shyly. “I would love to, but I didn’t bring an overnight bag with me and we have to work tomorrow.”
Steve took his time reading over each word, studying it closely as if the text would magically rearrange itself into a letter of regret.
Tony straightened up, walking around Peter to lean up against the elevator doors, crossing his arms.
Tony moaned again as Steve pushed downward into his body, using both hands to rub along his sides and his waist. Tony pushed upward into Steve as Steve’s hand squeezed his waist before migrating down nearer to Tony’s cock, which had been growing harder with Steve’s every movement. Tony gasped as he felt Steve rub him, taking his time as they kissed each other. Tony placed both hands on Steve’s shoulders before drawing one arm around his back to hold him close.
Tony’s already practiced PR grin grew even wider as he waved. “I might have to get a new partner, Rogers. You’re upstaging me.”
Steve pulled out of Tony, but rubbed himself against his body a bit longer, kissing Tony slowly for some time before flipping back onto his back. He panted a few times as Tony snuggled up against his body, hugging Steve for a minute or so before Steve turned onto his side, turning Tony with him so that he could spoon him from behind. Steve laid his hand on Tony’s chest, feeling his nipples as he kissed his neck.
Tony shook his head as he uncrossed his arms, indicating that he was done with the conversation. He marched past Steve toward the bathroom before Steve stopped him gently with an outstretched arm.
The two friends walked over to Clint, Natasha, Fury, and Thor. They had a few lively conversations, one of which Steve learned that Fury had been married for over twenty years. He realized that he never really saw Fury having a personal life since, well, he was so private. Steve then met two other S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, Maria Hill and Phil Coulson, both of whom appeared very serious when introduced. Agent Coulson, however, after a cocktail, gabbed to Steve about how much he liked comic books. Steve also learned that Thor was in a relationship with another astrophysicist named Jane Foster, talking nonstop about her research.
“…uh…” Tony started, “…I would…really like that…Steve…” Being with Steve was what he wanted, he just needed to work for it again.
Steve had certainly thought so. Besides being overwhelmed by the setting, he had been seized by an especially intense conversation with Thor which involved a retelling of his usual hobbies. As the story progressed, Steve could no longer tell if its narrator was a fellow human being or the Norse god himself.
Bucky laughed. “That’s beside the point. You’re still acting weird,” he stepped toward Steve, simpering, “so, whatcha got
After another moment, Tony shook his head; it was no use. He took a second before turning his desktop on, scrolling through some emails to try to distract himself from crying more. He scrolled past several new messages before finding the flagged message sent from Justin Hammer before the weekend.
Tony smiled wearily as he rubbed his chest. “Thanks, but I haven’t asked yet, so there’s a high probability that he’ll tell me to fuck off.”
“You’re right. And I do remember…” he admitted, “I just…when I said that to you in the lab, I wasn’t thinking about after we talked. I was more focused on the fact that you’re the first—only person, besides my therapist, that I’ve talked to about that shit, you know, the shit with my dad.”
Bucky shrugged. His face looked grim which caught Steve off guard. “That’s because I have to suffer through a fancy event to spend time with you nowadays.”
Shuri unlocked a secure cabinet to retrieve the Synergy device. “So, I’ll just work on the device a bit before we have to rehearse later tonight.”
“You don’t say? You’ll have to remind me where you were stationed.” Tony attempted as cheerfully as possible although he could care less about this and wanted to talk more about Peter.
Steve was used to obeying orders and had always been an agreeable child and adult prior to entering the army. Inside, he was apprehensive about working so closely with Tony after witnessing his blasé behavior from before. But on the outside, Steve was just as resolute as ever.
It was Monday and Steve had managed to rally up enough courage to tell Tony about Obadiah accusing them of some illicit affair.
Steve wasted zero time following him closely behind, arriving in a room lined with dark wood paneling. There were floor-to-ceiling bookcases along each wall, complete with a fashionably antique record player positioned next to a small ornate sofa. Steve looked around to find a desk at the end of the room with a mound of books and papers stacked on top of it. It looked like Tony’s office, from what Steve could remember, but he realized that this was Tony’s personal library.
“Good question, Pep. We need to take the device out into the field a few more times to test any patterns and possible anomalies.”
“Can I get you something to drink?” Tony walked over to the refrigerator before Steve could answer him, hoping this would give him more time to formulate his thoughts.
Tony laughed as he let go of Steve. “Well, I guess I was right…it’s difficult to resist this face.” He reached up to caress Steve’s face.
Tony groaned as he tried to get up from the floor, staggering from the aches. He leaned up against the desk, trying to give himself enough courage to confront Steve and finally do what he should have done a long time ago.
"…besides…think about the emotional trauma you'll potentially be putting Peter through by constantly trotting temporary romantic partners through his life without a care in the world. Do you really want him to think that's normal?"
Steve nodded as he looked downward at the tablet with Tony. “Lupho and Whoberis? Do their names sound familiar to you at all?”
Tony chuckled before turning over on his other side to find the lube in the bedside table. He turned back over to face Steve.
Steve nodded as he turned to lean up against the console. “Tony, I just wanted to say thank you for including me…”
Rhodey chuckled nervously as he straightened up in the booth. “Yes, Tone. How many people do we know who go by the name ‘Pepper’?”
“So, what happens if it doesn’t understand what needs to be replicated?” The board member asked as he scratched his head.
Steve tried to respond, but he found it difficult trying to find the right thing to say without further upsetting Tony.
Bruce shrugged as he looked at Fury. Fury expressed his usual cool demeanor, but it was obvious to Bruce that he was pretending to be clueless about the lab access codes.
Tony laughed once more, but then he relaxed. “It was hot, relax, Rogers…and…don’t apologize and don’t ever feel embarrassed when you’re with me…especially when we’re like this…”
Almost every single person gestured enthusiastically as they cheered loudly for both Steve and Tony. Tony walked over to Steve, placing a hand on the small of his back as he waved at the crowd.
Steve waited for the sound of Tony’s footsteps to disappear. He hesitated before jumping out of the bed to reach his overnight bag. He found Howard’s diary before returning to the bed, cautiously turning it over and over in his hands. He remarked to himself how elaborate the diary’s structure appeared; the paper inside was heavy and coarse, filled with elegant script and sketches.
Strange only huffed with amusement as he continued to check Tony’s vitals. He hummed quietly to himself.
Although it had been clear since that night that their relationship had progressed into something more, Steve noticed about a week ago that Tony was still too awkward around him, often finding excuses to get Steve to stay over at his place. However, Steve, learning from their previous bouts of miscommunication, finally told Tony late one evening that he didn’t mind it and actually enjoyed spending the night with him.
“Well, that’s a damn shame…” Tony tossed the tablet he was holding on top of the console which caused the projection to pixelate.
Tony looked up at the sink before rising slowly. He walked up to the counter, looking at himself in the mirror before running some water to splash onto his face.
Tony reached for Obadiah’s hand, shoving it off his shoulder. “Don’t you ever fucking touch me, Obie.”
Steve thought for a moment. He sighed as he settled on giving Tony the benefit of the doubt. However, Steve now understood what everyone seemed to be referring to when discussing working with Tony; the man was impulsive and insistent. He took another deep breath before entering the lab.
Tony removed his hand from the armrest, straightening out his sports coat before addressing Obadiah. He wasn’t going to let Obadiah and his customary psychological warfare torture him today.
The two turned around as soon as youthful laughter drew near. Peter ran back into the kitchen with what looked like a pair of eyeglasses attached to a fake nose with a mustache. The glasses were also equipped with other items that had been glued to it like feathers, gems, and some other things Steve was unable to identify.
Steve heard Sam shuffle into the kitchen and head straight for the fridge. He turned around to watch his friend then shuffle over to the table, nearly knocking himself over as he plopped down in a chair with a sandwich.
Steve shook his head again as he slowly rose from his stool at the island. He walked toward Tony but stopped short.
Tony turned around, thankful that Shuri was there to prevent any serious relationship conversations that could inevitably ruin the entire day.
“We got to talk a bit while working on the sequences despite not having everything we need.” She teased.
“What else was I supposed to do? Everything was fine until this morning…he thought I just wanted sex from him…”
“You’ll still need to sign in since this is your first visit.” Her penetrating stare made Steve understandably uneasy.
Everyone grabbed their bags as the cabin door opened. They piled out to find T’Challa standing some ways away from the plane, flanked by his personal bodyguards. With a broad smile on his face, T’Challa was reaching his arms out, wearing a demure set of traditional Wakandan robes.
a stalker—Well, that’s unless you want me to be.” The statement came out more flirtatious than Tony had intended but that didn’t seem to bother Steve either.
“Do you have enough room, Tony?” Steve whispered softly, but it was clear after a minute or so of total silence that Tony had already drifted off to sleep.
The only thing that was keeping them together was Synergy and now that that had fallen through—mostly because of Tony—what was the reason to keep Steve in such a failure of a relationship? Steve could have anyone; Tony knew that Steve cared about him, but he could be with someone better than Tony. Someone who hadn’t made so many dangerous enemies.
Steve waited behind Tony before placing the diary on a countertop with some junk items Tony had started piling up. Tony tossed a box to the floor before walking into the dining room.
Fury stepped toward the table. “Gamora, here, sent the team that list of sequences and the coordinates to the lab. Once we made the connection, we had to get her into productive custody since we know that Thanos is prone to eliminating loose ends." He turned toward Gamora who nodded back.
He kept backing out of the room before spinning around to get to the living room area. He was embarrassed that they were in the situation they were in while attending a wedding at an upscale resort on a private island.
Steve looked around as if he were trying to find the source of the voice. “Uh, nice to you meet, too…J.A.R.V.I.S…”
Tony watched Obadiah saunter away. He swore to himself before turning around to head to one of the smaller conference rooms were Fury had called the Synergy team for their meeting.
Tony felt the color drain from his face. His mouth bobbed open a few times as he tried to answer, now feeling his face turn red.
Tony chuckled; He noticed he was starting to become a little more comfortable around Pepper. “I like how it’s not a possibility that I had anything to do with it.” He teased before pausing. “Actually, Mr. Steve Rogers came up with the idea.”
Bruce took a moment before putting his glasses back on. “I get why would you say that, but Steve, Tony’s been more open with you than he has with any of his friends, and that’s including me and Rhodey and he’s known Rhodey since college."
Steve sighed. He took his time, realizing that their conversation had escalated. However, Tony was pushing his limits.
“Then what is it?” Before Tony could formulate his reasonings, Steve jumped in, “I know we had our rough periods, especially the issue with the weapons manufacturing thing and going behind your back with your dad’s diary, but I thought this was…is serious…” His voice trailed off.
Steve walked over to the couch as Tony was loudly explaining his latest project to Bruce. As he sat down, Tony immediately turned around, pulling him into a half hug. Steve half hugged him back.
Tony turned to reach out and kiss Steve. “Thanks, baby. I can definitively use this.” He placed the journal on the bedside table before facing Steve again.
Tony heard his friend whistle a few times; he instantly felt self-conscious but that wasn’t going to stop him from looking forward to spending more time with Steve.
Natasha placed a hand on his shoulder to get him to look directly at her. “Dr. Selvig. You have to cooperate.”
The following day, Tony was eating lunch with Rhodey at a diner a few blocks down the street from Stark Tower. Rhodey was in town for a few days before he needed to fly back to Washington, D.C. for an assignment with the government.
The board members began murmuring to themselves as they shuffled around to exit the landing. Obadiah looked down at the team before leaving. Steve looked up at him and gave him a fake smile. Obadiah saluted him with a disingenuous grin before exiting with the others.
Tony’s voice had grown quieter. He was crossing his arms, looking stern, but his expression managed to retain some softness. Steve tried to calm himself down as he listened to Tony.
Both Rhodey and Pepper were aware that Tony was secretly working on a new Synergy device, but they weren’t aware of the specifics, most notably the location of Stark Enterprises in case the operation was compromised and they could deny culpability. Also, T’Challa had agreed to finance Tony’s new project considering that he still firmly believed in the original purpose of Synergy.
“Then Thanos will find a way to get it.” Tony finished the thought for Shuri with his back still facing them.
“…honestly,” Steve waved a hand around, “I don’t have any ulterior motive for bringing Tony along…okay? Please don’t make this a bigger deal than it already is.” He pleaded.
Steve perched himself against his table and observed the interactions amongst his teammates. They were proving to be an interesting group, but in a cute way.
He slapped Steve hard on the back, disregarding that Steve had been in a major accident. However, Steve barely flinched. Tony instinctively moved toward Steve to pull him away from Obadiah.
Steve grinned back before a reporter almost dodged past Happy, holding out a tape recorder over his shoulder.
I weren’t, which I’m not saying I am, how do you plan to stop him? He’s too far along…also I wouldn’t put it past him to get rid of
Steve bucked upward into Tony once more before he felt himself let go, quietly swearing to himself. Tony kept one hand on Steve’s chest as he kept moaning, trying not to laugh from Steve swearing again, his body eventually slowing down before lying on top of Steve. Steve wrapped both arms around Tony, holding him as he also came.
“That party was awesome. Tony’s so cool!” Sam nearly exclaimed on the subway ride home. Sam had more cocktails than he had expected and was basically leaning on Steve for balance.
Steve expression indicated that he was not happy about the robot smashing into things, but then he felt Peter tugging on his trousers.
Tony squeezed Steve’s arm before walking over to Peter who was stirring so vigorously that he splashed a good deal of whatever was in the pot on top of the stove.
Pepper lightly rubbed Tony’s arm; Tony was amazed with how relaxed he finally felt in his repaired friendship with her. A year ago, he would have been a wreck trying to talk to Pepper about even the smallest of matters.
Steve bucked upwards into Tony’s mouth, now feeling ready to give in. He ran a hand through Tony’s hair, looking down to see that Tony was rubbing himself while he sucked his cock.
Despite protests from the group, Tony finally decided that it was better not to pursue another project since Synergy was such a failure, and Steve hadn’t seen Tony since the team disbanded. There were many times Steve thought about texting or calling Tony, but he found it too painful and confusing in the beginning to follow through.
“I’ve only really been in one serious relationship...” Steve shyly admitted, glancing away from Tony, turning pink right on cue.
“I know. I’m just not sure...” Steve muttered. He shuffled a bit on the couch until he felt something poke him from underneath. He shifted to find a pair of sunglasses wedged in between in the cushions. He groaned to himself, recognizing that they belonged to Tony.
Tony nodded as he tried not to look so awkward from how thoughtful Steve was being. “Uh, yeah. Good idea, Rogers.” He cleared his throat again.
Tony halted, but he remained facing away from Steve as he answered. “I’m fine. I need to write a memo about the device lock down.” He offered, although he mostly wanted to escape from the situation entirely.
“…well,” Steve started, trying to figure out the best thing to say in order not to upset Tony more, “…it’s different with me and Bucky…” He tried cautiously.
Fury crossed his arms before giving Steve a well-deserved smile. “Well whatever it was may be what we need to show that the device is far more useful than we first discovered.”
“I think I had a dream about Tony last night…in the dream we…ugh…we were making out—then I remember waking up in his bed, alone…Tony was in his office…” Steve groaned as he buried his head in his arms on top of the table.
“I’m so sorry…I screwed up…” he repeated, “I didn’t realize…I didn’t realize what we had until it was too late…I am so sorry….please forgive me…” He looked directly at Steve who also looked exhausted and emotional. Steve took a step forward, but Tony shook his head, trying to signal that he wasn’t finished.
Tony spun around to face Steve while in the process of remembering all the little details about that night. Tony had only brought up that night because he had talked about his relationship with his father with Steve.
Obadiah tossed that day’s newspaper onto the conference table as he shouted, pacing back and forth in front of the room, packed with the Synergy team, Rhodey, and Pepper. The force of the toss slid the newspaper to the center of the table.
Tony couldn’t help himself from grinning. “Aw, well…” Was all he could muster as he looked upward at Steve who was gazing at him intently.
“Yep! I’m in the bedroom!” Tony answered back, swiping the image away before turning his tablet off. He hopped off the bed and walked out of the bedroom to find Steve standing in the living room area.
“I suppose we could make that happen. But first we’ll have to test its magical properties.” Bruce responded to Peter, wiggling his fingers in the air.
Tony sighed; he knew he screwed up with not being transparent about the failsafe, but he couldn’t address it now.
Steve backed away from the bed, feeling himself panic. “Maybe…uh, maybe there’s a pullout somewhere.” He almost tripped over himself as he searched the room, leaving Tony staring at the teddy bear on the bed.
Pepper pressed on. “Or the other times you forgot any holiday or any other birthday or an anniversary? Anytime I needed you to be somewhere important? Or the times I needed you to be serious, especially about the two of us, but you refused to be?”
Something out of the corner of Shuri’s eye caught her attention. She crouched down near an object, taking a moment before realizing what she had discovered.
But he couldn’t help himself. Feeling Tony like this had been better than he had ever expected, and he couldn’t slow down his body’s movements.
Mr. Beck shook his head, seemingly unaware that he was upsetting Tony. “No. Peter’s one of my better students and he’s a really good kid. I never had behavioral issues with him. So, I’m going to let him retake the test.”
Steve reached out for his coffee. “I think I’m going to head back home, Tony. There’s something I need to finish for a case before the weekend ends…” He turned toward the exit without letting Tony respond.
Clint took a step toward Tony to turn and face the group slightly, stretching a hand out. “Okay, so I get all that,” he interjected before Tony could respond, “but is there something we can do in the meantime? I don’t think I need to remind everyone that we’re dealing with a dangerous nutjob.”
Both Tony and Steve glanced at one another as Tony stepped toward the table, waiting for Thanos who appeared to be ruminating in his next thought, but remained silent.
As soon as the necessary information was entered, Steve stepped back from the device. It hummed quietly before turning colors to indicate that it was generating the S.H.I.E.L.D. tracker.
Tony shrugged, not really sure what Steve was trying to get at. He waited a second longer before responding.
As the presentation came to a logical conclusion once again, Steve wrapped an arm around Tony’s waist.
Steve sighed. He wanted to leave Malibu as quickly as possible; this whole amateur spying thing was starting to sound like a bad idea. However, he was glad that he had convinced Tony to let him tag along. Who knows what would have happened to him if he were alone?
Steve had told himself that he needed to remain as calm as possible for Tony during the entire trip; although he was aware that Tony had some lingering issues that related to his relationship with his father, Steve wasn’t sure what he would find or possibly encounter while staying with Tony at house.
“Save it, Hammer.” Tony sharply responded, knowing Hammer was mostly interested in replicating Synergy’s hardware and software.
Steve watched Tony run over to a console, which was spewing a cloud of smoke. He gasped as Tony then sprinted to the other side of the lab, grab a fire extinguisher and put out a tiny fire that was near the console. Steve’s eyes widened as Tony slumped down to the floor in front of the console, freeing himself from his headphones before tossing them to the side. He pulled out a notepad but before he could scribble anything down there was another loud pop. Tony jumped up to retrieve the fire extinguisher again. He rushed over to put out a fire at the same console. However, this time he looked pleased with himself as he whipped out his notepad again and jotted down some notes.
Tony smiled meekly, laughing through the pain. “You still want to work here even though I nearly killed you?”
“So,” Tony clasped his hands together, looking intently at Peter’s principal, “how do I make this better?”
Loki rolled his eyes, thinking the message was probably another email from Thor checking up on him, even though he had been sent home with a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent for constant surveillance. He placed his sandwich down on the counter before walking over to the table, picking up the tablet and swiping to view the message:
“Yes, in due time, the perfect spot to unleash my creation will reveal itself. Stane has reassured me that he’s close to taking control of Synergy.”
Ever since his breakup with Peggy, Steve had to deal with an overly clingy Bucky who had made it his mission to make sure Steve not only got over his ex but would eventually find someone to settle down with. Bucky was super picky, which Steve appreciated, considering how long it took him to get over Peggy, but he was an adult and he could handle himself.
Tony looked up at Steve. “Steve, it’s not your fault…I just don’t know how I’m going to get that lab back to where it was before…”
Steve turned off the television with a remote before hearing the rest of Obadiah’s charges. He had been visiting Tony in the hospital as often as he could since the explosion.
“Please slow down. I’m also making dinner later tonight, so pace yourselves.” Steve huffed as he watched his family ignore him.
“Come on, just tell me. I didn’t get accepted.” Steve’s tone never wavered; there was no hint of doubt. He knew it had been a futile exercise to try for something so competitive.
Steve shot up straight in the bed as he heard Sam calling for him out in the living room. The force of the movement woke Tony who made a few disgruntled noises.
Steve sighed as he looked downward before looking up at Tony. “I do care about yours and the team’s safety. But I think the Synergy device plays into that. It can do more good than harm. Much more. That’s the reason why I signed up for this in the first place.”
J.A.R.V.I.S. went through Tony’s schedule until the computer came upon a press event that Tony had forgotten about.
Sam paid for the tickets. He handed one to Steve as they entered the building and headed toward concessions.
After the first failed simulation, Steve wanted nothing more than to make sure the team worked together, and not against each other. They would be up against a lot in the future when they take the Synergy device out into the field and they couldn’t afford any bickering.
“Sam, come on. What if he had walked in on me?” Steve huffed as he used too much soap, splashing water everywhere from how intense he was washing.
Mr. Beck laughed. “Research and Development. My lab wasn’t too far away from yours.” He leaned forward a bit, “actually we ran into each other once. It was in the employee express elevator late one night…your husband was there too, I think.”
Considering the intercompany politics, Obadiah had to be involved: there was no way Selvig and Loki could tinker with the device’s mechanical wiring without confidential project information that had been distributed to the committee. And unless Fury and Pepper were also conspiring behind his back, Tony placed all his bets on Obadiah being the missing link. He just hoped waiting to gather more information on Obadiah didn’t lead to another unfortunate incident.
Tony found Mr. Beck to be completely discomforting, but managed to convey curiosity with a usual PR-like smile.
Tony shuffled uncomfortably back and forth on his feet. “Ty.” He answered quietly, inching further away from the group he was originally engaged with.
Tony stared at Steve before laughing loudly. Steve laid down next to him, his face turning red as Tony turned to face him, still laughing.
Steve grimaced as he tried to drag Loki away from the counter but before he could walk away someone smacked him in the face with a frying pan. Steve slumped to the side, grasping at the counter to hold himself up, as Loki ran away from him.
Tony inhaled deeply before attempting to solve the equations. As he read off the solutions and Steve entered them into the device, the device hummed quietly, but it wouldn’t generate any of the material.
Steve smiled through the pain as he tilted his chin upward to kiss Tony. “Thank you for taking care of me…”
Steve eyed his friends before rising from the table. “Could you send me the details for the party so I can send them to Tony, Sam?”
“Steve and Tony fucked last night.” Bucky interjected without any preamble, causing Steve to groan again and cover his face.
“Yo, Romanov. Rogers. You wanna grab drinks after work?” Clint had his hands up against his mouth to project his voice. Steve looked over at Natasha who was nodding.
“…come on, Rogers. Spit it out.” Tony smiled as he jokingly tried to get Steve to use his words. Steve could tell that his lab mate was becoming visibly restless, anticipating the worst.
Before responding, Tony sat back in the booth once more; he had been sure that the moment he heard Pepper had started seeing someone else, the idea would destroy him, but now it barely fazed him. Actually, the more he thought about it, as he felt his face morph into a sincere smile, the idea made him happy for both of his friends.
Tony was standing in front of their group of friends who had gathered on the penthouse’s balcony to celebrate Steve’s birthday.
“Thanks.” Steve grinned. He lingered near the entry of the room, thinking about Tony weirdly half hugging him in front of everyone before whipping out his phone to send a text to Sam.
She spun around quickly to march out of the kitchen with Gamora following closely behind. Nebula walked up to Obadiah, holding her silencer out.
Natasha shook her head as she looked at Shuri who also looked spent. “Nothing. If someone doctored the tapes, they did a much better job this time around.”
Steve nodded; he was just as timid as Tony had been. “Sure, I would like that.” He answered with his own reticent smile.
Steve unbuckled the strap to his helmet as he dismounted from his bike. He stared at the innocuous warehouse façade of Stark Enterprises, still debating whether if he really wanted or should continue working with Synergy.
Steve inched as close to the explosive as possible while still giving himself a safe distance to generate specs. Tony watched Steve press a few buttons on the device before giving him a thumbs up, indicating that he was ready to proceed.
The ceremony progressed with a mixture of certain Wakandan rituals. Tony struggled keeping his eyes on Sam and Shuri; out of the corner of his eye, he could see Steve standing off to the side next to Bucky.
He searched desperately around the balcony for some escape before seeing Bruce talking to some board members. Tony quickly walked up to the huddle, hooking his arm around his friend’s.
Steve smiled as he crouched down to be at eye level with Peter. “I’m picking you up today. Is that okay?” He asked, not really sure what to say to Peter without sounding overly forward.
The three of them chatted for a bit before Tony left to check on Peter’s packing process. He knocked on the doorframe before entering the room.
Tony uncrossed his arms to retrieve something from his back pocket. To Steve, it looked like a computer chip encased in a small glass container, but it was a little too big. Tony handed the chip to Steve. Steve hesitated before accepting it, not entirely sure what he had been given.
"A few years…" Tony glared back at Obadiah, telling himself to remain calm, "but I don't know what that has to do with Steve going to the thing tonight."
Steve’s eyes darted around the room as he tried to sit up in the bed. “I just remember walking into the lab—oh my god, Tony!”
“I’m not really an artist.” Steve knew the statement was ridiculously false, but he was also human, too. Who doesn’t fish for comments occasionally?
Both of the scientists nodded quickly as they followed Thanos behind a shielded area. As soon as they were at a safe distance, Thanos aimed the device from his pocket at the object. The object began to glow, shuddering violently...
Steve stared back at her unable to contribute before Sharon continued, shrugging. “…I gathered a bit that maybe it was tough for you to talk about…because you haven’t really talked about your last relationship…but then I kind of put two and two together and figured that maybe it might had been Tony…you talk about him and his son a lot…”
“Okay,” Bruce huffed as he began to walk past Tony, “I’m going to start working out more, dye my hair blond, then grow a few inches taller. Maybe that’ll get you to pay attention to me.” He concluded as he described Steve’s key physical features.
“Our world is becoming more unmanageable…and uh…and destructive by the minute…,” Steve could feel his nerves getting the best of him and he was only practicing with Tony.
“Okay, so you already know the deal, Parker. Five things. And today’s reward is letting Steve stay over tonight.” Tony pulled out a stool before settling, extracting a tiny notebook from his back pocket. He looked up at Steve with a smile before writing down that day’s date on a fresh page.
Steve rolled his eyes. “You better watch it, Tony. Not remembering someone’s name like that may come back to bite you.” But he laughed to show that he was being facetious.
Tony could feel his frustration with the entire situation irrationally over taking his composure and he immediately took it out on Steve.
After some time, Tony glanced at the entrance of the balcony, nearly spitting his drink back out into his glass as he spotted Steve entering. He excused himself immediately, walking briskly up to Steve to greet him.
Tony looked around his office as if searching for any clues on how to decipher the subject heading. He then refocused his attention onto the monitor, debating with himself whether he should click on such an email that could possibly contain a cripplingly virus.
Tony crossed his arms as he looked downward at his chest. He knew she was right, but part of him wanted Pepper to embrace the risk and help him somehow.
“Will you be here later, Steve?” Peter looked at Steve, as he shoveled a ton of scrambled eggs into his mouth.
How in the world was he going to tell Tony that everyone thought they were sleeping together? Well, Steve had jumped to the conclusion that that was the case. If Obadiah and Sam had believed so then there was a good chance everyone else they knew thought so too. The thought ate away at Steve; people would automatically assume the only thing he and an older Tony Stark would have in common was that they were having sex.
Steve took a moment before grabbing Tony’s hand. He held onto it before giving it a gentle squeeze. Tony smiled slightly upward at Steve, letting the other hold his hand until he pulled away a bit to sip out of his glass.
As soon as he was outside of the office, Obadiah scoffed to himself. He pulled out his phone to place a few calls before heading toward the company limo.
But there was something about Steve’s smile and the way he looked at him when they were together. It had the usual hint of Steve’s agreeable personality, but something about it suggested something else. As the elevator ran up the core of the tower to the penthouse, Tony smiled as he thought about Steve possibly “liking” him and that maybe he did have a chance.
As soon as the group exited the room, and was at a safe distance, they all broke out into a sprint to get back to the landing pad, finding Clint and Thor standing near a helicopter with Natasha already in the cockpit.
Bucky rested his hand on Steve’s shoulder to squeeze it gently. “Let me know how it goes, okay? You can do this, okay? Love you, man.”
Steve nodded again as he waited before turning to the leave the balcony, stopping for a second, thinking he should say more, before walking inside. He continued inside anyway, telling himself that he needed to give himself and Tony some space.
Obadiah whistled loudly as he shut the front door before strolling to the sitting room in his penthouse. He had purposely missed the press event that evening to secretly review some contracts he was hoping to bid on for Thanos’s device.
Tony’s mood then fell rapidly as he thought about how hurt Steve looked and sounded the day he had broken up with him and how difficult it was telling Peter that they were no longer together.
“Yeah,” Bucky patted Steve on the back a few times, “he manages to impress me every day.” He quipped.
Obadiah nodded, but he was annoyed on the inside as he thought back to the last board presentation when the team simulated the highway car crash. His contact in the labs had managed to tamper with the device off hours, which is the real reason why the device was shaking uncontrollably while Steve was inputting figures. Obadiah had expected the mistake to reflect poorly on Tony, but that meddling Steve Rogers had managed to salvage the calculations somehow.
As Steve entered the lobby of Stark Tower, he bumped into a figure rushing quickly out of the building.
Steve was too shocked at this point to contribute to the conversation. “You know what? I should probably leave. I’ll take a cab or car service of some kind or whatever.” He knew that he would end up saying something wrong; he needed some time to clear his head before talking to Tony about something he shouldn’t be concerned over.
The board had decided to hold the investor event at a loft in the financial district instead of Stark Tower even though the extent of the damage from the explosion had been contained to the seventieth floor.
Tony laughed louder as he patted Steve on the back a little too hard. “Like if I go into a coma or,” he drew a finger across his throat, contorting his face as if someone had strangled him to death.
After leaving the army, Steve had struggled with post-traumatic stress disorder for some time which prompted his mother to get him into therapy. After she died, Steve struggled to bounce back but was saved by his friends encouraging him to stay in therapy. He didn’t know where he would be if he hadn’t.
Tony took his time acknowledging Steve. “Are you going to tell me I was overacting?” He attempted to joke, but he sounded exhausted.
Steve crossed his arms behind his head. “We’re not even married yet, and we’re already doing parent things.”
Steve scrunched up his face. “Okay,” he then patted Bucky on the shoulder, “I’m going to find Tony.”
“I’ve only thought about this abstractly, never in practice, but there might be a way to reconstruct the vibranium core to work in tandem with the failsafe. Although not perfect—you’ll have to test it out, of course—it might be a better safeguard against any future disruptions.”
Sam laughed. “Uh, no.” He had his arms crossed against his chest again sporting the same goofy grin from before.
Steve’s expression grew serious. “You can tell me if something is bothering you, Tony. I don’t mind.”
Steve inhaled deeply as he looked downward at his desk drawer. He exhaled as he pulled it open, shuffling around some folders and papers until he found the chip embedded with the failsafe codes to the Synergy device Tony had given him a while back. Fury had instructed the team to hand over their lab work and destroy any sensitive material, but Steve couldn’t do it. The chip was the only thing he had kept that reminded him of Tony.
“…Steve…oh my god…” Tony could barely process what was happening as he sat back helplessly paralyzed.
The space for the party was filled with the sounds of laughter and music. The guests were all gathered into a huge outdoor space near the water. The venue was so massive that T’Challa had different sections set up for a live band, a few bars and buffet tables.
Bucky patted Steve on the shoulder again as Steve mulled over his friend’s advice. Before the beginning of his last relationship, Steve had taken his time and almost didn’t ask Peggy out. Usually, he was never the type to rush into things, but he was also concerned he would miss out on something that had the potential to be something special if he continued being cautious toward Tony. Yet, he wasn’t sure how to balance his more reserved personality with dating effectively. However, perhaps taking a new approach wouldn’t hurt.
Steve, who was standing against the wall opposite the door next to Thor and Shuri, uncrossed his arms as he took a step toward the conference table to stare sternly at Obadiah.
“Perhaps you have a more effective way?” Thor grunted as he opened the other side of the backseat to tie up Loki with the cables.
Steve then limped to the tub, turning the water on, running it for a while until it reached the desired temperature. He then steadied himself before emerging his entire body underneath the water, letting out a relaxed exhale as he sank to the bottom. Steve closed his eyes, letting the warm water soothe his muscles.
“…uh…tell him…uh, I’ll…just follow you out…” Steve rose slowly from his chair and walked out of the office ahead of his assistant. He took his time surveying the cubicles until he spotted Tony chatting with another intern next to their cubicle.
“The original device theorized by Howard Stark had some hardware issues. Synergy 2.0, if you will, has been rebuilt learning from those mistakes. You won’t see something like that again.”
“For the longest time, it was just her and Bucky who I considered to be family…I’m thankful I met Sam, especially to get me through law school…But she would have been so thrilled about Synergy…” Steve rambled on a bit as a string of statements filtered through his head, each one connecting to something else.
“Sorry, doc. But I can’t tell you that. You know, government secrets and what not.” Tony waved his hand around as Thor and Bruce finished assembling the machine.
Steve couldn’t sleep all night; all he could think about was that he had possibly ruined his relationship with Tony by moving too fast.
Tony watched the door close. He waited a second or so before smiling to himself, turning the car engine on. Along the way home, all he could think about was how hot his moment with Steve was and how close he felt to him. He smiled ridiculously thinking about Steve as the private express elevator carried him up to the penthouse. As soon as the doors opened into the penthouse, Tony pulled out his phone to text Steve.
Tony shook his head as he deleted the message. He took a deep breath before tapping on his phone again.
Natasha communicated her annoyance with the question, but then she smiled at Clint. “No, I have not.”
“You’re right about how selfish Obie is. But there could be a possibility that he doesn’t even know what he’s getting himself into.” Tony countered.
Tony nodded before walking back up to the console to retrieve his tossed tablet. As he worked through the data on the weapon, out of the corner of his eye, Tony could see Bruce staring at him worryingly.
Tony looked back at Bruce and Shuri before facing the staffer. “Sure, why not. Actually, something came up with my CFO. Where are we set up?”
Steve sighed. It was nice of Sam to prepare for good news, but it could have easily been bad news. Which probably would have been easier to swallow with champagne.
“Would, um…” All that practice in the mirror that morning and Tony just ended up forgetting how to speak normally. He glanced upward at Steve and shuffled around a bit.
“Oh yeah? What does Obie want now?” Steve could tell that Tony was trying to be his usual cheerful self, but now he sensed that something was making his lab mate uneasy.
be serious. Why would you keep this a secret? Everyone deserves to know. You’re putting people’s lives in danger!” Tony cringed as Steve’s voice rose toward the end.
Tony could tell that Steve was waiting for him to continue, but he felt paralyzed. He knew he needed to be honest with Steve about everything which was becoming easier the more time they spent together, but he couldn’t bring himself to really discuss all of his issues associated with his dad. The memories were still too painful to bear.
Steve blushed from the comment, turning just as red as Ned had been. It felt great knowing that Tony had talked with Peter about their relationship.
Tony turned to Steve. His face was mere inches away. “Yeah, Your-mun-gandur, Rogers.” He pointed over his shoulder with his thumb at Thor as he severely mispronounced Jörmungandr.
Tony nodded again, feeling himself panic. “Uh…well…I’m definitely not seeing anyone else or even thinking about it…if that’s what you mean…”
Steve stopped short from entering to watch Tony work. He looked down at his wristwatch. It was 7:30am. He wondered how long Tony had been working in the lab.
As soon as they were alone again, Tony coughed once more. Steve looked over at him out of the corner of his eye and smiled timidly. Tony felt like his heart was imploding, but there was no way he could take advantage of Steve; he wasn’t sure if this overly flirty Steve was a symptom of alcohol consumption or if it was a genuine feeling. Either way, he couldn’t risk it tonight, especially with their board presentation days away.
Tony muffled a whimper, unable to explain any further. He knew what to say, but the sight of Steve choked all of the words out of his throat.
Both Rhodey and Pepper nodded in agreement, recognizing that Tony was doing his best not to raise further alarm regarding the situation. As the conversation switched to another topic, Tony scanned the room with his eyes, trying to find Steve again. He smiled as he spotted Steve talking with a board member; Tony was completely transfixed by his infectious personality.
Bruce nodded sternly as he held out a hand toward Tony and Steve before moving toward the weapon. Everyone waited, the tension in the room mounting as Bruce walked slowly to the counter.
He took his time walking slowly toward Tony’s giant jacuzzi bathtub which was situated in the middle of the space. Steve limped slightly to the counter space, removing his clothes to place on top as he caught a glimpse of himself in the mirror. He had quite a few scratches and burns from the explosion that were healing quickly, but it still took some getting used to seeing himself like this. Even in the army, Steve had never sustained so many injuries.
on tumblr! Check out their work; it’s so good! I’m so glad to have their work associated with this fanfic.
Bruce glanced at Steve as he grabbed another tablet to scroll through data. “Oh, you know, he’s probably trying to keep himself busy before the trip this weekend.”
Tony moved his head to face the direction of his bedside table. “You know what to do.” He teased again.
Tony shuffled a bit in his chair. He cleared his throat. “He’s doing great. He asks about you from time to time.” He steadied himself before taking a sip of water. Pepper nodded as she delicately placed her cloth napkin on top her lap.
The candid frustration evident in the sound of Steve’s voice made Tony laugh. He reached out again to take Steve’s hand.
Peter looked to be seriously considering the idea. “That would make it easier for breakfast.” He concluded.
Tony glared at Obadiah, trying not to expose that he was surprised that Pepper hadn't also reached out to him about being late. However, instead of dwelling on it, Tony took a seat far away from Obadiah at the conference table. He cringed, watching Obadiah chew on his sandwich, before freeing his phone from the back pocket of his pants to answer some emails as they waited.
“I suppose that’s accurate…” Tony offered meekly, tapping his fingers on his desk. He swiveled back and forth in his chair, still practically lying down in it.
Pepper smiled meekly before shaking her head. “Tony. This is super serious. What if he had caught me? I shouldn’t have done that.”
Steve nodded back as he rested his hands on Tony’s hips. Tony smiled before tugging on the waistband of Steve’s briefs, prompting Steve to awkwardly finish the job for him. Tony squeezed a significant amount of lube onto the palm of his hand; he leaned forward as he repositioned himself, reaching the hand covered with lube behind himself as he straddled Steve.
And now thinking about Tony thinking about him in uniform made Steve muse on something he had fantasized about once or twice but felt too silly until now to mention something to Tony.
sorry. I thought you all wanted me to be happy. Well, I fucking knew things with Steve weren’t going to work out.”
sounds like a challenge,” but then he sighed as soon as Strange’s expression grew serious, “…kind of. But I don’t know what that has to do with my panic attacks.”
Steve shook his head, but he managed to smile although it was painful. “No, I know what I need to do. Let’s enjoy today.” He reached over to rub Sam’s arm before Bucky launched into which resort activities they should check out before getting ready for the wedding.
“I knew Bucky through my mother’s friendship with his…we became close that way, especially when my mother needed help taking care of me…”
“I’m glad I meet your standards.” Tony grinned at both Whoberis and Lupho before looking back at Steve.
Also, Tony felt like he really couldn’t be his most vulgar self with anyone else besides Rhodey. It felt good being this vulnerable. Now if only he could sort out his dating life, he would be living in paradise.
“Remember that diplomat that almost died a few months back?” Tony carefully unveiled part of the device to show the officer, “this is the same device that saved him.”
Tony shook his head as he ran a hand through his hair a few times. “Nope, I just took my lunch break a little early.”
“Your dad is right, safety is indeed important,” Tony turned to face Peter, “but I think this will be a science fair project that will end all science fair projects!” He exclaimed which hyped up Peter.
Tony looked around anxiously as he took his time entering the lab, wishing Bruce hadn’t ran off so quickly so he could use the company to gather his thoughts and figure out how not to sound desperate when asking Steve over for dinner. Tony inhaled severely as Steve turned around and waved at him with a smile. Tony remembered to smile back before finally entering the lab.
Tony looked at Bruce, grinning slightly before answering. “But what? There’s more we can do, isn’t there?”
Although he looked momentarily surprised by the accusation, Tony knew Bucky was right. He had been feeling a serious connection toward Steve, serious enough to believe that he might be in love but had refrained from saying it out loud. He couldn’t even have a serious conversation with Steve about the state of their relationship.
…” The colleague corrected, clearly weirded out by the scientist’s insistence on using such a bizarre name, “we can’t go further without the watch.”
“…I remember vividly when my parents died. I was twenty-one and they had left for a few days for vacation but had stopped in Roslyn Heights to visit a friend. Of course, the detour had been last minute…they—someone smashed into their car…they didn’t survive…”
“Bruce is fine.” Bruce inched a little closer toward Steve to shake his hand. Steve gave Bruce a firm handshake and a nod.
However, Steve wasn’t sure what to do; calling Tony out would only give Obadiah a reason to commandeer the Synergy program away from him. Steve took a deep breath before scrolling through queued sequences from past simulations to correct some of the inputs to at least stop the device from shaking.
Tony screamed in his head as he smiled at Steve, grateful that his husband always managed to relieve him of awkward situations.
Peter giggled as Tony picked him up from the ladder. He gently placed Peter down in front of Steve before returning to the pot on the stove.
Steve remained in the lab, debilitated. He could see Tony marching down the hallway through the glass façade.
“I usually don’t order a car service, I usually take the subway, but I thought I would get here faster.” Steve explained casually as he settled. Tony watched Mr. Beck nod at every word Steve uttered, and he had to prevent himself from rolling his eyes.
Steve nodded as Tony let go of him to access the private express elevator again. On the ride up to the penthouse, Steve had noticed that Tony was trying to restrain himself. Steve then reached over to give Tony a hug, turning somewhat to pull him into a kiss. They continued like this until the elevator stopped at the penthouse level. Tony unwillingly pushed himself away from Steve as he led them to his bedroom.
Peter grimaced as he looked at Ned before looking back up at the building. He knew Ned was right, and he knew he would eventually get over it, but it was annoying, nonetheless.
Steve was leaning up against the wall to his apartment building, waiting for Tony and Peter to arrive. He knew he should wait inside like people normally did whenever expecting a guest, but he was too excited to see Peter and, for some unexplained reason he wasn’t ready to deal with, Tony.
Steve nodded again as he sat back down at his desk watching Tony leave the office. As soon as the door closed, Steve groaned loudly, placing his head into his hands.
The hallway was really a glass corridor; Steve could see Stark Industries employees working in various labs along the hallway as he approached the conference room. Once he reached the door, he stopped briefly to regain his composure; he had never been so nervous before.
Steve nodded as he scrolled through pictures of the suites on his phone. “The suites are so big it’ll be like we’re living in our own apartments anyway.”
Steve smiled politely, but kept an eye out for Tony, which turned into an awkward game of keep away the rest of the night. He managed to avoid his lab mate as much as possible; at one point, Steve left a conversation hanging as soon as Tony approached him and Clint. Clint looked confused as soon as Steve excused himself abruptly, but then shrugged it off. Tony also looked bewildered but appeared to recover.
Tony laughed as he turned to face Steve. “You know, Rogers. You’re better in bed than you think, trust me.”
Tony smiled as he realized that Steve was letting him take care of him in some small way. “Of course, Steve. Should I call it now?”
The more he thought about Steve, the more agitated he became. Tony shot up from his desk and headed for the door, thinking it would probably be better to let off some steam in the lab then moping over Steve all day.
After some more internal debating, Tony removed the pillow to look at his phone. This was the most he had ever been confused about a relationship with someone he genuinely cared about: Steve kept telling him that he just wanted to be friends, but he was spending more time with him and Peter when Tony thought he would have been using that time to get to know Sharon more since they had just started seeing each other.
The band began playing as Tony played along with them. “Whenever I see your smiling face, I have to smile myself, because I love you, yes I do…” Tony started singing, immediately earning a slew of cheers from how unexpectedly nice his voice sounded.
“Okay, what are we having?” Tony rubbed his hands together as his tone changed, “and please don’t tell me this is too involved liked last time, Rogers. You’re going to have to start paying me if you want me to be your Sous Chef.”
You would think that of all the things Tony could possibly own, it would be a portable charger. But then again, he wouldn't be passed out in Steve's bed right now... :p
“Oh my fucking god, Steve…” Tony gasped. He reached out to hold onto Steve who leaned forward to hug him.
Rhodey leaned forward. “Tone, I don’t know if you remember this, but remember when you thought you had moved too fast with Steve after you made out after that party at Thor’s?”
Steve nodded with a yawn. “Okay, I’m a little tired, too, from working on those case files so I may relax on the couch.” And he was also tired from worrying about Tony all day.
“Rogers figured out that when we take the device out into the field, we can queue the figures before sending the specs to be replicated. This way, the device will also remember the sequences which will save us some time in the future.”
“You know,” Tony began as he continued to leer at Steve, “one of my fantasies, when you’re not lying naked in bed next to me, is thinking about you in uniform…”
Tony patted Bruce on the shoulder. “Okay, let’s wait for the rest of the team to get here. In the meantime, let’s figure what we need to get people off this island.”
Already feeling tipsy from his few drinks, Tony wobbled into the office, slumping down hard into his desk chair. He placed the bottle and the glass on the top of the desk before staring at the drawer that contained his dad’s diary.
Pepper caressed the underside of Tony’s palm. He could feel his heart aching, but it was finally good to hear why Pepper had left, although it made him feel worse. He told himself to push through the pain in order to salvage whatever relationship he could have with Pepper in the future.
Peter clapped his hands together, excited about making pizza from scratch. Tony nodded yet he seemed skeptical of the idea.
“Sure. What’s your name kid?” Tony asked, taking the students notebook and pen with a more genuine expression.
This whole situation, or thing—was it a thing?—with Tony was so confusing to Steve. At times, Tony would be willing but then he would pull away or get upset. They had a discussion about boundaries before leaving for Malibu, but then they were all over each other at the mansion. Tony even came up the pretending to be married plan. Even now, they were touching each other, but the conversation felt tense and not intimate.
Tony chuckled as he used his fork to point toward Steve. “Peter, why don’t you tell Steve about your art class?”
Steve stopped rambling to look up at Sam who had uncomfortable expression on his face. Steve made a face at his friend.
Everyone murmured as they began moving away from the table. Tony remained in the front as he watched everyone dawdle a bit before exiting the room.
Yet something about Tony going straight to the possibility of sex instead of apologizing for treating him the way that he had confused Steve about what to do next. Tony had broken up with him; he was the one who ignored him. Why should he forgive Tony so quickly after what had happened between them?
Obadiah looked away from Tony at the door leading into the conference room before returning his gaze.
Steve turned around to join them at the table. “I’m not that bad.” He sat down in a chair which was facing the table backward, his arms crossed on top. Tony had to keep his eyes trained on Sam not to stare, but he was struggling.
Suddenly a loud thud nearly caused Steve to jump out of his shoes. He inched closer toward the glass, gazing through to see what had made that horrible noise.
Clint nodded as he motioned for her to hand him a water cup with a straw in it. “Yep. It might have been one over, but it was close.”
Steve shook his head once more as he tried to get away from Bucky, but the latter had taken a firm hold of his shoulder with his bionic arm.
“My birthday database,” Tony repeated with a coy laugh, “every birthday I upload a backup of my memories to this database in case the worst happens.”
“I think that’s a fair assessment—and I don’t want to pretend to know more than Dr. Banner—but could we run a program on the console first? You know, like an algorithm?” Steve swiped the numbers away to enlarge the image of the vibranium core. He spun it around a few times, amazed with himself that he had picked up maneuvering the controls so easily.
