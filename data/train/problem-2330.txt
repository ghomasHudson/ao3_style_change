“Sherlock Holmes.”
"You mustn't say things like that Sherlock. A lot of people would be hurt if you died."
Once he was done screaming he looked around the flat and realised he was a mess. Papers and broken furniture laid scattered around on the floor and knifes stuck out from the walls and fireplace. Stains of tea and coffee decorated the walls and some parts of the floor Sherlock didn't bother to mop. His chest heaved and he looked down to look at what coffee mug he had broken and almost let out a dry heave.
"I'm okay."
Here's the next chapter! Hope its not too bad. But enough of me ranting, enjoy!
Sherlock growled again and glared at Mycroft harder. Did he think this was some type of sick joke? Obviously he did! Sherlock would like to see him try to solve this! He wouldn't had even found the scars on the people until a couple of weeks…. okay, days, but Sherlock's point still stands.
“What point are you trying to come across Lestrade?” Sherlock said in a slightly agitated voice.
“Fine, I don't need you anymore. Goodbye.” Sherlock pushed himself up from his knees on the floor and grabbed his violin again and placed it underneath his chin, his bow sliding against the strings. A deep note was played and continued to stretch out for minutes, no other note was played but that deep one.
Lestrade groaned and ran his hands through his grey hair. Things like this were Sherlock's thing, finding weird crap and then deducing it before running after the culprit and capturing him. The fact that Sherlock couldn't do that for this case was alarming.
“So you're the guy he was talking about.”
“Right. It's shocking. He's never mentioned his family or siblings at all.”
“SHUT UP SHERLOCK!” John screamed, earning multiple confused and concerned eyes from the policemen and women.
Sherlock cleared his threat and looked back up at John instead of staring at the floor.
“Yes, yes that’s her.” The man said with an uncertain voice, as if he was afraid of being punished beyond healing.
His fingers were about to text a reply but was cut short from the other person beating him to it.
A golden strand of hair.
“Did I startle you?”
He didn't have to pay much and John had left around nine thirty that night. He remembered getting a text from John that he was on his way back, which made Sherlock quickly put his experiment away before John entered the flat and realised Sherlock had mangled his shoes.
"Sherlock Holmes, I need to check for dents and possible signs of a struggle and I'm on the case ‘The-”
He’d do anything to keep cases death free and the number of people that had been killed to make the case stay the number of people that were killed to make the case. If Lestrade had to get on his knees and pray and plead, then he’d gratefully do that. But he couldn’t, because someone had already been killed. A sister, and not just any sister, but the victim's sister. He was frustrated enough that anyone who was killed would possibly be put under his name, in both the case and John’s head. Now he’ll be remembered as ‘the man who let my sister die’ to John.
“Yes, either that or it was extremely cold in the room.” Sherlock sarcastically said and rolled his eyes.
No, no, no, no. Wrong. Wrong again. All wrong.
“The cashier.”
“Who are you? Whom do you work for?”
"Are you okay?" A grunt from Sherlock was her only reply. She sighed and turned towards the photo again.
His phone rang and Sherlock opened it up without looking at the name or number on the glowing screen.
'The Blonde that's worth a dollar.'
He, Sherlock, was a great friend.
“Do we have to repeat every order we give to you again? Go over to the cars and we'll be with you shortly.” Harry sternly cut the man off, her hands clenched to fists as she spoke.
“What look? I don't have a look little brother. If you were as smart as me you would know that.”
“Oh dear.” Mrs. Hudson whispered as she looked around the flat of 221B Baker Street. Her face was somewhat worried and somewhat scared of what she would find today as she cleaned up the messy place up a bit.
“They're mocking us, I'm telling you, they're mocking us.”
“I don't want to.”
Sherlock smiled as he managed to stop the tears.
“You're so stupid Sherlock. You might as well tell Lestrade you can't solve it.”
Sherlock stopped in front of the wall that had the pictures and thumbtacks and string, staring at it for a second and silencing his breathing so the whole flat was quiet, before groaning in frustration and ripping every paper off of the wall. John widened his eyes more as Sherlock scratched the wall to rid of the papers, thumbtacks and string.
Sherlock went back into the common room before slamming the door behind him so he muffled Mycroft's voice.
Sherlock took a deep breath and leaned back, standing up straight before handing the file with the information about the cashier to Lestrade. He took it and opened the file. The picture of the cashier in the footage was in it. This was the man.
“A Hobbit?!"
"Whoa, okay, let's not do that.”
"What did you say?" Lestrade asked slowly, as if daring Sherlock to say he was lying.
She looked up to see Sherlock's head pop out to give her a look with an eyebrow quirked before disappearing again. His footsteps could be heard and Molly guessed he was walking around the room once more looking for clues.
“So you
“I don't need to know why these people were taken and I don't care! I only want the address John had last been seen at! Really Detective Inspector, I thought you would be better at your job and helping people in need but clearly you're as deplorable as a snail trying to beat a human in a mile race now give me THE ADDRESS!” Sherlock slammed his fist into the table, making all the objects on it jump.
“Both! The cashiers dead!” Lestrade yelled. Sherlock stilled and stared, Donovan and Lestrade looking at him confused.
"Who was blonde Sherlock? Who's blonde?! WHOS THE BLONDE!?”
Lestrade's hand was already halfway to the door knob, ready to twist it and push open to see the consulting detective. His heartbeat drummed in his ears and his breathing had slightly quickened. A click of a lock was heard as his hand rested on the knob.
Sherlock stared at Lestrade and felt like strangling him. He had already known that! He'd know that the second he looked at the file! He didn't even need to look at the photos to know what.
Sherlock didn't ever believe someone could be so stupid. He only believed that someone could only be a specific amount before they couldn't even be stupid, they'd be smart. That's it, only smart and retarded were the only types of intellect he had in his brain; but wow. His brain was just proved wrong by proving that someone could go beyond the stupid point.
“John.” Sherlock softly whispered and clenched his eyes shut.
“I honestly don't know what you're up to, but I could help you if you would calm down and let me explain to you why.”
The flat went quiet and John's hard face had soften instantly. His eyes went wide and hurt showed on his face. Sherlocks face had softened as well, but he had no signs of regret or sorrow. John shook with rage and his clenched fist turned his knuckles white.
Lestrade, Harry, and Sherlock made their way to the car's where the man was standing. He was fidgeting with his shirt and looking around. Once his eyes locked onto Lestrade and the other two people behind him he started talking.
Once Molly left Sherlock got to work. He put on his black leather gloves to protect the bag from his fingerprints. Sherlock pulled out his magnifying glass and got rid of his thick coat, placing it on a chair and exposing his purple button up. He stretched his hands before glaring back at the bag, slowly approaching the bag as if it carried a disease.
The sunset was beautiful. It had orange, yellow, red, blue, purple, pink, and some grey. It loomed over London and Baker Street with it's array of colours and washed over the sky. Sometimes people ignored it and moved on, but other people stopped to stare at the beautiful source of light and life. Sherlock was staring at the light with colours filling his sight. It was magnificent and wonderful… Until the black spots started coming in.
“Sherlock, dear, you've got a package.”
“I just- I just wanted to ask you if you were okay. I mean, I thought that the funeral would remind you of-” Lestrade gestured his hand and looked at Sherlock sadly. “Well, you know.”
“Then please,” Sherlock motioned for him to continue, “Indulge me with your new information that I don't already know.”
Sherlock picked up the box and mumbled with a deep frown as he tilted it every direction he could. He opened the door to his flat and went in, Lestrade following soon after; behind Sherlock so that way he couldn't kick him again.
“Okay.”
“Where's Sherlock?”
“Impossible.”
"JOHN!” He screamed as he threw his head up to the ceiling, his face crinkled as if in pain. A soft and quiet sob wrung itself out of his body.
Sherlock's lips twitched into a slight smirk and he turned around to face Lestrade.
"I don't know."
Blood.
‘Finger nails’
“NO!”
The policemen had scattered around the house, stopping then the fence on the sides that blocked out access to the backyard came around. The house was quite large, it had a front patio and was a two story house. It was white and taken care of. There was a hazel brown fence by the sides of the house to protect his backyard and a green water hose neatly coiled by the side.
“How do you know that it says that?” Sherlock snarled.
“Sherlock,” Mycroft said, loud enough to hear over the low yet loud note, “is look at the case if I were you. You'll get the answers from that.”
“Nice to meet you Harriet. I'm Detective Inspector Lestrade.”
"Ah, and the baby returns." Mycroft held a tight smile as Sherlock dramatically entered his office. His coat swished gracefully behind Sherlock as he strode towards his brother, a determined look set stone on his pale skin.
And with that, Mycroft left.
“Where was John last seen Lestrade!? Answer me or I'll wrench your tongue out of your throat so you can't!” Sherlock slammed his fist on the table.
“Looked at the cameras all around the store. No John.”
“I'll make sure you're wife knows you bargain in strip clubs and have one night stands with them. Good day to you too sir.” Sherlock left the cursing, red man who had barely opened his mouth to ask yet another question about his and John's personal life.
“I EARNED THESE SCARS SAVING YOU!”
Sherlock entered the common room again where John was staring at him as he made his way to his chair. John was also sitting in his chair, but he moved the chairs closer so the two men could work on the case together.
“Mycroft.” Sherlock spat.
“Yes, I'm afraid both me and Mrs. Hudson have repeatedly looked over to box and the envelope.” Sherlock cocked his right eyebrow and looked down at Lestrade.
Sherlock had looked down at the piece of paper Lestrade had written the address and number of the cash register on. Luckily John hadn't used self checkout, his card never worked with it.
“Oi, you're not going to the store, are you?” Lestrade asked as Sherlock had gripped the door handle.
“A man who solves crime and is going to solve yours next if you don't let me look at it.” Sherlock mumbled, earning a surprised look from the woman.
“Because I care.”
“She's my-” John widened his eyes and looked down to look at Harriet on the damp grass and mud. Her eyes looked up at them hauntingly.
Talking to himself is one of them. He couldn't help it though.
Wrong. No. Incorrect. Think. Relax. Stop.
He brought the mug to his parted lips and took sips of the strong black liquid. He took a large gulp and was halfway down his throat when he decided he was finally done for the day and he was relaxed.
Lestrade huffed and sat back down in his comfy, black, padded swivel chair. He closed his eyes and sighed again before sitting up, opening his eyes,  and grabbing his coffee mug. The coffee had been made extra strong to keep him awake, but that only cost him hours to be spent awake then asleep and dark purple half moons under his eyes.
“I'm sorry John.”
“Yes? What is it now Lestrade? I don't like talking over phone. I prefer texting.”
Lestrade only widened his eyes and inhaled deeply through his nose while he made that face saying 'there's no hope in this one.' As Sherlock pinched the space between his eyebrows even harder. His eyes hurt from squeezing them shut for the ten minutes he had.
"And if I don't?" Mycroft asked coolly, leaning back to stare his brother down. "What if I decide it's not a productive use of my time?"
“You're not the only man on Earth that gets bored Sherlock. I thought you oughta know that by now.”
“And you have hairy feet John."
“Because you’re my friend.”
“But my name is… Harriet.”
“By who?” Lestrade asked, a furious frown on his face. His eyes blazed with anger.
"Oh."
“The cash was in the bag.”
“Don't pester me of my weight Sherlock,” Mycroft said with a deeper voice, his smile straining. “I could go all day bothering you if your nonexistent intelligence.”
“The cash is in the grave. They meant cashier.”
“I'm going to have to speak to my manager. Who are you exactly?”
“HEY!” John grabbed the file filled with papers and chucked it at Sherlock, who laughed and ducked as it went flying above his head.
“Sherlock,” he whispered in front of Sherlock's closed door. “Are you in here, mate?”
He stepped off the beaten bed and stormed to the kitchen, where he grabbed a coffee mug and shattered it on the floor.
“I'M HIS SISTER! THAT'S SICK!”
He realised she had a firm grip on her handshake and a good posture.
So this was Harry. Harriet. Wow.
"Oh my god."
“Your eyes…” Sherlock mumbled after a moment of silence. John, throughly confused, frowned and tilted his head to the side a little.
He must've had a rough childhood, then leading him to join the military to get away for a little while.
“A man was reported missing in this shop, he was at this cash register and I would like to see what he had bought and around what time along with how much money he had spent.” Sherlock pulled his scarf tighter on his neck to prevent his hands being on the woman's neck, who looked at the paper in disinterest.
“Sherlock.” The elder Holmes brother mumbled as he saw the wall that was attacked by pictures of missing people and red string that was thrown everywhere there was a thumbtack.
Sherlock went over to the passenger's side of the car with the umbrella, leaving Lestrade glaring at him as he walked to the drivers side, exposed for the rain to soak him. Once they were inside Sherlock threw the umbrella onto the back seats.
"I can't see him at the moment. I'd rather stick to my old guns, thank you." Sherlock said sourly with a punch of fury. Lestrade could never even think of fully understanding the Brotherly Holmes Love. He had to keep from laughing as he made a mental note to call the Holmes' dynamic by the new title he created.
John.
know what I'm talking about!?” Sherlock raised his voice and narrowed his eyes, “I told you not to play stupid and you are!”
Lestrade was taken back by that. Sherlock Holmes had just said please?! What was John doing to the guy?
“And a sister who's a drug addict and alcoholic.”
“You solve this bloody case since it's so easy!” He threw the papers at Mycroft's face, which smacked him before all the papers dispersed and fell to the floor.
“I know. He's a knee slapper.”
They would have came as soon as they found out that this was where the man lived, but they had sent a policeman and policewoman to scope out the area as they passed by the house casually; only to find that the cashier was staring out his window with wide eyes.
“Nothing, nothing, Sherlock,”
“Did you know that?”
He yelled and threw the coffee table over and watched in anger as papers flew in the air. His chest heaved heavily and he stared at the window, a glare settling on his face that shone his cold eyes.
“Sod off.”
It never did.
“Mrs. Hudson!"
"JOOOHN!”
“Goodbye Lestrade.”
He pulled out his phone and scrolled down the contacts list.
His eyes darted around the room that was cluttered with papers, experiments, dark shades on the tables and walls from explosives, and dirty dishes. He took a deep breath and showily released it, his eyes glancing at the clock for the hundredth time. His fingers remained intertwined together and his lips firmly pressed against them.
“I heard you Elizabeth! Give me more time and tell them to wait on their greedy arses until we have more! It's us doing the work! Not them!” Lestrade snapped at the blonde woman, who nodded her head furiously before hustling from the hall they were walking down to spread the news. Lestrade continued walking as he passed people throwing empty cups of coffee away, madly signing papers, typing on the computers with their tired eyes inches away from the screen, trying to calm down people on the phone, and tossing papers Lestrade's way to sign or look over.
Sherlock yelled from inside the flat he just broke into.
"A dragon? Is that truly how you see me John?"
“Oh and Sherlock?”
An envelope.
Neither did John.
He hung up and continued the sprint, practically running into the door of Baker Street. He fumbled with his keys before opening it and sprinting upstairs to find it empty.
Sherlock hummed and went to the wall where the pictures of missing people had once been and picked up papers and pictures that were littered on the floor. He hadn’t had the time to pick the ripped papers up, and thankfully some papers weren’t ripped. He sat down on his chair and glared at them, thinking. John still stared at Sherlock and continued to stand by the frame of the kitchen. He frowned as he watched the detective grip his head and stare at the papers in his lap.
Sherlock's head snapped up from his hands and was placed in Mrs. Hudson's direction. He frowned and stared at her back as she stirred the streaming tea he would take only a sip of.
Lestrade opened the door and got out, closing it behind him. Multiple other officers had gotten out too, along with Harry. They all made their way to the front door quietly, looking around for anything unusual.
Sherlock's chest clenched. John held so much hope in Sherlock, and he blew it away. He let John down when he thought he’d come for him. ‘Not some kind of guy’ he is.
“We don't know who's it is sir, but we found it by the downstairs bathroom along with a collection of knives.”
“Lestrade?”
“We have ourselves a gift.”
“Sherlock, this doesn't seem smart. I may work with dead bodies but that does mean-" Molly screamed when glass shattered in the flat.
Sherlock scoffed and glared.
"Who exactly must I find, brother mine?"
Lestrade gasped as his mind solved the puzzle.
Lestrade broke the silence first.
“The shop.”
Sherlock hummed in thought as his mind was racing, trying to find out who would do this, what type of person, and where would the person most likely be hiding. Sherlock did know not to underestimate people due to self experience. A man who had five children and a loving wife had slaughtered sixteen people and buried them in his own backyard. An old lady managed to kill her three grandchildren and son before taking herself.
“GET OUT!” Sherlock snatched mycroft by the lapels of his tuxedo and dragged his to the stars before shoving his down it. Mycroft stumbled but managed to get his balance before he fell down the whole flight.
“Hello?”
Sherlock and Lestrade took a look at the cashier and noticed he had stopped breathing. They both frowned and Lestrade looked around the room as Sherlock looked at the cashier.
Sherlock didn’t know why or what caused John to have the sudden urge to baby him, but it was getting slightly annoying. Especially since all John did now was stare at Sherlock and frown as he observed him. He wouldn’t have minded at all, but the fact that John does it for hours get’s on Sherlock, and the only time John isn’t watching him is when he’s locked himself in the bathroom to avoid his haunting gaze.
“I’ll be taking my leave too, Detective Inspector, text me if any new,” Sherlock looked at Donovan darkly, “information comes up.”
The door clicked open and revealed a long, skinny, pale Sherlock in his loose pajamas. His hair was a mess and his eyes looked clouded. His hand still clutched the doorknob and his back was slightly slouched.
“Huh?” Lestrade said and looked at Sherlock before back to the road. “What?”
I'm so sorry for not being able to keep promises.... so very sorry. At least the next chapter is here now. Yeah. Sorry. The story is about to get a lot more interesting though. Just wait...... Anyways.... Onward Fellow Readers!
Sherlock frowned even more and stood behind Lestrade, who was fighting to control his breathing after the minor heart attack.
“Step out of the house.” Sherlock told the man lowly. The man looked quite shocked from the order. He expected that from the actual cop, not a man in a trench coat, scarf, and black leather gloves.
“On it.” Lestrade nodded.
John was here.
“What else was in the bag Sherlock?” John's voice cut Sherlock out of his daze and back into John's wide eyes.
“Just open the file again!”
“He kept saying, ‘he's coming! Just you wait!’ And ‘he's smart, a genius even! He's gonna find and get you!’,” the man said and stomped his foot, a harsh and furious glare set on the man's face in seconds. “But you didn't! Did you!?”
Lestrade jumped so high that his rear lost connection with his chair and his coffee was spit out all over his desk through his mouth and on his trousers through his nose. He yelled as the burning sensation went to his legs, groin, and nose. Lestrade day back down and started to jerk his shoulders in a fake crying way, his face scrunched up like he was about to start sobbing.
How did Sherlock miss this before? No, he didn't. There was nothing there.
Sherlock stared at the file before looking back at Mycroft. “You know where it is. Give it back.”
His heart was just like John Watson's memories.
“Patience little brother-”
She squint at a woman who seemed to be smirking past a light in a purple blouse with black diamond earrings. The background was dimly lit and her hair was blonde and short. Far shorter than Molly hair. She grabbed the photo carefully, placing the magnet back onto the fridge before examining the photo again. She could feel something was off about that woman. For a reason Molly couldn't describe, she didn't like her at all.
“Johnny. Johnny-boy’s missIng"
"Think, you retard. Where was John at? Where did you let him get kidnapped?”
“The blondes in the bag.”
“Shut up.”
“The man's too fat to be John, and he's also too tall- no offence to John in anyway." Lestrade added in quickly when Sherlock cringed at the comment on John's height.
“Step out of the house. Now.” Sherlock demanded with a sharper voice, his mask fully in place.
And he didn't even know it.
Sherlock moved his face so quickly to the window that his nose almost rammed into the glass. His multiple coloured eyes (mainly blue with a little bit of yellow, and even some green) fixed onto the small box that laid in front of the doorsteps.
The cashier swallowed before nodding and stepping out. He moved to close the door but Lestrade shook his head and held the door in place with his right hand.
And when he's pissed he's deadly.
He slouched in his chair in the kitchen, his elbows resting on the table, and his legs bent under the chair he was sitting in.
“What's that?” Sherlock bent down to look closer at the cashier.
“Yes, I would like to know if I could check the computer to see a credit card number and receipt.” Sherlock told the woman quickly in his baritone voice, his eyes scanning the cash register and conveyor belt.
“Sherlock, PLEASE!” John yelled as he scrambled up clumsily and following Sherlock with a limp due to three thumbtacks stabbing his right leg and one in his right arm.
“So, John’s missing?”
Lestrade stopped groaning when his lungs ran out of air. He looked around the office in a bored yet stressed out look before reaching for his coffee and taking in a huge gulp. He let it sit in his mouth and he savoured the flavour with all he had. His muscles grew relaxed and his breathing grew more controlled as the liquid caffeine sat in his mouth. He shut his eyes and leaned back in his chair, the world quiet and peaceful for the first time in months.
She smiled, showing off her pearly white teeth and hunching her shoulders a bit so her collarbones were more pronounced. She laughed and blinked at him, trying to flirt with him while showing him that he has not power in his situation. John growled.
“Oh,” Molly nodded and looked at the bowl with the brain in it for a second before looking back at him. “A boyfriend.”
Lestrade didn't notice his jaw was down until Sherlock pointed at his lower jaw, signaling that he should probably close it; which he did eventually. He sat back lower into his chair as he took the information in. He was about to ask about the woman before another thought came in mind. A though that he knew Sherlock would probably, no most definitely, be offended by.
“No. I was going to after I told you.”
Lestrade didn't have his uniform on, instead he wore a black suit and black, shiny dress shoes; so the mother didn't know that she was cursing out Lestrade in his face.
“It's just a-”
“What?” Sherlock snapped and turned to his right to face John who was crouched down on the side of Sherlock's bed with his pajamas on too. Judging by the way John was talking and how wide his eyes were, he's wide awake. And judging by Sherlock's face and how closed his eyes were, he didn't care.
“Has anyone sent us any new information dedicated to the case lately?”
“Mrs. Hudson! Have you ordered anything online lately?” Sherlock yelled as the two men made their way upstairs.
“Sherlock?”
He sniffed tried to push the tears down, which he did, but they came back up when John wouldn't leave his head. He was right, John was gone and he wasn't even trying to find him. He literally had to be fed and watered because he was sulking. John really was gone and he wouldn't remember Sherlock when he came back.
A knock was heard from downstairs and the clanking of the class cups stopped, Mrs. Hudson then rushed downstairs as she yelled ‘wash yourself up Sherlock’. The door opened and voices were heard, nothing Sherlock payed attention to. He continued to lifelessly pluck at his violin strings. His eyes darted at the door for a split second as the sound of footsteps were heard coming up before darting back ahead.
Sherlock watched, filled with anger, as the cashier looked around the store. He slowly backed up as he kept glancing around, before he put his hand on the door and pushed it open, dashing into the night. The bag was with him and it was droopy and the cashier looked like he had a hard time carrying it on his shoulder.
“If the roles were switched Sherlock, John would've taken care of himself as he kept trying to find you.”
He ran around the flat, his breath hitching each time he came to an empty room.
“Are you stupid! Jesus! You've really lost the game now!” The man wailed and shoved Sherlock back towards the ledge the man had been sitting on.
“The cash is in the bag.”
Sherlock turned around before he had made it to his room and strode back towards John, making his back up unconsciously.
Yet there was? No. Sherlock doesn't miss things so obvious.
A calming silence rang through the car. Lestrade stared ahead, lost in his own thoughts as Sherlock casually drummed his fingers on his right knee. They both had met the parents of the cashier and walked away when she started to use unclean profanity against policemen.
“Hey, don't catch that attitude towards me now, save it for your brother you twit."
“I don't bloody care! She's my sister!”
The screen changed once again and a silhouette of a man was shown. It was only to the man's chest and up that Lestrade and Sherlock could see. He was wearing a coat, one that was familiar to the both of the men.
“Apparently not if I keep on doing it, obviously.”
Lestrade stared at Sherlock, his brain realising that he was asked a question.
“Please.”
“JOHNS?!”
"What?!" He wailed as he slumped down in his chair in defeat, the heat of the coffee starting to slowly go away.
“My, how rude!” An elder lady said as she had just been bumped by Sherlock as she passed the door.
And Sherlock enjoyed John.
"Who called you?"
“I honestly don't know who exactly you are, or where you came from, but whatever you're doing can't be so important that you have to look at the security camera footage.” The manager said as he narrowed his eyes on Sherlock, who pressed his lips together and breathed out through his nose.
“Are you sure that's it?”
Sherlock hadn't realised how much he had been affected by this. He didn't realise how skinny or pale he was, bloody hell, he didn't even realise how tired he was. He didn't realise how much his mind was running around uncontrollably.
The wind blew in Sherlock's hair and face, darkening the mood and flapping Sherlock's long coat. A glare and a firm jaw set in place on Sherlock's face as he stared at the man on the roof of Barts, standing and waiting for the man to do something.
“You should relax.”
“He was looking around the store and slowly making his way back to the door before he opened it and ran. Now tell me, Lestrade, does that sound suspicious?” Sherlock whispered quickly as he leaned towards Lestrade.
Anyways! ONWARD FELLOW SHERLOCKIANS!!!!!
"About your state."
“Game? This is a game? Moriarty-”
“Think damnit! Think!”
“Why would you want to do that?” Sherlock inwardly sighed as he took a deep breath. He took the paper out of his trench coat pocket and handed it to her with his gloved hands.
“No, that's just stupid”
Together.
John was here.
“Look, Sherlock, I’m very busy with paperwork so I might have to leave right now to get it done with. I’ll be back as soon as possible though-”
“And what's this? Where'd you get it?” Lestrade asked as he pointed to the cloth.
His chest rose and fell slowly as his lungs were forcing oxygen through to keep him alive. His eyes remained shut as he didn't want to give his consciousness away. His lips twitched and he made his toes slightly flutter to make sure he still had control over his body. He opened his eyes a simple crack, just enough to see his lower half. He made a tiny groan to make sure his voice wasn't all gone and his collarbone hurt.
Sherlock looked over at the window, forgetting she was still outside. She should've said something earlier.
Yet another chapter...... next one will be out soon..... Just like someone else.......
John growled.
Lestrade and Mycroft split up to find the curly haired detective in the silent, dark flat. Lestrade took the loo and Mycroft took the kitchen as they already knew the common room was empty.
“No, he was desperate to live. He was begging for us to believe him.” Sherlock said as he sniffed the table.
"Quiet Molly. I believe there's still neighbours in the flats below and beside us." With that Sherlock left the room to check out the rest of the flat. Molly knew he was hurt and wanted to get away from her before she brought up John again.
Until next time!
"What?!" Molly's eyes widened and Sherlock shushed her again with a confused look.
Sherlock held his hand out, the rest of him still curled as he stayed in his knees, and waited for the cardboard to touch his hand. Lestrade placed it on his hand and Sherlock put it on the ground In Front of him before he uncurled and opened it. His eyes widened when he pulled out the thin CD and he threw his head back up into the air as his back arched to the ceiling. Sherlock clenched his eyes shut and let a scream out to display his agony.
John would be in the flat if they had found it earlier.
"Thank you for the unwanted reality check but if you weren't as futile as the people you worked with then you'd understand why I'm okay with being slightly malnourished." Sherlock, with an annoying tone stated with a deadly smile.
“I don't know what I di-”
He slammed the coffee mug down on his table as Sherlock approached him with a scowl on his face.
Hopefully this story is interesting. If it's not, then tell me and I'll try to spice things up a bit.
"Americans?" Lestrade looked confused.
“There are pictures of me and you in the paper and on Mrs. Hudson's fireplace.”
“Oh.”
“Newsflash! I do too!”
Lestrade walked towards his car, giving a random policeman his now empty coffee cup as he walked. He cursed under his breath and grumbled insults as he got it and turned the car on and left the scene. He clutched his steering wheel tightly and thought of how Harriet’s reaction would’ve been when she saw John for the first time in months. She probably would’ve hugged the soul out of him.She probably would’ve cried and smiled, she could’ve walked away.
“It's quite obvious Sherlock.”
Sherlock's mind swallowed the information. Mycroft was in on it and looked through the cameras. John went into a store and never came out. John hadn't been followed by anyone around him. John had disappeared.
‘Sherlock Holmes’
“Sherlock? Hey, you here?” Lestrade whispered as he gripped the Loo’s doorknob and twisted it, only to find that it didn't twist all the way.
Mycroft leaned forward, his worry lightly weeping into his words.
“Because John's not here anymore.” Sherlock said sharply, turning to glare at Lestrade with a locked jaw.
“What?” Lestrade asked and turned to the man, who had let his hand fall limp by his side and slightly move backwards in fear of what was to come next.
Lestrade looked closely at the pictures, staring at their collarbone. His breath hitched and his eyes widened as he saw the faint sign on their collarbones. It was weird. Not a type of sign he's ever seen in his life.
Dylan looked shocked and swallowed before slowly shaking his head. Sherlock only sighed and rolled his eyes in annoyance. He wanted to beat the pulp out of him for John, but he couldn't.
"Who'd be involved other than him?"
“No.”
“He knows. They know. We know. I know. It's simple. We have to search for worn down places and send people in to investigate.”
I had gone looking through the camera footage and found John. I watched as he payed for the groceries with a male cashier.” Sherlock said as he showed Lestrade a picture of the cashier from the footage.
"You bloody idiot Sherlock!," Lestrade half yelled half grumbled with his teeth clenched as he held Sherlock's left hand in his left hand and Sherlock right arm in his right hand that was wrapped around his skinny waist. "That's evidence!"
“Shut up.”
“Fucking Anderson.” He mumbled when he hung it up.
“Who likes to play a little too much.”
The man who John punched got up and ran to where John had, clutching his nose as he did so. The camera view was empty for a couple of seconds before the cashier was by the door with a black bag. The bag was large, a large black bag. Large. Black bag. John was in the bag, wasn't he? Yes, he was.
Molly looked proud. She smirked and puffer her chest out as she continued to pace around the lab, avoiding the shattered beaker off course. The last thing she needed right now was for glass shards to lodge up her shoe and into her foot. Though, she's had glass in her foot before, it wasn't an experience that she'd want to go through again.
John spat, glaring the man down,
“The tape or the cashier?”
"Why'd you do that?”
Donovan scoffed and crossed her arms her eyes narrowing dangerously.
“Git.” Lestrade mumbled.
She heard Sherlock scoff from the window, which was about four feet above Molly's head.
“You know what- I’m done.” John said and turned on his heels before speed walking away, his coat flapping wildly behind him. Sherlock hummed and frowned, turning his head to Lestrade but keeping his eyes on John.
Sherlock squeezed his eyes shut and held onto John like his life depended on it. His lips couldn't help but curve into a smile as his nose took in a slightly familiar scent.
The man shook his head, his face probably now held a smirk.
The package was left out on the floor by Johns chair. Mrs. Hudson had seen Sherlock sneak a couple of glances towards it and she could tell he just wanted to open it and not eat at all. He had told her on multiple occasions that the thought of food sickens him.
She kept a smooth face with a smirk. He could tell that she already knew that he'd say yes, all she needed now was for him to accept it. She was dressed quite sharply and had on makeup. She was pretty, but he could sense the danger with her. He like it for some reason, but he felt like the type of danger was wrong. As if she wasn't the person he'd want to feel the danger with.
“Right back at you little brother.”
Sherlock frowned as he slowly opened the envelope, being careful to not rip the paper inside. Once it was fully opened he took a deep breath.
“AND NEVER COME BACK!” Sherlocks scream echoed through the flat, followed by a loud thump and then glass shattering. The screech of car tires was heard before loud thumps on the stairs and harsh breathing. John looked up from his chair in the upstairs common room and stared at the door, waiting with a partly open mouth and wide eyes for the curly haired detective to come into view.
“I'm… Harry.” She paused before she finished her sentence. Oh yeah, she was definitely the drunk woman Donovan was talking about. He could tell because she had already forgotten her name, and she slurred as she said ‘Harry’.
The smile was gone from Sherlock's face by the time he replied to the coffee ridden inspector. He knew he wouldn't win this fight with Lestrade given how annoyed he was at Sherlock from his coffee incident. He'd either forcefully yank him in Mycroft's direction or he would just tell Sherlock to get someone else to help because he's given up. Either one was bad.
The man who kidnapped John Watson.
The Blonde’s In The Bag.
“Okay Molly, I'll tell you if we got anymore people heading your way. Thank you for the information. We'll give you an award or something you want.” Lestrade stood up his full height from hunching over the pictures.
Sherlock had stopped playing the low note once Mycroft shut the door behind him. He considered throwing the file away into the fire pit and burning it, but he wanted to know where it was and how he could get it back. He put his violin away and picked up the scattered file that fell on the floor when he shot up to yell at Mycroft.
He grabbed a photo of a woman from the refrigerator and walked into another bedroom in the flat. She stared at the back of his head and looked back at the photos on the fridge.
“Open it!”
"Screw the evidence Gavin!" Sherlock yelled as he tried to break his right arm free of Lestrade's grip. "Let me throw it out the window!"
"You do look like a bloody mess, Holmes. You're skinnier, which I didn't think could be possible, you're more pale than you were before, you have bags underneath your eyes-"
“Johnny. Johnny-boy’s miss. He goning”
“A VCR tape?” Lestrade took it and frowned as he turned it at different angles. “Have you watched it yet?”
“Mrs. Hudson, that's really not necessary-”
“Oh lord, hopefully we can get a decent package next time with decent information to help find John.” Mrs. Hudson sighed. “Sherlocks a wreck without him. He keeps thinking about him and it always brings him down. I keep telling him to not worry because either way, they come back to us-”
“Good boy. Now what did the man say?”
Harriet was on the ground, lifeless, with torn clothes, wide open eyes that were cold and used to be filled with fear, and a bloody body and face. She had been killed earlier on the day by an alcohol and drug overdose. The blood had come from her mouth, she had coughed to much and hard and got it on her hands. To try to hide the evidence she wiped her hands on her clothes, that leading to her whole abdomen and thighs to be covered with a smelly red colour.
John was safe.
Does deadly work maybe? She seems to enjoy cats as- oh that doesn't matter does it? She also must have multiple people after her as she has many passports under a different name, face, date of birth, and social security number. She travels and looks for her next victim but she's not one to kill innocent people, oh no, she only does what she must to protect and provide for herself. This means that if they have control over John it could be a, as John says, 'a bit not good' because he's an Army Doctor who knows to his shoot someone before stitching them up."
“Sherlock, I'll try to get that but let me tell you why these people have been taken. When we had looked over the files and people we-”
"It is, isn't it?"
“Still.”
“What?” Molly looked surprised and she frowned.
“Just John.” He mumbled when she had left the room to go to her own flat.
"I understand that! But you have to understand that you're just as useless with this case as John is because you both have no idea what you're going on about! You're half dead and he's got...." Lestrade frowned and waved his hand looking for the right words, "short term memory loss or something!"
The two men stepped outside of the car and walked over to the doorsteps, Lestrade saying ‘excuse me’ as Sherlock frowned at the box and bumped into passing people without any signs of apologising.
“Wait, how'd you know that?”
“Dylan Landon, I suppose you show me what I you know what I'm talking about.” Sherlock said calmly at him as he started to cower back.
“Sir, there's no new information and the public wants more of it now. They want information and we're receiving hate mail and threats. Sir, are you listening? Detective Inspec-”
“Then Again, you weren't able to save Harriet…. why should I hold so much hope in you?”
"Yes. Grab my arm." He walked to the window and reached down with both arms, his ribs pressed against the windowsill uncomfortably. She grabbed on and jumped to help create momentum for Sherlock to pull her up with. He grunted and pulled, his ribs screaming in protest for the windowsill jabbing him. Once Molly was halfway in and her stomach lay on the windowsill, she let go of Sherlock's arms and pulled herself in the rest of the way.
“A hair? Who’s-”
“John you idiot.” Lestrade looked to his right where Sherlock had mumbled before turning his attention back to the screen.
“Did you order Harriet to be released?” Lestrade said in a deadly calm voice, a trace of a smile coming on.
God they should kiss.
“Well, seeing that I don't remember anything and, what's his name?”
“You always were quite empty headed.” Mycroft mumbled to himself, as if Sherlock wasn't in the room.
“For blank empty minds yes.”
“Nothing. You cleared your throat. Did you forget five seconds after you did that?” Sherlock added sarcastically.
The bag.
"Sherlock!"
“Oh thank goodness you boys came. I've been getting really worried about Sherlock recently.” She sighed and slightly frowned with a worried expression. “He's just not the same anymore.”
"I am too."
Lestrade could help it. Three more people went missing and four killed themselves. Again. Why was Lestrade just sitting here complaining about his work overload and lack of sleep when there were people being kidnapped and having their memories taken away from them?
“Sherlock, the dollar bill was in the plastic bag, right?”
Sherlock groaned in disgust as he thought of Mycroft actually finding out who the woman is, because if he did then that meant he owes his brother; and he knows that you never want to owe Mycroft.
Sherlock went to the mirror and stared at himself. His eyes were clouded and his hair a mess. He was bony and pale. He grimaced in disgust.
Once they had left- throwing Sherlock dirty looks and even some curse words with inappropriate hand gestures- he got to work. He pulled out his magnifying glass out of his coat and checked each crevice of the register. He knew things would be covered up by other people's hand prints and being cleaned by the janitors, but it was still worth a look.
He moaned and paced around the two chairs, still in his pajamas and blue, thin, silk robe. His hair was messed up and his face was cleanly shaven from any hairs. He looked paler and skinnier, somehow and John was staring at his pacing body from the kitchen where he stood with a frown decorating his face.
(See the end of the chapter for
the message read, ‘it won't be the first time you died’
“Yes, I'm fully aware of who you mean. Though I don't desire to anecdote or speak about him. I'm just eager to get back to Baker Street and continue to search for the missing.” Sherlock frowned and looked back ahead of him.
‘Foot size- eight’ Molly wrote on a clipboard.
The loud sound of bottles, pens, and papers made Molly's head jerk towards the room Sherlock was in.
There were many people out in this world who will do about anything for money, which is what one daughter did. She killed her parents and two siblings before going out to collect her money from her boyfriend, who killed her after she asked for the money. Sherlock has gone through many cases and solved all the above. One took him almost a week, but he surpassed it.
“John.” Sherlock whispered.
He was blonde with camouflage jeans and a worn out white tank top. He had on combat boots that were the peach colour of sand and messy yet neat hair. His face was unknown as the camera faced his back and his body covered up John halfway from view.
He frowned and stood up, pulling on Dylan's arms to haul him up to his feet. Sherlock looked at Lestrade before he nodded.
"Fine. That's fine." Sherlock cold spat at Lestrade. Anger dripping from his words, he continued. "It's all fine to you, isn't it. Americans are involved in this too."
“No.”
down his nose and chin.
“We found more information and more people are missing as others come back.” Donovan said in a low voice, keeping her eyes glued to Lestrade. “And a woman.”
“I thought you would too.”
"Are you sure this woman is involved with the kidnapping of John Watson, brother?"
Sherlock put down the magnifying glass and went to the counters in the lab. He opened a drawer and pulled out a bag to put any discoverings in before he went back to the smelling bag. Grimacing due to the strong smell, he turned on the light above him and aimed it directly into the bag for better lighting.He narrowed his eyes and looked around, frowning when a shine reflected the light for a fraction of a second. Sherlock closed his eyes and moved slightly side to side to see if he could see the light again, which he did. He stopped at a specific angle where the light hit the source and reached out to grab it. Once he knew his fingers grasped it he pulled it out and brought it inches from his face, his eyes widened from the object.
“Nowhere near you. So shut up and give me the the address.” Sherlock shot back, narrowing his eyes slightly.
“Yes, he's miss.”
“Just tell me where John was last.” Sherlock spoke in a soft, silent tone. He looked around Lestrade before making eye contact with him again. His eyes softened and his fist untangled.
He let go of the wheel and looked to Sherlock, who was looking back at Lestrade.
Lestrade cocked his eyebrow before clearing his throat, stopping in front of her. Once she registered there was someone in front of her she looked up. Her eyes had dark half moons under them and her blue eyes were fogged. Her hair wasn't a mess, but it wasn't exactly neat.
Sherlock crumpled the bag in his fight fist.
“A bloody Hobbit?"
“You'll get your answers in the case.” Mycroft replied silently, almost a whisper.
He remembers! Wait? He remembers?
“Why?”
“I figured something out. SHERLOCK!” John harshly whispered and leaned in closer to Sherlock's ear with a frown on his face.
“Okay," Sherlock forcefully relaxed his fists, clenching and unclenching them repeatedly, "I’ll try to focus on something that I won’t snap your head at.”
“Look at the pictures of the corpses of the people who had been kidnapped. It's there, I promise and guarantee you it's there.”
All the people who had been taken were kept and stored away from the world by the abductor before suddenly being brought back to the world and placed with their families again. The thing that had made Sherlock quite interested in is that the victim has no memory of their abductors face, voice, or location. Not even the smell.
He had been looking over London's security footage with Mycroft before Sherlock had come in and ruined it. They were trying to find any suspicious cars or people over the cameras, but there was nothing that could lead them.
"It's okay Sherlock... just know I'm sorry."
Lestrade, with the tape in his right hand, left a grumpy and frustrated Sherlock at the flat. The next day rolled on by and Sherlock didn't bother to dress out of his sleepwear, not that he even got sleep, but he did get a syringe that was hidden away after years of neglect.
“Well, neither do I!”
Sherlock grabbed Dylan's shirt and revealed his collarbone. The symbol that he had been told about from Molly was on his collarbone too.
He inhaled and exhaled sharply, eyes darting open and his pupils widening. Of course. It
The man laughed and turned around and stared straight at the camera, a cold smile on his face.
Lestrade sat down in the seat in front of the computer and inserted the tape into the VCR. He hooked up the VCR to the computer and jumped when the screen turned black instead or the blue scream that said ‘no signal’.
Nothing.
She cocked an eyebrow and looked bored along with suspicious.
"What?" Sherlock's smirk stretched into a smile as he reminisced about his insult in the last conversation they had. "It was funny. You should've seen his face. He couldn't hide the shock because the cake he was eating required both hands!"
Sherlock looked so at John, who was mirroring Sherlock's serious face. His eyebrows set at a light frown and his eyes uncertain, yet bold.
The hum of a vehicle whispers in my ears. I pay no mind to it and continue to look ahead of me, my hands in my lap and my eyes possibly droopy. My lips are pressed together, my mouth then is definitely not open, and my feet feel dead. No, I'm just not moving them, that's all. I haven't moved in the last forty five minutes and actually don't plan on doing so either. I don't want to disturb the peace that I
“Anderson," Lestrade said as he looked over at a wide eyed Anderson. "This is the security tape from a week ago." Lestrade groaned and copied Sherlocks position of pinching the space between his eyebrows in disappointment.
Sherlock looked at Lestrade.
“Oh quit it!” Mycroft exclaimed, picking Sherlock with the tip of his black umbrella. He settled in the client's chair and continued to stare at Sherlock, who started to slowly slide down his chair.
"John? What's wrong?”
Sherlock slammed the file of the cashier in the table and his phone following it soon after. He looked up at Lestrade and stepped back, his cold eyes making contact with the Detective Inspector.
“Moriarty is clever. Smarter than you and your,” He scrunched up his face and pretend to squash an imaginary man in his hands, “stupid, older brother combined.”
He rest his chin on Mrs. Hudson's left shoulder and let the tears silently fall. He hadn't cried in ages and he didn't want to change that. The last time he cried was when mycroft had called him a disgrace to the Holmes last name, but that was when he was ten. He was now twenty four years old.
Lestrade sighed harshly and narrowed his eyes on the Consulting Detective.
"Oh it's all fine anyways. People die all the time. What makes me so different Molly?"
That's only Sherlock in her head.
I wonder if I look dead. Like I lost the will to live. Maybe I've lost a little bit of weight and look too pale, maybe a little to dirty too. I wonder if my eyes still look the same before this all happened. Light and filled with a powerful will. I wonder if that's dead. I wonder if I'm dead. Am I still alive at this point?
“My sister?” John asked with a small voice that sounded about ready to crack and eyes that pleaded for it to not be the truth. Sadly, Lestrade nodded and sighed.
“Good morning little brother.”
Lestrade pulled over and stopped the car, putting his hand on Sherlock's arm to prevent him from leaving the car. Sherlock looked at the DI’s hand before looking at Lestrade himself. He took his hand off of the door handle of the car and placed it on his lap as he continued to stare at Lestrade.
Who the hell is that?
Mycroft paused.
“How did you find this?” Sherlock asked quietly.
As much as it hurt to look and pretend he didn't care, he did. He always has cared for everything that has done something good in his life. It's just reminded him of Redbeard.
Before him stood the man he cared about the most. The one that helped him through so many things, including depression and suicide.
“I'm a Consulting Detective! Sherlock Holmes! THE Sherlock Holmes! Move aside because I work WITH Scotland Yard and I can either play nice with you, or play dirty. Your choice.” Sherlock argued back with clenched fists. Really, he had enough of him. That stupid manager and his horrible cologne.
Sherlock had been a wreck since John had left. He had tantrums that only John had known how to handle and Sherlock was in a downright mood swing up in his room. He was just too confused and lost in this case that he spent all his time, thinking, up in his mind palace.
He looked around and spotted a blonde woman sitting in the chairs that were pushed against the wall.
She looked down at the doorstep and found a package. Mrs. Hudson bent down and grabbed it, tucking it under her arm as she walked back into the flat and closing the door behind her. She tilted the box at all directions and found a name.
“Pictures?”
“Stop saying that Sherlock! For God's sake, he is here! He's at the flat right now- wait, no he isn't- he's right there!” Lestrade pointed behind Sherlock, who turned to follow his fingers direction.
“Are you sure you want to watch this?” Lestrade asked again as Sherlock put the disk in the telly.
“Sherlock.”
It wasn't fair.
“Johns,” Sherlock says and presses his lips together as he looked around the room painfully. “It’s Johns.”
“Without their memories of who they were before Mrs. Hudson. John's not gonna remember Sherlock or you when he comes back, that's why Sherlock is having such a hard time with it. John won't have a ‘Sherlock Holmes’ in his memories anymore.” Lestrade explained to her in a hushed whisper as Mrs. Hudson looked between Lestrade and Sherlock with worried glances.
“You're not the only man on Earth that gets bored Sherlock. I thought you oughta know that by now.”
Three minutes later the manager was being put into a police car and Sherlock was checking the camera footage with a slightly red mark on his cheek.
“You know what this means?” Sherlock quietly asked Lestrade, who had moved his hands so he could look at Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson's smile faltered when she heard no movement. She was about to turn around when she heard the muffled noise of his mattress. Her smile came back when sounds of movement was heard.
"Whose flat is this, exactly?" Molly asked as she jogged up behind Sherlock. They were in the kitchen at this point and Sherlock was looking at the photos on the refrigerator. He barely glanced at her before humming in thought. He was clearly annoyed.
The man laughed and removed his hand from John's face.
"Yes, I am." Sherlock said sternly to his brother once the shock that Anthea was there the whole time faded away.
“The handwriting is Johns.”
There was silence in the alleyway that Molly stood in and in the room Sherlock shook in. The papers were now crumbled in his hands and his eyes shut to block out the voices in his head. They always were too loud nowadays without John to shut him up.
“Yes, yes, I know. But I have one more thing to tell you before I hang up and get back to work.”
“Nonsense Sherlock. Shoo! Go!” She lightly swatted at Sherlock's arm and moved out of the way so he could walk to the kitchen, which he did.
“I'll tell you if or when you calm down. And for God’s sake Sherlock, it's nine forty seven in the night and I just want some sleep for once.”
John interrupted, a calm yet hardened look on his face.
"Well have you told Mycroft?"
Sherlock threw the papers into the air and swiftly flung himself out of his chair and into the kitchen. He sighed and grabbed a coffee cup before filling it with hot tea that John had recently relearned to do. John had ran to Sherlock, carrying a cup of fresh tea, and shoved in his face with a face splitting smile when he learned.
Molly took deep breaths in to help calm her racing heart before she continued.
“Little brother.” He said with a smile as he made his way to sit in John's seat. He looked around and slightly grimaced from the sight before looking at his younger brother.
Harriet's body had been found by a woman who always ran along the trail, and on this damp and cloudy day just managed to stumble across her dead body. She had screamed and immediately called the police, having to be told how to calm down before she hyperventilate.
“Goodbye Lestrade.” Sherlock unlocked the door and pulled the door handle, opening the door in one quick motion.
“Leave it open. Go over to the car's and we'll be with you shortly.”
“How?”
Sherlock also realized and deduced that Mycroft had taken his phone due to the way he hid his hand from sherlock when he left, he didn’t hold the stairwell which he normally did, he didn’t use his right hand to hold his umbrella when walking, and he used his left hand to open the door. Mycroft also had the face that said he stole something and wasn't planning on giving it back.
They ascended up the stairs as quietly as they could manage, Lestrade staring at the back of Mycroft Holmes. He frowned and wondered how much this had affected the elder Holmes. Sherlock has seemed to go out of his mind for some unknown reason. Lestrade and Mycroft hadn't had a clue as to what could have driven Sherlock to be how he's like now. Maybe the case had gotten to him more than he thought it would.
(See the end of the chapter for
And now he's missing.
“The cash was in the bag.”
Lestrade's shoulders dropped in disbelief as Sherlock continued to smile and laugh. He supposed the insult was worth it because Lestrade hadn't seen Sherlock smile or laugh for about four months. Maybe five.
She frowned and moved closer to the woman, pulling the woman's hair out of the way by the pencil she was holding. Her eyes widened and her jaw fell open.
Once the two calmed down Sherlock had already opened the package and was about to pull out whatever it held inside. Lestrade moved closer and Mrs. Hudson eyed the box with a curious and worried look.
John smiled and gently pushed Sherlock away so he could look at him too. Sherlock laughed and smiled more than he had in years. John joined and slightly frowned.
John enjoyed Sherlock.
“Oh shit!” Lestrade exclaimed as he realised the light was green. He slammed on the gas pedal and the car jerked forward. He looked in the rear view mirror and raised his hand to apologise to the people who were honking behind him. He awkwardly put his hand down and stared ahead of him again.
“I knew he was. I thought Moriarty would've done something more to him than take memories. Memories can be easily remade.” Sherlock frowned in confusion as the man smiled and laughed.
John Hamish Watson.
Sherlock blamed him for not being able to fight back. It was so unfair. Yes, John knew himself he didn't remember anything about Sherlock or anyone else he had ever met before, but that didn't mean he didn't try to get them back. John knew he had to be that guy who doesn't go down easily. He was always as stubborn as Sherlock in someway.
He slammed his fist down on the table.
But then again, this happened a few days ago, so Sherlock didn't know why he kept thinking and replaying the memory.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes at the blonde man.
"You're wrong, that's not John. Just-"
"No.”
Sherlock pulled out a bag.
As he had looked through a file he found the name ‘Anderson’ and had literally put a picture of Anderson on the was with a drawn on mustache, monocle, and flower had.
Sherlock scoffed as John had climbed into the back of the cab seat before shutting the door. John raised his eyebrow at Sherlock as he turned to look at him all the while buckling his seatbelt.
“So?” Sherlock scoffed and frowned at Lestrade with a look that said ‘Do I look like I care?’ Oh yeah, no.
Molly ran around the halls, files and papers and pens in her hands as she quickly went from one person to the next. She had been the major part of the autopsy reports and she still had yet to fail.
He clutched his coffee cup even harder than before, impressed that the styrofoam hadn't broken from the pressure, and climbed to the top of the stairs where Mycroft had just stopped at. The door was closed, which sent alarms ringing in Lestrade’s head as the door was never closed.
“Not anymore.” Sherlock added quickly, still staring ahead of him.
He was so stupid. How did he not check the bag? It’s not his division to check the bloody bag, that’s why!
She released his hand and let it fall limp by her side. She looked around, still grinning her face off, before she spoke again.
“What point are you trying to come across Lestrade?” Sherlock said in a slightly agitated voice.
"Well, judging on the pain in my leg, shoulder, and collarbone, It'd be safe to say that yes, you really are here to do exactly that." He flared with fury and she laughed it off. It sound as if she were a popular high schooler laughing ridiculously at the victim she just insulted.
Lestrade hadn’t planned his day to end up like this, him and Sherlock on the couch about to watch a video that came from Johns captors. Why, he should’ve made some popcorn for the two of them to share!
"What do you want me to do with this?"
Sherlock stared at the screen, his mind comprehending what had just happened and what his eyes had seen.
“Yeah?! Maybe because one has!” Donovan spat back. Lestrade growled and clenched his hands to fists. He had enough of her bloody attitude throughout the years he's been working at the station. He deserved a little more respect.
John Watson didn't exist to Sherlock Holmes anymore.
Okay, great. And?
“A drunk woman.”
"He's saying 'was' not 'is'-" Lestrade started.
“Please! Quit it!” John yelled and tried to snatch another arm.
“Here we go.” Sherlock mumbled when the screen showed a date. The same date when John was first taken.
Lestrade had of course remembered all the things and stories John had shared with him about Sherlock. John had to force Sherlock to eat and sleep normally and sometimes to even bathe. John smiled and chuckled when he told these stories and called Sherlock crazy and insane, but he liked it.
Sherlock snapped a couple of pictures at different angles, ignoring the confused and disgusted looks from shoppers around him.
"Well he's not Molly. Is he?" Sherlock snapped loudly with acid dripping from his words, burning Molly when they reached her ears. She flinched and made a face to the brick wall opposite from her. Why did I forget?
“It doesn't have to do with you remembering it has to do with you not fighting!”
“You should stop.”
"I'm sorry, Sherlock. I honestly did forget about that. I'm just so used to him being here that I forgot that he wasn't. I just thought that when you came for me he was still at the flat-"
“I know where John was last seen-”
“No. I have a promise to fulfill. Good night Detective Inspector.”
Good.
John said with a harsh voice.
“Okay, calm down. I told Harriet or Harry, that all we found was a bag with a bloody dollar bill in it. She blew up and started cursing her head off, saying she'll get everyone who had to do with this.”
‘The cash is in the bag’
“Oh my god.” Lestrade whispered.
“Molly, have you told Sherlock yet?”
(See the end of the chapter for
"Keep your composure steady, brother mine. This is how people will learn that you're fine with them walking all over you. But it seems you've been giving people that message for seven months now."
"Look." Sherlock was going to slide the photo to Lestrade on his table, but remembered what tragedy had happened to it so he instead handed it to Lestrade after he had wiped himself from coffee. Although his hands were clean, he didn't bother to clean his face from the liquid so it still dripped
Lestrade smirked and looked back up to look at his door as the noise and commotion had gotten louder. His smirk faded and was replaced with a frown, his fist on the phone tightened.
Interesting, Really. Sherlock started to adore and get a liking for this case. He would have to find the man who abducts these people and returns them with absolutely no memory of him whatsoever. The only problem is- where is he to start?
John, unknowing on what to do, watched as he threw his tantrum and stomped in circles around the two chairs that were John's and Sherlocks.
He spun around quickly with wide eyes, completely freaked out. His knees bent so he was lower than he originally was and he screamed ‘Mycroft!’ In a whisper.
He closed his eyes and exhaled a deep breath. Something was missing. It was all wrong. All weird. Something was missing. Missing.
"Memories are easily made Sherlock, isn't that what you had said?"
People were running around with papers and coffee mugs in hands. Others were on the phone with panic written all over their faces. In fact, everyone's face had a worried expression.
“Are you stupid! Jesus! You've really lost the game now!” The man wailed and shoved Sherlock back towards the ledge the man had been sitting on.
“Really? Haven't noticed.” He bit sarcastically.
“No! Where is it!”
‘Johnlock forever!’ He'd say.
“No, obviously.”
Mycroft placed his umbrella by the closed door and placed his hand on the knob, twisting it to the left and pushing it open. The two men went inside and looked around the silent flat. Sherlock wasn't anywhere to be seen and as far as Lestrade and Mycroft knew, John was still missing.
“Arse.”
"Leave. Her. Out. Of. This." Sherlock barked and slammed his fists on the desk. "You're only job right now is to find that woman!"
“He never mentioned a sister and I've never deduced or heard of it! Who is she and why the bloody hell isn't she here trying to help us find her brother?!” Sherlock looked more irritated and worn out than Lestrade. His hair was a mess, which never happened on Sherlock's account, and he had dark half moons under his tired, wary, clouded eyes. His skin was paler too and he looked skinnier. His face was caved in more than normally and his eyes looked darker than before.
Once again, he slipped through his fingers.
“But I do. I know tons about you.” He raised an eyebrow and walked around Sherlock very slowly.
His mind had only gotten darker as the days passed. He had no new information so he couldn't do anything. He had been walking around London and thought about how things would be when John came back, since Sherlock already knew he was too late. He couldn't do anything about John's memories and would only have to make more.
“Well not everyone can be John, now can we?” Sherlock had once snapped at her from his position on his chair.
Harry had gotten over being drunk and suffered a mild headache due to the painkillers that they gave her. When she was actually self aware of what she was doing and saying she was a lot more like John than Lestrade thought. She was nice, quite smart, a little bit short -around John height-, and she was homosexual.
“Does it sound like he had a person in the bag? Does it sound like he kidnapped John Watson?”
She pulled out a folded paper and put it in front of her on the table, out of John's reach. John relaxed his strained neck and curled his toes to pop them. He eyes the paper wearily as she continued to smile at him. Her red nails scraped along the paper as she stared at him flirtatiously.
"Alright. Fine. Have it your way...." he squint as he wracked his brain for an answer he has been told many times before. "....Graham?"
“The blonde is in the bag.”
“You didn’t order for her to be released?” John asked quietly, with a shocked face before it scrunched back up into anger and fury again, “Then who did?!”
It had already been a month since John's disappearance. How did a couple of days turn into a month? Sherlock had remembered going into the store like it were only two hours ago.
Sherlock took a picture or the cash register and conveyor belt with his mobile before pocketing it again. His eyes trailed to the ground and he realised it too had marking upon it that weren't there before when he checked.
“And we're here for you, Sherlock!” Lestrade said sternly as he gripped Sherlock's arm harder. Sherlock stopped, his leg was already out of the car and he faced away from Lestrade. He stared at 221B Baker Street's door, pondering on the multiple ways he could escape, and the multiple things that he could say. Either it was leave, or stay.
“And he's gone?”
Sherlock stepped on all the papers to go into his room. He turned the knob of the door, opening it barely and crack, and kicking it open so hard it hit the wall and bounced right back to where Sherlock's foot had been, missing it due to Sherlock stomping into the room before it touched the wall. He looked around his room from the middle of it and sighed in frustration. Nothing could keep up with his mind at the moment, not even science.
“Well, here I am trusting you.”
“It was me, I gave to order to release Harriet Watson.”
"Because of a phone call I received not too long ago."
He groaned and ran his hands down his face.
Sherlock sank to his knees in the middle of the common room and wrapped his arms around himself. He couldn't breathe and his eyesight was blurry due to the wind blowing in them when he was sprinting. Or maybe it wasn't the air at all.
“You know what? Go ahead and try to solve this with him," Anderson pointed angrily towards Sherlock. "He's a mess boss! Look at him! He won't do any good with his pet missing!"
“Let's hope that's true.” Lestrade mumbled as Mrs. Hudson moved out of the way to allow both men inside. She shut the door behind them once the two had entered and pointed upstairs and mouthed, ‘he's upstairs sulking’ before she left.
He grabbed his coffee mug and poured it onto the tape, distinguishing the fire. He panted and looked dazed as he looked over to Sherlock with wide eyes.
Lestrade sighed and raised his eyebrows. He looked over to Sherlock, who was slightly frowning and staring ahead of him and into the rain.
“Okay,” Sherlock mumbled as he looked back at the large black bag on the table in front of him. “Don't be surprised if I’m gone b the time you get back.”
The screen turned white and a black box was in the middle of the screen before it widened and took over the whole screen itself, earning a ‘what the crap’ from Lestrade.
The door opened and footsteps echoed in the quiet room. They stopped right in front of John and stopped. The screech of a chair roughly gliding on the unwaxed floor made John jolt, and as quickly as he jolted he went back to the unconscious composure hoping that the man in front of him didn't see it.
"Pick it up if it bothers you so much."
Lestrade walked slowly down the dark hall and looked around with wary eyes, his hands no longer held his coffee cup as he set it down on the table in the kitchen. His breathing could be heard, even and quiet.
Mycroft had taken his leave when Sherlock kept glaring at him and kept looking around and clearing his throat.
He's done miracles for Sherlock. He made him quit doing drugs and eat, sleep, bathe, and care. The blonde had also given him a miracle no one had ever wanted to do for him in his whole life. So simple yet so strong.
“Doubtful.”
Then again, it's like when Mr. Hudson had been arrested. She didn't say she should let it go and help him. No. She left.
"Confused, Lestrade... I'm confused."
“Well then,” Mycroft said as he looked at the top of the stairs, sighing in the process. “Shall we?”
"I know...."
"Well, you awake or do you wanna play this game? I can play it, but I don't think you'll like the rules with it."
Lestrade picked up the file of the pictures, opened it and flipped through them. He had kept the file on his desk since Sherlock came in and slammed it on his desk with his phone. Sherlock had then, after he showed and explained the pictures he found and brought to Lestrade, shown the footage to him.
relationship with the man whatsoever and he would attack the people with deductions about themselves that were embarrassing and left them red before he asked them the same questions, smile, say ‘exactly’, and leave with his coat flapping dramatically behind him.
Lestrade sighed. This was something that he didn't exactly want to deal with right now, but had to because she had new information that could help the case.
“John, I need your input on something.”
“Who's we? There could be multiple ‘we’s. Don't tell me it was Donovan or Anderson because they're idiots and couldn't even tell if something pink had been turned to black.”
Sherlock hailed a cab and told the address to the driver through clenched teeth. His jaw was sore from how much pressure he put on it, but he didn't care. John was suffering more than he was for all he knew.
"Yes, actually." Sherlock replied looking over his shoulder and he put his left leg through the window. He looked back at the window and frowned in concentration as he slid his lower half through the opening. His foot touched a solid platform on the other side and his lip twitched into a small smirk as he shimmied in.
“Sherlock? Who are you talking to dear?”
“Sherlock!” She called from the door, “It's a pigsty in here! You should clean up after yourself you know! I'm your landlord, not housemaid!” She yelled from the bathroom before rushing out and into the kitchen.
He smirked and turned his head to look at Sherlock, mocking the detective with an almost drunk and satisfied look.
Sherlock would run to the stairs and wait there if that was what the letter was about. And every time the door opened he'd fling his arms open wide and smile.
He furrowed his eyebrows as he flicked through the pages and the pictures again. They all had blue eyes and no children. He managed to find that out sixteen minutes ago when he first looked at it, but wanted to make sure he was correct.
John's eyes opened quickly as his mind tried to comprehend what he just heard. A woman?
The man mocked as he leaned
Sherlock wouldn't just stand back and allow John to have his memories plucked out of his mind. He wouldn't let anyone hurt or take John away from Sherlock unless it was for happiness.
John frowned and jerked his head to her closer to the image. The person didn't seem familiar to him at all. He tried to get closer to see if he could identify anything on the person, but everything had come up either short or empty handed. He felt something off in his mind but he decided to leave and forget it.
"You don't know whose flat this is?" Sherlock shook his head with a silent 'I just said that.'
Molly had just finished with an autopsy and was on her way to deliver it to her own office or room before she went to finish another one, and another, then another. This was just how her days had been since word got out that people had gone missing and then put back.
“Officer, I swear it's not what it looks like! It wasn't me!”
‘Tidy and a grooming freak.’
“Seriously?! None?! Nada?!”
"Who? Why do you need to look at our register? What case are you on?”
“He still owes me two milk cartons.”
"'Look her up or something?' Really Lestrade?"
"JOHN!”
“I don't know sher-”
“All love has been forgotten.”
“Yes, John still has his mind and had written this in somewhat of a hurry. The paper is old and worn down, so John is in a old and worn down place. His hand was shivering as he wrote this so he must know what's going on and what's going to happen to him-”
"He's not. It's all lost-"
Sherlock held himself back, knowing that three strides was all it could take to get to the man and bash his head in. John had relied on Sherlock to find and get him and he was at Baker Street drinking tea and staring at a bloody useless paper. John was out there, hurting and confused, and Sherlock was in here, staring at a television screen and yelling.
There was a twitch in Sherlock's lip.
“Haven’t you heard of not trusting strangers?”
He looked around and spotted a blonde woman sitting in the chairs that were pushed against the wall. He looked around, checking to see if anyone was coming to get her before making his way towards her.
“The missing Jay? What, the bird?”
"Yes."
John wasn't light, but he wasn't heavy. It would a little bit of strength to carry the blonde.
“That's it?” Lestrade's chest puffed out as he huffed a dry laugh. He quickly looked around the room before looking back at the man in front of him.
"The blondes in the bag Sherlock!"
He was a lump of flesh and loose pajama clothes on his chair. His walls weren't any better either. If someone were to walk in and have a glance at the walls, they'd think there was a mad man living there. There were pictures and thumbtacks and string littered everywhere on the wall. Pictures of missing people and where they were taken and what people are suspicious.
Molly heard pages flipping through the phone and her smile widened. She had done something that could be told to Sherlock. To Sherlock. He would, no, he has to be impressed with Molly. He would smile and say ‘Good job. Be my wife’. Molly then sighed. No. That's not Sherlock.
“Sherlock.”
“Sod off.”
The radio on the car came on and Harriet's voice came through.
“The blondes in the bag. The cash is in the bag.”
Stomping on the stairs was heard from the top of it, through the closed door, and into Sherlock's ears. He sat on his chair with his violin in his arms, slowly plucking at the strings.
“What?” Sherlock had calmed himself down but was still smiling with a slight frown coming on.
Molly scribbled the rest of the information in a flash, not caring if she misspelled a word or two. She darted out the room, her lab coat flapping behind her. If the collar was popped up she could have felt like Sherlock.
He groaned and looked away from the lamp as it blinded him from the imaginary colours that had swarm into his sight. He was in a crouched position in his chair and his arms wrapped around his knees. He glared at the lamp and his window curtains were closed, blocking out all the light in the flat.
And it clearly wasn't.
“John…”
"Sherlock Holmes is dead."
Like John did.
“The blonde-”
Sherlock stopped and stared at John with hard and furious eyes, locked with fearful and confused eyes.
Sherlock looked more recovered and better than yesterday when Lestrade had last saw him. His hair was neat again and his trench coat and scarf didn't have wrinkles anymore.
And that someone was Anderson.
Yeah, Sherlock had received several other texts after he left Lestrade. He finally got annoyed with the buzzing of his phone and went to check them.
“What?” Sherlock snapped and turned to his right to face John who was crouched down on the side of Sherlock's bed with his pajamas on too.
“Yes. Anything else mummy?”
‘Military’
“How long Sherlock, How long?”
"The cashier.”
Sherlock stopped pacing and looked at John, who was staring back at him with concern in his eyes. Sherlock sighed and frowned at John. He’d suddenly grown nicer to Sherlock since the yelling competition he and Lestrade had the day before.
Again.
“Goodbye!” Sherlock yelled and somehow played the note louder. Mycroft clicked his tongue against his teeth and walked downstairs. He said goodbye to Mrs Hudson and left, smirking slightly as he walked down the streets of London.
It was quiet in the flat, other than the people and cars outside and the fan he had bought to make some noise so he would feel less-
John grabbed his coat and left the flat, putting it on as dramatically as Sherlock did.
She had gotten a call from Lestrade that Sherlock was getting impatient with this case and he needed more information on it. Sherlock had wanted to come and work on the autopsies with Molly, but Lestrade and his team needed Sherlock at the station more than here in the labs.
“Sherlock, this package doesn't have an address to where or who it came from. I'll let you see it if you come and fill your tummy with food and water.” Mrs. Hudson said in a song tune.
He dated it back to when John had come into the shop and he watched it. Three minutes into the tape Sherlock fast forward it to around nine fifty at night and saw John enter. Sherlock switches his gaze to each camera as he followed John as he shopped. The store was about empty as two couples and one woman went around and shopped. By the time John was done they had left.
He quickly got up after seconds of processing what had happened and headed for the stairs, putting on his coat to look somewhat decent. He ruffled his still damp curly hair as he made his way down the stairs. He gripped the doorknob and swung open the door to find a…
“There is no love in war.”
Retard.
“Christ, it’s John.” Lestrade whispered and sat up straighter, leaning in along with Sherlock.
Mrs. Hudson had retreated back into her flat after hearing the commotion the Holmes brothers had made. Once John had shown them that Sherlock was in his room, the two men had kept knocking on the door and telling him to come out.
She had dark blue trousers on, short blonde hair that went to her shoulders, a skin tight, yellow green shirt that outlined her flat stomach, with some running shoes on. Her head was down and she slouched in the chair, making it impossible to see her face.
He was pretty sure she had called Lestrade after that, because he got a text from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Can you help me get up into the flat?" Molly asked quietly after five minutes of silence.
Sherlock yelled, screaming so loud and hard that he curled up in on himself and squeezed his eyes shut, his mouth widened at an alarming rate.
“Hi.” She said to a slightly shocked Lestrade. He shook his head before he smiled himself and shook the blondes hand.
“Apparently, yes I am! It's not my fault! I'm sorry I don't remember anything!”
Lestrade gave an emotionless dry chuckle oth the phone.
Lestrade grabbed her arm to stop her from throwing another punch to the cashier. Her eyes blazed with fury and her breath heaved. She glared the man down before taking the bag with Johns ripped piece of his jumper from the outstretched hand.
Sherlock pulled his gloves out and put them on, releasing the glove with a slap on his wrist.
“NOW!” Lestrade and Harry yelled at the man, earning a surprised yelp and jump.
“I don't know and I hate not knowing.”
Until Sherlock kicked open the door.
“And look, that man looks nothing like John! Look at him Anderson!" Lestrade pointed to the screen as he rewind it to the part where a blonde man was being escorted to a black limousine.
“Oh?”
“A woman, uh- Sally? Sally-”
"I figured something out. SHERLOCK!” John harshly whispered and leaned in closer to Sherlock's ear with a frown on his face.
"Stop acting childish. I'm helping you, aren't I? Be grateful I even allowed you to step foot into the building."
"You know what i think Sherlock?”
"Then why are we here?"
Anderson pointed harshly with his eyes wide open to the blonde man getting into the limousine again.
“Have you got any more information about the case from the bodies?”
The men made their way towards the flat and knocked three times. Mycroft looked up at the window to see if Sherlock was peeking out, and to his dismay, we wasn't. Mycroft sighed quietly as he thought about when Sherlock did look through the window. He would usually yell at John that he was here and then hide in his room until John forced him out, then Sherlock would continue to throw glares at Mycroft and hiss at him whenever he got too close to him.
Lestrade made his way through the doors and entered the main hall. It was more like a mall, it was quite huge.
“Do not waste your time fretting over my little brother, Mrs. Hudson,” Mycroft forced a smile and bend over slightly so he was around her height. “He will come around soon.”
“Not when someone's life depends on it!”
After Sherlock, Lestrade, and Mrs. Hudson had watched the tape Lestrade took his leave with a sorrowful nod and a soft pat on Sherlock's back, along with a promise to try to bring him back and do a double check on the files so far.
John put his fingertips on Sherlock's back before slowly drawing circles on his back with his whole hand. Sherlock immediately stopped pulling his curls, slightly straightened his back and widened his eyes.
John sat there and did nothing. Absolutely nothing. It wasn’t until there was a dull bang when John looked up, eyes quickly searching the room before he visibly relaxed again. He sighed and slumped his shoulders and threw his head back in either annoyance or uncertainty. John didn’t know whether or not he’d leave that place.
Perfectly shaved haircut and jaw.
She scribbled what she saw on the collarbone of the woman. It was some weird symbol, one that Molly had never seen before. It was faint and had to be looked at very closely to see it.
He sighed and ran his fingers through his hair. His leg kept bouncing as he looked out the window. His eyes scanned everything, unable to keep focus and look at one thing at a time.
Well, here's yet another chapter as promised. It's getting quite interesting and fun to write now, so yeah.... ONWARDS!!!!
“Yeah, but can't you deduce something out of it?” Lestrade raised his eyebrow and looked at Sherlock with hope and frustration.
“You're overestimating the ability of deduction. If I had been able to do it with this case don't you think I would've done it by now? I don't know what this letter could mean and I want to find out as much as you do but there's only so much that I can do and handle. I may not act like it, but I'm a bloody human Lestrade. There are things I don't and won't know.” Sherlock snapped.
Fantastic.
He threw his mobile across the room and stared at where it landed on the floor, the phone was opened and lit.
“But there is one thing I could deduct from this letter.” Sherlock mumbled deeply in the silence as he stared at the letter in his hand.
“What?” Mycroft said, acting slightly shocked at the news.
John was in the bag, wasn't he?
“Ye-”
The coffee came out of Lestrade's mouth and nose. He spit the coffee across his table and the coffee slowly and painfully dripped down Lestrade's nostrils down to his chin.
He was close, so close to finding John, but of course, the static had to come and screw up everything. The footage had cleared from the static and showed the cashier by the door with a black bag. The bag was large, a large black bag. Large. Black bag.
John had always denied to being homosexual, but Irene Adler had gotten him to say he was slightly bisexual. Ever since then, she's always been smirking around John when he looked at Sherlock, even when he was talking to Sherlock.
“MAXIMUM BACKUP! I NEED MAXIMUM BACKUP!” Sherlock yelled at his phone as he sprinted down the street to the the flat where John was.
A silence filled the room as the two men in the room breathed harshly and glared each other down. If looks could kill, Lestrade would be only a blob of flesh and Sherlock would be decapitated with his limbs torn off.
John was missing.
Lestrade had been somewhat of a help because he tried to get all of the Inspectors off Sherlock's back and return to work, but they usually just pretend to go back to work and wait until Lestrade left to resume his own work before they went back to the consulting detective again. Sherlock was irritated when they did that and he'd threaten them with deductions he has made.
“Me, sir.” A young brunette man came up with his hand raised to his shoulder. He was slightly taller than John and had groomed hair underneath his dark blue hat. His badge shone in the grey light and his pale face was filled with uncertainty and slight fear.
“Just… I don't….”
The black screen went to a room that was empty besides a chair in the middle. In that chair sat a man with his head hung low to his chest, his hands behind his back and his ankles tied. There was no sound but the breathing of the man, the blonde man.
“You carry the umbrella.” Sherlock had said as he shoved the umbrella into Lestrade's chest before they left Sherlock's flat to go to the funeral.
The cashier.
Sherlock stared at his dark blue eyes as John stared back at him, confused and slightly relieved. Before Sherlock knew his arms were thrown around John and his face was hidden in John's neck. He staggered backwards a little but had caught himself before anything could happen that involved pavement.
“This isn’t healthy.” John whispered to himself and walked up behind Sherlock, who was now gripping his head and pulling his curls.
His dog had been the precious thing in his life that kept him going. That dog had done miracles for Sherlock and Sherlock had done miracles for that dog.
“Sherlock, that's it.”
“And fire.”
“No dear, you know I don't like ordering things online. I don't know how to do anything, really. It's all just too complicated.” She nodded and slightly frowned as Lestrade looked over at her. “And too pricey.”
“Moriarty is clever. Smarter than you and your,” He scrunched up his face and pretend to squash an imaginary man in his hands, “stupid, older brother combined.”
An echo of a door slamming shut was heard throughout the silent hallway just beyond the door. He relaxed his muscles again and pretend to he back to being limp, as if he hadn't woken up and knew exactly what was going to happen. He slowed his breathing even more to keep from hyperventilating at the fact that he didn't know where he was and what they'd do next.
"Don't, it'll only make me more encouraged to do more stupid activities on my spare time."
Sherlock looked at the box of evidence in the corner of Lestrade office before looking back at Lestrade.
“Yes, you're a bloody dragon because of how tall and long you are. Plus, I've always imagined dragons having deep voices and you're just SOOO lucky to be born with a natural deep voice, that it just seemed to fit."
“I checked after I found it in the bag at the labs. Molly doesn’t know yet, I haven’t told her and she herself said they had just gotten the bag to examine yesterday. Molly, being as considerate as she is, told me I could check the bag first before anyone else does. I did and found this,” Sherlock mentioned to the bag. “And found out it was John’s hair.”
“Right, seeing that he likes games, he would do something like that… right?”
“What's going on?” Lestrade stopped Donovan from speed walking down the hallway, people pushing and shoving to get to their destination.
“Hmm, could be better. Too many people touching and showing emotions and sentiment for my liking.” Sherlock cocked his right eyebrow and sighed as Lestrade backed the car up and drove on the slick road.
Which of course, he was.
“Okay. Well, uh, Harriet-”
He did, just without his memories.
“No, what?”
Once Sherlock had, he and Mycroft had at it with an argument about John and his memory loss before it went to personal insults. Lestrade had to bud in before it had gotten physical.
“And you,” Lestrade pointed towards the man, “help her to make sure she doesn’t kill anyone while she’s at it. I’m going back to the station.”
That's it.
The table in front of him used to be a pale blinding white, but was soon replaced with brown, dried up blood. His head hung from his neck and his shoulders were tight and hunched. He no longer had shoes and his trousers and shirt was pure white, well used to be pure white, but now it stained with brown and dark red spots.
He looked John up and down with a raised eyebrow before looking at Lestrade, shaking his head to answer an unsaid question.
“What is it?”
She sighed and mumbled ‘boys’ before making her way back upstairs to where the sulking detective was. Mrs. Hudson went to stand in front of Sherlocks door with the package still in her hands.
“No-”
“No, I was just-” Lestrade stopped midsentence as he stopped at a red light.
"They erased me from his mind!"
He entered his office and closed the door to block out the noise just outside of it.  He sighed and made his way to his chair, sitting down in it with a grunt of anger.
If this story is boring or uninteresting, please tell me so I can spice things up. Until next time!
The phone call. God that bloody phone call. I haven't stopped thinking about it for awhile. Maybe I should've been quicker. I should've, then I wouldn't be here right now. He wouldn't be away from me.
“Oh, I know dear, but this can't go on any longer. Hopefully we can find John soon and get him back here, in his chair, where he belongs.” Mrs. Hudson sighed and smiled, leaning closer to Lestrade.
“No one Mrs. Hudson.”
“The blondes in the bag.”
“Yes, it is.”
The man was about as tall as Moriarty and John, blonde, blue eyes, black suite-
She smiled, still looking at her phone, and wiggled her fingers at them in a teasing kind of gesture that meant 'thanks for forgetting me but I'm still here'.
He should leave. Get John before something happens again.
We'd still be together.
“Hmm?”
“Watch your mouth-”
"Well," Lestrade wiped his face with his hand as he sighed. "You better figure something out because we'll need his authority in the government to gain access to who this woman is."
John raised his eyebrow.
Molly hummed and nodded.
“That's the bag he used to kidnap Johnny-boy.” Harriet whispered, her eyes never leaving the bag that once held her younger brother.
"JOHN!” Sherlock yelled with a raspy voice due to his dry throat from sucking in air, “JOHN!”
"And who exactly would be sad if I were to die?"
Sherlock sighed and put his leg back into the car and shut the door once all of him was in the vehicle. He looked down at his hands, which were situated in his lap, and thought. He thought of what he could be doing right about now. He thought about why he wasn't inside his flat by now. He thought about why there was a package in front of his flat's door.
“John? Oh, well, you see, when someone takes something that someone else loves very much, that person tends to come and claim it back. But you didn't do that, oh no, you weren't clear enough to observe it.”
"Who are you?"
The silence bore down on both men as they avoided eye contact and speaking. Sherlock looked around, trying to gather his mind back together before it goes savage again and causes him to do things he doesn’t want anyone to see. Lestrade on the other hand kept his face hidden as he mentally beat himself up for his stupidity. Really, this case would have been halfway over by now if they had found that sooner. Sherlock wouldn’t be here if they had found that earlier.
Some questions were about the background of some people whom he had no idea about and he'd call them ‘dim-witted simple minded cows’ and then left them to recognise what he had just said and called them.
“Okay?”
Donovan turned around and gestured to the main door that lead to the main hall. Lestrade frowned even more.
“It was just a beaker. I guess I got a little too excited and bumped into it.”
Molly frowned and turned it around before yelling Sherlock's name in a frantic hurry.
“Then?”
Sherlock Holmes didn't exist to John Watson anymore.
“I ate.” Sherlock immediately replied.
“Sherlock, dear,” Mrs. Hudson said in a soft voice. “Why don't you come and eat a little. You haven't eaten in days.”
“Harry!” She corrected.
Hopefully this story is interesting enough. If not, tell me and I'll try to spice things up a little. Thank you for reading this story, it really means a lot. I'll try to update regularly so you're not left on a cliffhanger. Until next time!
“John?”
“What?” Sherlock demanded and frowned, confused as the pictures and symbol flashed in his mind.
Lestrade wouldn't have been scared or gasped in fear of it was Sherlock's door, but it wasn't.
“RELATIONSHIP!? ARE YOU NUTS?!” Harry yelled and widened her eyes.
“Really? I thought you would.”
“Do you understand?” John asked, his eyes bearing down into Sherlocks.
“The blonde is in the bag.”
“Molly?! MOLLY?!”
“I don't understand.”
Seconds later Mycroft was on the other side of the hall, watching the still closed door with curious eyes. Mycrofts gaze went back and forth between Lestrade and the door due to the way that Lestrade was as white as a sheet and he was breathing harshly due to the scare.
Sherlock's eyes widened.
John frowned again.
Sherlock slammed a file down on the desk and crossed his arms; his posture pointed out that Sherlock was agitated and annoyed. Mycroft stares at the file, raised an eyebrow, and sat back into his chair as he raised his gaze to meet his younger brothers.
"JOHN!"
“Yes Sherlock?” He asked, raising his eyebrow but continuing to stare of into the distance, unblinking.
“He's gone again!?” Lestrade yelled through the phone in disbelief.
“Take me back to the station!”
Once they were at the door Sherlock moved in between Lestrade and Harriet, making him in the middle, Lestrade to his right, and Harry on his left. He took a deep breath before releasing it through his nose and knocked on the door. His mask slipped on along with Harriet's. She looked calm along with Sherlock, but Harry did one thing that John used to do when his masked slipped on; She fidgeted with her trousers.
The doorknob twist and slowly opened, creaking as it made its way out Into the hall to show what was hiding in it. Mycroft had made his move to tighten his grip on his umbrella, only to remember that he had foolishly left it out on top of the stairs, abandoned and slowly collecting dust. Lestrade leaned even lower and widened his hands to tackle the person behind the door if needed.
“Sorry for my friend, ma’am!” Lestrade yelled after her, “The elevator doesn't go all the way to the top floor for him!”
I'm so sorry for the delay of posting! I got caught up in a school workout program and family. But here's the next chapter. I'll try to update sooner for the next one.
“Why do you care?”
“That wasn't so bad, now was it?” Lestrade said as he placed the key in the ignition and started the car.
Mycroft sighed and leaned forward to get a full look at the insides of the file, which was filled with nothing but photos of a blonde woman. His eyes squint as he spread them out across his desks, Sherlock’s foot tapping impatiently.
“John, we had to make sure she was okay before this happened! She was drunk out of her mind when she came to meet you!” Lestrade defended, making Sherlock raise and eyebrow in slight amusement to the situation.
about Sherlock, only for it to be true both ways. Sherlock also had no idea about John nor his past. He obviously did know that John was an only child and had partners that were never brung up when the  family topic was about.
They bumped it down two days to let the cashier settle down and relax before they made their move and came in. Thankfully, two days was all he needed to calm down from paranoia and anxiety.
“I'm sorry Lestrade, I've been looking and searching, but that mark was all that there was.” Molly looked frightened and slightly sorrowful. She had been working day and night and had exhausted herself so much that she had fallen asleep at her lab table, where her head was inches away from a bowl with a brain in it; much to her dismay.
“He was looking around the store and slowly making his way back to the door before he opened it and ran. Now tell me, Lestrade, does that sound suspicious?” Sherlock whispered quickly as he leaned towards Lestrade.
Sherlock gave him a face that made him feel stupid and he really wanted to hit the detective for making him spit out his coffee all over him and ruin his fanciest clothes that he owned.
“What!?” John wailed as his eyebrows furrowed, “tell me what I don't understand!”
His body jerked, shocking Sherlock. What did that mean? Oh yeah, a silent sob. He's seen John do it before when he heard someone in his family had started doing drugs, but Sherlock himself had never experienced that.
(See the end of the chapter for
Freaking Lestrade.
“John?” Sherlock turned and stared at the door with wide eyes.
“Yes John?”
“Ow!” Lestrade exclaimed after Sherlock kicked his shin with his dress shoes. “Bloody Christ Sherlock…” He mumbled as he rubbed at his sore shin.
The two always had a row at each other about their heights. Sherlock would call John a 'Hobbit' and John would call sherlock a dragon, due to how tall and long he is.
She could hear him scavenging and riffling through the papers and drawers. She frowned as the prospect of them getting caught swam through her head. She then sighed and let her shoulders sag as she replayed Sherlock's question in her head. What made him so different? Well, there was the fact that he helped find people's murderers so no one else is hurt; that's a starter.
He had to tell Sherlock soon or else the tall Consulting Detective would come storming in and demanding why he hadn't been told as soon as their, as Sherlock called them, ‘stupid shrunken brains’ had found out.
God, he was pathetic.
“Maybe you should stop being such a dick.”
Lestrade grabbed the paper he had scribbled everything down on and handed it out in front of Sherlock. The paper was slightly shaking in the air from Lestrade's tired hand, but stayed in the air.
Who would hire such a guy?
“You have the right to remain silent until we find any evidence that you're innocent, but that's not likely to happen.” Lestrade narrowed his eyes at the cashier.
She had countless hours of day than night and the lack of sleep was getting to her more than she wanted it to.
"Sherlock, whatever you do, know I'm sorry and I tried to remember. You'll solve this case, I know you can.”
Lestrade made his way through the doors and entered the main hall. It was more like a mall, it was quite huge.
“MOVE PEOPLE MOVE!” Lestrade yelled. Lestrade went to his office and threw it in the trash can beside his desk. He looked around quickly as the tape caught fire and burned, melting inside of the trash can.
“The screen went blank and when it came back up he had a bag. A large black bag that had something heavy in it.” Sherlock explained and stared at Lestrade as his jaw dropped.
His sight had gotten blurry.
Great, another thing that John wanted to know about but wouldn't help him remember. Sherlock had no idea as to what he should do to help his fellow used-to-be friend. Mrs. Hudson had been very happy that Sherlock had began to come out of his shell, but somewhat sorrowful when he locked himself up in his room after the fight the two men had.
"We found a clue and we have a face." Sherlock said with a confused look at the Inspector. This caught Lestrade's attention because his eyes opened up quickly and his posture correct itself in mere seconds.
“I don't know, it sorta just… happened.”
“So shut up because unlike you, I haven't been on my arse the whole time, texting a stupid boyfriend! I'm TRYING to help people! And if you can't come in here and do the same, then LEAVE!” Lestrade glared down at her, his fists shaking in fury.
“Yes, an E-mail.”
"I knew you'd be smart." She laughed again before opening the photo.
“Why?”
“What is it?”
He hesitated before answering it with pure honesty.
"Confused, Lestrade! I'm confused!"
“SHERLOCK!”
“The blonde isn't in the bag.”
“Who are you?”
“Molly! Calm down! Breathe, for God's sake. What was that that just fell?” Lestrade asked Molly as she looked around the lab. She shrugged and looked back at the blonde woman.
"No, he's wrong. As you stated before, John's slimmer than that man and his height didn't fit John's descript-"
"MRS. HUDSON!" Sherlock yelled as he stopped stomping on his bed, his curls bouncing on top his head as the mattress made Sherlock bounce. His eyes widened and his pupils were blown wide.
“A joke from a friend.”
“Lestrade! There's a symbol on their collarbones! I swear! I just found it and-”
“You don't understand!” Sherlock turned to yell at John before ripping up the papers and throwing thumbtacks around the room, not caring if it meant that someone's foot would be impaled.
His phone rang and made him stop halfway from delivering another kick to the desk. He stared at the phone as it rang before collecting himself, clearing his throat, and answering it.
She had ran out of her house that she shared with Clara. Harry was sure she probably left the door open and the oven on, but there wasn't any news on a house catching fire, so she was okay with it.
Except for his caring heart.
Alone.
No ring on his fingers and a calm, almost peaceful, look on his face as he stared out at London.
“John?” Lestrade silently asked, earning two eyes locked on him and causing his to jump slightly. His eyes looked clouded and unrecognisable.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade whispered after frowning at both the woman and Sherlock. “There's nothing you could do about it now. She's gone Sherlock, but John's not. You can still save him if not his….” Lestrade stopped short and looked away from Sherlock in the early London air.
“How nice.”
Sherlock sneered. "Mycroft. Said there'd be something here worth my time." He looked over at Molly. "And worth looking for if we wanted to find John."
“Boring.”
Hell just broke loose today.
“No bloody way, Sherlock!” Lestrade yelled sarcastically.
“Yes,” Sherlock groggily answered, rubbing his eyes with his knuckles before glaring back at John once again, “and?”
“I didn’t John! I didn’t order for her to be released!” Lestrade yelled and flailed his arms in the air the emphasize his point, spilling coffee on the ground and down his own arm. It was now Lestrade’s turn to glare at John and John’s turn to not know what to say or do.
"Very.”
“What do you have?” John asked and raised an eyebrow in curiosity.
Oh he's done it now.
The three ran from the office and down the halls. Lestrade yelled at people to move as Donovan lead the way and Sherlock following silently. Donovan can to a stop in front of a door and Lestrade almost crashed into her. She opened the door and walked in, Lestrade and Sherlock following behind her.
“Yes, I know.” John said with a curt nod.
“No, you carry it.”
He replied in a quiet voice, quiet enough to the point where Molly almost hadn't heard him.
“TURNING AROUND NOW!”
“Oh God Sherlock,” Lestrade mumbled from behind his hands. “I’m so sorry.”
“You're rubbish.”
“”Don't play stupid with me you arse-”
“MRS. HUDSON! WHERE IS JOHN!?"
“I won’t.” She sighed and turned to the door and opened it, looking back at sherlock before she left. “I’m not the only one who’s busy.”
Bloody hell…… what does he say?
"Yes, I do."
Sherlock looked out the window as he usually had when he and John were in. The silence was normal too, but more colder as the figure to his right was missing. He inwardly sighed and self consciously, his hands turned to fist inside his black leather gloves.
The door opened to Mrs. Hudson, who waved her hand Infront of her face to blow off the dust that blew her direction. She coughed a fit before looking at Sherlock, raising her eyebrow she made a ‘hmf’ sound.
Thanks to the cashier, John had not only been taken but beat up in the process. Who would want to beat up John Watson? He saved so many people's lives that it's hard to imagine anyone hating or touching him in other ways than a pat on the back.
He blew a harsh breath through his nostrils before mumbling a 'fine'. He pushed the eject button on the DVD player and received the tape before putting it into its case, Lestrade and Sherlock's eyes glued onto him.
So was John.
Sherlock stared at the bag as if it had just insulted his family. His eyes were glaring holes into that bloody bag that held so many lies, and yet one truth. One truth that Sherlock hoped to have very soon so that way this case could finally be over.
“How- What- When- How?” Lestrade wailed and slumped back into his seat, his hands coming to cover up his face.
What was the case called anyways? He never thought about that. Usually it was John who named them.
Sherlock frowned and started to examine it, making and pointing out deductions in his head. Lestrade also frowned again and went to take the box out of Sherlock's lap to look inside to see if there was anything else left.
, and his
“Tedious.”
“John…”
all wrong. Missing. Gone.
Hopefully this story is interesting. If not, tell me and I'll try to spice things up a little.
“You don’t have the address!?” Sherlock yelled. He sighed as Lestrade shook his head sadly.
“Shut up.”
Great.
“JOHN!”
“Okay.” Lestrade sighed and closed his eyes, putting his hands up in surrender. Sherlock sat down next to him on the couch, staring at the blank screen to watch the truth that it was about to show.
“Where is he Mycroft? You have that look-”
That's not John. That never is John. That never
Lestrade groaned and ran his hand through his hair before down his face. His night hadn't been good either. He went home around eleven forty and only God knows why Mycroft Holmes was there. They chat about Sherlock and John and how they could solve the case. Mycroft had left when Lestrade had started to fall over from exhaustion. He woke up in his bed with a note by him.
“Not everything is Sherlock.”
“Why what?” John asked, his eyes bearing down onto Sherlock. His eyes were haunting and empty.
“That you're not alone-”
Oh brother.
“It's John's.” Sherlock added quickly after the red haired policeman finished talking. They all looked at Sherlock, Harry frowning as she wondered how he would know of such a thing.
Sherlock's smile and happiness had left in seconds.
In ten minutes Sherlock had found the files for the cashier in the manager's office, downloaded the footage into his phone, and was walking away and out of the store.
"Nothing….. that joke was just a knee slapper.”
John had black shoes when he left.
He found out that John had bought three cartons of milk, strawberry jelly, eggs, a loaf of bread, biscuits, some more tea, and a new razor with multiple razor blades.
She walked down into her room and left Sherlock and Lestrade to stare at where she had been.
Sherlock breathed in deeply and held it for a second before letting it out, his and Mycroft's eyes never breaking apart.
Like John would do when he saw his reflection again.
“Did you miss him?”
“Yes?”
Lestrade had sighed and tapped the stacked papers on the table to fall neatly and perfect. He put the papers on the table again before taking a look around his office and running a hand through his grey black hair. Today had been hell. So many families to argue to and so many inspectors to chase and shoo away along with reporters and Sherlock yelling and running around, mouthing off anyone who got in their way.
“Lestrade? It's Molly. Molly Hooper. I got new information on the corpses of the missing people that had been given back to us. I found something on their-” a crash rang from the other side of Lestrade's phone. Molly screamed as the sound stopped. It sounded like glass had broken. Lestrade froze and stared ahead of him in shock and worry.
Sherlock grabbed the paper and flipped it over to see the side where the writing was. He stared and memorised the address before looking back at Lestrade.
John's picture, him slightly smiling at the camera with a white background and the normal jacket he wore with a blue striped jumper, was on top of the whole pile. It had all his information on the paper. That one paper. His birthday and family members and address and sex and eye and hair colour. Of course, Sherlock already knew this information from the three years of not only  living with John as a flatmate, but as a ‘friend’. That word always made Sherlock feel uncomfortable but he was certain that John wouldn't let it go. John would always call him by the name of ‘friend’.
Sherlock walked into the shop that John had entered in but never came out of one month ago.
Did I mention I love Cliffhangers? Well I do...... I'M NOT SORRY!
Mycroft sighed louder this time and picked up the photo, eyeing the woman smirking in it.
The victims that were taken and put back in their places in their families usually had therapy or some sort of relievement. On one account, a man and two women killed themselves because of the memories. These people had been around twenty-five to thirty-four.
"IT'S GREG!"
He had
Why John?
He had Redbeard for years before he had died. Sherlock had been crushed by the death of his animal friend, but Sherlock lived to remember that dog.
“Why are you here?”
“No, no, no, no, no. It's right. I know it is, I mean, it has to be right. There's no other way it can't be right."
“You deserve to rot in Hell.” She spat angrily but calmly.
Lestrade only sighed again and took a sip of his coffee. “No, I wasn't exactly finished Sherlock.”
“I also found some marks on the floor. It was just polished but there were still marks. Shoe marks from where they skid.” Sherlock explained calmly as he pulled out the pictures of the floor with the shoe marks.
The cashier had been attacked before John. And John had gone up to save him. He didn't even know the man. Jeez, talk about a hero.
Lestrade jumped up from his seat as Sherlock glared daggers at him. "Well it wouldn't be such a bad idea considering what you've just told me about her! If she has a place in this case then he has a right now know so that way he can," Lestrade waved his hands around with a 'I don't care' face, "look her up or something!"
She banged the door open to her room and threw open the files on her desk. She looked at the pictures if the corpses that were paper clipped to the papers with the information about the person. The same symbol was on their collarbone too.
Some photos were of men and some other ladies with fancy dresses on, probably at a retirement party. Though, only one was of the blonde woman in the purple shirt and black diamonds. There was another one of a brunette man and his wife as they posed in front of a national park sign.
She grabbed the paper with both hands to unfold it before stopping. "But," John quirked his eyebrow wearily as his gaze snapped back up to hers. "You'll have to be cooperative and let me tell you the truth if you want to see who it is."
"Alright, I'll show you."
“I EARNED THE SCARS FROM FIGHTING BACK TO AVOID BEING CAPTURED!”
Once they were back at Baker Street, Lestrade pulled over and stopped the car, putting his hand on Sherlock's arm to prevent him from leaving the car. Sherlock looked at the DI’s hand before looking at Lestrade himself. He took his hand off of the door handle of the car and placed it on his lap as he continued to stare at Lestrade.
"Easy, easy. I'm not here to hurt you." She kept the smile on and reached out to brush her hands on his, which were handcuffed to the middle of the table.
What is that?
“I don't know them anymore!” Sherlock screamed and pushed past John, making him fall down again.
