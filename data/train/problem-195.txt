"You can't join us for breakfast, since Victim Five's family is there, but if you want something from the stash I can get it."
"Once you're out of hospital I can come see you at home. I want to meet your Rory." He smiled warmly at her.
"So it would be a surprise to you that Dr. Martin said she was worried about you?"  Sherlock shook his head at Harvey, apparently unable to speak, and Harvey went on.  "Do you think that you engaged in any unusual behavior when you talked to Dr. Martin?  Anything of concern at all?"
Once the judge was back in his seat and Mr. Ogbeide was in the witness stand again, Lou spoke.  "You never asked her what she meant by that?"
He walked back from the garden into the house. The hallway was plain and unadorned, with the exception of a doormat that said "Pilots: looking down on the world since 1903." There were a few hooks on the wall, and he hung up his coat on one of them. Once that was done, he stepped into the sitting room and took a look around. One big screen TV and DVD player, one sofa, one fireplace. The sofa was scuffed up, probably from the times the big man's children had come here. There were photos on the mantle above the fireplace, and as Sherlock stepped forward to look at them Douglas appeared in the room.
Phillip nodded.  “Yeah.  Like those things.  And She wanted me to do more and more before we got to cuddle.  I’d have to lick between Her legs a bunch of times, and not just once.  My jaw hurt from keeping it open so long.  She used to just ask me to put a finger there, or my penis, but She’d make me do more and more.  I had to use both hands, one to rub Her and the other one to stick my fingers in Her.  She liked me to put them in both spots.”
"Were you telling horrible lies?" John was surprised by the question; he hadn't even thought to ask something so basic.
"Do you think he might have influenced her to pick a particular person out?"  John could see Clark in the defense station make some sort of motion with his hands.
"When do you want to talk to Moira again?" He was looking directly at John. "Will it be at home or should I bring her here?"
"Because.  He said he didn't agree.  That I hadn't been telling horrible lies.  That it was all true."
"Both of them."  Sherlock turned to face the wall.  "Dr.  Arthur is the only one to name a specific person as a suspect, even though the girl didn't name one.  I am curious about what led him to do so."
"Can you point to them?"  Lou cast his eyes towards the crowd.  Unsurprisingly, Mr. Aherne pointed towards the dock where K sat.  Lou nodded, seemingly satisfied.  "How has your daughter been since this person was arrested?"
Although John knew it was important for them to talk, and to talk now, he was not sure where to begin.  He knew Sherlock told some things to Phillip before, but otherwise had not spoken about the bee incident (he still couldn’t call it anything more horrible in his head, even now) to anyone.  Finally he decided to start with a more neutral question.  "When K mentioned a friend of yours she had known, who was she talking about?"  John thought it was good he was sitting beside him and not in front of him; it seemed far less confrontational.
"It's an abuse investigation," John supplied.  "A serial sexual offender who hasn't been identified.  Two patients you examined in the A&E have been pinned down as possible victims, Sagnik Malakar and Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena.  Do you remember them?"  He pulled out a chair for Sherlock, but he didn't sit down and continued to rock on the balls of his feet.  Dr. Arthur looked disgusted.
As he headed upstairs to the place called Martin's room, Sherlock realized now he had severly underestimated how easy this was going to be.
Peter was sitting next to her, and he said: "Nothing this week.  It's been good, actually.  We're planning the trip.  She insists we have to go to Greece and to Switzerland."
“I don’t want to do anything you don’t want to do.  That you want to under the influence of substances,” John clarified.
"Speaking of women, as you all know my fiancé is going to testify against the woman who abused him in a week or two," Gloria said.
"Yes, I was.  But you were talking right outside my door."  That wasn't really much of a defense, but it was the truth.
"Nightmares are always easier when someone else is around.  In hospital, right after I was shot, they didn't seem so bad because I was never alone.  It was harder when I was back in London."  John had always been grateful that Sherlock didn't question him endlessly about his time in battle.  Before he'd left there'd always been people who wanted to hear gruesome medical stories, so he'd heard the questions before, but it didn't make it easier.  Strangely enough, Sherlock's silence on the subject made it easier to talk about it with him.
He swallowed.  “With most teenagers his age, I would give him a quick reminder of the importance of birth control methods.  However, with the fact his arm was broken I would wonder if the two events were related somehow.”
John could only nod in understanding.  "Look, though, about the two victims that aren't supposed to talk to each other.  Couldn't they meet with you two, or some third party to make sure they didn't talk about the trial?"
"I wouldn't be surprised.  If Edwin was still here I'd send him the clippings.  He'd want to know there was some justice in the world.  Oh, look at how I go on.  You're going to want to get there early, like the other days, right?"
As soon as Lou turned to the prosecution's table, Judge Foster banged his gavel and said, "The court will adjourn for one hour."  The crowd appeared to be in a special hurry to leave.  John scurried out with the rest of them.  After hearing all that, he needed fresh air (as fresh as any air in London could be).  Once he was actually out of the courthouse, he was seized by fatigue and spent the next hour sitting on the steps, trying to blank his mind.  He wasn't surprised when it didn't work.
"If he was intending to do that he did a remarkably bad job of it, since he said on the record he had no idea who might have taught her to say that.  He said her mother had a drug habit but wasn't seeing anyone."  In contrast to Dr. Arthur's outburst, Sherlock seemed calm and collected.
"Just my - first officer." This John Watson might be the modern type who wouldn't flinch at two men in a relationship, but Martin was not willing to take that chance.
"She let me sit on the table with the paper on it.  Then She sat down on it too and put me on Her lap."
"No one's here but me.  You're in your own bed.  You're safe.  Please wake up."  John wondered if putting a hand on his shoulder would make things better or worse.
I knew that the sooner the Yard found out about what Sherlock was doing, the better, so I made sure someone found out the same day. I chose Lestrade because sending anyone else seemed likely to end in a snipe-fest.
They sat there like that, John holding Sherlock, rocking him slightly, letting his tears wet John's jumper.  John murmured quiet declarations of affection until Sherlock's breathing eased out.  A few minutes later, John followed him into sleep.
"You're not going to.  It'll be easier to do it if you get some sleep, though."  John reached out his hand and was halfway to Sherlock's shoulder before he thought better and withdrew.
"And how long would a set of butterflies last in February in England, pray tell?" the woman said in a weary tone.  It clicked then in Sherlock's head they were mother and son.
"Well, I'd had football practice that day, and Sherlock waited for me, even though he didn't watch any of it.  I was hungry and I suggested we stop at the supermarket for something.  He agreed although I didn't think he wanted anything there; he never ate much.  We went inside, I got a juice and some crisps, and we were in the aisle with the sweets and just about to head to the registers when he just stopped in his tracks.  I was just about to ask him what was wrong when I heard a woman say 'Aren't you going to introduce me to your friend?'  I turned around and there was a small woman standing in front of Sherlock.  He looked afraid.  I'd never seen him look afraid before.  His eyes were just glazed over.  She asked him again 'Who is he?' and after a moment he said 'Victor' and she said 'And I've never met him?'  He didn't say anything then, and I was about to take his arm and lead him away, but she said 'I suppose this means that you're not going to visit me after school today,' caressed his shoulder and left on her own."
Well, he'd have to do it at some time.  "All right.  Just let me shut this down."  Martin shut down the laptop and followed John down the stairs.  He was almost afraid to step foot outside the flat - what if the sky was purple or giant lizards roamed the streets or any other thing that would make him focus on the fact he was in a strange place with no way to get back?  But there was nothing that struck him as being especially odd.  He hadn't spent a lot of time in London, unless you counted the airports, and so he had nothing to compare it with, but no obvious difference was somewhat reassuring.
"Phillip met Her at work, remember?  She has always used Her work to pick out Her choice of little ones.  Since She has money of her own, She can move any time She thinks that She may be close to detection.  The actual threat of detection is low of course, thanks to Her gender."  Sherlock sounded more like himself now, with the exception of a tremor in his voice every time he referred to K.  "But She is careful and moves periodically anyway."
I usually choose not to warn, but in this case I'm warning for disturbing content; unhealthy coping mechanisms, I suppose?
"Possibly.  Once again, we've requested the records from social services but they haven't come up yet.  She hasn't fostered in several years so the records aren't as easily accessed."  John could see Lestrade take a deep breath.  "I'm not exaggerating when I say that Dr. Martin appears to have planned for every contingency.  Even before seeing all this I suspected this K was clever and knew how to not get caught, but it still boggles the mind."  He shook his head.
"Someone who knew Sherlock when he was a teenager testified.  They hadn't spoken in years and their stories matched."
“When She came back to the room She said that She was really happy I’d been so good.  I asked Her if I was going to have to do that again.  You have no idea how much I didn’t want to.  But She asked me if I still wanted to be Her friend, and I said I did.  The kids at school all make fun of me, and without Her I wouldn’t have any friends.  She said then that She was just trying to make sure I got it all out so I wouldn’t hurt anyone.”  He slumped down in his chair.
"Do you find it amusing that a grown man is pleased with a gift like that?"  A typical Sherlock response.
No one spoke on the way back to the Yard.  Even when they had arrived, no one said anything. The building was cloaked in an eerie silence.  John wondered if the uneasy feeling was in contrast to hospitals, where there was never any silence and the lights were always on.
"Cerebral palsy.  I'm a spastic tri."  The words appeared familiar to him; Thomas was obviously very aware of his condition.
"Mr. Aherne, this is Dr. Watson. We know that the doctors and nurses that attempted to question your daughter yesterday were unsuccessful, and we happen to have both worked with Dr. Watson before. He's going to talk to her."
Mr. Aherne shook his head.  "They said it might jeopardize the investigation, and if she brought it up herself we could talk but otherwise not to press the issue."
"She's been on the streets since she was eleven."  Sherlock looked like he could say a lot more, but didn't.
"That was the right thing to do," Sherlock said reassuringly.  It seemed like he had cast off his earlier melancholy to deal with Phillip.
John woke up the next morning to find Sherlock gone.  Hamish was still on the bed, so he wasn't anywhere in the flat.  He hoped that he hadn't gone out in search of drugs.  While John knew he couldn't stop him from doing so, and knew from experience that trying to force an addict to change would backfire horribly, he also hoped that their conversation would have tempered the urge.  For the first time he wondered if it had in fact worked the opposite way, and Sherlock was trying to blot it out by getting high again.  The thought sat in his stomach so uncomfortably that he couldn't eat breakfast and remained as he headed out to the trial again.
"There's a lot of reasons.  The physical sensations are certainly part of it."  He paused to gather his thoughts.  "I would have to say that's a major part of it.  Not just orgasm, but the physical closeness, just touching someone skin to skin.  There's emotional closeness, too.  It's not always there, of course, but when it is it makes things feel better.  That's what makes it pleasurable for me, at least."
It had been four months since K had been first arrested.  Next week was the start of the trial.  John couldn't help but think of it in the same capital letters he used for Sherlock's Issues.  The Trial.  They were meeting with Lestrade so late that the sun was setting, and in the middle of summer to boot.  John welcomed the privacy the time gave them.  "I'm not going to testify, am I?" he asked.
"I went out for a walk.  Everything here was still so new and I wanted to see more of it.  My parents weren't sure it was a good idea but after a bit they let me go out."
In fact, it was three days later before they were able to talk again.  John had been busy at the clinic and Sherlock was taking an endless set of case notes on his laptop.  When Lestrade contacted them to say the foster children were willing to be interviewed the next day, there was still no conversation, but John knew the silence would be broken the next day.  Even then, the cab ride was silent.
"I'm not me," Martin quickly replied, and cursed himself internally for saying it. Just like him to put his foot in his mouth.
He and the other man, along with the small fluffy dog, went into the back garden. It had a small shed with straw coming out of it.  Standing at the entrance to the shed were two geese, who looked like sentinels.  “Romeo and Jomeo,” said the man when he noticed Sherlock looking at them.  “Skip bought them when Romeo ate his ring.  Then the man with the geese said they get lonely alone so he bought Jomeo too.”
"Do you think it was unusual that she wouldn't reveal the cause of her distress to you, especially since you seemed so aware of it?"  As she spoke she moved closer to the stand.
"No, but considering he claims to be Sherlock Holmes, we're probably not going to get much out of him."
Once he had finished his tea, John headed back upstairs.  He rang Sarah to say that he thought the trial would be wrapping up soon and he hoped to get some shifts again, and then spent a quiet evening by himself.  He texted Sherlock once to say that he hoped he would be back home soon, but predictably got no response.  He wondered if he should sleep in Sherlock's room in case he  came back, but instead he walked up the stairs and made himself fall asleep in his own bed.
"I'm fond of you as well," Sherlock added.  He turned to look Phillip in the eye.  "Listen, Phillip.  Go home.  Get yourself some sleep.  You can come back tomorrow and we can talk more if you would like."
He then noticed a picture on the computer desk. Two, actually, one on each side. The left picture showed all adults, but the right one had a child in it. He picked up the frame and examined it. The man who he was in the body of stood next to Douglas. Standing in front of Douglas was a teenager of about eighteen or nineteen, heavyset, who had dyed her originally brown hair with streaks of pink and green. In front of the other man was a child of about ten or eleven, skinny and dark-skinned, grinning for the camera. So these were the two daughters.
He came downstairs to see Mrs. Hudson in the kitchen.  "I wanted to see how you were doing but I felt better letting you sleep," she said.
John nodded in response.  Mrs. Hudson rarely called him by his first name, and the use of it combined with her well-spoken advice was a bit jarring.  He headed upstairs.  Sherlock was sitting on the sofa, a blanket draped over his shoulders.  His bee sat next to him.  All of the curtains were drawn and the room was dark.  Before saying anything, he walked over to the refrigerator and pulled out a can of Coke.  He noticed that there weren't any experiments in there and realized that Sherlock hadn't done a single experiment since this case had begun.  That was enough to make him stop for a minute to compose himself.  Only then did he reach into a cabinet, pull out a bottle of aspirin, and put two in his hand.  He carried the can and pills over to where Sherlock was sitting and set them down on the table in front of him.  "Take these with the Coke," he told him.  "It'll rehydrate you and the caffeine in it will make the aspirin work faster."
Only a few minutes after the defense came in, Lou and Susan walked in through the doors.  Unlike the defense, they didn't stop to talk to the media representatives that swarmed around them.  They simply waved them away and walked down to their section of the court.  The press took this as the cue to stop hovering around the doors and make their way to the press box.  In a few minutes the courtroom was full and quiet, everyone in it politely seated.  The jury then was lead in by an usher and seated.  Shortly after that an usher called, "Court rise!" and everyone got to their feet.  Judge Foster entered the room through a side door and seated himself at the bench.  He banged his gavel and the others in the courtroom sat down.  "The Crown Court is now in session.  Today's case is R vs. Martin."  He looked towards the prosecution.  "Is the prosecution ready to begin?"
"On the mouth.  Lips open, tongue out."  He said it in a monotone.  "Then She asked me about my brother."
"Come in. I've been baking all day for a birthday party this weekend. Birthday boy is allergic to peanuts and his parents wanted to make sure none were in the kitchen."
“If you’re going to be in a relationship with me you’ll want sex!  You enjoy it!  If I don’t give it to you you will leave!”
Victor folded his hands in front of him.  "I wouldn't go so far as to say that.  It took more time.  At first all we did was walk home from school together.  Then I started to sit with him at lunch.  When he seemed to be more comfortable in my presence, I invited him to my house after school."
"For a few minutes.  Then she put both of her hands on my thighs and spread them, hard.  It hurt when she did it.  Then she started touching just my groin until I got an erection.  I tried to say something, at least, but my words were all slurred."
"I just walked in there and when I heard Her voice I headed towards that exam room.  She had just seen a patient out and when She saw me She smiled.  She said it was a pleasant surprise to see me and She gave me a hug.  I liked that.  Then She said she had a little free time and would I want to come with Her, and I did.  I think we went to one of the empty rooms.  Once we were in there She sat down in a chair and told me I could sit in Her lap.  My mum never let me do that, so I did."  He paused and took a few deep breaths.  "At first She just was rubbing my back and I liked that.  After a minute or two She put Her hand down my trousers and inside my pants.  I didn't like that much.  It felt...strange."
John made tea.  He knew very well that tea wasn’t going to fix anything, but they both needed its comfort.  It also gave him time to collect himself. Just like Sherlock had known that venting his rage around Phillip would be a very bad idea, he knew that blowing up at K around Sherlock would be counterproductive.  So as he waited for the water to boil he took deliberate deep breaths and counted slowly to himself.  It worked, somewhat, and he brought the two cups of tea and a sugar bowl into the next room.  He put all of them down on the table in front of the couch.  "I know you like to add sugar yourself," he said as he sat down next to Sherlock and was rewarded with a small smile.  It vanished just as quickly as it was there, but it was enough.
"It's going to be a plea."  Sherlock sounded so unemotional he could have been talking about the weather.
"Well, right now I'm back at Bart's to collect some things Sarah saved for me, and if you can be there in an hour or so I suppose I can speak to the both of you."  The fact Dr. Arthur had addressed him by title but had referred to Sarah by her first name was not lost on him.  There could be several reasons for that, but John felt it was probably the old failsafe reason "he's a sexist git".  That would explain why Sarah apparently held him in such low regard.
"Just seen her?" Sherlock asked, the sound of his voice clearly indicating he thought it was more than that.
When he got in the door, Mrs. Hudson was standing there.  "Sherlock left around eleven.  He's not back yet."
Although he hadn't eaten any lunch, John didn't feel the slightest bit hungry when he walked back into the courtroom.  Jennifer was already seated in the witness box, her doll still tucked under one arm.  Even the buffalo averted their eyes from her as they came in.  Only when the prosecution and the defense were both seated did most of the crowd look at her again.
Arthur perked up at this. "If he sleeps on GERT-I can I do it too? We can have popcorn! I know where Karl hides it!"
"And because of that I don't think that there's anything you can do on your end here that would make you go back.  Sherlock was asleep too."
"What's gotten into you?" she asked him once they were sitting down. She pulled out a container of some kind of pasta and a banana and began to eat.
"I'll wait there then," Gloria said, and smiled in Graham's direction before vanishing down the hall.  Only then did the other three sit down, the two other men on each side of their brother and the woman to the left of all of them.
Susan came up to the stand and said "The prosecution calls Thomas Davidson."  Within a few seconds, everyone's eyes were on the boy led by the usher.  He attracted so much attention not for any case-related reasons, but because he was in a wheelchair.  He used his right arm to operate the controls, apparently at ease with the technology.  Before he had fully positioned himself, his legs spasmed.  He tapped each leg with his right hand and it appeared to stop. Cerebral palsy, then, John thought.  Probably triplegic.  He was the first victim testifying to wear a suit and tie.  It looked new; his parents must have wanted him to look good.  His curly hair was slicked down with some hair gel.
It was not the most awkward meal Sherlock Holmes had ever eaten, but it was surely in the top five.  He didn't feel like eating in the slightest, but the man across from him glared at him when he picked at it, so he forced himself to swallow it down.  He even gulped - something that he had mocked Mycroft for doing before and who would certainly mock him back if he ever found this out.
"Martin has vanished. The person currently in his body claims to be Sherlock Holmes." The large man sounded angry.
He should check his email; Phillip always emailed him over the weekend. Sherlock knew that he would write every day if he wanted to, but was too afraid of being seen as desperate for attention. Perhaps he was, but he'd had only one relationship remotely resembling a friendship, and even that had had strings attached.
He looked so enthused that Sherlock tempered his response a bit. "I don't wear a hat like that, and I've never owned a pipe."
Lestrade had been writing while this exchange took place, and as soon as Mr. Aherne fell silent he looked up again. "Let's get back on the subject. What did you do after that?"
The rest of the day was almost like those lazy Saturdays where they didn't have a case that had occasionally happened before this one.  John fiddled on his laptop, watched some bad telly with Sherlock occasionally making snide remarks, and made pasta with meat sauce that Sherlock ate about half a cup of.  They both went to bed early; John wanted to go to the support group again the next day, but he didn't mention that to Sherlock.
"It's a little early to ask if he's going to testify, isn't it?  We're still waiting on more charges," John broke in.  "There's not even a trial date."
That seemed to stymie Sherlock; he looked confused as he sat there and digested that information.  "I think I should bring this upstairs," he finally said.  He headed up the stairs, bee tucked under one arm.  Since he clearly needed time alone, John decided to give him some space.  He half expected to not see him for the rest of the day.  Almost every time he had an emotionally charged conversation with John recently he would flee once it was done.  John stretched out on the sofa intending to watch telly for a while but the whirlwind of the past few days caught up with him and he only watched it for a few minutes before drifting off to sleep.
Douglas looked at him in slowly dawning horror.  Sherlock could tell the horror was from using violence against someone who for all intents and purposes looked just like his partner.  He wasn't a violent man, (his punch would have been much more refined if he was) but Sherlock annoyed him and he acted so differently that for a moment he had forgotten about the body swap.  He slowly put his hands down at his sides, and took a few deep breaths.  "I think it is best if I retire for the evening.  You may sleep on the sofa here if you wish, or there is a guest bedroom on the first floor."
"She probably thought that she'd get away free until that man testified."  She looked directly at John for a second, and then promptly changed the subject.  They talked for a few more minutes before she headed back downstairs.
Clark obviously got the message and switched subjects.  "Are a great deal of your teenage patients sexually active?"
It was clear this had just occurred to Sherlock; he suddenly looked curious.  "True.  Just try the numbers, then."
"Yes,"  Mrs. Henderson said with a sigh.  "Mrs. Bena was not always fully there.  The supervisor wrote down that she'd fall asleep in the visits at times.  Mr. Ogbeide seemed more alert, and more concerned.  He'd ask about specifics with Jennifer, made sure I knew what foods she liked, what time she went to bed, how much light she needed on when she fell asleep.  He'd bring food from home, too, since the visits are usually for dinner or tea.  Homemade things they'd heat up.  Mrs. Bena brought burgers, fish and chips, takeaway type things.  He also rang the police several times.  He wanted to know about the investigation into Jennifer's abuse.  Of course Mrs. Bena got arrested a month later and that stopped those visits."
"Not really."  Since Phillip had kept his head lowered for so long, his hair once again hung in his eyes.  "She said that She'd try to help me with that, and She hoped She'd see me soon.  Then She took a tissue and wiped the ice cream off my face, and She left.  I went home then."
"If I tried to get more detail she'd either say she didn't know or didn't remember.  Obviously that wasn't true, but I never pressed her about it."
“In part.  K appears to choose victims that come from households where there is a distant or absent parent.  In Phillip’s case both of those factors are in play.  However, K has already made a mistake in that regard.”  Sherlock now sounded slightly smug, but that was better than flat.
"He loves his abuser very much," Sherlock stated, like it was self-evident. "The perpetrator is exploiting that, by reminding him he has no other friends and that the abuser is the only person who cares about him. That's not very far off the mark, as he's well aware his mother doesn't care about him and no one at school notices him. His arm was broken because he resisted the sexual contact for once. He's managed to convince himself that was something he did wrong and if he says anything he loses the abuser's friendship. Of course that last one isn't too off the mark."
"She probably touched my groin the most but she really did touch me all over."  Hesitation could be heard in his voice, but otherwise he sounded remarkably composed.
John stayed silent the whole way home, thinking about everything that the group had said. It had helped, even he had to admit that. It wasn't until he was actually walking up the steps that he wondered how Sherlock was doing now. He tried to tell himself that if anything horrible had happened he'd have heard about it by now, but the feeling didn't subside until he got through the door and found Sherlock asleep on the sofa, using Hamish for a pillow. For some reason that made him feel more calm than he had in days, and he went to prepare lunch thinking that he might be inching towards a solution.
“About that,” Lestrade said slowly.  He got up from where he was sitting and stood so he did not face Sherlock or John.  “The higher-ups have said that you can’t work on this case anymore.”  He looked briefly at both of them as if expecting some sort of explosion, but there was none.  Sherlock looked at him as if he’d started speaking a foreign language, but that was all.  “Not that you’ve been in any way subpar; without your help we’d have never cracked the case.  It’s just that if no one ever talked about all this without speaking to you there’d be a good chance her solicitors would use it against us, and no one wants to see this case go wrong.  Any other interviews are going to be done by different Yarders.  Normally we have a female officer interview children who have been abused, but in this case…”  He turned once again to face them.  “It’s the policy, you know.  It never occurred to me it would be a problem until now.”
This Molly had to be fairly unflappable (Martin supposed anyone who worked in a morgue had to be that way) because her only sign of shock was a hand to the chest.  "So there's someone named Martin in Sherlock's body?"
John glanced over at them once more when the cry of, "Court rise!" came.  They shook as they got to their feet.  He averted his eyes then and focused on the front of the court.  Susan came up to the front and said, "The prosecution calls Sagnik Malakar."  The usher came in, leading a teenage boy with thick black hair, glasses, and a determined look.  Unlike any of the victims who had testified before, he walked confidently and without hesitation.  When he sat down he looked Susan right in the eye.
Sherlock decided he did not like being looked down on. The body he was in now was about John's height, so he wasn't very short, but Douglas was at least an inch above six feet.
"No, I didn't.  Why would you think that?"  John couldn't figure out what the connection between the two was.
"Did he ever allude to what might be on it?"  Sherlock looked intently at her as he spoke.  He took the flash drive from her hand.
"His name was Victor Trevor.  He started at my secondary school when I was thirteen."  Sherlock turned his head to the side and looked like he had suddenly become very interested in a spot on the other arm of the couch.  "Everyone liked him.  He was good at academics and football, and he was friendly to everyone."
Even though John knew about Sherlock’s personal connection to the crime, he was still surprised by the undercurrent of rage in his voice as he said “Yes.  We’re going to find them and make them pay.”
While John expected all sorts of unusual tangents in conversations he had with Sherlock, this threw him for a loop.  “I would call social services, for one.  Even if his arm really was broken accidentally, someone clearly intended to harm him.”
“I’m going to show you some photographs.”  Lou produced a thick pile of them.  “Do you recognize where this was taken?”  He held one up so Phillip could see it.
Since Rory is in a family picture, Sherlock correctly guesses he is considered a part of the family, and is the easiest member to bring up to break the ice.
"Shower," he said to himself, to stop those thoughts from getting worse. Simply ignoring it never worked; it was either take a cold shower or... take care of it, which he couldn't make himself do without the barrier of cocaine.
"She walks our dog every day, and she sometimes goes to the little playground nearby. I know it's different in the city, but she's nine and she should have some freedom."
"Yes, but I didn't think he would give me a straight answer.  He'd told me his father was dead and his brother was at uni, but other than that he gave the impression that it was a closed subject.  I didn't want to press the issue, so that was that."
"I thought you said you weren't hungry?"  John stared at him from across the room once he looked up from the food.
"Thank you, Mr. Aherne. I'm sure we can come visit again once Moira's out of here. Hopefully this will all be helpful." John shook his hand before he settled back into the same chair he sat in before, picking up the book he had been reading before.
John was decidedly glad when he left for the clinic Monday morning. When he woke up and came downstairs he found that Sherlock had left his room, but was sitting sideways in a chair again, Lestrade's file in his lap. He didn't respond to John's tentative, "Morning," and seemed not to notice that he was there. It was a relief to leave and descend into the hustle and bustle of the city, and even more of a relief when he arrived at work and was greeted with a few welcome remarks of, "Hello," or "Good morning". Even though his patients that morning had a tedious repetition of symptoms (London appeared to be in the midst of a flu epidemic) it was still enough to distract his mind.
Susan nodded.  "The jury will see him as he is now, and wonder what was going on that he didn't fight back.  And he also has to testify about what the defendant made him do to other children.  That won't be easy."
"You said before that you told your children that they won't get in trouble if they don't lie to you.  Does that mean you don't discipline them?"  She made it sound like he let his children run amok.
John silently finished his and left without a word.  He slipped into the courtroom like he usually did and sat down waiting for the trial to begin.  As others filed in he noticed that several of the regular buffalo weren't there.  Apparently what had been said already had been too much for them.  He half-expected them to come in late, but when the courtroom was fully packed and the usher called the familiar "Court rise!" they had not arrived.
"It got taken away," he tersely replied. John wanted to ask why, but he knew better than to try, and merely stared out the window. Rain was spitting down from the sky, casting a dull sheen on the ground. The sound was the perfect dismal soundtrack for the two people who were in the same space, and yet both alone.
"It wasn't your responsibility to protect him from whoever was abusing him. Even if you did figure out who it was, I doubt that any charges would have gone through if Sherlock just denied everything," John said, in an attempt to reassure him.
Sherlock, for his part, had turned to stare at him.  John could see him out of the corner of his eye, looking just as stunned as he must have when he'd realized who K was.  "John?" he said after about a minute, sounding as bewildered as he looked.
"He'd never see a therapist, though.  He - he can't really talk about it even to me, and I'm his only friend."  As he said this he hoped Ella didn't follow his life too closely now, or she'd know who he was talking about.  "He's told me little bits but not really anything of substance."
"No. In the book there are ways you can go from one universe to another. They're made when molecules go two different ways. They've all got their own patterns, like colors. Someone or something decided to put us both elsewhere. In the book they never swap bodies with anyone else though." Why did every explanation he tried to give make him sound stupider? Douglas would never have that problem.
"I'm not sure, but it's not Martin. I asked him some aviation questions and he couldn't answer any of them. He didn't even seem to mind that he didn't know." Well, of course Sherlock didn't mind. He'd never read those sorts of things.
"I don't have the slightest clue," Sherlock said, hoping the man would finally get the point.  He looked at Sherlock for a few moments and turned to leave.
Harvey went to the front shortly after and said, "The defense will now cross-examine Phillip Rodgers."  Phillip was escorted again to the witness stand.  He looked worse than he had on Friday; he was so pale he resembled a ghost.  John could relate to how he felt.
"Can we go down to the gift shop again Dad?" Dierdre asked, tossing her red ponytail behind her back.
"You weren't at home when it happened, then. You said something about Germany?" John reached for a pencil and paper from a nearby table.
"It was a while, but she was African, I think.  She had dark skin and dark hair in braids."  From Sherlock's brief glance towards John he knew that Sherlock was aware that could have been a description of Jennifer Ogbeide-Bena.  "She was really little, though.  Not even old enough for infants school yet.  Someone that little should be safe."
Once he seemed sure that the whole family had left, Sherlock spoke again, still sounding neutral.  "That is why She's fostered so many twins, then.  The incest taboo is something those children are no doubt aware of.  While it would easily be possible to get any set of siblings to do so under the threat they will be separated if they do not, since they are aware that after coming into care their siblings are all the family they have left, twins and other multiple birth children are even more vulnerable because of their tendency to a closer relationship than ordinary siblings and even stronger desire to not be separated from others.  That close relationship is also what prevents them from speaking about what has occurred.  If both are unaware the other is also following a script and both truly believe they have forced their sibling into sexual activity, they fear being arrested for such as well as losing that sibling's love.  Finally the incest taboo is even stronger amongst them, and is the most effective deterrent against speaking She has."  His neutral look faded into a questioning one.  “I could have given them my number.  It would be easier for when I speak with them again.”
It finally dawned on John that Sherlock was so overwhelmed by the trial that he couldn't even make the simplest decisions.  "You don't have to eat anything."
“Alla.  She got it from someone who got it from someone else, and that might not have been the individual who wanted us to have it.”
He didn't feel as anxious as he had before, and he wondered if that was because he didn't know any of the people testifying that day.  Oh, he'd met Mr. Ogbeide before, but he didn't really know him or Jennifer the same way he'd gotten to know Phillip and Moira.  In a way, it was a relief; he didn't have the same sort of heart-wrenching feelings their testimony had invoked.  On the other hand, John had no idea what would come out in court that day.  He thought to himself that that made him one of the buffalo, and had to suppress the laughing fit that came up.
Dr. Arthur rose out of his chair, not quite at eye level to Sherlock.  "He presumably wished to blame it on the mother's boyfriend or someone who was important to her," he snapped.
He ran a hand through his daughter’s hair.  “I know you must have been.  I wish I had known something sooner.  But that monster K is never going to touch you again.  I promise.”  Mr. Aherne looked at the two men and in apparent response to the doubt that must have shown on both of their faces, added:  “I’ll sleep in this room with a knife in my hands.  I’ll bring Moira’s bed in my room.  I’ll move all of us to a hotel.  I’m not letting my daughter get hurt again.  This stops now.”  He practically spat out the words in his fury.
"He was.  Probably still is.  But until he met Sherlock that was his only friend.  If your mother ignores you and the kids at school all tease you you'll be attached to that one person who gives you a party and wants to hear you tell about your day.  That's worth all the rotten bits."
As he was leaving he came across Mrs. Hudson.  "If he comes back, or rings you, ring me.  I'll have my mobile with me."  John hadn't brought it to the trial before, but now it seemed the only thing that could ease his worry.
“For Snoopadoop?  I don’t think we need to do anything now.  See where that old climbing frame is?  We can see if she’ll jump over the little bars.”  He stopped.  “Wait, I should get her treats!  I hope Douglas has watermelon, that’s her favorite!”  He dashed back into the house, leaving Sherlock alone with the dog.
Mrs. Henderson thought for a moment before speaking.  "Well, I wasn't present at most of them.  I just dropped her off at the center and picked her up an hour later.  But I did usually talk to her parents before or after the visit."
"You are in your room, you are safe, and she is not with you."  Maybe he'd come out of it quickly.  He had last time.
"I will ring you again once I have testified," Sherlock told Phillip.  "Stay well."  Phillip smiled at him and he and his father exited the flat, together once again.
"Jail," Mrs. Bena said flatly.  A few people in the crowd murmured, but there wasn't a lot of shock over it.
Moira shook her head. "No. He likes balls and rope toys but doesn't chew on my stuffed toys. They're all on the other side of the bed anyway." She paused. "Do you have a dog?"
The cab ride back to Baker Street had to be one of the most uncomfortable John had ever experienced.  Sherlock might as well have been a mannequin with a head that moved.  Even when they reached the safety of home, he merely sat down on the sofa and stared.  He wasn’t sulking, he wasn’t lost in thought, he was just blank.  This unnerved John so much that he retreated to his room, not wanting to do anything about it other than hope it would go away.  Before the case it wasn’t something he would have ever done, but this had sapped so much of his energy.  A thought occurred to him: if this case drained him so much, how must Sherlock feel?  He banished it quickly as it came.
As soon as Harvey asked that, Sherlock visibly snapped back into detective mode.  "All he had were some vague claims that I had said something unflattering about a neighbor.  There were no witnesses, no confirmed statements, and the alleged victim hadn't said anything.  You cannot prosecute someone for what is essentially a rumor."  Obviously he had distanced himself as "the victim," but if it helped him get through the trial John wasn't going to argue with it.  It was at least good to see him act more confident.
Before I came up with anything but the title, I decided the abuser was going to be a woman. Just a lone woman, abusing children because she was sexually attracted to them, no one else forcing her. It almost never happens in these kinds of stories. To the Sherlock fandom's credit, they've actually dealt with it a few times, so points to that. I also decided that Sherlock would have been abused by a woman as well, and he'd be the only one to not assume the serial child abuser was male. Until the big reveal in chapter seventeen, I kept going back to re-read sections to make sure Sherlock was the only one who never referred to the abuser by gendered pronouns (not counting the children). Even some of the commentators would refer to K as "him," which I expected people would do.
"May I have a word with Mr. Clark?" Harvey said.  Clark reluctantly shuffled over to the defense table.  The two seemed to argue, including furious hand gestures, for several minutes.  Once that was done, Clark went back to the stand and said "No further questions," in a dull tone.
"Who was that?  The prosecution?" Sherlock asked.  That one question made John realize that his suffering had to be especially terrible if he wasn't able to figure out John wouldn't be asking a prosecutor if they were attending the trial.
"Yes."  He moved his gaze from his lap to his feet.  "We did not see each other again."  After a few minutes of silence John was ready to ask another question, but before he could do so Sherlock spoke.  "She was right, you know."
"It is a case," Lestrade told him, and when John looked at him with surprise he added: "Not one we're involving Sherlock in, at least not yet. Sensitive subject matter."
Lou's office was several miles away, so John took a cab there. It was on the ground floor, though, and once he got inside it only took a minute to find it. The door leading to his room was wide open, and John could see Lou on the inside gesturing for him to come in. He was currently on the phone, but waved his hand at the chairs that faced his desk. John sat down in one and realized he now faced a large wall covered in photographs. The first one that caught his eye was of the Aherne family. It looked like a formal picture, since everyone in it was dressed up. Mr. Aherne sat next to a small woman with long black hair - Nora Aherne, it had to be. Their youngest child Dierdre sat in her lap, and Kieran and Moira framed each of them. The picture next to that was of Phillip Rodgers and his father. It must have been taken recently, since Phillip had only recently gone to live with his father. He wore a school uniform and looked nervous. One of his hands rested almost unconsciously on his father's arm. Next to that photo was of a boy in a wheelchair holding an infant and smiling - Thomas Davidson. His mother must have given birth. Below that row there was a picture of the Spencer family, complete with Gloria and Angus. Christine looked polished, like Graham and Martin now did, but from the looks of it Dominic was still on the streets. Next to that was a picture of Jennifer Ogibede-Bena and her father on the beach somewhere. The last picture showed two teenagers of African descent, a boy and girl, with their arms around each other. John knew they'd been in foster care with K, but couldn't remember their names. The final row had one passport-style picture of a man with red hair and Asian features, one of a blond girl and a ginger boy mutually scowling for the camera, and what looked like a celebration with Sagnik Malakar's whole family.
It wasn't until John was in a cab on his way back home that it occurred to him Sherlock might have fled again.  Considering how unwilling to talk about K he always was, and how he'd do anything to avoid it, it seemed very possible.  Fortunately, when he opened the door of their flat, Sherlock was stretched out on the sofa, still in his pajamas and dressing gown.  "The prosecution's going to be here about noon tomorrow," John said with a sigh of relief.
"What's the problem?" he asked as he stepped forward to meet them. If it didn't involve a case he couldn't imagine why they would be consulting him.
The one thing I have the most trouble with in writing is, weirdly enough, naming characters. I once came up with a background for a character that was longer than the entire story he was in, and I still couldn't think of a name for him. If I'm not inspired, I'll use an initial or symbol for the character until I come up with a suitable one. Obviously this couldn't be done in this story, so when I tried to think of an easy way to get names, a thought occured to me. The story's named after a book about missing people, right? So why not name the original characters, or at least the victims, after missing children in the UK and Ireland? I did, and it worked very well in the end. Some of the victims are very similiar looking to the child they're named for, and some are not. Whenever we meet a new character, I'll list and link to the inspirations for their name/appearance.
The airline Arthur mentions that used to sell seats in the bathroom is real: in the Seventies the Russian airline Aeroflot did just that.
"The school is really big.  And the flat didn't have a garden.  The school was so big that I got lost."  She shifted her gaze from Lou to the ground.  "I was too scared to talk to the other kids, most of the time.  They didn't seem to notice me."
When he woke up, Sherlock was sitting in one of the chairs, violin in his lap.  "I thought that you wouldn't be able to adjust to the sound," he said by manner of explanation as John looked him in the eye.
He really didn't know what to do about that when Sherlock wasn't there - it didn't happen very often - so he just nodded, said "I'll be back," and shut the door. He took two steps away before a kid appeared from a nearby alley.
"We'll be all right," said the boy.  He gestured to her with his hand and said some Russian word.  She headed off the steps and they walked off together.
"I told him to get some sleep and if he couldn't fall asleep on his own I'd give him some sedative.  He had a rough time. K said he -" John managed to cut himself off before he revealed too much.
"Six usually, not counting me." She gestured for him to follow her and they both headed into the building. "We're near the top." She pressed the button for the lift. It arrived in almost no time at all and they got in. Gloria pushed the button for the ninth floor and they ascended silently. Once the door opened again, she walked out and headed across the hall to a frosted glass door with Mitchell Dodson Ph.D, BASW written on it. Gloria opened the door. She led John into the waiting room. A short, balding, blond man stood there. John assumed he was a group member.
John Watson was very used to seeing Lestrade and Donovan on a regular basis, but he didn't expect both of them to stride into St. Bart's without either Sherlock racing ahead or trailing behind them or that look on both of their faces that indicated they had to drag him out of work for some case. Donovan gestured to him to come forward, and when he raised an eyebrow she shook her head. "No, this isn't about the Freak this time. It's a bit different."
"All right, and I know you said you have no living family, but is there anyone else you know that might be capable of something like this? Anyone in the area that seems too fond of children? Some man who's always around but doesn't appear to be doing anything? Strange behavior from a father or a relative of one of Moira's friends?" Lestrade hadn't broken his gaze on Mr. Aherne since he had begun the tale of the trip to A&E.
“She said I got to be too much for Her sometimes.  I kind of did.  Because after we did those things She’d let me sit in Her lap and cuddle.  And I really did like that.  I’d do anything so we could.  I’d have gone there every day if I got that.  She even let me spend the night there sometimes.  My mum liked that too.  I think she liked it when I was out of the house.”  Someone in the courtroom gave an audible sob.  “But She said She couldn’t do that much and I’d just have to come there sometimes.  She said She’d bring other people there.”
"Yeah.  It always hurts and feels icky but this time it hurt more.  When She got ready to leave I saw blood on Her finger.  I just wanted to get home so I didn't say anything.  After I got home I looked again and there was still blood. I took off the underpants I was wearing and stuffed them in the hamper.  I told me dad that I wasn't hungry for supper and just stayed in my room.  I checked again before I fell asleep and there was only a little blood so I thought it was okay.  Then me dad woke me up and you know what happens after that."
Lou paused to answer his mobile.  "Hello?  Good, I'll tell them that."  He put the mobile away.  "I think that you three should go," he said.  "Susan's on her way."
He suddenly understood a bit more of what Mycroft was getting at.  “To see if they had large expenses they couldn’t account for?  Or large influxes of money?”
"If you still wish to be at the trial early today, you should leave soon."  Sherlock began typing furiously again.
I'm sorry for being so late in posting this. I have five writing projects I'm working on now, so updates might be a little slow.
"You will live in the guest room until this is sorted out. Luckily Emily will not be visiting for another month. Don't go in her room at all."
She nodded.  "They're in my flat on the second floor.  I'll go and get them for you."  After a few minutes she returned with a manila folder in her hands.  "This is everything; the checks but also anything else I noticed about my little mystery tenant.  As I said before, I'm not sure it's all on the up and up but the rent was paid every month and the checks never bounce so it's not like I can ring up Scotland Yard and tell them that my tenant only pays me with starter checks."
Mr. Ogbeide swallowed visibly, and looked away from the both of them.  “That's – well, I'm not even sure where to begin.  It wasn't just one thing, you know.  It was a series of things.  In hindsight it all fits together but I wasn't able to make the connections at the time.”
When John woke up he looked at his clock and was surprised to find it was almost noon.  The trial must have taken more of a toll on him then he thought.  He checked his mobile to see if Sherlock had texted him.  While he hadn't, there was a message from Lou.  He sounded very happy as he said "Watch the news this evening for our statement.  I am very pleased."
He decided that it was best to simply ignore that remark. "I do care about how you feel, no matter why you feel it."
"No.  But She said if I didn't She'd call the Yard on me.  Tell them I'd been doing things with Her too."  He turned to look at Sherlock again, and tears were in his eyes.  "There was one time where She had this really little girl with her and I was supposed to..." He seemed to check whether both of them knew what he meant, and when Sherlock nodded in understanding, he went on.  "She - the little girl - was crying the whole time.  After it was done I ran to the bathroom and threw up.  I wanted to find something to take so I could die but all there was was soap and shampoo."
He was about to stop his train of thought again, when it occurred to him John wasn't at home. Nothing to stop him from going in now. He shut his eyes.
It dawned on John what he meant. "That I love you? Yes. Both romantically and as a friend," he added, to prevent what he was sure was the next question. "That's the reason I hate to see you like this. You shouldn't have to get high to drive her out of your brain when it's me. And I'd like to try to help you with that. That's why I want to go to this group." Not wanting to push the issue further, John changed the subject. "How long have you been using again?"
"Not a problem," Lou replied.  "I wish I'd done more with Victim One's testimony.  If I'd realized Victim Four was going to mention that nursery rhyme I'd have brought that up."
“This is Gloria Yellowfox.”  Immediately John remembered the woman who had come in with the Spencer family.  “I know this is forward, but since the trial’s going on…”
"As far as I can tell."  She sounded more confident now, like the businesslike examination had calmed her.  She walked over to a cupboard and pulled out a syringe and a blood vial.  "I'll assume you're no worse of a stick than Sherlock is."  She rolled up one of his sleeves and tapped his arm before wiping it with a piece of cotton wool.
"Do you have any idea why his mother's so dead against you seeing him, especially because she let you see him at first?"
"I think we should go to your room to talk anyway. It would be quieter in there.  Also, Lestrade wants to talk to your father and he'd prefer to do so in private," Sherlock told her.  John knew perfectly well that the reason was that Mr. Aherne might react badly to the photographs, but he also knew that wasn't something Moira needed to hear.
At this point Sherlock didn't feel the need to spend more time alone in that room, so he headed downstairs.  He poked around the living room for about fifteen minutes before there was a knock on the door.  He heard the man come down the stairs, and looked over at him.  He was already dressed for work and had a bag in one hand.
"I've never smoked."  Sherlock's tone made it very clear that he wasn't going to discuss it further.  Fortunately, Mr. Aherne just half-nodded in his direction and continued to lead them into the kitchen.  He motioned for Lestrade to sit down at the kitchen table.  When he had done so, Mr. Aherne sat in the chair next to him.  Sherlock had already went into the living room, and John followed him.
John sat there until the others were gone, including the prosecution, and then slipped out the door himself.  As soon as he got into the hall, he saw Jennifer and her father walking down towards the exit.  Jennifer was chattering to him about the hotel they were staying in and about how much of the city they could see from the windows.  It was a strangely uplifting sight.  K had apparently not squeezed all the joy out of her as with some of the others.
"He's actually the child who started our investigation. His name is Phillip Rodgers and he's thirteen years old. Lives with his mother, who works all the time and doesn't appear too involved in his life. Father is out of the picture, whether he's dead or just left isn't known." Lestrade sipped at his tea. "This is very good, John, you have an eye for the nice tea brands. Anyway, he was brought into the clinic here with a broken arm and a black eye. He said he'd been in a fight, but was very reluctant to say anything more. He claimed he'd been wrestling with a friend and his arm got twisted then. There was a spiral fracture on the arm, but it looked a lot more serious than something you'd usually see in playful wrestling. The doctor who saw him – incidentally, that was your friend Sarah, John – was sure there was more to it and did a complete physical examination. There was bruising on the inner thighs, and she was quick enough to realize it was the sort of bruising you'd see in forced sex. He didn't admit to any sexual contact, however. She was smart about it though, and got to talking to him, just asking ordinary questions. When he was off guard enough, she asked if the person who'd broken his arm had hurt anyone else, and he said that he was one of a hundred here."
Sherlock didn’t seem daunted by this.  He started to examine the tape itself again.  “Alwion is what Ptolemy called the British Isles.”
John was late from getting back from his group. He always returned home promptly; therefore Sherlock knew something had come up that couldn't be helped. The clinic directed all emergency patients to A&E, so it couldn't be that. Normally he would have spent time ruling out anything else, but he was too tired to do that. John clearly liked going to the group and looked forward to the meetings. At first Sherlock had assumed John would invite him to it, or even worse, make him come, but that hadn't happened. If it had he would -
"No, the fiancé of Graham Spencer.  His brothers are attending tomorrow and she asked if I'd sit with them until it was over."
"Everyone tells me to pay more attention.  But it's just too much sometimes."  Phillip's voice was heavy with despair.
Donovan put a hand on his shoulder. "The sooner we find out the name of the person who hurt your daughter, the sooner this will be over. I know I explained to you that whoever this man is he's been targeting children in that area for a long time. We just realized that the victims were connected, and if all this goes well your daughter will be the last one."
“They got bribed first?”  Mycroft merely shook his head, and it took John another minute to realize what he meant.  “They knew her already.  They were both…” He couldn’t make himself say “pedophiles.”
"No. He just ran out of the house, threw up, and headed home. It eats at him still that he didn't do anything."
Monday and Tuesday went by both slowly and quickly.  On the plus side, Sherlock didn't even attempt to leave the flat.  He didn't do much of anything else, but he made no effort to try to escape.  Instead he spent hours on the sofa, or in his chair, or even in his bed, staring off into space.  He ate nothing and only drank a few sips of tea or coffee.  He didn't even try to turn the television on.  But he did appear to fall asleep at night.  He only spoke once on Monday, to inform John that Mr. Rodgers had been successful in court that day and Phillip would be going home with him.  For most of Tuesday he didn't say anything at all.
"I assumed it wasn't going to rain." He hung up his jacket and went into the kitchen to see what he could make for dinner.
"They were both university professors at the same school.  My father was a specialist in ancient history and my mother taught physics."
Only a few minutes after Dr. Dodson came in, Mari walked through the door. A heavyset woman with bright red hair, she had attended the group the second longest. "Peter!" she said as she searched for a chair. "How was Europe?"
There was no doubt in John's mind that he meant what he was saying. "No. I'm not. If you don't want to see a therapist it'd be stupid to force you to. I am going to a group though."
"Not off the job, but we chatted from time to time.  I wouldn't call us more than casual acquaintances."
The woman sitting on the sofa was small and petite, her hair a light blond color that made her seem younger.  One of her hands was closed over something.  She was short, barely five feet tall, but looked determined.
Mr. Rodgers stepped into the flat.  John noticed he was holding a stuffed frog.  Phillip turned to look at him, but there was no look of recollection.  He didn't seem to notice the resemblance, either.  "Who are you?" he asked.
"Can you state your name for the record?" Susan asked first.  It wasn't something she'd done before in the case, and John figured she asked it so Sherlock could compose himself.
"Is there anything else you want to know?" Lestrade asked, obviously eager to take hold of the conversation again.  Moira shook her head.  "Then I'd like to talk to your father for a bit.  You three can wait outside in the hall."
"He said anyone doing that had to have a lot of money.  They wouldn't be happy if Jennifer was in care.  Someone with all that money could make my life very unpleasant."  Privately John doubted K would care if one of her victims wound up in care; she seemed to have a never-ending supply.  If an older victim who was more able to say what had happened, she might put in an additional threat, like with Moira, but Jennifer wasn't one of those.
"No, She left because of what Mummy had told Her.  Victor had spoken to Mummy before that."  In stark contrast to his brother, Sherlock sounded flat and emotionless.  "You know as well as I do that Craig was gay.  He only married Her so he could get his inheritance.  He told me that She said She wasn't interested in dating anyone anyway, so they might as well be together."
"I'll take some, thanks."  He had a feeling this was going to be a day where he'd need the caffeine from two coffees.  With a final nod, he walked into the courtroom, sat down, and ate the doughnut and sipped at the coffee.  The buffalo came in as usual, followed by the press.  He eventually fell into enough of a lull that the cry of "Court rise!" startled him.
"What did I say before about not assuming?" Sherlock lightly responded. "On the contrary, it was a very helpful conversation."
John never thought he’d find himself agreeing to go to a support group, but Gloria was right: this was hard.  “I’d like to see what it’s like,” he told her.
The detail about Austria and the leg calipers were only added so Phillip could mention the fact the boy had asked him to his house. While he hadn't written it, it was still clear he wanted to see if Sherlock thought it was a good idea for him to go. He'd have to write back to assure him it was a good idea. He'd only mentioned the other boy in passing before, thinking that at any point this Justin would tire of his company. Now it was clear he would not.
“And you think that program is on the flash drive.”  John couldn’t help but smile from the rush of the case.
"Some clothes and my art supplies."  He picked the bag up and opened it.  A bin liner stuck out of the open space.  Phillip reached in and grabbed a few things.  "Here are my colored pencils and my watercolors.  I want pastels but I've never been able to get them."
"You seem concerned about who spends time with your children, but you've testified you let your nine year old daughter walk a dog by herself."
“But how did she even know who they were?”  The only way John could think of it happening was if she had paid off the prosecution or judge, and it didn’t seem like any of them would have been bribable.
"Do the Yarders have any leads?" He moved away from the collection of cow parts and stood behind John's chair.
"Yes, but you very obviously do not." John couldn't tell if it was a good sign or not that Sherlock was avoiding the implications their relationship was now a romantic one.
"You might testify before then."  John assumed the other victims would testify for a shorter period of time, because Phillip and Sherlock were the only ones with years of abuse to describe.
The meeting wasn't due to start for another fifteen minutes, but since he had nothing else to do, he went upstairs.  John thought he'd be the first one in the office, but once he opened the door he saw Eli parked in a chair.
This was enough to spur Lestrade into action, and he pulled a sheaf of papers out from a drawer.  "Here is what was taken at the hospital.  As I said, there were translation issues, so I'm not sure how much is reliable." He handed them over to Sherlock and John.
"She asked if she was going to spend time with Her after, and She said that once I left they could."
Mr. Aherne's eyes widened, and he clearly could tell where this was going.  "Of course.  I think it'd be impossible to have not when you've got three children, correct?"
"Sherlock," said Mycroft.  He was sitting on the sofa, calm and collected.  "You've rebuffed my previous attempts at communication, so I've had no choice but to appear in person."
"Mummy would leave me there with Her."  The capital letter was back, John noted.  He wasn't particularly surprised by it, either.
Martin finally forced himself to open his eyes. "I rang my boss. The number didn't exist. I rang her home and the person there didn't know who she was. I tried to look up the number in the directory and they said there's no such listing."
Phillip looked like he was trying to come up with a response that wasn't the obvious, "She's lying."  After several seconds of silence he said: "I told you what happened."
"Nothing.  I liked talking to Her so I didn't want to say anything even though it felt weird.  After a little bit of that I told Her I needed to go home.  Then She said that She didn't even know my name."  As soon as she said that, she looked down, like she was being scolded.  Brownie migrated from under one arm to clutched protectively to her chest.
Without thinking much about it, he shut down the laptop and drifted back towards his room. He flopped down on the bed. He stared at the ceiling and wondered if Victor Trevor had tried to message him again.
“All night long?  Really?”  John wondered for a minute if his mother would have noticed him using the phone all night long, and then reminded himself most children his age had their own mobiles.
"The Ahernes should be here soon, and we can't talk to a witness with anyone else here.  Even Lestrade is leaving in a minute, once we go over some details," Lou added.
If he hadn't taken the drugs, he would have made the connection sooner. James Warren, victim twelve at the trial. Since Alla Pinyakova had been victim eleven they must have met then. Not wanting to go into all this, he just nodded.
"The girl was so reluctant to talk about who had hurt her 'down there' that it made me suspicious.  The father would be the person who she would most want to protect."
"Now that you mention it, she's following me around the house a lot the last few months. She's asking me to read her something before bed, too. Since she hadn't made friends I thought she was just lonely." Mr. Aherne looked slightly puzzled, like he hadn't thought about this before.
After the meal, he got up from the table and realized that he had nowhere to go.  He could go sit in the room set aside for the man whose body he was currently occupying, of course, but that was all about planes and a computer he had no interest in using.  Outside?  Nothing of interest there.  This Fitton was clearly not in the same class as London, or even Yorkshire, for that matter.  Even the garden wasn't safe.  He didn't think the other man had been kidding about the geese.
"I want to go to bed."  John didn't register what Sherlock had said for a second, since it wasn't a response to his comment.  He had to pay attention when his head emerged from the ball he had made of himself.  At first John wondered if this was an escape tactic, as Sherlock usually went for so long without sleeping and he'd slept for so many hours yesterday, but when he saw the dark circles under his eyes John figured he was telling the truth.
"Wait up for the rest of us," Mr. Aherne called to her.  The remaining three members of the family came to stand next to her.  "Good to see you," Mr. Aherne said to John.
“Yes!”  Sherlock held up the item in his hand. It was an old-fashioned tape recorder.  Not the digital kind, but the one that used magnetic tapes.  He pressed the play button and a tinny recording started.  At first it was just static, but a few seconds later music began.  It wasn’t the sort of music that a station would play, but a music box.  The strange sound went on for a few minutes.  Sherlock only spoke to say “
"I thought about that little girl and I realized I didn't know if she was still getting hurt.  So I looked in her handbag and there was no ID but there was a receipt from a store in there.  I wrote down the address and then once She left me back at home I went right over to your place."  He turned so he was once again looking Sherlock directly in the eye.  "I figured that even if I got arrested I'd know that other girl was safe."
The defense solicitors didn't seem to have noticed the exchange.  They first watched as K settled herself in the dock and then made their way down to the defense box.  The woman, Rochelle Harvey, seemed to be in charge; she talked to the man while he nodded.  She looked taller than John by a few inches and wore wire-framed glasses.  Even though she had to at least be in her fifties, her hair was still platinum blond and thick in a way that indicated she wasn't dyeing it.  Marvin Clark also wore glasses and had dark hair creeping towards baldness.
"Not quite yet," Graham said.  He took a seat.  "Is Gloria allowed to be in here?  If not, is there a place she can wait with Angus?"  John assumed Angus was the infant in her arms.  He was almond-colored like his mother, but had faint wisps of blond hair on his head.
The look on his face went from suspicion to worry.  "What was the first navigational aid to be installed on most airplanes?"
"Just be dressed nicely for the trial, all three of you.  Your other daughter - will you be bringing her?" Lestrade asked.
"I did.  However he doesn't have as strong a connection to you as Moira.  I think he would only be reassured if I were there."  Sherlock looked briefly away from the screen.  "Your comment yesterday about Phillip's mother was very helpful."
“Well.  This is Graham’s idea, really, but I know how hard it can be living with someone who’s trying to process all of this.  There’s a group I go to, for those close to survivors.  It meets on Sunday afternoons.  I don’t know if it would be something you’re interested in.”
"From what little we know, she came to the UK as a refugee of some kind.  No other family.  Taken into care and bounced around a lot, so we're not sure when she was in K's care."
Sherlock stared at the mug of coffee like it was an alien invader.  After a minute he sat up, took the mug, and took a small sip.  John had apparently added enough sugar, since he took another sip after that one.  "When are the Spencers going to testify?" he asked after a few moments of silence.
Any idea that this was going to be a normal day at work, or at least as normal as one of John's days ever got, was shattered when Sarah approached him before he even took his jacket off.  She looked stunned, the sort of look you saw when some patient came in with a rare and quickly fatal disease.  "That Yarder, Lestrade, he was here just before you got in," she informed him.  "He was..." Whatever she was about to say bothered her so much she went silent.
"Wonderful to hear.  That sort of cat is called a polydactyl, which means 'extra toes.'  Two eyes of a different color are called heterochromia iridium." Sherlock said, smiling.
"Have you lived in the UK for most of your life?"  Lou was clearly letting Victor just chat for a bit, most likely to impress upon the jury what an upstanding citizen he was.  John looked at the buffalo and most of them were smiling; Victor passed their tests.
He sighed. "Thank you anyway for trying, Dr. Watson. I'll go in to see her now; it's almost supper and I want us to eat together." Mr. Aherne stepped into the room, the other two children following him, and the Yarders headed for the exit.
again and again.  Of course he wasn't that fortunate; the cab driver went on and on about the trial until they got to his destination.  He had several ideas about why K was being falsely accused, amongst them the former foster children wanting to sue and at least two of the fathers having really committed the crime. As John got out, he shoved some pounds at him, pointedly leaving no tip.
"He's prepared for almost anything," John said with a faint sense of horror.  If K was really so careful it was going to be hard to catch him.
"You're going to make me see someone, aren't you?" The terror in Sherlock's voice made him start to shake. "Because I won't. I'll run away, I'll live on the street, I'll stay away forever."
"I can most certainly do that. I am going to do that. My only question is whether you will be coming with me or not." Determination mixed with the fury, this time.
"Sexual abuse."  Only as he said it did he realize he'd never uttered the words in connection with Sherlock before.  Even now their power seemed overwhelming.  They echoed in the air without the ease of euphemism.
"I got thirsty and I went into a shop to get a drink.  When I got to the register I realized I didn't have enough for it.  I was going to put it back, but then a woman said, 'That's all right, I'll pay for his too,' and gave the man the extra money."
John heard several people get up and leave.  If he hadn't been so determined to sit through the whole trial, he'd have done so himself.  Something about the childish rhyme attached to sexual activity seemed an especially perverse act.
"Not the same thing at all.  In that case I had no evidence there was a crime in the first place.  In the previous one there were reported statements from the victim to another person.  While you can't prosecute anyone on that, the involvement of the third party would add credibility to the claim of a crime."
"I think he understood that I'd had sex with someone, and they'd taken me to their flat.  I told him the car was blue and the flat was clean since that was all I remembered then."  He paused.  "I told him where my parents were and then they came and picked me up.  We went home and I got to my room and slept for the rest of the day."
The interview room was small and windowless. It had a small table, four chairs, and a tape recorder. Mr. Aherne settled into one of the chairs. He looked uneasy. Lestrade sat down opposite him and gestured for John to sit next to him. "If you want us to stop the tape at any point, just tell us," Lestrade said in a soothing manner.
Sherlock made a sound of dismissal.  "Of course.  Now that K is jailed and Moira knows she is truly safe, she's far more willing to discuss what was going on between the two of them."
A thousand responses stuck in John's throat, among them, "That you were hurt so badly," "That you're in so much pain," "That you were so desperate for love," and "Because I care about you."  He finally said: "Drink your tea."
Christine looked briefly at each of her brothers before speaking.  "You know, our dad loved us, even if he could be a right tosser when he was drunk.  When Mum died he just went off the bend.  Didn't never hit us before then.  And we were just normal kids, really, but he wanted to follow her to the grave.  I talked back a lot and in our last row he slapped my face and I fell.  It wasn't much really but when one of the workers came to our house and saw what a mess it was she took us all into care."  She spoke with the raspy tone of the heavy cigarette smoker.  "Went to this house full of other kids.  First they said they'd split us up, no one'd take all four at once.  Then they said they found a place for all of us.  When we got there I thought we did pretty good.  Big house, lots of stuff to do, big garden.   And when we met Her She seemed nice enough."  John wondered to himself if there was anyone K had victimized that didn't speak of her with capital letters.  "Right off She said we could call Her Mum.  I still missed my real Mum a lot and I jumped right on that."
John hadn't expected their conversation to take this direction.  "Yes," he finally said.  It was hard to ignore the stories in the papers and on the news.  Sherlock would leave the room when the television started on them and flipped past the articles, but John still took them in.
"No.  He figured out that she was afraid of retaliation from her abuser and let her tell him what happened without saying anything about the person."
"Well, Dominic and Martin are both going to the trial tomorrow.  They want to support the others, but they also both think hearing the actual testimony would be too much for them.  I was hoping you could sit with them in the main hallway until Graham and Christine finish.  Martin will have Angus with him, but he shouldn't need help with him at all.  Is that something you can do?"
John decided that he'd come downstairs again after twenty minutes or so; plenty of time for both Phillip and Sherlock to talk and still be there when Mr. Rodgers arrived.  So he sat upstairs and waited.  Once the time had passed, he went downstairs again.  Phillip and Sherlock were still on the sofa, but Phillip had moved closer to Sherlock, almost leaning on him.  His eyes were red.   "You can stay down here now," he said when he saw John.
"His name was on some of the reports.  He also put in a statement that he thought the father of one of the victims was the culprit."  John felt that was a safe statement to make.
The scene was abruptly broken by Lestrade poking his head into the room.  "Are you finished in there?  I've finished going through the file with Mr. Aherne."  At that point he noticed the stuffed bee and his eyebrows drew together.  "What is that?" he said, confused.
"Yes."  John saw him glance to where his family had been seated before continuing.  "Two sisters and a brother."
"Phillip is quite a boy, you know.  He reminds me so much of you.  So sad because his father is gone and his mummy doesn't love him.  No brother, though.  Or bee."  While the woman still looked like she had before, John felt a terrible sense of unease.  She no longer looked warm or anything like a person you would trust.  Even her smile suddenly seemed sinister.  "But of course at least I love him.  Just like you."
"I presume the previous landlord approved it.  All the flats got some a few years back, according to his notes. Whoever was in there must have asked for something in particular."
Gloria followed Dr. Dodson into the next room, where six other people sat in a circle of ten chairs. "Gloria's brought a new person today," Dr. Dodson said as he sat down in a chair off to the side of the circle.
In a few minutes both of them were standing in front of what seemed to be a perfectly ordinary building.  John couldn't see anything that made it somehow stand out from the ones around it, but he did notice that in the visible ground floor flat all the windows were covered by curtains.  Sherlock headed towards the front step without saying anything, and tilted his head so he could better examine one of the windows.
When he walked into the familiar office, he saw it was unchanged from before.  That strangely comforted him; it was nice to see that some things didn't change.  "Dr. Watson?" his former therapist said as she came into the room.  "What brings you here?"  They walked into the other room, Ella giving him a look that clearly said:
"If K's Kelly Gene Martin, then yes, she's here.  I've made some more calls and Mr. Aherne and Moira will be coming down to the Yard tomorrow for a line-up.  The Rodgers boy will also have to pick her out.  Without an ID all we've got is the fraud charges.  If this is the right person, then we're going to search the house and the flat you and Sherlock found, amongst other things."  Even he sounded surprised, even though he had worked with law enforcement for so long and had clearly seen many horrible crimes.  It was quickly becoming more and more accurate that, as Sherlock said, "people always assume."
"He'll wind up like me."  From the way he spoke it was clear Sherlock didn't consider that a compliment.
Before John could say anything, Rodney spoke up. "And I'm sure he loves that other person. He has to; otherwise he can't rationalize any pain he was caused."
Lestrade looked at him.  "If I had known..."  He trailed off and looked away again.  The discomfort in the room was so apparent that John hoped Sherlock's conversation with Phillip would be over soon.
"No.  But he saw me with the insect book She had given me and he asked me who I'd gotten it from."  With every word of testimony Sherlock seemed to speak more in the voice of a frightened child.
Sherlock said nothing in response, and simply curled up again, face to sofa, Hamish in his arms. He didn't say a word as John made himself eat breakfast and watched crap telly until it was time for him to leave.
"How many relationships have you been in?"  Sherlock was clearly trying to use the detached way of questioning that he used on cases, but there was a clear note of emotion.
"You've got it from all angles, don't you?" Tammy commented. "I can't imagine dealing with two people going through this. As it is we're in separate bedrooms."
"Doesn't he go home with you?" The man they called Herc didn't seem to fully understand the situation.
"Do you recall what you were doing that day?"  Even Susan appeared to be more relaxed than on previous days.
"Sometimes.  But I've never asked them to leave the room unless the child requests it.  Usually I explain what I'm doing and why.  It also helps if the parent is allowed to look away."  She looked right back at Clark, making it very clear she wasn't going to be intimidated by him.
Clark reluctantly went up to the stand.  John looked at his watch and realized there was very little time left for today.  Clark had probably hoped that he wouldn't have to cross-examine Mrs. Murray until tomorrow.  "Hello," he said flatly.
The other man looked at him with a look that was both perplexed and long-suffering. "What?" he said.
This is the first chapter that I had to be careful of pronouns. Since the victim is going to be talking about the perpetrator directly, I re-read everything twice so I could make sure I always used something gender-neutral. For those wondering, K's real name - Kelly Martin - was picked because I wanted a gender neutral first name; not just something that was able to be used as a gender-neutral name, like Kimberly or Ashley, but that is still used more or less equally for all genders. "Martin" is just a common last name that isn't Smith or Jones. Her middle name "Gene" is a bit misleading since that spelling is usually used for men, but I happen to know a real female Gene who runs into this all the time. Since that ties into one of the story's central themes, I decided it fit. And I'm not sure calling her K all the time is the best thing in this meta, but like John I couldn't make myself think of her as anything else.
"No.  She still hadn't said anything and I thought that if she didn't want to talk about it that much I wasn't going to bring it up."
"Was this the same person who broke your arm?" There was another long period of silence. "Should I take that as a yes?"
"Just so you know, if you wake up feeling that angry again you can tell me about it.  I don't mind being woken up and it seems like a better thing to do than shoot the wall or tear your bedsheets to shreds."  John tried to keep his voice light, so the suggestion could be seen as a joke no matter how serious it was.
Martin's stomach turned to ice. "I can't remember it off the top of my head. Fitton Airfield? 42 Adams Lane? Airport FTN?"
"What's going on?" Sherlock turned at the sound of the voice. The other man from before now stood in the doorway.
When they finally did get out the door, John's attempts at small talk were met with a distant stare, and as a result the cab ride felt even longer than the one he had taken yesterday. Once they were at the hospital proper, Sherlock strode through the doors, past the admissions desk, and towards the lift, as if he were so important that no one would even think to question what he was doing. Of course, the lift was delayed for no reason anyone could see, and John (who knew better than to try any small talk this time) let his eyes wander down the hall and towards a suture room with an open door, where a woman with dark hair was saying irritably, "Look, it didn't hurt, so I didn't realize it was that bad, okay?" as a gash in her arm was stitched up. He never saw who she was talking to, as the lift finally came and they ascended to the correct floor.
"At the time there was no conviction and no one had any idea how long she'd be in there.  Once that all happened she was being transitioned back to her father's care."
"Only when I've counted them out, you know that. I always bake more than people ask for, so there should be plenty left." He smiled as he led them into the adjacent kitchen. Racks of cooling biscuits littered the counter and a large stand mixer was running at full power.
, John thought to himself. "All right. I will come with you and usher you out if you cross that line." Which would probably be after about five seconds.
Without a look backward she opened the closet door and pulled out a box slightly larger than a pillow.  She placed the box on the bed next to Sherlock.  "When I picked K out of the lineup, me dad took us for ice creams and there was a store nearby and he let us go inside.  I found this there and told me dad we had to get you it.  I'd saved up a lot of pocket money and I used that and me dad helped.  He didn't know if it was a good idea but I told him why I wanted to get it and he said that was okay." The words rushed out one after another.  Sherlock still hadn't touched the box, so she added, "Go on, open it."
“Obviously.  But if we don’t know what it means that’s useless.”  He couldn’t make heads or tails of it himself.  Was Jan a name or a location?  Or was it a reference to Jain, since there was already an Indian connection?  Even Sherlock wasn’t likely to know that.
If Sarah was annoyed at not being given all the details, she didn't show it. "It's not very busy, so I can let him go for the rest of today. I hope you can get to the bottom of whatever this is." She ducked out of the room and the Yarders and John left the clinic and headed up to the wards above.
“Remember how spooked Ms. Morstan’s father was after interacting with whatever this group is.  Anyone trying to put a light on them wouldn’t want to be known.”
The easiest way I could figure out to get Sherlock aware of the case was by John being aware of an abuse victim in the hospital. I invented several other details that never made it into the story, such as how the girl refused to say anything at all to the various social workers, police, and trained interviewers, so they go to a doctor the Yard is familiar with as a last-ditch thing. Obviously not standard protocol, but everything else I thought of was even less plausible.
"No, none," Mr. Aherne replied.  He sounded remarkably calm considering Sherlock had warned him about where this type of question would lead.
"Can you get me a stethoscope?"  From the look on her face it wasn't clear if she really needed one or just wanted a moment to process all this.  John headed out of the room and she looked awkwardly at Martin before saying: "So, um, is this your first time in a morgue?"
"I know that his brother came home and raised hell, but since Sherlock's mother didn't know who I was she never mentioned me and I suppose he never asked that woman.  Sherlock was sent off to a boarding school within the week.  His mother died a few months later, and right after that I read in the local paper that Dr. Martin had married someone in town and they'd moved to London.  I wondered which school Sherlock had been sent to, but after his mother died I never saw his brother again and I hadn't thought to ask him before."
"Did she keep her hands on your belly the whole time?"  Lou didn't seem bothered by the recitation at all, but he had obviously heard it before.
"Okay. And you won't tell K – " The first letter apparently slipped out, but the rest of the name was cut off. She took a deep, panicked breath. John wondered whether "K" was the beginning of a first name or a last name.
“Are you finished?” Sherlock asked him.  He sounded like he’d been made to sit through a particularly dull lecture rather than being taken off the case.  Lestrade nodded, unable to speak.  “We should be going, then.”  Sherlock directed John out the door, not saying anything, not exploding with anger, not seeming to react at all.
"Let's go," he said to John, ignoring Donovan.  Without waiting to see if John was following, he strode down the hall.  John hurried to follow him.
"It was all normal until She touched me through my pants.  I told Her to stop, and She took her hand away said She was just trying to examine me, and I said: 'No you weren't,' and then She laughed and touched me again.  Then She said that She was going to see all the others for medicals next week, and maybe Darren or Shane or Josie might like it more.  I told Her not to hurt them and She asked me if I'd do what she said, and I said yes.  Then She let me put my clothes back on and we went back out to the waiting room.  She told Mum and Dad that She didn't like the way my legs looked and it might be a good idea for Her to look at them every week, just to be safe.  Mum said if it was going to be after school and She said yes, and I could just come in with the others next week.  Before I'd thought maybe She wasn't going to be seeing them at all, but then I knew She was telling the truth."
"No, because there's hardly anything in the flat and both of us need to eat something."  Sherlock scowled at him, and John added "Coffee and tea do not count as meals.  There's no milk left anyway."  He oddly felt better after seeing Sherlock's look of distaste; it was at least a normal way for him to act.
It took forty-five minutes for them to be seated, order, eat, pay the bill, and head back to the hospital, and that was enough for them. When Lestrade knocked on the door of the room, Mr. Aherne was no longer reading the book and his children were all sitting on the bed, watching some cartoon. "Mr. Aherne, can I have a word with you outside?" Lestrade asked him. "We'll just be outside the door, so your children should be all right."
"Did she explain why she was doing that?" Lou had lost his earlier uneasy look and seemed more matter-of-fact.
A vague memory of hearing about Dr. Martin from Sarah a few weeks ago came back to him.  She had complained about Dr. Arthur but had said that Dr. Martin had been nice.  Whether it was because he had forgotten or that he'd chose not to make the connection, he hadn't thought about that.  "Why was Lestrade here?" he made himself ask.
“But we all thought that,” Dominic said quietly.  “She told each one of us that we had to do it and when we talked it was when we realized it was because of Her and not because we were so bad.  It would have been bad with Christine, but when it’s one of the brothers that looks like you and acts like you it’s so much worse.”
"Yes, but you can finish your sandwich before we go get her," Lou said before biting into his own with the power of long-delayed hunger.
John looked at his watch and realized it was far past the time he usually ate supper.  "I should make something to eat."
"People want... company," Phillip muttered.  "It's not like I don't know that there are lots of people like Her."
When the cab finally stopped in front of Baker Street, he got out and was striding towards the door when he realized that Sherlock was just standing there on the curb, a blank expression on his face.  "Sherlock?" John said gently as he came to stand in front of him.  "Are you all right?"  It sounded stupid even in his head, but he couldn't say nothing.
After a few paragraphs, Sherlock had to stop.  It might have been a hundred years ago, and a lot of the circumstances were different, but this was still
"Somewhat."  Mr. Ogbeide looked away for a second, then fixed his eyes on Lou.  "A few weeks later..." He proceeded to tell the story he'd told Sherlock and John about the encounter with the dealer.  A few people in the audience gasped, but John couldn't hear anyone crying or getting up to leave.  It was almost understandable, since five days into the trial there had been a lot of disturbing testimony.
I have read a lot of books about medicine, and most doctors will freely admit that child abuse is something that they never get used to. John is reasonably quite haunted by this.
He picked up his computer from the floor, booted it up, and once it was started inserted the flash drive.  Nothing happened, so he went to the drive directory and entered the sequence.  Once again, nothing happened.  Not even an error message.  "I got nothing."
A few minutes later he heard the man say "No, Carolyn, he is not coming to work with me."  Pause.  "I don't want to leave him alone here."  A longer pause.  "That is possibly the worst idea you have ever come up with."  After almost a minute of silence, he spoke again.  "If you must.  But I am warning you if he does anything to upset him I really will make him live in the shed with the geese."
"That means you were a teenage male," John replied.  He hoped Sherlock would laugh, or even unfold himself, or something that indicated what he was saying was getting through.  "She's still the adult, though."
"Do they even know it exists?  From the way they stopped going after her father, I'd guess they didn't think he had anything of note."
There was another pause.  John didn't think that K would have to be that strong to do all that, as Phillip was slight.  Even so the casual cruelty of it made him shudder.  Phillip, once again, broke the silence.  "My arm hurt so I didn't want to move.  At first She just rubbed me but after a bit, when She got that to work She grabbed my thighs and spread them apart, really hard. 'You really think you can get away with that?' She said.  'You think you're special, can do all that before you get what you want?  You're just one of a hundred and I could replace you at any time!'  After that She just stayed on top of me until She was done.  That was when She told me to go to Bart's.  I asked Her what I should tell them and She said to say I'd been wrestling with a friend.  Then I said something really stupid."
She shook her head.  "No.  She asked me if me dad had hurt me and I said he didn't.  Then she said that no one should touch me there but a doctor.  I got real scared then because K said that too and said that was why it was okay, because She was a doctor."  John had gotten used to the capital letters in She at this point, but it still unnerved him to hear it.  "So I didn't say anything and just held Brownie until she left.  Me dad came up for a bit and asked me if I wanted anything because he had to go home so everyone else could rest.  I told him to get a book.  I had to take a pill that tasted like clay the nurse brought me and then I fell asleep.  When I woke up it was really early and the sun had just come up."  Moira brought the bear closer to her chest.  "A few minutes later someone knocked on the door and then K came into the room."  The memory clearly disturbed her; she visibly shuddered.
"Just so you know, none of the other Yarders know I'm here or that you are helping. I intend to keep it that way; although you were much better talking to the girl yesterday than anyone would believe I think the others still need to be eased into the idea." Lestrade put the file down on the table and sat down in a nearby chair. This was enough to break Sherlock out of his stupor; he got out of the chair in an awkward twist and headed to the table. He didn't sit down, but he did pick up a few pages from the file and began to examine them.
"Okay.  I'll ask you again.  Did anything happen between the two of you before she came in through the window?" Lou said for a second time.
"No," he said quickly before disconnecting. Out of the corner of his eye he could see John moving around in the kitchen. "Is there a computer I can use?" he asked, hoping that John wouldn't ask too many questions.
"Threats are force.  It's not holding a gun to your head, but it's force."  Sherlock echoed John's words of the day before.  "What was She doing then?"
"I wasn't planning on it." Sherlock took a good look at the man again. Mid-fifties, divorced three times, two children from different marriages. Currently in a serious relationship with... Oh, why hadn't he seen it before? He was in a relationship with whoever was typically in this body. That was why he was so sharp with Sherlock - he hates having to look at a lover and somehow see a stranger. And he fears that the situation might be permanent. Sherlock didn't see any reason to think that - if they'd been able to swap in the first place, they'd be able to switch back some way. If it wasn't anything they'd done and was rather on some third party, that would complicate things, but it would all be sorted out somehow.
"You're not the only one to make that mistake.  Everyone at the Yard seemed about to fall over in surprise when they found out our suspect wasn't a man."  John looked away, biting back his "Everyone but Sherlock" response because it wasn't his place to tell Sarah about something like that.
Sherlock looked over at him, then back to the television.  John took that as a sign that he didn't want to talk about it and decided it might be best to leave him alone that evening.  He sat down in his chair with his supper, ate it, and then read a novel he had started a few days ago.  When he finished it was nearly eleven and Sherlock was still staring at the television screen.  "Are you coming to bed?" John asked, hoping this wouldn't be one of those evenings where he paced all night long.
"Thirteen, I think."  Mari looked like she'd had a sudden revelation.  "That must be why he's so caught up about it."
"Just that you shouldn't wait up for him."  She patted John on the shoulder.  "You're not the only one who worries about him, you know."
Sarah paused to consider the question.  "At first he didn't say anything.  That was when I looked over the intake form more closely and he'd written 'broken arm - fight' on it.  So then I asked him who he'd been fighting with.  He didn't say anything then either, but after a few seconds he said it had been a friend."
Mrs. Hudson was at the base of the stairs.  "I've seen everything in the papers and on the news," she told him.  "If even half of what they're saying is true that woman shouldn't get out of prison alive.  Especially that poor little girl from yesterday.  They didn't show her on the telly, of course, it was just a reporter reading from the trial transcript, but the things she went through..." She shook her head as she trailed off.
"Yes.  I play for an orchestra.  The oboe and the bassoon."  Mr. Rodgers looked down at the toy in his son's arms.  "You loved to come to work with me and on Sunday I would take you backstage."
"She told me that the woman - Jennifer called her the 'doctor lady' had taken her from her mother's flat and they'd spent time together.  I asked her what they did and she didn't say anything for a bit.  Then she explained that the woman had brought her to the 'fucking room' and they'd done all sorts of things.  I just kept listening and I decided that as soon as she went to sleep I would call the Yard."
A sudden cry jolted him out of the recollection. He opened his eyes and John was in front of him. He didn't look angry, which surprised Sherlock most of all.
Sherlock heard the woman gasp. "He did what?" She spoke again after a few seconds (the man must have just nodded): "So where is Martin now?"
John had heard people talk before about silence falling over a room, but until that point he'd never actually seen it happen.  As soon as Sherlock apparently realized what he had said, he took two steps back, his eyes widening as he did so.  He was probably attempting to flee somewhere, but as he turned for the stairs he tripped on the lowest step and fell like a bundle of sticks.  Instead of getting up, he curled into a remarkably compact ball.  For a minute John stood there in stunned silence.  Whatever else he said, Sherlock valued his company and liked having him around.  And despite any sort of bravado he might put on, he was clearly frightened of K.  It wasn't a barb designed to keep John away, either.  Sherlock's response to hearing himself say it was not a calculated one.  Then he remembered Molly saying a long time ago Sherlock seemed to want something he couldn't have, and the gears clicked.  He crouched down next to Sherlock.  John knew better than to touch him, and he couldn't catch his eye when he was curled up like that, so he threw caution to the wind and just said it.  "You loved her.  And you didn't love anyone else after that.  Until you met me.  And you love me."  He knew "in love with me" was probably a better description, but right now was a time to carefully choose his words.  "But you're afraid because you don't want to have sex with me, and it scares you.  And no matter how bad it was with her, you know what it's like already, and that's better than any unknown."  John wasn't really surprised by his feelings at all.  Pretty much every single person who had met both him and Sherlock had noticed those feelings, and had all but hit him over the head with the fact Sherlock Holmes loved him.  If he had to pick a reason why Sherlock never acted on those feelings, though, he wouldn't have come up with this one.
"Can me dad stay with me?" she said cautiously.  By this time her brother and sister were also in the room, and they sat at one of the deserted tables, took out what appeared to be a book of puzzles, and started doing one together.
"Go away.  I already told you that it wasn't up for discussion."  Despite what he said, Sherlock made no motion to leave the room.  "Save all your concern for the trial."
Sherlock's whole body sags, releasing tension John hadn't even noticed he had.  He wraps an arm around Hamish and looks away from John.  "Last night.  It was good of you."
"You know that the trial is closed today, right?" John hoped the prosecution would have mentioned it to him, but in the furor it might have slipped their minds.
"Pictures of you and her?  Engaged in sexual activity?"  John silently cursed himself for phrasing it in such an awkward way, but there was no taking it back.  Sherlock appeared to not notice that and moved his head in the smallest nod John had ever seen.  "What did you think would happen if she did send them to him?"
Dogs were one of the few things that never failed to soften Sherlock, and even in this situation that was still the case.  He knelt down to pet the little ball of fluff.
In sharp contrast, the Aherne’s flat was lit up like a birthday cake, creating a beacon of light that drew them in.  Lestrade was waiting outside for the two of them.  “Come on in,” he said.  “No one saw the intruder, but in the girl’s room the window screen has been cut.”  He escorted them inside without further details.
Of course, it wasn't.  Fifteen minutes passed before Sherlock returned to the office as if no time had passed at all, and in that time all John and Lestrade managed to do was shift uncomfortably in their chairs and not look each other in the eye.  "Do you have a tape of what that boy said?  Or a transcript?" Sherlock sat down in the remaining chair.
"After a point they said that she clearly wasn't going to tell anyone and questioning her wasn't doing any good."
This wasn’t like any nightmare he’d dealt with before, and he had no idea how to deal with it. “You’re safe here.”
"I see."  It sounded like Lestrade had already figured it out, or at least suspected it, because there was no surprise in his voice.  "Well, once I find out when the Ahernes can get down here tomorrow, I'll ring or text one of you with a time."
It was a good thing that Sherlock wasn't particularly talkative this time, because John was lost in thought himself. He kept hearing things Sherlock had said in the past.
"I wondered if it was something she didn't feel comfortable speaking about with me.  She's going to be a teenager in a few years, and we've had talks along that line but perhaps it was something she didn't think I'd understand.  She said there was nothing wrong, though."
This was easier said than done.  Since John knew no German, he was tasked with the arduous job of typing in the numbers one by one.  His hunt and peck typing only made it last longer.  Finally, after forty-five minutes of work, the program gave them a text message.  “CROOKED OFF ALWION ON CALL JAN GONE.”
Sherlock brought both of his arms up and squeezed Hamish tightly.  "I wanted to go there because She always talked about Her work and I wanted to see the things there.  So one Saturday when She went in I went with Her.  She showed me some of the things She used to check blood and for bacteria and I liked that.  Then after a few visits when we were done with those things we went into one of the exam rooms.  There was -" He stopped abruptly, swallowed, and went on.  "A girl was already in there.  Lying on one of those tables with the paper on them.  She told me to say hi."
"Well, I hope Susan and I can talk to him before he gets on the stand. Now we should go in."  Lou ascended the courthouse steps surprisingly swiftly, and John and Lestrade struggled to keep up with him.  As they walked down the main hall, Lou stopped at a set of doors and opened one to look into a vacant courtroom.  "We beat the buffalo," he said.
The Yard is of course ignorant about Sherlock's history, as is everyone but Mycroft, K, and Victor Trevor, so they are reasonably imagining this ending in tears. Even John thinks that it would be a potential disaster, but he's focused on finding the person first. And this is where we start seeing people assume by pronoun.
"No.  He thinks he should have done it."  Any further conversation was ended when Dominic showed back up with takeaway boxes.  All three ate in silence, and once that was done Martin fed Angus.  By the time court was in session again, Martin and John went back to the chatter of before, not mentioning his confession at all.
He dodged the question.  "Somewhat.  If you add no-strings-attached sex to that, the total is probably quite a bit bigger.  Medical students like to party."
"Did you both want Dr. Martin in an intimate way?"  When Sherlock merely stared silently at her, Harvey added: "You both say you spent a significant amount of time with her."
Most people wouldn't. Kids are the ones who ask the questions that no one else wants to ask because they haven't learned to mind their own business yet.
"It wouldn't make much of a difference even if you did, because you still wouldn't know what anyone did on this end."
Someone bellowed from downstairs. "You! Down here!" As much as Sherlock felt irritated by being ordered like a dog, he also knew this was where he'd have to live until he got his body back, and thus decided it was best to go downstairs.
"No.  She told me that the girl's mum and dad let her come in to see Her.  She never said the girl was there for a exam or a medical but everyone thought that."
"Her house isn't where you grew up," John said, more to keep the conversation going than anything else.
"Did the accused ever tell you a nursery rhyme?" Susan asked, obviously remembering what Jennifer and Phillip had said.
“Several times, I think.  He’s still worried he’ll be arrested for something.  And I think he finds comfort in the fact someone knows what he’s going through.”  He followed Lestrade into the office, and sat down in a chair opposite Lestrade’s desk.
"For very good reason.  My room is down the hall.  Shall we go there?"  Phillip nodded, clearly on the verge of tears, and the two of them walked down the hall together.
Sherlock walked over to the table the clock sat on.  The only thing on it besides the clock was a battered wallet.  The size of it indicated it belonged to whoever his body did.  He opened it and found one five pound note, a torn paystub with "get more laundry detergent" written on it, and a driving license, reversed so he could only see that the man was certified in the UK to drive a car, a minibus, and a motorbike.  He flipped it over and was faced with himself in his new body.  The man's name was Martin Crieff.   Nothing else was there.  The pay stub indicated he wasn't paid a lot, but he must have had some job that required travel.  The other man was probably a co-worker; if this Martin Crieff had a lot of one-night stands he would be carrying a great deal more money in his wallet, if nothing else.
Sherlock clearly wasn't expecting that, either; his mouth fell open in shock.  A minute passed where the two of them just stared at each other.  John broke the silence when he added: "I'd like to at least know where you're going all this time."
"All right," said Sherlock quietly.  He crept up to the sofa and lay down on it, not bothering to take his coat off, using Hamish as a pillow.
“Correct.  He said to others he had sold the house because it was too big for one person.  A few years later, he married and started a family.  Other than those suspicions I could not find that he even interacted with Sherlock.  I also discovered he didn’t let children there without a parent with them.  While I never stopped investigating him, I privately thought he was unlikely to be the suspect.”
In half an hour they were walking into the Yard and to Lestrade's office, like they had done a million times before.  Lestrade himself was standing in the doorway waiting for them.  "Come in.  The Ahernes will be here in an half an hour and I'm not sure how long this will take."  He looked grave as he led them in and motioned for them to sit down.  Sherlock unusually did so, and John was reminded that he couldn't have completely recovered in a matter of minutes.  If Lestrade thought this was odd he gave no sign of it.  "This is all I could get about our subject you brought us."  He sat down behind the desk and gestured to a small manila folder.  "Doctor Kelly Gene Martin.  Fifty-two years old.  She's been practicing pediatrics for thirty years.  Not a single complaint from a parent in that time, no reprimands from any workplace, not even a single traffic ticket.  Her school record is unblemished and she apparently skipped a few grades.  She was married for almost a year to a university classmate, nineteen years ago.  He was killed in an accident; apparently he fell on the third rail in the Underground.  She was out of the country at the time.  They had applied for a foster care license a few months after they were married, but it wasn't approved until after his death."  He paused as if to give them time to digest that piece of information.  "She's done emergency foster care on and off since then, and has never had a child with her for longer than a year.  The last time she cared for any children was around four years ago; she told the agency she needed a break and since she had been so consistent in taking hard to place children they were more than happy to allow her time.  There's never been any complaints there or any write-ups.  So far we have been unable to find any of the children she has fostered.  In short, without any sort of testimony from any victim, especially Moira and Phillip, there's no case to be built.  A jury'd take one look at her, see a nice older woman who's devoted her life to helping others, and she'd walk free."
"Yes I did, but they said in order to bring charges they'd need to find the man in question.  I didn't even know his name."
"I told Her I wasn't hiding and I came there to play.  She said to me that I could probably have a lot more fun somewhere else.  Then She asked if I liked ice cream."  He paused.  "I came out then and said I did.  When I saw Her She was wearing a different blouse, with flowers on it and a lot of buttons.  Only a few were done up, so you could see most of Her breasts, even more than from before."
"No laundry, but this flat has a washer and dryer."  Mrs. Murray stepped out of the bedroom and opened the other hall door, which revealed a washer and dryer stacked on each other.  "The only laundry nearby lost a few of my things right after I moved in here, so I made sure the tenants all had their own.  Of course my mystery tenant already had a set."
"She came to our flat and said She was going to take me out.  Then She took me to Her car and we drove to the hospital with the fucking room."
"And your mother died?" (John wondered how he'd managed to figure that out, and resolved to ask him later.)
Judge Foster then slammed down his gavel.  "The time is now six in the evening and the court is dismissed for the day.  We shall begin session tomorrow at nine AM."  He said it the same way every time, John noticed, like he felt better following a script.  The audience seemed to want to get away faster than usual, and went out the doors in record time.
"You're still here?" The boy from before, James, had apparently come back. He stood over Sherlock, with an expression of concern.
John didn't question the need to have extra support for Mr. Aherne or that Sherlock would apparently be talking to Phillip alone. Phillip was staring at the floor. He had made no indication that he was paying attention to the previous conversation and looked rather like he would not be there at all. He couldn't think of something consoling to say to the boy and was relieved when Sherlock spoke up. "You've had your cast off for what is it, two weeks now? I hope you've gotten some strength back in it now."
Once he'd showered and dressed, he headed into the kitchen, intending to make a large breakfast.  If Sherlock was going to be his usual self with Lou and Susan, he'd need all the energy he could get.  He put on coffee and made eggs, bacon, and toast.  Sherlock wandered in once the coffee was done.
John didn't know how much time passed before the door opened and Sherlock and Phillip came back out. Sherlock had a hand on the boy's shoulder. "You'll talk to me again?" Phillip said.
"Don't worry, I'll be home all day and I'll ring you as soon as he gets in the door," she reassured him.  He headed out feeling a bit relieved.
"We are staying right here in this car, which my driver will be driving in no particular pattern while we have a conversation. Now, while I'm sure there are hundreds of things you could want to speak to me about, I think this is one thing in particular. What is that?"
John took her advice, sort of, and walked up to the front step where the two of them were standing.  "We're not here to see the flat," Sherlock said with authority.  "Are you the landlady?  I'd like to ask you some questions about your tenants."
"Said that She couldn't get rid of me, and asked me to help in the garden.  I did and I got to climb the trees.  Sometimes She'd pick me up and spin me in the air.  Always said 'round and round like a teddy bear' then."  The poor grammar merely heightened the clipped tone of his voice.  "She'd touch me between my legs. A little each time."
The last stuck with him the most. It was almost like Sherlock had been trying to tell him something. After Mycroft's story it made a lot more sense. Even then, it sounded like there was another story to it. That he wouldn't be rude to Moira? Possibly. He seemed so calm when he talked to her. John wasn't sure he could have remained neutral when she told the "Are you a boy or a girl?" story. Even now it made him shudder. Had Sherlock been on the receiving end of such a conversation? He realized that if his abuser had really started doing so when Mycroft left for school, and only stopped after the bee incident, that meant he'd been subjected to ten years of abuse. Was there really enough loyalty there that Sherlock would never name this person, whoever he may be? Was that why Phillip Rodgers struck him so much? Could he see himself as Phillip and the abuser as the mysterious K?
This chapter is one of the most important, even though it's short, because it introduces Phillip to the reader. Phillip was specifically designed to be a parallel character to Sherlock - someone who he knew exactly what he was going through. Phillip is both modeled after and named for
"It's not there. Nothing is there that I remember. All gone." He hoped he wasn't going to start crying in front of this stranger.
John didn't look at any of the people who came in until he heard a collective intake of breath from behind him.  He turned to look as the doors swung open.  A man and woman in suits stood there, both of them saying a few words to the reporters.  As they talked they walked down to the dock.  And a few steps behind them was K.  She wore a neat business suit and her black hair had been pulled back into a bun.  She still had some of the motherly air she'd had before, but she also seemed very much the respectable professional.
John sat down on the sofa next to him, albeit leaving a space between the two of them.  "First of all, don't think you have to get drunk to tell me anything.  I promise that I won't get angry at anything you say."  He was probably asking for trouble with a policy like that, but putting Sherlock at ease was more important.  "Second - no, wait.  Have you ever kissed someone before?"  It seemed like a reasonable question, but as soon as it came out of his mouth Sherlock backed up against the arm of the sofa, clutching the bee even tighter.  "I'm sorry," John quickly said.  "Let me rephrase that.  Have you ever kissed someone that wasn't her?  In a romantic way?"  He almost said "kissed someone because you wanted to" but was smart enough to realize that might have the same answer the first question did.  Sherlock shook his head.  John could still see fear in his eyes.  "You know that relationships are about more than just physical affection, right?" he said.
"I've seen bits from shows on the telly," she cautiously replied, her smile vanishing.  "The solicitors get up and wave their hands around and say 'Objection!' a lot."
None of this was related to the recent news about the case, and it took John a bit to realize that Mycroft just needed to tell someone about it.  He wondered if Mycroft would eventually get to the news.
Sherlock reached into his coat pockets and pulled out a tape recorder.  It didn’t look like the ones the Yard used, so John assumed that he’d bought it earlier that day.  “I’m going to record our conversation so you don’t have to tell everything to the police again.  Is that all right with you?”
"Wrong number," he muttered and ended the call. Just to make sure, he fiddled with the mobile for a minute and eventually brought up a list of numbers called. The last two were exactly how he remembered Carolyn's number. Could it just be he wasn't remembering it right? If he rang the directory, at least he'd be able to find out. He put the number in, and when the person on the other end answered, he said "I'd like to look up a number."
"That's good, though," Mr. Rodgers said with a smile.  "He's finally learning how real friendship works.  I want to make sure they stay in contact."
Lou must have noticed John's startled expression, because he went on to explain: "Susan's the case computer.  She's memorized every victim's birthday, full name, and appearance.  She knows what every single potential witness looks like and how they relate to the case.  She's even memorized most of the details of the charges."
"A few days after it had happened.  I got told at the time she admitted what she'd done and was just waiting on a sentence.  It was right after that that social services had a review of Jennifer's case and decided that it would be best to transition her care back to me.  Her mother's rights would be restricted or terminated.  I'll admit that was a relief; I don't know what I would have done if they'd said I couldn't see Jennifer any more."
In the time it had taken Mycroft to leave, Sherlock's bee had wandered back to his lap.  He folded himself around it before saying, "Can we not have more of that talk today?"
"She faced fourteen years?  Rape of a child's life," John said with confusion.  He deliberately ignored the comments about K leaving the country once her sentence was served.  Mrs. Hudson took this as a sign to pick up her mug and leave.
"Why are all the curtains drawn on that ground floor flat?  Is the renter a night shift worker?"  He sounded like he had no idea who lived there himself, and was just asking because he was curious.
“Actually, she did not leave the area for a month or so after the bee was taken away.  I was misled by my mother on that.”  He paused, his face twisted in pain.  “One of them was a single man that lived nearby us.  Mr. A lived on a large set of grounds where he would hold bonfire night celebrations and sometimes let children view the sky through a telescope he had.  He sold the house and left the area days before I came home from school.”
All three of the Aherne children were in there.  Dierdre was off in a corner by herself, sitting amongst a herd of My Little Ponies.  Moira and Kieran were spread out over half the floor, with action figures of what appeared to be half the casts of both Star Wars and Doctor Who all around them.  Moira was making the Millennium Falcon circle above them.  She had her back turned to Sherlock and didn't turn around until he said, "Moira?" quietly.
!" John had started to talk in a normal voice, but by the end his face was red with shouting. He hadn't thought about the implications of this before, but suddenly he felt furious with Sherlock.
"I still don't have friends at school and Mum doesn't want me around and all I had was Her and you but they said we couldn't talk and I felt so alone I could burst."
Mr. Aherne opened the door, and the sweet smell of baking biscuits drifted out to them. Two pairs of green eyes were trying to peer past their father and out the door, but Moira's was not one of them.
He almost expected Sherlock to retort that it wasn't any of his business, but instead he looked away.  "Off.  Doing things," he muttered.
"Good." He looked back at the cut up vegetables and meat. "You are dismissed. I don't want to see you until dinner, which will be in one hour." Douglas' glare was sharp enough to drive him from the room. He nodded and left.
When they reached Lestrade's office John was surprised to see he was not alone. A familiar boy, one with shaggy black hair that fell into his eyes, was sitting in a chair opposite him. One hazel eye was half visible under the fringe. "John, Sherlock, as you may know this is Phillip Rodgers. He decided he'd rather not go to school today and I told him if he talked to Sherlock he wouldn't be taken in for playing truant." Lestrade sounded very matter-of-fact. "Mr. Aherne will be here soon to listen to the tape the two of you made, and I think it would help if you were there too, John."
"Moira wants me to come back, so yes, you will. We have to deliver the tape to the Yard first, but Lestrade says that if you want to listen to it you can go down there tomorrow." Sherlock sounded once more confident and professional. It was hard to imagine he was the same person who had been so gentle with a child minutes ago.
John swallowed.  There wasn't really a good way to answer that.  "It would depend.  Since you told me you were married to your work I took that to mean you were not interested in romantic relationships.  I still wanted to be your friend.  I still am.  I think this case is stirring up a lot of feelings in you and that's why you're thinking about relationships so much.  And knowing all that I don't think you're fully in a position where you can determine that.  After this case is over that might be different."
"February is the cruelest month," John commented as he got tea for the both of them. He knew it wasn't a correct quote, but it was apt enough to make Lestrade chuckle.
Tammy caught something in his voice and said, "But it's your friend too, isn't it? You sound like it's something you're going through every day, like me."
"Well, there was one thing that I found... strange.  Most of the time when you examine a child patient, there's a parent in the room.  Obviously not with older children, but with ones that haven't reached puberty yet.  She never let a parent come in when she examined children - and since she's a pediatrician all her patients were children.  I asked her about it, since it wasn't the usual practice.  She told me that parents often get hysterical when you need to do some invasive procedure, like immunizing them or having to prick a finger for blood.  It was easier if they just waited outside."
"I presume Dana Lester is an alias?"  One good thing about Sherlock's long deductions was that John had plenty of time to eat while he spoke.
Both of them walked together to the exit doors, John going to hail a cab while Victor pulled out his mobile and said he needed to be picked up.  John's ride home was silent and grim.
He opened his eyes.  The ceiling was definitely one of a shabby hotel room.  He looked to the left and saw an electrical outlet with three small holes in a row.  So he was in Germany, then.  He looked to the right and saw a large man with salt and pepper hair sleeping facing the other wall.  There was nothing else to easily see and so Sherlock got out of the bed.  It was then he realized something had happened that was more severe than just being moved.  He was four or five inches shorter than he usually was.  Time to make his way to a mirror, then.
"A custody hearing," Sherlock told him.  "Nothing you've done will come up.  They will just ask you where you want to live."
"They go where work is," Lou said.  "The father does handyman work and the mother cleans houses.  They both worked with an agency until last year, but it closed down.  Nothing steady since then."
John couldn't help but notice Sherlock had said something so indirect as "on trial for child abuse" rather than the more horrible truth "on trial for repeatedly raping children."  A way of distancing himself from the truth, he supposed.  "Do you need money for a cab?" John asked, thinking they might need the offer.
When he was finally back and opening the front door he was surprised to see Phillip Rodgers standing in the hall.  "Did you come to see us?" he asked.
Oh, that hat.  He couldn't escape the damn thing.  "That was just for a picture.  I don't wear it otherwise."
"The next day I went down to the social services office so they could interview me.  They asked if I knew anyone who I thought could have hurt Jennifer and I said I didn't know.  They asked about Debra and if she had a boyfriend, and I said as far as I knew she didn't.  I did mention that she did quite  a bit of drugs but even with that she'd never hurt Jennifer.  I got asked about our relationship, and I told them the drugs had ended it and we'd shared time with her since."
Both Mr. Aherne and Moira walked up to the mirror.  Shortly after they did that, the lights came on.  Six people, three men and three women, were in line.  They were all similar, short and with black hair.  Dr. Martin was second to the right.  John sneaked a glance at Mr. Aherne's face and saw no recognition or shock there.  Clearly he had never met Dr. Martin before.  Moira looked at the line for a second, eyes wide, and took a step back, squeezing the bear in her arms tighter.  She was still for thirty seconds or so, like she was making sure that no one in the line could see her.  When she appeared convinced that she was truly not able to be seen, she slowly shifted her bear to one arm, raised the other arm and pointed to the person second to the right.
Sherlock said nothing, but stood up with Hamish in his arms and went up the stairs.  John got dressed for bed in his own room, thinking that Sherlock needed the extra privacy more than ever, and when he went back down Sherlock had already curled himself around Hamish under the covers.
“All right.”  He paused.  “Do you want your father to stay here when we talk or do you want him to leave?”
While it seemed to be an off-the wall thing to say, John suspected it was the truth.  Sherlock seemed to have dealt with the situation by putting it out of his mind; not precisely disassociation but more of an "out of sight, out of mind" scenario.  If he didn't have to think about it, he didn't have to deal with the feelings that came with it.  Of course, since the whole thing wasn't something you could neatly put away, it reached into all aspects of his life until he convinced himself he really didn't feel anything (which conveniently made her right about him).  As a result, Sherlock was nothing but his intelligence - the very thing that made so many people avoid him.  That also prevented him from having to make any new relationships where he might have to let his shields down.  Now John had to try to chip through them.
"They already liked what they saw of his music and art.  And he really needs a new place to study."  Mr. Rodgers' words were cut off as Phillip and Sherlock emerged from the bedroom.
"We'd talk about things.  She liked it when I showed Her all the tricks Rory could do.  Sometimes She'd give me sweets or lemonade."
On one hand, John was glad that Sherlock actually seemed to be showing some emotion, but he wished he wasn't the target.  "You're right, maybe I don't understand even part of it.  It's still very clear you're in pain, though.  Even if I can't understand that pain I can still be concerned for you."
"That would be good of you, especially since Sherlock's got a rapport with Moira no one else has.  It might make the whole thing less stressful for her."
"Yes, but this has some initials on it, or there wouldn't be the dots."  He turned the flash drive over in his hands.  "It's not ten years old.  He must have moved the information."  At the moment there was nothing but interest in his voice and deduction in his eyes.  This case might be just what Sherlock needed to distract himself from the horrible news.
Sherlock started talking again before Lestrade could open his mouth.  "Once they're done testifying other people will do so, but you don't need to be there for that.  It'll probably be a long time before the trial is over.  If She is found guilty then She will be sentenced and that's a different set of hearings."
"Because that's how people like that woman -" here she gestured to the front page again - "work.  Find a little one who doesn't have something they need and give it to them."  She paused.  "Unless it was his mother?"
Phillip laughed. "Sometimes. I mostly do my drawing at home. Sometimes I go to the park to do it, though."
"Are you close to your dad?"  Clark obviously knew that line of questioning was going to hurt their case; he switched the subject without a second thought.
"That's right," Sherlock told her.  He turned to face the one-way mirror.  "See that mirror over there?  It's different from most mirrors because you can see through it to the other side but the people on the other side can't see you.  Now, the police have found someone they think might be K."  Moira's eyes widened, whether from fear or shock John couldn't tell.  "Your job is to look at the people behind the mirror and tell us if K is there.  If K is there, you point to K.  If K isn't there, you tell us that K isn't there.  Do you think you can do that?"  He looked at her expectantly.
After she was sworn in, and Lou had come to stand next to the witness stand, Judge Foster turned to her and said, "You just have to answer the questions you're asked.  If you don't know the answer, say you don't know."  She nodded.
"Like what?" It was truly amazing that even after all Phillip had been through, he could still sound so innocent.
"They arrested Her for doing things," he mumbled, and looked away.  Like with Sherlock, John could hear the capital letter in the word “her”.
Once the court was reseated after lunch, Lou came up to the stand.  "The prosecution calls John Aherne."  As an usher led Mr. Aherne to the witness stand John could see the terrible effect the case still had on him; he had lost weight and looked somewhat like a man condemned.  John assumed Sherlock's warning that the defense would try to savage him on the stand weighed heavy in his mind.
"You'll feel better if you do."  John fell silent.  He couldn’t think of anything to say that wasn't about the nightmare.
"Well, she started seeing a therapist.  He's been very helpful.  She seems less anxious and isn't panicking once I'm out of her sight.  There's still nightmares and crying jags, though.  And she's started bringing up what that woman did to her on her own."  Anger crept into his voice.
"And he hasn't e-mailed you or anything like that?"  It didn't take a genius to figure out why Sherlock was being so encouraging with Phillip.  However, the emotions it seemed to bring up in him made John wish he could just talk about it like anyone else would.  "Since we're talking about lying by omission here," he added.
"You're listed as both victim and witness.  Any witness not related to the victims can be identified in the press.  Any victim is protected by a court order and can only be referred to by number in the press or related documents.  You are currently covered because your testimony will establish a pattern of behavior.  Unless you want that restriction to be removed?"  Lestrade looked Sherlock directly in the eye.  After a few seconds, Sherlock broke eye contact and looked once again at the paper on the desk.
"Well, you're going to have to drink it anyway."  He poured two mugs of coffee and brought them into the other room.  He hadn't made anything else on the assumption that Lou and Susan would be giving him something for breakfast like they always did.  And true to be told, what they brought was always better than what he could quickly make at home.
"Yes.  The mortgage was paid off by a one-time bonus to the CEO.  Me.  Now the house is ours, and we can continue to conduct the business the money was so generously earmarked for."  So, their business had once been in financial trouble, only saved by someone, probably a client, dying and willing them a large sum of money.  The woman didn't look like the type who threw money away without thinking.
Mrs. Hudson was there to greet him as he came in through the door.  "I'm so glad you're home," she said.  "We've had a parade of those homeless people in and out all day - they've all brought him newspapers - and the Rodgers boy arrived just after you left and only went when the trial was over."  She didn't mention the effect the trial was having on Sherlock; there was no need.
