His Holmes turned to look piercingly at him.  “I will dress.  Then we will take a stroll around the park before looking for a restaurant for supper.”
Well.  John needed to urinate, and that meant cuddling would have to take a backseat to a full bladder.  Not that John cuddled anyone except his children.  No.  Not at all.  He kept that in mind as the blankets were unwrapped with difficulty from the inside. Kicking was required, though the man tried not to make violent contact with his spouse.
Siger gave him a commiserating look.  “It’s okay, Dad.  I’ll help you get it all off when we get home.”
Siger asked a question, looking up at Uncle Mycroft.  “Yes, Siger,” Mycroft answered him. “That is an electric light.  And they would have used gas in that time period instead, as your father told you.  But remember, the Muppets are giving a play.  So they would be using anachronistic items.  Sometimes it is alright to have something incorrect, if it furthers the plot, or allows the play to proceed. Your father was, in all likelihood, jesting about a movie being made with gas lighting.”
John Watson, tired but responsible, finished sterilizing the kitchen from several days of Sherlock’s manic chemistry disguised as cookery.  He was not complaining, as it was just regular type cleaning, and not bio-hazardous or industrial waste recovery.  Siger was fast asleep on the couch, curled around Lambkin, the violin, and his new stuffed red blood cell.  John had stopped asking where Sherlock and Mycroft found these things.
“Jeanette sent us her new recording.  Christmas music, but it ends with Flight of the Bumblebee,” Sherlock told his spouse, and ignoring his protest.
John Watson shivered, for all that he was wrapped in an orange shock blanket.  Mrs. Hudson had come ‘round, and was similarly wrapped, her head laid in John’s lap as they sat on the ground in the car park, waiting for the ambulance.  A taxi pulled up, looking oddly out of place here in the almost deserted industrial area, and a tall, lanky figure stepped out, then hurried toward them.
Sherlock focused on the feel of the bending, woody cherry stem in his mouth, and twisted it round with his tongue, bracing it against his teeth, and missing twice before sliding the end home through a loop.  He spat the piece out into his palm at the same moment John spit his own out.  A tie.
The patron, his nondescript face, hair, and clothing likely to fade into the crowd but for the large, irregular black mole on his forehead, reached for the thick old tome with fingers crowned by nails bitten to the quick.  “He,” the man began, and John thought that even his voice was non-descript, “How does he know?”  There was desperation in his tone.
“Would you prefer that I sit with my knees bunched up to my chest?” his partner asked sarcastically.  “Is it my turn yet for this inane game?”
His stomach growled again.  He wished John were here.  Not for John’s love, or company as such.  But because Sherlock wanted to take out his unhappiness on someone.  Long suffering Dr. Watson would do nicely for that.  For one thing, he was wearing that eye sore of a blue plaid shirt that Sherlock hated.  Sherlock ruminated on the words  he could use to thoroughly piss John off.
Mycroft Holmes, tall, long noised, and ginger haired, made a decision.  “You’re going to take them where?” Greg Lestrade had laughter in his voice.
John was thankful that he was no longer vomiting.  Ross, snuggled beside him, was radiating heat, as John knew he was as well.  She was asleep again, and they’d done their best to keep her temperature down to prevent seizure or any of a number of reactions infants get to high fever. The Graco was situated at the foot of the bed, but she had asked to be taken out before falling asleep uncomfortably in John’s arms.   John was sick, er, bored with Lemsip.  He was tired of the bedroom, and yet his eyes hurt if he watched the screen of his laptop.  He could not concentrate on even the simplest of thrillers.  Too much company fretted him, and otherwise he was lonely.
“Well, Siger,” the tone was cheery enough, but her truly awful teeth distracted the young Holmes from what she was saying.  They weren’t ogre’s teeth, by any stretch of the imagination, but they had not been shown care in the woman’s forty odd years of life.  “Have you thought much about our discussion last week?  About your future?”
It was amazing, John thought, how quickly his detective could leap from a lying position.  “You’re considering it, aren’t you?  John, you thought that imuring me in Baker Street would drive me insane, but you’re considering sequestering me in a house with Mycroft.  Are you mad?” Sherlock demanded.
My understanding is that Benedict Cumberbatch has to wash his hair carefully to keep the dye in.  He swims daily, and the chlorine from the pool is not kind to the dye.   Otherwise, his hair is reddish.
Or perhaps he started it all months before that when he helped an elderly neighbor who had fallen while trying to carry groceries up her front steps.  Her cries for help had been heard by a young professional who lived downstairs from her, and who had sent his daughter for Dr. Watson.  John suspected that Mrs. Brewer had broken her hip.  He sat with her while they waited for the ambulance, and kept her immobilized and calm.  Mrs. Brewer had been very grateful, but after John’s diagnosis was found to be accurate, had given up the flat and gone to an assisted living establishment after getting out of hospital.
“You and your crazy man.  Don’t you worry about keeping the kids safe?” Harry didn’t know the meaning of subtlety, but she did try for a conciliatory tone.
There were kisses and “goodnight”s all around.  The light was turned out, and the fairy lights switched on.  Siger listened to his parents as they closed the door.  “Honestly, Sherlock,” Daddy was saying, “‘an imaginary animal created by the author specifically for eating at Christmas?’ ‘No correlation?’”
True.  The criminal, a short, fat blackmailer-turned-murderer had panicked and taken the closest method of escape.  It was a miracle that he’d gotten this far.
“You’ve never had ham with bananas?  You’ve had it with raisin sauce, haven’t you?” Daddy grinned at them.  Siger decided that Daddy was having a joke with
And, John realized, from in the sitting room as well.  Sherlock snuffled, shifted to get more comfortable, and began to snore softly in the circle of John’s arms.
True, Sherlock did tend to read informational materials.  He often read from his technical journals and articles out loud at night to the children.  The consulting detective found that helped him to discover more in the writing than he would have found in reading it to himself, much like having John give him feedback allowed for illumination on the subject.  Even if John was invariably incorrect.
Siger thought a bit.  Then he said steadily and sing-song, , “In winter I get up at night and dress by yellow candle-light.  In summer, quite the other way, I have to go to bed by day.”
Mrs. Hudson pulled the extra dough from around the cut out figures, then slipped a lifter under each one to transfer it to the flat metal sheet.  Palming the remnants into a ball, she rolled it out again into a flat expanse for Siger to cut.  This time, with the smaller amount, the boy cut out stars, fitting the three inch cutter into a pattern that took up a surprisingly efficient amount of dough.
“Do you remember all of those people who were ill in November and December?  ‘Something going around’?” John looked up from his laptop, and an article on bat physiology and disease.
“That reminds me,” Daddy said as he flipped on the kettle switch again, “We’ve missed Alice Brown’s cantata this year.  She did too, as she couldn’t sing with the flu.”
John waved a hand.  “I always thought I’d take him to his first game.  But, yeah.  It’s okay.  Sort it out with Mycroft and let me know.”
Reaching down to run his fingers through the greying blond hair, Sherlock asked, “Is this one of those scenarios where we pack up the children, and move to the cottage in Sussex?  Because that’s hardly secluded anymore.  Even if we started building a wall now.”
“Yes, of course,” Sherlock tossed the officer the ring of extra keys.  “We’ll let you know where we’re staying.  You’ll need us to sign the statements, correct?”
Mycroft’s stomach growled embarrassingly, to be answered antiphonally by Greg’s as the detective inspector turned chef gave the prawns a final toss.  Tonight they were eating in the kitchen.  Anna was away for an extended Christmas holiday, and the pair were taking full advantage of her absence.
“Siger?” Sherlock waited until those sparkling eyes met his.  “I will discuss this with Daddy, and then we will include you in the final decision.”
No one had been harmed.  Well, not physically. A row of child seats faced them from the back facing seat - Siger, Miri, and Ross were watching their daddy with owl eyes,   Will had cried for a bit after it was all over, but now slept the sleep of the ignorant innocent in his candy striped plush footies.
“You two are a bit weird,” Gregory Lestrade pointed at them with his fork.  He was mollified when the top tier arrived.  There were raspberry and pistachio brownies.  Mycroft chose not to inform his partner as to their gluten-free provenance.  Nor that the raw white chocolate and raspberry cheesecake contained no sugar.
Sherlock had lost what Moriarty had called “virginity” in killing, murdering really, those whom he could not set up for capture and imprisonment. And he was not picky about it, as John would have been.  John Watson with his moral compass.  Sherlock had killed them.  Just as John had shot the murderous cabby, Sherlock had made sure those men and women who would have harmed John, and Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade would never hurt another soul ever again.  Not that he cared about any soul other than those of John, Mrs. Hudson, and Lestrade.
Siger looked over at his Dad and cocked his head in imitation of Sherlock.  The twins turned and looked at their father, then back to their brother and other father, and then slowly, and a bit eerily, copied that cocking of the head precisely.
“Thank you, Mrs. Hudson,” John Watson smiled up at their landlady.  Waving Siger over he asked, “Do you need any help, Siger?”
“You don’t want to discuss anything to do with Mycroft ever,” John said, though Sherlock scarcely needed to be reminded of that.
London had not changed.  Buildings might have, and shops.  But the people were all the same.  If fewer of Jim Moriarty’s old network were around, Cuddles could still find someone who would help for money.  Or fear.  First he found a mid-priced hotel.  Jim Moriarty had always been specific.  No one was to live on the streets.  There were eyes under the bridges, and in the tunnels.  Nosy eyes, that tattled to the wrong ears.
It took John Watson an extended period of time to realize that Sherlock Holmes was giving him gifts.  The items and services were sporadic, irregular.  They were often unsigned, and when they were labeled, it was frequently something like, “John!” or “Look at this!”  As though John did not have the wit to notice that the event or object was for him.
At two hours and half past the door to the holding area opened and a silver-haired figure entered.  “Well, Kitten,” the Detective Inspector grinned at her, “You’re the last person I expected to see here.”
Siger, Ross, and Miri nodded solemnly.  John gave a snort of laughter that turned into a yelp when Sherlock began to apply the liquid base.  “It helps to warm the base up, as it can be quite cold.  One can do that with your hands if you choose.  Keep in mind that you’ll need nitrile gloves if you’re putting makeup on someone other than yourself.”
Morning came slowly.  Mrs Hudson, having enjoyed a soother before climbing up into the dark carved wood and luxuriant mattress of the bed, woke startled to complete darkness.  Rolling over onto a frying pan did not make her mood any more pleasant.
Père looked annoyed, but he was holding both Miri and Ross now, while Bert brought up the pram.  “Right,” Daddy said moving forward, “Are you finished, Siger?” Daddy sounded annoyed.  Siger weighed whether or not he wanted to let Daddy get angry and shout.
What with the flu, there had been little to no discussion about what they would be eating for Christmas Lunch.  When John asked Siger what he liked best to eat for Christmas, the answer had been, “Cake, Daddy.”
quickly kissed Daddy on the head, took one of the spoons, and started feeding Ross so efficiently that she had no time to spit it back out.  “Sorting the mail,” was his answer.
“Charles will take them up to your rooms,” Anna told him.  “Children would you like some hot chocolate before going to your bedroom?”
Will did not like his snug sack.  He kicked up what Daddy called an “unholy fuss” when Daddy tried to put him into it.  “Nanananana,” Will babbled, then “no!”
Holmes took the time to enjoy the flavor of tea with just the right amount of honey. It was just warm enough, without burning his mouth.  Then he said, “In fact, you were complaining.  But you wisely used logic to see my side of the issue.  The question now is whether or not you would like to eat a British beef roast with Yorkshire pudding expertly cooked by either Anna or Mycroft at my brother’s establishment, or go through the bother of catering a meal here.  I highly doubt that either of us are either in the mood, or up for the effort of cooking a large and involved dinner that only you will really appreciate.”
It was a funny thing.  Even though Mother wanted him to succeed in his classwork, or said she did, this was the only place that James knew he had her approval.  It was a different type of approval.  As though she was proud of him here.  But school, and maths, and everything else was just so that James could get good at shooting.
“John, you should have gotten that one.  It was part of the cases with Moriarty!” the consulting detective returned with asperity.
Off Siger hopped to examine the selection of ties available.  “Will you show me how to tie it, Uncle Mycroft?”
“You used to sing that to him as a lullabye,” Sherlock from his comfortable queen-sized bed under the warm duvet, and next to his comforting and warm-as-a-furnace husband.
Or that Sherlock Holmes, who so frequently and ostentatiously forgot his own brother’s birthday always managed to quietly schedule Harry’s time with their children to occur on John’s sister’s birthday,or the celebration of Harry’s time dry, or at a moment when Clara was visiting - illustrating to Harry’s ex that her former partner was not irredeemable.
John Watson turned to his partner, Sherlock Holmes, who was standing in the doorway listening.  “Did you tell him that?  I don’t remember telling him that.  Where does he come up with these things?  No answer?  Of course not.  You’re storing that in your Mind Palace, aren’t you?”
Sherlock leaned back in the rocker.  “Mummy had an account book.  No computer.  I was told what amount I had to spend.  So much for Mycroft, so much for Father.  So much for each person - Family, of course, had a larger amount than that set aside for the servants, or for other individuals.  Should we choose to give gifts to others outside of the household.  I do not believe Mycroft or I were much given to gift giving otherwise.”
John’s partner was taking advantage of John’s current domesticity, and captivity by their daughter, to review.  Sherlock Holmes did not believe in luck, although he used the term “lucky” as a phrase often enough.  It was a way of communicating with the common human being.  They believed in luck, that invisible force that allowed them to get what they wished for without making an actual effort.  Sherlock Holmes worked for what he attained.  And if sometimes things happened in his favour without deliberate intent, then that was not luck.  It was happenstance or coincidence, or the conspiracy of whatever criminal he was currently chasing after.
Siger thought he would try to get the donkey from Miri, who was generally more liberal with toys, only to find that she had disappeared.  Crawling around the corner of the couch he could see her lying on her tummy in the hall.  She still had the donkey held tightly in her right hand.  He watched as she scrunched her knees up to her belly, and then, like an inchworm, slithered her front out.  It was not so much a crawl as well, a two part relocation of various bits of her body at a time.  Siger, who was an observing boy, watched her make her way slowly in this fashion until she was bumping into Daddy’s and
“Those are trajectories for the catapult that James and I are building.  I’m planning a medieval castle, and James is helping me figure out the siege engines that we’d need to guard against.  And what we’d need to have on the walls to repel invaders!”
He’d had to talk quick when the Elf (what was her name, Jolie?  June?) had arrived, very late for her shift.  She’d asked where Sam was, but it was easy enough to tell her that Sam was in hospital from a car smash.
Common sense said to take out the two at Baker Street first.  Easier targets - both the man and the woman would go out every day.  Then go to ground and wait for the furor to die down before taking on the DI and the posh git.  No bodyguard for any but the ginger, nor eyes on them that lived in the Baker Street house.  At least not that Cuddles could see.  The house was full of people though.  A kid too.  Cuddles didn’t want nothing to do with no kids.  Not anymore.
John Watson looked at his son, and then at his spouse.  “Royal jelly?”  he said aghast, “I’m not the Queen bee!”
“Well, with the baby coming in a couple of months, I thought we could get them a set of the Harry Potter books in hardcover.  And wands,” John added.
"I’ve learned it’s best to wait and see what wild adventures Sherlock will drag us all into.  Because I certainly don’t think any of us can guess what will happen next.  Please let me know if there’s anything I can do to help - because with the chaos that surrounds Sherlock and John, there’s always something odd to be done.”
“Do you really think it would be wise to expose Sherlock to Adler again?” Mycroft Holmes asked blandly. “Really, John, I thought you would jump at the chance to keep them apart.”
by Charles Dickens that was available on DVD with his husband, Mycroft Holmes.  If there was a production of the epic Christmas story available, his Mycroft would purchase it.  This went for any of the plays of William Shakespeare as well.
“No!” Captain John Watson was certain in his voice of command, “There will be no biohazardous  material in this flat.”  On second thought, “No experiments with germs, Sherlock. None.  Do you understand?”  Because human and animal body parts could be consider a bio hazard certainly.
John grimaced, “That’s just it.  There was nothing.  No hint.  And now rumors are starting to come out from behind the bamboo firewall.”
When naptime came, Bert made Siger come downstairs so that he would not keep his sisters up with his buzzing.  Bert had told Siger he was “busy as a bee” and after that Siger dug up his rubber bees and formed a hive in the sitting room out of the orange shock blanket and his Daddy’s chair.
“What’s that?” the bigger man turned turned his craggy face to look down at the little boy.  He unsuccessfully dusted his hands together to rid them of pine sap. “My dog?  He’s a good one, yeah.”
told him seriously, “Take the camera - it’s over there on the bookcase - and record this experiment step-by-step.
I worked with a child who was the age of my older offspring.  But emotionally, physically?  He was two years delayed.  Even after years with a loving adoptive family.
pretended to be startled.  Then he admitted, ‘Yes, SIger, it is for you and for Rosalind, and for Miranda.”
From the stoop Mrs. Hudson said, “Don’t worry, dear.  They’ll come up for air eventually.  I’ll get something cool for us all to drink.”
They went back to look at the picture of the creature on the platter ready to be carved and served.  “Siger,”
Seb’s directions to the flunky flowed coolly past Tony’s bored speculation on the contents of the liquor cabinet.  Then, “Wake up, Anthony.  Make certain the boy understands his homework.  I’ll see you both at the dinner table.”
“I think that’s going to be the biggest conspiracy theory,” John admitted.  “Newest novel coronavirus from China.  They’re keeping information under tight wraps though.  It’s not showing up in the journals, or on the news.”
Cuddles belonged to Jim Moriarty.  Body and soul.  If he had a soul.  Cuddles was not given overmuch to religious reflection.  Cuddles was not given to much thought at all.  Why bother, when he had others to do his thinking for him? At six foot five, with a shaven scalp highlighting white scars against the sunburn red of his skin, Cuddles was not a man to have the ladies tip him a wink.  Most people would not meet his eyes.  He liked it that way.
“Wuv,” Siger lisped.  Then, looking down at his new baby sister he said softly to her, “Wosawind Wuv.”
Not sure how long this link will last, but here's the set.  http://thumbs.ebaystatic.com/images/g/dSwAAOSwiYFXIUnu/s-l225.jpg
They had enough time while the others were sleeping to find presents for Grammy Hudson, Miss Alice Brown, for Bert, and the new cousin who would be coming to Uncle Mycroft’s and Unka Greg’s house.  Afterward Siger helped Pere to get suppers (because they had completely missed tea) of broth and dried toast for Daddy, for Ross, and for Miri.  Then Pere made a fry up for themselves.  After putting all of their “patients” as Pere kept calling them, back to bed, the pair of them watched a film about bees, which Siger had to go up and find his rubber bees for.  Pere wiped them down with a bleach wipe “for sanitation”, before Siger could play with them.  And they both had to wash their hands thoroughly after the bees had been wiped.
In the absence of conversation, the sounds of the street seemed magnified - cars traveling Baker Street, passers-by chattering on the pavement, and a siren in the distance. Suddenly, John gave a snort. A giggle broke loose, and the blond doctor leaned back in his chair and laughed until he was out of breath.
John Watson was patching up the knife slice to the consulting detective’s arm.  It wasn’t deep, but it was nasty.  Stitching was necessary.  John was precise and neat in his sewing.  Danger removed the tremor.  They were pinned down by a maniac with a rifle.  Dangerous enough.
“Yes, he’s very thoughtful.  Your cardigans?  No, I haven’t heard from the adjuster yet.  Oh.  He’s there now.  Yes.  I promise we will replace your jumpers.
relaxed on the sofa, and Siger got out his crayons and paper to colour while they listened to Flute’s cd.  There were a number of Christmas Carols, including “Bring a Torch, Jeanette Isabella” with the vocal quartet singing in English, but the album concluded with a flute version of Rimsky Korsakov’s Flight of the Bumblebee.  Siger asked his
“Thirteen is a difficult time.” then as Siger nodded encouragingly, an imitation of John that made Sherlock’s heart lift, “I did not know what I wanted to do at that age.  I loved science.  Music.  I wanted to be learning, experimenting, doing things. And avoiding people.”
“I had thought,” Mycroft said as he picked up his glass for a sip, “that we would go with Christmas colours.  I would not shop with the girls together.  They would select their outfits without knowing what the other has chosen.”
Long fingers reached over to turn off the intercom system in the sitting room.  “You’re expecting something,” Sherlock said to him.  The children were in bed, they wouldn’t be hearing them through the – as Miri put it – grown up monitor, and he’d put off this discussion until the last case was over.  It had been an intriguing case starting as a treasure hunt of a will, and ending in murder.  “What did Mycroft tell you?”
John Watson was not a large man.  Even so, airplanes (and he was flying first class courtesy of Mycroft Holmes) were getting more cramped.  If he’d have been flying with his partner, their children, and the au pair (with whom they had only flown once, but that was quite enough. Thankyouverymuch), this “simple trip” would have been incredibly complicated. Imagining Sherlock Holmes squeezed in beside him - long legs trapped against the backward leaning seat of the woman in front of John, brought a smirk to his lips, and distracted him for a few moments.
“Good.”  Sherlock Holmes headed down into their agency’s office.  “You can plan your literary strategy after you set up the fairy lights.”
They’d put Rosalind in Time Out for the first time after that.  Where Sherlock would simply have entered his Mind Palace, Ross was wild at having to sit for the five minutes they’d had her on the bottom step.  Siger did not like Time Out either, mostly because he was not allowed to speak or ask questions when he was on the step.
“Spoil sport,” Daddy told him as he brought a tray in to the coffee table.  Setting a small plate out for Siger, he served his son a triangle of fish paste sandwich, one of cucumber, a couple of crisps, and a chocolate caramel biscuit.  Into Siger’s mug he poured a bit of sugar, a touch of cream, and filled the rest half way with black tea.  “Let it cool, Siger,” he said before sharing out food and tea for
“In any case,” Sherlock went on brushing rouge onto John’s cheeks, “Here I am putting a lighter colour on above the dark to emphasize the bone, and make the face look slender, less masculine.”
“Half a dozen, young man,” answered the goose owner, “and as nice and plump a flock of geese as you will ever see.”
Sherlock caught hold of his arm on the way up the stairs.  “I’ll be waiting for you here.  We should spend some 'quality time' together,” he’d said quietly, dropping his baritone and cocking an eyebrow suggestively.
Business suits in the seats behind and cattycorner. John had no doubt that Sherlock would have been able to tell him exactly what type of businesses.  John could see that not all of those suits were bespoke, and at least one of them was fairly well worn. He did see symptoms of hypertension, one man under the influence, and male pattern baldness.
“Here, darlin’,” a short - alright, about John’s height -  dock worker waved the zaftig waitress over, “bring us a dish of maraschino (he pronounced it ‘mara-skee-no) cherries! Make sure they’ve got their stems, mind!”
There are occasional sounds from what looks like a radio - the soft soughing of infant breathing, the coo of a dreaming child, and the creak of their cribs or a twin sized bed.  When a sound comes through too loudly, both men turn their heads to listen, then when it is evident that no emergency exists, they go back to what they were reading - each on their own device.
“Yes, yes,” Sherlock waved that away before starting to outline John’s lips.  “You three would not need colouring on your lips.  You’ve got lovely colouring there already.  I’m going to make your Daddy’s lips look just a little fuller, but we’ll pick a shade of lipstick that won’t scream for attention.”
Siger slept in his own bed, and was grateful for it.  He listened to the sounds of Miri and Ross - both still a little congested and snoring - in their cribs.  The fairy lights were flashing just enough to brighten the room, but not to hurt his eyes.
“Daddy?” Ross leaned against his leg, she and her faded red teddy bear resting their heads on the comfort of a father at home after missing him for the past few weeks.  Ross did not speak often.  Some of their acquaintances had never heard the little dark-haired girl speak.
“Behind me, Dad.  Look!  Mr. Chatterjee gave us some pots for the garden!” Siger’s face shone with excitement under his halo of red curls.  “Will we plant some medicinal herbs?  Like for Mrs. Hudson’s soothers?”
“In the props closet, behind the throne.  Be careful, the door sticks.  Sam got locked in there yesterday,” she said snottily over her shoulder before going back to flirting with that Asian kid who’d been with the gay guys.  Not that he had a problem with gays.  But their kids had been pretty odd with their staring at him.
Sherlock’s scoff was tangible, “The news.  As though they care about correct information.  Are you reading between the lines in the articles?  Sometimes you miss things, John.”
“Good job, Siger, now take a look at this,” and they pushed past a wall of branches to find a small open area.  “What do you see?”
The other two were a pencil-nosed ginger gent, and a little blond bloke.  Easy enough, Cuddles supposed.  Giving Tiger Moran a nod, he packed his bags, the file with the pics in the outside pocket, and went to ground in the north.
Sherlock raised his head enough to kiss those familiar lips.  “Not a deal.  But a promise.  Now, unfortunately, I hear Siger on the monitor, which means no time for me to practice ‘wandlery’, or whatever it’s called, on you.”
In the next car, a silver sedan, the driver was less informative, and even less entertaining.  John received a key card, and a folder when the car stopped in front of a small, modern house.  Grabbing his overnight from the backseat, and his satchel from the trunk, he was left standing alone in the drive.  “I’m not used to being alone anymore,” the doctor said outloud.
or Daddy or Bert or Grammy Hudson, or whomever put them to bed at night chose to read went to the far left of the shelf.  Books on the far right and bottom shelf tended to be books that they had never read, that the children were not old enough for yet, or that the adults did not care to read.
An avalanche of baby babble tumbled out as Rosalind Margaret tried to tell her father everything that had happened, interspersed with questions about Siger and Miri Cat.  At least according to Sherlock's translation.  Were they okay?  Was
In the white china bowl, the chemically induced redness of the preserved cocktail cherries gleamed in the lowered light.  “Alright,” said the perfectly finely heightened dockworker, “Who wants to go first, eh?”
“So,” Lestrade clarified, “It’s a supremely ugly jumper that shows the worst excesses of Christmas consumerism, one of which is Ugly Jumpers?”
Siger took the last envelope and disposed of it with a bit less frenzy, and a little more skill born of practice.  He held the card for Miri to see.  She said, “Bbbbb,” and then giggled at her big brother.
“I appreciate your working your magic as well.  Thank you.  Let me know what we need to do on our end.  No, working from home is entirely fine with me.  I’m not certain how long we will be staying here.
did the voices just right.  Daddy did the voices right most times.  But not always. Grammy Hudson never got the voices right at all.
No.  John refused to think about this right now, or until he reached the destination. Otherwise, he was going to drive himself into a frenzy of anxiety.  Irene was like Sherlock, and any plans he made beforehand were guaranteed to be read as soon as he was face to face.
had selected a bright orange jar of stuff to feed to them.  Siger had tried baby food when the sisters started eating it, and had not been impressed.  Even when his Daddy had pointed out that he’d eaten an awful lot of that himself.
Sherlock began, “Now, first we must decide what we are attempting to do with the disguise.  Makeup is, by its nature, always an attempt to convey some meaning.  It is a tool.  Whether it is used to attract the opposite sex,” and here Ross, Miri, and Siger wrinkled their noses and made ‘ew’ sounds, “to copy someone else, or to distract a witness’s eyes from a noticeable blemish or identifiable mark.”
John gave him a raised eyebrow.  “This was a gift from one of our neighbors, Greg.  She knit it herself.  From a proper pattern that she found. For being there when she had a medical emergency.  And now when she asks if I wore it, I can tell her I had it on when I was out for a beer with a mate.”
After that there was tea with milk and sugar in it, a small sandwich with fish paste in the middle, and one of Aunt Harriet’s Currant Rocks.  Siger was not going to complain about not understanding if he was able to have a special tea with it.  He would ask Daddy to read it again at bedtime.
Upstairs the noise of the violin was louder.  The horsehair strung bow screamed across the metal strings to make John grit his teeth.  “Hallo,” he said loudly as he dropped his cargo on the kitchen table and entered the living space, “What’s all this, then?”
looked thoughtful.  “Siger,” he turned and looked at his son, “That might be something that will take some time to get hold of.  What would you like in the meantime, while we wait for a skeleton?”
Another nod.  They returned to their examination of the ties.  Siger handled them carefully, putting several aside for further consideration.  But then he saw one from across the display table.  He made the sound, “Oh!”  and ran around to pull it from the black iron holder.
“Tell your brat to shut up.  Nosy Parker.  Who asked you to stick your toffy nose in?” came  in a shriek from the large mouth surrounded by generously applied lipstick.  She’d moved between John with his trolley, and the shoplifting boy, a  manicured hand furtively signalling to the child to get away.
The book, which was one of several scattered on the wooden floor, was procured, and three small children were perched in his narrow lap ready to hear the tale of the angel.  Not a believer himself, Sherlock had promised John that cynicism would not escape his thoughts with regard to religion.
“Excellent!  I’m going to get some sleep now.  You might want to as well.  Otherwise you’ll be very tired tomorrow, or whenever they wake us up for breakfast.” John was not looking forward to jet lag.
John laughed.  “It’s been years.  Not like I’ve kept in practice.”  He grinned over at Sherlock with a sly smile.  “Would you like to try?”
Fortunately, their nannie had a clearance level for just that reason - Father having learned an important lesson from a precocious Mycroft.  The difference between Mycroft and Sherlock – and it was an enormous difference – was that Mycroft had immediately understood the usefulness of having knowledge and not sharing it ‘round. Mycroft was not much of a talker. He was a master with words. He just loathed small talk, even at a young age.
John started to open his mouth, but Mycroft spoke first, “Of course, I am taking into account your proclivities, Sherlock.  Sean has instituted several beehives since you were last there.  And Greg has promised a variety of cold cases.  Your section of the library remains, dusted and updated.”
And now.  Kisses that were no less important, but not close to the classification of John’s kisses.  Baby bonks against his cheek from the infant Siger.  From Rosalind.  From Miranda.  Each in their turn.  An important step in their emotional development.  Those had brought a light, shivery feeling, quite unlike any other osculation.
“Why do you think I’m going? I have responsibilities here. There’s Siger, and Miranda and Ross. There’s the business. My shifts at the surgery.” Even as he spoke, John knew his partner was reading the words through whatever filter existed in the Mind Palace, adding that information to observations garnered from stance, tone of voice, twinges and muscular spasms and tics in his too often open face. John could tell when the assessment was finished.
Watts had had a hell of a time getting the beard to stick on though.  And sitting and listening to brats demand toys and treats was not his idea of a good time.  It had been hours.  His throat was starting to hurt from all the “Ho, ho, ho”ing.Thank the lord none of the little bastards had pissed on his lap.  That last group though. Baby Jesus and reindeer.  And that little girl pulling at the bloody beard.  When they’d finally cleared off he asked the Elf where Sam kept the spirit gum, as he needed a refresher.  It wouldn’t do to have his face uncovered where any cop could see it.
Climbing onto the sill he lifted the heavy wooden sash and rolled the ladder down the side of the building.  Rosalind first, then Miranda, his sisters carefully set their feet on the wooden rungs and began to climb down - just as they’d practiced.
“Why?”  Sherlock thought he had only asked it internally, but apparently had actually opened his mouth and put the question forth.
Sherlock took the thread up again.  “‘Fear not.  I bring you good news that will cause great joy for all the people.  Today in the town of David a Savior has been born to you; he is the Messiah, the Lord.  This will be a sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in cloths and lying in a manger.’”
Unfortunately, Mycroft couldn’t find any article of clothing there that matched the exact colour of his nephew’s new tie.  He admitted this with a sigh, as it was inevitable.
“Well,” Siger said considering, “They only go in the water when they are mermaids.  And then it is the carpet, not really water.”
And no, though I could do the whole tying thing, I did not pick anyone up.  We went there to dance.  And so we did.  All night long.
Sherlock Holmes watched, unseen, as his partner and spouse examined his own image in the mirror.  John ran his hand through hair that was now more grey than blond.  Holmes knew that tarnished blond head, soft and scented of the herbal shampoo that he’d gifted to his husband for their anniversary.  The tall, thin, younger man breathed into that softness at night, curled around his husband and listening to the steady regular breathing of the sleeping man.
Ross, short for Rosalind, was behind, struggling to manhandle two pails each the size of the one that Siger had carried.  John went to her rescue, though his little tomboy - who was deliberately dressed just like her big brother, though was not as willowy - refused to let him take both pails.  “You can have one, Daddy!” Ross declared, “But I’m a big girl, and I can get the other one.”
Siger was playing quietly with Miri in the sitting room, helping her to build castles with the periodical blocks, and then deconstructing them in interesting fashions.  In spite of the fiary lights, the evergreens, and the Christmas cards, the room did not look Christmas-y.  Rather it looked as though a cyclone had hit it.  Orange shock blanket on the couch, with a dented pillow on one end, showed that Sherlock had at some point lain down.  There were dishes from breakfast and lunch on the coffee table, along with Miri’s empty bottles.  It seemed easier to consolidate activity in the sitting area, rather than scattered throughout the house.
“When he was a child, Siger.   He did not stick with it,” Mycroft told him.  He felt smug at the pun, even if no one else understood it.
Well.  Scrubbing a hand through his greying hair, John Watson thought that perhaps he’d best get supper started.  He might not be able to check the children’s homework, but he could make certain that they’d get their suppers on time.  Tonight he’d ask Sherlock to explain the formulas.
“I thought he might,” Sherlock admitted.  “You’re clearly the type he favours.  Fertile, as proved by the children, shy, and not the model type.  And the distraction you and the children caused allowed me to glance through the order book behind the counter.”
There was stomping at this, and high pitched growling, and banging of items around in the kitchen.  Followed by a silence that grumbled as Siger took the garbage out.
“How do you know?” John asked, smiling pleasantly, “Perhaps I just fancy a bit of fun time with my spouse of a morning?”
“Yes!  Miss Miranda and Miss Rosalind are my little sisters, Mr. Phillips!” Siger said excitedly.  “And they got mail?”  Turning to look at Mrs. Hudson he asked, “May I help Miri and Ross open their letters?”
“I can’t believe you packed a frying pan,” John giggled as he followed his husband to their room across the hall.
He heard Sherlock speaking to Lestrade on his mobile, “Just come on in.  John has the murderer well in hand.”
And that was the problem, so far as the guidance counselor had told Siger.  Oh she’d not said it with words.  It was all the non-verbal cues.  “Thank you for your concern, Mrs. Jenkins,” Siger leaned forward disarmingly, his eyes wide and honest, “but I do have support at home, and if uni is too much for me, I’ll have options.”
Those two heads together, one with wild red curls, the other much darker, as the pair of them gabbled on about seeds and stock, about genetic variants, about loam and other varieties of earth.  Other than the difference in pitch, the pair sounded much alike.  Rosalind and Miranda were seated at their brother and father’s feet listening intently to their discussion.
This tie was a deep, dark red with curving vines of green and gold.  Small birds sat among the vine leaves.
“Oh, I was tired of being a dragon.  And Ross and Miri didn’t want to be dragons either,” Siger explained.  “Will you please read to us,
The officers conducting the review were thorough, professional, and dispassionate.  That was a facet that John appreciated.  For Greg’s sake, as well as Sherlock’s.
“Is she now?” Daddy asked and he came over, got down on his knees, and peered around the sofa with Siger.
Later, as John and Sherlock were dressing the tree, John filled in Siger’s great dinner time explanation about the setting up of the Christmas tree, about Big Tom, and Thin Ben, and their dog, Samson.  “Tom gave me a list of shelters and rescue places where Siger could help out a bit,” he finished.
Sherlock was pleased that there was no need to kiss anyone else’s children.  He was well aware of the unsanitary aspects involved in the practice.
A groan, then, “This is not your usual ‘let’s wake Sherlock up for some coital engagement’.  This is your ‘I’ve got you, Holmes, and you can’t get away until we discuss this taboo subject’.  It’s obvious, John.”
Mycroft’s and Greg’s bed was king-sized, clean cotton sheets (“guaranteed to be ice cold, Mrs. Hudson, Anna will have to get you a hot water bottle”), and covered with a goose down comforter.
Leaning over the ziptied doctor to look into his eyes, the detective sergeant asked “Excuse me, sir.  Are you waiting for anyone here?”
John had gotten a bee in his bonnet.  Sherlock knew that look of obstinate determination.  As if they did not have any number of adequate science and picture books available for Siger, Miranda and Rosalind.
Moments later Sherlock Holmes was retrieved from the flickering, fluorescent lit cellar of a crime scene scenario by a shrill shriek of rage after Ross brought her trainer clad food deliberately down onto Siger’s building like a monster from an old film.  Miri threw herself into the fray as well, collapsing the avenue of books on to the pirates.
In the wait before takeoff, John took the time to examine his fellow travelers.  Woman in front of him, traveling with her small dog.  Her complaints and whinging to the flight attendant was yappier than the puppy.  John felt a measure of sympathy for the ball of fluff, quietly frightened as his carrier was wedged into the seat by the window. At least it wasn’t stowed in the hold.  John had read about animal deaths in the unheated, unpressurized depths of air transport.
Hm.  Perhaps now was a time to take a break from casework.  Unless Lestrade or a client could come up with a nine.  Sherlock could give John time to work on his approach to literacy, and finish off some experiments he’d been meaning to tend to.
In the darkness of the upstairs room, “Silent night, Holy night,” Siger was singing softly to his baby sister, “all is calm, all is bright.”
John gritted his teeth, then regretted that. More than a bit not good to make a small boy feel unhappy just because John was not a maths wizard.  Taking another deep breath, John relaxed. He smiled, and told his son, “I’m afraid you’ll have to, Sweet.  What are these formulas for?”
Not to mention John actually spent time with his children.  Siger was at the end of his cold, and sniffled as he built a three-dimensional paper sculpture that was beginning to look like a dragon.  Miri was asleep on the floor next to her brother, wrapped in Auntie Harriet’s afghan, her fingers curled up near her small red mouth.
Siger told them, “I think Daddy is sad.  He hasn’t mentioned Christmas since we put the fairy lights up.”
“What do we have here?” came from a husky constable that John could just see beyond the light from the torch.
Siger climbed down and looked through the slatted walls of the crib into Will’s bright eyes.  Will lifted his little arms to be picked up, and Siger complied without thought, dragging Will over the edge of the wooden crib.  The warm, flannel-clad baby was heavy in his arms.  Siger did not think he could hold Will and climb down the ladder.  Will smacked baby lips at his cousin.  “That is not helpful, Will,” Siger told him.
"Actually I thought you would be older, you saved a lot of POWs. Many of those men wouldn't have survived much longer in that POW camp. The American's are trying to get you down for a medal." The Major relaxed slightly.
"Now your choice, you take my case and I can answer all your questions or you spend the rest of the case in a bunker in the middle of nowhere." She knew I had to know the truth.
I automatically answered my phone as I was reading through all the comments on the blog. "John!" Harry called down the phone excitedly. "Hi Harry..." I replied before she interrupted "is it true!" I could hear in her voice she was almost busting. I huffed. "Is what true?" I looked up to see Sherlock stroll past me nakedly, I shook my head and ignored him. "Are you and Sherlock a thing?" Her voice experated. "Yeah Harry it's true." I answered. "OMG! I knew it!" She breathed down the phone. "Wait, what are you to tell dad? He hit the roof when he found out I was a lesbian, he is going to." Her voice stopped. "I know Harry, he is going to go crazy." An awkward silence developed. "You don't have to come to my birthday party." Harry suddenly spoke. "Wait of course I'm coming, it's at the park, in public. He isn't going to do anything in public." She was silent again. "Harry he might not even know yet, it will be fine. I'll see you tomorrow ok." After a couple of seconds "ok John, be careful. Bye." "Bye Harry." I replied. I was nervous, I'm not going to lie. I kept reassuring myself he probably doesn't know. I grabbed Harry's wrapped present off the table and called out to Sherlock. He came out of his room completely dressed and grabbed his coat. "Let's go." He replied. "Your coming with me?" I looked at him confused. "I'm not letting you go face your father by yourself." Sherlock looked at me like it was final. "You sure?" I asked my voice shook. "I'm sure." Sherlock gave me a quick hug before pulling me out of the unit. It started fine, my father glared at me and Sherlock. "He knows." Sherlock whispered in my ear which only made my father fume and skull his beer. My father said nothing the whole time. "I'm going to the bathroom" I whispered to Sherlock before I snuck out of the crowd. I was washing my hands intentionally taking forever when I heard a beer bottle smash. I looked up to see my father in the doorway. "How dare you bring that fag to our family event!" He grit his teeth at me slamming me into the wall. "Dad, he is my flat mate and my best friend." I tried to reason with him even though all I could smell was his alcoholic breath. I felt like I was in grade six again. "I know what's going on John, I saw the news!" He punched me in the face. "How could you, you little homo!" He yelled at me again grabbing my shirt. "Your an embarrassment to this family, you didn't even have the guts to fight for your country like a man!" He punched me again with his spare hand. "It was probably one of ours that shot you, trying to get rid of you, you disgusting thing!" He shouted punching me again as I tried to shield my face and throwing me to the floor. "You are not longer part of this family, I don't want to see you or your little poofter again!" He shouted kicking me in the stomach. "I wanted a man as a son, not a little fag like you!" He yelled, I curled into a ball to protect my face and torso and he kicked me in the shins. I heard another skin hit skin punch then a smashing of skin on the sink. "John." I heard Sherlock's voice. I quickly opened my eyes to see Sherlock's hand out to me, I took his hand and he wrapped me up in his arms. I could see my father in a heap on the floor. "What, what happened?" I tried to calm my breathing but I couldn't stop crying. "I waited until he was unbalanced and punched him which caused him to fall face first into the sink and he knocked himself out." Sherlock explained. "OMG, how does he manage to make me feel like a child." I buried my face into Sherlock's shirt, embarrassed but he just held me closer. "John, we have to get him out of here." Sherlock spoke gently after I had regained myself. "Your right, we have to get back to the party." I used the paper towel to get the blood off my face and try and hide my blood shot eyes. Sherlock grabbed one of his arms as I grabbed the other and we dragged him out and towards the party. "Oh my god! John what happened?" My mother was the first to spot us. I wasn't sure what to say. "He slipped and fell hitting his head on the sink." Sherlock lied quickly. Harry looked at me and knew instantly what had happened. We put him on the ground and rolled him on his side as Harry's girlfriend called the ambulance. I excused us as soon as I could once the ambulance arrived saying we had a case we had to get back too. Harry whispered in my ear as she hugged me goodbye, "Don't be a stranger, you will always be my brother." Sherlock and I headed off quickly, grabbing a cab home in silence. Once in the flat door I put my coat on the hook and lent my forehead on the wall. "John." Sherlock put his hand on my shoulder. "I'm ok Sherlock, nothing's broken." I took a deep breath. "He disowned me, big surprise." I explained not wanting to look at Sherlock and not taking my forehead off the wall. He just wrapped his arms around me. "It's ok John." He whispered in my hair.
"Better add these to the collection then." John replied pulling the offers out of his white coat. James and John shared a nod as John left his office.
"Thank you doctor." The Omega gave a weak smile as Watson left the room, even as he sat on his bunk that night something about the Omega got stuck in his head. Deciding he would visit her again tomorrow he was finally able to sleep.
I woke feeling content, I hadn't actually had a nightmare or flashbacks. I actually slept soundly! It took me a couple of minutes to notice a long arm around my waist snaked under my shirt. Um, who's arm and why am I still in my clothes and not my night clothes. I opened my eyes, holy shit I'm in Sherlock's room, in his bed and that is his arm. The night before came back to me. I carefully rolled over on to my side remembering his ribs were broken. He looked so peaceful in his sleep as he pulled me closer snuggling his nose into the side of my neck. As much as I wanted to touch him I was also relieved he was sleeping that I didn't want to wake him. I'm pretty sure it had been a solid week since he had slept properly and then getting beaten up I wasn't 100% sure what had happened to him yesterday. I felt so angry that someone would beat him up like that and why! We had to go and see Lestrade, make a formal report. Sherlock would know enough about them to make them easy to find, they choose the wrong person to pick on! "John, we can't go to Lestrade." Sherlock suddenly replied. Shit, I wonder how much I had said out loud. "Why." I asked gently. "We would have to tell him about us." Sherlock answered simply. "Sherlock, did they beat you up because you bought those flowers for me?" I asked horrified. He just nodded. "It's got to stop Sherlock, beating people up and murdering just because they are gay. It's wrong." Suddenly Sherlock's phone rang from his coat in the lounge room, I untangled myself from Sherlock and just got to it before it stopped. It was Lestrade, another case. This time I helped Sherlock get dressed and we headed down to the address Lestrade had given me. Another dead woman, she kinda reminded me of Harry. "Deceased is Shay Green" Lestrade explained before taking me aside. "John, what the hell happened to him?" Lestrade whispered. "He got beaten up last night." I answered still watching him, trying not to get angry. "Has he reported it?" Lestrade asked. "No, I was trying to convince him to come and see you this morning." I answered "He doesn't want to report it? Did he say something to start the fight?" Lestrade asked. "Yes but not what you think." I answered as Sherlock started to head our way. "I have to talk to the husband." Sherlock announced looking at me strangely. "Sure." Lestrade was been uncharacteristic nice to Sherlock. The husband was upstairs placing the bedroom trying to stay calm when we came in. He was a huge bloke, I was actually feeling afraid he might hit Sherlock if he said the wrong thing. "She was cheating on you." Sherlock announced. Oh shit I thought. "Who the fuck are you?" The guy yelled at him. "I'm Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective." Sherlock replied calmly. The guy started to fidget. "But then so are you." Sherlock added. "I don't know what your talking about." The guy replied looking away. "You have whisker burns on your face, not from your late wife as she has an extremely smooth face. The bruises on your arms are from heavy love making again not your wife's as her hands are small and petite. The hand bruises from your arms are stronger, larger. A labourer, someone who uses their hands a lot." The guy didn't reply, Sherlock changed tactic, this was going to end badly. "Your wife has lipstick smudges on her neck, someone with a small mouth has been biting her lip and it's not her teeth imprints on her lower lip. The faded scars on her arms show someone with long nails, so not you, has been scratching her, again during love making over a period of time so she has been cheating on you for a while with another woman. I'd say someone a little shorter then her as the mark's are concentrated around her neck and lower face and chest. The access area for a lover shorter then you which obviously wasn't you as your taller then her. So did you kill her so you could go to your new love or is it because she was cheating on you?" The guy started to pace again "Stop, just stop!" He shouted at Sherlock. "Tell me the truth and I'll stop." Sherlock lazily offered. "The truth, you want the truth!" He yelled at Sherlock now staring at him. "Shay was my best friend but I didn't love her, I'm gay. She's gay." He turned back around and grabbed the bench for support. "We became friends at school, she was caught with another girl and her parents lost it. Her father beat the shit out of her, I was her best friend so we pretended to become a couple. Only after school, well it became convenient. We were able to date without our families finding out we were gay. Then my parents started to become suspicious so Shay suggested we get married. Her girlfriend Liz was fine with it. I don't want to know what they got up too, I just wanted Shay to be happy." The guy took a deep breath to try and calm himself. He turned to face us again as tears started to develop in his eyes. "Shay was so excited to be meeting Damien, my new boyfriend. Damien was excited to be meeting her, he thought the whole idea was perfect. Me been married meant no one would think he was gay and we could hang out without his workmates getting suspicious." A scream from downstairs pierced the air. "Sean!" a woman screamed. "Shit, it's Liz!" The guy pushed past Sherlock to the door, we followed. "Let me in this door now!" A short woman with fiery red hair and just as fiery red lips was on the brink of tears yelling at the officer at the door. "Please let her in." The guy begged, the officer stepped aside as the woman ran to the guy. He steered her into a empty room. "Sean what the hell is going on?" She desperately looked at him. "Liz, it's Shay. She's dead." The woman put her hand to her mouth "No, Sean, no!" She collapsed to the floor bursting into tears. The man, Sean, hugged her as she completely broke down. I felt awkward watching so I pulled Sherlock out of the room. "Sherlock, what do you think?" I asked quietly. "What." Sherlock hadn't been paying attention. "What do you think?" I asked my voice still shaking. "She didn't know her attacker and she fought him off, she didn't have much of a chance however. Her attacker is strong but not as huge as the husband. He doesn't have the physical power behind him." Sherlock wasn't talking with his normal confidence. "Do you think it was the boyfriend, Damien?" I asked nervously. "No, the bruises on the husband are younger hands then those on the wife." Sherlock answered. Lestrade reappeared, "How did you go?" He asked, "the husband's, friend, Damien. Find out where he works and talk to his work mates. An older guy, about the victims height but extremely strong." Sherlock explained to Lestrade in a flat voice. "Let's go John." Sherlock suddenly grabbed my arm and lead me out of the house and into a cab. The trip was silent as Sherlock looked out the window, I put my hand on the seat between us as I watched him. He slowly put his hand on top of mine curling his long fingers between mine.
John Watson was not, of course, the type of man who dictated a woman’s hair style.  There was no “a woman’s treasure” nonsense about John.  Sherlock knew that the concern was more toward Rosalind’s hands, or Miri’s, on sharp edges.  Well, that and whether or not Rosalind would be teased at school the next day.  Not that it would have mattered to Ross if the other children did tease her over the cropped head.  Ross carried those types of inconveniences off proudly.  In some way that Sherlock could never fathom, no one bullied Rosalind.
John straightened his back, listening to it creak.  “Will you please photograph their experiment, and then we’ll see to clearing it up.”
When Sherlock Holmes walked in the door to the sitting room, he was met by a cozy scene.  His spouse and their two daughters playing on the floor, and his son seated at the coffee table concentrating furiously on his task.  Sherlock dispensed kisses all round, then sat down on the carpet next to Siger.  “What are you working on, Siger?” he asked after kissing the top of the curly haired head.
“What my colleague means,” inserted the stocky blond with the air of command (his name tag read:  J. Watson, Circulation Manager) as he leaned against the mahogany standing desk, “Is that we can offer no legal comment, suggestion, or advice whatsoever.”
John Watson finished reviewing the paperwork Alice Brown had handed him.  “All good, Alice?” he twinkled his blue eyes at the office manager from force of habit.
Yes, wishfic.  But you can not tell me Mycroft would not take care of Greg's family.  Especially the ones with his brother's blood in them.
“When doing stage makeup, or changing your appearance, the beginning layer on your canvas is the base.”  Pulling several jars from the box he compared the color through the glass with John’s skin.  “Daddy is fair complexioned.  I’m going to make his complexion even fairer.  We could change that completely with makeup, but it’s difficult to do it well enough to fool everyone.  And it can also be considered offensive to take on a skin tone that is not your own.  A white man masquerading as an African could be offensive to people of colour.  A woman with very dark skin in makeup that makes her look fair is also problematic.  You realize,” he turned to give them a tutorial eye, “that my gendered examples are random.”
“Yes, sweet, but what else would you like for Christmas dinner?” John Watson was at his doctorly best, with, “We can’t just eat cake for dinner, Siger.”
Oh.  Well played, Dr. John Watson!  “Siger,” Sherlock croaked, acknowledging the small boy paused in the doorway.
They stopped halfway down the hallway to the room that Siger, Miri, and Ross used when staying with their uncles. Sherlock looked back.  Mrs. Hudson stood, lonely and lost by the front door.  “Well, Mrs. Hudson, come along,” he told her briskly.
When Siger woke up it was twilight.  He could hear people in the kitchen, and so climbed down from the couch to pad over and peek in through the doorway.  Daddy was trying to feed both Miri and Ross at the same time.  Ross was in a spitty mood, and had green babyfood covering her face, the tray, her hair, and parts of Miri and Daddy.
John rose for the hymn, sat, knelt, all without paying attention to the service.  He was usually dutiful about focusing, as much for himself as it was to provide a good example for the children.  As the girls and Siger exited their pew, John began catching up crayons, mittens, hats, and other items the children had left behind in their race for the gathering area. John realized that the service was over, and he’d not heard a bit of the sermon.  Perhaps they should go for a walk on the way home, and do some window shopping.  He could get a feel on what the children would like to do to celebrate the holiday this year.
Mycroft was unavailable, and so Sherlock had talked Bert Tran into skiving off when he should have been studying.  And now Sherlock, Bert, Miranda, and Rosalind were heading for the zoo as soon as the rats were taken care of.
Upstairs in the nursery, while he was choosing clothing for the girls for the day (Siger generally chose his own), he slipped
“Bbbbbbbb!” Miranda told them, as she clumsily sat back on her rump and lifted arms to be picked up.
Ross grabbed for the pieces of paper, but when Siger held the card in front of her face, saying, “Look Ross, at the pretty card,” she caught it and stuffed it into her mouth.  “No, Ross,” Siger told her, pulling the drool soaked paper from her mouth and hand, “The cards go up on the book shelf!”
“You know,” Sherlock told his boy, as he hugged back, “Before your father, there was only The Work.  Before you.  And Ross.  And Miranda.”
Listening to his nephew’s violin lesson in the Library, Mycroft Holmes observed that the chandelier in the front hall had been denuded of the majority of the lead crystal pendants. It was not a good look for the light fixture. Passing through the doorway into the front room he discovered Will and Daniel upon the ladder – well, that explained how they’d pilfered from the chandelier. The drapes were thrown wide open, and the boys were hanging a string of faceted crystals in a drooping line across the wide front windows.
Sourly, Mrs. Jenkins admitted with what was almost a caricature of grudging, “They support you in your decision.”
“I’m thirteen, Mrs. Jenkins,” Siger tried the cheerful tone that his Dad used with patients, “And due to start uni in the fall term.  I’m not interested in waiting.”
This was not Mycroft Holmes’s forte. “I had no idea there were mummy dinosaurs,” he murmured to her.
Sherlock Holmes was bitterly angry.  “How stupid do these goldfish have to be?” he exclaimed in frustration.
Siger smiled.  He looked tiny next to the delivery men, with his wild red curls and footie pajamas.  Plush violin tucked under his arm, he asked, “What is his name?”
“Are you saying that two men shopping with a toddler for a Christmas dress will presuppose homosexuality, and therefore change the quality of service?”
"Sorry about that, trust me after what Sherlock put in the microwave yesterday you want a new one. Give it 20 minutes before you turn anything back on." The woman relaxed and let an natural Australian drawl enter her voice.
It was my day off thankfully so I pulled out my laptop to work on the blog. I had heard Sherlock head out "back soon" he smiled at me almost shyly. "Ok." I smiled back still kinda stunned about what had happened this morning. I worked pretty solidly that I forgot to eat lunch and it wasn't until my stomach groaned that I realised and looked at the time. Shit I thought as I noticed the sun sinking out the window. Wait Sherlock's not home yet either. I pulled out my phone trying not to panic, I mean he wouldn't leave after this morning would he. He wouldn't have gone looking for drugs. Omg what have I done. I started to panic more and more as my hand shook I texted him.
"No, she was my patient and I have a duty to my patients James, you know that. Probably a good thing they got her out of here, the conversations in post op she'd be bonded before I could discharge her." John laughed softly shaking his head.
"Let me guess, Major Franks." James answered looking up at John. John nodded sharply. "She was evacced out this morning by helicopter, some special forces crap. I was assured she would be cared for by specialist Omega doctors." John nodded and turned to leave. "John, is there something I need to know, your interest in the Omega?" James asked carefully.
"Hey, this is a war zone, people die. What possessed you to use nurses in a recovering mission is beyond me but you saved a lot of lives." Watson felt his Alpha side wanting to sooth the agitated Omega.
"John" Sherlock asked as I put the tea on. "Yeah Sherlock" I replied from the kitchen. "What would your family say about 'us'" Sherlock asked. "I thought you would know." I answered leaning on the door way watching him sitting on the couch thinking. "Your father would get violent, depending on the amount of alcohol in his system. He would either aim for your head or your torso. Your mother and your sister would be happy for us yet your mother would be banned from talking to you as your father would disown you after beating you. He can tolerate your sister been Lesbian, just, but his only son been gay.  No." Sherlock was right but he wasn't pleased. "What makes you think I would even consider telling my father, as long as I'm here with you I dont need to have anything to do with him." I pointed out. Sherlock nodded. "But you will tell your mother and your sister so he will find out eventually." Sherlock replied. That I couldn't deny. "What about your parents and Mycroft, what would they think?" I asked. "Mycroft already knows, he reminded me that emotional attachedments are distractions. Mother would also remind me emotional attachedments are dangerous. Father, well he would be, judgemental." Neither of the Holmes brothers spoke much of thier parents, other then been basically nonexistent in thier lives and that Mycroft took after his father I know nothing of them. The kettle was boiled so I made us both a tea and joined Sherlock on the couch. He was thinking deeply again. "Would you marry some random woman?" He suddenly asked. "No." I definely answered. Sherlock watched my reaction to his question but he was satisfied so I turned on the TV.
"Yes, they figured Mycroft would get you involved, petty bastard. Anyway I convinced him you should have a choice now that your already involved. Tell me, what's my sub gender?" A entertained smile on her face.
It was school holidays, I had a day shift at the clinic and unwisely left Molly with Sherlock for the day. Sherlock had been drug free since her birth, it wasn't an easy road but we made it. I grabbed some milk and bread on the way home but amazingly when I opened the door to Bakers St Molly was happily playing the violin with her father. It made my heart swell watching the two of them play together. Molly had Sherlock's musician talent, black curls and his unshakeable eyes yet she had my nose and my open compassion for people. It didn't stop her from imitating her father however especially when she was on cases with us. She flashed me one of her signature smiles as she kept playing. I headed to the kitchen to put the milk away but as I opened the door the shock made me drop it and it smashed at my feet. "Sherlock!" I practically screamed. I turned to find both Sherlock and Molly staring at me so I quickly slammed the fridge door shut. "Go back to your playing Molly." I got her out of the kitchen grabbing Sherlock and pulling him further into the kitchen. "Sherlock there is a vagina in the fridge. Why is there a vagina in the fridge?" I asked trying to keep my voice down. "Don't worry it's not for you." Sherlock answered casually. "It's for Molly." I stared at him. "Sherlock you can't buy a vagina for an eight year old!" I replied frustrated "She wanted to know why we have a penis and she doesn't. So I got her a vagina to look at. She also wanted to know where babies come from so when it thaws I was going to show her." Sherlock answered like it was obvious. I pinched the top of my nose. "You got Molly a real cadavers vagina so you could explain the birds and the bees to her." I tried to clarify in my mind. "Yes." Sherlock answered unsure of what the problem was. "Are you going to add the bit where you made her from our sperm and a donated egg without telling me so you could surprise me on our honeymoon?" Sherlock looked at me with his unshakeable eyes "Ok, ok, get me the mop." I gave up, I used the time it took to clean the milk up to work out a plan, as I put the mop away I called out to Molly. "Yeah papa." She bounced into the lounge room. "Come sit on my lap we need to talk." I sat on the couch as she jumped on my knee. "Ok, Molly, so you know how we can't talk about cases until they have cleared court." I explained. "Yes, because a breach of confidentiality can effect the judgement of a court and the perpetrator can use Pre-Trial Publicity as a reason to have the case thrown out of court or move venue." Molly looked at me curious to the next amount of information I was about to give her. "Um, yes, well, the cadaver that your daddy got you needs to stay confidential too." I explained. "But daddy said anatomy was important to learn and we should at least try and educate the idiots at my school." I glared at Sherlock who was standing in the door way proud as punch. "Molly, sweety, most people don't see cadavers until they are in medical school and I know no one at your school has been to medical school. They wouldn't understand if you try and tell them about this." Molly looked at me just like her father does storing the information in to her mind palace. "But who is going to teach them?" She asked. "It's up to their parents to teach them about anatomy." I explained. "But Frankie doesn't have parents." Molly was suddenly worried about her friend. "I'm sure someone from the Department will tell Frankie." I reassured her remembering her friend was a ward of the state. "Ok." She smiled brightly happy with my explanation. "How about you go play now." I suggested. Molly smiled at me and run off to her room to play. I let out a long sigh and put my face in my hands closing my eyes. I swear Sherlock will be the death of me I thought. Two long slender hands slid down my shoulders followed by a familiar face rubbing up against my cheek and Sherlock's curls bounced in my face. He started to kiss my neck and rub my shoulders and chest. It eased the stress out of my body. "Your still in trouble." I murmured, Sherlock pulled away and I missed his touch instantly, opening my eyes he knelt between my knees on the floor. Omg his eyes, I just couldn't pull myself away from them. He started to kiss me and rub his hand against me threw my trousers, I buried my hands in his curls. "Bedroom now." I demanded and I swear I saw a cheeky grin flash across his face. It wasn't long before I was biting his shoulder so I didn't cry out in pleasure as he climaxed in me and I climax over his hand. Sherlock grabbed the baby wipes beside the bed to clean us both up, I was exhausted but happy spread out naked on the bed. Once clean Sherlock knelt over me on his hands and knees smiling at me. "Your still in trouble." I tried to keep my face looking serious. Then Sherlock had that look on his face only one person can produce. "Daddies, Uncle Mycroft and Uncle Greg are here." Molly called from her room. "Don't ask him about his diet!" I called back as we quickly got up and threw clothes on. We opened the bedroom door in time for Molly to ask Mycroft "How's your diet Uncle Mycroft?" I quickly grabbed Molly's hand. "Let's go make some tea." I pulled her out of the lounge room as Sherlock took up his arm chair I heard him ask Mycroft if he wanted some cake.
finished his memory work before responding to his spouse.  “Of course I am.  And Siger comes up with these himself.  It’s all part of Siger’s development, John.”
After digging up the third dead cat, John decided that it would be better to institute a different type of urban garden.  “Pots,” he said to the three children, “We’re going to need large pots.”  John Watson didn’t think that he could manage disinterring what was apparently a graveyard for local pets.
did not care about his clothing. “The stains will come out, John, or they won’t,” had been his response the last time Siger had gotten grass and mud stains on his knees.  Siger tried hard to remember those words, so that he could use them the next time he got busy in the dirt. He liked to have a response ready for Daddy.
The door remained black, the brass knocker just a hint off-kilter. No notice in sight told of the presence of the Holmes-Watson Agency. There was noise next door from Mrs. Turner’s, where she was having the upstairs flat re-plastered.
Siger’s Daddy, who had offered tea, brought in mugs for the men.  “There you go Tom, Ben.  That tree looks lovely,” John Watson told them.  “The greens did well too,” the doctor indicated the decorations on the mantel and out the doorway to the stairwell.
Daddy read the card, “Dear Siger, and Rosalind, and Miranda.  This is an Avon First Nativity set, which is good for babies as well as big brothers.  It is made to be played with,and can go in the tub, as well as be played with on the rug.  Merry Christmas, Mary Watson and Jack Watson and Mary Morstan.”
“It’s a tradition, Sherlock, not an experiment,” John said as he set up the ladder, making certain that the legs were locked.  He turned to look at his son, who was wearing a Christmas jumper that Sherlock had bought.  It was, therefore, lovely, highlighted Siger’s hair and colouring, and cost more than the entire outfit that John had worn to work today.  Siger’s trousers matched Sherlock’s black tailored set, though John knew well that he would never see Sherlock Holmes in a Christmas jumper.  Instead, the taller man was wearing a burgundy button down that looked incredibly handsome on his spouse.
Sherlock, true to his self-description from so long ago, said nothing. He did, however, continue to observe his spouse.
Sherlock gave a chuff for a comment, then began to read.  “You’ve known this for six months?” he growled, “Two labs.  Two of them! Not just the Initiative?”
“Christopher Cox,” Sherlock pronounced. “One of Moran’s men.  You’re supposed to be dead,” he told the bound thug.
and without.  But Miranda seemed to always be the one left behind.  Even Will and Joy and Em and Danny had been to Forensics camp.  Not the Miranda was interested in police work.  It’s just that one does not like to be left out of the family business.
Jim Moriarty had shown his respect in bringing Cuddles out of the gangs and into position as a weapon for Sebastian Moran.  “You’re a big boy, Cuddles,” Jim Moriarty had said on more than one occasion, “and just the implement I need.”
, or Old Befana, told about Christmas in foreign lands that celebrated differently from Siger’s home in London.  He also read in French, which Daddy did not.
They listened to Siger explain about honey badgers from a nature program he’d been watching.  Then Siger fetched an extensive crayon drawing, which he told
Seated;in a cane bottomed rocking chair, a sniffling Ross, leaned over a nappy covered shoulder, Harry smiled at her brother.  “Not one for brandy sauce right now anyway.  Life is good, eh?”  She rubbed circles on the little girl’s back.
Sherlock made a noncommittal noise and swooped past John downstairs into the office kitchen to examine his petri dishes filled, hopefully, with mold.
The young woman shouted in pain.  Sound echoed in the small room, twilight lit.  Dark, straight hair was pulled back from her sweating face, and she bared her teeth as the next contraction took hold.  Manicured fingers clenched tight around the hands of the two men on either side, nails biting into the soft flesh over solid bone.
Sherlock, true to his self-description from so long ago, said nothing. He did, however, continue to observe his spouse.
put the pajamas on under protest, and then sat in bed with the covers pulled tight around him.  Daddy stuck a thermometer in
“I like,” Siger announced, “the part where Jim is hiding in the apple barrel.  And Ben Gunn.  Daddy always has to eat cheese after reading it.”
There was paper on the table, and a pencil, and a list in Daddy’s writing.  “What are you making, Daddy?” Siger asked.
Wide green eyes stared at him from under the red mop of hair.  “Would you teach me all of them, please?”
Ross’s lovely long eyelashes were heavily clotted with black mascara.  Metallic pink eye-shadow had been applied with a heavy hand as well, and eye liner had been used to create an egyptian look to the top of the eyelid.  Round dark pink pockets of rouge had been hastily rubbed in over what John recalled an ex-girlfriend calling “the apple” of her cheek.  Though part of the redness there might be due to temper.  Ross was markedly angry.  The sweet, naturally pink lips were tight together, having been outlined in red, and filled in with something apparently called “fire engine”.  Glancing down he observed that the short nails that Sherlock carefully cut and shaped for them weekly were covered with black, crackly nail varnish that looked appallingly lava like.
Dr. John Watson cursed and rocketed forward.  He slammed the door open, catching the long barrel of the rifle against the wall.  Leading with his left fist he knocked a stout figure in red trimmed with fake ermine backward down the stairs.  By the time the murderer tried to rise, John had his hands zip tied behind his back.
My apologies.  I started a chapter, and it became quite long and involved.  And so it will be posted as a separate story altogether.
She gave a decided nod.  The conversation having ended, she went back to her iPad, and left John to his sleep.
The sergeant, who was speaking intently into his mobile said, “Suspect was loitering in the dark on Corn Street.  He’s got a box of hands.  No, sir.  No.  Human hands.  Human hands.  Well most of them, I think.”
John Watson slept deeply, soundly, and came to awareness with the slow comfortable knowledge that Sherlock Holmes was wrapped tightly around him, snoring softly onto the top of his head.  John could hear the children through the monitor, Siger was telling someone a story - they were probably playing with the enormous wooden pirate ship that had once belonged to Sherlock.  Miri chimed in from time to time, while Ross’s distinctive and rarely heard voice created the sound effects.  Will’s soft infant burbling, along with “Will, don’t eat the cannon!” from Miri added the last piece to finish the puzzle of contentment.  Anna would have already given them breakfast.  It was all good.  Well, not all.
John kicked off his shoes, and stretched out on the couch.  “This is nice,” he said, reaching for the glass of what he suspected would be from the bottle of excellent scotch that Mycroft had given them ages ago.  Yes, upon sipping it, John thought it really wonderful scotch.
After dinner, nothing was said. Sherlock continued to read to Siger. Ross was lolling on her stomach on Harry’s much used afghan.
“Quiet, John,” and his partner showed them how to carefully apply the makeup and blend it into the hairline.  “You need to make sure that it covers evenly, and doesn’t look caked on.  Caked base can crack, and ruin the illusion.  See, here?  It’s not covering as well as the other areas, so we put a dab more, and blend it in.  There are blending sticks you can use, but I’m just going to use my hands on your Dad.  Quiet, John.”
Sherlock shot a sideways glance from his pose on the couch.  “How did you get up the stairs without making any noise?” he demanded.
“I would like to play the violin,” said Siger evenly in the tone he used when an adult was being what Pere called “an idiot”.
Siger appeared, clambering up onto the bed and into John’s lap.  John looked into the uplifted, snub-nosed face.  “Perhaps,” Sherlock said, “It would be best to discuss this later this afternoon or evening.”
John grimaced, and Siger didn’t think it was the bleach.  “Mrs. Jenkins should mind her own bloody business,” John said with determination as he attacked a discoloration in the white enamel, “if she can’t listen to what you’ve told her over and over again.”
Daddy laughed, but must have felt Siger stiffening, because he stopped.  “Sweet, we’ve all been sick.  Except for your
” Siger turned to claw at the air toward the consulting detective, and roared again.  This ended with a cough as well.
Siger, Miri, and Ross surrounded Anna, rather like a bright elderly flower surrounded by busy chattering butterflies.  It was the middle of the night - how had she gotten dressed and put in order so quickly?  John was struck by a whirling sense of unreality.
His parents were downstairs. Bedclothes swooshed, but quietly, as he lifted them back.  Sliding his feet into soft slippers, Siger ignored his bathrobe, he was warm enough in his flannel pjs.  He practiced walking as
Perched on a stool, Sherlock Holmes was examining paint samples in the microscope in his lab when his mobile rang.  “John!” he called, before realizing that his husband was late getting home from his half day at the surgery.  The call was, therefore, probably John calling to ask Sherlock to pick up milk or beans some nonsense like that.  He ignored the call.
, but "Ross and Miri are too young," he told the two adults. Bert chose two to take down to his room for later that night.  He had a study date.  The thought that those biscuits would be waiting for him afterward was a pleasant thought.
