Look at you. You're hopeless now. SH
Sherlock looked away, ashamed. "I'm sorry." he mumbled. He felt horrible. Dreadful. "I thought... John, my drug abuse had nothing to do with you. I wanted an Omega, still do, but I grew up with always being told, that my Omega would hate me, that they wouldn't want me. I'm so sorry..." the last words were barely a whisper. "I understand, if you don't want me, of course. It's understandable. I'm sorry it had to be me, that you had the misfortune to be paired with."
I'm almost finished, though. SH
Sherlock nodded eagerly. "Tea, breakfast, whatever you want." he assured him, unable to hold back a small grin. "Christ, I love you." he felt guilt, and love, mostly love, but a hell lot of guilt as well. "God, you're gorgeous." he mumbled, placing his free hand on the man's chest. "I think you're absolutely beautiful."
I asked because it had bothered me that I hadn't been able to figure it out. JW
You just did. SH
I'm drunk. I'm allowed to be odd. JW
Just this once, you're correct. SH
I just wanted to let you know, that chapter two is a work in progress. I'm currently at 1928 words, and I'm expecting to make about 3000. I'll keep this updated, and future chapters will be added more frequently :) Promise.
If the smell is still present, light a match. Just don't touch the second bottom drawer in the fridge. SH
I know you've denied it before, but... SH
Everything can't always be by your rules Sherlock! JW
Mmm? JW
Don't touch it. SH
Your words wound me, John. SH
Exactly. SH
I would say that I 'revere' you in a fairly good amount. Considering how much of a self-centered arse you can be. I respect you, that's for sure. JW
Oh I know. I occasionally like to balance things on you when you fall asleep on the sofa. SH
"Um..." John felt the beginnings of a headache coming on. "I love the violin. Always have, for some reason..." He trailed off a bit. An awkward second ticked by. John cleared his throat. "That's really the sort of question you...I mean, that's a question for your Omega." John's chest hurt. His head hurt and his chest hurt and he was probably going to kill himself the minute he got home to his miserable little flat share. Mike took pity on him and put a hand on his shoulder. "Sherlock, think before you speak, yeah? Johnny's had a rough go. C'mon, have dinner with me and the family. It'll be good for you to have home-cooked meals." John shook his head. The last thing he needed to see was the happy family he'd never have.
I'm just curious. JW
Not really. JW
Thanks. For not being weird or stupid and for liking my compliments and for caring. It means a lot, regardless of what I say about social constructs. SH
If you want me to. JW
The answer is no. I'm not gay. JW
There wouldn't be much for you to do. I'm just running a lot of blood samples. SH
I much rather prefer heroin. SH
I don't see why it's such a big deal, though. SH
Can I ask you a question? JW
Will you be there? SH
I wouldn't dream. SH
It's very amusing. I once got 2.5 loafs of bread on your head, you're so stil. SH
Those were just idiots. Of course I won't leave you Sherly. JW
John felt confused. "About...fourteen years ago? I...joined the Army and started suppressants and...but you can't be my Alpha. You'd have come for me that first heat. Right? Or the second? I mean, sometimes it takes a while but not..." He did some mental math. He presented at seventeen and joined the Army at twenty-six. Around nine or ten years' worth of heats, waiting. That was enough time for any Alpha to find him. Right?
I'm asking you then. If it were a pie chart, how large would the arsehole section be? SH
Mmm. Social constructs are so tedious. SH
'Feels so special'. Are you writing valentine day cards now? You're always so sappy. SH
You're a man of habits, John. It would take a great shift in will power. SH
I would say so. Most of the time at least. JW
Just telling you not to expect it. JW
Skin!? I don't know whether to laugh or cry anymore. JW
Have you never been drunk before? JW
I'm testing the speed of skin decomposition in heat vs cold. SH
What even is that case you're working on? JW
"No, you aren't. You couldn't." John looked a little amused. "I was in the army. When I'm not in heat I'm more than capable of defending myself, even from Alphas." He shook his head. "I'm not mad. You lost your Omega too. It makes sense, sort of, that if we were going to do...anything with /anyone/ it would be each other. But I just can't. I'm sorry." He gripped the handle of his cane. "My scent isn't very strong yet. Army suppressants. It'll wear off soon. That's probably what's tripping you up." And probably what was making John unable to properly scent Sherlock.
And here is another reason I retain from alcohol. SH
Are you gay? At least in a little bit? SH
Mmmmm... fine. JW
John's eyes snapped open. "Don't want you? Are you not listening to me?" John tried to sit up but Sherlock tightened his grip and he couldn't. "I'm mad. Furious, even. And I'm going to be petty about this for /years/. Like, every single time I want tea in bed you're going to get it for me or I'll bring /this/ up but..." John scoffed. "Not even listening to me. I /love/ you, you berk. I have since I was seventeen. I still do. I'm angry yes but I'm not going to throw you away. I know what that feels like."
You really are tipsy aren't you? SH
Maybe. JW
I guess I do. But only when it's you though. JW
Well it stinks now. Where even are you at? JW
Maybe. How much do you revere me? SH
I asked because you did. SH
Hold on, what's 'hm' supposed to mean? SH
Should I be honoured? JW
[delayed] Good. SH
Mike patted his pockets. "Sorry, mate. I left it at my desk. God, I hope the missus doesn't try and call. She'll have my head." John swallowed thickly. Nobody would miss John if he disappeared tomorrow. He reached into his trouser's pocket and pulled out the mobile Harry had given him. "Here, you can use mine." John held it out in front of him like it was a tidbit and the Alpha a particularly dangerous animal he was trying to tame. John had never seen a man like this before. Those /eyes/, they seemed to bore right into him, digging deeper and deeper, seeing everything. He felt nervous but not afraid, which wasn't necessarily a bad thing.
"You...?" John felt sick. He felt like he was going to faint. Sherlock looked to be a bit younger than himself. So, assuming that Sherlock was younger, add in the admitted drug use, John's joining the Army...the timeline made sense. Which meant that Sherlock could be his Alpha and he'd intentionally numbed his brain to avoid ever seeing John. And now they were here. John was busted beyond repair. Once he'd been a good-looking, sturdy, and strong Omega and now he was broken and thrown out. He felt his whole body tense with sadness and rage and countless other emotions. Then he swayed on his feet, feeling lightheaded.
I don’t know what you're talking about. SH
Will you be home soon? JW
Hey guys.
You're acting odd. But yes, I suppose I could finish for today. SH
Revere you? You sure have high thoughts of yourself huh? JW
Don't play clever with me Sherlock! Why is the whole flat stinking like something has died in here? JW
And it's because we care about you Sherlock. JW
I still think if you'd just playing with my rules we would have had much more fun. SH
Means whatever. JW
Hm? JW
Wow. It's no problem. Thanks to you too, Sherlock. I want it. Now you better hurry home a cuddle up with me before I fall asleep without you. JW
It's a rare occurrence. You like being praised, though. Words of affirmation and all. SH
Sherlock smirked. "I'll take good care of him." he assured the man. He keept his gaze at John, studying him. For some reason, he seemed to waken the detective's instincts. Could it be? Maybe? He would try and break down the wall he had put in his mind, once Mike would be gone. /If/ this was his Omega, he didn't want any disturbances nearby when he found out.
I'm sorry what? JW
It only happens ever so rarely, so I got to enjoy it when it does. JW
It's just something people say Sherlock. JW
You know that I hate when you to say that right? I get worried. JW
Unlike someone who, as I recall, was going to be asleep when I got home? SH
The detective smiled. "Of course." he was silent for a few moments, thinking. John. He couldn't get his mind off the Omega. It was weird. He felt drawn to him. He even felt protective. His heart rate was fastening. The wall he had build around his instincts were crumbling, desolving, slowly. Of course he couldn't be sure unless he knew... he would have to ask. "May I ask you a personal question?"
“God,” John says, rueful, “that didn’t take long at all.”
“Yes.”
An incessant beeping is ringing through the building, ear-piercingly loud.  Visions dance in front of Sherlock’s eyes:  the black smoke swirling, congealing into a madman with black eyes, sloshing pool water, a woman with blonde hair and blue eyes and a Walther PPK pointed at his heart.  Sherlock screams and thrashes in John’s grip, but John only bellows “Stop fucking
Until he wakes, tension taut through his whole body.  He sits up, one hand clenched in the duvet and the other casting about for his nightstand.  For his Sig.
“Oh, hush,” Mrs. Hudson said.  Her tone was light, but the look she shot Sherlock was venomous.  She offered the first cup to Alexander, beaming as he accepted it.  Lurid roses blared across white porcelain, making Sherlock’s eyes smart.  His lip curled.
Sherlock mops up the last of the tea and reaches up to drop the dishtowel in the sink. Bright urgency shines in his eyes.  “I would have died.  In my exile. I would have died.”
Mycroft’s lips twisted into a vicious smirk.  “Usually, such a thing requires an incredible amount of time and paperwork.  It’s far more efficient to assassinate someone and shuffle your justification into nonspecific government dealings.”
“Well?” asked John.  “What were they?”
Pieces of a puzzle began to fall into place, filling gaps of a picture yet unseen. John had been taken to Faerie against his will, kept as a prisoner.
“Ah.”  Sherlock picks at a nonexistent crumb on the sofa.  He wishes John were here to explain love to Rosie – it’s an untrodden path to him, loose footboards on a fraying rope bridge.  “Well.  I suppose it means love comes from unexpected places.”
“He’s—he’s not here?”
“You can.”  John’s voice gentles.  “I know you can.”
“Oh.”  As Sherlock’s senses adjust to the dim light, he sees Rosie rub the heel of her hand over her eyes.  “Had a bad dream,” she mumbles.
There’s a sudden rushing in his ears; for a moment, Sherlock thinks it’s his heartbeat, thudding behind his temples as it races to the bursting point.  But then he feels a disturbance in the water near him, and then hands are grasping at his shoulders, at his waist, down to his feet.  Fingers brush the bonds on his feet and draw back as if repulsed.  Arms wind around Sherlock’s midsection, powerful and sure.
Sherlock is very nearly affronted.  “I find the prospect of you fucking me without a condom to be
“Hospital,” John rasps as they are half-led, half-dragged toward a waiting ambulance.  “Needs hospital.  Arm dislocated – maybe broken.”
pet name.  And then he is hot with shame, because he’s jealous of a bloody infant.
“Right, then,” said John.  “Let’s get cracking, shall we?”
“Although,” cut in Moriarty, one brow arched in a parody of consideration, “I suppose I should use her proper name if I’m going to be implicating her.  Don’t want her to get out of jail on a technicality, after all.  You do still keep your married name after you die, don’t you?”
Now – pumped to bursting with painkillers and antibiotics and blood transfusions and tubes – John was grateful he’d been unconscious for the whole harrowing ordeal.  He remembered, with a sort of threadbare nausea, watching in stupefied horror as Sherlock plummeted from the rooftop of Bart’s Hospital to break on the pavement below.  Remembered fumbling for a pulse in that limp, still-warm wrist.
“Acute myeloid leukemia.”  The words fell through the still air like stones dropping into a well.  “We found it when she was four.  It was… aggressive.  Doctors did all they could, but the cancer moved to her spinal cord and brain.  Couldn’t be stopped.”
John couldn’t take care of anyone.
– Sherlock rounded the corner and walked into the sitting room.  He walked to the end of the sofa and stood, awkward but defiant.  Without looking at him, Lucy raised her hands and performed a series of gestures, fluid and quick.
“I did the wrong thing,” Sherlock says, voice thick.  He bends forward and presses his forehead to the crook of John’s neck.  “I took Rosie’s mother from her.”
Mycroft pursed his lips.  He raised a lazy hand and the car trundled into motion.   “Ever the philosopher, aren’t you?”
As John shrugs off his coat and hangs it from its hook, Sherlock rolls off the sofa and crosses the distance between them with long, fast strides. John tosses him a vacant look as he toes off his soiled brogues, but he doesn’t utter a word.
He hurries to Sherlock’s bedside and sets the book on a nightstand.  His hand comes around Sherlock’s, holding tightly. Bandages swathe his palms; he has burns from the board used to fell Oldacre.  Sherlock strokes his thumb over the porous fibers, mournful.
Mrs. Hudson cocked her head.  “Is everything all right?”
Later that morning – after they’ve washed off the dried sweat and the come, after they’ve brushed their teeth and Sherlock has pressed John to the porcelain lip of the sink to taste the minty grit of toothpaste clinging to John’s mouth – John leaves, pleading work.  Marvelous though he may be, he puts far too much stock in this doctoring lark.
A new light blooms in Sherlock’s field of vision, sudden and steady; he looks over his shoulder and sees John holding his mobile with the torchlight on.  “Better?”
“I hope you don’t mind,” says Charlotte, “that I came to call.  The Detective Inspector said it would be all right.”
Sherlock adjusts the dial, watches red discs slide into focus, fuzz at the edges, and sharpen once more as he turns back a few notches.  Things can be so clear one instant and muddled the next.
“I am!” said John with theatrical surprise.  “Dead serious.  I don’t have a humerus bone in my body.”  He paused and lifted his eyebrows.  “Get it?  Medical joke.”
John appears at the doorway of the kitchen moments later, amused smile vanishing as he sees the figure perched on the stool at Sherlock’s side.  “Ah.”
enough.  Sorry, Sherlock, but even you can’t help me now.  I think…”  Her voice dwindles to a whisper, making her sound small, childlike.  “…I think I’m going to die.”
John takes pride in robbing Sherlock of speech.  His cock is hard and flushed and leaking, bitter salt when John dips his head to tongue the slit.  Sherlock startles with a gasp and, encouraged, John braces his hands on Sherlock’s hips and slips the head of his cock into his mouth.
Sherlock rolls his eyes, but there is a note of urgency in John’s voice that makes him pause and listen.  And
“I like,” John says, “this.”
the realization struck – it must have been a powerful blow, crossing wires, shorting circuits, because the whirring of his mind ground to an agonizing halt.
Molly reaches for her glass and tips him a lascivious grin.  She’s like a yo-yo, veering from one emotion to another before lurching back.  “How’s his cock?”
“Mm… fuzzy.”
“Sorry,” she says.
Stooping, he lifts Rosie in his arms.  Having inherited little in the way of height from either parent, Rosie is small for her age, and John manages her weight well enough.  She tips half-way into slumber as they leave that dreaded warehouse.  A patrol car waits outside, ready to take them home.
John bolts into the dark corridor with Sherlock at his heels, heart slamming in his chest, an answering scream building in his throat.
“Sherlock?”  And oh, that voice.  A comforting voice, like worn leather and old parchment, rasping under his fingers.  Smoke smoldering in his lungs, the scent of gunpowder.
of a gunshot cut her short, and she screamed.  Sherlock shoved her down and beneath the table, hoping that – and the clinging shadows – would offer her a modicum of safety.  He raced for a nearby pillar and sheltered behind it.
John turned to Sherlock, winding an arm around his shoulders.  “This is about Mycroft.”
John mock-scowls at Sherlock.  “You’re the cause of this, you realize.”
Sherlock rubs the bridge of his nose and winces as the pain in his head migrates to that single point of contact.  “What, nothing to say?”  He tries to make the question a jeer, but his voice sounds fragile to his own ears.  “If you’ve got some villainous plan, do get on with it.  I’ve got a splitting headache.”
“Yeah.”  John’s voice is frayed.  “Yeah, me too.”
“Indeed,” said Mycroft.  A pair of dark-suited figures waited in the corridor, as silent and composed as statues.  One stepped into the sitting room and the other led Mrs. Hudson to the sleek BMW parked outside the building.  As the landlady slipped into the car, the first agent looked to John.
“She’s with a sitter for the day.  Mary’s got a shift at the clinic.”
“I don’t have to be the next one.  I’m going to be something else entirely.  Something better.”  A musical note brightened her voice; a nod to a madman’s spark of genius, long after it had reduced to ashes.  “You were too slow, Sherlock.  Ta ta.”
John stiffens, water sloshing out of the cup. “Sherlock!”
He stalked after Sherlock and shoved the front door open.  The detective was waiting on the pavement, hands shoved deep in his pockets and shoulders braced against the chill.  John came to his side and Sherlock leaned away, as if his mere presence was repellent.
Rosie looks at Sherlock.  “When that lady… when she tried to hurt me, you and Daddy…”
If you've read this far and can't go on, I understand.  If you choose to keep reading, I will make efforts to include TWs at the beginning of each chapter.  Thank you.

Sometime between the first dance and the end of dinner, Sherlock gets pleasantly drunk.

The gaggle of Fairies came into view, though Sherlock didn’t think they’d turned around during their walk.  He was greeted by coos and outstretched hands, fingers flexing as though to beckon a dog.  Only Maili stood apart, expression pinched.
“Better sit,” he said, tugging him toward the little stool.  “Mrs. Hudson will be quite put out if she returns to find you unconscious on the floor.”
I’ve only heard stories, but those are enough to give anyone pause, much less someone like… me.  Sherlock Holmes is arrogant, acerbic, and dismissive.  The kind of man who makes you feel like filth he’s just scraped off the bottom of his shoe.  His partner, Dr. John Watson, isn’t much better.
Rosie hums vaguely and peers into the microscope.  There’s nothing on the stage, of course, but she seems content to fiddle with the focus and aperture dials.
“You know this means you’ll actually have to help me clean from now on,” John says.
“Hmm, what?”
Also, all the films on at the theatre are inane.  –SH
“No,” John corrects mildly, “just a little teasing.”
“I wouldn’t say we were ‘friends,’” said Sherlock, unable to curb the bite in his tone.  “We were classmates.”
“I was wondering when your meds would kick in,” John muses.  “There’s my answer.”
“No,” said Sherlock, “what did you call me?”
love.
“China doesn’t have glamor laws,” Sherlock put in.  “And besides, someone with ties to criminal groups probably doesn’t give a toss about our laws.”
“Yeah.”  John’s expression grew intent, eyes dark.  “I did.”
Lucy shook her head, blonde-silver strands of hair coming undone from the plait. Her jaw clenched, her eyes scrunched shut.  Tears slid down her cheeks.
“You were right,” says Lestrade.  “He was in the bloodsicles.  And that’s not all – the lab’s just rang back.  There were two sets of human DNA in the tigers’ leftovers.”
Alexander nodded.  His long, dark fingers wrapped around Rosie’s torso and gently eased her from John’s grip.  Bracing her against his shoulder, he bounced her, one hand cradling the back of her head.  Rosie grinned and babbled.
The elder Holmes brother coughed weakly, face contorting in pain.  John tied off the last tourniquet and set a soothing hand on his wrist.  The blood crusting on his fingers smudged the wool sleeve of Mycroft’s suit jacket.  John felt a little guilty about that; Mycroft was nothing if not fastidiously neat.
“So, I’m.  I’m going.”  His hands found the arms of his chair and gripped the upholstery.  “I’m selling the house in Chiswick.  After that, I… don’t know, really.  Might leave London.  I don’t know where I’ll go, but… I’m going.”
“We won’t be gone long.  Mycroft has a constant eye on you, even if you did pass muster.”  He may as well have voiced the threat:
“Help,” he whispers.  Gathering a scaldingly cold lungful of air, he rattles, “H-help.”
Sherlock smirks at him.  “Not for a skilled sportsman, no.”
“I’m afraid I cannot be so accommodating,” said Mycroft.  He sat ramrod-straight in John’s chair, ankles crossed and elbows propped on the plush arms.  “We have to talk, little brother.”
The door creaked open, tugging John from his thoughts.  Sherlock stood in the doorway, watching him with a bemused expression.
he ordered himself.  With fumbling fingers, he drew his mobile phone out of his pocket and stared at the screen.
Another knock.  Sherlock stood, moved on soundless feet toward the door.  The doorknob glinted in a shaft of afternoon sunlight, polished to a silver sheen.
Sherlock looked up at her with wide, nervous eyes.  “It’s only…”
“’Course,” Sherlock said.  “Would you like a demonstration?”
The scene changes; he and Mary are standing beside a warehouse on the banks of the Thames, the night oily-black and clinging all around them.  Waves break against the walkway barricade with the rhythmic slosh of gouting arteries.
He’s getting off-track.  John is watching Sherlock with a small smile, head cocked ever so slightly.  Sherlock lifts his chin and looks down his nose at him.  “You’ve nothing to be worried about.”
“What?”
Su Lin bobbed her head in a frantic nod.  “The—”
“I think,” Alexander ventured, “she likes me.”  John shot him a filthy look and, smoothly, he added, “And I’ve been cleared by Mycroft Holmes as acceptable company, so you know I’ve had a background check.  A decent one.”
John said nothing, did not move an inch – and then he looked at Sherlock.  His hands went to the clasps of Rosie’s carrier, detaching her with expert ease.  Cradling the baby against his chest, he looked Alexander in the eye.
the divots in his palms say.
“Where is the
He bounded through the crowd of officers, who gave him a wide berth.  The big man followed at a considerably slower pace.  John was left beside the body, fury roiling in his gut.  At last he creaked into motion, trailing behind them.
John budges over so Sherlock can roll onto his back.  His heart slams a frantic tempo against his ribs as he kicks the duvet aside.  His legs are suddenly too gangly, too clumsy.  Tremors skitter through body.  His breath comes in hitching gulps.
“Mm.  Probably getting off the Tube.”
One of Shan’s goons lunged at him.  Sherlock retreated into the shadows, neatly side-stepped the oncoming tackle, and whipped out the fire iron.  He found the nearest patch of exposed skin – the side of the goon’s neck – and pressed the flat of the iron there.  Screams reverberated up the iron and through Sherlock’s arm as the goon’s skin sizzled and curled. The damp air was choked with the stench of burning meat.  As his opponent collapsed, Sherlock withdrew the fire iron and brought the butt of John’s Sig down on his head, knocking him out.
“Marvelous,” said the woman.  “Do you see how clever he is?”
It made a horrible kind of sense, Sherlock thought.  After killing Hope, John seemed much more alive
Pensively, Rosie nods.  She says nothing for a few moments, watching the credits scroll past.  Then, just when Sherlock thinks she’s done asking questions, she says, “Do you love Daddy?”
Sherlock completed the purchase – one ticket.  “I’m afraid I’ll be going alone.”
Sherlock turned his head and chewed on his lip.  He felt an utter fool.
“Not that we know of,” Sherlock concedes.
And then Sherlock is winding his fingers through John’s short, silk-fine hair and dragging him back in, slotting their mouths together with a hunger that startles them both.  John gives a little gasp and runs his hands up Sherlock’s chest, fisting in the lapels of his dressing gown.  His lips part and Sherlock follows suit, tilting his head and deepening the kiss, feeling his heart kick into a sprint.  He has a fever—he’s feverish—he
John is still in his chair when Sherlock returns to the sitting room. His eyes are closed, chin propped on the heel of his hand.  He wakes with a startled snuffle when Sherlock touches his arm.  “What.  What?”
“Please?” he implored, letting a mischievous quirk tug at his lips, like he and the nurse were in together on a little secret.  Again the nurse hesitated, but after a moment, a tremulous smile lit her face and she crossed to the desk on the wall opposite of John’s bed.  Rifling through a drawer, she found the chart and presented it to him.
The car rumbled to a halt and John shoved the pill bottle back in his pocket.  He looked out the window and saw the façade of 221 rearing above, at once comforting and formidable.
John had had enough.  He rounded on Alexander with a glower.  “We’re going.  We’ll discuss this with you tomorrow.”

Shut it, freak!”
like a mazikeen.  His eyes were an ordinary shade of blue, his face weathered.  Some accounts suggested that redcaps had long teeth, but John’s appeared normal.  Even his ears looked human: neat crescents without a hint of the characteristic point.  Unheard of in a mazikeen.
“Yes,” sighs Ms. Helens.  “Yes, I think that’s the best we can do for now.  Rosie, you and I will have a talk tomorrow.”
“Let’s go.”
Sherlock turns his head a fraction, scanning the surrounding crime scene.  John hovers at the police tape.  Their eyes meet, cling – and John looks away.
“Mrs. Hudson’s sister is common knowledge, John,” put in Sherlock.  “Winter has probably already gathered information on her.  In fact…”  He glanced at Mycroft, silently questioning.
“I’ve got professionals for that,” said Sherlock, “not retired exotic dancers.”
“You don’t have to do it,” said Sherlock.  “You can stop.  Stop trying to do this and put it all behind you.”  He paused, scrabbling for a foothold.  “Think… think of Rosie.  Think of John.”
Seeming satisfied with this verdict, Rosie puts on her coat and boots, gathers her bag, and waves goodbye to Sherlock as John leads her out the door.  The look John throws over his shoulder as they walk down the stairs is somehow both roguish and uncomplicatedly content.  The door to 221B snicks shut behind them.
“I can learn,” Rosie insists.
Eirene drained the cup.  Dropping the flower, she pulled Sherlock further along the path.  Her bare foot came down on the flower with a decisive step, crushing its petals under her heel.
This news gives me a start.  After my initial research of John Watson and Sherlock Holmes – the bulk done on John’s blog – the two had become inextricably interwoven with 221B Baker Street in my mind, as if there was no other place in the world they could exist.

.”  Rosie shrugs, takes an unbothered swig from her glass of milk.  “I saw some boys making fun of her at break time ‘cause—”
“You’ve been saying that for the past hour.”
“Well.”  John shoots Sherlock an apologetic look and climbs the stairs to the landing.  Sherlock, heart still sprinting, draws a shaky breath to compose himself and follows.  John takes Rosie’s hand in his and leads her into the flat.  “It is a weekend, after all.  You can go back to sleep if you like.”
Instantly John’s hand finds his mouth, clamping his palm over it to stifle the cry.  John’s voice is low and ragged when he says, “Ssh.  Still early.  We don’t want to wake Rosie, do we?”
Sherlock closes his eyes, stone-still, as John brushes his hair aside and dabs at the scrape on his forehead.  The alcohol stings with a clean, burning twinge.  Hidden in the dark behind closed eyes, Sherlock’s fantasies begin spinning once more.  He imagines John lowering the wipe and penlight, cupping Sherlock’s face in his hands, coming close to kiss his hurt, his lips.  A flush rises to his cheeks.
“This had better be important,” he says imperiously by way of greeting.  “I have a highly sensitive experiment in progress.”  A total lie – even a monkey could infer the effects of Coumadin on hemophiliac blood.  But Sherlock isn’t about to let Lestrade know how bored he is.  He’ll start thinking cases can be rationed, a currency with which to make Sherlock behave.
If you find yourself wrong-footed by the epilogue, it might help to read the prologue a second time.  :)
TW in this chapter for descriptions of child abuse.
“…I see you!”  John turned from the window to see Mary leaning over Rosie’s crib, a fuzzy, pink blanket held in her hands.  Seemingly oblivious to John’s presence, she drew the blanket away from Rosie and covered her face.  Rosie gasped and coughed.  Mary dropped the blanket with a theatrical gasp.  “Peek-a-boo!  I see you!”
Sherlock scowls, though the blush has yet to vanish.  “You’re sleep deprived.  Clearly it’s addled your mind.”  He spins around and stalks toward his –
Calling to confirm our reservation at Onima.  It’s at 8.
“Sherlock?”
Sherlock closed the folder and tossed it onto the seat beside Mycroft with a flap.  “And you want me to find him.  So very sorry, but I’m busy.  Besides, my last trip to Eastern Europe wasn’t exactly a treat.”
Mycroft’s eyes narrowed.  “Dr. Watson.”
“Yoo-hoo!” she calls, tapping on the door and poking her head inside.  Sherlock and John, each seated in their respective chair, look up in unison.  “Boys, you’ve got a visitor.”
Sherlock looked to John and saw that he had frozen, too.  He was falling, spiraling with nothing to cling to.
John smiled wearily.  Gone was the brisk, buoyant younger man of minutes ago.  Now, John looked… tired.  Worn thin.  An impulse to close the scant distance between them seized Sherlock – to hold and warm, to feel vitality surging beneath his hands.  His fingers bit into the sofa’s upholstery.
The terror, incoherent but visceral, is the worst part.  It slides through Sherlock’s veins like shards of ice, chilling him from within and gliding with quiet, rending purpose toward his heart.  If John decides he no longer wants Sherlock – or realizes he
“D’you say something?” he murmured.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
John turns back to the mirror, fiddling with his fringe, tucking away unruly strands.  Seeing his cue to leave, Sherlock turns and walks toward the stairs.  Stops at the threshold of the bedroom.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
“I have—that is, I’m not…”
The group disbanded, each off to their own task.  As Sherlock strayed toward the kitchen, contemplating a final look, he found Anderson and Donovan standing in an alcove of the sitting room, heads bent and voices hushed.
And then he
Sherlock announced he was going out the next day, come hell or high water.  “Molly has a very interesting corpse for me.  Klinefelter syndrome.”
“I’m not leaving the clinic, Sherlock.  Your clients aren’t consistent or lucrative enough for us to afford central London.”
John kisses him again, and in that moment, Sherlock cannot fathom having ever been cold.  His new life stretches before him like a beam of light, and John is the conductor.  A path, beckoning.
?” John demanded.  No amount of pressure could stop the blood welling between his fingers and crusting in the creases of his palms.  Pooling in the sand, clotting in the tracks of his boots, washing pink down the drain.  The fetid stink as it ripened under the Afghan sun.
A knock comes at the door as he tugs his arms through the sleeves.  “Sherlock?” John calls.  “You awake?”
location.  He retrieved John’s Sig from the nightstand beside his bed.  For himself, Sherlock chose a fire iron – medieval, perhaps, but more dignified than a cast-iron skillet.
“Mrs. Hudson wasn’t the one getting married.”
“Sherlock…”  John looked at him through a sheen of tears.  “I might hurt you.”
Not so very long ago, John had devised distractions to keep Sherlock’s mind off the drugs.  They never worked, not completely – Sherlock’s wits were too quick, darting from Cluedo to
“I am,” said Jeff.  He gulped in a breath and croaked, “They’ve taken her.  They’ve taken Lucy.”
He drags his stare from the treacherous little sprig, finds himself looking into John’s eyes.  John’s expression is unreadable and unflinching.  His lips move, as if trying to form words, but he doesn’t make a sound.  And slowly, slowly, he steps into Sherlock’s space.
“You did,” said Sherlock, firmly.  John settled into the seat opposite of him, wincing as pain skittered under his ribs.  Staring into the steaming murk of his own tea, Sherlock said, “You were there.”
Sherlock stills, the narrator’s old, fussy tones intertwining with the thought that has been plaguing him to form a mad sort of sense.  He is no novice at romance – the past year with John has ensured that much.  He knows John loves him, knows it like he knows the mechanisms that knit together organic molecules, knows it with the same breath-stealing certainty as cyanide choking off the electron transport chain.
Swallowing his fear, Sherlock tugged open the refrigerator door and bent to the case on the bottom drawer, beside the feet.  An IPA with a ridiculous name about trout.  Sherlock couldn’t remember why he’d taken it into his head to buy the beer, but buy it he had.  He paused with the first two bottles in hand.  Was this going too far?
John snaps awake and his hand shoots out, viper-quick, to seize Sherlock’s wrist.  Sherlock startles, but John’s grip is iron.  His breathing comes fast, shoulders heaving.  Muttering an oath, he eases his grip and Sherlock draws back.
Su Lin had been making it that night, before Zhi Zhu arrived.  When the bullets flew, obliterating the pots, the tabletop had been sluiced with tea.  Sticky and sweet in the creases of Sherlock’s bleeding palms.
I have no Beta or Britpicker, so if you notice any mistakes, let me know and I can correct them!
At the sight of his brother, Sherlock was hard-pressed to keep his composure.  Mycroft looked like he had aged ten years since their last meeting.  His features were drawn and his hands quaked on the crook of his umbrella.  Dark shadows hung under his eyes.  His stare was devoid of the smug gleam Sherlock knew so well.
A muscle jerked in John’s jaw, but he didn’t rise to the bait.  “Did you learn anything about Mary?  Anything at all?”
For those of you who were wondering:  Yes, Sherlock's comment re: Kermit was inspired by the iconic Twitter takeover.
Worry ate at John.  “Has anyone been ‘round to see him?”
As the Christmas by the River market fades into the distance, the red dot slowly but surely regains the shape of a human being.  Sherlock pushes himself harder, faster, exhilarated.  The distance between them is closing.  He may catch the killer yet.
“But you did.”
“Shut up, love,” John says fondly, and crowds forward on bended knees to kiss him quiet.
The bedroom door creaked open and Sherlock startled.  Craning his neck, he saw John’s small, compact silhouette drift toward the bed on silent feet.  The shape of Sherlock’s dressing gown fluttered around his ankles; the sight made Sherlock’s chest tighten.
John draws back and smiles.  “I can’t wait to show you off.”
The Peckham Council Tower was less imposing in the light of day, though Sherlock wondered if that was a fair price to pay for illuminating the disrepair the building suffered.  Stripped of the cloak of night, the pitted gravel around the building was a choked mess of cigarette butts, beer cans, and bits of broken glass.  Plaster curled off the brickwork in patches like flakes of skin sloughing off a leper.
“I think,” says John, “I want to be amazed by you forever.”
John’s case for Sherlock was not helped by the consulting detective’s long silences and absence from the Watson household.  When Moriarty announced his return -
Sherlock relented, shot a death glare at the PA as they passed, and hustled after John.  Half-way down the corridor, John smothered a snicker – then burst into giggles.  Sherlock’s lungs strained as he tipped into great, snorting guffaws.
Greg flicks his eyes from Sherlock to John.  Something has changed between them.  The yearning looks are nothing new; Greg is used to the mutual pining, has learned to dismiss it as white noise.  Donovan and Anderson and the others have bets on how long the two have been shagging, but Greg’s never pitched in.  He knows the difference between resignation and anticipation. It’s the bold-inked line between
“Yeah.”  Rosie’s hand moves absently to the reindeer’s ear, toying with the felt.  “And Sammy says her brother had a boyfriend.  Before he died.”
She drifted away and was tottering down the stairs before Sherlock could find his voice.  As if sensing his discomfort, Mycroft favored him with an oily smile.
John wants him to take care of his hands.  Very well; he will, provided John does the same.
– and Sherlock’s cheeks flame as the realization sinks into his addled mind, for he can feel far more than the warm arms encircling his waist, the bare chest pressed to his naked back.  In his sleep, John hums and shifts closer, his warm breath puffing against Sherlock’s ear and his prick jutting in a friendly manner at the small of Sherlock’s back.
Sherlock didn’t know what to say.  He raised his hand and looked at his improvised weapon – the object he’d had no time to consider, too consumed by the fight.  His mind, sluggish with incomprehension, was slow to process it. When he finally understood, a bolt of shock struck him to the core.
.  But John sees and, brow furrowed, draws Sherlock toward him so they lie chest to chest.  The slowing
Sherlock takes this in, a little dazed.  A rough timeline begins scratching itself out in his head, but there are gaps he can’t account for – how long he was unconscious, when he was moved to the freezer, when he was rescued.  The time it takes to freeze or asphyxiate in a walk-in freezer is alarmingly little.  Something niggles at him, but he can’t quite put his finger on it.
The shrill chime of Sherlock’s mobile interrupts him.  They wait, suspended on a beat of silence.  A second chime sounds, and just like that, the spell is broken.  John ducks his head and takes a step back, mouth flattening into a thin line.  Sherlock’s hand slides into his pocket, relying on reflex.  A good thing, that – his mind is spinning too much to coherently command his body.
“Sherlock?”
“Yes.”
“Oh.”  John smiles hesitantly.  “You… like it?”
He was scarcely out of earshot when Sherlock rounded on Harry.
“’Everybody’ doesn’t have PTSD,” Sherlock replies, and John goes still. Sherlock continues, either oblivious or uncaring.  “And before you work yourself into a lather, trust me, it wasn’t much of a leap.  With your history, it was more likely than not. And, though I maintain psychology is a pseudoscience, studies suggest that PTSD and somatization disorders go hand-in-hand.  Quite chummy. And you suffer from recurrent nightmares, so.”  He cocks his head and drawls, “PTSD.”
“…other rooms we haven’t searched.  Let’s go.”
“Sherlock!”  Molly’s voice behind him, strident and slurred.
There is no real venom behind the words, so John rolls his eyes in weary resignation.  “Right. Don’t work yourself into a snit.” But he continues his ministrations, fingernails gently scraping the scalp in mute reprimand.
Minutes later, dressed and clean, Sherlock wandered into the kitchen to find John leaning against the counter with Rosie in his arms.  John looked at Sherlock and away, the corners of his mouth turning down; Rosie, ignoring his presence, sucked contentedly at her bottle.  Silence pressed upon them for a long moment.
“Parking garage?  Where do you keep this?”
He sits in his chair while he waits for the loo.  Every moment is a careful interment of memory: placing each one with care, scooping up the earth to cover what he cannot bear to see.  Sealing away the past hours.
“Seems a bit pointless now, don’t you think?”
I’m sorry, John.
“‘Night,” said John, his voice a murmur.
“Come on, up you get,” says John.  Bending forward, he winds one arm under Sherlock’s and around his shoulders, helping him stand.  Sherlock has little choice but to shuffle along, down the corridor and into the bathroom.  The sound of running water does little to sooth his nerves.  “Think you can manage your, er, clothes?  With your hands?”
Sherlock nods.  He is determined to keep going no matter how he feels, but John needn’t know that.
The door flew open and Sherlock was leaning awkwardly on a crutch in front of him, eyes wide, lips parted on an indrawn breath.  John took a step back and the pain spidered through his side.  His left leg crumpled and he fell, but Sherlock was there, leaning heavily on his crutch and seizing John under the elbow and hauling him upright.  John braced against the wall, panting and sweating.  Sherlock’s hand shook on his elbow.  After several moments, he found his footing and looked up.
On a bad week it can be up to 70 percent. JW
Maybe I won't be this time. JW
"I don't...?" John turned at looked over at Mike. All grins but no help there. Fantastic. "I don't understand? Afghanistan. Did...do I know you?" John hoped it would be impossible to forget those eyes but he'd nearly walked straight past Mike without recognizing him so it was at least probable. John wondered, briefly, what this Alpha's mate looked like. Probably someone as beautiful as him, someone with dark hair and slender features, some winsome little thing that kept him up to his knees in revoltingly adorable children. His heart clinched and he took a step back and away, almost hiding behind Mike.
I removed the specimen from the microwave for you, though. You're welcome. SH
And when will you be home? JW
John blushed. "No need to flatter me. I wish you could've seen me when I was younger. I was something to look at then." John still felt hurt. He still felt angry. But he knew he could move past it, starting with beating the hell out of this older brother of Sherlock's that had convinced him he didn't deserve an Omega. That was something to look forward to. "I love you too. It's going to be okay. You utter arse, I promise. It's going to be fine."
John. SH
Alcohol is something else Sherlock. JW
John. The Omega's name was John. The Alpha frowned. Rough go? Question for his Omega. Ah. The man hadn't found his Alpha yet. "I don't have an Omega." Sherlock told, hoping to make the other feel less miserable. For some reason, he couldn't bear to see him like that. "I never caught the scent. So." he crooked a smile, looking down at his samples again. "You have no reason to be ashamed. It happens that some meet their partner later than normally." he frowned a bit at his own words. Why was he trying to be comforting? He never did that!
Tea then. I'm bored as heck ok? JW
You never just 'do something because others do', also I've said several times that I wasn't gay, so you practically had the answer already. JW
You're not home yet. JW
Oops! Not intended. Drunk now. Sorry. JW
I guess I did. JW
I suppose so. SH
That cluedo game could've. It would have been a great improvement. SH
"When was the last time, you were in heat?" he asked, moving his gaze away from the other to seem less invasive. "Even if I was your Alpha, I'd only be able to tell if you were. And, well, the possibilities of that are rather small." he crooked another smile, feeling a little awkward. "I'm sorry, if it's too invasive." he said. "You don't have to answer."
Sherlock looked away for a moment, controlling himself. "No, of course not," he mumbled, scratching the back of his head. Was this him? Could it be? Could Omegas feel when their Alpha was near? He had not done much research on that. "I'm sorry." he said, looking at John again. "I, uh, I thought I smelled something. There's something over you, which I can't explain, and I'm not used to that." he paused, feeling a sly blush creep onto his pale cheeks. Christ! "You don't have to worry." he assured the other. "I'm not going to suddenly attack you."
What? SH
It's called a hungover Sherlock. JW
Sherlock? JW
I said I'll think about it. SH
That's nice. SH
"You gonna be okay?" Mike asked. John nodded. "Yeah. I can take care of myself. Punch like a Beta, yeah?" Mike chuckled and walked off, muttering about his mobile and how he needed to find it or he'd be in trouble. John leaned against his cane and looked up at Sherlock. Alone. With an Alpha. He swallowed thickly. "Yeah, so...like he said. My name is John. It's nice to meet you. Do you work here? Are you a chemist or something?"
Well, I'll just fall asleep in your bed tonight, and then you can join me when you get home. JW
At Barts. I need different equipment. SH
"Oh. That's interesting. Makes sense, seeing as how you did that thing where you guessed everything based on looking at me." A cop of some sort, then. Yes, that fit into everything John knew until now. John tilted his head, taking in the way Sherlock smiled, the way he stepped just a millimeter closer. Oh. Right. He cleared his throat. "Before we go out I should clear something up. Yes, my Alpha never came but that doesn't mean I'm...I'm flattered, obviously, but I'm still very much in love with my Alpha. Stupid and sentimental, I know, but that's the truth. So thank you but...this can't happen."
Be my guest. I hardly use it as you know. SH
What's that supposed to mean? SH
20-30 percent I guess. Hard to say as it shifts very regularly. JW
The one with Miss Havishim's daughter. It's quite boring actually, but it's passing the time. SH
I guess. JW
Occasionally to the former. Yes to the latter. SH
You say that, but you are always are awake, liar. SH
I could come and cuddle with you if that'd help? ;) JW
Are you gay? JW
Mike was nice. Gentle, soft-spoken, just a hint of playful teasing on his voice. His Omega kept him well-fed and happy, his children joyful. John really wanted to hate him but found that he couldn't. It was nice, this little bit of normal, even if his heart broke every time Mike made some reference to his wife and kids. It was a nice distraction, if a little boring. John smiled and nodded and did all the polite things he knew he was supposed to do. Mike opened the door to a lab and John limped in. "It's a bit different from my day, innit?" It was so strange. Some things were old and familiar, some new and so modern-looking that he was afraid he'd break everything he touched. And there, in the middle of this lab, was an Alpha. John wrinkled his nose at the scent of him, all chemicals and rosin and expensive hair product. Under all those was something sweeter but he couldn't name it.
Fine. Don't expect me to be awake when you get home then. JW
You're the one writing things that could be in Stephenie Myer's next novel. SH
Eventually. SH
Take that as you like. JW
John shook his head. He was a doctor and had done the research. The latest an Alpha had ever found their Omega was six heats in, roughly two years after first presenting, give or take. That or the soul mate died before presenting. As far as he knew he was the only one of his kind. John made a sad sound in the back of his throat. This Alpha's Omega was probably long gone. Poor man. Poor Sherlock. The Alpha's name was Sherlock. Very unusual but it suited him. "I'm sorry. About your Omega, I mean."
Can one really be hopeless if hope is not a physical thing? SH
I could fall asleep at any time you know. JW
You know you could be home with me, drinking beer instead, right? JW
Good then. JW
[delayed] I do. SH
Only once. I had a terrible headache the next day. SH
And who said I'm not going to be asleep? JW
Yeah, but there's something thrilling about you saying it. JW
"You have to ask?" John joked with him. "You can't tell just by looking at my shoes or something?" He chuckled. "Of course. You can ask whatever you like. Sadly I've...probably gotten more invasive questions than whatever you're going to ask." Everybody had questions for him and sometimes he was in a mood to ask them and sometimes he'd tell them to piss off. But for some reason being with Sherlock put him in a better mood. Maybe it was because someone finally understood.
If you won't stop teasing I'm just gonna fall asleep in your bed instead. JW
We'll sure as heck never play that again. JW
You're hopeless. Should I order takeaway for you too or will you be home later than that? JW
What? Huh? I don't think I got it? I am what? JW
That's not too bad. I don't care what others think. Only what you think, mostly. Although you can be biased. SH
I thought we were having a heart-to-heart about our sexual preferences. I was just continuing the conversation. And confirming some suspicions. SH
Hm. Whatever you say. JW
John took a deep breath in. "Let's...not get ahead of ourselves. You /could/ be my Alpha but that doesn't mean you /are/." He felt dizzy. "I-I need to sit down. Can I-" John remembered the last thing he saw before he finally felt woozy enough to hit his knees was Sherlock looking so fucking sad. And how John would've let him have that last breath in his body if it meant Sherlock didn't ever look sad again. So...yes. This was his Alpha and he still loved him. He was furious with him but he loved him still. Like an idiot.
Live skin. SH
Most Omegas longed for their first heat. Oh, it was supposed to be painful, yes, and it was the start of a lot of stigma and prejudice, but there was one perk. The scent of an Omega on the cusp of heat attracted the soul mate; the one Alpha meant for them and just for them. Yes, for many it took one or two heats for the Alpha to find them, but they were always found. It was quite romantic, the Alpha storming the streets in search for the Omega that needed them. But John Watson…his Alpha never came. He took heat after heat alone, since the day he turned seventeen and presented. By the time he was twenty-six he knew no Alpha would come for him, so he took suppressants, joined the Army, and cried at night when no one would hear him. Life got crueler and crueler. He was shot, discharged, and alone, wandering through London, a broken Omega with no Alpha. He had never been chosen, and it hurt more than his shoulder did. So when Mike Stamford offered a tour, fuck it, he took it.
There is other times where you're just a downright arse. But you know that. JW
The detective could feel a tear roll down his cheek. "I'm so sorry." he whispered, tightening his hold on his Omega. "So sorry..." he, of all people, couldn't find anything to say other than those words. That was what he felt. Sorry. And love. "I understand perfectly, if you don't want me." he sighed, his heart hammering in his chest as never before. He was scared. What if John threw him away? As Mycroft had said he would...
Which is odd because I'm rubbish at compliments. SH
You said it yourself that I'm a "delight" to talk to. I'm still taking it as a compliment regardless of it's original intentions. SH
I mean, that's fine and everything. SH
Sherlock nodded. "I'm sorry for your Alpha." he said. Something inside him screamed WRONG! Instincts... it was a long time ago he had felt them. He couldn't let this man, John, let John get away. Needed more data. "Would you mind having dinner with me?" he asked, keeping the cool facade. Without Mike being near, he would be able to have a proper conversation with this, gorgeous, wait, what? With this /interesting/ Omega.
Sherlock strained his ears to hear the rush of sound undercutting the puppet’s words: bustling footsteps, a fog of voices.  “What’s that noise?”
“D’you wish we had chosen a different time?” he asks.
Sherlock stared, and stared, and stared, but John only picked up the newspaper from the arm of his chair and flicked it open, eyes scanning the headlines. “Liverpool’s playing Manchester on Wednesday.  I should ask Greg if he wants to go for a pint.”
Sherlock licks his lips.  “It’s… tolerable.”
John could no longer hold his tongue.  “Let me come through!” he barked.  The two officers standing nearest to him jumped and assumed stiff-backed postures as he approached.  Seeing him, one put a hand to his shoulder, stalling him.
These thoughts are cast aside as John settles his hands on Sherlock’s waist and draws him down for a chaste, lingering kiss.  It’s a little awkward when Sherlock hastens to lower violin and bow, but John only laughs quietly as he sets them on a chair and returns to the kiss with fervor.  Sherlock flicks his tongue along the seam of John’s lips and John pulls back, wistful.
“No.  And the lab couldn’t get proper funding without Uncle Ralph, so I lost my job.” Violet balls her hands into fists on her lap.  “I—I needed money, so I started looking for work.  Nannying. Anyway, I found a job that offered twice the going rate to nanny for a man’s daughter.  They hired me on the spot.”
“You would get bored.”
The moment splinters.  Sherlock nods.  “Yes. Well, I’m—I’m going to.”  He gestures toward the corridor, toward his bedroom.
The admission took John by surprise.  “You?  Afraid?”
“I’m serious.  Haven’t you heard Rosie when she’s in a mood?  And you think giving her a violin to screech with will improve that?”
Silence hung between them.  With a pitying smile, Mary said, “It’s fine.  I completely understand.”
The door knocker was cockeyed when John returned.  Relief fluttered in his breast and he set to the stairs with single-minded determination.  When he reached the landing, he became aware of a frantic shuffling beyond the door.  Frowning, he reached for the knob.
“Playing,”
“Yes,” says Rosie.
a mazikeen.  People just can’t compute.”
“You were estranged from your siblings,” Sherlock says.  He doesn’t feel sorry for Catherine’s death, not in the least.  Not after she threatened Rosie.  “Children of an abusive parent should band together – it helps them cope, gives them an ally.  Why didn’t you?”
“Crying shame, that,” said Sherlock.  “I find the Fair Folk very diverting.”
“Pah,” says Sherlock – the quintessential affronted old man.  But his cheeks are tinted pink and he’s not quite smothering his grin as he averts his gaze.
“James,” she said by way of greeting.
“That was well played,” he says.
Wincing, Sherlock climbed to his feet and staggered toward the gaping holes in the wall.  A warm breeze fanned across his face, bringing with it the stench of char and gas. Outside, the few remaining streetlamps transformed the clouds of dust into a gauzy shroud.
“We have to go to Canada Water,” he said.
Sherlock picks up his violin and bow, tucking them safely into their case while John situates himself beside Rosie on the bed.  Sherlock brings the chair to the bedside, not
John startles and tears his gaze from Sherlock.  “Right.  I’ll just—be back later.  Goodnight.”
“Mrs. Hudson,” Sherlock said, wiping the image from his mind’s eye.  “I assume you came up here for a reason and not just to waste both of our time, so
Sherlock, prone on the floor of Magnussen’s flat.  Unresponsive.  A bright, red stain blooming on his shirtfront.  How many times had Mary said she was doing one thing - work, seeing friends, staying home when John went out - and done something despicable instead?  How many people had she hurt while John stood blindly by?
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
“S’nod fair,” he mutters, congestion softening his consonants into mush.  “Why did’n you ged sig?”
John nods mutely, and they set off for the Great Tower.  It’s a long walk from the car park to the curtain walls.  They pass the time in silence, save for the soft crunch of snow underfoot and the whistle of wind careening over the hilltop.  Closed for the season, the castle grounds are eerily still and devoid of life.  Small wonder Peter chose to hide here:  there are no visitors to torment him, no fathers to beat him and scream abuse.  His only company can be that of ghosts – whether they haunt his mind or his past, Sherlock cannot say.
John catches up with him a minute later.  “Sherlock.”  A single word, full of admonishment.
“Don’t be puritanical,” Sherlock says.  “You had your tongue in some utterly heinous places last night.”
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
“This is a dream.”
“Don’t just… mash your words together like a common animal.”
They pass the cab ride back to Baker Street with fingers entwined.  Sherlock’s stomach begins to settle, but each lurch of the cab makes him grit his teeth and grip John’s hand more tightly.  John is quiet, running his thumb over Sherlock’s knuckles every few minutes.
The old woman is, amazingly, Mrs. Hudson.  She’s ancient, but she flits around like a little bird, energetic enough that I don’t worry she’s going to drop dead the moment I turn around.  After ushering me to an armchair, she bustles into the kitchen and sets a kettle to boil.
Sherlock lengthens his stride, eager to get back to 221B as quickly as possible.  They have just concluded a long, challenging case – a spat between barristers gone murderous – and, despite having solved it in his usual brilliant fashion, Sherlock feels deflated.  John has been peevish the entire time.  He visited his sister yesterday, ready to celebrate one month of sobriety, only to discover she had relapsed again.  He grumbled through the entirety of the case, moody and glowering and tight-lipped with his praise.
“I’m not the one raving like a madman in a public street!”
“I,” John began.  “When… when I—”
.  But John was drifting in and out of his own nightmares, trapped in a no-man’s land where common sense had no meaning.  Heart thundering, he reached a hand out, held it suspended above Sherlock’s sleeping form.
It is nearly midnight when the door to Rosie’s bedroom snicks open, followed by her light but resolute tread descending the stairs.  The three adults turn to regard her in surprise when she emerges in the sitting room, chin held high.  She still has the reindeer under her arm – the one Sherlock gave her.
Violet stands, looking confused.  “Mr. Holmes, please—I don’t know where else to turn.  The police won’t listen—”
One of the photographs spins slowly into focus and Sherlock stills, cold in spite of the warm water lapping at his skin.  Rosie beams down at him, all golden insolence and charm.  Sherlock looks down at his hands, unable to bear the site.  His fingernails are ripped and caked with coal.
“Let’s go home,” Sherlock says.
“What?” Lestrade’s voice replied, jarring in its suddenness.  “Sherlock, it’s me.”
Sherlock wants to say something spiteful – he wants to cut this nameless, faceless woman down in John’s eyes,
“W-Watson?” Sherlock prompts, desperate to shut her up.  “Where is sh-she?”
“He,” proclaimed Sherlock, “is brilliant.  Truly a glorious, noble creature.”
“Nope,” said Sherlock, popping the ‘p.’  “Mycroft ran you off weeks ago.”
John’s gaze does not waver from Cotton Bud, but his free hand speeds to the inside pocket of his coat.  He draws the Sig and levels it at Piggy in the space of a heartbeat.
he reminded himself.  A mantra to ward off the shame.
“Mr. Holmes.”  Alexander Grant sounded more slightly more composed than he had been minutes ago.  “We need to talk.”
He stood and fled toward the stairwell.  Toward his lonely room, where the concentrated musk of him was ingrained in the sheets of his bed.  Sherlock remembered the scent, the furtive theft of it, and felt his blood warm.
“You’ll need to amend that notion sooner than you thought,” he said.
“Right.”  Molly rolled her eyes.  “Go on. Give me your best puppy-dog eyes, sweetling.”
“Of course you don’t,” says John indulgently.  He turns to me with a quavering smile.  “Ro-… Cathy.  You have a lot of questions.  I will answer as many as I can, but before we start, I have to say this:  letting you go was the hardest thing I’ve ever done.  I knew it was right, but my God…”  His voice cracks.  “It hurt.  Letting you go.  I felt like I’d ripped a part of my heart out.”
you,” says Catherine, stopping beside him.  Her breath fogs the air before the wind catches it, carrying it away like a fleeing ghost.  “Thought so.  You’ve got a very recognizable profile, you know.”
John emerges from the mouth of the alleyway and steps into Cotton Bud’s path. He studies the thug for a moment, dismisses him, and flashes a radiant smile at Sherlock.  “Hello, gorgeous.”
He glances at John, catches his eye.  John drops his gaze to the floor.  “Let’s—let’s go,” he mutters.
Sherlock’s hands shook as he exited the conversation with Mary and opened a new one.  The contact was unsaved and he took care to delete their every exchange.  In less than a second, he extracted a number from a nook in his Mind Palace and tapped it into the phone.
“Wiggins,” Sherlock gasped.
Sherlock could laugh at himself.  He never had a right to interfere in the first place – that would imply that he stood a chance.  That John might want him, too.
“Morcar Museum,” Sherlock bellowed, drowning out the cabbie’s complaints.  “Get me there in ten minutes and I’ll pay you double.”
“Yes.”  John makes a show of folding the duvet, careful to keep it strategically-situated.  Sherlock doubts it’s necessary; Rosie has no notion of erections, and even if she
“I’ve got a million pounds,” says Rosie.  Her complete conviction is unnerving.
Of course!  If John was a redcap mazikeen, it only made sense that—
“Indeed.  I’m very competitive.”
“Right.”  The levity in John’s tone is carefully-calculated to minimize suspicion, and that math captures Sherlock’s interest.  “Any interesting dreams?”
“Shut up!” Harry hissed.  She darted a glance over her shoulder, as if expecting Lestrade to materialize at the worst possible moment.  Turning back to Sherlock, she glowered.  “Christ, John told me you were a cock, but I didn’t realize…”
“Sorry, darling,” John said.  “There you are.  See?  Not the end of the world.”  Rosie grumbled and tugged on his finger.
to the violin as much as he is able.  The song is long but as nimble and graceful as dancers’ feet.  As the final note strums through the air, Sherlock lowers his violin.  Rosie is fast asleep.
When John left the previous evening, Sherlock had retreated to his mind palace and busied himself filing away every conceivable detail he could recall from the kiss.  The warm rush of John’s huffed breathing slotted into place beside the panting exertion of a run through London streets and the quiet sighs Sherlock had caught so long ago, lying utterly still and silent in his bed, straining to hear John in the bedroom above.  The tensing of John’s forearms under Sherlock’s fingers joined the clamp of intertwined fingers they ran from the police.  It had taken hours of meticulous work to sort through all the sensations.
“Later,” Sherlock murmured.
“Don’t be obsti… ob… bloody pig-headed,” Molly says.  “I know you, Sherlock Holmes.  You’re mad for him.”
Lestrade sighed.  After a beat, he said, “There’s been an… incident.  Canada Waters.  Will you come?”
“’My sister!’” cries one doll.
And then it is John’s turn to burst into howls of laughter, drawing every eye on the street.  Sherlock doesn’t care.  He watches John, grinning so hard his face hurts.  Wiping tears from his eyes, John takes the offering.  “What prompted this?”
But John only said, “Wait, Sherlock, you… you can see the Fae?”
“Hadn’t noticed,” Rosie parrots.
Sherlock steps away from the corpse to let Donovan take over.  He moves to stand before John, a smile playing about his mouth.  John’s eyes dart to his lips and he mirrors the smile.  His lower lip catches under his teeth.  Raising a hand, he rubs the back of his neck, moving the collar of his button-up just enough so the corner of a bruise peeks out.
“Sherlock,” John begins, then falters.  A beat of silence passes and he forges onward.  “I—I know the timing is shit, but I’ve.  I’ve got to say something about…”
Glancing over his shoulder, John angled his gaze into the kitchen.  Sherlock was seated at the kitchen table with his crutches propped against the edge.  The table was coated snugly with plastic wrap, making it rumple and gleam.  Sherlock was rubbing something very dead and
John’s voice is all steel.  A soldier’s voice.  A voice for battle.  “Use that big brain of yours.  Solve it!”
“Yes.”  Sherlock is fierce.  “I’m going to plague you.”
The word shook through Sherlock like a blow.  “You’re different,” the puppet continued.  “You’re special.”
“Fuck off,” Piggy grumbles.
As evening draws into night, Mrs. Hudson arrives at the flat with a plate of nibbles and sherry.  “To a very Happy New Year,” she warbles, and tips back glass after glass.  If she sees any hint of their disquiet, she says nothing about it.  Rosie has not emerged from her room in hours.
“Oh my God.”  The hand slipped from Sherlock’s shoulder.  Rubbing his hand across his mouth, Sherlock stumbled upright.  John was staring back in the direction of the crowd.  The weathered lines of his face had deepened into grooves of pain.  “I’m so sorry, Sherlock.”
Sherlock swallowed and strove for a calm tone.  “You don’t have any use for it.”
“Right.”  John was suddenly exhausted, as if a boulder had rolled over him, crushing him with its immense weight, suffocating him with dust and grit.  He wanted to be left alone.  He wanted to sleep.  He wanted Sherlock at his side.
Again, a nod.  John’s mouth is so, so gentle, feathering at his neck, the corner of his mouth, his nose, his lips.  It is all very chaste – without a trace of their usual hunger – but Sherlock is still trembling when John pulls away.  “Can I stay?”
The next morning, John gave voice to a question that had been buzzing around his mind like a wayward gnat, too darting and clever to be squashed.  Walking into the sitting room from the kitchen with two steaming cups of tea, John paused, arrested by the sight of him.  Sherlock was curled in his armchair, laptop perched on his knees.  His dressing gown clung to his newly-showered skin, accentuating every sensuous curve and jutting angle.  John was beset by an urge to set down the tea, take Sherlock’s face in his hands, and kiss him long and deep.  He wanted to lick the column of that pale throat, see if he could taste a trace of the sweat that had beaded there the night before.
John exhales in a rush, ducking his head and spreading his arms in a helpless gesture.  “I’m going out again.  Got some new clothes.  Do you—well, what do you think?”
Until Violet fails to meet Sherlock at the appointed route.
“In here,” interjected Sherlock.
Sherlock is discharged from hospital later that day.  With the case closed and Oldacre in custody, Sherlock and John roam the misty streets of Inverness, hands clasped as their footsteps fall quiet against the pavement.  Between the breaths of a city at work and over the gentle murmur of the River Ness, John tells tales of ghosts startling mute girls to speech, of water horses luring peasants into the deep places of the lochs, of priests and kings.  Sherlock listens, spellbound.
John snickers, unbothered.  “D’you know, I’ve never had oysters?”
“Yes…?”
“Sherlock?  You in there?”
Lost in thought, Sherlock stumbles over his own stiff feet.  John halts, his arm tightening around Sherlock, fingers gripping the bannister.  When the moment of imbalance passes, they continue their trek.  Sherlock hates how frail he is, but he has no choice but to cling and be carried.  His hands are still numb, fingers clumsy and frostnipped.
Sherlock lapses into silence.  He had been the one to suggest a winter wedding, and though John had agreed without question, he must have had an inkling.  Sherlock’s reasons had been pitifully transparent.  The first, of course, being that he and John had met on January thirty-first.  It seemed only fitting that they be wed on the anniversary of that day – a day of life-changing promise.  If Sherlock were the fanciful sort, he might call such a day
“Are you awake?”
Two truths exist in every Sherlock fanfiction:
“But why would they need to do that?” asked John.  “The people tracking them are using the GPS signal to find them.  They can’t see the legs until they get there.”
This story takes place after the events of The Abominable Bride - i.e. Series 4 does not exist.  There may be references here and there, but those are intended more as homages than direct references to the plot series 4 follows.
Good God…”
“Aside from the drinking and danger, I mean.  Clearly it’s a family trait.”
“This can’t—“ The sofa creaked as he stood, shoving the laptop away so that it clattered against the coffee table.  “This isn’t—This isn’t
“Sherlock!”  John’s voice is high and thin.  “Sherlock, what the hell—”
“Lestrade,” he says, shaking the proffered hand.  He positively beams as Sherlock steps forward, looking somewhat like an eager puppy.  “Mr. Holmes.  A pleasure, as always.”
John scanned the street signs and rounded a corner, passing underneath a low, brick skyway.  The street opened into a courtyard encircled by grungy brick facades.  To his right, a vividly blue door came into view.  A large window stood beside it, dark beyond the open blinds.  As John peered inside, he made out the murky shapes of furniture and knick-knacks crowding shelves.  Beyond that, a square outline of light gleamed through the dimness.  He stepped back and tilted his chin; a grey sign hung above door and window.
“Just…”  John took a step back, shook his head.  “Just let me talk to her.  Alone.”
now, but nightmares were still his closest bedfellows.  His cries were always muffled, but Sherlock heard them.
Sherlock hums but otherwise makes no comment.  He despises banal conversation, and the weather is the most banal topic one can conceive.  His mobile buzzes again, and he fishes it out to glance at the screen.  A text from John.  He shoves the mobile back into his pocket.
“Whatever her reasoning,” said Sherlock, “we have to prioritize Rosamund’s safety until we’ve dealt with Mary.”
And then he is gone, the door between their rooms closing with a
“’Course,” the young man said.  After giving Sherlock an assessing look, he said, “Name’s Joe.”
John grabs the towel and offers it to Sherlock without a word – practically shoves it at him.  Face burning with shame, Sherlock accepts the towel and scrubs off the dripping bathwater.  The chilly air raises his skin in gooseflesh.
Sherlock shifts from foot to foot, skewing his gaze to a far corner of the room.  “I only saw the one.”
Before they became a couple, Sherlock made a point of deriding John’s more romantic tendencies.  The derision had been a natural reaction – nausea – to the poems, the holidays in New Zealand, the circus dates.
Mrs. Hudson understood.  She darted across the room to the nurse’s sink and rifled through the cupboards.  She found a paper cup, filled it with water from the tap, and brought it to John.  Cold to the point of pain: he drank until he could feel a headache building behind his eyes.  He set the cup down with a sigh.
Sherlock returns the bag to Ferguson’s care.  The moment the DI is waylaid by an officer with some sort of report, Sherlock slinks off toward the house.  He doesn’t spare a glance at the charred spot in the grass where the corpse once lay – not the corpse of Oldacre at all.  Possibly not even human.  He can wait to see forensics’ verdict, but for now…
Sherlock shook his head, trying not to lick his lips.  The summer sun beat down just as hot and muggy in Faerie as it had in the human world, and he was parched.
“Oh,” Mr. Holmes shrugs, as if we are discussing the weather, “she was many things.  Assassin, super-agent, nurse, cat lover… the list goes on.”  He pauses and looks to John. “May I?”
John glowered at the female mazikeen, who blinked blearily back.  “This is my sister, Harriet.”
“Put the wind up everybody,” said Sebastian.  “We hated him, and that wasn’t even the
“I do have other things on right now,” said Sherlock, gesturing around the flat. “My home’s just been blown up.”
I have to shower before we go out.  Patient vomited on my shoes.  I cleaned them but I can’t get rid of the smell.  Somehow think it got all the way into my hair.  Is that mad?
“Get out,” he says.  “Get out. I don’t want you here right now.”
“Three times,” Greg marvels.  He claps John on the shoulder.  “Well done, mate.”
he reminded himself.
“Will you?  Marry me, I mean?”
), John is as finely tuned to Sherlock’s emotions as a spider is to the vibrations in its web.  The faintest tremor is enough to tip him off.
They part, resting foreheads together.  “I want to take care of you,” Sherlock murmurs.
“The Morcar Museum is hosting a gala to celebrate its grand opening,” said Mycroft.  “There are many priceless pieces on display, one of which is a chair of the Mazarin Collection.  You will see it today, if you’re industrious.”
Sherlock rolls his eyes and tries to coax John into a third kiss, mind already casting about for alternatives – bolt holes, someplace deserted, out of sight. But John is resolute, cold hands slipping from Sherlock’s neck.  “I really have got to go.”
John is silent for a moment.  Then, sighing, he says, “Yeah.  Me, too.  I’ll—I’ll check on you, in a bit.  Make sure you aren’t asleep in the bath.”
“I’ve had practice,” said Alexander.  The following pause was scarcely longer than a heartbeat.  “I had my own, actually.  Once.”
“You can’t want to be here,” Sherlock said.  “It was rash to kill him before you knew where your coat was, but I can help you—”
“I phoned a taxi.  I’m sick of Lestrade’s toadies pestering me.”
Rosie appears in the doorway moments later, looking wary.  Probably she suspects John wants her to try the braised beef again.  “Daddy?”
“What?”
John chuckled.  “Christ.”  But his hand tightened; Sherlock sighed as pleasure thumped through his veins.  John shifted closer and kissed him, chastely.  Sherlock drew away and scowled.
“I’m sorry, mate,” said Lestrade in an undertone.  “But it would help if you could confirm the victim’s identity.  The face…”  He grimaced.  “It’s not in good shape.  He didn’t drown – he was murdered, and the killer wasn’t quick about it.”
“Hello, Mr. Watson,” said Alexander, limping forward to offer a hand.
Mycroft was silent for a long moment.  Tension was slashed into every line of his body.  Then, nostrils flaring, he said, “I see.”
“Sherlock.”
The killer is implacable, but Sherlock sees Catherine dig in her heels.  Pitiful effort though it may be, it slows their progress long enough for Sherlock to catch up.  Squaring his stance and clasping his injured arm to his chest, mobile in hand, he whips out a vicious left jab.  The blow strikes the killer’s ribs and rings up Sherlock’s arm with the impact.  He may as well have punched a brick wall.
“It can wait,” said Sherlock.  Was John imagining the fear that flashed through those silver-green eyes?  “You know how lawyers are.  Everything has to be just so.  She’ll throw a fit if I’m late.”
“Sherlock, please.”
“I think she loves Rosie,” said John.  “It’s the most fucked-up kind of love a parent can have for their child, but it
“Got something interesting to show you,” said Craig offhandedly.  “Think you’ll like it.  Tobes, c’mere.”
And then the cold, dark waters envelope him, sucking at the cinderblocks tied to his feet and punching the breath from his lungs with a convulsive gasp.  Water fills his mouth and nose, closes over his head, foul and icy.  He wriggles frantically, but the cords were tied with care, and his hands are cinched so tightly behind his back his elbows almost touch.  As he feels the blocks tied to his feet settle in the muck, twisting his ankles, he tries to muster a scrap of rationality.  Fails.
“Would you be amenable to giving me one of Harry’s teeth?”
Sherlock’s hackles rose.  “Then why…”
John’s mind betrays him, flitting from
Forgot to ask.  Why Onima? Bit above our usual fare.  –SH
Last time, he had been too slow, too stupid.  He had failed, and Lucy had paid with her life.
he can glean nothing.
“What the hell was that?” he said.
John blinked.  “I never told you that.”
“This YouTube channel is a treasure trove of knowledge, John.  This zookeeper on the tiger video is very knowledgeable about bloodsicles.  She probably picked up a knack for it when she worked on her father’s hog farm.”
Confusion shades across John’s face.  “What, for going after Oldacre without backup?  For starting a bloody fire when you could’ve talked to Ferguson instead?”
At last, the cab turned onto Baker Street and stopped outside the flat.  Sherlock slipped out and John followed, desperate to see his daughter, to hold her and keep her safe.  They ran up the stairs, unbolted the door, and hurried inside.
Lucy paused in leading them through the kitchen and turned on Sherlock with a perplexed look.  When he swept a hand around the room, she nodded.  She didn’t need to use words; the look on her face was eloquent enough.
Sherlock took the seat opposite of Mycroft and watched his brother with simmering panic.  A memory bloomed behind his eyes:  cracks spreading over glass, Lady Smallwood pitching forward, blood pouring from her temple.
“Come on, John,” he says.  “Let’s solve this.”
“And you’re an adrenaline junkie.”
Then John’s eyes flash open and he pries one hand from the bedclothes to seize Sherlock’s wrist, pin it to the mattress above his head.  Sherlock whines, thwarted, and John tightens his grip.  Pleasure spikes hot and electric down Sherlock’s spine.  He feels a plea build in his chest, climb up his throat – and John kisses him, hard, swallowing the sound.
Violet’s shoulders slump.  Her veneer of courage crumbles, leaving raw fear in its place.  She says nothing, but dutifully writes down her mobile number, collects her helmet, and leaves.
“Enough of this,” said Eirene.  She stood, dislodging Sherlock from her lap like she might drop a doll after playing with it.  She took one of his wrists and led him away from the circle.  “He can decide if he wants to stay here or go back.”  To Sherlock, “Come along, sweetling.  I would show you your new home.”
Sherlock shifts in his seat, leans forward – and stops, feeling Rosie’s last gift jostle on his lap.  He stands with an apologetic smile and crosses the room, offering the box to her.
Anderson waved off her words and smiled at her in a pitying sort of way. “Well,
“Sherlock,” he says, a little frantically, “I want… I want—”
“A colder, cleaner drink you will never find,” she said.  “Would you like some?”
This is, quite frankly, becoming ridiculous.
Nestled in the back of a patrol car speeding southward, Sherlock and John lapse into exhausted silence.  There’s a weight in the air between them, as if something has been left unsaid – stifling and heady, like woodsmoke filling a flue.  As the world outside grows louder, the streets brighter and busier, the pavement bloated with people strolling beneath winking fairy lights, the atmosphere in the car grows… heavier.  Quieter.
never said she was my girlfriend,” John points out.  “You assumed she was.  I just didn’t correct you.”
“Sherlock.”  John needed a moment to process what had just happened.  The past week had been a flurry of small gestures, soft and sweet and always surprising.  Cups of tea arriving at his side unasked.  Pain pills and glasses of water at all the appointed times.  Baked goods in paper bags with the tops crumbled shut:  croissants, cheese toasties, and once, memorably, a bacon and spinach quiche.  John slipped his hand over Sherlock’s.  “That’s… thank you.”
He put the sensation of John’s fingers on his scalp in the Mind Palace box with all the other little details.  The box he often contemplated binning, though he always found an excuse to keep it around. It had grown bigger, edging irrelevant facts out of the Mind Palace to make space for itself: the Queen of England, the Prime Minister.
There was a shadow in Sherlock’s eyes as he looked up at John.  “Yes.”
“Yes,” said John.  “The one where if you simulate a loss of support…”
“’Kay,” Rosie mumbles.  If she’s seen anything, it wasn’t enough to rattle her.
“I’ll leave you to it,” said the PA, beaming.
“Well,” says Lestrade, churlish, “I hope you’re having a delightful time, because nobody else is.”
“Be more specific.”
“He’s quite special, you know,” said the puppeteer.  “You don’t find many redcap mongrels wandering about.  So special, and yet…”  John’s hand moved, infinitesimally, and the point of the blade sunk into the pale flesh at his jaw.  A bead of blood welled, streamed in a rivulet down his neck.  The collar of his shirt darkened to crimson.  “So… fragile.”
John slips into slumber.  It is a brief respite, cut short by the arrival of the cab.  But while it lasts, it is deep and dreamless and warm.
John notes the violin and smiles.  “Come to play us a song?”
John chuckles.  “That he is.”
another time, ten other times, a hundred other times.  A sudden surge of affection blooms in his chest, buoying him to even greater heights.
a detective.”
“And what?” John asks.  The weirdness of the situation is beginning to sink into him.
“I k-killed her mother, Sherlock.”  Each word followed in a torrent of shame, a need to admit to his sins even though he could never absolve himself.  “Mary was a monster, yes, and she might have killed her.  But that doesn’t change the fact that I m-murdered Rosie’s mother.  I shot her.  I shot her
a bit of a perfectionist.  As you can see.” He swept a hand toward the teapot display.  “I can’t believe she’d up and leave them, but…” Again, a shrug, eloquent beyond words.
“Hadn’t Mycroft already done a background check on Alexander?”
Eirene’s answering smile was cold.  “We are Tylwyth Teg.  She is Unseelie.”
“John,” he began, but too late – the oval of scar tissue emerged, silvery in the dim light.  John could only stare.  Strange, how such a small thing had almost ended Sherlock’s life.
“I thought as much.”
“Goodnight, John,” said Sherlock.
of his pulse in his ears is a soundless cry.  A plea.
Sherlock shakes his head, feeling sick.  “I didn’t want this.”
“Right.”  Sherlock strode forward and ran his hands down Wiggins’ body.  A switchblade was stowed in the pocket of his hoodie, no doubt forgotten in the fog of pain.  “Now talk.  And if you give us any trouble, do be aware that the Met is waiting just downstairs.  You’ve got enough on you without this,” holding up the knife, “to be taken in.”
John laughed without mirth.  “Even when you hurt me, you were saving me.  Can’t say the same for myself.  Even when we…”  His voice cracked.  “Even when we were together, when I had you, I.  I fucked it up.  I was selfish.  I’m a doctor, and I didn’t think for a second to be careful with you.”
“I’m thinking this is more than a little bit odd.”
They sit in companionable silence for a few minutes, Sherlock testing notes on the violin and Rosie gulping her milk down to the dregs.  Just when Sherlock is about to give up and commence a sulk of epic proportions, Rosie says, “Can I hold your violin?”
With methodical precision, Sherlock squeezes another drop of resuspended Coumadin onto the petri dish.  His other hand is strained, knuckles white, around the focus dial.  Keeping himself in check.
They arrive at the Great Tower and find a door unbolted – Peter’s doing, no doubt.  A hollow creak precedes them as they cross the threshold and find the nearest flight of stairs.  The stairwells, in typical castle fashion, are tight and spiraling, each step narrow and sloped in the middle from the thousands and thousands of feet that have trod the same path.  Bars of sunlight and icy gasps of wind gutter through arrow slits in the stonework.  A rope slumps along the wall in place of a hand railing.  Their steps fall into a quiet, methodical rhythm as they climb.
Sherlock blinks.  He’s genuinely caught off-guard.  “What?”
John, Sherlock, and Mrs. Hudson watch me for a moment of silence.  Then John smirks at Sherlock.
Lestrade’s mouth flattened into a firm line.  “No,” he said, “he’s your friend.”
Mary’s hands skated up the buttons of John’s shirt as she slowly walked backward, drawing him out of Rosie’s room.  She smiled, head cocked to one side – and John’s memories rose up a second time.
I'm Zingiberis on Tumblr.
Another nod.  Sherlock tries to muster a soothing word, but his throat is sandpaper, his tongue leather.
.”  He enunciated the phrase with relish.  Aside from the initial surprise, Alexander’s face betrayed nothing.
Sherlock is silent for a moment, mouth flattened into a line.  Then he steps forward and lays gentle fingertips on John’s shoulder.
“How much did you remove?” Sherlock demands.
knows
he sent back.
John twists his wrist and pulls Sherlock in until he swears he can feel his tip brush the back of John’s throat.  The thought startles a keening cry from him.  Still John sucks, bobbing his head, twisting his wrist, kneading Sherlock’s arse.  Sparks dance through Sherlock’s nerves, coalescing in a radiant burst low in his groin, heat and pressure building fast.
Sherlock could see that John was still annoyed, but he shook off his confusion and followed.  Whispers of the Met tailed them as they passed.
He clamps his teeth down on the words and assumes a mask of nonchalance.
“Well-spotted.”
Standing, John slips out the door, leaving Sherlock in such a state of despair and arousal he thinks he might actually expire on the spot.  John returns with the promised glass and pills in hand.  His cheerful malice brooks no argument, and Sherlock chases the medicine with a gulp of water.  He sets the glass aside and crosses his arms with the most vicious glare he can muster.
John was discharged from hospital at the end of the second week, free to leave but bound to a long road of medication and physiotherapy and probably a session or ten of therapy.  He sat in the waiting room, meandering through chapter two of
“I do,” Sherlock says without hesitation.  “I… I have for a long time.”
“That’s funny,” said John.  “You’re funny, aren’t you?  You’re not exactly qualified to lecture me on addiction.”
Mrs. Hudson sighed in defeat.  “Fine.  But if you make a nuisance of yourself—”
And there:  Donovan stands amidst a cluster of officers, barking orders and gesturing.  On the ground beside the skip, an officer crouches, adjusting his camera to take a picture of Lucy’s face.  A flash, and Sherlock looks away.  He doesn’t want to know how she was killed, how the days and hours and minutes and seconds leading to her death were spent.  The thought makes his knees shake.
Sherlock utters something between a wheeze and a chuckle.  He’s distantly aware of sirens clanging and lights flashing on the periphery of his vision.  Kneeling beside him, John drops his hand to Sherlock’s, squeezing tightly.
John grunted and dropped his chin, one hand pressing the back of the stuffed rabbit strapped to his chest.  Sherlock blinked, startled, and damned himself for a blind fool.  He had been so distracted by
Wiggins said.
“He’s my husband,” says Sherlock, proud as can be.  “And you’ve got it wrong, actually.  My name is Sherlock Watson-Holmes.”
A memory unspooled in John’s mind:  Alexander standing on the hangar floor, pleading with Mary.  Helpless with love for her, he had been willing to trade anything for her presence in his life again.  Had been willing to forgive her.
“My brother.”
“You’re careful,” Sherlock says, already reaching for his bedside table, for the tube in the top drawer.  “You used condoms every time, and I know
“But this isn’t about us,” says John.  “It’s about Violet.”
Few things fail to bore Sherlock, given time and repetition.  Boredom is anathema.  It drives him to stalk serial killers and shoot walls as his mind judders and splinters apart like an intricate clockwork with a pebble caught in the gears.  A stoppered cannon with a lit fuse and a belly full of ammunition.  A sparker failing to ignite as propane billows from the canister.
Undeterred, Sherlock sets nimble fingers to the buttons of John’s shirt.  It’s ridiculous, really – no man should go to bed in his work clothes.  But John had, because Sherlock had needed him and there was no time to change.  The thought makes Sherlock’s heart stutter.
Sherlock understands.  “After Mary.”
The victim’s image through the magnifier blurs as Sherlock’s hands shake, recalling the feel of John’s ribs expanding and contracting as he gasped and panted.  His every step is stilted and tense, knees quaking with the remembered weight of John’s thighs straddled over them.  In fact, Sherlock has been beset by countless little onslaughts.  His heart hammers.  His chest tightens.  His mouth dries.  It makes the Work nigh on impossible.
John wants to take Sherlock out on a date.
“Hurry,” Sherlock gasped, and winced.
Mary’s lips moved against John’s neck and a jolt ran from the base of his feet to the top of his head.  “I want…”
idleness.
“Ye-es,” John sighs, “because Mrs. Hudson caught me texting her and wouldn’t let the bloody matter drop.  Like a dog with a bone.”
“Um.  Thank you.”
If John or Sherlock have ever looked at one another and thought the latter, Greg will swallow his ID badge whole.  It’s a bit sad, considering everything they’ve been through, but there it is.
“He could sense them,” Sebastian cut in, with the intrusive doggedness of one who is usually the center of attention.
John had been powerless to stop Mary from shooting Sherlock a second time.  He’d stood by, useless,
John knew then that he would do anything for Rosie.  He would do the noble thing, the good thing.  He would be the good husband and the good father.
John draws back with a sharp breath.  Sherlock opens his eyes, finds John staring down at him.  Sorrow is etched into the careworn lines of his face.
“We don’t have to, of course,” John says, stumbling headlong into excuses.  “We can carry on as we have been.  I’m fine with the way we—I love the way we are, really.  And I know I’ve—I’ve cocked it up before.  Marriage.  But if…” He pauses and squares his shoulders, raises his chin.  His eyes burn with love and courage and just a little bit of fear.  “Sherlock, you are the most incredible man I’ve ever known. You are brilliant and beautiful and… the most human human being I’ve ever known, and if you—”
John hummed, sweeping his gaze across the table.  His attention snagged on a used syringe.  “Yeah, you might have a point, there.  The whole lot isn’t really your area.”
Sherlock held onto John like a lifeline.  “She killed you, John!  She sh-shot you and made me watch while you bled out—”
A muscle jumped in John’s jaw and he shook his head.  “I… I don’t know.”
“God,” John mutters.  “She can be so maddening.  I know being excited on Christmas is normal, but this…”
“Your Rose came to John under the guise of Mary Morstan,” said Sherlock.  John looked at him, touched by his haste to defend him.  “She was a nurse at John’s clinic, and she was the first to approach with romantic intentions.”
Mycroft shot John a chilling look, but John only blinked.  “Am I wrong?”
The mazikeen cocked its head and said, in a distinctly female voice, “Hullo.”
Lestrade huffed. "Fine."
John smirked. “Hurt?” He asked.
“Rosie!” Greg exclaimed. He hugged Rosie and Mycroft even smiled at her.
Sherlock nodded. He was going to say something about an case gone wrong when John piped in.
John nodded and rested his hands on Sherlock’s arse. “Does it hurt here?” He asked.
Sherlock blushed deeper. He was certain his face was a scarlet red. He smiled up at John, trying his best not to look foolish. John smiled back and took Sherlock in his arms. Sherlock nuzzled closer to him. He buried his face in John’s chest. “Are you going to sleep, Captain?” he asked.
Sherlock decided to let the other man have his wish and thrusted. John moaned and clawed at Sherlock’s back when he thrusted again. John’s moans urged Sherlock on and he thrusted into John again. His cock pounded against John’s throbbing prostate and they each moaned as heat radiated of off their hot bodies.
John looked down at his watch and nodded. “Indeed,” he said. He stood, as did the other men. They paraded into the kitchen.
John squeezed his hand and Sherlock moaned as the pressure around his cock increased but then ceased as John relaxed his hand. John was making sure to make Sherlock suffer. He loved having Sherlock as his own but also made sure Sherlock was enjoying it too.
Sherlock’s head jerked backwards. He moaned and shut his eyes so they wouldn’t pop out in pleasure. He bit his lip as John’s hand traveled down his body. It stopped at Sherlock’s hip. John’s other hand drifted down Sherlock’s body and stopped on his other side. John had complete dominance.
John slowly entered, inch by inch. It was almost enough to make Sherlock scream. Sherlock begged him to speed up. He banged his heels on John’s back but he did nothing to work up his pace.
Sherlock looked at the table where John had walked to. He'd probably given up on Sherlock. The detective wasn't about to let that get away from him.
Sherlock’s back arched again as John thrusted. “
John leaned down when he felt something sticky on his stomach. He looked down at the white splat of semen on his stomach. “Sherlock? Did you...?” he asked.
Tim looked down at his watch then gasped. “Is this the actual time?” he asked. Rosie nodded. “I’ve got to go then,” he said.
nodded. “Oh yes. I will. You’ll be hurting for weeks,” He threatened, thrusting again. His thrusts were powerful and hard.
Sherlock moaned and shook. John’s erection pulsed inside him. He could feel his orgasm building up. He was close. It would only take a few more thrusts from John to make Sherlock come. Sherlock leaned over to moan in John’s ear. “Make me come, John. Make me come,” He said.
John nodded. "So, while we're waiting, might as well catch up," he said. Sherlock looked at him. "Go on. What have you been up to?" he asked.
Sherlock smirked and arched his eyebrow. “Enough to fuck me?” He tempted.
"And why did she want to separate, Mike?" Sherlock asked.
”What?” John asked curiously.
John pulled away and licked at his upper lip. He smirked as he watched Sherlock try to control his breathing. "What is it, the coat or the gloves?" he asked.
Sherlock shuddered as John ran a finger down his neck. He slowly began unbuttoning the detective's shirt, slowly, as if he wanted to see how long he could go until Sherlock snapped.
“Very good,” Sherlock said.
The cabbie was a young man. He had short hair with eyes that looked deep enough to dive in. Sherlock wanted to drown in them but not the way he wanted to in his. He wanted to drown and never float back up.
Mike sighed in relief, eyes obviously softening at this statement.
Sherlock followed his husband back into the bathroom and rested his head on John’s shoulder from behind. “Hamish?” John asked. Sherlock nodded. John mock pouted. “Sorry, Love. He’s a little kid. He’s excited,” he explained.
enough to fuck you,” He said. His voice was a deep, arousing growl.
"Your laptop."
John smirked. “Well, it’s good to know I can make you come twice. Even on our first time,” he said.
The room was smaller than Sherlock’s. John’s bed was somewhat small but the covers were neat and folded, making it seem bigger. The bookcase wasn’t cluttered or dusty. It seemed new.
He thrusted again and felt John’s cock twitch underneath his restricting pants. Sherlock rolled into him again and John squirmed out of his grasp. Sherlock moaned as John squeezed his arse. John pulled him close and locked Sherlock’s lips. Sherlock felt a rush of arousal course through him as John snaked his hands underneath Sherlock’s pants. He squeezed Sherlock’s arse again and Sherlock moaned. He arched into John and bit his lower lip.
A chorus of “Merry Christmas”s broke out as all the men responded.
Sherlock nodded. “
Sherlock sucked on his lip. “It feels good.”
John looked up at him. Sherlock's urge to kiss him rose as his adorably pink tongue darted out and wet his lip.
Lestrade looked at the knife, then at the body, then up at Sherlock. "Then who did this?" he demanded.
Sherlock was so involved in his own orgasm that he didn’t realize John had come too and pulled out. He moaned and exhaled heavily. He collapsed onto John and exhaled again. He caught his breath and gazed up at John. He kissed his cheek. “Jesus, John. That was fantastic,” He said.
John looked between the two of them in shock, disgust, and anger. “Rosie, get back inside before you catch a cold,” he ordered.
The first thing to come to Sherlock's mind was the thought of Greg somehow hearing his orgasm, despite his efforts to muffle it best he could. The next was the thought of how he would get back to Baker Street without anyone noticing his cum-stained pants. The final one came when he looked over at John. His mouth was set in an angry line, like he was going to discipline Sherlock. But then he saw the look in John's eyes. It was mischievous, dark, and predatory.
They caught one of the passing cabs. They sat and John waited for Sherlock's explanation. "Well?"
John’s mouth gaped open and his throat went dry. Sherlock stared at him, biting his lip and waiting for John’s reply. Finally, John managed to speak. “Yes. I will fuck you. I want to,” He said.
"Yes?" he asked. When Sherlock processed what he was looking at, everything stopped.
Greg looked between the two forms. "Yeah, go on," he said tiredly.
Sherlock found it especially difficult to write his name in his usual neat way when John's soft hand was gently stroking him.
Sherlock sat in Lestrade's chair. "I don't think you're guilty," he said.
John smirked and thrusted. “
John slipped a hand into Sherlock's trousers. He groped Sherlock through the fabric of his pants. Sherlock bit the inside of his cheek as he felt John's warm hand massage him. He tried to keep his breathing at a reasonable pace. He didn't want Greg to find them. Like this.
Sherlock smiled. "Thank you," he said. He pulled John away from the desk and whispered to him. "She's in Liverpool," he said.
“And you too, John.” Mycroft somehow managed to make a Christmas wish sound condescending.
John rammed his hips forwards, moaned out Sherlock’s name loud enough that the entirety of Speedy’s could hear, and filled Sherlock’s arse.
Sherlock arched his back and pushed his ass back as John thrusted. His nails dig into the wood of the table as he took his fucking. He could feel tears building up in his eyes as he neared orgasm. “Please, John,
Sherlock turned back to him. "Everton Hostel," he said, pulling his phone from his pocket and jabbing in the address. he showed a photo to John. He nodded and Sherlock stuffed his phone back in his coat."We'll wait outside and get them when they come out," Sherlock said.
Sherlock’s body was overwhelmed and he could sense he was going to come soon. He moaned and begged John to make him orgasm. “
“He cares about first impressions,” Greg added.
John smirked and thrusted into him again. He knew how close Sherlock was and wanted to feel him cum, wanted to feel him explode all over his legs. He thrusted into him and moaned. He bent down a hit before thrusting upwards.
Sherlock moaned out his answer. “Yes.”
?” John growled.
“Where’s Rosie?” Greg asked. He missed his niece.
him. Needed him desperately.
Sherlock soon decided that he had to experience the feeling of John’s pleasure for real and not just in his dreams. Only problem was, he could never seem to work it into a conversation. Whenever he was getting close to confessing his feelings for John, he was interrupted. So, when Sherlock saw his chance, he leapt for it.
Sherlock grabbed John’s hips roughly and spun him around. John’s stomach was up against his desk and he gripped at the sides. “Sherlock,” He moaned.
Sherlock looked at his friends. “Who would’ve done it?” Lestrade asked.
John loved when Sherlock swore. He knew then that he was doing everything right- everything spectacularly- when he swore.
Ah yes. The baby. The glue between John and Mary. The baby that Sherlock wished could've been with anyone other than John. His John.
Sherlock leaned back in his seat, new ideas already forming. "Thank you Mike. My colleagues will take care of you outside," he said.
Sherlock stood. “Four,” he said. He looked at the distance from the building to the body. “Three,” he corrected.
took his time with John. He shifted inside him and savored in John’s agony. Sure it was evil but he loved the idea of having John yearn for him.
John heard a click from outside his door. He looked over and saw his doorknob slowly twisting open. He sat up and prepared for whatever was approaching.
When Lestrade arrived, Sherlock was in his seat, waiting. "Good morning," he said, standing. Lestrade had to do a double-take, making sure that the man he was seeing was the same heart-broken detective he'd seen only days ago. "Well?" Sherlock said. "Are you going to just stand there or tell me what it is that happened?"
"Sister?" John asked.
!” Sherlock moaned, throwing his head back. John thrusted again, harder this time. Sherlock moaned and cursed John’s name to the wind. John pounded into Sherlock mercilessly and didn’t stop.
It was after five minutes past John determined Rosie has been out for too long. He put on his coat, pecked Sherlock on the cheek, much to Mycroft’s disgust and Sherlock’s amusement, and went to fetch his daughter.
“She was a divorce lawyer,” Lestrade said.
John looked up at him, eyes suddenly wider than normal. "You- you've been... me?" he stammered.
Sherlock shook his head. “Never.”
“Goodnight Sherlock,” He said before closing his eyes and slipping into a deep sleep.
Sherlock smiled and turned to look at John. He was shaking Mycroft’s hand. “Merry Christmas, Mycroft,” John said.
Sherlock smirked. "Just a bit," he said. He stood and immediately froze as he saw the man at the cab across the street. He had graying blond hair with tan skin that had once tasted so divine. Sherlock watched as the man made his way across the street to the scene. He grinned at Sherlock. "Hey mate. Haven't seen you in ages," John said. Sherlock said nothing. John turned to Greg. "How are you? How's the daughter?" he asked.
John smirked. He kissed Sherlock’s temple. “It’s okay. I liked the Dr. Watson.”
But he didn’t let Sherlock stay dominant for long. He would always pin his hands back to the wall and grind against him. Their erections were each as hard and wet with precum. Sherlock’s moans made John’s prick stand up and he ground against the younger man.
Sherlock blushed and hid his face from John. He knew exactly what to say to make Sherlock become putty in his hands.
Sherlock smiled at his shaving cream covered face. “You needed a shave,” he teased. “The kisses were too scratchy.”
“How does this feel? Be honest,” John said.
"I remember that too," he muttered.
” Sherlock moaned.
"An infinite war," Sherlock said.
, fantastic,” Sherlock said in between pants.
John chuckled and kissed Sherlock’s neck. “Good boy. Now,” John said as he unzipped his trousers. “Dr. Watson is going to treat you until he sees that you are better.”
Greg laughed. “Mr. Lestrade. Mr. Holmes, please, or just Greg,” he said.
better,” He said. Sherlock moaned as John twisted his already red nipple. John thrusted simultaneously. His thrusts were powerful, full of lust and passion. Whenever he twisted Sherlock’s nipple, he got a shout in response. “
,” He groaned. Sherlock thrusted again, harder this time. John moaned and bit his lip. He laid his head down on the desk and scratched at the wood. His cock was throbbing and his throat was hot. “
John checked his watch. "Nearly ten," he said. Sherlock nodded. "God, I'm so bored," he complained. And then, he gave a little chuckle.
Sherlock let himself be guided to his room. John shoved him inside and locked the door behind them. Sherlock was pushed onto the bed and John loomed over him. John straddled him and ran a hand through his sandy hair.
”Good?” John asked. He stopped squeezing.
Sherlock missed those days. When he and John were joined by the hip. When absolutely nothing could come between them. When it was just the two of them against the world.
“May I?” John asked. He was taunting Sherlock, challenging him to refuse John’s love.
Sherlock nodded, eyes still closed and still sitting in Lestrade's desk chair. Apparently the two women had worked together but fallen out around the time of Mrs. Wayne's wedding.
Hamish took his cousin’s hand and led her to his room. “We’ll be playing soldiers,” Hamish said before pulling the door closed.
The two men sat in the back of a cab. Just like the good old days, Sherlock thought. He looked at John, starting at where his hands were in his lap and then working up to his eyes. They were a tempting brown, making Sherlock's mouth water. And John's hands hadn't helped either. They were positioned right over the zipper of his pants. It was as if he was showing Sherlock how easy it would be for him to strip and get off right there in front of him. Sherlock swallowed, banishing those thoughts. He didn't think of John stripping again until they arrived at the law firm.
you,” Sherlock begged.
Shrrlock moaned and shook with pleasure. The pound of John’s erection inside him made him ache and yearn for more of John. He moaned John’s name and bit at his own lower lip.
John turned the page in his new book. “Probably because you don’t relax,” He said without looking up.
“In the living room,” Rosie said.
John jotted this down. "I can visit and talk with her," he said.
John smirked. He thrusted and felt Sherlock’s muscles fight against him. He moaned and thrusted again. Sherlock’s body shook and his muscles pressed around John’s prick. John thrusted and thrusted, moaning and grunting.
John looked at the kitchen where his daughter was. “Well then, we’re just going to have to have a little talk then,” John said, rising from his chair.
John chuckled. “You love my scratchy kisses,” he said.
Sherlock stood up and was almost immediately seized by John. John took his hand and led him out of the office. He led Sherlock out of the station outside. He pushed Sherlock out on the sidewalk and hailed a cab. As the cab pulled up, John dragged Sherlock down to his mouth and whispered into his ear. "Just wait till we get back to Baker Street. Then, I'll teach you to follow orders," he said and pressed a kiss to Sherlock's earlobe, nibbling.
”Doctor John Watson,” Sherlock moaned.
John smirked and bit his lip. He adjusted himself behind Sherlock and grabbed the younger man’s hips. He slowly entered Sherlock and closed his eyes.
Greg walked back into his office to find Sherlock on his phone and John leaning back in his chair, arm outstretched to Sherlock's chair.
John's fingers pinched at the head of his cock, and Sherlock yipped. "Sorry," he said to Lestrade, who was staring up at him. "I poked myself with the pen."
"I've been thinking of you," he blurted.
John laughed. The detective had quite a clever tongue, and it never ceased to make him smile. “Well, let me fix that then,” John said and pulled Sherlock’s trousers and pants down to his ankles.
“Sherlock, Sherlock, I’m fine-“ John was interrupted when Sherlock’s lips met his. Sherlock kissed him passionately and pulled away. He was breathless and it appeared as if John was too.
“Sherlock," John said, leaning forward. Sherlock pulled away, head still in his hands. John sighed but moved closer. He rested a hand on Sherlock's knee. Sherlock didn't flinch. Despite the sadness and pain, he still wanted John so any contact was cherished. John's other hand pulled Sherlock to look at him. Sherlock sniffed, hoping he didn't look anymore pitiful than he felt. "Sherlock," John said, his voice soft, the way he used to speak after a kiss in their flat or in a cab. Sherlock loved that voice. "It's my fault. I missed you so much and Mary was just there so I tried to cope by being someone else," he explained.
Tim and Rosie looked at each other, trying to remember correctly. “Two months,” they said.
He did take a break though, eventually, but only to flip them around again. Now, John was back on top. He pinned Sherlock’s shoulders to the mattress and thrusted again. Sherlock moaned and cried out as John thrusted again. His cock was throbbing with how hard he was and he was ready to cum. John thrusted again and whispered into Sherlock’s ear. “I’m going to fuck you until you can’t walk,” He growled.
John looked up at Sherlock with disappointed eyes. “You were ten seconds too slow,” he said. “Down. Now, soldier, hurry,” he ordered.
John bit his lower lip before answering. “Strip, so I may examine you,” He said.
John groaned as he thrusted. Sherlock’s nails pierced his skin. His muscles strained against John’s cock. They tightened as John pushed in and slowly eased back to normal as John began to pull out. If he thrusted, Sherlock’s muscles would contract around him. The feel of Sherlock’s insides around him was by far the most sensual thing John had ever experienced.
John chuckled and pulled back, keeping his groin pressed up against Sherlock. “What do you want to do?” he asked.
Sherlock searched for the words to describe the euphoric feeling. “I feel hot and... Tight,” he said.
John’s heart froze as he saw Sherlock. Sherlock’s curls were hidden underneath a jockey helmet. A dark purple coat with golden buttons had replaced his shirt. White jockey pants covered around his legs. His tall, black boots shined in the dim light of John’s room.
Mycroft flashed Greg a proud smile, making Sherlock feel like he was in the Twilight Zone for a moment. His brother affectionate? Never.
“But, I have Mary,” John said.
,” John moaned.
“Exactly. It's a fake. They stabbed her and then took the real weapon and replaced it with this one. That's why it has her husband's prints on it," Sherlock said.
John squeezed Sherlock’s arse, harder this time. Sherlock’s plump skin felt good in his hands. He loved touching Sherlock. He loved grabbing his cock, feeling his bollocks, spanking his arse.
John nodded and flashed a smile, making Sherlock giggle. They kissed again before Sherlock pulled away. “You better stop kissing me, or else we’ll be late to our own party,” Sherlock said.
John sighed against Sherlock’s lips as he fully entered Sherlock. He gave a gentle pull on Sherlock’s curls, making him look up at him. “Good?”
Lily shoved him. “Let’s go eat,” she said. Hamish followed her to the kitchen.
"A bit of both," Sherlock admitted.
Sherlock frowned and broke his gaze from John’s. John stood up and took Sherlock’s chin in his hand, turning him to look at him. “It’s okay to be sensitive,” he said. “I like that you’re all sensitive.”
Her ring was clean. That was the first thing Sherlock noticed. He pulled it off her finger, observing the inside. It was clean too. This happened whenever she worked it off her finger, but only to shower and sleep. She never had an affair and neither had her husband, judging by her clothes. Her clothes were nice. Expensive, but at least a year old. That meant he treated her but only when they had extra money. Except for her jewelry. Even the clean ring had a diamond that could've broke most men. So he splurged on her.
Sherlock broke his eye contact with John as he replied. “I’ve managed for nearly two weeks by just the thought of you.”
Sherlock yelped at the tight squeeze of John’s fingers. “I want you to fuck me, Dr. Watson!” he spouted out without thinking. John released his arse, and Sherlock sighed. He rested his head down on the table. He looked up at John through the corner of his eye. “Sorry,” he said, barely a whisper.
Sherlock typed out a text to Lestrade. She's in Liverpool. John and I will go. -SH.
Sherlock looked down at his boyfriend’s hand as it slowly unzipped his trousers. He swallowed, his throat beginning to dry. His eyes flicked up to meet John's.
John obeyed and turned. Sherlock thrusted into him again and he bit his lip. His erection was bulging and nearly tearing through his red pants. Sherlock thrusted again and he moaned loudly.
Sherlock bit his lip. “I’d like you to spank me again,” he admitted.
“Oh, yes. John, John. Oh, mmm,” Sherlock’s moans rang in John’s ears and he bent his head down. He sucked on Sherlock’s nipple and listened to his cries. “Ooh, YES! Yes, John. Oh!”
Tim nodded. “Greg.”
Sherlock felt his halls grow heavy with seed and his stomach warm with his orgasm. He moaned and clawed at the wall. “
“Yes?”
Finally, she reached Tim’s gift. It was a small box. He unwrapped it excitedly. He pulled out the watch. It had the Scotland Yard logo in the background, behind the hands. He looked down at the watch then up at Rosie.
Sherlock felt his phone vibrate in his pocket. He pulled it out again and checked his message. He glared at the screen and then turned to glare at John. He was looking down at his own phone, smirking like a smug bastard.
John slowly pulled his finger out before pushing it back in. “You’re tight, love. Did your body forgot how I felt?” John asked as he pumped his finger slowly.
Hamish nodded, satisfied with his Papa’s answer and marched off to his room to gather his old toys. Hamish and his cousin enjoyed experimenting on anything they could find, and they had a full night to experiment.
Sherlock bit his lip. “Can you help me with that, Doctor?” He asked.
John snapped out of his gaze and grinned at Sherlock. “Yes, darling?”
Greg and Mycroft sat on the sofa. Greg was leaning into Mycroft, full and getting tired.
"May I take a look?" John asked suddenly. Sherlock nodded and stepped aside. John crouched down and looked. It then occurred to Sherlock that he hadn't spoken since John arrived.
“Oh, we’ve begun baby proofing the house,” John said.
Sherlock tugged at his robe’s sleeve, exposing his bicep. John looked down at his hands but his eyes eventually made their way back up to Sherlock’s body. His eyes were filled with lust and need as he looked over Sherlock’s exposed body. His hands fidgeted and Sherlock caught sight of his bulge.
221 B Baker Street. It was completely empty. Except for two men. One being Sherlock Holmes and the other being John Watson.
“You. Need. To. Be. Properly. Fucked,” John said, drawing out each word.
Sherlock thrusted once and John cried out. “Oh, Sherlock!”
“Is that all?" Sherlock asked, making sure not to sound too stuck up.
John gasped and moaned. He threw his head back. “
John finally came back with a tube of lube. “Have you been good while I was gone?” John asked. He saw that Sherlock had not moved. “Oh, you have,” he said. He set the lube on the table and roamed his hands down Sherlock’s back until they landed at his arse. He slowly massaged Sherlock’s full cheeks. “Is this good?” he asked.
John collapsed into his red chair and rested. He looked over at the other man and smirked. Sherlock’s small arse was a burning red from the pounds of John’s body and his back had love bites scattered across it. Sherlock was panting and John loved how his body heaved with each breath.
"20 Fenchurch Street," Sherlock said. The cabbie nodded and began the drive. Sherlock rode without another word.
John kissed his ear. “Say my
“He's innocent," Sherlock said.
Sherlock noticed how perfect John was. He looked as if he were a statue, perfect and sculpted. Sherlock gazed down at John’s pants, and slowly reached for them. He pulled them down slightly, revealing a patch of orange hair. Sherlock bit back a moan. John pulled his pants off and threw them behind him. They landed on the foot of the bed and fell to the floor.
John looked up at him. "Do you still do that? I'm sure it drives Mrs. Hudson mad," he said.
"She's with her sister," he said.
John gripped Sherlock’s hips. He shifted inside Sherlock and felt the man on top of him shudder. He took a moment for Sherlock to brace himself before thrusting.
John nodded. “Yes. We do have a case to solve, after all,” he joked.
,” He moaned. John sucked on Sherlock’s collarbone again. He sucked hard enough to leave a mark.
She’d gotten Mycroft a pair of socks with police cars on them to “remind him of his love”.
Hamish and Lily finished eating first. They raced right back to Hamish’s room to cause more mischief.
!” Sherlock moaned as John grabbed Sherlock’s cock.
“Do you like the fast way?” He taunted, thrusting again. Sherlock’s feet kicked John’s back and every impact sent a ravishing spark down John’s back and down his erection.
Sherlock’s loud moans and John’s primal grunts filled the room. Sherlock didn’t care if the floor below them could hear. All he cared about was that he could hear John, and John could hear him.
John smirked. “Good,” He growled. “Then I’ll come deep inside then,” He said and thrusted. He felt his erection get heavy with semen. He thrusted again and, feeling Sherlock’s muscles contracting around him, came.
"Yeah," Greg said. He got up. "I've got to get them off the copier," he explained as he made his way around the desk.
John rolled his eyes, then turned again. "Should've taken me up on my offer earlier," he muttered then picked up another cylinder and moved it.
John decided to have mercy and pulled off his trousers. He pulled his jumper over his head and discarded it behind him. His red pants were the only thing keeping his erection hidden from Sherlock. He fingered the elastic around them, making his erection perk up in an attempt to escape.
John pulled out and moaned. His orgasm had been excellent and he had needed it so much.
John smirked and licked the shell of his ear. “Whatever way you like,” He said.
The first stroke made Sherlock shudder. He shivered in anticipation as John slowly set him up. John’s finger eased its way down Sherlock stiff erection. Sherlock moaned softly and threw his head back. He loved the feel of John‘s skin on his tense cock. It was an electrifying and arousing feeling.
John kissed Sherlock’s neck. He sucked on Sherlock’s neck, careful not to suck too hard. He didn’t want to harm Sherlock and his sensitive skin.
"Yes it is. It was laying right by her when he got here," Lestrade said defensively.
“Ms. Bertrand. Divorce lawyer for five years. And, old partner of Mrs. Wayne," Lestrade read from a file.
“Yeah. Yeah. I’ll fuck you hard. Fuck you so hard,” John moaned out as he pushed into Sherlock.
John rolled his eyes and gazed down at Sherlock. He licked his lips and kissed Sherlock’s chest. He made his way over to Sherlock’s nipple. He made sure it was the one he had yet to touch. The other was still red from the twisting and John wanted to even out the colors. He sucked on this nipple, licking around it and nibbling on the skin around it.
John stormed into the flat. He threw his coat at the wall, not even bothering to hang it up. He turned on Sherlock. “You bloody moron! I told you not to go in there! I told you to stay put or else you’d get yourself killed! But, you didn’t listen! Damn it, Sherlock, you could’ve died!” John shouted, pointing an accusing finger at the detective.
Sherlock crouched beside him, pulling his magnifying glass from his pocket. Indeed, the wounds were different sizes. Sherlock smiled at John, pocketing the glass. "Looks like your skills have sharpened since I last saw you," he said. John chuckled, and Sherlock had to contain the shudder that wanted to roll down his spine.
“I love you,” Sherlock whispered.
“She’s still upstairs primping,” John said. “She’s got a friend coming over.”
Sherlock nodded and winced as he stood back up. His arse was still red and his legs didn’t work. He crept along the wall and looked back at John. “Coming with me?” He flirted.
John rolled his eyes lovingly and kissed Sherlock’s chin. He stood, carefully so as not to fall, and pulled his trousers up. He grabbed his bag and helped Sherlock up. He linked his fingers with Sherlock’s and locked the door behind him. He was ready to collapse into bed, either his or Sherlock’s.
Sherlock gasped and almost went weak at the knees at just the thought of what John would do to him. "Oh god yes."
Sherlock and John sat beside the other couple. Their hands were laced together, and John’s thumb was slowly stroking Sherlock’s knuckles. Sherlock smiled and kissed John’s cheek.
Sherlock could practically hear the smirk in John’s voice. “What kind of fun?” he asked, throat nervously dry and tight.
Sherlock’s cock twitched in John’s hand as he turned. It was involuntary and Sherlock couldn’t fight it. He tried to stop it but his cock wiggled in John’s hand.
Sherlock picked up his violin. “Going to play for us, Love?” John said smiling. Sherlock only smiled back as he began to play “Jingle Bells”.
Sherlock moaned and his answer caught in his throat. “So fucking much, John. Oh, oh, yes, please John, yes, oh,
Sherlock moaned out a ragged “fuck” before reaching back and grabbing onto John. John pounded into him again and again. Sherlock’s grip on John tightened as his entire body jolted forwards. “Harder! Doctor, please!”
Sherlock blinked the tears away. He heard John’s belt fall to the floor. He looked back at John, who patted his lap. Sherlock shot him a look of confusion. John patted his lap again. Sherlock crawled over to him and John pulled him onto his lap. “You’re brilliant, Sherlock. Brilliant and gorgeous,” John said. Sherlock blushed. He avoided John’s eyes. John set his hand under Sherlock’s chin and pulled the man close. They met in a gentle embrace.
Rosie looked at Tim apologetically before disappearing inside the house.
Sherlock rolled his eyes. The excuses for acceptable cases on his website were all too boring and dull. He handed the laptop back to John and collapsed onto the sofa. “Bored,” He complained.
Sherlock grinned and sat back down. The doorbell rang as John took a seat again. “I’ll get it!” Rosie said. John set his jaw as the door opened.
John stroked Sherlock again, and felt the man shiver on top of him. “Ready, are we?” He asked. Sherlock nodded and bit his lip. John smirked and pressed up again. His covered erection begged to be released as it tingled in his pants.
"Yes," Sherlock whimpered. He really did. He wanted John's gloved fingers all over him.
John thrusted again and again, all the whole listening to Sherlock’s moans. Sherlock’s voice was thick and strangled as he moaned. John’s erection pounded against Sherlock’s throbbing prostate and he nipped at Sherlock’s skin. “You’re so delicious,” He said. “I could taste you all day. Every inch of you,” He growled seductively into Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock‘s cock twitched. The feel of John’s fingers on him was the greatest feeling he had ever experienced. “Captain, I- Shush. Soldiers don’t speak while their Captain is speaking,” John said. Sherlock closed his mouth. “Good soldier. Now, do you want to continue or would you rather do
John fidgeted and took in a breath. Sherlock’s outfit was tight, and the buttons in his shirt screamed in agony. John wanted nothing more than to tear his shirt off. He watched Sherlock bite his lip. It made John’s erection harden, yet he didn’t attempt to hide it.
“Lily!” Hamish said as he was tackled.
Rosie smiled and hugged him. “You’re welcome.”
Sherlock eventually joined John- after he threw a sock at him. He opened the trash bins and threw the frog legs he’d bought into them. “Won’t be needing those,” He muttered. He grabbed a torn piece of paper and turned. Unfortunately, he crashed into John and they fell into the wall.
Lestrade looked back up and rolled his eyes. His friends weren't exactly subtle when they had their little moments, but he couldn't blame them. They'd spent long enough having to pretend they didn't have moments like this. Now that they were together, they weren't about to pretend.
John stared at him in awe. "Fantastic," he muttered.
“Have any of you heard the doorbell?” she asked, turning to each of the men. They all shook their heads. She groaned and disappeared into the kitchen to calm herself.
Sherlock moaned as John hit him again. “So good.”
John listened to Sherlock’s moans and pleads but didn’t speed up at all. He slowly rolled his hips and Sherlock moaned. His hands clawed at the wall and his hips shuddered. John shifted inside him and sucked on Sherlock’s neck. “How much do you want me? Tell me, my dirty boy,” John growled.
Tim was a cute boy with full cheeks and light brown hair. It curled at the bottom of his ears. He wore a nice button down dress shirt with black trousers and a black jacket. He smiled at the four men around him. “Merry Christmas.”
John smiled, finally taking dominance, when Sherlock grabbed his shoulders and flipped them around. His hands pinned John’s shoulders to the ground and a quiet moan escaped his lips as Sherlock ground his hips. Sherlock grinned and kissed John’s cheek. He ground against John again until the man thrusted up.
,” He moaned. The touch on his bulge intensified and John moaned loudly. He was just about ready to tear Sherlock’s silly, little costume off of his thin body.
Mike sniffed and wiped his nose with his sleeve. "Mrs. Wayne and Lucy's lawyer didn't get along. They had an old feud or something. Every time we stepped in that courtroom, it was like an endless battle," he said.
.” His moans were shaky and  dripping with desire. Sherlock’s hands traveled from the headboard to John’s body. They wrapped around his neck.
Greg thought. Not bad at all compared to what he worried he'd walk in on.
Mike gulped, obviously not used to men like Sherlock. Sweat began to gather above his lips and his forehead became sweaty as well. "She felt we were drifting apart and that it would hurt our children more if we didn't split," he said.
John moaned as Sherlock shifted inside him. He thrusted once and John had to close his eyes in order to keep them bursting from their sockets in pleasure. Sherlock thrusted again and again, listening to John’s begs and moans. “
Cum covered his legs and the floor. He didn’t even notice how Sherlock kept thrusting until he came too. The wetness filled John and he panted as it filled inside him.
He was smirking at Sherlock, watching as he slowly teased his boyfriend. Sherlock's cheeks had reddened, and that made John even more eager to see just how far they could go without Lestrade noticing.
Semen covered John’s chest and legs. Sherlock moaned in relief and panted. Feeling Sherlock’s seed cover him, John came too and groaned in pleasure.
Mike nodded. "Yes," he said.
John smirked. The sound of Sherlock’s strangled moan sent an electrifying spark down to his already erect cock. He rotated his wrist before spanking Sherlock again.
Tim swallowed his potatoes. “We met in English class,” he said. “We also have science together.”
Sherlock whimpered out a pathetic "yes" and an even more pathetic "please".
“What do you plan on having as a career?” John asked.
“Yes.”
John moaned as Sherlock pressed his hands into John’s thighs. “I love you so much John,” Sherlock whispered into his ear. John moaned again as Sherlock kissed his neck. Sherlock nipped at his skin and used his tongue to draw circles into John’s neck. He pressed harder into John’s thighs and felt the man shift under his touch.
John fell asleep to the soft sound of his lover’s snores.
,” He moaned.
"But I think you know something," Sherlock said.
John nodded. He whimpered again as Sherlock rested his hand on his erection. He didn’t grab it, his hand just laid there. John sucked on his lip. “
Sherlock pondered this question for a moment. “If you’re talking about STDs, yes I am clean. Why do you-
Sherlock slowly settled himself on John’s erection. It pushed through his muscle and shifted inside him. He moaned softly and smirked down at John. “Giddy up, John,” He said.
“No. It’s probably just one of her friends from school. Most likely Rose or Emma,” John said.
“Yes. Um, I’d like to, um... I’d like you to make me cum,” Sherlock said.
"Yes."
Hamish was laughing. “Your face!” he howled.
Mike looked at him, unsure of what was happening. "Mr. Holmes, I am not guilty," he said quietly, afraid of the tall man.
221 B. It used to be his home. John's. But now, it was Sherlock's prison. There was no more John, and, because of that, no more Sherlock. Sherlock stood at the door, wishing John would just let the cab drive away so he could cry. But no. John waited beside him. He looked down at John and caught him staring. "John," he said.
There was the sound of tyres on pavement and Sherlock looked up, searching the street for the suspect. There she was. And with her sister. It was perfect. All they had to do was get her. And away from the feelings in the cafe.
John didn’t squeeze or shift his hand. He just let Sherlock twitch in his grip. “Say my name,” John said.
Two hours. Two hours Sherlock had been sitting there in front of his computer doing something. Most likely researching something, John thought. But Sherlock was ignoring him. For two hours John had been neglected! He didn't like it very much. He decided he was going to get Sherlock's attention back, one way or another.
Sherlock nodded and watched John’s hand glide up his body. It stopped between his nipples. Sherlock’s moan caught in his throat. His nipples just so happened to be his weak spot.
John abandoned Sherlock’s neck and wrapped his arms around the thin man. “Goodnight,” He said.
...” Sherlock moaned.
Sherlock turned to Greg. “Merry Christmas, Lestrade,” Sherlock said.
,” Sherlock moaned as John’s tongue encircled his tight muscle. It licked at the dark patch of hair at the base of his shaft.
John smirked. He thrusted again and licked the top of Sherlock’s spine.
Sherlock missed about every word John said. He was getting flashbacks from his last year in uni when he rented that video of a doctor who bent his patient over the table and proceeded to- TABLE.
“I love you too,” John whispered as sleep overcame him.
Mike tried to think of an excuse but looking up at Sherlock, lips trembling, he cried. "I loved Lucy. And our children. We were perfect. I- I don't understand," he cried.
The four men gathered together. “I don’t like him,” John said.
Every so often he would let Sherlock’s hands roam around his body, scratching his back or tugging on the back of his head. He moaned when Sherlock squeezed his arse and bit his lip when Sherlock sucked on his neck.
"I'm sorry boys, Ms. Bertrand is out right now," the secretary said.
“Nothing. I just remember wen you would yell that and shoot that damned smiley face,” John said.
John yanked Sherlock’s trousers down to his knees. He remembered Sherlock’s boots and pulled them off. Now, without any obstacles, John grabbed Sherlock’s trousers and pulled them off. He threw them behind him and slapped Sherlock’s arse. Sherlock yelped and John moaned. “God, I love you so much,” He said.
"How long were you married to Lucy?" Sherlock asked.
“Good. Come for me. Come in, Sherlock. Come for Dr. Watson,” John tumbled in Sherlock’s ear.
Sherlock shaved his chest hair- he liked being hairless, it made him feel clean- so his chest was a blank canvas. John kissed it as he finished off the last of Sherlock's buttons. Sherlock shivered. John smiled as he looked up at Sherlock. “Calm down, love. I’ve barely even started,” he said.
John growled and snapped his hips forward. His white coat swung as he thrusted. “God, I love you,” he said. “Love fucking your arse.” Sherlock moaned as John dug his fingers into his hair. “Love pulling your hair. Love hearing you moan.”
"I did."
Sherlock rolled his hips into John’s and listened to his soft moans. The red fabric of his pants was enticing yet humorous. Sherlock thrusted again and felt John’s erection bulging through his pants as he pounded into him. He loved listening to John’s moans. It meant he was doing everything right.
Sherlock moaned as John’s bulge pressed into his. He trailed his hands down his legs onto John’s neck. “Jesus, I want you so much,” He said, running his hands through John’s hair. He unbuttoned John’s shirt and began to pull it off.
he wondered to himself. He finished his name and went to work on the rest of the form. The suspect was male. He hadn't seen his hair because he was wearing a knit cap. He was tall, with a big frame. He looked to be about 200-250 pounds. Maybe 6 feet tall.
John smirked. He thrusted once and bit Sherlock’s lip. He slipped his tongue in between the gap in Sherlock’s mouth and let his tongue roam. He ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls. He pulled back again and thrusted. Sherlock moaned. His face reddened as his orgasm neared. John thrusted and growled in to Sherlock’s ear. “Is this what you wanted, Sherlock? For me to fuck you, thrust hard, and come deep inside you?”
Sherlock couldn't find his voice. "Yes," he somehow squeaked out.
“And?”
She came back down with her arms full of wrapped gifts. John rushed over to help her. So did Tim. They helped her carry the presents to the living room. Sherlock handed her each gift so she could pass them out. She’d gotten everyone a thoughtful gift, even Tim.
Sherlock’s fingers stopped as John sucked on his neck. He succumbed to John’s touch and moaned. John’s head fell back onto the pillow and Sherlock finished pulling John’s shirt off.
“Oh, what a shame,” John said. “Looks like you didn’t learn. Shall I punish you more?” John asked. Sherlock’s erratic heartbeat motivated him. He nodded.
John moaned when Sherlock slowly rose his hips up and dropped them down again. He tried to speed him up by thrusting but Sherlock’s hands kept him still. “Sherlock, please,” He begged.
John nodded. “Should I do it again?” He asked. He knew Sherlock’s answer and waited for the words to come from his mouth.
John nodded. “Come to my office and I’ll help you,” He said.
“And Merry Christmas to you too, Tim,” John said. Maybe he could get used to Tim being with Rosie. It was Christmas after all.
“Doctor,” Sherlock whimpered.
Rosie and Tim has taken John and Sherlock’s chairs. They were each sipping a cup of cocoa and sharing smiles.
The battle to undress each other continued as Sherlock unbuttoned John’s shirt and tossed it away and as John pulled Sherlock’s shirt over his head, buttons bursting.
Sherlock bounced once on the mattress. He stared up at John, who stood at the edge of the bed, eyeing Sherlock.
“Yes please, Dr. Watson,” Sherlock said, huffing in frustration. All he wanted was John and none of this teasing.
John chuckled as he continued to work his finger in and out of Sherlock. “I love you,” he said.
John nodded and shook Tim’s hand. “It’s nice to meet you too,” he said, trying to be as friendly as possible.
Sherlock leaned down and kissed John. He rolled his hips on John’s, feeling the man’s erection twitch underneath him.
“Honestly, Lestrade, we barely even saw him. We’ll be about as much help as Anderson is on his good days,” Sherlock scoffed. A glance from John made Sherlock frown and shut up. “Sorry,” he muttered, just loud enough for John to hear.
John nodded. He dropped Sherlock’s cock and Sherlock whimpered. “Oh no, don’t worry. I’ll be right back. I just have make sure the rest of you is okay,” He said.
John reached into his drawers and pulled out lube. He stroked himself and moaned. He sat in between Sherlock’s legs and rested Sherlock’s waist on his thighs. Sherlock’s legs wrapped around John’s waist.
John pulled his head away and admired the quivering mess he’d made of Sherlock. “Aww, too much?” he teased, voice rippling through Sherlock’s body down to his throbbing erection. “Do you want more?” John asked.
“I understand as well, and I’ll even cooperate,” Sherlock said.
"Why in the hell is she with her sister?" John asked.
Sherlock smirked. “Go ahead,” He said.
“Fantastic,” Sherlock said.
John chuckled and obliged. He took a hold of Sherlock’s curls, pulled his head over, and kissed him as he slid in.
” Sherlock begged.
. Sometimes John was stroking himself, moaning a certain detective’s name as he came. Sherlock soon began joining John in his dreams. John would dominate him, fuck him until Sherlock was trembling.
"Okay," Greg said, nodding. He turned to John. "I just need you two to fill out a witness form for me. Anything you saw or heard can be useful in this investigation," he said.
As if to prove Sherlock right, John’s tongue darted in and out of Sherlock’s opening. “I like danger,” John growled.
The baby. The words pierced Sherlock like a dagger. "Yes. The baby," Sherlock said, almost a hiss.
In one lightning quick move, John had Sherlock bent over his knee. Sherlock’s cock rubbed against the denim of John’s jeans, making him moan. He was sure he was slippery with precum. On any normal day, that would’ve been tremendously embarrassing but, that day, there seemed to be no barriers.
Sherlock took a heaving breath before looking down at John. He was kissing Sherlock’s chest and slowly making his way down to Sherlock’s cock. Sherlock urged him on by moving his body closer to John’s face. His erection stood in front of John’s face. John took the bait.
the fast way. This is just the slow way,” John smirked. He rocked back and forth slowly, still entering.
As John’s grunts grew more aggressive, his thrusts became more powerful and quick. Sherlock’s muscled ached as John’s erection pounded against his prostate. “Captain, don’t stop.
Sherlock frowned and pouted as he felt the weight of John vanish. He looked back and saw John walking down the hall.
John let his hand release Sherlock's sore testicle. "What? Don't make you cum here? In your pants? Right in front of Greg?" he asked, eyebrow arching as he spoke.
John smiled. "And don't think I'll never love you," he said. Sherlock nodded again. John's smile widened. "Goodnight, Sherlock," he said.
“Yeah,” John said. “What do you propose we do about it?” he asked.
Mycroft and Greg shared a knowing look. “A friend?” they asked.
Now, Sherlock was on top and John was bottom. John reached for the lube he knew Sherlock kept in his drawers and squirted some into his hands. He rubbed his hands up and down his hard shaft. He moaned at the touch and lathered himself up.
?” John asked, glancing down at Sherlock’s erection.
Rosie grinned and hugged each of them. “Thank you,” she said and skipped off.
Sherlock discreetly dabbed at his eyes as John hung up. He swallowed, trying to make his throat feel not as tight. "Did she give you permission to tag along?" he asked.
His boyfriend smiled and turned back to Lestrade. “Sherlock’s right,” he began. “We barely got a look at him.”
“What’s that?”
Sherlock’s hands trailed down his back and he bent down. Sherlock pulled John’s pants down and took his skin between his teeth. John yelped and then groaned as Sherlock stood back up and pushed his erection onto John’s arse. He went to turn but his leg tangled around Sherlock’s and they both plummeted to the ground.
John was trying not to stare at Sherlock. But he was so gorgeous and sexy that he couldn’t resist. Sherlock’s slender and pale body still had droplets on it from his shower and his curls hung around his face like a frame. He looked perfect and John couldn’t tear his eyes away.
John was wearing blue latex gloves, the kind he used to wear at the clinic. He had a white coat on, one that made him look like a doctor from Grey's Anatomy. He was glaring down at Sherlock. "How about you get up and come help me clean up that war zone you've made over there?" he said, pointing to the table where Sherlock kept his cylinders and chemicals.
Sherlock chuckled at his son and turned to meet his brother and brother-in-law. “Mycroft,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock gulped as he felt John’s trousers being pushed down. He was too impatient to wait. He desperately pushed back onto John’s cock, the only thing covering it was the thin layer of his pants.
The two men fell asleep, sticky and pleased with each other. John held Sherlock close as he drifted off.
“Multiple murders?” Anderson scoffed. “Listen To me, it was her husband. No doubt about it.”
“Where to?" the cabbie asked.
“One of Hamish’s toys,” she said, glaring down at her little brother.
Now, John decided to have the real fun. He smirked up at Sherlock and entered him slowly. Sherlock moaned and shook. John pulled out, then entered again. He stretched Sherlock and finally decided he was ready. He entered Sherlock and listened to his swears.
John scoffed and rolled his eyes but picked up the thin man anyways. He carried Sherlock to his bed and Sherlock curled up underneath the covers. John left briefly to clean up their mess but returned and hugged Sherlock.
“Hmm?”
John laughed at his husband and went in for a kiss, smearing the cream all over Sherlock’s cheek. “Oops. Looks like you’re getting a shave too,” he said, wiping the cream off.
John savored the feel of Sherlock on top of him. The man seemed to radiate heat. John thrusted into Sherlock and felt Sherlock’s muscles contract around him. He moaned into the ceiling. He thrusted again. Sherlock’s body surged forwards and then fell backwards. John thrusted again. Sherlock’s body did the same surge and fall. John loved how Sherlock's body rode his. He loved how Sherlock’s muscles squeezed when John pounded into him. He loved how Sherlock moaned and ran his hands through John’s sweaty hair. All of it was perfect.
Before he disappeared into their bedroom, John turned to look at him. “Stay,” he ordered. “I’ll be right back to deal with my favorite patient.” With that, John winked and left Sherlock to whimper at the thought of what John was getting.
The two teenagers must not have heard the door open because John caught them kissing. “Dad!” Rosie exclaimed, breaking away from Tim.
John raised his eyebrows. “Really?”
John’s eyes softened slightly as he heard Sherlock’s words. Sherlock worried he’d scared John off. He opened his mouth to apologize but was cut off by John’s lips. John pulled away and smirked. His eyes were filled with a dark passion that made Sherlock shiver. Sherlock felt the cold refrigerator’s surface chill his arms as John pressed him up against it.
John crossed his legs, most likely to conceal a growing erection, and Sherlock grinned. John was probably catching on that he knew about his erection and Sherlock decided to make it a bit more fun.
“Why did you kiss me?”
Mike nearly jumped at the sudden opening of the door. He turned to see Sherlock in the doorway. "Mr. Holmes, am I free to go?" he asked.
“What are you doing?” Sherlock asked.
Sherlock looked at the body. The wounds weren't deep but there were multiple, as if they'd stabbed her in a frenzy. "The knife," he said. "Where's the knife?"
John grabbed Sherlock’s hips. He held him still and- none too subtly- pushed up.
Greg nodded and went back to his computer, not suspicious of his friend.
Rosie nodded. “We were partners for an assignment in English class,” she explained.
"Yes," Mike said. "That's exactly right."
John nodded. “Do you want to be cured the fast way or the slow way?” He asked.
"It's obvious. Mrs. Wayne and Ms. Bertrand were partners and best friends. When Mrs. Wayne became too busy for work because of her wedding, Ms. Bertrand left. She started her own law firm, thinking she could beat Mrs. Wayne. She didn't and they became rivals. Things were particularly heated in this case because Ms. Bertrand's sister was friends with Lucy. When Lucy lost her children, Ms. Bertrand's sister killed the woman responsible: Mrs. Wayne. Ms. Bertrand knew this and took her sister to Liverpool. From there, they'll go to Wales, where Ms. Bertrand will help her sister start a new life," Sherlock said.
Sherlock and Mycroft looked at each other. “Boyfriend,” they hissed.
Sherlock pulled his belt from its loops. It fell to the ground with a clatter. He kicked off his shoes and yanked off his socks. He glanced over at John. He was watching the time on his watch. Sherlock gulped and pulled his trousers off. His shirt was a bit more challenging. He began to unbutton it but gave up and simply pulled it over his head. His curls bounced as his shirt slid over his head. His pants were an easier task. He kicked them off and looked back to John- ahem,
John, grasping Sherlock’s hips, kissed his cheek. His lips ventured down Sherlock’s neck to his collarbones. He sucked on one bone before licking a trail to the other. He took his time with Sherlock, making sure he was desperate for him before beginning.
Lestrade was waiting at the police station, cup of coffee in hand. He set it down and whipped out his handcuffs. "Thanks, Sherlock, John," he said. He marched the woman into the station, leaving Sherlock alone with john again.
“Didn’t you hear me? I said strip!” John ordered.
Sherlock moaned. “Good. Fantastic. Brilliant-
Sherlock could see John’s door. It was at the top of the stairs. There were only ten steps but it took Sherlock an eternity to reach the final one. He entered John’s room, observing his new surroundings.
John thrusted as Sherlock tugged at his trousers. Sherlock moaned and threw his head back, exposing his Adam’s apple. John kissed his neck and thrusted again. Sherlock moaned and looked back down at John’s trousers. They were halfway unzipped and his pants were partially visible. He pulled them all the way down and smirked at John’s massive bulge.
Sherlock could feel his ears heat up as he blushed. “...Yes,” he said.
John continued grinding his hips on Sherlock’s until he felt Sherlock’s erection nearly popping out of his trousers. He dropped one of Sherlock’s hands and began working on his trousers. They fell and Sherlock stepped out of them. His black briefs left his legs exposed and cold. John trailed one of his hands down Sherlock’s bare skin. Sherlock shivered and John let a hot breath warm up Sherlock’s ear. “Your room or mine?” He asked.
John waited for Sherlock’s answer. When he didn’t reply, John pinched his arse. “Excuse me?”
He felt a sharp jab of pain as he bit too hard. He tasted blood and cursed. “
Sherlock smirked and threw off his robe. “Then take me,” He said, collapsing onto John.
Tim looked over at him, licking his upper lip. “Yes sir?”
The last smack was too much for Sherlock and he cried out John’s title as he came. “
"The baby or this?" Sherlock asked.
John yanked Sherlock’s pants off and bit his lip as he saw Sherlock’s abnormally large erection. It was slender and long, just like the rest of his body. Sherlock noticed John’s hungry eyes and thrusted. His cock smashed against John’s bulging pants and John moaned. Sherlock gently bit his ear and whispered. “Flip around.”
John heard his husband from their bathroom and poked his head out to see him.
Sherlock stared, his heart crumpled. Of course John loved her. That was his wife. And what had Sherlock been? A measly boyfriend who left him stranded and alone for two damn years? Yes, that's what he was.
John turned back to Sherlock. "So. Are we off for Liverpool?"
"No," Sherlock said.
John grinned and looked out the window, reflection staring back at him, back at Sherlock. Sherlock thought he looked so perfect in the dying lights of dusk. No, no, not those thoughts again. Those weren't allowed. They may have been allowed before but not anymore.
Sherlock took the time to flip around and John smirked. Sherlock knew how much John loved seeing his pretty, little arse in front of him. John took Sherlock’s arse into his hands and squeezed. Sherlock yelped and let his head fall as John squeezed again. “
He sat back in his chair and handed the papers to the two men. He gave each of them pens. "Sign your name at the top," he told them, and they followed.
Sherlock sent.
Rosie smiled. “Thank you,” she said, a bit distracted.
Sherlock bit his lip and sexily looked up at John. His curls hung in front of his face like a frame. “Will you cure me, Doctor?” He asked, voice desperate for John.
"Sherlock," John called again. Shit. He hadn't looked up. His head shot up.
Sherlock’s lips met John’s and he completely melted. John wrapped his around around Sherlock’s hips and pulled him closer. His left hand was still holding Sherlock’s wrist and he was now drawing figure eights into his skin. He rotated his hips and ground on Sherlock. He tasted so sweet and he couldn’t wait to taste the rest of him.
Sherlock looked at his friend. He wasn't smiling, as if this invitation was formal, but his eyes were looking at Sherlock desperately as if he was praying Sherlock would accept. He nodded. John smiled. "Great," he said.
John smirked and rolled his hips into Sherlock’s again. He pushed his erection against Sherlock’s bulging pants and listened to his soft moan. “
Sherlock took another step closer to John. His puppy eyes made John’s heart melt. “Please, Doctor. Examine me,” He begged.
Hearing Sherlock’s cursing and moan made John’s prick stand up and he bit his lip.
Sherlock drew his hand up to John’s trousers button and unclipped it. He unzipped John’s trousers and saw the dark blue cloth of his pants. He pulled John’s pants down to his knees and used the riding crop to draw circles into his thighs. The bulge in John’s pants twitched and Sherlock drew circles around it with the riding crop.
“Please.”
“Is dinner ready?” she asked.
John moaned and arched up when he felt Sherlock stretching him. “Shh, shh. Back down,” Sherlock ordered. John obeyed and knelt back down. He resisted the urge to clench up as he felt Sherlock’s fingers tug at his balls. Finally, he relaxed when he felt Sherlock’s hand leave.
John laid on his bed. Sherlock said he was going to conduct an experiment and said it was best if John just stayed in his room.
“How much do you want me?” John teased. He nipped at Sherlock’s ear and shifted his hips, reminding Sherlock who had the dominance that day.
“No, no, no. You didn’t disobey your captain, did you?” John asked.
Sherlock‘s breath was heavy as he moaned. “Say that again. Tell me how much you need me,” He said. His voice was a thunderous rumble and John moaned as he thrusted.
John chuckled heartily. “Goodnight Sherlock,” He said. They kissed once more and John pulled the blankets over himself. He wrapped his arms around Sherlock, spooning him, and fell asleep to the soft sounds of his lover’s breathing.
,” He said, voice thick with passion.
“Got anything?" Lestrade asked.
John licked his lips. Sherlock did like playing a bit before they began. John had no complaints. He usually enjoyed their conversations.
Sherlock
John tore Sherlock’s coat off. He threw it to the ground and pulled Sherlock close. John kissed him and nudged his helmet off. He ran a hand through Sherlock’s curls.
“Did she tell you who this friend was?” Mycroft asked suspiciously.
Sherlock moaned and shook. John twisted his fingers and Sherlock bit his lip. He threw his head back and panted. His erection leaked precum and it fell onto the floor, making the floor sticky.
Mike smiled. "Thank you. Thank you," he said, standing and marching towards the door. He turned back to Sherlock but saw the man had his eyes closed. He left, quietly closing the door.
Sherlock panted. He rocked back and forth on John’s lap. John thrusted, which made Sherlock’s rocks faster. John groaned and thrusted. As he thrusted, Sherlock’s nails dug into his skin. John moaned as he came.
John sucked and tasted Sherlock’s precum. He glanced up at Sherlock, sucking again. Their eyes locked and John winked. Sherlock inhaled sharply. John sucked again, still staring at Sherlock. Their eye contact never broke as John licked at the bulbous head of Sherlock’s erection.
