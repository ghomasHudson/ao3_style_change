“Dinner’s ready”, Steve told him while picking up the blanket, folding it and putting it back down on the couch. “How are you?”
Some time later they all met again on the corridor, everyone was wearing winter clothes.
"Stop worrying about such stupid things," Steve answered, "I'm so happy you are alright or going to be, you just need to rest for a few days."
"So, Tony, say hi to Steve!" Hammer held the mobile phone next to Tony's mouth.
"So little Tony Stark is attending a common college like everyone he so despises of", Hammer laughed.
“So uhm, I’m sitting here with a gentleman pointing a gun at me and he told me to call the police”
“Please don’t shoot me”, his attacker cried looking at the barrel pointed at him.
Their opponent wasn't really a match for their team and by half time they were already leading with 32 points, most of them scored by Steve.
"Here you are!"
“Dr. Banner, I’m glad you could make it”, he approached the other man, “I’m Steve Rogers, I called you.”
“What? That’s not the point here, officer.”. Stark threw up his arms. Or tried to do so, he gave out a small yelp and clutched his right shoulder, brows furrowed in pain.
" 'm fine..."
That was the moment they heard a weak sound from behind the bushes.
“Make sure he takes those”, he said as he gave Steve two bottles of antibiotics and painkillers, then turned around to Tony who was lying on the couch, wrapped in a blanket
"Oh, that would be nice! Thanks a lot! As long as I don't bother you..."
"No, I would never leave you," Steve grabbed his hand, the one without the IV-drip, "I just talked to the doctor and he said we can go home in an hour if you are warmed up again."
"I will get a wheelchair," she told Tony who was already half asleep again.
"I'm so sorry for ruining your evening," Tony mumbled, "and I don't have a present for you anymore."
“Finished?”, Tony asked, waving the gun in his hand. This made the other man flinch and stare at him like a deer caught in headlights.
Tony tugged self-consciously on the sleeves of the jacket Steve lent him. It was a lot too big but at least warm. So warm that it was getting uncomfortable waiting inside.
They quickly fell into a, if you could call it that way,
“I’m not helping you with lab work”
"What's for breakfast", Tony asked.
As he got up he swayed a little. The alcohol was making him tipsy. It had been a long time since he had been drunk the last time.
“But my best Pepper, I’ll buy you anything. Please, I just need to borrow your pretty hands for a few minutes.”
Steve invites Tony to his first game. Things don't go as planned...
Steve smiled.
"Can you sit up for me?"
"I'm old enough", Tony snapped and gulped down the whiskey. He hoped the familiar burn of alcohol would replace his feelings for Steve. Who was currently spinning another girl in circles. For a man who said he couldn't dance he was doing incredibly well. Tony decided he couldn't watch that anymore, so he started searching for the toilet.
"Don't you want to try it?"
"I'm going to the lab. Have fun at the club!"
"No, let's go somewhere else!"
c) he was already crushing hard on the guy.
"See, you got to pick the movie like I said!" Steve beamed at him.
Light brown orbs flattered open and Tony tried to take in where he was and what had happened.
"Also, we need to talk", Steve started. Tony froze in his thoughts, he had hoped Steve wouldn't say that.
"I said -Say hi to Steve-", Hammer repeated and pulled his head up by his hair.
Turned out that while being a genius, Stark was also amazingly good at explaining how things worked to normal people. His voice was warm and friendly and against Steve’s expectations he was patient in explaining what to do. While the captain was sitting in one of the chairs, Tony had sat down at the edge of the table and got up several times to get some spare parts or another cup of coffee.
“He just tells me you should hurry up.”
"Do you think you can eat something?" he asked after Tony had swallowed the pills, "I made some soup!"
"I think someone attacked Tony!" He was panting as he reached the common room.
"Hello, so you are the famous Tony." Peggy grabbed his hand and shook it, "Steve has told me so much about you, how smart you are and how hard you work all the time. I'm so happy I finally get to meet you."
"Are you..." Bruce began and stopped midsentence. "...gay?" Tony asked. "You can run away now in disgust and avoid me for the rest of my life."
“That’s not what I meant, you gave Stark your number? That is way more straight forward than what I expected from you, Stevie. My best friend, falling in love with the most wanted bachelor of Manhattan!”
"Stop it!" Steve sounded angry. He tried to snatch the phone from Clint who just backed away a few steps and started commenting on the video.
“Fine, tell him tomorrow, I’ll be there. Can’t do a lot else these days, can’t I?”
Oh, great. Steve could have just let him pick his won seat, but no, now he was seated right in front of Justin Hammer.
So while Peggy and Tony started forming snowballs, Steve and Thor started fighting the other team.
“I’ll be back in a minute”, Tony told him and got up, “don’t run away.”
"It was Steve, wasn't it?"
"Also...", Steve began, "he said something about you having a crush... on me?"
Natasha grabbed the first present from the pile.
"Sorry, it's getting cold. I'll go inside."
After taking his blood pressure ("90/50- It's a wonder he is still conscious!"), his pulse and body temperature ("91.4 °F- We have to get him warm again quickly!") the nurse disappeared and the doctor took a look at Tony's ankle.
Steve gulped. Okay, Stark was a lot to handle with him being a billionaire and one of the most influential people Steve met in his life and he didn’t know if this was still content with the compliance rule, but he felt his resistance crumble under Starks smile.
"Would you like some hot chocolate?" he asked, "Jarvis, my butler, always made hot chocolate for me when I felt bad."
G-r-e-a-t. Hammer. And he thought he was finally free from hat guy after finishing high school.
“It’s alright. What’s the name of your doctor?”
“Alright, I appreciate your help, Captain…uhm...Steve. I’ll text you”, the brunette told him and Steve couldn’t help but grin at the sight of Tony Stark blushing.
On the picture he looked deeply concentrated and happy at the same time. It was amazing how Steve had managed to capture his feelings, but something wasn't quite right.
"I don't look that good." Tony said with a scowl.
"Oh, Steve! You're really good at this!" Then she moaned.
“I never really played board games”, he sighed, hating to admit it.
“Come on…”, he mumbled watching the thief fumbling with his phone. He could feel his right sleeve getting wetter by the minute and the ringing in his ears wouldn’t cease. Through cotton he could hear the guy talking to someone on the phone.
Turned out the internet was an amazing place (not that he hadn’t known that) and after a few minutes of research he had found several articles as well as photos of Steve. Gosh, that man had been tiny as a child, even smaller than Tony himself, but had hit a nice growth spurt in high school. He learned that Steve had studied art at a community college funded by a football scholarship (He may had saved several of those football photos as soon as he saw them) and then moved on to a police academy graduating with honors. After that he found a few articles on the captain saving a cute stray dog from drowning, saving an athlete who passed out during the central park marathon and so on. All resulting in a few realizations:
"So now you know why I stick to fast food." Tony looked a little down.
Tony got up first. "I have homework to take care of, so I'll leave you guys alone."
“Wow, didn’t know you were such an eye candy. But blame it on me, I wasn’t really able to appreciate it that night.”
"Are we still at the hospital?" He asked sleepily.
"But I have to finish my new project", Tony sighed. Steve was already hassling him for 30 minutes already and showed no sign of giving up.
“Uh, yes. I kinda got to know Mr. Stark through that, I was helping him in the workshop when he fell on his shoulder. He’s on the couch, sleeping right now.”
"Yeah... We could still be friends though. I like you very much as a friend."
The shower was running and it was only Tony and him, so this had to be Tony.
"Could you stop this?" Tony had sprung to his feet and stared at him with gleaming eyes. Then he slowly sat back down again and nodded.
"I'm gonna put something on..."
"What?" Tony sat up straight and winced because that hurt!
After Steve left, Tony realized that he had fallen for his friend. So hard that it hurt thinking about it.
Tony sighed. That was going to be the worst lunch he had ever had. Finally everyone moved on and started talking about sports.
"See ya", and with that Tony closed the door again.
“I’m glad you like it”, Steve laughed, feeling his own face heat up under the sounds of satisfaction Tony was making while eating. After devouring the first bites the billionaire slowed down and looked at him with a smile.
“uhm, you kind of
“Then let’s get your prototype finished”, Steve smiled and made his way over to the workbench where they had been working the day before. Tony followed him and Steve could hear the faint slapping of his flip flops. God, someone really should tell the other about workshop safety.
"Let's get dressed", Bruce told them and everyone went to their rooms.
Bucky tossed him his phone, then leaned forward and propped his head in his linked fingers looking a Steve with a small smirk and some expectation.
"What is a secret Santa?" Tony whispered to Steve. He never had spent much time among others and no one ever told him about this tradition.
“You know, I’d rather get to know you myself. The internet isn’t a kind place”, he said with a smirk. Tony, who had still been drinking, started to choke on the water, his face turning a bright red. He started coughing. After a few seconds the brunette finally managed to suck in a breath and struggled to regain his composure.
“I don’t know how you did that”, Clint told him afterwards, “but it was brilliant.”
“Thank you, officer”, he managed to slur and felt the world closing in on his. The last thing he saw was the panicked look on the face of hot officer. Then he let darkness wash over him.
Considering the light falling through the half closed blinds it was probably somewhat around 3 pm. But he didn’t know for how long he had slept. Tony raised his arm to shake the doctor’s hand and was met with pain again. Shoot, he totally forgot that basically anything with his right arm was a very bad idea.
“Oh sweetie, I’m not gonna do that until you arrested my friend over here”, he told the officer. Who was as hot as he was useless. Couldn’t he hurry?
Tony sighed. Really? Now? Was Peggy away for the weekend or what?
He started stroking Tony's damp hair and noticed that he was a little warm. The fever the doctor had warned him about. It didn't feel too hot though.
Turned out he was wrong.
“Tell me more!” Bucky leaned back in his seat. “Is he as good looking as the pictures tell?”
"Of course not, that is something you have to tell him by yourself if you want him to know." Bruce smiled at him.
"I can eat at the table", Tony protested, but Steve wouldn't have any of it.
"High school bully, he hated me because I was smarter than him and stole his show every time... well, sometimes on purpose", Tony explained, "This time it was kinda my fault... I stood up against him. The next time he brought some bigger guys along."
"You're so strong!" Tony said and placed his hand on his pectoral. He started stroking it.
“Wait, did you google me?”
“That sure sounds amazing. I just don’t want to waste..”
Ok, more huge crush on Steve. And after yesterday it had only gotten worse.
“Okay, Mr. Stark, you clearly got an infection in your shoulder. I guess bacterial. That would also explain your fever and the pain. I need to clean the wound and we’ll put you on a broad antibiotics therapy. Before that let’s get down to my car, I have a portable x-ray machine with me and I want to make sure nothing was damaged when you fell. Can you help me with that, Mr. Rogers?”
He watched Tony's face turning from pale to dark red. Then Tony smiled and it was one of the most beautiful smiles Steve had ever seen.
"Oh, yes, you do!" Steve said it as if he didn't quite understand Tony's point.
Steve and Thor were the first ones to sprint to the window. The campus was slowly getting covered in white and it seemed like the best thing ever to them.
Right in front of him was standing the unfriendly guy who ran into him that morning. His hair was still as messy as the first time Steve met him and his glasses were taped together at the front with some duct tape.
"You mean the fact that I will probably fall over every step because they are so big?" Tony answered.
“Is everything alright? As I recall I turned in all the paperwork on time”, Steve answered, looking confused.
"Uh, hey", he greeted Tony, "did you miss me so much, that you had to wait for me sitting in front of the flat?"
Like yesterday they fell into a routine of Tony telling him what to do and Steve executing it.
“Tony, those are my shitty roommate Bucky, who forgot his key, and my friends Natasha, Clint and Sam!”, Steve introduced them, “guys, that’s my friend Tony, who…wait, Tony,
He looked away, visibly nervous.
“Shit”, Tony screamed in agony, “Fuck.” Steve could hear his voice break, he saw the engineer’s form trembling and the moans were replaced by soft, wet sobs. Steve took a quick breath then kneeled down next to him.
"I'd love too," Tony answered, "the date thing... and... I like you"
“Yes, my name is Captain Rogers, how may I assist you?”
"Well, good night then. Tonight was fun!" Tony turned around in the door and smiled at them.
"So, if that is true," Steve continued, "would you like to go out... on a date... with me?" He blushed a little, "I mean, after you're healed?"
“Wait what? Your body is like the American dream”, Tony intervened. Steve couldn’t help but laugh, feeling a bit self-conscious. He scratched his head.
"Then I don't know what messy is." Steve laughed and earned himself a punch into the shoulder.
He started walking towards the elevators taking the decision from Steve.
7:52 he started running. For one thing running kept him warm for the other he had only 8 minutes left.
The others started laughing.
“You told me you were on your way back from a party. Were you drunk?”
Prying his eyes open Steve noticed that something wasn't quite alright. He wasn't at home in his comfortable bed. Instead he was in a hotel room. And suddenly the memories came crashing back. It was his first day at college, he had missed the last bus to campus yesterday (it was raining, so walking was not an option) and had to spend the night in town in a tiny hotel. And he was going to be late!
Tony sighed. Really, Hammer was just as dumb as he was in high school. And just as annoying.
Taking one look at the engineer, the doctor opened his bag and pulled out a few things. Banner used a thermometer to check Tony’s temperature, sighed and moved on to inspecting the injury. Steve watched him help Tony out of the brace and his shirt, then unwrapping the crumpled bandage on his shoulder. He tried not to stare at the half naked man. Even when hurt Tony was still attractive for sure.
7:48 shit he was running late! Tony grabbed his gift and left the workshop in a hurry. Outside he just realized he had forgot his jacket inside but there was no time to turn around again.
"So sorry to hear. You know, those could be early signs of Parkinson's."
But we hope you enjoyed it nevertheless!
“Dr. Banner”, Tony answered, he pulled out his phone, opened the contacts and gave it to Steve.
“I just don’t like that fuzzy feeling”, Tony complained. Dr. Banner ignored him and continued his lecture.
"How about we take this somewhere a little more private?" Hammer suggested and smiled a sly grin. He picked up the package that still was lying on the ground, "follow me!"
Steve stopped the engine and grabbed a walkie talkie. The address the man had given him was in one of the smaller and unlit streets in Manhattan. The streets were pretty empty at this time of the night and he couldn’t see a soul around. Well, he would at least take a look.
“Okay”, Steve answered. This was by far the most unusual job someone had ever asked him to do - but not the worst. He waited for the brunette to respond but Tony was staring at him, looking shocked. As soon as Steve met his eyes he looked away, Steve could make out a small blush tinting his ears.
As they approached the café they could see a few couples through the window. And...
“That’s an unknown number, sending you a text with some four digit code and saying
-Tony, I haven't seen you for days, come on!-
"We ordered Pepperoni for you, if that's ok."
"So, what is in this package?" he smiled and Tony felt his heart drop. Everything but please not Steve's present!
"Well, I think I'll finish for today and do the rest tomorrow." Or the next days. He would probably need more time.
“Hi uh…am I talking to a police officer??”
The others caught up with him.
"Oh, good. You're awake! Thank you!"
He felt tears build up in his eyes.
"No!" (Clint)
"If you still have room for another eater..." Tony answered.
Apparently seeing the game was more important than humiliating Tony, so Hammer sat down again.
“Oh no worries, sweetheart, I just wanted to see you again”
"Uhm... thanks", Tony answered. This was bad, he had decided he hated Peggy and here she was, being friendly to him.
In the light of Tonys mobile phone they made their way over to the kitchen. After they had set down the pizzas on the table to cool down, they made their way over to the corridor.
"Sure. It's no big deal", Bruce answered.
Suddenly the door to Steve's room opened. His blood grew cold. So he had been at home and he had heard him and he was sitting at the table in only his boxers and...
Even though Steve protested he couldn't keep Clint from taking out his phone.
"It wasn't that bad." Natasha admitted. "Nice isn't quite the right word, but it wasn't totally bad. Only a little... Or maybe more..."
They then proceeded to watching a Christmas movie. Steve had actually got "The reindeer games" so they could watch it, but it left a bitter after-taste in his mouth thinking about Tony. He had thought they were friends.
“Alright”, Steve answered, and gave him a small smile. Tony was fiddling with the light switch and soon the room was illuminated by soft, dim light.
"Another one?"Clint asked as they had finished the first movie.
Steve was rummaging through the drawers, arranging snacks. Tony saw the macarons he brought arranged on two plates. He cleared his throat and Steve turned around. The blonde opened his mouth as if to say something but stopped and just stared at Tony, his cheeks turning a soft pink. Tony felt his own face mirroring Steve’s.
“I don’t have any plans tomorrow night, so let’s do it” Steve answered, “Also next time, please don’t call my boss. Here, I’ll give you my number, you can just text me; and it’s Steve by the way.”
“Don’t make me use force. I’m the one in charge, hand over the money”, the attacker squeaked.
After being pestered by Steve for hours he had even agreed to put on a costume. So right now he was wearing a cape from the local costume rental and pointed teeth. At least it wasn't that bad, being a cool vampire sure was awesome. Or at least not embarrassing.
"15 long minutes until it is ready..." Thor sighed.
"Wait!" Bruce got up. "We'll come with you."
“Seems like you were lucky”, the doctor told them looking at a few images. “The bone is still set as it should be and is starting to heal already.”
"As friend Tony I will stay here", Thor told them, everyone nodded. As an exchange student it was probably the best idea.
He had been lost in thoughts on one of his newer projects, so when someone had pulled him into a dark alleyway, he had taken a short look at his attacker and decided that the guy wasn’t even worth his time. Like, he had stuff to do.
"Hey! What are you doing here?" She gave him a wink.
“Thank you for your time. “, the blonde stood up and stretched out his hand. Stark tried to raise his right hand, stopped in pain and clumsily shook his hand using the left.
"That was delicious, friend Tony!" He exclaimed.
"Stop it", Tony whimpered. God, he was already sounding pathetic. His arms were starting to hurt from being held down with such a force.
And with that he walked away, felling much better than before.
So they added 4 more pizzas, which was kind of a challenge because the oven was quite small.
And then suddenly he tripped, the small package he was clenching flew through the air and hit the ground with a small crunch. Tony stared at the crumpled package with horror.
“And finished”, Steve grinned and turned to the sink to wash the razor. He took one of the fluffy white towels Tony loved and handed it to him. Drying his face, Tony looked in the mirror and gave out a small, satisfied sound.
On Friday Steve sent him an address in Brooklyn – probably their apartment- and Tony got a little nervous. After finishing his appointment at Dr. Banners, he got Happy to pick him up and drive him there. When he had asked Steve if he should bring anything, the blonde hat told him ‘snacks’, so he stopped Happy at a confectionery. Probably macarons would be okay? Since he didn’t know how many people would be there, he bought the entire macaron display, better safe than sorry. Looking at the giant bag he might have gone a bit overboard…Outside the car the soft rain from todays afternoon had turned into a full downpour, when Happy stopped in front of a small alleyway.
"So, this is where I usually work. I'll sit here. You can just choose where you want to sit down. Except me there is no one working around Christmas."
"Yes, but it still has to cool down", Steve answered, "what about the lasagne?"
"Did I hurt you? I'm so sorry," He started.
“Tell me about yourself, Tony”, Steve smiled, taking another bite from the pasta.
While everyone was already assembled in the common room he was still missing.
The next days he started avoiding Steve. Forgotten were their cooking parties and movie nights. Tony spent the days locked in his room running only on coffee, energy drinks and fast food while Steve was never at home, spending every evening he got with Peggy.
--------------
“I don’t need a break”, Stark snapped at him, “I told you I’m fine. It’s only a minor injury and I’ll be better soon. No reason to pity me.”
Wait? What?
“Alright, sweet cheeks, you are going to take the mobile from my right pocket and call the police”, Tony pressed out through gritted teeth. Normally he would have his security dealing with incidents like this, but the guy had shot him and Tony would make sure he would go to jail. Even if that meant calling the police.
“Buck, stop. I’ve seen him once, not gonna see him again. And that was all just work business. The case “Stark” will be closed once I finish writing this report.”
Big thanks to my twin who provided me with a bit of medical knowledge (I'm an engineer, I'm not proficient in medical stuff)
Tony, who was still trying to put his boots on sighed. Thank you for that. Always nice to hear people laughing about him.
Just when he reached his bed again, utterly exhausted from the short toilet break, he heard a key turning and the door opening.
“Also, no offense, but you should go get some more rest. I was shot once and know that this isn’t a pleasant experience.”
“Actually, I might take you up on that offer, captain”, he answered, “but only if you will go to dinner with me tomorrow.”
"No way!" His voice grew a little high pitched. Bruce just continued looking at him.
"Sorry!" He laughed. "I forgot about yesterday- I was kinda in a rush, so the lessons didn't really stick with me."
After another moment of silence Tony got up.
“I’ll just go…to the workshop”, he answered, already distracted by the thoughts of possible projects. At least he could count on his engineer’s brain.
Tony sat down at their little table and started watching Steve as he prepared their dinner. There wasn't much to prepare. Tony had insisted on pizza and Steve was slowly getting used to eating pizza almost every week.
He grabbed a piece of paper from the receptionist and started scribbling down his number as well as his name, adding a small star behind it. Bucky would kill him, if he told him about this day. Stark looked at him with wide eyes as he handed him the piece of paper, then he smiled a genuine smile.
“Sure, just don’t do anything stupid. And no heavy lifting”
That was the good thing about Bruce. He didn't force himself on other people. To live and let live seemed to be his motto. He would be a nice doctor, Tony decided. Not to invasive but very good at observing and noticing minor details.
"Guys, hold him up", Hammer told the bodyguards and Tony felt himself being lifted of the ground.
Steve shrugged while his best friend continued to laugh. Even though this whole situation was more than embarrassing for him, he couldn’t help but smile about Bucky’s delight. He was used to the friendly banter since from their high school days on Bucky had tried to set him up for several dates (none of them successful though) The next moment his phone pinged and before Steve could have a look, Bucky dove for it, snatching it from Steve’s fingers.
Without speaking, the young man pointed ever so minutely at the trunk behind him.
Which is how, an hour later, he glanced over at Rumlow—because they were sitting next to one another, Tony draped across both their laps, Tony letting out little, please purrs as Rumlow ran fingers through Tony’s hair and stroked down Tony’s neck and spine—and he sighed. “I don’t know what your problem is with me, Rumlow.”
Ste-Virn had never been in that picture, even though he had shared the same quarters and supposedly shared Jedi Kulsi as a mentor.
“What do you know about this team?” she asked.
How could he—
Steve stood there, arms crossed, frowning at him.
She would fight him for this, here and now, if she thought she needed to.
It seemed like Rumlow was way more thrown by this than anything else, because as he was slowly standing up he stopped and just stared at Steve. It probably hadn’t helped that Steve had said it casually, not turning around from where he was frosting the cupcakes. Or maybe it was that Steve was in fact frosting cupcakes as he said it.
Ste-Virn tried not to be suspicious of it, he really, really did.
Clint took one and sat down. “We don’t we just get that robot? That, um, that Iron Man? That appeared like, four years ago?”
Which meant it made almost no sense at all for Tony Stark, grandson of Howard Stark, to make his way into SHIELD rosters. Yeah, SHIELD needed omegas, but anyone joining SHIELD went through a drawn-out interview process, and didn’t realize exactly what SHIELD was. Most likely, Tony had entered the military like any other omega, thinking to serve out his contract with a group of alphas unlikely to see combat in the rank and file, or in the Navy, or in the Air Force. How he got shuffled into SHIELD’s depths… that was something Steve wasn’t sure about.
Ste-Virn wouldn’t even be so upset if Saark ever acknowledged that he knew what he was doing when he said those words, or behaved in that way. But Saark always acted oblivious, as if shocked that Ste-Virn would take offense at his behavior and words. And Ste-Virn was tired of always trying to be the mature one and walk away from what Saark had said or done this day.
“You can’t tell me that you didn’t notice we were doing… better with one another, before you ran off on your own?” Ste-Virn pointed out.
Gritting his teeth, Ste-Virn tucked his datapad away and moved to the shadows. Once he was sure he was hidden from all but the most thorough of observers, he sank into his meditation pose, closing his eyes and blocking out the world from his physical senses.
“Good, good, great to see you as well. I cannot thank you enough, Captain Rogers, I cannot thank you enough. Tony has always been a bit headstrong, a bit too wild, you know. Chose to join the military right out of college. Shouldn’t even have joined college, if you think about it, eh? Certainly his degree isn’t any use in the
“Steve?”
That startled a laugh out of Anotoni, which devolved into a giggling fit. When he started hiccupping, Ste-Virn sighed. “Let me go find those detox pills. We need to flush the spell all the way out.”
, Clint,” Natasha sighed.
In his mind, he could still see the tousled brown hair falling over delicate features—face bowed, so he didn’t know exactly the facial structure beyond an upturned nose. He could trace the vertebrae down the delicate spine, small scars marring dusky skin. He could see the faint outline of ribs, the carefully folded arms behind the omega’s back, the feet up and proper in the kneeling position. The small, soft cock nestled between carefully trimmed black hair—black hair that was so fine and small that it was almost unnoticeable on legs and arms, and none on the chest from what Steve could see. The delicate, almost overly intricate collar around the neck, blocking the bonding glands from an overly enthusiastic partner.
“Shot”, Tony corrected him through clenched teeth. Banner moved to his side and fumbled with one of the IVs. A few seconds later Tony could feel the pain recede and gave him a small smile.
Only a few minutes later his phone buzzed and showed him the reply Captain Rogers, Steve, had sent. He sent back an emoji and decided to work some more in an attempt to pass the time till Rogers came over. God, he hoped the man was an early bird so they could go back to working. Thinking of it…it wasn’t like he was a stalker but information on like anything was appealing to Tony so he googled his new friend (was he allowed to call him a friend?).
“Put the gun away and get lost”, he sighed, “don’t wanna hurt you, you know. Also you can do better, I have only like 50 dollars on me.”
They somehow managed to get Steve back on the field, but he just couldn't concentrate on the game. When they were done finally he just grabbed his stuff and left.
"Really, take it easy Tony, it's not your fault that you are feeling bad. And we won, so you don't need to worry about me, the medics said that it's just a bruise and it will heal in a few days." Before Tony could answer, Steve picked him up and carried him towards his bedroom.
The guy picked up his now cracked glasses and put them on again. He sent Steve an angry glare and continued picking up his stuff.
Steve felt his face heat up as Stark continued to smile at him. He cleared his throat.
"Hot chocolate sounds awesome." Finally Steve smiled again.
Who knew he had such a great voice? He had to force him to go to the karaoke bar across town sometime soon. Then he remembered him and Tony not talking. Ok, barely talking.
It was quite nice to be alone.
Steve couldn’t help but chuckle. He would have loved to be a witness of the two officers trying to rescue a kitten. And both Clint and Bucky finally were getting somewhere. Their colleague Natasha had a betting pool on them and Steve himself had participated in it, rumors said even their boss was in. Thank god no one was betting on his love life. (Or he thought so, knowing Natasha there might be a second pool. He just didn’t want to know)
Both Natasha and Steve would stay at the dorm since they had no parents to visit left. Clint would go on a vacation with his boyfriend.
“I’m good” he told the brunette and gave him a smile, “We could also take a break if you want to.” This proved to be the wrong answer as Stark’s face darkened in an instant.
"If that isn't Stark. Nice costume", someone shoved him into the wall.
“It was my pleasure”, Steve answered, “take care of yourself and I’ll come over as soon as my shift is finished?”
After that weekly movie nights became a thing, even though they always spent hours fighting about the movies to watch.
“We already talked about your idea of “resting” and you are welcome to call a nurse if you need any help”, the doctor sighed.
Steve greeted him with a sleepy: "Morning..."
"Sorry for that", Clint grinned. He had hit Tony in the face with a snowball earlier.
The showering noises and the singing stopped.
“Even if I’m repeating myself, you should really cut it short for a few days. I don’t want you out of bed till Friday, alright? Also, please schedule a checkup with my secretary next week, I can’t always just leave the hospital as soon as you call me.”
While Steve was currently on the dance floor, dancing with one cute girl after another, Tony turned down every offer. Just seeing Steve was enough and he didn't really like dancing either. He would just drown his jealousy in alcohol and go home afterwards.
Tony gave him an angry look and got up.
They both stared at each other for a moment.
"As a matter of fact I'm studying engineering and you business management", he sighed, "You will never beat me, no matter what you try. Intelligence beats arrogance!"
“Are you Captain Rogers from the NYPD?”, she asked him and smiled.
"This is the last chance", Tony spat out between clenched teeth, "let me go and there won't be any consequences!"
“Ouch”, he complained, “can’t you be gentler? Invalid here, remember?”
"Yes, it happens about twice a semester", a girl told them. She had a faint Russian accent.
“Your bandages need to be changed daily now and I’m putting you on at least two more days of bed rest. Means no working, do you understand?”
"What happened to you?!"
“Mister, if you would please put down the gun and tell me what happened here”, he answered, trying to stay calm. This was the most unusual situation he had even encountered in the last 5 years of working for the NYPD.
"Hey, are you with me? Tony? Say something!"
"I hope our pizza arrives on time." Peggy chimed in.
His father had sent him off with the words: "Go and find yourself a nice girl that is able to take your mood swings."
“Stop being childish, you shouldn’t be working anyways! Tony, please. You should give your body time to heal.”
"No hospitals, please!"
"No!" (Natasha)
Someone had hit him in the chest, hard. He looked up and didn't see anyone.
"As a matter of fact, I can't."
"Uh, aren't you the one who is arrogant here, Tony?"
"Isn't Steve your boyfriend, you little gay whore?" Hammer asked, cocking a sly grin, "oh right, I forgot he isn't gay like you are."
The next moment one of the bags gave out and spilled it contents all over the floor.
She drew one herself and snickered. That was going to be fun. Tony was the last to draw. He opened his paper and tried not to frown. Steve.
"Yeah, you should definitely try it out!" Steve grinned while he mustered Thors upper body. He should have enough mass to tackle down everyone in his way.
“Ah, you know, I’m an insomniac but I managed to sleep for a few hours”, Tony answered, running his left hand through his hair.
Tony tried to get up but failed miserably.
Awkward silence followed. After Tony had finished the soup, Steve got back up again.
“Good evening Captain, you would be of great help if you could arrest that thug over there”
“Wait, I’ll get it for you, don’t move to much or you’ll pull your stitches”, Steve told him.
Suddenly Tony heard a loud bang, making his ears ring and he felt his shoulder and arm being engulfed in pain he couldn’t really process. What he could process, tho, was that both he and thug-guy were lying on the ground and he was clutching the gun in his right hand. Which he couldn’t feel anymore.
"Here I am", Tony stated as a matter of fact.
“Come on, Pep, you can’t leave me like this!”, Tony pleaded knowing he sounded pathetic.
“Better?”
The fucker hat shot him!
"Sounds good to me." Bruce answered.
“Be careful”
Tony's bladder felt like it was going to burst, so he decided that he should head for the toilet. He slowly sat up and waited until the world had stopped spinning. Thanks to his ankle walking wouldn't work out, so Toy decided on crawling. Hopefully Steve wouldn't come back and see him.
"So, write your names down and throw them in here." Natasha handed out paper and pencils and held up a beanie.
"You still look like the walking dead." He mused. "Did you sleep at all?"
Looking at the clock Tony noticed that he was already running late.
"Are you still cold?" Steve asked with a worried tone.
"Can anyone reach him?" Bruce asked, holding up his phone. "I can't get through."
"Is there anyone except me who would like some more?"
“He is your problem now”, he just told the blonde, then he left the penthouse.
“I’m sorry, just have to follow the protocol”, Steve answered, continuing to write down Starks answers. “So aside from being in pain you were fully conscious when pointing a gun at a person?”
How couldn’t he remember? Even though he wouldn’t admit it the guy had practically saved him. Well, after he saved himself, of course. And he could have been a bit faster. But - if you’re a beggar don’t be a chooser – he had at least done his job as well as (he wouldn’t admit that but from what Tony knew he had lost a LOT of blood) saved his life. All while looking like a human angel. Life was unfair sometimes.
"Oh", Tony breathed, "I'm sorry." He still tried to process the information. Steve was single again. And he could finally like Peggy without feeling jealous. But he still felt bad for Steve who looked really down.
Oh no, he wasn't able to stand the lovey-dovey couple the whole evening!
Only minutes later he found himself face to face with the man from a few nights ago. The first thing he noticed was that Stark was incredibly handsome with his perfectly styled hair and goatee…but smaller than he had expected. He might be a half a foot smaller than Steve himself. Stark was wearing a very expensive looking suit (this one not ruined) and a sun glasses. His right arm was in a sling, fixing it to his body. Steve felt himself stare and quickly turned his gaze away.
Tony nodded and headed across the room.
“Sorry, didn’t want to insult you, it’s just that I could use some food and you might feel the same way!”
“Tell me all ‘bout your day then.”
“No”, Tony sighed, “I feel like shit and I can’t use my arm for the next months, Rhodey, MONTHS”
“Thank you”, Tony gave him a small nod feeling exhaustion wash over him again.
"Hey, Tony! I'm going out for a bit. Wanna join me?"
Awkward silence followed. Finally Clint said: "Well, I have to take care of a few things, so see you tomorrow!"
Seconds later they were on their way the lights on their car flashing.
It was dark enough so no one could see him blush, but it was way too obvious as he croaked a small: "Thank you."
"You spent the whole day locked in your room, working on something, let's have some fun once", Steve answered.
"Oh, still hurt." Tony grinned. He approached Justin who took a step backwards.
"Thank you", Steve took a sip, "It really tastes good!"
The next days Tony spent in the workshop at the college working on Steve's mini-bike. He had decided that it would be a nice feature if the lights would actually work. So he spent hours sitting there fiddling with tiny engine parts. At least they didn't have any course-assignments this week so he could use that time for working on the motorcycle. They had decided to meet up at Friday 8 pm and Tony really needed to finish before that. So while the others went home after finishing the last course he stayed behind in the workshop, polishing the motorcycle and finally wrapping it.
“That looks really good.”, he exclaimed and sat down, “Pasta has always been one of my favorite dishes.”
Amazing!
In front of their apartment he noticed he had left the key inside. He knocked. Maybe Steve was there. No answer. So he would have to wait.
Despite his angry voice, Steve started laughing. He had been called a lot of things after his growth spurt last summer, "dorito" wasn't one of them.
"Fuck off", Tony started collecting his books that were lying spilled all over the floor. The second time this week.
He was still planning his revenge on Hammer, but he wasn't that angry anymore. After all he had got him his gorgeous boyfriend. He would still see that Hammer would get kicked out of college.
After taking the first bite he had to admit though that he could have just eaten a candy bar. There wasn't anything besides chocolate in this.
A knock on the door woke him.
"He is under the influence of heavy pain meds," Bruce explained. The driver chose not to answer and just started the motor.
"I'll leave you two now. When the IV is done, just call for a nurse."
"Steve," he whispered, "I thought you left."
"Don't you have work to do?" Steve asked, "Not that I don't enjoy spending time with you but you normally just lock yourself in your room for days."
Science fair, well, that didn't sound too bad. Also Bruce was the nicest one of his friends, he never bothered Tony with rambling about girls, he never asked him about his love live and he liked science. Which made him an awesome guy in Tony's eyes.
He was indeed a little tired after passing out, but that would pass. Steve was acting way too protective. Well, it was nice and cute and...
“A lot better already. Let me just grab a band aid and I’m ready to work again”, Steve had spotted the first aid kit on the counter and wrapped a small plaster around the burnt finger. “see, nothing to worry about, let’s finish your device, I’ll make sure to not burn myself again.”
"Peggy, was it?" He picked up the flirt and as the barkeeper handed him the drinks, he casually passed one on to her.
We hope you like this chapter :)
He sighed then gave his assistant and best friend a strained smile.
"Come on, Tony it's my first game"; Steve pleaded him, "all the others have promised to come. It will be fun!"
"If that isn't Stark", Tony tripped over an outstreched leg and spilled his books over the floor. Great.
"Thanks for the food, see you around!"
"We will draw the names after the lasagne." Clint decided, "I'm hungry and it should be finished."
At their apartment he just took a quick look at his phone.
"Go ahead and buy one, I don't drink coffee", Steve laughed. He guessed Tony wasn't really a morning person the way he was draped over the small kitchen table, staring at the cup of coffee with a reproachful expression.
-How about movie night?-
He also bought some vegetables and tangerines. On his way home he noticed so many happy couples, cuddling and kissing under mistletoes that he started to feel bad again. Things only got worse when the single person approaching him was Justin Hammer.
"You should really come!" (Natasha)
“No need to”, he laughed feeling slightly embarrassed. As well as a bit of pity, did nothing ever do anything for the other without being paid? Sure, Tony’s behavior was a bit irritating most of the time, but he genuinely seemed to be a nice guy?
Here goes nothing. I'm sorry that writing this took me so long. Right now I'm kinda stuck in a writers block but since this chapter is finished I'll share it with you. Might abandon this fic some time tho :/
But Steve just grabbed his hand and pulled him onto the dance floor into a crowd of moving bodies.
And he kissed Steve again.
“Mr. Stark is ready to see you, if you’d please follow me!”
He had been shot and some gorgeous blonde beef boy had saved him. No, wait, he had saved himself and blondie had assisted him. That sounded better. Badass Tony Stark, attacking his attacker and managing to solve the situation. Well except for…getting shot. He slowly tried to flex the fingers in his right hand, only resulting in excruciating pain flaring up his arm and shoulder.
"Hello", Steve greeted them, "do you know something about the cause of the blackout?"
“Sorry, sorry. It’s just…”
The room was basked in soft light shining through the huge glass windows and Tony noticed that sometime in the night he had kicked the blanket out of the bed. With a look at the clock he sat up. Huh, he couldn’t remember the last time he last slept for more than 13 hours. That would also explain why his shoulder was hurting more by the minute. His fingers itched to do something productive, but considering the events of the last day (and the doctor’s orders) maybe spending the day in bed, pumped with painkillers, wasn’t the worst option. And Steve was coming over that night, so he had that going, which was nice.
While Tony was working on his new invention- a robot- he found his mind wandering back to his new roommate. Steve Rogers, hu? He had heard the name before, he was pretty sure. But he couldn't remember where and that pissed him off more than it should.
"No... ah... well, that would be nice", Tony admitted and closed his eyes. Steve called for a nurse and she inserted some painkillers into the IV-drip.
-I hate you. But I will go. Hope it's as awesome as you said-
Steve laughed.
"Do you have some more painkillers?" Tony asked.
"So, uhm, I had fun today", Tony told Bruce as they reached the dorm, "...thanks."
Is this what I think it is?”
He made his way back to the workbench, Tony behind him, when it happened. He heard a small curse to see that Tony’s flip flop had gotten stuck between a few pieces of junk, the brunette trying to gain back his balance, arm flailing ineffectively, the crash inevitable. He tipped over and crashed into Steve with a cry sending both tumbling to the ground. Everything went quiet.
“Be happy I don’t force you to attend board meetings”, Pepper called over the shoulder then exited through the elevator leaving Tony to himself.
“Tony, I’m going to carry you. Is that alright?”
“What about you project? It still isn’t finished, is it”, Steve asked with a frown. This situation was spiraling out of his control much faster than he would have liked.
Tony took the spoon but his hand was shaking to hard. He sighed.
"Second..." Tony corrected him.
"Finished", he set down a cup of hot chocolate in front of Steve, who had just failed level 19 of Candy Crush again. , "It's a pity we don't have mini marshmallows."
"I..." he started and stopped again.
Tony nodded slowly.
"Oh..good...", Steve sighed. He couldn't deny that this was a relief, he was on a scholarship for a reason. Without it his mom could have never afforded to pay the tuition fees.
"Alright", he sighed.
“When was the last time you changed the bandages?”, he asked Tony with a frown.
They made their way through the main entrance hall of the building swarming with a lot of people. Steve had to remind himself that even though this was a heavily secured building, people still worked here. Some of the stared at him when Mrs. Potts made her way through the crowd towards an elevator, so Steve gave them a friendly smile. When the door of the elevator closed behind them he could see the redhead’s shoulders slack. She turned around and gave him a shaky smile.
"What about that Café?" Bruce asked and pointed at a tiny café across the street.
"What about desert?" Steve asked and smiled. "Tony has clearly outdone himself on this."
Steve shrugged. "Maybe... Don't know..."
"Is he on pain medication?" Bruce asked, eying Tony from the side. A goofy grin was spread all over his face while he kept on petting Steve's muscles.
"Actually I have no assignments", Tony smiled, "the Profs gave us none, which is awesome! This is why I like Christmas time."
"Every breath you take~~~~"
Tony finally found his phone and looked at the screen. Another message, but this time from Bruce. So he decided to at least read it.
"Steve, we need a coffee machine, this coffee powder is incredibly disgusting", Tony whined as soon as Steve entered the kitchen the next morning.
"Both Tasha and me are sophomores so we have already joined clubs last year. I'm on the football team and Tasha does material arts." Clint explained.
“Sunshine over there “ – another wave with the gun which made both Steve and the other guy flinch – “Tried to rob me. So we had a fast showdown with him shooting me and me taking his gun and then I told him to call the police, meaning you. So if you, please, could arrest him…my patience is wearing thin”
The next morning it was like nothing had changed. Steve was a tiny bit disappointed. But he at least convinced Tony to sit down with him for a coffee before he returned to his projects.
"I will shower after putting you to bed", he answered, "and after that I will make you some soup."
“Wait, Stark donated money to our department just to have you come over so you could...build some fickle engineering stuff for him?”, Bucky laughed. Both he and Steve were sitting at their small kitchen table eating scrambled eggs and some sausage for dinner.
„I get silent and nice - but it sure is a bit boring“, Bucky complained, giving the fidget spinner another push and the propeller started rotating again.
"I did warn him though not to use that much chocolate." Steve set straight.
"You are awake," Steve greeted him, "how are you feeling?"
But before they could continue the curtain to Tony's bed was pulled back and a doctor and a nurse showed up.
“Did you remember to disinfect the wound?”
At the flat he was greeted by the sight of Steve who sat at the kitchen table, staring at his mobile phone and playing candy crush.
Bruce nodded. He would be the only one to give out books. Maybe except Tony...
Steve smiled as he walked over to the table, Tony trailing behind him. The brunettes eyes widened taking in the sight of the set table.
"You know... He's on the football team and needs enough fuel."
"Well, Good night... Get some sleep."
While Steve started telling him about one of the girls, name Peggy, the others appeared.
"Hello Stark", someone greeted him. Hammer. But he wasn't alone, this time two huge guys accompanied him, most likely bodyguards from his family.
“No…”, he admitted, letting Pepper fix the bandages and help him into a shirt. He was already feeling lightheaded again from the pain. Would this ever stop to hurt?
After he had finished lunch, Tony got up.
"You leaving?"
“Dr. Banner will be here in a few minutes”, he told Tony who gave him a small smile, “try to sleep a little”.
"Since I don't like burgers for breakfast how about some scrambled eggs and bacon?" "Sounds awesome", Tony yawned, "My first class is in an hour..."
"That's not messy", Tony answered between two bites of pizza.
Tony ignored him, trying to put on the stupid brace himself – just that he wasn’t really good at it. Even after nearly four weeks after hurting his shoulder and wearing the brace.
“Enjoy traffic duty with Clint”, he shouted then pulled the door shut.
They met up at the dining hall in their lunch break.
While talking Stark gesticulated widely with his left hand, sometimes Steve saw him flinch, when he moved his right arm. Looking at Stark he also noticed that the man was sweating and his face was pretty pale.
“Come in, Rogers, and close the door”, Fury told him.
"So, lets try this!"
Steve smelled like vodka and other alcohol. And like a girl.
"Sorry, I didn't want to insult you", he pulled out his key and opened the door. Tony followed him inside, carrying a huge amount of bags.
"I have never heard of the sport you call football, but it appears to be popular among the people!" Thor (the big guy) exclaimed.
“Do you need some help?”, the blonde asked him with a soft smile, “you look like you’re hurting.”
"Bye, Tony, Bruce", Peggy added and followed her boyfriend.
"Foul! Foul!" The crowd howled.
Tony groaned, how did he end up on the colleges Halloween party?
He sat down and started drinking his own hot chocolate.
Steve’s guts clenched when the man waved the gun in a somewhat careless manner. The other guy gave out a small whimper.
Whatever that meant. From what Dr. Banner had told him his shoulder was a mess of torn tissue and metal holding together what was left of his bones. Getting shot hadn’t looked that bad in action movies but the real deal was – it really sucked. He basically had a hole of the size of a big marble in his shoulder.
He took a glance at Steve who was shamelessly staring at him. Well, he did have an excuse.
Then he realized he hadn't tripped on his own, he had been tripped.
"Nothing we can do right now, buddy. We have to get you back in the game. Look, he's already getting up."
"Really?" He asked hopefully.

(See the end of the chapter for
He turned around and left the room, leaving Steve to himself.
Since Clint wouldn't stop bothering them they finally decided on doing a secret Santa.
He dismissed his personal assistant with a wave of the left hand and made his way over to the couch. Steve gave a small wave to Mrs. Potts who was already on her way back to the elevator, then followed Stark. The billionaire had propped himself on one of the leather couches, the sunglasses now resting on a couch table made of glass, looking at Steve from beautiful brown eyes. Following Starks orders he sat down at the opposing couch and took out his notebook.
"Oof!"
He did not enjoy that.
Thank you so much for your kind comments and kudos! They make my day <3 Next chapter is up, I hope you enjoy reading as much as I enjoyed writing :)
“I’m gonna call an ambulance, alright?”, he asked the other, “Have a doctor look at your shoulder.”
"I think so..." His voice sounded weak.
"Well, if we are already here, would you like some pizza?" Steve asked, "ours is just finished."
“Do you want something to drink?”, she asked him with a small smile. Tony gave a short nod and she helped him to a glass of water. The small sips were balsam for his sore throat.
Turned out both Thor and Bruce wanted to join the football club. So that left him and Natasha.
„Enjoy it, we don’t get those nights this often“, Steve answered with a soft smile. He knew that Bucky did like those nights as well, just them and the silent noise of the car engine. Sometimes they would stop at one of the dozen good pizza places he knew and enjoy some midnight pizza.
“Yeah…sorry”, Tony mumbled, voice still trembling, “I really hate hospitals. But I guess we could call my doctor…”
“Uhm, Mr. Stark…Tony? This is Steve Rogers, are you here?”, he called as he stepped into the penthouse suite. The sun was shining through the huge glass panel windows tinting the room in a soft light and Steve could feel the faint breeze of the air con on his skin. No one answered his call. Alright, that meant the engineer might already be in his workshop again. Still Steve couldn’t help but be a bit curious about Tony’s living situation. He took a step forward. Ok, no, this was an invasion of privacy. Before he could change his mind and give in to the curiosity, he turned and stepped back into the elevator, this time pressing the workshop button.
After a short silence he added: "I can always work on DUM-E though. I think I'm going to have a big breakthrough soon, so I might spent some time in the lab. They have the necessary tools over there. What about you?"
“This is amazing. You should change jobs and become a cook!”
"Tastes nice." Bruce said but Tony wasn't so sure he meant it because he didn't ask for seconds.
Tony hid under the shower. He didn't want to face Steve any time soon. He had just fainted because of a little bit of blood. It had been Steve who had been hurt and he just collapsed instead. Kinda pathetic...
(See the end of the chapter for
"Better?" Steve asked a few minutes later when Tony's features became a little more relaxed.
“Weren’t you the police officer who found him a week ago?”, Banner asked with a raised eyebrow. Steve could feel his face heating up under the older man’s sharp eyes.
“Mrs. Potts will be here in a minute”, he said with a gruff voice. Steve thanked him and put his hands in his pockets to stop himself from fidgeting. It wasn’t until a solid fifteen minutes later when a young woman with red hair dressed in a neat suit appeared at the front entrance.
“Good morning”, Steve called as he went for the shower. Bucky only gave a grumble and stared at him through half lidded eyes. When Steve came back from the shower he at least looked a little bit more awake than a few minutes ago.
The guy narrowed his eyes.
“Better?”, Steve asked with a soft voice as not to scare the other.
"So, do you wanna dance?" Steve asked looking slightly flustered.
“You know”, Steve smiled, “our amazing dinner date doesn’t have to be at a restaurant. I’m pretty decent in the kitchen and I could cook something nice for us. You could use the time to rest and then we’ll have dinner just as planned.”
As Steve entered their apartment he could see light coming out from underneath Tonys door. So he was still awake... But he had explained earlier that he had some homework left, so Steve just went to his own room. After all they had only known each other for a few hours and it would do no good to start pestering him on their first evening.
“Hand over your money!”, the thug demanded and Tony had noticed the small but distinct shake of his hand as he pointed a gun at him. Probably was his first time robbing someone, Tony wasn’t even sure if that guy knew how to use a gun.
(See the end of the chapter for
He pointed his camera at Tony.
“Honestly, a lot better”, Tony sighed, “I have to admit sleeping really helped.”
“So, did you sleep well?”, Steve asked while soldering to wires together.
“I don’t even know that guy! He isn’t that bad, but you can’t ‘like’ someone you don’t know”
“Then make him your boyfriend! From what I hear you’re both stupidly in love. But since I’m your best friend, I’ll gladly put up with an entire game night of Steve-pining. I bet it’ll be hilarious. But also, I got money on you getting laid before your birthday, so please…”
They finally agreed on X-Men and it had been Tony in the end making this suggestion.
"Oh, and of course I'm going to pay for those glasses", Steve explained.
“I’ll take Steve”, he finally muttered, “Thanks. I’ll pay you, of course.”
The last time Steve had done the shopping so there was enough green stuff to make a soup. He stated chopping carrots and ginger while slowly roasting the onions. Adding the ginger he stirred a few times, then he poured water in the pot. Last he added the carrots. Now it had to sit for a while.
“Uhm…more detail would be appreciated”, Steve muttered while scribbling down what Stark just said. The billionaire gave him a small (annoyed) sigh.
“Shoot, I’m sorry”, Tony called, grabbing his hand and looking at the blisters already forming on Steve’s finger.
"It's fine! Just a little nosebleed! Tony just collapsed! We should take care of him!"
"I think so"
Spending time with Steve somehow became an important part of the following weeks. As soon as Dr. Banner allowed Tony to start working again, he did. He knew that Pepper still was carrying a lot of his workload, so Tony tried his best to actually go to meetings and meet the deadlines demanded by the board. During work he messaged Steve. When their schedules allowed it, they met and went out. This way Tony had gotten to know all kind of different museums in New York as Steve was interested in art and Tony enjoyed watching Steve fussing over old paintings. They also managed to discover a few nice places to eat and Tony could finally take Steve out for the once promised date. Overall it felt a lot like dating. But while Tony was 90% sure that Steve was also flirting with him, he didn’t dare to make a move on the police officer. This whole friendship thing was still quite new for him – as in Rhodey and Pepper had been the only ones to put up with his bullshit for so long – and he didn’t want to ruin it.
