The back stiffens, but doesn’t move and stays there for several moments. He’s just about to repeat himself when glove covered hands raise into the air, and the crouched over figure straightens to their full height. As John catches sight of a curly head of hair he’s suddenly reminded of the first time he met Sherlock and before he can dismiss that thought, the person turns and John feels like he just got kicked in the center of his chest. Someone has obviously just sucked all the air out of the room.
§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§
It was just like any other day, hot and dry and for all intents was boring. Aside from scouting rotations, there were no movements going on right now. It was dusk and he had been in the major's tent having a rather heated argument when they heard the siren blare. Enemy incoming, everyone needed to get to their station. James had called out to him, and the only reason he stopped was because James out ranked him. The major had told him to stay safe, he had given a terse nod and went to prepare the medic tent when he had been told he was needed on the field and that someone else was already covering it. He had grabbed his kit and gun and rushed to where he was needed, getting to work immediately. If he had slowed down when his skin started crawling, if he had remembered to take his hair out of the messy bun on the top if his head, if he hadn’t had been so angry before hand, if only if only if only...
Sherlock meanwhile was thinking about what John had said, he already knew that John was off as soon as he had stepped into his room earlier. He was awake when he walked in, the lights had irritated his eyes while at the crime scene, his exhaustion showed even more towards the end of the case, as short as it had been. When you consider John’s military experience, not to mention the past years of living with Sherlock himself, the shift at the surgery should not have been overly taxing, especially when Sherlock knows that the most strenuous case John had was a four year old with bronchitis. John can go almost four days without sleep before he crashes, John has barely been awake for twenty hours.
Anyone who saw it happen swore they saw him glow a faint purple color, before it disappeared. At first they had thought it had meant he died, but after someone had rushed to him they think that that was the only reason he was even alive. He didn't know, he didn't know enough about himself to confirm or deny it. Either way his biology wasn't enough to stop the infection from setting in. However the medic who was treating him had never encountered any kind of sickness or illness in a Fae. Even the specialist they had called in who was a Fae herself, an elf in fact, couldn't help him. The Fae were resistant to almost all human ailments, she had apologized and Blessed him before leaving.
They had just passed back under the police tape and were making their way to the main street so they could hail a cab, or rather so Sherlock himself could hail a cab, but it was inconsequential really, when Donovan shouted after them. Sherlock really did roll his eyes this time, not at all caring for whatever petty insults Donovan was about to fling at him, so he kept walking. The lights were still messing with John’s eyes, and John was obviously getting more tired, with the way his shoulders were becoming more rigid and the lines in his face became deeper, therefore there was no point in hashing it out with Sally.
John has finished with his shower and is now dressed in his pyjamas and dressing robe, a fresh cup of tea in hand, the third since Sherlock and John had walked in the door an hour ago, Sherlock in the meantime had been sitting perched in his chair with his knees pulled up to his chest. Sherlock was determined to be patient, he wouldn’t rush or force John into answering anything that would cause unnecessary stress.
John had been up here for an hour and a half already, he should have been asleep. John masturbates in the shower, not in his bed, so that isn’t it. Sherlock doesn’t hear or see any signs of a nightmare; no accelerated heartbeat, no sweat gathering on his skin that Sherlock could currently see, nothing. There is no logical reason as to why John should still be awake, if he’s usually asleep within twenty-eight minutes of coming up then why? But once again it could be figured out at a different time, for now, the game was on.
“Is that what?” the stranger says, walking towards John. John has to remind himself not to be intimidated by the fact that this person is taller than him, most people are, but he absolutely towers over John. However, John maintains eye contact with the dominant male, and says in a steady voice, “We’ve only just met and we’re going to go look at a flat?”
By the time he starts primary school John’s hair reaches just to the tops of his shoulders, not that he minds, John kind of loves his long hair. The girls all thinks it’s pretty but the boys tell him that he shouldn’t have long hair, that that’s something that only girls do, but John pays them no mind, and by the time he’s eight his hair is long enough that his mum can braid his hair into designs and patterns and then the boys think his hair is cool then. When John is ten half the boys he goes to school with all have shoulder length hair too. Though his is to his shoulder blades.
What had happened to Sherlock while he was gone, while John had been mourning and crawling through his day to day life? While John wallowed, Sherlock was all around the globe dismantling Moriarty’s web of killers, working relentlessly to keep how many people safe, both those that Sherlock cared about and an infinite amount of nameless other people who probably never even knew they were in danger. John felt his knees go fuzzy with the staggering knowledge.
Hi guys! So I just wanted to let you all know that this chapter is just some more world building essentially, and the first meeting. It's pretty much the first episode through a different lenses, and all the dialogue is from the shows manuscript. There's a little bit of a recap from last chapter but hopefully I didn't repeat myself too horribly. Anyway, enjoy :)
“We can discuss the matter here, away from those whom you might not want information in the hands of.” Crane’s voice was higher in pitch and more on the androgynous side than any other male Sherlock had encountered before him, but again, spend enough time in one’s presence and you don’t even notice these things.
“Bit different from my day.” John spoke as he glanced around, taking in all the new and not necessarily shiny equipment that was placed on different work stations.
Sherlock reaches out for John’s arm, what he was planning on doing was beyond him, maybe to sooth, or to take John away quickly, possibly to restrain if it came to that. What happens though is that Sherlock is shocked, his already wild curls fraying around the edges, his mouth opening in a gasp of not quite pain, and then he’s frozen. Not literally, but Sherlock can do nothing more than breathe and move his eyes, which are now darting to and fro in panic.
“Is that it?” Curly turns, to look at John, face blank.
It’s May now, it’s finally starting to warm up and John takes more walks to enjoy the weather before it gets too rainy again. Sherlock doesn’t often care for nature in the way the John seems to, but he does so love to watch John. Loves to watch the way the sun lights up John’s hair, the way that animals are drawn to him, like those god-awful Disney princesses that collect talking and singing rodents; really the only reason Sherlock even knows that much is because John had had to tell him these things when a killer had been targeting woman who bore any sort of resemblance to a Disney princess. That had been a strange case indeed.
“Angel and Crane, just the demons I wanted to speak with.” Sherlock intoned as he approached. The Dominions both turned to stare at him simultaneously, but Andromalius was the one to speak. He spoke with a slight Greek accent, and a voice that was surprisingly soft if you hadn’t already had contact with him. “Sherlock, what can we help you with this evening?”
“John? John what Fae are you? Maybe if I knew I could help, because, well it appears there’s something wrong. Something you can’t control that maybe others of your kind could help with, but I haven’t been able to find out what you are. And you can’t go around,” Sherlock paused briefly to search for the proper word to call what John had done, “intimidating everyone who says something about me, as… satisfying as it was to watch, it’s unacceptable, especially since this had never been a problem before.”
As Sherlock approached the building he could see the glamour fall away, to non-Fae it looked like any other abandoned warehouse, to Fae they could sense what dwelled inside. Only those who were truly desperate went inside, or if you were Sherlock then you had saved probably half the Fae inside so they all owed you favors, and demons always had to repay those. Not that Sherlock has gone to any of them before, but he figured if there was any reason to start collecting it was to determine what was happening with John.
“Sorry,” Mike said shrugging with a little smile, “it’s in my coat.”
He won’t though, at least not yet. It was hard enough loving the man the first time around, John will always love Sherlock, until the day he dies certainly, but John doubts whether or not he will ever be in love with Sherlock again. But only time will tell that, so instead he goes about taking care of Sherlock’s injuries. John has the man remove his trousers so he can take care of the gun wounds and physically recoils at the extensive scarring there. John shot straight through the fatty part of Sherlock’s thighs, no risk to arteries or tendons, a clean through and through shot that would heal with a very small scar if any; it takes a lot of force to cause scarring in Fae.
Sherlock is staring at him, searching his eyes and face, and John lets him, takes in the appearance of the man in front of him as well. He looks gaunt and pale, his face sunken and his usually beautiful elvish features are sharp and painful to look at now. John glances down noticing just how torn and haggard Sherlock’s clothes are, notes the bloody tie that is wrapped around his right thigh and the scarf wrapped around his left, before looking back up at Sherlock. He has such a tender expression on his face that John really just wants to kiss him.
All Fae have a Craft, a gift of sorts, and no Craft is quite the same as another, not even those that have the same Craft. Most species of Fae have Crafts that are more common among that specific species. Elves are known for their healing, dwarves for craftsmanship, demons for magic, things of that nature. That doesn’t mean that demons can’t heal though, or that elves can’t craft anything since they rival dwarves in that regard. Some Fae can also have more than one, it isn’t too common, but it happens often enough that you’re not a pariah if you have two.
“Yeah, I know, I got fat.” It was said jokingly, and even as John responded with a hurried, “No, no”, and a shake of his head he couldn’t help but think that yes, Mike had indeed gained a pound or fifteen.
Also, I'm sorry if the characterizations are a little off, these two are fighting me really hard, but hopefully it isn't too cringey. If y'all could bear with me then I would be eternally grateful.
He and John both stop dead in their tracks, along with every other Fae in the vicinity, not that there were very many.
Sherlock blinked owlishly for a moment. “What? What don’t you know?”
Sherlock tunes John back out at that point, piecing the puzzle together. The woman, whose ID has yet to be found was obviously on her way back home from a night of clubbing with friends, getting over a bad breakup. Gordon was an idiot, and he decided to let the man know that now since he was asking if Sherlock had anything. Of course he did, it was insulting to even doubt that he did.
“I don’t know what Fae I am, I’ve been trying to figure it out since I was little and no one ever knew or was able to figure it out. I gave up looking for answers after I joined the army. It didn’t matter anymore, I didn’t have to know what I was in order to follow a command, and that was really all my COs cared about.”
John cut Sherlock off with a decisive, “I don’t know.”
When John woke it was to freezing cold, he had never experienced cold before, but it was dreadfully uncomfortable. He was hungry and shivering and so like any baby cried, he cried and cried, but his beautiful, radiant mother never came, his handsome, reliable father never came, so he cried more, until all that would emit from his mouth were soundless screams. And he slept again.
(See the end of the chapter for
, it says. “And John is right, the head wound isn’t the cause of death, you can tell by the way the blood appears around the wound. Your victim suffocated, or rather drowned, one of her ribs was broken at the beginning of the scuffle and punctured her lung. Find the ex, arrest her then find me a better case, one that’s actually worth me coming out at this time of night.”
“I play the violin when I’m thinking and sometimes I don’t talk for days on end.” Curly looks up at John when he asks, “Would that bother you? Potential flat mates should know the worst about each other. ” He gives a fake smile then and it’s so very not charming John almost turns his nose up. John also isn’t sure how he knows what sort of smiles this man has since he’s only just met, but that smile in particular was so forced it was obvious it was fake. Either way he looks over at Mike with a stunned and slightly disbelieving expression on his face.
John pushes the door open, setting the bag down in the entry way, quickly shrugging his coat off just in case he needs to fight. His gun which he now kept securely in the back of his pants at all times came up as he walks slowly through the flat, coming to a stop once he’s reached Sherlock’s old bedroom, which he has long since commandeered for himself. He still, after all this time, hasn’t been able to bring himself to get rid of anything. So aside from the occasional dusting and linen washing it remains unchanged, it even still smells like the man. His scent is especially helpful when John has bad days, he’ll take an old shirt or sweater or his dressing gown and he’ll wear the garment and fall asleep like that. But John digresses. He can think about how far he's fallen after the intruder is taken care of.
John takes another sip of his tea, sighs, and slumps back in his chair. “Tired, honestly, with a pounding headache. I’ll probably head up to bed after I’m finished with this cuppa.”
Sherlock, as he has identified himself as, clicks his tongue with a wink, calls an “Afternoon.” to Mike who nods his head, and leaves, the door closing behind him with a slam. John looks over at Mike who says with a smile, “Yeah, he always like that.”
The NSY stares on in trepidation, though no one else dares to move to try and stop John. He doesn’t walk really, more like he strides across the air to be directly in front of Sally, within arms-reach. Nobody can hear what John is saying, all they see is the terrified look on Donovan’s face, the way she falls to her knees and stares up into John’s face as he brushes his fingers across her cheek, the way objects are starting to float; cars, equipment, even a few people have started to hover off the ground a bit, not much but enough to be disconcerting.
“I prefer to text.” John rolled his eyes at the reply.
“John.” Sherlock starts, but John knows what’s coming and heads him off before he can get started. “Sherlock I’d really rather not-”
Hey guys, sorry this chapter was so late, but between my mom's birthday, Christmas and my grandmother's birthday, my other grandmother's birthday a couple of days later, my sister's birthday and New Year's Eve, New Year's day, my mom going into labor, family flying into town, my dad and sister's birthday, my brother's birthday, and my other brother's birthday, I have not had a chance to even breathe let alone write. But we are back to regular updates now.
John is crouching next to the victim, listing off facts for Lestrade as he studies the body. “Female, not fae, approximately twenty-five years of age, brunette, intoxicated if the smell is any indication. The side of the face is concaved, mostly likely from blunt force trauma, something rounded but also large, however that doesn’t appear to be the cause of death, more like overkill. Defensive wounds on the arms and blood around the nails, see if your team can get any DNA from that. Also, more bruises on her arms, legs, and torso, but these are older, looks to be in the last stages of healing so she’s had them at least a week or two -”
What he does remember though is that one of the older boys, he had brown hair and brown eyes with very crooked teeth, shoved him. John had almost hit his head on the pole for the swing set, he had scraped his knees on the mulch and gotten splinters in his hands. His Craft had created a shockwave that blew the other boy halfway across the park and had given him a concussion. His parents rush over to him, and they take him home. He says he’s sorry and that he didn’t mean to hurt anyone, and that he has a headache and wants to sleep.
They are still walking when Sally shouts after him again, but the key difference is in what she says. It’s an insult, an insult that actually borders more on a curse than anything, and it’s said in a universal language known to all Fae, like it’s been hard wired into every Fae in existence. Sure, each type had their own individual languages, and some even had different dialects in each just like with any other human language, but this one, it was how Fae of different species communicated. Where Donovan had even learned such a word was beyond him.
It had been half a year since Sherlock’s return, and they were on a case, when the proverbial shoe finally, inevitably begins to drop.
(See the end of the chapter for
, wearing a vest of explosives. Or the Woman, when he started to suspect John’s thoughts and feeling on Sherlock himself. Or the Hound when Sherlock finally admitted, to himself at least, how he truly felt, and to John that he was invaluable to him, or as close as he could make himself say. Or the Fall, the Fall and everything that came with and after. He was blind, the worst kind of ignorant, and now he was going to see.
The first time John ever uses his Craft, he is six. He is playing at the park close by the swings with two other boys and a little girl who he remembers had very pretty hazel eyes. His parents are sitting at a wooden bench talking about whatever things parents talk about while their children are otherwise occupied. There are older boys playing around in the field and they come over, though John doesn’t remember what it is they initially wanted.
Not that it was late, but John, who was supposed to have been asleep would even have to agree that getting out of bed to come to a crime scene that was a three was a waste of time. Sherlock turned on his heel, calling out to John to follow, which he did diligently, just like always.
“How are you feeling John?” surely not the most subtle Sherlock has ever been, but that isn’t what he’s going for right now anyway, direct questions would have the best results.
There had been all manner of animals out, and while most creatures weren’t as wary of Fae as they are of humans Sherlock had never seen them in such abundance before, and they were all centered around John. Sherlock had never seen anyone wrestle with a red deer stag, or any type of stag really, before he had met John. Had never seen anyone chase after small forest creatures like red foxes and European hares. Or wood larks, red kites, common chaffinches, and butterflies and other flying insects alight on outstretched hands like they did for John.
Throwing on his coat Sherlock rushed down the stairs and out the door. His first stop is a demon lounge in a refurbished warehouse right along the Thames. He knows the owner and a few of the Dominion’s who frequented the lounge, he knew he would have at least one lead by the time he left.
That was how he lived for two years, floating through life.
Angel motioned to sit and he conjured a tea set from the early Qing dynasty, Sherlock was slightly impressed despite himself. “Now,” Angel began, “what can we do for you Sherlock?”
, he doesn’t know what kind of power John is capable of.
And then John is angry, so very, very angry he feels like he might explode, he doesn’t notice the massive energy field he’s generating, doesn’t notice the walls rattling and shaking. John pulls the trigger twice, shooting Sherlock or whoever this is clean through each thigh. Sherlock gasps and goes down to his knees but continues to stare at John with such emotion filled eyes that John’s anger momentarily fades. Sherlock –because it must be him, after all why would a demon appear as Sherlock to break into his flat to steal something from a wardrobe that would hold nothing of any real value to anyone but he and Sherlock unless they were after crappy disguise material or the shirts that John so carefully maintained over the past two years– is looking at him as if he would gladly take a few more bullets and still be delighted to see John.
Or maybe the elf is clairvoyant or has a Craft of the same sort, which John hadn’t thought about until just now, they did sometimes have that ability, though John has never seen it used like this.
Sherlock tried not to dread that day.
John drops the gun, his hands shaking too much to be able to hold it any longer. Both hands go to cover his mouth because he feels a scream coming and it’d be best to not make Mrs. Hudson think he’s getting murdered, if the gun shots didn’t already alert her to something being wrong, but even if he’s not he must be hallucinating because Sherlock is
In hindsight, he should have known, it seems that it’s always a case that tilts their world on its head. That very first case when John had shot someone for Sherlock even though he barely knew him. Or the pool when Sherlock had felt utter betrayal before his heart had stopped at the sight of John,
Sherlock, but the stupid idiot genius didn’t even know and now he never would. John didn’t move from the bed for three days following that, and when he finally did it was to find something to eat, to shower, to attend Sherlock’s funeral in a haze, and then to go back to Sherlock’s room and wallow in his misery.
§§§§§§§§§§§§§§§
John honestly can’t believe this person, who still remains unnamed, as if he isn’t aware that that is rude. This presumptuous arse. John looks over at Mike, who once again has that sly expression on his face that John really just wants to smack. Curly also glance over at Mike, but quickly looks back at John.
“You’re welcome.”
“No,” John said resignedly. “I’m afraid he’s just like that. We’ll likely all see exactly what he was up to any moment now.”
"We have to wait for nightfall," Sherlock responded.
“Okay?” he asked John.
"Oh," was all John could manage.
When he finally reached the room in which the body had been found, Sherlock was already crouched near the wall, making strange marks on the floor with a piece of chalk. John moved over to him and glanced down at the marks, but could decipher no meaning from them.
Glancing back at the source light, which was still making his head ache, he found that the sun had only just risen. The light was still diffuse and muted (he dreaded full brightness, certain his head would split open), which meant he still had at least an hour or so before his first patients would arrive.
“What?” Sherlock leaned even closer.
Shaking, John picked up the pencil and wrote an almost illegible number eleven on the page beneath the chart.
“Stop,” Sherlock growled.
He had scooted himself back to give John some space, but he still couldn’t stand to meet his eyes. However, he needed John to know the plan. He needed John to remain safe until the end of the game and the best way to do that was for Sherlock to take the last dare and for John to take the last two truths.
"Seen a lot of trouble, I suppose," Sherlock continued, stepping forward.
The silence stretched out between them. John stared at Sherlock, trying to reign in his rising frustration and anger. Sherlock stared back, his face unreadable.
"The crime scene," Sherlock replied as though this were the most obvious fact in the world.
He was so engrossed the in the text he had chosen -- an in depth analysis of medicinal uses of plants and herbs -- that he hadn't noticed how much time had passed or what Sherlock had been doing. His attention was returned to the world around him, however, when a beautiful melody caught his attention.
“Eight,” Sherlock said. “You should know. You’ve been writing them all up.”
The creature was still for a breath. Then, without warning, it leapt toward Sherlock, its teeth bared and its arms, which ended in deadly looking claws, extended.
"Hurry," Sherlock huffed, tugging the man backward toward the land.
His throat constricted with sudden panic.
He had been a marksman, that was clear. Probably military or hired assassin. Maybe both. He had known enough about the human body and injuries to correctly predict how John would react to each of his dares. He had kept him alive, but just so.
“Very good boys,” the voice sounded far away to Sherlock.
"Could John wait until his lung has recovered?" Sherlock asked, noting the tension building in John's demeanor.
“We’ll need a splint,” John said finally. “It will have to be big enough to hold the whole leg. You won’t be able to align the bones if it is compound. But if you can find something big enough to hold the leg, we might be able to move… slowly.”
"Where are we?" John asked.
"Be ready," he murmured.
"We're going to set up a trap for our murderer," Sherlock said, making his way through the deck and down a set of creaky stairs.
John laughed. Sherlock’s heart lightened a bit to hear it. He hadn’t heard John laugh in weeks.
But his body ached and his mind seemed to simultaneously race with thoughts and hollow out whenever he tried to catch one. It was a bit amazing. He never knew he could feel so many things at once that he felt nothing at all.
“Before I met you,” John said finally, “I was… I was so alone. You changed my life. You can be such an ass and a pain, but underneath it all, you are a good man. You are brilliant, but as much as you try to hide it, you care about people. People say you are a machine—that you aren’t even human. But I know better. I know you for real. You are the most human… human being, that I have ever met. I owe you everything, Sherlock and you owe me nothing.”
“The pain meds are working just fine,” he says.
“We have to move,” Sherlock was staring at one of the tunnels, facing away from John.
Setting his face in as neutral an expression as he could, Sherlock turned on his heels and faced John.
“I need access to the crime scene,” Sherlock said.
He hadn't known then how prescient those words had been. How often John Watson would throw himself into the line of fire.
“And John?” Mycroft asked.
And squeezed.
Sherlock stared back at the clearly worn out man in front of him--bags under the eyes, slumping shoulders, lines on his face from habitual stress. He calculated.
John rolled his eyes. "Why don't you work on one of the ten thousand experiments you've got cluttering up our kitchen?"
Sherlock pauses, processing what he’s just heard and the sight of John collapsing further in front of him. It takes him a moment, but then…
“Like the Batman villain?” he choked out.
His eyes scan the room. Something is off. Strange. But he can’t figure out what. The whole room is strange, of course. What would a room full of tables with random objects be doing in a disused warehouse? The game, of course. But then…
Sherlock shot Moriarty a look, but kept his mouth closed.
John smiled.
"He won't say," John said, glaring at the man, who refused to even look up from his lap.
Sherlock whirled around, glaring at John.
"And yet," he continued, "John would hear no argument. He entirely dismissed any sensible discussion about the risks outweighing the potential benefits. He refused to listen to a word I said about it, in fact. He just signed the damned consent forms and then refused to talk to me about it. Why? Why was he so adamant about this? Why wouldn't he listen?"
Taking a deep breath, Sherlock made his decision.
"No," Sherlock said slowly, "but I thought it likely. Hearing damage is common with blast injuries. In addition, you were showing clear signs when you last woke--ignoring sounds outside of your line of sight, having trouble understanding me unless you could see my lips, not noticing other people in the room. I spoke with your doctor after you lost consciousness last night and he set up an appointment with an audiologist for tomorrow morning."
John glared at the fire, trying not to be annoyed. He was just contemplating trying to find a kettle when the door burst open again. Sherlock moved slowly into the room.
“Advice,” Sherlock said with a sigh.
They reached a fire escape and the stranger tugged him up, then through an open window and toward another staircase. Before John had worked out where they were going, they were on the roof. At some point, the stranger had let go of his hand and was now running toward the edge of the roof. Without thinking, John followed and was just behind as the stranger leaped, clearing the gap between the buildings and landing on the next roof.
Sherlock glanced at the man for a moment, then turned his attention back to Dr. Ramar.
Molly paused for a moment, examining Sherlock closely.
Sherlock shoots him a look, but then returns his attention to the room.
"Brilliant!" John said softly, shuffling through the papers again.
His eyes flew open and he stared in open shock at their now entwined hands, not quite believing what he had felt. Then, when he was certain he wasn't hallucinating, he looked up at Sherlock's face.
"You're being stubborn and it is going to get more people killed," John shot back.
The finally reached the dock and collapsed, both panting for air and shivering.
“Have you ever had a lover?” the voice asked.
"They're just scratches," John said, pushing himself up on his elbow with a grunt.
"Palace officials are paid well," Sherlock continued. "And one particular employee would have easy access to a greenhouse with plenty of space."
"...calling in a specialist to assess...jump to any conclusions...level of injury...later today..."
, he was so angry! It was unfair. He had already been through this once. Wasn't that enough? Hadn't he already lost enough? Why was this happening again?
“Is he okay?” She softly asked Lestrade.
“Lestrade,” Sherlock begins angrily.
"Now we use my own resources," Sherlock said, "to see if we can catch a vampire."
"Is it possible to catch a falling star," he asked Mrs. Hudson.
"Can we have a word?" John asked Irene.
"What is that for?" he asked.
“Can you show us where the intruder fled?” he asked finally.
He rounded a corner and pushed through a door without noticing where he was going.
“Well,” the voice said slowly, “he definitely won’t survive a bullet to the head.”
“Sherlock!” John yelled, firing a bullet of his own into the depths of the shaft.
“Ah yes,” the doctor said. “That isn’t looking very good either. Same sort of situation. There was an… incision.”
“You stopped Sebastian,” John breathed slowly. “You didn’t let him… hurt me again.”
"What's going on?" John didn't take his eyes off Sherlock, who appeared completely oblivious to the slime oozing from all over his body.
“Oh no,” the voice stopped him short. “No helping him Sherlock. This is his dare. He has to do it on his own.”
“It would seem,” Mycroft continued, “that your man has an ally.”
Sherlock shifted his stance, looking uncomfortable and guilty and John pulled his focus back to him.
He needed to do something! He needed to solve a case. Catch a murderer. Dash through the streets of London with John.
An then the nurse had caught his attention and he had barked at her to get John oxygen and to call for the doctor to check him for further damage.
"No," John confessed. "It seemed scared, so I... I stopped."
“I need to know everything,” Lestrade prompted.
"Er, right," John went back to eating.
"Good," Dr. Azarian looked down at the chart, "you're scheduled to meet with an audiologist this afternoon, so we should be able to set you up with something to help with your hearing soon."
Sherlock shook his head. What kind of idiot—or genius—were they dealing with?
Rather than the moorland where he had entered the castle, John found himself looking out on a completely unfamiliar port town, bustling with morning activity. He moved to the door and opened it, sticking his head out. He was looking at the moorlands, a few kilometers north of where he had entered the castle. He shut the door and moved back to the window. The port town bustled with activity, birds landing and taking off from docked ships and children playing in the streets as their parents tried to round them up.
"I... I don't have much money," John said slowly, "but you can have..."
"John!" Sherlock's voice cut through his panic. "John, look at me."
Sherlock paused, looking hard at John.
Sherlock’s eyes shoot open. Five minutes? How could he possibly deduce the combination that quickly?
“Goodnight boys,” he heard Moriarty say in his sing-song voice as he lost consciousness. “See you soon.”
"Perhaps," Sherlock was examining his work, "but this is more certain."
“Nope,” Scarecrow answered. “Them’s the rules. Take it or leave it.”
"Why not?" John asked, glancing up from the book.
"Wizard Holmes, I..." John began.
Ignoring this, Sherlock reached for the items sitting next to him. Moving as quickly as possible, he removed John’s shirt, exposing his chest. The bruises on his ribcage made Sherlock wince, but he continued without pause.
“I’ll see him now,” Sherlock said.
“Wouldn’t be any fun if you knew all the details, would it?” Scarecrow said.
His entire chest felt as though it were on fire. He tried to groan, but his throat was dry and painful. He settled for wincing and closing his eyes instead.
John shook his head, waiting for Sherlock to explain. Sherlock simply stared at him, as though dumbfounded John wasn't understanding whatever it was he wasn't saying.
"Exactly," Sherlock grinned.
“What happened?” Lestrade asked.
Sherlock's eyes flew open, his brows knitted in confusion.
Then it hit him. Simple! He had been looking at the spell all wrong. Sherlock had said the spell would be simple, but he had been examining it as if it were one of the complex spells Sherlock had described. If the spell were really simple, then perhaps he should have been reading it literally, rather than attempting to find hidden meaning.
She and Lestrade watched Sherlock for a long time, Molly growing more and more worried. His expression is unguarded. He looks angry and sad and anxious.
"I got that," John said, watching Sherlock begin to untangle what he now recognized as a net. "I meant, why did the murderer do this in the first place? A vampire would make sense, but if this isn't a vampire, then why drain people of blood and keep it in buckets?"
“Well done, Sherlock,” he says. “And John. That was almost clever.”
John braced himself for the impact just as the creature slammed into him. His breath left him in a huff and he hit the ground hard, his cane spiraling out of his grasp. He felt the creatures claws tearing at his sides and tried desperately to get enough leverage to push it off.
"Well..." Bryan said slowly, "my uncle was gay."
The woman growled, but continued refusing to answer. Sherlock growled back in frustration and began pacing room.
"I'm not a genius," John pressed. "My mind isn't valuable like yours. My 'transport' was what I was good for."
"Yes, of course," Molly said, smiling at them as they turned to leave again.
The man at the door was young, with blond hair cut around his ears and freckles over his nose. John thought he couldn't have been older than eighteen. He was holding a hat in his hands, twisting it nervously.
Sherlock smiled, happy for the chance to show off after so long being dormant and dull.
"Sherlock,” John sounded exasperated and hadn’t moved from his chair, “what the hell is going on?”
John was staring, dumbfounded.
Sherlock started to meet his eyes, but then the voice sounded once again.
Amelia had agreed to meet them there, using her underground tunnels to come out near the last crime scene.
"Well, you'll have to figure that out," Mrs. Hudson said. "It will take me some time to break your curse, so you can use that time to figure out my contract."
There is no timer in this room. John has as long as he needs to make it across the floor. But the nerve agent is acting quickly. John is clearly already sluggish and sweaty. He needs to move quickly or he won’t be able to move at all.
John’s eyes widened.
He thought about tact. He tried to remember times he had seen John use it with others in similar situations--clients who had experienced some kind of loss, friends who were ill, people under stress at crime scenes. He was typically quiet--reserved and out-of-the-way.
He concentrated on John’s chest. It was moving up and down. He was
Sherlock looked confused.
“Very good,” Moriarty said, clapping his hands together once. “Let’s get started then, shall we. John, you’ll go first.”
"But you can't know that," Molly said.
“Better hurry Johnny boy,” he says. “At this rate you aren’t going to make it, is he Sherlock?”
Ignoring him, Sherlock examined the ground between the trees closely.
Raising an eyebrow, John peaked around the door into the astonishing castle. He could feel the warmth radiating from the interior and see a cozy fire just inside the door. He didn't need any other persuasion.
“And?” Sherlock prompted.
"Kingsbury," Sherlock said dismissively. "The king's city."
"He told you this?" Dr. Azarian moved back to Sherlock again.
John doesn’t move. Sherlock glares at Moriarty, fury pulsing through his body.
"Because you need me," Sherlock said, nonchalant.
“Dr. Watson,” John corrected.
“Nobody,” Sherlock said distractedly.
“Put your good arm around my neck,” Sherlock ordered.
"F... Fire demon?" John asked, leaning forward to get a better look.
But John…
“Scarecrow,” John said, trying to lift his head to see Sherlock and Lestrade.
Impatiently, Sherlock straightened and shouted, “John is in here!” before returning to his work.
Once his upper body was settled, Sherlock turned his attention to his legs. He dreaded moving John's injured leg. He would have to be careful to prevent any further damage, but he was certain that every touch would be intensely painful for John.
“That’s me,” Sherlock said.
Sherlock ignored him. So did John.
Sherlock ignored the voice, carefully cradling John’s head in his hands.
Then, when a mysterious black building appeared just outside of the village, his patients were certain the Witch had left the Wastes to come and torment the towns again. The black mass, with smoke coming from its four tall turrets, would appear and disappear in different locations all around the outskirts of the village--sometimes among the hills, sometimes looming above the cliffs, and sometimes settling in the moors. Some said that, if one watched carefully, they could even see the strange castle moving on its own.
John glanced over at Sherlock, frustration clear in his expression.
"I wouldn't know," Mrs. Hudson said. "I've never seen him with anybody, but he certainly has the power to be charming when he wants to be. I don't think he would every be serious about anybody though. He's quite heartless, you know."
He paused, and this time John was certain of the hesitation. Sherlock licked his lips and took a breath before continuing and, had John not been quite so medicated, he would have been much more worried by this.
He began to shout again, more insistently this time, forcing his suddenly leaden legs to move toward John.  He had moved only a few short steps when a sudden horrific noise and flash of light interrupted his approach.
John sighed again.
“But this game unfairly favors me,” Sherlock said desperately. “John doesn’t solve puzzles.”
“What are you worried about Sherlock?” he asked. “Sebastian will be quite gentle, I assure you. John will not be harmed.”
The fire flared again, but soon settled down.
Dr. Azarian had talked to him about John's leg after he had made the decision not the amputate. He had informed him that there may be nerve damage--that John may lose feeling in some parts of his leg or that it may cause him pain. He said it was impossible to predict nerve damage.
In any other situation, Sherlock would be off after the murderer now, before the clues got cold. He had a rare opportunity to follow a fresh trail.
"A deal?" John asked.
She bared her teeth again.
like bubblegum.
“Sherlock,” Lestrade finally continued, “where is the perp now?”
But he was having trouble feeling too upset at the moment. John hadn’t told him off or told him to leave. John had smiled. He had laughed. Maybe they could make it out of this. Maybe things would be okay. Would go back to normal after all.
This was round nine. Two more rounds and he could get this man out of here and to safety. Two more rounds and it would be over.
Lastrade, looking more exasperated than ever, picked up his headset and began barking orders. Meanwhile, John and Sherlock began pursuing the murderer, who was pushing through the crowd to an alley leading to a set of flats under construction.
“Now John!” Sherlock screamed.
"Wait!" he said just as Sherlock reached the first step. "The man. We can't leave him."
"You... What?" Detective Dimmock was staring in them in open astonishment.
"Yes," John said flatly.
John had never felt more exhilarated in his life. He watched his feet move through the air as though on an invisible road. The sensation was like nothing he had ever experienced. A combination of swimming and gliding. He looked over at the stranger and found him still grinning, glancing behind his shoulder periodically. John looked back as well and found the shadows had stopped at the edge of the building and were now whirring and swirling in a chaotic cluster.
Sherlock frowned at her. What did she mean? Of course it mattered that the risks outweighed the benefits. That was only logical. And he cared because John was making the wrong decision. He... He had stayed because... Well of course he... Why wouldn't...
After the call, Sherlock sets his paper down.
"That makes sense," Molly said. "I won't be able to get a tox screen from the blood, obviously. But I can try the tissue around the injection sites. I may be able to find something there."
The cup was removed and he closed his eyes again, trying to focus on breathing and not on the dream that was still insistently demanding his attention.
“He’s got a collapsed lung,” Sherlock yelled, turning back toward the voice. “You’re asking me to kill him. He’d never survive that.”
He tried the handle again, more out of frustration than hope, but the knob turned easily and the door swung open, nearly knocking him off the platform.
He turned to go again and noticed the rod on which the dog was tangled. He gasped in astonishment. It was a cane!
"Er.. right," John mumbled. "Well, I'm not his date."
“You…? What?” Sherlock was confused. How could John possibly have figured it out when he was unconscious.
So, a maniac, British, soldier/assassin with medical knowledge and…
“John,” Sherlock murmured. “Please John.”
Sherlock's brows knitted in confusion. "What do you mean?"
“Oh Sherlock,” the voice said. “This isn’t your choice.”
“Great,” Sherlock said sarcastically.
John opened his mouth like he was going to reply, but Sherlock stopped him.
Dr. Banerjee sighed again.
, he remembered the man saying. John found himself hoping he would need to think often.
Sherlock shot a glare at Lestrade and continued pacing. His mind wouldn’t stop racing. It was jumping from going over what had happened in the last 24 hours to what was likely happening to John right now. He tried not to think about what had just happened to them, but he was having trouble keeping the memories from invading his consciousness. So, he tried to think of anything that might help him find the monster. Scarecrow.
“It’s okay Sherlock,” John said, his voice tight.
By the time they arrived back at the crime scene, night had fallen in earnest. There was no moon that night and no working street lamps in the run down neighborhood, so John was having trouble seeing even a few feet in front of his face.
John moved toward the body, feeling anticipation rising in his chest. The woman was well dressed in a long robe adorned with lace and jewels. Her eyes were closed and he could see no obvious marks on her.
“Unfortunately brother I can’t give you back what you desire, you need to get clean and if that means taking your... Toys away, that’s what’s ill do. Now if you want to do some actual work, come back to the station, finish your interview and get this case solved.” Mycroft shouted back and Sherlock growled, gripped the phone and hummed. “I can’t interview that omega again Mycroft, I told you what I’ll do if I see it again.” Sherlock warned his self control threatening to slip.
(See the end of the chapter for
Sherlock moved silently so he was stood next to the omega. His hand soothed Over John’s shoulders. “You’re okay now. It’s alright, I know you didn’t do it.” He voice soothingly and then the door opened and both Mycroft and Lestrade stood, ready to restrain Sherlock. Instead the alpha let go of the omega, walked to the opposite side of the room and shook his head disapprovingly at the males.
However Sherlock could sense something else, like total fear. It made his stomach twist violently but as he looked closer he noticed more.
“Were these all omega’s or not?” Sherlock asked and Mycroft shrugged and stared out of them window where he began talking.
"Sherlock I am absolutely serious. Do not make me repeat myself when I say to stay in control in that interview room." Mycroft said this time his voice lowering almost animalistically. Sherlock rolled his eyes, it was an omega he knew the risks and he just nodded like a bobble head being pushed up and down by a bored child "Yah Mycroft I know." He said his high slowly but surely wearing off and the realisation of the situation kicking in.
It was his landlady, Mrs. Hudson. She was sweet enough and Sherlock on his better days wouldn't mind her company, well, for a limited amount of him. But not today, not when he was about to crack a case that he was enjoying. Serial killers were always the best in his opinion. They were so eager to get caught yet so cunning about the way they did things.
I'm so sorry for the quality of this chapter, it's awful please forgive me.
"Mrs. Hudson did you really call my brother!" He growled as he threatened to get angry.
“okay um, did you see anything of importance?” Sherlock asked with gritted teeth as he began pacing. “No.” Sherlock breathed and zoned in on the omega entirely his mind reeled.
He looked at the camera and reached up to turn it out of view before walking to John. “I know it’s hard at the moment, your scared of alpha’s and you think you’ve dome something wrong but you haven’t, I promise you.” Sherlock reminded and crouched down in front of John. They weren’t touching but it was a safety thing.
He closed the bathroom door and grabbed his razor where he started shaving, it had been a long time due to the drugs, he didn't really care for his appearance when on the stuff all he cared for was taking hits and solving cases and that's all he cared for right now but his brother wasn't going to drop this he didn't think.
Sherlock said merrily and clasped his hands together enticing a single clap as his drug induced high began to wear off and the urge to take another hit started. Mycroft remained silent, his foot tapping the ground and his hands placed on his lap as he stared blankly out of the window.
Sherlock looked at the omega, looked at the way it cowered in fear and then mentally scolded himself. “Tell me about your alpha.” John looked up, His eyes puffy and red from crying.
With a freshly shaved face, a long shower and a slight style of his ebony hair he left the bathroom again and scowled at Mycroft for making this happen. "Now what do you want," he said with annoyance lacing his tone. Mycroft huffed and stood straighter than he was doing before. "An issue has arisen and your name was brought up." Sherlock looked confused for a second and then huffed.
Neither of them said anything for a while before Sherlock rolled his eyes and turned to Mycroft. "What are you doing here Mycroft." He asked out of habit.
Hope this isn't to bad, and I hope I captured alpha Sherlock for you all and gave you a little show if his sweeter side...
Sherlock could see it from the moment he entered the room. He could see the terror like it was a wall of glass surrounding this being, this omega. It was unnatural.
Mycroft sensed the lack of interest and stepped in again "It isn't just about an omega though Sherlock, this is also a case." Sherlock looked back at Mycroft, his eyes now glistening with delight. "Why didn't you say so, dear brother." He said as he stepped almost willingly toward the door.
She entered the kitchen to see it had been temporarily renovated into some sort of make shift drug set up. "You're doing drugs again! No wonder people keep hearing you shouting, your probably high, you're not my only junkie Mr. Holmes!" she shouted at the younger man and Sherlock just rolled his eyes and gripped the door which he was still holding very tightly.
“This is the drugs talking Sherlock, trust me, when you meet the omega I can guarantee you’ll be A bit more enthusiastic.” Mycroft assured and Sherlock went back to trying not to think about the high that was slowly wearing off leaving him jittery and shaken up.
Sherlock and Mycroft left bakers street in a black taxi. Mycroft sat up straight and watched his younger brothers actions in what could be disgust but never uttered a word to him about it. This was different. Usually, Mycroft would mention his drug habits, he would mention his appearance but not this time. Which meant Mycroft was doing his best not to antagonise Sherlock, curious...
He stood up and breathed before waking over to the landlady and putting his hand in her shoulder. “I didn’t mean to be like that it’s just, difficult.” He gritted out as he searched for his phone and Mrs Hudson left quickly wanting to give Sherlock privacy.
“I may be a sociopath but it was a crying omega, my instinct to comfort aren’t all strange you know.” He said as the omega wiped it’s tears and stared blankly at the scene infront of it. Sherlock strolled out of the room, stopping next to Mycroft.
“My name is John Watson. I found my alpha dead, bits of flesh surrounded his apartment. I know from the second I walked in it was his flesh because when I found the body it was almost unrecognisable.” John shuddered and whined quietly in fear probably.
Sherlock breathed and placed his hand on the table, his alpha instinct to comfort was almost overpowering, the scent of the omega was intoxicating and the way the poor thing looked made Sherlock want to claim right there. The alpha stood and looked at the camera. His face strained and his body shivering with the need to claim.
"Is this about some sort of omega." He said with boredom, Mycroft nodded and Sherlock huffed again this time with an exasperated sigh. He may be an alpha but he cared very little for omegas. He was a high functioning sociopath, not a fairy wrapped in cotton wool that liked to feed and nurture omega's.
“I won’t, thank you for your kindness, alpha.” John whispered and Sherlock hummed.
My suggestion on the development between Sherlock and John be lovely and comments are always welcome.
Sherlock growled at the repetitive knocking on his door. Not only was he trying to enter his mind palace he was also an Alpha who was territorial at best. He stood up, his dressing gown pooling around him clinging to him to his thin but muscular body.
Do you think your feeling brave enough to take this off so I can see what you need tending to. And before you try and lie about it again, I know your in pain, I can tell.” Sherlock said soothingly.
The fear sat on this omega like a pillow over his mouth and nose. Enough air got by it, allowing its body to keep functioning, but the fear was crippling all the same. The omega sat, it talked, it would appear like it always had, but its insides were dying slowly. There wasn’t an omega Sherlock could reference who knew how to handle such abuse, the crippling fear that at any given point he would be struck, beaten, starved or killed by the man he used to call alpha had turned this omega into a statue of its own mind, a statue of fear and terror.
“Im 16.” Sherlock hummed and reached his hand out to lightly grab the material of John’s sweater.
“Something about you that my alpha likes I suppose.” Sherlock said while examining John’s back for wounds. He scanned the area and pressed down lightly enticing a gasp and grunt from John. “Sorry.” Sherlock apologised and then handed John his sweater back. “You should be okay, there isn’t any broken skin on your back or front, although I’m not sure anywhere else. If you begin to feel off though don’t hesitate to get a doctor!”
Sherlock meets the omega
Mrs Hudson gasped and step backwards slightly, not in fear but in self preservation. “Sherlock, your brother’s men came and took it, I couldn’t stop them, I tried, I knew you would be like this.” She wailed and Sherlock growled again, not angry with Mrs Hudson but angry at his brother.
John sat there in fear and stared at the alpha. “I didn’t kill him, alpha. Sometimes I wish I could have the strength to do it, sometimes I wished he would die, the days where he slammed me into each wall, the days where I was forgotten about in the basement. Those were the days I wished he was dead. But I didn’t kill him, I didn’t kill him.” John said in a whimper as tears fell silently and little whimpers of pain were heard.
Mycroft takes away Sherlock's toys
"Sherlock get up, go get changed," he commanded but Sherlock waved him off and stayed draped on the couch he was seeking comfort in. "Sherlock, I mean it," Mycroft yelled and Sherlock sighed again and stood himself up. Slowly and with little purpose, he began walking to his room where he stored his clothes.
“Are you hungry?” Sherlock asked again and John just nodded. Sherlock stood up in a fluid motion and stared at John expectantly. “You want to join me to go get food?” Sherlock asked, it was almost as if he was courting the omega. John just nodded and stood numbly for the first time in hours.
“I’m not going to be able to interview him again unless you want me to pin him up against a wall and bite down on it’s pretty little neck to  make him mine.”  Sherlock gritted out as Mycroft looked taken aback at his brothers words. Mycroft watched Sherlock walk off with a stunned and numb expression and just stared at the omega and then back at Sherlock. What was going on?
When Sherlock returned back to 221b bakers street he could already tell that something was off. The door handle looked cleaner, the windows seemed to have been polished and the stairs which were normally dirty looked to have been swept... his suspicions were confirmed when he walked into his flat to see his drug equipment completely gone and it’s place his  normal kitchen, any trace of any drug totally gone and they had completely cleaned his flat. He actually stood there numbly for a second or two before letting out an ear piercing roar. He entered the flat and went around systematically trashing the place, he gripped the desk form reassurance when he was done.
Comments are always welcome
“We aren’t looking for a motive then, we are looking for a serial killer and we are looking for a reason why this man came onto his list.” Sherlock said as he sat back and watched the car pull up onto the curb outside the interview station.
Sherlock had stared at him while deducing this idea and had immediately straightened up once he realised what he was doing, he clicked his tongue slightly and fisted his hands into his pockets before walking over to his client, pulling out the plastic black chair and seating himself in front of the omega who was almost buzzing with fright at the alpha sat opposite him.
There wasn't an inch of the place that wasn't either covered in dust, paper or some sort of drug. "Sherlock!" She let out and the alpha just smiled sweetly next to her as she looked around the filthy flat.
Mrs Hudson peeked  round the door and Shook her head and looked confused, "No." she said and Sherlock looked back at the door where his brother stood shaking his head disapprovingly. Mrs Hudson came to Sherlock, patted his shoulder and excused her self from the flat and walked past Mycroft keeping her head down.
“My name is Sherlock Holmes, I’m a consulting detective and I’m here to ask you a few things about the murder case your involved in.” Sherlock said, his voice professional. There was little comfort an omega could seek in his tone it was strictly work and Sherlock waited for the omega to answer.
“Your new to being an omega aren’t you, you’ve probably only presented a few months ago so the possibility that you formed a proper bond is dull. But by the looks of you it’s like then alpha might have gotten off on you being in pain, being hurt and whatnot. Your malnourished. Emaciated and extremely tired, you have clearly got bruises that run under your clothes, you wouldn’t be flinching if not. Your alpha wasn’t nice to you was he? He liked to see you in pain. You were terrified on him, you couldn’t have done it, it’s again your every instinct,  he was superior over you, it’s impossible that you could do it.”
"Sherlock, that is no need to talk to me. I came because the neighbor's have been complaining about your shouting." She explained and the Alpha just stood there with a vacant expression on his face as he stared at the annoyance in his way. "I haven't been shouting, Mrs. Hudson." she tutted and walked past uninvited and gasped at the state of the small flat.
“Where there any more suspects?” Sherlock asked his brother after a while. Mycroft hummed and made a hand gesture. “There was the alpha’s daughter, they had a cleaner, we found a suspicious email as well but we weren’t able to track who it was sent from.” Sherlock began what he did best.
Sherlock huffed and turned to his left and walked to the sofa, he collapsed onto it and let out a large exasperated sigh and then looked toward the door where he saw Mycroft standing. "Get out of here Mycroft." He shouted but sensed Mycroft would do no such thing.
“Tell me whatever you like.” Sherlock’s voice had softened slightly, his eyes focusing on the omega for anymore sighs of injury.
“It felt stupid Mycroft! I don’t want to interview him!” Sherlock shouted and Mycroft growled lowly over the phone. “You will go over there and do what you do Sherlock, for god’s sake!” Mycroft threatened and Sherlock slammed the phone down hard enough for it to smash.
“Is that is?” he said slowly after Mycroft didn’t make a move to talk any further. “SERIOUSLY, you brought me room my flat to tell me an omegas blood was on the crime scene! That blood could be from anything, the omega could have had a paper cut and you bring me away from my flat for that?” Sherlock fumed and Mycroft growled at the man he had to call brother.
He arrived half an hour later and stormed into the office where Lestrade was, the omega was still in the interview room. “Where is it.” Sherlock said and Lestrade just pointed to the same room.
He was in a taxi, with his brother on his way to an interview for a case. He groaned and tried to get back into his drug induced high but with little avail.
He paced the room for a while, trying to decide what he wanted to do, did he want to interview the omega? Not really, he didn’t want to risk biting it and becoming an actual mated alpha. It was inappropriate and foolish of him and the omega might not want to either. However, Sherlock had seen the way the omega looked at him and the fear and his instincts wants to change it desperately.
“Mycroft. Has there been any other murderers kept secret like this one.” Mycroft paled slightly but nodded once. Sherlock actually laughed.
“Right, okay... The client is right through here. Sherlock, I know it’s not my place but please don’t be too hard on him.” Lestrade pleaded and Sherlock frowned, his eyebrows pulling together he just nodded once to show he acknowledged the request.
"Why don't you deduce it," Mycroft said with venom, he growled slightly and Sherlock just raised his eyebrow and shrugged before he turned to his bathroom where he knew he would have to freshen up. He knew exactly why his brother was there, he knew exactly what his brother wanted him to do and he knew exactly what he would be forced to go and take a look.
“Sherlock, has anyone told you that being mated is like being high.” Sherlock stopped slightly, he tried to think back to it. “No, why would they be anything like that!” he shouted getting annoyed and angry. He just wants his stuff back.
Sherlock gripped the door handle and walked in with an air of authority surrounding him. “John is it, well I have to come back and finish my interview, apparently. Not that I need more information from you.” Sherlock said with a professional voice. John had looked up and not said anything.
Mycroft gathered his things and waited for Sherlock to appear out of the cab, slowly he stepped into the brisk air and then walked directly into the interview station. Lestrade was waiting for him or spears and Sherlock grunted a welcome to the man. “You’re looking for a serial killer by the way.” Sherlock said with a smirk on his lips at the confused expression they all gave him.
“Okay so we have one omega, two betas and an unknown figure. Most likely that the omega couldn’t have killed the alpha, unless aided by a beta or other alpha, although if the alpha was under the influence of drugs or alcohol he could have possibly been worn down. He wasn’t smothered or anything he clearly was stabbed and cut apart, that shows that the killer has a lifetime of hatred and wants to leave a mark, classic of a serial killer...” Sherlock paused, caught his breathe and widened his eyes... He stared at Mycroft who had zones out at the repetitive talking.
“Okay, first I want to ask you how you found your alpha, I presume it was you who called it in?” the omega nodded and straightened up slightly.
"If you don't stop this Sherlock I'm going to have to get Mycroft involved and you know he will shut this down." She said pointing accusingly at the drug set up. This time Sherlock actually looked toward the landlady and growled. He bared his teeth, gripped the handle and growled. He was high already but he needn't tell her that he just wanted her to leave!
Instead Sherlock tried to occupy himself. “Mycroft tell me about the case.” He said in a rushed voice as his hands began to tremble with the need of another hit. Mycroft stared at Sherlock in utter disgust, his brother had fallen down the rabbit hole and it appeared he wasn’t even able to claw his way out.
So this omega must be a suspect in the eyes of the police but the likelihood an omega could kill or even overpower an alpha was so slim it was almost unheard of, omegas were sweet creatures who needed care and attention. So even if this omega did manage to take down a fully grown alpha it must have been somewhat induced on drugs or something? It couldn’t be the omega, surely.
He looked tired and worn. Cuts and bruises decorate his face but his expression was one of pure fright. His arms were secured around himself as though he was trying to protect himself from the worst possible beating. His hair was messy but that was expected, he had been almost dragged here.
Sherlock walked through the White corridor to a large black door, didn’t seem to be anyone around which was odd so he looker back at lastrade. “They are waiting at the surveillance tapes.” He said knowing what Sherlock meant and then cautiously pulled open the door for the alpha.
