He exhales an annoyed breath.  He pats his leg.  "Okay Sam, I didn't want to do this.  I wanted things to be amicable, and without terribleness, but you leave me no choice."  He snaps his fingers, and I'm confused when I'm released from the cuffs.  My hearts starts beating wildly.  What's he going to do?  "Follow me."
Finally we get to an open place that looks like a garden in the sky.  Two large doors open for us to a room with a grand view of the entire community.  In front of the windows stands an angel, tall, thin, and beautifully dressed, almost pretty.  His hair is long, blonde waves, and his outfit keeps with the fancy vampire theme; long white jacket, to his thighs, with a sharp collar, and over-sized cuffs, gold neck scarf, white pants, and even a white and gold cape.
“No.  I mean, please, Master … I want you inside me while I touch my cock.”  Dean’s breath falls away.
July 31st, 2020
Deans face cracks with joy.  “You did, but it was likely the only way for you to win me from Father.  And uh, I didn’t mind being pillaged by you.”
“By the Gods, Dean,” he says flipping Dean onto his desk and sliding into Dean’s slick-soaked entrance.  Cas’s cock is divine, filling him up, hitting places inside of him and Dean is lost to the arousal, especially with Cas still gripping his cock.
"That is,
me in a way I can understand.
“You can?”
“You got all that from that nonsense?”
Thankfully, Levi stops.  “Okay, got it.  We’ll break for a minute here and let you calm down.”
The angel’s dull brown eyes flicker with realization.  “Oh!  You think I’m gonna—no.  No, Dean.  No one will touch you that way … without your consent.”
“Yeah, well just in case, maybe we don’t go down that kind of ‘what if’ scenario, even if it’s just to give an analogy.  Cas might kill you and as much as I don’t want a babysitter, I have to admit there’s logic in it.  I’ll rest easier when Cas has to go off and you can stand guard.”
“Then how did he petition?”
“Here’s how this is going to go.  You’re getting a dose of this twice a day for every day you’re here.  And you’re wearing this,” he says holding up a piece of black leather with a buckle.  “I’ve been instructed not to do anything else
I take a closer look moving my hand over the palm print next to it.  I can tell it feels like Cas.  "That's you."
“And we’ll be back in time for Mr. Barkenstein’s teeth cleaning?”  Lucifer’s still horrified from the time the dog’s family brought Mr. Barkenstein in after too long between cleanings and he was in horrible pain.  Of course, Lucifer used his grace to fix him up—otherwise the poor dog would have had to have his teeth pulled.  He got the family onto regular cleanings knowing he wouldn’t be there one day, but he’d been looking forward to seeing this dog in particular as soon as he saw his name in the calendar at the vet clinic.
“Then bear this for a little longer.  My cock is so hard, it’s leaking.  Look what you do to me.”  He shows Dean his cock for a third time, Dean smiles, his wet eyes blinking.  Cas resembles the Gods themselves.  “I’m going to sit again, but I’m not likely to get anymore work done with this problem I’m having.  You’re going to watch me stroke myself, maybe that will distract you from your own pleasure.”
I take the angel blade – it is fucking mine – and go on a rant, because a rant is so much better when you’re holding an angel blade.  “What do you mean fucking kill you, Cas?  What kind of bullshit is that?”
me.  I'm his
“I’ll say.  It’s been three
seventy-four more, I start to beg through snot and tears.  "Cas, please.  I'm sorry.  I'm so fucking sorry.  I can't take anymore.  Please, stop."  Take some fucking mercy on me dude.
hard on me, he’s just
"First prayers, a bath, and food.  Then you may."
Cas dictates every part of his life down to whether he can touch his dick or not.  Dean gets this and yet, “You may, Master.”  Dean never says things like, “you may.”  He’s flirting.
"Yes, my Lord."
“You are.  I found you , Sammy.”
When Gadreel shows for Dean’s nightly punishment and well,
“Yes, Master,” Dean says, to display he knows how that one works.  His father was in the military.  “Thank you, Master,” he adds.  “I appreciate it.”
Dean can see what he means on the exhaustion front.  They’ve only been working for a few hours, and he’s already beat.  He keeps going though.  God help him, he wants to see that look of pride from Dreyous again.
“Good boy.  Thank you.”  Daddy takes the bottle from him and sets it aside.  “We’re going to have to put Professor Norris aside too.  You wouldn’t want him to get dirty, would you?”
I can't think about that now though, I have to find a way out of here before Cas expires, and I'm stuck in fairyland forever, married to a prince who's in love with someone else.
“Time for silence now.  I need to think.”  Sam needed to plan their next move. Sam drops Lucifer’s cock. He whimpers in a disappointed way this time.
"I'm not talking like anything.  I'm just stating facts."  He is too.  He doesn't seem to feel anything about it.
Instead of complaining about him expecting me to read his damn mind, I swallow, and start undressing, feeling a bit uncomfortable about revealing to him my raging boner, but he's clearly got one too, so I don't think about it for too long.
Once I'm in position he starts and I thank fuck that Cas
"We can't help Gabriel," he says, his tone that says that's final.
Cas stops.  He turns Dean to face him and grabs him by the back of the neck.  “Dean.  You’re my mate.  I won’t let that happen.  I think it’s inevitable you will end up there from time to time, but I’ll always find a way to get you out.”
At the end of a week, the friendliest face in the Garrison is staring at him when he wakes up.  Dean hates this fucking guy.  “Hi, Dean,” Jack says.
Gabriel appears.  “I told you to stay in the shower.  What are you doing here, Cassy?”
He doesn't answer my question, instead placing his implement of choice down, hanging his jacket.  He begins rolling up his sleeves, which I have to watch for a second.  No matter how many times Cas beats my ass, watching him do that never gets old, or less hot.
“I don’t.  You’ve proven useful.  That’s it.”
Cas now.  Yes, they have all the help they can afford to hire, but it’s not the same as having your alpha.  An alpha can soothe their omega better than anyone else, an alpha can help regulate their omegas hormones, though when an omega’s pregnant it’s harder, an alpha is the only one who can be firm enough to make their omega feel safe.
Dean doesn’t say ‘yes, sir’ to that one.  It takes everything in him not to tell Gadreel to go fuck himself.  He’s getting pretty tired of being a kept toy that’s never played with—not that he wants to be played with; he just wants off the shelf.  “Is it Michael?” he asks, instead.
Hot is comforting.  I've been on the road so long, I feel a bit like a wild animal being won over and it starts with hot.  "This is real good.  Thank you, sir."  Fuck.  I realize belatedly I forgot to pray.  How does this work?  Is he going to keep a tally?  Do I keep a tally?  Will he punish me like Cas's said he could?
"Sammy!"
The first morning, Cas accosts him as soon as he opens his eyes.  “How many times, yesterday?”
Gabriel nods.  “I’ll have lodgings set up on the other side.  Call if you need me.”
"You got it, Cas."  I get to work.  I've never been this close to angel wings before, I can't say what's normal for them or not, but I wager what I'm seeing isn't … great.  There are several patchy spots that remind me of when a human as dry skin.  There are black, and silver flakes, plus the feathers themselves have bent, and stringy hairs, rather than the smooth, uniform nature of the healthier ones.  In other places, the feathers are plain falling out.  It's like his wings are sick.
"Better?" she says.
Dean guesses that’s something.  “No one’s getting that.”
It isn’t long, before the button I sewed on is lost.  I think it just fell off, truth be told, no help required.  I give my shirt to Dean; he knew it was coming.  He takes it gladly.  “I like doing this for you, Sammy.”
When Cas is gone everything about him lingers; his kiss, his opulence, his power, his scent.  Dean cries in a ball in his stupid prison bed.
I don't even make it out the door to the room, but I do get Lucifer's attention, and he finally returns.  I did not miss him.  "You tried to escape.  We have to talk about this. Sit."
“What?  Am I going to lose my mind?”  A sinking feeling in my gut tells me I might already be.  I have another, ‘I-should-throw-this-book-in-the-water’ moment, but the way it’s written, it sounds so much like Dean, it makes my heart ache.  I want to keep reading, like it’s him guiding me through.  Also, I don’t want to lose my mind, it’s my favourite thing about me, maybe there’s an answer to that in here too.
Gadreel’s unchain one ankle from the bed, but his wrists are still bound at his low back.  He’s not going anywhere but onto his stomach.  He tries—Lord help him he tries—but his dick’s too sore for any amount of pressure.  Finally, Gadreel takes a small amount of pity on him.  “I have to do this, Dean but I have leeway to change the position if I feel there’s a need.  If I unchain your wrists, will you behave?”
“I don’t know, but it’s like everything here is the same as it was before.”
“I feel amazing, Dean,” he says, his eyes shining.  “How long do I have you for?”
“Dean,” Michael says.  “It is good to see you again.”
__________________
It could also be why Cas doesn't prefer harsher punishments.  He likes to keep things business-like with discipline, there are far too many feelings at this height – Cas would have a hard time handling them.
“Maybe if you behave.  Do you need the cuffs for this?”
The feeling of
Oh brother, here we go.  I spend the next five minutes throwing pieces of the forest at the cliffside, only to watch each thing vanish. “You satisfied yet, Cas?”
"I could have protected myself."
Finally some spanking around here.  Mock was getting bored!
“No, you were right.  I’m not that well-behaved.  You guys came up with the right motivation.”  It’s no secret how much he hates the dungeon.  It doesn’t need to be a cesspool of human filth anguish for him to hate it.  The ensnaring claustrophobia is enough.
He senses it pleases Cas—don’t ask him how—and he wants to do more.  The thrill.  The softness.  Deep.  Content.
again.”
Cas is charming too.
Dean’s noticed that the figures are very concerned with being, ‘back where they belong,’ like they’re programmed for it.  He didn’t think much about it before but it’s apparent with Gerald’s words.    “All right.  Teach me, man.”
Okay that just pisses me off, because what a dick.  "Look, pal.  You should be so lucky as to have a conversation with me."
As he held me, swaying me gently, it was only more proof for me.  That he could hold me, without extreme claustrophobia suffocating me, told me I was cured.  “I will take you out, okay?  We’ll go somewhere, you and me.  Jack can stay with Grampa Balthazar.  You and I will have a nice time together.”
Cas looks up, beaming at him.  Dean gets shy, but feels warm.  “There’s my boy.  Are you ready to have your bath?”
Cas doesn't comment on my battered body.  He made it perfectly clear last night that if I want to be a lippy asshole, I can suffer the consequences.  "I have spoken with Antoni, you aren't applying yourself."
"What the devil is that?"
.  For the record, I’m gonna repress the hell outta that shit; throw it in a deep, dark hole.  I need to get Sammy the fuck out of here.
And Cas is missing it all.
It's dark by the time all that's done.  I make sure to include,
He’ll do that today, but first he has to attend his appointment at the Omega Care Center.
Dean wants to close his eyes, but he also wants to see what she’ll do.  His curiosity wins out.  Other than the dim light provided by several lines of candles within the tent-like structure, they are surrounded in darkness; Dean looks skyward from the safety of Cas’s arms.  Purple light glows, bursting from nowhere, Teleapài spreads her thin arms wide, eyes rolling back into her head so all Dean can see are the whites.
His jaw tightens.  "No.  It hasn't.  There's always an element of feeling your mate, mostly so you can find one another, but an angel usually doesn't long for his mate like a human does his angel."
I look to Cas.  “New plan.  The kid brings me back.  If the kid really can fly us out of there, we grab Sammy, regroup here, get his help and figure out some way to deal with Lucifer.”  It’s a hodgepodge, bullshit plan, but it’s the only one we’ve got.
"Goodbye, Antoni," I whisper in his ear, knowing Cas can likely hear me.  When I stand up I wink, and he laughs shaking his head.
She doesn't want to tell me.  "They make yours look like child's play.  I honestly don't know how he was standing.  Maybe that's where his extra life force goes?  He is strong."
Dean turns demurely and blinks what he knows are his doe eyes at Gabriel.  He wants the fuck out of here and he’ll use
Cas sets his wine down, setting his hand around the base, running the other through his sweaty hair.  “I will look it all over.  We’ll make sure things run as smoothly as possible for you both,” Cas says.
“But you
Daddy opens his crib, Dean climbs up, and okay yeah he’s feeling a little tired.  How does Daddy always know?  Daddy helps him put his mitts on, and gets him settled with Professor Norris.  “Close your eyes, little bug, and when you wake up, we’ll get ready to have fun with Sammy.”
Cas pauses to catch his green eyes.  “Do you know how much I love you?”
"Fuck that.  I'm getting my angel blade back."
He’s calm and sure when he’s talking about these things, a soft smile spreads on his face at the mention of Michael.  I reach out to pat him on the back, there’s no flinching.  “Looks like three-thousand-year-old dudes, got it right.”
That doesn’t make any sense.  Why do you never make sense?”
I didn’t think of him first.  I thought of me.  Maybe Lucifer’s right about me?
I only feel mildly bad about skipping the line.  I feel like I’m suffocating; leaving it is too relieving.
“Head down,” he says, and shoves Dean’s head to the carpet.  “You stay as you are until I release you.”
actually groan, but he's like, fucked obedience into me, or something.  I'd love a last cheeseburger at least, before we're walking and walking again.
Dean doesn’t like Cas’s disapproving eyes on him.  “How’s anyone supposed to sleep with all the yelling, Master?”  Truthfully, Dean doesn’t really want to sleep.  Everything about being here is exciting.  Plus, Cas.  He’s
Indecent?  I look down and oh.  Yeah, my shirt is sticking to my body, showing off some of my finer qualities.  Cas gets weird about people seeing me.  Watch me get punished and show off my markings?  No problem-o!  Watch him fuck me?  Come oooon down.  But me walking around naked, or in something he finds indecent,
“I—something happened.  I haven’t told anyone,” Cas says.  Dean sits up.  Panicked.  Cas yanks him back.  “Calm down.  Everything’s fine.  I think.”
“Why would an angel do that?”
of how scared I am.  Today was too much of a reminder of my greatest fear.  With Cas out of the room today, it was easy not to follow Cas's orders, but will I really have so much bravery if he's standing there?
Of course, he’d know it was Jack.  Lucifer wouldn’t knock. “Yeah.  It’s me Sammy.”
“All right then.  Shall we?” Cas says.
I nod.  "Okay then.  You can touch it."
“I know you’ve been trying to push me away.  But fuck that.  I love you.  You don’t have to love me back.”
The Cleansing.  What Cas calls the apocalypse.  “Cas, you’re the most formidable angel I know, if you lost the kid it must have been a bad situation.”
.  Who knows?  I know I want the moment as much as I’d kill for a fucking cheeseburger right now.  I dive in for more kissing.
I don't care what Cas says.
to hurt me – I trust more that he will – but I've surrendered to him deeply in our time together.  I accept whatever he's going to do to me.  I take a deep breath, and he presses my palm into the stone.  I know well the feel of grace now, seeping from his hand, through mine, and to the stone.  It stings like a mild acid is flowing through me, and I hiss, but I bear the pain until Cas releases my hand, and we are both left staring at the dark handprint there, that slowly fades to the colour of the stone, looking like it was carved there.  "Cas?"
Okay, point Cas.  He would have “married him” some point around never.  Sex?  All Cas would have had to do was look at him.  But marriage?  Hell no.  He would have wanted to marry a human, not some dick-faced angel.  “Was the ceremony nice?” he jokes.
exactly.  It’s like tuning in to a conversation across the hall.
“Oh, sure it is.  I bet I could pass you around to whoever, and you’d fucking love it.”
The water sucks me under fast.  I don’t mean to, but I struggle, trying to get to the surface.  I don’t.  I never do, but I always try.  I can feel the intent of the water,
I abandon the idea of leaving, but I don't abandon my study project.  I think about just asking Lucifer where we are, and maybe I still will, but having a project it gives me something to focus on, and without the urgency of leaving, I can settle into it; distract myself.  He does help me learn Enochian, and the lessons aren't as bad as I thought they would be.
I still can't get over that they call him
“In the moment of decision, your destiny is shaped.  You just have to decide kid.  You don’t need to know how.  Decide to be amazing and the rest will fall into place, because that’s what you’ll strive for.  That will be your focus.”  He nods into my chest and falls asleep.  Well that’s fantastic.
Dean clasps his hands around the nape of Cas’s neck.  “Am I pestering you?  I thought I was seducing you.” He bends and kisses Cas.  The kiss gets heated.  It’s not long after that Dean’s lying on his back, with Cas’s dick pounding into him.
level he doesn’t understand.  Humiliation kink is a love-hate kind of kink.  At times you genuinely hate what turns you on but when you give into it, the orgasm is worth it—hell even the sexual frustration over it is.
“There’s my nice boy with his nice manners.  Thank you.  You can do that, but you’ll tell Sammy
“And a peach-skinned fire fiend but it’ll suit you.”  Cas’s voice is low.  It’s more gravelly than usual.
“Mmaaarghhuh, Masssster.”  Master is the only audible word.  Dean’s not sure what words he was trying to produce but it’s a hell no for him.
“I want you kneeling there while I work; legs spread, cock proud, arms behind your back and head bowed.”
I don’t know what Sam’s freaking out about, but it’s nice to see he cares about something.  Sammy’s worse than I thought and I already thought he was pretty fucking bad.
“I’ve been waiting to do that all weekend.  I want you back next weekend,” Cas demands.
“Ah.  My social butterfly.”
"Don't talk like that, Cas."
He held a nasty looking stick, otherwise known as a switch.  It wasn’t the first time he switched me and it won’t be the last.  I reached for my necklace.
"A friend of mine's in danger.  I'm too little to save him now.  I need a big person."
"I will, sir."
Hope you enjoy!
Is that supposed to be an apology?  I know it's not.  I also know I need sleep, so I do that.  I sleep deeply, my subconscious knowing he's there, and knowing he's there means I'm really
I look down at my book, turning it over, remembering it’s suddenly this book and not the one I was reading.  That was convenient, but now that I’m left with it, knowing I never picked up this book, I need to know what happened, or if my mind’s gone like Roark said I would.  I search for the other book in the place I know it was and even other places when I don’t find it.
“Okay then, time to remove this.”  With a pop of the key in the lock, Dean’s cock cage opens and with a little pulling and wiggling, Dean’s cock springs free and snaps to attention.  Cas leans in to kiss him.  “Gods, you look.  It’s hard to resist you, round with my child like this.  You’re so beautiful, you’re hard to resist.”
“It’s okay, Decanus.  Take a breath.  Close your eyes.  I’ll do the work, lad.”
Cas seizes Dean’s wrist and Dean plummets into pliancy allowing Cas to do what he will do.  Cas presses Dean’s palm against his dick.  “I’m constantly like this because of you.”
casually.  "I could always leave you in the ocean while I go places."
“All right, Winchester.  Take your pants off.”  Gadreel’s smirking, loving this.  He’s got the bottle of horrible liquid and a wooden hairbrush.  Gadreel would like nothing better than for Dean to let him do something,
Dean is super cute though, and I hope you enjoy my oddity I've written here.
“Sam, the answer is simple.  All you have to do, is choose.”
“Yes.”
“Jeez.  Take me to dinner first.”
But it is a concern.  Dean’s not spent much time around children, except the ones he’s trained for battle.  His mother warned him not to spend too much time on the battle fields, to spend more time learning how to care for his alpha and his younglings, but he didn’t listen.  She was furious with his father for not insisting he behave more like an omega.
"This is important."
Cas isn’t happy with anything at the moment.  Furious, he yanks Dean up, molding him to his body, shielding him from Teleapài like Teleapài might take Dean away.  He burns fire toward her.  “Are either of us infertile?” he demands.
"Good.  So then you understand that I am going to have to punish you for this."
It takes hours to get five freaking minutes.
“Once you reach that level of your training you’ll desire sex for more than the release of it—yes, I know that’s hard for you to believe right now. There will be lots for you to enjoy about it which you’ll just have to wait and see.  When the time comes and you’re ready to have sex with others, there will be rules for you.  But you will need to come at some point, I’ll gauge your needs versus your wants and I’ll give you orgasms to spend—I’m away a lot, we’ll need this kind of system regardless.”
“He’s wrecking everything, Daddy, and not playing the game right.”
We continue and as seems to be the fucking trend in caves, we reach a dark and
Dean understands something.  That instance with Dayamos fucked Gabriel up more than it did him.  He smiles a smirky smile.  “That’s okay, Daddy.  I know it’s just because you love me.”
Cas would never take off on me for no reason.
We eventually find him again, walking.  He's always walking.  What is it with him and the walking?  Can't he fly?  But the real point is, nothing goes to plan.  Not a damn thing.
He nods, crouching down again, placing both hands on top of the water this time.  A gold shimmer snakes from his hands and out over the sea foam, lighting up the ocean with golden brilliance.  For several, intense moments, nothing happens, but then there’s a rumbling and the golden ocean starts to bubble.  “Jack, get away from there.”
He won’t ask though.  Maybe he’s been given poor counsel by his father on omega etiquette, but it’s there and he won’t show weakness.
"Okay.  What is it?"
“Michael, I wish to speak with you, if that should please you,” I say making sure my voice is deference perfected.  If Lucifer taught me anything, it’s how to serve.
Oh.  Dean pulls a breath.  Shit.  That’s hard to come back from.  “All right.  Beat my cock fifty times.  I deserve it.”  Not like it’ll be the first time.  Won’t be the last either.
That sounds important.
“You say that like you mean it literally, but it’s just figurative, you don’t actually need me.  You could go on living without me.”
The way he rambles on, reminds me of a socially awkward guy in high school I knew for a the short two weeks Dean and I went to that school.  The kid thought I was cool, and was thrilled that I was talking to him, and seemed to want to be his friend.
“I-In my room.”  Lucifer won’t stop crying.  While Sam’s expanded in power and shifted alliances, Lucifer’s reverted to the more innocent side of his personality.
Dean accepts his alpha’s word, and they lay together until Cas’s knot deflates.  Dean whimpers when Cas pulls away and then feels like an idiot for it.  “Do you not want me to go, Omega?”
“I don’t expect you to make that a priority, Alpha.  You have many important duties,” Dean rushes to say.  Fuck.  He can’t have Cas thinking that Dean thinks Cas’s life is all about Dean.
It doesn’t matter at this point though, nothing I can do about it and people fucking love Lucifer.  They’ll be happy.
They lay in the sun, watching it disappear for the night.  Inhaling the floral warmth.  And Dean memorizes the cadence of the waves so he can listen to them forever in his mind with the feel of Cas underneath him.
Cas, already aroused to the max, doesn’t take long.  His knot is expanding, bumping against the roof of Dean’s mouth, hitting the back of his throat, making him gag enough to peel more tears from his eyes.  Cas holds his hair by its roots, Dean cries out while simultaneously drinking Cas’s seed down.
“Uh, yeah.”  He swallows.  “Sorry, sir.”
Smirking, Cas applies the cream generously, making sure it’s rubbed into every crook and crevice of Dean’s cock and balls.  Cas’s attention alone feels good.  It’s almost a ‘dirty’ thing, because Cas doesn’t usually pay much attention to his cock.  Omegas should come on their alpha’s cocks.  But Cas likes Dean’s small cock and can’t help the occasional rub or tease.
Never to Father’s face though.  Mary Winchester remained supportive in the way a beta should, but Dean had to listen to her complain.  If Father had told Dean he could no longer serve their army, he would have stopped—not that it would have been a choice in that scenario, but he would have been willing.
Dean explodes into Daddy’s hand as Daddy continues to stroke him, slower now, until the sensation is too much and Daddy takes his hand off and out of his diaper.  “Th-th-thank you, Daddy,” Dean says, remembering his manners.  Daddy will spank him if he isn’t polite, especially after getting to have an orgasm, which is a privilege for little boys and not a given.
The snarky remark is on Dean’s tongue,
“Now.  Or I’ll do it for you.  I don’t need you to do it, but I like watching.”
"You'll read it now, Sam."
Erik speaks up.  “I’ve noticed the frequency of house checks has declined.  It’s worrisome.  People are going to run away with buying things and keeping them in their homes.”
“I know you don’t think much of humans or me, but I can read, Master.”
“God puts out their light.”
Also, THIS.  It's a scene from BDD written by xcaellachx  Nicky and little Michael before BDD takes place.  It's super well done and a tear-jerker.  I am warning you, bring tissue.
Wildly, I reach out to grip a hold, and I do, periodically through my fall, but it’s a series of catch and slip, catch and fall, catch and slide, my body getting battered like I’m a fucking pinball, until finally I land on the ground below with a massive thud.
“I did and it took me to play with my friend.”
“Where should we do it, General?”
They treat his tender thighs to a solid round of ten before one lands on his nutsack.  It’s been a while since he’s been struck there other than for sex-play but just how much it fucking hurts comes back to him real fast.  For several excruciating seconds, Dean is blinded with pain.  His head’s going to explode with it.  He opens his mouth to scream but no sound comes out.  He yanks and rips at his bonds but all it does is make the cuffs dig into his skin.
Cas smacks my hand.  “There’s alcohol in that drink.  You may have some of the fruit instead.”
Outwardly, I remain calm, but inwardly I begin to panic.  I’m already fucking this up.  I was trying to be polite, instead I’ve made it look like I was willing to be wasteful.  The
“I know, sweet boy.  It’s just for breakfast.  I’ll sit him right here, so he can watch you.”
“Stop it, Winchester.  It’s the bond.  It doesn’t take well to mate death or near mate death.  Just another reason we shouldn’t have bonded.”
The window is open. Convenient. I take a peek inside. We’re outside Sammy’s window. More convenient. “Way to go, Jacky Boy. This is perfect.”
“—no.  Leave it,” Cas growls.
He gives me everything I want, somehow knowing every place to touch on my body to make it good, as he kisses me, increasing my need for him.
Great.  Just great.  Dean slinks his way to the tent, planning on an early night.  They move out tomorrow, first light.  Thankfully, Cas isn’t in the tent when he arrives.  He removes his boots, stretching the ache from his toes.  He slides out of his shirt and kilt but leaves his boxers on.  Better to remove temptation.  It’s day eleven.  He’s not sure he can go much longer.  He’s an idiot for getting Paris to wind him up more.
And then, “I promise you, nothing that is ever done to you will be because you didn’t give me or others sex.”
I turn my body the full amount I need, to walk into the house.  I'm not watching him walk away anymore, but I can't seem to take another step forward.  I'm frozen, convincing myself to put one foot in front of the other, but I can't.  After several minutes, I hear Cas call me.  "Dean.  Dean!"

Eventually, Dean could let Michael in or not kick him out depending on the way you looked at it. The battle then became to “not kick him out” as long as he could.  “Dean,” Michael said cool and measured after the tenth time.
“I think we need to find out what happened to Gabriel.”
Dean doesn’t even want to know.
I think he’s
The next things he’s aware of, is Cas setting his dressing-cloak back into place.  All the anxiety from a few moments ago has left him, replaced by the throbbing in his backside.  But then he remembers he called Alpha, Cas and he wants to hide like he is on Cas’s lap, facedown, forever.  He’s not going to get that luxury.  Cas pulls him up to assess him.  Dean can’t see himself, but he knows his face is red, tear tracks stain down his cheeks.

want any hope saving the world, this is your only chance.”
"I couldn't see what he was doing from where I was hiding.  I just saw wings and my friend putting something on the wings."
Jack brings the basket over and hands it to Dean.  He carries on, cleaning up blood and bandaging each part of me.  When he gets to my upper half, he takes the time to smooth my long hair over my shoulder and it feels good.
“Anything else?”
"I could be convinced to remove them if you asked me nicely, Sam."
Unless they have directions.
Cas shakes his head.  “Lucifer’s been able to cloak both himself and Jack.  I should have sensed him back when you saw your brother, when we were sorting through our trouble with the fairies.”  He wrinkles his nose.  “I couldn’t.  Wherever he’s got Jack makes it feel like he’s disappeared from the Earth, which is one thing, but the other is, even when we’ve known Lucifer to be moving around, I haven’t felt his presence.  This time was different, I sensed them for a time, but then it was as before, like they blinked out of existence.  Whatever Lucifer does has a time limit, or perhaps the use of Jack’s powers nulled it.  Whatever it was, it was a lucky break, as you would call it.”
Dean scowls at him.  Asshole.  Why,
There’s a brief moment of suspicion for Dean.  Doesn’t Cas want to sink his cock into him?  It’s been months since that first, epic time—of nine times—hasn’t Cas been dying to relive the good times?  Maybe Cas is still worried about him and healing.  They kissed a few times when they snuggled—there is no other word for what they were doing—in bed together but Cas wouldn’t let it go past that telling Dean he wasn’t well enough.  Yeah.  That must be it.  He must be working Dean in slow.  Well Dean can show him he’s juuuuuust fine thank you very much.
He kisses my cheek understanding what I mean.  "You're going to stay here with me, anyway.  I missed you all day.  Have you learned your lesson?"
Which means something took them, somehow.
I'm so glad people liked him!
Makes him far less murder-y.
I roll my eyes.  Yeah, right.  This guy’s annoying, but I like being annoyed by this guy, it feels the same as it did to be annoyed by Dean.  My heart squeezes.  I think of Dean
That is decidedly inconvenient. “We’ll figure something out. C’mon.”
His bum still feels a little store this morning, and that should have him on his best behavior, but with the mood he’s in, he’s not likely to escape getting spanked today.
"You can still help, after you eat, and if you wear your collar."
I shrug.  “He said dragons were super rare, but now that we’ve got two dragon family members, he’s going to have to admit he was wrong, and boy does Cas hate being wrong.”
Fuck.  I can’t think about it.  I’m not an idiot, I know Lucifer has tortured the fuck out of my brother by this point and still is.  Thinking about it makes me too crazy.
I never fight, but this time, I fight. The fight possesses me.  I'm ashamed of what I do next.  I call to him.  "Please, Lucifer.  Stop!  Wait.  Stop!"
His eyes are glowing blue and his naked skin is glistening, still wet.
They honestly believe their value system is further developed than these alleged people who are ‘hoarding riches’.  Which is kind of preposterous.  No one in this
"Why were humans on a council for magic?"
Defiantly, I undo my belt and yank my clothes down, getting over the bed like he was.  I mimic my brother in every detail, down to the way my boots point one toward the bed and one at a thirty-degree angle from the bed.  I bury my head into my crossed arms and wait, the cool air rippling across my skin.
“It is your toy, and I won’t make you share your really special toys if you don’t want to, but you’ve got to let him play with something.”
Cas doesn’t do anything for long enough, that’s a turn on, on its own.  Dean’s stood there, his ass out, the wind breezing past it, on display, leaking like a faucet.  He’s rewarded when he feels the drip into his nuts as they fill.  He sighs relief.
The next few days fall into a rhythm like that.  I suck him off every morning and night and he fucks me several times a day over some surface, while poor Sam waits on us, and then spends the rest of his time fuming, staying away from us, but also keeping an eye on me.
"There is nothing I can do for you, I'm afraid.  I am on a mission for Father.  That must override all else."
He doesn't respond and we keep walking at a pace I find difficult to keep up with even with my superb level of fitness.  I've grown fitter with each passing year, all the damn walking because Cas is too much of an angel snob to find a car.  Though I have to say there are benefits to the walking; we stay more hidden this way.  Not too many cars on the roads these days, they tend to be noticed.
Lucifer clings to him.  Crying.  “Okay, Sam.  Whatever you want.  Please forgive me.”
The only trouble with that is Dean’s size.  His baby is near ten pounds as he approaches his due date.  That’s a lot of baby to fit into a human, he’ll block Cas from view.  Alpha wants it though and Alpha gets what he wants, so Dean stands using one of the chair arms, and one of Cas’s arms to help him stand.
“I wanted to check your progress, how’s Sam?”
Cas sits back, his slit eyes return.  “I wasn’t asking.  You will do it and I’d better not find out you haven’t.”
The kid’s my only ticket out of here.  If Sam weren’t so fucked up, he’d be Sam’s ticket out of here too. The kid tries again, and again, and again with nothing happening.  I let him take a breather when he starts to cry, but I am worried as to when Lucifer might decide to drop by.  This whole thing just sucks.
Dean catches his eyes, and waves, Cas smiles at him, Dean stands off to the side, out of harm’s way so he can watch.  Cas oversees a few of the drills and when they begin a new one, Cas runs over to Dean.  Cas might be a big, tough, alpha Emperor, but sometimes when he looks at Dean, he’s just a goofy schoolboy.
Dreyous smiles.  “This is a mead night.  We’ll learn about the fire God with my best fire mead.”
“Cas won’t punish you for accepting from one of us when you run out from him.”
2. Go here to see the chart of angel factions if you want to:
After a long night of traversing tunnels, I see light.  We're going to make it out of here.  I take a deep breath when we make it out into the early morning air.  It's still dark, the sun likely coming up soon.  A fairy is waiting for us.  He sighs relief.  "Charand," he says.  "It was taking so long, I was worried."
The stone changes when I get who-the-fuck-knows how far down the hallways of the stone maze I’ve unwittingly entered.  It’s now grey-blue, speckled like it’s been dusted with glitter.  Inscribed into all of the walls from this point forward are words written in Enochian.  I get a wave of goose flesh, my hair standing up at the nape.  “This is a spell,” I say aloud.  I don’t know how I know that, but I
Lucifer leaves, and Jack runs to me, unafraid of how terrible I must look, only concerned.  "Sammy!" he says and dives on the bed, into my arms crying.
He slips a finger into my entrance, which is already wet with the fluid my body makes because of our mating.  A mating forever changes a human.  Even if a human is to lose their angel the changes remain.  It's the same for angels  "Hnnnng…" God it feels so good.  I hate how good it feels, but I let myself enjoy nonetheless – there is very little to enjoy these days.  It's not like I can hide it from him anyway.  Passion like this is too difficult to cover, unless there's another, much stronger emotion to feel, and makes sense for the situation.
So, I'm writing a few Little Dean series.  In each, they are meant for fantasy.  This means we're not going to hear a whole lot of talk about "safewords" and Cas getting consent every step of the way.  It's definitely how it is -- Dean has consented, he can exit any anytime -- but I'm not going to
“Wh-What do you want me to say, Master?”
When he wakes, his hands are free, and Cas is wrapped around him, his scruff scratching into Dean’s neck.  Dean inhales Cas’s scent and luxuriates in having his alpha surround him.  Cas is busy, they don’t get a lot of moments like this, there are times when Cas doesn’t come to bed at all.
Daddy hands him a stuffed lion, which he’s not sure about at first, but then he’s so soft and fluffy, Dean finds himself snuggling into the lion’s mane.  He’s got a monocle that’s made from felt material, which makes him look smart.  “What are you going to call him?” Daddy asks adjusting the diaper through his legs, tapping his thigh so he’ll lift up just a bit.  Dean might be new to diapers for himself, but he knows how it works.  He’s been to lots of adult-baby gatherings, and has seen it done with friends often enough.  He’s also watched tons online and read about it in stories.
She smiles.  “My name is Evanora.  I know your proclivity for pet names, Dean, so you may call me Eva.”
But that’s not the point.  Point is, God, is Sammy being a prisoner better or him being the ruler of even the demon kings better?  That’s not a question you ever expect to ask yourself.
For those who've bought into Lucifer, I get it.  Creatures like Lucifer have a way of making people feel good, and special, but there's also the subconscious fear they'll end up like his little pet driving them to please him, making them minions.  It's something Lucifer doesn't have to say, draw attention to, or even explain, but it's felt even if the people don't know what it is they're feeling.  It terrifies them into romancing themselves with the fake part of Lucifer, the part they'd rather believe is real, the charismatic, fun Lucifer he's showing now, even though deep inside they know it's not real.
Cas does see him, right?  Of course, he does.  He waits and he waits and he waits.  He gets angry.  He lifts up before it’s time.  “Get back into position.  Do not speak.”
converse with me human."
Something that’s important to Dean, is being little with others in their community.  That doesn’t mean it’s not hard.  They’ve had a few playdates now, but Dean still gets a bit of that nervous excitement, when Daddy tells them they’ll have visitors.  Other than that, he doesn’t get concerned.  One thing that is a constant Dean’s already come to rely on is that when Daddy says something, it will happen, often whether he likes it or not.  He can fight, or he can accept it.  Accepting it has become much easier.
Dean’s given boots, a white t-shirt and a fucking plaid
Fuck the world.  I’ve got to figure everything out, and I’ve got to do it really fucking quickly, or there won’t be anything left of Sammy.
“—or you’ll beat my ass.  Yeah, I get how it works around here, sir.”
“I give you a point on that yeah, a lot of us do, but the humans overtaking said cultures would also argue they knew better.”
Still, old habits die hard, and he can’t help the bit of blush that runs through him when he realizes he’s mooned one of the gardeners.  He likes to at least try to keep covered.
“From Sam’s directions.  It talked about a pale moon rising.  I think when we’re going the right way, that’s the moon we’ll see.”  Which kinda sucks, because that means a whole day of travel could equal no ground.
Mock Last Chapter: Guys, GUIZZZZ. This chapter is so kinky it could end my career.
Cas’s eyes pop.  “Oh really, pretty omega?”
“What happens to the people inside of the spell?”  What is happening to me?  It’s something I’ve wondered awhile, but I’ve found nothing and have been too scared to pry.  He’s talkative today though.
"Mock, how DARE you!  You have 60 million other works on the go.  We want [INSERT FIC NAME] and we want it now."
“I will, but I want something from you in return.  You willing to give me something for it?”
He makes a sound I take to mean ‘yes’, or at least a we’ll see, but he’s non-responsive to me. I still have more to say though and I’ve got to do my best to speak in Cas, to speak logic, which is all he understands.  “I know what I did was wrong
Cas is too content to retaliate.  He kisses Dean’s crown.
I've got dark circles under my eyes, and the whites are red from not sleeping enough.  I don't look like a guy in my early twenties; I look fifty.
Dean might light this place on fire.  He might light the whole Garrison on fire and … oh shit.  Please don’t be the rampage.
"Amen," I say without prompting, well, unless you count Cas's dagger-like eyes, which on on me.
Cas resumes fucking him.  “Oh, I do, my beloved.  I want to see your face.  You may come after I do.”
Dean stops at the door to the kitchen; he sees Cas is at the table with a mug of tea.  Should he catch his attention?  Or wait to be addressed?  He would have to call Cas ‘Daddy’ if he addresses him, and Dean wants to, but feels shy about it.
He doesn't answer, and moves to bite my inner thigh.  I have to bite my bottom lip to keep from crying out.  I'm not entirely successful, but it is muffled.  I can feel blood trailing down my thigh.
“No, but I respect him.  You’re his.”
Dean was good about it.  Yes, there were a few times when he was a teenager that he tried to pull one over on his alpha father, so he could masturbate because he felt like it, but aside from being punished, living with Father’s utter disappointment was too much for Dean to bear.  He grew up and learned to control his omega urges, only going to Father when he knew he needed to.
“I am a medical medium, like I said, but that’s only one of the names for someone like me.  I prefer the term, Seer.  That means I’m a creature, Dean.”
But it's got lovely art created by the even lovelier
I race there and arrive out of breath, scaring Michael half to death.  “Samuel?”
"Dear Father, we thank you for your grace this day, allowing us to get to safety, and for this room, which my mate can use to get the rest he needs, if he ever obeys me and goes to sleep.  Amen."
"There must be a way.  We shall simply find the way, and undo the bond.  Dean will make the perfect husband for my son."
.”  His voice is like the silk on his bed, except laced with arsenic.
“Master.  Master, please.
I persist though.  He wanted me to learn things, I’ve learned.  “Architect magic doesn’t work well without a bond.  It was
“I don’t need a babysitter,” Dean complains, but shuts up quickly when Cas turns his feral countenance on him.  What Cas says on the field goes.  In truth, what “Cas says goes” is an always for Dean no matter where they are but there’s something extra to it when they’re in this environment.  It’s amazing and terrifying at the same time.
“On the night before the trial, the brothers set their plan in action.  First, Xathanael, Roark’s mate, had to die, which broke Roark, but they needed to trade the soul of an angel to make what they needed and it couldn’t be Michael, he was the strongest and best chance against Lucifer now.  Xathanael would be the only one who didn’t make it through to this point in time.  He’s gone forever – at least according to what I’ve read.”
“Shhhh, relax,” Cas says, moving Dean’s dressing-cloak aside to display his cock for the room.
I look over at Sammy, who was a second ago a jubilant boy, but now's a pale white never having seen the likes of what's before us.  Because it's not just an angel with his battered human, it's what pure evil looks like.  "D-Dean, I think we should go," he says without looking away.
Dean’s mask is still off.  “No.  Please.  I can’t take another week of that stuff.  I just … I can’t, sir.”
Sam knows too.  I look to him.
What the hell does that even mean?  I don't ask him that, because he's terrifying, and I can tell he's not in the best of moods even if the violence, and the sex has released him some.  To my surprise he continues some.  "The marks will do for now.  You've proven your loyalty to me."
“You know I will by now.”
“Hullo, Highness,” he says.
“I don’t live here.  I’m—”
“It’s better than bein’ stuck here,” Dean says resting his head in his hand.
“How would that even work?”
We walk on and it's not fun.  My right leg hurts, I'm limping some, but not enough it prohibits me walking.  I can keep going, and I do.  I don't complain, but I fucking check on that amulet, boy do I fucking check on the amulet.
"You'd better not Sam, or this round of discipline will feel like a holiday."
“You don’t boss me around, I boss you around.  This Dean guy is going to get a different kind of show if you keep going on like that.”
and we should get while the getting's good, but I'm barely hearing him.  Castiel's about to set off again,
Now that I have gotten enough of this out, I will move to working on WW and CoH.
"Do you have any bright ideas?"
Dean’s ears perk up.
Roark and Jonathan set this in motion, Sam and I have to finish it.  We’re the only ones who can.
“That shouldn’t be your concern.  What if I just want to play with your cock?”  He lifts his brow.
Cas releases Dean’s cock.  Dean catches his breath.  Fucking jealous asshole.  “Yeah.  Okay, got it.  I report to Gabriel when you’re not here.  Anything else?”
"What, so like I’m in the family tree now?"
“You knew that might happen?”
"Holy shit, Winchester.  I thought you were going to lose your fucking head.  How you're still standing here, I don't know."
Jack nods.
“You may rise, Winchester.”
Dean wishes he could get pregnant at any time, like a beta woman, but he can’t, only with his moon cycle.  This would have been an amazing moment to make their first child, looking into Cas’s soul like this, feeling cared for even if it’s not love.
When Dean has their youngling, Cas has decreed they will have a nanny to tag along after them, so Dean can complete the tasks expected from the Emperor’s consort, but that’s no use to him now.  There will also be someone to fill in for him while he takes his month-long leave of absence to recover from the pregnancy.
Cas strides out of the dungeons with Dean in his arms, looking like a dark menace.  Dean grips his neck, folding into the storm.
Tender moments with Dad were few, but they do exist.  I was six and Dean was ten.  Dad was tired reading over his journal in a chair out in Uncle Bobby’s front yard, I was at his feet sifting through the grass.  Dean had just told me lucky people found four-leaf-clovers in the grass and I wanted to be a lucky person.
Later, I'm getting hungry, which must mean the dragon is starving, so I'm just thinking about what I'll do about that, when I see Cas trying to sit up.  "Cas!"  I run over and help him up.  "Oh Fuck, Cas.  You're alive."
He pouts.  “Just until I find a home for him?”
Teleapài rolls her eyes, making a fed-up sort of noise.  “I birthed your father too, he also came out squalling.”
“If not, they could walk right out of here and it would take them back to the plane we come from.  Technically, the palace is there too, you just can’t see it.”
It’s not that I don’t think of him, as dearly as I love him, I try not to focus my thoughts on him too much, because it breaks my heart.  That kid has to live through horrors he never should have to.
angel blade, the one I finally stopped begging him for.  “It is time for you to kill me.”
brother—alone with Cas.  Cas said he wouldn’t kill him unless absolutely necessary which it the best promise he could get from anyone—most just want Sam dead.  Because sucking their blood?  Fraternizing with demons?  That’s angel treason.  Sam was suspected of the latter which is bad enough but no angel jury in the world is going to let Sam off on the demon blood sucking thing.
“Because he’s not going to take you sexually against your will.  Doesn’t matter though.  You’ll learn it’s his through the training.  He’s … disabled your ability to get erections for a time to help you.  It’s a kindness.  So, you can learn.”
“But maybe I can get in?” I say.
Sam laughs.  He actually laughs.  So worth getting scolded by Cas.  Cas leads the troops.  We follow as an unlikely gang behind him.  He’s going slow though, real fucking slow, recognizing Sam doesn’t have the strength for such a journey at his pace.
“I know Dad.  I’m sorry.”  My heart’s racing.  I know this is goodbye.  Sammy comes over to tower above us, as I remain seated beside him.
“Does this mean you’re not going to kill me?”
came faster.  I can’t keep quiet anymore, fuck it.  I cry out with each time, but I don’t beg for him to stop.  I knew what I was doing when I did it.  I earned that punishment in the sense of Cas’s rules and I disobeyed them.  I don’t regret it,
Oh c'mon.  We all know I'm nice to look at.  I roll my eyes.
It feels like I should remember something, but I can’t.  A memory is there, fighting to get to the surface, but like when I am drowning forever in the sea, it too is stuck, unable to breathe and cannot be brought to life.
beg him not to.  It leaves long, nasty, gashes, that heal like shit. "Maybe one hundred of these will put you in a more obedient mood."
Odd.  He doesn't sound mad.  Shouldn't he be mad?  I can't worry about it for the moment as I lose my battle to stay conscious, and fall asleep in his arms.
“Back when we got this?  Okay, yeah maybe but not until you enjoyed the markings for at least a day or two.”
is ‘rich’.  Some of have more than others, and it could be argued that those people are ‘rich’ by comparison to others who live here, but it’s not really much.  I don't get why families can't have their treasures.  The people going hungry in this community are the ones who aren't willing to work for it.  Those who can't work are taken care of.   Regardless, Erik’s family is doing the thing they claim is wrong, if on a smaller scale and are acting as though that is acceptable, while the rest are heathens.
It probably would be epic.  The wrongness of it that much more arousing for Sam.  “No.  I’m not fucking someone who wants to end all of humanity.”
And Dean knew it was unconventional, but there was no law against it.  Father always felt him capable, so he allowed Dean to serve.  Even when his goofball, alpha brother worried—because it’s an alpha’s nature to worry about omega kin—Father’s confidence in Dean never faltered.
It doesn’t faze the man. He gives a smile you never want to get; a patronizing one.  It says he’s impervious to whatever we have to offer, unless it’s the thing he’s looking for and fuck you and whatever problem you’re having if you don’t.  “I’m sorry, gentlemen.  We don’t accept money here.  We are rolling in the new system, it’s totally moneyless.”
“Good.  The worst is not over though.  We’ll have to do that at least two more times if we want to prevent you coming all over the place.”
But even if I didn't want to, I'm overpowered by whatever's coursing through me, so that I couldn't tell anyone if I didn't want this, just that I do.  Fuck though, it feels so damn good, I don't care one way or the other.
I suppose the brothers thing makes sense, but I had hoped Dean wasn’t involved in whatever crap my past-self got into.
Lucifer catches on within seconds that I'm simply going to ignore him.  "Change of plans, instead we're going to commence with your first lesson.  Sam?  When I tell you what we're going to do, we're going to do it.  I am fine with forcing you.  Hopefully you'll come to learn it's much better just to obey me."  With his powers, he lifts me up, and slams me into the chair where he's got tea set out.  "Now then, I've got choices for you.  I can restrain you, I have many ways to do that, but I would prefer a more civilized tea.  I'd like you to eat, and drink something.  Will you behave, or do I need the restraints?"
It works.  Sam’s there.  Not just the shell of Sam, the one Lucifer melted down and simmered until most of him boiled away.  Sammy.
"Goodbye, Cas," I say with quiet tears streaming down my face.
Dean officially wants to murder Cas.  Again.  He’s sees red and that’s not good.  He’s never been able to control his temper when he reaches meltdown.  “Yeah, well you’re a fucking dick, Master.”
“Mmmmhmmmm,” Dean moans and it dawns on him as to why Cas insisted he be the one—Michael might be the one drawing the symbols but this is an extension of the orgasm from between him and Cas.  His heart’s still beating with Cas.  Cas revibrates through him.  Would it have been the same with Michael?  No.  It wouldn’t have been bad, but it wouldn’t have been this good.  Dean spies Cas’s smug face above him.  Bastard.
Dean dazzles at the endearment.  “Never better, Alpha.”
“That’s simple. If you touch it, if you’ve used it to get off in any way, you will suffer unimaginable torture at my hand.  I like your blood Dean.”  As if he needs to make that even clearer, Cas licks more of Dean’s blood from the back of his hand.
Inevitably though, Dean feels that familiar sensation in his bladder and the countdown clock to him having to use his potty has begun.  Maybe he can make it to the end of the playdate?
If they had, though, Dean would be dead.  Disintegrated.  Michael could have used him for years, but his body would have worn out.  His modifications protect against his early death by disintegration.  It’s still disorienting as fuck and just plain creepy.  Imagine what it would feel like to stuff a hive of honeybees under your skin.  Then once they’re inside, they turn into sloshy oil and when your body moves it’s heavy like you’re in a terrarium of sand.  All the while it’s dark.
Gadreel straps him down on a bench that reminds of those massage chairs in the mall only on less of an angle; it’s flatter and higher.  His arms and legs each get strapped to their own pad and there’s a cushy spot for his head.  The portion of bench under his torso ends at the top of his hip bones.  His dick hangs like a wooden pole far enough away from the end of the bench it’s not touching.  His torso is strapped to the bench tightly enough he won’t be able to press his dick anywhere near it.  His nuts are heavy from all the denial for the past five hours.

When Cas is naked, he climbs in behind Dean—Cas is always the big spoon—his large, hard dick poking into the back of Dean’s thigh, his leg hair tangling with Dean’s as he wraps his leg around Dean’s thigh.  He nuzzles the nape of Dean’s neck and presses a kiss to the dip.  “I should have been there,” he says.
He takes Dean’s hand and places it to the side of his belly.  Nothing happens for a moment and then there’s movement under his hand, Dean’s heart flutters, he has trouble swallowing.  What he wouldn’t give to have his own youngling inside of him, pressing his skin out like this for others to feel.  “He’ll be strong.  Maybe an alpha.”
Dean loves hearing that but at the same time it’s like chocolate cake frozen in ice.  To get to the sweet, awesome middle, you’ll either be chipping your fucking teeth or waiting for it to thaw.
“Sammy,” I say.
Cas takes Dean eight more times before dawn comes.  Dean’s never been so grateful for speedier healing.  Dean watches with careful eyes as Cas dresses to leave with a sinking pit in his gut.  It hurts.  Dean’s still naked amidst the black silk.  Only his collar and cuffs and his ring to decorate his body.  A desperate searching for the words he can say to make Cas take him with squirms in his belly, but there are none so he pouts instead.
We enter the bar.  It hasn’t been remodeled yet, there are no patreons, or people running the joint.  Just a bunch of bottles in the well sitting there from
He needs Gadreel’s assistance to get back to his cell and to put his pants on.
I read on hoping the book gets to the part that tells me exactly how I get my brother here and how I protect my mind from whatever’s going to happen to it, but apparently that’s for me to figure out.
Being the Emperor’s consort means he can’t simply go somewhere, he must bring a few members of the guard, but because it is on his task list, he doesn’t have to run the whole ordeal past Cas, so he seizes the opportunity.
“He petitioned to have you moved downstairs to the Garrison, you know.”
leave.  Understood?"
I do.  When the food arrives, I try to eat what I can.  The girl who brings it to me studies me with an odd look on her face.  “You look like you could be cleaned up.  Would you like a bath?  I could get you into the private baths, if your mate will allow it.”  She eyes the collar around my neck.
, no specific divination available; God who has yet to show his stupid face.
He calls for me to come to the great hall.  A place he sits like a king while the people of this palace come to him for this, or that and both angels and demons give him reports.  When he sees me enter, he waves me forward while still listening to the man before him, asking for something.
was the deaf one.
Halfway through the meal, Cas asked the question they all had been avoiding. "I am not sure if this is the right time to be asking this, but...Now that Chuck isn't God anymore and the threat has been removed, what do we do now?
A demented smile formed on Meg’s face. “
The Empty narrowed its eyes and said, “Hard to forget.”
Dean woke up in a cold sweat with a scream on the tip of his tongue that he just barely stopped from coming out. Once again, he’d dreamt about Cas being taken from him. The words Cas said ran through his head on an endless loop, tormenting him. Dean hated himself for how he’d frozen in the moment, for letting Cas die without ever telling him the truth. He wiped away the tears that were gathering in his eyes and looked at the clock on his nightstand table. It was nearly two in the afternoon and he had no interest in getting out of bed, even though he knew it would worry Sam.
“I’m so sorry about your grace, Cas. I wish I could have gotten you out another way, but I couldn’t leave you there. Not like that.” He reached down and laced their fingers together. “You’re just going to have to get used to being a weak little human like us.”
"What?" Dean asked, confused. "No. Nothing like that. He just... told me he loved me. How—how did you know?"
There was nothing for Dean to do but wait. He didn't have the knowledge or the skills that Rowena and Sam had. The most he could do was occasionally go on supply runs. He spent his time trying to get things ready for Cas's return. He went through Cas's bedroom and cleaned it up, holding back his tears as he came across things that reminded him of Cas. He saw the mixtape in a small tape player on Cas's nightstand table and the tears threatened to spill out of his eyes before he took a few deep breaths and pushed them back down.
“I’ll try,” Rowena promised in a more sympathetic tone. “If there is magic that can fix this, we’ll find it.”
,” Dean said firmly.
"Maybe not, but I know you, Dean. You're hiding something," Sam stated.
Dean cringed, worried he’d gone about this whole conversation the wrong way. Being open and honest about his desires was not exactly his strong suit, especially when it came to men, and
He was woken up a few hours later by Sam bursting into his room and saying, “We have a lead.”
“You can enter, but the Empty is huge. Finding Castiel might be a challenge,” Sam said.
to fix it, Rowena.
Two days after they’d made a plan to summon Rowena, Dean was in the dungeon drawing a sigil on the ground and lighting candles. Sam placed a bowl in the middle of the sigil and began placing the ingredients in the bowl in a particular order and then lit them all on fire. Sam began reading out an incantation and then blue sparks began to shoot out of the bowl.
with you. I’m sorry it took me this long.”
Dean choked out a laugh, somewhat amazed at how freeing it felt to not have to lie about his attraction to Cas. “Babe, do you think I have a problem with seeing you without clothes on? ‘Cause I wasn’t staring because I was
“Not sure if Jimmy’s like of burgers will pass over to you, but I bought these while thinking of you,” Dean said with a small shrug. “I wore them a lot when we had our… uh, disagreement earlier this year. I
“I’ll take a look, but I can’t promise anything,” Rowena said. “Something like this — it’s cosmic. There may not be a spell or magic that can pack that kind of punch.”
The next morning, Cas was reminded of how hard it could be for humans to pull themselves out of slumber, and he really began to understand Dean’s angry bearlike traits when he was woken up too early. Cas grumbled to himself and buried his face in the pillow he had been using, but began to wake up further when he felt Dean rubbing his back. Castiel looked to the left, and that's when he saw Dean sitting next to him, sipping his cup of coffee.
to be, because they only felt complete when they were together. Dean would always have nightmares, but waking up with Cas spooned up against him was all he needed to get past them and move on with his life. The moments he lived for were the moments where Cas would grumpily snuggle up to him and refuse to let him leave the bed in the morning, or the afternoons where he could watch the sunshine shine down on Cas while he worked in the garden, or the nights where their bodies joined together to give him the greatest pleasure he’d ever known.  With every new moment with Cas, the bad parts of his past and even his present seemed to fade. Their lives would never be perfect, but they were finally free to be able to live the way they wanted. It turned out that what Dean had always wanted most was a peaceful life with Cas and Sam by his side, even if he’d never before allowed himself to hope for it.
"I always have been yours. We've just been too busy being idiots." Cas mused as he allowed himself to pull Dean’s shirt off and move his hands over Dean’s skin, admiring his body in a way he’d never been able to before. They spent hours exploring each other’s bodies, and Dean could only hope that their room was sufficiently soundproofed to avoid Sam overhearing anything he shouldn’t. Sam might begin wishing
Castiel’s words rang through his head again.
“Morning, Sunshine,” Dean said as he leaned down to peck a kiss on Cas’s lips. He picked up a second cup of coffee from the nightstand and handed it over to Cas, who sniffed at it a couple times before taking a sip and scrunching his face in distaste. Dean laughed as Cas shook his head and handed the cup back.
Based on the way Sam’s face lit up, Dean following basic rules of hygiene was like Christmas morning for him. “Good. You stink.”
Dean assisted Cas to his feet, holding an arm around him to keep him upright as he went around to greet everyone. Dean guided him over to Rowena, and he stuck out his hand for her, but she decided to go for a light hug instead. Dean watched in amusement as Cas awkwardly pat her back. His hug with Eileen was similarly awkward, but he allowed Sam to give him a big lingering hug that would have bothered Dean if it was anyone other than his brother. He knew Sam was just grateful to have his brother back.
“We have a way to get into the Empty, we think,” Sam said. “But we need something to get the Empty to agree to give him back.”
Sam sighed and rubbed his hand over his eyes. “I don’t even know what I’m looking for in this spell. I think we need someone who understands magic better than we do.”
"Good morning, Dean," Castiel said in a groggy and gravelly morning voice.
Rage and guilt consumed him, and he punched the wall in frustration, piercing a hole in the only bedroom he’d ever known. He stared down at his bruised hand; the pain was almost comforting in the way that it momentarily distracted him from the pain he felt from losing the one person who could tear down his walls and make him feel something,
“You can have as many peanut butter and jelly sandwiches as you want, buddy—uh, baby,” Dean said, stumbling on the pet name.
“But there are some benefits, right? You can eat peanut butter and jelly again. No more tasting molecules. And maybe—maybe this will feel better as a human too,” Dean said before finally bringing their lips together. The feeling of Cas’s lips on his felt
Not wanting to risk the Empty doing anything to betray them now that it had gotten what it wanted, Dean rushed through the portal with Cas in his arms. He stumbled out into the bunker’s library and cradled Cas’s body in his arms. Cas seemed a little shaky at first, and Dean simply held him as he helped him sit up and then wrapped his arms around him tightly. He felt the tears start to gather in his eyes again, and then he felt Cas try to comfort him by patting him on the back.
“You’re the Empty,” Dean realized.
“We missed you so much,” Eileen said. “Dean especially, but we all felt incomplete without you around.”
Dean glared at the Empty and gruffly said, “One moment.”
“It’s Cas,” Sam said simply with a half smile.
you.”
beyond anger and guilt.
"I... didn't tell you everything about how Cas summoned the Empty," Dean said.
“Yeah, he’s gone. Alive, but powerless. Jack’s got his powers now,” Dean said. “You were right. The whole time, you knew that Jack would save us. And you were right.”
Dean asked skeptically.
to sleep. I don’t even know how you intend to get him out of the Empty, since I don’t think your little angel can make it out through that rift alive. But that’s not my problem. I brought you Castiel, now it’s
“Yeah, I dunno. Something about going out guns blazing doesn’t really appeal to me anymore,” Dean said with a shrug. “I don’t want to just die at the hands of the next random vampire right when we’ve finally found some peace.”
He could have stayed in that moment forever, but they eventually pulled apart once Rowena said, “As much as I’d love to keep watching until you boys start tearing your clothes off, I guess my work here is done.”
Dean sat down on the ground, letting his head rest against the wall of the laundry room floor as Sam sat down across from him, waiting.
Jo’s wife is pregnant.  In the case of two betas, they require an alpha donor, which is not a problem, there’s a program in place.  “She’s due any day.  I’m sure we’ll see a time when our little ones are playing together.”
across the face for that.  "If I'm even going to consider this, you will speak respectfully to me."
"Shhh, don't talk like that here.  Anyone could hear you."
Dean glares.  Sure.  Keep talking about him like he’s not in the room.  Dean might have a temper but right now’s not it.  Gabriel’s being a dick.  Does he really expect Dean to play good little submissive for him?
"They can?"
That’s another thing to digest.  He’d been too preoccupied to think about it much.  It’s also tomorrow’s problem.  “If I’m your mate, why do I obey you?  Why aren’t we equals?”
I must look as terrified as I feel.  But maybe there's some way out.  Maybe I can escape whatever will pull me under – I assume there's got to be a something – and I can leave this place.  "I would rather drown forever than spend another minute here with you."
"Place your hands back on your heels, and arch your torso forward."
Dean knows Daddy will have his eyes on them both, so he’s got to make his way over to the latch slowly.  Dean saunters, like he’s not doing anything important, while Sammy gets back down on his hands and knees, following him around to the latch.  Dean doesn’t have mitts on, so it’s easy for him to lift the latch and aha! Sammy is free.  He pulls the door open while Daddy isn’t looking and Sammy escapes.
"Thank you, Luci."  I'm not keen on Jack seeing me like this, but my need to make sure he's okay overrides that.  "May I have my robes?"
Gabriel hadn’t known he was coming.  “No.”
but thinking about them, wanting to see Dean’s face as he sews them on for me, just one more time feels unbearable, because I know it’s something I’ll never see again.  Dean has always known the heart of the world.  He’s always known what it would take to connect to it again.  He can’t save us all, but he can teach us how to save ourselves.
Dean’s glad Gabriel didn’t tell him the number.  Five.  Five hundred lashes.  Humans have died from less than two hundred.  But Dean’s no longer human and he can be healed every fifty.  Dayamos decides he’ll keep one hundred.  Dean shakes which really fucking chafes him—more than his collar—because he doesn’t want to show fear.  But there is fear.  He’s scared.  Gabriel’s here along with half the Garrison.  Not Michael.  Not Paris.  He’s fucking glad for that but Gabriel probably has to be here.  Gabriel’s also “that” guy, the responsible one; the guy who ends up cleaning the house after a rager.  The brother who makes sure everyone gets to school on time.  Dean doubts he wants to watch this, but he’ll stay to pick up whatever’s left of Dean.  Make sure there are pieces left to pick up.
“Hello, Rowena,” Sam said with a clear sense of relief. “It’s good to see you.”
“Are you serious?” Dean asked. “What’s the catch?”
“Fair point,” Dean responded, though he still felt guilty knowing that Cas’s sacrifice would still have to cost him part of who he is. “What about the Empty itself? It’s not going to be happy with me traipsing in there. It will probably just kill me on the spot.”
now.”
Dean leaned his head back against the headboard and sighed. Of course, it was too good to be true. “Then what’s the fucking point?”
and I’ll find him again,” Dean said confidently. If he could get to the Empty, he
me. You didn’t even give me a chance to—”
“Please, Rowena,” Dean said. “You remember what you told me, back when we were in Hell? You told me to fix it. To not let one of us die while we still had regrets—I, I didn’t listen to you. I
“Last I heard, your angel got taken away to the Empty. Even I can’t get him out of there,” Rowena said.
Cas’s eyes crinkled as he responded, “Yes. I've become quite attached to it over the years."
“Not interested,” Dean replied. It didn’t matter anymore. Even with Chuck gone, the monsters would always keep coming.
“You’re not even close to fine, Dean,” Sam said with a frustrated sigh. “Last time Cas died, you nearly killed yourself. Maybe we just need to take a break. Find an easy case and get back to this once we find a lead.”
Seeming to realize that Dean and Cas needed some time alone, Sam and Eileen stayed in the library while Dean walked with Cas to the kitchen, never once letting go of his hand. Cas sat down in one of the chairs by the table and Dean pressed a kiss to the top of his head before finally letting go of Cas’s hand and moving to the cupboards to get out the sandwich ingredients.
it when Kelly was pregnant. Wait, what about Amara? Is she inside of Jack now too?"
“And how the Hell can we help with that?” Dean said.
Dean squinted. “You mean we could remove his grace. I don’t know if he’d want that. He felt...lost as a human.”
Even in their afterglow, Dean couldn’t take his hands or his eyes off Cas, and they stayed up for another couple of hours while Dean filled Cas in on how they’d managed to take down Chuck and how they’d managed to free him from the Empty. By the time they were done talking, Cas’s eyes were starting to droop in a way that reminded Dean just how
turn to live up to your side of the bargain.”
opened his eyes.
"I don't know what you want me to say," Dean said.
“It’s so good to have you back, man,” Sam said as he clutched Cas close to him. “Our family isn’t complete without you.”
Dean ran forward to hold onto Cas, cupping his face in his palm. Cas was here; he was
Dean would never admit it, but watching Sam with Eileen made the feelings of loss much more painful. They were clearly trying to hide what was going on between them, but he saw the tension between them. He saw the way that they gently touched each other when they thought Dean wasn’t looking and the way that their eyes lingered on each other with a promise of more. He knew that Eileen was staying in Sam’s room. He was happy for them; he really was. Sam deserved to find happiness and love, and Eileen was the perfect person for him to settle down with. That didn’t stop it from feeling like a stab in the heart.
“Of fucking course there are,” Dean groaned.
Eileen looked confused as she asked, “Isn’t she the Queen of Hell now? Are you planning to break into Hell too?”
“Gripping you tight and raising you from perdition?” Dean asked with a small smirk, before pulling Cas close and touching their foreheads together.
” the Empty repeated with obvious anger.
Dean walked over to his wardrobe and pulled open the drawer with his sleep clothes. With a small smile, he picked a pair of pajama pants with burgers and hot dogs on them and a loose t-shirt. He handed them over to Cas with a smile.
“You can summon the Queen of Hell?” Eileen asked.
Cas spent his life finding new joys in human experiences. He was always a wealth of knowledge and was particularly good at research for cases, but he also began to find his own interests. He built his own garden outside the bunker and Dean helped build him some beehives so he could gather honey. He began to learn to cook, too. At first, his experiments were disastrous, and even Dean couldn’t pretend he liked them. Over time, he began to improve, until finally one day he was able to serve Dean a pie that actually made his entire face light up with a smile after a single bite.
from Cas’s perspective or how far he’d want to go with their relationship.
Dean shrugged and left the room, feeling the weight of Sam’s stare on his back. He walked back to his room and got into his bed. The empty space next to him felt stifling, even though Cas had never slept there. The lost potential of what they could have had stung, especially since he now knew he could have had it all along. He’d always thought there was no way Cas could feel the same way. He wasn’t even sure if angels were capable of feeling love that way. But he’d seen it in Cas’s eyes when he’d summoned the Empty. He
“Your boytoy joined us after the bomb, so he’s still asleep, living through his regrets,” the Empty said. It reached down and touched Cas’s forehead and then a malicious grin grew on its face. “He’s dreaming about killing you. Hundreds of fake yous. And beating up the
moment, but
"That the Empty would take him instead, but only after he had a moment of true happiness," Dean answered.
Cas didn't want to admit it out loud at the breakfast table, but being human again made him feel vulnerable. As an angel, he always felt strong and capable, ready to defend the bunker and the Winchesters. He wouldn't say he felt utterly useless because he still was a warrior, but it was on a different scale now as a human being: no wings, no grace, no celestial energy.
Dean blushed as he quickly said the last part, somehow nervous despite the fact Cas had been willing to spend eternity living out his regrets just to save him. It was all still so new, so fresh, and he still didn’t completely know how Cas felt. He knew Cas loved him, but he had no idea what that
“We could summon Crowley. I don’t see why Rowena should be any different,” Sam said.
Dean pulled away from the hug and wiped the snot and tears off his face. He nodded, not wanting to tell Sam how much he doubted their ability to pull this off.
“Guess you’re not a big fan, huh,” Dean said with a grin. “Maybe we can try tea later.”
Dean frowned, confused about what Sam meant. "I haven't lied to you."
He was too far gone that he didn't even notice Sam had entered the room until he felt a hand on his shoulder, the same shoulder Cas had branded when they first met, the same shoulder he'd touched before he died. He started shaking with tears even as he felt his brother pull him into his arms. He would normally push Sam away and tell him he was fine, but this time, he clung to him and let his brother rub his back.
Sam's face turned softer and he placed a comforting hand on Dean's arm. "Oh, Dean. I'm so—"
“To be honest...getting out of the line of fire sounds kind of nice for a change,” Sam said. “I just never thought I’d hear you say it.”
“The other problem is that only humans can travel through the portal,” Sam stated.
Dean’s eyes crinkled as he watched Cas eat, especially when he put together a sandwich with the eggs and bacon inside the toast and his eyes lit up in surprise at all the flavors melding together. He hadn’t realized how long he’d been staring until Cas called him out, and then he focused on his own plate of food, sticking a whole piece of bacon in his mouth in one bite.
His breath hitched when he saw the green jacket with the bloody handprint on the left shoulder. Suddenly, the tears he had been holding back for days came pouring out. He clutched the jacket close to his chest as his teeth began to chatter and the tears kept streaming down his face. He gasped for air, and then he could no longer keep the crying silent. He wiped away the snot and the tears that were covering his face, but he couldn't stop himself from breaking down and sobbing uncontrollably.
did it. Jack did it. I knew you would. If anyone could change the entire balance of the world, it would be you."
The Empty gave a half-hearted shrug. “
Cas squinted his eyes and looked like he was about to say something else, when the Empty  said, “Not to break up this
Dean ruffled Cas’s hair and said, “I ain’t apologizing for that, and neither should you.”
Even though Sam, Eileen, and Rowena were in the room with them, it felt like they were in their own little world. All of his senses were filled up with
"I'm pretty sure Jimmy's love of burgers will be passed over to me. I won't be able to eat in the low hundreds anymore without sustaining fatal health problems, but one burger is enough for me." Castiel smiled and took off his coat but folded it neatly and set it on the nearby chair.
Rowena turned to Dean and said, “It’s up to you now, Dean. You’ve only got one shot at this, so don’t mess it up.”
“And it’s not like we’re leaving the life, not really,” Dean said. “We’ll always be there to help other hunters, maybe make things a little safer and more coordinated for everyone like you did when we had the apocalypse refugees here. We’ll always be a source for hunters who need help with research or supplies or training, and we can answer the phones when they need a cover.”
Dean flipped Sam off while continuing to focus on cooking, but the small smile on his face remained. He hadn’t really been able to truly celebrate beating Chuck and getting everyone back, because everything had still seemed so hollow without Cas by his side. Finally, it truly felt like they were
Dean and Cas remained in the bunker, running their hunting operation at all hours of the day. Sam and Eileen still came by to help, but Dean really took on the reins of being the leader of their group of hunters. Sometimes this meant that he’d find out about the deaths of people they’d sent on hunts, and this would lead him into depressive fits that brought out his old self-destructive grieving tendencies. More often, though, they’d hear stories about the people they saved. Dean took a special liking to mentoring the younger hunters, showing them the ropes and giving them the tools they needed to stay safe in the field.
That's when he looked up at Dean, who had been staring at him. "Um...I apologize. I should have gone into the bathroom to change. I didn't even think about it." He ran a hand through his hair. "Maybe I need to have a review of societal norms."
you to stay. When you left this time, you didn’t give me the chance to—Cas, please, you
wake up,” Dean said as he buried his head in Cas’s shoulder.
Dean blushed and ignored Cas’s praise as he placed the sandwich in front of him, and Castiel did not hesitate to grab it and begin chowing down. He hummed happily. "I missed you, PB&J.”
Sam sighed as his eyes glanced over the two empty bottles of bourbon. “This needs to stop, Dean. I know you want to find a way to get Cas, but you’re not going to be able to help him if you don’t take care of yourself.”
Dean was trying to be
Dean watched with rapt amazement as Cas devoured the sandwich, finding it extremely endearing the way that Cas seemed to find joy in something as simple as a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The tension between them was building, though it was more exciting than it was uncomfortable.
Dean immediately sat up straight in his bed, all traces of sleepiness erased at those simple words. His heart pounded as he dared to ask, “What is it?”
Sam continued researching and increasing his skills with magic, while also continuing his relationship with Eileen. At first, Sam and Eileen would still occasionally go out on hunts together, but that stopped the day they found out that Eileen was pregnant. Nine months later, Mary was born. Not wanting their baby to grow up in an underground bunker, they found a house less than a mile away to raise their family. Mary, and later her brother Bobby, would grow up knowing about the Supernatural without ever being asked to get involved. They were encouraged to grow up as normal as a Winchester ever could.
Suddenly, someone appeared behind him.
His voice was uncharacteristically shaky and cracked on the last word. He looked down at the floor to avoid the gazes of everyone else in the room as he felt his face redden, but he could feel the weight of their pitying stares on him as they watched him fall apart.
Before Dean had a chance to continue asking, Cas pulled the angel blade from Dean’s pocket and cut himself, allowing the blue wisps of his grace to be pulled out. It seemed to be drawn immediately to the crystal in Dean’s hands, which caused the Empty to raise its eyebrows with interest. Cas collapsed in Dean’s arms as the last bit of his grace fell out of him, and Dean placed his hand over the small wound Cas had created, trying to stop the bleeding.
“No,” Dean said as a small smile appeared on his face. “But we can summon her.”
The good thing about the summoning spell was that they had almost all the ingredients they needed in the bunker, and it only took a couple days to get the last few items. They needed various dried herbs, nuts, and preserved fruits, along with a few more rare items, but they were all things that were easily accessible if you knew where to look.
, Dean. Now.”
He didn’t remember falling asleep, but Sam found him slumped over his laptop the next day, and shook him awake.
It took Dean over a month to track down all the ingredients. At the same time, they desperately looked for some kind of leverage they could use on the Empty. It was beginning to feel hopeless again, but Dean was staying up for hours every night looking for something,
“So, we need to go shopping for some supplies for you today. You know, toothbrush, clothes, razor, human stuff...But first, Sam and Eileen were pretty adamant when I talked to them this morning about wanting to spend some time with you. I kinda stole you last night a bit, and they didn’t really get a chance to welcome you back,” Dean said.
It hurt how wrong Cas was, how Cas had seen the best in him only because he was blinded by his love and couldn’t see the anger and the hate that coursed through every atom of his being. If Dean was really driven by love, why did he let the only person that he’d ever truly loved in a non-familial way die thinking that he didn’t love him back?
quite.”
Not thinking about if it might have been inappropriate, Castiel began to strip down to his boxers and dress in the pajamas that Dean had given him. He slipped on the pants and loose shirt, already feeling more comfortable. Cas moved his arms and legs around, feeling less stuffy than he had with his angelic outfit.
he could manage to find a way to get to Cas.
Sam's eyes lit up, and it looked like things were beginning to fall into place in his head. He always recognized the expression Sam had when he was beginning to put the puzzle pieces together. "So... he summoned it by... what, kissing you?"
“The crystal, Dean,” the Empty said impatiently. “Tell me how it works.”
The ex-angel gave an amused but lazy smile as he was still waking up. "Yes, you did steal me from them, but my stomach was the real culprit in interrupting our reunion."
to know you changed me too. I—I love you too.
friend’s face.
“The crystal, Dean,
“Cas...When we were in Purgatory, I told you that I should have stopped you. All this time, I—every time you left, every time I lost you, I didn’t know how to tell you that I wanted you to stay, that I
Dean turned and looked at Cas. He could
Dean slowly dragged himself out of bed and kneeled down on the floor. As he’d done for every day since they’d defeated Chuck, he tried in vain to pray that Jack would bring Cas back. He opened his eyes, hopeful that Jack would suddenly appear, but he knew he wasn’t coming. Jack had said he wasn’t going to meddle in the world anymore, and he wasn’t going to change his mind just because it was Dean asking. And why should he? Dean had said Jack wasn’t even family. This was his fault.
“Shut up,” Dean said, but he still scrambled out of bed like he’d been given a shot of adrenaline and headed towards the bathroom to begin to process what he was feeling. As the water rained down on him, his mind swirled with a constant stream of
“I’m not an angel anymore,” Castiel said as he leaned forward to press their lips together. Dean melted into the kiss and opened his mouth to allow Cas’s tongue to sweep into his mouth. The kiss seemed exploratory as Cas kept trying different things to see how they’d feel. It might have felt disjointed with any other person, but Dean would have been content to stay in that moment forever. When they finally had to pull back to catch their breath, Cas looked back at him with swollen lips and the largest smile he’d ever seen on his friend’s—
As he was making Cas’s sandwich, he started rambling. “You know, there’s a lot of food that’s better than PB&J. I’ll cook for you, whatever you want. I don’t know what you tried last time you were human, but I
needed to use the bathroom. He’d never managed to get used to urination the last time he was human, and he doubted he’d ever get used to it again. Walking briskly to the restroom, he quickly relieved himself, washed his hands, splashed water on his face, and then joined the rest of his family in the bunker’s kitchen.
. It was a kind of rush that he couldn’t get from anything else.
Castiel blinked a few times and walked closer to Dean, so they were standing closer, wanting to give the other his full attention. "Of course I enjoyed kissing you. I've only wanted to do that for years, but of course, that was under different circumstances. And I'd definitely like more of it." He gave a small smile for reassurance. "I
The Empty’s face looked calculating as it considered the offer. The background screams that Dean could barely hear in the void seemed to get louder, and Dean watched as the Empty’s irritation became increasingly more obvious. With a sigh, the Empty snapped his fingers and Cas appeared next to them, lying asleep on the ground, his face molded in a painful expression that Dean never wanted to see again.
“I found him in Purgatory,
Dean sucked in a deep breath, willing away the emotions he’d finally allowed to break free. He could deal with his
Despite the feelings of hopelessness, Dean stayed up all night aimlessly searching for information about the Empty. He normally tried to get out of doing research, but he couldn’t sleep without returning to his nightmares. He could feel his eyes drooping and his head beginning to get hazy, but he just kept endlessly scrolling through online message boards and random websites that were mostly full of complete bullshit.
Dean took Cas’s limp hand into his own and thought about how Cas had woken up the first time. Jack had managed to get through to him by praying to him, by wishing for his return. Dean’s prayers had gone completely unheeded from Earth, but they were in the Empty now. Cas was
Meg, but I wasn't in love with her. It was...how do you say it? A game of cat and mouse of flirtations? When I kissed her, I wanted to test out what the pizza man did. And with April, there were no feelings attached, except possibly gratitude. It was out of curiosity."
Cas let out a soft laugh, filled with relief, as he stared into Dean’s eyes. “I love you too, Dean. Thanks for, you know—”
“Morning,” Dean said in a monotone, lifeless voice as he slumped into one of the chairs.
He swallowed and focused on Cas. “It’s not your fault. I should have said it earlier.
lose him again, and he was human now. He wasn’t used to fighting as a human the way the rest of them were. And Dean wasn’t getting any younger himself. As much as he never wanted to admit it, the hunts were wearing on his body in a way they never used to. He always felt creaky joints and aches and pains, and it was taking longer and longer to recover from every hunt. He wasn’t as fast or as strong as he used to be.
Dean grinned. "And how do you think I felt, fantasizing about an angel of the Lord?”

"We'll get him back, Dean," Sam said with a sense of hope that Dean wasn't sure he'd ever allow himself to feel again.
about how Cas summoned the Empty," Sam pointed out. "Even when I asked. You just told me we couldn't summon it the same way and to forget about it."
“Like what?” Rowena asked.
Their relationship wasn’t always smooth. They both had gone through so much, and they both had moments where they reverted back to being closed off or insecure. When Dean got into a bad mood, he would occasionally take out that anger on Castiel. The difference now was that they both were committed to being better, to apologizing when they messed up, and doing whatever they could to make up for their mistakes. They spent a lot of time bickering with each other, but if Dean was honest, teasing Cas was the highlight of most of his days. Most of their time together wasn’t filled with anger or pain any longer; now, they were fueled by love.
“Dean,” Cas said in a rough, confused voice. “What are you doing here?”
Sam frowned. “Well, there’s a few—”
where we need your help, Rowena. We know the spell that woke everyone up. We’re hoping you can take a look and see if you can come up with a spell to put everyone back to sleep,” Sam said.
He saw Dean working over the stove and walked forward, giving him a soft kiss on the cheek before turning towards the table with Sam and Eileen. "Hello, Sam and Eileen. I apologize on Dean's behalf for him stealing me from you."
“Just… take a shower, then,” Sam said.
“We’ll get you a whole new wardrobe. Whatever you need. But you can always borrow any of my clothes. I uh—I think I might like that,” Dean said. “You’re probably not all that comfortable in that suit and trenchcoat now that you’re human. It’s not exactly the most comfy outfit ever. Especially for just sitting around the house.”
Nothing else mattered. He caressed Cas’s cheek and kissed his forehead.
room soon. He usually kept things tidy, not wanting to make his sanctuary a mess, but he had been allowing things to pile up since he'd lost Cas. There were dirty dishes he never bothered to put away, random research books and hastily scrawled notes that cluttered the floor, and bits of clothing thrown everywhere. After cleaning everything else and making his bed, he started shoving all of his clothes into the laundry basket.
He’d buried his feelings for so long, but now he couldn’t ignore them. He’d tried pushing them down after Cas died. At first, he was able to push through just because they had to deal with Chuck. For so long, he’d felt like the only thing he needed to do was defeat Chuck. As soon as Chuck was defeated, he’d have free will and he could move on with his life.
Dean walked down the hallway to the laundry room and started piling his dirty clothes into the washer. More than a few of them were covered in blood or spilled alcohol stains. He shouldn't have let it pile up for so long, but he hadn't cared about keeping things sanitary. He hadn't really cared about anything.
Cas seemed to catch him staring and he tilted his head inquisitively, waiting for Dean to say the words that were clearly on his mind. The only problem was that thoughts were flying through Dean’s head at such a rapid pace that he didn’t even know where he wanted to start. There was still so much they needed to address, so much that Dean needed to apologize for, so much they needed to figure out about their new fledgling relationship, if that was even what this was. He still had no idea what Cas expected or wanted out of their relationship, even though they’d kissed and confessed their love.
“What could we possibly have that the Empty would want?” Dean asked.
Sam moved over to the bed and sat down on the edge to get on Dean’s level. “Bobby found a spell. I think we can get all the ingredients for it. It opens a portal to the Empty.”
“Yeah,” Dean replied. It was too early to say the ‘h’ word — hope — but it was the first time since Cas had died that he felt like they even had a shot. “Thanks, Sammy. For, uh. For not giving up on this.”
Dean ran his fingers through Cas’s hair and said, “You should get some sleep, sweetheart. I’ll still be here in the morning.”
. They could forge their own paths, no God writing their story for them or Empty deal keeping them apart.
"You didn't tell me
A warm smile formed on Castiel's face. Dean hadn't been this
“And how do you plan to do that?” Rowena asked.
Castiel got out of bed and stretched his arms and back out before realizing he
Their conversation was interrupted by the sounds of a loud boom. They both scrambled up from the floor and ran towards the library, where they saw Rowena smiling over a large bowl, her face covered in soot and her hair much frizzier and wild from whatever explosion she'd just created.
have been kind of a mess while you were gone.”
” He could do this. He could keep moving on. Cas wouldn’t want him to fall apart. It almost felt like he was outside of his body as he forced himself to leave the room and head into the library, where Sam was buried in a mountain of books.
Dean was excited at the prospect of being able to explore humanity with Cas, even if he still felt guilty that Cas had to lose his grace. There were so many experiences that Cas never could truly appreciate as an angel that he’d finally be able to understand. Even without losing his grace, Cas had been becoming more human for the past twelve years, and it felt like this was just the final step.
Dean pulled a folded up piece of paper out of his pocket and passed it over to the Empty along with the crystal. “That’s the incantation you’ll need. As soon as you say it, it should fill up with the grace of the angels in the Empty. Once it glows bright white, smash the crystal, and then a shockwave will break out and put everyone back to sleep.”
“I can’t say I love being dragged away from my throne by force, laddies, but it’s good to see you too,” Rowena stated. “And what scheme are the Winchester boys plotting that they need help from little old me?”
"The truth," Sam replied.
“Dean especially is an understatement,” Sam said with a roll of his eyes. “We had to find a way to get you back just to get Dean into a shower.”
, sleepyhead,” Sam said without taking his head out of the book. “Are you doing alright?
“I’m fine,” Dean grumbled as he sat up and stretched, feeling the ache in his body from falling asleep at the library table.
Their reunion was interrupted by Cas’s stomach growling, and Dean laughed at the humanness of the situation. “You want to get some food?”
“You still got billions of years worth of knowledge up in that noggin, baby, you know more about the forces in this world than any of us,” Dean said with a roll of his eyes. “And besides, you’ve always been worth a lot more to us than just your fancy angel powers.”
attractive, Cas. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t thought about, uh...you know, us. Together.”
He cleaned his own room after Cas's. Hopefully, it would be
At first, Cas’s face looked shocked as though he was unable to process what Dean was saying, but then a big smile began to form on his face. Smiles were rare for Castiel, and the few times Dean managed to extract a big one from him always made him feel so
“Would he rather be human or dead?” Sam questioned with a raised eyebrow.
Castiel felt a small smile form on his face at the knowledge that Jack had fulfilled his destiny. "I always knew he had it in him. I
"Everyone knows, Dean," Sam said with a half smile. "So then you told him you loved him too, and the Empty arrived?"
Things began to fall into place after that conversation. They reached out to all their hunter friends to talk about becoming a hub for hunter activity, and often brought in new hunters to the bunker to give them some one on one training to hopefully keep them alive. They made sure hunters had a partner whenever they went out on a case, and still researched to find cases and assign them to different groups of hunters.
in the void, and give the power to you, so you could put everyone back to sleep.”
Dean laughed and pulled away, but he kept Cas in his arms, unwilling to let go even for a second.
“We were such idiots. We could have had this for years,” Dean said as he slipped his hand under Cas’s shirt. “But that doesn’t matter anymore.”
Sam had been studying the bomb spell that Jack had used which woke everything up in the Empty, trying to figure out if there was anything in that spell that could hint at how to put the Empty back to sleep. Eileen was by his side most days, also helping with research. They signed half of the time they talked, and Dean couldn’t tell if it was just because Sam was getting better at signing or because they were talking about him behind his back. He felt like they were treating him like a bomb that was about to explode, and he supposed that he was.
He took in a deep breath and said, “
He looked down at his regular clothes and trenchcoat that he was still wearing. "I...might need some other clothes now that I'm human. I can sweat now. Angels don't perspire. And there’s all this blood I can’t vanish..."
"Yeah... Yeah," Dean said. He paused for a couple minutes as he sorted through his thoughts. "He made a deal. To save Jack when he was dying."
“So we need to find a witch?” Eileen asked.
he was now.
“Yeah, well, going down bloody might be what’s expected of hunters. It might be what
It felt like a weight had been lifted off him as soon as he said it and he could see the surprise in Cas’s eyes. “I love you,” Dean repeated, loving the way that it made his entire body feel lighter than it had in years. “I love you. I love you. I am
“So, uh, now that you’re back, what do you want to do?” Dean asked tentatively. “And uh… do you maybe…
need another blithering moron keeping me awake. If you think for a second I’m going to give you that angel of yours, you’re even more of an idiot than I would have thought. But then again, what else would I expect from the lover of the Empty’s most annoying angel?”
“No.  I mean, at public events you’ll have to.  But not in private.  I already asked Cas not to make you.”
He stares at me for what seems like forever, and I think he's going to send me packing, but then he doesn't.  "You're lucky I enjoy kissing you."
Feeling the most like myself I have in over a year, sitting here listening to these records gets my heart going.  It takes me back, and suddenly I'm not in this horrible place, but watching Dean work on the Impala, handing him his beer at the right moments, hearing his gruff laugh.  The music is like a soundtrack to my life, with Dean, and with Dad, one that already feels like a lifetime ago.
"So be it, Sam."
Mack raises his brows and does the impression of someone sucking a lemon.  They both know Dean pushed it on that ride, even though they didn’t go faster.  Dean can’t meet his eyes anymore.  “I will tell him you’re safely resting,” he says, but instead of leaving, he takes Dean’s arm.  “Once I know you are safely resting.”
Now, he’s watched.  Dean figures out why.  “It’s time.  I’m going to go on a fire fiend rampage any day now, aren’t I?”
I toss my bag to the floor and lay the blankets on one of the unmade cots, moving to undress, as quickly as possible.  Even through my fear, I'm hard as stone, my cock ready for him.  He approaches me, and I make sure to even out my breathing, showing exactly the right amount of fear.  I hold still, knowing any sudden move could set him off—it's not unlike dealing with the instincts of a lion, any small movement triggering an attack response.  I've learned this the hard way with Cas.  In past, I've attempted running, or backing away slowly, or making myself small.  All bad ideas.  Even though my heart is racing, I force myself against my instincts, and hold still as I can, making myself big, presenting myself in a way that tells him I'm going to do whatever he desires.
what he’s going with?  Fuck it.  “What the hell we doing here, Cas?”
"Father says, thou shall not lie."
The relief when I stand is worth it.  I grab my pack and look around.  There are at least thirty people in here I didn't even notice before, and they're all looking at me while pretending not to.  I wonder what kind of a maniac I looked like when I came in here?  I do weird little bow thing (totally unnecessary) and leave, joining back up with Claire.
Cas squints his eyes in a way that usually means trouble for me.  “Why would it?  The whole point is, you’ve accepted me for
I need rawness.  Sometimes, sanity means physicality.  Cas knows what I’m not asking with words.  Words are feeble.  Actions are power.
"I know that.  You're supposed to be a Winchester.  Why haven't you charged into it by now?"
She's a brave thing, this Claire, asking questions like that.  "Annoying as fuck," I tell her.
I gave a tight nod.  It was acknowledgement rather than permission; Cas doesn’t ask permission.
God no.  I'm pretty sure I pulled something in my groin doing that.  I don't say it though.  "I'm sorry, sir.  I'm just so tired.  I want to do this for you, I do, but I'm afraid I won't be able to."
Cas taps his collar.  “And if your Winchester stubbornness kicks in, I’ve got this.  I can’t promise you won’t end up in the dungeon again or that I won’t send you there myself depending on how you disobey me—"
Dean keens back on Cas’s cock, feeling it expand inside him, shots of desire burn through his limbs.  He needs to get closer, to have more of Cas inside him.  Dean’s cock leaks the useless fluid it produces, making Cas’s hand slicker.  “Alpha, Alpha I’m gonna come like that.”
Things you will need to know for this chapter:
He looks at me funny.
“No.”
I’m in too good a mood to care much and read more hoping what’s left of my brain will make some kind of a connection to something else I’ve read, since once again, this was clearly left for me to find and read.
"Gabriel's Community.  We didn't take it," he explains pumping his finger in and out of me idly, like he's filing taxes.
—in a feeble attempt to get him to release me before I pass out.
Jack looks back to me, and I nod.  "Yes, Father."
comment, but I do want to ask him not to do that.  "I'm good Cas, knock yourself out."
But here's the thing.  I have decided to tackle Finding Sammy, which was an even bigger job than I had anticipated.  Partly due to the content, as it's heavy stuff that's hard to traverse at this time, and partly due to structure, the way I have to lay the pieces down for the plot is complicated and even having an outline (which I never use, but attempted for this) was unhelpful.  It's not just a matter of knowing where events go, it's an art, so that I can make sure the story is told in an exciting way.
"Just standing, facing the wall is fine.  Ten minutes."
“Yes, Master.”  Dean’s always been good with directions.
meadow is whole.
“Bingo.  That guy.”
None of it was near anything Lucifer had done, there was pain that had me crying out, but I could handle it, only, it got
“Then logic dictates if you do that again, you can beam us back.”  He looks worried.  “What’s wrong?”
Whatever it is, I surrender to it.
The little boy in him who needs the stern, caring father aches but the grown man in him hopes he’ll change his mind and go home.
The intensity builds and Dean pants, inhaling and exhaling slow and heavy, preparing for what’s to come.  All at once it hits, Dean’s cock lights up with arousal and Dean has to touch his cock.  He has to touch it, or he’ll die.
“Even when we do, it’ll only be hate-sex.”  But oh what amazing hate-sex it will be.
“Whoa, too much Cas.  I can’t learn that the Earth is hollow
“That is, if you wish me to come, Master?”
Angel politics are fucking weird.  “Look, Gadreel.  I’ll say it again.  I’m fucking sorry your friend is dead because of me.  How can I make it up to you?”
“Why don’t you give me the book again, Dean-o?  I’ll take another read through.”
“I was.
Dean only comes once but he’s seriously dipped into his limited funds for cumming.  He’s going to have to be careful if he doesn’t want to go over his allotted from Cas.  This is going to be harder than he thought.
“You know why.”
Dean huffs.  He’s fucking impossible.  But instead of the angry lion Cas is trying to imitate, all Dean sees is a scared kitten.  He’s just posturing.  Dean calling Cas by his name is too intimate for him.  Annihilate thousands of demons?  Sure.  Use his name?  He can’t handle it.
When my hands are out, the golden cuffs from before return, chaining my wrists together, with some slack.  He guides me over to the wall where there is a hook, and it's so high, I have to stand on my tiptoes to hook the chain over it.  It's a terrible position to be in, not quite dangling, but not solid on the ground either.  My ass feels raw, and burns.  I can feel blood soaking into my boxers.
"No," I say, crying the whole time.  "I won't.  I'm coming with you, Cas.  You think he can stop me leaving? He won't.  I'll follow after you and I don't care what you do to me."  I hug his leg and cry into it pouring all my sadness outward at him.  I don't care how fucking pathetic I look.
“Of course, Castiel, but I’m supposed to explain this place to you and how your mate might use it.  You’ll have to help him, if you are willing.”
Lucifer bites his lip.  Sam didn’t say he couldn’t but that doesn’t mean anything.  “I have—but not a lot,” he’s quick to defend.
“Daddy says I hafta pee, Sammy.”
“It’s a kindness.  Your master has a soft spot for your pretty green eyes.  He was advised to give you much worse.”
I never thought to think that the reason we always walk with the army to the edge, is because he
“Master, please.  I’m fucking sorry.”  He means it.  Now that he’s had the luxury of perspective, he can think of about a million other ways he could have distracted Cas.  Cas still would have been mad he talked to Sam but probably not in a furious rage.
“Not a tantrum Daddy, I was just gonna ask—”
“Why would he do that?  He said I wasn’t ready.”  Cas was very fucking clear on that point.
"I can't help wondering how practical this is, Cas, if we're headed into dangerous territory."
then why take me in the first place?  Why not get to know me, see if me being with you is what I want?”
Dean keeps his mouth clenched shut.  He refuses to answer.
“don’t you do anything, kid?”
“We won’t know for a few weeks, you know this.”
My art tends to come out in various ways, and if you follow my blog, you know I am also an artist.  Instead of sketching, lately, my art has come out as various makeup looks.  This may not sound like art at first glance, but I tend to do some very artsy stuff that can take up to 3 hours *shocked face*.  It's been a lot of fun and I get as lost in it as I do my writing.
, but he speaks.  “I like that story.  I expect you to tell me more like that in future.”
“You two will get along if I have to knock your heads together.  I’ve had enough of your bickering.”  Sam has a lot to do if he wants to overthrow the current Emperor.  He doesn’t have time for their childishness.
is a better way to describe it?  In any case, it decreases one's presence.  Not good for fighting otherworldly creatures."
Holding off is also on the advice of Fire Dad.  He’s worked hard to get to nine days without losing his mind over his standard eight, using the stimulo-thing-y Fire Dad got for him from somewhere, plus sex.  Ten has been the next hurdle and fuck, it was hard not to ask Michael for permission—permission he would have gladly given him.  It’s becoming somewhat of a challenge to get Dean to let you give him permission, or to use one of his coveted “permission slips” when Cas is away.
"How am I going to eat like this?"
fairies and who knows what they’ve got in store for us?  At the same time, I don’t want Cas ripping anyone’s head off.
“Another round?” Cas says.  This just after a brutal battle in which he’s defeated Dean spectacularly.  Cas can go all night.
He nods.  “You miss your job, don’t you?”
“Because of Azazel,” Lucifer says, nodding along.
“No.  You may voice your concern, but I suspect it’s not just concern Dean.  However, I will endeavor not to get frustrated over it.”
"You're going to find your brother, Dean," he says.  I freeze, because I never told him that, and Cas wouldn't.  "Your nightmares."
Dean watches a live action battle take place.  Demons pour up from “Earth” and the Guardians fight them.  Urgent excitement blazes through Dean as he observes them like he’d watch a hockey game.  He wants Team Angel to win only because he set them up.  Otherwise, he might enjoy them getting picked off.  The battle goes like he envisioned.  When the front-line defenses weaken, the line he had rounding the back moves up to help.
Fuck.  I spot Sammy.  He’s still got Jack with him.  I’m not sure which place is better for the kid, here or with us.  There’s no time to pass him off anyway, so he’s coming with.  I whistle for Hika to follow.  He does, calling to his mate to stay here and fight alongside Gabriel and Cas.  I know they won’t be able to hold Lucifer off forever.
Cas pauses.  Can he feel what Dean feels?  Does he care?  “Then rest.  I will watch over you personally.”
Dean’s gut lurches thinking about her, abandoned at that diner, forever.  Plus there was a bunch of shit in the trunk other people should never find.
Dean nuzzles his neck like he’s a rabbit marking his territory.  “We’ll still have sex though, right?”
“How is your arousal?”
Dean’s way into the headspace by this point, and he involves himself in a game where the ship captain has to thwart the giant, monster duck.  He’s so involved, he doesn’t really notice Daddy watching him,
Sam gives a curt nod.  “Complete these tasks and I’ll take you for the first time in my new castle.”
"I have, Father.  I will be more careful."
"I'll say it again, and maybe you'll hear me this time.  I don't see any universe in which I mate with you.  You're the creature who had my brother…" my voice cracks, "…who had my brother killed."  I don't let Dean creep into my thoughts much, at least not yet.  I spend the majority of my time working on what I know Dean would want most, me escaping Lucifer.
But no matter how hard he tries, he doesn’t sleep.
He stares at me in awe and something is there for him, but I don’t know what.  I don’t know if I should speak.  Is something expected of me?  Dean was sure a bond was supposed to happen, but I don’t feel bonded to him.  Oh God, will we have to perform the bonding ritual?  I’m not sure I’d survive it.
Dreyous finishes dinner.  He’s taken to making extra in case Dean drops by.  When Dean’s completed his tasks, the tears finally dry and he watches Dreyous cook.  It’s a comfort he didn’t know he needed.  The man is a legend on the field, the way he can wield fire is what Dean can only hope for.  In the kitchen he’s just as smooth.  He enjoys it as much as he likes creating waves of blue fire.
Lucifer prefers old methods of travel.  He likes people to anticipate him arriving and then sequentially, watch him arrive, his massive army slowly making their way through their town, or setting up camp outside a
"Find the spots that look dry, where feathers might be falling out, and apply it.  I can bend and shift them as you need.  There are plenty of things to climb on to reach spots as well.  You don't need much.  Pour a small amount on, and stroke it into the area, up and down the feathers."
Cas removes his shirt and wrings out his cloth, continuing to work on the rest of him.  It’s a slow and tedious process.  Cas must be low on life force too.
prefer to say goodbye," he corrects.
Several humans have been gathering any passers by on the roads, and whoever else has decided to squat in the abandoned city on their way to who knows where, herding us to stand before the large stone platform.  We have been told there is a place open for humans to live, and that someone is going to arrive shortly, to tell us all about it.
“What about Gadreel? Won’t he be mad us doing stuff in broad daylight like this?”
Dean’s groggy.  He wipes the sleep from his eyes. “Cas?  You okay?”
Cas wipes the blood from Dean’s chin and licks it off his thumb. “I must go.  Do as I have asked.”
“We had a deal, Sam.  I’ve been very generous and trusting, giving you payment upfront.  Are you saying I can’t trust you, Sam?”
I can feel he’s just as confused though and it’s fucking with him just as much.  He’s not deliberately trying to mess with me, nor am I with him, but this is messing with both of us.  At least on that, we’re in the same fucked up boat and that’s comforting.
love.  Sam relaxes into Hika and something seems to shift in him. “W-What do we do now, Dean?”
When he's done with me, it's a good thing we're walking, because sitting is a distant memory.
Dean checks the cell door again.  The wide-open cell door.  “Don’t even think about it.  Your Master will be displeased if you try to run.  If you don’t like what’s been done to you so far, you’ll like a real punishment even less.”
I won't do it.  I won't beg him not to.
“I have to put just as much faith in you not to tell Castiel about this and I don’t have the luxury of a tattoo on your body to give me solace.”
“I-I’m not sure.”  The lion
"They are being washed.  And we'll give you some fresh things more suited to your tastes."
I rub the back of my neck sheepishly.  "Yeah.  Wasn't on purpose."
When I move to leave, he's there, he grabs my arm, and it doesn't take much of his angel strength to throw me and pin me to the wall.  I can't move, stuck, and at his mercy.  It's not unheard of for Lucifer to slap my face in a way that feels more like a brick hit it, or choke me 'till I forget I'm not in the water, or throw me around the room like I'm a fucking baseball.
"Then I'm going in."  I pull the keys out, and start removing myself from Baby and away from him.
“So, you also keep saying.”  Sam doesn’t believe him.  Sam lets the angel blade fall into the light, lets the sun glint off it so Lucifer can see.  “Come here.”
Daddy takes position in front of Dean, so he’s standing over his bare ass.  “I’m going to need you to pry your cheeks apart for me and keep your hands out of target range, or that’s going to hurt, isn’t it?”
I nod and kiss his crown, and give him quiet comfort.
“I’ve told you; I have no plans on killing you, ever.  If you should think your service to me is going to end so easily, perhaps you need to do some more thinking.”
It was in the baths Dean saw so many kinds of cocks.  He didn’t mean to, but they were just there, flailing about.  He couldn’t help comparing his to other omegas cocks and notice that he was above average in size.
With a swipe of his hand, and an army of angels and demons at his beck and call, he can do a lot of things that makes this sort of busy-work unnecessary, but Lucifer claims that way of things is far more work to maintain.  According to him, laying the groundwork from the beginning, forging the right
What the fuck?  Since when do angels do shit like that?
“And I cancelled my day.  Teleapài is right.  We’ve had little time together, which doesn’t help your hormones or our youngling.”
“What do we do?”  At some point, they’ll be working closely together.  Dean liked the idea of having Michael as a fuck buddy.  Dean rubs his arm.  The one with the new tattoo still covered by his jacket.
"There are very distinct welt marks there—I'd say this was a belt.  Leather."
Daddy continues with his coffee and Dean continues with his toy until Daddy notices him rubbing his eyes.
This is the line for him.
, do you need a time out to cool down?”
“If the physician is all right with it.  But room and board require payment.”
“What is it?” Dean says when it’s done.
“We should probably stay out of sight.  We’re kinda open right now, which can’t be good.  Off in the distance there, we’ll head into that forest.  I should probably find something to eat.”
"You're not actually fine, are you?"
“Regardless, I wish you wouldn’t have. There’s no saving me, but you could have lived a good life.”
“And you haven’t touched it?  Not even a graze?  Shift of the pants maybe?”  Cas smiles, hoping.
"It's not something I'm used to doing, truth be told, but I'm guessing like the praying, we're going to have to, so we should figure some things out.  Does Castiel have any methods beyond this?" he asks referring to what's already on my body.
“I don’t, I don’t,
Cas starts walking at his breakneck pace.  I have no choice but to follow.
Gabriel gets a call on angel radio.  They need him across the Garrison.  A new recruit cursed by an object.  Balthazar’s not here.  It’s not Michael’s specialty.  Gabriel has to go.  It will cut their session short but Dean’s sure he’s done enough ‘humbling’ he’ll be okay.  He would have liked to suck Gabriel’s cock or something but there will be another day.
“Isn’t that your name?”
I sit up, hardly believing he’d delay for as long as that just for me.  Does he actually give a shit?  I don’t think too long on that, sitting up to assess the damage.  Hand still broken, ribs too.  Ass feels like it’s had a hiding, body feels slightly seared from Angel-Grace-Acid, and like tenderized meat at the same time.  I’ll live though.
“Just …” Cas pulls Dean in for another kiss. He rests his forehead to Dean’s. “No. Get your work done.” Cas slaps his ass. Dean rolls his eyes so Cas can see.
I haven’t been with Cas long enough for him to know all about me.  Telling people shit about me isn’t really my way, I’m more about keeping Winchester secrets close, but with Cas I’m driven to tell him everything about me, much to his dismay.
You’ve accepted our life for how it is.  You love me, because of who I am, as I am.  You love someone for their values, not because they’ll change them for you.”
“This isn’t normal,” he said.  “You’re not supposed to love me.  You do because of your upbringing.  It’s broken you on a fundamental level.”
When Cas pulls him up, he’s got tears.  “Cas,” he says.  And freezes.  His heart pounds in his ears as he waits to be beaten or something else horrible.
"Stop that," he says continuing with another lash.  His pressure is intense; he's not planning on making this an easy three hundred.  "You can do it, you are strong."
Dean stares off into the direction we came.  He shakes his head.  "No.  We'll run into him that way, and we can't fight him.  Fighting him is suicide."
He smiles, enjoying how obedient I am.  “We’ll have plenty of time in the morning when you’re well-rested.”  He kisses my forehead.  “Eat, sleep, recharge.”
"Ever since… but I beat you almost to death.  I thought that didn't sit well with humans."  It's clear he can't imagine why.  Angels have some really different ideas about that stuff.
“I told you, we’re bonded now.”
Hope you enjoyed this.  More fun to come!
, it took everything in me not to roll away.  He was more relentless the second round and the
When Dean wakes up, he notices he’s already peed and will need Daddy’s help, but then he remembers Sammy’s here!  Maybe he’ll go see if he’s awake first.  Only, Dean knows the rules well.  He’s supposed to wait for Daddy to help him.  No problem, he’ll investigate Sammy first then climb back in bed and call for Daddy.  Easy, peasy.
“Come.”
I nod.  Where he goes, I go.  We're a package deal.
She does.  And we're gone, but before we disappear into nothing, I check for the kid; he's gone.  Whether he vanished or ran, I don't know.  Either way, it's for the better.
"Jack.  Where's Jack?" I remember.  I also remember his face when I was going into my fit.  We were riding in the carriage, it suddenly came on, I couldn't stop the screaming.
"Father, today I ask for forgiveness.  I was careless with your gift to me.  It was a sin against you, it was a sin against Cas."  I always include Cas when asking for forgiveness.  Cas elbows me.  "It was a sin against,
down.  Even if he hasn't mated with Sam, do you have any idea how many mates he's taken in his time?"
He's probably right, but it's all I got.  If I'm going down, I'm going down with confidence. "You don't know Dean Winchester.  I'm incredibly charming.  I'll have the angel wrapped around my finger in no time."
Like this, Dean’s exposed.  Everything.  His hole is spread wide.  His balls hang heavy against his taint.  His cock is the
“Wait.  You haven’t seen the best part yet.  Stay out of sight and be very quiet,” Gabriel says with the excitement of a little boy.
Dean’s eager.  “Shall I disrobe?”
It’s not nearly enough sleep later, he’s waking me.  “How long was I out?”
"S-Sammy,
“But you’ve got the temper of a fire fiend, and a Winchester.”
relief I'm feeling, but it's worse.  I'm looking forward to being back in his arms.  I want him to forgive me – I'm desperate for him to forgive me.
Cas leans over, his scent of man sweat and cologne seeps into Dean, along with is husky voice.  “Loosen your dressing-cloak from the waist and open the front flap wide.  I want everyone to see our unborn youngling within you and how aroused you are without having come all this time.”
“Fine.  You’re super fucking clever.  What do you want?”
“I wouldn’t be as sure as I can feel you are.  Did you call Hika back, so you could tell him to stay away for a bit?”
Dreyous smiles.  “That’s quite the feat young child of fire.  It can take a lot more time than that.  We lose a lot of curtains in our homes in the spring when many new young ones are coming into their powers.”
I nod in a sleepy way, a bit drunk with the bond magic washing through me as I surrender in my body and mind together.  The more pain, the greater the level of submission required, the more submission, the greater the bond responds.  I almost can't reject it, almost, but I can and Cas is right, I'm still resisting.
“If you’re feeling sorry for yourself, remember it could be worse.  I petitioned to have your cock and balls removed.”  Dean blanches.  Holy fuck.  What is wrong with this place?  “But you’re Cas’s mate.  Everyone sided with him on that one.”
Enjoy.
“Stop,” Gabriel’s says.  He’s smiling.  “Would you like to serve me, Dean?”
Holy fuck.  I have to swallow hard.  Bed.  Sex.  He's talking about fucking me.  God, yeah.  Okay.
, but I used the premise of emotions.  From what little I understand, it seems to me you would need to feel calmed from the anxiety of me leaving.  I know humans use various things to soothe.  My jacket seemed the logical choice, since you would associate it with me.”
“That’s not happening, Cas.”
"I do."  He doesn't deny it.
says something about how we must look.
Dean’s not totally “right” or “normal” sure, but neither’s Sam.
“All right.”  It’s the right suggestion.  Dean gets so engrossed in building Professor Norris a fortress, he forgets all about Daddy until Daddy is knelt beside him.
It’s exhilarating and the most excitement I’ve had in a while.
I do the best I can, there's a lot of preamble that doesn't make much sense, and some stuff I'm going to have to ask Lucifer about.  It does pull me in though, this Archer guy is a good writer, and while it is a book of prophecy, it's also a journal.  He throws in bits about his life.  He and Roark were buddies.  Wait no, not buddies.
In the morning, Lucifer is less calm, but his mood is safe enough I ask about the bath.  I feel weird asking about it.  Why do I deserve something like that?  I can’t think of a reason, only that I want it.  I have a private bath at home, but here I could bathe in the public one.  Except, we’ve been on the road for months and it’s been a long time without being able to sit and soak.  “Luci?  Would it be all right for me to take a bath, in the private baths?”
Daddy let’s Dean feed himself the grilled cheese, which is another big boy surprise, but Daddy feeds him the veggies, which is probably for the better.  That way, Dean doesn’t have to think about it and just eats the icky things.  “Vegetables is ick, Daddy,” Dean makes sure Daddy knows.
Dean swallows.  “Yes, sir.”  Normally none of that is a problem.  But it’s Sammy.
Does he care?  It seems like he does.  Cas is not the manipulative sort, not when it comes to me, not when it comes to anything really, but I tend to mistake his actions for human ones and they are not.  It messes with my head.  Unintentionally, but still, so I try to keep it all separate in my head.  I explain this little interaction as Cas learning a language he never intends on speaking.  “No.  Not the you not explaining yourself to me – that’s your prerogative.”
Cas is still apprehensive to say, like maybe saying would lay his heart bare, and strip him of every power he ever had.  His eyes are wide as they fill with tears that don’t spill, he takes Dean’s hands in his.  “It means, my breath, because without you, I cannot breathe.”
that kid?  I get up slowly, trying to get my bearings, so I can grab the kid and run, but I'm surrounded this time.  "Hi, Dean," one, a dude-one, says all friendly-like.
it brings.  The closer to orgasm I get, the more I need the orgasm, my whole body builds with delicious passion.  When I come it feels worth it until I return to Earth and remember where I am and who I asked to jerk me off.
"The Royalty do.  They are taught various languages.  Most fairies speak another language in fact, but only the royal court and the guard are taught varying degrees of other languages.  The guard wouldn't be likely to know Enochian."
Well, that fucking sucks.
He knows anyway.  "You tremble at the very thought of it – how delicious.  Why?  I'm surprised you even need to ask.  It's the one place I can be guaranteed you won't be causing trouble while I'm gone, not to mention how much I would love the thought of you suffering for me."
There's more to this, I know it, and I'm also fucking curious, but I don't feel like a beating just now.  "How can I help, Cas?"
, that I’m pleasing Lucifer, living the lie is possible, if exhausting.
When I've got the collar secured in place, I attach the leash, which is long and's got a loop at the end.  Cas opens his jacket, and begins undoing his belt.  "You may stand," he says, and I do, and when I am, he loops the leash onto his belt, and then secures it.
"We are
“Come,” Daddy says, and Dean knows to follow when he hears that tone.  Some tones you just don’t mess with.
Cas cracks a smile that makes his face look too much like an ad for POLO by Ralph Lauren.  No wonder serial killers can lure people into their mini-vans.  They all look like Cas right now before they pickle your nuts in a tea kettle.  Cas kisses his forehead
"The boy has to learn, you said so yourself."
"You don't listen very well."
“The same way any Major does, I suppose.  Run drills.”
Cas usually doesn't wait on me, which is why a simple gesture like that stands out.  He fishes what I've got in my pack out and hands it to me.  "Is it your foot, or your leg?" he asks.
“I’m feeding you at a rate that won’t give you a tummy ache, my little boy.  Behave yourself.”
forgive me.  I understood from my end, but not from his.  Angels are conditioned differently than humans are, but they haven’t escaped conditioning.  This is Cas’s method, he’s not going to get to forgiveness in any other way.
"Good."  The flap of his wings, and Gadreel is gone. See? He flies like a normal angel should.
But I don’t.
"Yup," she says. "This Community's been here since the beginning of, well,
this side of enough.
Lucifer likes to wear white dress shirts, and black slacks, with shiny black belts, and shoes, which is an odd way for the prince of darkness to dress, in my opinion.  He does look good though; I hate how good, how
Cas slams his hand on his makeshift desk.  “We’re losing this war, Dean.  We hang by a fucking thread.  The teeter totter is teetering in their favor.”
“Happy to, Sammy.”
That’s comforting.  “D-Do you miss him?”
not get squashed by Lucifer's army.  I run, and make it to the edge, getting myself out of trample territory.  By this point, the fairies have the upper hand, I realize that, they can fly better, without the confines of the underground ceiling, and the bright-light mother fuckers start surrounding me.
"I have a proposition for you.  Now that the world as humans once knew it has ended, and angels rule the Earth, it only makes sense that we need a ruler for the angels."
“What do you want, Jack?  I’m busy.”
There’s a knock on the door and two people—angels—enter carrying a large whip that has Dean tremoring.  That’s for him.  He knows it’s for him.  He gives Castiel pleading eyes.  He grips the blanket.  “You’re going to be punished for trying to escape, Dean.”
“We need to give it something it wants — to get everyone back to sleep,” Sam explained.
Sam shrugged. “The only thing I know it wants is to go back to sleep.”
But now, Chuck was gone and Dean was as miserable as he’d ever been. He tried to put on a brave face for Sam. He could tell from some of his brother’s worried glances that he wasn’t completely buying it, but Dean was surviving. Sure, he hadn’t showered in a week and was probably destroying his liver with the copious amounts of alcohol he was drinking, but he was alive. He just kind of wished he wasn’t.
When he saw Dean nod for confirmation, Castiel nodded back, absorbing everything. "I see, that’s good. The world is in balance. We did it.
“It worked by drawing power from you, and then basically used that power to create a shockwave that spread throughout the Empty,” Dean said. He shook the crystal again and said, “This can help do the opposite. It can draw from the power of everyone
The Empty squinted its eyes and glanced between the crystal and Dean’s face, likely wondering if Dean was telling the truth.
you never tried a proper pie. That’s going to have to be remedied.”
“Bingo,” the Shadow said. “And what the Hell are you doing here? You don’t belong here, and I
“Yeah… I don’t know,” Sam said with a frown. “We’re going to need to come up with something. Maybe we can make a deal with the Empty.”
was his fault.
Castiel had not realized they had an audience, so when Rowena spoke, he scrambled a bit out of surprise, but Dean just chuckled and held him still, not caring that they were caught in an intimate moment. The red flush of embarrassment on Castiel's face was evident as he said, "Oh...I - I didn't know we weren't by ourselves. Human senses are...quite dull."
Sam’s eyebrows shot up. “Are you serious? You want to quit hunting?
Sam looked up from the book and gave a half shrug. “Not really. There’s not much lore on the Empty to look through, but I’ll keep looking. Bobby said he might have a lead, but he said he wasn’t sure if it would pan out.”
Dean reached out and cupped Cas’s cheek, smiling at him as he asked, “What, you don’t think you deserve to be saved?”
Sam furrowed his brow and stared at him with that same concerned look that Dean was beginning to think was a permanent expression for his brother. "Come on, Dean. Talk to me."
“You could probably… make him human enough to trick the portal,” Sam suggested.
you to take the angel tablet.”
“And, you know, there’s so much other stuff we’ve never gotten to do before. So many new human experiences. Now that Chuck’s gone—”
“We need to save Cas,” Dean said without hesitation.
“Cas, there’s… there’s so much I need to say to you,” Dean said. Cas opened his mouth as if he was going to say something, but Dean shook his head. “You left me, man. You told me you loved me, and then you
“All I want in return is Cas,” Dean said. “And I won’t tell you how to use this until you give him to me.”
