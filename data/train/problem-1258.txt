“I couldn’t very well let you die, and to hell with your brother. I don’t care if he’s a Grand Master. ‘Love is a defect’, what rot is that? I bet he cares very much for Damir, bet he cried like a baby when he bonded with him.”
“Mr Moriarty’s normally alright too, he must have just been forgetful today. We’ve been over that bit before, and he did it right the other time” said a tall girl from the other side of the table. John didn’t miss her small scowl aimed at Sherlock; he remembered being on the receiving end of his fair share of those from Harry as a kid.
“Greg, it’s John, Sherlock said to have that mystery phone on hand, I think he thinks we’re about to get another call on it.”
“What? I’m the head of maintenance and supply, keep the place clean, well stocked, and fed,” his voice squeaked a bit as he made his case to his fellow Masters. John snorted lightly, trying not to laugh at his superiors.
“Oh! Don’t fuss with it, that’d be one of Sherlock’s things!” she replied, as though it was perfectly average to find severed appendages in the flat. John cast a worried glance at the fridge when that seemed to be the end of the conversation.
“A little girl huh?” Molly said with a smile, “of course she can, both of you are staying here for now. She’s had a rough hatchday. You just come tell me if she’s feels poorly at all, I’ll be right over in the front office.” Molly told him quietly. The whole affair was calm and quiet, John could have probably heard a pin drop in that stall. “I know you don’t want to let go of her, but please come tell us if you need anything, if anything feels off,” she added. But Luke only had eyes for the hatchling already appearing to fall asleep in his lap.
“I’ve met your parents Sherlock; your mada had stories for days about her squealing, spiny, little blotling climbing on everything and disturbing the peace,” John said fondly. He bumped lightly against Sherlock as he put his mug away as well. John caught a bit of annoyance twined with affection in the small contact, and he left another slightly orange blotch on Sherlock as he pulled away. “Basically how you are now without so much squealing and fewer spines,” John added.
“You’ve seen babies before. They always seem much bigger right after they’re born, room to spread out after being tightly confined. Dragon hatchlings aren’t any different.”
Sherlock beat John home. John had gone across to Bellamy’s pit only to find the door locked. He’d trudged on home to their street where a little more slush had built up and looked up at the warm light coming from the second story windows. God only knew why Sherlock was in such a rush. If it was because of the weather Sherlock was more equipped on a regular basis for their current level of frigidness than John was, what with his gloves and wool coat and scarf. If anything John slightly looked forward to the warmer months just to see Sherlock out and about in fewer layers.
“Aw don’t want to see your pet hurt?” Jim cooed over at Sherlock, even as Sherlock tried to struggle against his bonds. “You know, this way you get to see him alive a little longer? He just slowly gets turned into bits, easy to remove pieces first.” Her grip on John’s shoulder receded and John let out the breath he’d been holding against the pain. But her touch didn’t go away, making John cringe again as one of those long black nails traced gently along his skin, down his arm, up his ribs, nearly tickling in its delicacy. “Fingers, toes, ears,” Jim’s hand came up to pinch the closest earlobe, tugging playfully even as she was threatening to remove said body part.
John couldn’t help himself and added another kiss of his own to Sherlock’s nearest high cheekbone. “Night Sherlock, see you in the morning,” and with that they finally separated. John up the stairs to his room  and Sherlock down the hall to his. They both went about their evening routines, as much as Sherlock had one, as usual, only maybe a little closer. With another pair of ‘goodnight’s shared and another pair of kisses exchanged John retreated to his room upstairs a smile still on his face.
John nearly face-planted in his struggle to get off; it was only for the fact that Bellamy’s head was curled around to help him that he didn’t crack his skull on the pavement. He grabbed at her snout, his shoulder screaming in protest as he brought his bad arm into play, gripping smooth scales as she lifted him from being hung upside down by his feet on the saddle cables. Bellamy put him down safely, feet on the ground as gentle as Hyperion ever was with him.
“There is one upstairs if you feel you need it,” Sherlock said as he pulled off his coat and hung it on the back of the door.
Sherlock’s freed hand reached down to grip John’s ankle, slowly drawing that hand up the length of John’s leg up over his thigh and the dusting of hair there, gathering as much of the slick substance on his skin as he could into his hand. John let out a relaxed sigh as he felt Sherlock’s mouth roam to the side, kissing at the crease of thigh and hip.
while carefully peeling the small pads of gauze away from the wounds on his shoulder. They were healing well so far, but he’d always bear a set of ragged starburst scars.
, John thought, shuffling across the bed to sit in front of the closed frosted glass door. Sherlock wasn’t making any noise. He formed up a mouth, not wishing to just barge in.
Following a short and cryptic conversation the car was quiet again, and John had no idea where they were or even really where they were going, though he hoped that at least they were heading south after Sherlock. And then they stopped. John looked out the window only to see brown fencing with a gate number on it.
“Oh yes, dragons will shed teeth all through their lives; they grow right back. Not like sharks, it takes some time, but unless you get a break instead of the whole tooth coming out they are just fine,” Molly informed him cheerily, sounding completely happy to share her knowledge with John. Lestrade returned with the step stool she’d asked for and she took it and went round to Hyperion’s right eye first, snapping the stool open and climbing up so she was level with his eye. She checked his eyes with the flashlight, the large golden orbs twitching as she directed them so she could get a good look at them. Once she was done she praised him and petted his eyebrow ridge where most people couldn’t reach from the ground. She did the same with his other eye, directing, checking, praising, petting.
Mary had on a belt that looked similar to the one Sherlock wore when he was riding, only a little more roughed up and smaller, with a cable strung between two of the loops at one hip. She clipped the cable to the hoop she’d rolled out and John nearly shot out of his seat as she asked Hyperion if he would pick her up and he felt Hyperion consent across the bond. Hyperion grabbed hold of the hoop with his mouth, Mary sitting on it, and John watched as he lifted it and her from the floor.
John had forgotten to order drinks, but the lovely Emma had seen the bottle in their bag without glasses and had put a pair of small McDonalds cups in the other bag. John looked from the empty M emblazoned cup to the unopened bottle sitting next to Sherlock. Grappa wasn’t exactly like wine, it wasn’t meant to be served up in doses more than a shot glass. But it was something to drink, and it was either that or water.
“Not all of them, and the ones you actually reply to sound interesting,” John said. He actually wished there were more to the replies; often when reading through them there was only the plea for help and a brief explanation and Sherlocks incredibly short but no less interesting reply like ‘the sister-in-law did it, the fish is dead, vacuum cleaner was the murder weapon’
John completely forgot to tell Sherlock about the person he thought he’d seen; by the time he’d remembered he’d thought himself out of telling. Maybe an employee had gotten to work early, or Mycroft sent a minion to check if John had transformed again, or maybe he’d just been seeing things and there was no one at all. If he saw them again he’d bump Sherlock or something.
Sherlock shoved him into a stall and threw a pair of swim shorts over the door. They landed on him. “Sherlock, I can’t wear these,” John said.
John patted Hyperion’s foreleg, “stay here,” he told him, grabbing his discarded cane quickly when he felt the flare of shared pain in his leg. As John hobbled his way towards the steward he heard shuffling behind him and turned back with a sharp look to see Hyperion shakily trying to raise himself to just sitting on his hindquarters. “I said stay put, just for a moment. I’ll be right back,” John said. Hyperion returned to his pose on his belly, his long tail twitching away while his finger-like talons fidgeted with the edge of his mat, and his long dark tongue flicked out to scent the air for his food. The bond buzzed with a pleading, ‘I’m hungry feed me!’ so strong John’s own stomach grumbled at him.
John wandered over to him chuckling and wrapped an arm around Sherlock’s waist, pulling him back into his side. The pair of them wobbled on through the aquarium, John laughing his arse off at Sherlock’s sporadic comments about the creatures in the various tanks big and small along their way.
John thought, ripping his eyes off the handsome sight and going back to Hyperion who was floating with his wings stretched on the surface, nestlings and workers already swimming around him and climbing on him to clean him.
Sherlock couldn’t see John, feeling the rough thrusts of a cock frighteningly close to his unprepared anus. Rather than pleasure at the roughness of it, little flickers of a recent time, when it had turned from rough into agonizing flittered across his eyes.
He suddenly shivered all over in a sort of laugh, whole form scrunching a little as he remembered gleefully the first time Sherlock had appeared at a crime scene skin colored completely in a brilliant bright orange. Lestrade’s first reaction had been to worry that Sherlock might be ill, having not become close with Mycroft yet. The human had changed colors quite spectacularly in a blush as Sherlock bluntly told him he’d just recently had intercourse with John. John, standing nearby, had turned an impossibly brighter shade of reddish-orange, that same primitive side proud of the public marking, even though a small irritated spike sprang up at Sherlock’s candor. Lestrade had mentioned that the pair of them looked like a living tequila sunrise, the bright yellow and red pair of them sitting next to each other mingling to make orange. An audible huff brought him back to the present and there sat Sherlock, tea finished.
“God yes,” John replied, arms still spread wide to catch the wind even as Sherlock let go of his wrists to wrap himself loosely around John’s waist again.
John didn’t even have time to stop Sherlock from opening his mouth again as he slung a single question at her, “Breeding with Manuka soon then?” He said it knowing it would get a rise out of Sally, and it certainly did, her hand paused in its place on Melinda’s cheek, even at a distance he could see her tense.
Out of the corner of his eye John saw Lestrade wave for Molly, who slowly got up onto Hyperion’s mat and began working. She made careful contact with Hyperion’s skin, laying a hand on his hind foot first, just so he knew she was there. Hyperion’s head quickly tilted, lifting off the ground and looking sharply out of the corner of his eye back down the length of himself at Molly a short hiss curling his lip. He held his position, obeying John’s request, but a tension hung in the air.
Sherlock’s eyebrows went up when he saw John return to him with the very different looking bags. “You bought dinner?” he commented, eyes going to the bags before shooting up to John’s grinning face.
The assertion that more people than Sally treated Sherlock that way made John feel sad for him. The Aerie people and riders seemed like a pretty tight-knit group, nearly a family; to live there and be ostracized like Sherlock seemed to be for years and years couldn’t have felt good. No wonder the man seemed to be watching and analyzing John’s reactions every time he made a move or said something.
“Apologies dearest den mother Josie,” Sherlock said with a sigh, as though he were a small boy being forced to say sorry for breaking a window. John watched her purse her lips as though she were about to tell Sherlock off some more before she also sighed.
A while later he arrived home to the empty 221b, hair neatly trimmed into his prefered military shortness, with Angus carrying the few groceries and things he’d purchased. John had worried how he’d carry his shopping home with cane in one hand and still injured arm not quite ready for carrying much of anything. He’d been pleasantly surprised when the cashier had pulled out a bag with handles so that the little dragon could carry it. After Angus had set the stuff down on a clean bit of counter space John thanked him and gave him a pat on the head. “You tell Mrs Hudson I said thank you, too,” John said, scratching his fingers under one of the folded frills and noticing that Angus was actually fairly cool to the touch compared to Hyperion.
That didn’t make John feel any better. “Sherlock, that’s not it. You’re acting like you expect me to.”
The mental image of a tiny Sherlock watering flowerboxes made John chuckle. “Oh, where are they? Your mother’s a rider?” John asked curiously.
John smelled food cooking as they turned and made their way into the smaller halls meant only for humans. His belly grumbled loudly at the scents of breakfast wafting by; the kids giggled behind him at the squelching noise in the quiet corridor. The smells came from a large set of double doors propped open at the end of the hall; the room beyond was marked with a sign above the entryway: ‘Cafeteria’.
The size of the marks struck fear into John’s heart, a dragon that big was rare on the battlefield and even more dangerous; he needed to get back to his unit.
“You were summoned here as well?” rumbled a voice nearby, pulling John from his thoughts to see Sherlock plopping himself down on the bench next to him. The man was in completely different, clean, attire but he looked rather ruffled, hair fluffed as though he’d been blown dry by a leaf blower with some attempt to tame the curls. John suppressed a small snort of laughter as his eyes landed on the sulky face under the fluff of hair.
“As children we used to think he was Santa,” Sherlock said quietly, sounding a little bashful at admitting that he had once been so childish to believe in Santa.
They didn’t kiss again until later, sitting together on the padded bench alcove where they’d been sleeping: Sherlock pecked John on the cheek. The pecking drifted down to his jaw then to John’s neck, and that was a very different feeling as Sherlock kissed over the gill slits there. He looked up when John shifted and made a small humming noise, not sure if he liked it.
Sherlock looked for a second like he was going to keep going and put up a fight, but then his face softened as he stared down at John, there was that crack in the aloof facade again. Sherlock seemed to be getting worse at hiding it, at least with John.
John didn’t even say anything to get Sherlock’s attention before the silver eyes flicked up to look at him. "Don’t you know it’s rude not to knock?” Sherlock grumbled at him, still hanging onto Bellamy’s claw.
The broad smile remained in place as Sherlock reached behind him, sure enough there was the spare belt, hitched to the back of his saddle hoops like just another piece of black harness leather. He unhooked it and tossed it down to John, who was thankful there were no more smug remarks to accompany it. The spark of hope fanned a little higher in the distant reaches of John’s mind where the bond had been shoved by the howling fear that tried to take over. He put on the belt with surprisingly steady fingers, looping it around and sinching it tight, and looked up at Bellamy.
“They’ve semi-retired to a small Aerie near Fitton, Mummy runs the post now and then still, otherwise they’ve become something of globetrotters in their old age,” Sherlock said with an odd mix of his average sulky attitude and a bit of badly concealed fondness. John watched Sherlock’s eyes dart to him and swore Sherlock’s face began to redden a little along his cheekbones; he coughed. “Not that that matters to the topic at hand,” Sherlock returned to his pruning.
John watched with horrified fascination as Jim slowly shifted Sebbie into something even closer to a shark than a human, but not entirely. From the chest down Sebbie was still normal human with legs, but that face, which had been quite pretty despite the teeth and gills, had transformed into something like in a horror movie, a half formed thing of disturbing proportions. Sebbie’s hands continued to clench and unclench on her thighs throughout the whole process, and her chest started heaving, tooth lined crescent of a mouth open like the sharks back at the aquarium.
Sherlock’s mind shrank away from his a little, backing off now that he sensed John’s emotions flaring again, retracting his hugging form to his side of the bed as well. “I didn’t,” he said.
“It’s not just a message of ‘Bellamy is doing well, healthy and beautiful as always’ and they stop talking. It only makes them even worse.” Sherlock hissed out the last word like a man speaking from experience who did not want to relive the nightmare that was his adoring public.
“My assets aren’t quite as fine as yours,” he said as Sherlock kept going and kissed a trail down John’s jaw to the sensitive bit of neck just below his ear.
The first time John spouted, “that’s incredible,” he saw Sherlock start and caught the confused look the detective shot him, but when Sherlock continued on without comment John just assumed he’d startled the detective out of the memory he seemed so wrapped up in telling.
“Shh,” John hissed again wishing Sherlock weren’t quite so loud about it as they left the field and walked on into the somewhat quiet halls of their division.
“It’ll heal in the morning,” Sherlock said, John feeling his baritone rumble through the skin contact. Sherlock picked up John’s other wrist where it rested in John’s lap; he stroked a thumb over the pale bite mark shaped scars there. “Remember?” he said quietly.
A light nudge brought his mind back around to Sherlock holding the cup of warm tea. John focused hard, trying to break free of the awful drug still in his system. He barely managed a shallow ripple along his skin, a far far cry from the tendril he would need to manifest to even just drink and absorb the tea. “Sherlock,” John managed to finally speak weakly, his mental voice loaded with a massive unmade sigh and tiredness to his core.
“Of course,” he replied shifting on his feet in front of her, “I can go out into the Aerie now, right?” He felt ready to leave the constricting ward.
Sherlock didn’t say anything and they continued to watch the snowfall over the Aerie. A light breezed touched the snow now and then, nothing harsh, and made the flurries swirl on their way down, like being in the snow globe on their mantel back at the flat. They watched as Snö’s harness was removed, lights and all, and the giant white dragon curled up under the warm glow of the string lights, taking on the appearance of a mountainous snowdrift at one end of the field.
“He’s impressive, isn’t he?” a lady asked, appearing next to John. He startled at the sudden question, having being frozen in place by the sudden unwanted mental image of one of the massive beasts falling with him strapped to its belly.
“I’ve been sleeping out with Hyperion lately anyway. I only just heard you playing last night. Your playing is incredible, by the way, I think it might have helped me sleep a bit better.”
“John, you were a soldier too, I don’t lie awake at night thinking you’ll come downstairs and shoot me in my bed. He is a sniper by profession and otherwise a generally quiet Aerie resident. Shaw is as harmless as Hyperion is, you just think he looks scary, black cat syndrome on a draconic scale.”
“You,” Sherlock was stuck in a loop, the only words left imploring his partner to help him reach a climax. John was having too much fun teasing him though.
The private moment was shattered by a pained groan nearby, the pair and John all looked towards the source of the noise and John had to stop himself from gasping. There was Sherlock still wrapped in netting and tied to a pole on the scaffolding. He looked like he had been beaten to some degree in the time since John had last seen him. A large bruise was blooming across one cheek, another was beginning to darken the opposite side’s eye, a smattering of smaller ones decorated the rest of him, and his wrists and ankles where he was still bound by zipties were red.
“I’ll be out, don’t wait up for me,” was all Sherlock said before darting out with a swish of coat; snapping John out of his staring. He felt his face heat a bit upon realizing he’d been basically ogling his new flatmate’s arse. John heard him dashing down the stairs; the front door hadn’t even been opened before he heard Sherlock’s booted footsteps coming back up again. He appeared in the doorway. “You were an army doctor, correct?”
"He's been an perturbing presence for ages, long before you arrived, how could I not investigate further?" Sherlock said, staring off into the sand of Bellamy's pit, where she had begun to partially bury herself. A cool blue eye glanced down at John, "it's like you don't know me at all, John," he added, lightly nudging John's shoulder.
“Also, this position in the room provides a good view of the comings and goings of others without seeming too conspicuous, excellent for observing,” Sherlock added, the detective’s spark returning as he straightened a bit and scanned the room beyond John’s shoulder.
“Hyperion and Bellamy,” called a woman at a table near the entrance. She had a binder of papers open before her and waved for John to come over, “Dr Hooper said you would be here soon, if you could please just sign in, she wants to get him back onto a regular bathing schedule,” she said with a smile.
John continued up and gathered a change of clothes and some sleepwear before heading right back out with a small, “Good night Mrs Hudson.”
“Good, now, lie down on your belly, put your hands over your head, and don’t move,” He directed, watching Sherlock position himself as he told him to, crossing his wrists above his head and getting a little cheeky, spreading his legs wide and bowing his back for John to see his thick erection hard against his belly.
Sherlock launched himself up to his feet and stumbled a step or two before turning to face John and smacking his hand down onto the rock for stability's sake. “Painted… fiberglass,” he crowed, patting the fake stone a few more times before stopping and looking down at his hand, “or maybe concrete,” he mumbled looking at the reddening palm of his hand from where he’d just slammed it down against the very solid surface with a little too much force.
“Oi!” John looked up to see the shark man turned to face him, but John didn’t waste time being frightened of the fact that he’d been spotted. He reached up and grabbed the handle behind him. With a pop the doors flew open and he realized he hadn’t thought that part through, as he tumbled backwards over the bumper of the van that was definitely gaining speed.
John and a couple of agents had made woeful attempts at trying to get at least a few of the sharks scattered about the warehouse into water, only managing to get two of the smaller ones in. The rest were simply too heavy and there was not enough time. The warehouse was beginning to smell faintly of rotting fish by the time Mycroft and his team arrived, the light of day already showing through the dirty plastic windows.
John saw the knife just before it pressed against him, a long dark metal shape in the dim light of the little maintenance closet. His mind rebelled, a litany of,
John decided to take the chance, now that his dragon was awake, to go get a drink and freshen up. Hyperion’s long neck snaked out after him and he and John shared a drink at the large fountain. Hyperion was still sucking down water as John started to strip, gingerly removing the sling in order to get his now two day-old shirt off, hissing and grunting when he was forced to rotate at the shoulder. Hyperion pressed comfort and concern across the bond, even with his nose in the water.
“You wicked fish,” John murmured with a smirk of his own, still rolling his hips to the rhythm Sherlock set.
Hyperion shifted, letting John slide off his nose as he made the motion to roll upright. He groaned as he sat up, letting out a long sigh as he managed to get all four feet under him. John felt all the little aches and pains pinging across the bond keenly.
“Of course, how else do you expect to get across London in a reasonable amount of time? Now quit being an idiot and and climb up,” Sherlock said impatiently, when John stopped right next to Bellamy’s neck.
Sherlock lived up to his warning about not talking for days on end, though. The next time he emerged from his room he silently trudged through the flat dressed in a very worn-in pair of pyjamas and a blue dressing gown, spread out on the sofa, and didn’t move for hours.
“Fine, fine, lead the way,” Sherlock groused, shaking the boy’s hand off, straightening his coat and following the nestling from the cafeteria at a brisk pace.
“You are staying here. As far as I am aware you still suffer from the same affliction Sherlock does wherein salt water becomes necessary come morning-”
John watched her for any signs that she’d run him off or worse. Hyperion sent him a sudden flash of ‘No!’ across the bond, accompanied by the mental image of a saddleless riderless dragon leaping out of a generic pit. He then changed the same picture to himself accompanied by Victor in the saddle and a strong positive ‘Yes!’
“What about her phone?” he asked, coming back to John and Dimmock as confused forensics people looked on.
Only there was a sudden drop, apparently Sherlock with his sex-addled brain had forgotten exactly how close to the water they were. Ah, but gills. Sherlock didn’t seem to give a damn that they were sinking into the aquarium tank, he just continued kissing up the side of John’s neck, clinging to him and thrusting away, not once disengaging. John clung onto Sherlock as well, the shock of abruptly being dunked into the tank dissipating slowly. He pulled Sherlock’s head away from his neck, making him open his eyes. Sherlock looked around him, his eyes reading ‘oh hell’ very clearly, but the hard cock still in John’s arse saying ‘who gives a shit, we can breathe, keep fucking.’
Sherlock’s cheeks reddened slightly as he glared at her for a moment. Melinda’s head lowered to rub affectionately against her rider as Sally continued to look smug at her minor humiliation of Sherlock Holmes.
“I-I’m sorry?” John was still fairly distracted by the half naked, bloodied man sitting on his coffee table.
With his hands raised as though pacifying a gigantic horse, John shuffled forwards, pausing when the spike-crowned head rolled so Hyperion could watch him again. That yellow eye displayed intelligence; this creature was thinking or at least appeared to be, shifting minutely as John moved ever closer to his side. Hyperion made a very low grumble when John got close to touching the long, scaled neck, his hand open showing he meant him no harm.
“Number of keystrokes and the sound certain keys on your laptop produce, you’ve just clicked after spending an inordinate amount of time typing a few words and staring at them, either you posted something or you’ve given up and gone to another website.” Sherlock continued turning the sides of the cube as he spoke, giving a short nod at John’s laptop.
It took a moment but Sherlock’s lips twitched into a small smile and he straightened up. "Of course they will, they said they wanted to play and watch me solve puzzles, one fairly easy puzzle does not a plurality make.” Sherlock said, smile becoming more of a smirk, “the fact that they had Carl’s shoe though does add a particularly interesting layer because -”
John felt that Sherlock might be up to something just before they transformed for the day. For the first time he could remember he woke up and Sherlock was not wrapped around him like a starfish on a rock. He wasn’t left to wonder where he’d gone for long though, since Sherlock appeared at his side, shaking his shoulder and telling him the watch had gone off. And so John simply shrugged off the disappearance as Sherlock being Sherlock and followed him to their tank, sharing their usual morning kisses over discarded clothes before sinking into the water for the day.
“You know what that is?” He asked hazily. His head was starting to feel foggy and full of cotton fluff again.
“You mean Mycroft is paying off anybody involved in the repairs to keep quiet.” Sherlock added. Lestrade only sighed, seeming tired of trying to argue with the rider.
So, John resigned himself to actually reluctantly following Mycroft’s order to wait in the helicopter until the deeds were done and the agents returned with Sherlock. Then he could dote all over him and take care of any wounds to his heart’s content.
Next to a row of dumpsters sat an open huge pink rolling suitcase, Bellamy sitting in the small courtyard nearby with her head near the reeking garbage cans. The horrific part wasn’t the open case, it was what lay inside. Inside sat a broken egg, and a baby dragon roughly the size of Angus lay amongst broken pieces shell and yellowish goo. The slime from the egg was everywhere. Thin threads of what looked like blood mixed with clear fluid overflowed the case and spilled across the ground. The hatchling’s long, thin, neck flopped out to lie on the concrete, small-toothed mouth and pale white eyes open. It was still alive. It’s chest was heaving away, body still curled in the remains of egg in the case.
“Looks like we’re going to have to keep you out here for the night,” Lestrade said. “We’ll wait for the sedative to wear off some, then get you back in your pit and have a visit from Dr Hooper.” Hyperion let out a grunting snort, eyes opening a bit wider as John felt a sharp pin of unease. John shot a glance at Lestrade.
“Here you go, here’s your rider,” John heard Lestrade say soothingly to Hyperion as he arrived, the great sandy neck bowing a touch more to nose at John’s outstretched hand. John felt a sharp burst of longing and affection intertwined the moment skin met scales. Hyperion had missed him just as much in the short time he’d been gone to breakfast as he had when John was gone back to the hospital in Kandahar overnight.
The living area he’d stepped into was a mess, with a riot of papers, books, and miscellaneous items littering every surface of the room. The overall impression was of a hurricane of things: objects covered a table set between the tall windows looking out on the street, multiple printers sat in the corners, a stuffed bat in a frame, glasses, a few pairs of things that looked like binoculars, what looked like a long thin fang stabbed into the mantle, a few patches of what looked like enormous shed skin littered about the floor.
“But at the crime scene…” Sherlock said in a low voice, the thumb and forefinger of one hand pinching a bit of his dressing gown on his knee and worrying it. John was watching every little movement he made now. What little tics had he missed in the last few weeks? He hadn’t really noticed the detective flinching away from anyone.
A honey colored appendage reached out to John and John met it with a scarlet one of his own. The feelings that met him were much better than before. The embarrassment was squashed down to the back of his mind and replaced by a very apologetic mood. Sherlock wanted to wrap up John and make him happy which John replied to with his own mental push.
The fat man looked up from finishing his bandaging quickly, “Oh god, I am so sorry, this is not as bad as it looks --”
Tom left him and the rest of the day went by smoothly. After lunch John found a watering can and gardening things in a squat chest near the sofa. John took it upon himself to water the potted plants, most of which fortunately had tags in their pots: a few planters of black mondo which looked like a massive clump of black dyed grass with tiny white flowers growing out of it, some succulents nearly sprawling out of their containers, a couple of extremely bushy fuschia plants in large pots, carrying dark purple and red hanging flowers, a frankly massive aloe plant, and a short but long container full to overflowing of something called London Pride that was growing like mad all over its container and sprouting up loads of little pinkish white flower stalks. Everything else without tags were basically bushy pots full of grasses in varying shades of bluish or yellowish green and red. John just watered them for now; he’d need to find whoever had been taking care of them while Victor had been away. Never really one for gardening, John figured he’d have to pick it up if he wanted to keep Hyperion’s enclosure green beyond the large rubbing post palm trees. Hyperion had shared feelings and images of rubbing up against the sides of those trees, the satisfied joy of finally reaching an itch tingled through John at the memory, trailing down his spine and making him chuckle at Hyperion.
John’s eyebrows were meeting his hairline as he looked to Sherlock for some kind of answer. Sherlock just rolled his eyes and shrugged. The pair separated from their deep kiss with a shared chuckle, Moran pressing his forehead to Jim’s with the first smile John had seen from him. They shared a murmured conversation, Jim interrupting with small pecks, and began to wander away, Moran’s arm still slung around Jim’s shoulders. Jim pecked another kiss into Moran’s bare shoulder, glancing back at Sherlock and John still standing in the middle of the landing field. Shaw followed quietly behind them.
“Can I touch you?” He asked. Sherlock’s eyebrows rose and he seemed to bodily shrink back. “No, I mean can I hold you? Just cuddling, nothing more.”
“Thank you so much for this.” It was just lunch, and he’d had a fairly hearty breakfast, but he felt so hungry.
Once divested of their damp snowy things John found himself standing there with Sherlock in their sitting room, not entirely sure how to proceed. He knew what a certain bit of his anatomy wanted, coming home after a nice evening and taking the prospective partner to bed. This wasn’t just any pickup from the pub however, it was Sherlock.
“I happen to like that little bull, adds some color to the mantle right next to the skull and stuffed bat.” John would admit he did like to see the little knick knacks mummy Holmes sent her son in their odd locations around the flat. Not only did they add little flashes of color to their cozy living space, but they also told John that someone else also liked Sherlock, as distant as she had apparently been in the past at least she was trying to show Sherlock in her own way she cared about him.
“What’s got you so wound up?” John asked once the pot was on to brew. He hadn’t really seen Sherlock this hectic in weeks, not since the pink smuggler case.
“No one was hurt, it was taken care of and deactivated. A tense evening of course, but we haven’t had any since. Threats now and then, yes, but nothing as severe as that one,” Lestrade didn’t sound as upset about it as John thought he should.
“He is my flatmate now, he asked me to help him with something. I’m not yet on duty and I’ve been led to believe I won’t for some time; was I not meant to leave?” John moved slowly into a kind of parade rest power stance, rising to the intimidation. A flicker of a smirk crossed the man’s face.
John tried to stay still as Sherlock mouthed his way up his cock, using his hand to tug the foreskin back and reveal the spongy head before kissing the sensitive fraenulum. John watched as Sherlock lightly pressed his lips to the very top of the glans, barely fitting his mouth to the shape and letting his tongue tease at the slit there before backing off again, John let out a groan.
Jim cracked the book open and that damn glow started to well up from its pages again as she flipped through it. She stopped on a page with a happy little, “ah,” and looked at Sherlock, who began to glow as well.
“To retrieve Sherlock, of course,” Mycroft said the ‘are you really so dim’ implied heavily in his voice.
Sherlock sat back on his stool, staring down at the shoe before him. “Because I knew him. He was my first case, and nobody believed me.” He spoke quietly, bringing his hands together in his familiar thinking pose in front of his thinned lips. “Carl Powers.”
They were quiet for another moment, absorbing body heat from each other, Sherlock had the distinct benefit of thick hair adding warmth to his head and John took advantage of that as well, leaning his head into Sherlock’s. The lingering scent of Sherlock’s shampoo triggered a thought in John’s mind, a flash of memory of the times sherlock had appeared from the shower, pulling with him the clean scents of soap and hair product.
“Angelo,” Sherlock held the note up for John to see the scrawled message on it. “He seems to think that I have come to him to cater for a date.”
John was finally put down some time later, and he smiled up at Hyperion, “There, feel a bit better now?” he asked petting along Hyperion’s forearm. Hyperion nodded for him with a meager ‘yes’ through the bond. Even through the painkillers John was sure Hyperion had gotten already he could feel a sharp prickling ache in his good shoulder and a dulled sensation of the slash on his thigh. Both made John worry a little about whether Hyperion had accidentally torn something and he slowly circled around, keeping contact as he went.
Sherlock’s back arched sharply with a cry into his neck at the extra stimulation. Still bouncing on John’s cock, he was caught off guard by his own sudden orgasm. “J-John!” His body locked up in the throes of passion, hand gripping John’s hard, internal muscles tightening up, John felt Sherlock’s breaths coming in harsh ragged pants from his nose against his shoulder as everything seized for a moment of extreme pleasure.
John was barely able to pay attention to her kind words, though, as the bond had come alive with new worry, John’s startle had reached Hyperion, proving that the bond had held but at the same time, stressed the dragon far away at the other end. John tried to project calm, ‘I’m alright,’ and attempted to project images like Hyperion did, trying to somehow encapsulate whatever Angus was and how he’d briefly upset John into a picture. The bond still writhed with fear and upset, only at lower levels, roiling at the back of his mind rather than demanding his full attention.
He was cut short by John’s fist contacting with his cheek, “Don’t you ever do that to me again! You cock.” John yelled at him, panting and still feeling incredibly shaky. God only knew what Hyperion was doing back at the Aerie, but his end of the bond was still a riot of panic, concern, worry, and flashes of anger at not being able to come to his rider’s aid. John didn’t even wait for Sherlock to respond before he walked away, moving to go around Bellamy and distance himself from this whole flying business.
“One moment, here, come here,” John said, thinking back to the first time Sherlock had fucked him and how good this position had felt for him. He laid down next to Sherlock, condom clad cock still standing hard and thick in the air, and grabbed Sherlock, getting him into position above him. “There, now you control the speed,” John explained as Sherlock gazed down at him, the moment it took to reposition bringing back some of the sharpness to his eyes.
“It’s a poison. She’s the fourth in a series of suicides, always the same toxin, always the same way, and they always turn up in remote areas nowhere near where they should be.” Sherlock interrupted
“It’s fine, they just wanted to meet Hyperion I think, is that right?” he spoke a little louder, noticing the lineup leaning in to listen to the adults talking. They all straightened up again, but the littlest one spoke.
“You’re 23?” John called back at Hyperion from the little alcove. He responded with an affirmative. “You’re pretty young huh?” That garnered an indignant snort from Hyperion who promptly sent John a startling mental image of a pair of rabbits mating then another flicked by of just a single rabbit. John cocked an eyebrow,
“I’ve not given you any reason to,” Sherlock said shrugging into his robe and cinching the belt tight, looking as though he were almost trying to hide in it.
“Did you have somewhere you needed to be Sherlock?” John called to him, making Sherlock actually turn to face him finally.
“Oh, they did give me some bonding time,” Sherlock said as though he were pointing out the silver lining in it all. “Course she was as big as I was easily when she hatched, and I didn’t have a name for her. I had a large hatchling following me for days asking ‘what name? What my name?’ Over and over in my head.”
“How dare your brother care about your health,” John said with a small chuckle, receiving a not so venomous glare from Sherlock.
“One of the most prolific species of rideable dragon in the European continent, the Lesser Ridgeback (pictured) has become the standard breed in most European countries for its typically favorable temperament and morphological diversity.” John read in a little note box next to the big picture. “While other local breeds are still present in Aeries across the continent, as well as other species of dragons altogether, the Lesser remains popular overall.” John looked from the page to Hyperion and back a few times, holding it up in front of Hyperion for comparison.
he thought. Pride, strength, bigness, aging, a whirl of all sorts of varying feelings and concepts spun across the bond, trying to convey what Hyperion wanted, a complex idea, but the running theme was getting bigger, getting older, and then the image of animals fucking thrown into the mix. “Mature! You are mature at 23, or maybe a little younger I guess,” John finally figured it out with an enthusiastic ‘yes’ wiping the mess from the bond.
Sherlock’s head nodded to the side. “From the men’s restroom upstairs,” he murmured, working his way down to nibble at a collarbone, then further still to John’s left nipple.
“I’m going to write more, still figuring it out,” John had grumbled, aiming a sour look at Sherlock, who was not even paying attention anymore, lost in thought again already.
They sat to the side and watched as the pair swept through the air, and John’s face broke into a smile now and then after he noticed the movements Melinda was making nearby. John watched Bellamy’s silver form knife through the sky only to turn sharply away, the tiny dark shape of Sherlock staying in the saddle perfectly despite the swift trajectory change. The smiles started when he noticed Melinda was corralling Bellamy into a set space. Sherlock probably wanted to go out farther and push the boundaries of his grounding and Melinda, smaller and quicker, was there to stop Bellamy from following Sherlock’s instructions with a wing to the face or a whip of a tail. Of course Sherlock would try to break the rules the moment he was allowed into the air.
“Will he be able to fly?” Lestrade asked gravely, adding to the eyes now staring at Hyperion’s back, the bandages on his shoulder peeking out from under a now settled wing.
John’s skin felt like it was glowing at the sheer level of arousal and excitement coloring the concession of power. He certainly had turned a brighter shade of ruddy orange, like a poppy in the sun, their colors having already mixed hours before. Sherlock’s color seemed to be running high as well, skin a lovely orangey amber color. And suddenly the vine-like contact they had wasn’t enough; John had to cover him, hold him, touch every possible inch of him, stroke him and twine their minds together.
He gasped for breath, a feeling like razorwire cinched around his throat became more and more terrifyingly apparent over all the other pains, which were beginning to rival the time he’d been shot in the war.
“You’re not the first soldier to come back from war here, you know,” Tom told him, voice steady and calm. “I am sorry for causing you stress, especially during your bonding. Just breathe through it, calm down, don’t feel guilty. I understand you’re scared of something. I won’t take offense to anything you said; we all say dumb things when we’re scared.” Tom talked him down, John focusing on his breathing and the comfort flowing from Hyperion’s side of the bond. John turned back around to face him once his breathing evened and he didn’t feel quite as panicky.
John heard Sherlock huff at that, face going back to its usual state with a bit of a grump. “People are idiots John. If I waited for them to ‘like me’ murderers and serial killers would run amok.”
“You would be surprised how much more useful it is than knowing the names of the other balls of dirt and gas that spin round the sun.”
“Christ, all that three times a week.” No wonder every rider he’d seen so far appeared to be in such good shape: all of that on top of flying and performing the acrobatic maneuvers he’d seen over the battlefields, and god knows what else constituted being a dragon rider. No wonder riders let the feeding assistants take over the job sometimes.
“It’s gone, nothing left, not even a scrap of the cover,” Sherlock pouted, throwing his arms around John to bring him back into a hug with his chin resting on John’s head.
“Greg!” John called as the two turned to leave. The Master paused, looking at him. “Thanks. For this,” he finished lamely, holding up a corner of a blanket. Lestrade just smiled.
“Like you,” Sherlock murmured, smile growing, fingers trying to pick at John’s hair and insinuate themselves against his scalp.
“Are you hiding?” He whispered it loudly. Hyperion responded with a grunt, opening his eyes and pulling his nose back with a swift rush of a negative across the bond.
John started to hum instead, keeping his arm locked with Sherlock’s in case he decided to make good on the threat of leaving him behind. Sherlock remained however, even as John quietly hummed
“Mmmhmm,” Sherlock hummed his affirmation, “There in the middle of the night Bellamy broke out of her shell. I bolted when I saw the crack I’d caused, didn’t even make it to the door before she popped her head out of the shell and took her first breath right away. You never quite forget that first sound, it’s a little sticky, a little gooey, kinda like a wet hiss; she still makes that sound if she gets sick.” Sherlock said fondly, gross as it sounded John could almost understand, he’d delivered a child or two in his life as a doctor, that first odd sort of wet burbling cry babies made when they’re first born sounded similar.
They got situated just fine, with a little shifting and shimmying to get cozy, and there they were finally in a proper bed. John let out an almost obscene groan as he settled and relaxed into the softness of the pillows, it felt like it had been ages since he’d seen a bed. Sherlock rolled towards him and, as was his usual move, started winding around John, wrapping him up in arms and legs and spooning into him with a small kiss to the nape of his neck.
“Hyperion, I really do need to go,” John told him, pushing at the scaly cheek. A flash of hurt and concern. “I’ll be back, I promise, I’ll come and visit every day for as long as I can,” John said, looking up into the huge eye next to him.
“You try staying calm after going through that, no warning, just suddenly I feel like I’m having a heart attack, your brother dumps me in a fish tank, that contains sharks by the way, and I’m a fish for… fuck what’s the time?” John paused in his ranting, suddenly realizing he hadn’t a clue what time it was.
“We were both upset Sherlock, it’s okay now.” John rolled upwards into Sherlock, stroking along what he could reach from underneath him. “Look we’re both orange again,” John said with a reassuring smile in his voice. With all the handling and carrying and cuddling Sherlock had done for him John was well and truly orange again; Sherlock was too, with only a couple of larger blotches of honey yellow still showing through the orangey stains.
“Sherlock, how did this happen?” Mycroft stood against the railing, keeping his pristine shoes far away from the mess John had just created. He looked none too happy as he leveled his stern gaze on the man still peeling off whatever was covering John’s other ear.
“Flatmate, I’m his flatmate,” John corrected, but Angelo was already out of earshot through the doors. As John waited he could hear the various clangs and tings of the average kitchen, Angelo shouting for something in the back. He didn’t have to wait long before he returned with a pair of decently-sized covered takeaway boxes. It smelled of Italian food, oil and garlic and marinara.
John was awakened on Saturday not by an unfamiliar steward knocking at the door with breakfast, but by Sally knocking and calling for him. The sun was already up and lighting the room through the canvas ceiling.
“What? No, you haven’t done anything,” John cut him off before he could apologize for no reason, “I just saw something,” his face heated with embarrassment at how quickly he’d scrambled to get away from the restroom.
“Oh, so you do remember me?” She laughed at John’s surprise. “Or did you think I’d forget that wild night over Kandahar?” Irene leaned in and purred, making John blush and quickly look at the rest of the table who were all looking at them.
“Carl,” Sherlock repeated, “anything else?” he said pleasantly, raising his eyebrows for John to go on.
“Aidan was an albino ridgeback, a shy, quiet little thing. Poor boy was diagnosed with cancer a couple years ago and died shortly after the first attempts to save him. Jim was devastated, obviously,” she explained as they walked. “He’s been in and out of therapy since it happened, just hopping from job to job around the Aerie lately--” John heard the ping of a text being received and Sally pulled out her mobile to check the message.
“I am Dr Helen Hunter I performed your surgery. I’m going to give you some water now, sip slowly for me,” she said holding up a small cup and pressing a straw to his lips. He did as he was told happily, relishing the cool liquid running down his throat. She eventually pulled away, and he sighed a nice clean breath of air.
“Need a new one,” he mumbled, “I’m sorry Sherlock, but can you pick a new one?” he asked laying a hand on Sherlock’s knee, rubbing it and causing Sherlock’s brain to jitter and cock to harden a little at the idea of that hand moving higher up his leg. Sherlock paused for a moment to think of something else simple to use.
“There, now let’s go,” he said stepping out of Sherlock’s way and letting him pass. For a brief second Sherlock looked a smidge surprised by John letting him have the bag, then the mask came back with a sniff and Sherlock walked by.
“Set it on the sink,” Sherlock finally said. The door wasn’t even locked and popped open upon testing. Steam and the smell of Sherlock’s soap filled John’s nostrils the moment he stuck his head through the door. He sat the mug on the edge of the sink for him and studiously tried not to look at the shower, not that he could see anything through their curtain but still, Sherlock was very much naked there.
He pulled the trigger and the grey haired man stumbled and crumpled to the ground. John’s fear for Sherlock’s life diminished greatly the moment he saw the killer fall, but he couldn’t see if Sherlock’s hand was empty. The shot had startled the detective, but had the pill pressed to his lips been swallowed?
“I… guess,” John replied slowly, “I’m not sure how yours is satisfied though, or did I just imagine the incident last week where you stood up in the middle of class and hijacked the whiteboard in order to solve a problem for a case rather than, you know, waiting and doing it at home, or using your phone for that matter. You like to know things now, not ten minutes from now. What’s so different about this whole Jim business that you aren’t champing at the bit to fiddle the details out of him?”
“He stopped a killer,” John said, not entirely agreeing with Lestrade. Yes, there was a bit of trouble involved, but Sherlock did track down a serial killer and smuggler.
“Investigating a case,” Sherlock said coolly, nodding towards the shoe. Sally didn’t even give the discarded article a glance.
“I am Master Gregory Lestrade.” He took John’s hand in a firm handshake. “Good to have Hyperion home, unfortunate it wasn’t by his own steam, but at least he’s in one piece.” He put an arm around John’s shoulders, leading him away from the veritable swarm of flight crew and general Aerie workers gathered around Hyperion’s crate and the cargo boxes that had been strapped around it.
John’s mind filled in as he looked over the frightening collection. There was just enough space in the other side for one person to have been crammed against the door.
The feelings of uncertainty still lingered in Sherlock’s mind, niggling at the edges of it, but simply being allowed to essentially wallow in John and restore the stains on his skin vastly helped his mood. John was tired enough to let it be, happy to be safe, happy to have the drug out of his system, happy to be back home with Sherlock. Of course they would talk about the whole issue with the argument before the kidnapping. John didn’t look forward to it; feelings would probably run high again, they’d argue, there’d be distance. But in the end they’d be okay.
“You boys aren’t supposed to be down here,” John said calmly, as he knelt down with his kit and started to undo the rider’s armor to check the extent of the damage.
John stood watching Sherlock deadheading flowers from the fuchsia bush quietly for a moment. “So, gardening, is this your secret talent or something?” John finally asked in a poor attempt to get Sherlock to either turn around or talk to him and distract him from his flatmate’s lovely rear bent over tending flowers.
Mycroft looked down at John, seeming to have heard John’s thought. “Of course,” he said, his tone sharp before returning to his composed self. “He gets into so much trouble, he worries Mummy to--”
John was nearly drooling over his own plate by the time he had it piled up with food and they had found a seat; Sally had rounded up her gaggle to sit at one round table with mismatched chairs.
The idea came to him as he looked over Sherlock’s shoulder at the computer, a flashing advert on the side of the page. John could order in dinner for them, something actually good rather than their usual crummy fast food. That night he dug out the card they’d been using to pay for their food before the shark incident and found another computer away from Sherlock.
John became aware of the fact that Sherlock was staring back at him out of the corner of his eye, same bored look on his face, but eyes very obviously considering him before they darted away to focus out on the airfield. John felt his ears start to burn and also turned his attentions back to the field, self-conscious of the fact that he’d just been eyeing up his flatmate. Not to say Sherlock wasn’t attractive, but it felt rude to notice those sorts of things about him, considering John had to live with him.
“Come on John,” A deep voice rumbled quietly in his ear. He spun around and there was Sherlock bent down with his head at John’s shoulder and now incredibly close to his face. John’s heart thundered almost painfully in his chest at the surprise nearness of him, wind fluffed hair and pale eyes locking to his quickly. “It’ll be fun.” Sherlock whispered, and in John’s terrified mind he vaguely sounded like a fey creature luring him to his doom.
She dropped the towel she’d been using onto her shoe and suddenly viciously kicked Sherlock in the stomach. “It is
“This is your flat,” Sally said, her voice taking on clipped tones as she got out and began taking John’s things out for him. John, still mildly stunned by the normal-looking street inside the Aerie, finally managed to find his voice around the sad lump in his stomach.
The third day followed the same schedule: breakfast with Hyperion, lunch after Tom gave Hyperion his pills, then John’s therapist. She finally gave him the okay to take the sling off on orders not to do anything strenuous with that arm save the weights and stress balls she gave him for in between her visits. John was reluctant to move the arm for the most part, but did as he was told.
He was nearly startled out of his skin as a long-fingered hand snatched the jar away, the small bones rattling away inside the liquid.
“I didn’t say that,” John protested, “it’s just I haven’t seen you eat anything like a decent meal in a few days. I don’t want you falling ill because you didn’t feed yourself.” Sherlock looked down at him from his reclined position, but said nothing.
“Oh, nothing strenuous. I would just like you to keep and eye on Sherlock.” The man must have seen the quick furrow of John’s brow as he frowned at the idea of being paid to spy on Sherlock. “Nothing too private, mind, I would just like to know what he gets up to day to day. I worry about him.”
“That’s about the best I’m going to get out of you, I expect. Say hello to Bellamy for me, I’d like to see the dear sometime soon,” she said with a small smile. “Anyway, carry on with what you were doing, and stop disturbing my charge.” Josie waved a dismissive hand towards Sally and the shoe before turning and going back out into the sand.
The questions ranged wildly from very serious, to childlike, to the now and then question about a case, which John would field to Sherlock who would usually grumble, “obvious,” and then rattle off a solution before going back to his books or beakers. John actually had to look up some answers for himself. He learned that this ‘Holly’ one fan had mentioned was actually an American dragon hailing from Virginia called a Bellowing Nettle, who was a spiny deep green thing and the only word John could think of to describe her physique would be ‘buff’. And John had promptly gotten lost for the evening in the world of dragon fansites and spotters. Bellamy was not the only one with a following.
“Doesn’t feel so nice when I do it to you does it?” John asked coldly. Sherlock didn’t vocalize a reply and John let off a physical sigh, a light ripple of upset points going across his skin. He was tired of this; it seemed to happen far too often, Sherlock gets in trouble, John tries to explain why and get it through Sherlock’s thick skin that what he did was not good, they make up and the cycle begins again.
, John’s mind drawled before the warm blanketing haze came back and he leaned into Sherlock. It was sloppy but warm and soft, and Sherlock seemed to be really putting everything he had into the kiss, lips barely separating from John’s only to relocate and suck at his lower lip, kissing that lip then shifting up and giving John’s upper lip the same treatment, holding John’s head in place the entire time.
“Why do you keep calling him that?” John asked, suddenly very curious to know what was it about this Sherlock that pissed her off.
“John, it's just a stealth rider,” Sherlock said calmly from between Hyperion’s curled claws, Hyperion had brought both talons together and formed a warm sort of cave around John.
“What? No, I was asking him if Victor had hit you before. He honestly can’t remember, but he remembers Victor being angry at you. I might not be a genius, but I can put things together too, Sherlock; you just said you expected me to hit you over something as stupid as waking me up with your violin!” John said, waving at the instrument in question in its case perched next to the window.
“Love?” Sherlock’s mind asked with the tone of a wide accompanying grin even as he pulled away most of the tentacles, leaving just a couple lightly tracing figures on John’s skin.
Sherlock went quiet again, as though he was thinking over what to say. A large gloved hand found its way to John’s nearest knee and just stayed there warming the skin below through the denim. They were both covered in a fine dusting of snow which continued to fall.
John shrugged him off and went after Mycroft anyway, wanting to see how this whole mess had ended. Anthea’s dragon had quietly followed the Master and now sat beside Damir who curled around a black taxi cab parked next to the college. The side door of the car sat open, Mycroft standing nearby with a phone to his ear.
John was left to ponder what sorts of books the Aerie had as Lestrade began the tour. Much of the thing was driving, with only a little walking in the halls that were too small for the car. The Aerie as it turned out was set up much like a lopsided bicycle wheel. The larger dragon sized halls spiked off from the airfield like spokes, but the field was not dead center of the Aerie and sat situated closer to the south, like the yolk of a fried egg skewed off to the side.
Sherlock went quiet again, looking away from John. “You said it yourself, it’s not that unusual for riders to have acquaintances at other Aeries especially one as well traveled as London’s, and it’s also not so uncommon to receive things from those acquaintances. Outside of Jim behaving a touch peculiarly there’s really no reason for me to be looking into his post at all. He has done nothing aside from live and work here and attend regular therapy sessions after the loss of his dragon.” He sounded as though he was really thinking as he was speaking, picking his words carefully as he went. To John it sounded as though Sherlock was trying to figure out for himself why he’d been looking at Jim at all, no one had asked him why before and so he had just done it because he could.
“You stole another rider’s dragon in order to get here; I believe you can take the same means back,” Mycroft replied, one eyebrow arched high in a face that showed disbelief. Probably couldn’t believe that a new rider in his Aerie would be reluctant to return to the skies. Or maybe just surprised John would admit it.
Sherlock made the first move, John felt him reach out tentatively and touch his upper arm, just smoothing his palm up and down slowly. John mirrored him carefully reaching out and stroking his back. They gradually came together again, Sherlock wrapping John up in his arms like he was holding a large teddy bear, and burying his nose in his hair, just breathing John in. John had his arms wrapped around Sherlock’s chest and was just stroking up and down the length of his spine, feeling the slight ridges of scar tissue mapped across it. Sherlock was still shaking very slightly, a light tremor now and then that would increase just to the point of detection before he felt Sherlock clench and cut it off again. They lay there quiet and trying to relax for a little while, the darkness outside 221b only getting darker as the night progressed, with the whitish lights of street lamps providing only a faint glow into the room beyond the lamp.
Hyperion held on to him like that for a while and John just let him. He’d put Hyperion’s mind under enough stress worrying about him all morning; letting him hold John and comfort himself with his presence was the least he could do. Concentrating on the bond, John could almost hear Hyperion telling himself that John was okay, that nothing bad was going to happen to him, he was there and looked healthy like humans were supposed to look.
They would come out of their tank at nine ‘o clock every night, the transformation coming easier and easier for John with each night. Sherlock would help John out of the tank and wait for him to get dressed because he was still always the first one out. At some point along the line Sherlock began helping John dry off, and John helped dry Sherlock’s curly hair.
The next sharp ‘ah’ was followed by an absolutely obscene smack of lips that made John’s face start to redden, a deep voiced playful laugh that reminded John a little too much of Sherlock’s rose out of the stall making the blood in his face decide south might be a better direction to run. The pair continued whatever they were doing oblivious to John’s presence, the higher voice of the two panting harder and harder, absolutely erotic little moans laced into the breathing.
he thought, no heavy saddles or anything to burden the healing dragon, but just be up on Sherlock’s level like a good rider should - or at least be so that he wasn’t looking up at Sherlock like some hanger-on following Sherlock and Bellamy around because he was handsome and stylish.
John picked up on Sherlock’s confusion and started to chuckle, which grew into laughter that made him physically ripple against Sherlock. “From the storybooks Sherlock,” he finally said. When Sherlock continued to radiate confusion he added “Clifford the Big Red Dog?”
John found a comfortable bench in the rainforest zone near the children’s play area to set Sherlock down. The wide bench shaped like a log allowed him to prop Sherlock up in the corner of the little alcove. John turned to see Mycroft with his umbrella hooked over one arm and the large bag of food in his other hand. He could almost see Mycroft physically trying to hold the fast food with just a couple of fingers to keep the grease away. John rescued Mycroft from the grease, taking the food from him and setting it down near Sherlock’s feet.
Sherlock could feel and hear John shifting around him, the sliding of the drawer for the lube, and the faint plop of it hitting the sheets near his hip. John’s weight on his back was grounding. John scooted back so that he could lie down the length of Sherlock’s back with his penis along the groove of his arse. John began licking and sucking at his scars, the random contact to sensitive spots making his skin twitch and jump below John’s mouth. A light pleasurable buzz was forming in Sherlock’s head as he sank into the submissive place below John.
“I like all of you, you git,” John cut him off before he could go into further observations. “Yes, I do find you handsome too, and yes I’ve looked, kind of hard not to when you spend a portion of your time in the buff every morning and night,” John added, softening the admission a bit more after calling him a git.
John sighed and tried a couple more times to get up before giving in and repositioning himself to try and get a little more comfortable. He looked at Sherlock’s sleeping face and smiled a little before leaning up and giving Sherlock a small peck on the cheek and settling in for the night.
John hadn’t really thought about it like that, he’d figured the one puzzle would be it, but of course now that Sherlock mentioned it, with all the work and effort put into just this one puzzle and since they really hadn’t captured the person responsible for the explosives, it could actually happen again. And they would have no idea when or how severe the next puzzle would be, as it was Sherlock had solved this one with two hours remaining on the clock.
“You said earlier that Hyperion told you I was Victor’s mate. I wasn’t,” Sherlock said to the cobweb in the corner above his head. “He was a possessive arse who had the libido of a rabbit but was being paid to ‘look after me in his spare time’ so he chose the closest option for a fuck.”
“No,” Sherlock replied defensively, “I thought it was a little warmer in here though, it’s always something--”
?” John squawked at him, “This is not ‘displeased,’ Sherlock Holmes, this is far beyond that, there isn’t even a word to describe this I think.” John tried to scrub himself down quickly now that the brothers weren’t there to see him.
In reality John was simply lying there, his body fine from the exterior, paralyzed by the drug to the point that one could mistake him for just a fish tank full of jelly if it weren’t for an occasional minute twitch. Paul picked up his phone and sat back down on his stool; Billy took his seat as well, stashing the bottle and syringe back in its box.
Before they could continue the conversation a shadow appeared over John’s plate, making him turn to see. Jim stood there, Mary at his side.
“You need the practice,” Sherlock said after a moment, as though he had to honestly think of a reason he’d want John along on such a not so adventurous venture.
“She stole me,” John argued, but his words came too late: the massive paw of Damir descended and closed around him in a grip bigger than even Hyperion’s. He let out an almost pathetic yelp as Damir pulled him off the ground and placed him behind Anthea’s saddle, plopping him astride the warm chocolate scales.
In the end samples were taken and Mike began to do as Sherlock asked, if John didn’t know better he’d say Sherlock already knew what the result would be and that he was only doing this, getting Mike involved, out of formality and maybe a slight urge to show off.
“Oh God, look at the pair of us, snogging out in the snow like idiots.” John laughed, wiping at his face with a sleeve. “Come on, we need to head home before we both catch our death out here. I’d hate to remember this night as our first date and also that time we both were stricken with hypothermia.”
“Look at the size of the case. There was room enough for two eggs with padding. The killer noticed that the case was leaking, opened it up to find one of the eggs was broken, decided to take the other one and leave the ‘bad’ one to rot.” Sherlock said, gesturing at the suitcase as he talked.
“Sherlock, you need to apologize,” John said quietly, raising his eyebrows and nodding towards Jim, who was now trying to pat the chalk dust off himself, making a couple of the kids snicker.
“For the time being, yes. They do not make tanks to accommodate large tuna fish just anywhere and I would rather not have to scrape your flailing carcass off the London streets when you turn again in the morning. So here you will stay until my brother can solve the mystery of your transformations.” Mycroft’s eyes shifted to Sherlock, who had come to stand next to John just as naked as before. When John looked back Mycroft was gone, the slow pneumatic closing of the door the only indicator that the man had been standing there at all.
“Dr John Watson, come in Dr John Watson…” He heard and scrambled for the receiver. “Y-y-y-yes, I’m here!” he nearly shouted clicking the button. The voice came back with a different person on the other end.
They both fell quiet as they finished their meals. Sherlock left a fairly large portion behind. At least he packed it back up, pulling the bag closer to him and putting the resealed box away to be eaten later.
“I’m not anybody’s lapdog, what the hell are you talking about?” John asked again, not taking kindly to being called a lapdog of any sort.
As John stared up in wonder at the dark shape spinning above them, sharp pain suddenly lanced through his shoulder. He went down to his knees clutching at the injury; his hand came away red. The pain took his breath away, and he caught a lungful of sand when he tried to inhale for a scream. He collapsed the rest of the way into the dirt, grinding his head into it as the world sped up again and he lay there hacking and screaming in agony. Hyperion let out a piercing scream and John’s ears rang so much he almost didn’t realize he was being lifted off the ground. His face was pressed against soft scales as Hyperion’s large fist closed around him. Gales of wind whipped around him, and there were a couple thundering jolts that made the pain flare in a whole new way from his shoulder. Then there was a brief moment of weightlessness, a moment akin to the diving feeling on the first drop of a roller coaster. Then another massive jolt and crash, and sand was everywhere blocking John’s already tear blurred vision. His world was a swirl of sand and blackness and sounds.
Hyperion suddenly grunted and closed his eyes, all the muscles in his face scrunching into what John could tell was a grimace. John arched an eyebrow as he slid off the muzzle looking at the now stiff dragon, mildly confused until he looked back and saw that Molly had taken the opportunity to slip the needle between Hyperion’s scales and stick him, depressing the plunger easily. Hyperion’s muzzle remained wrinkled even after she removed the dreaded needle.
“At least you are awake and aware--” Sherlock said, slipping into a pair of slim black boxer briefs.
He let his thoughts wander for a while, focusing on nothing but the loud thrumming of the rotor above him and the rare staticky voices over the protective headset he wore. John looked around to the other people in black sitting around him quiet and still. A tiny scared part of his mind supplied that they probably didn’t care one whit about Sherlock, not like John did. The only reason they were going was because Mycroft apparently had an even more ridiculous sway of power than John had thought. They weren’t going because they wanted Sherlock back, they were just doing a job. If Sherlock weren’t Mycroft’s brother, John would almost bet Sherlock was a secondary mission on the way to capturing the kingpin Jim.
“The point is you nearly caused an incident by breaking into that house the way you did!” Lestrade said, pointing up at the rather luxurious looking home they stood in front of.
“I wouldn’t say no to seeing you practicing as well,” Sherlock said, with very obvious intentions curling the corners of his mouth. He leaned in and gave John a peck on the cheek as well. John laughed.
“You’ll have to take it up with Sherlock, dear, he gets a little touchy about his things being messed with,” she said. Sally, having taken his things upstairs, came back down.
John had humorously surmised that Sherlock had gotten his own equally intense stare from watching the dragons do it, which only served to befuddle Sherlock at the time by responding, ‘this is my face’. The dragon’s judgmental gaze sent a shiver up John’s spine for very different reasons than Sherlock’s. The dragon’s triggered a small adrenaline shiver from being the prime focus of a dangerous predator that in ancient times could have easily treated him as prey. Sherlock’s made John want to climb the other rider like a tree.
“Look, Tom, I get it, I’m going to have to be his rider,” John jabbed his cane in Hyperion’s direction, “but I don’t for a moment enjoy that thought. You were born here, you’ve lived around these creatures your entire life! Me? I have avoided the sky since I was a kid. I got my orders to be flown out to Afghanistan and do you know what the first thing I did was?! I ran for the loo and vomited my lunch, because I read the words ‘assemble at the flight pad’!”
