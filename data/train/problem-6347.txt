“That’s okay, sweetheart. I know this is hard. Thank you for telling me. I’m assuming that before the serum, you got hard and jerked off when you wanted to come, which is why it’s been so difficult for you after?”
He groaned, cock twitching at the words, before dropping to his knees in front of the stool. Tony gently slid the metal around his throat and eased it shut. It was lighter than Steve had expected it to be. Than the thick leather ones he’d heard people talking about in his world.
He choked as Tony pulsed in his throat, staying in place until Steve was forced to swallow his come before replacing his cock with the dildo. Steve weakly struggled to free himself, unable to budge the metal straps. The vibrator buzzed faster, and he screamed, clenching helplessly around it. He needed to come. Badly. Maybe when his alpha came back, if Steve apologized for hurting him, he would let him come… He tried to shake his head again, trying to clear the intrusive thoughts. He didn’t think like that. Didn’t feel like that. Something was wrong.
Steve whimpered, curling into Tony in search of comfort, the plug shifting inside him and tugging at his rim with every move he made. Tony wrapped his arms around Steve, holding him close and gently rubbing his back. “But that’s not going to be a problem, is it? Because you’re never going to leave me, are you Steve?”
The rest of dinner was mostly a blur. All Steve could really remember was the darkly amused tone of Tony's voice, the heated look in his eyes, the constant touches and the sweet praise whenever he obeyed one of the orders disguised as a request. When they reached the car, Tony gently guided him into the back of the car, as solicitous as before. However this time, instead of pressing in beside him, as soon as the door closed Tony was straddling Steve's lap and pressing him into the leather seat.
“He was on suppressants for too long, wasn’t he? Not even wet. I’ll take a lube shooter to get him ready. I don’t want to have to wait for drugs. I can work on the problem later.”
Tony’s thrusts were relentless, taking what he wanted from Bucky’s unresisting body. He worked him to the edge, holding him there, forcing him to meet Tony’s intense gaze. “Who am I?”
"Tony." Steve shuddered, turned his head to press kisses against the side of his neck, opened his mouth so he could taste the salt on his skin.
"Yes, Tony." Steve's muscles clenched hard around the heavy plug, forcing his steps to be much slower as he followed Tony to the other room. He was successful for most of the way, until the other man decided he was moving too slowly, grabbing his arm and dragging him into the kitchen. Unable to keep a grip at the impatient genius's pace, the plug slipped free again, landing on the tile floor and making Steve flinch.
"On your knees. You got what you so desperately begged for. Now it's my turn." Steve slipped gracelessly from the bed and onto his knees as Tony unfastened his pants, freeing his achingly hard cock. "Show me how grateful you are, my sweet boy. And maybe I won't make you wait too long until I fuck you."
As sweet as it looked, Tony was more concerned with the effects it would create in the omega. Studies had shown that preventing an omega from gaining an erection increased fertility and pregnancy rates due to a decrease in the hormones needed to maintain hardness in an omega. Often after carrying their first child, it was no longer a concern. The amount of omega hormones in the system increased, preventing the body from responding in that way.
Steve’s cock slowly softened over the course of the meal. By the time they were done eating, he was shifting uncomfortably in the restraints, hips moving back to gain pressure from the plug. When he realized what he was doing, his eyes flew to Tony. “What did you do to me? What did you give me?”
It was the biggest rush Tony had every experienced. Having Steve Rogers, any version of Steve Rogers, completely at his mercy. And this one in particular. He was so soft and sweet. Words Tony never would have used to describe Captain America. He clung to him so perfectly. Begged, pleaded, and in the end gave Tony anything he wanted.
The drive seemed to take forever. Eventually he even forgot they were going anywhere in the first place. His world had narrowed down to him and Tony, their closeness in the backseat, and that calloused palm stroking his thigh. Steve didn't notice at first when the car stopped, until Tony was moving away. He slid out of the seat and held a hand out to help Steve from the car.
With the method he had chosen, it would take at least half an hour for the Extremis virus to be fully absorbed. And Tony didn’t want Steve thinking to question what he was really doing. Besides, Steve suffered beautifully. The combination of physical discomfort and forced pleasure leaving him gorgeously conflicted. All it took was a word from Tony to stop any protest or complaint.
Tony slowly blinked his eyes open, gaze immediately drawn to the man sleeping peacefully in his arms. Steve was curled tightly into his body, and when he was looking for it, Tony could see the signs of stress on the beautiful omega’s face. He let out a quiet breath, tightening his grip just slightly. He’d been so worried about not being enough, that he’d almost destroyed everything. That would end right now. Today. And if Steve rejected him later, after he knew everything, well it was no more than what Tony deserved.
"Good. I don't want to hurt you or push you too far. If we start to get there, you let me know. Alright?"
Remy offered a friendly smile in return. “No problem, homme. Remy know what kinda life you Avengers lead. Don’ know how happy ah’d be to come home and find a stranger wanderin’ around. We fine.”
Tony eased him back down to the bed, stroked his cheek, an odd look on his handsome face. “We’re both idiots you know. Wanting each other and trying so hard to hide it.”
Another chapter, this time with a heavy helping of soft boys being soft. Brownie points to anyone who catches the Rent reference. If you enjoyed this one, let me know in the comments!
Steve’s eyes widened in horror. Not only had he treated his alpha horribly at every turn, but he’d made the man feel as though it was his fault. He was going to send Steve away. Send him to live with Bucky and his mate. Instead of disciplining him, his alpha was going to punish himself. Stay away from Steve and spend his time alone. “Please. Please, alpha. Don’t… Don’t do this. Don’t send me away. Please. I’ll be good. I’ll be so good. I promise…”
And then there was James. He was so scared. So broken and wounded. But instead of turning all of that pain outward, he punished himself. For everything that had happened and everything he did while under the control of Hydra. What might have happened to him if Steve hadn’t intervened made Tony feel sick. The beautiful, somehow still trusting, man lying beside him would be dead somewhere. Probably ended in what he considered a suitably painful way. The thought filled him with rage. Not for James, but for Rogers.
Tony motioned him over to the ratty couch in the corner, pushing him back to sit as soon as he reached it. Steve didn’t know what to expect, but Tony dropping to his knees in front of him wasn’t it. “FRIDAY, keep track. I’m going to see how many times my pretty little omega is capable of releasing in a day.” He had the audacity to wink up at Steve. “Give us a record to break.”
Tony looked like someone had slapped him. His eyes were wide, a heartbroken expression on his face. “Oh sweetheart. No. No, you don’t. That isn’t true.” Firm hands gripped Bucky’s arms, pulling him forward. He tried to resist, but still somehow ended up curled in Tony’s lap, his arms wrapped tightly around him. “It wasn’t you, James. It took me a while to understand that. But it wasn’t you. You are not responsible for what happened to you or what you were forced to do.” Tony turned his face against his shoulder, let him cry again. “I see you, sweetheart. And I’m gonna find a way to fix this. Take care of you.”
Tony grabbed a wrench from a table, threw it through one of his workshop windows with a scream. If he didn’t need anyone, if he was fine alone, then why did it hurt so goddamn much?
"Yeah, you sleep like the dead, baby. It was so easy to work you open, work you up, without ever waking you. I wanted you to be nice and close before you even opened your eyes."
Steve stirred in his arms, eyes blinking open sleepily. He shifted to roll closer to Tony, than gasped, a hand flying to his stomach. “Problems, sweetheart?”
A combination of dread and longing formed a lump in Steve’s stomach. He’d never seen Bucky look vulnerable. Soft. Had only seen him strong and proud. Determined to fight for the cause. But he hadn’t been happy like this. Content. A part of Steve wanted to run away, as far and as fast as he could. Pretend he had never seen this. A small part of him was jealous. Wanted someone to look at him that way, hold him close and offer comfort.
Steve collapsed into the waiting arms, sobbing into his chest, the fear of nearly losing the other man too overwhelming to bear. Tony stroked over his back, murmuring soothing nonsense into his ear until he was calm. “I’m sorry. You’re the one who went through all of that, not me. I didn’t mean to-“
"You're not now, but you will be." Tony's tone had dropped to a lower register, almost a growl, that caused Steve's stomach to clench in want. "Go to the bedroom, there's a blindfold in the nightstand. I want you to be naked, on the bed, with the blindfold on by the time I get there. If not, it'll only be worse for you later. Understand?"
“I know it’s hard right now. It’s been a long day, and it’s a lot.” A handkerchief appeared from one of Tony’s suit pockets and he held it to Steve’s stuffy nose. “Blow honey.” Reluctantly Steve obeyed, receiving soft petting and praise in return. “We have a lot of work to do, but I promise, we’re done for today. All I want to do is get you fed so we can go to sleep. Okay?”
A thick metal plug pressed against his hole and was slowly forced inside. Steve whimpered, first at the stretch and then at the weight pressing at his rim, muscles clenching around it over and over. Tony grasped the base and carelessly twisted it, rocking it barely in and out before forcing it deep, grinding it inside of him.
“Supposed to be that way?” Tony finished, watching him nod miserably. “It’s okay, sweet omega. I’m going to take care of you.”
Bruce was at the stove cooking massive amounts of pancakes and bacon for the team. Tony was standing by the coffee maker, two mugs in front of him. As soon as he saw Steve he smiled and brought one of them over to him. “Morning Spangles. Feel good to be home?”
“I…” Bucky shook his head. He’d only been gone a minute, hadn’t he? Had he lost the much time again?
A hard hand gripped his hair and dragged him out from under the desk. Tony’s face was stern, but there was a hint of amusement dancing in his dark eyes. Something tight in Steve’s chest relaxed. He wasn’t wrong, Tony had been offering him a choice. “And what the hell did you think you were doing?”
Tony moaned, threading a hand through soft blonde hair and gripping tightly, hips rolling up to meet each downward stroke of Steve's mouth, soon spilling down his throat. A soft tongue lapped over sensitive skin, cleaning every trace of Tony's release, intending to soothe. Instead, Steve felt the brunette's cock hardening again as he was guided away by the grip on his hair. "Tony...?"
Steve opened his mouth to respond just as the man began to move, thrusting into him with an implacable rhythm. Each time he seemed to force his way deeper into Steve’s body, carving a place for himself. It seemed to take forever before he bottomed out, pausing for a brief moment buried to the root inside of him. Steve tried to breathe through the waves of sensation. The alpha was so deep. Too deep. There was pain mixed in with the pleasure as his body was forced open to accommodate the massive cock invading him.
Tony nodded slowly. “Okay. So that’s how you’re going to be. I can handle that. You might regret it though. Up.” Tony dragged Steve to his feet using the grip on his hair and started walking, leaving him to scramble to keep up. They went straight to the elevator and up to the penthouse bedroom. He shoved Steve down to his knees on the floor before releasing his grip. “Turn around. Face the foot of the bed. And don’t you dare move.”
But also somehow wrong. Like he wasn't supposed to be doing this. Like he was going to get in trouble. Be punished again. Images of Tony punishing him flashed through his mind, caused his hips to jerk forward into his fist. His cock throbbed. He couldn't do it.
“I’m… I’m fine.” Steve’s shoulders curled in tighter, trying to make himself smaller. The last thing he wanted was to make Stark angry. He wanted to make him happy. To live with the team in this tower. To bring the genius coffee and sandwiches when he was buried in his lab. To see him smile and know he was the cause of it. But that would never happen, Steve needed to accept that. Every version of Tony Stark hated every version of him. “I’m sorry… I should leave.”
Steve reacted on autopilot, the way he always did. Throwing the shield, taking the brunt of the damage over his teammates. After all, if anyone deserved to suffer, it was him. He had to lock away a bolt of panic every time he lost sight of the Iron Man suit in the confusion. Tony could handle himself. He always did.
“I want to be inside of you so fucking bad. And you’re not going to make me wait, are you? Gonna be a good boy for me and let me have you.” Tony pressed the head of his cock against Steve’s soaked hole, felt the passage clench and ripple around him as he pressed all the way inside in a single slow stroke. He groaned, losing himself in the sensations. Nothing had ever felt better than the wet heat pulsing around him.
"Good morning, gorgeous. How'd you sleep?" Tony was leaning against the doorway of the bathroom, completely naked and comfortable in his skin, watching Steve with dark eyes.
“Not to me. I want to take care of you. And you need to eat. And the generic mush they have at the Omega Centers does not count as food.”
“You can, and you will. Whenever I want you to. What’s the matter, Steve? Don’t know what to do with someone being nice to you?”
Tony softened, cupped the omega’s cheek in his hand. “No more electric shocks, sweetheart. Your gland is recovered. I checked the scans myself this morning.” He dropped a gentle kiss on Steve’s slightly parted lips, drawing it out when he didn’t try to pull away.
The toy in his mouth shifted, withdrew, and he pulled in an unimpeded breath gratefully. The scent of musk mixed with evergreen met his nose, making him whimper. Tony’s cock slid into his open mouth, and he moaned in gratitude, tongue swirling around every inch he could reach. It felt better having something warm and alive inside of him, instead of metal or plastic. Steve swallowed as Tony pressed into his throat, the taste of him lingering on his tongue. He could feel fingers bumping against his stretched lips from the grip Tony must have on his knot, keeping it from entering Steve’s mouth. He felt a wave of gratitude at the care his alpha was showing him… No, that wasn’t right.
“See what you do to me, my good boy? I’m going to have you again, because I just can’t help myself. Then, after I’m done, I’m going to plug you up, trap all of that come inside of you, marking you as mine.  After that, I’m going to have you put on a show for me. And then I’m going to give you a choice. It’s not going to be a nice choice, but I think you like that, sweetheart. I think you get off on it. Don’t you?”
"Sure." Steve stumbled to the bathroom, splashing water on his face to wake up fully. He finished his morning routine quickly, curious about what Tony was planning, and made his way down the hallway to the other room.
Steve sniffled, gazing up at him with teary eyes. He would be forgiven. For once, Tony would forgive him for his mistakes. He could earn it. Finally. “Thank you, Tony.”
Steve had frozen at the unfamiliar voice when JARVIS spoke, but once he realized the exam was happening he began fighting harder against the restraints. Tony enjoyed watching the omega struggle, but he also needed to reinforce the idea that he was never going to win. Using extremis, he manipulated the collar, anchoring it to the surface of the table, robbing Steve of what little leverage he had. He screamed in anger, struggling until he was breathless and exhausted.
“My pleasure, sweetheart. Trust me, holding you is not a hardship. But can you tell me what happened or do we need to talk about it later?”
Whimpers and cries poured out of Steve's mouth as he begged him to have mercy, to make it stop, to never stop. It felt like his entire body was on fire, and he desperately thrust into the air hoping for any kind of relief. He couldn't hold still. He couldn't get free. He hung there, suspended in pleasure and agony, body no longer under his control.
Tony settled by his side, releasing his own cock. He began stroking over it slowly as he watched Steve struggle and sob. The gleam of pleasure was bright in his dark eyes. Tony was enjoying both his own touch and Steve’s torment. He came with a low groan, painting Steve’s chest and stomach with his come. After he was done, he wiped himself off, tucking his spent cock back in his pants. Tony gracefully rose to his feet.
"You're welcome, baby. Get your mind off of work, and right here to pleasing me. That's what you're here for, aren't you?"
They were quiet for a long time, neither one willing to end the moment. Eventually Steve forced himself to pull away. The refusal to appear weak or needy was too deeply ingrained. Tony nodded, slowly standing and helping Steve to his feet. “I spoke to Bruce earlier, they should be here sometime after lunch.”
Cool plastic pressed deep into him, sliding back and leaving him feeling soaked as it slipped free. “What…?”
“Yes Sir.” The strokes never came harder or faster, Tony took his time leisurely working Steve up to the edge until he thought he would lose his mind. Begging and pleading for more, for relief, fell from his mouth as his desperation ramped up. Terrified that he would stop, and knowing that he would still love it if he did.
Steve stared at the ground, more conflicted and confused than he’d been before. “I’m sorry, Buck. I… I didn’t mean to upset you like that.”
Steve rushed to comply, carelessly pulling off his t-shirt and sweatpants, tearing them a little in his impatience. Tony took them from him, carrying them across the workspace and locking them in a drawer. The act of dominance made him shiver, the first trickle of moisture sliding from his hole. They both knew that if Steve wanted he could simply go upstairs and get something else to wear. That wasn’t the point. His alpha wanted him naked, had taken his clothes away and locked them up. So he would stay naked.
“Tony!” Steve squeezed his eyes close, feeling his skin heat with embarrassment. They flew open again at a hard pinch and pinpricks of pain in his nipple, just in time to watch Tony fasten the other sharp toothed clamp to his chest. He panted, trying to get on top of the pain, feeling it almost like a warmth spreading out through his body, heating his blood and stoking his arousal. Each breath jostled the clamps, drawing his attention back, refusing to allow him to settle beneath the sensation. He writhed uncontrollably, rocking his hips against Tony’s body, searching for even a hint of friction where he needed it.
"Okay sweetheart. Why don't we go upstairs. I'll get you all caged up nice and tight for the night."
It would have been impossible for him to refuse one of them. Both was out of the question. “Alright. We… We can try. But I don’t know if I’ll be able to…”
"Hey, Tony..." He hadn't meant to wake him. Steve had no idea what to do now. His earlier plans had evaporated as soon as he saw Tony asleep on the couch.
Tony reappeared with a large bench, similar to some gymnastic equipment Steve had seen. It was a few feet tall, standing around hip height, with a heavily padded top. From the center a modest sized dildo stood proudly. Steve walked closer when Tony motioned him to stand, allowed himself to be lifted over it, sinking down easily on the toy. When it was fully seated, his hips flush with the padding, Steve found that his toes could barely reach the ground.
"Be good for a little longer, sweetheart. I'll make sure it's worth the wait." Tony began kissing him again, bodies pressed together, hips grinding down against Steve's caged cock before pulling back slightly. He kept up the onslaught of kisses, thoroughly exploring every inch of his mouth. Steve's cock throbbed in its confines, making it impossible to focus on anything but that and the feel of the older man's mouth on his.
“That’s right. You just lie there and feel good. You can come as many times as you like, and if it gets to be too much, you let me know. I’m going to start with the rest now, okay?”
"No. I... I ignored your order, on purpose, because I wanted to come. But it had been nine days! And you'd been teasing me so much!"
Then he was moving again. Each thrust rocked Steve forward, the metal restraints biting into his skin. Pleasure was rising unbidden, and he tried desperately to push it away. This wasn’t his choice. Would never be his choice. Steve had always refused to be a slave to his biology. The only thing worse than being bonded for life to a complete stranger would be to enjoy the process.
Tony applied a small amount of lube before pressing the ball into Steve, his exhausted muscles unable to protest. It was the work of a few second before the rest of the cage was slid in place and locked, the key in its customary place around Tony's neck. Steve shifted experimentally and felt the unyielding pressure against his prostate. He cried out softly from the jolt of pleasure rushing through his exhausted body, turning to cling to Tony desperately as he writhed against the sheets. Every movement sent him into fresh convulsions, rocking against his sensitive gland.
Sorry for the delay. Got a little overwhelmed with real life for a few days, but hopefully a longer chapter will make up for it. We're getting to the real (lack of) plot now. Hope you guys enjoy! Comments are welcome, and suggestions for things you guys would like to see will be considered.
He went back to the penthouse in a daze, tidying up the kitchen and making the bed, without paying attention to what he was doing. He finally settled in to sketch until Tony came home, letting his mind wander and filling the pages with scenes of the two of them together that made him blush and his cock ache once he realized what he was doing.
Steve could feel Tony's hands glide lower, his fingers curled loosely around his cock, stroking a few times before moving on to cup his balls in one callused palm and massage them before sliding away. His fingers slid down and stroked gently over Steve's ass cheeks before parting them and rubbing between them. It tore a gasp out of his mouth, caused him to arch high off the bed. "Tony!"
Tony rested a hand on his shoulder, leading him to a padded bench nearby then guiding him to lay on his back. It was comfortable, plush leather cradling his body, pushing his hips forward and spreading his legs, leaving him exposed. Tony gave his cock a few careless strokes, bringing him to full hardness, before slicking his fingers and pressing two of them into his hole. Steve moaned, rocking back against it. This was obviously less for his pleasure and more preparation for what was to come, but it still felt amazing. Once the other man had stretched him, he was pulled to his feet and propelled across the room.
Steve sobbed as his tired body wound tight again, ramping up easier then ever, before plummeting over the edge, releasing around the toy again. Breathless with the length of time the pleasure coursed through his body before he was finally allowed to collapse against the bed, his alpha turning off the vibrator and allowing him to rest.
Steve stretched out next to him, curling into his side and draping an arm over his chest. "Who do you think it was that Bruce called in?"
The heavy weight of a blanket settled over his back, pinning him beneath it. He felt too weak to even try to move. "Thank you, Tony..."
Tony had been gone for over a week, and Steve was ready to climb the walls. He'd gotten used to having the other man there, both to spend time with and to take care of him. Then suddenly he was gone, and there was nothing Steve could do about it. He couldn't ask him not to leave, not when it was for Stark Industries. And he wouldn't let himself become that kind of person. Loving someone should mean never holding them back.
"You're welcome sweetheart." He slid healthy servings of bacon, eggs, and toast onto plates and carried them to the living room. "Come on in and sit down."
He rolled his hips forward, testing to see what Steve’s reaction would be when Tony rubbed against his hole. He only whimpered, pressed back harder against Tony’s cock. A whine of his name, followed by a shiver.
Steve allowed his shaky legs to collapse once he reached the couch, setting the box on the coffee table and staring at it for a moment. The tower’s mail screening process was intense. How had something like this reached him? Opening the box again, he slowly reached inside and removed the two items, setting them side by side on the coffee table.
Muscles spasmed in small twitches, his breath still ragged. Steve could feel the glands in his nipples pulsing against the grip of the clamps, his passage clenching repeatedly around the toy still strapped inside of him. “Alpha… Alpha, please.”
Steve groaned, felt his body clenching around nothing, slick and come sliding slowly out of his stretched hole. He could still feel the phantom sensation of the vibrations buzzing in his body making his muscles clench. His breath left him in a pitiful whine. "Tony..."
Tony soon appeared at his side to spirit him away from the fiasco, leaving a crowd of reporters to interrogate Sunset on hiding her true designation for so long. As soon as they were safely in the limo, Tony burst into peals of laughter, unable to hold it back any longer. “You little shit! I can’t believe you did that. How long have you been planning this, sweetheart?”
Since I was working with the tags available, I’m not sure if the relationship between Steve and Tony was as clear as I wanted. Hopefully this chapter will remedy some of that. Oh, and we’re back to kinky porn. Because I only have so much plot allotment in my stories, damn it!
“It’s alright, sweetheart. We’re done now. Such a good boy letting me be so very mean to you.” He gathered Steve into his arms once more, placing gentle kisses over his damp face and slack lips. “The things I want to do to you. Hell, the things you let me do to you. You are so fucking perfect Steve.”
Bucky fled to his room, all thoughts of food forgotten. He wasn’t sure what Stark had been trying to prove. That he was in control of everything in the tower? That this Steve belonged to him completely? Or maybe just that he knew Bucky was there. Had been watching them. Unable to stop. It was several days before Bucky emerged from the relative safety of his room. Kept his head down and tried to pretend he wasn’t living in the middle of the world’s classiest porn show. Pretend that he didn’t see the strength in Stark’s body as he played with Steve to his heart’s content. Pretend that in the deepest corners of the night Bucky wasn’t sure if it was Steve or Stark that he was thinking about.
“Morning sweetheart. How did you sleep?” Tony reached up and brushed Steve’s hair back from his face, the touch proprietary, as though he had the right to touch Steve where and when he chose.
“Worked wonders for my boy. He was a nightmare when I first got him. You wouldn’t believe how much time he spent strapped to a board.” He carefully pressed on Steve’s abdomen, feeling for the reproductive organs. “Seem to be well developed here. No signs of atrophy. Of course, the uterus and ovaries develop when an omega is young. Usually the signs of abuse are all found in the genitals and glands.”
Tony retrieved a particularly overwhelming toy from the cabinet. He was a greedy man, wanting to see both of his boys completely fall apart for him. Returning to his side, Tony motioned for James to bend himself over the back of the chair, making sure Steve was watching before he continued. Stepping deliberately behind Steve, he slid his fingers through the slick dripping down the omega’s thighs, before moving back to James and carefully opening him just enough to be able to easily take the toy. Steve moaned helplessly, hips rolling into the air at the sight.
There was silence for a moment, Steve could almost imagine Tony's eyes glowing a bright vivid blue, followed by a soft humming from both sides. A sharp electric shock to the head of his cock jerked him back against the plug behind him. As soon as it was fully seated inside of him it began vibrating hard against his prostate.
A variety of sounds came from behind Steve, soft clinks of metal, the whisper of fabric, all designed to confuse him on what was going to happen next. He heard the soft snap of latex before he felt a gloved finger rub softly over his entrance then disappear. He let out a shaky breath, trying to figure out what Tony was going to do to him next.
Steve’s cock throbbed inside the cage, but the sensation was secondary to the way Tony’s fingers stroked through his slick, rubbed against his gland causing sparks of pleasure that built him higher, pushed him even closer to the edge. He wanted to rock back against him, thrust down and force his alpha to move faster or harder, but the silk binding his legs robbed him of leverage. All he could do was take what he was given.
He squeezed his eyes closed, could almost hear the sound of the trap swinging shut behind him. “What’s the price, Tony?”
It was unusual for Steve to sleep in, more so for him to still be asleep after Tony was awake, but the stress of the day before was apparently enough. Steve didn’t wake up until Tony gently shook his shoulder, guiding him as he staggered clumsily out to the table where breakfast was waiting. Tony chuckled when he ignored the food and immediately began gulping down his coffee.
Steve obediently shuffled around as he was told, unable to see most of the room. Tony was back almost immediately, pushing his legs apart, fastening a spreader bar between his thighs and cranking it so wide that Steve could feel the painful stretch in his muscles. A thick padded collar was fastened around his neck and his wrists attached to it, leaving him exposed and off balance. Tony pushed him forward against the footboard, attaching the front of the collar to a small hook. He struggled not to fall forward, but Tony solved that by attaching a line from the back of the collar to the spreader bar, immobilizing him further.
"Good boy. Stop now. Pull out the toy, you'll like this. Slick it up for me, and show me how much you need it. Keep the remote nearby, but don't turn it on until I tell you to."
Tony took a long slow breath before letting it out in a rush. "I... I made this for you. A couple of weeks before the whole extremis thing. It's something I really, really wanted you to have."
Tony slowly drew out of his body. "Clench up. You lose any, I'll have to punish you again. And I don't think you could handle that right now. Do you?"
Steve willingly spread his thighs for the alpha, shocked when instead of teasing or torturing him, Tony unfastened the cage, sliding it off and setting it aside. A cry tore from Steve’s throat as Tony eagerly sucked his soft cocklet into his mouth. The warm, wet heat almost immediately pushed him into release. It had been nearly two years since Steve had felt anything but smooth metal around his cocklet. The suddenness of the contact was overwhelming, and Tony was insatiable. He kept sucking at him as Steve writhed and groaned beneath him, rocking back desperately against the dildo, needing to feel something deep and hard inside of him.
A hard tremor ripped through Steve’s body. He lifted his hands above his head, crossed at the wrists near the headboard, leaving his chest open and exposed. “Yes. Please. That’s exactly what I want.”
A gentle hand brushed the hair back from his forehead. Tony’s voice was rough. “It’s okay, sweetheart. I’ll take care of you. Let me get you cleared with medical, and then I’m taking you home. We’ll finish this there. Understood?”
Slick sounds caught his attention, and he glanced over his shoulder to see Tony thrusting into his own fist and coming, felt the wet heat splatter across his back. Steve groaned, burying his face in the blankets, hips still rocking futilely. Tony began soothing over his back, kneading the muscles. Rubbing his come into Steve's skin.
Tony gently pressed him back onto the bed, and Steve relaxed enough to let him, closing his eyes to focus on the rough whisper of his lover’s voice instead of the voice in his head insisting that he couldn't have this anymore.
"Yeah, sweetheart. Damn, that's a nice way to wake up. Trying to be an especially good boy for me today, I see?"
Tony pressed their bodies together, claiming his mouth. The thick hair on the alpha’s chest rubbed against Steve’s sensitive skin, his moans devoured by the other man. His arms wrapped around Steve, forcing them even closer as his hands slid lower, fingers stroking into his throbbing passage. Steve’s moan turned into a whine as the gnawing emptiness was finally satisfied. He clenched tight, trying to urge him deeper, and Tony obliged pressing into the core of him.
“Oh! Right! So I had reservations tonight for my favorite Italian restaurant, but I really don’t want to go by myself, and I thought it’d be a lot more fun if you went with me. I always have a good time with you. So will you?”
Steve waited nervously, listening to the line ring. It was answered a minute later by Dr. Banner. “Hello?”
“Alright, baby.” Tony’s voice was soft. Gentle. “Then that’s what we’ll do. You give yourself to me, be mine. And I’ll take care of you for the rest of our lives.” Tony pressed his lips against Steve’s, lingered for a moment as he sighed into the kiss. “Then why don’t we go down to the lab, and I’ll finish making you mine.”
“Then you’d better put on a good show for me.” Steve couldn’t look away from glowing blue eyes. The dildo picked up speed, thrusting faster, dragging over his prostate more often. He whimpered, tugging at Tony’s grip on his chest, rolling his hips as though trying to grind on the pistoning cock inside of him. “That’s right, baby. Just like that. Does it feel good? I’ll tell you what. If you can come from this, I’ll let you. Won’t ruin it or anything. But if you can’t, you’re not coming for a week. Got it?”
Bucky nodded, his entire focus directed at the food on his place, unable to look up at either of them. He was allowed a respite, until the last bite was cleared from every plate. Tony clapped his hands together before standing. “Steve, why don’t you take James into our room and get comfortable. I’m going to go grab a few things.”
Tony lifted the still spasming omega into his arms, carried him into the bedroom, depositing him gently on the bed. He quickly stripped out of his clothes, sliding in beside Steve and holding him close, shushing the anxious sounds that had begun when he’d moved away. Eventually the stimulation was too much, even for a super soldier. Steve’s eyes had rolled back after another release had torn through his system, then fluttered shut, hitching breaths slowing and becoming regular.
Steve sobbed, clenched around the dildo again, body shaking from another painful orgasm. "Please... Please lock up my cock, Sir. I can't... I can't take anymore..."
“Oh honey, no. Not at all. It’s fairly common for omegas in heat to be unable to tolerate solid food. It’s why I had so many shakes and drinks ready for you. I just worry, because of your mutation. I’m not angry, I swear.” Tony scooped him into his arms, settling the exhausted omega in his lap.
Tony forced him over the edge and ruined his release over and over until he was wrung out and empty, jittery with the sensations, and sobbing, clinging to him desperately.”Tony… Tony, please…”
That being said, there is the possibility that if they keep going the route they’re on that this story will turn into Steve/Tony/Bucky. I do love me some Bucky Barnes, and he’s just so sad and broken at this point. Stupid Civil War.
"I know you do. Fuck. Do you know what you do to me?" Tony rocked his hips forward against Steve's thigh, letting him feel just how hard he was. "That's what you do to me."
A deep breath. Was he really desperate enough that he was willing to do this with a complete stranger? Closing his eyes, Steve pictured Tony, the way he had been looking at him this morning. The caring and affection. How quickly he could lose all of that if the other man figured out how he felt. Yes, he was absolutely going to do this.
This was how the older men who hadn't been hurting for anything had treated pretty girls they took out on the town. Buying them flowers and gifts, taking them to fancy restaurants and ordering their meals for them. Sweet talking them back to their beds afterward. How Bucky had charmed girls by the dozen back to their apartment for a night.
Steve was finally roused from a gentle doze by the sensation of lips trailing softly down his spine. He gave a languid stretch before turning over to face Tony. A low grade arousal was still simmering beneath his skin, but mostly he felt light. Easy in his own body for once.
Tony offered him a soft smile, the type that made Steve’s stomach clench and his heart pound so loud he was certain the other man could hear it. “You’re so good to me, Steve. Thank you.”
He needed to come so badly, really come, not the unsatisfying untouched one that left him feeling so twisted up inside. And now he couldn't. Not until Tony let him. Until Tony unlocked the cage again. He whimpered, hips rolling into the air, chasing any hint of sensation, any lingering bits of pleasure.
“Enough, Steve. We’re done talking. I’m going to claim you, then take you home and take care of you, like you need me to. This is getting us nowhere.”
The relief was short lived as the machine he was bound to came to life, vibrating beneath him. Steve tried to fight, struggling against the mixture of pain and pleasure wrecking his body. The spot behind his balls was tight and ached fiercely as the vibrations pounded through him, however this was also the most stimulation his cock had gotten since Tony caged him a week ago. His head fell back with a groan as the cage tightened around him as arousal swelled him in his confines.
“You can. You know this is for your own good. And maybe if you’re a good boy, I’ll eat out that hungry hole of yours when we’re done.”
"There's a fundraiser at the Met this weekend for the Maria Stark Foundation. It'll be showcasing the work of a lot of modern artists, some from my- well, Pepper's, private collection."
He looked up, meeting his eyes. "I want you in my mouth. And... I don't want to come tonight. I want this to be about you."
"Months. I started making pretty little toys for you months ago." He sat down on the bed beside Steve, reached down and gripped the cage in a hard fist. "And now you're here. You're mine. And I am going to make damned sure that no one else will ever be able to touch you again."
"Good boy. Such a good boy, Steve." He tilted Steve's chin up so he could look at him. "Here's what we're going to do. Since you've been so good for me, I'm going to let you take care of me, then we're going to go to the bedroom and get your punishment out of the way. Alright?"
"Damn it." He stood there panting and uncertain, letting the hot water wash over him. Frustrated he switched off the shower and stumbled out, barely drying off before pulling on clothes and heading down to the workshop.
"Good." He pressed closer, thigh grinding harder against him. His fingers caught Steve's chin, tilting it so he could look into his eyes. Tony kissed him hard again, seemingly please by whatever he had seen in Steve's face, rocking his body into him. Grinding his thigh harder against his cock, until Steve was close to the edge and trembling, desperate for more.
Then nothing. The vibrator was still. He sobbed, tears running down his cheeks. His body ached, cock throbbing painfully. "No! Tony, please! No!"
“And you lose even that. And how does that make you feel? Knowing that I control the very basest part of you?”
With a sigh, he set down his phone and climbed out of bed. He needed to get something to eat. Supersoldier metabolism couldn't really wait. He walked into the living room and stopped, blinking. There were flowers covering every available surface in the room. All different colors and types, filling the room with a delicate scent. Steve reached out and gently caressed the petals of a lilac setting on the end table. Tony must have done this. No one else would have filled Steve's apartment with flowers.
Steve keened, letting his head tilt to the side, offering his throat in a sign of submission. He’d do anything to please this man. The version before him, perhaps more-so. And wasn’t that a terrifying thought to have about someone he’d technically only known a few hours?
I’m tagging this as mildly dubious consent, because of the medical necessity of Steve being assigned a guardian, and the forcefulness of Tony enacting his will on Steve. However, if it’s not clear enough in context, Steve really wants Tony and is consenting after a fashion.
"Hey, tell me what's wrong." Firm fingers tilted his chin up, forcing him to meet steady brown eyes.
Steve relaxed back against the bed as his body spasmed, more come trickling from his cock, and the gland buried inside of him seemed to go numb. Tony turned off the vibrator with the small remote he had kept close to him the entire time. “I think it’s time for a break, sweetheart. I’m going to go grab something and then be right back. Okay?”
Hello everyone! Slight modifications of the last chapter. I decided I didn’t like attempting to switch to Tony’s point of view, it was throwing off the rhythm of the story. So if anyone wants to glance at the first chapter again, go ahead. And then onto another chapter! Full of kink. And porn. Because apparently I don’t know how to write anything else...
When Steve finally woke, he felt groggy and disoriented. It took him a moment to remember where he was and why. He was roused from his thoughts by strong vibrations suddenly coming to life inside of him. Steve writhed on the bed, hand dropping between his legs to see if Tony had slid a toy inside of him while he slept, but there was nothing there. Another surge in strength had Steve thrusting up against the blankets in search of friction on his trapped and neglected cock. The new torment seemed to be entirely focused on his prostate. And suddenly he knew. The implant Tony had put in place earlier. That was what was torturing him now, and there was no escape.
Tony dragged him into his lap by his hair, claiming his mouth fiercely. His hands slid down to Steve's ass, cupping the globes and squeezing as he drew back to breathe. "You are amazing. I really am so fucking lucky."
He could feel his thoughts spiraling downwards, but didn’t know what to do. Tony only wanted him because SHEILD needed him to fight. But if he couldn’t even do that right, would the alpha not want him anymore? Would he throw him away and find a better mate? Would Steve have to watch?
Steve rolled over, spreading his legs to allow Tony to settle between them. He was rewarded with strong fingers pressing into the base of the plug, driving it forward to nudge his prostate. Slowly letting the sensations build until Steve was moaning and writhing beneath him before stopping. His fingers slid up, running over the smooth metal of the cage, curving around it and stroking over the surface. The image of Tony stroking the cage he built just for him, had Steve begging again. “God, Tony! Tony, please!”
He lifted the omega into his arms, carried him into the bathroom where a steaming bath waited. They bathed together in silence, neither enjoying the experience, each too lost in their own heads. Dinner was a quiet affair. For once, Tony was at a loss for words. Instead, he thought over what his next move should be. He knew he couldn’t tell Steve about Sunset and Ty. Maybe someday, far in the future, but not now. He’d only take it as a sign of Tony’s weakness. And wasn’t that exactly what it was?
"You are. So fucking good. You hold back until I do, and then you can come. If you don't I swear I'll plug you up with the ginger again."
Bucky gripped his arm firmly, giving him a little shake. “You ain’t listening to me, punk. We were wrong. What our parents told us was wrong. Bruce spent that entire week tryin’ to undo some of the damage caused by the drugs they put us on. And it really fucking hurt. But he never made it worse than it had to be.”
Do you know what bored at work and frustration at home mean? Another chapter of porn! Now complete with blink and you’ll miss it plot. Yes, there actually is plot, did you know that? Extra brownie points to anyone who sees what’s coming.
He couldn’t catch his breath, it felt like falling. But Tony’s arms were wrapped tight around his waist, holding him close and keeping him safe. This was where he had always been meant to be. At home, safe and secure with his adoring alpha. It was all he had ever wanted.
“I want this to be over. To be able to show you how good it can be for us. Can you be a good boy? Take a little bit more for me?”
“Okay, enough. Natasha, make sure everyone gets taken care of. Steve? We’re going upstairs right now. And don’t you even think about arguing with me.”
By the time he was finished and submitted the reports to SHEILD, it was almost lunchtime. "Jarvis? Does Tony have a break in his schedule long enough for lunch together?"
He didn't remember moving to the bedroom, but the cool silk sheets were soothing against his burning skin. The touch of a cool cloth had him jerking off the bed, sobbing from sensitivity. He tried to roll away, protect his tender cock and balls, but a firm grip on his arm kept him from moving. "Please... Tony..."
I know I’ve probably said it before, but I’m pretty sure this is gonna be the filthiest thing I’ve ever written. Honestly, even I’m surprised by where this is going. Let’s be surprised together. I am learning more about the dark porny places in my head every day. But for those concerned, most of my stories will have a happy ending, this one included. Now it’s going to be a happy ending within the constraints of the world I’ve created, but happy ending nevertheless. Let me know what you think in the comments. Hopefully I haven’t gone to far. And to all of you die-hards who have commented multiple times: thank you from the bottom of my smutty kinky little heart!
Steve dropped to his knees on the pillow immediately. He wasn’t sure what Tony had in mind, but the other man was known for his creativity. Steve wasn’t in any hurry to find out exactly what he could do to his omega.
“I… I don’t want that. Tony, I don’t want that. Wanna come. Please? I never get hard, I can’t. And now…” He trailed off with a sob. It wasn’t fair.
He took a long hot shower to make himself presentable and wash away the smell of sex, before dressing in casual clothing and going down to the common floor of the tower. Clint and Thor were crushed together on the couch with Natasha perched on the back adding snarky comments to Clint’s explanations of how Mario Kart and video games in general worked. Steve laughed before turning away to head towards the kitchen where the scents of strawberries, bacon, and coffee were calling him.
When Tony finally spoke, his voice was low and gravelly. “Good morning, sweetheart. Did you sleep well?”
“I can’t. Once it’s activated, it runs it’s course. I’m sorry, pet.” Steve began to cry loudly, unable to still his movements. “But don’t worry. I’ll be nice to you. You can stay just like that while you take your spanking. You don’t have to try to hold yourself up.” His voice turned stern. “Say thank you, Steve.”
As each gland gave, Tony noticed the sensations shifting for Steve. He was no longer crying out in pain from every motion of his fingers. Instead he was subtly rocking back against them, trying to urge him deeper. When he finished the last one and began rubbing the medication into his rim, encouraging blood flow and elasticity, he was rewarded with gasping moans of pleasure. Tony released the strap across Steve’s hips, wanting to watch him move, chase the pleasure.
Steve shifted minutely on his chair, trying to find a more comfortable position, or at least one that didn’t actively press the plug into his prostate, as he listened to Tony tell a story about one of the experiments currently being run by his R&D department, and how the last one had set a SHEILD agent’s hair on fire. The other man talked and gestured animatedly, bringing a soft smile to Steve’s lips. He was enjoying having dinner with Tony. The restaurant was quiet, the food was good, and the company beyond compare. He’d missed spending time with him. Had been so busy running everywhere for SHEILD that they hadn’t spent much time together lately.
Steve fell back against the bed, sobs tearing from his chest.The constant denial was it’s own kind of agony. It felt like every muscle in his body was twitching restlessly. He needed something, anything, to make it stop. It seemed like Tony was gone for even longer this time, finally stepping back into the bedroom with a full cup of coffee and a Starkpad. After setting the cup down, he moved around the room, sorting through several items before returning to the bed.
"No. I told you, we have plans for tonight." A metal plug was pressed into him, thick and just long enough to rub against that sensitive spot. A leather harness was then buckled around his hips and thighs, holding it tightly in place. "There you go. Now, turn around and sit on the bed for me."
Tony grabbed a pack of wipes out of the nightstand, gently cleaned the come off of his thighs and his cock. Steve cried out, oversensitive from his aborted orgasm. "Tony...?"
"Good boy." His fingers danced over Steve's skin, circling and rubbing, barely pressing in before sliding back, teasing the nerves, building him up until arousal was burning under his skin. "Onto the bed, hands and knees."
Steve had known that the other man had feelings for him, it was obvious in everything he did. But hearing it put into words was different. Made him feel different. He cared for the brunette, of course, but wasn't sure if it was love yet. It could be. Would be given enough time. This wasn't the type of thing Captain America needed to rush into. If he handled the situation wrong, he could hurt Tony. That was the last thing he wanted.
Steve rolled over, burying his face in the blankets, hips churning frantically. “I-I can’t… I can’t… Please. Please, Tony. Make it stop. Please make it stop.”
Another pause. His breathing sped up, wondering what Tony would do next, but he still kept his eyes closed, relaxed and trusting. Something cool and metallic scratched over his nipple, dull pain, a sharp point. It left burning trails over his chest and stomach that continued to throb even after it moved away. Steve shuddered, pressing up into the touch, felt it press harder, drawing lines over his arms then down over his thighs. "Oh God..."
He had expected the other man to make excuses and flee. Instead his eyes gleamed and went dark with pleasure. “Really, now? Well, I suppose that does change things a little. It seems I’ve gotten my hands on a very submissive omega. Don’t worry, sweetheart, I know exactly how to handle you. Let’s get you taken care of so I can take you home, now.”
"I... Worried, I guess. I wasn't too hard on you last night, was I? I mean, I know you're new to all of this, and I just... I don't want to hurt you, or... Or chase you away..."
“I know you’ve been watching us. I’m aware that we aren’t exactly subtle.” The corner of Tony’s mouth turned up in a wry grin. “But I’m also aware that you like it.” It was hard to deny the obvious, so Bucky nodded. If he was bringing it up, then it was highly unlikely that Tony was going to get angry about it. “I discussed it with Steve, and we would like for you to join our relationship. He has always loved you. And I find myself with strongly protective feelings the longer you’re here. You don’t have to play like we do, everything is entirely up to you, but I think it might be good for you. That I might be able to help you feel better.”
Tears streamed from beneath the blindfold. His body was still clenched tight around the piece of ginger, unable to relax as he was pushed through the sensitivity, building towards another orgasm. It felt like it was burning through him, almost cleansing in its intensity, blanking everything else from his mind.
Steve tried to look away, but couldn’t tear his eyes from his expanding stomach. By the time the medication finished filling him and Tony removed the tubing, he looked nearly six months pregnant. He was startled from his thoughts by the removal of the speculum and the release of his collar from the floor. He sat up slowly, feeling the heavy shift of liquid inside him. The was sensation strange in such an unfamiliar place. The cervical plug was still lodged inside of him, the pressure inside his womb increased the cramping and aching it caused. He turned pleading eyes up to his alpha, not understanding why it was still in place.
He seemed so happy. So glad to see Steve, that he flushed in embarrassment. He didn’t know how to respond. Drinking his coffee in silence seemed the safest answer.
He’d thought he had found a place for himself. Here in the future, away from the whispers that had followed him throughout the war. He was a science experiment. Erskine should never have given the serum to an omega. It should have fixed him, made him an alpha. Why didn’t it work? It had been a relief to put the plane down in the ice. To finally be done. But then Steve had woken up in the future, with a chance to start over again. Or so he’d thought.
"Tony..." The words made his skin burn and all he could do was lose himself in kissing the other man, desperately over and over again. He was right. Captain America might run straight into a fight, but Steve Rogers wanted to be used. Locked up tight and owned.
“You need to get used to coming naturally, sweetheart. And we need to shrink down that little cocklet anyway. A cage will be good for you. And it’s happening whether you like it or not. You get to decide if we’re doing it the easy way or the hard way.”
Tony’s expression became stern. “Do you want to go back to feeling how you did before? Frustrated all the time? Unable to release, unable to come even if you do get hard? Hmm…?”
Once his latest release had passed, Tony began to work again, humming softly under his breath. His fingers slid back inside Steve’s body, carrying a long tube with them. He felt the cervical plug shifting, body cramping once more in response, before the movement stilled and Tony’s hands slid away. The speculum was unlocked, most of it’s stretch released before it was locked once more. Tony waited as Steve trembled, another release building and crashing over him. It was humiliating. Not only being treated like an inanimate object, but his body being turned against him. He waited for the experience to get worse, and wasn’t disappointed.
He lost track of how many ruined orgasms he was forced to endure. How much time had passed. Steve was wrung out and helpless, throbbing with need and too sensitive to endure even the slightest touch. He was given a reprieve. A pause in the constant cycle of torture, allowing him to catch his breath. When he opened his eyes, Tony was standing over the bed, eyes glowing that unnatural blue as he slowly and deliberately stripped.
Tony’s cock stroking in and out of his abused hole was what finally roused Steve from the deep sleep he’d fallen into. Memories of the night before came rushing back. Tony had claimed him. Wanted to keep him. There was still a dull throbbing in both sides of his neck, but it only heightened the pleasure as Tony slowly rolled into him. Even as he thought it, lips ran across the torn flesh, stubble rubbing against the skin, making Steve clench tighter around the cock buried inside of him.
Steve wasn’t sure which was worse, the desperate need or the unending pleasure. He could almost feel it draining away his will. What would he do, what would he give up, to experience pleasure like this again? But as overwhelming as it was, it still wasn’t enough. He needed his alpha’s thick cock, splitting him open, not a piece of machinery. The heavy knot locking them together as he was filled with spurt after spurt of come. He sobbed hysterically, his entire being overcome with the all consuming need for human touch. Connection. He wailed around the gag, trying to call his alpha back to him.
“Because you’ve been run so ragged lately, sweetheart. I didn’t want to make it worse. And besides, it didn’t end up coming to that. I stabilized Extremis, and it works. I heal pretty much as fast as you. No more cancer. No more injuries. I’m alright. I promise, Steve. I’m alright.”
Needy whimpers slipped from his throat as Tony’s hands smoothed over his skin, trying to soothe. “Such a good boy for me.” Gentle kisses were placed against his skin as he was freed from the restraints and gathered into strong arms. He burrowed into Tony’s chest, clinging tightly to his skin, a confused mess of pain, agony, and want.
"Her life was filled with tragedy and pain. Illness. Betrayal. Somehow, she managed to transcend it all, and paint the raw beauty she found in her suffering. It didn't seem right that it stayed lost. Was never seen."
Tony could already imagine coming home to the stunning omega waiting on his knees, pliant and obedient. It would take time to get them there, but Tony Stark was nothing if not confident.
"Good boy." Steve's thighs were spread wide before familiar shackles closed around his ankles and above his knees. His arms were folded behind his back, each wrist fastened to the opposite elbow, before he was bent forward over the edge of the bed. A collar was buckled around his neck, and when he tried to sit up he discovered that he was held firmly in place.
The older man chuckled, amused as always by tormenting him. “Not today, sweetheart. We have places to be, remember? Be a good boy and maybe you’ll get to come later. Up now.”
James seemed to consider the request for a moment, but the hint of a smirk at the corner of his lips gave Tony the answer before he spoke. “No, doll. You just settle down and rest. I think you’ve had enough excitement for the day.” After he finished, he wrapped the metal arm around Steve’s waist, holding him too tightly for him to move.
They fell back against the bed, Tony’s arms wrapped around Steve, holding him close. Like an anchor keeping him from drifting away. The floaty sensation was back. Omega-space Tony had called it. He murmured his alpha’s name, nuzzling into the curve of his neck. For the first time in his life Steve felt completely safe and loved.
Neither of them moved, content to linger, trading soft kisses. Tony eventually slipped out of him, moving to the side and pulling him into his arms. Gentle fingers stroked through his hair, and Steve sighed, relaxing into the touch.
Steve moaned, arching his back further, offering himself up to Tony. He’d do anything for Tony, suffer through any torment to prove himself to him. “Is that what you want, sweetheart?”
“It’s a start.” Tony’s hand came down on his cheek with a loud crack, the pain making him cry out. Without giving him a chance to recover, the blows continued falling. There didn’t seem to be any pattern to where the hits would fall, and before long it didn’t matter. The entire expanse of Steve’s ass and thighs felt hot and swollen. Each strike seemed to ache more, the pain lingering, and still Tony didn’t stop. He fought it for as long as he could, but eventually it simply hurt too much, reducing Steve to tears. Tony continued to spank him until the soft cries became heavy sobs. When he finally stopped, the area continued to throb and burn. Steve sniffled, trying to clear his nose so he could breathe. A tissue was held in place, and without a word, Steve obeyed the silent command. Tony gave him a few moments to compose himself before flipping Steve around so he was sitting on his lap. All his weight rested on his sore ass, the fabric of Tony’s jeans chaffing horribly against the tender skin. He tried to struggle free, but that only made his situation worse.
“Fine.” Steve could feel himself pouting and chose to ignore it. Tony was right. Better to get it over with rather than drawing it out. And there was still a small part of him that was unsettled, knowing his alpha was displeased with him and wanting nothing more than to make it better.
“Oh sweetheart. I was just letting you dig your own grave. Just because I don’t say anything, doesn’t mean I don’t see everything.” He stalked closer to the couch, eyes dragging over Steve’s straining body. “I thought I’d give you a few days, see how you responded. Now I know.” Tony’s fingertips skimmed over Steve’s chest, pausing to tweak a nipple before moving on. “Apparently you need a firm hand.”
“Yes alpha.” Steve rested his forehead against Tony’s shoulder, quiet for a long while, before he finally spoke. “If… If it wasn’t me, if I didn’t do something wrong, then why…?”
He was saved from further consideration by the sound of the elevator. Tony walked out, the picture of calm. His tie was loose around his neck, drawing Steve's attention and bringing a flush to his cheeks as he remembered the sensation of silk wrapped around his wrists that afternoon.
Wrung out and boneless on the living room floor, Steve was beginning to contemplate spending the night exactly where he was and dealing with clothes glued to him from dried come in the morning when his cell phone chimed again. Unable to ignore it, he managed to roll onto his stomach and drag himself over to it.
"Oh honey. You already told me you didn't want to come tonight. That it was supposed to be all about me. And this is exactly what I want. You desperate and begging underneath me. Getting to tell you no. Listening to you beg and cry because you need me that much. Getting you so close you can almost taste it, and then stopping. That's what I want."
Tony stroked his fingers across one petal soft cheek. “That’s the beauty of it, sweetheart. You’re all set up. I decided what you were doing and when. All you have to do is go, and do what you’re told. Can you do that for me, Steve?”
“Do you want me to take care of you? Make it go away?” Bucky nodded against Steve’s neck, comforting himself with the soft scent of vanilla and honey that seemed to cling to his skin. “Alright sweetheart. I know what to do. You just hold onto Steve right now. I’m going to give you what you need. But I want you to know that this isn’t a punishment. I’m not trying to hurt you, alright?”
“I love Bucky. I do. He’s my best friend, and I’m so glad to have him back it hurts. But I need you. I miss you. And if you don’t want me-“
Steve also made sure he was back at the hotel before the daily meetings ended, wanting to be there waiting for his lover when he finished another stressful day. Sometimes they went out, visiting some of Tony's favorite restaurants, but often they had a quiet dinner together before going out to see the city. The time spent with Steve each night helped Tony unwind from the frustration caused by the other attendees, especially when he had to interact with Justin Hammer.
“Good boy. Come with me.” Tony led him to a soft mat in the corner, urging him to his knees straddling something that resembled a small barrel. He gently spread Steve’s legs farther, fastening restraints around his ankles and just below his knees. His arms were folded behind his back and restrained before being secured to a post just behind him.
“Good.” Bucky trembled at the hint of praise in the rich voice. “Tell me, do you prefer Bucky or James?”
Bruce released the speculum, removing it and setting it aside. “I always do. Would you like to proceed? I can set up in the other room while you prep him.”
Eager as always, Steve slid from the chair to his knees. Tony sat in the chair and cupped his chin, turning his face up. “Such a good boy for me. Close your eyes.”
Tony took his hand, threading their fingers together and tugging him to his feet. Steve stumbled on shaky legs as he followed him across the workshop and to a closed door in the back that opened as they approached. Before he had a chance to do more than glance around, he was pressed backwards onto a padded surface. Tony lifted his arms above his head, fitting them into lined cuffs that were quickly fastened shut. The portion of the bench he was lying on was curved, keeping his back arched, chest on display. His legs were lifted into protrusions from the bench’s body and held in place with another set of cuffs. His thighs were spread wide, cock and hole on display for his new alpha. A leather strap was buckled over his hips, keeping him still.
“If I’m going to react that badly, maybe we should just skip it?” He tried to keep from panting as Tony began to toy with his sensitive nipples, pinching them to hardness.
Steve ground down harder against the machine Tony had been watching him ride for the last half hour. The vibrations against the plug he was filled with and the cage he was wearing were driving him crazy. Just as he thought he would finally fall over the edge, the machine stilled. He let his head fall forward, a frustrated whine leaving his throat. “Tony… Come on. Please?”
Tony arched a brow. "I asked if you wanted bacon or sausage. I guess you weren't listening. That's ten."
“That’s right. Pretty baby. Feels good, doesn’t it?” When the reply took too long, he slapped the side of Steve’s face sharply, forcing his attention back. “Answer me.”
Gentle fingers brushing his cheek pulled him from his thoughts, and he offered Tony a tentative smile. “Ready, my beautiful omega?”
“So, my boy has manners after all. What do you think of pancakes…?” Tony took his time, alternating feeding Steve and himself. He made sure that the omega received small manageable bites, with plenty of time to chew and swallow. He also kept a running commentary going the entire time, about food and the things he liked, the things he thought Steve might enjoy. He wanted to get him used to the sound of Tony’s voice, as well as allowing plenty of time for the medication to start working.
“He put his arms around me. Held me. Told me everything was gonna be alright. He carried me into the kitchen, sat me on the counter while he worked. Made me hot chocolate from scratch, with whipped cream and sprinkles all over it. Blue ones. Said he bought them because they reminded him of my eyes. We curled up under blankets on the couch. And he kept telling me over and over again that it was gonna be alright. And… I finally believed him. I was sitting there, warm and safe for the first time I could remember, and just though, yeah, I wanna keep this. Made it easier to stop fighting so hard. And when I stopped, things got better.”
As soon as they looked away, Steve mumbled an excuse and fled to the bathroom. The moment he was alone, the vibrations stopped. A deep groan tore from his chest and he contemplated banging his head against the wall. Another soft chime from the phone.
Hot breaths panted against his ear as Tony chased his own orgasm, burying himself deep and spilling inside Steve’s body. Groaning as the continuous clenching drew out the pleasure. “How long could I keep you like this Steve? Hours? Days? Would you pass out before your body gave in? Would you let me? Huh? Would you let me do this whenever the fuck I want?”
“No, Steve. I told you, I am going to give you exactly what you need, whether you like it or not. And we’re starting now.” He let go of his chest, moved across the room to retrieve a box from the dresser. “I had JARVIS order a few things last night.”
“Good omega.” Strong arms dragged Steve to his feet, supported him as he unsteadily followed Tony to the elevator. As soon as they were inside, Tony crowded him into the corner, nipping and sucking at his neck, possessive hands running over his chest and hips. Steve could feel Tony’s hard cock pressed against his thigh. “You are so fucking good for me. Even when you hate it. I can’t get enough of you. Not now, not ever.”
Steve gazed up at him appreciatively as Tony quickly stripped his own clothes off before straddling his lap. The chain around his neck swung forward, the key brushing across his chest, drawing a whimper from Steve's lips.
“That’s better. You abuse the privileges you have, you lose them, honey. Better get that one through your head quick.” Tony picked up a small vial, filling a syringe with a heavy dose of the silvery liquid inside. When he turned back around, Steve tried to duck his head, protecting his neck from the contents, muffled pleading noises audible from behind the gag.
Steve’s hips jerked into the air, desperately seeking further contact, anything to push him over that edge. He groaned despairingly when none came. Tony stood, stretching his back. “I’m going to get another cup of coffee. You want one, sweetheart?”
The wicked grin from earlier returned to Tony’s lips, his eyes dark and predatory. “It’s a stimulant. Increases blood flow when it comes in contact with omega hormones. Does nothing to alpha’s though. I could fill you full of it and fuck you for hours and I wouldn’t feel a thing. Now, you on the other hand…”
The base of the vibrator swelled, pressing harder into his gland. He could feel the sharp pleasure through every inch of his body, shuddering helplessly as it pounded through him. Higher and higher, until with a scream he released, pulsing around the toy still buzzing away inside of him. Steve struggled against the restraints for a different reason now. The oversensitivity was painful as the vibrator continued to move inside of him, driving him through it and working him back to climax again.
