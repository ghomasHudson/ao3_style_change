After a beat, Cas tells him, “I love you.”
The girl nods “Ok. Thank you very much”
It happens like this, Dean goes to a bar just down the road the following night. It’s crowded but not to the point where it gets suffocating. The atmosphere is nice, Christmas songs on the side and even if Dean thinks if he smells even more nutmeg he will gag. He is on his third glass of whiskey, just feeling a pleasant buzz under his skin, still in control of his thoughts, when she take a seat on the stool next to him.
After a minute, in the periphery of his vision he watches as Castiel approaches him with a tray in one hand, and his heart skips a beat in nerves. Dean looks at him as he settles on the seat across from him. He thinks he should say something but he doesn’t seem to be able to form a sound, so he is left there, staring like an idiot.
“So, you didn't panic?”
He groans and turns laying on his back. There is something just there, under his skin and he knows that all he needs is a small thing to either explode or deflate. He just needs everything to stop for even just a minute.  Or maybe not cause in the quiet moments all he can think about is Cas. He makes a sound at the back of his throat and exhales shakily. He is an asshole, he always knew this, but now it feels like he is the biggest asshole in the whole world. Even if what he did was the right thing for both of them. Cas would have regretted it and it would end badly, and Dean couldn't have handled that. So it was for the best for everyone involved.
Sam gives him a look full of pride and with such love that Dean has to look away, then in an instant he feels his arms around him.
“I’m-” he starts and then stops, trying to remember Sams’ words, but comes up empty. “I don't know, but I thought you were and in my defense half of our conversations were about yours or Gabriels’ marriage, and I don't- it seemed that way”
“I’m just going to grab something from the kitchen, alright? I’ll be right back” he doesn’t move though, and Dean realises he is waiting for a reply.
“Thank you” he says quietly after a minute and Castiel smiles at him making him roll his eyes.
It is Sunday and he no longer goes to the garage on these days – Bobby has forbidden him to come in, something about time to himself -, it is how he finds himself seating in a cafe slash bookstore, studying intro to economics and management and hating his life. He came here a week ago with the members of the project he had to do for Bevell’s class for their last meet up before submitting it, and he really liked it. So, he decided to take advantage of that and use it for studying one of the worst subjects. It relaxes him being here, especially the murmur of the other people getting coffee, it helps him focus strangely enough. Today though he can’t seem to be able to concentrate. He gets up and buys a second americano, goes back to his table, looks at the screen of his laptop and sighs deeply.
“She’s going to die”
Someone makes a sound, could be him and he becomes aware that they are moving. They have left the kitchen, not that it matters. He doesn't know where they are going, he knows where he wants to go and he thinks Cas is going there too. And that alone ignites something in him and he wants, needs to touch more, hear more. Because, now he can hear Cas moaning and becomes painfully aware of his cock throbbing in his pants.
“History of art and philosophy, actually”
“Oh, please it’s about damn time. You have been more than ready and Dean is well, we both know what he is to you. Even if you insist on not wording it”
Castiel gives him a puzzled look, as if he is not registering his words, then his face clears “Yeah” he breaths into his neck “me too”
There is a painting, on the wall next to the kitchen door, of a diner, where a man drinks alone and there is another man and a woman further down the bar. He thinks he has seen it before, but can’t remember where.
Though his panic mustn’t show on his face, because Dean says with fake irritation “Hey, no spoilers”
Dean can’t help staring at him as he gets under the covers and after a moment, he follows him. It’s warm and soft and it smells like Cas. They turn on their sides, just staring at each other open, with no restrains, feet tangled.
“I’m clean” he tells him huskily, opening his eyes and looks at him through his lashes.
“But you had the time to tell me”
“Why?” Castiel asks squinting at him. He doesn't understand why Dean feels embarrassed about it or thinks that Castiel would make fun of him for reading it. It’s one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century, in his opinion everyone should read it.
Today is one of those days. On top of that there had been another murder two days ago and Castiel is getting angry and frustrated to the pointed he shouted at Hannah and Inias, and then got angry at himself and everyone else at general vicinity. He can’t help it, they have made no progress. The guy is careful, too careful and Castiel knows everyone slips at least once and he is waiting for it. It’s just he doesn't know for how long he can wait. He just wants it to stop, all those people dying for no reason. Its stressing him out which adds to his anxiety, which leads to him having a lot more trouble sleeping or staying asleep.
He watches as Oli lays down too, from sitting up on the bed next to him. He always sleeps on the end of the bed, but now lays next to Dean, who reaches a hand and touches the soft fur and cries.
Sam turns back to him, “Yes but they are expensive”
“Dean” Cas says and it’s
“Dean?”
“I don't know,” he trails off waiting for her to say her name.
“I thought you- I thought it was” he looks away again and Dean knows what he means and freezes, his blood running cold.
Right. He needs a moment to digest that, so he looks down at his hands.
“Sure” he says “He is probably hungry anyways”
When Castile continues to look at him, he huffs, stopping a nervous smile, “What?”
“It could be anything.”
When he is finally in, he locks the door, puts the alarm and turns on all the lights. He takes off his coat, Olis’ leash, his shoes and removes the sweater too, throws it on the coach on his way to the kitchen. He drinks a glass of water. And then another and tries to gets his breathing under control. He goes up to the bedroom, turns the lights on and removes his clothes.
Castiel kills the engine of the car about twenty minutes later. Neither moves, they both stare at the three story, pale red building of Jackson High motionless. After a time, Castiel turns to look at him. Dean clenches his jaw, running a hand across his face and letting out a breath.
“No, haven’t had one in eight months” he answers honestly and settles further in his seat.
He stops outside the door and takes a deep breath, which bad idea, because it smells of cigarettes and mould and he thinks he should be used of it by now.
Dean is one step away from murdering his neighbour and whomever he is with, someone who is apparently a screamer. He had hoped that after yesterday they would either be too high – as his neighbour was most of the time-, too tired or at least she would have lost her voice, Dean is surprised she hasn't, but no instead it’s going to be another sleepless half night. Not that he really needs their help for that.
“No seriously. You have been using expressions lately that are more-”
Fucking microeconomics and fucking Bevell with her stupid accent. Dean is muttering curses all the way to the literature building, which thankfully is not that far. He gets in and goes to the board with the layout of the building trying to locate the lecture hall he needs to be in. He finds it and climbs up the stairs to the second floor. He walks hastily, not that he is late and even if he was, he can still get in before the ten-minute mark, not that he is ever going to, but he is more comfortable being early, besides he has to think about the project Bevell has them work on. He got the email this morning explaining the topic they were going to work on, along with the other members names and emails.
much. You know that”
“Burgers?”
“It has fruits in it.” he says and motions to the blueberry muffins “But I’ll have a chocolate one”
“Dean”
He exits Billie’s office building and immediately buttons his jacket.
“Whe-” he starts, but stop yelping slightly, his body moving forward a bit in response, cause Cas has his left nipple in his mouth and playing with the other one using his hand. He is shaking slightly and he can’t take it, he needs- his breaths are coming short now and his is panting.
“Sorry, but Shurley wants to talk to you.”
silently among the things around us
He opens it and sees the number of messages from Gabriel, rolls his eyes and puts the phone in his pocket. He moves to the door, but stops.
“Pizza?”
When the lecture ends, he picks up his stuff, and leaves the room hastily without looking up and heads to the library; he needs to return the book he borrowed for statistics, and what was supposed to be a one hour study session turns into three of studying microeconomics, before he mans up enough to admit that he needs to confront the thing that is nudging the back of his mind.
He sighs, again and picks up the gloves, then he gets up, takes one of the tennis balls and the poop bags, pockets them as well, puts on him gloves and they leave the townhouse.
From the guy next door, with the constant banging on the wall, at random times through the day and night, to the girl at the coffee shop that decided that Dean needed cream in his coffee.
“Shut up and drive”
“It’s just- You are like” she stops glancing at something behind his shoulder and then back at him “You are almost like before” and she says it so carefully, hesitantly even.
“I wrote my phone number. Call me.”
“Dean” Cas breaths into his mouth, “It’s ok. Slowdown”
He thinks that this is just for three years; he keeps the end goal at the front of his mind, it’s so he can get the garage. He thinks of Bobby and Sam, and realises, that interesting or not he is doing this.
When they break apart, breathing heavily, he says “Castiel”, causing Dean to frown.
The only reason he had even agreed to go to the interview was because of the constant nudging and begging from Sam, and when later he went to work, one look at Bobby, told him that not only he knew about the letter, he was also part of the whole scheme. The worst part was that he couldn't counter their arguments, they both had the same, how if the university saw something maybe he should try, that they both believed in him (Sams’ words) and he really could do it and other stuff like that. Truth is he couldn't outright refuse for two reasons; one Bobby was paying the largest part of the tuition fees and two he wanted Dean to take over the garage slash salvage yard when he retires and thought a business degree would be a good idea. And Dean agreed, of course he agreed, he knew the man all his life and for the last five and a half years, since he and Sam moved here and Dean started working for him, Bobby has become a father to Dean. A father that he never dreamed he would have and he couldn't possibly lose, so business degree it is. Problem is Dean believed they, he, Bobby and Sam, had agreed on community college, but apparently his idiotic brother had decided otherwise after reading his application and had send it to university of Chicago as well.
“Want to see a movie?” he asks Dean
partly angry with Cas, Cas just doesn’t know it.
"Dean." He breaths in mixture if relief and worry.
Novak has an aura around him that has Dean stand to attention, he is one of those people that’s imposing and authoritative without doing anything. Effortlessly. It makes something in Deans’ stomach curl and not in a bad way. Although his gaze does make him shift uncomfortably. Dean likes
. He takes a shuddering breath, as he watches him sit down on the stool and disposes the trench coat he has been holding along with the satchel, on the stool next to him, the navy fabric of his suit stretching in his biceps and Dean has to swallow.
“I know it’s stupid but -”
“Yes it is.” she insists going back to translating.
But then he hears the door open and footsteps approaching him and he places his hands on the table interlocking his fingers. He can do this.
He is browsing on his phone, when he hears-
Then he had turned to take the order from a family a few tables down and Dean hadn't notice Bobby coming back. He sat down and when his eyes had found Dean's the teenager had turned away, staring at his half empty glass.
“She works at the senior high school, she is a, ugh, English teacher.” He says and looks up at Dean’s phone where the map is open. “You were supposed to take a left here.”
“We knew each other for more than a decade,” he takes a breath that rattles his chest and doesn’t help at all. “We- we screwed each other a lot through those years but yeah.” He doesn’t know why he says that, he also doesn’t know why he adds “We fought a lot of wars together. I spent an entire year looking for the fucker in Pu-” he stops grimacing, “in a foreign-” he struggles and flutters. He used to be good at this, smoother.
When he gets there on Saturday, it’s busy, but not as busy as it will get in about an hour though. He finds Jo and Benny sitting in a table talking and he walks up at them.
He hears the voices of drunk people on his left and wrinkles his nose, no that he is one to judge, still. He thoughts are drifting going all over the place he thinks about Sam and dad and tries not feel guilty about either. But his mind stops at dad, and the state of his body when they called him to identify him and he has to stop walking or he’ll hurl.
He wets his lips and listen as footsteps ascend the stairs, walking steadily towards him until they stop outside the door.
“Yeah you don't seem the type” Dean says not unkindly, then after a few seconds, because insecurity is eating him “We don't- we don’t have to”. Then Novaks eyes are back at him, looking in that way that makes Dean’s skin erupt in goosebumps, “Auden’s is pretty good anyways” he utters, distracted.
Castiel shifts in his seat taking his trench coat off, “Would you believe me if I said I just felt like it”
“I know” she says loudly, recoiling at his words and Dean knows how useless they are. How much they hurt, how much revulsion they bring. You are aware they are true and yet...
“Hey” he says back, as she walks in, closing the door behind her. She sits in a chair in front of his desk and leaves a file on the edge of the desk, on top of his notes. “To what I owe the visit?”
He remembers when he felt eyes on him, something that he was used to, but not in that manner. When he had looked up and seen the man that was looking at him, he felt like the guy was seeing right through him, it made the hair at the back of his neck stand. He shook his head. And started to walk towards the bus station a few meters away from the station. He checks for the buses on the screen, he has to wait for eleven minutes for the next bus.
“Look if this is about money don't worry. I have been saving, with the part time job and all”
“Just a fact.”
“Dean” he repeats more firmly.
“What?” he asks and the glare he receives makes him want to laugh. Cas rolls his eyes and exhales.
“It’s fine, I didn’t think, I’d never think you’d be anything but”
“He doesn't dump them.”
“I know”
“Well. Dean, come on in” She says turning on her heels and opens the door slipping through it.
The more time passes the more relaxed Dean becomes and that calms Castiel as well. He thinks that out of all the things he enjoys with Dean, sitting is silence is one of his favourites. It is almost as enjoyable as when Dean talks about stuff he is passionate about.
“I don't think I look different” She laughs a little at that. “I am fine, though” He adds, giving her a small smile and goes to his office.
A hand touches his cock and his vision darkens as he is worked over the edge, Cas soon following with a grunt and a broken
“So” she starts after he finished talking about his week, leaving the Novak part out, like always; he finds himself wanting to talk about him, although he doesn't know what he wants to say exactly; it’s not like there is anything to say, he keeps telling himself every time he thinks about it. “I think it’s time we talked about the elephant in the room”
“It’s not funny” Cas grumbles “It slipped from my hands and into the road and a car just totaled it. And I did call you”
“Three” it is more of a question and Novak nods continuing.
“Can’t you give him a better name?” she chuckles at his expression.
“Dean, it’s fine, you- It’s fine”
She clears her throat. “They got what was combing for them.”
“After Karen died, well not after after, Jodi pushed” he tells him “But yeah”
“She called yesterday” he says neutrally, but his hands shake slightly and he can hear Anna take a sharp breath.
"I get it"
“He was homeless” Castiel says quietly.
“I want you to know this won’t affect you academically. I can be impartial” Castiel eventually says after a moment, a little thickly, that he masks with clearing his throat. And Dean pretends that it’s as hard for Castiel as it is for him.
“Don't get angry.” He says hastily and rips a page from a notepad, writing something on it. “If something happens” he adds handing the paper to Dean.
He takes his tooth brush and brushes his teeth to remove the sour taste, then walks back out.
He thinks about how Dean takes all rational thoughts out of his brain sometimes, like now, and how he doesn't mind. Maybe that should alarm him, because Castiel never did anything without a plan, without a reason and with Dean everything is about moments and bits and whatever happens and he basks into it, despite his hesitation and qualm.
Afterwards when they are laying in bed and all the that Castiel can hear is Deans’ breaths, he thinks about the time he enjoyed sleeping alone and how now, though he rarely admits it, misses Deans’ presence. He also thinks that this is the first time they are sleeping together without having sex and that makes his heart beat a little faster in his chest. Everything seems natural, like they have been doing this for years, like this is what they have.
His heart is beating rapidly in his chest for an entirely different reason now. It’s the first time those thoughts don’t make his throat close up, and that leaves him standing there, leaning against the door not knowing how to act. He practically feels it when that thought settles in his brain and becomes
which were all bullshit if you asked him. He wasn't anything special, hell he hadn’t
“Or someone pissed her off.”
“Nothing. You can see the catalogues in the kitchen”
“Alright, I wont spoil anything”
“Ok, well,” he says unbuckling his seatbelt, “you getting out of the car or what?” he steps out walking to the building entrance, not stopping to wait for Castiel until he reaches the entrance.
“A few. She can’t just resurrect all angels from the Empty so she is making some new ones. But Gabriel is back, he is helping her make more and run the place.”
“The papers and exams are graded by an external examiner as well as me and if the grades are not close to each other they are reviewed. So you don’t have to worry” he continues assuring.
Dean freezes there on his knees holding the lube and condom, staring at Cas transfixed, because holy hell. He is so so
When he goes to work the next morning, the weird feeling hasn't left him and it shows to the point that Bobby asks him about it. Not that Bobby doesn't care or ask generally, but usually he doesn't go around it using the words “What is it Dean? Is college or something else?”
He lied. He can avoid Cas or at least he can not engage too much, something that Cas notices making him ask how he is. Dean replies that he is just stressed about the bar and then Cas is reassuring him that everything will go great and to have more faith in himself. Dean scoffs and half hates himself, half wants to say
Cas emails him on Friday afternoon about the contract, saying it is alright and he should proceed with everything, at which Dean shoots him a text saying he should be resting the night before the big day, earning a rolling eyed emoji and tries to ignore the tightness in his chest.
“Yes, I have gathered” he says sourly but with an amused glint in his eyes.
He hears someone clear their throat behind him and he turns to look at them. A woman with brown hair and blue eyes looks at him with raised eyebrows.
He leans over the toilet and empties whatever is in his stomach.
Benny tells them their sum and Castiel takes his card out and can see Dean reach for his wallet as well but he just pays and moves towards the waiting area, without looking back at him. He knows Dean is going to be more irritated, but he doesn't care. He has come to find that he gets annoyed whenever someone gives him something, so Castiel has come to ignore the scowls.
Then at a gap between the first and the second paragraph he sees it, in a quick handwriting that is still neat and cursive, it reads 144 Romsey Rd.
Sam takes a seat on the empty stool, “I came to see you”
“Nothing happened to Dr Milton, she is on sabbatical and that's why I will be teaching this course for this academic year” he answers, “The same principles apply. The only thing you need to keep in mind is that my office hours are on Fridays, not Mondays like Annas’, one to four. If you have a class on these hours or any other obligation and can’t make it, but want to see me just email me and we will work something out. Also, the lectures from now on, will happen in my lecture hall, which is on the sixth floor, number L367”
Instead they just stare at each other as Dean rinses the soap of his body. He dries himself and walks back to the bedroom, puts on a pair of boxers and a shirt, that he is pretty sure is Cas’ and thinks of lying down, but remembers the lights and goes back out to turn them off.
“You still on for Saturday?” she asks excitedly, sitting up straighter. Something passes in her eyes, fast, Dean pays it no mind, he is too busy trying to think what they are doing tomorrow.
He opens the car door and takes the paper bag Cas has left in his seat, before sitting down and closes the door with a bit more force than necessary. Cas starts driving and says “Whatever he told you please ignore it”
“I-” he mutters minutes later or hours, he is not sure. “I don’t know what to do. I mean I know what I should but-”
“By the time it got bad, or I realized it was bad, I felt like I couldn't get away. He, I- I didn't want to get away, I talked to some subs in the club, it was so different than what I was doing, but I thought different doms, so-” he licks his lips and swallows thickly, “I didn't want to leave him Cas” he has never said it out loud before, and it hurts so much, it rips his chest open and leaves him there bleeding, like when he was at Alistair’s’, only this time Cas is there. Cas who squeezes him and runs a hand through his hair and says “It’s understandable”
“Hey, no need to thank me. Just doing my job.” Jody responds with a smile, that Castiel returns albeit not as big and a little tight, exhaustion both physical and emotional, starts to weigh on him from the time spent going through the case these past few days.
He looks away, at the top of the fridge where the whiskey bottles are, there is an itch under his skin that he doesn’t indulge to, even if it gets harder and harder by the second.
“I wanted-” Castiel starts. “I don’t do this” he repeats himself, “Especially not with a student. Never with a student”
“Hello?” he asks frowning.
“Yeah”
“Is me” he half asks, half says with a sad smile finally looking at her.
“bitch”
“Oh, well” Castiel says, blinking owlishly at him. “I wasn't expecting it so fast”
Great, just great. He clenches his teeth and exhales slowly. “Right, and you are sure I can’t go to-”
Because he is angry at Cas. Cas who, he hasn't left despite all the things he knows, despite who and what Dean is. And Dean hates him for it and also doesn't, because he doesn't know what to do with all that. He doesn't know what to do with the feeling in his chest, the changes in the way he sees things, and most importantly himself, especially when he is around Cas, the fact that he has let himself believe things, things that were never meant for him or last night. God he is going to explode, he can feel it in his chest. All those years, all those things building up and he is going to explode right here in Cas’ kitchen. He puts a hand in front of his mouth as if it will contain everything that is going to spill out, and tries desperately to breath.
Cas eyes widen and he chuckles softly, and says bashfully, “I broke my phone or a car broke my phone.”
He does search for Eliot, Seferis and Auden when he goes to the bookstore on that Sunday noon. It takes him all two seconds after he went through the door of the shop, to decide to do so. He finds two collections, one of Auden and one of Eliot, but not Seferis, in fact when he asks a sales person about him, he just shoots Dean a confused look and Dean tells him not to worry about it; he guesses two out of three is as good as it’ll get.
“Like a last meal?” she asks incredulously.
“Do you think I shouldn't apply to like, the places I was thinking with Kevin?” he asks looking so insecure, making Dean sober up and forget about his own worries.
“Yeah, I think. In fact, I am almost certain, that he is a sex worker.” Castiel raises his eyebrows in question.
The first thing Castiel notices when he arrives at the hotel room is how good it smells. He usually doesn't like the way hotels smell, it is pleasant, but it reminds him of something plastic, fake. This one though, has a pleasant smell of lavender. He goes further into the room and sees Inias by the balcony door talking to a woman that works at the hotel, judging by her uniform. He turns on his left and sees the bed, where a man that can’t be older than twenty-five lays with the sheets drown up to his chest. He almost looks like he is sleeping, but the colour of his face clearly states that he is dead. He sees Hannah taking pictures and he moves closer to the body. He is fully clothed, Castiel remarks. Something about the way that he is positioned though unsettles him, and he squints titling his head to the side and looking at the man’s face, as if it holds the answer to what happened. It usually does.
He glances at the point of contact then back up again.
“I know, I know just” he doesn't know how to continue so he stops, swallowing with difficulty, so he takes a sip of water.
“Like drunk and passed out”
“Sam-”
He finishes eating the muffin and looks towards the counter, maybe he will have another one. A blueberry one this time. But then he sees that trench coat and the unruly hair and swallows audibly. He is ordering and maybe he will take his coffee or whatever and leave. Though, Dean isn’t sure he will be happy with that. So, he continues to look, not gaze he tells himself, and waits.
Oli makes a sound and Dean presses his lips together. Yeah ok he misses him too but this is ridiculous.
Dean rakes his brain trying to find a face, he remembers her name just not –
“You are not worried that there is someone out there killing prostitutes and that you could be one of them?” he asks incredulously, like he can’t believe Dean is comfortable with the idea of death. Not that he is, but still.
They are a block away from the apartment, when Dean sees him. He has to stop and stare, because the people are only illuminated by the street lights and the man is somewhat turned and Dean isn’t certain it is him. It has been a decade after all. He could be wrong. He wants to be wrong. He
“We’ll practice.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas releases a breath and leaves a nervous laugh, running a hand through his hair. “I am sorry”
They are not that many people there, maybe thirty and Dean moves them towards the center in a row where just a middle-aged couple is sitting, eating popcorn idly and talking. They sit down and Castiel looks around curiously. Dean checks his phone, they have five minutes until the movie starts.
“Where do we pay?”
He is not getting any smoother as the years go, Dean thinks watching him leave the room.
“No, I explained to him the situation and he- he agreed” he says and slips inside the car, making Dean roll his eyes.
“She might be able-”
“So where am I going?” he asks glancing at Dean.
He is just putting the tray in the oven when Jody walks in.
“She was far more enthusiastic than I expected, considering the sort notice.”
Before he overthinks it and loses his nerve, like with all the stupid shit he does, he gets out of Baby, walks up the steps to the black door and like last time he stops, but only for a second, just enough for a fleeting thought.
Novak makes a noise and Dean raises his eyes to look at him. He is still focused on the essay and Dean wants him to get it over with already.
“Don't interrupt me. Thought you wanted to know, since you are all, you know” she raises her eyebrows suggestively. He hears Hannah chuckle and turns to glare at her, panicking slightly because that's not what-
He hates the town, it’s cold and small and everywhere he turns there are stupid idyllic houses occupied by stupid idyllic people, with stupid Christmas decorations and worst of all Michael is here. Not that Dean dislikes him per se, yes he is the reminder of another Michael completely different but still the same in some places. And yes he is a little angry with him for what he did with Chuck but most is forgiven, there is no point anyways. This Michael learned his lesson with his father and Adam seems to be a decisive point in that change.
The door opens and Hannah steps in, the door half closed behind her. Dean turns around without raising his eyes to look at her and moves to the desk where his bag is.
“It’s great”
Her eyes soften and she smiles at him, “I know, you don't need to apologize. We understand, we just, we miss you.” Dean nods shifting in his seat a little uncomfortable, “Stop” she says sternly, then continues “Just promise that you will come on Saturday”
“We travelled a lot. In fact, the longest we stayed somewhere was a month, in a town somewhere in Iowa.” He doesn't get more specific, he can’t, maybe another time he will be able to tell him about the motel, dad who hadn’t showed up in weeks and what he did when he came back found they were sort on money. He takes a shaky breath to steady himself and goes on. “When mum died, dad changed. In the beginning I didn't understand, I was barely six, so I couldn't understand why he was so- why he put us in the car the next day and we just left everything. We moved all over the place, we stayed at motels and I just- Sam was a baby when it happened, in the beginning dad would take care of him but after some months, when he was almost one, he would ask me to take care of him more and more. Until I was, the one that took care of him,
The first time they had done this, Tom had asked him if he got hard and Dean had said no, its not how this works, and they left it at that. But after a few weeks of doing this, he asked Dean if he could just for that time and after some coaxing and few extra bucks he agreed, just for that time. He had done it for one more, but that's when it ended, because then it didn't matter, it was before-
He looks at the envelope with a blank expression on his face for several seconds or minutes, he isn’t sure. Acid makes its way to his mouth and he feels like he is waiting for a bomb to explode in his face.
Next Friday, Dean remembers the change of classroom when he is just outside the previous one, he rolls his eyes to himself and walks to the elevator. He gets in the, frankly crowded elevator and makes it to the classroom, just two minutes before the class is supposed to start.
He passes a door that has a sign that says “For Staff only” and then another that is blank and then he sees a third one that says “Detective C. J. Novak”.
“You know I could never do homicides” she says staring at the board.
Dean’s lips twist. He drops his fork on his plate and takes a sip from his freshly brewed coffee. It burns going down his throat and he loses his taste for a few seconds.
“Good.” He says going for a more modulated tone, “We are not going to talk about that.”
“Ok” Castiel says and takes a step back. “I’ll just- I’ll be right back”
He knows angels can feel longing, Claire told him one day when it was just the two of them fishing.
Castiel takes his hand and it’s so warm that it spreads all over Dean’s body, and leads them to his bedroom; once they are there he turns around and attacks Dean’s lips again. He takes off Dean’s jacket and leaves it on the floor. Next he reaches for his flannel, then his shirt and pulls and Dean lets him, but let’s out a chuckle, goose bumps rising on his skin.
His walk towards the office becomes slower and slower the more he nears it, until he turns right and finds a desk on the right side of a dark brown door, that has a gold plate writing C. J. Novak and underneath BA Literature Program Lead.
They serve themselves and Cas gives him the cup of coffee and sugar. Dean takes a sip of it and sighs, Cas smiles, a small tentative smile, at him and he mirrors it. They eat in silence, halfway through Carmen wines standing at the back door and Castiel opens it for her and Dean remembers to ask him for a pill, cause his nose is twitching now as well.  After that, they talk about Cas’ work, mainly about Hannah and Inias and other people Dean doesn't know, but has heard a lot about. All of the tension gone, though they don't broach last night and Dean is content about that, he doesn't know how to handle it or what to say. There is a feeling still deep inside him, that can’t leave him alone, something that says something is going to break.
“Amara brought you back?” Dean asks voice rough and cold, with a dangerous promise under it, there is a sharpness on his features that makes him appear as if he is made from steel.
He rolls his shoulders and tries to relax. September is ending and the days are getting chillier and he dreads the winter. He used to like it when he was a kid, even when he was on the road with his dad and Sam, and he hadn’t eaten in days and it was cold. There was something cathartic about winter and it made him feel clean in a way, peaceful, but for the last few years it has been awful. It makes him feel isolated and alone and cold in a way that has nothing to do with temperature. Anyways, he doesn't need to worry too much about it for now.
“I don't know if I want to tell Sam yet, so I won’t give him the-”
“I know” Cas says, surprisingly calm for the way he looks and turns towards the man “You are not in trouble”
“Listen, I don't want you to worry about me. Just focus on your studies and social life, not that you ever had one” he is deflecting he knows, but at least Sam huffs a laugh on the other side. “I am fine, drop it please” he says in a quiet voice. An image of downtown comes on his mind and he tries to think of something else, anything but fails.
“They told me it’s what you usually get”
Hannah raises an eyebrow, looking warily at him and he just smiles at her, shouting a “Bye, call if you find something
“Sure” Donna smiles softly at him and gets up as well, Castiel can tell that she thinks there is something off about them and he knows she will ask him later, but he can’t pretend to care.
“What?” Dean says confused and a little panicking, hearing the word, but taking him seconds to process it.
There is a part of him that thought that if,
Then he raises his eyes and looks at himself in the mirror. His hair is a mess, more so than usual, he has a few hickeys in his neck and generally looks exactly how he feels; like a hurricane went through him and he liked it, but doesn't know how to act in the aftermath.
On those days he goes to the living room, Carmen in tow and lays on the old couch, that everyone hates, he himself included at times, but doesn't seem to throw away and get a new one. He puts on some music and just lays there listening until morning. He thinks about his life, about Mick and how he used to joke that Castiel was emotionally attached to the couch he got on bargain when he was in college and the only way that the couch would leave from their lives would be if the apartment caught fire. He remembers the good and the bad days and sometimes he starts crying silently and then laugh at the same time for how things turned out and how he wished they had.
“You don't think you are beautiful?” he knows it’s not what Dean wants to hear, or the most important thing in what he has said, but Castiel finds himself wanting him to know at least that.
“I didn't have time for me, for things I wanted to do, hell I didn't even know what they were. I was too busy with Sam, stressing over money, dad and his obsessions and school. I couldn't ask for things I wanted to do, or when I did I was
Dad had raised his eyes from his plate, studying, dark, the edges tightening before Dean looked down at his plate, swallowing thickly the canned beans in his mouth, his palms sweaty.
The asshole that is in the stupid conference all the way to Seattle, giving a fucking talk tonight. In the beginning Dean was excited, and a proud mother according to Sam but what does he know, and don't get him wrong he still is and he still is proud and all, he just misses him. More than usual. They have been apart before and ok it might have been two summers ago but still. It must be because Christmas is around the corner and all the stupid commercials are going on about spending the holidays with loved ones.
The voice is wrong, is deep and-
“Ok so,” Dean starts pulling out of the station’s parking lot, the weight that has been following him from when he woke up having abate since they went to the morgue and he has to focus on the case, “we go talk to the wife?”
Dean's vision swims and he fights to get the words out, "I still like girls," he blurts, tears escaping "I, I just- just sometimes it's not-"
Dean has been arrested before, not for prostitution though, for shoplifting when he was fourteen. And though he has always been careful, that afternoon he was frustrated and hungry and Sam wasn’t patient either, not that eight-year olds are when they are hungry, and all they have been eating for the past four days is cereal. All this made him careless in his actions. The owner caught him and called the cops, who took him to the station and called John, who after paying bail, made sure Dean understood how much careful he needed to be and that money wasn't for him to use for his malfeasances.
“What? Is it a test?” Castiel just raises his brows expectantly. “Maybe I’ll start with the fries” That earns him a halfhearted glare causing him to grin.
“Trying to prove to me that lawyers can have fun? And we saw each other on Tuesday, and though I know you can’t live without me, that is too soon even for you”
They get into the elevator and Cas presses the button for the parking lot. They finally reach the parking after being pulled up twice, smiling politely to other people and awkward small talk on Castiels’ part, which amuses Dean even more and earns him a glare.
Hope you liked it. Thank you for sticking with me :)
The younger man huffs and sits straighter in his seat.
“You didn't want to come back here” Dean concludes and Cas turns his head and stares in his eyes.
“From what you’ve said all those weeks, I think you know the answer to that”
“No Claire?”
“Like a witch?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“He was choking on his-” she sobs and Dean heart clenches, the walls closing in on him and he has to close his a eyes for a moment. “It’s my job you know? To save people. I couldn’t do that.”
He turns to look at her his neck protesting at the abrupt movement. “You are not
“Nothing” he says defensively and when Novak continues to look at him expectantly and annoyed, he asks “What do I write about?”
At least he was in the station last night, the pressure decreases at the thought and he draws a breath turning to Anna.
“I don't need one and I don't need to knock either” he retorts and opens the door.
Cas sighs and glances at him, “I don't know. We are doing our best. But it’s not just Hannah or Inias or I, it’s-” another sigh, “everyone, or most of everyone, there still some that-” his eyes harden a bit and his mouth tightens, but he continues “the officers that do patrols in that area, are also frustrated and they try to help, but… nothing.” He eats a spoonful of cereal and adds “They have been trying to convince people to go off the street. There have been a bit more arrests than usual”
“Castiel” he doesn’t whine, and he normally wouldn’t complaint but his legs are killing him from the work at the garage and it’d be more comfortable in a bed.
“We know” they both say at the same time.
“Fine” he exclaims and goes to retrieve the stupid list. Giving it a once over and grimacing. He is not going to buy all these.
Dean becomes aware – or he makes himself believe, he is not entirely sure on that, which makes him be in a nonstop circle of
“It’s ok.” He says walking inside the kitchen and flashes him a smile “‘morning” and he can barely catch himself from continuing his sentence.
“Okay, people know of me, but not a lot. I don't qualify as famous”
Castiel wears a pair of gloves, he hates those things, and lifts the blanket. He takes the mans right arm and rolls the sleeve up. And yes, on the inside of the arm, there is a small swelling, where the poison was injected. He sighs and rolls the sleeve down. He sees the crew that came to remove the body and offers them a greeting, before removing the gloves and stepping out of the room.
, his mind provides and he sticks with that – and their relationship with their vessel, he doesn’t know if it was like Michael and Adam.
“Right”
“He had those knives, and he’d cut. Everywhere. Not deep enough to cause a damage but deep enough to hurt and he would just watch, or touch me in those places, or or” he stops, sees bloody fingers and lips, and empty laughs with mocking, cruel smiles and empty bottles of alcohol. He trembles, instead he says “He’d fuck me after. And I felt, in a fucked-up way, useful. Like I was worth something. Like I could make somebody- I thought if I didn't complain he wouldn't leave, so I never said anything”
“From Green Street,” at Castiel continued lost expression, he shakes his head “leave it”
They get undressed in a haze of fervent and light touches and lips. Dean finds himself underneath Castiel on the bed circling his hands, down his chest over his nipples, they are not as sensitive as Dean’s, still they do elicit a few shudders.
“I” he starts but stops himself. Castiel can see the beginning of a blush on his face. He thought it was odd, Dean didn't appear to be the kind of person that got embarrassed that easily.
“What? I can’t just drop by; see how you are?” she asks and turns the chair so she is completely facing the him.
Dean shrugs. “I don't know. Probably yes. But if she says she can do it, then she can”
They take Deans’ car, that Castiel stares at for about a minute with both an appreciative and apprehensive look. Which is odd and Dean has no idea how he can manage both at once. But he does get inside, leaving his satchel in the space between his feet and looks like he is about to say something but, seems to think better of it and just puts his seatbelt on. Dean lets him choose the place and after some protest, Castiel directs him to a place, that according to him makes the best burgers in Washington, DC. When Dean looks at it, he is kind of reluctant to believe it. It is in a small street, shoved between a dry cleaners and a funeral home, and looks like it has been forgotten since the 1950s’, but takes Castiels’ word for it. That's how they end up in a booth, after having order two bacon cheeseburgers, one with fries and the other with a salad.
“Yes” he responds abruptly staring up at Dean. He sighs, closing his eyes. “There are a lot going on”
“Oh, you have been talking to Gabriel about this” He responds with a frown.
He had noticed Dean staring, but his smile didn't waver. He had looked back at Dean with a flash of something in his eyes and gave him a half nod. Not like the ones Dean got at the diners late at night. It made him blush faintly, in his utter embarrassment.
Dean stills and Tom looks up at him questioningly, but he just dismisses it with a shake of his head and smirks reaching for Toms’ dick. His fingertips teasing over the slit and the others’ man breath catches, before taking it into his hand. He starts jerking him and watches as he moans and throws his head back. And Dean moans encouragingly back at him. He doesn't talk, Tom doesn't like it.
“But?”
“But you and Castiel,” he flinches so hard on the name his hand knocks underneath the table causing it to rattle, the salt shaker falls and spills and Sam’s herbal tea splashes a little and the fork left on the side of the plate falls to the ground with a cluttering sound that hurts Dean’s body.
Dean splutters and coughs, turning around with wide eyes, his heart beating rapidly in his chest, cause what the hell? Cas just takes the bag and sighs exasperated. “Thank you Gabe, I’ll see you later”
“Haha very funny.” Dean can picture his face in his head and he chuckles, relaxing minutely. “What about you? Got anybody to ask out?”
“You are wondering why I’ve got custody of him” Dean interrupts him. Castiel nods looking a bit sheepish.
“It is a public library” Castiel responds calmly, like it answers everything. Dean raises his eyebrows incredulously. A few seconds pass where they just stare at each other. And Castiel feels something sifting in his chest, but maybe it is just his imagination.
“I’m gonna get out of here, before I cause any more trouble”
. He sways forward, bracing himself on his hands on the either side of the sink and he tries to breathe through the claws in his throat.
“Well, you know how hard college is,” she says innocently with a shrug and Dean shakes his head at her.
. “I never thought I’d live in a house. I mean I wanted to get this house, even if it's a little big for me, it's the only one I liked from when I was looking to buy. But I don't know, I- sometimes I get scared.”
Novak raises his eyebrows then huffs a laugh, there is amusement in his eyes. It’s strange Dean thinks, not in a bad way, just an unfamiliar one; his expressions are limited, going from frowning, to neutral, to squinting, to titling his head in confusion, something Dean will never admit in finding endearing or that his stomach flutters slightly at the sound now. And the one in the library, not that Dean thinks about that.
“Do you want to come?” he asks looking straight into Dean’s eyes and oh god, somehow he knows. He knows that if he refuses him Dean will comply, he will just fall asleep like that, he knows that there is a thrill going through Dean at the thought. His eyes darken into an impossible blue and a sound leaves Dena’s parted lips, because he doesn’t know what he wants and he just needs him to-
He focuses on Cas’ touch grounding himself. Then wispers, “The things I let him do” he swallows, and Cas squeezes his shoulder, but Dean can’t look up at him. “I didn't know anyone here, I mean I had Ellen and Bobby, but no one outside them and I- It was a year after dad died, and I had moved here with Sam, he was in his last year of high school. I knew he wanted to leave and I don't know, it was pretty, I felt- I felt abandoned. Again. It’s not an excuse but” he is trembling, he tries to control it, burying himself deeper into the bed, “I had been going at the club for some time, a couple of months or something. He was so, so
He realizes his breaths are elaborated and he swallows soundly trying to make himself breathe normally, his hands clench and unclench around the fabric of his trousers and when that doesn’t help he digs his nails in his thighs. It does nothing but give him a distant sting.
“Anna this is great”
He nips on his lower lip drawing a low sound from Castiel, who grips the hair at the back of his head and pulls slightly and they need to stop before they get thrown out. Instead, he pulls himself closer to Castiel, who pulls away again. The hand that was gripping his hair, relaxes, resting on the back of his head. He moves his other hand to touch the side of Deans face, the touch is so light, but grounding, his thumb grazing the side of his mouth and Dean closes his eyes, swallowing heavily.
“Hello” Inias greets him. “Charlie called, said she is a little busy and she’ll run the prints as soon as she can”
On Sunday, he goes to the bookshop, later than usual, having overslept. The muscles in his back protesting every time he moves from all the extra work and lifting, he had to do at the garage yesterday. Being a person down is always a pain in the ass, but two is a whole lot worse.
“No, but it’s not about getting inside a lecture hall and teaching either, that's part of it, a big one. One you should like. However, in order to be a professor and keep being a professor, you need to be published, write papers and reviews that are published in journals that only a small part of the population reads, using far too complicated words and interact civilly with people you’d rather see keel over and die” he continues, then adds. “Don't
and Dean can’t help but swallow and fidget in his seat, something simmering in his stomach looking at the building. His mood changes so suddenly, that he feels a buzz in his head. He frowns, working his lower lip between his teeth and clasping the paper bag in his hands tightly.
“Pies have fruits, and do you really want to talk about
Dean moves his arms as if to indicate that is all and what now, movement self-conscious and stiff, but that’s all he has to offer.
“What do you mean what? Walking away from me.” Ok that's not the best way to word it, but before he can save it, or really embarrass himself further, Cas sends him an apologetic look.
“I’m just going to go in” he says gesturing towards the door and feeling more nervous.
“I can see it. His grace. Holding your soul together.” Michael tells him when Sam has gone to the bathroom.
“Sorry, it’s a sore subject” Dean tells him sighing, trying to appear nonchalant “Our dad used to drag us around”
There is a chuckle behind him, making him turn.
He turns around pushes past Sam and speed walks to his room. He grabs his keys and goes straight to the garage, ignoring Sam’s and Jack’s calls.
“Why?” he knows standing in this street isn’t enough for an arrest.
“Yes?” Sam is looking at him weirdly.
his brain supplies. He shakes his head and focusing back on Novak, who is looking at them expectantly.
"Dean"
They arrange to meet with Michael at a coffee place close to where he is staying and Dean has Sam ask if it has waffles.
“Hello, Castiel. You are here for the young man.” She says it almost like a question and gets up from her desk heading for the autopsy table, where the guy lays naked with a sheet covering most of his body. Castiel follows her and stands at the other side of the table.
He sits on the bar stool and puts on his socks, then takes his phone and the thermos and moves towards the door, where he sits at their bench and puts on his shoes. He puts on his coat and pockets his keys and turns towards him. Dean watches as Oliver stares back at him and then moves towards him and Dean gets ready to put on his gloves, but instead Oli nudges Cas trainers forward with his head.
Dean sighs, placing the sandwich on the plate in front of him. “It’s nothing serious, I-” he looks down at his plate and says hastily, “I’m seeing someone.” Then he looks back at Bobby, alarmed, “No, wait that came out wrong. I meant I’m seeing someone, as in someone professional”
The silence stretches for too long. “Dean, you don't have t-”
“It was about time”
“Ok. Now why haven’t we come here sooner.” He says turning to look at all the delicious food, he is sure he looks like a kid on Christmas morning, but he can’t bring himself to care. The only thing that has been in his stomach this morning, is hospital food. “This place is awesome” he moves and eyes at the stuck of cookies and wonders if they make pie.
He sounds hesitant, tormented.
“So,” Dean starts, “how do I stop being… abrupt?”
It doesn't quite help him, but it makes him feel less alone in this. He offers her a small, tired smile and she returns it, though hers is more genuine and halcyon. Sometimes Castiel hopes he were a more optimistic person.
, came first. And he kind of had to change his schedule a bit for Oli.
Eat overpriced cotton candy that tastes exactly like all other cotton candy, that sticks on your fingers and somehow you get it on your hair and he’d make stupid jokes that Cas would laugh at. And they would find their way to the carousel, that they wouldn’t get on, but Cas loves them and Dean always thought they were boring. And he would dump his shoulder against his, just to feel him, warm – Cas is always warm – and solid and it would play a stupid Christmas song and he would start muttering it under his breath and Cas would look at him eyebrow raised and Dean would start sing loudly and obnoxiously just to see him crack. And they would get disapproving glares from the parents around them and Dean stumbling back to the motel, under the low light and snow falling around them he’d think of how simple it would be to reach over, turn his head and kiss him.
to explain why we don't want to die
They both fall silent. Cas takes a step forward and Dean really wants to shove him out of the apartment or towards his bed he doesn't know. It’s almost too much and then Cas chuckles softly making Dean scrunch his nose. He wants to tell him he is an asshole he decides; instead-
“No,” Michael tells him Dean is surprised at his solemn tone.
“Do you want to come home with me?” Castiel asks with a husky voice.
“Wait, is he here? Your dad?” his skin stings from the sudden change of temperature and he walks faster coming next to Cas, who has a small frown in his face.
“You are not funny” he grumbles half heartily, fighting a smile and settling deeper into the bed and Cas’ side.
Dean is in the kitchen with Miracle when he hears their voices. He is cooking dinner for the first time in more than two weeks, he even went into trouble to find something new to make and stumbled upon a Greek recipe called pastitsio that he knows Claire would like.
gets inside Dean.
“Yes, but you do not go punching people in the face and expect to-. Is this how you are going to go to the interview with Harvard next week? With the shiner on your face?”
“Shut up” Cas grumbles moving closer to him.
“There is a stack of those here” A voice says on his right startling him. He turns his head and sees Alfie standing behind the counter, looking a little awkward and maybe a little terrified. “If you want one” He adds hurriedly.
Cas moves between his legs and opens the bottle of lube, coating a finger. And finally,
He stands there for a long time, his skin red and throbbing and real, until he finally reaches and takes the shampoo bottle Sam has left from last night.
Dean turns to look at him, pleading with his eyes. He sits in the chair in front of his desk, placing his cup on it.
“Castiel Novak” Castiel tells her a bit stiffly.
“Mick” Dean winces a bit, withdrawing his hand from it, as if the photograph burned him. He knows about him, well not knows
That Friday while he is leaving, he stops to read the pin board that is next to the entrance, like he does every time. He finds it useful, it has a lot of interesting things, about events, talks or gigs and stuff like that. It is how he gets informed about most of the things he does, which are almost all the interesting free stuff. A blue leaflet catches his eye. It says “Clinic for all”. He raises his eyebrows and moves a little closer, touching the edge of the leaflet with his right hand.
“I can take it away if you want to.” She continues calmly.
“It’s after twelve,” he shrugs adding, “’sides you are a wilting flower”
“That’s”
“No joke though” Benny starts, “how have you been?”
Michael just sits there in his light grey coat and dark green scarf that he doesn’t need, with a calm expression waiting for the brothers to get over their shock.
“I’ve never seen him before” She says after a few seconds and Castiel nods, he had a suspicion that the man was way too careful, well not too careful, everybody slips at some point.
Dean looks at him in shock and then he smiles. It’s the first real smile Castiel sees and it makes something in his chest flatter. It makes him look younger and carefree. He likes it. He might fall in love with that smile. His thoughts stop at that thought, and he panics. No. Just no. He suddenly wants to flee. Put a hundred miles between them.
“I wasn't going to come” he says in lieu of greeting and eyes Dean, making him feel small for some reason, which ought to make him irate cause how dare he? “But Sam”
“What?”
“I think it can wait, professor”
After a minute he says “That's not help”
He tries to keep his eyes down but after a minute they move to the centre of the lecture hall, where Novak is talking to a student. He is explaining something, while moving his hands and Dean stares, first at his face, which has a small frown – it usually does when he has to explain the same thing in different ways – then briefly at his lips and he shudders softly, before they settle on his hands. They are big and soft but secure and strong, carrying a certainty in their touch and they feel so
Sam looks down at the phone in his hand, he already knows but-
He coughs, because the air is going to suffocate him. “So where is the tea?”
He is pacing back and forth on the road leading to the coffee shop. He reaches the corner, sees the door and then turns around and walks the other way. He has done this four times, its just, it makes him feel like an idiot going to the coffee shop and what? Wait for Cas? Its not like he knows he will show up, the guy has a job.
He feels like he is cheating on Mick.
“What happened?”
He tried not to look, not let his eyes linger, especially when dad was around. He
He watches as Cas shifts from where he is on the other side of the bed, almost uncertainly, insecure and Dean barely holds back a laugh. He shifts towards the center, closer to him, leaving the lube and condom on his side and reaches for him.
He smirks at her and turns to leave saying “Say hi to Missouri from me”
Dean says breathlessly next to his ear, “I wanna ride you”
“What can I do for you?” he shifts slightly in his seat, trying in vain to get comfortable.
Cas squeezes his shoulder again, Dean remembers suddenly how adamant he was on aftercare, he remembers him explaining it to him, who despite his knowledge having grown since before Cas, he was still unwilling on the idea, uncomfortable. But Cas had made it clear, no aftercare no anything. Dean has learned to appreciate it since, seek it, like it as much as all the rest.
It is about a free, walk-in sexual health clinic, that is open every Wednesday and Saturday and it is run by Dr Rowena MacLeod and Dr Missouri Moseley. It says at the bottom that they provide all methods of contraception, as well as screening, diagnosis and treatment for all STDs.
“Nine-thirty”
He splashes cold water on his face a few times, until he feels awake enough. He sees a bottle of mouthwash on the counter and thanks whoever is listening, before opening the bottle and filling the cup, putting the liquid in his mouth. He moves it around for as long as he can and spits it into the sink, rinsing it with water.
“Just to see if you knew him or seen him yesterday around here” He says simply, with a bit of hope in his voice. Dean shakes his head slightly.
Silence
Bobby takes them for milkshakes the second Sunday they are there.
He swallows and licks his lips and after a moment longer he sits up. He spots their clothes from last night on the ground next to him and he has to close his eyes, to get everything under control, there is another set of clothing on the foot of the bed, but he isn’t going to use them. He gets up, hands shaking slightly picking up his clothes and goes to the bathroom.
It’s just that Dean makes things easier, he likes to help others and gets along well with other people, knows how to talk to them, something that Castiel lacks, and he cares a lot, especially about his brother. This Castiel discovered on accident when they saw each other at the library last week. They were talking about The Trial, when Sam slipped into the conversation. He could tell that it wasn't an easy subject to talk about for Dean, but just the way his face lit up when talking about him made Castiel hypnotised. He likes this, he likes to know things about Dean and most of all he likes the feeling he gets in his chest that he can’t identify, but it makes him feel just a little fuller.
“Sure” Dean says “If you turn on the subtitles”
He wants to reach out and touch him so bad, he almost makes a noise of frustration. Instead, he crosses his arms and looks up at Cas “The car didn't even touch me”
Dean does know, she has seen Donna on the street a few more times since his arrest and though their conversations are short, he has come to consider Donna as someone he can depend on in the street. Even if her lively ways sometimes unnerve him, he has never met anyone that smiles so much or is such an optimist.
“Do you want me check it for you?” he interrupts, and Dean widens his eyes at the offer, considers it for a moment and asks.
He walks to class on Friday, and gets his pen out and his laptop, but doesn't turn it on, and doodles on his notebook, so his eyes don't stray to Novak. he doesn't succeed entirely.  But it’s fine because he only catches his gaze once and for barely a second. Still he feels hot all over and he wants all this to be over or for Novak to continue to look at him without that guard in his eyes. Perhaps Dean is self-destructive after all.
He looks like he regrets speaking or like he just realised what he said and then turns his face to stare at the book.
They stay like that for hours, Dean is sure. Until he moves, shivering, across the floor so his back touches the bed and he takes the blanket and wraps it around himself.
In the end he leaves with a heavy emotion in his chest, an appointment for next Friday same time, and an instruction to write what he wants to accomplish here. He feels strangely similar to being satisfied.
Dean stomps down at the disappointment that fills him at the thought and thinks that this lust between them, will go away like all lusts do. He knows the best way is to just fuck it out of him, and since he can’t do just that with the man in question, he perhaps should find someone else to do just that and get it over with. Maybe he should go out with Benny and find someone.
She gives them another tight smile and leaves.
Castiel groans, but his eyes shine happily and there is softens in his feature that make him even more attractive, even if his next words contrast it. “It can’t come fast enough, and at the same time the closer it gets it’s filled with more stress”
Dean hears the interest in Sam’s voice and he wants to flip the table.
“Dean”
He looks over his shoulder, and moves down the corridor, and after a beat Dean follows him. Novak, walks into the room on the left where the light comes from and Dean steps inside as well, stopping sort after he takes a couple of steps inside.
He goes to the left side of the bar, where the sink is and washes his hands from the syrup. He really needs Benny to come back. It’s not that he doesn't like working alone or with the occasional help of Jo, but one, the bar is too big for one person to handle and two, he and Benny have been working together for four years now, they know each other and most importantly they are in tune. And honestly, Dean kind of misses the guy. Yes, he is happy for him and Andrea and their baby girl, their unfairly cute (and so
“Name is Peter Alden, age twenty-six. According to the records he left home about a year ago, his sister reported him missing. He is from Roanoke, Virginia.”
“Well, uh, see…. I, uh” He shakes his head and looks down. “There is no way beating around it” He takes a big breath and looks into her eyes. “I am a worker”
“What?”
He is exhausted, they were busy at work today with five cars towed in this morning, and a couple of others that needed to be finished by Monday morning, meaning he didn’t get a chance to take a break. He feels his muscles ache as he relaxes on the couch and he barely holds back a groan.
“Yeah.” He almost blurts
He looks up at Cas, who is watching him with so much happiness in his eyes and Dean thinks
“No, really I-”
He survives it in the end, thinks it could be worse, not that he can avoid Claire forever, he doesn’t want to anyways.
“Who’s Castiel?” Dean frowns, saying the name slowly. It sits weirdly on his tongue.
Dean groans. “Man, come one I, I-” and now he can’t continue because Cas has pushed his finger in, all the way, making Deans’ breath hitch and he starts to move it. He is careful, Dean notes and warmth spreads through him.
The other man’s lets out a breath, nodding and begins preparing the filter. They are silent as it brews and as Castiel serves them each a cup, and they are silent until they are both half way through their cup, only half glancing at each other when they think the other isn’t looking.
He lets out a breath, “Ok” he clicks his tongue and repeats, “Ok”. Then turns to Castiel, who is watching him waiting.
“They should have just let me go when I woke up. It wasn't anything serious” he says annoyance sipping into his voice.
“Sam has said a few stuff and I sort of read an entry of the diary and he talked to me about it- him” he trails off towards the end uncertain.
“I don’t know man, there was something off. An energy or something.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Is it the vanilla thing? They put it when they were cleaning it last week, it's a little…” Cas huffs and gestures with one hand in place of a word, as he pulls out of the parking lot and into the street.
“Yes” Sam answers.
He curses and gets into the car.
After a few minutes, or hours, when Cas’ eyes are fighting to stay open, and Dean throws him a smirk, earning a rather strong nudge on his calf, he rolls on his back, but makes sure that his legs are still touching Cas’, and turns the light off.
So they head to a diner for a late lunch.
There is a folded paper inside that he takes out and turns over his hands a couple of times. Castiel can see there is something typed in it, but he can’t bring himself to unfold it yet. There is boiling anger inside him and he feels the need to punch something, anything.
He gets up taking his backpack with him, and closes the door with a soft click. She is sitting in her chair, going through some papers and Dean takes a seat in front of her desk.
“Well we have been going out for the past weeks and I thought it’s time for you to meet her” she continues in a rush, voice going a little high.
He runs a hand through his face and sighs. Getting rid of the thoughts. He starts walking again, and this time his mind goes towards Cas, which isn’t that surprising. He thinks about his hands and his voice and something in his chest tightens.
“You need to come look at this.”
Dean will always remember the day he saw Claire in heaven. It was before Jody and Donna and Alex. Before Patience. Before Sam. She died at the age of 35. Drunk driver.
different, if he would have a chance with Castiel. Probably not knowing Dean, he is certain that even in another life he would probably be the same. Not good for anyone. He can’t help but resent Castiel a little too, he knows he feels this way because it’s easier, but still.
“Hello” he says gruffly, raising his bag higher in his shoulder, huffing softly.
He stares at her. “You won’t have a problem. Just say it slow and clear. Here,” she takes the papers from him, grabbing a pen from her bag, “I’ll even write the translation.”
He laughs and she glares at him, “It’s not funny Winchester”
They take a shower together. When Castiel hands reach for Dean’s back, moving to wash him all soapy and slippery, he freezes, taking half a step away, ignoring the hurt in Castiel eyes, that is gone as quickly as it comes. It feels too much, too intimate, too much of something that Dean can’t touch, can’t be. So, they each wash themselves silently and go to lay in the bed next each other.
“I know” she says and slumps back into the chair. “I just can’t believe I have something finally for the guy. More than that, I might actually get him”
“It’s alright.” He doesn’t think he will be able to keep anything down. He intertwines his fingers on the counter, drumming his thumbs together.
As he turns a corner, he sees at the other side of the street an auto shop and it makes him stop. Something about the name is oddly familiar but he ignores it. He is pretty sure he doesn't know anyone named Singer.
to move out”
He looks around and sees a coffee shop across the street, and decides he needs coffee and food, even if it will cost him a little more. Besides, today he has this one john that pays triple for a full night.
“Ok, I’ll come” he chuckles and feels a warmth in his chest.
so after a while I stopped. I was good when I didn't want anything.”
He steps out feeling good, and be- He shakes his head and opens the cupboard beneath the sink hoping that's where Cas keeps his towels and
He takes controlled breaths through his nose and out from his mouth, puts his shirt on and moves to the living room, to put on his work boots.
“I figured you are hungry” it’s his response through a small smile, and then more hesitantly he adds “My brother, Gabriel, he owns a bakery around here. I know it’s not real food, but” he half shrugs, troughing him a sheepish look.
He shrugs at Billie and suddenly feels the anger in his chest at his dad, that is always there and like always he drowns it. He waits for her to say something. To tell him what they accomplish just now with all these.
Dean thinks about Singers’ auto shop for days. He considers going back and asking for a job, but he knows his chances of being hired are slim to none. Besides all he has is a high school diploma and he doesn't even want to think about work experience. So, he goes to the library and works and thinks about Cas.
“Dean come on-”
Dean loves his eyes.
“Fuck me” he says and starts Baby.
It’s early, a quarter to seven, but Sam is up and in the living room eating cereal, watching whatever is on TV, always an early riser. Dean drinks his first cup in the kitchen – in four big gulps, liking the slight burn in his tongue and throat - before joining him, with his second cup, on the couch.
“Violet. Her name is Violet,” Sam says shaking his head going back to reading.
Now though, Dean didn't have Sam to worry about. Well, that was a lie, he was always worried about Sam. But Sam was good. Better than him, and Dean avoided thinking about the now-Sam. It hurt, for way too many reasons.
He moves so his head is resting on the pillows and turns, so he is facing Cas’ side and breaths. He shuts his eyes and feels as Cas massages his scalp.
“Gabriel.”
He holds her tighter.
He watches him leave and turns to go to his office. He likes Victor, he taught him a lot from when Castiel was working with him and Anna. He was a reliable and honest person, something Castiel appreciated. Though mostly he respected him for his work ethic.
“Do we have a name?” he asks without looking up.
“I’m just surprised. Wouldn’t you be?” Sam shrugs, pushing the few pieces of food left on his plate around.
“What are you doing here?” Sam asks him trying to defuse the situation, while sending pleading glances at Dean.
“I don't know, I-” he stops, “I don't know”
He ends up outside of the police station and refuses to acknowledge why or the traitorous feeling that rises in his chest and almost chokes him. He presses it down or fools himself into thinking that he does.
“Why didn't you call?”
He laughs when the door closes and rests his head against the pillows for a moment and just breaths.
He takes a breath seemingly to calm himself and continues “So imagine his surprise when I too was” he pauses seems to taste the word in his mouth before saying “
Dean loves driving and he loves Baby. It is the only real home he has known since his mum died, so watching her parked on the same spot for the past year or so, and looking like a hurricane paraded on her, feels like someone is reaping his chest open. It’s the only thing he has left of his parents and his brother and he can do nothing to fix her. Something hot seamers in his stomach, like acid and it pisses him off, well these past few days everything is pissing him off.
been avoiding him.
“But let’s start from the beginning. He ate three hours before his death and he had sex, penetrated sex, around that time as well. I am guessing after he ate. Then he was drugged, using desflurane, a highly anaesthetic drug. The person that did it used a rag soaked in it. You can see it by the irritation around his nose.” She says and with her hand indicates at the area. “Then, using an injection, on his right arm” She again shows Castiel the spot. “which was a solution of pentobarbital, killed him.” She sighs and shakes her head looking at Castiel. He swallows and tilts his head slightly to the side.
“No, I’m watching The Mummy” he indicates with his head towards the theatre, behind Castiel, who looks at him quizzically.
“Yeah, it’s a beautiful language. At least it sounds beautiful” he grins ironically at her and adds a shrug when she turns her eyes on him.
“Hey, buddy.” The golden just rests the side of his head next to Deans’ thigh and Dean pets him. “We are going, don't worry”
“We don't, its free.”
Castiel frowns, and says with that tone that leaves no room for arguing, “But I am and I want to. I am aware that, that this is only the second time we are doing this but” he sighs “Perhaps now is not the best time to have this conversation”.
Cas shakes his head. “No, I just wanted to ask what do you want to eat”
“You were a child” There is conviction in his voice and a hint of anger and Dean knows it’s not directed at him, still he flinches slightly.
Novak passes him his laptop and pushes his chair back, getting up. He moves around the desk and stops in front of the big bookcase, muttering something under his breath. Dean watches him search for whatever it is he is looking from, while putting his laptop away. He is firmer than he expected, under the layers of the trench coat and the suit jacket; Dean knows he is staring but he can’t help himself, there is something enticing about the way his muscles in his back flex as he moves across the room under the white shirt. And yes, Dean is that pathetic.
When he is out of the office, and Hannah has closed the door behind them, he exhales, closing his eyes momentarily.
Yeah, if he ever manages to make it that far. But he knows what she means. He remembers her last year after Christmas, she was practically a zombie, she just went to her classes, came back, studied until she could no longer keep her eyes open, slept and back again.
“Oh. Why?”
“Nothing, just people are stupid.” She shakes her head disapprovingly. “Would you like full check-up?” She asks with a kind smile, probably the kindest Dean has received in, who knows how long. For a moment he doesn't know what to say. He clears his throat and smiles back at her.
“Can I help you?” Castiel asks in a voice like he is a sales assistant.
“Castiel. How are you?” He asks giving him a polite smile.
“I, uh, no I’m… I’m good” the mans’ frown deepens and looks at him like he thinks Dean is bullshitting him, but doesn't say anything else.
Sam doesn't ask about it. They just talk about the bar, although it’s obvious Dean doesn't want to talk about anything; his mood going from dejected to angry to dejected again. Because it hurts, he liked it, wanted more and it hurts. It hurts hating Cas for doing this too. Even more so since Dean can’t hate him.
“Where did you live before?” he asks, probably a safe question to him.
“It’s a good one,” he agrees “Nature, in his poetry has a lot of faces. It is never-” Dean takes the couple of steps needed to stand right in front of him, in his personal space, effectively cutting him off. “Ok” he says after a second, and Dean realizes he is as nervous and perhaps as unfamiliar with this as he is. Not that he thinks Novak is the kind of person to proposition his students like that. Dean is certain he isn’t.
“Dean…”
Sam sighs heavy and Dean wants to disappear.
“I know I left to do this and you feel the need to help me with all this, but seriously just let me do something for you. To
“There is nothing to be sorry for man” he tells him trying to salvage what he can. When he hears nothing he looks up at him. “Honestly.”
“Dean malnutrition-”
“I also think you are not angry at Sam, like you are not angry at me right now. If you are angry at all”
Dean instantly smooths his expression, his face heats in embarrassment making Castiel lets out a low chuckle before saying
, Sam?” he tries not to make a voice at the words, remembering Billie’s advice, but judging at the look Castiel gives him, he fails.
“And who you might be?”
“It was a gift from Claire”
He doesn't know if he will ask Dean, because he isn’t sure what he dreads more the question or the no that will follow. He just shakes his said and tells her he will think about it and they leave it to that.
Sam wrinkles his nose, “He seems cool”, he shrugs.
“I’m absolutely sure” she interrupts tersely and opens a drawer on her left, taking a paper out. “You can fill the form now, please, as these classes start from Monday and I have to enrol you somewhere”
“I thought you should know.”
Cas just comes up and kisses him. “Naked,” he repeats, gripping at his pants and tagging “Now.”
“What are you doing?” he demands, crossing his arms.
“Ok,” Sam says, then “Oh, before I forget, I’m going to see a movie with Kevin and Ruby after work tomorrow”
“The darkness doesn’t know everything. She had been locked away.”
“I’ll see you around” he adds as he leaves, closing the door behind him and not waiting for an answer. He stops, after he goes down the steps, and reads the leaflet.
“Yes” he nods and Dean laughs. “I don't understand the humor in that”
“They weren’t seeing a marriage counselor.”
He falls silent trying to control his breathing, his heart, that is beating so fast and doesn't say
Cas moans into it and Dean shudders. He is finally able to remove the stupid, still cold from outside, coat and Cas is left with just his white shirt underneath. Suddenly, something comes over Dean, something he can’t name, but he has this need to touch. He starts, at his shoulders going down at his arms, that are around him and when he reaches Cas hands, he squeezes. Then runs his hands back up, and over his back and then down his chest-
Dean glances at Castiel as he starts the car, expecting him to say something but he doesn’t.
“You know someone” Castiels’ voice brings him out of his thoughts.
This time the heart is missing and Dean doesn’t go with them to talk to the husband .
“You don't have a visitor’s tag and people knock before they walk into a room” she says and Dean knows it will be strangulation.
told Cas about how reckless and stupid he used to be, he had to and he wanted to. They go to BDSM clubs sometimes, so of course he told him, just, just not this.
“Dean-”
Dean tries not to think about Claire, what losing him means for her. He know that they had a complicated relationship, but she cared about him more than she would like to       admit. And he knows for a fact how deeply he cared for her.
Plus the mere thought that Cas can feel like that about him, scares him to the bone. He can barely entertain the idea, can barely make it small enough to fit it in his head.
“Ok” he hears him say under his breath and Dean gives him a funny look, but Cas isn’t paying any attention to him or if he does he didn't care, cause he is walking towards the baker and getting inside. Dean rolls his eyes and follows him in.
Dean doesn't know where to start, so he blurts “I missed you”
Cas is slow and thorough, doesn’t stop until Deann is comfortable with four fingers and teases him to save a life. Dean doesn’t know how he knows where to press and how to curl and twist his fingers just right and his nipples are so red and sensitive form all the sucking and biting. It makes Dean breathless and hot and he needs to come. So, when Cas finally,
Michael for his part doesn’t react, he just pauses until the sound stops and continues, “He was holding you…
“Yeah, I do.” And then, because he does love him and he does want him in his life, “It doesn’t excuse me.”
“You know, out of everyone I think she will be the hardest person to tell” he says and nods his head towards Ellen, who is serving a table. “She knows that it’s what I wanted to do for almost eight years, still I have been working here since I was nineteen”
God, it smells like heaven. He looks at the display, and swallows, he could eat everything, like everything in here, even those fruit bars on top of the counter next to Cas. He absentmindedly licks his lips and moves towards him and nudges him with his shoulder.
Dean raises his head and has a moment to look into Cas eyes, before the other kisses him. It takes them a moment to find the right angle and this time he pushes forward until Cas has to take a step back. He cups his face with one hand, running his thumb across his cheekbone and it’s such a soft gesture compared to the way they are kissing, that Dean stutters a breath into it. But Cas doesn't seem to mind, he just lets Dean guide him backwards until he hits the back of the couch and they break apart for a moment.
Castiel wakes with a start eyes wide and panting. He didn't have a bad dream, at least he doesn't think so, but his heart is beating rapidly in his chest. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes, trying to control his breathing.
“They-” he exhales and turns his head at the ceiling worrying his lip between his teeth.
“It’s killing you.” Dean sucks in a breath, closing his eyes momentarily. His tone is placating, even, but Dean catches the desperation underneath it, the way Sam needs him,
In the first half a mile he stops. He has just enough time to open the door before throwing up the sandwich Sam made him for breakfast.
Well trying to say the spell comes first. It’s harder than he thought, words are longer than he expected and his tongue twists around them and they sit heavily in his mouth.
His mouth falls open in half a snarl and his tongue presses against his teeth.
Deans’ eyes widen and then he looks down. Castiel knows he won’t say anything and it’s fine, he doesn't want him to. There are more things he wants to say, but he knows Dean isn’t read to hear them. So, he just takes his cup in his hand and takes a sip from his now cold coffee and looks out the window. He smiles softly at the brown trees and something warm settles in him.
Castiel nods. “Did they send the security videos?”
“Are you ok?” he asks carefully, he doesn't want to make him angry, though he has the feeling that Dean will get angry at any sign of concern from anyone, especially right now.
“Right. Just tell Balthazar to answer his emails for once and that I need the program structure for next semester. Also, there is an emergency and I will leave as soon as I am able to, alright?” he says and she nods at him. He then turns to Dean, “Is it about the lecture?”
“I lost someone and I know what it’s like” He says quietly.
Cas goes to Heaven a day later, because the angels have been insistent that he does. When he tells them Dean doesn’t say anything, just lets Sam handle it because he knows if he opens his mouth they will be having a conversation he is not ready to have, in a way that is not fair to either of them and will probably lead them to being angry with each other. Well, Dean
“I know it is a sort notice and the wedding
Castiel startled looks up from Billies’ latest autopsy report and his notes, sprawled all over his desk and sees Anna in the doorway of his office, smiling at him softly.
he doesn't say.
“Have a good night Castiel” She replies as if sensing his fatigue.
When he gets to Billie that late afternoon, his nerves are on edge and he can’t get his right leg to stop tapping. Billie notices, but just raises her eyebrow at him and he just shrugs.
He pulls back with a sound, and becomes slightly aware of the spit and come running down his chin, but he doesn’t care, he just wipes some off with the back of his hand, trying to calm his breathing and stares up at Castiel, who lets out a long sigh. He pulls himself up on his elbows and looks at Dean, who still feels dazed and he is sure his face conveys it.
“Hello, Dean,” he says once he has finally reach them.
She gets along with Bobby - both grumpy and bitter in their bones - , like two peas in a pod, it’s kind of unnerving to watch at times, still his chest swells with affection every time he sees them.
When Jack says nothing, but it’s obvious he doesn’t agree Dean continues, pushes through the tear in his chest that stings, “The Ma’lak box? That-”
It’s where he finds her sitting at the edge of the bed, sweatpants and loose t-shirt on. She has her head bowed and only lifts it when he closes the door behind him.
Right. He swallows. The irrationality of universe. He finally answers in a gruff voice, after seconds of them staring at each other, “Is it that both Meursaults’ thoughts and the world he lives have no rational order” he doesn't voice it as a question though, and Novak keeps looking at him, in expectation, he doesn't know, he does feel charge though and he adds in a rush, “Society does though. Try to rationalise his actions, like killing the Arab”
“Hello, my name, as you probably know, is Anna Milton, you may call me Anna and I will be teaching you twenty century literature. Some of you are here as a part of your English literature degree and others, you are here because you need the credits. Either way, I expect equal effort and work from all of you.” She moves across the front of the hall as she talks, her eyes surveying them. Her red hair swaying slightly as she walks.
He lowers the glass placing it carefully on the counter and turns to look at her. His right hand going to his pocket gripping the knife there. The shape and weight familiar in his hand, comforting, despite knowing it will do nothing to her.
He sighs, for probably the hundred time today and looks at the clock on the wall of the conference room, it’s almost two. He should probably go grab something to eat.
Dean goes to the bathroom and just before he closes the door, he hears Sam shout “You going out again?”
Castiel opens the canister and using the spoon that’s already inside puts a spoonful in his cup. He wants to ask if Dean has evaporated milk, but he can’t find the strength to ask, so he settles for just sugar. He raises his head to request a spoon to stir the coffee, but before he even opens his mouth Dean gives him one.
They are alone now, Michael and Adam having left two hours ago. When Sam says nothing just continues to stare at him, Dean let’s out a nervous huff of a laugh, opens his mouth to say something but Sam beats him to it.
He hears Cas breathe beside him, his breaths becoming more even by the minute and he is dosing off, when he feels something painful push in his stomach. He grunts, his eyes flying open and so does his hand at the source of pain and he finds himself pushing at something… furry? He hears a hiss and Cas grumbling under his breath.
“Hey” he tells her eventually, “I’m just going”.
“Hannah, could you find me Balthazar and tell him-” he stops abruptly when he lifts his eyes and looks straight at Dean, who stares back at him frozen. “Hello” he tells Dean, his expression carefully neutral.
“The thing going through your head” says Benny exasperated now.
“There’s been a situation. You just need to come to the school. The principle would like to speak with you”
“I’ll drive you” he is finding himself saying and that makes Dean look at him. His eyes widen in panic and he shakes his head, opening his mouth to refuse.
“Mind if I sit?” he asks in a deeper voice than Dean expected and moves to sit anyway without a response.
He takes a breath and puts the phone back in his ear.
“What if- We don’t know why she is doing this.” Sam says eyeing Dean, who looks away.
“Dean, I have no idea what you are talking about,” Cas says slowly, like Dean can’t grasp spoken language.
“Beers are meant to be drank quite fast you know?” the guy continues, “Straight up”
He knows the number of the room, so he just walks in and nods at the guy behind the counter, who just grunts something in reply, waving his hand and Dean resists pulling a face at the smoke surrounding the man’s space. They alternate between cheap and expensive hotels, but Dean doesn’t question it, he learnt not to question things a lot time ago.
“I just. You know how we watched that movie or when Sam made you go grocery shopping” – Dean rolls his eyes – “and I went with you? We were ok then, it was a
But then his entire posture locks up again when the bell rings. Dean jumps a little himself at the unexpected sound, which hurts his ears in a weird way. It’s not even that loud.
Dean sighs, wets his dry lips, pushing his cereal around with his spoon. “It wasn’t about that. It was- I was-” another sigh, followed by him closing his eyes for a moment, “I was being like my dad.”
“Everything looks fine.” She gives him a smile and Dean knows exactly what she thinks and fine, he gets it he hasn't exactly been an easy patient but whatever. And of course everything is fine, because Dean is a dumpass, he wasn't actually-
“Just cut him some slack.”
“I told you I can take care of myself.”
men the same way he likes being held down, that is to say a lot. But there is something about Novak and his piercing gaze that makes him swallow, his throat closing, his skin feeling like he is being electrocuted with a current that's boarding to uncomfortable; he’d know how that feels too.
Dean glances at Castiel finding him already looking at him. He tries to think of something to say, but he comes up empty and it’s about to get so awkward Dean thinks they might suffocate.
,” he says slowly in brittle voice, “you need to take me with you.”
All he hears in reply is a – too dramatic – sigh, which he ignores and puts the bags away. He heads to the bathroom, taking his clothes off and hops into the shower. He feels his muscles relax and he sighs, leaning on the wall. His mind drifting and he starts thinking of Castiel, professor Novak, he corrects, and the muscles at the nape of his neck lock up and hurt. He turns the water off abruptly, puts the flatter in his stomach down to the fact that he is hungry and steps out, drying himself off quickly.
He leans his head against Cas’s shoulder and breaths; the warmth in his chest spreading all over his body and he is burning and drowning at the same time and he needs more of it.
Instead he smiles, and gets inside the car without another word. He is the only one in her car and he is thankful for that. Once they reach the station, they go over the whole process quite fast and then he is inside a cell.
“Hey Jody,” Dean greets her, offering her a weak smile, the words scratching at his throat. They are foreign as most sounds are for him these days, weighty with sharp edges.
“Was full. Anyways everything was good. Don't need to worry your little head about it,” he continues with a shrug.
“Fine.” he exclaims louder than he meant to and Jo grins at him. “But this is the last time until Benny comes back. I mean it Jo”
For a while it was ok, he used the save up money for rent and Sam’s tuition, he could only get so many scholarships, but he soon run out, and no one would hire. Then one night, he saw a guy working and that's how he started. It was bad and messy at first, but then he got the hang of it and it became a routine, an everyday job as long as he didn't dwell on it too much. Sometimes though, it all came to him and he would close himself on the bathroom and scrub himself to death, no matter the water temperature, which always was fucking cold. But those days were rare and as time passed they became even more scarce.
“I don't know” Castiel sighs. He has been turning it over in his head this past week.  “He planned for us to find Bass. Maybe he is just getting cocky. What about you?” He needs to think about something else other than the case or Dean or his life.
“Right” Dean says stiffly.
It's on Thursday evening, when he gets inside the elevator at the library, that he realises how wrong, and perhaps naïve, he is. He was meeting there with a few others for a project in management, which lasted longer than they initially had planned, which through him a bit off schedule. He sighs, texting Sam and waiting for the elevator to reach his floor, it was a long day at work again and all he wants to do is go home shower, eat and sleep.
“What do I do?”
He can feel his face heat up and he shuts his eyes “Shut up”
“Because you had a shiner on your face.” Then he turns back around to Sam “See?”
He doesn’t move, only takes half a breath, continues to stare down at his feet. He bites his lip, not hard enough to bleed, but just enough to feel the pain to remind himself to breathe.
His shoulders drop and he feels calmer or more accurately numb. Then he feels sadness slowly fill his chest. All he can think about is green eyes and how scared and alone and bare he felt that night.
He greets his teeth and curses under his breath.
“Dean?”
“I don't need special treatment. Besides we lived together for years, I know how you are.”
He grimaces, tears prickle his eyes. He thinks how unfair it is, how much they’ve lost. How much Dean and Cas have lost, how much they-
“I am worried for you Dean and I don't want to-”
“Oh” She says smiling. “Mrs Clarke, what a pleasant surprise”
He peels his clothes off slowly, feeling heavier by the minute. He tries to avoid the mirror but with each different layer shed he glances up and away, just enough to make out a blurry image of a person. He finally removes his boxers swallowing, becoming aware of the slight tremor of his hands and before he thinks about it he looks in the mirror again. A second for his face, just enough to make out tired eyes, bruises and dry lips, before he settles on his shoulder.
“Who?” Castiel asks squinting his eyes.
“So”, she starts placing the papers on a stuck on the side of the desk and turning to Dean expectantly, “do you have the forms?”
“Are you sure?”
Suddenly, he is thinking about a garden and people, so many people, dressed in black and his mum saying “It’s the way things are, Castiel. Everybody leaves at some point”. And he remembers his nine-year-old self saying “But it’s too soon” and her replying with a sad smile “It always is”.
“It’s fine. I can wait”
He places his bag on the trunk and then goes to the drivers’ side slipping in his seat and starting the car, pulling out of the parking lot.
“You were the one praying closer, just an hour ago.” Cas says, just a hint of smugness slipping through and Dean kicks him lightly, face burning hot.
He goes in the elevator, smiling politely at the people already inside, and presses the button for the parking lot. When he reaches the floor, he gets out and heads for his car. He is about to get in when he hears Anna call his name. He looks up and sees her walking towards him, she stops on the other side of the car smiling softly at him.
“Don't touch me” he says with not too much heat but doesn't move his arm.
Dean swallows. “Dean” he says, his voice a little rough.
When a woman comes out of the closed door on his left, her blonde hair half falling from her ponytail, she is red faced and looks exhausted but relieved and sated all the same, Dean sighs deeply. She smiles at Dean, the wrinkles around her eyes more prominent. He smiles back at her tightly, and watches her leave, before exchanging a few words with Jessica.
The sun hits his face and it takes him a moment to adjust, then he starts walking down the sidewalk, trying to ignore the lump in his throat.
“Whatever”, he shrugs falling in the couch.
“Honey” Castiel starts, “what have we said about running down the stairs?”
“Why I woke up or why I left?”
“Cause he-”
Later, when they are laying on the bed, Dean buried on Cas’s side, he eyes the lamp on the bedside table with a small smug smile. He needs to replace the light bulb tomorrow.
But in the library, it was a different story, he was just Dean, a twenty-something guy, who read books and was somehow pleasant. He was content with how things were in there. It is why he spends most of his time in that place.
“Hm?” Cas raises his eyebrows in question, as he unlocks the car.
“There is something I need to do before-” Dean moves even closer, and Novak stops again.
Dean watches him walk down the corridor until he turns right and loses sight of him. He finds himself exhale and closes his eyes momentarily. He then hears a sound and opens them to look at Becky, who has an odd expression in her face. He raises his brows in question and she just shakes her head and says something that is entirely lost on Dean.
He crosses the road before he even realises it. He can hear people talking from inside, but he doesn't move, he just continues to stare at the shop, until a man comes at the entrance and raises his eyebrows at him, making Dean take a small step back in reflex.
So, Dean goes at that coffee shop downtown with the shitty coffee, and waits until his phone beeps with a message telling him where to meet
He spends the whole day in bed either reading or browsing Netflix and Amazon Prime. He finally got around finishing Good Omens; he still likes the book better, he texts Eileen as much and she agrees. Then asks him if he wants her to bring him anything, but he refuses. He doesn't want to see anyone.
“Cas”
And it should be awkward between them but it’s not. Ok, it is a little bit but neither acknowledges it. Cas doesn’t say anything and he doesn’t say anything to Cas. Well, Cas gives him these looks sometimes, like he knows what Dean is feeling and possibly more, but they are gone as quickly as they come.
He reads the text and feels his muscles stiffen, he licks his lips and sits up, exhaling shakily. HHHHhe leaves the phone on the bed and walks to the bathroom. The water is not warm, but at least it’s not as cold as it was last week. He washes himself quickly, drying off and on last thought he washes his teeth as well. He avoids looking at himself in the mirror though.
Castiel reaches for the lube and opens it, covering a finger and Dean opens his legs further, raising one knee and he finally touches him. It’s hesitant exploring, almost shy, so Dean presses down, taking it all, as an encouragement or maybe because he is just getting restless. Still, Castiel moves it slowly and for far to long, to the point where Dean knows he is doing it on purpose and he huffs, quip in the tip of his tongue but just then he pushes a second finger in and it dies in his mouth.
“Aren’t you a lesbian?”
"Amara." Then, when Dean continues to look ap at him in disbelief, he explains "It took her longer than she thought."
“Sure.” Castiel says and Dean thinks he looks a bit panicked, but he might be projecting. “I will meet you at the coffee shop”
“I will write down the pronunciation for you.”
He nods his head in greeting, when he sees Lily in the reception talking to a man and she smiles back at him. He moves to the second floor where the literature books are and he starts to browse the shelves, not looking for anything in particular. He hasn't been in the library in a while. He sees a few people sitting at the tables by the windows and he sighs softly, overtaken by nostalgia. A memory of two men sitting at one of those tables, each reading a book the other had chosen, comes to his mind. He presses his lips together in a tight line and continues down the library.
Next Friday finds Dean idly doodling on the margins of his book next or over his notes and half listen to the argument happening at the front of the class. He rolls his eyes at them and sighs. He is far too stressed with everything and far too done with everything. His first psychosomatic in the last year (his most common one) is making its’ appearance; his pinky finger on his left hand is dry and no matter how many times Dean moisturizes it, it stays the same. Billie made a comment and Sam is eyeing it – and Dean - worriedly and Dean wants to tell them is just dry skin, it’s not like it will fall off. He gets it though, they are worried about him; still he doesn't have the time to deal with that now.
Dean swallows, at the tone and words, and turns his head to look at him. They just stare at each other and Dean nods – he doesn't know what for – just barely and leaves.
“Ok” Dean says dragging the word a bit and Novak sighs in response.
Dean wide eyed and dying, shakes his head.
In the end as he walks out, his eyes catch Novaks’ for the hundredth time in the last two hours and he holds it for a few seconds. There is something he wants to say but he doesn't know what and Novak seems to be in the same fate. So, he just swallows thickly and makes the decision for both of them and takes a step back before turning around and leaving, ignoring the slight tremble in his hands that has been going since Novak started teaching today.
“Someone angered her.” Michael rolls his eyes.
It's cold outside, but he doesn't go back in to take his jacket.
“It’s why I like sitting next to them now, why I like big windows and why… why I like to have at least one window open” he continues as if Dean didn't say anything, so Dean says the first thing that comes to his mind.
They reach the landing, and it’s one more flight of stairs. Dean sighs softly, feeling the buzz under his skin and swallows, fingers itching to touch. Cas turns around and Dean raises his eyes and meets his. His breath becomes more elevated and Cas surges forward and kisses him. It’s heady and Dean wants more now. Cas bites his lip and Dean makes a sound at the back of his throat and steps backwards, detaching himself from Cas.
“I’m Mrs Roberts. I’m calling from Sam’s school”
“Hello, I’m Gabriel. And who you might be?” He asks a little aggressively and has a predatory look in his eyes and Dean fights not to roll his eyes.
She makes a sound and says “It is”
“The only reason Becky gave me her phone number is for the seminars on creative writing that the university does. I told her I give some talks and-”
to talk about him, do you understand?” his voice drops and comes out more like a growl.
“What?”
“There is nothing wrong with that Dean” Bobby continues, and then huffs at his stunt expression “I’ve done it too, for three years”
“Amara has some ideas. I do too. And Adam. There has been a lot of damage and we need more angels.”
“Ok” he says dragging the word and throwing the rug somewhere behind him towards the sink.
They sit at a table at the far corner and Dean is stammering down a voice in his head, that almost makes him lose his balance and sounds suspiciously like Sam, telling him that this feels like a date. Which is not, because he absolutely doesn't want it to be.
He mutters under his breath as he walks down the street sipping his coffee, at least she didn't charge him extra for this shitty milk thing.
that Dean forgets what he was about to say. When they pull apart and Novak rests his forehead on Dean’s he repeats himself, “Incorrigible”
He hates mornings, hates them even more with how quiet they are without Cas’. Not that they make noise, usually Cas is up first, makes coffee, then Dean gets up as he finishes the first cup, makes something to eat and something for Cas to eat when he comes back from his run. They drink their coffees together in silence, save of the radio or Oli eating his breakfast, and then Cas’ kisses him before changing for his run and leaves with Oli. They come back about forty minutes later, Cas eat, showers – not always in that order – and gets ready to leave for work. Dean leaves at ten or twelve at noon, depending if he is the one opening or Benny. They see each other at night now that Dean comes home around eight, though not all nights.
He finally looks up and stares at Dean, whose breath is suddenly stuck in his throat. God, is he hot and his eyes are so fucking
Five minutes later, of Sam moving around, he watches him sit on the armchair, with his own laptop and place his legs on the coffee table and Dean has a remark on the tip of his tongue, but instead he asks, “All good?”
All he had gotten was nothing. At some point, he told himself he wouldn’t be waiting anymore, but hope was a persistent, awful thing, that weaved itself into his soul and with time it grew.
He puts on his clothes and shoes in record time, takes Miracle’s ball and tug rope and motions for her to follow him.
“Why?” she crosses her hands over her chest and Dean wants to either flee or strangle her.
Cas grips his hips and starts moving slow and deep, with sharp thrusts that hit Dean prostate and make him stutter and his heart skip a beat. Dean tries to roll his hips, meet him with every downward movement, but Cas grips him tighter and he can’t anymore, so he lies there and takes it, long and heavy. Until his left leg jerks and his thighs tremble and he grips Cas shoulder hard, digging his nails in his skin, and he slides a little on the side, says Cas’s name brokenly, because he can’t, he needs-
He hastily gets dressed, picking up his boots and leaves the room. He descends the stairs and leaves the shoes on the last step, stopping for a moment, but doesn’t let himself ponder too much. He knows the more he thinks about it the more he will lose his nerve. So he follows the sound of cupboards being opened and glass against granite down the hallway.
“You are my true vessel. And it takes a delicacy and precision you are not able to comprehend.”
“Honeymoon?” Cas repeats confused, then “Oh, it’ll happen on Christmas, going to Paris and Brussels”
"I love you so much" he tells him so full of emotion.
Dean sighs. “Well, you going to sit, or stand there like a fuckin’ creep?”
“People aren’t that bad”
“Hey.” It comes out in a gruff and he sits down heavily on the other end of the table from them.
(it meant he wasn't up to their standards but they would give him a shot) and accepted people of
“Not to mention that Cas has quite the reputation” yes, Dean knows, that's what’s worrying him, all those people mooning over him. He has seen it happen and it wasn't pretty “And he is giving a speech, he has a lot to prepare for. So, stop being a whiny bitch,” he adds with a face and Dean splutters.
“You love me,” he says it like a fact, an unmovable truth and all Dean can do is turn his eyes to his and gruff,
“Come on, Dean, I know you are heartbroken-” Dean makes a face that Benny pointedly ignores “- but you can’t keep moping around. Especially about someone you just met.”
He looks away from him, a chill running through him.
“I know what you are thinking” Anna says and he looks up at her. “We were surprised too, but I guess it is because it’s downtown and they want to attract more people.” She shrugs at this and continues “Want to get an eight-slice special?”
“Maybe he needed an out” Crowley says softer than Castiel has heard him in some time. He finds he doesn't have something to say about that, he thought about it, that might not have wanted to stay but only flittingly, it hurt too much. So, he stays silent and after a moment he speaks. “Doesn’t mean he didn't want to stay. Just that he felt he couldn't”
It is like someone has hit Dean in the face with a baseball bat and he is falling backwards waiting to hit the ground and the pain to take over, except it never happens. He goes blank at the words, staring at him remembering how Chuck killed him in the lake.
Dean furrows his brows, before he remembers, “That was you?”
They are both sitting there, Sam with his back to Dean, writing something on his laptop and Cas, with a book open in front of him. He looks up at Dean, sucking in a breath and stares.
“Well Claire I would love to stay and chat with you about Rapunzel but I’ve got to go” he tells her, glancing at her shirt and turns to Castiel, opening the door “Goodbye”
He gets up and out of the shop in seconds. He looks at the station and frowns. This was a bad idea. And the thing he is about to do even worse.
With one shaky hand he fumbles through his drawer, pulling the lube out and applies a generous amount in his hand before reaching and taking both there cocks in his hand. He gasps at the feeling and he has to close his eyes at the overwhelming sensation, he hears Cas moan and feels him arch against him and Dean wants him so much. He opens his eyes looking at Cas face, his mouth half open, eyes closed tightly, brows furrowed lost on the feeling, he is so beautiful.
They are both silent at that Sam trying to understand what’s wrong with Dean and Dean trying to think how all this is going to work out.
He sits on the bench next to a guy he has seen on the street and rests his head against the wall, closing his eyes. He can’t decide if he likes the fact he didn't get to work today or not.
When he reaches it, he stops at the threshold and surveys it. He doesn't know why, maybe it’s because he feels so strange going over some strangers’ kitchen in search of coffee, but he feels as if he is a child caught with his hand in the cookie jar.
knows the guy. But he knows he is pleasant, if not a little weird at times, and enjoys the silence. And if Dean has spent some nights and days thinking about him, who can blame him, the guy is hot. And well it’s just in his head and everything can happen in one’s head. So, he lets himself think, but not too much.
“You know she is…” Anna breaks him out of his thoughts and he sees the sadness and sympathy in her eyes and that she wants to say something, but can’t find the words. He gives her a tired smile. These are the moments he feels his love for her grow.
“You have a case” it wasn’t a question “Well, I just wanted to let you know that you are coming with Anna, Gadreel and me tomorrow, we are going to White Wendigo. Charlie is coming too”
It’s true after a few more thrusts, he is driven into ecstasy, his lips part and his eyes close, through it all he hears Castiel release a groan and he knows the other man is coming too.
small, Dean was scared to hold her) baby girl and he understands Benny needs to be with them and take the two weeks off, but Dean is going nuts here. Not during the busy hours, those he can manage, it's the slow nights that are killing him, where he has none to talk to or joke with. Well he has four more days without him, he’ll manage.
It’s her turn to shift in her seat, her cheeks turning red. Dean raises his eyebrows and she huffs crossing her arms, “Fine, I- you remember Gilda?”
“Medium, black?”
“Good morning” he greets them, “Upon grading your essays, which should be up by this afternoon, I noticed that most of you have troubles with literature devices, so at the end I will go over them again and next week in the first half hour you will write a test on them, ok?” there are groans at his words and he huffs a laugh, “It’s for your own good” he tells them and Dean kind of dreads it, cause he is almost certain he is one of those that got them wrong. He thinks about his schedule and how he can squeeze a few more hours of studying. He sighs, resigned and focuses back on Novak who is analysing Meursault.
Benny bumps his shoulder with his own, as Dean is wiping a glass and he shoots him a glare. “Cheer up, cher”
“He gives the talk tonight?” Benny asks ignoring him.
“I’ll be fine” Dean offers him a big smile, trying to brush it off like it’s nothing. He hadn’t thought about it and his hand goes automatically to his pocket, where his pocket knife is. If Castiel notices the movement, it doesn't show on his face.
He goes back to the windmill three days later furious. He is so angry it fills him to the brim. It’s hot and so sweet in his tongue, fills his mouth and his head until all that he is, is anger. He shouts and curses at him and wants to hate him so much he convinces himself he does. A part of him really does for leaving him like this. Dean only allows it for a few seconds, just enough to let it happen, to go from his mind to his chest to his fingertips, until they tingle for one, two, three seconds and then vanish. Its place takes the hate for himself for feeling this way and then the dullness and fogginess that comes from the pain.
“You sure? Because I really want to rip your heart out.”
“What?” Charlie asks, but he ignores her. He watches as a few cars away Novak goes over to a car. He walks hastily and he can see him talking, more like arguing, with someone over the phone.
“I know” Castiel says quietly, “I just feel guilty”
“Dean”
One night, while he is showering he thinks about them and starts crying under the cold water. He knows he should get out, he is freezing, but he can’t bring himself to move. He just lets the teas fall and hopes to get the words out of his mind.
“I don't care about the money Sam” he interjects, for the hundredth time, and stops pacing, looking at the half-eaten cereal on the table. And he can’t even begin to think of Sam in this
Tom falls next to him and Dean catches on, sitting up. He takes a condom from the bedside table and rolls it on Tom, positioning himself and slides down slowly.
Dean nods, leaves his fork down, and perhaps it’s the guilt for the lie, or everything that’s bothering him lately or that he doesn’t want Sam to worry, and he utters
thinking about Cas.
He swallows opening his mouth to say,
Eventually Sam gets up.
Sometimes it’s as if he feels Cas around him like a blanket and it’s so stupid. He is so stupid.
“Hey, how was it?” she asks grinning, raising her head to look at him.
“Do you ever look at your life and think “how did I manage to make it to thirty two”?”, at Castiels’ frown he continues, “I kind of always thought I’d either end up as a mechanic or in ditch”
“Because I’d like to watch you come apart first” a low, impossibly low voice says and
“Just checking. So, it wasn't you that kicked him out of bed?” he asks amused, with a glint in his eyes and Castiel scowls at him.
Dean takes a hesitant sip, and then another, feeling embarrassed with Castiel staring at him so intently and because he is not stupid he knows what this is, but he also doesn’t need this, yes he got a little emotional but he can handle it.
“It is Rowena” She says and frowns “How so?”
And to no none’s surprise they get nothing, so they are back on square one, just now buried in books.
Sam’s phone rings and Dean sits on the edge of his bed closing his eyes, sipping his coffee.
Anna nods understanding and sympathy clear in her face. “Hey, you have gone a long way. If it was someone else, they might have left the force all together. And you are better, you look better”
He sighs, “Enough, ok? Everything is good, I just-”
Castiel nods towards the right one. Dean pushes up and fumbles around the drawer until he finds the bottle of lube and turns back at Castiel. He reaches for the bottle of lube but Dean shakes his head, opening it, squeezing a good amount on his fingers and positions himself so he is comfortable enough to finger himself open and Castiel is able to watch.
Sam finds out about the bar on Tuesday, and Dean has him promise not to tell a soul and he of course tells Eileen, who Skypes Dean the same night all excited. She picks up on his overall mood and tries to coax him into telling her, but Dean just signs
“I know.” He settles on, the breath he takes hurts so much as if it finds resistance in his lungs, tearing them apart and he takes another sip from the mug. He needs to let go of it, it’s too hot to keep a hold of and he will end up dropping it, spilling it all over himself. He grips it tightly and when his arm trembles from the heat he places the mug on the table.
Castiel’s eyes hold an amusement and he looks more relaxed, which effectively relaxes Dean. “You are going as well?”
“Nightstand” he raps, eyes dragging up to look into Dean’s eyes, who half heartily rolls his eyes.
He is way more interactive than Milton
“She seems great”
He sighs, “I told you I would, why are y- Wait, what’s going on?”
Dean reads the spell and waits.
“Which one?”
In late afternoon he orders a pizza and nibbles at it watching a show that he has no idea what is about, until someone rings his bell. He ignores it. Until they ring for the third time and he sighs, getting up from under the covers, and grabs a shirt and a pair of sweatpants and buzzes whoever it is up. Probably Sam. After a minute there is a knock on his door and he opens it with a scowl, ready to tell Sam off, but whatever he is about to say dies in his throat when he sees Cas stand there. Black coat, grey scarf, brown satchel and all.
She glances at Castiel before her eyes settle back to him, her expression turning mollified, “Dean, Garth will explain everything to you”
Castiel told Crowley about Dean last week and he hasn't been able to get Crowleys’ expression off of his mind ever since. He keeps playing it in his head like he is trying to figure out something, but he doesn't know what. And its not like his expression conveyed something bad, it was pleased, thoughtful, a bit amused and like he knew something that Castiel didn't know and that annoyed him to no end. When he asked him what he thought about the whole situation, what he got in response was vague and that he was glad that Castiel had met someone knew and was making friends.
The rest of the drive passes in a familiar comfortable silence and Dean basks in it. He is relaxed and has a barely there smile, he feels content and full, with a sense of security, something he always feels next to Cas. It’s like letting the sun shine in your face after a period of clouds and he is being oversentimental, but fuck it, his emotions are all over the place lately he can enjoy a moment of peace. Cas is next to him tapping his fingers on the steering wheel lazily, absentmindedly, half listening to the song at the radio and Dean has to consciously look away after every few seconds. It’s pleasant, everything blur together and before long they turn down a street Dean doesn't recognise, no surprise there, and the car slows down, until they reach the front of a house. It’s a nice, standard suburban american house, big and white, with a fucking
“I don't like fries.” He repeats then adds with a grimace, “They are oily and soft or crunchy and they just taste like-”
He lowers the phone from his ear and licks his lips. Hands shaking. Last time he got a call like that, some jackass had push Sam down the stairs and he had a splint wrist, seven stitches on his head and a concussion.
“Yes, he is” Castiel says rolling his eyes. “I’ll walk you out” he exits the kitchen without another word, expecting Dean to follow him, who does but not without shrugging at Amelia’s shock face.
“Then why are you hurting yourself for that?” she reasons.
“No” he shakes his head, “Not at all”
“It’s not that cold” he lies petulantly. It is the end of November and Dean is dying. He can’t handle the cold well. Thank god though for Eileen and her nice gifts, the black coat from last year is great, even if he was a little reluctant to wear it.
The night before his first day he contemplated getting drunk to ease his nerves and forget for a few hours, but Sams’ excited face when Dean enrolled coming to mind had him stop and go back inside their apartment and try fruitlessly to sleep.
“It’s my favourite, out of the three” Castiel says smiling and feeling more relaxed himself. This was something he could talk about.
“Yes” he says shortly, frowning and going to the passengers’ seat. He sits down and can’t help but fidget. Gog it’s so fucking-
“Yeah I noticed. How are you?”
"I love you" he says and looks up at him.
They are silent after that, Dean resumes browsing the shelves and Cas opens one of the books and sits in the chair behind the desk. Dean finds Fahrenheit 451, and even though he has read it two times now, he reasons a third isn’t going to hurt. He picks it up and turns seeing Cas engrossed in the book he is holding. He is just barely mouthing the words, like he always does, he looks peaceful and content. He, despite his absolute denial in the matter, lo-
“Homicides, been tiring you?” Victor says with a teasing smile.
Castiel doesn't know what to say and he just picks at his cup.
“She is sick” Alfie says and Dean nods again.
and Amanda cuts in offering to show them. Sam moves with her and looks at Dean expecting him to follow, but he stays put nodding at Michael to go with him instead. He ignores Sam’s disapproving face and Michael’s frown and as if to drive the point home takes a seat on a stool bar across from Esme.
His eyes widen and he feels a sudden panic raise in his chest. He looks at Crowley like he has grown three heads. He in return looks back at him patiently, like he is waiting for Castiel to get over it.
“I’m not going to like this, am I?” he asks already knowing the answer. Crowley just goes over to his desk and opens a drawer getting a large paper out and crayons and turns to Castiel smiling. And yeah out of all the exercises drawing is his least favourite. He needs to remember next time not to choose a psychotherapist, that has also studied art therapy.
“Nice name.” she says looking at him curiously, Deans smile freezes at the way her gaze changes to appreciatively and slightly flirty “Angel of Thursday”
Inside it’s warm and the air smells of nutmeg and clove and bleach and it is chocked with grief.
looked when dad was around, never gave an excuse.
They make it two steps up, before they stop, realising they can’t climb the stairs while kissing. They are a step away from each other, catching their breaths. They move three more steps and Dean stares at his feet and thinks maybe he shouldn't be doing this.
He squares his shoulders and walks into the kitchen. Amelia turns at the sound and narrows her eyes at him momentarily before she gives him a calculative stare, that he chooses to ignore.
He is out before the doors have fully opened and he almost runs on a person, but he doesn't stop until he has reached the area where the officers’ desks are. His eyes move to Donnas’ desk and sure enough Dean is there talking with her. He is smiling and gesturing with his hands as he says something to her that makes her laugh and all Castiel can do is stare, breath caught in his throat.
