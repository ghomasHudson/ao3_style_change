“Go shower and I’ll make you something to eat. You’re terribly underfed and I can practically smell you from here. Bathroom is right there—first door on the left. Towels are on the rack.”
Cas continued to suck Dean off, bringing him right to the edge of completion over and over. Each time Dean got close, Cas would pull off, loosely stroking Dean’s cock as he rose to place soft kisses all over his body.
Cas leaned in once more, stopping to look Dean in the eyes. “Relax, Dean,” he said in an undertone.
Dean turned back towards Cas, addressing him sarcastically. “So, when are they coming for me? How long do I have to live?”
A beat passed before the Nazi spoke. “Who’s this, your secretary? Where’s the baker?”
Dean smiled almost imperceptibly and lowered his head shyly, examining his pants as if they were the most interesting things in the world. “I like being here, too,” he told his lap, “but I don’t want to be a burden.”
Gathering up every last bit of strength I possess, I force myself up for one last shot. I have to do it. I haven’t worked this hard only to fall short by such a small amount.
The knocking sounded again, this time catching both men’s attention. Dean and Cas fell silent, staring at each other. Cas tilted his head in confusion, wondering who would be knocking at this time of night, but Dean looked petrified. Cas came to his senses a split second later.
Dean shuffled over in his socks and sat down lightly in the same chair he had occupied before. Cas took the seat adjacent to Dean, handing him a beer and his plate of food before popping the lid off of his own bottle and taking a long sip. Dean simply sat there, eyes wide in disbelief as he stared at the food in front of him.
When Cas returned to the kitchen, Dean was once again hovering outside of the bathroom, looking awfully out of place. Dean looked quite endearing in Cas’ clothes, his hair still drying from the shower. Cas was reminded of a scruffy puppy. He smiled warmly at the taller man, raising the beers and motioning Dean over to the table.
Nonetheless, Gabriel’s suggestion had planted an idea in Cas’ mind that he couldn’t quite shake. Conflicted, Cas found himself entering the basement for the first time since that fateful night when Dean had gone. Upon seeing the room, Cas sucked in a breath. Everything was exactly how he had left it four years before. Not wanting to touch anything and mess it up, Cas sat on a box and considered his options. What if he did go to look for Dean?
When he was finished, Alastair used the clean part of Dean’s back to wipe any excess come off of his cock before tucking himself away and buttoning his pants. He then walked out of the kitchen, whistling, leaving Dean to catch his breath on the kitchen table.
The man dug around in his pocket before placing the bronze coins on the counter. He took a seat near Cas, opening the bag immediately. Cas could see that this man was a Nazi soldier, which made it all the more amusing to see him with powdered sugar around his mouth. Much to Cas’ delight, the Nazi seemed to be enjoying the baked treats a lot. Jo had made that particular batch of
I shoot my landlord a dirty look. “Crowley.”
It was snowing quite heavily but that didn’t stop the Nazi guards. Sammy and Dean had both been assigned to manual labour that day, while Benny was tasked with factory work. After a long day of back-breaking labour, Dean could see that Sammy wasn’t looking too great. The trio collected their evening ration, a roll and some watery soup, and found a place to sit by a snowdrift that had collected on the stoop of a building. Concerned about the young boy, Dean ripped off a small portion of his own roll and gave it to Sammy, who accepted it gratefully. Sammy had learned not to refuse Dean and Benny’s kindness, as it was probably the only thing keeping him alive.
Heart racing slightly, Dean walked into the alleyway next to Alastair’s house. It looked mostly the same, save for a few new bins and, obviously, different garbage. He grabbed a discarded newspaper to check the date. Over a year had passed since Alastair had found him. Dean kept going. The alley let out onto a smaller, empty street and Dean continued walking, darting through alleyways whenever he had the chance.
Shit, I’m gonna need some beer to get through tonight.
This was, apparently, the wrong thing to say. Dean’s eyes widened, terrified, and his face ran pale. “He's gonna find me. He told me he would find me, no matter what.”
Dean would still tense up when Cas touched him unexpectedly, but it was less and less each day. Their kisses were still soft, hesitant, and exploring. Though they never had discussed it, Cas understood that Dean didn’t allow people to touch him all that often. Cas knew how lucky he was to have gained Dean’s trust in that regard.
Cas lived alone, miles away from the rest of his family. He had a large extended family, comprised mostly of Nazis and Nazi sympathizers. Cas’ cousin Lucifer was a high-ranking SS officer in close proximity to Himmler himself, and, despite being a few years older than Cas, the two had been practically inseparable growing up. Lucifer, despite some of his faults, had always been good to Cas, keeping him safe and consistently having his back. Once they had matured into adulthood, the cousins hadn't had the opportunity to hang out as frequently, but Lucifer did come over on occasion to catch up. Cas appreciated Lucifer, even if he disagreed with most everything his cousin stood for.
“Cas, right?” the boy spoke excitedly. Cas noticed his accent; a mixture of German and something else that Cas couldn’t quite place.
“I’m going to go take a shower,” Cas told Dean.
Dean and Benny had it bad, sure, but it was nothing compared to Sammy. The thirteen-year-old was small to begin with, not to mention after almost a year in the camp. The two older men were constantly worried about Sammy’s well-being, giving him their extra food whenever they could spare a bite and helping him with his work when possible.
I hum noncommittally. Fun is one way to put it.
Cas cautiously opened the door to find a man standing on the doorstep in dirty clothes, looking around furtively with wide, scared eyes. Wide, scared eyes that just happened to be the most striking shade of green that Cas had ever seen. Cas was certain he had never seen the man before, but he looked to be in trouble. It quickly dawned on Cas that the man might have been a Jew or someone else hiding from the Nazis. That didn’t, however, explain what he was doing on Cas’ doorstep in the middle of the night.
Bobby’s eyes narrow, “She knows about the job?”
Dean decides right then and there that Claire is his favorite seven year old in the world.
The angels have vacated the Earth and returned to Heaven, Crowley says on a visit to update them. They’ve given up trying to free Lucifer and he himself has taken over Hell. He thanks them for their help and tells them that they won’t be bothered by his demons and neither will Dad, Sam or Bobby. He says he’ll call if he ever needs a favor, and they should do the same and then he’s gone.
--------------------
Cas just straightens up, eyes studying the three, “Zachariah, Hester, Inias. I wish I could say I’m glad to see you.”
I also got a 31 on my reading portion of my ACT and dual enrolled in college B) (I am the coolest 16 year old to ever grace this planet!!!!)
He’s in some abandoned building in New Mexico, he tells them. He’s torturing demons for
Crowley pops in occasionally to give Cas and Dean some information, but this time is different.
--------------------
He’s been taking small hunts, nothing he can’t handle alone. He texts Sam every three days, but his brother never responds with more than five or six words, and Dean contemplates just leaving him alone because it’s starting to feel like that’s what he wants.
Dean smiles, “I’m good, man. Really good. I never thought I’d want to be… normal. Hell, I never thought I’d make it to twenty three. Hunters don’t exactly have an award winning life span, you know?”
tell them Bobby, please don’t tell them. I’ve got one more job and then I’m gonna tell them myself.”
Dean wishes he hadn’t asked.
They’re in the car when Castiel first suggests it,
Cas nods, “And she asks…
OH MY GOD IM BACK????
Sam gets a visitor and Jess meets some new friends.
Cas is sitting next to him now, and Dean collapses into him, hands grabbing at his coat in tight fists. He thinks he’s crying, but he isn’t sure. His face is warm and Cas is hugging him back, whispering words of reassurance.
Dean calls Bobby once a week and lets him know how they are. He doesn’t tell Bobby that he hasn’t tried to contact Dad and Sam yet. He doesn’t think he’s ready yet, he just wants to get settled in with Claire and Cas.
-------------------
The man looks upwards towards the sky, concentration engraved into the lines of his face, “My apologies, it appears my time here has been cut short. I’ll be seeing you soon, Dean.”
Then the group is attacking and Cas lunges for the other man, the one standing opposite the woman, pushing the blade through his chest. His eyes and mouth glows bright and hot, like light bleeding underneath a doorway from a locked room. He falls backwards, and the other man drags his own blade acros Cas’ arm in a swift sweep. Cas is jumping into the passenger seat and Dean is slamming on the gas pedal.
The woman’s face is absolutely livid, and Dean isn’t sure how he feels about being on the receiving side of her wrath.
Surprisingly, he does.
“Dean?”
Sam gets a visitor and Castiel makes a reveal.
He nods curtly, his hands folded in his lap, “Of course. I’ve been sent to accompany you until such time as you are needed, at which point I will tell you why it is we need you.”
Cas and Dean have been hunting together for a month.
And maybe deep down it is.
They go to Georgia, because Dean doesn’t think he can ever go back to Kansas and he’s always enjoyed the beach anyways. Dean gets that stupid cast removed because luckily Cas healed the break when he healed the hellhound ounds. They stay in a motel for a few weeks while Dean and Cas find jobs and Claire gets enrolled in the school system. Cas changes his (or rather Jimmy’s) legal name to Castiel, because he doesn’t think that he can stand hearing his vessel’s name and neither can Claire. Dean gets a job as a mechanic in town, and Cas finds work at a second hand bookstore. He doesn’t tell Claire, but he’s been looking into going to the pet store downtown to get her a puppy for her birthday. God knows she deserves it.
“In simplistic terms, yes I suppose so.” he replies, “You don’t have to if you don’t want to, though. It's merely a suggestion.”
They sleep in the same bed when they get to the motel.
? Are you reading tabloids?”
Dean and Cas make a stop.
(See the end of the chapter for
But I digress!! I've taken the time to write more chapters and I'll finally be able to update again for real this time!
Dean knows it is.
Bobby nods, rubbing his temples because he already knows Claire is going to be a handful, “Yeah. I’ll play babysitter, Dean. You better come back here soon as you’re done, boy, or I’ll kick your ghost’s ass so hard you’ll be right back in the land of the living.”
“Hi,” Dean smiled back at Cas, intertwining the other man’s fingers in his own.
When he finished, Cas looked over at Gabe, trying to gauge his reaction. Much to Cas’ surprise, Gabriel started to laugh. A small chuckle grew into a full blown laugh, Gabriel wheezing as he wiped tears from the corners of his eyes. Cas failed to see what was so funny, and he told his brother as much.
It may not have been the prettiest pie Cas had ever made, but he couldn't remember ever having that much fun while baking. And though the recipe hadn’t changed, baking it with Dean made it taste that much better.
Alphabet City is never a pleasant place to be, least of all in the evening. As if to prove my point, a man wolf-whistles from his spot on the sidewalk, most likely at some unsuspecting girl. Those animals. They’d fuck a horse if it stayed still long enough and they’d pay good money for it too. It’s downright feral.
“I crossed a line. It won't happen again, I promise.”
As the time neared seven in the evening, Cas began closing up shop. He served the last few customers in line and began wiping down empty tables, hoping to get home as quickly as possible after closing. At seven o’clock exactly, the last customer left with her toddler in tow, the latter clutching a large, chocolate chip cookie. Finally done for the day, Cas locked up the bakery and began his walk home.
July 15, 1937.
Damn, four
Cas sat down on the box behind him, his face blank in shock. Dean hadn’t meant to leave for good; he was waiting for Cas to tell him it was safe to come back. Cas finally understood and he felt terrible. It was all his fault. Whatever situation Dean was in at that moment, it was because of Cas.
“As of yesterday, technically, yes. But I got it for you,” Cas explained.
,” he growled into Dean’s ear. “Now everybody will know it.”
Cas prompted the other man again, firmly but not unkindly, “What, should I say it in Spanish? Go!”
Luckily, if any of the officers thought something was suspicious, they kept to themselves. It would seem that their love for jelly donuts was prioritized before their duties to their
that morning, and it gave Cas joy to see how well she had learned the trade.
Dean rolled his eyes, folding his arms like a petulant child. “I heard enough.”
Cas shook himself out of his trance, stepping to the side to let the man in. “Of course, where are my manners? Please come in, Lucifer.”
Cas tried to relax himself as he leaned all the way in, his lips meeting Dean’s. Cas kissed Dean softly, breathing in the delicious scent of his (really Cas’, he supposed) shampoo, and Dean reciprocated, kissing Cas back slowly but intently. Cas’ hands found Dean’s shoulders, his fingers gripping at the short hairs at the base of Dean’s neck. He and Dean fit so perfectly together, like two adjoining puzzle pieces. It was a weird feeling, Dean’s stubble brushing gently against Cas’ jaw, but it felt so right. Logistically, it wasn’t really that different from kissing a girl, but Cas knew that no kiss with a girl could ever feel as good as this one did.
Cas was going to give his cousin a piece of his mind. Or maybe a piece of his fist. What had happened to “family first”? Having dismounted the train in his cousin’s neighborhood, Cas stalked towards Lucifer’s house in a fit of rage. He could feel the adrenaline coursing through his veins, clouding his judgement, but he really didn’t care. Cas wanted to take his emotions out on someone. He wanted to cause someone else the amount of pain that he felt.
Lucifer waved off his thanks, reminding Cas that it was only because they were family. Lucifer stood to leave, wishing Cas much luck and telling him to keep in touch. They exchanged a short hug at the door, and then Lucifer was gone. Cas collapsed against the door as it closed behind the other man, utterly exhausted. There was no way of knowing if Lucifer would keep his promise or not, but Cas hoped to any and every god in the heavens that he would.
Even once Cas had gotten back on his feet, he didn't contact Balthazar. The British man was too much of a reminder of what once was. Besides that, Cas knew Balthazar would have questions; questions that Cas didn't want to answer. Cas didn't really want to talk about Dean anymore.
“I know,” Cas said hastily. “I just want to make sure you want this.”
Cas stepped back to let Dean enter the house, then quickly shut and locked the door behind them. He was glad he had closed all the shades earlier. If this man was on the run, it wouldn’t do to have neighbours looking in on them.
Dean’s blood ran cold. His heart began thumping loudly in his ears, drowning out all other noise. He felt like he was going to vomit. Dean staggered down the stairs, having heard enough. He couldn’t listen anymore.
The man continued, “Would you look at that! I caught myself a little fairy! What should I do with you, fairy?” he mused to himself. “I could turn you over to the Gestapo, but where would be the fun in that?
If Dean held to their plans, Cas should’ve been getting some action within a few days. He was prepared; Cas had gone out to purchase some essential supplies for the occasion, specifically, a tub of vaseline gel for lubricant. Cas knew how important lubricant was, and he hoped Dean would appreciate Cas’ preparations for their night.
Dean tensed up, looking at Benny defensively and sadly. “I bet you’re re-thinking being friends with me, right?”
The man pulled Dean to his feet by the collar of his shirt and looked him up and down contemplatively, as though Dean was a prime slab of meat at the butcher shop. “Yes, you’ll make a good toy, won’t you, you little twink?”
Dean shifted uncomfortably. “Castiel,” he said carefully, trying to gauge Benny’s reaction.
“I struggled with Dean’s death for a long time. Even long before I knew he was dead, back when he had just left home, I think part of me knew. I didn’t want to accept it, but part of me knew I would never see my love again. And that hurt. It hurt real bad. I couldn’t understand why the world—God, no God, whatever—would take someone so perfect; what I had done to deserve him being taken from me. There’s no way to justify a death as unnecessary as Dean’s. How do you come to terms with something like that?
Alastair pulled Dean’s pants down to his thighs and spit on his own fingers before shoving two inside Dean at once. “You see,
Cas picked up his hat and tan trenchcoat from the stand by the door and walked outside, locking the front door behind him before beginning his short trek to work.
When his food was ready, Cas began to look for Dean. There were no dishes in the sink, so Dean clearly hadn’t eaten yet. Cas first checked the living room, to see if Dean had fallen asleep reading a book on the couch. He hadn’t. Cas then ventured into their bedroom. It wouldn’t have been the first time Dean had fallen asleep before eating. One quick sweep of the room, however, told Cas that Dean was not present.
“I’m not lonely,” Cas rolled his eyes, grumbling. “And I have no problem with you visiting, it’s just that you haven’t been to my house in, well, years.”
Cas mentioned his correspondence with Balthazar, the rebel who had accidentally given Dean Cas’ address to begin with. Dean blanched slightly at the name, a reaction which Cas did not overlook. Cas inquired what was wrong and Dean answered hesitantly.
Trigger warnings for this chapter:
Gabriel had come to visit once again, and the two men were sitting in front of the radio as reports of missing persons played one after another, families trying desperately to reunite with their loved ones.
Dean wanted to have faith, but it was so hard. He would have given up already if it hadn’t been for two things, or rather, people: Cas and Sammy.
When they finally broke away for air, Dean and Cas simply stared at each other, their breathing labored and their foreheads pressed together.
Thank you for reading! Let me know what you thought!
Dean’s face flushed an even deeper shade of red. “The other kids always made fun of me for my freckles as a child. Apparently, freckles are not ‘Aryan’ enough for Germany.”
Cas stepped off the train, every inch of his being wanting to turn around and go home, but he knew he had to do this. Taking a deep breath, Cas began walking towards the entrance of the makeshift camp.
“Well, well, well, what do we have here,” he asked in a nasal, malicious voice. “Are you a dirty Jew? No, you’re
Dean couldn’t help it; tears began to fall from his eyes, landing one by one on the smooth surface of the stone at his feet. “I miss my angel so much, Benny. I love him.”
As politely as possible, I excuse myself from the conversation and duck outside. Maybe a walk will give me an idea of what to do. At the very least, it’ll clear my head.
Cas fiddled with the tuner on his kitchen radio as he sipped his morning coffee. He liked to listen to the broadcast each morning to hear what was happening in the world; the radio was often much more reliable than the newspapers. Cas also listened in order to hear other news, the news that the papers wouldn’t report. More specifically, any news that was not Nazi propaganda.
Cas watched as Dean’s face cycled through emotions, incredulity, disbelief, questioning, and finally, hesitant acceptance. “Yeah—yeah, okay,” Dean exhaled.
Luckily, Dean didn’t care.
Dean bent over to retrieve the broken pieces of stone, but stumbled forward as the guard used Dean’s vulnerable position to whack him across the ass with his baton, hitting his face on the stone instead. “Come on, fag, I thought you liked it in the ass. You liked that, didn’t you?”
When Dean was fully asleep, Cas got up slowly as not to disturb him. Cas turned off the radio and pulled the blankets over Dean, tucking him into the bed as best he could without waking him. “Goodnight, my love,” Cas whispered softly, before heading upstairs to his own room.
Dean couldn’t answer, his throat was so raw and abused. The man seemed to take his silence as assent, though, because he dragged Dean inside the building he’d been resting against. It turned out to have been the man’s house.
Cas jumped to his feet. If he was hosting, he was going to do it right. Amelia Novak didn’t raise her boys to be ill-mannered. “No. You're not wearing that! The clothes are the dirtiest part. Wait here, I'll get you something better to wear.”
Lucifer grinned, ignoring the sarcasm. “Great! Now that we’ve got that cleared up, I’ve got one more question for you.”
Dean let out a deep groan at the feeling, his eyes fluttering shut as Cas stroked up and down his hard length. It had been so long since someone had touched Dean like that, and he’d be damned if he wasn’t going to enjoy the feeling.
It was a new year, the start of a new decade, and the world was just getting worse every day. At home, however, things were looking up.
“Winchester . . . Dean Winchester?” the green-eyed man supplied. The questioning tone in which Dean said this made it seem like Cas should recognize the name, but Cas was drawing a blank. Was this man famous? Why would Cas know who he was?
Cas didn’t have many friends in the town, so to speak, but he didn’t have any enemies either. He generally preferred to keep to himself. In the past, Cas had found that drawing attention to himself never ended well. That wasn’t to say that Cas was impolite to his neighbours, though. Cas tipped his hat whenever he passed an acquaintance in the street, and he made small talk with the nice old lady next door if they ever happened to be outside at the same time. He’d even brought her fresh bread one time when he heard that she had sprained her ankle climbing the stairs.
“Your freckles,” Cas murmured affectionately.
,” he decided. “I think I’ll keep you.”
“What are you doing?!” Dean looked up to see the
Dean waited a short while before leaving the house, letting the other inhabitants of the area leave for work before he ventured out into the unknown. Dean knew it was risky to leave in broad daylight, but he’d weighed his options and had decided that it was better to risk that than to face Alastair again.
Arriving at home at last, Cas shut the front door and collapsed against it, utterly exhausted. Dean, having heard the sound of the door opening, ventured into the front hallway. Cas acknowledged his partner with a chaste kiss on the cheek, wanting nothing more than to relax with a hot shower. And his lover. A hot shower, then his lover. Or . . .
It’s not easy, I’ll be honest, but damn if it isn’t remarkably profitable. My sock drawer is filling up pretty quickly, almost overflowing with bills at this point. There must be hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars already and I’m only a few days in. I’m not sure whether to be proud or ashamed that I’ve made so much money so quickly.
“It’s your birthday. You’re going to have a good time even if we have to force you to.”
“Sounds perfect!” Jo laughed and then look at Cas once again. “So what is your sister up to in Illinois?”
“Any time!”
“I guess there are some perks to small town weddings.”
“Get lost for a moment there, soldier?”
“Oh, yeah!” Dean laughed, breaking the tension he had unwittingly created. “Yeah, no, Sam is tops, he’s alright with the whole thing. He was yanking my chain... Apparently I smile when I talk about you.”
“What time is it?” Dean muttered, seeming to take stock of where he was and what was going on. Castiel smiled.
Dean arrived home late the night before and went straight to bed after greeting everyone. He slept well into the morning when he was woken by the smell of cookies baking. Stumbling out of bed, he padded downstairs to find his mother in the kitchen. Christmas time meant all sorts of delicious foods and baked goods in the Winchester house.
Dean and Sam shared a smile. They all loved Jess and thought of her as part of the family already. It was only a matter of time before they were married, whenever Sam got the gumption to ask for her hand. Everyone knew she would say yes. Sam met Jess when they were juniors in high school. After spending nearly the entire year tutoring her in history, he finally got the nerve to ask her out on a date. They went to the county fair, he bought her ticket and an ice cream, and they had been sweethearts ever since.
“I just have something to say before we eat dessert...”
“Good! Yeah, real good, actually. I got to relax for the first time in forever,” Dean chuckled. “I got a little stir crazy, but there are worse things.”
“Long,” Cas chuckled, bending down to pick up his bags again. “Is your home far?”
“Who is to say that we would truly cross paths on the battlefield? Who’s to say that we will even join this war? But any time I look down at soldiers on the ground, I will remember they are men like you, like me, with families at home, dreams of a better future, fighting to protect the children here at home.”
“Seems to me you’re risking that already.”
“Yeah?” Dean raised a brow.
Dean laughed at that cocky response. Just then the music changed, the upbeat swing songs were replaced by a slower, smoother dance. Dean recognized it as “Moonlight Serenade,” a cheesy song for lovers to sway on a dance floor. Men led their ladies out onto the floor with flourishes and pulled them close in their arms and Dean frowned impassively at them all. A couple of girls stood nearby, giggling and giving each other little pushes towards the small group of military men. They were pretty things, but Dean didn’t like where this was going. He cast a glance at Novak, who seemed oblivious.
“Are we gonna have one of those heart-to-heart brother moments now?” Dean despaired.
“Yeah, well, I hope they’re looking out for me when I’m on the battlefield, eventually.” Dean laughed, keeping the subject light. “What about your family? Your name is sort of ... religious-sounding.”
“At first I was upset with myself, then I realized... I only went because it was expected of me. Sometimes I pray for guidance or direction when I’m uncertain of myself, but I got very little out of listening to the preacher’s sermons every week, especially concerning certain subject matters.”
“Can they travel that far?”
Conversation then turned to more mundane topics, the weather, what everyone did that day, Cas’s ride on the train and other such things. As dinner ended, Jessica and Mary began clearing the table.
They finally made their way to bed and stopped at the edge of it. Dean had a full size bed in his small room. The cot was slim and low to the ground, placed just on the other side of the bed from the door; it would likely go unused for Cas’s entire stay. While the bed might be a tight fit, there was no way they would miss the opportunity to sleep together. Yet, they paused now, despite their apparent need for each other.
“In a manner of speaking,” Cas shrugged. “I had a question, actually.”
Dean kicked her chair but she just flashed a toothy grin at him and said nothing.
Out on Michigan Avenue, Dean gestured for Castiel to lead the way. He took them south around the campus of Northwestern University, then East towards the rising sun and Lake Michigan. Despite the early hour, people were out in their finest clothes; women were about with shopping bags, men were smoking cigarettes and talking to friends, families were going about their business. The students from the university were nowhere to be seen, presumably asleep on their morning off. A few servicemen were on the streets in uniform, perhaps out on leave, just as Dean and Cas were. They both smiled and nodded in greeting.
“A fair point.” The concession was worth it for the way Castiel looked at once shy and mischievous. It was odd to see any hint of shyness in Cas’s face; the man always appeared confident and somewhat aloof. But in private moments, sometimes Dean could spot the look on the Lieutenant’s face and knowing that he put it there was all the better. “And, of course, last night counts as well.”
“So, Cas, tell us about yourself,” Mary started.
Not wanting to miss the opportunity, Cas leaned in and kissed Dean, soft and tender. Dean wrapped his arms around Cas once more, holding him tight again. There was something wonderful about that hug, the way Dean rested his weight on Cas, letting the pilot support him. It was vulnerable and trusting. Cas wouldn’t give up that feeling for anything.
“Until tomorrow, then,” Novak said finally, stepping backwards to walk away.
“Your sister must be a fantastic woman, then. Is she here?”
“Yeah, well... same to you, bub.”
“You should tell them that. I’d be glad to show them a thing or two.”
The three of them remained at the table together, talking and commenting on the reception for most of the evening, until it was time for the wedded couple to say their goodbyes and drive off. Their car had been decorated with cans attached to strings and a sign of painted cardboard that read “Just Married” on the back. Cas had never seen that sort of thing in person before, only in the cinema. The weddings he typically went to were much more reserved than this one.
“Yeah. Sit down,” Dean pointed to the bench and Castiel sat. He could feel a smile forming on his lips.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Never thought you'd go all domestic on me. It suits you.” Bobby says, and Dean feels a little bit better about all of this. He had always hated the idea of living the “apple pie life”, but something about it has started to stick with him recently. He likes having Cas around, and something about that car ride with Claire in the backseat made him happy,
Dean moved his head in order to capture Cas’ lips in a kiss, and Cas knew he would never tire of this. Dean was still running his fingers through Cas’ hair, which now stood in every direction possible.
“You okay, brother?”
Benny hummed sleepily in peaceful understanding. “What’s her name?”
Dean scrambled back against the wall at this realization, his heart rate increasing rapidly. There was no way out; he was blocked by garbage on one side and the dumpster on the other. Dean closed his eyes and prayed to whichever deity was up there that the man would go away and Dean would get out safely.
“Yeah, so, I kind of need you to make ten dozen
Despite himself, Dean stood up to stand with Benny. “Okay, Benny, show me around this purgatory.”
When he got to the next paragraph, however, Cas let out an audible sob.
The host walked past Dean and entered his bedroom, heading straight for his wardrobe. Thankfully, it seemed like he and Dean were about the same height. Cas figured that Dean could wash and dry the outfit that he arrived in, but he would need a pair of sleeping clothes for that night. The host chose a simple, striped sleep shirt and matching pants for his guest, as well as a pair of boxer shorts and socks.
It had been two days, and Cas was beginning to seriously suffer from a lack of Dean. He was addicted to the adorable man, and said adorable man had been avoiding him since Lucifer’s visit. Cas didn't want to force his presence upon Dean. He would give him space for a few more days to let him cool down.
Why had he chosen to rest here? Why hadn’t he kept walking?
Cas moved to sit on the mattress next to Dean, careful to leave a safe amount of space between them so as to not startle the other man. “Dean?” Dean turned to look at him. “We’ll work through this, won’t we?”
of the leaky bathroom faucet. Cas needed to get that fixed; maybe Dean would know how to do it.
Lucifer sighed, as if Cas was causing him great difficulty by asking his question. “Fine, we’ll skip the small talk. Castiel, as you know, I’m pretty high up in the army right now.”
Why was Cas talking to a Nazi? Was he friends with a Nazi? Was all this just a setup for Cas to hand him over? Dean’s mind began racing with worries. He put his ear to the door again, trying to make out what the men were saying. He listened just in time to hear Cas’ words: “There’s someone in my basement.”
After about ten minutes, Alastair pulled out abruptly. He stood behind Dean, apparently considering the latter’s back. Dean heard, rather than saw, the clicking of Alastair’s boots on the tile floor as he moved around the kitchen to retrieve something. Having retrieved whatever it was that he wanted, Alastair returned to his position behind Dean. Instead of re-entering Dean as Dean expected, Dean felt something cool trace over his back, and a sudden prick of pain. It was almost like… a needle?
“Yes, yes, of course, thank you so much, Lucifer. Thank you, thank you,” Cas babbled, unable to profuse his thanks enough.
Cas agreed and turned to give the freckled man better access. Dean’s freckles, much to Cas’ delight, weren’t limited to his face; there were little brown spots all over his body. Cas loved it. Dean washed Cas’ hair thoroughly, and Cas wiggled around to lather Dean’s body up with soap. They cleaned each other lovingly, worshipping each other’s bodies in a purely non-sexual way. Neither man had any expectation for this action to devolve into sex; they just took care of each other with love. The hot water was bliss; it felt to Cas like it washed away all the pain and realities of the world around them. No old ladies, no Nazi sympathizers could touch him under the protective shield of the hot shower water. He was invincible.
Alastair kept fucking Dean as hard as he could until Dean felt the telling signs of his impending orgasm. Alastair’s thrusts lost their military precision, becoming more and more erratic until Alastair pulled out at the last second, coming all over Dean’s lower back.
Dean stiffened. Alastair was never like this. What had happened?
It had started in an organized fashion. Cas was a professional, after all. Cas showed Dean how to properly form a crust, rolling it out onto the counter. Dean pretended to have trouble with it, and Cas played along; he sidled up behind Dean, taking his arms in hand and working him through the motions. It was cheesy, but they had fun.
fans, and they wanted more. Cas’ bakery was suddenly flooded with soldiers from all over the country eating endless amounts of jelly donuts. Cas had never seen such a thing. He was just waiting for the day when one of the Nazi officers grew suspicious and started asking more questions. Why wasn’t Cas drafted to the army? Who was his baker?
“What’s interesting is the case.” Dean replied pointedly, “I’m gonna handle our woman in white out on Centennial Highway and
“How are you, Dean?”
Dean moves towards him and kisses him right then and there because he almost
He kneels down and hands Claire a piece of paper and a fifty dollar bill, “Ok, listen up, kid. You call me and Cas if there’s an emergency. I’m giving you fifty bucks to go buy new clothes with Uncle Bobby, so don’t spend it all on candy alright?”
Baby roared down the highway, the sound of Led Zeppelin's Ramble On muted by the wind that blew past her open windows. Dean was smiling, fingers tapping subtly against the wheel. Cas sat next to him, reading
Dean and Cas take some time to be normal.
Dean laughs, “Thanks, Bobby.”
and he never wants to leave Cas again.
He draws devil’s traps on the cold concrete floor of an abandoned warehouse. He comes alone, making sure that the only three entities in the building are himself, Castiel, and Dean. He leaves with a wink and a promise to bring back “the goods.”
Thank you all so so much for your feedback and comments <3 not only do they make my day, but seeing so any on a story I wasn't sure was going to do well had encouraged me to post two chapters of this story on its designated posting days (every three days) compared to my usual one chapter per work on its days. Thank you again and I hope you all enjoy today's two chapters!!
The hellhound runs, because it’s master is dead and there’s nothing left for it here.
Cas nodded absentmindedly, staring down at his magazine as Dean pulled out his phone, “Huh.”
Cas is reaching forward, putting a hand on Dean’s shoulder and saying something under his breath. Dean knows what he’s doing, and he wants to tell him to stop but he can’t because he isn’t strong enough to form words. He doesn’t want Cas to waste the rest of his grace on him, because Cas could need it for himself one day and Dean doesn’t want him to get hurt.
her rather than
Cas stays planted outside of Baby’s door, blade in hand. Dean considers just telling him to just hop in and they can drive off, but he knows that wouldn’t do any good.
Dean thinks his chest hurts, but everything is hazy and he can’t really tell. Cas is on his knees next to him, and he’s saying something that Dean can’t quite make out. He wants to tell Cas he’s sorry, because now they won’t have a chance to live the life that he’s been imagining. He can feel himself getting more tired and he doesn’t have the strength to fight against it.
He speaks of angels and demons. He speaks of Heaven and Hell and Dean doesn’t want to believe him. He tries to convince himself that Cas is a liar, but he knows that’s just something he’s telling himself so he doesn’t have to face the truth. Cas tells Dean about the apocalypse and the cage, about the locks and the breaking of the first seal and how it has to be Dean. How it was
Dean and Benny exchanged frightened looks and jumped to their feet, each lifting a heavy stone block to act as though they had been working the whole time. The guard click-clicked his way around the pile and rounded the corner, bringing him face-to-face with Dean.
“You know what I mean. Of course I need you, but I don’t need to have a husband to be successful or happy.” She threw her arms up, “Hell, I might be happier without one.”
Castiel smiled and kissed the space beneath Dean’s jaw, then let himself drop down against the bed. He slid a hand under the pillow until he found tube of KY, then flexed his abdominal muscles to sit back up again. Dean wound an arm around Castiel’s back, helping haul him up, “You’re gorgeous, you know...”
“Is it someone near the base?”
“Isn’t polite for a man to, either. Doesn’t seem to stop ‘em.”
“I wish I could, too...” Cas paused a moment. “I wanted to, even considered it, just taking a train down to Lawrence... But I didn’t know if I would be intruding and Anna would have had my head if I left her alone with Mother and Father.”
Dean left Lawrence at the crack of dawn and spent half the day on the train ride to Chicago. By the time he got to the hotel, it was early afternoon. He was tired from the ride, but happy to be there. Chicago was hot, but no worse than Lawrence had been and both were a far cry better than the humid south. He just wanted to check in and get a shower before seeing Castiel.
Dean knew Alastair would definitely have noticed that Dean was gone by now, and he wondered idly if the Nazi had bothered looking for him at all. It wasn’t like Alastair had particularly cared for Dean in any way; he only liked using Dean to resolve his sexual frustration. After all, to Alastair he was simply a
Is it worth it?
“Wow,” Cas exhaled.
Cas’ thoughts must have been evident on his face, because Benny spoke up. “Don’t go looking at me like I’m some charity case, boy. I’ve seen enough of that from all the soldiers that come ‘round here.”
“Stop teasing, Cas,” Dean gritted out, the sensations frustrating him.
Dean looked slightly taken aback at Cas’ abrupt interjection. “Well, I just assumed—I mean, you said I could stay for a few days, and obviously it’s been much longer...” Dean was rambling again. Cas had come to find it adorable. “I didn’t want to impose on your hospitality, that’s all. You’ve done so much for me this past month.”
Benny nodded, too overcome with emotion to speak, and Cas waved one last time before heading out of the camp, leaving Benny standing with the handful of
she made for this fic—she's amazing!
An idea was forming in Cas' mind, but he knew it was very dangerous. When Dean walked towards the stoop, having finished his "work", Cas couldn't resist the temptation. Dean was too cute, streaks of black oil on his face and in his hair, looking as though Christmas had come early.
Contemplating it further, Dean realized that Cas never touched him if he could help it, always waiting for Dean to initiate the contact. He didn’t care about Dean; he was stringing Dean along until he could turn him in. Dean felt the hopelessness in his gut solidify and crust into something sharper—rage. He hated Castiel Novak, hated everything about him. Dean lay there, seething, waiting for Cas to dare to come downstairs.
Cas was happy to hear this, because he himself was absolutely hopeless when it came to household repairs. Dean told Cas that he would be happy to do any repairs Cas desired, and that he accepted payment in the form of baked goods. Cas laughed heartily at this, absolving Dean’s momentary panic that he had crossed a line by asking for payment.
Germany was gonna lose the war. Civilians knew it, soldiers knew it, even the Nazi leaders knew it. Hitler and his men, facing disaster, were trying to kill as many people as possible in the little time they had left. There were no more delays, no more excuses.
October 1944.
That was then. It was funny how so much shit could hit the fan in just twenty-four hours.
I almost jump out of my skin. “What the hell?”
“Is that something to be angry at me about?” Cas inquired, feeling a bit hurt.
Thursday.
Dean sat there without moving, staring at Cas incredulously. Honestly, Dean’s expression was one that Cas would have made at himself in that moment.
“I like your sex hair,” Dean decided.
“I like you,” Cas countered playfully.
April 11, 1945.
December 1942.
“Is it too hot? Sorry, I made it just before you came in.”
(See the end of the chapter for
The day went by all too quickly for Dean, as days tend to do when you’re dreading something. When the cover of darkness fell over Cas’ street, it was time.
, I got promoted today. Yes, that’s right,” he continued, replacing his fingers at once with his cock, bottoming out on the first thrust. “I’m going to be the head guard at one of the new camps that they’re building. I’ll be in charge of thousands of faggots like you. That will be fun, won’t it?”
Cas strode over to Dean, putting his arms around Dean’s waist and his chin on Dean’s shoulder. “What’cha making?”
“Will you,” he faltered, almost embarrassed to ask. “Will you come with me?”
Dean stiffened for a moment in surprise, and Cas silently cursed himself for scaring Dean like that. He knew that Dean had an aversion to unannounced physical contact, but Cas sometimes forgot and touched Dean out of habit. He figured the aversion was another product of Dean’s past as a refugee but, as a private person himself, Cas was not one to pry about other people’s backstories. He just tried to be as accommodating as possible.
I stumble into the main room, my head still fuzzy from the night before. Cas is already there, standing in the kitchen area. “Good morning,” he greets me cheerfully with a chaste kiss, holding out a steaming mug of coffee. God bless boyfriends.
Dean kissed Cas tenderly, moving to straddle him on the edge of the bed. The kiss started out slow, but began to heat up as Dean pressed his hips against Cas’, thrusting delicately. They shifted, each trying to get more friction through their layers of clothing. Cas tilted his head back, moaning softly, and Dean took that opportunity to leave a trail of kisses along his neck.
“Nothing,” Cas replied simply.
Cas suddenly released his grip on Dean, causing him to buck his hips involuntarily, looking for a replacement. Cas wasted no time removing Dean’s boxers and his own before taking both of their cocks in his curled fist. The room quickly filled with the sound of skin meeting skin, slapping together in a delicious rhythm. Their hands worked together, jacking them both off, moving faster and faster as they both got close. Cas felt his release coiling in his gut and stopped their movements, detangling their hands. He didn’t want to come, not just yet.
That night, after dinner, both men retreated upstairs to Cas’ bedroom. They got into bed, Dean on the left side, Cas on the right. Dean let out an involuntary sigh of relief as he sank into the fluffy blankets. He would never dare complain, and he was beyond grateful for what Cas had done for him thus far, but the mattress on the basement floor could not compare to the warm expanse of Cas’ bed.
Feeling better, and now giggling a bit himself, Dean let Cas lead him into the living room. They sat on the couch, Cas’ head in Dean’s lap. Cas smiled up at Dean, seeing the other man upside down. His freckles were especially prominent at this angle. “Read to me?”
“Huh?”
August 1936.
Cas sighed, tired of Lucifer treating him like a small child. “Yes, Lucifer, I won’t do anything
"Well, you succeeded," Dean smiled, a twinkle appearing in his eye. "Now, I believe you offered me a beer?"
“No, it’s perfect, thank you,” I respond honestly. My voice sounds like a tank took a joyride down a gravel road. Clearing my throat doesn’t help. Oh well, it’s still early. Everyone’s voice sounds rougher in the morning.
October 1937.
The landlord nods, his eyes glinting. “Yes, but did you read the fine print?”
Sammy had spent several months in the Auschwitz work camp before being transferred to Buchenwald. Despite his small stature, Sammy proved capable of keeping up with the men’s work in the camp. His prisoner’s uniform was much too big on him, pants held in place by the belt that was supplied and the fabric rolled up many times at the ankles. Luckily, his shoes fit, so he wasn’t tripping over himself like some less fortunate prisoners. Dean and Benny kept an eye out for the kid, helping him wherever they could. They hid him from the guards’ cruel gazes when possible, standing in front of the boy as a shield at the daily roll call, or
Cas followed not long after, adding to the mess with white stripes of hot come. As they came down from their highs, Cas traced his fingers over Dean’s stomach.
Cas felt his chest seize up. He was going to die, he knew it, and he had failed Dean as well. Lucifer was surely going to turn them in and that would be the end. Cas waited with baited breath for Lucifer to speak the news of Cas and Dean’s fate.
As each day passed, Cas found himself rushing home to get back to Dean as quickly as possible. Their conversations each night grew longer and longer, lasting more time than any pretense of “dinner” would explain. Cas found himself reluctant to leave Dean’s company at night, wanting to stay by the other man. The two could talk about anything, even content to sit in silence when topics of conversation ran out. Neither man wanted to point out that Dean had long overstayed his original welcome at Cas’ house.
(See the end of the chapter for
When he arrived, he began fixing himself dinner on the small stovetop in his kitchen. The sky was darkening outside Cas’ front window as he drew the shades and picked up the day’s newspaper, settling down to eat. He started to read of the country’s preparations for that summer’s Olympic games in Berlin. Cas looked forward to listening to the games on his radio, but he was rather jealous of his brother, Gabriel, who would be attending. It wasn’t every day that the Olympics were held under 300 kilometers northeast of your house.
,” he emphasized the last word.
Eventually, Dean heard the basement door open as a single set of footsteps made their way down the stairs. He heard Cas’ familiar, deep voice cut through the dark. “Dean?”
If Alastair had had a good day, he would likely have Dean under the table during dinner, warming Alastair’s cock in his mouth as he ate. When Alastair had finished his meal, Dean would be expected to finish Alastair off with his mouth, blowing him as best he could. If Alastair had had a bad day, however, he was prone to bending Dean over the kitchen table as soon as he came home, fucking him roughly and without preamble until Alastair climaxed.
you to be scared, love. If you show them your fear, then they’ve won,” Cas soothed.
It was going to be okay. It's not like Dean was leaving permanently. He'd arranged the whole thing with Balthazar; Dean would leave for a little while, hiding somewhere safer until the main raids were over. When Cas gave Balth the all-clear, and only then, Balthazar would find Dean and help him get back to Cas.
Dean feels bad about faking his death, his
. Everything is muffled.
“Surprise.” He coughs, “Not dead. Feel free to test me yourself, but, uh, we need to talk.”
He’s just about to turn in for the night when there’s a sharp knock at the door. Dean almost ignores it, but the voice in the back of his head bids him to go and open it.
-----------------
Dean and Cas get down to business.
Alastair is walking towards Cas, and Dean panics. His heart is beating in his ears and he doesn’t even feel himself crawling forward to retrieve the Colt. With his good arm he aims for Alastair’s back and holds his breath.
Dean knows that Bobby thinks he’s dead because if Dad and Sam know, Bobby also knows. Bobby’s gonna kill him as soon as Baby’s sitting in his driveway, which will be in less than five minutes if he keeps driving as fast as he is. He considers slowing down and pulling over just to work himself up to finish the drive, but one glance at Cas and Claire arguing about who would win in a fight between a werewolf and a ghost gives him enough courage to keep his foot on the gas.
shows up a week later.
Cas enjoyed the use of emoticons and emojis and would often try his best to include them in his texts, much to Dean’s dismay. Dean had once told him he used too many and his texts were becoming indecipherable, but he didn’t really care. He had just sent him a cat emoji in response and continued using his emojis and emoticons. He also enjoyed using text ‘slang’, telling Dean all about what the abbreviations meant and how effective he found them. Dean had just told him to keep the abbreviations to a minimum of two per text and went back to nursing his cup of coffee. Sam had never minded much, and on a few occasions when the texts were not hunt or apocalypse related, replied with his own emojis. Not as many as Cas, of course, but a smiley face or a thumbs up here and there.
I really hope i can get back to updating twice a week during summer!!
He’s sitting alone at a table in the corner, pretending to reread the menu again even though he’s already decided what he wants when Castiel walks through the door.
(See the end of the chapter for
Cas’ eyes are heavy and burdened as he speaks, “I’m sorry. I-I’m not strong enough to finish… I’m human now and-”
“You won’t.” Castiel states firmly, “You don't want to.”
Dean and Cas take a trip. Sam gets a visitor.
It’s still dark out, but it's winter and the sun rises slow so he knows it's really not that early. He hears coughing again and turns to the bed next to him.
--------------------
Dean Winchester is twenty two and he feels like he’s drowning.
“Dean.” Cas sounds surprised, as if he hadn’t meant for Dean to hear him, “Did I wake you?”
They’re sitting outside the building, Dean checks the Colt and then checks it again because he can’t help but feel nervous. He’s about to check it again when Cas puts a hand on his shoulder. He doesn’t say anything, but Dean feels better nonetheless.
He and Cas spend his birthday in a motel room just outside of Las Vegas watching westerns from stolen dvds. Cas doesn’t really understand the moves and Dean knows he’s just pretending he does to spare his feelings. They get cake at some random bakery, and drinks from a liquor store a mile away. Cas gives Dean a copy of “Of Mice and Men”, because it's interesting and compelling and Cas wants Dean to experience something he finds so humanistically beautiful. Dean thanks him, and they watch movies until the early hours of the morning and Dean falls asleep still in his jeans.
They call Crowley to find the last demon on the list because that son of a bitch has a
“It’s interesting.” Cas grumbled, taking the magazine back and reopening it , “Not accurate whatsoever, but interesting. I enjoy hearing of the divine from a human point of view.”
Dean and Cas are standing in a barn in Minnesota.
Bobby grunts and waves them inside, heading straight for the kitchen. He fills up three silver shot glasses with what he already knows is holy water and gives them to Dean, Cas and Claire. They don’t ask questions, just drink them and hand the glasses back to Bobby.
Cas’ eyes burn warm and blue and Dean thinks it might just be the most beautiful thing he’s ever seen, and then he feels his strength return to him and Cas is moving backwards to give him air. He looks down at his chest and sees the gaping wounds gone, replaced with angry red scars and a burn on his shoulder where Cas has just removed his hand.
Bobby just sighs and goes to pour himself a drink, “So what the hell are you doing here then?”
“I don’t sleep.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Dean’s stuck in a cast for the next six weeks, the doctor tells him.
Maybe it’s always been just him.
Cas visits a sibling.
. Something about them makes Dean sick. Cas is moving forward and Dean has to stop himself from grabbing his arm and pulling him back. He knows they can kill Alastair, but he doesn’t know what it will cost to do so.
It's March now.
“Castiel.”
-----------------
He’s surprised when he does. There’s a man outside his door, all sharp angles and subtle discomfort. He’s shorter than Dean, but he carries himself like he could squish him like a bug. His hair is dark brown, practically black, and sticks out like he’s just been caught in a storm. He’s wearing a suit and a trenchcoat, both items looking far too expensive for someone standing outside a motel room door. His eyes are so blue and fierce that Dean almost looks away. His face is stony and his head moves ever so slightly, as if trying to read Dean.
her. She’s too busy petting Bobby’s sad excuse for a guard dog and staring at him like he’s the coolest dog in the world. Dean chuckles, but his smile falls as he hears the locks behind the door click and Bobby’s frowning face is in the doorway.
Dean snatched the magazine from his hands,glancing down at it and then back at the road, “
They’re stopped at a gas station in Arkansas when it happens.
Cas smiles, and Dean feels himself smile back, “I think I’d like to be one too, Dean.”
“Not really.” Dean shrugged, handing him the phone, “Here, you can read it. I’m gonna fill up the tank.”
get you caught up.” Dean says it like a promise...
Cas looks distressed to say the least. His eyes dart to the door and to Dean and back again until Dean puts a hand on his shoulder and tells him to calm down and think. Cas suggests putting Claire into the foster system, which Dean immediately shoots down.
“And after that?”
Castiel’s gaze grew dark, his eyes flitting over the people in the diner, “I’m.. not at liberty to discuss that yet.”
He and Cas are sitting in Baby and his hands and face all feel cold. It’s warm out, but he can’t shake the feeling that something will go wrong. He thinks Cas feels it too, but if he does he doesn’t say anything.
is not research, Cas. ‘Final proof world is coming to an end’? ‘Seven bible warnings you must heed now’? Seriously?”
It’s December.
Dean takes his shot last, and as soon as he does Bobby is engulfing him in a tight hug.
He’s been thinking for awhile about finally cutting off Sam and Dad, and he hasn’t been seeing as many cons as of late. He hasn’t heard from Sam in weeks and Dad’s latest case from him was a bust. He knows about the angels now, and they know about him. He knows that anyone who’s ever heard his name is a target now.
Cas breaks free of Lilith’s hold and stabs her through the back. She sparks orange, and Dean can see the light go out in her eyes.
“Cas?”
Reminder that I did post a companion piece that goes with the previous chapter, so make sure you check that out!! I plan to have quiet a few companion pieces, and, while there won't be one for every chapter, when there are ones, they'll be posted anytime between when the chapter is posted and the next day (so every Wednesday or Thursday)!
Cas goes shopping and Sam gets breakfast.
Cas sits down across from her and chokes on his words as he tries his best to explain who he is. He tells her that he is an “Angel of the Lord” and that he asked her father for his body in order to stop the apocalypse. He tells her that he is becoming human, because some of the angels are actually trying to cause the apocalypse and are trying to stop him. He explains that because he is becoming human, her father has left and gone to Heaven.
Dean stops texting Sam. Or rather, Sam stops texting Dean because he’s the one who hasn’t responded to Dean’s last two messages. It’s only been a week since their last text, but Dean knows deep down that it will be their last. Sam’s responses had grown shorter and colder since he’d arrived at Stanford, and Dean knew when he wasn’t wanted. It stung, but Dean reminds himself that he’s doing this for Sam, because he deserves a long, happy life separated from hunting and monsters and if that means separate from Dean too, he can live with that.
--------------------
“Hey, Bobby.” Dean says with a sheepish smile.
------------------
The man looks down, as if he’s never thought much about his outfit or his looks, “This body does not belong to me. It’s a vessel. A
Neither of them say anything else.
“My car… The windows.” he says slowly, “That was you talking? Buddy you cost me over two hundred bucks worth of repairs.”
“It was unnecessary to purchase two beds.” he states matter of factly.
He keeps walking until he reaches the edge of the parking lot and behind a flickering lamp post , and just like that he’s gone.
Decided to ramp up the domesticity in this chapter just because I started outlining future angst teehee. When I said this was a slow burn I meant a REALLY slow burn. I have plans to continue this fic with a MINIMUM of 15 more chapters lmfao. I also included Sam and Jess just bc I love them lol. I'm trying to really up the foreshadowing, but I don't think I have enough so that's something to work on. Anyways! Everyday updates for the next week woohoo!!! then we'll go to a Tuesday schedule because I'm super busy sjdfjshdbj. As always, comments are VERY appreciated mwah <3 see u tmrw base
