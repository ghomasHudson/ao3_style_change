“Oh... right... umm, I don't really know just surprise me?” He frowned a bit and kept staring at her, he really should stop staring at her, but he couldn’t help it. She intrigued him.
“The little girl began to sob. She knew she was alone, but deep down inside of her she hoped that there were people hiding somewhere.”
John swallowed and had to look away because it was too much. He slowly shook his head, “I’m sorry...” He whispered.
“What? I told you, you aren’t coming!” John flailed around, he wasn’t about to add murder to his list of regrets. Granted, he wouldn’t have been the one to murder Sherlock, but if something did happen to Sherlock on the way home he wouldn’t ever be able to forgive himself.
John was so lonely and so heartbroken that he knew he had to put an end to this... even if he didn’t want to, he knew he had to and with time he knew that it would be better. Holding onto this was making it so he couldn’t let go. He couldn’t move on – and that was something he really needed to do.
John groaned, “Sherlock, where are we going!? It looks like it’s going to snow soon! It never snows and when it does I would much rather be inside than outside.”
He huffed, rolling his eyes slightly, but nodding nonetheless, “fine! But only because I’m getting my letter from John today!”
Sherlock eventually stopped and sunk down to the ground, clutching his head in his bloody, and broken hands. It looked like he was sobbing, but John couldn’t be sure and before he could figure it out the screen went black. John let out a breath and just sat there for a minute. That wasn’t so bad... It wasn’t great, sure, but John definitely had his violent days in the army. He sighed at the memories of his own violent days and slowly played the next one.
He sighed after a moment, choosing to ignore Sherlock's threat, “If you could get hard that would be great...” He grumbled as he continued to rub Sherlock.
Sherlock screamed and pulled his hand back to punch the man, but punched the wall instead. He wasn’t about to hurt his dealer… that would definitely mean no more drugs ever for him, “my brother cut me off!! I don’t have any money! Please! I’m out and I CAN’T STAND IT!!!” He hissed and tugged roughly at his hair.
John could tell he was uncomfortable and so was he, but he felt like this was something they needed to do, “You make me feel the same...” He whispered and slowly reached forward to grab Sherlock's hand. He entwined their fingers together and John slowly started to stand on his tip toes.
His father hummed and smiled, “You’re welcome… and I suppose now would be the best time ever to tell you that John is dead. He didn’t make it and I think that is the best birthday present I could ever give you!” He sighed happily, “So glad you didn’t die when I shot you because than I couldn’t give you the best present I’ve ever given you.”
The cab seemed to drive on forever, but eventually it came to a stop in front of Sherlock's – and his – home.  It was still weird to him calling it his home, but it was, because at the moment he didn’t have one. He left the cab with Sherlock still inside so that he would have to pay the cabbie. It was only fair really and John knew he shouldn’t be mad at Sherlock, but he honestly couldn’t help it… Sherlock was socially awkward, hell, everyone knew that! He knew that even before he talked to Sherlock, it was one of the main reasons he got bullied so bad. Of course he didn’t understand how wrong that was, and he clearly regretted doing it, but John was still angry and he needed time.
Sherlock’s jaw clenched a bit, “Reasons that you don't need to concern yourself with!” He snapped before taking a calming breath and looked at John again, “And since you are wondering, but you won’t ask me... no he isn’t dead. Just seriously injured, I’m having Mycroft come and retrieve him. He won’t be bothering us again.” He hummed, hoping that that would make John drop the subject on the knife.
The gaze of John’s eyes was intense and he wanted to immediately look away, but he held his ground, “Yes.” He said quietly. He hadn’t admitted it out loud yet, though it wasn’t as hard as he imagined it would be.
The bell shrilled and John jumped up. “Come on!! We’re going to be late!!” he ran out of the room and Sherlock was left blinking. He grabbed his stuff as quickly as he could and ran after John.
Sherlock nodded and slowly followed him into his office. He sat down next to John as the DI sat down across from them, the only thing between them was a desk. Sherlock watched as the DI slipped him an envelope. Sherlock didn’t understand still and that was really frustrating to him. But then again he wasn’t understanding a lot of things at the moment. He slowly opened it and inside was a cheque for £500. “What’s this for...?”
Sherlock fell to the floor and choked on a sob as he clutched the paper tightly to his chest. Everything hurt and knowing that he almost lost John for good practically killed him, after a long time he slowly grabbed his mobile and swallowed.
! Did he do that to John? His John! Sherlock kept running and furrowed his brow as the car approached the turning point. Right or left? Only... It was going way too fast to turn and it would never make it! Ted wasn’t even breaking and then clarity struck him, right or left wasn’t going to happen because he was going straight. Ted was a smart man in that he knew that there was nothing left for him... Might as well end it, but so help him because he was
It's now November 7, 2019 and I'm having to reread and edit it all because I don't remember all the small details I need. ughhh. anyway, just so you know it isn't abandoned. Just going through some shit and s4 destroyed me and made me hate Sherlock for a very long time. My bad guys.
John let out a sigh of relief, “I mean you thought I was dead so I guess I wouldn’t be able to blame you if you did, but.... thank you.” He whispered, smiling softly.
"Death is a funny thing... Isn't it?" She whispered, laying down next to John and hugging him to her.
“Then all of this was for nothing and I’ll die like I was supposed to.” He said quietly, “Anything for John.”
Well i just keep on hurting myself, dont I. Fuck me. I love my angst but this is a lot of it. hahahahaha hope you enjoyed it anyway.
John narrowed his eyes and glared at Mike, “right! And who the fuck is going to love me for me? I would have to hide who I really am my whole entire life and I’m sorry, but I would never stoop so low as to lie to my own partner. They should know everything about me and I should know everything about them.”
Sherlock opened his mouth to speak, but he didn’t know what to say. It wasn’t that he was frozen, it was that he knew John wouldn’t want his father to turn his aggression on him. Still he felt helpless and the world spun around him. John's father was also being unreasonable. You could not simply command someone to stop being gay… apparently he made a noise though because John's father suddenly turned his attention to Sherlock.
This can be read as a one off in all honesty so I'm making it complete. I might come back and finish it one day, but for right now I think I like how it ends. I hope you guys enjoy the rest of the story. Like I said perhaps one day there will be a continuation, but for right now lets just enjoy the way it ends.
Soon the bell rang and Sherlock ran out of the class as quick as possible. He had to otherwise the rugby team would corner him and beat him up for messing with John. It was funny really... They would beat him up all the time before John, and then they all became friends, and now they were beating him up again. Sherlock deserved it he supposed... and it wasn’t that bad because him and Brian were still friends and Brian wasn’t mad at him, but Sherlock thought that that was because Brian loved him... Or claimed he did.
Claire smiled at him softly and nodded, “I’m glad you’re getting better if you ever–“ She was cut off by a customer and gave John a pained smile, “I’ll be right back, love.” She said softly and then went to tend to the customer’s needs.
"Hey! My other jumpers aren't hideous!" He grumbled as he glared at him slightly, but there was no heat to it. He was wearing his black and white stripped jumper, and it was probably his favourite one too. It was thin and made of cotton and it showed off John's lean rugby body.
“John, you really need to shower. You haven’t showered in a week and you haven’t changed your clothes either. Your smell is giving me a migraine, I love you, but I can only handle so much.” He drawled with a sigh.
“So Sherlock, tell me… what do you want to be when you grow up?” The question had been on John’s mind for a while now, probably even before today. Sherlock was brilliant and clever and a little bit odd. He was rude sometimes and he got irritated easily. John always wondered what kind of job Sherlock would deem adequate enough for him.
Sherlock practically burst out laughing and nearly fell to the floor. The teacher turned around and glared at him and he gave a small apologetic shrug.
Sherlock frowned slightly, “Now why on earth would you–“ He finally turned around and just froze. This wasn’t possible and he felt his knees go weak, his heart stuttering in his chest. Great he was only twenty-three and he was having a heart attack, how lovely. He was also dimly aware he had dropped the cat, luckily cats were able to land on their feet. He shook his head once and blinked a bit because surely this was the drugs and not his actual sight. Maybe he had taken too much? The drugs never messed with his sight though! Maybe the stupid dealer laced this batch, fucking wanker. Wouldn’t be going to him again.
you know... sometimes in the notes authors put informational facts, but I just put a bunch of random shit that i'm feeling... you may blame my ADHD for that....
Sherlock used his free hand to run it through John's hair softly. He rested it on the back of John's neck and slowly started to pull him in. His heart was pounding, but he knew that this was the right thing. It felt right and that was all that mattered.
“Do you like it?” he asked softly. He knew John obviously liked it, but he didn’t know what else to say.
but for seriousness i LOVE reading your comments and i reply back to everyone unless its a comment that doesnt need replying to because like what the fuck am i supposed to say to those comments...
Mike glanced at John who shook his head once. He looked back at Sherlock and shook his head, “Sorry, mate. I left it in my office...”
Zack swallowed hard and then his jaw clenched. He was so angry, never in his life had he been this angry. He glared at the wall and then slowly lowered himself onto the couch so that he could hold his best friend. Ever since Sherlock came into John’s life they hadn’t hung out like they used to. It made Zack a little upset just because now he had to spend all his time with Brian. Brian was okay and all, but he was very annoying if you spent long periods of time with him. Zack’s mind was whirling and thinking about so many things that he didn’t even realise that John had spun around in his arms.
also if you just stumbled upon this story you should check out my other story!!! TULIPS OF LOVE!! just click on my name and you will find it, but actually i know you are all lazy arses so here you go...
Months passed in a blur and John had stopped taking on cases. He let his staff go – let them be free – he didn’t even care if one of them were to turn him in, but no one did... The only person that stayed with him was Mike. He didn’t understand why, but he also didn’t ask. John didn’t speak these days, but Mike didn’t seem to mind the silence. He understood.
“I was actually just heading out of the house when you walked in… I wasn’t even sure if I was going to be able to say goodbye to you… or hello for that matter,” she said and looked down at him sadly.
John shook his head and burst into tears, he couldn’t help it, they just spilled from his eyes before he even had a say in the matter, “No!! No it’s not! You- you died! I- I saw it with my own two eyeballs! And now- I don’t- please don’t leave!” He gasped and clung to the front of Sherlock's shirt, he couldn’t leave him. Not now. Not after he finally came back to him.
Mycroft groaned, “Why are you covering up for them? I can help you... you can be with him...” He swallowed hard. “You told me that there is a difference between killers and assassins... Killers kill for fun... you only kill because you get paid... You wouldn’t do this if you weren’t getting paid. I know it.”
After that they had a nice little ceremony and it was Sherlock's turn to speak. He didn’t want to one bit, but he promised his mother he would months ago. She had asked, and how could he refuse her last wish? He slowly stood up and walked to the front of the church. He stood at the podium and adjusted the microphone. With shaking fingers, he slowly took out a piece of paper and then ripped it up, “See, I don’t need this.” He cleared his throat and looked at John because John helped him through all the hard times, “Some of you know me... some of you don’t, but what you should know is that I do not speak in front of people and I certainly don’t pour my heart out to people. I’m a rude, arrogant, little shit. That being said... this is what my mother wanted and God help me if I’m not going to try and give her everything she wanted in her last moments.”
John blinked and stopped walking. He turned his body around so that he was walking next to Sherlock’s once again and didn’t say anything for a long while. His mind was spinning and he felt a little sick. He wasn’t mad at Sherlock at all, God no, but he hadn’t told anyone that and it felt all the more real to have it be out in the open.
Sherlock's back was turned so he couldn't see who it was – oh but he could hear him just fine... His voice cut through the room and echoed and Sherlock's heart felt like it was breaking. There had to be an obvious explanation, but all that came out of his mouth was, "John....?" He spun around and pointed his gun right at him. Yes, he hoped it was a trick, but he couldn't take chances and John was pointing a gun at him...
It was now Mycroft’s turn to roll his eyes. Secretly, he was proud of his baby brother for finding someone, especially considering how hard things had been for the boy. He was immensely proud of him and extremely happy, but he would never admit that to Sherlock. Instead he just went back to his newspaper and tried his best to ignore the couple in the kitchen.
He swallowed and downed his Love Potion, he wasn’t going to say anything, he was going to tell her, ‘hey, thanks for the offer, but I don’t want to thrust my problems on you.’ But before he could even think about saying that, the words were tumbling out of his mouth, “I just got back from the army and I’m so angry because there I felt like something... like I meant something to the world. I was helping people, but then I had to go and get fucking shot! And it’s not even fair because the whole four and a half years I was there Sherlock ignored me for three of them! He was all I had and he bloody ignored me! He wrote me for a year and a half, but after a year and a half he just stopped so I had to endure three years of complete silence! I
Sherlock and DI Garrett were talking, but he didn’t hear anything they were saying. His mind whirling with so many thoughts that it didn’t finally shut up until they were already in the cab and Sherlock directed a question to him.
“Move out of the way, Sherlock.” Sigar growled a bit. “I don’t want to shoot my own son, but I will if I have to.”
Blake about gagged and pulled off, but nonetheless swallowed. That had to be the nastiest thing he had ever tasted in his whole entire life and he now had a higher respect for women who swallowed. Of course he never got any action anymore because he could never leave, but his respect still stayed.
John wanted to scream and lunge across the table. Why were they just sitting back and letting this happen? It wasn’t right!! But it also wasn’t his place to do anything so he closed his eyes and counted to ten. Because Sherlock would be livid with him if he intervened and he already made Sherlock upset enough these days.
John took a deep breath, “Look, Sherlock, I know you may want to, but you can’t… so, I will see you in chemistry on Monday, alright?” He started to walk away, quickly, just as Sherlock ran to catch up to him.
John was silent for a long time. He didn’t know what to say and those five words cut him so deep. This just confirming what he already knew, this Sherlock was not the Sherlock he loved. He did suppose it was silly to still assume Sherlock was his boyfriend, but he still considered Sherlock his boyfriend despite everything that had happened, so it really wasn’t that silly of an assumption. “Guess I was mistaken then…” He said dryly.
“Like... when we have sex your hands are always buried in it... or when we are snuggling you’re always playing with it. Sometimes I catch you staring at it and other times you find excuses just to touch it in public.” He said quietly.
had been through! At least Sherlock thought something! John was left with nothing and he didn’t know if Sherlock had died or if he had just stopped wanting to talk to John. He didn’t know if he was kidnapped or if John had angered him. John literally knew nothing and John thought that that was much worse than thinking your lover was dead.
John sighed and shook his head. He bent down and started helping Sherlock pick up his things. “You should ignore them. They’re just a couple of idiotic twats who think they are better than everyone just because they can run up and down a field while getting tackled. When the reality is, they are just like everyone else.”
I think this is a pretty quick update! Plus i updated two of my other two fics and damn this has never happened before! i feel accomplished! Mwhahah
Sherlock didn’t say anything, he honestly didn’t know what to say – apparently there was a god though because suddenly his phone vibrated and he breathed a sigh of relief. “My mother wants to see us. Bring a board game.” He said standing up abruptly, running out of the flat.
Claire wiped the tears off her face and just closed her eyes, hoping with everything she had that Sherlock was able to find John and bring him home. She had worked so hard to keep him safe the last two years, had always been there for him… talked him down when he needed it. It couldn’t end like this just because she had a slip up. She refused to let it.
The car peeled into the car park of the motel, John parked the car and walked into the dodgy looking building. He walked past the front desk and went down the hall, deciding to use the stairs instead because he would be able to avoid the cameras better. Once he got to the first floor, he wandered the hallways until he found room 134. He swallowed hard, closed his eyes, and took a breath as he tried the handle and surprisingly it was unlocked. Perhaps this was all a trap, but either way he would kill the man before he died, even if it was the last thing he did.
John swallowed hard and his face softened. He looked pained and he opened his mouth to speak, but nothing came out so he tried again, "I'm sorry...." He whispered.
John! It was John!! His eyes were screwed shut and he had a pained expression on his face as he coughed but he... he was alive! He quickly jumped out of bed and ran down the hall screaming for a doctor because John needed one and he needed one quickly before he went back into that horrible coma.
They got to the funeral and the family was ushered into a small room. This was the part Sherlock was dreading... at the viewing it was open and everyone could see her and it seemed like it would last that way forever, but now, here in this small room, Sherlock knew it was going to end.
They kept walking for quite some time before Sherlock's hand brushed against John's. He swallowed and pretended like it didn’t happen. If he pretended like it didn’t happen then John wouldn’t have noticed. Or at least that’s what he told himself, which was really contradicting to everything Sherlock had told himself. Everyone pretended like things didn’t happen, like things didn’t exist, but Sherlock still saw them. Still, not everyone was Sherlock and was blind… So if he pretended it didn’t happen, then it didn’t happen.
John awoke to the sound of beeping and pain in his body. He didn't want to open his eyes, but he could tell he was in a bright room – and if the sounds of the beeping were anything to go by he was in hospital. He mentally cursed himself and tried to think back to the last thing that he had done... Ah, right, the bottle of pills... So stupid. He should have known that Claire would have followed him home. And wasn't that just brilliant? Because the second he opened his eyes he was going to see her angry face... Unless she wasn't there, then he would have to wait until she walked into the room, but either way he would have to see her angry face and he would probably get yelled at and wasn't that just something! Unlike last time however he wasn't grateful that she found him. He was done. He was tired and he tried to move on, but ended up getting yelled at and kicked to the ground, figuratively of course, but it all hurt the same. He wasn't okay and the fact that people just expected him to be okay was sickening to him, how could they expect him to just move on? Perhaps John was too dependent on Sherlock, but after years of not having him, only to have him ripped away again right as their relationship had repaired itself, hurt tremendously. He tried to move on, he honestly did, but he just couldn’t let go and he was so exhausted. He finally wanted a dreamless sleep, one that he would never wake up from.
“I’m fine, John!” He snapped, pulling his hand away. He hated being rude to John, but if he allowed himself to give in to John's comfort, he wouldn’t be able to stop.
“Sherlock... Sherlock no, don't say that...” He swallowed a bit and kissed his forehead, “I probably wouldn’t have believed myself either...” He sighed and held his lover, is that even what Sherlock was to him anymore? He sighed at the thought and shook his head because now was not the time to overthink things. Sherlock needed him and he would be there for the boy no matter what, he always would.
“Gee, that makes me feel so loved.” He said sarcastically, it seemed John answered the question he didn’t want answered anyway.
Sherlock swallowed hard and shook his head. That wasn't important now. "So... This is it then? You're going to kill me?" He spat, "But you're not following through with your mission. You said you were supposed to torture me so why the fuck aren't you following through?" He snapped.
John gasped a bit and his eyes felt heavy, “If you don’t do something quickly I’m going to die and then I most certainly haunt you for all eternity for killing me.” He snapped and then closed his eyes. Oh yes, sleep felt very good at the moment.
Claire nodded slowly, knowing this question would probably come up, "As you would expect... Did he –  did he watch it happen..." She closed her eyes and prayed that he hadn't. John didn't tell her what happened, but it was all over the news... Everywhere she went it seemed like he was still there, but he really wasn’t. Sherlock was up and rising in his success and with Barts being such a monumental place, of course the news was going to cover it.
Sherlock nodded and began to tell him everything. He started with the first text that came at his mum’s funeral, all the way up to what would happen if he didn’t jump. He didn’t mention anything that happened while he was gone though, it didn’t matter. “I just… I couldn’t risk telling you I was alive, I was terrified that they were still watching you and if you even showed the slightest bit of happiness they would have killed you on sight.” He took a breath, “I couldn’t risk your life that way. I would rather you be hurt from my death never want me back in your life when I finally came back, than for you to know I was alive only to die. You must understand that…”
John blinked. The voice sounded so kind and not at all mad. It also sounded friendly so John slowly came out from under the desk and looked at the man. He was older and had silver hair. There was stubble on his face and he had very kind, soft brown eyes. “Now, are you going to tell me why you’re dressed up so nice and hiding under my desk?” He asked softly as he sat back in his chair and gave John lots of room.
John Took a deep shuddering sigh, shifting my hands that still clasped the arms of his sweater sleeves. “What happened to me?” John asked brow furrowed clearly not wanting me to know but trying to help me focus. I shouldn’t, I knew but I couldn’t ever say no to John.
With a plan in motion, they both sat in the relative dark and waited till they heard the door to the office open and click shut.
“John...” I mouthed, a habitual reaction to my John being in pain. Ever so dearly hoping Moriarty hadn’t noticed my moment of weakness.
The rubber of my shoes slaps loudly against the tile, echoing along with the sounds of laughter and harsh grunts. Noise reverberating and shaking my ribs the closer I get. Suddenly the clatter of metal on tile, the wet sound of flesh hitting flesh the drip of fluid the grunts of pain and peels of…
Dropping to my knees, the vague sting of a sudden fall aches through me. Easily ignored, John is on the other side, so close… lock pick the door. Easy! I had been doing it since childhood. My hands were shaking, why wouldn’t they stop shaking? O’ visions being impaired, why? A shaking hand reaches up to my eyes, wet … I’m crying. Useless this doesn’t help John! Shaky hands and watery eyes will not do. I need to help Jo….
“Sherlock… mate?” I flinched as someone touched my shoulder, John. His eyes shown blue and murky with confusion wrinkles bunching above his nose, I wanted to smooth the wrinkles back out again.
I needed to do something drastic if I wanted John to hear about it before lunch “…oriarty , a new student” my head snapped up, What was that?
Surely an abandoned one, if he managed to sleep their last night. In fact maybe not a classroom at all. Perhaps more likely a basement storage room… yes!
I wasn’t surprised when I arrived at the closet to see John hadn’t arrived yet. He was probably grabbing us both lunch, and while at first it drove me insane I have since come to realize John was no stranger to hunger and recognized it in me even before I did. It was those small surprising details that drew me to John. Things I should despise as weakness yet, John has faced the worst kind of suffering I’ve yet to come across and was the kindest person I’d yet to meet. I wish albeit hopelessly, that Johns kindness would only be for me and that to him I was just as irreplaceable as he had become to me.
I couldn’t talk to John about it, Moriarty would skin me if he found out but if I bumped into Harry, well Moriarty wouldn’t care to know Johns siblings. I had to catch her at the high school it was my only option, she never came to pick John up. It was a bit of a walk and Mycroft would be livid at me leaving him in the middle school parking lot but Johns safety was worth a lecture. Though to my surprise, an emotion I hadn’t felt in my weeks with Moriarty. Harriet Watson was screaming at the office aid in the entrance of our school.
There was a larger factor however, which was John getting beaten at school for weeks, right under my nose. What’s that quote... ‘So busy looking back that you miss what is right in front of you.’ Nonsense, surely I would have… I must have… when was the last time I’d seen John. A week ago, when… when I looked away because the bruising was the worst I had ever seen. It had hurt too much to watch.
It had taken a month; but I found John and I met before classes, during lunch and waited for our siblings to pick us up after school. Loathe to admit it even if only to myself, I was trying to impress John.
My focus was slipping, more of my time spent away from Moriarty’s side and next to rugby lockers hoping to hear tidbits about John. Until I found out he dropped out of rugby, the team was devastated. The locker room chatter was filled with "...But he was lined up to play varsity in high school!" and "...One day he’d told the couch he didn’t have the time to play anymore, can you believe that! just walking up to coach and quitting."
I panted, wildly out of breath, At least Moriarty’s shouting gave away John’s location. The door furthest down the corridor, locked of course.
This was supposed to be the last chapter until I realized how extensively long it would be if I didn't cut it up into two parts.
There stood James Moriarty a face I’d tried very hard to forget. He was staring at me and as soon as I had looked up our eyes had met. He smiled and waved subtly. This was bad.
Idly I wondered how Mycroft would try to convince me on the car ride home later today to tell our parents, I do so hope my fat slob of a brother wouldn’t attempt to bribe me with sweets again.
I looked over to John he was glaring at James his small hand reached out and grabbed mine turning to walk back where we had come from and away from James.
“Sherlock, who was that? What was that shouting? Do you know where John is?” Harry stood shaking me, chipped red nail polish digging into my clothed upper arms. Unimportant.
John brings his chin down to his chest to look at me while he lays there “We’ll meet here after school then?” serious again even though he’s sporting a double chin.
Lying, I am lying to John, but its not the first time and hopefully not the last. I had lied about Sarah in History class liking him, I had lied about Mycroft making me an extra lunch on school field trips. And now I lied about my soon to be association with James Moriarty.
It was on these days when John was reading ‘Oxfords text books of medicine’ he was on volume 6 now, that I would try my hardest to cheer John up.
Did John not know I could never stay mad at him? Never the less I grabbed the miniature explosives and for the first time in a long while John and I were the first to class. Although much to my ire separately, John and I alas didn’t actually have any classes together.
Silence. The phone call shut off, the white numbers indicating a call time of 3 minutes and 26 seconds. That was all that remained as my mind replayed John’s hollow screams, again and again.
“Normally your right, but… I though you might still be mad at me and I wanted to smooth things over.”
“Why hello Sherlock, I’m hurt you didn’t stay in contact with me after I moved.” James grinned sitting in the seat next to me.
“I wasn’t gonna let you touch it! If it was mold it could have made you sick” John’s laughter ceased, and I feared his thoughts where straying to far so I added
He was the only person who didn’t sneer at my deductions or fear my intelligence, to my surprise and indignation John didn’t actually think I was all that intelligent in the first place, if his chuckling at my failed astronomy exam was anything to go by.
Sherlock tensed for the next punch but to his surprise it never came. Instead a grunt could be heard above him as … none other than the popularly labelled 'black and blue John Watson’ stood above him. Grunting as Sebastian fists added to Johns amalgamation of bruises and cuts.
It was clear Moriarty had John, but would he attend the beatings himself? Easy enough to answer, call Moriarty. He picked up on the second ring.
Footsteps running down the hall, too many, too loud. I can’t hear what is happening, John? What’s happening I can’t hear?!?
... so if anyone reading this is mildly interested in me sending you 3a.m. rough drafts please inform me.
James must have found my answer sufficient as he smiled. “I’m sure you were very caught up in the samples I left for you.”
“It’s the wrong shade of foundation for your skin, you stole your sisters and earned another punch from her in the process.” I frowned at the notion of the last of Johns living relatives both hitting him.
When the final bell for lunch rang I darted out of the classroom ignoring the papers being passed out, I surely had points knocked off for forgetting to do something the teacher had said instead of bothering to write on the homework.
“John! What do I do? You’re the medical expert not me, Please!” I whimpered clutching my friend. I knew likely there was nothing I could do but what if… and suddenly every poison and deathly allegory that was even vaguely related to my John symptoms ran through my mind.
“Feel free to choose a seat” the teacher dismissed, I suddenly regretted forcing everyone away from me because now the only empty seats were directly next to me. I should have endured Sally’s spit balls and Molly’s pinning.
He flinched obviously hurt how plebeian. He opened and closed his mouth, what was he a fish? as I opened my mouth to voice my thoughts. He smirked whipping the hurt from his features “that’s hardly a deduction, everyone knows that. I thought you were smart?”
“With me, idiot! There’s more than enough room, my parents already adore you for putting up with me. While Mycroft might not be the biggest fan of you, he surely doesn’t hate you.”
Moriarty had lied about putting a stop to Johns daily school yard beatings. It was the only logical conclusion.
I smile unabashed, he looks beautiful the sun reflecting his freckles and making his wild hair glow. “It’s only fair, I’ve always known everything about you.”
Johns bruises got worse, his father must be spiraling or perhaps a dark voice in my head whispered, this was the price John had to pay for a weekend away. By all accounts John was quitter. He still got top marks in class, his teachers poorly locked desks tops offered proof of that. But the rumors, spoke of how John no longer raised his hand to answer. The charming warm boy I adore was fading with no one to draw him out and away from his abusive home.
Sherlock had never tried so hard to do, well anything before. Yet he found himself dedicating time and brain power into cheering John up after his mother unfortunate demise.
“But you can, with me.” I whispered but held my tongue from saying anything further. I couldn’t ever deny John; even to save him from himself, from his father, from his family.
The bell rang signalling that classes were beginning, John stood hefting his bag onto his shoulder with a pained flinch. I grabbed his arm and whispered for him to meet me during lunch in the janitors closest nearest the Office.
“What always happens but this time…. He hadn’t taken off his steal toed work boots. John your ribs?” John just nodded with a forced smile “Right as always.”
“You’re struggling in Adv. Chemistry, your studying the subject more than any of the other students and you haven’t even bothered to start your English paper”
“Why! Why would you want to stay? Your father is killing you John! Can’t you see it, can’t you feel it!!”
It was easy to deduce, Johns father was the root cause of John’s Mothers demise. Most likely he had given her aids and struck his very innocent son out of the blinding guilt.
“You care for him?!? Pathetic, did you learn nothing from Carl? Your better, we’re better then all of them!” He was so close now shouting voice crescendo-ing as he approached me. My face soured John was perfect and how dare he mention Carl!
Claire talked about her childhood and how she hated boys with a passion. She had gotten her heart broken one too many times and now she was giving up on men to live her life in solitude and raise foxes. However, John told her not to because men are just immature bastards that didn’t know anything, but every once in a while a gem would come along and you would have to hold onto him so tightly, but at the same time he wouldn’t ever want to let you go either. She decided to call those men a ‘John.’
“John.” Sherlock whispered. “Thank god you’re okay…” He knew John would be okay, he just didn’t like a passed out John. It was very unsettling.
Sherlock grumbled under his breath because the boy really needed to stop kicking him. It didn’t hurt, it was just a tap really, but there was mud caked on his shoes and it was getting all over Sherlock's. “Well, then, in that case I am not interested. As I appreciate the sentiment you’re not really my type so just run along and get back to yo—“ Sherlock was interrupted by the book being taken rudely from his hands. He finally looked up at Brain and glared at him. “Give. That. Back.” What was once calm, uncaring replies, was suddenly replaced with a growl.
Sherlock closed his eyes as he tried to picture the driver. Built body, blond sandy hair, white skin, a crazed look in his eye, white shir— JOHN’S DAD! Sherlock gasped and then started running as fast as he couldn’t, even though he was no match for the speeding car. There was only one way he would be stupid enough to go so fast, so reckless, and that was if he had John – not only that but if he had John and was planning on doing something stupid. Sherlock ran faster, even though it seemed impossible. He briefly thought that this was probably the fasted he had ever run in his whole life, but he needed to keep up with the car. Even with all the adrenaline pumping through Sherlock's veins, it seemed impossible to catch up. The car was going so fast and he only had his legs to carry him through the streets. Sherlock could tell it was heading for the river and he knew the car could only go right or left. Once the car turned whichever corner Sherlock knew it would be gone and he would lose it. He would lose John all because he wasn’t fast enough and for that he would never forgive himself.
Brian stopped kissing him, but still stayed hovering against Sherlock's skin. “Don't know actually... I bought it off some bloke.” He shrugged and then went back to sucking at Sherlock's skin like a leech.
Sherlock frowned deeply as he stumbled back and took a shaky breath, raking his brain for the next question to ask. How was this
was. He stuck out his hand and held it to Irene. “Hello. I’m John, Sherlock’s boyfriend. And you?” He said in a clipped tone, trying to hold his anger back. He really couldn’t blame it on her. It’s not like she could have possibly know this, especially since Sherlock was
"Anyways... I have what you're looking for. The memory stick! That is what you wanted.... Isn't it?" Sherlock hummed some.
John woke up the next morning and grinned with his eyes still shut. Sherlock was back and he honestly couldn’t be happier. He rolled over and hummed, “I missed you so much.” He said softly and reached out in front of him, when his hand hit the empty side of the bed he frowned and snapped his eyes open. His heart sank and he felt a crushing weight slam down on him, “No... no no no no no no no!” He cried out and then ran out of his bedroom. He looked in the kitchen, and then the living room, he ran up the stairs to the guest bedroom, only to run back down and check the living room again. When there was no sign of Sherlock he collapsed to the floor and broke down. “NO!!!” He screamed and yanked on his hair as hard as he could, he ended up pulling out quite a bit of hairs, but he couldn’t care less.
However, after a while his head started to feel extremely heavy. He couldn’t even keep it up on his own, and all his limbs felt like they were filled with heavy rocks. After several moments of struggling to keep his head up, he decided to just let his head fall back and hit the back of the couch. His fingers let go of the cup of tea, spilling hot liquid on his jeans, and shattering the mug all over the floor.
Brian groaned because really John was an idiot sometimes. “You punch him in the stomach… I already said that.” He said flatly.
John huffed and looked him dead in the eye, “Sherlock.” He said as seriously as could. “We need to cut your trousers off or you’ll have to live in them forever! Do you want that?” He moved his head closer to Sherlock's so he could get a better look into his eyes, inches away from his face
Sherlock swallowed and held the letter in his hands before delicately opening it, even though every fibre in his being wanted him to rip the letter open as fast as he could.
And then Sherlock broke. He started crying and he just threw the gun across the room. He was actually surprised it didn't go off when it hit the wall and fell to the floor. "No! He's in there somewhere! I know it! Come back to me... Please!!" He whimpered and wanted to run to John, but he stayed where he was.
Sherlock growls at him and John's scared for half a second, “You’re saying you didn’t mean any of it?”
John swallowed because he really hated it when Sherlock used that tone with him. Well, he supposed Sherlock had never used that tone with him, but he used it with other people and he hated that it was being directed towards him. “Sherlock… I’m sorry, but I’m not ready to come out… I never wanted to hurt you, but—“
John swallowed, nodding slowly. He had so many questions and a lot of things didn’t even make sense, but he was in so much pain and was exhausted. So for now, he believed Mycroft. He closed his eyes as he gently slid back down into a laying down position and was silent for a long while, “umm, can I call him?” He whispered. Great, not even back in London for twenty-four hours and he was already trying to contact Sherlock. So much for getting over him.
Brian shook his head. “I have something to say to just you.” He whispered. “I didn’t just choose you because you were the freak of the school—“
He closed his eyes as he slowly buttoned up his shirt with shaking hands when he felt a hand land on his shoulder. He jolted a little thinking it was Lestrade again even though he knew that was illogical because he saw them handcuff the man.
Sherlock nodded, “I know where he went. Stay where you are. I’m finally coming home. I’m coming back to John.” He said firmly and then hung up the phone.
He watched as the car drove right off the edge and plummeted into the river. Sherlock screamed John's name and that was rather silly because John was in a car and couldn’t hear him, but Sherlock screamed it anyway... He screamed it over and over and over again as he ran, even though he was wasting energy by doing so. By the time he got to the ledge of the drop off the car was nowhere to be seen, only water, ripples, and muck! “Come on, John...” He muttered under his breath. “Come on!!!”
John smiled and squeezed his hand softly. “So they know, then…” He asked in a whisper, though it wasn’t really a question.
Sherlock pounded on the door to his old house and waited, he tried using his key, but apparently Mycroft had the locks changed. Why he did that, Sherlock had no fucking idea. He tapped his foot angrily until the door opened and Mycroft blinked at him. Before his brother could say anything Sherlock shoved him and walked inside. “Tell the police you were lying. Let John go.” He spat, he had never in his life been this angry at his brother, not even the time he thought that his brother was betraying him to side with his father.
“Sherlock's not here,” John pointed out. “Maybe you were hoping a kicked off in Afghanistan, but then when I didn’t you had to come here and tell me not to seek Sherlock out. Don’t fucking worry, Mycroft. I let go of him two years ago.”
“Yes!! For god’s sakes I got that! But how does it work!!” He flailed more. “What does it do! What is it!”
Over the past three years Sherlock had become distant. He got together with Brian for a shag every now and again and Brian was actually living with him, but for the most part he ignored him. They didn’t even sleep in the same room, once they fucked Sherlock would kick him out to go sleep in his own room. He knew he could get away with it though because Brian was so in love with him that he would do anything for those shags and Sherlock loved that he didn’t have to work for them. They got high and had sex, but that really wasn’t saying much because Sherlock was high ninety percent of the time and when he wasn’t high, he was looking to get high. It was a nightmare without it, he couldn’t cope or function… but he was also a nightmare to the people around him when he wasn’t high either.
Eventually, the doctors and nurses stopped asking John questions and left the two alone. Silence enveloped the room and Sherlock swallowed hard... he didn’t know what to say... he supposed he really shouldn’t be the first one to say anything anyway. Perhaps, he shouldn’t even be in the room, he should have left with the doctors and waited until John asked for him.
‘Oh my god I am dealing with a high three year old!’ John thought bitterly to himself. “I’m sorry if I offended you in anyway… Come on.. I think you’ll like my flat!” He hummed and leaned on his cane further.
Sherlock had been trying so hard to forgive John, but he just felt guilt, he couldn’t even be mad at John for lying to him about the letters – even if he was. He was lying to John about the drugs, and about Brian, and the longer he went about lying the worse he felt. Christ, he even still fucked Brian for the first week of John's return because he still didn’t believe it was real. He basically cheated on him, for one, but drugs did lower one’s inhibitions. For two, he was pushing John away over a small stupid lie, when he was lying about much worse things. Slowly though, he was trying to stop using the drugs, for John's sake – he didn’t even need them anymore since he had John back – but he knew he couldn’t stop cold turkey. He was getting better though and was taking much less than he was when John first walked into his flat. He was making progress and that’s all he cared about. Perhaps once he was completely clean things would go back to the way they were. John still wouldn’t sleep in the bed with him, when he did sleep over he always slept on the couch, but they still hadn’t had sex and Sherlock was cruel to him most of the time, so it all made sense.
“No, my love. This is all about you. It’s my surprise to you so just lay there.” He whispered and started to take off his shirt slowly. He was already rock hard and his erection was straining against his trousers. He could barely even get home fast enough, and it turns out that running with an erection is not a pleasant thing to do. He got his shirt off and watched as John licked his lips. Sure, they had seen each other naked while they were getting changed, or getting out of the shower, but this was different. This meant something… this meant everything. This was their first time and it was going to be magical. It was going to be about forgiveness, love, an apology. All the feelings Sherlock felt, but couldn’t voice.
John grinned brightly, “Really!! Yes!!” he skipped around the kitchen and then ran to the front door. “Well come on then!! Primark awaits!!”
John’s laughing eventually stopped, but he didn’t step away from Sherlock. If anything he kept getting closer. “I really can’t stay at your house though… I would be intruding and I don’t have any clothes. Thank you for the offer, but—“
John froze and then practically fell off the seat when his father turned the corner abruptly. He had thought of dying before... how it was going to happen. He thought of a million scenarios, but something he hoped and prayed didn’t happen to him was drowning. Drowning was one of his biggest fears and he would rather get shot multiple times over before he was about to drown, but now he didn’t have a choice! He couldn’t even try to escape because he was tied up! He started to hyperventilate and he closed his eyes slowly. He tried to find peace deep down, something to calm him. He thought of Sherlock, his Sherlock! The fictional one that he was in love with. His Sherlock told him soothing words of how it will all be okay and how he would be with John every step of the way.
John growls and shoves him harder, “ARE YOU SERIOUS? YOU’RE ACTUALLY GOING TO LISTEN TO ME?” John doesn’t know what he's saying... he's just hurting so much. Nothing makes sense and he feels like he's about to explode.
Sherlock was a moaning mess. It was unlike anything he had ever experienced before. It was a slight burn, but it was also so wonderful and so magical. He wondered if it would feel like this no matter who was doing it or if it was just more wonderful because it was John. He practically screamed when John hit the right spot. “Do that again!!” He said enthusiastically. And just like he asked John did it again, and again, and again. Because John knew how to please him and would always know how to please him. Even if it was a bit rough at the beginning. He would never leave John… he would stay with John for as long as John would have him because he loved this boy so much. He felt as John pulled out his fingers and then watched as he rolled a condom onto his erection.
Brian swallowed thickly and didn’t say anything for a long time, what was there to say? After ages of silence, staring at the wall and thinking, he nodded slowly because he gathered a world with Sherlock was one he wanted... whether it was what he imagined or not and perhaps with time Sherlock would learn to love him. And maybe that wasn’t the best way to start a relationship, but perhaps Sherlock would settle. Honestly, he would take anything at this point just to be with the boy lying next to him. He didn’t say anything about John and he didn’t say he was sorry because he wasn’t. He was glad John was dead in all honesty – sure, John was his mate, and sure they used to be best friends, but he was always beating him at everything and Brian was sick of it. Hell, he even had Sherlock and Brian didn’t, except for now things were about to change because John couldn’t be here to take things away from him. Perhaps that was selfish, but Brian knew he was a selfish person and he kicked John to the curb long ago, whether John knew that or not.
John laughed loudly and rolled his eyes again, “Answer me a question, please?” He waited until Mycroft nodded slowly and then he began, “How many times has Sherlock had an unsolved case?”
“Okayyyy,” She sung. “But don't say I didn’t warn you.” She giggled and started making him a drink, from where John was sitting it looked like she was pouring every bloody alcohol the place owned into it.
John swallowed because Sherlock was offering to eat a sandwich when Sherlock hadn’t been eating at all... Plus, the fact that Sherlock telling him to stop blaming himself was easier said than done, but a shower did sound lovely… He nodded slowly and stood up. “Promise you’ll be alright..?” He asked as he bent down and grabbed the bag that Mycroft had brought him on the first day.
John laughed, “Hell no! I won’t let him go anywhere near that game when he’s with me... he gets way too aggressive and it never ends well anymore. We now have the board game along with a knife stabbed into our wall.”
So about that every Thursday thing... Well it's just too hard because being a grown up is so so hard! and ugh! Like.... I work all the time and then I'm too tired to write... BUT DON'T WORRY I AM NOT GIVING UP!!! And this is the longest Chapter I believe!!
Sherlock would yell at him a lot nowadays, whereas before the army he never raised his voice at John... unless he needed to, but that was very rare... and actually the only time he did yell was when he told John to leave because this relationship was an experiment. John didn’t want to ever think about that time again though. However, now he couldn’t even remember how many times he got yelled at in one day. He took to sleeping on the couch again because most days he just needed space after a full day of verbal abuse.
PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE COMMENT!!! OR KUDOS OR SUBSCRIBE BUT MAINLY COMMENTS BECAUSE READING YOUR COMMENTS ARE SO BEAUTIFUL AND ITS LIKE A RAINBOW EXPLODED RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU AND NOW YOU'RE COVERED IN COLOURS BECAUSE THE RAINBOW IS COLOURFUL AND I KNOW THAT MAKES NO SENSE BUT COMMENTS ARE BEAUTIFUL SO DO IT!
Well, that was a question. He had been living off of Sherlock's money. He hated that he had relied on that, but after Sherlock died it was too much. He had to quit the job he had gotten at the surgery because he didn’t have the strength to come in. Now that he was two years out of practice, he wondered if there was any place that would accept him. “I’m in between jobs at the moment…” It wasn’t a lie he just wasn’t going to tell her that he had been in between jobs for over two years now.
His father laughed while John punched him. “You think a fag like yourself is going to hurt me?! Please you’re as weak as a woman! Actually you’re probably weaker than a woman,” His laughter boomed through the room and Sherlock shivered as he felt his skin crawl. There was something about Ted that was off, aside from the aggression and drunkenness, of course. He just couldn’t put his finger on what it was.
John kissed down his neck, to his chest, before shimmying out of his pants. Honestly, he had just been exhausted, but they hadn’t been intimate since before Sherlock's mum had died. If this is what Sherlock needed to feel comfort, he was going to give it to him with everything in his being.
“Sherlock! Stop it!! You’re going to be just fine. And we are going to go home and it will be so lovely and nice. And then we are going to grow old together!! I’ve always wanted that Sherlock, I’ve always wanted to grow old with you and we could live in a cottage and you could raise bees and we would have thirty-seven cats!! And they would all have a different name and our children would come to visit us and they would play with our thirty-seven cats…” John swallowed as the tears streamed down his face and then looked at Mycroft. “Hurry!!!”
Sherlock jerked out of the blanket so fast and leapt across the bed, “John!! Make it leave!!” He was sobbing and shaking, and surprisingly very quick and agile for a naked, drunk man.
The Detective Inspector nodded slowly and after a moment’s hesitation he began to speak again, "How is he..."
Sherlock swallowed and nodded. “I think they are sorry, but only because the principle had to call an ambulance.” He shrugged a bit and paused before he continued. “You didn’t have to do that, John.” He reached out and gently grabbed John's, non broken, hand and swiped his thumb over John's thumb.
“I- I would have nothing left, but John... I don’t- he’s gone... I think... I don’t think he will hurt you! He’s all talk!!” Sherlock said firmly, pointedly ignoring the first part.
Two weeks had passed and John still hadn’t told Sherlock about his mother. He knew that wasn’t a good thing because he didn’t know how much time Lily had in the first place and by keeping this from Sherlock he felt like he was lying. She was always there for Sherlock and John saw her as the only person Sherlock could trust and look up to fully. He didn’t even think he fit into that category anymore because things still weren’t the same between them. John had accepted the fact that they would never be the same again, but at the same time it still hurt.
Somehow he had wandered into the middle of the road and he looked up. He didn’t even know where he was because he couldn’t think and he hadn’t been paying attention. What he saw though made him freeze, he was in the middle of the road and a car was speeding towards him. The car was well over the speed limit and Sherlock couldn’t move! He wasn’t sure he wanted to move and he figured that was probably why he couldn’t, this was the end and he didn’t even care... He had hurt John so badly he couldn’t even live with himself. Though, he had done what he needed to do and he took pride in the knowledge that he had made the right decision.
Sherlock narrowed his eyes and growled, “Oh great! You’re leaving me for a woman and you want me to meet her!”
John shook his head some and started to hang up their clothes, it would make it feel more homey for the both of them. Years ago when he started living here they never once slept in Sherlock's bedroom... This bedroom had quickly become Sherlock and John’s room, not the guest bedroom. In a way John never had his own bedroom either, Sherlock had slept with him the first night and never left. John had hated being alone ever since, even when he was in the army.
John sighed and asked him anyway, "Are you cheating on me?" He whispered. He was terrified of the answer, but Sherlock was hiding something. He also knew the signs of cheating, never leaving your phone unattended, never letting your partner see it, getting angry when they did. It didn’t explain the look of pain Sherlock got on his face, but maybe it was more nervousness at being caught rather than pain. He hated thinking that Sherlock would cheat on him, but honestly it was the only thing that made sense. That or Sherlock was using again and it was from his drug dealer – honestly, John would take the cheating.
John shook his head and sat back up, “Nope... I’m trying to stop drinking – or at least pull back. I’m only drinking every other night and tonight happens to be my sober night.” He gave her a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes and played with his hands under the table.
"Calm down? CALM DOWN?? You're telling me to move out of my fucking house and yet I'm the one that needs to
“You do not talk to me like that! You hear?” he screamed, walking over to John and yanking him up by his hair. “You can no longer be a
John blinked a bit in surprise... in all honesty he was just expecting a hand job, but this was so much better. He groaned and tangled his fingers into Blake’s hair and thrusted. After about six minutes of pure bliss he came into Blake’s mouth and lay limp. He supposed these little adventures he had with the staff would be so much better if he could do it with someone he cared about, but John didn't care about anyone - he never did.
Mycroft’s thin lips curled into a smile, but it wasn’t a pleasant one, “How quaint. You picked up a few things from my brother. I’m glad something got through to you. He left you something behind.” He drawled and took his hand away from his foot. “No, you are right. Sherlock has drugged me on occasion. He even drugged you a couple of times after you came back from the military.” He tilted his head.
Sherlock was intrigued at everything he was looking at. John had so many personal and sentimental items it was rather cute. He mentally kicked himself for calling John cute. He picked up a small stuffed squirrel and turned it over in his hands.
She sighed because she knew he wouldn’t be able to stop cold turkey, but he was trying so that made her happy. “You should tell him,” She whispered.
when his phone rang. He didn’t want to get his hopes up, but who else would be calling him at two in the morning. He answered his mobile without looking at the caller ID because he was pretty sure if he saw who it was, he wouldn’t have answered.
“That’s fucking ridiculous! I just don’t want to hurt someone who was doing absolutely nothing! And since when have I ever been a violent person? I bloody apologise to the opposite team when I accidentally hurt them!” He flailed slightly. He knew trying to get out of this was pointless, but maybe if he bought them time Sherlock would figure something out, or the bell would ring. John wouldn’t look at Sherlock though, he couldn’t because he knew that if he saw the look on Sherlock's face he would snap. He would snap and he would go after Brain and that wouldn’t be helping anyone.
“I don’t know.. They just do... And no you aren’t Sherlock because he is dead.” John rolled his eyes a bit.
That was another thing that was worrying John... He wouldn't leave his phone just lying around. He always had it and whenever he got a text he jumped and got a pained look on his face. He wouldn't even let John touch the phone without yelling at him, "Sherlock, can you answer me a question?" Sometimes John just touched the phone to get a rise out of Sherlock because anger was better than being completely ignored.
Brian scoffed and shook his head, “Well, you’re no fun.” He huffed and then just stood up and left the flat. Sherlock did think that that was a bit weird... maybe he had imagined the whole thing and had just taken too much cocaine... because he did take some with this tea, he remembered shooting up while the kettle boiled. Still, it was terrifying whether it was real or not and he was just glad that Brian was gone. If Brian came back however, he was definitely going to kick him out… he didn’t think he would be able to look at him the same ever again. He took one last deep breath before collapsing to the ground and passing out.
Sherlock whimpered and panicked slightly, he was terrified if he grabbed John that John would run as fast as he could to the ledge. He needed to get John to believe him, but he also needed to do it in a way that wouldn’t startle John, that seemed nearly impossible. "No! No! John- would – Look – Would a figment have this..?" He whispered and slowly reached into his pocket to grab the locket John had lost so long ago.
The man hummed, “Here you are.” He looked him up and down and then licked his lips, “We would have been so good together, but you chose him.”
awwww!! wasn't that so adorable!! I thought so! I just love my Sherlock and John as a teenager! I also really like how john goes way too fast and it's not perfect. its awkward and embarrassing and fumbly but it all just works out. And sherlock saying patience really is a virtue, john. is honestly probably one of my favourite lines because that's just so him. And when they grow up... Guys... I'm writing Chapter Eight as we speak and this story isn't anywhere near being done.... uhhhhh
He held onto the man for what seemed like ages... He didn’t know how long, but when he finally pulled away the DI was looking down at him with a kindness and sadness in his eyes and Sherlock didn’t understand...
hahahha five years later and i'm editing the damn chapters so I can finish updating this fic. anyway i hate mark and moffat for the shit show that is s4. So i am in no way like moffat. but i am evil. I gave myself some feels reading that. shit damn.
She made sure she had a handle on the man before she slowly stood up and violently flipped him over. She dropped back down on him so that she was sitting on his tummy, making it so he was unable to escape. She hissed slightly when the moonlight made it so she couldn’t see his face and tore off his hood. What she saw made her blood run cold, her stomach dropped, and she felt incredibly ill, "Sherlock..." She whimpered.
Blake swallowed thickly, but didn’t take his hand away. “Sir..?” That escalated rather quickly and Blake didn't like where this was heading at all. There were rumours that John raped some of the servants, but even though John killed people for a living he couldn’t see John raping anyone... he had a theory that John got raped as a child or something and would never stoop that low... Sure he would make people give him random hand jobs or blow jobs, but he didn't think that he actually fucked anyone unless they wanted it. He knew that any sort of sexual activity without consent was considered rape... so he supposed in a way John did rape people, but he could never see John holding someone down and fucking them senseless while they screamed for mercy. He didn't know why, but he just didn't think that he was that type of person... it was silly to think that really because of all the things John did for a living.
The next day Sherlock and John woke up and started getting dressed again. John wasn’t feeling that great, but it was just a little tingle in his stomach. Plus, they were going to go see Lily today and John hadn’t seen her in five years... he wasn’t going to miss that for anything.
John swallowed as his phone vibrated and looked down at the incoming text. He hadn’t gone far; he just went to Regent’s Park, which was right down the street from Baker Street. He didn’t know why he didn’t just go back to the motel, it was stupid to waste all the money he had and not even stay in the bloody place. He also didn’t know how long it would take for Sherlock to read all of the letters and he really didn’t want to go to his room, only to be leaving again within minutes. Unfortunately, he wasn’t tired either so he wasn’t planning on sleeping at all that night, if he had gone back to his room and slept that would be different, but he supposed he was waiting for Sherlock to reply. That and the adrenaline of the last few hours was keeping him on edge.
“You’re not explaining anything. You can tell me nothing that is actually worth listening to! You don’t know anything about this case at all and frankly I don’t even know how you got in here! But you are leaving now and you should be
He walked all the way home and went to Mycroft, “Mycroft...” He whispered quietly, knocking on the door to his study before letting himself in.
She growled at him slightly and shook her head, “No excuse. What have you two done since you’ve been back?”
“It’s your fucking chair, Sherlock! You should bloody well sit in it!” he snapped and put the paper down, casting his glare at Sherlock. This wasn’t about the chair, they both knew it wasn’t about the chair. It was about last night – well, and all the other times John had asked. The conversation still hanging fresh in his mind, they all did really, but last night seemed to weigh more heavily on him.
Sherlock growled a bit and rolled his eyes, “oh, not planning on telling them either? Real mature, John.”
John sighed and shook his head as he handed Sherlock his phone, “Of course that is what you needed.” And for the rest of the night they went on with the case. Dinner was vital and he finally got his chance to ditch the cane. He was so thankful for that, but then Sherlock managed to get kidnapped and John thought he could strangle the man. Instead he managed to save Sherlock's life and he most definitely didn’t miss the fact that his eyes lit up and he smiled just a bit brighter.
He could hear the DI growl on the other end, “Son of a bitch. You’re a fucking arsehole for what you put John through.” He spat into the phone, he could practically see the DI shaking his head in frustration.
redpants221b is a cute little individual who comments on the majority of my chapters. This person loves my work and they asked me to give them a new chapter as an update... sure they were probs joking slash didn't think it would actually happen, but let me tell you this IT DID!!
“John, I’m trying really hard… just… Kiss me…. Please? One last time…” He coughed a bit and then groaned again and closed his eyes.
John growled. "Will you just shut the fuck up?" He snapped and then whimpered because Claire was right, his throat hurt like hell.
Once they got there, John took a seat in an area where no one was. However, it didn't last long and he bristled slightly to himself, he just wanted to be alone, but then, Claire, Garrett, and Zack were sitting next to him. The funeral passed by in a blur really. He wasn't listening and he wasn't paying attention. He almost forgot where he was until someone was nudging at him. He looked up at Zack, who then nodded his head towards the front. Oh... Right... He had to speak. He slowly stood up and walked to the front of the crowd, making his way up the five steps to reach the stand where the podium was.
The garden was set under a large stony gateway and was filled with an assortment of flowers. There was a section of purple, red, and yellow roses. Stargazer lilies were scattered about. There were daisies every which way. Every flower John had ever seen, and some he hadn’t, were in the garden. It was breathtaking and John loved it.
“Yeah, okay. Get rid of me.” He hummed, “I see how it is!” John chuckled, “And don't worry! I’ll bring him back to meet you soon!” And with that he kissed her cheek again and left.
She whistled and then stuck out her hand to Sherlock, “I’m Claire and you are very handsome – Though, not as handsome as John.” She smirked and then winked at him.
“You aren’t getting away from me that easily… what are you hiding?” He cocked his head a little to the side and gave John a look that immediately reminded him of a confused cat. “If it’s because you live in a smaller house than me, well don’t be embarrassed... a lot of people live in small houses.”
“But why do you want to die!” Sherlock choked out, “Whatever is wrong... suicide isn’t the answer and it will get better. You don’t have to do this and I really don’t even see how John and I come into play! What did I ever do to you?”
“So help me, Mycroft… You better get John out of jail or I assure you, I will never forgive you and you will never see me again.” With that he turned and left, listening to the shaky breath Mycroft sucked in as he watched him leave.
Sherlock swallowed hard and held John closer. This wasn’t fair! “Please!! Just wait a little bit longer! He’ll wake up I’m sure of it!” He said firmly.
“Zack, I know... It’s fine. I should have just gone home to begin with...” He swallowed and looked away. He refused to go back to his home and he wouldn’t now even though he couldn’t live with Zack anymore. Truthfully he didn’t know where he was going to stay for three weeks, but he figured it didn’t really matter. It was spring, nearing summer, and so the weather was somewhat reasonable... Depending if it wanted to be or not.
Claire was silent for a long moment, trying to calm down so she didn’t scream into the phone and wake up John. “Because he thinks you’re dead, whereas you know he’s alive. You know you’re coming back and yet he thinks he has to live the rest of his life without the one person he loves most. Not only that, but he had to watch you fling yourself off a building and nothing he said could stop you. So no. Do not sit there on the other end and tell me that you’re hurting just as much. In fact, I’ll be surprised if your little stunt didn’t just send him further into depression. Actually hang on, I know your stunt sent him further into depression, you
“John! You’re literally only cutting like a couple of strands! You won’t even be able to notice! Stop being so dramatic about it.” He huffed and tilted his head forward, closer to John.
“Quite, and do call me Moriarty. Throwing my parents name around gives me an edge in this pompous school.”
I Blushed embarrassed but unable to be anything but happy alongside John “how was I supposed to know it was a natural dye if you wouldn’t even let me touch it!”
“I was curious where you ran off to after class” James spoke standing in the entrance of the hallway that led to the cafeteria.
“Rhubarb jam is your favourite! I can tell be the stain on your cheek and the number of crumbs on your uniform lapels”
Every strike of the second hand made me tense every sweep of a minute hand made me flinch the constant ticking made me sick. How could time pass so slowly? Time had seemed to fly by recently there where only a few months of 8th grade left, John. John had made this school year fly and now, now I was with the exact opposite of John.
A vague scuffling noise could be heard at the bottom of the stairwell as I opened the stairwell door. Reaching the white walled basement littered with closed white doors poorly labelled with black bold print.
“Finally figured it out, have you? Not very sharp of you, Sherley. I thought you would surely know when rumour of him dropping rugby circulated, but NO! You were still blindly at my side. Don’t you see? Sherley, he makes you blind and dull!”
“Horripilation,” a voice similar to John’s chimed in the back of my head, the medical cause for goosebumps.
“you got the whole school shut down for the day because your brother called the FDA inspection team”
“He’s missing! He didn’t come home last night! Do you see me!!! This is what happens when that little shit decides to run away!”
“What did he do?” It was a stupid question. I could see what he had done, John lay on a cot bandage and bruised. James had, had my John beat, worse then i'd ever seen.
Much to my displeasure I still after all these months, caught John reading medical texts. Commonly when the bruises where particularly bad or his sister was to hungover to drive him to school.
The school? Feasible, but why bother leaving? Would John have stayed here all night? It would certainly explain how he’d kept his attendance records up while apparently not going home last night.
John broke out into a blinding smile “you love my compliments and if I didn’t ask you dumb questions you’d never get to brag enough for me to compliment you in the first place” they laughed a feeling Sherlock almost didn’t register as odd any more. John was like that, he somehow managed to make the ‘freak’ Sherlock Holmes feel not normal, never normal... but accepted.
The school bench John sat on creaked with the wind, I couldn’t keep eye contact shamefully I looked away. “It really wasn’t that impressive, you have a hospital bracelet on your wrist; it can’t be your sister in the hospital she dropped you off this morning and it’s not your dad because the fresh bruise around your neck.” Tears dripped down Johns rosy cheeks “amazing” he whispered.
“What are you?” John’s voice for the first time, doesn’t sound like slurred confidence, instead laced with fear and pain.  O’ please no! OPEN DOOR PLEASE!
I took a sharp left turn towards the basement staircase. But of course I lost my footing, sprawling across slippery tiles and into the basement door. Catching myself against the wall, I used my momentum to push off, on my feet again, white knuckling the guard rail down two flights of poorly lit stairs.
It was Sebastian Wilkes this time, his meaty fists pounding me into our private middle schools cheap blue and white checkered tile.
I smirked “You always ask the wrong questions; the right question is who did it.” John rolled his eyes
I flinched as always when delivering deductions, John as always smiled. He went on to explain that he had always suspected his dad wasn't the most faithful and since John had taken up reading medical texts in a blind effort to save his mum. He had also found aids to be the most likely of answers.
Johns sense of loyalty astounded me, she was vile and selfish and he refused to let me help him for her pathetic sake. Now he was missing and she could only think of herself. Even more concerning then her thankless tears was what she had said about John coming home bruised. Typically I would throw away the remark as rugby scuffles but he’d quite... Cold ran through my veins, he’d quite because his body couldn’t anymore abuse.
“I was worried about you… I didn’t hear about anything in school blowing up.” John whimpered, guilt flooded me. John was shouted at enough I knew better then to snap at him.
“I can’t let you choose him Sherlock, not after what you’ve told me.” John said with such fierce determination.
“Wanna blow up something in class?” John asked pulling two miniature black cat fireworks out of his trousers pocket.
It broke my heart to have his rage directed at me, but the affect was severely lessened by the crushing disparity that engulfed me at the sight of Johns fresh still bleeding  bruises. It was hard enough to gaze at the yellowing bruises of yesterdays late night beatings regularly doled out by his father. However, to know I was the reason his rosy lips were bloody and split, why his eye was a pallet of cool coolers sealed shut and puffy. I couldn’t have that, rather John be friendless then abused by another person he loved.
